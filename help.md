<h2>Search</h2>
<p>The collection of pathway figures can be searched by gene symbol, title and other keywords, either directly in the <b>Search</b> field at the top of each page or on the front page. For example, search for your favorite pathway by a word from the title (i.e. "Statin"), or your favorite gene either by symbol (i.e. "BRCA1").</p>

<h2>Browse</h2>
<p>The Pathway Figure OCR content can be browsed in multiple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/browse/table.html">Table</a> view of all figures. To find a specific figure by title simply use the built-in browser find-in-page feature by selecting <b>Ctrl+F</b> or <b>Command+F</b>.</li>
<li><a href="/browse/organisms.html">Pathway Figures by Organism</a>.</li> 
<li><a href="/browse/wikipathways.html">Pathway Figures translated to WikiPathways</a>: View a subset of figures that have been manually translated into WikiPathways models.</li>
<li><a href="/browse/ndex.html">Pathway Figures deposited at NDEx</a>: View the subset of pathway figures below that have been coverted to the Cytoscape CX format and deposited at NDEx.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Analyze</h1>

<p>Pathway gene sets can be used for analysis in multiple tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/" target="_blank">Enrichr</a> tool includes the Pathway Figure OCR gene sets as one of its libraries for enrichment analysis.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://www.ndexbio.org/iquery/" target="_blank">NDEx Integrated Query</a> for quick enrichment analysis.</li>
<li>Use our <a href="https://gladstone-bioinformatics.shinyapps.io/shiny-25years/" target="_blank">27 Years of Pathway Figures interactive tool</a> to explore the content.</li>
<li>Use our GMT file as a custom data source in the <a href="https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost" target="_blank">g:Profiler</a> tool for enrichment analysis.</li>
</ul>
