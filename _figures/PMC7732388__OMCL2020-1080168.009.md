caption: The schematic signaling pathways involved in DDF-induced HO-1 expression
  inhibited thrombin-stimulated CTGF induction in HCFs. DDF-induced HO-1 expression
  was, at least in part, mediated through the activation of the ROS-dependent p38
  MAPK/Nrf2 pathway, which attenuated the thrombin-stimulated CTGF induction. “⟶”
  means “activated,” and “⊥” means “inhibited.”
