caption: Model of the signaling pathways regulating the virulence and differentiation
  of C. neoformans. Both the MAPK and the cAMP-signaling pathways control mating.
  The MAPK pathway mediates pheromone-responsive mating signals through the seven
  transmembrane pheromone receptors Ste3α/a, the Gβ subunit Gpb1, the p20-activated
  protein kinase Ste20α/a, the MAPK kinase kinase Ste11α/a, the MAPK kinase Ste7,
  and the MAPK Cpk1. Ras1 appears to transmit mating signals through Gpb1 and downstream
  MAPK components. In contrast, nutritional starvation signals are transduced via
  the Gα subunit Gpa1, the adenylyl cyclase Cac1, cAMP, and the catalytic subunits
  Pka1/2 and regulatory subunit Pkr1 of PKA. Aca1 appears to activate the Cac1-cAMP
  pathway independent of Gpa1. Solid lines or arrows indicate the major paths of signal
  flow and dashed arrows represent less significant events.
