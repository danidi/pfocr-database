caption: Proposed mechanism for WIN-induced inhibition of prostate LNCaP cells NE
  differentiation. The synthetic cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) preserves
  the levels of the cannabinoid receptor CB2. This results in inhibition of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. Akt signals through two pathways, activation of mTOR and inhibition of
  AMPK. The inhibition of Akt by the cannabinoid WIN produces inhibition of mTOR and
  activation of AMPK. Both phenomena cause inhibition of NE differentiation, although
  mTOR has a minor contribution than AMPK. ACC, acetyl CoA carboxylase; AMPK, AMP-dependent
  protein kinase; NE, neuroendocrine.
