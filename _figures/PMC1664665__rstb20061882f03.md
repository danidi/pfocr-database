caption: ECM-integrin signalling coordinates with growth factor signalling to regulate
  efficient axon growth. PI3K and Raf-MEK-ERK are two major signalling pathways downstream
  of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activated by neurotrophic factors. Integrin
  signalling cascades activated upon ECM binding can interact with both of these pathways.
  Downstream of PI3K, integrin linked kinase (ILK) that binds to the β subunit of
  integrins is required for GSK-3 inactivation and the subsequent regulation of microtubule
  dynamics via various microtubule associated proteins (MAPs). ILK is also required
  for Rac/Cdc42 activation downstream of PI3K to regulate actin dynamics via actin
  binding proteins (ABPs). Integrin signalling may also directly regulate actin dynamics
  and growth cone motility by controlling two actin-based motor proteins, myosin X
  and myosin II. Interestingly, myosin X binds directly to the integrin β subunit
  and is also under the control of PI3K. Together, coordination between the integrin
  and PI3K pathways regulates local growth cone motility and axon assembly. ECM-integrin
  signalling can also regulate the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway downstream of RTK activation.
  Specifically, FAK and Src activation upon ECM-integrin engagement have been shown
  to activate the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway and the subsequent regulation of transcription
  factors. There is also evidence that Rac/Cdc42 is able to cross talk with the Raf-MEK-ERK
  pathway and regulate gene expression. In summary, integrin signalling interacts
  with PI3K and Raf-MEK-ERK pathways to regulate both the genetic programme and local
  signalling during neurotrophic factor-induced axon growth.
