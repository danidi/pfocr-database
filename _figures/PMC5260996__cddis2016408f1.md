caption: 'Extrinsic and intrinsic effect of inflammatory-driven Notch activation on
  tumorigenesis. When Notch signaling is activated in macrophages, it can induce the
  production of specific inflammatory mediators which in turn stimulate epithelial
  cells: thus, although not occurring into the epithelial cell, the dysregulation
  of the Notch pathway can indirectly exert a control on tumor progression (extrinsic
  effect). Alternately, the inflammatory milieu can directly modulate the Notch signaling
  within the epithelial cells, regulating several molecular processes involved in
  tumorigenesis (intrinsic effect)'
