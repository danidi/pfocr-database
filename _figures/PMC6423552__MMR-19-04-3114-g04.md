caption: Excessive release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals activates BDNF,
  TrkB, p-MEK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 in postsynaptic neurons. Excitatory damage may be caused
  by chronic metabolic diseases, including diabetes mellitus. This may stimulate excessive
  release of glutamate, which induces a massive influx of calcium mediated by NMDA
  and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptors in the postsynaptic
  striatal neurons, thereby activating the MAPK pathway and BDNF. Once BDNF secretion
  is activated, it binds to its receptor TrkB, localized on the presynaptic and postsynaptic
  membranes. Presynaptic TrkB receptors are known to mediate the enhancement of glutamate
  release, whereas postsynaptic TrkB receptors enhance the response of NMDA receptors
  to calcium ions. Excessive influx of calcium ions into the postsynaptic striatal
  neurons results in continuous activation of the MAPK and BDNF pathways, which ultimately
  causes excitatory damage to the striatum. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor;
  ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase; NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate; p-, phosphorylated; TrKB, tyrosine receptor
  kinase B.
