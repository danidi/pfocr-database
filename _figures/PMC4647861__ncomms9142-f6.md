caption: (a) Scheme depicting cytosolic formation of phenylalanine and potential feedback
  inhibition mechanisms involved in plastidial phenylalanine biosynthesis. In PhpCAT-RNAi
  lines, phenylalanine and tyrosine may accumulate in plastids and feedback inhibit
  arogenate dehydratase (ADT) and arogenate dehydrogenase (ADH), respectively, as
  well as chorismate mutase 1 (CM1). If plastidial ADTs also function as prephenate
  dehydratases (PDTs), then the enzymatic conversion of prephenate to phenylpyruvate
  may also be subject to feedback inhibition by phenylalanine. It is unclear if phenylpyruvate
  utilized in the alternative phenylalanine biosynthetic pathway originates from the
  plastid, or from cytosolic conversion of chorismate exported from the plastid. White
  boxes with question marks indicate unknown transporters/transport steps. AS, anthranilate
  synthase. For remaining abbreviations, see . (b) Flux models representing the phenylalanine
  biosynthetic network in 2-day-old petunia flowers from control and PhpCAT-RNAi lines.
  Computer-assisted metabolic modelling was performed using pool sizes and isotopic
  abundances of phenylalanine and tyrosine, and measurements of phenylalanine-derived
  volatile emission from petunia petal tissue supplied with 10 mM 15N-tyrosine for
  up to 6 h. The rate of plastidial flux (v1) in PhpCAT-RNAi lines was found to be
  significantly lower than control based on comparisons of absolute fluxes and two-tailed
  Student's t-tests corrected by Bonferroni method (P<0.05). The rate of change in
  cytosolic flux (v2) in PhpCAT-RNAi lines was found to be significantly higher than
  control (P<0.01) based on paired-sample two-tailed Student's t-tests of slopes (see
  Methods for additional details). n=3 for control and n=6 for PhpCAT-RNAi lines.
