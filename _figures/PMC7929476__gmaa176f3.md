caption: Schematic diagram of the role of the RAS in cardiovascular injury and proposed
  SARS-CoV-2 action Renin catalyzes angiotensinogen to generate Ang I. The production
  of Ang II from Ang I is enhanced by ACE, and Ang II induces cardiovascular injury
  by stimulation of the AT1R, while ACE2 negatively regulates this pathway and protects
  against cardiovascular injury. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by
  the binding of spike protein to ACE2 and downregulates the protective molecule ACE2,
  thereby resulting in cardiovascular injury. ACEIs and ARBs, as inhibitors of the
  RAS, can inhibit ACE and AT1R, respectively, thus reducing cardiovascular injury.
