caption: Mechanisms by which NAD+ modulates TGF-β1. Exposure to extracellular NAD+
  increases both the expression and activation of TGF-β1. NAD+ signals through cADPR
  and Ca2+ to activate TGF-β1, which can then auto-induce its own mRNA production,
  leading to increased expression of latent TGF-β1 protein. The effect of NAD+ depends
  on the prior conversion to cADPR, an effect antagonized by the cADPR antagonist
  8-Br-cADPR. The effects of NAD+ and cADPR require Ca2+ mobilization, are mimicked
  by Ca2+ agonists (Bradykinin, Ionomycin) and are inhibited by Ca2+ antagonists (BAPTA,
  Verapamil). Mechanistic mathematical modeling of the complex effects of NAD+/cADPR/Ca2+
  on TGF-β1 suggests a Ca2+-independent pathway for NAD+signaling as well as a slow
  mechanism for inhibition of TGF-β1 activation that is induced at high levels of
  Ca2+.
