caption: Schematic representation of OPRM1-Gαi2-Src kinase  signaling pathway in lipid
  rafts. A, lipid raft microdomains  contain OPRM1, Gαi2, Src kinases, AC, and flotillin-1  (Flo-1),
  a lipid raft marker that is also known to anchor the  signaling molecules, such
  as Src kinases  () and G-proteins (L. Zhang  and P.-Y. Law, unpublished observation)
  in lipid raft. There is another pool  of OPRM1 located outside the lipid raft. B,
  under the acute agonist  treatment, OPRM1 interacts with Gαi2 and causes the  inhibition
  of adenylyl cyclase activity and the decrease of intracellular cAMP  level (). After
  chronic  agonist treatment, Src kinase is recruited by OPRM1-Gαi2  signal complex,
  and it is activated by autophosphorylation at  Tyr416. The activated Src will phosphorylate
  the OPRM1 at  Tyr336. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the  phosphorylated
  and activated OPRM1-Gαi2-Src signaling  complex, either directly or indirectly by
  activating other protein kinases,  phosphorylates AC isoforms, such as AC 5/6  (,  ),
  and other signaling  molecules (), eventually  leads to the observed AC activation.
