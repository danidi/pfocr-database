caption: The CD133+ cells show glycolytic phenotype, while the CD133− cells show increased
  mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The distinct metabolic phenotypes of CD133+
  cells and CD133− cells are regulated by miR-122 and its direct target, PDK4. Whereas
  the CD133+ cells show low level of miR-122 which leads to increased expression of
  PDK4, the CD133− cells have high level of miR-122 which leads to reduced expression
  of PDK4. PDK4 is known to suppress mitochondrial OXPHOS through inactivation of
  PDH, leading to preferential use of pyruvate and generation of lactate. Our findings
  in this study demonstrate that MiR-122 mimic inhibits glycolysis and spheroid formation
  by targeting PDK4. Additionally, we show that extracellular glucose and lactic acid
  can alter CD133 expression and stemness characteristics. Thus, glycolytic phenotypes
  regulated by miR-122/PDK4 may play an important role in the stemness characteristic
  of CD133 (+) CSCs. Red arrows indicated active metabolic pathway in specific cell
  types.
