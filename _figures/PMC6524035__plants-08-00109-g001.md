caption: Polyamines derive from amino acid catabolism. In plants, the prevalent biosynthetic
  pathway uses arginine as a precursor for the synthesis of the diamine Put to which
  enzymatic addition of aminopropyl groups (in red) from decarboxylated SAM (dcSAM)
  yield the triamine Spd and subsequently the tetraamines Spm and Tspm. The post-translational
  transfer of the aminobutyl moiety (in blue) from Spd to a conserved lysine of eIF5A
  leads to the modified hypusine residue (Hyp) that renders an active translation
  factor.
