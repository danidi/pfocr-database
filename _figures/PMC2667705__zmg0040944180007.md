caption: 'Regulation of hepatic HNF4α expression by insulin: involvement of SREBPs
  and proposed liver impairments. Hyperinsulinemia commonly found in type 2 diabetes
  leads to increased levels of activated SREBPs in the liver (reviewed in Refs. ,
  , and ), which in turn down-regulate the expression of the HNF4α P1 promoter (this
  study). Lower HNF4α protein results in decreased activation of HNF4α target genes,
  which in concert with increased expression of SREBP target genes, could lead to
  dysregulation of lipid metabolism and eventually to hepatic steatosis (fatty liver),
  a common complication of type 2 diabetes. SREBP proteins also negatively affect
  the function of the hepatic HNF4α protein (,,). Accumulation of lipids in the liver
  can lead to insulin resistance, triggering a feed-forward effect and aggravating
  the disease. See text for additional details and a discussion of the role of other
  factors in the insulin pathway and the effects on carbohydrate metabolism.'
