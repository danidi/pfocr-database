caption: YAP mediated gene expression in liver fibrosis. Simplified scheme showing
  the regulation of profibrotic gene expression by YAP during liver fibrosis and attenuation
  of gene expression by the inhibitor VP. When the Hippo pathway is on, the active
  Hippo core kinase complex phosphorylates YAP on five serine residues leading to
  either the cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP through interaction with 14-3-3 proteins
  or the degradation of YAP by the proteasome. Inactivation of the Hippo core kinase
  complex in response to initial tissue injury or subsequent mechanotransduction abrogates
  YAP phosphorylation, leading to nuclear translocation of YAP, complex formation
  with TEAD transcription factor(s), and upregulation of profibrotic genes, such as
  Ctgf and Ankrd1. In cells treated with the FDA-approved drug VP, which blocks the
  interaction between YAP and TEADs, YAP/TEAD mediated profibrotic gene expression
  is blocked, thus preventing HSC activation and inhibiting or reversing the development
  of fibrosis. The precise mechanism leading to the activation of Hippo pathway activity
  in response to upstream signals during liver fibrosis remains to be determined.
  Potential upstream regulators including cell-cell contact, GPCRs, and integrins
  are shown.
