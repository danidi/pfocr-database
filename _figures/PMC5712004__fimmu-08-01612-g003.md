caption: Model depicting targets of CHOP-dependent apoptosis. During chronic ER stress,
  CHOP activation mediates pro-apoptosis signaling via numerous targets and pathways
  directly or indirectly. CHOP triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through inhibition
  of BCL-2 and upregulation of BIM and PUMA, which regulate BAX–BAK-mediated mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization. This leads to cytochrome c release and caspase
  cascade. CHOP also directly induces the expression of DR5-mediating extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway via FADD and caspase8-mediated cascade. In normal conditions, CHOP-dependent
  ERO1α induction oxidizes PDI to produce ROS that plays a critical role in apoptosis.
  The ERO1α–IP3R–Ca2+–CaMKII pathway, in addition to ROS, can trigger several apoptotic
  pathways, primarily the Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis via PTP. GADD34 is
  a key target of CHOP and ATF4 and combines with PP1 to promote dephosphorylation
  of phospho-eIF2α. This event renews protein translation that promotes apoptosis
  in certain stress settings. Another target is TRB3 that prevent Akt phosphorylation
  in this apoptotic pathway. ATF5, downstream of CHOP, facilitates apoptosis through
  activation of some pro-apoptotic genes, such as NOXA. CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein;
  ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ATF, activating transcription factor; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species; DR5, death receptor 5; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; GADD34, growth
  arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 34; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PDI, protein
  disulfide isomerase; CaMKII, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; TRB3,
