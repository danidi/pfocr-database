caption: Schematic view of the sphingolipid metabolism in S. cerevisiae. Metabolic
  intermediates and complex sphingolipids are shown in bold; genes are indicated in
  gray or red. The genes indicated in red correspond to mutants resistant to DspA/E-mediated
  toxicity. Specific inhibitors of SPT (myriocin), ceramide synthase (Fb1), and IPC
  synthase (AbA) are also indicated. Sphingolipid biosynthesis starts in the endoplasmic
  reticulum with the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA. This step is catalyzed
  by SPT to produce 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS). Two related proteins, Lcb1 and
  Lcb2, heterodimerize to form the active SPT. A third protein, Tsc3, associates with
  the Lcb1/Lcb2 heterodimer and stimulates SPT activity several fold, whereas Orm1p
  and Orm2p proteins act as negative regulators of SPT. 3-Ketodihydrosphingosine is
  immediately reduced to DHS by an NADPH-dependent reaction catalyzed by an enzyme
  encoded by the TSC10 gene. DHS can then be hydroxylated by the Sur2 protein to give
  PHS. DHS and PHS are the yeast LCBs that are amide-linked to a very long chain fatty
  acid by the ceramide synthase to form ceramides. Ceramide synthase activity requires
  either of two redundant genes, LAC1 and LAG1. Ceramides are then modified in the
  Golgi apparatus to form complex sphingolipids. The first modification is the addition
  of myoinositol phosphate to form inositol-phosphoceramide (IPC). This reaction is
  catalyzed by IPC synthase whose activity requires the AUR1 gene. IPC is then mannosylated
  to yield mannose-inositol-phosphoceramide (MIPC), a reaction that requires the CSG1
  and CSG2 genes. The terminal step in sphingolipid biosynthesis is the addition of
  inositol phosphate to MIPC to yield mannose-(inositol-P)2-phosphoceramide (M(IP)2C).
  The genes involved in this last reaction are IPT1 and SKN1. FA, fatty acyl.
