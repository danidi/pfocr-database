caption: The presence of high levels of ROS/NS can lead to downstream activation of
  cell death pathways. The type of cell death that occurs depends on the parts of
  the cell that are damaged. For example, oxidized protein damage can induce ER stress
  and mediate mitochondrial-independent cell death. However, crosstalk with the mitochondria
  can induce apoptosis via release of cytochrome c if suitable stimuli are present.
  DNA damage by ROS/NS can induce a range of signaling pathways, including the upregulation
  of gene expression of the cell surface markers FAS-L and TRAIL. These markers encourage
  cytotoxic immune cells to bind and activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Furthermore,
  communication with mitochondria can lead to apoptotic or necrotic cell death if
  ATP is depleted. Activation of Bax and Bak can cause mitochondrial pore formation
  and opening, resulting in either mitochondrial swelling and necrosis or apoptosis
  via cytochrome c release. This process can be blocked by the anti-apoptotic protein
  BCl-2. The persistence of ROS/NS in diabetes may result in loss of cell mass and
  subsequent decrease in renal function.
