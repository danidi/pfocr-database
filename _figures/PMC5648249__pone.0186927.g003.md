caption: In the monomer model variant (A), Dab1 is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation
  after binding of Reelin to the receptor. The initial phosphorylation of Dab1 initiates
  phosphorylation of SFKs, which results in a positive feedback. Subsequently, p-Dab1
  induces activation of downstream targets, such as Akt. Signaling is negatively regulated
  by degradation of phosphorylated Dab1, which is further increased through the Reelin-dependent
  activation of SFKs. In the complex model (B), clusters of the lipoprotein receptors
  are formed. These bind the adaptor protein Dab1, which is phosphorylated by SFKs.
  As a feed-forward loop, SFKs activated in a p-Dab1/SFK complex can trans-phosphorylate
  other Dab1 proteins bound to the receptor complex. The pathway is regulated by ubiquitination
  and degradation of phosphorylated Dab1.
