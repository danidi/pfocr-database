caption: Schematic representation of relationship between Lgl and Hippo pathway in
  Drosophila. (A) in Lgl+/+ cells, the induction of Hippo pathway is triggered; (B)
  in Lgl-/- cells, the down-regulation of Hippo pathway is occurred. Hpo tends to
  be more basolateral, and dRASSF and dSTRIPAK are mislocalized and colocalized with
  Hpo. The level of the phosphorylated Yki protein is downregulated, and Yki is translocated
  from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
