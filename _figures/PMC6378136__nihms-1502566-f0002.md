caption: Here we present two ways in which retromer has been linked to Parkinson’s
  disease (PD). 1) A mutation in VPS35, the p.D620N mutation, occurs in around 1%
  of familial autosomal inherited PD. Mutated VPS35 causes endosomes to enlarge and
  mislocalize to the nucleus. 2) Alpha-synuclein is normally degraded by lysosomal
  protease cathepsin , a known cargo of the CIMPR receptor involved in retromer-mediated
  trafficking. Precursor cathepsin D is synthesized in the ER and then transported
  to the Golgi, where it binds to cathepsin D. At the endosome, cathepsin D releases
  from CIMPR and is targeted to the lysosome in its mature form, while CIMPR recycles
  back to the Golgi. A dysfunction in the retromer complex causes improper or inefficient
  binding of CIMPR to cathepsin D, thereby reducing the degradation of alpha synuclein
  in the lysosome. This allows for the generation of accumulated alpha synuclein and
  eventual Lewy Body aggregates. B. Retromer-mediated sorting of APP in Alzheimer’s
  disease. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is normally transported to the Golgi and
  ultimately targeted to the plasma membrane via the secretory pathway. Upon cell
  internalization, APP is cleaved sequentially by alpha secretase and gamma secretase
  in the endosome, then trafficked to the Golgi via the retromer and its binding partner,
  SORLA. This is known as the non-amyloidogenic pathway. In amyloidogenic or pathological
  conditions, BACE1, a known retromer cargo recycled between endosome and Golgi, cleaves
  APP at the endosome prior to gamma secretase cleavage. If retromer dysfunction occurs,
  BACE1 and APP are improperly recycled, allowing residual APP to remain in the endosome
  and increasing APP processing via BACE1. This leads to generation of toxic amyloid
  beta fragments (Aβ, AICD) and eventual amyloid plaques.
