caption: Metabolite comparison between mild cognitive impairment subgroups. Boxplots
  highlighting differences between metabolite concentrations in serum when comparing
  two subgroups of participants with a baseline clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive
  impairment (MCI). The first group (blue) remained cognitively stable throughout
  follow-up study visits (stable MCI (sMCI)), whilst the second group (yellow) experienced
  a deterioration in cognition and converted to a clinical diagnosis of AD at follow-up
  (converting MCI (cMCI)). Boxplots are only presented for the metabolites in the
  serotonin and kynurenine pathways that reported significant differences between
  control, MCI and AD participant groups in phases 1 and 2 of the study (Supplementary
  Figs. S and S). No significant differences were observed between the sMCI and cMCI
  groups in this study
