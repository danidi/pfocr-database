caption: HIF and NF-κB crosstalk in RA. In RA, the synovial join is characterised
  by hypoxic and inflammatory regions (in blue and red, respectively). Hypoxia leads
  to the activation of HIF-1α, which is involved in several cellular processes (such
  as apoptosis, vasomotor control, energy metabolism and angiogenesis). Additionally,
  hypoxia leads to the activation of HIF-2α, which is involved in the activation of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines. In RA, inflammation leads to the activation of NF-κB,
  which activates a pro-inflammatory programme, including pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  chemokines, metalloproteases and metabolic proteins. While HIF-1α has been implicated
  in the repression of the NF-κB pathway (), HIF-2α has been shown to increase inflammation
  (). In RA, this crosstalk remains poorly understood. RA, rheumatoid arthritis; HIF,
  hypoxia-inducible factor; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB.
