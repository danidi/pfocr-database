caption: ATM interaction with metabolic signaling pathways. ATM is required for NF-κB
  activation following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) via a mechanism that requires the export of ATM from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
  []. ATM-deficient cells exhibit reduced levels of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor
  (IGF-IR), a defect that is rescued by expression of ATM cDNA [, ]. However, the
  mechanisms linking ATM to IGF-IR expression are unknown. ATM is required for full
  activation of AKT in response to insulin and IR treatment [–, , ], which induces
  AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 and translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)
  through unknown mechanisms. Inhibition of this pathway induces apoptosis in cancer
  cells with high AKT activity []. Increased activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G6PD) is observed in the presence of ATM, which promotes NADPH formation and reduction
  of glutathione []. In response to IR treatment and elevated ROS levels, ATM phosphorylates
  p53 at Ser15 []. ROS-induced p53 phosphorylation either induces apoptosis or reduces
  ROS levels through upregulation of sestrin proteins (which regenerate peroxiredoxins
  [, ]), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)
  []. Mutation of Ser15 in p53 to Ala15 results in elevated ROS levels, leading to
  insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism []. Signaling pathways initiated
  by IR, insulin, and ROS are indicated by black, blue, and red arrows, respectively.
