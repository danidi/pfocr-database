caption: Fumarate/nitrate response regulator network in P. multocida in response to
  enrofloxacin visualized in Pathway Studio. P. multocida sub-MIC ENR response was
  marked by significant changes in fnr response regulated genes. Red nodes are genes
  with increased expression and green nodes are genes with decreased expression. The
  rest of the interacting nodes are shown in gray. These nodes had no significant
  changes in expression or were orthologs from additional gram-negative species in
  the molecular interaction database in Pathway Studio.
