caption: 'Endocytic mechanisms, namely macropinocytosis, phagocytosis and clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis, are depicted on the PM. Following receptor-mediated endocytosis, substrates
  bound to receptors undergo sorting in SEs and receptors are recycled back to the
  PM either directly from nascent endosomes or via the ERC, whereas nascent phagosomes
  and macropinosomes fuse with SEs and undergo a similar sorting process (indicated
  by an asterisk). SEs as well as intermediate phagosomes / macropinosomes containing
  sorted cargo (IPs and IMs, respectively) mature and adopt a multivesicular morphology
  (MVBs) where an additional sorting process takes place. Substrates in MVBs eventually
  reach LEs, which receive enzymes and membrane proteins from the TGN via vesicular
  trafficking, and the LY. Most degradation occurs in these acidic compartments. In
  contrast, IPs and IMs acquire enzymatic cargo by fusion with LEs and LYs, giving
  rise to phagolysosomes and macropinolysosomes. APP cellular trafficking: Surface
  APP is cleaved by α-secretase followed by extracellular release of the αAPP fragment.
  However, an important fraction of APP is incorporated into the endocytic pathway
  by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and processed mainly in SEs and the ERC by BACE1
  and γ-secretase, leading to secretion of AICD to the cytosol and Aβ to the lumen
  of the compartments. Trafficking routes are indicated by black arrows. Fusion events
  are indicated by pink arrows. Abbreviations: PM, plasma membrane. SE, sorting endosome.
  ERC, endocytic recycling compartment. IP, intermediate phagosome. IM, intermediate
  macropinosome. MVB, multivesicular body. TGN, trans-Golgi network. LE, late endosome.
  LY, lysosome. PLY, phagolysosome. MLY, macropinolysosome. SRA, scavenger receptor
  class A. APP, amyloid precursor protein. αAPPs, soluble APP N-terminal fragment
  from α-secretase cleavage. βAPPs, soluble APP N-terminal fragment from β-secretase
