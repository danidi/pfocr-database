caption: . Antioxidant mechanism of GSH and Cys. Most cells cannot directly take up
  extracellular GSH and GSSG (oxidized form of GSH), mainly coming from liver via
  the methionine (Met)-relevant trans-sulfuration pathway other than diet. GSH and
  GSSG are cleaved extracellularly by γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and dipeptidases
  (DPs) to form Cys and Cys2 (oxidized form of Cys). Cys is unstable and easily auto-oxidized
  to Cys2. Cys and Cys2 can be taken up by cells via ACS transporter and system xc–,
  respectively, and the latter dominates for most of the cells. Once inside the cell,
  Cys2 is reduced by Txnrd1 to Cys that protects cells from lipid peroxidation by
  removing ROS. Intracellular GSH is synthesized from its precursor amino acids catalyzed
  by glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCL) and GSH synthetase (GS). GSH protects cells from
  oxidative damage by removing ROS, and the resulting GSSG can be reduced to GSH by
  GSH reductase (GR). Both GSH and GSSG can be exported out of cells by the multidrug
  resistance protein (Mrp) transporter.
