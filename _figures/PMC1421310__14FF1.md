caption: Figure 1. The transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)/DPC4 pathway. TGFβ binds
  to its cell surface receptor, a serine threonine kinase, which then phosphorylates
  Smads 1 to 3. Once phosphorylated, Smad2 and Smad3 form heteromeric complexes with
  DPC4, which are translocated to the nucleus. There the complex binds the Smad-binding
  element (SBE) and acts as a transcription factor.
