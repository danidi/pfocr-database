caption: 'The EPO-immunity regulatory network affects host–pathogen interaction: Microbes
  induce host response pathways for example via activation of Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs), thereby leading to stimulation of the NF-κB pathway and subsequent transcription
  of genes such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase
  (iNOS) resulting in formation of the toxic radical NO, needed for effective anti-microbial
  immune responses. In contrast, after binding to its specific cell surface receptor,
  EPO inhibits these pro-inflammatory immune effector pathways. Thus, to ensure an
  effective pro-inflammatory immune response during infection, immune-derived molecules
  such as TNF-α and NO reduce the anti-inflammatory activity of EPO by down-regulating
  expression of its cell surface receptor (EPOR) and by directly inhibiting EPO formation
  in the kidney. As a consequence, anemia develops which is due to reduced EPO availability
  and retention of iron within macrophages mostly based on the action of the acute
  phase protein hepcidin, whose expression is negatively controlled by EPO. Thus,
  by these pathways, the availability of oxygen and iron for rapidly growing tissues
  and/or extracellular microbes is reduced which may be part of the innate immune
  response, although the access of intracellular pathogens to iron may be contrastingly
  affected. Oppositely, anemia and hypoxia stimulate EPO formation via activation
  of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in the kidney but maybe also in other cells including
  macrophages. EPO down-regulates the pro-inflammatory immune response, thereby also
  reducing the anti-proliferative effects of this cytokine on erythroid progenitor
  cells. Furthermore, EPO inhibits hepcidin formation, thus enabling mobilization
  of iron from macrophage stores for erythropoietic use. These events lead to down-scaling
  of inflammation and correction of anemia after the infection has been cleared by
  anti-microbial effector pathways. Green arrows indicate stimulatory pathways, red
  arrows indicate inhibitory pathways. (For interpretation of the references to colour
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)'
