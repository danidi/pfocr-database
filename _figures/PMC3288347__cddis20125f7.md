caption: 'Chronic JNK signaling dominates over AKT signaling and overrides the inhibitory
  effect of AKT on FOXO3a for the transcription of its effectors, BNIP3 and MurF-1
  in POH and in heart failure. JNK and AKT signaling are activated in response to
  pressure overload. However, despite the increase in AKT activity, BNIP3 expression
  increased significantly in POH and peaked in HF. On the other hand, the decrease
  in JNK activity by Ad-DN-JNK and 3 MA in vivo decreased AKT activity and decreased
  the expression of FOXO3a effectors, BNIP3 and MurF-1. In other words, the expression
  of FOXO3a effectors, BNIP3 and MurF-1, are directly related to JNK activity and
  that the chronic activation of JNK dominates over AKT signaling for the activation
  of FOXO3a and for the transcription of its effectors, BNIP3 and MurF-1. Moreover,
  the increase in JNK activity phosphorylates Bcl-2 and increases Bax to Bcl-2 ratio,
  further promoting mitochondria-induced apoptosis. Green arrows: promote signaling
  pathway, Red arrows: inhibit signaling pathway'
