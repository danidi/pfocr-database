caption: Model whereby increased Fgfr3 signaling in chondrocytes causes premature
  synchondrosis closure and unification of ossification centers. Increased Fgfr3 signaling
  induces premature exit from the cell cycle and accelerates the transition into hypertrophic
  chondrocytes. Increased Fgfr3 signaling also causes upregulation of Vegf in chondrocytes,
  promoting vascular invasion. Increased secretion of Bmp ligands and decreased secretion
  of Bmp antagonists result in enhanced osteoblast differentiation of osteoprogenitors
  in the periosteum, promoting bone formation and fusion of ossification centers.
  The upregulation of Vegf and Bmps and downregulation of Bmp antagonists are at least
  partially mediated by the MAPK pathway.
