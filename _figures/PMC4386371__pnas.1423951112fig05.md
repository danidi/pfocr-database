caption: Model for the role of specific acyl-CoA oxidase homo- and heterodimers in
  the biosynthetic pathway of (ω-1)-ascarosides (A) and ω-ascarosides (B). Dauer pheromone
  ascarosides are boxed. Dotted arrows and enzymes that appear in gray indicate hypothetical
  steps and activities that have not yet been verified experimentally.
