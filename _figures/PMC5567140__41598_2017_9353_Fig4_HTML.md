caption: NCL expression affects cholesterol synthesis. (A) The different enzymes of
  the cholesterol biosynthetic pathways that are down regulated in the NCL siRNA treated
  cells are indicated in red on the scheme of the cholesterol synthesis pathway. (B)
  Western blot to detect nucleolin and β actin in cells transfected either with control
  siRNA or siRNA targeting nucleolin. Total extracts were used and loaded onto a 10%
  SDS-PAGE. (C) Cholesterol dosage from untransfected (UT), control siRNA or nucleolin
  siRNA treated cells. Assays were performed in triplicates for each condition, and
  samples were processed as recommended by the manufacturer. Results were expressed
  compared to untransfected cells.
