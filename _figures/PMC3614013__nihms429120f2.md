caption: AMP biosynthesis occurs though two distinct pathways, de novo and salvage.
  Adenylosuccinate Synthetase (AdSS) catalyzes the first committed step in de novo
  AMP biosynthesis followed by the action of Adenylosuccinate Lyase (AdSL). AMP Deaminase
  (AMP deam) is the reverse of these two reactions, converting adenosine monophosphate
  (AMP) into inosine monophosphate (IMP). The salvage pathway converts adenine, via
  Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt), or adenosine, via Adenosine Kinase (AdenoK),
  to AMP. Adenylate Kinase (Adk) also produces AMP from ADP substrate molecules. Prior
  to committed AMP biosynthesis, AdSL and Aminoimidazolecarboxamide Formyltransferase
  (AICAR-ft) sequentially catalyze the final reactions of IMP synthesis. IMP is a
  substrate for the synthesis of both AMP and guanosine monophosphate (GMP).
