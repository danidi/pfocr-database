caption: 'Animal cells synthesize a wide assortment of glycoproteins in which different
  amino acids may be modified to contain specific glycan structures. Biosynthesis
  of such glycoproteins is initiated in the secretory pathway comprising the endoplasmic
  reticulum and Golgi apparatus of cells and can lead to membrane localization and
  secretion of glycoproteins. In addition, O-GlcNAc may be added to glycoproteins
  in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria. This single GlcNAc residue is not extended
  but can be reversibly added and removed. The multiple other types of glycan linkages
  to proteins can be extended (R groups indicated) with many additional sugar molecules
  to form oligosaccharides or polysaccharides, all termed glycans. The 10 common monosaccharides
  that make up animal glycans are indicated: N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), N-acetylgalactosamine
  (GalNAc), 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, or sialic acid), fucose (Fuc), galactose
  (Gal), glucose (Glc), glucuronic acid (GlcA); iduronic acid (IdoA); mannose (Man),
  and xylose (Xyl). 5-N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), a non-natural sugar, is
  also shown. Other abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol;
  HyL, hydroxylated lysine.'
