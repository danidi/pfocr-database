caption: Schematic diagram of the potential interaction between vascular MR and cav-1
  during low NO–high AngII–induced cardiovascular injury. Increased circulating AngII
  is known to increase salt and water retention either directly via renal tubular
  AT1R or indirectly by stimulating ALDO secretion. AngII also stimulates vascular
  AT1R to induce vasoconstriction, whereas low NO (by L-NAME) causes further vasoconstriction
  and vascular injury. In cav-1 replete states (WT), cav-1 anchors eNOS, thus limiting
  its translocation and phosphoactivation. MR colocalizes with cav-1 in endothelial
  cells, and L-NAME + AngII–induced cardiovascular injury may trigger compensatory
  MR-mediated genomic changes in the amount of eNOS mRNA/protein and nongenomic increases
  in eNOS phosphorylation/activity and thereby the NO-cGMP vascular relaxation pathway.
  Thus, during L-NAME + AngII treatment in cav-1 replete states, MR blockade with
  EPL would prevent the compensatory MR-mediated NO-cGMP relaxation pathway and consequently
  increase vascular contraction. In cav-1 deficiency states (knockout), eNOS is maximally
  activated, leading to loss of L-NAME + AngII–induced compensatory MR-mediated vasodilator
  effects, and, in turn, a lack of vascular effects of EPL.
