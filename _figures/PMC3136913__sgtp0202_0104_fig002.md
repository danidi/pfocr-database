caption: Targeting of eEF1A1 is a novel mechanism in TGFβ signaling. Canonical TGFβ
  signaling pathway involves activation of Smad2 and Smad3 proteins (Smad pathway).
  There are numbers of TGFβ signaling pathways that do not involve direct activation
  of Smads (non-Smad pathway). These non-Smad pathways include MAPK, Rho-like GTPase
  and PI3K/Akt, as examples. Activation of Smad and non-Smad signaling cascade ultimately
  leads to the transcription activation of target genes. Recently, our study uncovered
  that eEF1A1 is phosphorylated by type I TGFβ receptor kinase, which leads to the
  direct regulation of protein synthesis, without involvement of transcriptional regulation.
