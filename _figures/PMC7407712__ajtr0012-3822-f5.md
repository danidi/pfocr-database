caption: Hcy promotes IP3R1 up-regulation, enhances Nav1.5 activity, and elevates
  INaL and ICaL under Hcy stimulation, but Nav1.5 decreases the level of phosphorylated
  IP3R1. This decreases the contribution of RyR2 to Ca2+ leakage from the SR, as a
  compensatory mechanism. Ca2+ influx leads to the APDs prolongation associated with
  AF pathology. The specific mechanisms of AF require further investigation.
