caption: Mechanisms underlying the late-phase of CF elimination. The late-phase is
  dependent on heterosynaptic interactions between CF and PF synapses and between
  CF and BC synapses. (1) Neural activity along the MF-GC-PF pathway activates mGluR1
  and downstream signaling cascades at PF-PC spines. (2) Stabilization of PF-PC synapses
  on spines of distal dendrites of PCs restrict the innervation sites of CFs to proximal
  dendrites. (3) BC terminals on the PC soma suppress the Ca2+ influx through activation
  of VDCCs. (4) BDNF-TrkB signaling might promote the maturation of GABAergic neurons
  and/or regression or maintenance of CF synapses. Modified from Kano et al. []
