caption: Three important pathways converge on PI3K signaling, including the B cell
  receptor (BCR), thought to be the dominant pathway in CLL, as well as receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) and cytokine/chemokine receptors. The BCR usually becomes activated
  in the presence of antigen (though tonic signaling has also been described). Activated
  BCR recruits other kinases such as spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and LYN kinase,
  which phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the
  cytoplasmic Ig domains of the receptor. RTKs can be stimulated by a variety of ligands,
  and also lead to autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residue on the ITAM. Stimulated
  cytokine and chemokine receptors can activate janus-activated kinase (JAK) tyrosine
  kinases, which phosphorylate tyrosine residues in proteins such as gp130 and IRS
  family members. These tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins interact with SH2 domains
  of the p85 subunit of PI3K, thereby activating the p110 kinase activity which is
  normally inhibited in the p85-p110 complex. This activation results in the conversion
  of PIP2 to PIP3, which has several downstream effects, many of which are mediated
  by AKT. The net result of PI3K activation is to promote CLL cell survival and proliferation,
  largely through activation of nuclear transcription factors such as NF-KB, NFAT,
  and SRF. These effects can be modulated by nearby stromal cells including T cells,
  nurse-like cells (NLC), and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC).
