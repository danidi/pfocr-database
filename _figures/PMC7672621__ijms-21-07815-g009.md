caption: Schematic regulatory pathway of linagliptin in OSI-906-induced hepatic steatosis.
  Linagliptin improved hepatic steatosis induced by acute IR/IGF1R signaling inhibition
  with OSI-906 through an insulin signaling-independent pathway. Pathways involving
  perilipin-2 and NNMT have been proposed as possible mechanisms for the amelioration
  of OSI-906-induced hepatic steatosis by linagliptin.
