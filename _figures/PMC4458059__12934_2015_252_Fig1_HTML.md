caption: 'Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and degradation pathways in S. cerevisiae.
  The native aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and degradation pathways are indicated
  with solid black arrows. Overexpression of the non-native or engineered enzymes
  is indicated using blue font, including tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) from R. sphaeroides
  [] and the NAD+-dependent prephenate dehydrogenase (TyrC) from Z. mobilis, the feedback-resistant
  DAHP synthase Aro4K229L, and the feedback-resistant chorismate mutase Aro7G141S.
  Native genes that are overexpressed in this study are shown using a green font,
  while knockout of the first step in the aromatic amino acid degradation pathway,
  Aro10, is indicated by a ‘prohibited’ symbol. Dotted lines indicate allosteric inhibition
  by phenylalanine of Aro3 and by tyrosine of Aro4 and Aro7. Boxed metabolites were
  measured in this study. Metabolite abbreviations: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; E4P,
