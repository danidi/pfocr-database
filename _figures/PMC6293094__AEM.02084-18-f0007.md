caption: Quantitative metabolic flux analysis of P. protegens Pf-5 using metabolite
  labeling data following growth on [U-13C6]glucose and unlabeled glucose (white)
  or [U-13C6]glucose and unlabeled fructose (green). All fluxes were normalized to
  100% glucose uptake, and the thickness of each arrow was scaled to the relative
  flux percentage for the glucose-only growth condition. Red arrows indicate contribution
  to biomass and blue arrows indicate excretion fluxes. The metabolite abbreviations
  are as listed in the legends for  and . The absolute fluxes (mean ± standard deviation),
  which were obtained by modeling experimental labeling data from three biological
  replicates, are listed in Tables S5 and S7.
