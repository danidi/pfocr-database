caption: Pathway of eukaryotic translation initiation. In the first step of initiation
  (step 1), a mRNA is recruited to the 40S subunit. The eIF4F complex (eIF4E, eIF4A,
  and eIF4G) specifically binds to the m7G cap structure located on the 5′ end of
  the mRNA. Although not shown, an interaction between PABP, the poly(A) tail and
  eIF4F can also occur. The eIF4F bound mRNA is recruited to the 43S PIC by virtue
  of numerous interactions between initiation components described in the text. In
  the second step of initiation (step 2), the 40S subunit scans along the 5′ UTR in
  a 5′ to 3′ direction. Codons are continuously sampled by the initiator tRNA anticodon
  until one is selected (shown here as an AUG). In the final step of initiation (step
  3), two GTP hydrolysis steps occur, resulting in the recruitment of the 60S subunit
  and initiation factor release. The newly formed 80S ribosome then enters the elongation
  cycle.
