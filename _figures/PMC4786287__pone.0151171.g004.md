caption: Levels of metabolites from glycolysis and the sorbitol pathway were analyzed
  in whole ACP KD and MECR OX cells and their respective controls using metabolomics,
  which included UHLC/MS/MS and GC/MS, as described in Experimental Procedures. Glycolysis
  intermediates that were identified are indicated with arrows and a corresponding
  box plot. Y-axes for box plots indicate scaled intensity, except where indicated
  otherwise. Direction of metabolite level change compared to control in ACP KD cells
  is indicated by gray arrows, and direction of metabolite level change relative to
  control in MECR OX cells is indicated by blue arrows. In box plots, metabolite levels
  are shown for ACP KD cells, MECR OX cells, and their respective controls. For each
  box, n = 6, and open circles indicate extreme data points.
