caption: Smoke mediates EGFR/Src-dependent and independent cell migration. In the
  normal human airway, adherens junctions (p120ctn, β-ctn and E-cad) are intact on
  the epithelial cell membrane. Smoke induces rapid activation of membrane Src through
  EGFR. Src activation promotes cell migration through suppression of Cof-P. When
  airway epithelial cells express p120ctn, EGFR and Src specific inhibitors (as those
  used in chemotherapy) help to stabilize p120ctn on the membrane where it functions
  as a tumor suppressor. In the advanced stages of lung cancer, p120ctn is translocated
  into the cytoplasm by smoke where it is degraded or modified. Membrane loss of p120ctn
  results in disruption of adherens junctions and decreased cell–cell adhesion. Src
  continues to be activated through EGFR but EGFR and Src inhibitors fail to block
  cell migration because loss of tumor-suppressing membrane p120ctn, activates an
  alternative EGFR/Src-independent pathway (denoted with a dotted-line). Cell migration
  continues via this alternative pathway in the absence of p120ctn, bypassing traditional
  EGFR/Src signaling and thus providing a potential mechanism of chemotherapeutic
  resistance.
