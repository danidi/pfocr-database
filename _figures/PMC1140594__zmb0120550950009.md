caption: Proposed model for the major degradation pathways of F508del- and wt CFTR.
  (i) Synthesis of CFTR occurs with its concomitant insertion in the ER membrane and
  attachment of an Hsc70/Hdj-2 (or Hsp70/Hdj-1) pair to nascent cytosolic domains,
  as described previously (, ). Other authors have described increased levels of Hsc70/Hdj-2
  complexes with F508del-CFTR relative to wt CFTR and expression of NBD1 as the earliest
  point at which Hsc70/Hdj-2 could bind the nascent CFTR polypeptidic chain (). The
  same study reported that complex formation between Hdj-2 and nascent wt CFTR was
  greatly reduced after expression of the R domain, suggesting NBD1-R domain interaction
  as a critical point in CFTR folding. The cell thus seems to use this Hsc70/Hsp70
  control as the first checkpoint to assess CFTR conformation, and we propose that
  it is the major mechanism to discard F508del-CFTR. Prolonged retention of unfolded
  F508del-CFTR by Hsc70 at this point enables CHIP to interact with Hsc70/Hsp70 (probably
  by displacing Hdj-2) and causes the mutant to be degraded through the Hsc70-CHIP-UbcH5a
  pathway (, ). The E2 Ubc6 may also contribute to F508del-CFTR ERAD (). Contrary
  to what happens with F508del-CFTR, wt CFTR, for which NBD1-R intramolecular interaction
  and folding is achieved, proceeds in the folding pathway through interaction of
  its N-glycosyl residues (ii) with calnexin (iii). Wt CFTR acquires its native conformation
  through successive rounds of release-deglucosylation (iv) and rebinding-reglucosylation
  (v) to calnexin, which also constitutes the second ERQC checkpoint. Upon successful
  folding, CFTR exits the ER, proceeding through the secretory pathway (vi). However,
  prolonged presence in the calnexin cycle may cause misfolded CFTR to become a substrate
  of mannosidase I (vii). This enzyme trims mannose residues from the protein glycan
  moiety, possibly generating the Man8B glycan intermediate that is recognized by
  EDEM, which targets the client protein to ERAD (viii). We call this ER-degradative
  pathway GERAD, to indicate its dependence on the glycan moiety. According to this
  model, F508del-CFTR follows a major degradative pathway from the first (Hsc70-dependent)
  ERQC checkpoint, whereas misfolded wt CFTR undergoes proteolytic GERAD at the second
  (calnexin-dependent) one (see the text for a description).
