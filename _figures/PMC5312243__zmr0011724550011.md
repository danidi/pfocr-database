caption: Proposed alternative heme biosynthetic pathway. Initially, it was thought
  that the alternative heme pathway involved the decarboxylation of precorrin-2 to
  give a didecarboxy compound, which then underwent a loss of the acetic acid side
  chains on rings A and B to give coproporphyrinogen III. The latter could then be
  converted into heme via the classic pathway.
