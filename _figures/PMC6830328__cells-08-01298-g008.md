caption: The proposed model of miR-29a exerting a protective effect by targeting CD36
  and modulating downstream signaling pathway in HFD-elicited liver fibrosis. HFD
  causes considerable fatty acid influx into the liver, leading to the up-regulation
  of PPARγ, TFAM, and mtDNA content. MtDNA and mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen
  species can initiate an inflammatory response, leading to the release of such pro-inflammatory
  cytokines as MCP-1 and IL-6. Chronic inflammation is a stimulator for EMT, which
  is characterized by the up-regulation of typical makers like snail and vimentin.
  Activation of EMT facilitates the transformation of hepatic stellate cells to myofibroblasts,
  contributing to the progression of liver fibrosis. Of particular note, miR-29a can
  exert an anti-NAFLD effect by targeting CD36 3’UTR and repressing its expression,
  which may decrease intracellular fatty acid influx, subsequently reducing the up-regulation
  of PPARγ, TFAM, and mtDNA content, modulating downstream inflammatory response and
  EMT, and ultimately mitigating liver fibrosis.
