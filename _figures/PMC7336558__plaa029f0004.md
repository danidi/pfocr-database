caption: 'Interactions between root defence responses upon root and leaf herbivory.
  Schematic illustration of induced defences in tomato roots including the phytohormones
  jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), the glycoalkaloid
  α-tomatine and defence genes (Lipoxygenase D (LoxD), Leucine aminopeptidase A (LapA),
  Le4 abscisic acid-responsive, Basic-β-1-glucanase (GluB)) and glycoalkaloid metabolism
  (GAME) genes (jasmonate-responsive ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 4 transcription factor
  (JRE4) and GLYCOALKLOID METABOLISM 1 (GAME1)). The top panel represents phytohormones
  and gene expression induced in tomato roots by the caterpillar Spodoptera exigua
  on plants of different ages (4.8, 6.2 and 8 weeks). The bottom panel represents
  phytohormones and gene expression induced in tomato roots by the root-knot nematode
  (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita at different root infection cycle stages (invasion stage
  estimated at 5 days post-nematode inoculation (dpi), galling stage estimated at
  15 dpi and reproduction stage estimated at 30 dpi). The middle panel shows the effect
  of S. exigua leaf feeding on root responses induced by M. incognita (MiSe) compared
  to those infected with M. incognita (Mi) alone at 30 dpi (hormonal cross-talk).
  White boxes: no response, yellow boxes: increase in trait levels or upregulation
  of gene expression, blue boxes: decrease in traits levels or downregulation of gene
  expression and green box: hypothetical involvement. In the proposed hormonal cross-talk
  schedule in the middle, dotted red lines show negative cross-talk, the black arrows
  show the steps in the JA pathway and the dashed black arrows represents several
  unknown steps. In our cross-talk model, we propose that the increase in SA affects
  the JA pathway negatively at the level of the MYC transcription factor. At the same
  time, the increase in ABA levels blocks the ethylene (ET) pathway, which regulates
  the ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (ERF) branch of the JA pathway. We hypothesize that
  the absence of ET promotes the activity of the JRE4 transcription factor, which
  enhances transcription of the GAME pathway. Based on the response of the defence
  marker gene LapA in MiSe plants at 30 dpi, we also hypothesize that this pathway
  leading to late JA responses is involved in the interaction.'
