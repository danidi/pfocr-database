caption: Graphical representation of the mechanism of the epidermal growth factor
  receptor. Under normal conditions, the downstream steps of the pathway are only
  activated when binding of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand leads to phosphorylation
  of the kinase domains. With certain epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations,
  cellular proliferation and survival occur even in the absence of the EGF ligand
  due to autocatalytic activity of the mutated kinases. Several drugs have been developed
  which inhibit the mutated kinases and improve clinical outcome.
