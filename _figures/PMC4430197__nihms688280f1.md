  description: Schematic representation of the molecular pathophysiologic mechanisms
    of priapism; normal penile erection physiology depicted in inset (bottom right).
    A constellation of molecular factors promote uncontrolled erection (priapism)
    by interfering with the normal regulatory control mechanisms involved in the return
    of the penis back to its flaccid state. Circular arrows represent pathway between
    penile erection states. Horizontal black arrows represent mediation. Horizontal
    black T-shapes represent inhibition. Broken arrows represent both direct and indirect
    downstream effects of signaling pathways. Upward black arrows represent upregulation.
    Downward black arrows represent downregulation. NO/cGMP = nitric oxide/ cyclic
