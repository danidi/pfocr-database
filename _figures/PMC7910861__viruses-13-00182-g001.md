caption: Evasion of RLR-mediated innate immunity through viral manipulation of ubiquitination
  and ISGylation. Schematic of the signaling pathway triggered by the innate immune
  sensors RIG-I and MDA5 upon recognition of host or viral immunostimulatory RNA.
  Activation of this pathway culminates with the interaction of RLRs with the shared
  adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) at the mitochondrion
  via specific 14-3-3 chaperone proteins (14-3-3ε and 14-3-3η). MAVS recruits the
  inhibitor of nuclear factor κB kinase (IKK)-related serine/threonine kinases TBK1
  and IKKε, which phosphorylate and activate IRF3/7 (among other signaling mediators);
  these transcription factors then translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to
  induce the gene expression of type I and type III IFNs, proinflammatory cytokines,
  and chemokines. RLRs also induce the NF-κB signaling program via IKKα/β/γ activation.
  The RLR-mediated antiviral response is tightly controlled by several reversible
  post-translational modifications (PTMs) including ubiquitination and ISGylation,
  which serve as “on/off” switches for signaling. E3 ligases such as TRIM25 and Riplet
  modify RIG-I with covalent K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which promotes RIG-I oligomerization
  and activation. However, viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms to antagonize
  RIG-I ubiquitination, which ultimately suppresses cytokine induction and blunts
  the antiviral response. The K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I is directly inhibited
  by numerous viral proteins such as CCHFV L (OTU), FMDV Lpro, KSHV ORF64, WNV NS1,
  SVV 3Cpro, HBV HBx, HEV MetT-PCP, and the papain-like proteases (PLPs) from HCoV-NL63,
  PEDV, and SARS-CoV. Viral proteins such as IAV NS1, RSV NS1, NiV V, HCV NS3/4A,
  and SFTSV NSs target TRIM25 and/or Riplet to blunt the K63-linked ubiquitination
  of RIG-I. EBV BPLF acts as a viral deconjugase to inhibit 14-3-3 and to sequester
  TRIM25 into aggregates. EV71 3Cpro downregulates miR-526, which targets the DUB
  enzyme CYLD, while RGNNV infection upregulates miR-202-5p, which blocks the TRIM25
  function. The sfRNA from an epidemic strain of DENV interacts with TRIM25 and impedes
  its deubiquitination and stabilization by USP15, a cellular DUB. The E6 oncoproteins
  of several HPVs (both low-risk and high-risk) form a complex with TRIM25 and USP15,
  which ultimately prevents the K63-linked ubiquitination of the RIG-I CARDs. TOSV
  NSs induces K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, promoting its destruction by the
  proteasome. USP27X is a negative regulator of IFN-β induction, and upon SeV infection,
  it removes K63-linked ubiquitination from both RIG-I and MDA5. MDA5 is modified
  by ISGylation at the CARDs (at K23 and K43), which promotes MDA5 oligomerization
  and activation; however, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro physically interacts with MDA5 and inhibits
  its CARD ISGylation, suppressing MDA5-mediated antiviral immunity.
