caption: 'Role of macrophages in hepatitis C virus infection-associated inflammation.
  During hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, macrophages are the main source of the
  proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,
  and IL-6] and the anti-inflammatory IL-10. The production of IL-1β and IL-18 requires
  two signals, which are initiated by the uptake of intact HCV particles. Signal 1:
  Following dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin-mediated
  endocytosis, the HCV genome is released into cytoplasm and the uridine-rich HCV
  RNA is recognized by endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7). This recognition leads
  to pro-IL-1β and IL-18 production in a myeloid differentiation primary response
  gene 88 and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB)-dependent manner. Signal 2: Pro IL-1β and IL-18
  become activated in this pathway. HCV p7, an ion channel protein, promotes potassium
  efflux that activates the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor
  family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Utilizing apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing a CARD as an adaptor protein, NLRP3 activates caspase-1,
  which induces the maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms.
  HCV core and NS3 proteins interact with TLR1 or TLR6 and TLR2 to activate NFκB,
  which results in the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10. Additionally, HCV particles
  can also be recognized by TLR7/8, inducing TNF-α production. TLR tolerance is a
  protection mechanism against uncontrolled inflammation. In HCV infection, it can
  be abrogated by interferon-γ through NF-κB signaling, leading to the production
  of high levels of proinflammatory cytokines. HCV: Hepatitis C virus; HCVc: HCV core
