caption: 'Various signaling pathways promoting or inhibiting inflammatory signaling
  (green arrows represent activation, and red arrows represent inhibition). Jun N-terminal
  kinase-1 (JNK1) and inhibitor of kB kinase (IKKβ) are inflammatory signaling pathways
  which promote insulin resistance. Activation of either pathway leads to serine phosphorylation
  of insulin receptor substrate protein-1 (IRS-1), causing attenuation of insulin
  action. IKKβ also phosphorylates inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκB) which essentially
  frees nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), allowing it to translocate to the nucleus, bind
  to DNA, and activate inflammatory mediators. JNK1 can also stimulate transcription
  of inflammatory genes in association with transcription factor activator protein
  1 (AP1). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation, which normally binds lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS) and saturated fatty acids (FA), results in activation of JNK and IKKβ. Endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress, stimulated by FA, nutrient excess, and microhypoxia, leads
  to the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR comprises three main pathways: inositol-requiring
  enzyme (IRE)-1, protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription
  factor (ATF)α which all lead to activation of JNK1 and IKKβ. Hypoxia also activates
  the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which induces expression
  of various target genes. Conversely, insulin sensitivity is promoted by activation
  of the omega-3 fatty acid receptor (GRP120) which inhibits JNK1 and IKKβ. PPARγ
  also promotes insulin sensitivity by interfering with the NF-κB and AP1 signaling
  pathways and subsequent expression of inflammatory genes.'
