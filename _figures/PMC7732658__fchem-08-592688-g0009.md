caption: eNOS uncoupling and Dysregulation of EC metabolism. BH4, NADPH, and CoQ10
  are essential cofactors for eNOS coupling and synthesis of nitric oxide (NO). With
  the reduction in the levels of arginine and/or folate, BH4 may result in eNOS uncoupling,
  which in turn results in ROS formation by eNOS (instead of NO). This eventually
  leads to disruption of EC metabolism. Reduction in arginine reduces formation of
  citrulline, which results in electron that is released from NADPH to be transferred
  to O2 molecules resulting in superoxide () formation. Furthermore, asymmetric dimethylarginine
  (ADMA) causes a reduction in eNOS activity by competing with arginine for eNOS binding.
  ADMA synthesis from methylation of L-arginine by methyldonor S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) in the one-carbon metabolism is shown (in green). RhoA also plays a role in
  eNOS inhibition by degrading eNOS mRNA transcripts. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  (GGPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) from the mevalonate pathway (in yellow)
  are needed for RhoA prenylation. HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A; HMGR,
