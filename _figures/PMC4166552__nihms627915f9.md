caption: Model of cooperation of PLCB3 in the P.aeruginosa-dependent signaling in
  bronchial epithelial cells. The cartoon depicts the signaling pathways elicited
  by TLRs/MyD88 (A) and P2Y2R/PLCB3 (B), based on previous reports from other investigators
  and the results presented here. A, Binding of P.aeruginosa surface components (flagellin,
  pilin) with TLR5 and TLR2 triggers a MyD88-dependent proinflammatory signaling cascade,
  eventually leading to nuclear translocation of NF-kB, which is a critical transcription
  factor for the expression of IL-8 gene, together with AP-1 and CHOP. TLRs/MyD88
  pathway is sufficient to promote transcription of IL-8 gene. Besides exerting this
  direct effect, P.aeruginosa induces the extra cellular release of ATP, possibly
  via a cooperative interaction of TLR5, TLR2 and ASGM1R. B, Extra cellular ATP binds
  to P2Y2R that activates PLCB3 through the Gaq,11 heterotrimeric GTPase protein.
  By degrading PIP2, PLCB3 promotes IP3 release and DAG formation. IP3 triggers Ca2+
  release from intracellular stores and rise of [Ca2+]c, together with DAG, promotes
  intracellular translocation of conventional PKC isoforms alpha and beta, which ultimately
  cooperate in activation of NF-kB. The P2Y2R/PLCB3 pathway is not sufficient to induce
  IL-8 transcription by itself but strongly act in synergy with the TLR/MyD88 signaling
  cascade.
