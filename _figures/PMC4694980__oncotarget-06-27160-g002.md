caption: Graph represents functional interactomes constructed with Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis tool using lineage specific (B16-MDSCs vs DCs) differentially expressed
  proteins, which shows detailed interaction relationships between the input nodes
  (differentially expressed proteins between MDSCs and DCs), and regulatory kinases
  encircled in blue. This interactome links AKT/SRC kinases with mitochondrial respiration
  and dysfunction, protection against oxidative stress and extracellular matrix remodeling.
  Nodes in red, up-regulated proteins. Nodes in green, down-modulated proteins. In
  white, predicted protein nodes. A, activation; B, binding; C, causes/leads to; CC,
  chemical-chemical interaction; CP, chemical-protein interaction; E, expression;
  EC, enzyme catalysis; I, inhibition; L, proteolysis; LO, localization; M, biochemical
  modification; MB, group/complex; P, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation; PD Protein-DNA
  binding; PP Protein-Protein binding; PR Protein-RNA binding; RB Regulation of Binding;
  RE Reaction; RR RNA-RNA Binding; T Transcription; TR Translocation. Dash arrows,
  indirect interactions.
