caption: Putative regulatory pathway of Rb-ME mediated antiphotoaging events. UVB-triggered
  increases in COX-2 and MMP-9 expression, degradation of collagen, and cellular senescence
  were suppressed by Rb-ME treatment through suppression of the p38/AP-1 pathway.
  Moisturizing factor expression under normal culture conditions was also elevated
  by treatment of Rb-ME.
