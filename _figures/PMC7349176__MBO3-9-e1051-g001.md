caption: Schematic diagram summarizing metabolic engineering strategies for fatty
  acid ethyl esters (FAEE) production in engineered Yarrowia lipolytica using monoculture
  and coculture cultivation. The reconstructed biosynthesis pathway for endogenous
  ethanol production was constructed in Y. lipolytica Po1g via co‐overexpression of
  two heterologous enzymes pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1p) and alcohol dehydrogenase
  (Adh1p) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C, one native glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Y. lipolytica Po1g for NADH regeneration. Wax ester synthases
  from Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8 (MaWS1) and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus DSM
  8798 (MhWS) were then introduced into Y. lipolytica, respectively, for FAEE production
  in the monoculture of Y. lipolytica. Homologous and heterologous enzymes are shown
  in blue and purple, respectively. Solid lines indicate the single‐step reactions
  of FAEE synthesis in Y. lipolytica, and the multi‐step reaction is shown with the
  dashed line. The FAEE titers in the engineered Y. lipolytica strains could be further
  improved when cocultured with the yeast S. cerevisiae that could provide ethanol
  as a substrate for FAEE production
