caption: Schematic of the NFκB signalling pathway (isoforms of IκBα not shown). Solid
  arrows denote reactions and dashed arrows indicate translocation. In the model,
  an external stimulation suddenly raises the concentration of IKK, which catalyses
  the degradation of IκBα, leading to the release of NFκB that can then translocate
  to the nucleus. In the nucleus, NFκB regulates the expression of genes leading to
  a resynthesis of the IκBα inhibitor proteins. The newly synthesized IκBα binds to
  the nuclear NFκB forming an IκBα–NFκB complex, whereby NFκB is shuttled back to
  the cytoplasm thus initiating a negative feedback loop.
