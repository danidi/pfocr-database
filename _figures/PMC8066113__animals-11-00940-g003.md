caption: Involvement of GPR37 in processes related to the cellular response to infection
  with small ruminant lentiviruses/visna-medi virus in goats. Pink highlights downregulation;
  GPR37—G protein-coupled receptor 37; FOS-Fos proto-oncogene, (AP-1 transcription
  factor subunit) is a protein coding gene. These genes encode leucine zipper proteins
  that can dimerize with proteins of the JUN family, thereby forming the AP-1 transcription
  factor complex. The interaction between Fos and Jun targets the Tat visna virus
  and promotes its replication in monocytes and macrophages after their differentiation.
  Fos-Jun activation can influence the activation of many cellular genes; this could
  intensely affect cell and viral growth and thus play a role in the pathogenesis
  of the visna virus; TGFB1—TGFβ1 gene encodes a secreted ligand of the TGF-beta (transforming
  growth factor-beta) superfamily of proteins. This protein regulates cell proliferation,
  differentiation, and growth, and can modulate the expression and activation of other
  growth factors, including interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha []. IL1B-interleukin
  1β; IL-10 interleukin 10; APOBEC3B—apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic
  polypeptide-like 3. The antiviral APOBEC3 protein is packaged into the forming virions
  and limits replication by causing mutations in viral cDNA. PPIA (aliases CYPA, Cyclophilin
  A)—the PPIA gene encodes a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase)
  family. In goat SRLV, Vif can exploit the host cellular PPIA protein as a co-factor
  for caprine APOBEC3 degradation. []; SMO (Smoothened). The SMO gene encodes a member
  of the Frizzled family of G protein-coupled receptors, which is connected with the
  hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. In humans, SMO inhibits infection by HIV-1 and
  limits the spread of HIV-1 infection by suppressing the formation of viral DNA [].
