caption: Insulin signaling pathway. Upon binding of insulin to its receptor, a cascade
  of intracellular events in the cells is initiated. The activated insulin receptor
  phosphorylates and activates substrate proteins such as Shc and IRS. Phosphorylation
  of Shc promotes the formation of Shc/Grb-2/SOS complex which stimulates MAP kinase
  pathway, resulting in mitogenesis, cell growth, and differentiation. Phosphorylated
  IRS proteins interact with many other signaling proteins including Grb-2 and PI3K,
  and change cellular function. PI3K catalyzes the formation of PIP3 which, in turn,
  activates Akt and aPKC, and controls many aspects of insulin action, including protein
  synthesis, glycogen synthesis, and glucose transport via the translocation of GLUT4
  to the plasma membrane. Glucose that enters the cells is rapidly phosphorylated
  by hexokinase enzymes to generate glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P), and is subsequently
  utilized for metabolism and/or stored in the cells as glycogen or TG.
