caption: NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) is constantly being translated. However, under
  normal unstimulated conditions, NIK is ubiquitinated and degraded via the TRAF3/TRAF2/cIAP1/cIAP2
  complex. Upon stimulation by TNF family ligands, this complex is degraded via K48
  ubiquitination, which allows NIK to interact with and phosphorylate IKKα. IKKα then
  phosphorylates p100, leading to its cleavage to p52. The processing of p100 allows
  the RelB/p52 dimer to enter the nucleus and initiate transcription of non-canonical
  NF-κB associated genes, such as CXCL12 and CXCL13.
