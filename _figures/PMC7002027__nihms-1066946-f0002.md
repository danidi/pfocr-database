caption: Following phagocytosis, degradation of tumour cells occur within phagolysosomes,
  which results in the recognition of tumour-derived DAMPs such as nuclear DNA (nDNA)
  and single stranded RNA (ssRNA) by TLRs, leading to subsequent activation of NFκB
  pathway. Alternatively, nucleic acids such as mitochondrial DNAs can escape from
  the phagosomes through a yet to be discovered mechanism into the cytosol, where
  they are detected by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS. cGAS then convert ATP and GTP
  into cGMP, which binds with STING to phosphorylate IRF3 and NFκB. This enables them
  to be translocated into the nucleus, where they act as transcription factors to
  promote the transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes such as type I IFNs and
  TNFα.
