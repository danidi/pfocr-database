caption: Model of THRAP3 and BCLAF1 function. In normal cells BCLAF1 and THRAP3 function
  together to promote the selective splicing (BCLAF1) and mRNA export (THRAP3) of
  a subset of genes, many of which are involved within the cellular DDR pathway. Loss
  of both BCLAF1 and THRAP3 results in defective splicing and export with subsequent
  loss of protein expression of THRAP3/BCLAF1 regulated genes. In contrast, in the
  absence of THRAP3, BCLAF1 is upregulated, which although confers some DDR deficiency,
  at least partially compensates for THRAP3 loss, presumably via an increased capacity
  to splice target transcripts which may be exported by alternative, less specific/efficient
  export proteins. Similarly, loss of BCLAF1 results in upregulation of THRAP3, resulting
  in increased capacity for export of BCLAF1/THRAP3 target genes, which may be spliced
  by less specific/efficient splicing proteins, which is able to partially compensate
  for loss of BCLAF1, resulting in a mild DDR defect.
