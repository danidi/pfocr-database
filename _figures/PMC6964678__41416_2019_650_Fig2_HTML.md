caption: 'Cancer cells obtain fatty acids (FAs) from de novo lipogenesis and exogenous
  uptake. The exogenous uptake of FAs from the surrounding microenvironment is facilitated
  by specialised transporters, including CD36, FATPs and FABPpm. FAs and their synthetic
  products can be subsequently stored as LDs, and used for NADPH and acetyl-CoA production
  through β-oxidation. In terms of carbon sources for de novo lipogenesis, cancer
  cells rely on glucose, glutamine and acetate to synthesise citrate. Palmitate is
  ultimately generated from citrate through the enzymatic activities of ACLY, ACC
  and FASN, and can subsequently be desaturated and elongated to form a diverse group
  of lipid species. An alternative pathway for palmitate desaturation exists, which
  generates sapienate through FADS2, instead of palmitoleate. Abbreviations: GLUT1,
