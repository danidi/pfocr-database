caption: Voltage-gated and SOCE co-exist in cardiomyocytes. In cardiomyocytes, upon
  depolarization Ca2+ enters the myocyte through L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC) located
  on the plasma membrane, which are in close proximity to the Ryanodine receptors
  (RyR) in the SR membrane. The RyR sense the local increase in cytosolic Ca2+, which
  triggers Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the SR to initiate contraction. Following
  contraction, cytosolic Ca2+ levels are reduced by Ca2+ re-entry into the SR via
  sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) or through plasma membrane Ca2+
  channels, such as the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) or the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase
  (PMCA). It is now clear that SOCE pathways co-exist in cardiomyocytes with the traditional
  voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. In response to binding of agonists, such as endothelin
  (ET-1), ANG II, and phenylephrine (PE) to their respective G protein-coupled receptors
  (GPRC), the resulting inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) binds to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate
  receptor (IP3R) located on the ER/SR membrane causing ER/SR Ca2+ release. This decline
  in ER/SR Ca2+ content is sensed by STIM1, which then undergoes oligomerization and
  activates Orai1, resulting in Ca2+ entry. The resulting, sustained Ca2+ entry activates
  downstream pathways such as the calcineurin/NFAT pathway, driving transcriptional
  pathways such as hypertrophic signaling.
