caption: Model of the ET-1 signaling pathway in the renal vasculature. The primary
  source of ET-1 production is the vascular endothelium, although it also is produced
  by other cell types in the kidney including epithelial cells. ET-1 is synthesized
  within the secretory vesicles of the constitutive pathway. Pro–ET-1 is processed
  to big ET-1 by the action of a furin convertase. Big ET-1 then is transformed to
  the mature, biologically active peptide ET-1, mainly through the action of ECE-1,
  although a second related enzyme, ECE-2, also may play a role, particularly under
  acidic pathophysiological conditions. ET-1 also is released from Weibel-Palade bodies
  of the regulated pathway in response to external stimuli. ET-1 released abluminally
  causes the underlying smooth muscle to contract, mainly via ETA. The ligand-receptor
  complex then undergoes internalization to the endosome before recycling of the receptor
  to the cell surface. Some smooth muscle cells from specific vascular beds express
  a low density of ETB, but ETA antagonists are able to fully reverse an established
  ET-1 constrictor response, implying a minimal contribution. Binding to endothelial
  ETB elicits an opposing vasodilatation via the release of relaxing factors as well
  as removal of ET-1 from the circulation by internalization to the lysosome and degradation.
