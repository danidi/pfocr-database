caption: Increased levels of ING1a, produced by alternative splicing in response to
  short telomeres or oxidative stress, bind and activate the promoter of ITSN2, increasing
  its levels. This leads to inhibition of endocytosis and a loss of signal transduction
  via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. This increases the levels of p16
  and of p57KIP2, which inhibit Rb phosphorylation, maintaining it in its hypophosphorylated,
  growth-inhibitory state. This and the ITSN2-independent induction of Rb by ING1a
  result in the accumulation of high levels of active Rb that inhibits E2F, blocking
  the expression of most E2F target genes. Inability to induce transcription of growth-promoting
  genes inhibits cell cycle progression and, combined with Rb-induced accumulation
  of SAHF, results in senescence. We propose that this mechanism also acts during
  normal replicative senescence, since the levels of both ING1a and intersectin 2
  are dramatically increased in high passage senescing cells. Dashed arrows represent
  the ING1a-mediated senescence pathway identified in this study.
