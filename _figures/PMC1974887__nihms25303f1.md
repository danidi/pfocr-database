caption: The length of the polyisoprenoid chain of Q, designated by n, varies depending
  on the species; n = 6 in S. cerevisiae, 9 in C. elegans, and 10 in H. sapiens. In
  S. cerevisiae, there are nine identified Coq proteins necessary for the synthesis
  of QH2 from dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate precursors. The
  enzymatic functions of Coq4, Coq6, Coq8 and Coq9 polypeptides have yet to be characterized.
  Molecular oxygen and AdoMet are proposed donors for the hydroxy and methyl group,
  respectively (). CLK-1 is the C. elegans Coq7 homologue.
