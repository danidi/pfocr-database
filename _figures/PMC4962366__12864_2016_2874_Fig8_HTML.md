caption: 'Gene network. Gene network showing the interaction of the orthologous genes
  pomc-a and pomc-b obtained by GeneMANIA. Genes having physiological interactions
  either with pomc-a or pomc-b were used to create GeneMania network. Input genes
  are indicated with stripes and are either of black, red or blue color. Intermediate
  genes added by the tool are illustrated in grey circles. Colored genes denote functions
  associated by the tools: blue = “G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway”;
  red = “G-protein coupled peptide receptor activity”. Edge colors indicate the type
  of interaction: shared protein domains (green), co-expressed genes (violet) and
  physical interactions (pink) are shown'
