caption: The UPR sensors PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6 control mRNA translation and transcriptional
  induction of UPR-regulated genes. Interaction of BiP with each UPR sensor prevents
  UPR signaling. Upon accumulation of unfolded protein, BiP is released from each
  sensor, leading to its activation. The ER protein kinase PERK is activated by homodimerization
  and autophosphorylation to phosphorylate eIF2α, thereby reducing the rate of mRNA
  translation and the biosynthetic protein-folding load on the ER. eIF2α phosphorylation
  paradoxically increases translation of Atf4 mRNA to produce a transcription factor
  that activates expression of genes encoding protein chaperones, ERAD machinery,
  enzymes that reduce oxidative stress, and functions in amino acid biosynthesis and
  transport. Dimerization of the ER protein kinase IRE1α triggers its endoribonuclease
  activity to induce cleavage of Xbp1 mRNA. Xbp1 mRNA is then ligated by an uncharacterized
  RNA ligase and translated to produce XBP1s. Concurrently, ATF6 released from BiP
  transits to the Golgi where it is cleaved to release a transcriptionally active
  fragment. Cleaved ATF6 acts in concert with XBP1s to induce expression of genes
  encoding protein chaperones and ERAD machinery. The RNase activity of IRE1α also
  degrades selective cellular mRNAs to reduce the client protein load upon the ER.
  Physiological stimuli that can activate the UPR in the β-cell include expression
  of misfolded proinsulin or IAPP, oxidative stress (ROS), and increases in the extracellular
  concentrations of glucose, fatty acids, or cytokines.
