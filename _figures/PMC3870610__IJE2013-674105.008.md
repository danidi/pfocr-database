caption: Signaling pathway of the AMH protein. Model showing how processing of AMH
  may regulate the assembly of the receptor signaling complex. Cleavage of full-length
  AMH results in a conformational change in the C-terminal domain, indicated by the
  shape and color change, which allows binding of AMRH-II. Binding of AMHRII induces
  dissociation of the proregion via a negative allosteric interaction between the
  receptor- and proregion-binding sites on the C-terminal dimer, indicated by the
  shape change. Results presented in this paper are consistent with proregion dissociation
  occurring before type I receptor engagement, but this has not been proven. Type
  I and II receptor-binding sites on the C-terminal dimer are indicated by either
  a I or a II; black labels indicate sites on the front of the dimer, and white labels
  indicate sites on the back of the dimer. From [], Copyright The Endocrine Society,
