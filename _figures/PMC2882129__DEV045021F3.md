caption: Smo conformational changes, trafficking and pathway activation. Smo exists
  as a constitutive dimer and conformational changes accompany its trafficking and
  activation. (A) (Left) In Drosophila, inactive Smo (red) cycles within the cell
  and the protein is in a closed conformation. Positive charges from the Arg clusters
  (purple circles) in the Smo C-tail are neutralized by distal acidic residues (yellow
  circles). (Middle) As increasing concentrations of Hh ligand bind to Ptc, the Smo
  C-tail is phosphorylated by PKA and CKI. This leads to local neutralization of the
  Arg clusters through phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues (green circles) and the
  movement of Smo to the cell surface. (Right) High Hh concentrations cause full phosphorylation
  and increased proximity of Smo C-tails, which may lead to an open conformation that
  might facilitate the coupling of Smo to the Hh signaling complex. (B) (Left) In
  mice, Smo is in an inactive conformation (red) in the absence of Hh. (Middle) Smo
  adopts a conformation that permits trafficking to the primary cilium, but does not
  activate the pathway. This is recapitulated by binding of the veratrum alkaloids
  cyclopamine and jervine to Smo. (Right) Removal of Ptch1 or activation of Smo by
  agonist binding (e.g. to purmorphamine) facilitates cilium trafficking and Smo activation
  (green), thus permitting Smo to communicate with the Gli proteins. Mouse Smo also
  dimerizes, but the relationship of Smo dimers to intracellular trafficking is currently
  unclear in this system. Arg, arginine; CKI, casein kinase I; Hh, Hedgehog; Lys,
  lysine; P, phosphate group; PKA, protein kinase A; Smo, Smoothened.
