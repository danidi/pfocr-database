caption: '(a) Phosphorylation (represented by −P) of Rps6 has been observed downstream
  of multiple growth signals and pharmacological stimuli. The functional role of Rps6
  phosphorylation has been elucidated in mouse models lacking Rps6 phosphorylation
  sites. Phosphorylation of Rpl13a occurs as part of the innate immune response and
  leads to the separation of this RP from assembled ribosomes to carry out a transcript-specific
  translation program as part of the GAIT complex. Rpl13a phosphorylation has been
  identified in human monocytic cells. Phosphorylation of Rps15 is critical for the
  neurotoxicity phenotype seen in Parkinson’s disease models in human neurons and
  Drosophila. Pencil symbol denotes the enzymes responsible for attaching the PTM
  to the RPs, whereas scissors symbol denotes the enzymes reversing the PTM. Pencil
  or scissors symbols in green indicates that the specific enzymes are known for this
  particular PTM; whereas pencil or scissors in white indicates the enzymes remain
  unknown.(b) Ubiquitin modifications (represented by magenta circles) at the ribosome
  can lead to diverse outcomes: non-degradative K63 linked ubiquitin chains or mono-ubiquitin
  signals can modify RPs in response to stress conditions. For example, in response
  to oxidative stress in yeast, RPs are modified by K63 linkages. Upon ER stress,
  cytoplasmic ribosomes, but not ER-ribosomes are decorated with mono-ubiquitin on
  multiple different RPs as shown in a tissue-culture based system. Ubiquitin signaling
  at the ribosome as part of the mRNA-protein quality control pathway is versatile
  and can modify nascent chains with degradative K48-linked ubiquitin chains while
  also modifying RPs with mono-ubiquitin signals. Ubiquitin signaling can also mark
  ribosome biogenesis factors and may lead to ribosome functional diversity during
  neural crest cell differentiation.'
