caption: 'Relative transcript levels for genes from carbon central metabolism for
  PB12 (first value) and PB13 (second value), as compared to JM101. Metabolic network
  showing the relative gene transcription levels of genes related to the carbon central
  metabolism, fermentative pathways and the connection with the common aromatic amino
  acid pathway. Most relevant transcriptional responses in host strains without plasmids
  are shown: PB12 (first value), PB13 (second value) as compared to JM101. According
  to the significance criterion, only those relative gene transcription values ≥ 2
  (up-regulation, data in red) or ≤ 0.5 (down-regulation, data in blue), as compared
  to JM101 reference strain, are shown. The relative gene transcription value for
  JM101 is always equal to 1 and for that reason was omitted. No significant values
  were written in black. Metabolites abbreviations: GLC, glucose; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; PBP, fructose-1,6-biphosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 1,3-BGP, 1,3-biphosphoglycerate; 3PG,
  3-phosphoglycerate; 2PG, 2-phophoglycerate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, pyruvate;
