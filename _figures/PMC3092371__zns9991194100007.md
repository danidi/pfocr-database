caption: 'Working model of the role of FKBP1b in aging-related Ca2+ dyshomeostasis.
  A, In young subjects, neuronal FKBP1b exerts strong tonic inhibitory effects on
  two pathways: the Ca2+regulatory pathway and the mTOR signaling pathway. In the
  Ca2+regulatory pathway, FKBP1b inhibits cytosolic Ca2+ rises generated by extracellular
  influx via L-VGCCs (1) and intracellular release from RYRs (2), by inhibiting both
  channel types directly (3, 4). In the mTOR pathway, FKBP inhibition of mTOR (5)
  helps maintain the balance between growth-stimulating and autophagy-suppressing
  effects of mTOR. B, With aging (mimicked by FKBP1b knockdown), a decline of FKBP1b
  expression/function leads to weakened inhibition of both pathways and concomitant
  increases in both Ca2+ and mTOR signaling. Increased Ca2+signaling results in dampened
  neuronal excitability and function, whereas mTOR disinhibition leads to aberrant
  increases in growth signaling as well as decreased autophagy. C, Rapamycin in young
  subjects exerts opposite effects on FKBP inhibition in the two pathways, mimicking
  the effect of aging of weakened FKBP inhibition in the Ca2+pathway (B) but paradoxically
  augmenting FKBP inhibition of the mTOR pathway (C).'
