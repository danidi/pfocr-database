caption: Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) and the Slm1 and Slm2 proteins
  regulate the synthesis and turnover of complex sphingolipids and the dynamics of
  the actin cytoskeleton. The enzymes Stt4 and Mss4, which synthesize PI4,5P2 along
  with the TORC2 protein kinase, are proposed to activate Slm1 and Slm2, which then
  downregulate the turnover of complex sphingolipids, particularly inositol phosphoceramide
  (IPC), by the Isc1 enzyme. The Slm proteins also regulate the calcium/calmodulin-regulated
  protein phosphatase calcineurin, which dephosphorylates and inactivates the Slm
  proteins and also interacts with Csg1/2 in an unknown manner to regulate the conversion
  of IPC to mannose inositol phosphoceramide by the Csg1/2 enzymes. Slm regulation
  of the Rho1/Pkc1 pathway is independent from the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism.
  Genetic interactions suggest that IPC plays a role in actin organization, but the
  mechanism is unknown. PI, phosphatidylinositol; PI4P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate.
