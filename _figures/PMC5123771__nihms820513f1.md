caption: Cardiac fibroblasts are not unidimensional matrix-secreting cells, but exhibit
  remarkable functional pluralism. Following myocardial infarction, release of danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) by necrotic cardiomyocytes (CM) activates a pro-inflammatory
  phenotype in fibroblasts, inducing secretion of cytokines and chemokines, and stimulating
  leukocyte (L) infiltration. Moreover, during the early post-ischemic period, fibroblasts
  may modulate survival pathways in cardiomyocytes, affecting their susceptibility
  to ischemic death. These effects may be mediated through secretion of soluble pro-
  or anti-apoptotic mediators by fibroblasts, via release of exosomes containing miRNAs,
  or through modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by fibroblast-derived matrix-metalloproteinases
  (MMPs). MMP-mediated degradation of the matrix may deprive fibroblasts from essential
  pro-survival signals. Fibroblast GRK2 signaling may extend ischemic injury following
  myocardial infarction through pro-inflammatory actions, or by activating a pro-apoptotic
  pathway in cardiomyocytes.
