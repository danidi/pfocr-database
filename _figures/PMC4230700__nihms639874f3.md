caption: a | In order to escape dormancy and become proliferative dormant disseminated
  tumour cells (DTCs) can inhibit bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling by expressing
  inhibitors such as COCO. Proliferative DTCs also require activation of growth factor
  signalling via ERBB family receptors such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
  which can be coupled to uPAR and β1 integrin signalling that can be activated by
  extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules such as fibrillar fibronectin (fFN) via α5β1
  integrins or by heterotypic interaction with vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1).
  Receptor tyrosine kinases like the ERBB family funnel proliferative signals through
  FAK, SRC and the MEK–ERK modules to cyclin D1 and cyclin D3 or through myosin light
  chain kinase (MLCK). Other growth-promoting pathways activated in proliferative
  DTCs include the canonical transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) signalling pathway.
  Signals between the EGFR and TGFβ signalling pathways are integrated through as
  yet unknown mechanisms. b | In dormant DTCs TGFβ2 and bone morphogenetic protein
  4 (BMP4) or BMP7 signals predominate, activating p38, inhibiting ERK1 or ERK2 (for
  example, by TGFβ2, BMP7 or EDG2 inhibition), and inducing p21 and p27 cyclin-dependent
  kinase (CDK) inhibitors (in all cases). Specific TGFβ2 canonical (SMAD1 or SMAD5)
  and non-canonical signalling result in the upregulation of DEC2 and BMP7 signalling
  and induce NDRG1 that subsequently leads to the induction of cell cycle inhibitors
  and prostate cancer cell dormancy. Paradoxically, in mouse mammary cancer models
  NDRG1 was also shown to be induced by COCO and to support metastasis. Importantly,
  dormant DTCs may also be sensitive to the growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS6)
  or become unable to derive proliferative signals from fibronectin in the ECM through
  α5β1 integrins (previously reviewed in REF. ). Question marks indicate unknown mechanisms
  or factors.
