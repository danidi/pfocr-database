caption: Pathways involved in physiological and in the pathological cardiac hypertrophy
  of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Signal transduction pathways pave the way
  for cellular mechanisms controlling gene expression; a cascade of molecules leading
  to the activation of one or more specific transcription factors is actuated. The
  extracellular signals in the form of ligands/effector molecules, which bind to specific
  receptors to initiate the hypertrophy-producing pathways, are transcribed across
  the sarcolemma via an assortment of second messengers. In physiological forms of
  cardiomyocyte/myocardial growth, only direct mechanotransduction routes and the
  PI3K(p110α) lipid kinase-Akt serine/threonine kinase pathway are activated, downstream
  from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), leading to left ventricular (LV) remodeling
  involving replication of cardiomyocyte sarcomeres both in-parallel and in-series
  and to an eccentric LV hypertrophy pattern with amplified systolic myocardial performance.
  On the other hand, in the pathological form of hypertrophy that is induced in conjunction
  with the LV pressure overload of CAVD (or hypertension), there ensues activation
  of a diverse, wider variety of signaling pathways, involving G protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCR). GPCR mediate pathological cardiac hypertrophy through downstream mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)
  and calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase that controls hypertrophic gene transcription
  by dephosphorylating transcription factors such as nuclear factor of activated T
  cells (NFAT). This ultimately leads to the identifiable expression of a maladaptive
  genetic program, with activation of protein translation concluding with replication
  of cardiomyocyte sarcomeres in-parallel and a typically concentric LV hypertrophy;
  these effects are complicated by cellular apoptosis and ECM fibrosis, by (subendocardial)
  ischemia with diastolic and systolic dysfunction, and by transition to heart failure
  with subsequent LV chamber dilatation (see particulars in text). Modified from Pasipoularides
