caption: 'IH inhibited autophagy and promoted apoptosis in rat cardiomyocte by the
  signaling pathway, which up-regulated the expression of Egr-1, and then activated
  Bim and suppressed Beclin-1. Based on the results in this study, IH-induced cardiomyocyte
  autophagy and apoptosis may be associated with the Egr-1/Bim/Beclin-1 pathway. IH:
  ischemia/hypoxia; →: promotion; ⊥: suppression.'
