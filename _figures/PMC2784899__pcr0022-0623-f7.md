caption: Model to account for responsiveness to cAMP level in activation but not inactivation
  of eumelanin synthesis. See Discussion for main explanation. (A-YY) ASIP-YY, (Mc)
  melanocyte, (Mb) melanoblast, (Ub) ubiquitinylation. Melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R)
  is shown with some basal activity (left, lost in e mutant), to explain why POMC
  null, a/a mice are black, and related data (see text). (This might alternatively
  be due to BD103 or some unknown signal). Agouti signaling protein (ASIP) would not
  be required for pheomelanogenesis unless Y has been switched on by the MC1R/cAMP
  pathway, hence inactive MC1R would give a yellow color even with deficient MGRN1,
  as seen in e/e, md/md mice.
