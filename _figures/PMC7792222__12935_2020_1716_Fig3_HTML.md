caption: miRNA-mediated regulation of BCSCs via targeting the Notch signaling pathway.
  The Notch signaling pathway is activated when Notch ligands on one cell interact
  with Notch receptors on an adjacent cell, resulting in the two consecutive cleavages
  of Notch receptors by ADAMs and γ-secretase, and the release of Notch receptor intracellular
  domain NICD into the cytoplasm. The released NICD is translocated into the nucleus
  and binds to CSL to initiate the Notch target genes’ expression. The immediate targets
  of related miRNAs are marked
