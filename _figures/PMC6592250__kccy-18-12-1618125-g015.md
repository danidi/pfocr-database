caption: 'Association between high glycolytic flux and extracellular pH (pHe) gradient
  formation by carbonic anhydrase, as well as proton pump and exchangers. Glycolysis-associated
  lactate generation promotes hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1α) activation and
  HIF-1α dependent transcription of several proton channels and exchangers. Extrusion
  of protons (H+) by these regulators contributes to a concomitant extracellular acidification
  (pHe: 6.8) and intracellular alkalinization (pHi: 7.2) in growing tumor cells. Additional
  source of tumor microenvironment acidity is the activity of carbonic anhydrase IX
  (CAIX). CAIX-dependent hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2) – predominantly generated
  by the oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway (ox-PPP) and to a lesser
  extent by TCA cycle – delivers protons (H+) and hydrogen carbonate (HCO3−) ions.
  Subsequent uptake of HCO3− by Na+-dependent bicarbonate (NBC) transporter and anion
  exchanger 2 (AE2), replenishes the intracellular HCO3−. Titration of HCO3− by intracellular
  H+ ions, produced by glycolysis, results in the formation of CO2 which rapidly diffuses
  across the plasma membrane, where it meets CAIX. MCT: monocarboxylate transporter,
  V-ATPase: vacuolar-type proton ATPase, NHE-1: sodium/hydrogen exchanger 1, AE2:
  anion exchanger 2, NBC: sodium/bicarbonate (Na+/HCO3−) co-transporter, CAIX: carbonic
  anhydrase 9.'
