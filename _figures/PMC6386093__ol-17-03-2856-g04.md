caption: Metabolic profiling of intracellular metabolites involved in branched-chain
  amino acid catabolism. LC-MS data revealed the changes of metabolite levels in DU-145
  cells which were transfected with PTEN siRNAs for 48 h. The blue-labeled metabolites
  in upper graph were significantly altered in the branched-chain amino acid catabolism
  pathway. ACAD8, isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase; BCKDHA, 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase
  E1 component alpha subunit; DBT, 2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase E2 component (dihydrolipoyl
  transacylase); echA, enoyl-CoA hydratase; HADH, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  HIBCH, 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase; IVD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase; mmsA,
  malonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating); mmsB, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase;
  vdh, valine dehydrogenase (NAD+); vorA, 2-oxoisovalerate ferredoxin oxidoreductase,
  alpha subunit; C5OH, hydroxyisovaleryl-carnitine; C5, methylbutanoyl-carnitine;
  C3, propanoyl-carnitine. *P<0.05 vs. cells transfected with control siRNA.
