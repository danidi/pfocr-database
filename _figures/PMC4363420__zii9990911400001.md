caption: Activated methyl pathway of B. burgdorferi. MetK synthesizes S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM) from ATP and methionine. SAM then acts as a methyl donor for many metabolic
  steps, also producing the by-product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH is toxic,
  so Pfs cleaves that molecule to produce adenine and S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH).
  SRH is nontoxic, and some bacterial species, such as the spirochete Treponema pallidum,
  end the pathway at this step. B. burgdorferi instead uses LuxS to cleave SRH into
  homocysteine and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD). Biochemical and genetic analyses
  demonstrated that B. burgdorferi lacks the ability to further metabolize homocysteine
  (, ). DPD, also known as autoinducer-2 (AI-2), is secreted by B. burgdorferi into
  the environment ().
