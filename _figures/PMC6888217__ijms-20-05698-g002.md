caption: The opposite effects of ATP (pro-inflammatory) and ADO (anti-inflammatory)
  on immune cells (T cells, NK cells, and macrophages). In (A), ATP in extracellular
  fluids can be considered as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), which
  can trigger an inflammatory response characterized by proliferation, cytotoxicity,
  and the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ
  (INF-γ), and interleukin-β (IL-1β) []. In (B), ADO mediates immunosuppressive responses
  for the protection of tissues adjacent to inflammation from attacks by immune cells.
  In this case, ADO induces secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such IL-10,
  and reduces secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α
  (TNF-α), IL-12, and IL-2 [,,,,].
