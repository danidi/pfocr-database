caption: 'Proposed pathway of ASPE signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells. Diagram indicates:
  Induction of G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Low dose
  (10 µg/ml) of ASPE induce G1-phase arrest accompanied by up-regulation of Cip1/p21
  and Kip1/p27 and down-regulation of cyclin D, and cyclin E transcripts and their
  related inhibitors Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6.High dose (50 µg/ml) induce apoptosis in
  MDA-MB-231 cells and increase the expression of cleaved Caspase-3and Bax, and decrease
  the anti-apoptosis protein level of Bcl-2. Over-generation of reactive oxygen species
  ROS was also illustrated. Black triangles indicate up-regulation or down-regulation
  of gene/protein expression where the amplitude of triangle illustrates the fold
  change of expression'
