caption: Cell Death Pathways. A. Apoptosis. In the extrinsic death receptor pathway,
  binding of an extracellular ligand such as TNF-α to its death receptor TNFR recruits
  adaptor molecules to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Caspase-8
  cleaves and activates effector caspase-3 and -7. In the intrinsic mitochondrial
  pathway, intracellular stress signals such as DNA damage, hypoxia, or glucose deprivation
  activate the pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak. During mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization,
  Bax and Bak form pores that allow the release of apoptogens such as cytochrome c
  into the cytosol. Cytochrome c and APAF1 form the apoptosome which recruits and
  activates caspase-9 and leads to caspase-3 and -7 activation. Death-receptor mediated
  caspase-8 activation can also cleave Bid to form truncated Bid (tBid) and activate
  the intrinsic pathway. B. Necrosis/Necroptosis. Excessive influx of Ca2+ into the
  mitochondria leads to opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
  (mPTP) and disruption of the proton gradient and ATP synthesis. The influx of water
  and solutes into mitochondria leads to swelling and membrane rupture. Regulated
  necrosis, or necroptosis, occurs in the absence of caspase-3 where the RIP1-RIP3
  complex facilitates necroptosis.
