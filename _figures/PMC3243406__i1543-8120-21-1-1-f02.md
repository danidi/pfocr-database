caption: Proposed biosynthetic and metabolic pathway for cytokinins.The proposed biosynthesis
  of zeatin tri-/diphosphate in Arabidopsis is shown on the left side of the figure.
  Both ADP and ATP are likely substrates for the plant IPT enzyme, and these and their
  di- and tri-phosphate derivatives are indicted together (e. g. ATP/ADP). The biosynthesis
  of cytokinins in bacteria (e.g. Agrobacterium) is compared next to it. Several possible
  modifications and the degradation of zeatin are shown on the right side. The diagram
  only depicts reactions that are described in the text; cytokinin metabolism is more
  complex than the pathways shown (see ). See text for more details.
