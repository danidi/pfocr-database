caption: 'Following its biosynthesis, PKC is in an open and degradation-sensitive
  conformation in which all its regulatory modules are unmasked (species i). It is
  then processed by three ordered phosphorylations that depend on the binding of Hsp90
  and Cdc37 (to a conserved PXXP motif in the kinase domain), the kinase complex mTORC2,
  and the activation loop kinase, PDK-1. Phosphorylation at these priming sites, the
  activation loop (magenta circle), the turn motif (orange circle) and the hydrophobic
  motif (green circle), promote PKC to adopt an autoinhibited conformation. Specifically,
  the Ca2+-sensing C2 domain (yellow) clamps the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate segment
  (red) in the substrate-binding cavity of the kinase domain (cyan), and the diacyglycerol-sensing
  C1 domains (orange) become masked (species ii). The masking of the C1 domains, in
  particular, effectively prevents basal signaling in the absence of agonists. Agonists
  that bind Gq-coupled receptors (R) cause phospholipase C (PLC)-catalyzed hydrolysis
  of PIP2 generating diacylglycerol and Ca2+. This promotes Ca2+-dependent recruitment
  of PKC to the plasma membrane via engagement of the Ca2+-bound C2 domain (species
  iii), where PKC binds its membrane-embedded ligand, diacylglycerol, via primarily
  the C1B domain (species iv). This active PKC phosphorylates downstream substrates,
  with one function being to suppress oncogenic signaling via its inactivating phosphorylation
  of proteins such as Ras and the EGF receptor. PKC returns to the autoinhibited conformation
  following the decay of its second messengers. The kinetics of activation mirror
  those for the rise in intracellular Ca2+ and the kinetics of inactivation mirror
  those for the decay in diacylglycerol. Note the membrane-bound conformation of PKC
  is sensitive to dephosphorylation, with the first dephosphorylation event on the
  hydrophobic motif catalyzed by PHLPP; subsequent dephosphorylation by PP2A produces
  a fully dephosphorylated PKC that is degraded via a proteasomal pathway (species
  v). However, binding of Hsp70 to the dephosphorylated turn motif allows PKC to become
  rephosphorylated to sustain the signaling lifetime of the enzyme. Phorbol esters
  bind the C1B domain with two-orders of magnitude higher affinity than diacylglycerol
  and are not readily metabolized, trapping PKC in the open, phosphatase-sensitive
  conformation and resulting in chronic loss, or down-regulation, of PKC. Novel PKC
  isozymes are regulated by similar mechanisms except their C2 domain does not function
  as a Ca2+ or plasma membrane sensor, resulting in the localization of novel PKC
  isozymes primarily to the more abundant and diacylglycerol-rich Golgi membranes.
  Atypical PKC isozymes are activated upon binding to specific protein scaffolds that
  tether the pseudosubstrate out of the substrate-binding cavity. Proteins indicated
  in grey are key regulators of the steady-state levels of PKC: Hsp70, Hsp90, mTORC2,
  and PDK-1 function to increase the steady-state levels of PKC by permitting/catalyzing
  processing phosphorylations; Pin1 and the phosphatases PHLPP and PP2A function to
  decrease the steady-state levels of PKC by permitting/catalyzing the dephosphorylation
  of PKC. Targeting any of these proteins will disrupt the balance of PKC signaling.
  Inset shows the structure of the autoinhibited kinase domain of PKCβII, showing
  autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate locked in the substrate-binding cavity of the kinase
  domain (cyan) by the C2 domain (yellow); C-terminal tail is indicated in grey.'
