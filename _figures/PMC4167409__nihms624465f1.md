caption: Androgen biosynthesis in prostate cancer cells. Reactions in the blue rectangle
  are known to occur in the prostate. Names of genes (in italics) that code for the
  various enzymes are shown. The classical pathway to DHT synthesis is indicated by
  black arrows, the alternative pathway to DHT synthesis is indicated by green arrows,
  and the backdoor pathway to DHT synthesis is indicated by blue arrows.
