caption: Model of the cellular entry of VLPs and subsequent antigen presentation.
  Within antigen presenting cells (APCs) the endosome-mediated internalization pathway
  for antigens delivered by polyomavirus VLPs, coincides with the TAP-dependent MHC
  class I-specific antigen processing and presentation process of the ER. Therefore,
  MHC class I-restricted CD8 T cells are preferentially induced by VLP-based immunization.
  Alternatively, VLP vaccination may also lead to the stimulation of MHC class II-restricted
  CD4 T cells via antigen uptake along the endosomal-lysosomal pathway to MHC class
  II-loading compartments of APCs. Cellular receptors are recognized via α-2,3-sialic
  acid residues, with ganglioside GD1 and 1-integrin being the primary and secondary
  receptors.
