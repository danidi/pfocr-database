caption: 'Reactions  (highlighted in blue) represent, as we show here, the ancestral
  route to glycine and serine. In organisms that use the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway as
  the exclusive route to carbon-fixation, the direct reduction of  also culminates
  in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, a step absent in many other organisms that do employ
  the preceding parts of the pathway. Reactions  constitute the oxidative route to
  serine and glycine, which are subsequently cleaved to supply  metabolism in many
  late-branching bacteria and eukaryotes. Reaction  constitutes the glyoxylate pathways,
  important in cyanobacteria and photorespiring plants. Abbreviations: MFR, methanofuran;

  GLY, glycine; SER, serine; PSR, phosphoserine; PHP, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate; 3PG,
  3-phosphoglycerate; GLX, glyoxylate. For a more detailed figure and caption, as
