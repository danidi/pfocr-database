caption: Schematic diagram depicting the proposed mechanisms of TGF-β-mediated cell
  motility via Ca2+/PKCα signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells. Binding of
  TGF-β with its membrane receptor results in production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) that activates IP3 receptors (IP3R) on the ER membrane and induces Ca2+ release
  from the ER. Depletion of the ER Ca2+ then activates the TRPC-encoded SOC and causes
  both Na+ and Ca2+ entry. The accumulated intracellular Na+ activates the entry mode
  of NCX1 and induces the inward transportation of Ca2+ via NCX1. An increase in [Ca2+]cyt
  mediates cell motility directly or indirectly via activation of Ca2+-dependent PKCα.
