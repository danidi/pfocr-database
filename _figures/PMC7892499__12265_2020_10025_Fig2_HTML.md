caption: 'Strategies for antagonizing NLRP3 pathway myocarditis-related key inflammatory
  components. (1) Upon binding of the S100A8/S1009 heterodimer to the Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR 4) or receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) on an innate immune
  cell, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated in the cytosol, which leads to
  the activation and translocation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) to the nucleus.
  Alternatively, viral single-stranded RNA, as by coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), can activate
  the intracellular receptor nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing
  protein 2 (NOD-2), which also activates NF-κB. The latter acts as transcription
  factor that stimulates the mRNA expression of the nucleotide the oligomerization
  domain-containing, leucine-rich repeat-containing, and pyrin domain-containing protein
  (NLRP3) inflammasome and of pro-IL-1ß. (2) Upon activation by K+ efflux, ATP, ROS,
  and other damage-associated molecular patterns, NLRP3 polymerizes with the adaptor
  protein ASC and caspase 1. Subsequently, caspase 1 cleaves pro-IL-1ß to its active
  form: IL-1ß. (3) The active cytokine IL-1ß is secreted to the extracellular space,
  where it binds to its receptor and induces autocrine and paracrine signaling on
  other immune cells. Q-compounds block step (1) upstream; colchicine blocks step
  (2); canakinumab and anakinra block step (3) via different mechanisms'
