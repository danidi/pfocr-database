caption: A working model for regulation of muscle regeneration by the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway.
  Cardiotoxin-induced injury triggers release of soluble factors that recruit early
  inflammatory cells and induce Fn14 expression on muscle precursor cells. Secreted
  by infiltrating inflammatory cells, TWEAK engages Fn14 and promotes the proliferation
  and activation of myoblasts, which can in turn contribute to a robust inflammatory
  response by producing additional chemotactant. The TWEAK/Fn14 pathway therefore
  positively contributes to muscle regeneration by promoting cellular crosstalk between
  inflammatory cells and muscle precursor cells.
