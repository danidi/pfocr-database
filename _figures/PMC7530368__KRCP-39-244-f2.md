caption: 'Mitochondrial aberrations play important roles in promoting glomerular and
  tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis during AKI and CKD. The contributors
  to mitochondrial dysfunction-induced renal inflammation during AKI include: 1) activation
  of necroptosis via tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) and receptor-interacting protein
  kinase-3 (RIPK3)-mediated NADPH oxidase-4 (NOX4) recruitment to the mitochondria
  or through the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), 2) mitochondrial
  fragmentation through increased fission and decreased fusion, and 3) damaged mitochondria-derived
  mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-mediated inflammatory response through the activation
  of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway.
  The activation of mitophagy after AKI could be a renoprotective response against
  mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (mROS) production. Reduction in mitochondrial
  fatty acid oxidation (FAO), loss of cristae, and impaired mitochondrial biogenesis
  and decreases in mitochondrial fusion and mitophagy resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation,
  superoxide production, and reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content all contribute
  to an increase in tissue damage and inflammatory and fibrotic responses in CKD.FA,
  fatty acid; IFNγ, interferon gamma; IL, interleukin.'
