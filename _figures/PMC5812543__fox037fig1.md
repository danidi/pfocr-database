caption: Isoprenoid formation in S. cerevisiae. The isoprenoid biosynthesis starts
  with acetyl-CoA, which is derived from the glycolytic pathway. At the end of the
  MVA, the both isoprenoids IPP and DMAPP are formed. Subsequently, GPP and FPP are
  formed by the ERG20 protein. The different colors represent the different strategies
  applied for improved isoprenoid production. HMG-CoA—3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme
  A, IPP—isopentenyl diphosphate, DMAPP—dimethylallyl diphosphate, GPP—geranyl diphosphate,
  FPP—farnesyl diphosphate, PDC—pyruvate decarboxylase, ADH1-5—alcohol dehydrogenase,
  ALD6—aldehyde dehydrogenase, ACS1/ACS2—acetyl-coA synthetase, ERG10—acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase,
  ERG13—3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, tHMGR—truncated 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase, ERG12—mevalonate kinase, ERG8—phosphomevalonate kinase, ERG19—mevalonate
  diphosphate decarboxylase, IDI1—isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate
