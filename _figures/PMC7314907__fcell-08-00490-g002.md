caption: Regulation of the HGF/c-Met axis by glycoconjugates. HSPGs and gangliosides
  in the local cellular environment are able to regulate HGF/c-Met activity. Anchored
  HGF are released from HS chains of HSPGs upon the cleavage by HPSE, which mediates
  the interaction between HGF and c-Met. Regulation of the HGF/c-Met by gangliosides
  is critically determined by the composition of the ganglioside glycan chains.
