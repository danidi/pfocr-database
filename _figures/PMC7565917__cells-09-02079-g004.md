caption: Hypothetical steps leading to the disassembly of NETs. (A) Once NETs are
  expelled into the extracellular space, (B) various DNA-digesting enzymes, DNases
  (e.g., DNase1L3, DNase I) pre-digest their backbone, composed of decondensed DNA,
  resulting in NET fragmentation (B), but the participation of other NET digesting
  enzymes operating extracellularly cannot be excluded. (C) Subsequently, NET proteins
  might be recognized by autoantibodies (auto-Ig) to which C1q of the complement binds,
  but C1q can also directly attach to some NET components such as histones and DNA.
  Auto-Ig and C1q might bind to NETs also, prior to the DNase action (B). What is
  more, (C) NETs can attach to the endothelium via the von Willebrand Factor (VWF),
  and remain present in the vasculature for a long time. (D) In the next step, phagocytes
  involved directly in NET removal, presumably recognize the NET components either
  with receptors for the Fc fragment of auto-Ig or by other receptors present on the
  cells surface, such as pattern recognition receptors (PRR) or complement receptors
  (CR). Once internalized, NETs can be subjected to the action of intracellular DNA
  cleaving exonuclease TREX1 (DNase III). (E) Recognition by signaling receptors initiates
  cascades of events (including the MyD88 pathway) leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine
  production, as well as extrusion of strings of DNA by monocytes and macrophages,
  presumably in a form of monocyte/macrophage extracellular traps (METs). Clec2d—C-type
  Lectin-Receptor-2d, C1q—complement component 1q, CR—Complement Receptor, DNase—Deoxyribonuclease,
  DNase1L3—Deoxyribonuclease 1 Like 3 protein (DNase γ), extDNA—extracellular DNA,
  FcR—Fc receptor, Ig—antibodies, MAPK—Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, METs—monocyte/macrophages
