caption: Molecular events in the autophagy pathway. A stress response, such as nutrient
  withdrawal, causes cells to initiate autophagy. The stress sensor TOR kinase remains
  inactivated in low-nutrient condition and maintains hypophosphorylated Atg13. Atg1/Ulk1
  interacts with Atg13 and Atg17 and regulates transmembrane protein Atg9 involved
  in lipid import from cellular organelles to act as a “phagophore” formation initiator.
  Next, Vps34/Beclin1 converts PI to PI3P followed by Atg5–Atg12 conjugation and interaction
  with Atg16L resulting in multimerization at the phagophore and formation of nascent
  curvature; coupled to these changes, LC3 processing helps elongation and expansion.
  Random or selective cargoes are targeted for degradation, followed by formation
  of a complete double-membrane ring called an “autophagosome.” Lysosomes dock and
  fuse with the autophagosome, forming an “autolysosome” where degraded cargoes generate
  amino and fatty acids to be transported back into the cytoplasmic pool. Autophagy
  acts as a primary response promoting cell viability and serving a cytoprotective
  role and upon stress removal the cell resumes normal function. However, extreme
  stress pushes the cell to cross the point of no return and commits it toward autophagic
  cell death (type II programmed cell death, PCD).
