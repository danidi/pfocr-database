caption: 'Expression profiles of the genes encoding enzymes in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis
  pathway at 12 dai. The blue arrows point to extensin peroxidases [EC: 1.11.1.7]
  that participate in lignin biosynthesis. Boxes colored in red represent down-regulated
  genes encoding that enzyme. Boxes colored in green represent up-regulated genes.
  Boxes colored in yellow represent multiple genes encode the enzyme and some of those
  different gene copies are up-regulated, while others are down-regulated.'
