caption: Schematic of the proposed pathways whereby mitochondrial dysfunction impacts
  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis. Exposure to cigarette smoke
  causes mitochondrial dysfunction, including elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen
  species (mtROS) production and mitochondrial depolarization (−Δψm). Release of mitochondrial
  damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may trigger inflammatory and apoptosis
  pathways. Autophagy and mitophagy activated in response to cigarette smoke exposure
  may impact various cellular processes that range from protective to maladaptive.
  These processes include the turnover of ubiquitinated proteins and mitochondria,
  activation of apoptosis, cilia turnover, activation of the necroptosis pathway,
  and inhibition of cellular senescence. Epithelial cell injury/cell death may contribute
  to adverse phenotypes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. MLKL = mixed lineage
  kinase domain-like pseudokinase; mtDNA = mitochondrial DNA; PARK2 = Parkin; PINK1 = phosphatase
  and tensin homolog–induced putative kinase 1; RIPK3 = receptor interacting protein
  kinase-3; ROS = reactive oxygen species.
