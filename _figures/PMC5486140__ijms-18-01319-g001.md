caption: NGF/TrkA pathway modulates Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) metabolism and
  synaptic functions in adult forebrain cholinergic neurons. (1) Studies reported
  in this review and in former studies indicate that the stretch of 16 amino acids
  (597–613) of the juxtamembrane region of APP-695 molecule (human APP numbering)
  contains also the binding sites for the NGF receptors TrkA and p75, as well as the
  cleavage sites for α- and β-secretase; (2) Such tight proximity might allow NGF-TrkA
  complex to stimulate α-secretase activity in the plasmamembrane (PM) and APP trafficking
  from the PM to the Golgi (arrow), and most probably back to PM (dashed arrow), also
  enriched of α-secretase. By recycling APP through neuronal compartments where β-secretase
  is poorly represented, NGF ensures the preferential anti-amyloidogenic cleavage
  of APP by the α-secretase; (3) At the synaptic compartment, NGF/TrkA pathway sustains
  the expression level of synaptic vesicle proteins, like synapsin and synaptophysin,
  and the consequent Ach release, thus subserving physiological synaptic functions
  in cholinergic neurons. (BFCN, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons; APP, Amyloid
  precursor protein; PM, plasmamembrane; Ach, acetylcholine). The illustration was
  realized by V.T., with the help of Isabella Triaca for graphic elaboration.
