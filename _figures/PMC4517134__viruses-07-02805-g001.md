caption: Human T-cell leukemia virus HTLV-1 interferes with cellular miRNA machinery.
  MiRNAs are transcribed by the RNA polymerase II or III into the nucleus as primary
  miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) from coding or non-coding part of genes. The nuclear RNase III
  Drosha recognized and processed pri-miRNAs into a hairpin-shaped RNA, named precursor
  miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5, and processed
  by the cytoplasmic RNase III Dicer in the mature miRNA duplex. The duplex forms
  a complex named RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). MiRNAs bind complementary
  sequences usually localized at 3′UTR of messenger RNA and this binding results in
  the inhibition of translation and/or messenger RNA degradation. HTLV-1 deregulates
  the cellular miRNA pathway by suppressing the function of Drosha and Dicer. Tax
  directly interacts with Drosha and the binding leads to Drosha degradation mediated
  by proteasome complex. The regulatory protein, Rex, is reported to directly interact
  with Dicer. Rex suppresses the ribonuclease-directed processing activity of Dicer,
  protecting against the cleavage Rex-mRNA.
