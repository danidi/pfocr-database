caption: Involvement of SnoN in As2O3-induced Autophagy. As2O3 alters the expression
  of TGFβ signaling mediators via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS).
  Our results suggest that the increase in SnoN expression leads to changes in LC3-II
  levels, implicating a role for SnoN in As2O3-induced autophagy, which could potentially
  bypass the apoptotic pathway. In addition, As2O3 bound to GSH can be effluxed out
  of the cell via MRP1 channels, which leads to cellular protection towards As2O3
  in cell lines with elevated MRP1 levels.
