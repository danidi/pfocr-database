caption: Action of metformin on cancer. Two mechanisms are involved. First, in diabetes-associated
  cancer, metformin systemically ameliorates hyperinsulinemia, hypoglycemia, and hyperlipidemia,
  which are promoting factors not only for initiation of cancer, but also for progression
  of cancer. Second, at cellular levels, metformin activates AMPK, an immediate downstream
  effector of the tumor suppressor LKB1. Metformin inhibits the mTOR pathway through
  both AMPK-dependent and independent mechanisms. AMPK can also inhibit SREBP-1 by
  regulating its expression and phosphorylation, leading to down-regulation of FASN
  and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). In addition, AMPK directly phosphorylates and
  inhibits ACC. In summary, metformin suppresses de novo syntheses of fatty acids
  and protein synthesis in cancer cells.
