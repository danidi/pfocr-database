caption: DR and DR mimetics improve gut epithelial function. In the fly gut, the epithelium
  consists of a monolayer of enterocytes (ECs) with interspersed enteroendocrine cells
  (EEs), and is basally located with intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and its daughter
  cells enteroblasts (EBs). The epithelial homeostasis of the gut is disrupted with
  aging, which causes dysplasia. Dietary restriction or its mimetics delay this process
  through various pathways including IIS signaling, TOR pathway, JNK, JAK/STAT pathway,
  IMD, and Ras/MAPK pathways. The communication of other organs with the intestine
  are also involved in the DR-mediated epithelial homeostasis and life extension effects.
  The secretion of Ilp5 from insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the adult brain is
  inhibited by DR, which may signify a down-regulation of IIS, which then regulates
  TOR and FoxO indirectly. In addition, the fat body also mediates gut actions with
  aging by sharing lipid storage and metabolism with the intestine. Furthermore, DR
  reduces age-related intestinal flora growth rates, and down regulates JAK/STAT and
  IMD pathway, ultimately reducing ISC mis-differentiation and delaying functional
  degeneration of the intestine. Lines represent signaling pathways, arrows represent
  activation and blunt arrows represent inhibition.
