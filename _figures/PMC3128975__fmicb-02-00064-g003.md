caption: Activation of NF-κB during L. pneumophila infection. In addition to PRR mediated
  activation, Icm/Dot translocated substrates induce NF-κB by multiple mechanisms.
  During induction of the NF-κB pathway, the inhibitor IκB is phosphorylated by IKK
  and degraded, leading to nuclear translocation of the transcription factor (Hayden
  and Ghosh, ). Five Dot/Icm translocated substrates are known to target this pathway
  by inhibiting host translation (Fontana et al., ). This inhibition of translation
  interferes with the synthesis of the unstable inhibitor IκB and frees NF-κB subunits
  to translocate into the nucleus (Hayden and Ghosh, ; Fontana et al., ). The Ser/Thr
  kinase LegK1 has the ability to act directly on the NF-κB pathway by phosphorylating
  IκB (Ge et al., ), resulting in its degradation. The translocated protein LnaB activates
  NF-κB by an as yet unknown mechanism (Losick et al., ).
