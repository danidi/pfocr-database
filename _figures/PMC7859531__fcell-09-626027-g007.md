caption: The schematic diagram illustrates the role of circCOL5A1 as a ceRNA for miR-7-5p
  to release Epac1 in regulating the pathological phenotype of keloids. circCOL5A1
  was generated by the head-to-tail splicing of COL5A1 in the nucleus and then functioned
  as ceRNA in the cytoplasm. circCOL5A1 reversed miR-7-5p-induced enhancement of HKFs
  biological function via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, including proliferation,
  migration, apoptosis, collagen production, and myofibroblast activation. Mechanismly,
  circRNAs could restore the expression of miR-7-5p target Epac1, forming the circCOL5A1/miR-7-5p/Epac1
  regulating axis. The miR∗ represented a segment of RNA on the pre-miRNA, and its
  position happened to be opposite that of the mature miRNA.
