caption: 'Regulation of MCL-1 anti-apoptotic activity.MCL-1 pro-survival function
  is regulated by two mechanisms: control of protein level and inhibition by BH3-only
  proteins. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway increases MCL-1 translation through mTOR
  signaling complex 1. MCL-1 protein level is also tightly regulated by proteasomal
  degradation. Three E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes MULE, β-TrCP, APC/C and one deubiquitinase
  USP9X, have been indentified as direct regulators of MCL-1 ubiquitylation. Alternatively,
  MCL-1 stability is also controlled by ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation.
  The second mode of regulation of MCL-1 pro-survival function is by occlusion of
  MCL-1 hydrophobic groove by BH3-only proteins. Additionally, shorter versions of
  MCL-1, generated by alternative splicing, could have a similar function by engaging
  MCL-1L through their BH3 domains.'
