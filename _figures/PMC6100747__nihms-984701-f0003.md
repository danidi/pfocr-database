caption: The evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway is a fundamental system
  for communication with other components of the transcriptional complex. Activation
  of the canonical Notch signaling pathway requires a sequential enzymatic cleavage
  cascade. Notch is cleaved by Furin (S1 cleavage) at the trans-Golgi and glycosylation
  occurs, followed by its insertion into the plasma membrane. The extracellular domain
  of Notch, EGF repeats, interacts with several ligands such as Jagged-1, -3, and
  -4 and Delta 1 and 2 on neighboring cells or γ-secretase-dependent soluble ligands.
  Interaction between the ligands and Notch leads to cleavage of the Notch extracellular
  domain (S2 cleavage), which is then recycled or degraded through endocytosis by
  a neighboring cell. The remaining trans-membrane anchored Notch domain. ΔEN is subsequently
  cleaved by the γ-secretase complex (S3 cleavage). Soluble Notch ligands and same-cell
  ligands can antagonize Notch signaling by direct interaction. γ-secretase activity
  is increased by HIF-1α in hypoxic conditions. The Pin1-induced conformational change
  in Notch enhances the γ-secretase-induced cleavage of Notch and increases the stability
  of NICD (the Notch intracellular domain) via inhibition of the E3 ligase FBW7. NICD
  translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with transcriptional cofactors such
  as p300, CSL, LSD1, and MAML1 to promote target gene expression. Unlike the canonical
  pathway, TCR activates Notch signaling in a ligand-independent manner by its interaction
  with Notch. The non-canonical Notch pathway interacts with proteins such as IκB,
  CARMA1, and β-catenin in the cytosol.

    Activation of the canonical Notch signaling pathway requires a sequential enzymatic
