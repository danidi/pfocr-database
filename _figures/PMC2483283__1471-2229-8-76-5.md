caption: Leucine degradation pathway in mitochondria. The enzyme names are in blue,
  gene names in black/red [see Additional file ] [,]. Genes that are co-expressed
  are depicted in red font. BCAT, branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase; BCKDH
  (BCKDC), branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase; IVD, isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  MCC, methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase; MG-CoAH (E-CoAH), methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase
  (enoyl-CoA hydratase); HMG-CoAL, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase. The candidate
  genes for enzymes catalyzing two terminal reactions have not been identified.
