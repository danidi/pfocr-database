caption: The schematic diagram of the adiponectin-AMPK pathway in glomerular cells.
  Circulating adiponectin acts on the adiponectin receptors on podocytes followed
  by activation of AMPK, and then suppresses Nox4 expression and maintains ZO-1 localization
  in podocytes. In adiponectin deficiency or a disease state, such as obesity, IHD
  and diabetes, upregulation of Nox4 and cytoplasmic translocation of ZO-1 is promoted
  by lower AMPK activity, and these changes are also induced by high glucose exposure.
  In mesangial cells, high glucose exposure induces nuclear translocation of USF-1
  followed by the upregulation of TGF-β, stimulating mesangial matrix accumulation.
  In addition, circulating palmitic acid induced by high fat exposure increases the
  production of MCP-1, which leads to inflammation in the kidney. Activation of AMPK
  maintains cytoplasmic localization of USF-1 and suppresses MCP-1 production in mesangial
  cells.
