caption: Potential pro-tumorigenic functions of GPNMB. GPNMB can exert both autocrine
  and paracrine effects to enhance tumor cell growth and cancer cell metastasis. GPNMB
  extracellular domain (ECD) is shed most likely in an ADAM10-mediated fashion. Tumor-specific
  integrin α5β1 interacts with the extracellular RGD domain of GPNMB to drive cancer
  cell metastasis by triggering the expression and secretion of tumorigenic factors
  such as MMPs and cytokines, most likely via the FAK/Src pathway, as well as by recruiting
  immune-suppressive cells (such as macrophages) to the tumor microenvironment. Crosstalk
  between GPNMB and Receptor Tyrosine Kinase signaling includes (1) GPNMB/NRP-1/VEGF
  receptor signaling that leads to increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion,
  (2) EGFR:GPNMB heterodimer complex formation enables interaction with LINK-A (long
  intergenic non-coding RNA for kinase activation, not shown) activating BRK, leading
  to HIF1α phosphorylation and stabilization, thereby, upregulation of its tumorigenic
  target genes. NRP-1, Neuropilin-1; ECD, extracellular domain/ectodomain of GPNMB;
  ADAM10, A Disintegrin and metalloproteinase protein 10; VEGF, Vascular endothelial
  growth factor; VEGFR, Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor; BRK, Breast tumor
  kinase or Protein-tyrosine kinase-6; HIF1α, Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha.
