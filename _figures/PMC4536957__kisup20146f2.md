caption: Schema showing the multiple functions of FOXD1 lineage myofibroblasts in
  interstitial kidney disease. Pericytes (attached to the endothelium) and resident
  fibroblasts (red), both derived from FOXD1+ nephrogenic progenitors, transition
  to become a major source of myofibroblasts in interstitial kidney disease. A poorly
  defined leukocyte may also contribute to the appearance of myofibroblasts. As myofibroblasts,
  this cell lineage undergoes major phenotypic changes, acquiring a migratory, highly
  proliferative phenotype under the early regulation of developmental pathway growth
  factors including platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs). Evidence for chromatin
  remodeling has been documented that serves to enhance the myofibroblast phenotype.
  Myofibroblasts acquire new actin filament machinery rendering them contractile;
  they increase synthesis of pathological matrix proteins including fibrillar and
  non-fibrillar collagens as well as other matrix proteins, processes regulated by
  the developmental receptor signaling, matrix protein signaling, and inflammatory,
  hypoxia signaling mechanisms. Factors regulating matrix turnover and stability are
  highly expressed, and metabolic changes occur, rendering myofibroblasts highly resistant
  to the hostile metabolic environment. In addition to these roles, myofibroblasts
  are a major source of inflammatory factors and regulate recruitment of leukocytes.
  Although resolution of myofibroblast expansion occurs, the mechanisms are currently
  obscure. ADAMTS, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin repeats;
  CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; CTHRC1, collagen triple-helix repeat containing-1;
  FAP, fibroblast-activated protein; FGFs, fibroblast growth factors; MMP, matrix
  metalloproteinase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Shh, sonic hedgehog; TGF-β, transforming
  growth factor-β.
