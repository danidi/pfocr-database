caption: HPV carcinogenesis. (A) According to the currently engrained model, the E7
  protein initiates carcinogenesis by inactivating the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
  protein (RB1). The resulting activation of E2F transcription factors causes TP53
  activation, a cellular defense response that results in G1 cell cycle arrest and/or
  apoptosis. To thwart this response, the E6/UBE3A (E6AP) ubiquitin ligase complex
  targets TP53 for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation. To counteract telomere
  erosion, E6 also activates telomerase (TERT), which results in unlimited, aberrant
  cellular proliferation. (B) The revised model suggests that HPV E7 expression triggers
  a p16INK4A-mediated cellular defense response that is reminiscent of RAS oncogene-induced
  senescence (OIS). De novo p16INK4A expression is triggered by removal of repressive
  trimethyl marks on lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) by the KDM6B histone demethylase.
  High-risk HPV E7 proteins have evolved to degrade RB1 to short-circuit the p16INK4A-mediated
  activation of RB1 tumor suppressor activity that is designed to trigger G1 cell
  cycle arrest and senescence (see also panel C). E7 expression also causes epigenetic
  derepression of the p14ARF promoter through a KDM6B-independent mechanism. As a
  consequence of removal of H3K27me3 repressive marks, HPV E7-expressing cells show
  dysregulated homeobox (HOX) gene expression, suggestive of loss of Polycomb-mediated
  repression and epigenetic reprogramming. HPV E7-expressing cells rapidly acquire
  an “addiction” to the KDM6A and KDM6B H3K27 demethylases and to p16INK4A tumor suppressor
  expression. See the text for details. (C) Oncogenic stress, such as that induced
  by the RAS oncoprotein, triggers a cell intrinsic tumor suppressor pathway, and
  this phenomenon is known as oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). OIS is initiated
  by transcriptional induction of the KDM6B H3K27 demethylase, which results in derepression
  of genes typically silenced by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, such as the p16INK4A
  tumor suppressor, which inhibits CDK4/6 activity by abrogating complex formation
  with D-type cyclins (CCND). CDK4/6 inhibition causes accumulation of hypophosphorylated,
  active, RB1 tumor suppressor, which triggers G1 cell cycle arrest by forming a repressor
  complex with E2F/DP transcription factors. RB1 tumor suppressor activation also
  causes cellular senescence through a pathway that is largely E2F independent.
