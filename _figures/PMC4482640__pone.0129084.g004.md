caption: Changes in the metabolite levels in the skeletal muscle of PGC-1α-Tg mice
  and WT mice are shown. Relative metabolite changes shown in the graphs were obtained
  by CE-TOFMS (). Open bars, WT and filled bars, PGC-1α-Tg (N = 3). Data are expressed
  as the mean ± SD. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences (**p
  < 0.01, *p < 0.05). Microarray data of gene expression change of enzymes in the
  related metabolic process are shown in the scheme.
