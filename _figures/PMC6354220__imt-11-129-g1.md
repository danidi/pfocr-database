caption: Microglia and astrocytes secrete reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen
  species that damage components of the electron transport chain leading to decreased
  ATP production in neurons. Decreased lactate transporters on neurons lead to decreased
  lactate delivery, which results in less ATP production and redox capacity via decrease
  in glucose utilized in the pentose phosphate pathway and NADPH production. This
  leads to decreased glutathione recycling, and less neutralization of reactive oxygen
  species. Decreased glutamate uptake leads to calcium influx and mitochondrial damage.
  Decreased availability of ATP to power sodium/potassium pumps results in increased
  intracellular sodium leading to reverse functioning of sodium/calcium exchangers
  and increased intracellular calcium leading to further damage to mitochondria.Reproduced
  with graphics purchased from Modfolio (2018).
