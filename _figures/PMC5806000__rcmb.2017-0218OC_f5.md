caption: IL-17 signaling pathway in NTM-infected respiratory epithelium. (A) The canonical
  pathway for IL-17A signaling in airway cells at Day 3 after infection in MAC-infected
  respiratory epithelium at an MOI of 1,000. Red indicates genes that were more highly
  expressed in infected cells than in uninfected controls, and white indicates no
  gene expression. No genes were downregulated in this pathway. (B and C) IL-17A and
  MAC bacteria provoked additive induction of CCL20 and HBD-2 in respiratory epithelium
  at Day 3 after infection. IL-17A (10 ng/ml) was added to basolateral media at the
  time of infection. Total RNA was harvested from MAC-infected (MOI = 1,000) respiratory
  epithelium 3 days after infection and IL-17A addition. The mRNA levels for CCL20
  (B) and HBD-2 (C) were evaluated by real-time quantitative PCR and normalized to
  GAPDH levels. Cotreatment with IL-17A and MAC additively upregulated mRNA expression
  of CCL20 and HBD-2. Triplicate Transwells were used for each experiment, and experiments
  were repeated with cultures derived from a different NHBE cell donor. *Significant
  difference compared with cotreatment (P < 0.05, two-way ANOVA followed by post hoc
  tests). Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM.
