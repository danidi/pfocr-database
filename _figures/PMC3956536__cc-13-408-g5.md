caption: Figure 5. Schematic figure of the analyzed interactions that regulate the
  DNA damage response. DNA damage will trigger the activation of ATM, ATR and DNA-PK,
  which, in turn, phosphorylates H2AX. ATM/ATR will activate Chk1, Chk2, or p38MAPK,
  leading to S/G2-phase arrest. Chk1, Chk2, and p38MAPK inhibits cdc25C by phosphorylation,
  rendering the CyclinB1-Cdk1 complex inactive, and the cell will be restrained from
  entering M-phase. The repair mechanisms during S/G2-phase include DNA-PK and recruitment
  of the recombinase Rad51. Inhibiting ATM/ATR reduced the number of γ-H2AX immunoreactive
  Lim1+ HPCs. However, blocking the DNA damage response with ATM/ATR or DNA-PK inhibitors
  did not induce apoptosis. Furthermore, blocking ATM/ATR, DNA-PK, Chk1/2, or p38MAPK
  did not alter the number of Lim1+ HPCs cells entering M-phase. Our data indicate
  that the Lim1+ HPCs do not initiate the DNA damage response pathway during the heterogenic
  final cell cycle.
