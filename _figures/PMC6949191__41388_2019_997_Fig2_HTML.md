caption: The PI3K/AKT/SOX2 signaling axis is a conserved module in stemness, reprogramming,
  and cancer. The PI3K/AKT pathway converges extracellular stimuli conferred via respective
  receptors on the plasma membrane into downstream effector functions within the cell.
  Classical PI3K/AKT mediated phenotypes involve adapted sugar metabolism in response
  to insulin receptor stimulation (maroon) and aggravated protein synthesis in response
  to amino acid availability, as sensed by e.g., the glutamate receptor and mediated
  by the mTORC1 complex (black). Noteworthy, both PI3 and AKT kinases relate to various
  further cell biological features amongst which cell cycle control, (anti)-apoptosis,
  DNA damage response, nitric oxide signaling, and others (not depicted), while yet
  another functionality characteristic of SOX2 positive cells has been identified
  in the PI3K/AKT/SOX2 axis (blue). This signaling branch critically determines SOX2
  protein stability, nuclear localization, and DNA regulation, and thus functionally
  relates to sustained pluripotency amongst naturally occurring embryonic stem cells
  (ESCs), the conversion of terminally differentiated body cells into induced pluripotent
  stem cells (iPSCs), and furthermore critically contributes to cancer initiation,
  progression, and relapse. SOX2 has been identified as a direct target of AKT-imposed
  phosphorylation, and a functional dependence on PI3K/AKT signaling experimentally
  validated involving various inhibitory reagents (green) directed against either
  AKT or further upstream PI3K. By contrast, inhibition of downstream mTORC1 (rapamycin,
  red) does not immediately affect SOX2 protein characteristics. However, the PIK3/AKT
  pathway involves various feed-back and feed-forward regulatory loops, amongst which
  SOX2 imposed transcriptional auto-stimulation and a reciprocal induction of PI3KCA
  gene expression (dotted blue lines)
