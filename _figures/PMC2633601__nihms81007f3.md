caption: Cellular pathways targeted by drugs which induce apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected
  cells. Drugs used to induce apoptosis in HTLV-1 and ATLL cells in vitro have targeted
  various aspects of the NF-κB pathway, such as inhibition of the proteasome, inhibition
  of the IKK complex, and inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Other drugs
  have been used to target the cell cycle by stabilizing p53 or by inducing cell cycle
  arrest. Inhibitors of gene transcription have targeted STAT5 and the downregulation
  of various anti-apoptotic proteins. More recently, a number of monoclonal antibody
  therapies have targeted cell surface proteins upregulated in HTLV-1-infected cells,
  such as the IL-2 receptor, transferrin receptor, and CD52.
