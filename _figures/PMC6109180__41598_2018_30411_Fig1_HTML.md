caption: The starch biosynthesis pathway. AGPase synthesizes ADP-glucose from Glc1P
  and ATP and as a heterotetramer (L2S2) consisting of two large and two small subunits;
  AGPSS plays a catalytic function, while AGPLS is mainly responsible for modulating
  the allosteric regulatory properties of AGPase,. Amylose is mainly produced via
  the activity of GBSS. Amylopectin synthesis depends on coordinated interactions
  among at least 17 different genes encoding isoforms of SS, SBE, ISA, PUL and PHO1.
  Of these, SSI plays an important role in elongating short chains from a degree of
  polymerization (DP) of 6–7 chains at the branch point to DP 8–12 in the A or B1-chains
  of amylopectin,. SSII plays a distinct role in catalysing the formation of intermediate
  chains (usually DP 13–25) of amylopectin. SSIII mainly catalyses the synthesis of
  amylopectin B2 to B4 chains, and some of its functions overlap with those of SSII
  in amylopectin biosynthesis,. SSIV plays an essential role in the priming of starch
  granule formation, the morphology of starch granules and the degree of starch accumulation;
  moreover, its functions can be partially supported by SSIII depending on the plant
  species,. SBEI preferentially produces longer chains (B1 to B3), while SBEIIa and
  SBEIIb preferentially promote the production of short amylopectin chains (DP 6–12)
  and further impact the structure and phenotype of amylopectin during starch biosynthesis,.
  The ISAI homomultimer and/or ISAI/ISAII heteromultimer have a higher affinity for
  relatively long external branches and a greater impact on amylopectin structure,
  while ISAII may be indirectly involved in de-branching because it recognizes special
  branch points and facilitates the ability of ISAI to remove nearby branches,,. Additionally,
  ISAIII partially compensates for the function of the ISAI/ISAII heteromultimer and
  plays a major role in starch breakdown by de-branching short external chains of
  glucans as well as influencing the activity of α-amylase and β-amylase,. PUL has
  partially overlapping functions with ISA and is involved in cleaving short branched
  chains during starch biosynthesis,. Here, different colours represent different
  enzymes involved in starch synthesis. The dotted line represents the shift in the
  direction of the chain. The question mark indicates that the specific function of
  the enzyme in starch synthesis is unknown.
