caption: Simplified presentation of 13C-labeling patterns of metabolites from incubation
  of cells with [2-13C]glucose representing the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glycolysis,
  and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity. The circles symbolize the carbon backbone
  of the molecules. Dark grey circles mark the position of the label resulting from
  the PPP. Filled circles indicate that all the molecules are labeled in the position
  indicated. Half-filled circles indicate that 50% of the molecules formed are labeled
  in that position. Grey crosses mark the position of the label resulting from glycolysis.
  Complete crosses indicate that all the molecules are labeled in the position indicated.
  Demi-crosses indicate that half of the molecules are labeled in that position. Panel
  A displays glycolysis (right) and the PPP (left). Panel B displays labeling from
  acetyl CoA derived from either PPP or glycolysis in TCA cycle metabolites and glutamate
  and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA). Small circles indicate the molecules that are formed
  from the second turn of the TCA cycle. For simplicity, glyco-phosphates are not
  included, and only condensation of oxaloacetate with unlabeled acetyl CoA is shown
  for the second turn. α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; G-3-P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
