caption: A working model of the thioredoxin signaling pathway. Accordingly to a model
  proposed by Ross and colleagues (), in the course of H2O2 detoxification by the
  thioredoxin peroxidase Tsa1, the cytoplasmic thioredoxin Trx2 is oxidized. Our results
  demonstrate that the cytoplasmic thioredoxins are specifically required to trigger
  the nuclear localization of Msn2/4 and Maf1, effectors of the general response to
  stress, in the presence of H2O2. The signaling pathways, which appear to be different
  for each transcription factor, do not require a downregulation of the PKA activity.
  In addition, Maf1 nuclear accumulation correlates with the PP2A-depend accumulation
  of the hypophosphorylated form of the protein. “X” is an unknown phosphatase, which
  is required for Msn2/4 dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation.
