caption: 'SNO profile of cell death network in Chagas disease (ChD). PBMC SNO proteome
  of ChD clinically asymptomatic (ChD CA, n = 25) and ChD clinically symptomatic (ChD
  CS, n = 28) patients and of normal healthy controls (NH, n = 30) was developed as
  described in section Materials and Methods. The RoR values for protein spots that
  were differentially SNO-modified (normalized to change in protein abundance) at
  p-value of <0.05 were uploaded in the ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software,
  and proteins that changed in RoR at fold change: |≥ 1.2| were included in biological
  modeling by IPA. Shown are molecules that are predicted to be associated with cell
  death and that were significantly changed in RoR values in (A) ChD CA patients vs.
  NH controls, (B) ChD CS patients vs. NH controls, and (C) ChD CS vs. ChD CA patients.
  In the networks, the intensity of red and green colors show the extent of decrease
  and increase in protein SNO modification, respectively. Brownish orange node/lines
  and blue node/lines show predicted activation and inhibition, respectively, of a
  pathway. Gray and yellow lines are used when the putative effect is not completely
  understood.'
