caption: Signaling pathway of PPARγ. PPARγ can be activated either by its ligands,
  which bind to the LBD domain, or by the kinase-mediated phosphorylation of its A/B
  domain. Primed PPARγ can recruit another nuclear receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR),
  to form a heterodimer and then bind to the peroxisome proliferator response elements
  (PPREs) in the promoter regions of the target genes. PPARγ can also recruit coactivator
  proteins, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α),
  or corepressor proteins, such as nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1), to activate
  or repress the transcription of direct target genes in the absence of ligands.
