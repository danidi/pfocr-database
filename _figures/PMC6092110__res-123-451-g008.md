number: Figure 8
caption: Schematic illustration of Dkk3 (dickkopf-3)/CXCR7-mediated Sca-1+ progenitor
  migration. The figure depicts the molecular mechanism involved in Sca-1 (stem cell
  antigen-1)+ progenitor migration induced by Dkk3 binding to CXCR7. Dkk3 present
  in the cell environment binds to CXCR7 expressed on the surface of Sca-1+ progenitors.
  On CXCR7 activation, ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2)-signaling
  pathway is activated. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 either activates Rac1 (Ras-related C3
  botulinum toxin substrate 1) or directly modulates cytoskeleton rearrangement to
  promote cell migration. Rac1 activation also results from Dkk3 binding to CXCR7,
  which in turn directly regulates cell migration or stimulates ERK phosphorylation.
  Rac1 and ERK1/2 seem to work in a feedback manner. The Dkk3/CXCR7 axis promotes
  AKT phosphorylation via PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), which leads to cytoskeleton
  rearrangement. RhoA (Ras homolog gene family, member A) activation level is increased
  in response to Dkk3 binding to CXCR7, leading to MLC (myosin light chain) phosphorylation
  either directly or via ROCK (Rho-associated protein kinase) activation. MLC activation
  results in actomyosin contraction required for cell migration.
