caption: Putative mechanisms by which TWEAK–Fn14 system inhibits skeletal muscle oxidative
  phosphorylation capacity. TWEAK/Fn14 system activates canonical NF-κB signaling
  pathway, which represses PGC-1α levels in skeletal muscle. This leads to reduced
  expression of several mitochondrial genes and proportion of type I fibers. TWEAK
  also decreases the expression of miR-206, a positive regulator of type I fibers.
  TWEAK, TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis; Fn14, fibroblast growth factor inducible
  14; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kappa B; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma
  coactivator 1α; miR-206, microRNA-206.
