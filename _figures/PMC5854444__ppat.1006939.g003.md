caption: 'Schematic of central carbon metabolism in Mtb highlighting genes with statistically
  significant differences in transposon insertion count between clinical strains and
  the reference strain H37Rv. Metabolites are represented by dots; enzymes are represented
  by diamonds and gene abbreviations are shown next to the reactions they catalyze.
  Diamonds with blue fill indicates at least one clinical strain has significantly
  more transposon insertions across the corresponding gene(s) as compared to H37Rv;
  red fill indicates at least one clinical strain has significantly fewer transposon
  insertions across the gene(s) as compared to H37Rv. Heatmaps show log2 fold-change
  in transposon insertion count for this set of genes across all strains as indicated
  by the color scale; asterisk indicates statistical significance (Benjamini-Hochberg
  adjusted P < 0.05, fold-change ≥ 2 or ≤-2). Metabolite abbreviations: ACCOA, acetyl-CoA;
  ASP, aspartate; CIT, citrate; DHP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; FUM, fumarate; G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; GLUC, glucose; GLX, glyoxylate; GLYC, glycerol;
  ICIT, isocitrate/citrate; MAL, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate; OXG, 2-oxoglutarate; PEP,
  phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, pyruvate; SUC, succinate; SUCCOA, succinyl-CoA. The metabolic
  pathway schematic was generated with Omix [].'
