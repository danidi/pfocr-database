caption: 'Proposed mechanism for α-MG action against fat infiltration of the liver.
  High fat diet in an obesity setting, leads to overload of FFAs in hepatocytes. Consequently,
  there occurs increased ROS production and lipid peroxidation in the liver, which
  further damage the antioxidant enzymes and mitochondria. Mitochondrial damage leads
  to cyt c and Ca2+ release from mitochondria, thereafter cyt c binds to Apaf-1 and
  activates apoptosis via caspases 9 and 3 factors. Apoptosis implies rapid death
  of hepatocytes hence reduced clearance of fat deposits. On the other hand, mitochondrial
  damage in turn leads to a decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity, including
  β-oxidation and ATP production, resulting in TG accumulation in the liver. α-MG
  limits hepatic TG accumulation through enhanced anti-oxidative capacity and hepatic
  mitochondrial oxidative metabolic capacity and inhibition of mitochondrial pathway
  of apoptosis, which may confer decreased hepatic steatosis risk. ROS: reactive oxygen
  species; Ca2+ : calcium ; cyt c : cytochrome c ; TG: triglyceride'
