caption: Meningitic E. coli penetration of the BBB follows the microbial-host interactions
  contributing to HBMEC invasion, via exploiting specific host cell signaling molecules.
  During the HBMEC invasion, meningitic E. coli strains activate SphK2, which catalyzes
  the synthesis of S1P from sphingosine. S1P is then secreted outside and acts on
  S1P receptor S1P2. S1P interaction with S1P2 is involved in the activation of EGFR,
  as well as the up-regulation and release of EGFR-related ligand HB-EGF, which is
  proteolytically processed by metalloproteinases. The released HB-EGF binds to the
  extracellular ligand-binding domain of EGFR and leads to tyrosine phosphorylation
  of the EGFR cytoplasmic kinase domain. This SphK2-S1P-S1P2-EGFR cascade induces
  the activation of c-Src tyrosine kinase, an intracellular mediator that has been
  shown to regulate host cell actin cytoskeleton rearrangements, leading to E. coli
  invasion of HBMEC.
