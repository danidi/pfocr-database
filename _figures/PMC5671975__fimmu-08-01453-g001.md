caption: Proposed concurrent pathways of activation of effector CD4+CD25−FOXP3−T cells
  and CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ tTreg cells in parasite-infected hosts immunized with myelin
  basic protein (MBP) and complete Freund’s adjuvant to induce experimental autoimmune
  encephalomyelitis (EAE). Upper section shows response to parasites and lower section
  response to MBP. Effector CD4+ T cells with TCR that recognize the parasite antigens
  are predominantly activated to a type-2 response, with initial production of interleukin
  (IL)-4, then IL-5. Some Th1 and Th17 cells are activated by the parasites. IL-4
  has two effects on tTreg. First, it polyclonally activates them like IL-2. Second,
  tTreg with TCR specific to the immunizing antigen are activated by IL-4 to proliferate
  and express IL-5Rα. CD4+ effector T cells that recognize autoantigen are activated
  to mainly Th1 and Th17 cells with a smaller T helper 2 (Th2) response. IL-2 also
  has two effects on tTreg. First, it both polyclonally expands them. Second, tTreg
  with receptor for autoantigen are activated to express receptors for Type-1 cytokines
  IFN-γ and IL-12 (pathway not illustrated here). These antigen-specific Th1-activated
  Treg usually control immune inflammation and lead to clinical recovery of EAE. The
  pathway we propose mediates the effect of parasite infection on EAE is induced by
  type-2 responses. IL-4 activates tTreg with TCR for autoantigen to expand and express
  IL-5Rα. These antigen-specific Treg suppress specific Th1 and Th17 responses, thus
  further polarizing the response to Th2 (). Further stimulation with both specific
  antigen and IL-5, not IL-4, induces them to proliferate and differentiate into highly
  potent antigen-specific Th2-like Treg that inhibit the autoimmune response. Our
  hypothesis is that type-2 response to the parasite infection produces excess IL-4
  and IL-5 that as a bystander effect promotes expansion of autoantigen-specific Treg
  that are dependent on IL-5 for their survival.
