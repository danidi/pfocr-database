caption: Different members of different tick protein families target the same host
  immune function, or the same protein targets different modules of the host immune
  response. (A) By inhibiting different immune cell-derived proteases with specific
  inhibitors, Ixodes spp. ticks can block multiple defense mechanisms. The anti-inflammatory
  serpin IRS-2 (Ixodes ricinus serpin-2) inhibits mast cell chymase and neutrophil
  cathepsin G. Both proteases are known to be involved in promoting inflammation.
  The second of the three major neutrophil serine proteases involved in inflammatory
  responses, elastase, is inhibited by another serpin, Iris (Ixodes ricinus immunosuppressor).
  Sialostatin L and L2 are inhibitors of the intracellular cysteine proteases cathepsin
  L and cathepsin S that contribute to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the production
  of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 in macrophages
  and dendritic cells (DCs). (B) The cystatin from Ixodes scapularis, sialostatin
  L, was shown to inhibit production of proinflammatory cytokines from DCs, the proliferation
  of T cells, and the production of IL-9 from Th9 cells and mast cells. Another member
  of an I. scapularis protein family, Salp (Salivary protein) 15, inhibited proliferation
  of T cells and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines from DCs. Finally, the
  tick salivary serpin Iris also inhibited T cell proliferation. (C) Redundant inhibition
  of different modules of the interferon-β (IFN-β) signaling pathway by two members
  of the same multigenic family. Sialostatin L, unlike sialostatin L2, inhibits IFN-β
  production by DCs. Sialostatin L2, however, inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT-3
  in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and subsequent expression of several genes downstream
  from IFN-β-dependent DC activation.
