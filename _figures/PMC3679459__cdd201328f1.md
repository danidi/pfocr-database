caption: The TRAIL apoptotic pathway. Simplified and schematic representation of the
  pathway. Binding of TRAIL or generated agonistic agents to the TRAIL receptors results
  in the recruitment of FADD and procaspase-8, also known as the DISC. Subsequently,
  caspase-8 cleavage in the DISC can activate downstream caspase-3, leading to the
  induction of apoptosis (extrinsic pathway). The caspase-8 analog cFLIP can compete
  for FADD binding and inhibit DISC formation. Caspase-8 can also cleave the Bcl-2
  family member Bid into tBid engaging the intrinsic pathway by binding to Bax, causing
  mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the release of apoptogenic factors such
  as cytochrome c. Pro-survival Bcl-2 family members can prevent mitochondrial permeabilization.
  IAPs, such as XIAP, can bind to caspases and inhibit apoptosis. Necroptosis, a regulated
  form of caspase-independent necrotic cell death, can also be activated through TRAIL
  receptors under specific conditions. This involves the activation of RIP1 and RIP3
  in a complex that has not been precisely clarified as yet. See text for more details
