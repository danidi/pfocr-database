caption: Downstream signaling pathways of the ANG1-7/Mas pathway in non-epithelial
  lung cell types. In lung fibroblasts (Left), ANG1-7/Mas protects against bleomycin-induced
  lung fibrosis by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/NF-κB pathway.
  Fibroblast migration (middle) was prevented by inhibition of the RhoA/Rho kinase
  pathway. Ovalbumin-induced infiltration of lung tissues by eosinophils, lymphocytes
  and neutrophils (Right) were prevented by ANG1-7 through suppression of ERK1/2.
  Parentheses indicate key references. PM - plasma membrane.
