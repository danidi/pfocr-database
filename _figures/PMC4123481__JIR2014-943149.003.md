caption: Role of STAT1 and STAT3 in Foxp3 expression and cytokine production in Tregs.
  SOCS1 protects Tregs from harmful effects of inflammatory cytokines, which promote
  the loss of Foxp3 expression and the conversion into Th1- and Th17-like effector
  cells. Hyperactivation of IFN-γ-STAT1 pathway results in the loss of Foxp3 expression
  and hyperproduction of IFN-γ. Although STAT3 is not directly involved in Foxp3 expression
  maintenance, it may be crucial for suppression of the production of IL-17. SOCS1-deficient
  Tregs may expand faster due to hyperactivation of STAT5.
