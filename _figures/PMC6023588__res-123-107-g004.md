caption: 'Metabolic mechanisms of exercise-induced cardiac growth. A, During exercise,
  changes in cardiac workload, circulating substrates, and hormones influence cardiac
  metabolism. The catabolic pathways invoked and the degree by which cardiac metabolism
  changes are dependent on the type and duration of exercise. B, Metabolic mechanisms
  that integrate to promote cardiac growth: exercise may diminish the activity phosphofructokinase
  (PFK), which leads to diminished glucose catabolism (ie, decreased glycolysis and
  glucose oxidation). In the exercise-adapted, resting state, glucose catabolism appears
  elevated above the untrained state. Such periodicity in glucose metabolism seems
  to regulate the exercise gene program, that is, by decreasing Cebpb expression and
  augmenting levels of Cited4. In addition, the metabolic periodicity caused by exercise
  may influence mitochondrial dynamics and help maintain healthy pools of mitochondria.
  The PFK step of glycolysis is important for coordinating the activity of ancillary
  biosynthetic pathways, which not only provide material causes for cardiac growth
  but may also influence the epigenetic landscape. Changes in the intracellular abundance
  of metabolites such as AMP and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) may directly activate key
  kinases involved in cardiac adaptation. Also, circulating metabolites [eg, palmitoleate
  (C16:1n7)] may activate signaling pathways that promote cardiac growth. 3PG indicates
  3-phosphoglycerate; F-1,6-BP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  FFA, free fatty acids; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; GLP, glycero(phospho)lipid
  synthesis pathway; HBP, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; and SBP, serine biosynthesis
  pathway. Illustration credit: Ben Smith.'
