caption: (A) The role of Notch ligand (Dll4) on a mycobacterium-induced granuloma
  model. In vivo granuloma formation induced by bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)/mycobacterium
  antigen demonstrates larger granuloma formation in anti-Dll4 antibody-treated mice
  with decreased numbers of Th17 cells and mDCs and an increased number of macrophages
  (MΦ) in the lungs when compared with lung granulomas from mice treated with control
  antibody. The decreased expression of Dll4 led to the abrogation of the Th17 phenotype
  in the anti-Dll4 antibody-treated mice with a concomitant increase in granuloma
  size. The TLR9 signaling pathway, through MyD88 on DCs, plays a central role by
  up-regulating Dll4 and Th17-related cytokines, including IL-17, IL-6, IL-23(p19/p40),
  and TNF-α, in response to Mycobacterium antigens. IT, Intratracheal; IV, i.v.; IP,
  i.p.; PPD, mycobacteria-derived, purified protein derivative; mDC, myeloid DC. (B)
  The role of the Notch ligand (Dll1) on the influenza virus H1N1 infection model.
  Macrophages play an important role in regulating IFN-γ production from CD4+ and
  CD8+ T cells through a RIG-I-induced type-I IFN-dependent pathway (including the
  JAK-STAT pathway), which up-regulates the Notch ligand Dll1. Our in vivo influenza
  H1N1 infectious model demonstrates higher mortality and impaired viral clearance
  in anti-Dll1antibody-treated mice with decreased IFN-γ production when compared
  with control IgG-treated mice. IN, Intranasal.
