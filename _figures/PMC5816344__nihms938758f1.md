caption: Schematic illustration of the basic humoral and cellular elements that evoke
  tumour cytolysis in the context of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based cancer immunotherapy.
  Direct tumour cell elimination is achieved by (i) complement-dependent cytotoxicity
  (CDC) and (ii) antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent
  phagocytosis elicited upon targeting of tumour antigens by clinically available
  therapeutic mAbs. Tumour-targeted mAbs known to elicit complement-mediated cytolytic
  responses include the anti-CD20 mAbs rituximab and ofatumumab in B cell lymphomas
  and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Targeting of tumour cells by therapeutic mAbs
  triggers complement activation via the classical pathway. Binding of C1q to the
  Fc portion of these antibodies leads to the assembly of the active C1 complex (C1q,
  C1r and C1s), which acquires proteolytic activity over complement components, initiating
  the cascade. Complement activation leads to tumour cell opsonization by C3-derived
  opsonins (C3b, iC3b and C3dg) and the generation of potent pro-inflammatory mediators
  (C3a and C5a), which in turn recruit and activate immune cells with phagocytic properties
  (neutrophils and macrophages). Downstream activation of terminal complement components
  results in the assembly of the pore-forming membrane attack complex (MAC), or C5b–C9,
  on the tumour cell membrane. The anaphylatoxin C5a is known to upregulate activating
  Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) on phagocytic cells, priming them for enhanced phagocytosis
  and increasing the magnitude of the tumour cytolytic response. C3-derived fragments
  (C3b, iC3b and C3dg) on tumour cells bind to CR3 and/or CR4 complement receptors
  on phagocytes, thus augmenting the FcγR-dependent phagocytic uptake of opsonized
  tumour cells.
