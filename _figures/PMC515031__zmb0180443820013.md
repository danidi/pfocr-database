caption: Src-induced phosphorylation of FAK coordinates adhesion dynamics, cell migration,
  survival, and anchorage-independent growth. A model proposing Src-induced tyrosine
  phosphorylation of FAK as a crucial event at adhesion sites that coordinates multiple
  cellular processes is shown. Src-induced phosphorylation of FAK is required for
  rapid actin stress fiber assembly and focal adhesion formation that promote initial
  cell adhesion and spreading, events that are in part mediated by calpain activity.
  Src-induced phosphorylation of FAK also promotes focal adhesion turnover and motility
  of cells via activation of calpain, most likely by linking calpain to upstream regulation
  by the ERK/MAPK pathway. v-Src-induced phosphorylation of FAK also promotes cell
  survival and anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells by substituting for
  integrin-derived growth and survival signals that are normally induced in response
  to cell-ECM adhesion and associated actin remodeling. These signals are likely to
  involve activation of PI 3-K/Akt, STAT3, and c-Myc, which have previously been identified
  as downstream mediators of both Src and FAK and are implicated in cell survival
  and anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells.
