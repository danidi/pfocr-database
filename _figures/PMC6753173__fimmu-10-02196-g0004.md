caption: A schematic diagram of pathogen-derived molecules used to escape intracellular
  DNA sensing pathways. The primary sensor of cytoplasmic DNA is cGAS, which is responsible
  for activating the binding protein STING. Pathogen-mediated degradation targets
  cGAS to prevent it from binding to DNA or to inhibit its catalytic activity. At
  the same time, pathogen invaders also degrade cGAMP and bacterial circulating dinucleotides.
  IFI16 positively affects the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Other DNA sensors,
  such as DAI and AIM2, are also viral factors that block DNA binding and downstream
  pathway activation. Viral proteolytic enzymes can decompose and degrade these factors;
  blocking their translocation and preventing their interaction from the downstream
  signaling protein TBK1, thus hindering STING function.
