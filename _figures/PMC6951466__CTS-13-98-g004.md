caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)‐based plausibility analysis of candidate
  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). (a) Gene functions potentially relevant
  to bone tissue remodeling and modification by hormonal and metabolic factors. The
  network was created using IPA knowledge base and IPA core analysis tool and was
  based on known gene/protein interactions of the genes harboring candidate SNPs.
  The demonstrated gene/protein‐related functions and conditions (with P values ranging
  from 8.15E‐09 to 1.03E‐05) were selected based on their possible relevance to bone
  tissue changes and metabolism. Different molecule shapes reflect IPA labels for
  different gene categories; the arrowed dash lines point at the pathways associated
  with individual genes/proteins. GNAS‐related functions and conditions are highlighted
  in blue. (b) Gene pathways potentially relevant to bone tissue remodeling and modification
  by hormonal and metabolic factors. The network was created using IPA knowledge base
  and IPA core analysis, which was based on known interactions of the genes harboring
  candidate SNPs. The demonstrated canonical pathways (CP), biomarker (BM) functions,
  or toxicological (Tx) processes were selected based on their possible relevance
  to bone tissue changes and metabolism. Different molecule shapes reflect IPA labels
  for gene/chemical categories. Solid and dash lines reflect direct and indirect interactions,
  respectively; arrows indicate the direction of interactions, such as activation
  or inhibition. As an identified upstream regulator, beta‐estradiol is capable of
  regulating expression of almost all network genes (except GNAS) as its downstream
  targets. A more detailed analysis of GNAS interactions (as highlighted in blue)
  shows that GNAS is interconnected with both shown lipid species and is particularly
  capable of affecting cholesterol levels. GNAS and ADRB2 proteins are known to interact
  directly, and ADRB2 is capable of regulating GNAS protein expression, activation,
  and localization as well as GNAS binding to GTP. In addition to being part of cAMP/G‐protein
  coupled receptor signaling, GNAS is connected to metabolic (PPARα/RXRα activation)
  and male sex hormone‐related regulation (androgen signaling) as well as to proinflammatory
  cytokine‐mediated pathways (signaling in macrophages). ADRB2, β2‐adrenergic receptor
  2; LEPR, leptin receptor.
