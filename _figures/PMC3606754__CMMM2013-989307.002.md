caption: STRING analysis of the relationship between genes. The network nodes represent
  the proteins encoded by the genes. Seven different colored lines link a number of
  nodes and represent seven types of evidence used in predicting associations. Among
  these significant genes, VWA7, PRRC2A, and ABHD16A were not identified. A red line
  indicates the presence of fusion evidence; a green line represents neighborhood
  evidence; a blue line represents cooccurrence evidence; a purple line represents
  experimental evidence; a yellow line represents text mining evidence; a light blue
  line represents database evidence [, ] and a black line represents coexpression
  evidence.
