caption: Ivermectin induces P2X4/P2X7-dependent activation of Pannexin-1 channels
  and release of ATP. The release of ATP might be transiently protective, but only
  in cell types that are highly sensitive to Ivermectin-induces cell swelling when
  ATP and Ca2+signaling are essential for control of cell volume. In cancer cells
  where no cell size changes can be observed (for example human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells),
  high concentrations of ATP (1–3 mM) immediately enhance Ivermectin cytotoxicity.
  Potentiated P2X7 receptor signaling drives a fast progressing necrotic/pyroptotic
  mechanism driven by NADPH oxidases-generated ROS, cytosolic Ca2+/CaMKII activation,
  and MPTP, and characterized by caspase-1 cleavage, due to possible NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. Necrotic killing is followed by a slower progressing apoptotic cell
  death program mediated by caspase-3 activation. The failure of the default apoptotic
  pathway might be attributed to faster activation of caspase-1, inadequate autophagic
  control of mitochondrial MPTP, collapse of cellular energy metabolism, resulting
  in rapid progression of necrotic cell death. Damage to mitochondria and ER stress
  as well as potential depletion of cellular ATP reserves simultaneously promote autophagy
  that might render even the slower apoptotic pathway immunogenic.
