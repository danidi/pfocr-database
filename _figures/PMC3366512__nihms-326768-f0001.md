caption: 'The four-step synthesis first involves the conversion of a guanosine derivative
  to an unstable intermediate, precursor Z, through the action of the enzymes MoaC
  and MoaA. The heterotetrameric enzyme molybdopterin synthase (MoaD2: MoaE2) then
  incorporates sulfur from the C-terminal thiocarboxylate of MoaE onto precursor Z
  to form the dithiolene group of molybdopterin (, , ). The incorporation of molybdenum
  into molybdopterin to form Moco requires the proteins MogA and MoeA (). On the last
  step, a GMP group is transferred to the terminal phosphate of Moco by the product
  of the gene mobA (–) to form MGD.'
