caption: Scheme depicting the mechanism underlying mitofilin knockdown-induced increase
  in cell death by apoptosis. Mitofilin knockdown by siRNA in cultured H9c2 myoblasts
  and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells induces mitochondrial structural degradation
  that causes the reduction of ATP production and dissipation of membrane potential.
  Disruption of mitochondrial cristae promotes the release of apoptosis-inducing factor
  (AIF) from mitochondria into the cytosol. AIF interacting with poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase (PARP) facilitates translocation into the nucleus, and together with
  the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in response to the increase in calpain
  activity are responsible for the DNA condensation and fragmentation that causes
  cell cycle arrest and subsequent apoptosis by a caspase 3-independent pathway. On
  the other hand, PARP is released into the cytosol and translocates into mitochondria
  causing Ca2+ dysregulation. The increase in intramitochondrial Ca2+, together with
  the increase in ROS production in the electron transport chain (ETC) and dissipation
  of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) caused by an increase in calpain activity
  results in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, which
  promotes cell death. Note that the increase in intracellular Ca2+ may also potentiate
  the activation of calpain catalytic activity to promote more AIF release and ROS
  production that will exacerbate this harmful mechanism.
