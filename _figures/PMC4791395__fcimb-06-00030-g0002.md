caption: Strategies of Brucella to evade the innate and adaptive immunity. Brucella
  Btp1/TcpB is proposed to act in host cytosol where it interferes with TLR signaling
  pathway and facilitates ubiquitination and degradation of Mal which in turn inhibits
  TLR2 and TLR4 pathway, resulting in inhibition of NF-κB secretion and lymphocyte
  activation. On the other hand, the antigen loading compartment, comprised of Br-LPS
  and MHC class II molecules, is capable of interacting with functional microdomain
  which result in lymphocyte activation and inhibition of OVA presentation to CD4+
  T cells. Straight arrows indicate the innate immunity pathways while dashed arrows
  are related to adaptive immunity pathways.
