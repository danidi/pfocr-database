caption: Potential signaling pathways activated by H2S leading to tissue protection
  during ischemia–reperfusion injury. Possible signaling cascades affected by H2S
  that are involved in the tissue-protective effects of H2S. H2S can activate KATP
  channels via direct interaction with the extracellular N terminal of the rvSUR1
  subunit. H2S can activate the Akt pathway, further inducing nuclear-factor-E2–related
  factor 2 (Nrf-2) nuclear translocation, resulting in increased cell protection.
  H2S may cause an inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production through nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB)–dependent pathways, leading to tissue protection. (To see this
