caption: Diagram illustrating the diagnostic features of cutaneous melanoma and uveal
  melanoma. Although both melanomas arise from melanocytes, each one shows its own
  characteristics while sharing the feature of an altered MAP kinase signalling pathway.
  Presently, these abnormalities are one of the most promising targets of the treatment
  of these patients, such as the inhibition of B-RAF for cutaneous melanoma. Nevertheless,
  as illustrated in the diagram, the mutations that activate this pathway differ and
  are accompanied by another set of modifications that are also different. In the
  case of uveal melanoma, these mutations serve to classify tumours into subtypes
  according to their molecular profile. The four mutations described are mutually
  exclusive. This molecular classification is also associated with metastasis risk
  and disease prognosis. The spread of both tumours also differs as cutaneous melanomas
  usually spread via the lymph while uveal melanomas usually spread via the bloodstream.
  Uveal melanoma exhibits a high predisposition to spread to the liver, which occurs
  in 90% of cases. By contrast, cutaneous melanoma may metastasize to the lungs, brain,
  lymph nodes and soft tissues with almost equal probability. Cytogenetic aberrations
  are also common in both types of melanoma, although these also differ. GNA, G protein
  subunit alpha; EIF1AX, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A X-linked; SF3B1,
  splicing factor 3b subunit 1; SRSF2, serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2;
  BAP1, BRCA-associated protein 1.
