caption: A schematic drawing illustrating the mechanism of spermatid movement along
  Sertoli cells in the seminiferous epithelium via a cascade of biological events.
  Spermiation occurs at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle, which coincides with the
  time for the passage of preleptoene spermatocytes (PS) across the BTB. During these
  cellular events, the different cascades of biological events (see the numbers in
  the figure) happen in a highly regulated manner. We hypothesize that germ cell movement
  involves the continuous disassembly and reassembly of Sertoli–Sertoli and Sertoli–germ
  cell junctions. These require the presence of cytokines (e.g. TNFα and TGF-β3) and
  proteases to perturb the junctions by lowering the steady-state protein level of
  several integral TJ and AJ proteins. Protein kinases and protein phosphatases also
  mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of the AJ (cadherin/catenin/CK2/cSrc) and FAC-like
  (integrin/laminin/FAK/cSrc) adhesion complex or an induction of cofilin and/or gelsolin.
  The net result of these changes leads to a weakening of adhesion complexes at the
  basal and apical ES. A transient disengagement between TJ and AJ via peripheral
  adaptors, such as ZO-1 and catenins, is used to preserve the BTB integrity when
  AJ is perturbed. To assist spermatid movement, upward traction force is generated
  by the motor proteins, such as myosin VIIa and dynein, at both the apical and basal
  ES, involving GTPases. Prior to spermiation, integral membrane junction proteins
  such as nectin-2 and nectin-3 may be internalized by both apical and basal TBC to
  facilitate the depletion of elongate spermatid (ES) from the epithelium (i.e. spermiation)
  and the passage of PS across the BTB. Recently, it has been speculated that cleavage
  of laminin at the apical ES by MMPs can assist the ‘opening’ of BTB via a yet-to-be
  identified signaling pathway. This model was prepared based on recent findings in
  the field (see text). SC Nucleus, Sertoli cell nucleus.
