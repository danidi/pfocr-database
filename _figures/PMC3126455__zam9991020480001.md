caption: 'Proposed model of starch and cellulose degradation, H2 production, and ATP
  synthesis in Pyrococcus and Thermococcus (based partly on references , , and ).
  The redox balance and ATP produced is per glucose molecule. The proteins are as
  follows: 1, β-1,4-endoglucanase; 2, cellobiose ABC transporter; 3, β-endoglucanase;
  4, β-glucosidase; 5, amylopullulanase; 6, maltose ABC transporter; 7, cyclomaltodextrin
  glucanotransferase; 8, cyclomaltodextrin ABC transporter; 9, cyclomaltodextrinase;
  10, α-amylase; 11, α-glucosidase; 12, α-glucan phosphorylase; 13, ADP-dependent
  hexokinase; 14, modified Embden-Meyerhof pathway; 15, pyruvate oxidoreductase; 16,
  acetyl-CoA synthetase; 17, hydrogenase; 18, Na+-translocating ATP synthase. Fd,
  electron carrier ferredoxin.'
