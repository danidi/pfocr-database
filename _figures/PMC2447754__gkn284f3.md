caption: Differential Reaction Content Visualizer applied to the biotin metabolism
  for the Corynebacteria C. jeikeium (cjk) and C. diphtheriae (cdi) in the first set
  compared against C. glutamicum (Kyowa Hakko) (cgl), C. efficiens (cef) and C. glutamicum
  (Bielefeld) (cgb) in the second set. For each box containing an EC number a tooltip
  lists all KEGG reactions associated to the respective EC number and all organisms
  this reaction is annotated for. Red organisms belong to set one and blue organisms
  to set two.
