caption: Classical and alternative NF-κB pathways in skeletal cells. The classical
  pathway is activated by many extracellular signals, and requires IKKβ and IKKγ/NEMO
  to phosphorylate IκBα, leading to its degradation by the proteosome. The nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB, predominantly p65/p50 dimers, has rapid (minutes) and transient
  kinetics. The effects of classical pathway activation, discussed in subsequent sections
  of this Review, are to increase OC survival, decrease OB maturation and function,
  and increase chondrocyte hypertrophy. In skeletal cells, the only established activator
  of the alternative NF-κB pathway is RANKL. The regulatory kinase is NIK, which activates
  IKKα, leading to processing of p100 to p52 via the proteosome. The nuclear translocation
  of RelB/p52 dimers is slow (hours) and sustained, and contributes to OC differentiation.
