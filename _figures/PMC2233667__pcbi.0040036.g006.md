caption: The metabolic pathway in G. sulfurreducens after the refinement of the network
  based on the comparison of the in silico predictions with the physiological data
  from the mutant strains is shown. The underlined reactions represent cases for which
  the maximum allowed flux was constrained to the wild type levels. The boxes around
  the enzyme names highlight those proteins that were eliminated. The reactions with
  the “X” are constrained to have zero flux. Abbreviations are explained in .
