caption: Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the DC maturation process. Following
  a microbial encounter, immature DCs undergo actin cytoskelton rearrangements (which
  induce downregulation of the phagocytic activity) and increase the efficiency of
  antigen processing and presentation to prime T cells. Moreover, activated DCs express,
  with strictly defined kinetics, cytokines and chemokines for activation and control
  of innate and acquired immune responses. Among the cytokines produced by early activated
  DCs, IL-2 plays a key role. At early time points, it helps to activate NK cells
  (IL-2 pathway, see Figure ). At later time points, when DCs have not yet reached
  the final stage of maturation and still express low levels of costimulatory molecules
  and peptide–MHC complexes at the cell surface, DC-derived IL-2 cooperates in the
  activation of T-cell responses (late adaptive response). The possibility that IL-2
  can also act on DC in an autocrine fashion cannot be excluded.
