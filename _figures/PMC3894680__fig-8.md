caption: Intracellular GSH sources and effects of CO treatment on RBC thiol homeostasis.
  (A) Sources of GSH. Besides de novo synthesis, GSH content can be regulated by the
  reduction of GSSG, dependent on glutathione reductase (GR) and mediated by the PPP
  oxidative branch or by protein de-glutathionylation, that is, the release of GSH
  from mixed disulfides formed with redox-sensitive Cys residues of proteins (P-S-SG).
  Deglutathionylation may be achieved by changes in the intracellular redox status
  (increase in reduced thiols, changes in GSH/GSSG ratio, and thiol-disulphide exchange
  with GSH) or by enzymatic reduction mediated by glutaredoxin (Grx), GR, the thioredoxin/thioredoxin
  reductase (Trx/TrxR) system, and/or sulfiredoxin (Srx). (B) Mechanisms hypothesized
  to contribute to the CO-dependent GSH increase in RBCs. The major mechanism hypothesized
  is Hb deglutathionylation mediated mainly by conformational changes induced by CO
  binding and, to a lesser extent, by the de-glutathionylating activity of GR. The
  latter contribution might be supported by a minor mechanism linked to the activation
  of PPP (gray pathway) and boosted by the binding of COHb to the RBC membrane. COHb,
  being in a relaxed conformation similar to the oxygenated form, does not trigger
  glycolysis (black pathway) even when bound to the cell membrane. Indeed, GAPDH,
  and presumably the other GE (phosphofructokinase, aldolase, piruvate kinase, and
  lactate dehydrogenase), are not released in their activated form into the RBC cytoplasm
  from Band 3, their membrane binding dock. Its metabolic consumption by the glycolytic
  pathway being prevented, glucose is then forced to enter PPP, similar to what occurs
  in RBCs under high oxygen saturation conditions (). The increased NADPH production
  might support the activation of GR, which reduces GSSG and promotes Hb deglutathionylation.
