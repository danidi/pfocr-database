caption: Anti-inflammatory strategies of alveolar macrophages favoring tissue damage
  control. Removal of apoptotic cells by Aφs (efferocytosis) leads to the secretion
  of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1),
  prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and platelet-activating factor (PAF), which in turn suppress
  the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and leukotriene C4. During
  phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or in response to inflammation-associated cytokines,
  Aφs also release insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Binding of IGF-1 to its receptor
  on epithelial cells changes their phagocytosis pattern. Epithelial cells reduce
  the clearance of apoptotic cells while increasing the uptake of anti-inflammatory
  macrophage-derived microvesicles containing suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins
  (SOCS). Contact-dependent intercellular communication between Aφs and epithelial
  cells, using connexin 43 (Cx43)-containing gap junction channels, leads to synchronized
  calcium waves, using the epithelium as the conducting pathway and drives anti-inflammatory
  actions. Finally, Aφs promote the differentiation of regulatory T cells to further
  control inflammation.
