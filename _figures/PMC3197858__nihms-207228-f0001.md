caption: 'Glucose is taken up into cells and is converted into pyruvate via anaerobic
  glycolysis. Pyruvate in turn is converted into citrate in the mitochondria via Krebs
  cycle to generate ATP. Excess citrate is metabolized to acetyl-CoA, which enters
  the lipogenesis pathway, ultimately leading to production of long-chain acyl-CoA.ACACA:
  Acetyl co-enzyme A carboxylase; ACLY: ATP citrate lyase; ACS: Acyl co-enzyme A synthetase;
  CoA: Co-enzyme A; FASN: Fatty acid synthase; NADPH: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate.'
