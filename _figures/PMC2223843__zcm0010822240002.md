caption: TLR3 signaling pathways. Binding of dsRNA to the TLR3-CD14 complex induces
  the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways. The activation of NF-κB
  and IRF3 is achieved by two different signaling branches emanating from the TLR3
  adaptor molecule TRIF, which binds to the BB loop of the TLR3 TIR domain. Distinct
  regions of TRIF bind the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and the kinase RIP1. Analogously
  with the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF2 in the TNF receptor pathway, the activity
  of TRIF-associated TRAF6 might be responsible for the Ub of RIP1 in the TLR3 pathway.
  RIP1 ubiquitination is recognized by the ubiquitin receptor proteins TAB2 and TAB3,
  leading to the activation of the kinase TAK1, which is part of the same complex.
  TAK1 phosphorylates and activates IKKα and IKKβ, which are part of a bigger IKK
  complex with the IKK adaptor protein IKKγ. IKKβ is known to be the crucial IKK in
  TLR signaling and phosphorylates IκBα, which binds and keeps NF-κB (here depicted
  as a p65/p50 dimer) in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. IκBα phosphorylation
  leads to its recognition and degradation by the proteasome, thus allowing NF-κB
  to translocate to the nucleus, where it binds and activates specific gene promoters
  (e.g., A20). TRIF also binds TRAF3 and NAP1. Whereas the role of TRAF3 is still
  largely unclear, NAP1 functions as an adaptor for the IKK-related kinases IKKɛ and
  TBK1, which have largely redundant functions. Both kinases phosphorylate IRF3, leading
  to its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus, where it binds and activates
  specific gene promoters (e.g., IFN-β). Whereas these TRIF-mediated signaling pathways
  result in the activation of NF-κB and IRF3, the phosphorylation of NF-κB and IRF3
  is involved in acquiring the fully activated status of both transcription factors
  (see the text for more details). Signaling leading to these events is still largely
  unclear, but IRF3 phosphorylation is dependent on the kinase Akt, which is activated
  by the lipid kinase PI3K, which binds phospho-Tyr759 of TLR3. Interestingly, PI3K
  also seems to have an inhibitory function on NF-κB activation, whereas the phosphorylation
  of TLR3 on Tyr858 enhances NF-κB activation by an unknown mechanism. TLR3 also induces
  apoptosis via a TRIF- and RIP1-dependent mechanism. The binding of RIP1 to TRIF
  not only activates NF-κB but also recruits the DD-containing adaptor protein FADD
  via a homotypic DD-DD interaction. FADD in turn interacts with the cysteine protease
  procaspase-8 through the death effector domain (DED) present in both proteins. This
  is believed to result in the proteolytic auto-activation of procaspase-8 and the
  initiation of cell death. CYT, cytoplasmic linker.
