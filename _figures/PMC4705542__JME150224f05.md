caption: Schematic summary of the proposed photoneuroendocrine control of VGF expression.
  Thyroxine (T4) is taken up from the circulation into tanycytes via MCT8 transporters,
  and in LD is converted by DIO2 to T3 (). Furthermore, in LD, components of the retinoic
  acid-signaling pathway – CRBP-1, CRABP-2, RAR, and RXR – are all upregulated in
  the Siberian hamster (, ), while RALDH-1 is increased in the photoperiodic rat ().
  We demonstrate that VGF expression and promoter activity in SH-SY5Y cells is increased
  in response to treatment with RA and vitamin D and reduced in response to treatment
  with T3. Furthermore, VGF mRNA expression is reduced in response to intra-hypothalamic
  T3 administration in the SD-exposed Siberian hamster. In SD, expression of DIO3
  is upregulated, and thus, inactive metabolites of T4 such as rT3 and T2 are produced
  alongside reductions in components of the retinoic acid-signaling pathway, while
  vitamin D plasma levels are increased. This may account for the increase in VGF
  expression in the dmpARC whilst reducing VGF expression in the ARC. Adapted from
