caption: Protein transport into the secondary chloroplast of Euglena. Nuclear encoded
  chloroplast pre-proteins (blue strip) are synthesised into the lumen of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) where the signal peptide (SP) is cleaved. Pre-proteins with transit
  peptides (TP) are subsequently transferred to the outermost chloroplast membrane
  through the Golgi body via vesicles. GOSR and RAB5 GTPase are proposed to mediate
  the fusion of the vesicle to the outermost membrane. After transport of proteins
  into the stroma, where the TP is removed, the mature protein can enter the thylakoid
  lumen via SEC, TAT, or Alb3/SRP pathway. This scheme only considers proteins possessing
  Class I and II targeting signals, as the transport of those with unclassified signals
  is not known [].
