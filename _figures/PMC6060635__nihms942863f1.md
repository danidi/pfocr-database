caption: Complement activation via any of the three pathways (Classical, CP, alternative,
  AP or lectin pathway, LP) triggers a cascade of proteolytic reactions that converge
  at the cleavage of the central component, C3, by short-lived enzymatic complexes,
  termed C3 convertases of the CP (C4b3b) or AP (C3bBb). In the absence of the GPI-linked
  AP regulator DAF/CD55, PNH erythrocytes undergo uncontrollable C3 opsonization that
  leads to C3b deposition at high surface densities. This AP-amplified opsonic turnover
  triggers C5 convertase activity that leads to MAC assembly on target cells. In the
  absence of CD59, regulation of MAC formation on PNH erythrocytes is impaired and
  consequently this persistent C3 opsonization culminates in chronic, MAC-mediated
  intravascular hemolysis, one of the cardinal clinical manifestations of PNH. In
  the era of eculizumab treatment, C3-mediated extravascular hemolysis of C3-opsonized
  PNH cells in the hepatosplenic compartment has emerged as a significant unmet clinical
  need for PNH patients who are suboptimal responders to anti-C5 therapy. Furthermore,
  a fraction of PNH patients may show incomplete response to eculizumab due to residual
  intravascular hemolysis which is attributed to pharmacodynamic or pharmacologic
  breakthrough during inhibitor dosing. These unmet needs have sparked the development
  of next-generation complement therapeutics that can modulate C3 or C5 activation
  and also target AP convertase activity (shown in callout boxes). In principle, C5
  blockage results in complete abrogation of intravascular hemolysis without however
  affecting upstream AP dysregulation. Conceivably, the application of different anti-C5
  agents (or their combination) may offer deeper terminal pathway inhibition and/or
  improved patient compliance through alternative dosing routes. Upstream complement
  intervention at the level of C3 is anticipated to afford broader inhibition of complement
  responses that drive PNH pathology. C3 inhibition can abrogate both intravascular
  and extravascular C3-mediated hemolysis while AP-targeted inhibitors can also afford
  broader coverage by controlling AP amplification and downstream effector generation.
