caption: 'Mechanisms of action of metformin. Metformin appears to exert its cell growth-inhibitory
  effects through two distinct mechanisms. A direct mechanism that inhibits the mTOR
  pathway and an indirect mechanism depending on insulin levels. Metformin activates
  adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK), the cellular energy sensor.
  Activation of AMPK leads to suppression of many of the processes highly dependent
  on ATP, such as gluconeogenesis, protein, fatty acid, and cholesterol biosynthesis.
  It inhibits transcription of gluconeogenesis genes in the liver and increases glucose
  uptake in skeletal muscle. This appears to reduce the levels of circulating glucose,
  increase insulin sensitivity, and reduce the hyperinsulinemia associated with insulin
  resistance.In the cancer cell, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
  pathway promotes cell growth and proliferation by interplay of two opposing upstream
  pathways involving the Akt pathway, which signals availability of nutrients, and
  the AMPK pathway, which signals lack of energy. TOR complex 1 (TORC1), directly
  regulates cell growth and contains raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)
  and PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa), which represses mTOR activity.
  There are two types of input that activateTORC1: increased availability of amino
  acids at the cellular level, and activated insulin or the related growth factor
  IGF1 signaling. They activate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) which switches
  on Akt. TORC1 is stimulated by the active, GTP-bound form of the Rheb, and immediately
  upstream of Rheb is the TSC1:TSC2 heterodimer. TSC2 converts Rheb to its inactive
  Rheb:GDP form. Activation of Akt causes phosphorylation of TSC2, which is thought
  to inhibit its GAP activity and stimulates TORC1. On the other hand, Akt also phosphorylates
  PRAS40 and appears to relieve its inhibitory effect.AMPK is activated when ATP levels
  lower switching off the mTOR pathway over the positive effects of amino acids or
  growth factors via phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK which stimulatesits Rheb-GAP
  activity. Metformin and its analogs also activate AMPK in the absence of TSC2 thought
  Raptor phosphorylation. This effect appears to be a direct effect on mTOR kinase
  activity, possibly involving increased binding of 14-3-3 proteins and/or partial
  dissociation of PRAS40. So, the AMPK pathway exerts two inhibitory effects on mTOR
  via phosphorylation of TSC2 and Raptor similary to the Akt pathway, which exerts
  two stimulatory effects via phosphorylation of TSC2 and PRAS40.'
