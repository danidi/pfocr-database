caption: Synthesis and release of ACh by tuft cells. Tuft cells may synthesize and
  release ACh through canonical biosynthesis pathway and other different pathways.
  Various signals, including bitter substances, ATP and bacterial metabolites, are
  capable of triggering this process. ATP increases intracellular Ca2+ level via purinergic
  receptor P2X and the acceleration of Ca2+ promotes the lease of ACh. Bitter substances
  and bacterial metabolites are sensed by taste receptor type 2 (Tas2R), influence
  downstream G-protein α-gustducin (GNAT3) and phospholipase C β2 (PLCβ2), induce
  perturbation of intracellular Ca2+, activate TRPM5 and subsequently result in the
  release of ACh. In the canonical ACh biosynthesis pathway, extracellular choline
  is imported via CHT1, catalyzed into ACh with mitochondria-derived acetyl-CoA by
  ChAT in the cytoplasm. The ACh is then packaged into vesicles and released via VAChT
  in the exocytosis manner. Redundant ACh will be degraded into choline via acetylcholinesterase
  (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and this extracellular choline may be re-uptake
  for the next cycle. However, there are still questions in the ACh biosynthesis in
  tuft cells. It is deduced that the synthesis of ACh may also be catalyzed by mitochondrial
  enzyme CarAT. In gastrointestinal and biliary tract, tuft cells lack the expression
  of VAChT and CHT1. These cells are speculated to re-uptake choline via CTL1-5 and
  OCTs, release ACh via direct way, OCT1/2-mediated way, and proteolipid mediatophore
  or even gap junction.
