caption: Role of epithelial STAT3 in driving stromal remodelling and tumour tension.
  Loss-of-function mutations in the TGF-β signalling pathway, either at the receptor
  level or further downstream (SMAD4), lead to impaired TGF-β signalling (a). This
  specific genetic signature results in increased STAT3 activity (b), leading to both
  cancer cell autonomous and nonautonomous effects. Within the epithelial compartment,
  phosphorylation of actomyosins causes increased contractility and tumour tension
  (c), whereas epithelial STAT3 activation models the surrounding stroma by increasing
  fibrosis and ECM stiffness, and modulating immune cell infiltration (d). Altogether,
  these epithelial and stromal changes drive tumour progression and lead to shorter
  survival (e)
