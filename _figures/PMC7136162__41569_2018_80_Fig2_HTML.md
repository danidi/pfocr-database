caption: Fat tissue produces less adiponectin and is infiltrated by macrophages that
  release tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL-1, and IL-6. This inflammatory state increases
  the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1) and tissue factor (TF)
  by endothelial cells, as well as coagulation factors, carboxypeptidase B2 (also
  known as thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor; TAFI), PAI1, and acute phase
  proteins, such as complement C3, by the liver. TNF blocks the vasculoprotective
  insulin pathway involving insulin receptor substrate (IRS)–phosphoinositide 3-kinase
  (PI3K)–RACα serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) and activates inflammation through
  the signalling pathway involving c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)–inhibitor of nuclear
  factor-κB kinase (IKK)–nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Impaired IRS–PI3K–AKT transduction
  alters nitric oxide (NO) and insulin-responsive glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4;
  also known as SLC2A4) function, whereas the prothrombotic insulin pathway involving
  growth factor receptor-bound protein (GRB)–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  remains effective. Inflammation also blunts peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
  (PPARγ)-mediated synthesis of the anticoagulant tissue factor pathway inhibitor
  (TFPI). Hyperglycaemia increases production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
  contributes to endothelial dysfunction. Increased levels of glycated haemoglobin
  (HbA1c) alter the physiological transport and release of NO. Hyperglycaemia and
  triglyceridaemia favour the synthesis of coagulation factors and PAI1.
