caption: 'The figure shows carbohydrate metabolism starting with glycogen breakdown,
  and including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
  Small heat maps show logFC values of differentially expressed transcripts coding
  for the enzymes involved in the pathway. Green indicates downregulated (Log2FC ≤
  -0.585, FDR ≤ 0.05), and red indicates upregulated (Log2FC ≥ 0.585, FDR ≤ 0.05)
  transcripts. White boxes indicate that transcripts were not differentially expressed.
  D1D2: combination of deiodinase type 1 and type 2 morpholino-injected, D3: deiodinase
  type 3 morpholino-injected. Numbers refer to  listing the details of the differentially
  expressed transcripts.'
