caption: Schematic diagram illustrating a model for the antagonistic roles of Dp110
  and DPTEN in Drosophila growth control. In mammals, Drosophila, and C. elegans,
  PI3-kinase activity is regulated by signaling cascades that include the insulin
  receptor and IRS1-4 (; ; ; ). Disruption of this pathway in mice (; ) and Drosophila
  () has shown that insulin receptor signaling controls tissue and body size. Our
  data indicate that DPTEN antagonizes this pathway in flies and decreases cell size
  and number. It seems likely that DPTEN's effects are largely mediated by reducing
  PIP3 levels and the activity of its putative downstream targets, including Dakt1.
  DPTEN's protein phosphatase activity, however, could also have a role (see ). DPTEN
  also appears to regulate organization of the actin cytoskeleton via currently uncharacterized
  mechanisms (dotted lines) that may involve either its protein or lipid phosphatase
  activity. DPTEN's effects on the cytoskeleton may influence its tumor suppressing
  activity by modulating processes such as cell spreading and invasiveness.
