number: Fig. 4
caption: Schematic overview of the carbon cycle, with light orange labels highlighting
  the potential viral contributions. Plant polymers that have the potential to be
  degraded by viral glycoside hydrolases are along the top, with examples of each
  below. Individual sugars are colour coded (see monomers beneath the black and orange
  arrows). The predicted enzymatic functions from computational protein models are
  listed in red, and example polymer cleavage points are indicated by the red arrows.
  Smaller molecules (monosaccharides and small oligosaccharides) cleaved from the
  polymers are shown at the ends of the black arrows, indicating the potential enzymatic
  conversion encoded by the viral glycoside hydrolase (the orange arrow indicates
  cleavage that was functionally confirmed by enzymatic assay), with the PHYRE2-modelled
  structure of each viral glycoside hydrolase in red. The asterisks indicate that
  multiple viral genes were recovered with the indicated predicted function. In those
  cases, the viral protein structure containing the most catalytic residues is shown
  (see Supplementary Table  for details). The grey line indicates a cleavage pathway
  of small oligosaccharides to monomers (non-viral). β-Gal, β-galactosidase; endogluc,
  endoglucanase; RG-I, rhamnogalacturonan I; black monomer, rhamnose; dark grey monomer,
  galacturonic acid.
