caption: Model for 1,2-propanediol degradation by S. enterica. Coenzyme B12 (AdoCbl),
  coenzyme B12-dependent diol dehydratase (PduCDE), propionaldehyde dehydrogenase
  (PduP), phosphotransacylase (PduL), propionate kinase (PduW), and 1-propanol dehydrogenase
  (PduQ) are depicted. The first two steps of 1,2-PD degradation (conversion of 1,2-PD
  to propionyl-CoA) are proposed to occur within a polyhedral body-microcompartment.
  The dashed line indicates the shell of the polyhedral body, which is composed of
  up to seven different polypeptides. ATP is generated during the conversion of propionyl-PO42−
  to propionate. Given a suitable terminal electron acceptor such as O2, propionyl-CoA
  is degraded via the methylcitrate pathway, where biosynthetic precursors and additional
  energy are produced. Two additional enzymes associated with the polyhedral bodies
  (but not shown in the figure) are a putative diol dehydratase reactivase (PduGH)
  and an ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (PduO) involved in B12 recycling.
