caption: In the ER, mutated pro-AVP (truncated at the NPII region) causes ER stress
  by forming aggregates that also encompass the non-mutant (wild-type) precursor (black
  box). At an early stage of the disease, ERAD, ERAC formation, autophagy, and reduction
  of AVP mRNA (light blue boxes) each help to prevent loss of functional AVP neurons,
  but ultimately, FNDI ensues as a consequence of limited AVP secretion (pink box).
  At the end stage of the disease, there is a net loss of immunostainable AVP neurons,
  which may make the central DI phenotype irreversible (large arrow at bottom).
