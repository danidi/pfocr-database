caption: Selumetinib sensitive (green) cell lines show higher MEK-functional-activation
  and/or lower compensatory-resistance signature expression. The converse is true
  of resistant (red) cell lines, and cells of intermediate sensitivity (gray) lie
  in between. In no cases is high compensatory-resistance expression seen without
  expression of MEK-functional-activation, suggesting that the mechanisms represented
  by these signatures are not mutually exclusive. A, the threshold at which optimal
  separation of sensitive from resistant cell lines is achieved in the mixed-tumor/melanoma
  cell panels is illustrated with a dotted line. B, consistent separation at the same
  threshold is achieved in an independent panel of colon cell lines, where all BRAF-mutant
  tumors show high expression of the MEK-functional-activation signature. C, signatures
  also show a consistent trend relative to response in an independent breast cell
  panel, where higher MEK-functional-activation expression is predominantly seen in
  the basal/mesenchymal subtype known to show higher activity of MEK (). As expression
  in this breast panel was measured using a different gene expression platform, threshold
  values are not directly comparable to those in A and B.
