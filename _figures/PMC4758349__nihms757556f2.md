caption: The AIM2 inflammasome is activated by a number of microbial pathogens and
  dsDNA ligands, including the DNA virus mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), the cytosolic
  bacterium Francisella novicida and the dsDNA ligand poly(dA:dT). MCMV infection
  or transfection of poly(dA:dT) leads to “canonical” activation of the AIM2 inflammasome,
  which does not require the type I interferon (IFN) pathway. F. novicida infection
  activates the AIM2 inflammasome via a “non-canonical” pathway owing to its requirement
  for type I IFN, analogous to the non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Intracellular
  F. novicida releases DNA into the cytoplasm to activate the DNA sensors cGAS, STING
  and IFI204, which drive transcription of genes encoding type I IFN molecules. It
  remains unclear why the released DNA is unable to activate AIM2 at this stage, since
  AIM2 is constitutively expressed in the cell. Type I IFN provides a feedback loop
  to induce expression of the transcription factor IRF1, which upregulates expression
  of the IFN-inducible GTPases, including GBP2 and GBP5. GBP2 and GBP5 are recruited
  to bacterial structures, however, whether they directly target the bacterial membrane
  or the membrane of intact Francisella-containing vacuole is unclear. Nevertheless,
  GBPs mediate bacterial killing, resulting in abundant release of bacterial DNA for
  recognition by AIM2. Assembly of the AIM2 inflammasome induces caspase-1-dependent
  cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Caspase-1 also drives cleavage of the substrate
  gasdermin D to induce pyroptosis.
