caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed signaling pathway involved in
  the inhibitory effects of CORM-2 on P. aeruginosa-induced PGE2/IL-6/ICAM-1-dependent
  monocyte adhesion. In HPAEpiCs, CORM-2 inhibits P. aeruginosa-induced PGE2/IL-6/ICAM-1
  expression and inflammatory responses by decreasing the NADPH oxidase/ROS generation
  and the activation of the PKCα/NADPH oxidase/ROS/JNK/NF-κB and PKCα/NADPH oxidase/ROS/ERK1/2
  pathways.
