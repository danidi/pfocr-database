caption: Model of P58IPK suppression of apoptosis. PKR has been implicated as an essential
  component of the apoptotic pathway that is induced by dsRNA, and inhibition of PKR
  by overexpression of P58IPK results in resistance to dsRNA-induced apoptosis. Consistent
  with the inability of ΔTPR6 to inhibit PKR-dependent functions, ΔTPR6-expressing
  cells undergo apoptosis in response to dsRNA treatment. In contrast, both the P58IPK
  and ΔTPR6 cell lines were resistant to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. We propose that
  P58IPK (and ΔTPR6) can also act in a PKR-independent fashion to regulate the TNF-α
  pathway. This regulation most likely occurs at a point in the pathway that is upstream
  of PKR. Suppression of apoptosis may be a primary mechanism by which overexpression
  of P58IPK induces malignant transformation. See Discussion for additional details.
