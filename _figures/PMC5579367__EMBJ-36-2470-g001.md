caption: Purple circles (1–5) show ZBP1‐mediated activation of necroptosis by MCMV
  infection. (1, 2) Viral entry, nuclear replication, and production of progeny virus.
  (3) An integral part of the replication cycle is IE3‐dependent viral RNA transcription.
  (4) ZBP1 senses viral RNA, thus stimulating interaction with RIPK3 through its RHIM
  A domain. (5) RIPK3 activation induces phosphorylation of MLKL, leading to activation
  of necroptosis. The viral protein M36 inhibits caspase‐8‐mediated blocking of necroptosis,
  while M45 inhibits ZBP1–RIPK3 interaction. ZBP1 expression can be stimulated by
  type I IFN that can be produced, for example, after sensing of viral DNA by the
  cGAS‐STING pathway. Blue circles (1′–3′) show ZBP1‐mediated activation of necroptosis
  by endogenous RNAs upon caspase blockade. (1′) In the presence of zVAD, a caspase
  inhibitor, ZBP1 activates necroptosis. (2′) This is likely mediated through sensing
  of endogenous RNAs (Z‐RNAs?). (3′) Caspase‐inhibition‐induced necroptosis involved
  both RIPK3 and RIPK1.
