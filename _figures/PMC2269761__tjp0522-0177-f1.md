caption: 'Pathways indicated in red activate myosin II, resulting in contraction,
  cell migration and cancer metastasis. Pathways that reduce myosin II activity are
  shown in blue. The major, Ca2+-independent pathway that increases myosin II activity
  is through activation of Rho-kinase by RhoA.GTP, phosphorylation of the regulatory
  subunit of myosin phosphatase (MLCP) by Rho-kinase and some other kinases (see text),
  resulting in inhibition of MLCP activity and increased myosin RLC phosphorylation.
  Increases in arachidonic acid, due to a variety of stimuli, can also activate Rho-kinase
  and, at least in vitro, also inhibit MLCP activity by dissociating the regulatory
  (M110-130) from the catalytic (PP-1C) subunit. The third pathway shown that enhances
  myosin II activity is through phosphorylation of CPI-17 by protein kinase C (PKC)
  leading to direct inhibition of PP-1C by the phosphorylated CPI-17 (CPI-17.P). Each
  of these mechanisms requires the presence of an active kinase that can phosphorylate
  Ser19 of RLC and increase myosin II activity by inhibiting MLCP even at constant
  [Ca2+]i (‘Ca2+ sensitization’). These mechanisms operate in parallel with and independently
  of the activation of MLCK by Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic
  reticulum (SR/ER) by InsP3 or by Ca2+ influx (not shown). Abbreviations: PLC, phospholipase
  C; PiP2, phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate;
  DAG, diacylglycerol; PKC, protein kinase C; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor;
  MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; Cam, calmodulin; RLC, regulatory light chain; C3,
  Clostridium botulinum, exoenzyme that ADP-ribosylates Asn 41 of RhoA, inhibits RhoA
  activity and blocks its translocation to the membrane; Y-27632, selective inhibitor
  of Rho-kinase.'
