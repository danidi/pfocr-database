caption: Overview of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin
  (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) signaling pathway. Following ligation of cell surface receptors
  (e.g., growth factor receptors) phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) recruits
  scaffolding proteins, which bind to the regulatory p85 subunit of PI3K. A subsequent
  activation of the catalytic subunits of PI3K generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-
  trisphosphates (PIP3). Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) and Akt proteins
  are then recruited to the plasma membrane, inducing the phosphorylation of Akt on
  Thr308 by PDK1. This is followed by activation of Akt on Ser473 by the mTOR complex
  2 (mTORC2); this second phosphorylation is necessary for complete activation. Akt
  controls the activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) by constraining the GTPase activity
  of the TSC1/TSC2 complex towards the Ras-related GTP-binding protein ras homologue
  enriched in brain (RHEB) that associates to mTORC1 and phosphorylates mTOR. The
  mTORC1 induces cap-dependent messenger RNA (mRNA) translation by phosphorylating
  4EBP1, leading to the formation of eIF4F and the inhibition of autophagy. Both mTORC1
  and PDK1 can directly activate S6K1, which in turn activates S6, and hence facilitates
  protein synthesis and cell growth. Positive regulation (activation/stimulation)
  of the pathways is presented as black arrows, and negative regulation (inhibition)
  of the pathways is presented as red blunt-ended lines. The abbreviations shown in
  the figure can be found in the list of abbreviations.
