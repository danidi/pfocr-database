caption: 'Schematic diagram of the major TGF-β signaling pathways in vascular cells.
  TGF-β interacts with three types of cell-surface receptors: Type III receptors (TβR3)
  are proteoglycans, such as endoglin (ENG), which bind TGF-β and act as a peri-membraneous
  reservoir but have no known signaling functions; Type II receptors (TβR2) are constitutive
  serine-threonine kinases, which activate Type I receptors (TβR1), particularly ALK5,
  in tetrameric complexes induced by the TGF-β ligand. TβR1 phosphorylates receptor
  SMADs (SMAD2/3), which then bind to the common SMAD4 (SMAD4), are translocated to
  the nucleus and interact with a variety of cofactors to activate or repress transcription.
  In particular, c-Myc (C-Myc) can be repressed by SMAD3-containing complexes, whereas
  transcription of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors such as p15, p21 and p27
  can be directly activated or indirectly activated by c-Myc repression. In a SMAD-independent
  pathway (MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase), TβR1 has a kinase-independent binding
  site for TRAF6, which ubiquinates and activates TGF-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) to
  influence signaling in the jun N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK) and MAPK pathways. In a
  third pathway (Rho), receptor activation can activate Rho GTPases, which couple
  to guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), such as neuroepithelial transforming
  1 (NET1), to activate Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK)
  and Lim kinase, causing inactivation of cdc25a and CDK2, favoring cell cycle arrest'
