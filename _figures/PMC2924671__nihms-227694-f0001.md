caption: Sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway and potential inhibitors. Multiple compounds
  are outlined, but the most convincing data is that for myriocin and is therefore
  the only one discussed in the text. * First rate-limiting step in the sphinglipid
  biosynthetic pathway. Myriocin is isolated from Isari Sinclairii (fungal species)
  and is a potent and specific inhibitor of serine palmitoyltransferase, the enzyme
  which is the catalyst in this step.
