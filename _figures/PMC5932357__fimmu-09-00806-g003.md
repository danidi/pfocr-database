caption: Schwann cell central metabolism is subverted by Mycobacterium leprae. After
  infection, Schwann cells increase their insulin-like growth factor (IGF) expression,
  upregulating glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and glucose uptake by Akt signaling.
  Glycolysis is downregulated, feeding the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) with carbons
  used to synthesize building blocks to promote Schwann cell dedifferentiation and
  proliferation, generating during this process the reducing power [nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)] responsible for pumping up lipid biosynthesis. Pyruvate
  generated by the PPP is rapidly converted to citrate and subsequently converted
  to lipids, virtually stopping the tricarboxylic acid cycle, respiration and mitochondrial
  energy potential of the Schwann cells. All of these modulations are crucial for
  subverting the host immunity against the mycobacteria and, consequently, to the
  success of the M. leprae infection, representing potential for new host-target therapy
  strategies to halt leprosy progression. The gray arrows represent downregulated
  pathways.
