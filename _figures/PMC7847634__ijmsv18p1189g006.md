caption: Diagram demonstrating the molecular mechanisms of prolonged preoperative
  fasting and surgical stress in development of postoperative insulin-resistant hyperglycemia
  and unfolded protein response in the peripheral skeletal muscles. This “2-hit” model
  induces ER stress in the skeletal muscles and in turn, suppresses muscular glucose
  transportation by attenuating Glut4 expression and increasing intracellular Ca2+
  loading. Elevated ER stress also promotes skeletal muscle protein breakdown through
  the activation of IRE-1α/JNK pathway.
