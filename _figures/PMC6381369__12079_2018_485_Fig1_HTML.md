caption: An illustrated view of Netrin-UNC5B signaling. The pathway map of UNC5B signaling
  represents the interaction between Netrins and UNC5B receptor and the downstream
  signaling events triggered by these interactions. These induced signaling events
  include protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, transport,
  activation/inhibition and gene regulation events. These events have been represented
  by various color codes as shown in the legend. The details of post-translational
  events including site and residue have also been provided in the map
