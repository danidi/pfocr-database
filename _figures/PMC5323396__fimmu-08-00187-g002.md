caption: General overview of the Wnt signaling pathway. The Wnt signaling pathway
  can be divided into the canonical Wnt signaling and non-canonical Wnt pathways.
  During activation, canonical Wnt ligands interact with the Fz-LRP5/6 complex receptor,
  inducing the activation of Dvl and the recruitment of Axin by LRP5/6. This situation
  leads to the disassembly of the β-catenin destruction complex, which prevents GSK3β-mediated
  β-catenin phosphorylation. Thus, β-catenin can translocate to the nucleus where
  it binds to the TCF/Lef, initiating the transcription of Wnt-related genes. When
  inactivated, the β-catenin destruction complex remains stabilized, allowing the
  phosphorylation of β-catenin, inducing its degradation by the proteasome. However,
  the non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway requires non-canonical Wnt ligands, which will
  interact with the Fz receptor and will activate Dvl. However, at this point, Dvl
  induces the activation of RhoA and Rac, which ultimately will lead to cytoskeletal
  rearrangement. Similarly, a secondary non-canonical Wnt pathway, known as Wnt/Ca2+,
  can be triggered by non-canonical Wnt ligands. In this case, Fz will induce the
  release of calcium from intracellular stores, leading to the activation of calcineurin,
  CamKII, and PKC. Fz, frizzled receptor; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related
