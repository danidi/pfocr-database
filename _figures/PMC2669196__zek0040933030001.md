caption: FG and HOG MAPK signaling pathways. Components that are shared between the
  FG and HOG pathways are depicted in solid green. Components of the FG pathway are
  outlined in yellow, and components of the HOG pathway are outlined in blue. For
  simplicity, some interactions for which there exist evidence are not depicted such
  as those between Sho1 and Ste50 and Sho1 and Ste11. Also, the interaction between
  Ste50 and Cdc42 is not depicted in the HOG pathway, and only one of several possible
  transcription factors is depicted in the HOG pathway.
