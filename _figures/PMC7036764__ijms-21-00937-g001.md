caption: 'The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is a metabolic pathway involved in the
  onset of cisplatin resistance. The oxidative branch (red frames) comprises three
  reactions: the first one involves the enzyme glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD);
  the second reaction is catalyzed by phosphogluconolactonase (6PGL); the third reaction
  involves the enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD). The non-oxidative branch
  (green frames) comprises other reactions and the enzymes involved are transketolase
  (TKT) and transaldolase (TAL).'
