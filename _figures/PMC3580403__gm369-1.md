caption: HD-iPSCs, corrected iPSCs, and iPSC-derived neurons reveal key disease-associated
  phenotypes. An et al. [] and the HD iPSC Consortium [] generated HD-iPSC lines.
  An et al. [] also generated corrected HD-iPSCs by homologous recombination and showed
  that, when compared to corrected HD-iPSCs, HD-iPSCs have increased expression of
  genes that are induced by the TGF-β signaling pathway and decreased expression of
  cadherin pathway genes []. HD-iPSC lines developed by the HD iPSC Consortium were
  further differentiated to form NPCs and DARPP-32-positive striatal-like neurons
  []. These NPCs yielded evidence for the altered expression in HD of genes that are
  involved in cell signaling, cell cycling, axon guidance, and neurodevelopmental
  pathways. As delineated here, future studies might compare these two datasets and
  thus could evaluate the expression of the target genes of those transcription factors
  known to interact with huntingtin, examine mitochondrial dysfunction in HD and investigate
  the exact identity of the dying cells in HD. NPC, neural progenitor cell; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; TF, transcription factor.
