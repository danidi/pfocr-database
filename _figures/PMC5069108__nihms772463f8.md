caption: Lung contusion induces alveolar disruption and cellular necrosis. Double
  stranded (ds) RNA released from the cells are the key ligand for activation of the
  TLR3, specifically located on the surface of the endosome. Additionally, the injury/inflammation
  causes a significant surface translocation of TLR3, further amplifying the inflammatory
  process.The TLR3/TRIF signaling pathway activation in LC is independent of NF-kB
  and mediated through phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. The major effect is
  borne on the alveolar macrophage inducing increased apoptosis and phenotypic alteration.
  TLR3 recognition of dsRNA (SS) also activates the inflammasome complex via [NLRP-3,
  IL1 β, IL18] to generate a robust pro-inflammatory response (Figure-8).
