caption: The tumor microenvironment influences the metabolic status of cancer cells
  with consequences for their metastatic potential. Both exogenous lipids (e.g., FAs,
  LPs, or EVs) and endogenous lipids (obtained by FAS) can be stored in LDs, conferring
  a lipid-loaded cancer cell phenotype, which correlates with an increased metastatic
  potential. TME conditions can potentiate different aspects of lipid metabolism.
  Acidosis and hypoxia stimulate exogenous LP internalization via HSPGs, in a process
  that involves p-ERK signaling. The SREBP-dependent pathway represents a main lipogenic
  program and has been linked to metastasis. SREBP can be activated under acidic conditions
  through changes in pHi. Changes in ACC2 acetylation allow FAO to occur concomitantly
  with FAS in acidosis-adapted cells. Further, increased glutamine metabolism in acidosis-adapted
  cells due to changes in histone acetylation serves as a source of AcCoA that fuels
  FAS. Drugs targeting different lipid pathways constitute interesting therapeutics
  targeted at metastatic cells (shown in red). Extracellular acidosis-mediated effects
  are represented with yellow boxes. α-KG alpha-ketoglutarate, ACC2 acetyl-CoA carboxylase,
