caption: Proposed model for the involvement of the different CK1 isoforms in the Wnt
  pathway. In unstimulated cells (A), inactive CK1ε is bound to p120-catenin and E-cadherin
  (E-cadh); E-cadherin is also associated with Wnt coreceptor LRP5/6 (LRP). CK1α is
  interacting with axin. Upon binding of Wnt ligands and the formation of the LRP5/6-Fz
  complex (B), CK1ε is activated by removal of inhibitory phosphates in its C-terminal
  tail by the action of an unknown phosphatase. Activated CK1ε phosphorylates Dvl-2
  (Dvl), stabilizing the interaction of Dvl-2 with LRP5/6 (C). Binding of Dvl-2 enables
  LRP5/6 phosphorylation at Thr1479 by the action of CK1γ, which in turn allows the
  recruitment of axin to the complex (D). Axin-associated CK1α also binds to the Wnt-receptor
  complex, contributing to LRP5/6 phosphorylation (E). Moreover, CK1α also phosphorylates
  p120-catenin at Ser268 and E-cadherin, releasing E-cadherin and p120-catenin from
  the signalosome. CK1ε is released from the complex with p120-catenin, interrupting
  the input signal. Finally, axin/CK1α complex is released from LRP5/6-Dvl2 complex
  by the action of a phosphatase that dephosphorylates axin (F).
