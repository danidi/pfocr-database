caption: Naringenin Pathway, Antithetic Controller and TF-Based Extended Metabolic
  BiosensorProduction of the naringenin target is proxied by a metabolic circuit through
  the downstream metabolite kaempferol, which is sensed by the QdoR transcription
  factor and feeds back to an antithetic controller. The controller is activated upstream
  by the external AHL inducer, and its actuating signal overdrives the expression
  of the CHS enzyme in the pathway, in order to compensate for malonyl-CoA depletion.
