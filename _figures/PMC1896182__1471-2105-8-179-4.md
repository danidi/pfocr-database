caption: Views of data interpretation. The overlaid differential expression values
  are the result of the t-test shown in figure 3a. Node colors reflect the differential
  gene expression. The light gray nodes represent associated genes not on the array.
  a)Comparing the genes with the lowest p-value shows enriched lymphocyte activation
  in the GO Term enrichment analysis. b)Glucolysis KEGG map overlaid with differential
  expression result. c) gene association network of the glucolysis genes. d)Chromosomal
  location detail view of a chromosome part containing a differential expressed gene.
  Genes measured on the chip are marked in yellow on the chromosome, differential
  gene expression is shown above and below the chromosome.
