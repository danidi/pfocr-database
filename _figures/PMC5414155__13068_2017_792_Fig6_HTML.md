caption: Impact of limiting nitrogen source in the media on C. thermocellum metabolism.
  a Change in pathway fluxes and metabolite concentration on reducing ammonium uptake
  activity to 20% of the wild-type activity. The numbers represent the flux values
  (mol/mol cellobiose) normalized to cellobiose uptake (except for those in parentheses
  represent concentration change) for the wild-type (gray color) to ammonia-limited
  (green or red color representing upregulation or downregulation, respectively) conditions.
  All fluxes were normalized to cellobiose uptake. b Comparison of model-predicted
  yield change with the experimentally measured values
