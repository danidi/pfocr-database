caption: Proposed mechanisms of the antioxidative actions of Pistacia lentiscus var.
  chia. Mastic essential oil confers a cytoprotective effect against H2O2- and UV-induced
  oxidative stress in skin epithelial cells by inducing NRF2 mRNA expression and subsequently
  upregulating the Nrf2–ARE pathway, which plays a fundamental role in maintaining
  cellular redox homeostasis. Under normal conditions, NRF2 is constitutively expressed
  at low levels, being repressed mainly by KEAP1 through ubiquitination and proteasomal
  degradation. When NRF2 is activated in response to oxidative stress it gets released
  from KEAP1, thereby avoiding degradation, and is translocated to the nucleus, where
  it binds to ARE along with the small musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma protein (sMaf)
  in the promoter regions of various antioxidant response proteins and phase II detoxifying
  enzymes. Activated ARE-driven downstream antioxidant defense mechanisms will lead
  to the restoration of normal physiological conditions and to the alleviation of
  oxidative stress. We propose that mastic essential oil activates the Nrf2–ARE pathway
  by inducing NRF2 expression, which potentially influences the pathway at different
  stages (e.g., expression, degradation, and activation), leading ultimately to the
  upregulation of the pathway and the transcriptional activation of antioxidant response
  proteins. The exact details of the mechanisms remain unknown and require further
  investigation (dashed lines). Mastic essential oil also exerts enhanced cell regeneration
  and wound healing actions.
