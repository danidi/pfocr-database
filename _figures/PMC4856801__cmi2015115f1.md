caption: A proposed model depicting the opposing roles of type I and type II NKT cells
  in inflammatory diseases in the liver. Type I NKT cells are rapidly activated following
  liver injuries induced by alcohol, high-fat diet, ischemia and/or gut-derived microbial
  products. Liver-resident antigen-presenting cells, such as KCs, and TLRs/cytokines
  mediate their activation, which results in the cytokine/chemokine-dependent recruitment
  of myeloid cells (CD11b+Gr-1+) and neutrophils, and the activation of HSC and NK
  cells. These cellular interactions lead to steatosis, fibrosis and hepatocyte necrosis.
  These events are also involved in the development of HCC. In contrast, type II NKT
  cells are activated following the presentation of self-lipids, such as sulfatide
  and LPC, which results in the induction of a cross-regulatory pathway that inhibits
  type I NKT cells, tolerizes cDCs and blocks the inflammatory cascade and liver disease.
  cDCs, conventional DCs; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; HSC, hepatic stellate cell;
  KC, Kupffer cell; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; NK, natural killer; NKT, natural
  killer T cells; OPN, osteopontin; TLR, toll-like receptor.
