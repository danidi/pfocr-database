caption: Pheromone response and negative feedback. (A) The pheromone response pathway.
  Binding of pheromone to the GPCR triggers dissociation of the G protein heterotrimer
  (Gαβγ). The free Gβγ dimer then stimulates membrane recruitment of the scaffold
  protein, Ste5. A cascade of kinase activation ultimately activates the MAPK Fus3,
  which stimulates both downstream mating responses and negative feedback, which dampens
  the response. Ste5 is one of several targets of Fus3-mediated negative feedback.
  (B) Domain structure of Ste5. Names of domains and motifs are shown below the linear
  structure, and their binding targets are indicated above. SP/TP motifs, which represent
  minimal phosphorylation sites for MAPKs and CDKs, are marked in red. (C) Ste5 has
  two clusters of SP/TP sites. The central cluster was originally implicated as a
  target of Fus3 negative feedback. In those studies, the Thr and Ser sites were mutated
  to nonphosphorylatable Val and Ala residues, designated 2V2A (or “abcd” in ), as
  well as to phosphomimetic Glu residues, designated 4E (or “EFGH” in ).
