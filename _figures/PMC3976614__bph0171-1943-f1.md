caption: Modulation of mitochondrial dysfunction by the PINK1/PARKIN pathway. (A)
  Mitochondrial dynamics contribute to the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity.
  Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, mtDNA mutations or misfolded proteins accumulate.
  The PINK1/PARKIN axis inhibits the fusion process to avoid the spreading of damaged
  mitochondrial components. However, this axis also enhances the fission process to
  induce the physical separation of damaged mitochondria. Healthy components are rescued
  and damaged ones are eliminated by mitophagy. (B) Mitophagy is required to eliminate
  damaged mitochondria. When the organelle is deeply impaired, PINK1 recruits PARKIN
  for ubiquitination of outer membrane proteins, which labels irreversibly damaged
  mitochondria for mitophagy. (C) Mitochondrial trafficking is arrested upon mitochondrial
  dysfunction. PINK1 inhibits mitochondrial movement along microtubules, recruits
  PARKIN for ubiquitination and induces ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Miro. The
  above information is summarized from references discussed in the text.
