caption: The cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensing pathway is essential for production
  of type I IFNs such as IFN-β. An RT-induced DNA exonuclease Trex1 degrades cytosolic
  DNA to dampen the production of type I IFNs in response to RT. However, STING agonists
  can bypass this exonuclease and thus may directly activate macrophages to augment
  the response to RT. Ligation of IL-10 receptor activates STAT3, which is critical
  for the expression of its own cytokine IL-10. Blockade of the IL-10 pathway may
  disrupt this feedback and combined with RT to boost anti-tumor immunity. Upon IL-4
  stimulation, the transcriptional regulator GATA3 induces a program that polarizes
  macrophages into an M2 phenotype. Agents that target the IL-4 pathway may improve
  the efficacy of RT by preventing formation of the M2 phenotype in macrophages in
  response to RT-induced IL-4 production.
