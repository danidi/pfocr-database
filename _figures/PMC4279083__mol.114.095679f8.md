caption: SAMe and MTA inhibit β-catenin signaling in liver and colon cancer cells
  by multiple mechanisms. (A) SAMe and MTA reduce the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin
  in colon or liver cancers containing mutations to the Wnt pathway. SAMe and MTA
  may attenuate one or more proposed mechanisms of β-catenin nuclear import and/or
  enhance β-catenin export. For nuclear import, SAMe and MTA may reduce the interaction
  of β-catenin to proteins that may aid its translocation to the nucleus, such as
  FoxM1, which contains a nuclear localization signal. Because SAMe and MTA can reduce
  AKT activity, it may reduce the phosphorylation of β-catenin at serine 552 and the
  nucleocytoplasmic transporter 14-3-3 to limit its nuclear import. SAMe and MTA may
  also potentially prevent β-catenin nuclear transport by disrupting its interaction
  with proteins of the nuclear pore complex. In addition, SAMe and MTA may enhance
  the export of β-catenin by enhancing Chibby and/or 14-3-3 to translocate to the
  nucleus, where, when phosphorylated by nuclear AKT, interact with β-catenin, leading
  to nuclear export of β-catenin/Chibby/14-3-3 complex. Nuclear AKT may be immune
  to the effects of exogenously added SAMe and MTA. These hypothetical schemes remain
  to be examined. (B) SAMe and MTA reduce β-catenin protein levels in colon and liver
  cancer cells with intact wild-type Wnt signaling. SAMe and MTA enhance GSK3β-mediated
  degradation of β-catenin by elevating the activity of PP2A (indicated by lower levels
  of phospho-PP2Ac at tyrosine 307, the inactive form). More active PP2A can dephosphorylate
  AKT (threonine 308), reduce its activity, and thus reduce AKT-mediated inactivation
  of GSK3β at serine 9. The dashed arrows represent the lack of kinase activity toward
  its target substrate.
