caption: 'Short-patch (SP-) and long-patch base excision repair (LP-BER) sub-pathways.
  The damaged base is recognized and excised by a DNA glycosylase, resulting often
  in AP site formation, which is further processed by APE1. Subsequent end-processing
  generates 3′-OH and 5′-phosphate (5′-P) termini, enabling access of repair Pols.
  Depending on the number of newly incorporated nucleotides, the BER pathway divides
  into two sub-pathways: short-patch BER (SP-BER) and long-patch BER (LP-BER). (A)
  In SP-BER, a Pol β-mediated single nucleotide incorporation is followed by strand
  ligation, catalyzed by the XRCC1/DNA ligase III complex; (B) In contrast, LP-BER
  synthesizes a repair patch consisting of 2–12 nucleotides by: (i) the Hit-and-Run
  mechanism involving alternating FEN1 cleavage and Pols β synthesis; or (ii) the
  strand-displacement DNA synthesis concerted by Pols β and δ/ɛ. The 5′-flap, created
  during strand-displacement DNA synthesis, is removed by the FEN1 generating a nick.
  The FEN1 created nick is sealed by DNA ligase I. For more details see text.'
