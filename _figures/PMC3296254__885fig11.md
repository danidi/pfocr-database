caption: Schematic diagram of the SPS-sensing pathway of extracellular amino acids.
  (A) In cells grown in the absence of inducing amino acids (left), the SPS sensor
  of extracellular amino acids is present in the plasma membrane (PM) in its preactivation
  conformation (), and the transcription of SPS-sensor-regulated genes, i.e., amino
  acid permeases (AAP), occurs at basal levels, and cells exhibit low rates of amino
  acid uptake. The transcription factors Stp1 and Stp2 (DNA-binding motifs, green
  boxes) are synthesized as inactive precursors that localize to the cytosol due to
  the presence of their N-terminal regulatory domain (anchor) that prevents them from
  efficiently entering the nucleus. Low levels of full-length Stp1 and Stp2 that escape
  cytoplasmic retention (dashed arrow, left panel) are prevented from derepressing
  AAP gene expression due to activity of the Asi complex (Asi1–Asi2–Asi3) (; ). In
  the presence of extracellular amino acids (right panel), the SPS (Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5)
  sensor activates the intrinsic proteolytic activity of the Ssy5 protease, resulting
  in the endoproteolytic processing of Stp1 and Stp2 (scissors). The shorter activated
  forms of Stp1 and Stp2 lacking regulatory domains are targeted to the nucleus where,
  together with Dal81, they bind SPS-sensor-regulated promoters (UASaa) and induce
  transcription (; ). The increased transcription of AAP genes results in increased
  rates of amino uptake. AAPs are cotranslationally inserted into the ER membrane,
  which is contiguous with the outer nuclear membrane. Movement of AAPs to the PM
  (represented by the dashed arrow, right panel) requires the ER membrane-localized
  chaperone Shr3 ( ; ). (B) Transporter-based model for Ssy1 amino acid receptor function
  (). Similar to canonical transporters, Ssy1 can attain four conformational states.
  However, in contrast to transporters, interconversion between the outward-facing
  ligand bound state and the inward-facing ligand bound state (reaction 3) is prevented
  by a ligand-induced reaction barrier. The outward-facing conformations of the Ssy1
  sensor are thought to be signaling (green), and the inward-facing conformations
  are nonsignaling (red). (C) Multistep regulation of the Ssy5 endoprotease. Ssy5
  is expressed as an inactive zymogen (left) composed of a prodomain that assists
  the folding of the Cat domain. Ssy5 is auto-processed when the Cat domain attains
  an active conformation. The noncovalently attached prodomain remains bound to the
  Cat domain, forming an inactive but catalytically competent “primed” protease complex.
  Primed Ssy5 is incorporated as a subcomplex of the SPS sensor via protein–protein
  interactions involving Ptr3, where it binds, but does not cleave, its substrates
  Stp1 and Stp2. In the absence of extracellular amino acids, i.e., under non-inducing
  conditions (left), the basal level of phosphorylation of a phosphodegron in the
  prodomain is likely to be determined by counteracting activities of casein kinase
  I (Yck1 and Yck2) and the phosphatase PP2A with its regulatory subunit Rts1 (Eckert-Boulet
  et al. 2006). In the presence of extracellular amino acids (right), the primary
  amino acid sensor Ssy1 is stabilized in a conformation that triggers intracellular
  signaling. This conformation increases the level of phosphorylation of the prodomain
  phosphodegron (), presumably by increasing the accessibility of Yck1 or Yck2. An
  increased level of phosphorylation within the degron provides the requisite surface
  recognized by the SCFGrr1 complex and subsequent polyubiquitylation of lysine residues
  of the degron. Concomitant with being ubiquitylated, the prodomain is directly targeted
  for degradation by the 26S proteasome, unfettering the Stp1 and Stp2 processing
  activity of the Cat domain.
