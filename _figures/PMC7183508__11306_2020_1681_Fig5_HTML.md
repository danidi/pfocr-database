caption: Expected metabolic pathway of maoto components. The expected metabolic pathway
  of maoto components was constructed based on the results of the differential analysis.
  Deionized mass (nominal) and retention time are represented in parentheses. Maoto-derived
  metabolites are surrounded by frames. Background colors represent the herbal origin.
  The compounds are divided into metabolites detected both in the maoto and plasma
  and those detected in the plasma only
