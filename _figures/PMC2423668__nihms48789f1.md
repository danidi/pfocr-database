caption: Two branches of TLR downstream signaling. All TLRs with the exception of
  TLR3 signal through the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway
  (red arrows). Upon ligand binding the cytoplasmic domain of TLRs, called the TIR
  domain, associates with an adaptor molecule, MyD88. The complex recruits IL-1 receptor-associated
  kinase (IRAK) that undergoes autophosphorylation, dissociates from the TLR signaling
  complex, and associates with TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). This association
  leads to the activation of NF-κB and MAPK that, in turn, up-regulate the expression
  of a core set of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. In addition to this MyD88-dependent
  pathway, TLR3 and TLR4 signal in a MyD88-independent manner (blue arrows) through
  the recruitment of another adapter molecule, the TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing
  IFNβ (TRIF). TRIF activates the interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 that up-regulates
  the expression of the IFNβ gene. TRIF also interacts with TRAF6 leading to the activation
  of NF-κB and MAPK, and consequently to up-regulated expression of cytokine genes.
