caption: Scheme on the antioxidant potential of the NRF2 signaling pathway and its
  pharmacologic targeting. (A) NRF2 is a basic region leucine zipper (bZip) transcription
  factor that makes dimers with proteins of the small MAF family. These heterodimers
  recognize an antioxidant response element (ARE) in about 250 genes (). The consensus
  sequence is taken from JASPAR () (B) Regulation of NRF2/KEAP1 by electrophilic compounds.
  Under basal homeostatic conditions, NRF2 binds a KEAP1 homodimer through two tethering
  sites of low affinity (DLG) and high affinity (ETGE) located at the Neh2 domain.
  KEAP1 is a redox-sensitive E3 ligase adapter that leads to Cul3/Rbx-mediated ubiquitination
  of NRF2 and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Adduct formation with electrophiles
  induces a conformational change in KEAP1 that prevents further degradation of NRF2
  (). (C) Regulation of NRF2/PTEN by electrophilic compounds. The lipid phosphatase
  activity of PTEN eliminates 3-phosphoinositides required to activate AKT, thus yielding
  glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) active. GSK-3 phosphorylates NRF2 in several
  residues (DSGIS) of the Neh6 domain and creates a phosphodegron that is recognized
  by the E3 ligase adapter, β-TrCP. This process leads to a Cul1/Rbx-mediated ubiquitination
  and further proteasome degradation of NRF2. However, some electrophiles react with
  the critical C124 residue of PTEN located at the catalytic center to inhibit this
  enzyme. Then, 3-phosphoinositide levels remain high, leading to enhanced activation
  of AKT and inhibition of GSK-3. Under these conditions, NRF2 escapes GSK-3-mediated
  phosphorylation and recognition by the β-TrCP/Cul1/Rbx ubiquitin ligase (, ). AKT,
