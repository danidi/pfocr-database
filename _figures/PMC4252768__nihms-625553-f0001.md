caption: In the absence of canonical Wnt, cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated
  by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and casein kinase 1α (CK1α). These form a recognition
  complex that recruits other components of the “destruction complex” – AXIN and adenomatous
  polyposis coli (APC), to ubiquitinate β-catenin for proteasomal degradation. Interaction
  of canonical Wnts with Frizzled receptors and LRP 5/6 at the cell surface leads
  to recruitment and activation of the disheveled (DSH) protein. Active DSH inhibits
  the “destruction complex” proteins by recruiting AXIN to the cell plasma membrane,
  which binds to the cytoplasmic side of receptor-related protein 5/6 (LRP 5/6) co-receptors.
  This inhibits the degradation complex, promotes the accumulation of β-catenin and
  its translocation to the nucleus. Increased levels of nuclear β-catenin leads to
  transcriptional activation of target genes via interaction with DNA-bound transcriptional
  factors like T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF). The β-catenin-independent
  pathways are activated by non-canonical Wnt and specific combinations of Frizzled
  receptors. One branch of the non-canonical pathway involves the activation of small
  GTPases – Rho and Rac; the DSH–Rho and DSH-Rac GTPase complexes activate JUN N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) to regulate the cell polarity pathway (PCP). Another branch, when activated,
  leads to phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels that
  further activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMKII) and protein
  kinase C (PKC). Both of these kinases can activate the nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT) transcription factor to regulate gene expression. This signaling
  branch has been shown to mediate cell proliferation, migration and movement. Also,
  both CAMKII and PKC can block the canonical Wnt–β-catenin pathway by inhibiting
  β-catenin-dependent transcription of target genes.
