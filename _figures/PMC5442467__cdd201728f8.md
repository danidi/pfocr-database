caption: Summary of the impact of keratins on the Notch1 signalling pathway. K8/K18
  bind Notch1, which increases NICD levels and enhances transcription of Notch1 target
  genes Hey1 and Hey2. Therefore, the lack of K8 in the K8−/− colon leads to decreased
  levels of FLN and NICD, and thus decreased target gene transcription. The lack of
  keratins leads to a Notch1-dependent shift in colonic epithelial cell differentiation
  with elevated number of goblet cells and EEC and a decreased number of enterocytes
