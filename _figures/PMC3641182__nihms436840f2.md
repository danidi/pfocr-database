caption: Humanin has been shown to possess both intra- and extra-cellular modes of
  action. Within a cell, humanin interacts with pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax
  and IGFBP-3, thereby preventing apoptosis. Extracellular humanin also regulates
  important cellular processes such as survival, metabolism, and inflammation via
  two types of cell surface receptors; a trimeric receptor involving CNTFR/WSX-1/gp130,
  which relays signals through the STAT3 signaling pathway, and the formyl-peptide
  receptor-like-1 (FPRL1), which relays signals through the ERK 1/2 signaling cascade.
