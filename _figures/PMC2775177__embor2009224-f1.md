caption: Branches of the UPR signalling pathway. The ER resident BiP (Hsp70) binds
  the luminal tails of PERK, ATF6 and IRE1 to suppress their activity. When the levels
  of unfolded protein are elevated, BiP is titrated away, enhancing PERK-dependent
  phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α, which leads to the suppression
  of protein synthesis and the activation of the transcription factor ATF4. Concomitantly,
  IRE1 is activated to mediate the expression of Xbp1/Hac1, which drives a global
  transcriptional induction of chaperones and quality control factors that maintain
  unfolded protein levels within a narrow range. When the stress that triggers UPR
  is chronic or extremely severe, PERK signalling drives the ATF4-dependent expression
  of the transcription factor CHOP, and its downstream products trigger apoptotic
  cell death. ATF4/6, activating transcription factor 4/6; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy-chain-binding
  protein; CHOP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α; Hac1, homologous to ATF6/CrebI;
  Hsp70, heat-shock protein 70; IRE1, inositol-requiring enzyme 1; PERK, double-stranded
  RNA-dependent protein kinase-like ER; UPR, unfolded protein response; Xbp1, X-box
  binding protein 1.
