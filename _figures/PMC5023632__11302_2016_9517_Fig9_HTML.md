caption: Possible mechanism for cross talk between P2X7 nucleotide receptor and canonical
  Wnt signaling pathways in cells of the osteoblast lineage. The P2X7 and Wnt/β-catenin
  pathways regulate osteoblast differentiation and are critical for anabolic responses
  of the skeleton to mechanical load. Activation of canonical Wnt signaling by Wnt3a
  alone elicits a sustained increase in β-catenin nuclear localization and transcriptional
  activity (left panel). Activation of P2X7 receptor signaling causes inhibitory phosphorylation
  of GSK3β and promotes transient nuclear localization of β-catenin but fails to elicit
  changes in β-catenin transcriptional activity (middle panel). Notably, stimulation
  of P2X7 receptors in the presence of Wnt3a leads to a dramatic potentiation of β-catenin
  nuclear localization and transcriptional activity compared to Wnt3a alone (right
  panel). Mechanistically, this potentiation may be mediated in part through mutual
  inhibition of GSKβ. Taken together, this study provides the first evidence of cross
  talk between the P2X7 and Wnt/β-catenin pathways, a novel mechanism through which
  osteoblast activity may be modulated in response to mechanically-induced ATP release
  in bone
