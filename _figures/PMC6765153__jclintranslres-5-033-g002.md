caption: . A network analysis of predicted targets of miR-29-3p, miR-584-5p, and miR-1247-5p
  as performed by ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). Nodes represent signaling pathways,
  and lines are protein targets that are common between nodes. Nodes labeled with
  pathways are previously associated with inflammation, cardiac necrosis, and fibrosis.
  p53 and TGF-β signaling pathways are highlighted in red as they are pathways consistent
  with GO term analysis. Full list of top 20 predicted pathway by IPA is available
  in Supplementary Table 3.
