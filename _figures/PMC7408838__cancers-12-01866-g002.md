caption: 'SRC-mediated molecular pathways formally assessed in malignant mesothelioma
  (MM). Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are frequently overexpressed and hyperactivated
  in MM and cooperatively interact with SRC to signal to downstream effectors, such
  as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways, which promote cell
  proliferation and survival. Moreover, SRC and AKT cooperate to inactivate the nuclear
  tumor suppressor activity of p27: SRC accelerates p27 proteasome-mediated proteolysis
  (dotted X across p27), whereas AKT inhibits p27 through various mechanisms (mentioned
  in the main text), including the delay in its nuclear import (black X across the
  arrow). SRC also induces the expression of the CCND1 gene encoding cyclin D1, via
  activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Cyclin
  D1-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 complex, which is a crucial component of the
  cell cycle machinery, can sequester p27, thus further contributing to the inhibition
  of its tumor-suppressive action. Different studies also implicated SRC in molecular
  pathways controlling MM cell communication, migration, and invasion. In particular,
  a crucial interacting partner of SRC is the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a signaling
  component of focal adhesions, which are dynamic structures forming at the sites
  where integrins link the cytoskeleton to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The
  mutually activated FAK-SRC complex promotes cell movement and invasion by affecting
  multiple downstream pathways. Merlin, which is a tumor suppressor protein frequently
  lost in MM (red X across merlin) and involved in the maturation of adherens junctions
  (cell-cell adhesion structures composed of cadherin and catenin proteins), negatively
  regulates the FAK-SRC signaling. Thus, merlin loss could be an important step in
  the development of the invasive properties of MM cells since it leads to the de-repression
  of the FAK-SRC pathway (black X across the inhibitory connector). SRC is also involved
  in mediating MM cell migration and invasion induced by high cell surface levels
  of the transmembrane glycoprotein CD26. In particular, CD26 induces the nuclear
  translocation of the transcription factor TWIST1 via SRC activation; this results
  in enhanced expression and secretion of periostin, a matricellular protein involved
  in the promotion of cell migration and invasion. SRC is also implicated in controlling
  the gap junction (GJ) intercellular communication, which occurs through the pore-forming
  proteins connexins (CXs) and is markedly reduced in MM cells. In particular, CX43,
  the most widely expressed GJ protein, is a direct substrate of SRC.'
