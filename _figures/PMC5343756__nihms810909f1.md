caption: miRNA biogenesis initiates in the nucleus with transcription of primary miRNA
  transcripts from miRNA coding genes by RNA Polymerase II or III. pri-miRNA converted
  to hair-pin loop pre-miRNA by enzymatic digestion with Drosha and DGCR8 proteins.
  Pre-miRNA is transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5/Ran/GTP proteins and is
  digested by the cytoplasmic proteins Dicer/TRBP and generates miRNA duplex. The
  duplex structure is unwound by helicase, and a mature miRNA strand is generated.
  Mature miRNAs form the RISC complex with the Ago2 protein. The mature miRNAs target
  the 3′UTR of mRNA and modulate gene activity either by suppressing mRNA cleavage
  or the translation.
