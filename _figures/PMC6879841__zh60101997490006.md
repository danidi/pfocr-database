caption: Pathway diagram of glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle highlighting metabolites that differed between control (CON) and
  intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) fetal skeletal muscle and plasma. Selected
  metabolites are shown from the top 30 variable importance in projection scores that
  were higher (green), lower (red), or unchanged (black) in IUGR (n = 10) fetal skeletal
  muscle (M) and/or femoral arterial and venous plasma (AV) when compared with CON
  (n = 8) fetuses. The gene expression of selected enzymes (italics) in the fetal
  skeletal muscle also are shown. PPP production of ribose was lower in IUGR muscle
  and AV, as was adenosine in IUGR muscle for DNA/RNA and ATP production. Despite
  lower glycolytic intermediates in IUGR AV, pyruvate concentrations were higher in
  IUGR muscle. LDHA, LDHB, and PDH expressions was lower in IUGR muscle, and alanine
  concentrations were higher in IUGR AV, supporting alanine release from muscle, as
  opposed to lactate production or conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA for entry
  into the TCA cycle. Lysine and its catabolic product α-hydroxyglutarate were higher
  in IUGR muscle, yet α-ketoglutarate concentrations were unchanged; leucine/isoleucine
  concentrations also were higher in IUGR muscle, yet BCAT expression was lower, further
  supporting limited substrate entry into the TCA cycle in IUGR muscle. Finally, intermediates
  in the arginine synthesis pathway were lower in IUGR muscle. ALT, alanine aminotransaminase
  1; BCAT1, branched-chain amino acid transaminase 1; BCAT2, branched-chain amino
  acid transaminase 2; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; G3P, sn-glycerol 3-phosphate;
  LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; LDHB, lactate dehydrogenase B; PC, pyruvate carboxylase;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4; PFK, phosphofructokinase;
  PK, pyruvate kinase.
