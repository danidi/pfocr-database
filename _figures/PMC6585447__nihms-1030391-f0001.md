caption: Glycolysis and energy metabolism pathways - Glycolysis is the major metabolic
  pathway in the cell cytoplasm. HK2 binds to the mitochondrial outer-membrane (MOM)-associated
  voltage-dependent anion-selective channel-1 (VDAC-1) to gain a preferential access
  to the mitochondrially-generated ATP. The first step of glycolysis is initiated
  by hexokinase 2 (HK2) that catalyzes the phosphorylation of one glucose molecule
  [imported from the extracellular space via glucose transporters (GT)] to glucose-6-phosphate
  (glucose-6P). Following 9 successive reactions, one glucose-6P molecule is converted
  into two pyruvate molecules (+2 ATP molecules). Depending on the oxygen (O2) level,
  the pyruvate metabolism pathway takes place either aerobically or anaerobically.
  (a) In aerobic conditions (+O2), pyruvate is transported to the mitochondrial matrix
  via VDAC-1 and the mitochondria inner membrane (MIM)-associated pyruvate transporter
  (PT), where it is oxidized into acetyl CoA (+2 ATP/glucose) and then metabolized
  in the Krebs cycle (+2 ATP/glucose) followed by oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos;
  ~32 ATP/glucose). (b) In anaerobic conditions (−O2), pyruvate is reduced by L-lactate
  dehydrogenase (L-LDHa) into L-lactate (+2 ATP/glucose) that is secreted into the
  extracellular space via lactate transporter (LT). (c) In many cancer cells, the
  pyruvate anaerobic pathway occurs even in the presence of O2 and fully functioning
  mitochondria – this is called the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis). In the latter,
  cancer cells show a high rate of glycolysis concomitant with an increased glucose
  uptake and lactate production. - Other proteins depicted in the schematic - ATP-α
  and ATP-β, ATP synthase a and β subunits form a complex that undergoes a sequence
  of conformational changes leading to the formation of ATP from ADP and inorganic
  phosphate (Pi); ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase serves as a transporter for
  ADP and ATP. GRP78, 78kDa glucose-regulated protein is a chaperone protein that
  targets mitochondrial compartment in the endoplasmic reticulum-stress response in
  apoptosis signaling pathway. VDAC-1 “opened” and “closed” configurations - In both
  VDAC-1●HK2 and VDAC-1●ANT complexes the VDAC-1 pore is in its ‘opened” configuration
  allowing metabolites (e.g. pyruvate, ADP and ATP) to freely circulate between the
  cytoplasm and the mitochondrial matrix. Both methyl jasmonate (MJ) and free tubulin
  lead to VDAC-1 “closed” configuration and apoptosis. MJ binding to HK2 dissociates
  the latter from VDAC-1 that becomes free to interact with pro-apoptotic molecules,
  whereas free tubulin penetrates into the VDAC-1 channel pore to block channel conductance,
  leading to cell death.
