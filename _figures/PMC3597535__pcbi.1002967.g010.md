caption: Maximally differentially expressed path identification by DEAP on the Notch
  signalling pathway. Pathway image is from PANTHER , . The path shaded in purple
  was identified by DEAP as the most differentially expressed. Numerical values are
  log-expression ratios from the Interferon microarray study , .
