caption: Multiple nonunidirectional levels through which autophagy-related processes
  in senescence affect regulation of SASP genes, often via NFkB activation. Activation
  of macroautophagy as an effector of senescence and spatial coupling of mTOR with
  autolysosomes lead to mTOR activation, which has been proposed to modulate SASP
  expression through multiple mechanisms. Autophagy-mediated degradation of Lamin
  B1 also promotes CCF formation, which up-regulates SASP genes through the cGAS–STING
  pathway. This has been suggested to occur by both nuclear membrane blebbing, which
  shuttles LADs to the cytoplasm, and loss of nuclear envelope integrity, which allows
  the escape of chromatin fragments. However, the activation of general autophagy
  during senescence is accompanied by an inhibition of p62-mediated selective autophagy,
  allowing stabilization of the GATA4 transcription factor, which regulates SASP genes
  via NFkB.
