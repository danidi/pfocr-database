caption: Model for P2X7R-induced signalling pathway involved in MP shedding and large
  pore opening in glial cells. On BzATP stimulation, P2X7R activates p38 MAPK cascade
  through src kinase-mediated phosphorylation. In turn, P-p38 triggers different pathways,
  among which PM pore formation (a), and mobilisation of A-SMase from luminal lysosomal
  compartment to PM outer leaflet (b) where the enzyme alters membrane structure/fluidity
  leading to PM blebbing and shedding. Differently from exosomes, shed MPs carry IL-1β
  cytokine, present A-SMase and high levels of PS on their membrane outer leaflet
  and are 100–1000 nm in size.
