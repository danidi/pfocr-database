caption: Simplified model for the symbiotic signaling pathway in legumes. Symbiotic
  genes identified in M. truncatula and L. japonicus are listed and classified in
  main symbiotic functions., Putative orthologs were searched in the Illumina transcriptome
  of the two mapping parents. Those that could not be identified are between parentheses.
  Genes highlighted in bold characters are those which were demonstrated to be involved
  in the Nod-independent nodulation process in A. evenia.,

  new light on the evolution of nodulation and legume genomes.
