caption: Reaction pathway of monoamine metabolism by oxidative deamination by mitochondrial
  MAO. The primary product of MAO acting on a monoamine is the corresponding aldehyde,
  usually rapidly further oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADH) to a carboxylic
  acid, which is the final excreted metabolite. Note also that the FAD-FADH2cycle
  generates hydrogen peroxide which itself requires inactivation by catalase or, in
  the brain, glutathione peroxidase (see also ).
