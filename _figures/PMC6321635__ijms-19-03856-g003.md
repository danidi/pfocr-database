caption: '(A) The structure of neoformed vessels in most important brain tumors, such
  as glioblastoma, is often abnormal with permeability of BBB. VEGF is the major angiogenetic
  factor: it can be produced by cancer cells (mainly in hypoxic areas), MCs, PMNs
  and Macrophages. VEGF acting on TJs proteins synthesis, can enhance vessels permeability.
  Endothelial angiopoietin (ANGPT2) promote the recruitment of proangiogenic, M2-polarised
  macrophages. In endothelial cells the Ang/Tie pathway can regulate pathological
  vascular remodeling and vascular permeability during the processes of inflammation,
  tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. The same pathway can also be activated in macrophages
  and cancer cells. NK cells in GBM may exert a preferential killing activity of GBM
  stem-like cells. NK cells, by cytokine secretion, could be able to exchange TAMs
  polarization from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory phenotype; (B) In subjects
  affected by sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) Aβ amyloid accumulation is due to
  a reduced clearance from the brain, ascribable to reduced metabolism, diminished
  efflux across the BBB or decreased CSF bulk flow through glymphatic system. Both
  brain-derived and peripheral Aβ amyloid are transported through BBB by receptor-mediated
  transcytosis. Microglial cells can be activated by Aβ fibrils interacting with several
  receptors, thus inducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Neutrophil
  Extracellular Traps (NETs) are fibers of decompacted chromatin decorated with antimicrobial
  proteins and histones originating from PMNs that can contribute to the activation
  of microglia and BBB leakage. Aβ amyloid causes MCs degranulation contributing also
  in such a way to neuroinflammation (NI).'
