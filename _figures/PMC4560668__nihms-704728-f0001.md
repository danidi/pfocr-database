caption: This overview provides comparisons and contrasts between the current model
  and the emerging model. A) The prevailing dogma for canonical WNT signaling denotes
  that in absence of a WNT signal, β-catenin is phosphorylated at N-terminal sites
  by the multi-protein degradation complex. Phosphorylated β-catenin is targeted for
  ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. WNT binding to the
  frizzled/LRP co-receptor complex promotes association of AXIN1 to the phosphorylated
  tail of LRP resulting in disassociation of the degradation complex and stabilization
  of β-catenin. Unphosphorylated β-catenin accumulates in the cytoplasm and translocates
  to the nucleus where it can restore transcriptional activity of TCF/LEF genes normally
  bound by repressor complexes containing Groucho-related proteins. B) An emerging
  view of canonical WNT signaling relies on an intact degradation complex to regulate
  β-catenin. In the absence of a WNT signal, the degradation complex binds β-catenin
  and subsequent phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteosomal degradation occur
  within the AXIN1/GSK3β/APC complex. In the presence of a WNT signal, activation
  of the frizzled /LRP co-receptors promotes association of the intact AXIN1 degradation
  complex with the phosphorylated tail of LRP and the disassociation of β-TrCP. The
  degradation complex still binds and phosphorylates β-catenin, but ubiquitination
  by β-TrCP fails to occur. Phosphorylated β-catenin saturates the complex, effectively
  inactivating the complex and allowing newly synthesized β-catenin to initiate gene
  transcription. Figure modified from Clevers and Nusse (2012), for details see .
