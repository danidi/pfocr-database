caption: S. aureus enzymes are shown in red, while isoforms in other organisms are
  depicted in black (). Initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis requires malonyl-ACP,
  formed from acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Acc) and malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase
  (FabD). The β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase FabH (KAS III) performs the first Claisen condensation
  yielding a β-ketoacyl-ACP from malonyl-ACP and an acyl-CoA primer. The two carbons
  originating from malonyl-ACP are shown in cyan and the first two primer carbons
  in red. Subsequently, the β-ketoacyl-ACP is converted to a saturated acyl-ACP by
  the actions of the NADPH-dependent reductase FabG, the dehydrase FabZ, and the mostly
  NADH-dependent enzyme FabI. The saturated acyl-ACP is a substrate for additional
  rounds of elongation in which FabF catalyzes the condensation reaction. The long-chain
  acyl-ACP products are subsequently partially transformed into membrane lipids (a
  typical S. aureus phosphatidylglycerol is shown ()). Most bacteria use acetyl-CoA
  as the primer which results in straight-chain fatty acids (C14 and C16) (), however,
  S. aureus FabH prefers branched-chain acyl-CoAs which yield branched-chain fatty
  acids (). The branched-chain primers isobutyryl-CoA, isovaleryl-CoA and 2-methylbutyryl-CoA
  are derived from valine, leucine and isoleucine, respectively, through the actions
  of the branched-chain aminotransferase BAT (ilvE ()), and the branched-chain α-ketoacid
  dehydrogenase BKD (lpd, bkdA1, bkdA2 and bkdB ()). The branched-chain acyl-CoAs
  yield iso-C14 and iso-C16 (isobutyryl), iso-C15 and iso-C17 (isovaleryl), and anteiso-C15
  and anteiso-C17 (2-methylbutyryl) fatty acids (). Exogenous fatty acids are converted
  into acyl-ACPs by the acyl-ACP synthetase (AAS) for incorporation into cell membranes.
  Typical fatty acids of the human blood plasma are palmitic (21.3%) and linoleic
  acid (23.7%) (). For S. aureus, exogenous oleic acid was only incorporated in the
  1-position of phosphatidylglycerol (). Inhibitors of the NADPH-dependent FabI from
  S. aureus (saFabI) used in this study include 5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol
  (triclosan), 5-chloro-2-phenoxyphenol (CPP) and 5-ethyl-2-phenoxyphenol (EPP) ().
