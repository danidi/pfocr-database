caption: Presumable molecular mechanisms induced by fasting and anticancer treatment
  to promote intracellular changes and autophagy induction in tumor cells. I) Fasting
  may oppose the Warburg effect (glucose breakdown by glycolysis even in the presence
  of oxygen), favoring oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells and resulting in increased
  ROS production and reduced levels of lactate and possibly ATP. The increase in the
  ADP/ATP ratio can activate the AMPK pathway, leading to autophagy induction. Moreover,
  the sustained stressful environment can result in cell death induction. II) Several
  tumors harbor mutations that favor MAPK pathway hyperactivation, which enables tumor
  cell growth, survival and proliferation. Therapies targeting this pathway, as well
  as fasting, may result in the downregulation of this pathway alongside a reduction
  in AKT and mTOR activation, resulting in autophagy induction and cell death. III)
  Furthermore, fasting potentiates the detrimental effects of chemotherapy, such as
  DNA damage, thus activating the cell death machinery, deregulating pro- and antiapoptotic
  proteins, and inducing mitochondrial alterations and caspase activation, which in
  turn culminates in apoptosis.
