caption: Model of the pathway to parasitism of the bone microenvironment by prostate
  cancer. Primary tumors represent a heterogeneous population of cancer cells, some
  of which intravasate into the blood circulation to become circulating tumor cells
  (CTCs). A subset of CTCs may successfully target the bone microenvironment through
  such mechanisms as chemotaxis toward CXCL12 (also called stromal-derived factor)
  through its receptor CXCR4 and then docking to osteoblasts annexin II receptor (AX2R)
  binding to annexin II (AX2). On docking to the osteoblasts, the PCa cells, similar
  to hematopoietic stem cells, enter a dormant state. Multiple changes, perhaps in
  the PCa cells themselves and/or in the bone microenvironment, result in escape from
  dormancy. The PCa cells may then act as a CSC undergoing both self-renewal and differentiation
  into clinically detectable metastasis. Host cells, such as macrophages, enter the
  tumor microenvironment and, through both cell-to-cell interactions and release of
  various cytokines, influence the progression of tumor growth at the metastatic site.
