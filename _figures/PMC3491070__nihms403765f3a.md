caption: 'A. The PI3K/Akt axis can be activated downstream of RTK activation or as
  a downstream effector of activated Ras. PTEN is a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt
  pathway. mTORC1 can become activated upon Akt-mediated phosphorylation of either
  of two mTORC1 inhibitors: TSC2 (part of the TSC1-TSC2 complex) or PRAS40. Conversely,
  mTORC1 activity can be suppressed through AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of either
  TSC2 or RAPTOR. Finally, amino acids can activate mTORC1 by modulating the nucleotide
  loading states of Rag GTPases, which form obligate heterodimers consisting of RagA
  or RagB with Rag C or Rag D. Further description of amino acid-dependent activation
  of mTORC1 and the additional molecular components of this pathway are reviewed elsewhere
  (). AMPK itself is activated by the upstream kinase LKB1. Among the downstream targets
  of mTORC1-dependent translation are the transcription factors HIF-1, Myc, and SREBP-1.HIF-1
  stabilization is repressed by VHL under normoxic conditions. p53 also has a multifaceted
  role in metabolic control, which includes involvement in a positive feedback loop
  with AMPK.RTK – receptor tyrosine kinase. PTEN – phosphatase and tensin homolog.

  glucose metabolism in a similar manner to HIF. Additionally, Myc stimulates the
  expression of glutamine transporters, and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and
  entry of glutamine carbon into the TCA cycle. SREBP-1 induces the expression of
  several genes involved in fatty acid synthesis. p53 affects glucose metabolism through
  repression of glucose transporters and glycolytic activity, while also transcriptionally
  promoting oxidative phosphorylation. Akt promotes membrane translocation of glucose
