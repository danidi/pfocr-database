caption: Diagrammatic illustration of the dual mode of Rho function in keratinocyte
  differentiation. As discussed in the text, available data are consistent with a
  model whereby activation of the RhoA pathway plays a positive role at early times
  of keratinocyte differentiation, promoting establishment of cell–cell adhesion through
  activation of a specific effector, the PKN/PRK2 kinase. Rho signaling can have a
  second suppressive function on downstream gene expression events associated with
  differentiation. Such inhibitory function is mediated by a specific Rho effector,
  CRIK (Citron kinase), which is selectively down-modulated with differentiation,
  through an as yet uncharacterized mechanism, thereby allowing the normal process
  to occur.
