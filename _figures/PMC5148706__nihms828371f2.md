caption: ITSN-L interacts with the Rho GTPase Cdc42, its effector N-WASP and the WASP
  interacting protein WIP. N-WASP and WIP also bind each other. Interaction between
  ITSN-L and N-WASP activates N-WASP, which binds the Arp2/3 complex, resulting in
  the stimulation of the actin filament nucleation and initiation of actin polymerization.
