caption: Proposed three-pathway model for spontaneous lesion bypass by RAD6 epistasis
  group members. Bypass of spontaneous damage (indicated as X) can be processed by
  Rad6-Rad18-controlled or Rad5-controlled error-prone pathways, which have overlapping
  specificities for lesion bypass. The Rad18-controlled error-prone pathway requires
  simultaneous K127 sumoylation and K164 ubiquitination of PCNA, whereas the Rad5-controlled
  error-prone pathway requires simultaneous sumoylation of both K164 and K127 of PCNA.
  Mms2 is not required for the Rad5-dependent error-prone arm. An error-free pathway
  is composed of Rad6, Rad18, Rad5, Mms2, and Ubc13 and requires multi-ubiquitination
  of K164 of PCNA. SUMO is depicted as an open circle; ubiquitin is depicted as a
  solid circle. See text for details.
