caption: 'The complement system and crosstalk with other innate immune effector systems
  in liver IRI, regeneration, and transplantation. The complement system is activated
  by endogenously derived DAMPs in IRI, regeneration, and transplantation. The activation
  products from the complement cascade activate cells by binding to cell receptors,
  which frequently crosstalk with receptors and mediators of a number of effector
  molecules and mechanisms downstream in the innate and adaptive immune system. The
  most important complement effector molecules are C3a, C5a, and C5b‐9. C4d is a split
  product of the classical and lectin pathway activation and is covalently bound to
  cell membranes. If immunohistopathological staining in liver biopsies from liver
  grafts shows binding of C4d, AMR is suspected. Complement activates other effector
  systems, which frequently crosstalk and activate complement, consistent with a widespread
  bilateral and multilateral crosstalk between the complement system and these other
  effector systems. In particular, abundant crosstalk occurs with the hemostatic system
  (“thromboinflammation”) including the other plasma cascades and the platelets. Complement
  activation promotes hemostasis by several routes; C5a activation of C5aR1 on monocytes
  and endothelial cells induces up‐regulation of tissue factor (not shown) and thereby
  promotes coagulation through the extrinsic pathway. C3a binding to C3aR on platelets
  primes the cell for activation and insertion of MAC through the platelet membrane,
  promoting release of prothrombotic platelet microvesicles. Furthermore, there is
  an extensive crosstalk between complement and granulocytes, releasing enzymes like
  matrix metalloproteinases, and reactive oxygen species. Finally, there are advanced
  crosslinks between complement and the TLRs, producing a range of proinflammatory
  and anti‐inflammatory cytokines, and with the inflammasome. This crosstalk may lead
  to a synergistic effect on the effector mechanisms involved and thereby produce
  a stronger inflammatory response. The main cellular players in these mechanisms,
  except for hepatocytes, are granulocytes, endothelial cells, platelets, dendritic
  cells, monocytes, and macrophages/Kupffer cells. Although there is much overlap
  with respect to the complement‐induced activation of the different cells, granulocytes
  typically produce and release proteases and ROS; endothelial cells express adhesion
  molecules; and macrophages/Kupffer cells, monocytes, and dendritic cells typically
  up‐regulate TLRs and their coreceptor CD14, produce and release cytokines, and assemble
  and activates the inflammasome. Platelets are increasingly recognized as important
  immune cells and can display or release all of the effector molecules shown, in
  particular dependent on the C5b‐9 insertion. Abbreviations: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase;
