caption: An illustration of the role played by allostery on diversified cellular pathways
  with signaling through a single G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Initially, the
  two main branching pathways divide through an allosteric conformational selection
  of distinct GPCR active states by various types of agonist binding. In the agonist
  (G protein-dependent) pathway, the activated GPCR either activates the heterotrimeric
  G proteins which then promote the consequent signaling of the second messenger such
  as cyclic AMP, or recruits the GPCR kinases (GRKs) to phosphorylate Ser/Thr in the
  cytoplasmic loops and tail of the GPCR which in turn enable the recruitment of β-arrestins
  to mediate receptor desensitization and internalization. In the biased agonist (arrestin-dependent)
  pathway, distinct active GPCR conformations activate different sets of GRKs to create
  distinct phosphorylation patterns (barcodes) on GPCR. It is the barcode [, ] that
  imparts distinct conformations, which in turn recruit arrestins with diverse conformations
  (illustrated in different colors in the Figure) to mediate different signaling pathways
  such as the ERK1/2 activation. Recruitment can be either through orthosteric or
  allosteric interactions.
