caption: Metabolic pathways contributing to glutamine addiction in gliomas. Firstly,
  glutamine transport via Slc1a5 transporter (ASCT2) is increased in gliomas. The
  promoters of the Slc1a5 gene are under transcriptional control of oncogenic transcription
  factor c-MYC, which upregulates its expression. A substantial portion of intracellular
  glutamine is released from the cell via transporter LAT1 (Slc7a5; also upregulated
  by c-MYC) in exchange for extracellular leucine, an essential amino acid. The glutamine–leucine
  shuttle directly activates mTOR signaling, leading to increased protein synthesis.
  That way, an abundance of glutamine further accelerates the glioma anabolism. When
  in the cell, glutamine may be converted by glutaminase to glutamate, which is then
  metabolized to (i) alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) (by transaminases GPT and GOT or glutamate
  dehydrogenase, GLUD) and serves for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle anaplerosis;
  the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase (PC), generating oxaloacetate (OAA)
  from pyruvate, is downregulated in most neoplasms; (ii) oncometabolite D-2-hydroxyglutate
  (D2HG) in the case of mutations in IDH1 enzyme, leading to a loss of proper enzymatic
  activity; iii) antioxidant glutathione (GSH), responsible for the treatment resistance;
  transporter XC- performs antiport of glutamate and cystine, which is a limiting
  substrate in GSH synthesis; and iv) lactate, which may be a source of energy when
  glutaminolysis takes place and the malate shuttle operates (malic enzyme synthetize
  lactate precursor, pyruvate, and NADPH) but also modulate tumor invasiveness via
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF); lactate
  was shown to stabilize HIF and then transactivate c-Myc in a pathway that mimics
  a response to hypoxia. In concordance to high lactate release observed in glioma,
  the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), responsible for lactate synthesis, has been often
  reported to be upregulated. Last, but not least, glutamine availability is a limiting
  step for pyrimidine synthesis that highly proliferative cells, such as gliomas,
  need to be kept high.
