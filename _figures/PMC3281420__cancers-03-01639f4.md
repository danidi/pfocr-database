caption: ATM kinase activity downregulates c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS at the protein level
  and connects DNA damage signaling to TRAIL-induced apoptosis signaling pathway.
  DNA damaging agents induce ATM activation, which promotes c-FLIPL protein degradation
  and c-FLIPS downregulation through an unknown mechanism (Stagni et al. []).
