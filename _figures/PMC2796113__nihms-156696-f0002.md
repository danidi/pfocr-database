caption: Models of Merlin-dependent membrane receptor distribution in flies and mammalian
  cells. Studies in flies and mammals both conclude that Merlin can control the surface
  abundance or distribution of EGFR (and other receptors in flies), but they seem
  to reach differing conclusions as to the proximal effect of Merlin on EGFR. (a)
  In flies, loss of Merlin and the related tumor suppressor Expanded yield increased
  surface abundance of and signaling from EGFR, suggesting that Merlin might normally
  promote receptor clearance (endocytosis and degradation) or inhibit receptor recycling.
  (b) In mammalian cells, loss of Merlin yields persistent EGFR internalization and
  signaling at high cell density, which does not occur in confluent wild-type cells,
  indicating that Merlin normally prevents EGFR endocytosis and signaling upon cell:cell
  contact. NHERF-1 is required for Merlin–EGFR interaction in mammalian cells. Merlin
  also complexes with both EGFR and E-cadherin upon cell:cell contact, which could
  facilitate the establishment of stable adherens junctions. We believe that the apparently
  contradictory conclusions of the fly and mammalian studies can be reconciled through
  the model shown in Figure 2c. This model posits that the primary function of Merlin
  is to direct EGFR to a specific membrane compartment from which it is poised to
  use a particular endocytic pathway.
