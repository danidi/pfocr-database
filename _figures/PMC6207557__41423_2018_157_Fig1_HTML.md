caption: Mechanisms by which rLrp inhibits the production of LPS-induced cytokines.
  In our study, we found that rLrp inhibited the production of LPS-induced TNF-α,
  IL-12, and IL-6. rLrp blocked the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor
  NF-κB and attenuated NF-κB transcriptional activity and DNA binding activity, which
  was accompanied by the degradation of IαBα. We then found that the binding of TRAF6
  to TAK-1 induced by LPS could be blocked by rLrp. Furthermore, in Akt protein kinase-silenced
  macrophages and TLR2–/– macrophages, rLrp did not attenuate the release of proinflammatory
  cytokines or the expression of MHC-II molecules and CD86 induced by interferon-γ,
  indicating that the inhibitory effects of rLrp depend on TLR2 and the activation
  of the PI3K/Akt pathway. rLrp could also stimulate the rapid phosphorylation/activation
  of PI3K, Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β in macrophages. LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; rLrp, recombinant Lrp; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF-α,
  tumor necrosis factor α; TRAF6, TNF receptor-associated factor 6.
