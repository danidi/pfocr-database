caption: Pathway of codlemone biosynthesis. Palmitic acyl (C16) is first formed by
  the fatty acid synthesis pathway. Lauric acyl (C12) is then produced following two
  recurring reactions of beta-oxidation. A first desaturation occurs, introducing
  an E9 double bond between carbons 9 and 10 from the carboxyl terminus. The resulting
  monoenoic fatty acyl is then the substrate of a second desaturation via the removal
  of hydrogen atoms at the carbons 8 and 11, causing the formation of a E8E10 conjugated
  diene system. Finally, an unknown fatty acyl-CoA reductase converts the fatty acyl
  precursor into the fatty alcohol (E8,E10)-8,10-dodecadienol commonly known as codlemone.
  The steps characterized in this study are highlighted in red
