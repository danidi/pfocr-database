caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms underlying the effects of BDNF
  on dendritic development of cortical neurons. (1–3) Binding of BDNF to its receptor
  TrkB activates MAPK signalling pathway, resulting in the increased phosphorylation
  of the MEK and ERK kinases and the transcription factor CREB. However, phosphorylation
  of CREB is not sufficient for the regulation of dendritic development by BDNF, which
  also requires the nuclear translocation of the CREB coactivator CRTC1. (4–7) Nuclear
  translocation of CRTC1 is triggered by activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate,
  resulting in stimulation of the Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein phosphatase
  calcineurin. Activation of calcineurin induces the dephosphorylation of CRTC1 and
  its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of cortical neurons. (8) Both
  the stimulation of CREB phosphorylation by BDNF and the induction of CRTC1 nuclear
  translocation by glutamate are required to increase cortical dendritic development.
