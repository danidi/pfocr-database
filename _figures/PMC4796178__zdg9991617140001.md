caption: Exercise-induced autophagy signaling. During muscle contraction, levels of
  calcium, NAD+, AMP, and ROS increase. These molecular messengers activate their
  respective downstream effectors, CaMK/calcineurin, SIRT1, AMPK, and p38. These,
  in turn, initiate both acute autophagy and potentiate a longer term transcriptional
  program. AMPK can lead to the activation of the autophagy induction complex by ULK1
  phosphorylation, as well as inhibition of mTOR, which normally acts to block autophagy.
  Autophagy induction is followed by nucleation and expansion of the autophagosome
  mediated by the beclin-1 complex and the lipidation of LC3 to LC3-II by a series
  of conjugation reactions by a series of autophagy-related proteins we termed the
  LC3 lipidation complex. The beclin-1 complex can also be antagonized by Bcl-2. During
  the cargo selection process, dysfunctional organelles (such as mitochondria) or
  protein aggregates are tagged for degradation by ubiquitin (Ub) and are subsequently
  recognized by the adaptor protein p62, which binds to Ub and coalesces the materials
  to be degraded into the growing autophagosome by interacting with LC3. Mitochondria
  can be tagged for degradation by ubiquitination of substrates on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane by the E3 Ub ligase parkin, or by mitochondria-specific receptors BNIP3/L,
  independent of Ub. The precise mechanism of cargo selection following exercise is
  yet to be elucidated. Once the cargo is engulfed, the mature autophagosome is sealed
  and delivered to the lysosome. The two then fuse together, and the contents are
  degraded by various hydrolases within the lysosomal lumen. Basic building blocks,
  such as animo acids (AAs) are then released and can negatively feed back on the
  pathway by reactivating mTOR. Long-term potentiation of an autophagy transcriptional
  pathway also occurs with exercise. Calcineurin can dephosphorylate the master regulator
  of the autophagy-lysosome system, TFEB, and allow its localization into the nucleus.
  p38 and ROS can also induce a p53-mediated transcriptional program, although that
  is yet to be confirmed. AMPK, p38, and SIRT1 can also activate FoxO-dependent gene
  transcription. Moreover, CaMK and calcineurin induce PGC-1α expression, while SIRT1,
  AMPK, and p38 upregulate PGC-1α activity. Once active in the nucleus, PGC-1α co-activates
  transcription factors, resulting in the increased expression of autophagy and lysosomal
  genes. See text for definition of acronyms.
