caption: Classical neuroimmune network. [Left] A feedback circuit exists between inflammatory
  cytokines and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Upon activation of
  the HPA axis and the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) following various
  physiologic or pathologic stress, adrenal cortex synthesizes glucocorticoids (GC)
  that can affect immune function by causing thymic involution, neutrophil (N) mobilization,
  eosinophil (Eo) accumulation, and myeloid and granulocyte differentiation, or polarize
  immune cells from inflammatory to tissue-protective non-inflamed phenotypes. GC
  upon binding with their receptors (GR) on macrophages (Mϕ) can switch their inflammatory
  cytokine secretions, such as TNFα, IFNγ and IL-1β, to tissue-protective types such
  as TGFβ and IL-10. [Right] Vagus nerve forms a synapse at the celiac ganglion with
  the adrenergic splenic nerve, which comes in contact with lymphocytes (Lym) expressing
  β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR). Norepinephrine (NE) released from the adrenergic
  splenic nerve terminals activates β2AR that facilitates the synthesis of acetylcholine
  (ACh) from lymphocytes (, ). The ACh thus released activates the cognate α7 nicotinic
  ACh receptors (α7nAChR) on intrasplenic or extrasplenic myeloid cells. Signal transduction
  following ACh-induced activation of α7nAChR decreases nuclear translocation of the
  nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), and inhibits
  inflammasome activity to reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines. This neuronal
  reflex circuit through the afferent vagus nerve, called cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  pathway, can attenuate the exacerbated “non-resolving inflammation” by suppressing
  accumulation of neutrophils and acting on Mϕ, dendritic cells (DC) and lymphocytes.
  It is also suggested that IL-1β receptors are present on vagal paraganglial glomus
  cells that can release neurotransmitters in response to hypoxemia, hypercapnia or
  acidosis. Downward arrows indicate a decrease in activity or number. Dotted lines
  indicate a feedback loop.
