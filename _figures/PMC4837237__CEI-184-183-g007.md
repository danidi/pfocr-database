caption: A simplified overview of the ectodysplasin/EDA‐receptor/nuclear factor kappa
  B (EDA/EDAR/NF‐κB) pathway. Trimeric receptor EDAR is activated by trimeric ligand
  EDA leading to the recruitment of the adaptor EDAR‐associated death (EDARADD) and
  to the formation of a complex containing EDARADD which ubiquitinates nuclear factor
  of kappa light chain gene enhancer in B cells (IkB) triggering to the release of
  NF‐κB transcription factor. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐κB) is then translocated
  into the nucleus to activate target genes. Strongly induced NF‐κB target genes include
  those that encode the negative regulators IkB alpha (IκBα) and A20.
