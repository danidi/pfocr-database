caption: A schematic diagram describing gene expression regulation during callus formation
  from immature and mature barley embryos. Dicamba (synthetic auxin) induces cell
  fate transition through the auxin signalling pathway, and more genes are included
  in the IME system (left) than in the IM system (right). Embryonic genes BBM, LEC1,
  and FUS3, shoot meristem gene WUS, and root meristem gene PLT2 displayed differential
  expression patterns between the two systems, resulted in the production of different
  types of callus. Embryonic callus (left) and non-embryonic callus (right) exhibit
  differential regeneration potential on shoot-inducing medium (SIM). Orange represents
  significantly upregulated genes, while blue represents genes that were activated
  slightly or remained unchanged. Epigenetic modification might be involved in regulating
  the expression status of regulatory genes in different explants and their responses
  to callus induction
