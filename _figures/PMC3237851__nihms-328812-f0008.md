caption: Proposed signaling pathway for the role of SGK1 in Ang II-mediated cell survival.
  Ang II acts via the AT1 receptor to 1) increase SGK1 mRNA and SGK1 protein levels
  via calcium and tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanisms and 2) increase SGK1 and FOXO3A
  phosphorylation levels via an mTORC1-dependent mechanism. The combined effect of
  increased SGK1 mRNA levels, increased SGK1 protein levels, and activation of existing
  pools of SGK1 protein via post translational phosphorylation, is an increase in
  overall cell survival.
