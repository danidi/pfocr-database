caption: Elements of the classical and alternative complement pathways, separated
  by the unique and common aspects. (a) Early steps of the classical pathway, to show
  activation and generation of C3 convertase enzymatic activity. C4b (soluble) is
  converted to C4b (membrane bound) via a thiol ester transesterification reaction
  (not shown in figure). (b) Early steps of the alternative pathway to show activation
  and generation of C3 convertase enzymatic activity. (c) Common aspects of complement
  pathway activation that result in macrophage and neutrophil recruitment and formation
  of the membrane attack complex, a cytolytic pore on the pathogen surface.
