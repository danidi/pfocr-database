caption: aPPD inhibits AR signaling pathway via inhibition of a site in the AR N-terminal
  domain. aPPD upregualted p21, p27, Bax and cleaved Caspase 3 levels in C4-2 tumors.
  The AR downregulation appears to be secondary to suppression of MDM2 in aPPD treated
  mice. aPPD binds to MDM2 proteins and activate p53 apoptosis signaling pathway,
  thus induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. This may result from indirect inhibition
  of the MDM2 by aPPD metabolite. Probably these levels of aPPD metabolites may be
  sufficient to promote p53 activation as well. An amino-terminal domain (NTD), DNA-binding
  domain (DBD), hinge region (H), ligand-binding domain (LBD). Mouse double minute
  (MDM2).
