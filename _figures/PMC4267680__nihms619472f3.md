caption: 'a, Low efficiency with some NHC–Cu-catalyzed reactions is due to a competitive
  pathway arising from undesirable chemoselectivity. b, The efficiency of the multicomponent
  process hinges on the catalyst possessing the appropriate steric and electronic
  attributes. c, Modification of the chiral NHC ligand indicates that the optimal
  Cu-based catalyst is likely a monodentate complex with an N-alkyl side chain containing
  the sole stereogenic center. d, DFT calculations point to a mode of transformation
  I leading to the major enantiomer (vs. III). The uniformly exceptional branch or
  SN2′ selectivity (vs. linear or SN2), despite the involvement of a neutral monodentate
  NHC–Cu catalyst, might be due to steric facilitation of the reductive elimination
  step (vs. π-allyl formation) via II and IV. e, Evidence for the importance of Cu–phosphate
  chelation to reaction efficiency. Abbreviation: Dipp = 2,6-(i-Pr)2C6H3, TBS = (t-Bu)Me2Si.'
