caption: 'Schematic representation of the interconnection of the signaling pathways
  involved in the training of aerobic resistance and muscular strength and the adaptations
  generated by the two training modalities: (a) aerobic-resistance sports increase
  the oxygen consumption (O2 consumption). Due to the energy demand, the pathways
  are activated for the production of ATP, increasing the mitochondrial production
  of ROS, basically H2O2, increasing OS, with the consequent decrease of available
  ATP. The increase of ADP and AMP activate the energy sensor AMPK that, together
  with SIRT1, activates the PGC-1α. These, upon interacting with other transcription
  factors, such as PPARγ, ERRα, Nrf1, and Nrf2, induce adaptations to prolonged-duration
  training through the development of mechanisms, such as the oxidation of fatty acids,
  the formation of blood vessels, and mitochondrial biogenesis. (b) Strength training
  plus other factors such as IGF-1, insulin, testosterone, and leucine stimulate the
  anabolizing pathway PI3K/Akt/mTOR. During physical work, this pathway is negatively
  regulated by AMPK through the mechanisms executed by Raptor, eEF2K, TSC2, and TIF-IA;
  on finalizing the exercise, the mechanisms are reverted, stimulating protein synthesis
  and muscular fibrogenesis. The pathway is reinforced by the post-training energy
  replacement of carbohydrates and the branched-chain amino acid, leucine, which exerts
  an effect on the activation of satellite cells and myogenesis. We find immersed,
  in the control of the pathway, Fox-O, a powerful inducer of muscular protein degradation,
  and myostatin, which negatively regulates the pathway. In counterpart, myostatin
  possesses the negative regulators p70S6K, 4E-BP1, and Mrf4 that, upon inhibiting
  it, promote the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. In both exercise modalities, the interaction
  between the redox-dependent factors, PGC-1α and Nfr2, converges, producing the different
  adaptations to the training. (c) Representation of the nuclear transcription of
  PGC-1α and the binding Ebox by USF-1 mediated by ROS. On the other hand, activation
  of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway induces the re-organization of the actin filaments,
  depolymerizing the actin and forming a complex with Nrf2, which permits its later
  translocation to the nucleus for its binding to ARE and directing the antioxidant
  response.'
