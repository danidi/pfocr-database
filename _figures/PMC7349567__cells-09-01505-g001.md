caption: 'Regulatory metabolic pathways of ferroptosis. Metabolic pathways are divided
  into enzymatic (left panel) and non-enzymatic (right panel) mechanisms as well as
  into canonical (green dots) and non-canonical (orange dots). (1) Lipid metabolism
  pathway: AA and other PUFAs derived from lipid bilayers are metabolized by ACSL4
  and LPCAT and then oxidized by LOXs to produce L-ROS. (2) FSP1-CoQ10-NADPH pathway:
  in plasma membrane, FSP1 reduces CoQ10 to ubiquinol which, in turn, blocks lipid
  peroxidation. (3) Mevalonate pathway: acetyl-CoA is converted to HMG-CoA by HMGCR.
  HMG-CoA is reduced to mevalonate which, in turn, is converted to IPP. As a result,
  a selenocysteine residue is added to catalytic center of GPX4. This event leads
  to GPX4 activation and ferroptosis inhibition. IPP also generates CoQ10, thus entering
  into the FSP1 pathway. (4) GPX4 pathway: GPX4 catalyzes the reduction of lipid peroxides
  thus preventing ferroptosis. (5) Glutaminolysis pathway: Extracellular glutamine,
  internalized through SLC1A5, is converted to glutamate by GLS. (6) Cystine deprivation-induced
  (CDI) ferroptosis pathways: amino acid antiporter system xc− (composed by SLC3A2
  and SLC7A11 subunits) mediates the exchange of extracellular cystine and intracellular
  glutamate. Cystine is converted in cysteine which, in turn, contributes to GSH production.
  Cystine deprivation triggers ferroptosis through GSH depletion. (7) Iron metabolism
  pathway: Fe3+-loaded TF is imported through TFR1. Fe3+ is converted in Fe2+ by STEAP3
  and released into cytoplasm via DMT1. Fe2+ participates in Fenton Reaction, producing
  L-ROS and causing ferroptosis. (8) Ferritinophagy: Ferritin stores iron and reduces
  Fe2+ in Fe3+, limiting the Fenton Reaction. The NCOA4 binds ferritin mediating its
  autophagic degradation in a process called ferritinophagy. This mechanism promotes
  ferroptosis. Abbreviation used: AA, arachidonic acid; PUFAs, polyunsaturated fatty
  acids; ACSL4, long-chain-fatty-acid—CoA ligase 4; LPCAT, lyso-phosphatidylcholine
