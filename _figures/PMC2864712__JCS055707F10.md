caption: PAK4 regulates adhesion and migration via multiple signalling pathways. RhoA
  is locally regulated during HGF-induced DU145 cell scattering with both activating
  (red lines) and inactivating (black lines) pathways. RhoA activation downstream
  of HGF might be the result of a direct or indirect interaction with the Met receptor
  (broken line), and is likely to be required for junctional disruption and cell contractility
  during migration. PAK4 mediates an inactivation pathway via GEF-H1. HGF-activated
  PAK4 phosphorylates GEF-H1 on serine 885; this phosphorylation inhibits exchange
  activity towards RhoA at localised areas within the cell. In parallel, active PAK4
  phosphorylates paxillin on serine 272. Reduced levels of RhoA at the cell periphery
  and increased phosphorylation of paxillin at serine 272 drive the dissolution of
  actin stress fibres and focal adhesions required for HGF-induced cell scattering.

  description: PAK4 regulates adhesion and migration via multiple signalling pathways.
    RhoA is locally regulated during HGF-induced DU145 cell scattering with both activating

    HGF-activated PAK4 phosphorylates GEF-H1 on serine 885; this phosphorylation inhibits
    exchange activity towards RhoA at localised areas within the cell. In parallel,
    active PAK4 phosphorylates paxillin on serine 272. Reduced levels of RhoA at the
