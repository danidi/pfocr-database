caption: Anesthesia-induced pathways of neuronal apoptosis.Anesthesia induces apoptosis
  by seven different pathways. (1) Mitochondrial pathway. Anesthesia induces excessive
  production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This damages mitochondria, causing
  them to release cytochrome c and activate the apoptotic pathway. (2) Endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) pathway. This involves anesthesia-induced activation of inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors, leading to excessive Ca2+ release and subsequent
  downregulation of the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic protein BCL-XL. (3) γ-Aminobutyric
  acid (GABA) pathway. The developmental transition from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing
  GABA-mediated neurotransmission is primarily mediated by an increase in the amount
  of the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) during the brain growth spurt (BGS).
  (4) Death pathway. Anesthesia activates Fas protein, which induces apoptosis. (5)
  Inflammatory pathway. Inflammation involves anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity. (6)
  Pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) pathway. ProBDNF is involved in
  synaptogenesis and can induce neuronal apoptosis via p75 neurotrophic receptors.
  Neuronal activity stimulates tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to convert plasminogen
  to the protease plasmin, which in turn cleaves proBDNF into mature BDNF (mBDNF).
  Anesthetics suppress tPA release from neurons, enhance p75 signaling, and reduce
  synapses, resulting in apoptosis. (7) Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
  pathway. Anesthesia suppresses ERK phosphorylation. Apoptosis is caused by the inhibition
  of ERK phosphorylation during the BGS.
