caption: Classical model of the basal ganglia (; ). Death of dopaminergic neurons
  in the SNc reduces inhibition of the indirect pathway via dopamine D2 receptors
  and reduces activation of the direct pathway via dopamine D1 receptors. Accordingly,
  the net effect of dopamine loss, as in Parkinson's disease, is increased inhibition
  of thalamocortical activity and impaired movement. This model predicts that basal
  activity of the STN should be increased in Parkinson's disease. GPe, External segment
  of the globus pallidus; GPi, internal segment of the globus pallidus.
