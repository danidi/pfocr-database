caption: Biosynthetic pathways leading to Arabidopsis cuticular wax components. The
  acyl reduction pathway yields primary alcohols with even carbon numbers as well
  as the corresponding wax esters. The decarbonylation pathway leads to the formation
  of alkanes, secondary alcohols, and ketones with odd carbon numbers. In the decarbonylation
  pathway, only the reactions modifying 30:0 acyl CoA are shown to illustrate the
  formation of products with prevalent chain lengths. The proposed action of MAH1
  in the decarbonylation pathway is indicated.
