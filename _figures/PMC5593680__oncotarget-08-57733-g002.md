caption: Glucose provides cancer cells with substrates not only for energy production
  but also for biosynthesis of proteins, nucleic acids and fats. Anaerobic glycolysis
  generates, (i) ribose 5-phosphate to support nucleotide biosynthesis through the
  pentose phosphate pathway and (ii) pyruvate to generate Acetyl CoA to feed the Krebs
  (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle supports the electron transport chain (ETC) to produce
  ATP from AMP and ADP. However, TCA produced citrate is also transported to the cytoplasm
  by the tricarboxylate transporter to be cleaved by ATP Citrate Lyase (ACLY) and
  generate cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA. This is a crucial common step for the initiation
  of fatty acid (FA) and cholesterol synthesis. A rate limiting step in FA synthesis
  is the generation of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA, catalyzed by Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase
  (ACC). Malonyl-CoA is further converted to palmitic acid by fatty acid synthase
  (FASN) []. On the other hand, conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA, HMG-CoA
  and finally mevalonate initiates the pathway of synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids.
  A rate limiting step of this pathway is the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate
  catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). Products of the mevalonate pathway are important
  for tumor cell growth. Cholesterol is required for structure and function of plasma
  membranes, while isoprenoids (farnesyl-PP and geranyl-PP diphosphates) mediate the
  post-translational modification of oncogenes such as Ras []. Metformin mediates
  in cells a state of mild metabolic stress through inhibition of aerobic energy production
  at the mitochondria. It blocks the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) complex I
  leading to enhancement of cellular AMP/ADP levels and stimulation of AMPK activity
  through binding to the enzyme's γ-subunit. The metabolic stress induced by metformin
  also induces LKB1 induced AMPK phosphorylation on AMPKα subunit T172 leading to
  greater activation. Through AMPK metformin blocks energy consuming biosynthetic
  pathways such as DNL. At the post-translational level, activated AMPK phosphorylates
  and inhibits both ACC and HMGR, leading to blockade of both fatty acid and cholesterol
  synthesis. Metformin blocks lipogenesis and this may be one of the key actions mediating
  its cytostatic activity.
