caption: Proposed age effects of increased ROS/RNS levels within hepatocytes following
  heat stress. Various signaling pathways can be activated by ROS/RNS increases. Activation
  of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) can cause the induction
  of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, which in turn will dramatically
  increase levels of intracellular nitric oxide (NO•). Under pathologic conditions,
  NO• can outcompete superoxide dismutase for reaction with superoxide (O2•−) and
  form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). ONOO− is remarkably stable and can cause injury to mitochondria
  by lipid and protein oxidation, DNA damage, and protein nitration. ONOO- reacts
  with protein tyrosine residues to produce 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT). The presence of
  3NT in young animals is reversible and can lead to homeostasis, whereas protein
  modifications in old animals may cause irreversible protein damage. Induction of
  autophagy by an unknown transcription factor is a second signaling pathway potentially
  activated by increased ROS/RNS following heat stress. In young organisms, the autophagic
  process most often involves efficient recycling of sequestered material, resulting
  in the cell returning to a homeostatic state. In contrast, aged organisms have a
  decrease in the efficiency of protein degradation mechanisms, causing accumulation
  of lipofuscin. ROS/RNS from degraded cellular material (e.g. mitochondria) and iron
  from both lipofuscin and degraded metallo-proteins allows Fenton chemistry to occur
  within lysosomes. This in turn produces even more ROS/RNS which can damage the lysosome
  and inhibit its function, causing an even greater accumulation of undigested lipofuscin
  and potential leakage of acid hydrolases into the cytosol and production of more
  ROS/RNS. A third pathway involved following heat stress is activation of the heat
  shock factor 1 (HSF1) transcription factor. HSF1 binds to the heat shock element
  (HSE) to induce expression of HSP70 and initiate repair or degradation of damaged/misfolded
  proteins, a pathway believed to occur optimally in younger organisms. In older organisms,
  low levels of HSP70 induction and/or function can lead to the accumulation of damaged
  proteins and formation of aggregates, which in turn produce high levels of ROS/RNS.
