caption: Nodes represent pathways and two pathways are joined by a link whenever there
  exists a SL pair containing one reaction in each pathway. Links corresponding to
  plasticity SL pairs are represented by green continuous arrows pointing from backup
  to active. Redundancy SL pairs are represented by discontinuous red lines. Labels
  correspond to the number of pairs which generate this combination of pathways, being
  thicker those links with more associated pairs. Self-loops correspond to SL pairs
  with both reactions in the same associated pathway. a. Pathways entanglement in
  E. coli. b. the same for M. pneumoniae. c. Scheme of how pathways entanglement is
  derived from RSL pairs. d. the same for PSL pairs.
