caption: Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) signaling during neurite development. LKB1 signaling
  controls the various steps of axon/dendrite development. Beginning with axon specification,
  in which cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signal activates the LKB1-SAD-A/B pathway leading
  to microtubule organization, LKB1 controls axonal growth and branching as well as
  dendrite growth, orientation and spacing. LKB1 signaling regulates the cellular
  events described in the parentheses to accomplish each step of neurite development.
  The various downstream kinases (in blue) of LKB1, such as SAD-A/B, NUAK1 and SIK1/2,
  mediate different steps of neurite development. Note that in most cases, whether
  the depicted LKB1 functions are applicable to many types of neurons has not been
  evaluated.
