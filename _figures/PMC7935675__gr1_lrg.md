caption: After activation of the S subunit protein on the COVID-19 surface by transmembrane
  protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), the virus binds to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme
  2 (ACE2) receptor and infects the host cell through endocytosis. ACE2 is also separated
  from the cell membrane by A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), and change
  to the soluble form of ACE2 that prevents the virus binding to ACE2 receptor in
  the host cell membrane and would have useful effects of defense against lung damage
  but not infection with COVID-19. Another important function of Angiotensin-converting
  enzyme (ACE) is controlling organ injury and inflammation via the renin-angiotensin
  system. Briefly, another important function of ACE is controlling organ injury and
  inflammation via the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
  transform angiotensin type I (Ang I) to angiotensin type II (Ang II), and Ang II
  intracellular signaling pathway causes inflammation as well as organ injury through
  the type 1 of Ang II receptor (ATR I) and has reverse effects through the type 2
  of Ang II receptor (ATR II). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) converts Ang
  I to Ang- [, , , , , , , , ] and Ang II to Ang- [, , , , , , ]. Ang- [, , , , ,
  , ] blocks the effects of inflammation via the Mas receptor.
