caption: 'Genes and biological processes shared in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and cancer.
  Overlapping biological processes of PD and cancer mainly include the following:
  (a) misfolding and degradation of proteins, (b) mitochondrial damage and oxidative
  stress response, (c) chronic inflammation, (d) cell cycle control and DNA repair,
  and (e) PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulation. The α-synuclein polymer attributed to
  SNCA multiplication is the main component of Lewy bodies (LBs). SNCA mutations alter
  the normal function of α-synuclein, which induces the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and
  promotes cell proliferation. Under the cascade of phosphorylating AKT, mTOR is activated
  by PINK1 and LRRK2. PARK2 and UCH-L1 mutations disrupt the degradation function
  of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), leading to the misfolding and aggregation
  of α-synuclein, cyclin E, and p53. PINK1 and DJ-1 mutations result in the overproduction
  of free radicals and oxidative stress in the mitochondria, which causes neuron defects
  and stimulates cell proliferation. COX2 and CARD15 mutations activate the NF-κB
  pathway and induce chronic inflammation, leading to a wide range of genetic mutations
  and abnormal cellular signaling. The different cellular backgrounds of cancer cells
  and neurons (mitotic vs. post-mitotic cells) bring completely distinct reactions
  to external stimuli and internal changes: some undergo cell proliferation, and others
  neuron death. The final result is two serious diseases: cancer and PD.'
