caption: 'Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE)-immunotoxin pathway. PE-based immunotoxins such
  as the mesothelin-targeting immunotoxin SS1P or LMB-100 act through a pathway involving
  (1) binding to the target antigen and internalization, (2) processing and trafficking,
  (3) inhibition of protein synthesis, and (4) induction of apoptosis. Abbreviations:
  PE: Pseudomonas exotoxin A; Fv: fragment variable; PE38: truncated PE fragment;
  EF2: elongation factor 2.'
