caption: WNTs signaling pathway regulated autophagy and EMT. The WNTs pathway consists
  of the classical pathway and nonclassical WNT pathway. The classical pathway (WNT/β-catenin
  signaling pathway) directly leads to HIF-1α activation, which in turn results in
  overexpression of SLUG, SNAIL, and TWIST and induction of EMT. The nonclassical
  WNT pathway mainly contains two WNT proteins, WNT5A and WNT11, which facilitate
  EMT by inducing p38 (Mapk14) phosphorylation. Dishevelled (Dvl) is a basic and central
  component of WNT signaling, and it plays an important role in both β-catenin–mediated
  canonical and β-catenin–independent noncanonical WNT signaling. Dvl expression and
  stability are negatively controlled by autophagy in the late stages of cancer development,
  which in turn inhibits the WNT process. On the other hand, autophagy can decrease
  the stability of TWIST1 protein and hinder EMT
