caption: 'The hypothetical mechanism of action of BoNT/A is achieved through the modulation
  of TLR2 and SNARE proteins, and minocycline occurs through the modulation of p38
  and MMP9 in glial cells. Our studies revealed that BoNT/A significantly diminishes
  LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2, and NF-κB in microglial cells in primary
  cultures. Moreover, BoNT/A treatment leads to a reduction in the release of pro-inflammatory
  factors, such as IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, and anti-inflammatory IL-10. We did not observe
  any effects of BoNT/A on primary cultures of astrocytes. Minocycline also inhibits
  LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38, ERK1/2 and NF-κB in microglial primary cultures.
  Moreover, we obtained similar effects in astrocyte cultures. The results of our
  studies are in agreement with data obtained by others, suggesting that minocycline
  diminishes both pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10)
  factors in microglia, as well as astrocytes, as a result of a direct action on p38
  and MMP9 (Piao et al., ; Niimi et al., ). The activation of p38 is correlated with
  the regulation of synthesis of interleukins, and the role of MMP9 is to transform
  an inactive form of IL-1β (pro-IL-1β) into active IL-1β (Beyaert et al., ; Kawasaki
  et al., ). As previously shown, the activation of TLR4 by LPS leads to an increased
  expression of TLR2 and induction of its activation (Lin et al., ). However, because
  of the lower expression levels of TLR4 in astrocytes, we did not observe signal
  amplification between TLR4-TLR2. In a previous study, it was suggested that TLR2
  receptors are molecular targets of BoNT/A (Kim et al., ). In primary microglial
  cell cultures, we observed a significant reduction in TLR4 expression after LPS
  stimulation. This TLR4 reduction is correlated with a receptor activation and internalization,
  and it is followed by an increased expression of TLR2. Additionally, BoNT/A, but
  not minocycline, potentiates the level of TLR2 after 24 h of LPS treatment. This
  effect was also observed by Kim et al. () in a macrophage cell line. It is well
  documented that the activation of TLRs initiates intracellular cascades activation,
  mainly NF-κB and MAPKs (Kawai and Akira, ). Moreover, in microglial cell cultures
  we observed a simultaneous increase in the levels of SNAP-23 and TLR2 after 24 h
  of LPS treatment. In 2014, Nair-Gupta et al. revealed that the TLR-MyD88-NF-κB pathway
  is involved in the phosphorylation of SNAP-23 (Nair-Gupta et al., ). The results
  of our data from primary glial cell cultures showed that BoNT/A diminishes microglial
  SNAP-23 and astrocytic SNAP-23 and -25. We also revealed that minocycline does not
  influence the levels of SNARE proteins. As it was suggested by Holm et al. (), a
  complete activation of TLR2 in astrocytes requires the presence of the microglial
  TLR4 receptor. Therefore, we hypothesized that glial crosstalk may explain the lack
  of effect of BoNT/A on astrocytes. At the same time, we suggest that the molecular
  target of BoNT/A is TLR2. Abbreviations: SNAP, synaptosomal-associated protein;
