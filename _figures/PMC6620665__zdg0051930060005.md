caption: Simplified schematic depicting homocysteine (Hcy) metabolism across stages
  of reproductive aging in women. Arrows indicate observations in the present study.
  Hcy was elevated in postmenopausal women and was associated with declines in estradiol.
  The metabolism of Hcy, a byproduct of methionine (MET) metabolism, is at the intersection
  of the transsulfuration and remethylation pathways. The activation of these pathways
  is regulated by dietary intake of methionine. The elevation of Hcy could be due
  to a functional reduced methionine synthase activity, secondary to reduced estradiol
  and/or reduced dietary intake of vitamin B12 (and possible folate), resulting in
  impaired (folate-dependent) Hcy remethylation to methionine. In the transsulfuration
  pathway, reduced cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) due to declines in estradiol and/or
  reduced dietary intake of vitamin B6 could impair Hcy metabolism to cystathionine
  and then to cysteine. Elevated cysteine, a major precursor of glutathione, could
  be a compensatory mechanism to increase glutathione in response to oxidative stress.
  Additionally, aging and/or estrogen deficiency could reduce glutathioine levels
  by reducing glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL). CYS, cysteine; GS, glutathione synthase;
  SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine.
