caption: A model of carotenogenesis under the effect of three alleles of CmOr and
  of a dysfunctional CRTISO. In the presence of both OR-His and OR-Arg, carotenoid
  pathway flux occurs at high levels (green arrows) but only OR-His prevents further
  metabolism downstream of β-carotene (red arrow), resulting in strongly increased
  β-carotene accumulation in OR-His melon fruits but not in OR-Arg. In contrast, low
  PSY protein levels, caused by a truncated OR-lowβ, results in a weak pathway flux
  (red arrow) and, hence, low carotenoid levels in OR-lowβ fruit. Dysfunctional CRTISO
  in yofi melons results in metabolic arrest downstream of prolycopene (red arrow).
  Accordingly, prolycopene is accumulated in yofi genotypes regardless of the golden
  , which operates downstream in the pathway.
