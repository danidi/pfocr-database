caption: . Metal-induced ascorbate depletion. Numerous iron-containing hydroxylases
  that are involved in collagen, carnitine, catecholamine, and tyrosine metabolism
  all require ascorbic acid (AA) to maintain iron in reduced form. In tissue culture
  media, the level of AA is 1–5 μ M, and it is dependent on the source of serum. In
  cells AA is accumulated > 10- to 50-fold compared with the media levels because
  of uptake of both DHA, via Glut 1, and AA, via sodium-dependent ascorbate transporter
  SVCT2. Once oxidized to DHA, ascorbate can be reduced inside the cell, or be released
  from cells to the media in the form of DHA. In the media, DHA can be reduced to
  AA and transported back to cells. Ni(II) and Co(II), after binding to ligands, are
  capable of catalyzing ascorbate oxidation to DHA both in the media and inside the
  cell. In the presence of metals, DHA is not stable and can be hydrolyzed to diketogulonate
  (DKG) and other products. Arrows show the preferential pathway of metabolic conversion
  of ascorbate. Both Ni(II) and Co(II) could also block ascorbate transport into cells.
  The loss of intracellular ascorbate results in accumulation of oxidized iron [increased
  ratio Fe(III):Fe(II)] in the enzymes, which causes their inactivation.
