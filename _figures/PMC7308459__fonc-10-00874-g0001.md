caption: The impact of IR on NK cell. IR has a pronounced effect on modifying NK cell
  biology both directly and indirectly. On the one hand, IR induces the secretion
  of IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforin, and granzyme B of NK cells possibly through the p38-MAPK,
  ATM, and NF-κB pathway without alteration of activating receptors. On the other
  hand, IR programs the differentiation of classical activated macrophage (M1), which
  releases immunostimulatory IL-12 or IL-18 and triggers NK cytotoxicity. DC exposed
  to LDIR produces enhanced IL-2 and IFN-γ which promote NK functions while DC exposed
  to HDIR secretes less IL-12. IR also leads to the recruitment and activation of
  pro-tumor TAN phenotype (N2), alternatively activated macrophage (M2), Treg and
  MDSC which secrete TGF-β and impair NK activity. Finally, tumor expressed ligands,
  such as NKG2DL, TRAIL-R, and FAS, are upregulated during IR, enhancing the recognition
  of malignant cells by NK cells. However, PD-L1, classical HLA class I, sNKG2DL are
  also upregulated during IR, impairing the immunogenicity of tumor cells and NK cell
  recognition. See the main text for details. IR, ionizing radiation; NK cell, natural
  killer cell; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia mutated; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa
  B; IL, interleukin; DC, dendritic cell; LDIR, low-dose ionizing radiation; HDIR,
  high-dose ionizing radiation; TAN, tumor-associated neutrophil; Treg, regulatory
  T cell; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β;
  NKG2DL, natural killer group 2 member D ligand; TRAIL-R, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand-receptor; PD-L1, programmed death ligand 1; HLA, human leukocyte antigen;
  sNKG2DL, soluble natural killer group 2 member D ligand.
