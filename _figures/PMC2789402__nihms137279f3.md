caption: Therapeutic strategies targeting the colon cancer stem cell. Depicted in
  this figure are multiple approaches to destruction of the colon cancer stem cell.
  (a) Prevent homing of the cancer stem cells. There are some proponents of the possibility
  that cells external to the local environment migrate to sites of malignancy, or
  indeed are the genesis of malignancy. This strategy would prevent cells external
  to this microenvironment from establishing residence in the local milieu. (b) Target
  the cancer stem cell signaling pathway. Pathways unique to the colon cancer stem
  cell would be targets for novel agents. Combination therapy would then facilitate
  obliteration of these rare cells. (c) Accelerate differentiation. In this modality,
  medical therapies for enhancing differentiation would promote the destruction of
  colon cancer stem cells by conventional chemotherapy. (d) Target the cancer stem
  cell niche. New strategies invoke approaches aimed at the environment that supports
  the cancer stem cell, thus preventing further proliferation and spread of the malignancy.
