caption: Obese adipose tissue expansion – resultant inflammation and metabolic dysregulation.
  Excess energy leads to adipose expansion with hypertrophic adipocytes that secrete
  chemoattractants such as MCP-1, drawing immune cells into the tissue. Secretion
  of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 by adipocytes, pre-adipocytes,
  and infiltrating immune cells results in polarization of macrophages to a pro-inflammatory
  M1 phenotype, and drive an inflammatory T cell population. Augmented lipolysis leads
  to increased levels of FFAs. This environment negatively impacts on the insulin
  signaling pathway and a state of insulin resistance results. Additionally hypertrophic
  adipocytes are also linked with hypoxia.
