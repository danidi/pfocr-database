caption: Schematic diagram of the biosynthetic pathway of Met in S. Typhimurium. The
  first committed step of the pathway is catalyzed by homoserine transsuccinylase
  (MetA), which succinylates homoserine to form O-succinyl-l-homoserine, which then
  undergoes a condensation reaction with cysteine to form l-cystathionine, catalyzed
  by cystathionine γ-synthase (MetB). Cystathionine β-lyase (MetC) catalyzes the conversion
  of l-cystathionine to l-homocysteine, pyruvate, and ammonia. The final biosynthetic
  step is catalyzed by distinct Met synthases, MetH and MetE, which are vitamin B12-dependent
  and -independent synthases, respectively (, , ). In this final step, l-homocysteine
  is condensed with 5,10-methyltetrahydrofolate (CH3H4Folate), which donates the methyl
  group. 5,10-Methyltetrahydrofolate is provided from the one-carbon cycle through
  a methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MetF)-mediated reaction, producing tetrahydrofolate
  (H4Folate) and Met (). In S. enterica, Met is recycled through an activated methyl
  cycle. The primary methyl donor, SAM, is formed by the activation of Met through
  an ATP-dependent condensation reaction catalyzed by the SAM synthase (MetK)(, ,
  ). Catalytic enzymes are shown in red; arrows indicate the direction of catalytic
  reactions.
