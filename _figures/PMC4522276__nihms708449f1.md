caption: DENV interacts with target cells via one or more host factors that enhance
  attachment. DENV subsequently is internalized by endocytosis and fuses with membranes
  of the late endosome in a pH-dependent manner. Virus binding and membrane fusion
  is orchestrated by the envelope (E) protein, which is composed of three domains
  (top center, DI, shown in red; DII, shown in yellow; and DIII, shown in blue). Viral
  RNA translation and replication occurs in association with membranes of the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER). Newly synthesized viral RNA is packaged into immature virions, which
  bud into the ER lumen. During egress, the virion undergoes a maturation step defined
  by cleavage of the prM protein by furin proteases (orange spheres). DENV infection
  is detected by host pattern recognition receptors that selectively bind viral RNA
  molecules including TLRs and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Additionally, DENV infection
  activates the DNA sensor cGAS and STING pathway via unknown mechanisms. These cell-intrinsic
  host defense systems stimulate the production of IFNs to promote expression of antiviral
  ISGs. DENV has evolved mechanisms to antagonize antiviral pathways including the
  NS2B/3-mediated cleavage of STING and NS5-mediated degradation of STAT2. (Inset)
  An increasingly detailed understanding of the structural basis of antibody recognition
  has emerged. Antibodies have been characterized that bind epitopes (in green) on
  the virion comprised of a single or multiple E proteins. For example, the DIII lateral
  ridge epitope is contained within a single E protein (top), whereas the E-dimer-dependent
  quaternary epitope is composed of residues of both E proteins in the anti-parallel
  dimer (bottom). In contrast, other mAbs bind epitopes not predicted to be accessible
  using existing models of virion structure (middle).
