caption: Fam20C phosphorylates FGF23 at Ser180 within an important regulatory motif.
  This phosphorylation event prevents O-glycosylation of FGF23 at Thr178 by GalNAc-T3,
  which results in furin-dependent proteolysis and inactivation of FGF23. Fam20C may
  also regulate FGF23 expression indirectly, via phosphorylation of the SIBLING, DMP1.
  Phosphorylated DMP1 appears to negatively regulate FGF23 expression. However, the
  mechanism by which this occurs is currently unknown.
