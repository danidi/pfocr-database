caption: Model of the calcineurin-NFAT and MEK1-ERK1/2 signaling module. While calcineurin-NFAT
  and MEK1-ERK1/2 receive input from stimuli that either mobilize intracellular calcium
  or result in Ras activation, the full effectiveness of either pathway likely requires
  simultaneous input from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs), and other ill-defined stimuli. All four proteins can form a complex in cardiomyocytes,
  likely serving as a means of coordinating regulation through at least one direct
  mechanism involving ERK-mediated phosphorylation of NFAT, which does not alter nuclear
  translocation but instead influences DNA binding activity of NFAT. Once in the nucleus
  through the sole action of calcineurin, NFAT can regulate gene expression in coordination
  with ERK signaling through direct effects on AP-1, GATA4, and other cofactors. It
  is uncertain if the entire four-protein complex can translocate to the nucleus with
  NFAT or if only ERK becomes associated with NFAT localized at specific DNA binding
  sites, permitting additional ERK-regulated events on transcription.
