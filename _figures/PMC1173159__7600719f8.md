caption: A proposed model to explain the mechanism by which the MECT1-MAML2 fusion
  protein constitutively activates the CREB pathway. (A) In a signal-dependent fashion,
  signal-mediated activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway leads to phosphorylation of CREB
  at Ser133, which allows the recruitment of p300/CBP and subsequently enhances transcriptional
  activation. (B) The MECT1-MAML2 fusion contains two functional domains, the CREB-binding
  domain from MECT1 and the TAD domain from MAML2. The CREB-binding domain enables
  the MECT1-MAML2 fusion to localize to the CREB complex on the promoters of target
  genes, and the TAD domain is responsible for subsequent strong transcription by
  interacting with p300/CBP coactivators and other factors. Thus, the fusion protein
  is able to bypass signaling requirements and activate transcription of CREB target
  genes that mediate its transforming activities.
