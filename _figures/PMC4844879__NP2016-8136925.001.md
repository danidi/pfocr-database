caption: STEP signaling pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease. The binding
  of Aβ to α7nAChRs results in activation of calcineurin (PP2B), inhibition of DARPP-32,
  and activation of PP1. PP1 dephosphorylates STEP61 at a regulatory serine within
  the substrate-binding domain (Ser221). Dephosphorylation of this serine residue
  increases the affinity of STEP for its substrates. In a parallel pathway, Aβ inhibits
  the proteasome, thereby blocking the degradation of STEP61. Both mechanisms result
  in an accumulation of active STEP61. The increase in active STEP61 results in increased
  dephosphorylation of GluN2B Tyr1472 and internalization of GluN2B-containing NMDARs.
  In addition, dephosphorylation of Fyn results in its inactivation. Thus, active
  STEP61 directly dephosphorylates GluN2B and at the same time inactivates the kinase
  that phosphorylates STEP61 at Tyr1472.
