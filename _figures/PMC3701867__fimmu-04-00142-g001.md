caption: Scheme depicting the interactive roles of interferon, Trim, and Socs molecules
  regulating the innate response in SjS-susceptible C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice. (A)
  The IFN-signature observed during the early pre-clinical phase of SjS in the exocrine
  glands of C57BL/6.NOD-Aec1Aec2 mice strongly suggests an autonomous cell response
  against a virus. Multiple IFN-responsive genes known to interfere or regulated viral
  replication at each step are up-regulated (shown in red). Whether this viral infection
  is capable of circumventing the innate response remains a viable question, as many
  viruses are able to regulate the innate response to their advantage, including interactions
  with Socs1 and Socs3. (B) A slowly progressing chronic infection would lead to autonomous
  cell responses by both membrane-associated and cytoplasmic pattern-recognition receptors
  (PRRs), in this case, TLR3, TLR4, and MDA-5, each initiating cellular responses
  via the TRIF signal transduction pathway. At the same time, signal transductions
  following activation of the Ifnα/β receptor involves the Jak/Tyk-Stat1/Stat2 pathway.
  Irf9 acts as a transcription factor that is involved in the activation of Trim molecules,
  many of which are E3-like ubiquitinating molecules known to interact at multiple
  points of viral infections, thus functioning as anti-microbial factors. Two major
  regulators of the INFαβ signaling pathway and the IFN-signature are Socs1, molecules
  that interfere with the activation loop of Jak kinase, and Trim8 that thereby preventing
  phosphorylation of Stat molecules. Trim8 functions as an inhibitor of Socs1, promoting
  continuation of IFN-signaling. Similarly, Trim21 stabilizes the function of Irf3
  through blocking its interaction with Pin1, thereby promoting IFN-signaling. Genes
  encoding molecules that function to inhibit the innate response (Socs1, Trim27,
  Trim30, and Trim40) are shown to be down-regulated (green), while genes encoding
  factors that function to generally activate innate responses are shown to be up-regulated
  (red). Failure to either eliminate the etiological agent or overcome its ability
  to regulate the host’s innate response, most likely establishes the environment
  for activation of the adaptive response associated with overt clinical disease.
  This scheme is consistent with the strong IFN-signature observed in SjS and other
  rheumatic diseases, such as SLE.
