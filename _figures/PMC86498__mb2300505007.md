caption: Model of the putative functional organization of Ras and Rap1 by the TCR-CD4-CD45
  interacting complex. Low-molecular-weight isoforms of CD45 (RO) efficiently interact
  with the TCR, thereby increasing the amplitude of the TCR effector signals. Under
  these conditions, stimulation of the TCR-CD4 complex with the high-affinity ligand
  (e.g., MAb 3D3) delivers a strong signal which involves Rap1 primarily in the negative
  regulation of Ras effector functions. In contrast, stimulation of the TCR with intermediate-to-low-affinity
  ligands (e.g., MAb 5A) fails to recruit CD4 and, in the presence of the high-molecular-weight
  isoform of CD45 (ABC), generates a signal that is below the threshold required for
  the negative regulation of Ras by Rap1 yet is sufficient to positively engage Rap1
  toward the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway.
