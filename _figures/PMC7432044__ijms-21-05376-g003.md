caption: Endocytosis of transporter versus apical cargoes in A. nidulans. Model highlighting
  the endocytic process of transporters and apical membrane cargoes in a growing hyphal
  tip of A. nidulans. After reaching the PM, apical cargoes diffuse laterally to the
  actin-enriched collar region where they undergo AP-2-dependent, but clathrin-independent,
  endocytosis with the involvement of several endocytosis-related proteins (SagA,
  SlaB). Endocytic vesicles fuse to sorting endosomes (SEs) and from there undergo
  retrograde traffic to late-Golgi cisternae and then travel via AP-1/clathrin-coated
  vesicles to the SPK and finally to the PM. This model does not exclude (not shown)
  that a fraction of apical cargoes could be sorted directly to vacuoles to undergo
  degradation. The ongoing recycling process of apical cargoes ensures constant polarity
  maintenance and polar cell tip growth. Transporters, which are not polarly localized
  at the PM, are not cargoes of the AP-2 pathway, but instead follow α-arrestin- and
  clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Specifically, as a response to physiological or
  stress signals, transporters are recognized and ubiquitinated by HulA ubiquitin
  ligase, assisted by α-arrestin adaptors (ArtA). Internalization takes place by a
  clathrin-dependent, but AP-2 independent, pathway with the recruitment of several
  endocytosis-related proteins (e.g., SagA, SlaB), followed by sorting into early
  endosomes (EEs) and eventually degradation to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) [].
