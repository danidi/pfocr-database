number: Figure 1
caption: This figure depicts the major pathways for glucose consumption in S. cereviseae.
  In the presence of pyruvate (derived from the glycolysis), the favoured pathway
  (blue arrows) is the fermentation and production of ethanol. The synthesis of acetyl‐coA
  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) are inhibited by catabolic repression due
  to the Crabtree effect. Eventually, and depending on the fermentation conditions
  and the available reducing power, products such as acetaldehyde, acetate and the
  derived product acetoin are accumulated at different proportions, influencing the
  final wine quality. On the other hand, glycerol is an osmotic protector. Gpd1p/Gpd2p
  use glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate derived from glycolysis, and its production is regulated
  according to cell demands.
