caption: The key steps of the canonical Hippo pathway are displayed which regulate
  growth and proliferation as well as cell differentiation. Activated MST1/2 stimulate
  LATS1/2, which phosphorylate and inactivate the transcription factor Yes-associated
  protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), restricting
  their localization to the cytoplasm. Activated YAP and TAZ move to the nucleus and
  induce the expression of various genes controlling cell growth and proliferation
  [, ].
