caption: 'mTOR in sensing autophagy signals : mTOR inhibition integrates amino acid
  starvation, growth factor deprivation, decreased ATP or oxygen levels, enhanced
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) to activate autophagy. Amino acid deprivation leads
  to mTOR dissociation with lysosomes. An association of AMPK with the late endosomes
  in response to glucose starvation also leads to dissociation and inactivation of
  mTOR. ATP depletion activates AMPK which can activate TSC1/2 and thereby inhibits
  mTOR, or activates ULK1 to activate autophagy. In addition, mitochondrial generated
  ROS may also induce autophagy via an AMPK mediated pathway. Growth factor deprivation
  leads to activation of TSC1/2, inactivation of Rheb, and inactivation of mTOR. Peroxisomal
  TSC1/2 localizes to peroxisomes through binding to PEX19 and PEX5, and can be activated
  by peroxisomal ROS to inhibit mTOR activities and induce autophagy. Oxygen deprivation
  may activate autophagy by HIF1α-mediated transcription activation of BNIP3 which
  inhibits Rheb. mTOR inhibition activates autophagy by activation of ULK1, VPS34
  and TFEB, a master transcription activator of genes encoding autophagy and lysosomal
  proteins. Conformational inhibitors of mTOR such as rapamycin and catalytic inhibitors
  such as Torin1 have been shown to induce autophagy.'
