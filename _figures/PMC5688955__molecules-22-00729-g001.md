caption: Diagram showing the various effects as well as the different pathways activated
  by ouabain in ADPKD cells. Ouabain induced and NKA mediated signaling controls ADPKD
  cell proliferation via the Src-MEK-ERK pathway and cell death via stimulating the
  intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This effect of ouabain creates a disbalance that favors
  cell growth, one of the hallmarks of ADPKD cystogenesis. In addition, ouabain stimulates
  the cAMP dependent secretion of Cl− in the cells by activating the CFTR. This, along
  with a small reduction in NKA function that lessens Na+ reabsorption at the basolateral
  membrane of the cells, favors epithelial secretion over reabsorption, which helps
  maintain cyst growth. Also, ouabain induces cell de-differentiation and changes
  in the expression of adhesion proteins in ADPKD cells, via intracellular pathways
  that are not yet well characterized. O, ouabain, (α and β) subunits of the Na-K-ATPase.
