caption: TLR recognizes extracellular PAMPs and initiates the transcription of NLRP3,
  proIL-1β, and proIL-18 through the NF-κB signaling pathway, and oligomerized NLRP3,
  ASC and pro-caspase-1 form a multiprotein complex that activates caspase-1. Activated
  caspase-1 cleaves the pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, forming active IL-1β and IL18, which
  are released, and simultaneously, the active cleavage fragment of GSDMD causes cell
  perforation by inserting into the lipid bilayer, resulting in cell swelling and
  lysis, followed by the release of contents such as the cellular matrix and cytokines.
  Intracellular signaling mechanism of cell pyroptosis induced by PAMPs.
