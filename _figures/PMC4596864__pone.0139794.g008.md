caption: 'Transcription factors such as DREBs or AREBs might regulate the transcription
  of NAC genes by binding to stress-related cis-acting elements in the upstream promoter.
  The NTLs are released from RIP and RUP in response to ER stress. During RIP, activated
  NTLs are released from membrane by specific membrane-integrated proteases, such
  as calpain. During RUP, the NTLs are ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26S proteasome
  to maintain the protein stability. DREB, dehydration responsive element binding
  protein; AREB, ABA-responsive element binding protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  RIP, regulated intramembrane proteolysis; RUP, regulated ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent
  processing; NTL, NAC membrane-bound TF; KRP, KIP-related protein; H4: histone H4;
  FT, FLOWERING LOCUS T; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
