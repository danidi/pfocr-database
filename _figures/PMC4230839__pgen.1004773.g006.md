caption: Metabolic enzymes are shown as NCBI numbers and are proposed based on mRNA
  expression. Rhamnose transport and assimilation is based on pathway from . Abbreviations
  are D-galacturonic acid (GA), L-rhamnose (R), D-mannose (M), D-glucose (Gc), D-galactose
  (G), D-xylose (X), L-arabinose (A), fructose (F), phosphate (P), pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP), dihydroxyacetone-phosphate (DHAP), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).
  For each substrate, the number of significantly up-regulated extracellular solute
  binding proteins (ESB) and ABC transporters (ABC) are shown. Shaded regions show
  metabolism of glucose (green), mannose (blue), xylose and arabinose (yellow), rhamnose
  (orange), and galacturonic acid (red).
