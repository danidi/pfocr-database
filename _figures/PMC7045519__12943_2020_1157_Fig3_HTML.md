caption: The epigenetic regulators in ferroptosis. The BAP1-mediated pathway independent
  of TP53 executes the suppression of SLC7A11. LSH expression is up-regulated by c-Myc,
  which is enriched at the LSH promoter by the EGLN1-mediated repression of HIF-1α.
  The induced LSH interacts with WDR76, which, in turn, up-regulates the lipid metabolic
  genes including SCD1 and FADS2. LSH also induces ELAVL1 expression through the inactivation
  of p53 and ELAVL1, enhancing LINC00336 levels. LINC00336 serves as an endogenous
  sponge of MIR6852 as a circulating extracellular DNA (ceRNA), which increases the
  mRNA levels of CBS, inhibiting ferroptosis in lung cancer. P53RRA promotes ferroptosis
  by retaining p53 in the nucleus
