caption: 'Autophagy pathway: Molecular features. Several proteins in the cytoplasm
  interact to regulate autophagy. The different steps of the process are modulated
  by MAPKs (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases), such as ERK (Extracellular Signal-Related
  Kinase) 1/2 and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal Kinase), which mainly act on the key negative
  regulator of autophagy mTOR (mammalian Target OF Rapamycin). mTOR is also controlled
  directly by PI3K/AKT (PhosphatidylInositol 3-Kinase/Protein Kinase B) and p53/AMPK
  (AMP-Activated Protein Kinase) signaling pathways. Moreover, DAPK (Death-Associated
  Protein Kinase) is implicated in the autophagic cascade, which starts with the formation
  of ULK (Unc-51-Like Kinase) complex, which is composed of FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase)-family
  Interacting Protein of 200 kDa (FIP200), ULK and ATG13. In turn, ULK complex phosphorylates
  AMBRA1 (Activating Molecule in Beclin-1-Regulated Autophagy), leading to the activation
  of a complex that includes P-AMBRA1, Beclin-1, VPS (Vacuolar Protein Sorting) 15
  and 34. The final steps are characterized by the assembly of ATG complexes made
  by ATG factors and autophagosome proteins. PE: Phosphatidyl Ethanolamine; LC3II:
  lipidated form of Microtubule-Associated Protein Light Chain 3.'
