caption: TRPM channels in insulin secretion. On the left is the consensus triggering
  pathway for insulin secretion in which a glucose-stimulated rise in the ATP/ADP
  ratio closes ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, depolarizing the β-cell and activating
  voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) and Ca2+ (CaV) channels. The latter mediates Ca2+ influx
  that triggers insulin granule exocytosis. On the right are TRPM channels shown to
  contribute to β-cell Ca2+ and insulin responses. TRPM4 and (perhaps to a greater
  degree) TRPM5 mediate an inward Na+ current in response to increases in intracellular
  Ca2+, perhaps through depletion of Ca2+ stores, contributing to membrane depolarization
  and control of Ca2+ oscillations. TRPM3 activation by external steroidal signals
  allows influx of Ca2+. TRPM2 is activated by internal signals that include PKA phosphorylation,
  cADPR, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Uchida et al. demonstrate a role for TRPM2
  in glucose and GLP-1 stimulated Ca2+ responses and insulin secretion. Also intimated
  in their data is a role for TRPM2 as a regulator of the “amplifying” effects of
  glucose independent from the channel's role in mediating Ca2+ influx. Putative interactions
  are shown as red dashed arrows. Mito., mitochondria.
