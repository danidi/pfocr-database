caption: A general model for the relationship between JNK signaling pathway and the
  others, in the obesity-driven insulin resistance. JNK plays a critical role in obesity-induced
  pro-inflammatory state, leading to enhanced production of pro-inflammatory factors
  such as IL-1β, TNFα and IL-6. These factors are likely to induce impaired glucose
  metabolism and insulin resistance in a number of ways (see text for details). For
  example, JNK inhibits insulin signaling pathway and increases the production of
  inflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory factors regulate PPARγ to control the expression
  of adiponectin and pro-inflammatory state. NF-κB signaling pathway can be affected
  by JNK to regulate the expression of inflammation cytokines. PTP1B activated by
  inflammation cytokines may block the insulin signaling pathway and activate JNK
  signaling pathway to aggravate insulin resistance.
