caption: Activation of the MET receptor by its ligand triggers tyrosines within the
  multifunctional docking site to become phosphorylated and recruit signaling effectors,
  including the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2). The
  MET pathway is modulated by cell surface molecules, including the HER family (HER1,
  HER2 and HER3) and IGF1R.MET can activate the effector molecule phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K), and signals through the AKT/protein kinase B axis, which activates
  the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) axis stimulating cell growth and protein
  synthesis. Moreover, the activation of either PI3K-AKT can activate NF-κB, which
  then can be released and stimulate gene transcription after being translocated to
  the nucleus.MET activation can result in the down-stream activation of the RAS-MAPK
  pathway. The nucleotide exchanger protein Son of Sevenless (SOS) activates the rat
  sarcoma viral oncogene homolog RAS by binding with the GRB2 (GRB2-SOS complex).
  This complex can activate the v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (RAF)
  kinases, which successively activate MAPK effector kinase (MEK), and finally results
  in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).Activation of MET
  cytoplasmic signalling cascades can additionally alter cell invasiveness, motility,
  and cytoskeleton, mediated through the RAS-related protein 1 (RAP1), the focal adhesion
  complex (FAC) as well as integrin connections. MET can additionally activate the
  downstream axis of the Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
  pathway. STAT3 can be activated through phosphorylation after binding directly to
  MET resulting in dimerization and translocation to the nucleus and consequently
  mediating cell proliferation, transformation, as well as tumorigenesis and invasion.
