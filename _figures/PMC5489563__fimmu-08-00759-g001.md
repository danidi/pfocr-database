caption: Action of thioester-containing proteins (TEPs) in mammals and mosquitoes.
  (A) Pattern recognition receptors identify the presence of pathogens. In the classical
  pathway, C1 complex (specifically C1q) recognizes pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns or danger-associated molecular patterns either through binding to them
  directly or through binding of antibodies to the foreign antigen. This activates
  C1r that subsequently leads to C1s activation. Similarly, in the lectin pathway,
  binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) activates MBL-associated serine protease
  (MASP-1) and MASP-2. Activation of C1 and/or MBL–MASP complex leads to the cleavage
  of C4 and C2 molecules into C4a, C4b, C2a, and C2b, subsequently forming C3 convertase
  (C4b2a) that binds to the microbial surface. The newly formed C3 convertases cleave
  C3 into C3b that also binds to the microbial surface. Bound C3b recruits Factor
  D that activates Factor B, which results in the formation of C3bBb (C3 convertase
  of alternative pathway). C3bBb cleaves more C3 and initiates an amplification loop.
  Additionally, a fluid-phase convertase could also be formed when water associates
  with C3, forming C3(H2O). The latter reacts with activated Factor B and thus maintains
  a low level of complement activation known as tick-over mechanism. The C3 convertases
  generated from each pathway bind to C3b forming C5 convertase, which cleaves C5
  into C5a and C5b. The latter initiates the formation of membrane attacking membrane
  by recruiting C6, C7, C8, and C9 complement proteins. Certain molecules such as
  C4-binding protein, Factor H, vitronectin, and clusterin act as regulators of complement
  proteins. (B) TEP1 is constitutively activated in the hemolymph by one or more unknown
  proteases. The proteolytic cleavage produces two fragments TEP1-N and TEP1-C that
  remain associated with each other. Two leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) proteins, LRIM1
  and APL1, maintain the mature form of TEP1. Upon recognition of the parasite, TEP1
  dissociates from the LRR proteins by yet an unknown mechanism and binds to the parasite,
  which ultimately leads to its destruction. Arrows represent inhibition (red), proteolytic
  cleavage (green), and conversion or translocation of a molecule (black).
