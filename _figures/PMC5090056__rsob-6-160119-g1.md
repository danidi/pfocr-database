caption: Models of Hippo pathway in fly and mammals. A simplified version of Hippo
  pathway regulation is shown here. In both Drosophila and mammals, when Yki/YAP/TAZ
  is relieved from inhibition through phosphorylation-dependent or independent mechanisms,
  its nuclear translocation then drives target gene expression in regulation of cellular
  proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. The phosphorylation mechanism relies
  on the core kinase cascade including Hpo/MST, Wts/LATS, Sav/SAV1 and Mats/MOB1.
  In Drosophila, the FERM domain protein Ex has been shown to physically associate
  with Yki and block its nuclear translocation. Similarly, in mammals, the adherens
  protein AMOT and CRB3 complex inhibit target gene expression via sequestering YAP/TAZ
  in cytoplasm.
