caption: 'Arrows represent potential carbon fluxes. Enzymes are in bold italics. Blue
  arrows represent reducing power (NADPH) and red arrows represent acetyl-CoA. Black
  boxes denote pathway names. A recently proposed C4-like carbon-concentrating mechanism
  (CCM) in microalgae is shown to depict an alternative route for carbon assimilation.

  formed by combining FAs and glycerol. Legend: ACCase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACD,
  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; ACL, ATP-citrate lyase; ACS, acyl-CoA synthetase; AGPP,
