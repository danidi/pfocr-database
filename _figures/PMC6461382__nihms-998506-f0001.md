caption: p53 integrates multiple stress signals to induce a G1 arrest and inhibit
  mTORC1. Mitogenic signals induce a pro-growth pathway that enables G1 arrested cells
  to become senescent and exhibit a SASP. Cellular senescence prevents the cell from
  developing a cancer, but the SASP can alter the tissue microenvironment to fuel
  the development of cancer from non-senescent cells, promote tissue degeneration
  and reduce longevity.
