caption: Nrf2 activation by misfolded proteins. The left panel illustrates the pathway
  by which Nrf2 is ubiquitinated and degraded under normal, unstressed conditions.
  Redox-sensitive Keap1 promotes the association with E3-ubiquitin ligase proteins
  that modify Nrf2 leading to its subsequent degradation. Under stressed conditions,
  such as in the cardiac and skeletal myopathies that are associated with protein
  aggregation phenotypes, Nrf2 is activated by a variety of means to promote reductive
  stress. Protein aggregation complexes include the mutant protein, heat shock proteins,
  and other cellular proteins. In the case of the mutant αΒ-crystallin, excess oxidants
  were proposed to activate Nrf2 by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) that
  cause oxidative modifications (−Sx) to the regulatory cysteine residues on Keap1,
  promoting Nrf2 release. In the case of the mutant lamin proteins, activation of
  Nrf2 was proposed to involve the association of p62 with Keap1 to release Nrf2.
  Reductive stress is characterized by the increased expression of antioxidant genes
  involved in glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and reduction, as well as an upregulation
  of enzymes such as G6PD, an enzyme involved in NADPH production, leading to increased
  GSH and NADPH. An environment with increased reducing equivalents may further increase
  protein aggregation by interfering with normal protein folding. These conditions
  can further promote ER stress, a condition that will activate Nrf2 by PERK-mediated
  phosphorylation of Nrf2. Although PERK activation of Nrf2 has not been examined
  in the protein aggregation disorders discussed above, ER stress proteins were elevated
  in these models. Notably, reductive stress or even ER stress can augment ROS production
  to perpetuate Nrf2 signaling.
