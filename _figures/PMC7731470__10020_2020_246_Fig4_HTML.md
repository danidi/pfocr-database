caption: Illustration of the effects of polycystins dysfunctioning on EGFR and MAPK/ERK
  pathway. "Epidermal growth factor" (EGF) and "Insulin-like growth factor-1" (IGF-1)
  act as ligands for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). When gets activated
  by these ligands, dimerization of receptor is induced that leads to the activation
  of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor which further leads to the phosphorylation
  of tyrosine residues on each other (autophosphorylation) to form phosphotyrosine
  (shown by letter, 't'). The “growth factor receptor-bound protein-2” (GRB2) is an
  adaptor protein that helps to transduce the signals from EGFR to "Rouss avian sarcoma"
  (RAS) protein. GRB2 binds to phosphotyrosine and SOS protein via its SH2 and SH3
  domains, respectively. The GRB2/SOS complex now activates the RAS. RAS in turn activates
  the RAF (protein kinase activity of RAF gets activated) that phosphorylates the
  mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). MEK phosphorylates the extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK); also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  which further phosphorylates several other proteins that regulate cell proliferation,
  and differentiation. Decreased polycystin-1 expression lowers the activation threshold
  of the MAPK/ ERK pathway by IGF-1 and increased EGF-induced inward currents in kidney
  epithelial cell lines are produced due to over-expression of polycystin-2; together
  lead cystogenesis (Ma et al. ; Parker et al. )
