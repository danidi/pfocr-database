caption: As with many fish species, zebrafish have multiple copies of the key proteins,
  AHR and ARNT that mediate TCDD toxicity. Studies in zebrafish larvae have shown
  that AHR2 and ARNT1 dimers mediate gene transcription, following activation of AHR2
  by TCDD, to cause developmental toxicity (see text for references).
