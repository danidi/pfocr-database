caption: Microbial infection induced expression of IL-32 results in gastric inflammation.
  Microbial infection (H. pylori) leads to the upregulation of cagPAI cluster of genes
  which through the activation of NF-κB pathway results in the synthesis of IL-32
  and some other potent inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-α) that results
  in gastric inflammation. The resulting inflammation self-augments the activation
  of NF-κB pathway which further aggravates the situation.
