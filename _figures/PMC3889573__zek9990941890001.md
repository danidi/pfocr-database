caption: 'The HOG signaling pathway in C. neoformans. The HOG pathway, mainly consisting
  of a phosphorelay system (Tco-Ypd1-Ssk1 cascade) and the Ssk2-Pbs2-Hog1 MAPK module,
  not only senses almost all types of environmental stresses, it regulates virulence
  factor production (melanin and capsule) and controls ergosterol biosynthesis by
  regulating ERG gene expression. Although not shown in this figure, the HOG pathway
  is involved in the response against genotoxic agents, toxic heavy metal and metabolites,
  and high temperature. To regulate osmotic stress response, a second upstream signaling
  branch of the Ssk2-Pbs2-Hog1 pathway may exist. Although cross talk exists among
  HOG, Cpk1, and cAMP/PKA pathways, their detailed mechanism is unknown. Please refer
  to the text for more details on the regulatory mechanism of the HOG pathway. Black
  arrows indicate positive regulation or activation, whereas red lines ending in circles
  indicate negative regulation or repression. Broken arrows or lines indicate potential
  but unclear regulation. Abbreviations: AMB, amphotericin B, which binds membrane
  ergosterol and disrupts membrane integrity. PTP, protein tyrosine phosphatases;
  PP2C, protein phosphatase type 2C.'
