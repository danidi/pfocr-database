caption: The interplay between drugs of abuse and clock genes. The expression of clock
  genes modulates the state of several neurochemical systems in the mesolimbic pathway
  and other brain areas, thereby facilitating or reducing the effects of drugs of
  abuse or antidepressants. However, these and other psychoactive drugs also influence
  the activity of clock genes. Once the activity of clock genes is altered, certain
  neurochemical pathways are affected, as are the physiological and behavioural functions
  driven by these pathways. Drugs of abuse induce neuroadaptations and thereby alter
  these biological outputs both directly and indirectly through their action on clock
  genes (blue).
