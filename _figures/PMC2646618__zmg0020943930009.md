caption: Schematic overview of RXR-RAR biology in human HSCs. In the presence of a
  canonical agonist (ATRA), coactivators are recruited to the RAR-RXR heterodimer,
  resulting in transcriptional activation. Conversely, RAR antagonists such as Ro41-5253
  recruit corepressors to the RAR-RXR complex, suppressing transcription. RXR-RAR
  inverse agonists such as LG1506 more potently promote the recruitment of corepressors
  to RXR-RAR, resulting in a super-repressed state of transcription.
