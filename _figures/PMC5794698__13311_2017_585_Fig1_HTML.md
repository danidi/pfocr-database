caption: Major communication pathways of the microbiota–gut–brain axis. There are
  numerous mechanisms through which the gut microbiota may signal the brain to control
  physiological processes. These include the release of gut peptides by enteroendocrine
  cells (EECs) where they activate cognate receptors of the immune system and on vagus
  terminals in the gut. Gut peptides such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) can also be released
  by cytokines under immune stimulation. There have been numerous reports of alterations
  in the gut microbiota in neuropsychiatric conditions, where gut peptides may play
  a key signaling role. Only a few examples of gut–brain pathway and gut peptides
  are represented in this figureCCK = cholecystokinin; GLP-1 = glucagon-like peptide;
  CRF = corticotropin-releasing factor; PYY = peptide YY; GABA = γ-aminobutyric acid;
  SCFA = short-chain fatty acid
