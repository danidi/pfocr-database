caption: 'a: Simplified rationale for performing studies in NHP sepsis models of antibody
  inhibition of TNF-α and IL-6. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or E. coli are shown binding
  to a TLR4 surface receptor of a monocyte which initiates downstream signal transduction
  (yellow lightning bolt) and transcriptional upregulation of TNF-α. TNF-α further
  activates other pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. Both cytokines
  promote hypercoagulability by upregulating tissue factor (TF) expression. TNF-α
  also simultaneously promotes and inhibits fibrinolysis via activation of tPA and
  PAI-1/2, respectively (see Figure 1b).b: Multiple therapeutics are shown inhibiting
  different components of the extrinsic coagulation pathway. These drugs were tested
  using LPS or E. coli NHP sepsis models.Abbreviations: Ab, antibody; APC, activated
  protein C; F3, factor 3; iFVIIa, site inactivated factor VIIa; IL6, interleukin
  6; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PAI-1/2, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1/2; rhATIII,
  recombinant human antithrombin III; SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome;
  TF, tissue factor; TLR4, toll-like receptor 4; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.'
