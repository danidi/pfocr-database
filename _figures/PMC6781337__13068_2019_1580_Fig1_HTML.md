caption: Biosynthesis pathway for limonene production in plants and the yeast Y. lipolytica.
  Limonene is biosynthesized from the precursor GPP by enzymatic biotransformation
  with d- or l-limonene synthetase. IPP and DMAPP are converted to GPP in both plant
  and Y. lipolytica. a Biosynthesis pathway for limonene production in plants. Plants
  produce GPP via the methylerythritol phosphate pathway from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
  b Biosynthesis pathway for limonene production in Y. lipolytica. Yeast rely on the
  mevalonate pathway to produce GPP from acetyl-CoA. Since LS is not present in Y.
  lipolytica to construct a complete limonene pathway in Y. lipolytica, two heterologous
  genes encoding d-limonene synthase (dLS, from C. limon) and l-limonene synthase

  pathways of limonene may lie in yeast (shown in blue). The endogenous MVA pathway
