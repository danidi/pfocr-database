caption: A simplified diagram of putative signaling pathways accountable for the differential
  responses of tumor cells to a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition and ionizing radiation (IR)
  used in two different drug-irradiation schedules. Incubation of tumor cells with
  NVP-BEZ235 for 24 hours before IR (A) leads to an activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway at the time of irradiation, most likely due to the inhibition of the negative
  feedback loop mediated by ribosomal protein S6 ( and ). Subsequently, the activated
  pro-survival kinase AKT prevents radiation-induced apoptosis. In contrast, under
  schedule II, AKT and mTOR are suppressed at the time of irradiation (B). Furthermore,
  incubation with NVP-BEZ235 for 24 hours causes an arrest in the G1 phase ( and –).
  Due to the higher portion of G1 phase cells, exposure to IR leads to a diminished
  induction of γH2AX in cells treated for 24 hours before IR, compared to controls
  and schedule II ( and , A–C). Cells treated according schedule I show a reduced
  Rad51 level during IR. After drug removal, Rad51 returned to the normal level (),
  thus leading to full repair of DNA damage ( and , A–C). In contrast, under schedule
  II the expression of Rad51 remained diminished 24 and 48 hours after IR (). This
  might have increased the fraction of cells with hypodiploid DNA content and protracted
  DNA damage repair (, , and ). Besides this, cells treated according to schedule
  II showed a strong G2/M arrest after combined drug-IR treatment ( and ). To summarize,
  schedule I caused a cytostatic effect, whereas schedule II gave rise to a strong
  radiosensitization (take note of the size of the letters/symbols and the thickness
  of the lines).
