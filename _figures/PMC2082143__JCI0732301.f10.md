caption: tPA binds to membrane receptor LRP-1, induces its tyrosine phosphorylation,
  which leads to the increased recruitment of β1 integrin and activates downstream
  ILK. Blockade of each and every step within this signaling circuit by multiple strategies
  (numbers 1–5) abolishes the fibrogenic effect of tPA on myofibroblast activation,
  whereas over-expression of ILK mimics tPA and promotes the TGF-β1–mediated myofibroblast
  activation (number 6).
