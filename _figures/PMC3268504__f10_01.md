caption: The pathway of sinapate ester biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (). Multiple steps
  are required for the conversion of Phe to sinapic acid via p-coumaroyl-CoA. The
  enzymes required for the synthesis of sinapate esters in developing seeds are SGT
  and SCT. Upon germination, sinapoylcholinesterase (SCE) catalyzes the hydrolysis
  of seed reserves of sinapoylcholine, and SGT and SMT convert the released sinapate
  into sinapoylmalate. SST catalyzes the conversion of two molecules of sinapoylglucose
  to 1,2-disinapoylglucose and compound 1 (a disinapoylated monosaccharide), a biosynthetic
  route that is predominant in etiolated seedlings. Dashed arrows indicate one possible
  route to the biosynthesis of compound 1, a reaction dependent upon SST. The action
  of SAT is required for the sinapoylation of Arabidopsis anthocyanins. Double arrows
  proceeding from p-coumaroyl-CoA indicate the biosynthesis of the cyanidin derivative
  via flavonoid metabolism and the subsequent acylation of the anthocyanin by a p-coumaroyl-
  CoA-dependent BAHD acyltransferase (; ; ). This biosynthetic pathway yields one
  possible substrate for SAT, 3-O-(6-O-p-coumaroyl-2-O-β-D-xylopyranosyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-5-O-(6-O-malonyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)
  cyanidin (A5; nomenclature from ), sinapoylation of which would result in the production
  of 3-O-[6-O-(4-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-p-coumaroyl)-2-O-(2-O-sinapoyl-β-D-xylopyranosyl)β-D-glucopyranosyl]-5-O-(6-O-malonyl-β-D-glucopyranosyl)
  cyanidin (A11).
