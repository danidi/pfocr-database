number: Figure 1
caption: (A) Cytosolic microbe-associated molecular patterns and danger signals are
  detected and integrated by an array of inflammasome components converging at the
  activation of caspase-1 , –. In addition to the already known stimuli for inflammasome
  activation (left, red), a pathway involving S. Typhimurium SopE and Rho GTPases
  (right, blue) has been described recently . (B) Comparison of the virulence mechanisms
  of Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and Citrobacter/EPEC. The effector proteins injected
  can act both directly on the actin polymerization as well as via the activation
  of Rho GTPases –. (C) Comparison of pathologies in different animal models of Salmonella,
  Shigella, and Citrobacter/EPEC infection. The region of the strongest pathology
  and the most important pathological changes in each model is indicated in red. Representative
  images for the macroscopic and histological changes in the respective animal models
  can be found in references –.
