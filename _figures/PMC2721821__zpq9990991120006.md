caption: Graphical representation of the Hh signaling pathway in its activated state
  and possible sites of HPI action. HPI-1 inhibits both endogenous (solid arrows)
  and exogenous (dashed arrow) Gli1/Gli2 activity, suggesting that it acts independently
  of the primary cilium. HPI-2 and HPI-3 appear to block the conversion of full-length
  Gli2 proteins into transcriptional activators, and HPI-4 disrupts ciliogenesis and
  therefore ciliary processes required for Gli function.
