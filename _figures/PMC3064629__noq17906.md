caption: miR-34a, MAGE-A genes, and p53 form a positive feedback loop modulating chemosensitivity
  in cancer cells. Diagram depicting the proposed novel positive feedback pathway
  modulating chemosensitivity in medulloblastoma cells. miR-34a–mediated direct targeting
  of the MAGE-A genes results in an increase in p53, which in turn acts as a transcriptional
  activator for miR-34a.
