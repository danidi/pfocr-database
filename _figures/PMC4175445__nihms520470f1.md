caption: Generation of the prostanoids through metabolism of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic
  acid can be metabolized into different bioactive lipids by one of three distinct
  signaling pathways; the cyclooxygenase (COX), the lipoxygenase, and the P-450 epoxygenase
  pathways. The COX-isoforms-COX-1 and COX-2 are responsible for the conversion of
  AA to PGH2, the first step in the generation of TXA2. Thromboxane synthase (TXA2S)
  then catalyzes the conversion of the COX product, PGH2 to TXA2
