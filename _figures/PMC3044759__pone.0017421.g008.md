caption: CR-induced SIRT1 activation in human lung fibroblasts can suppress the p16/Rb
  pathway through its direct deacetylation effects (epigenetic mechanisms) and indirectly
  provoking Akt/p70S6K1 signaling (genetic mechanisms). CR can also directly affect
  epigenetic remodeling in the p16 promoter which contributes to p16 repression. As
  a result, p16 repression leads to aging delay and cellular lifespan extension.
