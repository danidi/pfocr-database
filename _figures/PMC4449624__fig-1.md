caption: FFA and carbohydrate metabolisms in the cardiomyocyte. FFA enter cardiomyocyte
  via FAT/CD36. In the cytosol, FFA are converted into TG for storage or into FA-CoA
  esters by FACS and successively conjugated with carnitine by CPT-1 to form fatty
  acylcarnitine. CPT-1 is the key-limiting step determining FFA entry in mitochondria
  and its activity is regulated by the inhibitor malonyl-CoA. The concentration of
  malonyl-CoA depends on the balance between its synthesis catalyzed by ACC and its
  degradation catalyzed by MCD. Fatty acylcarnitine enters mitochondria via CT and
  is converted into FA-CoA by CPT-2. In mitochondria, FA-CoA undergo complete degradation
  in the β-oxidation cycle, leading to the production of acetyl-CoA, which is then
  catabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate FADH2 and NADH, that is,
  the reducing equivalents feeding the electron (e−) transport chain. Glucose enters
  cardiomyocytes via the GLUT1 and GLUT4 (GLUT1/4). Once in the cardiomyocyte, glucose
  is phosphorylated by HK. G-6P derived from exogenous glucose and the intracellular
  glycogen pool undergo progressive breakdown through the glycolytic pathway or, to
  a lesser extent, the oxPPP and the polyol pathway. Most of the pyruvate generated
  from glycolysis or lactate dehydrogenation is decarboxylated in mitochondria to
  form acetyl-CoA. This reaction is catalyzed by PDH. ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
