caption: HMG-CoA reductase is a rate-limiting step early in the cholesterol biosynthetic
  pathway, which is inhibited by statins. CHILD syndrome results from mutations in
  NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL), which prevent the post-lanosterol generation
  of cholesterol, potentially leading to pathway-product deficiency in addition to
  metabolite accumulation. Conradi-Hünermann-Happle syndrome is due to mutations in
  a gene encoding emopamil binding protein (EBP), which acts distal to NSDHL in cholesterol
  biosynthesis.
