caption: Edges are displayed with labels that describe the nature of the relationship
  between the nodes. The lines between genes represent known interactions, with solid
  lines representing direct interactions and dashed lines representing indirect interactions.
  Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of
  the gene product (see legend). Blue highlighting indicates GWAS associated genes
  and non-highlighted genes are those identified by IPA. Genes which showed differential
  transcript levels in acute versus convalescent KD are colored red if the level was
  significantly higher during acute KD, green if the level was significantly lower
  and yellow if there was no significant change, with color intensity related to fold
  change. Genes not colored were not measured.
