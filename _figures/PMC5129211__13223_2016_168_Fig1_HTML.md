caption: Roles of Kv1.3-channels in the activation pathway of cellular immunity in
  the respiratory tract and the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
  (COPD). In the initiation of mucosal immunity in the airways, bronchial or alveolar
  macrophages, which phagocytose smoke particles, humorally activate T-lymphocytes
  within the lamina propria of the respiratory mucosa. Kv1.3-channels expressed on
  T-lymphocytes stimulate their IL-2 production and cellular proliferation through
  the activation of calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway. The overexpression of the
  channels over-stimulates such lymphocyte activity, which triggers the development
  of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Potential Kv1.3-channel inhibitors, such
  as CCBs, macrolides, statins and NSAIDs may be useful in the treatment of COPD.
