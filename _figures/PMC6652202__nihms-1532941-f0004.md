caption: Among the potential regulatory networks identified by Ingenuity pathway analysis
  of the genes differentially expressed between fetal and maternal cells (p<0.05),
  the top protein-protein interaction network is shown. It contains key regulatory
  genes involved in invasion and migration (blue circles), differentiation (red circles)
  and proliferation (purple circles). Green symbols indicate downregulated genes,
  and red symbols indicate upregulated genes.
