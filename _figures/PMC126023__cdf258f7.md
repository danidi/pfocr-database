caption: Fig. 7. A model for cell death induced by endogenous DNA damage in S.cerevisiae.
  (A) Pathways yielding viable colonies. Endogenous stress generates AP sites in DNA.
  In wild-type cells, AP sites are repaired primarily by Apn1 and Apn2. NER can act
  as a back-up repair pathway. However, some of the AP sites are converted by DNA
  N-glycosylases/AP lyases (Ntg1, Ntg2, Ogg1) into 3′-blocked (3′-dRP) SSBs which
  are also repaired by Apn1 and Apn2. In apn1 apn2 double mutants, one expects the
  accumulation of 3′-blocked SSBs. The model suggests an alternative repair pathway
  mediated by the Rad1/Rad10 complex through its 3′-flap endonuclease activity. (B) Pathways
  yielding inviable microcolonies. In the absence of Apn1, Apn2 and Rad1/Rad10 proteins,
  3′-blocked SSBs persist and cause DSBs and replication fork collapse. DSBs can induce
  the activation of a G2/M checkpoint that is RAD9 dependent. Cell cycle arrest can
  allow residual repair by the Mus81/Mms4 3′-flap endonuclease, yielding class 1 (300
  large cells). The absence of Mus81/Mms4 results in class 3 microcolonies (17 large
  cells). In the absence of Rad9 (dotted line), the G2/M checkpoint is not activated,
  resulting in class 2 microcolonies (20 normal size cells). In all cases, the accumulation
  of DSBs will cause DNA degradation and cell death.
