caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the pathological cardiac functions of ANKRD1 in
  relation to hypertrophy, fibrosis and apoptosis. Hypertrophic stress response: Pressure
  overload rapidly increases the expression of cardiac ANKRD1 and inhibits the ERK
  and TGF-β/Smad pathways, leading to the attenuation of hypertrophy. This is thought
  to be an adaptive and protective response. Conversely, increase in ANKRD1 also exacerbates
  pathological cardiac remodeling through activation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway,
  a signaling pathway known to have an important role in cardiac hypertrophy. Hence,
  the role of ANKRD1 in cardiac hypertrophy is still controversial; Fibrosis: Nuclear
  ANKRD1 interacts with nucleolin and hinders the binding of positive transcriptional
  activators to the AP-1 promoter site, thus inhibiting transcription of the Mmp13
  gene. This limits the expression of MMP13 to within appropriate physiological levels
  to enable successful tissue repair. On the other hand, expression of Ankrd1 is increased
  in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 knockout mouse. This in turn induces the elevation
  of Egr1 which is associated with cardiac fibrosis. In addition, the concomitant
  upregulation of several genes involved in pro-fibrotic responses including Ankrd1
  also leads to the development of cardiac fibrosis; Apoptosis: Hypoxia-induced up-regulation
  of GADD153 leads to a decrease in ANKRD1 expression which has been shown to cause
  apoptotic cell death. ANKRD1 also acts as a co-factor of the transcription factor
  GATA-4 to induce anti-apoptotic Bcl2 gene expression. These results support the
  role of ANKRD1 as an anti-apoptotic factor. Conversely, it has also been reported
  in hearts stimulated with either angiotensin II or challenged by pressure overload
  that overexpression of ANKRD1 led to an increase in cardiomyocyte apoptosis, indicating
  that ANKRD1 could also have pro-apoptotic properties. Hence, ANKRD1 seems to be
  able to either enhance or inhibit apoptosis under different conditions, depending
  on the type of pathological stimuli. Black arrows indicate the downstream effect.

  the protein. Inhibition of downstream effect is indicated by two red lines drawn
