caption: Interactions between ABA and auxin signaling pathways during elaboration
  of the Arabidopsis root system. This diagram is restricted to genes mentioned in
  the text and does not include all ABA or auxin signaling genes. Downward arrows
  do not imply a simple linear pathway, but are rather used to group genes according
  to function. Crosstalk between the ABA and auxin signaling pathways are indicated
  by arrows, signifying a positive interaction, and blocked lines, signifying a negative
  interaction. When evidence for crosstalk is based on treatment with exogenous ABA
  or IAA, and a specific gene mediating this activity is unknown, the arrows originate
  from the hormone name, rather than a gene name. Orange arrows indicate interactions
  originating from the ABA pathway. Blue arrows indicate connections originating from
  the Auxin pathway. The red arrow indicates a connection between ABA and Auxin signaling
  components that may be independent of their function in ABA or Auxin signaling.
  ABI2 regulates the nitrate transport function of AtNRT1.1/AtNPF6.3, but its effect
  on auxin transport is unknown []. AtRAC7/ROP9 is not included in this diagram, although
  it is clearly involved in ABA/Auxin crosstalk, because its role connecting these
  pathways may be context dependent [,].
