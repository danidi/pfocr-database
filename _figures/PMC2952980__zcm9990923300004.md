caption: Mechanism of macrophage apoptosis caused by H. pylori. This pathway is dependent
  on the activities of the enzymes arginase II, ODC, and SMO. Induction of arginase
  II enhances synthesis of l-ornithine, which is converted into polyamines by ODC
  via a process that requires both H. pylori activation of the ODC promoter and c-Myc
  as a transcriptional enhancer. Production of the polyamine spermine provides a substrate
  for SMO, which is also upregulated by H. pylori. SMO generates H2O2, which causes
  mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cytochrome c release from mitochondria to
  the cytosol, and caspase-3 activation, followed by apoptosis. Induction of macrophage
  apoptosis leads to impairment of mucosal immunity to H. pylori, chronic inflammation,
  and cancer risk (, , ).
