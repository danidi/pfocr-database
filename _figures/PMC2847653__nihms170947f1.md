caption: '(A) Schematic of the Pta-AckA pathway. CoASH, coenzyme A; acCoA, acetyl-CoA;
  Pi, inorganic phosphate; Pta, phosphotransacetylase; acP, acetyl phosphate; AckA,
  acetate kinase. (B) Schematic of a two-component pathway in which the response regulator
  (RR) possesses two distinct sources for its phosphoryl group: its cognate sensor
  kinase (SK) and acP. Note that some SKs also can function as RR phospho-aspartyl
  phosphatases, removing the phosphoryl group from the phosphorylated form of their
  cognate RR, and leading to formation of the unphosphorylated RR and Pi.'
