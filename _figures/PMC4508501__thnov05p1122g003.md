caption: 'Altered steps in miRNA biogenesis lead to cancer. A schematic representation
  of altered steps of the miRNA biogenesis pathway, commonly deregulated in cancer:
  1. miRNA genes contain upstream regulator elements (enhancers/repressors) and promoter
  regions, indicating that miRNAs are subjected to CpG methylation (CpG promoter met);
  2. The alteration in the copy number of miRNA (due to genomic amplification or deletion,
  activating or repressing mutation, loss of epigenetic silencing and transcriptional
  activation) could increase the oncogenic miRNAs or decrease the tumor suppressor
  miRNAs; 3. Alteration in the miRNA processing machinery, i.e. downregulation of
  Drosha, could decrease the cropping of pri-miR to pre-miR; 4. XPO5 mutation could
  prevent pre-miR export to the cytoplasm; 5. Mutation of TARBP2 or downregulation
  of DICER1 decrease mature miRNA levels, causing finally a loss on tumor suppressor
  miRNAs; 6 and 7. Accumulation of oncogenic miRNAs or loss of tumor suppressor miRNAs
  could finally lead to cancer development.'
