caption: A simplified proposed summary of intracellular signaling mechanisms mediating
  the intake inhibitory and weight loss effects of leptin-liraglutide combination
  treatment. Leptin binds to the long form of leptin receptor (LepRb), which activates
  Janus kinase 2 protein (JAK2) and results in the phosphorylation of various tyrosine
  residues and the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (pSTAT3). pSTAT3
  translocates to the nucleus to mediate the transcription of genes related to food
  intake and body weight control. GLP-1 on the other hand, binds to GLP-1 receptor
  and inhibits PTP1B via a direct or indirect pathway (broken lines). PTP1B normally
  dephosphorylates JAK2 and deactivates it. Inhibition of PTP1B therefore disinhibits
  pJAK2. The disinhibition of pJAK2 by GLP-1R activation, together with the activation
  of LepRb signaling, results in a combinatorial increase in pSTAT3, which is proposed
  to mediate the enhanced intake suppression and body weight loss effects of liraglutide
  and leptin co-administration.
