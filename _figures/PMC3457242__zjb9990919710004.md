caption: In vivo carbon flux distribution in C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 during exponential
  growth on 10 g liter−1 (A) and 20 g liter−1 (B) of xylose. The net flux values are
  expressed relative to the specific xylose uptake rate that is given above the uptake
  arrow. Arrows indicate the directions of the net fluxes, and their widths are scaled
  to the flux values. The 95% confidence intervals were less than 10% for all the
  fluxes.
