  water by ascorbate peroxidases using ascorbate as the electron donor, and requiring
  glutathione (GSH) to restore the electron donor. Unscavenged H2O2 is able to diffuse
  across the chloroplast envelope and is thought to start MAP kinase cascades in the

  affect LHCII phosphorylation (state transitions) and plastid gene expression and
  possibly also nuclear gene expression. Glutathione synthesis might be another pathway

  (1O2), is generated at PSII. Because of its short half-life it requires additional
