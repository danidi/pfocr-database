caption: PKA signaling pathway in adrenal tumorigenesis and related mouse models.
  (A) Under normal conditions, ACTH binds to MC2R, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
  that activates adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gsα, thus increasing intracellular levels
  of cAMP. Upon binding of cAMP to regulatory subunits (R) of PKA, the complex dissociates
  releasing the catalytic subunits (C) which in turn phosphorylate (among others)
  the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). Once phosphorylated, CREB transcription
  factor regulates the expression of steroidogenic and proliferative genes. In absence
  of ACTH, the pathway is repressed through the activity of several phosphodiesterases
  (PDE) that inactivate cAMP. (B) Molecular alterations of several components of cAMP/PKA
  signaling pathway cause adrenal hyperplasias and tumors. (1) Activating mutations
  of MC2R found in PBMAH patients lead to higher activation of the pathway. No mouse
  model is actually available for Mcr2 activating mutations. (2) Hormones other than
  ACTH (GIP/hCG/LH), through ectopic expression of several GPCRs, may induce ACTH-independent
  hypercortisolism in PBMAH patients. Xenograft mouse models nicely recapitulate this
  pathologic context. (3) Activating mutations in GNAS gene, encoding for the subunit
  α of the stimulatory G protein, causes higher activation of the pathway. These mutations
  are the cause of adrenal hyperplasia associated with Cushing’s syndrome in Mc-Cune
  Albright syndrome, whereas somatic mutations have been found in cortisol-producing
  adenomas. No mouse model is actually available for Gnas-activating mutations. (4)
  Inactivating mutations in PDE genes lead to an accumulation of cAMP, thus causing
  the persistent activation of the pathway in absence of ACTH and they have been associated
  with PBMAH and hypercortisolism. Whole-body PDE8B knockout mice developed mild hyperplasia.
  (5a) Most inactivating mutations in the PRKARIA gene, encoding the 1α regulatory
  subunit (R1α) of the PKA, lead to aberrant transcripts and to the absence of the
  protein, resulting in constitutive activation of PKA. Adrenocortical-specific Prkar1a
  knockout (AdKO) mice develop a PPNAD-like syndrome with adrenal hyperplasia and
  ACTH-independent hypercorticosteronism. (5b) Some PRKARIA gene mutations lead to
  expressed mutated (truncated) R1α proteins that also cause increased PKA activation.
  These mutations are associated with a more severe phenotype for reasons still not
  understood to date. No mouse model is available for expressed mutated R1α proteins.
  (6) Mutations in the PRKACA gene encoding for the catalytic subunit α (Cα) of the
  PKA alter its interaction with regulatory subunits leading to constitutive activation
  of PKA-Cα and increased steroidogenesis. These mutations have been identified in
  many patients with cortisol-producing adenomas. No mouse model is actually available
  for Prkaca activating mutations. (7) Inactivating germline and somatic mutations
  in the armadillo repeat-containing 5 (ARMC5) gene have been identified in ~50% of
  patients with PBMAH. The function and the mechanisms by which ARMC5 contributes
  to the pathogenesis of PBMAH are unknown. In vitro studies suggest a role in steroidogenesis
  and apoptosis processes and a possible interplay with the PKA pathway, which is
  supported by the association of ARMC5 mutations with particular expression profile
  of GPCRs. No loss of function mouse model is actually available for Armc5.
