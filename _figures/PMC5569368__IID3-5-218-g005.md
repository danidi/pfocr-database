caption: HFE and classical MHC I molecules present homologous structures and are synthesized
  and folded within the endoplasmic reticulum. A) Structures of HLA‐A2 and HFE and
  binding sites to antigen presentation chaperones for HLA‐A2, as well as degree of
  conservation of these sites in HFE. B) Schema depicting the MHC I antigen presentation
  pathway as well as HFE synthesis, surface transport, and expression.
