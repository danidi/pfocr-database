caption: 'Brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin kinase receptor B (TrkB)
  pathway. BDNF is synthesized as a precursor protein (pro‐BDNF) that is proteolytically
  processed into mature BDNF by intracellular proteases and/or extracellular proteases.,
  ,  Synthesis, release, and action of BDNF are regulated by neuronal activity. BDNF
  mRNA increases after neuron depolarization and BDNF levels are mediated by calcium‐calmodulin‐dependent
  protein kinases (CaMK). TrkB is a tyrosine kinase membrane protein highly expressed
  in both presynaptic axons and postsynaptic densities., ,  TrkB activation promotes
  spine formation, neuronal survival, and long‐term potentiation., , , ,  TrkB consists
  of the following three main domains: an extracellular domain where the ligand (usually
  BDNF) binds, a transmembrane domain, and a cytosolic domain, which contains the
  catalytic sites that are responsible for a transphosphorylation reaction. Binding
  of BDNF to the recognition site increases its affinity for the TrkB monomer, stabilizing
  to form a TrkB dimer. This dimerization activates the catalytic sites, and each
  TrkB phosphorylates the other on specific tyrosine residues (Y706). Secondary messenger
  molecules (such as sarc homology containing [Shc] and phospholipase C gamma [PLCγ])
  bind to the phospho‐tyrosines in positions 515 (Y515) and 816 (Y816) and activate
  the Ras/Erk and PIP3/Ca+2 dependent pathways, respectively. The latter pathway leads
  to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and eventually to the phosphorylation of
  cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB). CREB in turn induces gene expression
  involved in neuroplasticity., , , , , ,  Neuronal activation and high‐frequency
  stimulation facilitate the localization of TrkB from intracellular pools to the
  cell surface, requiring a Ca+2 influx. Akt, cellular homolog of murine thymoma virus
  akt8 oncogene; CBP, CREB‐binding protein; ERK, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase;
  P, phosphorylation.'
