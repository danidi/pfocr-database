caption: 'RNF8 and RNF168 promote the accumulation of 53BP1 and RAP80 at DSB sites.
  (A) RNF8 conjugates the K63-linked ubiquitin chain on histone H1 with UBC13. RNF168
  accumulates at DSB sites by binding to K63-ubiquitinated histone H1 and then ubiquitinates
  histone H2A on K15 (H2AK15Ub). (B) 53BP1 interacts with H2AK15Ub and K20-dimethylated
  histone H4 (H4K20diMe). L3MBTL1, JMJD2A and JMJD2B are ubiquitinated and removed
  from DSB sites before 53BP1 accumulation. (C) RAP80, a component of the BRCA1-A
  complex, interacts with the K63-linked ubiquitin chain at DSB sites. Ub: ubiquitin,
  P: phosphate, Me: methyl.'
