caption: Examples of functions of human disease-related retrocopies. (A) RNA-mediated
  epigenetic regulation. POU5F1P5 along with G9a and Ezh2 proteins create silencing
  complex that inhibits transcription of POU5F1. The complex can become blocked when
  proteins PURA and NCL bind to the POU5F1P5. (B) Splicing regulation. Antisense transcript
  of retrocopy AC021224.1-201 can bind to the parental gene hnRNPA1 and mask the 5′
  splice site in the sixth intron. (C) Sponging miRNA. Under cancer condition, decreased
  expression level of retrocopy PTENP1 contributes to increased miRNA binding to the
  PTEN and drives the suppressor gene on the degradation pathway. In turn, binding
  miRNAs to the highly expressed RACGAP1P allows for expression of oncogene RACGAP1.
  (D) Competition for stabilizing factors. Elevated expression of HMGA1-p (HMGA1P8)
  results in destabilization of parental gene mRNA by effective competition for a
  trans-acting cytoplasmic protein critical to mRNA stability. Low expression level
  of HMGA1 gene contributes to decreased expression of the INSR gene which consequently
  manifests itself in insulin resistance. (E) Fusion transcripts. High sequence similarity
  between AKIRIN1 and its retrocopy retro_hsap_4692, nested in the host gene OPHN1
  may lead to non-allelic recombination and fusion transcript formed by AKIRIN1 and
  OPHN1.
