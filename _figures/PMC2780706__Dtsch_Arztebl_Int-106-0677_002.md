caption: Enzymatic sources of ROS, their effects and pharmacological modulation. NO
  synthases (NOS) generate nitric oxide (NO) from the amino acid arginine. NO activates
  soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which mediates its protective effects. sGC generates
  the second messenger cyclic GMP (cGMP). The phosphorylation of the cGMP dependent
  protein kinase substrate vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is a biomarker
  for this signaling pathway. Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces oxidative stress by
  activating NADPH oxidases (NOX). ROS generated by NOX result, among others, in accumulation
  of the arginine derivate asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor
  of NOS. Furthermore, NOS is oxidized and “uncoupled” by ROS. Uncoupled NOS generates
  ROS instead of NO. Additionally, ROS oxidize the NO receptor sGC (ox sGC). In this
  process, the heme group of the sGC is oxidized first, and in a second step this
  group is then released from sGC resulting in heme free (apo-)sGC, which cannot be
  activated by NO. Apo-sGC can be reactivated by sGC activators. sGC stimulators affect
  non-oxidized sGC. They allow maximum sGC activity even in the presence of reduced
  NO concentrations. Red indicates disease promoting proteins or compounds; green,

  description: Enzymatic sources of ROS, their effects and pharmacological modulation.
    NO synthases (NOS) generate nitric oxide (NO) from the amino acid arginine. NO
    activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which mediates its protective effects.
    sGC generates the second messenger cyclic GMP (cGMP). The phosphorylation of the
    cGMP dependent protein kinase substrate vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein
    (VASP) is a biomarker for this signaling pathway. Angiotensin II (Ang II) induces
    oxidative stress by activating NADPH oxidases (NOX). ROS generated by NOX result,
