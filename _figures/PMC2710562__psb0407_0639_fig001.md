caption: 'A model for biosynthesis of terpenes via the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA)
  pathway and the plastidic 2-C-methyl erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, indicating
  that a high degree of pathway crosstalk can occur. Recent data indicate that the
  enzyme encoded by MtEBOS functions solely in the synthesis of monoterpenes, primarily
  (E)-?-ocimene. The indicated enzymes are: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase
  (HMGR), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS), 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate
  reductoisomerase (DXR) and individual terpene synthases (TPS). The indicated precursors
  are: isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), dimethyl allyl diphosphate (DMAPP), farnesyl
  pyrophosphate (FPP), geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP).
  The dashed arrow represents more than one step (figure adapted from Bede et al.
  2006).'
