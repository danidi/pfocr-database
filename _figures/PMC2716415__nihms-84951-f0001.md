caption: The sulfhydryl-containing amino acid homocysteine is an intermediate of normal
  methionine metabolism. Mutations in the 5,10 methyl-tetrahydrofolate reductase and
  cystathionine β-synthase genes impair homocysteine conversion to methionine and
  cystathionine, respectively. Alternatively, elevated levels of homocysteine may
  result from nutritional deficiencies of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12
  that are key enzyme cofactors required for normal homocysteine metabolism. Folic
  acid replenishes the tetrahydrofolate pool and is required for normal methionine
  synthase activity; however, folic acid also increases S-adenosylmethionine. This
  methyl donor is a precursor for asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), an inhibitor
  of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, which leads to uncoupling of the enzyme, decreased
  bioavailable nitric oxide, and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Finally, the antioxidant
  glutathione is an end product of cysteine metabolism; aberrant transulfuration pathway
  activity has been implicated in decreased cellular antioxidant protection, which
  may represent one way by which elevated homocysteine levels serve as a surrogate
  for downstream processes that more specifically characterize the oxidative pathophysiology
  of various diseases linked to hyperhomocysteinemia. Adapted from Maron and Loscalzo
