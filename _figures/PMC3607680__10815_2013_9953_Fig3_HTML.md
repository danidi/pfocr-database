caption: The one carbon cycle. Importance of group B vitamins and Zinc in Homocysteine
  recycling. Homocysteine can be recycled using three pathways; however the only one
  strongly expressed in the human oocyte is the MS pathway. The betaine-dimethyl glycine
  pathway is weakly expressed and the CBS pathway is totally absent during the pre-genomic
  activation period. SAH S-Adenosyl Homocysteine; SAM S-Adenosyl Methionine; THF tetrahydrofolate,
  CBS cystathionine beta synthase; MS Methionine synthase; MTHFR Methyltetrahydrofolate
  reductase Zn Zinc
