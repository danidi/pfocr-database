caption: 'Structural mapping of pathogenic single side chain substitutions in MC4R.
  (A) Positions of naturally-occurring side chain substitutions () are highlighted
  on a putative active state MC4R model in interaction with α-MSH and G-protein. This
  structural mapping enables a detailed estimation of individual molecular mechanisms
  for each mutation by evaluation of the wild-type amino acid function. The ligand
  and the heterotrimeric G-protein (colors: α-subunit, chocolate: β-subunit, wheat;
  γ-subunit green) are shown as surfaces; the receptor is presented as a backbone
  ribbon (gray). Residues associated with pathogenic substitutions are highlighted
  (sticks), whereby the color magenta indicates an experimentally proven reduction
  in signaling and the color blue a reported signaling property that corresponds to
  wild-type (“like wild-type,” ) (no functional molecular data reported so far, white).
  (B) This figure shows α-MSH in interaction with MC4R as suggested by our docking
  studies () and highlights exclusively those wild-type amino acid residues of reported
  pathogenic substitutions that are in close proximity or in direct interacting contact
  to α-MSH. In conclusion, these residues are potentially involved in ligand binding
  and any side chain variation may lead to a modified ligand binding capacity. Potential
  hydrogen bonds between α-MSH and MC4R are shown as dashed lines (black). (C) Similar
  to (B), also the detailed MC4R/G-protein interface can be analyzed on the potential
  participation of wild-type residues that might be involved in G-protein binding.
  Indeed, the model suggests that several residues are in direct interaction distance
  to the α-subunit of Gs, or, e.g., H76 in close proximity to the β-subunit. In conclusion,
  pathogenic mutations at these positions can be suggested to modify the MC4R/Gs interface,
  which, in conclusion, leads to a reduced signaling capacity for the respective pathway.'
