caption: De novo and salvage pathways for PLP biosynthesis in E. coli K-12. The de
  novo pathway illustrates that the intermediate 4PHT is synthesized from erythrose
  4-phosphate (E4P) by a series of steps, one of which is catalyzed by the PdxB dehydrogenase
  (, , ). 4PHT can be produced in pdxB mutants from GA or 4HT by alternative pathways
  that normally do not contribute to de novo PLP biosynthesis (, , ). PNP, which is
  the first B6 vitamer synthesized by the de novo biosynthetic pathway, is formed
  by the condensation of 4PHT and d-1-deoxyxylulose (DX) (, , , ). PNP formation from
  the de novo pathway does not require the activities of PL and PN kinases, which
  phosphorylate PL, PN, and PM taken up from the environment. The PNP/PMP oxidase
  PdxH functions in both the de novo and salvage pathways. As shown here, PdxY is
  a PL kinase in vivo, whereas PdxK is a PN kinase that can also phosphorylate PL
  and PM. See the text for additional details.
