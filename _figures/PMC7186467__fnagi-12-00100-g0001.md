caption: Targeting mitochondria for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Distinct
  experimental approaches can be used to selectively interfere with the mutation-induced
  deregulation of mitochondrial activities in PD neurons. Thus, deranged mitochondrial
  cAMP signaling can be restored using protein-protein interaction (PPI)/targeting
  molecules that support the assembly of A-Kinase Anchor Protein (AKAP) complexes
  at mitochondria. This would positively impact on cell survival and metabolism of
  PD neurons. Similarly, peptidomimetics that positively regulate X protein activity
  at mitochondria have been successfully used to prevent oxidative stress and apoptotic
  cell death induced by mitochondrial toxins. Similarly, inhibiting p13 or treating
  with necrosis inhibitors (Nec-1) in toxin-induced or familial forms of PD positively
  impacts on oxidative metabolism and neuronal survival. Moreover, restoring PINK1-Parkin
  pathway using selective agonists or preventing ubiquitin-specific protease (USP)-mediated
  deubiquitination of Parkin substrates with selective USP inhibitors could restore
  mitophagy in PD neurons, preventing accumulation of damaged mitochondria, oxidative
  stress, and neuronal apoptosis. Finally, sustaining the activity of respiratory
  enzymes as succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) with chemical drugs represents
  a promising therapeutic approach to restore oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore (PTP), preventing apoptotic or necroptotic neuronal
  loss.
