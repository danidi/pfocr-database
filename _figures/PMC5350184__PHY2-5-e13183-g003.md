caption: Genes involved in skeletal muscle TLR‐ and insulin receptor signaling related
  to changes in plasma concentration of fetuin‐A and FFAs. (A) Genes involved in skeletal
  muscle TLR‐signaling correlated with plasma fetuin‐A levels. (B) Genes involved
  in skeletal muscle insulin receptor signaling correlated with plasma fetuin‐A levels.
  (C) Genes involved in skeletal muscle TLR‐signaling correlated with plasma FFAs
  levels. (D) Genes involved in skeletal muscle insulin receptor signaling correlated
  with plasma FFAs levels. (E) Genes involved in skeletal muscle TLR‐signaling correlated
  with the interaction between plasma concentration of fetuin‐A and FFAs. (F) Genes
  involved in skeletal muscle insulin receptor signaling correlated with the interaction
  between plasma concentration of fetuin‐A and FFAs. The relationship between gene
  expression and plasma fetuin‐A and FFAs levels was modeled using linear regression.
  The genes significantly predicted by the model were overlapped with KEGG, Reactome,
  and Biocarta pathways related to TLR‐ and insulin receptor signaling using a hypergeometric
  distribution, to test if the overlap was larger than expected by chance. The statistics
  and more details regarding the pathway analyses are presented in the legend to Table .
  Thinner lines indicate the strongest significance. “:” is the Wilkinson‐Rogers symbolic
  description of factorial models for analysis of variance indicating an interaction.
