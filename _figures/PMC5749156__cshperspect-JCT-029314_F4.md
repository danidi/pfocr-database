caption: Molecular mechanisms of leak and pore pathway regulation. (A) Tight junction
  complex remodeling at steady-state and in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
  Dashed black lines indicate energy-independent diffusion of claudins (green, blue)
  and occludin (red) within the membrane; the mobile fractions of occludin and claudin
  are both increased by TNF. Solid black lines indicate energy-dependent zonula occludens-1
  (ZO-1) (orange) exchange between tight junction and cytosolic pools. Occludin endocytosis
  (white arrow) is driven by TNF-induced myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) activation
  and requires both caveolin-1 and ZO-1. (B) Phosphorylation regulates interactions
  between tight junction proteins and can be exploited to modify claudin-2 channel
  activity. Diagram shows interactions and dynamic behavior of proteins involved in
  tight junction regulation by casein kinase 2 (CK2). Upper panel. CK2-mediated phosphorylation
  of occludin S408 facilitates dimerization and diffusion within the membrane, thereby
  limiting occludin binding to ZO-1 and claudin-2 and allowing flux across claudin-2
  pores. Lower panel. CK2 inhibition and occludin dephosphorylation promotes formation
  of occludin:ZO-1:claudin-2 complexes that reduce claudin-2 anchoring and pore function
  at the tight junction. (Part B, from ; reprinted, with permission from The Rockefeller
