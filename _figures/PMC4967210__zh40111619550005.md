caption: Ingenuity Pathways Analysis of the effects of TXNIP deletion. Ingenuity Pathways
  Analysis was used to generate this pathway by growing all downstream interactions
  of TXNIP that were identified in the array data set. Upregulated and downregulated
  genes in cTKO hearts are represented by positive and negative numbers, respectively.
  CDKN1A, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1; FASN, fatty acid synthase, WWP2, E3
  ubiquitin-protein ligase; Acot1, acyl-CoA thioesterase; KDR, kinase insert domain
  receptor, a type III receptor tyrosine kinase.
