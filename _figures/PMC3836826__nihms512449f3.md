caption: Ethanol intake increases cortisol and activates NF-κB via Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4). NF-κB activation increases innate immune activity. Hippocampal neurogenesis
  is inhibited via NFκB. NR4A2 represses NF-κB transactivation of other genes. When
  stress cannot be resolved by the eIF2 pathway, transcription of TXNIP is increased
  which also increases NF-κB transactivation. Red and Green vertical arrows indicate
  pathways, genes, or signaling molecules that have increased/decreased expression
  or activity in the hippocampus of alcoholics.
