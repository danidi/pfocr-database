caption: 'Schematic illustration of the coagulation pathway and its inhibitor systems.
  Three pathways are implicated in the classical blood coagulation: (i) intrinsic
  pathway (ii) extrinsic and (iii) the common pathway. The majority of the molecules
  identified in this study is in the common pathway. * represents transcripts over-expressed
  in medium follicular cells associated with developmental competence (M+/ M−). The
  grey box contains proteins associated with anticoagulation. Xa, factor Xa; PL, phospholipids;
  Ca, calcium.'
