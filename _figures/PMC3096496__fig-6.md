caption: Model depicting the generation and consequences of ROS-mediated base damage.
  Reactive oxygen species are generated from multiple exogenous and endogenous sources,
  such as ultraviolet light, radiation, metal ions, cellular respiration, imbalance
  of cellular antioxidant systems, and phagocytes. ROS-generated DNA base lesions,
  such as 8-oxoG and FapyG, are subject to repair, initiated by lesion-specific DNA
  glycosylases (e.g., NEIL1, NEIL2, MYH, MBD4, NTHL1, OGG1, and UNG, as indicated).
  Recognition and repair of these lesions through the BER pathway results in enhanced
  cellular survival and genome maintenance. Inability to recognize or repair oxidative
  lesions leads to genomic instability, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurodegeneration,
  cancer, and aging. The consequences of unrepaired oxidative damage can result in
  a feedback loop generating additional ROS, leading to a cycle of increasing ROS
  and elevated genome instability.
