caption: Schematic diagram summarizing the bidirectional role of PIAS1 in regulating
  JNK-dependent oxidative stress responses. PIAS1 is a target as well as a negative
  regulator of the activated JNK pathway in HESCs exposed to ROS. PIAS1 also drives
  the associated hypersumoylation response and inhibits the expression of defense
  genes, and thereby promotes oxidative apoptosis in HESCs.

papertitle: The SUMO E3-ligase PIAS1 couples reactive oxygen species-dependent JNK
  activation to oxidative cell death.
