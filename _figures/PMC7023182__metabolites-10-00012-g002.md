caption: Folate and S-adenosylmethionine pathways are reorganized in a S. enterica
  ridA mutant. Metabolites (circles) and gene products (rectangles) involved in (A)
  lysine, methionine, and folate biosynthesis and (B) purine, histidine, and thiamine
  biosynthesis are depicted, with each arrow representing a biochemical step in the
  pathway. Blue shading denotes a significantly (FDR < 0.05) increased abundance of
  the respective metabolite/transcript in ridA cells, while red shading indicates
  a significantly decreased abundance in ridA cells. Grey gene products showed no
  significant difference between wild-type and ridA cells, while grey metabolites
  were either not identified or not significantly altered. A bold border around a
  gene product designates enzymes that use PLP as a cofactor. GlyA is a known target
  for 2AA damage and is shown with a red border. Dashed arrows and triangles indicated
  general pathways which utilize the metabolite at the base of the arrow, while blue
  and red colored arrows denote genes involved in biosynthesis of that compound up-
  or down-regulated, respectively.
