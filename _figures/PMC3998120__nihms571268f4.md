caption: (A) Metastatic traits acquired by a quantitative gain in pathway output.
  Amplification of the signaling capacity of cell survival and proliferation pathways
  provides survival and stemness advantages to disseminated cancer cells. In this
  case, the level of metastatic fitness is proportional to the robustness of the signaling
  pathway. In primary tumors with a relatively high abundance of growth and survival
  signals, the signaling capacity of oncogenic pathways such as PI3K, Notch, and Wnt,
  is sufficient to support tumor growth. However, for disseminated cancer cells reaching
  distant tissue microenvironment where pathway-activating signals are scarce, the
  signaling capacity of these pathways is not sufficient for survival. The traits
  selected under such pressure include the expression of components that amplify the
  signaling capacity of the pathway in response to limiting levels of pathway activators
  in the host microenvironment. In triple-negative breast cancer examples include
  VCAM-1 and SRC as amplifiers of the PI3K pathway in cancer cells reaching the lungs
  or the bone marrow, respectively, whereas Tenascin C and Periostin act as amplifiers
  of the WNT and NOTCH pathways in cancer cells reaching the lungs.(B) Metastatic
  traits acquired by a qualitative expansion of pathway output. Tumor-initiating pathways
  may additionally provide prometastatic traits by gaining access to subsets of target
  genes that enhance the homing of disseminated cancer cells to sites of survival.
  In this case, the level of meta-static fitness is not linearly proportional to the
  signaling strength of the pathway but depends of the pathway activating an additional
  set of effectors. One example is provided by the expansion of target genes that
  the HIF pathway activates in renal cell carcinoma as a result of epigenetic modifications
  that open the gene promoters to access by activated HIF.
