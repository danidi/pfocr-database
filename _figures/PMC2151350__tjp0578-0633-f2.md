  24-hydroxylase inactivates VitD. The endocytotic uptake of PTH and VitD is severely
  impaired in the absence of ClC-5 (A and B; indicated by red minus symbols). As a

  compared to wild-type (A–C). This leads to an enhanced stimulation of apical PTH
  receptors (B; green plus symbols), causing the endocytosis and degradation of the
  sodium–phosphate cotransporter NaPi-2a (leading to phosphaturia) and increasing
  α-hydroxylase while decreasing 24-hydroxylase levels. Similar changes in hydroxylase
  levels also result from the impaired apical endocytosis of VitD, which acts on the
  transcription of the respective genes (not shown). The altered hydroxylase activities
  tend to produce more active hormone (1,25-VitD). Such an increase, however, is counteracted
  by a decrease in precursor availability due to its defective endocytotic uptake.
  Thus, depending on other factors, the amount of 1,25-VitD released into the blood
  may be decreased or increased (B). C, in contrast to proximal tubules, in which
  VitD is taken up primarily by apical endocytosis of its binding protein and is hence
  decreased in ClC-5 KO cells, it enters distal tubular cells mainly by diffusion
  of the free hormone. The increased luminal concentration of 1,25-VitD in distal
  segments of Clcn5− nephrons enhances the transcription of distal VitD target genes
  like that of the ion channel TRPV5 ().'
