caption: IGFR1, a possible target in tumor progression and metastasis. Illustration
  of the potential role of IGFR1 in mediating metastasis in breast cancer cells. IGF-1
  ligand binds to IGFR1. The activated receptor is internalized; Rab5 is recruited
  leading to the formation of the early endosome and subsequent launching of the downstream
  endocytic machinery and MAPK pathway via the Shc/Sos/Ras complexes. The IGFR1 is
  later shuttled back to the plasma membrane via the recycling endosome (RE), or to
  the lysosome through the late endosome (LE). It is known that IGF-1 can also lead
  to the transactivation of the EGFR internalization of the EGFR and subsequent degradation
  of the receptor. Activation of the MAPK pathway led to the transcription and secretion
  of metalloproteinases such as MMP2 and MMP9, degradation of the basement membrane,
  actin polymerization and reorganization of integrin receptors.
