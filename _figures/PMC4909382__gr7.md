caption: Schematic depiction of the antiapoptotic conditions including the PRL signaling
  pathway in young RPE versus the proapoptotic conditions in aging RPE. Young RPE
  cells express PRL and its receptor (PRLR) that (1) signal for the synthesis of reduced
  glutathione (GSH) that transforms two molecules of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into
  water and (2) induces the transcription of catalase, which also processes H2O2 into
  water; both of these processes limit ROS levels. This antioxidant pathway is more
  prominent than the pro-oxidant pathway comprised by the TRPM2-mediated intracellular
  Ca2+ rise induced by the metabolite 2′O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (O-Ac-ADPR) that results
  from the deacetylation (removal of Ac group) of various substrates by SIRT2. The
  viability of RPE is therefore not jeopardized. In contrast, in aged RPE cells, the
  PRL signaling pathway is blunted. Therefore, the pro-oxidant pathway predominates
  over the antioxidant one. High levels of ROS, illustrated by increased H2O2, promote
  the up-regulation of SIRT2 which, in turn, activates TRPM2 by producing O-Ac-ADPR.
  The subsequent sustained rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels can depolarize mitochondria
  (), which causes apoptosis. RPE from PRLR null (−/−) mice emphasizes these features.
