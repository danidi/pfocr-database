caption: The proposed circuitry of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. The
  cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway is proposed to begin with the detection of
  inflammation in the periphery. This information is relayed by vagal afferent neurons
  to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) resulting in vagal efferent (parasympathetic)
  outflow to sympathetic ganglia that innervate the spleen and release norepinephrine
  (NE). This NE activates β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) on choline acetyltransferase
  (ChAT+) T cells that function as signaling intermediaries causing ACh to be synthesized
  and released. Adjacent macrophages express the nicotinic α7-receptor (α7R), which
  when activated by T cell-derived ACh reduces NF-κB signaling and prevents tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. The alternative sympathetic efferent arm is
  also depicted whereby the efferent arm comprises pre- and postganglionic sympathetic
  neurons independent of the involvement of parasympathetic neurons. DAMPs, danger-associated
  molecular patterns; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; DMN, dorsal motor
  nucleus of the vagus.
