caption: Model for control of LHβ gene expression by Egr-1, Ptx1, and SF-1. (A) In
  the absence of GnRH, Egr-1 is expressed at a low level. The LHβ gene is activated
  by Ptx1, SF-1, and low levels of Egr-1. (B) When GnRH is secreted from the hypothalamus,
  it binds to its receptor (GnRH-R), leading to activation of G-protein-linked PLC
  and IP3 intracellular signaling pathways (). PLC cleaves PIP2 to generate IP3 and
  DAG. IP3 increases intracellular calcium levels (by L-type voltage-sensitive channel
  and release by the endoplasmic reticulum [ER]), whereas DAG activates PKC. Activation
  of PKC leads to increased mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) activity, leading to phosphorylation of Egr-1 (, ). Egr-1
  mRNA levels are rapidly increased by GnRH via the PKC pathway, rather than by PKA
  or calcium (Ca2+). Egr-1 synergizes with Ptx1 and SF-1 to rapidly increase LHβ gene
  expression.
