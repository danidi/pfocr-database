caption: 'Schematic diagram of the biosynthetic pathway for anthocyanins, caffeoylquinates,
  and other major phenolic derivatives in potato tuber. Enzymes abbreviated are as
  follows: ADH, arogenate dehydrogenase; ADT, arogenate dehydratase; AGMT, anthocyanidin-glycoside-3′-O-methyl
  transferase; AS, anthocyanin synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate ligase; CM, chorismate mutase; DFR,
  dihydroflavonol reductase; F3H, flavonone-3-hydroxylase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid-3′,5′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol
  synthase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; HQT,
  hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; PDH, prephenate dehydratase; PHT, putrescine N-hydroxycinnamoyl transferase.
  For simplicity, only anthocyanidins and not glycosylated anthocyanins are shown.
  The enzymes involved in anthocyanin glycosylation (A3GT, anthocyanidin-3-O-glycosyl
  transferase, A5GT, anthocyanidin-5-O-glycosyl transferase, and GFG, UDP-glucose
  3-O-flavonoid glucosyltransferase) are not shown due to space limitations. AGA (anthocyanidin-3′-O-glycoside-6′-O-acyl
  transferase) which decorates anthocyanin glycosides with hydroxycinnamoyl groups
  is also not represented. The steps required for anthocyanidin synthesis are highlighted
  in the shaded box.'
