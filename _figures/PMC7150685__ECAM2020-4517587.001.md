caption: A schematic illustration of the cathepsin-related immune responses in periodontitis
  linking to the diseases within the whole body. In the bacteria (components)-stimulated
  cells, cathepsin B involves in activation of TLR signaling to produce IL-1β, TNF-α,
  and amyloid (A) β, and cathepsin S involves in maturation of MHC class II for driving
  CD4+ (helper) T cells to produce IFN-γ (Th1) and IL-17 (Th17). Cathepsin K involves
  in activation of the TLR/autophagy pathway to produce type I interferon (IFN). The
  periodontitis cathepsin-related proinflammatory mediators involve in systemic diseases
  and Alzheimer's disease via the circulation.
