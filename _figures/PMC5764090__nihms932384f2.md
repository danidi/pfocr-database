caption: In primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (top
  panel), autocrine IL-13 signaling and chromosome 9p24 amplification result in JAK2
  constitutive activation. In addition to STAT6 phosphorylation, JAK2 can also phosphorylate
  tyrosine 41 of the histone H3 (H3Y41) and subsequently leads to euchromatic gene
  transcription. JAK2 target genes that are induced for expression through this non-canonical
  mechanism include JAK2 itself, the other 9p24 amplicon genes JMJD2C, PD-L1 and PD-L2,
  and many oncogenic genes such as MYC. Thus, persistent expression of these genes
  promotes cancer cell survival and proliferation or evades tumor immunity. In activated
  B cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC DLBCL) (bottom panel), JAK1 is constitutively
  activated by autocrine production of IL-6 and/or IL-10, which results from MYD88
  mutations (mainly L265P) and other NF-κB activation mechanisms. Activated JAK1 regulates
  gene expression through both the canonical STAT3 pathway (Li Lu, unpublished data)
  and the non-canonical chromatin modification mechanism to promote cell survival
  and proliferation, as well as modulate the tumor microenvironment (see details in
  the text).
