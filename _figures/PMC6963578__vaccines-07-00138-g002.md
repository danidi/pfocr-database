caption: Schematic diagram of interactions between arenavirus proteins and host innate
  immune machinery. During arenavirus infection, viral-derived double-stranded RNA
  (dsRNA) molecules may be produced during viral RNA synthesis and recognized by host
  dsRNA sensor RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and protein kinase R (PKR). This may trigger
  a signaling cascade that leads to a Type I interferon (IFN-I) response and PKR response,
  respectively. The nucleoprotein (NP) exonuclease (ExoN) efficaciously degrades dsRNA
  in biochemistry assays. Plasmid-expressed NP and the Z of pathogenic arenaviruses
  also block the IFN pathway at several different points. During infection, the interaction
  of highly pathogenic arenaviruses with the RLR and PKR pathways differs remarkably,
  which is discussed in the text.
