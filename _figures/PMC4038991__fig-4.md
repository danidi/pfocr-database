caption: A general model for mammalian cellular circadian timekeeping. Circadian timekeeping
  is functionally distributed within the cell's metabolic and signaling networks (top
  level) and persists in the absence of nascent gene expression, as in erythrocytes.
  In most (nucleated) cells however, the timing information sustained within this
  distributed network is communicated through phase-dependent regulation of protein
  activity, stability, and localization as observed, for example, in the canonical
  “clock protein” transcription factors (middle level). These act as coincidence-detecting
  substrate effectors that effectively “read” changes in the cytosolic network state
  over time, and “write” it into changes in nuclear chromatin structure and gene expression
  (lower level). Rhythmic modulation of chromatin structure by “clock proteins” facilitates
  co-ordinated temporal regulation of downstream gene expression circuits, including
  their own cognate clock gene promoters, resulting in signal amplification. Signal-to-noise
  is further increased by phase-specific protein and mRNA degradation, which imparts
  directionality to the circadian cycle. Rhythmic modulation of “clock-controlled
  genes” facilitates co-ordinated temporal regulation of physiology, and feeds forward
  into metabolic/signaling networks (dotted curved arrows), modulating expression
  of some component mechanisms, for example, rhythmic NAMPT expression facilitates
  rhythmic activity of the NAD+ salvage pathway (), PDE1B degrades cAMP and affects
  rhythmic amplitude (). The circadian state of the signaling network modulates communication
  with local and distant targets, while selectively and temporally gating the capacity
  of relevant extracellular signals to modulate circadian phase (solid horizontal
  arrows at top represent signaling over the plasma membrane). cAMP, cyclic AMP; NAMPT,
  nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; PDE, phosphodiesterase.
