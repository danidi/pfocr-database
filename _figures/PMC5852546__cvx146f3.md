caption: Molecular signals implicated in fibroblast activation in the pressure-overloaded
  RV. Right ventricular pressure overload transduces mechanosensitive signalling in
  cardiomyocytes (CM), fibroblasts (F), vascular endothelial cells (EC), and macrophages
  (Ma), stimulating neurohumoral pathways and activating reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  generation. Activation of the RAAS pathway, adrenergic signalling, and oxidative
  stress stimulate fibroblast expansion and triggers synthesis of extracellular matrix
  proteins. Angiotensin II and aldosterone may also induce an inflammatory and fibrogenic
  program in endothelial cells, stimulating expression of endothelin-1 (ET-1), and
  synthesis of chemokines, and triggering recruitment of monocytes (Mo). Activated
  macrophages secrete transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and other growth factors
  in the cardiac interstitium. Enrichment of the extracellular matrix though the deposition
  of matricellular proteins regulates activation of growth factor signalling. TGF-β
  exerts potent matrix-preserving actions by promoting myofibroblast transdifferentiation,
  by stimulating synthesis of matrix proteins, and by inducing expression of antiproteases.
