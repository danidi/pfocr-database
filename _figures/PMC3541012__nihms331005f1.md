caption: propose that saturated long chain fatty acids (FA) can induce new intracellular
  membranes to form that bind c-Src, leading to its autophosporylation and activation,
  and starting a JNK signaling cascade giving rise to insulin resistance. These new
  membrane domains result from an imbalance in the incorporation of saturated (orange)
  and unsaturated (blue) fatty acids from diet. Dietary fat can also induce new lipid
  droplets. Rich in saturated chains, these new surfaces, bilayer or monolayer, could
  induce the accumulation of dually myristoylated and palmitoylated proteins via interaction
  of their saturated alkyl chains. c-Src is myristoylated, not palmitoylated, and
  binds to surfaces with anionic lipids. Long chain saturated fatty acids may also
  overload sphingomyelin synthesis pathway and lead to the accumulation of ceramides,
  lipid signaling molecules also capable of induction of insulin resistance.
