caption: Drugs treat VaD through regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. The Nrf2/HO-1
  pathway plays an essential role in inhibiting the oxidative stress in the targets
  of treatment of VaD. In the case of oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from the
  Keap1-Nrf2 complex, transferred from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and binds to
  the AREs, promoting the expression of HO-1 and other antioxidant enzymes such as
  SOD, GSH, and CAT. These antioxidant substances could promote free radical scavenging
  and exert antioxidant and neuroprotective effects on VaD. Resveratrol, chitosan,
  DM and PNC could up-regulate the expression of Nrf2, initiating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway,
  thus inhibiting the oxidative damage and alleviating the cognitive deficits of VaD.
  ERK phosphorylation is the core pathway implicated in the activation of Nrf2. Edaravone
  could enhance the expression of ERK1/2 and then activate the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway,
  exerting neuroprotective effects on VaD.
