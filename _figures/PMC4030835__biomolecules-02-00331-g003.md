caption: Homeodomain interacting protein kinase (Hipk) SUMOylation may down-regulate
  c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Phosphorylation of JNK in the cytoplasm
  by Hipk may stimulate JNK pathway activity. SUMOylation of Hipk may interfere with
  JNK signaling by sequestering Hipk in the nucleus.
