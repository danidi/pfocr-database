caption: Comprehensive VCell modeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Because of the open
  nature of models in the VCell, original models can be simplified and/or adapted
  at the user’s discretion to investigate previously unstudied aspects of actin regulation
  without building a new model. These models can then be used in a variety of geometries,
  i.e., lamellipodia or dendritic spines, or with a variety of experimentally simulatable
  systems, i.e., CALI or FRAP. (A) In the original Actin Dendritic Nucleation model
  (), the actin cytoskeleton is regulated by the Arp2/3 complex, capping protein,
  cofilin, profilin, and thymosin-β4. (B) Building on the base model in (A), Kapustina
  and colleagues () added VASP regulation of capping protein and modeled the effects
  of CALI and FRAP on eGFP-capping protein-regulated actin dynamics. (C) Using an
  optimized version of the model, Ditlev and colleagues () created an upstream signaling
  module that activated Arp2/3 complex. With this reaction scheme, a previously unappreciated
  mechanism of the Nck/N-WASp/Arp2/3 complex pathway was elucidated.
