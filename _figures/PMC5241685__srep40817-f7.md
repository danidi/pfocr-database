caption: Blue light (BL) excites succinate dehydrogenase (complex II) in electron
  transport chain, which interacts with molecular oxygen to generate ROS. ROS inactivates
  ChrR, the anti-σE factor. Dissociated σE associates with core RNAP, and corresponding
  RNAP holoenzyme activates PσE, promoter of the regulatory ChrR-σE operon. σE regulates
  expression levels of 159 genes. Also, ROS interacts with MerR, and suppresses or
  enhances expression levels of 63 genes includes its own gene. Ovals depict protein
  factors, short arrows show genes or operons, solid arrows and blunt-ended lines
  indicate positive and negative regulation, respectively.
