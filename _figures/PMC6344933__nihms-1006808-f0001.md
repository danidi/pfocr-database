caption: Overview of the targeted multifunctional nanoparticle (tMFNP) chitosan glycerophosphate
  (CGP)-hydrogel delivery platform. The tMFNP comprises an outer phospholipid bilayer
  (containing a targeting ligand and a fluorescent dye for detection purposes), which
  encompasses encloses an aqueous core containing drugs and/or biomaterials. The liquid
  nanohydrogel containing tMFNP with a drug or biomaterial payload is applied into
  the round window niche of the inner ear. It transforms into a semi-solid gel attached
  to the round window membrane and releases the tMFNPs into the cochlea. The tMFNPs
  are then able to diffuse throughout the cochlea. As an example, we highlight the
  role of a MFNP possessing a targeting ligand which recognizes prestin, a transmembrane
  protein expressed exclusively in outer hair cells and carrying a payload of D JNKi
  1, a JNK pathway inhibitor. While we use this combination in our experiments, any
  drug or biomaterial can delivered to any targeted cells using this nanohydrogel
  platform.
