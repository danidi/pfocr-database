caption: Schematics of the retroviral replication cycle. This figure illustrates the
  pathway of a retrovirus during infection of a susceptible host cell. Note the processes
  of (1) viral attachment to a specific receptor, (2) viral entry, (3) viral reverse
  transcription, (4) nuclear entry of double-stranded viral DNA, (5) viral integration
  into host genome, (6) viral genomic replication, (7) viral packaging and (8) budding
  and exit. Note that the scalars and tensors in figure  act at any of these steps.
