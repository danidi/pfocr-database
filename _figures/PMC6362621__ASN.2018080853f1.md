caption: VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling pathways and their pharmacological inhibition occur
  across the glomerular filtration barrier. VEGFA is released from podocytes and binds
  to its receptor (VEGFR2) on glomerular endothelial cells. (i) Bevacizumab and ranibizumab
  are mAbs against VEGFA and inhibit angiogenesis through IgG antibody interaction
  with all of its isoforms. (ii) Aflibercept is a recombinant fusion protein comprising
  binding domains for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 attached to the Fc portion of human IgG1,
  and acts as a soluble decoy receptor or “VEGF trap.” (iii) Ramucirumab is a fully
  humanized IgG1 mAb that specifically inhibits VEGFR2 by targeting its extracellular
  domain. (iv) TKIs such as sunitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and axitinib target VEGFR2,
  as well as interfere with the activity of additional RTKs such as PDGF receptor,
  fibroblast growth factor receptor, and EGF receptor, which all share a similar structure.
  (v) Agents such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been recently developed to specifically
  target B-Raf, a component of the intracellular MAPK/ERK intracellular pathway. (vi)
  mTOR inhibitors such as temsirolimus, ridaforolimus, and everolimus are used across
  several malignancies and act downstream of the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT
  signal transduction pathway. Ab, antibody; BRAF, B-Raf Proto-Oncogene; EF, endothelial
  fenestrations; FP, foot process; GBM, glomerular basement membrane; GEnC, glomerular
  endothelial cell; P, Podocyte.
