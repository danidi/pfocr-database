caption: RGS6 in central nervous system diseases. Schematic outlining the role of
  RGS6 in alcoholism (a), anxiety and depression (b), and Parkinson’s disease (c).
  Red indicates neurons projecting from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the meso-limbo-cortical
  pathway. Green indicates neurons projecting from the raphe nucleus (RN). Blue represents
  neurons projecting from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in the nigro-striatal
  pathway. a It is believed that RGS6 acts as a critical mediator of alcohol-seeking
  behaviors by inhibiting GABABR signaling which normally promotes upregulation of
  the dopamine transporter (DAT) and inhibits vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2)
  and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Conversely, removal of RGS6, which is normally upregulated
  in the VTA following alcohol consumption, may ameliorate alcohol reward and withdrawal
  by promoting GABABR signaling decreasing dopamine (DA) bioavailability. b RGS6 promotes
  anxiety and depression by inhibiting the 5-HT1A heteroreceptors in cortical and
  hippocampal neurons that synapse with serotonergic neurons of the RN. By blocking
  5-HT1A heteroreceptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC), RGS6 promotes
  the accumulation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the subsequent activation of protein kinase
  A (PKA) and cAMP responsive element-binding protein (CREB), all of which contribute
  to anxiety and depression and counteract the actions of antidepressant/anxiolytic
  medications. c RGS6 may also mediate the survival of dopaminergic SNc neurons by
  inhibiting dopamine receptor (D2R) signaling in these neurons. By acting as a gatekeeper
  of D2R signaling, RGS6 is believed to assure not only normal synaptic release of
  DA but may also prevent the accumulation of cytotoxic DA byproducts that could contribute
  to neuronal degeneration. PFC prefrontal cortex, STR striatum, NAc nucleus accumbens,
