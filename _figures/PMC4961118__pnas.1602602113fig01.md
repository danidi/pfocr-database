caption: Quantification of the input-response function of LAT:Grb2:SOS assembly in
  TCR signaling. Schematic of TCR signaling pathway (Top) and the in vitro-reconstituted
  system (Bottom). Engagement of TCR with pMHC results in phosphorylation of LAT,
  which triggers assembly reaction on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane.
  LAT assembly promotes SOS membrane recruitment and activation, which propagates
  downstream signals. To quantitatively assess the input-response function at the
  LAT signaling node, the signaling geometry of LAT is reconstituted on supported
  membranes. Phosphorylation of LAT is triggered by membrane-bound tyrosine kinase
  Hck, which results in Grb2 recruitment. The assembly reaction is initiated by the
  addition of SOS proline-rich domain and can be reversed by tyrosine phosphatase,
  YopH.
