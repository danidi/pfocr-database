caption: Model of Gαi-mediated activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway in response
  to EGF. EGF induces formation of a complex between EGFR, Gαi, and Gab1. Recruitment
  of Gαi to the receptor may occur directly or through an as yet unidentified protein.
  Subsequently, Gαi interacts with Gab1, which promotes its phosphorylation by the
  EGFR or a non-RTK. Activated Gab1 interacts with the regulatory subunit of PI3K
  (p85), which leads to the activation of the catalytic subunits of PI3K (p110). Active
  PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate PIP3
  (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), which in turn interacts with the pleckstrin
  homology domain of Akt and PDK1, and PDK1 phosphorylates Akt on Thr308. Activated
  Gab1 uses an unidentified mechanism to trigger the activation of mTORC2, which leads
  to the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473. When Akt is activated, it phosphorylates
  FOXO, GSK-3α, and GSK-3β and triggers the activation of mTORC1, which results in
  phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K, which in turn phosphorylates S6.
