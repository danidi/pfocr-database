caption: Plasma ADMA level is controlled by DDAH. In CKD, ADMA level is elevated which
  stops the production of CAMKII (via MAPK pathway), eNOS and NO. Elevated levels
  of ADMA inhibit Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and therefore impair endothelial function
  and thus promote kidney impairment. MAPK (Mitogen activated protein kinase); DDAH
  (NG, NG-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase); PRMT (protein methyltransferase);
  eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase).
