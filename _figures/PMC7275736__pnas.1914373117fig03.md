caption: Functional analyses of clustered genes in Scaffold38. (A) The products and
  corresponding genes involved are indicated in the putative biosynthetic pathway
  of momilactones in C. plumiforme. Hypothetical intermediates are also shown in parentheses.
  (B, Upper) Momilactone A [6] converted from the substrate 3β-hydroxy-9βH-pimara-7,15-dien-19,6β-olide
  [5] by His-CpMAS protein is analyzed by LC-MS/MS. (Top) His-CpMAS products; (Middle)
  negative control without enzyme; (Bottom) authentic standards. (B, Lower) Product
  ion spectra of authentic momilactone A [6] and His-CpMAS product. (C) Mass chromatogram
  (scanned on m/z 316) of the reaction product (methyl ester derivative) obtained
  using GC-MS after incubation of syn-pimaradiene [2] with CpCYP970A14 (unigene16484),
  and OsCYP99A3. The mass spectra of the peaks on GC at 7.65 min are shown (Right).
  (D) Mass chromatogram (scanned on m/z 288) of the reaction product obtained using
  GC-MS after incubation of syn-pimaradiene [2] with CpCYP964A1 (Unigene12783). The
  mass spectra of the peaks on GC are shown (Right). (E) GC-MS mass chromatogram (scanned
  on m/z 272) of 9β-pimara-7,15-diene [2] produced by N. benthamiana in planta reaction.
  The mass spectra of the peaks on GC at 7.65 min are shown (Right). (F) Mass chromatograms
  and spectra of the reaction products from N. benthamiana leaves coexpressed CpDTC1/HpDTC1,
  CpCYP970A14, and CpCYP964A1. (G) LC-MS/MS analysis of the reaction products from
  N. benthamiana leaves coexpressed CpDTC1/HpDTC1, CpCYP970A14, and CpCYP964A1. The
  product ion spectra of the peak2 and authentic 3OH-pimaradienolide [5] are shown
  (Right). (H) Enhanced production of momilactone A in the N. benthamiana leaves coexpressed
  CpDTC1/HpDTC1, CpCYP970A14, CpCYP964A1 with or without CpMAS. The relative amount
  of momilactone A to 3OH-pimaradienolide are shown. The data represent the mean ±
  SE of three biological replicates of independently agroinfiltrated N. benthamiana
  leaves.
