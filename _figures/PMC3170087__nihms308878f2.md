caption: (A). Poly(I:C) promotes CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity through the production
  of IFN-I and other cytokines. Poly(I:C)-mediated IFN-I responses are dependent on
  stromal expression of MDA5. However, adjuvant effects of poly(I:C) on CD4+ T cell
  immunity require MDA5 expression in both hematopoietic and stromal compartments.
  Poly(I:C) triggers the TLR3 pathway in CD8α+ DCs to promote cross-presentation to
  CD8+ T cells while signaling through MDA5 pathway in stromal cells promotes CD8+
  T cell survival and memory formation. (B). Poly(I:C) promotes NK cell activation
  through the production of IFN-I and IL-12. NK cell activation via IFN-I depends
  on MDA5-expressing radio-resistant stromal cells while TLR3+ hematopoietic cells
  promote NK cell activation through IL-12 secretion. The MDA5 pathway plays a dominant
  role in NK cell responses to poly(I:C) while the TLR3 pathway has a secondary effect.
