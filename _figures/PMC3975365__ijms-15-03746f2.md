caption: 'The tumor’s interaction with its solid microenvironment. Three of the five
  common forms of adhesions are depicted here and their role in cell death prevention
  is highlighted (expanded from []): (1) Gap junctions, aqueous channels consisting
  of connexins, through which ions and small molecules can be exchanged between adjacent
  cells. Generally, they are considered more in terms of cell-cell communication rather
  than cell-cell adhesion, however, we previously showed both that gap junctions contribute
  to glioblastoma cell-cell adhesion and, by diluting the apoptotic signal, reduce
  cell death []; (2) Adherens junctions are not only contacts between cells, but also
  anchorage points to the cytoskeleton. They consist of plasma membrane spanning cadherins
  and adjacent cadherin interactions on the plasma membrane lead to the formation
  of a zipper-like structure which provides a strong adhesive link between cells.
  In addition, components of the adherens junctions not only mediate cell-cell adhesions,
  but are also involved in the regulation of signaling cascades, in particular the
  Wnt pathway; (3) Focal adhesions are links between the extracellular matrix and
  the actin cytoskeleton. Their dynamic regulation plays an important role in cell
  motility, while there are also sites of origin for (a) intracellular survival signals
  and (b) extracellular cues for microenvironment remodeling. As example, we show
  in detail two survival pathways that are activated by adherens junctions and focal
  adhesions, the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and the PI3-K/Akt signaling cascade (see ). Note
  that (−) indicates reduced, while (+) stands for increased protein activity. Not
  shown are desmosomes, which act as tethering points for intermediate filaments,
  and tight junctions, which form a boundary between apical and basal domains of the
  plasma membrane. While the former are usually exclusively discussed in terms of
  reduced expression during metastasis [], the role of tight junctions is more controversial,
  as its components either found to be up- or down-regulated in cancers []. Of note,
  PTEN, the negative regulator of PI3-K/Akt signaling also regulates tight junctions
  [].'
