caption: Nutrient deprivation and organelle damage trigger macro-autophagy in cardiac
  myocytes (reviewed in ()). Assembly of the phagophore (the initiation of the double
  membrane) is activated by class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PtdIns3K) catalyzed
  generation of phosphatydil inositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) to recruit PtdIns3P-binding
  proteins. A protein complex is formed comprised of Vps15 homolog phosphoinositide-3-kinase,
  regulatory subunit 4 (PIK3R4), the Vps34 homolog phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase,
  catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3), and the Vps30/Atg6 homolog Beclin 1. This interacts
  with AMBRA1 (not shown) and ATG14, and also contain the BECN1-interacting protein
  UV radiation resistance associated (UVRAG, not shown) and SH3-domain GRB2-like endophilin
  B1 (SH3GLB1/Bif-1, not shown) to promote autophagosome formation. Autophagosome
  formation has been shown to be initiated at multiple sites including the mitochondria-associated
  membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, the ER-golgi interface and the plasma membrane.
  PtdIns3P at the ER triggers the recruitment of the PtdIns3P-binding protein ZFYVE1/DFCP1
  (zinc finger, FYVE domain containing 1) protein and WD repeat domain, phosphoinositide
  interacting 2 protein (WIPI2) to from a PtdIns3P-enriched ER-associated structure
  termed the omegasome for its Ω-like shape. Elongation and expansion of the phagophore
  membrane takes place by the Atg12–Atg5-Atg16 and Atg8 conjugation systems, which
  are ubiquitin like conjugation systems. The Atg12–Atg5-Atg16 complex catalyzes the
  lipidation of Atg8 by Atg4-mediated cleavage followed by covalent linkage to phosphatidylethanolamine.
  Mammalian Atg8 homologs, namely, the microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain
  3 (MAP1LC3/LC3) and GABA (A) receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) subfamily proteins
  are involved in membrane expansion and also interact with adaptor proteins that
  bind ubiquitinated proteins (as cargo) to sequester them within the autophagosomes.
  Adaptor proteins such as p62, NBR1, NDP52, VCP and optineurin interact with ubiquitinated
  proteins through a ubiquitin-binding domain (UBA) and with LC3 family of proteins
  via a LC3-interacting region (LIR). After closure of the double membrane, autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion occurs in a manner dependent upon lysosomal pH (requires acidified lysosomes)
  and regulated by Rab7, SNARE and HOPS complex proteins. This is followed by intralysosomal
  degradation of autophagosome contents with recycling of basic building blocks back
  to the cytosol, completing the process of autophagy. Lysosomes harbor the LYNUS
  complex on their cytosolic face, which is comprised of mTOR complexed with the lysosomal
  proton pump, Ragulator, Rag GTPases, GAP (GTPase activating) and GEF (GTP exchange
  factor) proteins and Rheb GTPase. The LYNUS complex activates mTOR during the nutrient
  replete state which phosphorylates the TFEB family of transcription factors (reviewed
  in (, )). Phosphorylated TFEB on lysosome membrane exists in equilibrium with a
  pool that is bound to cytosolic 14–3-3 proteins. Activated mTOR inactivates autophagy
  via phosphorylation of ULK1 and ATG13. Nutrient depletion induces the LYNUS complex
  to unravel, whereby mTOR becomes inactive relieving the constitutive phosphorylation
  of TFEB. Simultaneously, release of lysosome calcium via activation of the mucolipin
  channel activates calcineurin, which dephosphorylates TFEB to unmask its nuclear
  nuclear localization signal. Nuclear TFEB activates transcription of autophagy and
  lysosome genes, and induces autophagosome formation and lysosome biogenesis to upregulate
  flux through the macro-autophagy pathway. These lysosomal degradative processes
  generate nutrients that provide energy and support various metabolic functions (reviewed
  in ()), and destroy invading organisms in immune cells via the process of xenophagy
  and enable antigen presentation to mount an immune response (reviewed in ().
