caption: Innate immune recognition of Chlamydia. Chlamydial infection can be recognized
  by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NLRs,
  and cGAS, which elicit strong host innate immune responses and the release of several
  pro-inflammatory cytokines. TLR1/2 and TLR2/6 recognize chlamydial lipopeptide/lipoprotein,
  and TLR4 recognizes chlamydial LPS and HSP60. Upon binding of cognate ligands, the
  MyD88-dependent pathway, which is common to all TLR signaling (with the exception
  of TLR3) is immediately activated. Whether TLR3 is involved in the recognition of
  chlamydial infection remains to be elucidated. The chlamydial peptidoglycan binds
  to the NLRs and induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines via nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) or activator protein 1 (AP-1) signaling. The stimulation of cGAS
  by Chlamydia spp. DNA leads to the dimerization and activation of IRF3, which then
  translocates into the nucleus and promotes the transcription of type I IFN and IFN-inducible
  genes. Chlamydial components also bind to the ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2), which
  in turn triggers the activation of PI3K-downstream signaling, favoring the proliferation
  and survival of Chlamydia.
