caption: '(A) Extracellular space: Gal-3 either binds to the ECM compounds (laminin,
  hensin, elastin, collagen IV, tenascin-C and -R, and integrin) to modulate cell
  adhesion, or interacts with plasmatic membrane receptors by binding to carbohydrate
  moieties in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to form membrane lattices and trigger
  intracellular events. Intracellular space: within the cell, Gal-3 is found in both
  cytoplasm and nucleus, and its binding appears to be mediated by protein-protein
  interactions. In the cytoplasm, it plays an anti-apoptotic role (Bcl-2), and modulates
  signaling pathways (Akt and in Erk 1/2) to promote or inhibit cell growth, proliferation
  and differentiation. In the nucleus, Gal-3 is crucial for pre-mRNA splicing (spliceosome
  incorporation) and to promote or repress transcription. Internalization and secretion:
  Gal-3 enters the cell by non-clathrin-mediated endocytosis and goes through endosomal
  organelles to be later sorted elsewhere or degraded. Gal-3 is secreted via a non-classical
  pathway and apparently through exosomes. (B) Regulation: Gal-3 activity is regulated
  by MMP2 and MMP9 cleavage (Ala62 to Tyr63), generating a 22 kDa whole CRD peptide
  (high affinity for carbohydrates) and a 9 kDa N-terminal peptide (oligomerization
  capacity). Also, Gal-3 is phosphorylated in Tyr residues by c-Abl kinase to promote
  its own degradation in lysosomes in Ser residues by casein kinase I to reduce its
  carbohydrate binding capacity, and by GSK3-β to regulate the Wnt-β-catenin pathway.'
