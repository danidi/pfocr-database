caption: Proposed mechanism for exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis via NAD+/NADH
  metabolism. PARP, poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase; SIRT, sirtuin; GCN5, general control
  of amino acid synthesis; PGC1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator
  1α; CtBP, COOH-terminal binding protein. Increased ATP demand during exercise leads
  to an increase in the free cytosolic/nuclear and mitochondrial NAD+ level and NAD+/NADH
  ratio, which provides increased substrate for the NAD+-consuming enzymes (in purple),
  SIRT1, SIRT3, PARP1, and PARP2. Exercise also reduces the availability of NADH,
  the predominant covalent activator of CtBP. It is hypothesized that during exercise
  increased ATP production is facilitated by SIRT3-mediated deacetylation of a series
  of enzymes in the TCA cycle, β-oxidation, and ETC. In parallel, SIRT3 acutely reduces
  mitochondrial protein synthesis, which maximizes the availability of reducing equivalents
  for ATP production. Whether SIRT3 is required for induction of mitochondrial biogenesis
  after exercise remains to be determined. In response to exercise, SIRT1 is also
  activated by increased cytosolic/nuclear NAD+ levels, and while it likely can contribute
  to mitochondrial biogenesis through PGC1α-dependent and -independent mechanisms,
  it is not required for exercise-mediated deacetylation of PGC1α. Rather, acute exercise
  appears to reduce the inhibitory effect of the acetyltransferase GCN5 on PGC1α,
  via a mechanism that is still to be determined. PARP1 and PARP2 are able to directly
  or indirectly modulate SIRT1 activity (and mitochondrial biogenesis) by competing
  for NAD+, although the effects of exercise on the activity of these enzymes is unknown.
  Also, whether SIRT1 is required for the ability of PARP inhibition to induce mitochondrial
  biogenesis in skeletal muscle in vivo is not known. The transcriptional corepressor
  CtBP is activated by NADH, and it is hypothesized that during or after exercise,
  reductions in the cytosolic/nuclear NADH level reduces the repressive effects of
  CtBP on transcriptional modulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. Ultimately, increased
  activity of enzymes of the ETC, TCA cycle, and β-oxidation and/or increased mitochondrial
  number (i.e., biogenesis) leads to an enhanced capacity of mitochondria and muscle
  to generate ATP. Dotted lines indicate a hypothesized contribution of the pathway
  or that the data to date provides an incomplete perspective.
