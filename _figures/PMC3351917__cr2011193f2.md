caption: Calcineurin reverses negative feedback on B-Raf to permit ERK1/2 activation
  by nutrients in pancreatic β cells. Once activated, ERK1/2 can phosphorylate multiple
  upstream components in the pathway. In β cells, in response to nutrients ERK1/2
  phosphorylate B-Raf preventing its continued stimulation of MEK1/2. B-Raf is required
  for the activation of ERK1/2 by nutrients. The calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin
  can dephosphorylate a key inhibitory site on B-Raf, allowing continued ERK1/2 activation.
