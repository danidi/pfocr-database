caption: (A,B) Scanning electron micrograph of a wild type (A) or GMR-upd (B) adult
  eye. Note the dramatic overgrowth in B.(C) Model of regulation of JAK/STAT pathway
  signaling in the developing eye imaginal disc. Notch signaling (Nact) induces upd
  in cells at the posterior midline (blue area). Upd activates Dome and Stat92E (labelled
  STATP) in adjacent cells. PRC1 normally repress upd expression, while JNK signaling
  can induce it. ESCRT components normally restrict Notch and Dome activity, while
  Csk represses Stat92E activity. In addition, early in eye development, Upd can act
  upstream of Notch and induce Notch activity at the midline (green arrow). Activated
  Stat92E (STATP) also restricts Notch activity by repressing expression of Ser, which
  encodes a Notch ligand.(D) Model of regulation of JAK/STAT pathway signaling by
  ESCRT components. Active Notch (magenta) and Dome (brown) receptors are trafficked
  into endosomes, where they can induce target genes like upd (green) and crb (blue),
  respectively. ESCRT factors promote the trafficking of Notch and Dome into the lysosome
  for degradation. In ESCRT mutants, Notch and Dome are trapped in an activated state
  in endosomes, where their unbridled activity causes cell cycle deregulation and
  transformation.(E) Model of metastatic tumors caused by gain of RasV12 and loss
  of scrib in the eye disc. In wild type epithelial cells (gray), Scrib repressed
  JNK activity. In a cell that has RasV12 and lacks scrib (yellow), JNK signaling
  is now activated and upd genes are ectopically expressed (green). The ectopic Upd
  protein (green) leads to autocrine and paracrine (not depicted) activation of Dome
  (brown) and Stat92E (blue). The autonomous collaboration of RasV12 and activated
  Stat92E causes neoplastic transformation and metastasis.
