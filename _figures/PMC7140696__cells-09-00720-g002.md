caption: 'Schematic representation of the mechanism of action displayed by ERAP2 ISO3
  and ISO4 in the antigen presentation pathway. (A). Following virus infection rs2248374-A
  ERAP2 expressing cells produce wild type ERAP2 (ERAP2-wt) which can homodimerize
  or heterodimerize with ERAP1-wt (ERAP2-wt+ERAP2-wt; ERAP1-wt+ERAP2-wt), in order
  to process viral antigens to be presented on cell surface for recognition by specific
  cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) clones. (B). Following virus infection rs2248374-G
  ERAP2 expressing cells may transcribe two alternative spliced isoforms: ERAP2-ISO3
  and ERAP2-ISO4. This two variants, unlike ERAP2-wt, lack the catalytic domain but
  can still heterodimerize with both ERAP2-wt and ERAP1-wt. As a result, these unconventional
  heterodimers (ISO3+ERAP2-wt; ISO3+ERAP1-wt; ISO4+ERAP2-wt; ISO4+ERAP1-wt) may process
  viral antigens differently from the canonical ones, generating an alternative antigenic
  repertoire. This in turn may activate other CTL clones and more broadly a more or
  less protective response by the immune system.'
