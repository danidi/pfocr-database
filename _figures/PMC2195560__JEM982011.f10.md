caption: Proposed developmental pathways of B cells in the spleen. The B cell subpopulations
  described in this paper are depicted as they would appear in a flow cytometric profile
  after staining with anti-IgM and anti-CD21 Abs. T1 B cells recently immigrated from
  the bone marrow develop into T2 B cells if they receive a BCR-mediated signal. This
  signal is insufficient in Ig-α– and Syk-deficient mice. Progression of T2 B cells
  into the mature long-lived pool (M) is blocked in mice with qualitative and quantitative
  defects in BCR signaling function, as in Btk-, Vav-, Lyn-, and CD45−/− mice, and
  in transgenic mice with a dominant-negative form of MEK (DN-MEK), which is only
  expressed in B cells. MZ B cells are thought to derive from mature B cells but are
  also found in mice with a developmental arrest at the T2 stage, leaving open the
  possibility that they can also be derived from T2 B cells. It is presently unclear
  whether T1 B cells can directly differentiate into mature cells in the spleen. Solid
  arrows, major pathways; broken arrows, possible pathways; ⊥, pathway blocked; *inferred
  from the literature; **our unpublished data.
