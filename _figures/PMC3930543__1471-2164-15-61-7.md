number: Figure 7
caption: 'A proposed model of BR-, auxin-, and HD-ZipIII genes-dependent pathways
  for gynoecium development. All genes displayed in this figure correspond to DEGs
  in this study, other related genes without difference are not showed here. Genes
  with green color are down-regulated and those with red color are up-regulated in
  S1 pistils. Different colors of rectangle represent different pathway or factors,
  purple: BRs synthesis and metabolism, dark blue: polar auxin transport, light blue:
  HD-ZipIII genes, deep yellow: other related genes. Arrows and bars indicate positive
  and negative regulatory interactions, respectively. BRs: Brassinosteroids. This
  figure also includes the information from other sources [,,].'
