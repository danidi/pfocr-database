caption: Schematic diagrams indicate repartitioning of tryptophan metabolic pathways
  in hypertension (HTN) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on the available literature
  data. The three major tryptophan metabolic pathways are kynurenine (yellow), serotonin
  (blue), and indole (purple) pathways. They are tightly interconnected to maintain
  good health and differentially affected in diseases. Weights of arrow lines indicate
  strength of pathway activation. The restoration of impaired tryptophan metabolic
  pathways using tryptophan supplementation, melatonin, or aryl hydrocarbon receptor
  (AhR) antagonist represents a promising reprogramming strategy.
