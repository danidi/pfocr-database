caption: Schematic diagram of PTP1B in IFN-γ-induced neuroinflammation and 6-OHDA-induced
  neuronal death. IFN-γ could increase PTP1B expression and further modulate downstream
  cascade, including the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as iNOS,
  COX-2, and NF-κB. Treatment of 6-OHDA could also affect PTP1B and its downstream
  neuroprotection-related pathway, including the downregulation of p-CREB, GRP-78,
  and BDNF and upregulation of p-eIF2. Our study revealed that the PTP1B inhibition
  by suramin could reverse IFN-γ-induced upregulation of iNOS and COX-2 protein expression.
  Moreover, suramin could modulate M2 type microglia-related protein and increase
  arginase-1 and Ym-1 protein expression. PTP1B inhibition also reversed the 6-OHDA-induced
  downregulation of p-CREB and BDNF protein expression. In the anti-ER stress section,
  suramin further enhanced 6-OHDA-induced upregulation of p-eIF2 expression and reversed
  6-OHDA-induced downregulation of GRP-78 expression. The effect of suramin significantly
  protected dopamine neurons against damage.
