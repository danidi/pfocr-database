caption: Hedgehog signalling and SMO inhibitors action in MB. a. Hedgehog (Hh) proteins
  (Sonic, Indian, or Desert Hedgehog) bind to PTCH1 transmembrane protein. Binding
  to PTCH1 relieves inhibition of smoothened (SMO). Active SMO moves to cilium and
  promotes to release suppressor of fused (SUFU) inhibition of glioma-associated oncogene
  (GLI) proteins. Activated GLI proteins then translocate to the nucleus to affect
  transcription of SHH target genes (ie, GLI1, GLI2, PTCH1, PTCH2, and MYCN). Vismodegib
  and sonidegib bind to the extracellular domain of SMO, inhibiting downstream signalling.
  Most commonly mutations in MB associated with Hh pathway includes, mutations in
  PTCH1 (red star, favourable prognostic mutation), SMO and SUFU (brown star, worse
  prognostic mutations). b. SMO inhibitors inhibit Hh pathway signalling by preventing
  activation of SMO
