caption: Distinct types of apoptosis-induced proliferation in Drosophila. (A) The
  effector caspase-independent pathway. Induction of apoptosis in the presence of
  P35 produces undead cells because of effector caspase inhibition. The initiator
  caspase Dronc remains active in undead cells and stimulates the Jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) pathway. JNK together with Drosophila p53 (dp53) induces expression of the
  IAP antagonist Hid, establishing a positive feedback loop of apoptosis amplification.
  JNK and dp53 also stimulate the expression of the mitogens Wg and Dpp that promote
  neighboring cells to undergo compensatory proliferation. This mechanism leads to
  hyperplastic overgrowth shown in . Question marks denote points of uncertainty.
  (B) The effector caspase-dependent pathway. Expression of the IAP antagonist Hid
  in the postmitotic, differentiating field of the eye retina induces apoptosis. However,
  dying photoreceptor neurons are able to induce expression of the mitogen Hedgehog
  (Hh), which stimulates neighboring cells that are postmitotic, but have not initiated
  a differentiation program (uncommitted) to reenter the cell cycle and undergo compensatory
  proliferation. This pathway is mediated by the effector caspases DrICE and Dcp-1.
  Expression of P35 does block this type of apoptosis-induced proliferation. Question
