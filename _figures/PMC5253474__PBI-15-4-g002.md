caption: The regulatory roles of protein phosphorylation and ubiquitination in ABA
  signalling. (a) Post‐translational regulation of PYR/PYL ABA receptors, PP2Cs and
  PP2As phosphatases, SnRK2s and CIPK26 protein kinases in ABA signalling. DDA1 and
  RSL1, Cul4‐based and RING‐type E3 Ub ligases, are able to target PYR/PYL ABA receptors
  for degradation by the Ub‐mediated 26S proteasome pathway. Two U‐box E3 ligases
  (e.g. PUB12 and PUB13) and two RING E3 ligases (e.g. RGLG1 and RGLG5) target PP2Cs
  for degradation by the Ub‐mediated 26S proteasome pathway. Similar to the functions
  of PP2Cs, PP2AAs and PP2ABs regulatory subunits in PP2A complexes are negatively
  involved in ABA signalling. CHIP, a U‐box E3 ligase, uses it monoubiquitination
  activity to control the expression of RCN1 and PP2AA3 regulatory subunits in PP2A
  complexes. SnRK2s are able to be phosphorylated and activated by themselves, or
  by BIN2 or ARK to activate downstream ABA signalling. In contrast, OST1, a SnRK2
  kinase involved in ABA signalling, is phosphorylated and inactivated by CK2 kinase
  to block downstream ABA signalling. CIPK26, a novel protein kinase, interacts with
  PP2Cs in the absence of ABA and phosphorylates downstream transcription factors
  such as ABI5 to trigger ABA responses. KEG, a RING‐type E3 ligase, can target CIPK26
  for disruption. (b) Downstream transcription factors (e.g. ABI5, ABI3, ABFs and
  ATHB6) and ion channels are the substrates of SnRK2s or CIPK26, which are also the
  targets of E3 ligases. ABD1, DWA1 and DWA2, as Cul4‐based E3 ligases, interact with
  and ubiquitinate ABI5 for degradation by the 26 proteasome. RPN10, a core component
  of the 26S proteasome, targets ABI5 for degradation. In addition to targeting CIPK26
  for degradation, KEG can target several substrates for disruption, including ABI5,
  ABF1 and ABF3. The self‐ubiquitination of KEG is triggered by a high level of ABA,
  causing the degradation of KEG and releasing ABI5. SDIR1, a RING finger E3 ligase,
  targets SDIRIP1 for degradation to regulate ABI5. In addition, AIP2 and BPM6, RING‐type
  and CUL3‐based E3 ligases, interact with and phosphorylate ABI3 and ATHB6, respectively,
  causing their degradation. Black arrows represent promotion. Black T‐shaped bars
  represent repression. Dashed lines represent unconfirmed relationships. P, phosphate.
