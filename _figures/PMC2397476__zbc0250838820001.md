caption: Folate structure and compartmentation of the plant folate synthesis pathway.
  A, tetrahydrofolate, with the pABA moiety colored red. Other natural folates have
  one-carbon units attached to the N5 and/or N10 positions. A γ-linked polyglutamyl
  tail of up to about six residues is usually attached to the first glutamate. B,
  the currently accepted scheme of folate biosynthesis in plants, showing subcellular
  locations of biosynthetic steps and of pABA esterification (highlighted in rose)
  and hypothetical transport steps for pABA-Glc into the mitochondrion and vacuole
  tested in this study (dashed arrows). Note that polyglutamylation of folates also
  occurs in the cytosol and plastids. ADC, aminodeoxychorismate; DHF, dihydrofolate;
  DHM, dihydromonapterin; DHN, dihydroneopterin; DHP, dihydropteroate; HMDHP, hydroxymethyldihydropterin;
  -P, phosphate; -P2, pyrophosphate, -P3, triphosphate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; UDP-Glc,
  UDP-glucose.
