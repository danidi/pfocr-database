caption: The top scored network using the 57 genes identified as differentially expressed
  genes for the asdMO group (> 2-fold vs. ctrlMO) is “cancer, RNA post-transcriptional
  modification, reproductive system disease”, with 14 focus molecules and a score
  of 27. The color intensity indicates the genes up-regulated or down-regulated in
  asdMO are shown in red or green, respectively. The mean of log2 expression values
  compared with the ctrlMO group are described as logarithm scale.
