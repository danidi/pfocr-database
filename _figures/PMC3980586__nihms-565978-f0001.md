caption: '(A) Chromatin-dependent gene regulation: SIRT7 deacetylates H3K18 to promote
  formation of transcriptionally repressive chromatin at specific gene promoters.
  SIRT7 represses expression of an ELK4-dependent tumor suppressive gene network,
  leading to stabilization of the transformed phenotype of cancer cells. SIRT7 also
  represses Myc-dependent ribosomal protein genes, which alleviates ER stress and
  prevents fatty liver disease. In cancer cells, SIRT7 opposes Myc function in ER
  stress-induced apoptosis, allowing cancer cell survival and proliferation. SIRT7
  might also impact on cancer cell phenotypes and tumorigenicity by regulating other
  functions of Myc in cancer cells. (B) Ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis:
  SIRT7 is implicated in multiple pathways that ultimately promote ribosome biogenesis
  and increased protein translation. At rDNA, SIRT7 deacetylates the PAF53 subunit
  of RNA Polymerase I to activate rRNA transcription, the rate-limiting step in ribosome
  biogenesis. SIRT7 also interacts with TFIIIC2 and mTOR, factors that promote tRNA
  transcription and protein synthesis. SIRT7 also interacts with ribosomal protein
  subunits, and might directly regulate ribosome function through such interactions.
  High levels of ribosome biogenesis fuels cancer cell proliferation and survival.
  (C) p53-p21 signaling: SIRT7 is implicated in repressing the tumor suppressive p53-p21
  pathway, with potential effects on cancer cell proliferation and survival. The molecular
  mechanisms are still unclear, but might involve effects on p53 acetylation or nucleolar
  dysfunction. Question marks indicate connections that are predicted but not yet
  demonstrated experimentally.'
