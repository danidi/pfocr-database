caption: The substrates of the reaction catalyzed by PHD1 are in bold. AGP, ADP-glucose
  pyrophosphorylase; SS and GBSS, starch synthases; UGP, UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase;
  CyUGE, cytosolic UDP-Glucose 4-epimerase; SPS, sucrose phosphate synthase; SPP,
  sucrose phosphate phosphatase; SuSy, sucrose synthase; Glc-1-P, glucose-1-phosphate;
  Pi, inorganic phosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate; ATP, adenosine-triphosphate. Intermediates
  linked by a single reaction are represented by an unbroken line.
