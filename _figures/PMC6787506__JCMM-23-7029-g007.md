caption: Hoxa5 alleviates obesity‐induced chronic inflammation by co‐ordinating adipocyte
  ER stress and polarization of M2 macrophages in mouse adipose tissue. Hoxa5 alleviates
  ER stress and inflammatory responses by inhibiting the eIF2α/PERK signalling pathway
  in adipocytes. Hoxa5 transcriptionally activates the PPARγ pathway to promote polarization
  of M2 macrophages, which in turn alleviates chronic inflammation of adipocytes
