caption: Proposed model of the inhibitory effect of Ang-(1–7) during P. falciparum
  invasion of human erythrocytes. 1, Ang II is converted to Ang-(1–7) by ACE 2 activity;
  2, Ang-(1–7) binds its specific receptor; Mas, which is expressed in the human erythrocyte
  membrane; 3, a signaling pathway is triggered inhibiting PKA activity; 4, decreased
  PKA activity impairs merozoite invasion in the erythrocytes.
