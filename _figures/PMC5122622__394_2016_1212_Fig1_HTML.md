caption: Multiple signaling pathways underlying hyperglycemic cellular damage. As
  diagrammed, diabetic cellular complications may arise from prolonged exposure to
  high glucose levels via the intracellular formation of advanced glycation end-products
  (AGEs), the cognate receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), and activation
  of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Additional signaling mechanisms involved
  in the induction of hyperglycemia-induced diabetic complications include aberrant
  phosphorylation events selectively mediated by protein kinase C isoforms and increased
  flux through the aldose reductase or polyol pathway. A unifying mechanism of diabetic
  pathophysiology involves hyperglycemia-driven mitochondrial dysfunction and the
  production of high levels of ROS in the form of superoxide
