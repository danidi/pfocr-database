caption: 'Pathways underlying the absorption of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen
  and its delivery to the liver. High dietary cholesterol delivery through the chylomicron
  pathway could provide an important source of excess cholesterol molecules for hepatic
  secretion into bile, thereby inducing cholesterol-supersaturated bile and enhancing
  cholesterol gallstone formation. Ezetimibe significantly suppresses cholesterol
  absorption from the small intestine via the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) pathway,
  possibly by a transporter-facilitated mechanism. This effect of ezetimibe could
  significantly diminish the cholesterol content of the liver, which in turn remarkably
  decreases bioavailability of cholesterol for hepatic secretion into bile. ABCG5/G8:
  ATP-binding cassette (transporters) G5 and G8; ACAT2: acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase
  isoform 2; APO-B48: apolipoprotein B48; MTTP: microsomal triglyceride transfer protein.
