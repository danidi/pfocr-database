caption: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in model fungi.
  At the uppermost left side, a schematic view of a MAPK pathway with the components
  of the MAPK module in blue and the MAP kinase phosphatase (MKP) in red. On the right
  side (head level), the major MAPK pathways described in fungi, Cell Wall Integrity
  (CWI), mating/filamentous growth and High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG), and the stimuli
  that trigger their activation. The equivalent MAPK pathways are shown for the budding
  yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (A), the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe
  (B), and the dimorphic yeast Candida albicans (C). The same code of colors is shown
  in all cases, as indicated above.
