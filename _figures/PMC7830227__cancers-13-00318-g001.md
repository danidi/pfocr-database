caption: The Hippo signaling pathway in mammalian cells. Only regulators that have
  been implicated in drug resistance are shown. MST1/2, SAV1, LATS1/2, MOB1, YAP and
  TAZ compromise the core kinase cascade of the Hippo signaling pathway in mammalian
  cells. Activated MST1/2-SAV1 complex phosphorylates and activates LATS1/2-MOB1 complex,
  then the latter phosphorylates YAP/TAZ, leading to their cytoplasmic retention and
  ubiquitination-mediated degradation in proteasome. The activity of this kinase cascade
  is regulated by a variety of molecules at multiple levels. KIBRA, hEx and Merlin
  are upstream regulators that promote the activity of the kinase cascade. The activity
  of Merlin is regulated by MYPT1-PP1δ phosphatase, which dephosphorylates Merlin
  and activates it. RASSF family members (for example, RASSF1A and RASSF6) interact
  with MST1/2 and modulate its kinase activity. In contrast, Ajuba acts as a negative
  regulator through inhibiting the kinase activity of LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ phosphorylation.
