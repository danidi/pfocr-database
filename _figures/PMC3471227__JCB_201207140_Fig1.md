caption: Hh pathway activation, inhibition, and mechanisms of drug resistance. (A)
  Diagram of inactive Hh pathway in vertebrates. (B) Hh ligand activates signaling
  by binding and inhibiting Ptch1, allowing Smo to suppress Sufu and activate Gli
  transcription factors to turn on Hh target genes. (C) Common pathway-dependent genetic
  mutations that lead to Hh-dependent tumors include Ptch1 inactivation, Smo activation,
  or inappropriate SHH expression. (D) Smo antagonists such as vismodegib suppress
  Hh activation to prevent tumor growth. (E) Genetic escape pathways that evolve during
  Smo antagonist treatment include Smo point mutations that prevent Smo–drug interaction
  or (F) Gli target gene amplification of Gli2 or Ccnd1. (G) Compensatory escape pathways
  that have evolved include inappropriate activation of S6K1 that prevents Sufu inhibition
  of Gli and (H) PI3K pathway up-regulation leading to inappropriate Gli activity
  through currently unknown mechanisms.
