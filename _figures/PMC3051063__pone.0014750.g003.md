caption: Based on the different functions of components in the pathway, the whole
  system can be divided into four sub-systems. Different sub-systems in the pathway
  are shown in different colors. Yellow represents the TNFα receptor sub-system, pink
  represents the IKK phosphorylation cascade sub-system, green represents the cytoplasmic
  IKK-IκB-NFκB sub-system, and blue represents the nuclear IκB-NFκB sub-system, respectively.
  All of the model parameters are also shown at the side of the corresponding reaction
  arrows, and the symbols are chosen based on the different meanings, for example,
  symbol ‘a’ means association or binding rate, ‘d’ means dissociation rate, ‘c’ means
  catalysis rate, and so on.
