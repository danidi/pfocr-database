caption: The regulatory network regarding the influence of reduced testosterone levels
  on lipid deposition in caponized chickens, which is based on significantly enriched
  KEGG pathwaysThis network is involved in the cellular functions of lipid metabolism
  (PPAR signaling pathway) and cell junctions.
