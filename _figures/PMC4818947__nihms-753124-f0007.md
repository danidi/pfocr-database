caption: MGMT directly repairs O6-MeG adducts. If unrepaired, O6-MeG preferably mispairs
  with T during DNA replication leading to G:C-to-A:T transitions. Alternatively,
  O6-MeG lesion induces apoptosis via an MMR-dependent pathway. O6-MeG/MMR-dependent
  DNA damage response includes multi-pathway, multi-time scale signaling network activation
  led by early ATM, H2AX, ATR-CHK1, and p53 phosphorylation, then followed by late
  phosphorylation of ATM-CHK2 and JNK kinase, as well as dramatic increases in p53
  levels and p53 transcriptional targets []. Sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and
  chromosomal aberrations are induced by O6-MeG lesions via an MMR-dependent pathway
  in the second cell cycle []. The gaps and nicks present during this phase can form
  DSB that are handled by HR. With loss of MMR, cells become “methylation-tolerant”
  accumulating mutations and escaping cell death in the presence of unrepaired O6-MeG.
