caption: Models for SUR-6 PP2A-B function in the vulval induction pathway. (A) SUR-6
  PP2A-B is likely to regulate the activity of a PP2A core complex composed of a C
  and A subunit to influence Ras signaling. SUR-6 PP2A-B is a positive regulator of
  Ras signaling, so SUR-6 could function either to activate the PP2A core, which in
  turn activates Ras signaling, or to inhibit the PP2A core that normally inhibits
  Ras signaling. Potential targets for SUR-6 PP2A-B-regulated PP2A activity include
  LIN-45 Raf and KSR-1. (B) Model for the signal transduction pathway regulated by
  SUR-6. The receptor tyrosine kinase LET-23 is activated by an inductive signal that
  leads to the activation of LET-60 Ras. Ras–GTP recruits Raf kinase to the membrane
  and Raf phosphorylates and activates the MEK-2 MEK/MPK-1 MAPK kinase cascade. We
  showed that SUR-6 PP2A-B positively regulates signaling at a branch point at the
  level of Ras or Raf. KSR-1 and SUR-6 may work together to strengthen Ras pathway
  output during vulval cell fate specification.
