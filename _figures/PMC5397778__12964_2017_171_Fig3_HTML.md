caption: Model of H. pylori interference with the SHH signaling pathway. a Infection
  with H. pylori induces a loss of SHH-expressing parietal cells (1). Loss of SHH
  might involve H. pylori-induced CDX2 expression, which then binds the SHH gene promoter
  leading to SHH downregulation (2) and to a dysfunction of parietal cells (8). Downregulation
  of SHH has also been associated with hypermethylation of the promoters of hedgehog
  signaling genes (3). The negative effect of H. pylori on SHH expression involves
  NF-κB activity (4) that induces the expression of cytokines to reduce SHH gene expression
  (5). On the other hand, SHH can be upregulated in response to calcium and PKC activity
  (11), which leads to the activation of GLI expression to enhance schlafen-4 (6)
  or increases H+/K+-ATPase gene expression (10). A positive effect of SHH on cytokine
  expression was observed (7), which could contribute to the NF-κB responses. H. pylori-induced
  proinflammatory cytokines further the dysfunction of parietal cells to inhibit gastric
  acid production (9), while an increased SHH expression promotes anti-apoptotic effect
  and proliferation (12). b H. pylori-increased SHH can function as a chemoattractant
  for macrophages and BM-MSCs. IFNγ-induced MSC proliferation required SHH secretion
  via an autocrine regulatory mechanism and appears to be involved in the repopulation
  of the inflamed tissue
