caption: Summary of key estrogen-dependent mechanisms in endometriosis. Pathologically
  decreased methylation of the SF1, GATA6, and ERβ genes causes extremely high levels
  of their proteins in endometriotic stromal cells. SF1 together with GATA6 coordinately
  mediate the PGE2-induced expression of many genes in the estrogen synthetic cascade
  to produce estradiol from cholesterol. In addition to decreased methylation of its
  gene promoter, ERβ expression is high also due to a stimulatory effect from GATA6.
  Estradiol and ERβ induce COX2 expression and PGE2 production in endometrial cells.
  Moreover, PGE2per se and IL-1β also induce COX2 expression and PGE2 production in
  endometrial cells. ERβ and GATA6 suppress ERα and PR, leading deficiencies of RA
  production and the HSD17B2 enzyme. The end result is extremely high local concentrations
  of estradiol and PGE2 in endometriotic tissue; both of these molecules are key inducers
  of inflammation and pain in endometriosis. This pathway is clinically relevant because
  its disruption by an aromatase inhibitor or a COX inhibitor (e.g., a nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drug) reduces the extent of disease or pelvic pain.
