caption: Two hypotheses for Gwl activation and mitotic entry. Two mechanisms of activation
  of Gwl have been proposed. The first one, represented in Hypothesis 1, involves
  the sole phosphorylation of the turn motif of Gwl by cyclin B-Cdk1 in a sequence
  that does not correspond to a cyclin B-Cdk1 consensus site. This phosphorylation
  would allow the complete activation of Gwl and the subsequent phosphorylation of
  Arpp19 even in the presence of high PP2A-B55 activity. Phosphorylation of Arpp19
  would result in PP2A-B55 inhibition and full phosphorylation of mitotic substrates.
  In Hypothesis 2, Gwl would be first activated by phosphorylation of this protein
  in 2 S/T-P sites of the T-loop by cyclin B-Cdk1 complex. This would promote the
  autophosphorylation of the turn motif site of the Gwl kinase and its complete activation.
  Activated Gwl would phosphorylate Arpp19 that would subsequently inhibit PP2A-B55.
  In this hypothesis, Gwl/Arpp19 would be localized far from PP2A-B55 to prevent dephosphorylation
  of the T-loop sites of Gwl and to permit the complete activation of this kinase.
  Colored circle represents a distinct cellular localization.
