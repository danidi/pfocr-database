caption: 'Simplified picture illustrating some examples of how microorganisms promote
  the cancer. Bacteroides fragilis can cause the induction of Th17-type immune response
  with upregulation of signal transducer and transcription-3. Moreover, some subtypes
  of Bacteroides fragilis can secrete the toxin EBTF that can cause cancer in different
  ways: (1) Through direct DNA damage; (2) By Treg cells, which in presence of EBTF,
  seem to promote cancer progression through Th17 expansion[]; and (3) Through the
  stimulation of the cleavage of E-cadherin which causes cellular proliferation and
  intestinal barrier breakage[]. Nonetheless, B. fragilis can promote an inflammatory
  response inducing the signaling NF-κB pathway[]. The particular group of polyketide
  synthase (pks) positive Escherichia coli (E. coli pks+) maintained a genomic island
  called “pks”. These bacteria can produce the genotoxin “colibactin”, that is able
  to induce direct DNA damage and, consequently, to increase the frequency of gene
  mutations[,]. Fusobacterium nucleatum can activate the β-catenin signal pathway
  causing cellular proliferation as consequence of the bindings between the bacterial
  adhesin FadA and E-cadherin which is located on the cells of the intestinal epithelium[].
  Furthermore, it is related to an increased production of some pro-cancer cytokines,
  such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-17. STAT3: Signal transducer and transcription-3;
