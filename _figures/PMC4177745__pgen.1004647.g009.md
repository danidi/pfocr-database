caption: (A) Expanded genetic circuitry of primarily translation regulators that fine-tunes
  the balance between proliferation and differentiation. A light grey box highlights
  pathway members that regulate differentiation onset. A dark grey box highlights
  redundant activities that promote GLD-1 expression, primarily when cells commit
  into meiotic progression (dashed line). See text for details. Note, this simplified
  circuitry focuses on the RNA regulatory network downstream of GLP-1/Notch and does
  neither include other known downstream RNA targets nor potential upstream protein
  regulators. (B) Diagram of translational control examples in proliferative germ
  cells. Next to glp-1 mRNA, GLD-4 may also translationally activate additional mRNAs,
  encoding proliferation-promoting genes. Additional FBF-regulated mRNAs are known
  that promote the meiotic program. See text for details. (C) Diagram of translational
  control examples in differentiating germ cells. Additional GLD-regulated mRNAs are
  known that promote the proliferative fate. See text for details.
