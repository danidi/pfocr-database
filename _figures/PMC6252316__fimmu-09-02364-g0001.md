caption: Predominant unresolved inflammation contributes in the development of chronic
  diseases related to particle exposure. The pathological pathway classically described
  suggests that a predominant and persistent inflammatory process (in green) orchestrates
  fibrosis, cancer, and autoimmune diseases caused by particles (in yellow). Reactive
  particles induce an inflammatory cascade, which implies TNF-α, IL-1 α, and β, IFNs
  (IFN-γ and β), IL-17, and free radicals (ROS and RNS) and precedes the influx of
  inflammatory macrophages (M1 Mϕ), inflammatory myeloid cells (iMono, inflammatory
  monocytes; iNeut, inflammatory neutrophils), and effector T lymphocytes (T eff,
  comprising Th1, γδ T cells, and Th17). When immunosuppressive activities are insufficient,
  these pro-inflammatory mediators and cells persist and result in to uncontrolled
  cycle of injury. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are also considered as potent polypeptide
  growth factors for mesenchymal cells and ultimately induce fibrosis. Sustained production
  of free radicals induces irreversible DNA damage and results in carcinogenesis.
  Constant tissue damage and inflammation activate adaptive immunity, autoantibody
  production and autoimmunity.
