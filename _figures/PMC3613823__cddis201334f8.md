caption: 'The proposed therapeutic mechanism of caspase-7 ablation in ADRP T17M RHO
  retinas. Upper: the expression of mutant T17M RHO protein in ADRP photoreceptors
  leads to the activation of the ER stress response (1, Kunte et al.), upregulation
  of mTOR, inhibition of pAkt and consequently upregulation of IRE1–JNK apoptosis
  (2, Kato et al. and  and ). In addition, the Hif1a protein () is upregulated, perhaps
  resulting in activation of the PERK pathway through translational regulation of
  ATF4 (3, Blais et al.), and TNFa is increased in T17M RHO retinas (). The activated
  ER stress response leads to recruitment of TRAF2 and consequently, upregulation
  of the cleaved caspase-12 protein (4, Yoneda et al. and  and ), which is known to
  precede caspase-7 cleavage during apoptosis. Bottom: caspase-7 ablation in photoreceptors
  expressing the T17M RHO protein leads to a reprogramming of the ER stress response
  and downregulation of apoptosis. Two ways for regulation of apoptosis are proposed.
  I: The first is associated with reprogramming UPR-induced gene and protein expression.
  Caspase-7 ablation mitigates ER stress response modulating the ER stress-induced
  gene and protein expression ( and ). This results in downregulation of mTOR and
  consequently, activated Akt protein ( and ). Activated AKT in turn inhibits the
  TRAF2-JNK apoptosis (). Independently, the downregulation of mTor could occur through
  inhibition of HIF1 (5, Wilson and Hay) that in turn could be downregulated either
  by caspase-7 ablation ( and ) or by PERK signaling (6, Papadakis et al.). II: Diminishing
  of TRAF2- JNK apoptosis could also result from the downregulation of TNFa and PARP1.
  Ablation of caspase-7 deactivates the PARP protein (7, Boucher et al. and ) that
  has been shown to reduce TNFa (8, Garcia et al. and ). TNFa has been demonstrated
  to reduce the JNK-dependent apoptosis through TNFTNFR1- TRADD-TRAF2-RIP-TAK1-IKK
  signaling (9, Jackson-Bernitsas et al. and )'
