caption: Model of anti-AC IgM-mediated suppression of TLR responses. IgM antibodies
  to determinants on ACs recognize and form complexes with ACs (or AC microparticles),
  which recruit high levels of C1q and MBL. This AC–immune complex forms an interaction
  with DCs that may involve integrins, receptors for C1q and MBL, and other AC receptors.
  In quiescent DCs, these complexes may result in little or no effects on MAPK signaling.
  However, in the context of stimulation by agonists for endosomal (TLR3, -7, and
  -9) or membrane-associated (TLR4) innate immune receptors, there is an integration
  of signals with those from NAb–MBL/C1q–AC complexes that result in high nuclear
  expression of the anti-inflammatory phosphatase MKP-1. This pathway contributes
  to inhibition of the activation and nuclear localization of the primary MAP kinases
  and their downstream proinflammatory substrates.
