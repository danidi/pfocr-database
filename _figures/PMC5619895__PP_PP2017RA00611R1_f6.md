caption: The proposed biosynthetic pathway of pungenol and the enzymatic activity
  of PgUGT5b. A, Proposed biosynthetic pathway of pungenol from caffeic acid based
  on feeding experiments with 14C-labeled precursors in spruce () and based on a predicted
  biosynthetic pathway for acetovanillone (). The gray arrows represent proposed enzyme-catalyzed
  reactions that remain to be confirmed. The enzyme activity of PgβGLU1 was described
  previously by . B, PgUGT5b utilizes pungenol, quercetin, and kaempferol as substrates.
  Pungenin appears to be the major product of PgUGT5b, as indicated by the thick black
  arrow. Isopungenin, quercetin glucosides, and kaempferol glucosides are additional
  products of PgUGT5b. The undulating line indicates that the exact position of glucosylation
  is not know for the quercetin glucosides or the kaempferol glucosides.
