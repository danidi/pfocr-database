caption: The links between infection, coagulation, and inflammation. Infection either
  directly triggers the activation of the intrinsic pathway through activation of
  factor XII or activates a series of toll-like receptors that can generate cytokines
  that initiate tissue factor expression. Coagulation leads to platelet activation,
  releasing CD40 ligand that amplifies inflammation, expression of P-selectin on cell
  surfaces which aids in leukocyte trafficking, and with ischemia reperfusion injury
  which leads to the release of HMGB 1 or histones that further trigger inflammation
  and tissue damage. The resultant amplified inflammatory response leads to additional
  tissue factor formation, thrombomodulin downregulation, complement activation, and
  leukocyte activation, further stimulating coagulation. Unchecked, this has the potential
  for devastating inflammatory and coagulation-mediated injury
