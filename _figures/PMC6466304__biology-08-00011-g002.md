caption: Diagram of major H4K20-related proteins and their proposed role in DNA double
  stranded break (DSB) repair. (A) Lysine methyl transferase (KMT) 5A, KMT5B, and
  KMT5C are the three main enzymes involved in the sequential mono, di, and tri-methylation
  of H4K20. Other potential H4K20 methyl transferases include the NSD gene family.
  Lysine demethylase 4A (KDM4A/JMJD2A), lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 neuronal
  isoform (LSD1n), plant homeodomain finger 8 (PHF8), and PHF2 are demethylases known
  to act on H4K20. Malignant brain tumor domain-containing proteins (MBTD1, L3MBTL1),
  Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 (FANCD2), and p53-bindng protein (TP53BP1,
  53BP1) are examples of readers of H4K20 methyl marks. Protein TP53BP1 is a checkpoint
  protein that binds H4K20me1/me2 and other histone modifications that occur in response
  to DNA damage to facilitate DSB repair via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). (B)
  The NHEJ pathway is the preferred method of repair during the G1-phase of the cell
  cycle [,]. DNA DSBs (red bolt) are recognized by the MRN complex (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1)
  binding, which leads to autophosphorylation of ATM kinase and phosphorylation of
  histone H2AX on S 139 (γ-H2AX). This creates a biding site for mediator of DNA damage
  checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1), which recruits the E3 ubiquitin ligases, RNF8 and RNF168,
  to establish polyubiquitination marks at the break sites []. These ubiquitination
  events recruit TP53BP1 and BRCA1 to the damage site. TP53BP1 binds H4K20me1, H4K20me2,
  and H2AK15 (ubiquitinated by RNF168) and mediates a cascade of events that prevents
  end resection, signaling NHEJ factors, including p53, to either repair the DNA or
  execute apoptosis/autophagy [].
