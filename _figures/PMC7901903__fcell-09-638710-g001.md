caption: The role of gasdermins in pore formation and pyroptotic cell death. The extrinsic
  pathway of apoptosis is triggered by interaction between death ligands and death
  receptors. The death receptor-mediated process involves the assembly of the death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC) that induces the activation of caspase-8. GSDMC is cleaved
  into two fragments by caspase-8, generating an N-terminal functional domain and
  a C-terminal repressor domain. The released GSDMC-NT exerts its pore-forming effect.
  Caspase-8 can cleave caspase-3. Active caspase-3 proteolytically processes GSDME,
  producing GSDME-NT to form pores on the cell membrane and induce pyroptosis. GSDME-NT
  is able to permeabilize the mitochondrial membrane that leads to the leakage of
  cyto c. The translocation of cyto c to the cytosol can induce the activation of
  caspase-9 that processes pro-caspase-3 into active caspase-3. These events ultimately
  augment the apoptotic signaling cascade. GSDMA3-NT binds membrane lipids to form
  pores and triggers pyroptotic cell death. GSDMA3-NT combines with the cytosolic
  chaperone Hsp90 for mitochondrial targeting. Hsp90 escorts GSDMA3-NT to the mitochondrial
  transport receptor Tom70, leading to the generation of ROS. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  can result in the activation of caspase-9, which then processes pro-caspase-3 into
  caspase-3. GSDMB can be cleaved by caspase-1, -3, -4, -6, and -7. The unmasked N-terminal
  domain punches massive holes in the cell membrane. The canonical inflammasome sensors
  recognize various DAMPs and PAMPs and activate caspase-1. Upon activation, caspase-1
  cleaves GSDMD, releasing the N-terminal effector domain from the C-terminal inhibitory
  domain. GSDMD-NT interacts with phosphoinositides residing on the inner leaflet
  of the cell membrane and oligomerizes to generate membrane pores. This event leads
  to cell lysis and the release of intracellular contents. Caspase-1 also cleaves
  the inactive proforms of IL-1β and IL-18 to generate biologically active cytokines.
  GSDMD-NT pores serve as a conduit for the passage of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Alternatively,
  caspase-4, -5, and -11 are activated by sensing intracellular LPS. Active caspase-4,
  -5, and -11 cleave GSDMD within the linker domain. GSDMD-NT pores mediate potassium
  efflux, which in turn activates the canonical inflammasome signaling. Tom70, translocase
