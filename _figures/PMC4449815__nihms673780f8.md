caption: a, b, In contrast with the well-known tumor promoting role of the heterotrimeric
  G protein Gαs, this study suggests that Gαs and its downstream effector PKA function
  as part of a tumor suppressive circuitry regulating the fate of GLI+ stem cells
  (shown in blue in a), in part by restraining the transcriptional activity YAP1 and
  GLI, independently of canonical Hippo and SHH signaling (b). Disruption of this
  Gαs-PKA signaling axis in the epidermis is sufficient to promote rapid stem cell
  expansion and basal cell carcinoma formation, while overactivation of this signaling
  pathway leads to hair follicle stem cell depletion and hair loss (a). See text for
  more details.
