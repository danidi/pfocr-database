caption: Signaling model for IP-10 production induced by MRP8/MRP14. As an important
  DAMP molecule, MRP8/MRP14 activates TLR4 and its downstream TRIF, and then promotes
  the activation of both IKKα/β-NF-κB and TBK1-IKKε-IRF3 pathway, initiating the production
  of IP-10 in monocytes/macrophages. As a chemoattractant, IP-10 attracts CXCR3+ lymphocytes
  to the infection/injury sites, which establishes an in vivo role for IP-10 in MRP8/MRP14-regulated
  immune responses.
