caption: 'Autophagy, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest mediated by the activity of
  nuclear p53 protein (p53) in its function as a transcription factor in stress conditions.
  p53 primarily induces the canonical pathway of autophagy by transcriptionally upregulating
  tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) (or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN); not
  shown) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (or the AMPK activating sestrins;
  not shown), thereby suppressing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and the unc-51-like
  autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) complex including the autophagy-related protein13
  (ATG13) and the focal adhesion kinase interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) further
  downstream. For ULK1-mediated autophagosome formation or suppression, mTOR interacts
  further downstream with Beclin-1 (BECN1). Alternatively, damage-regulated autophagy
  modulator (DRAM), death-associated protein kinase (DAPK), or autophagy-related protein5
  (ATG5) upregulation by the p53 family members p63 and p73 are also able to initiate
  autophagy. DAPK executes autophagy by phosphorylating Beclin-1 or inhibiting LC3-interacting
  MAP1B protein (MAP1B-LC3). DRAM and p63/p73 can also induce apoptosis. Pro-apoptotic
  proteins of the Bcl-2 family such as BCL2, BCL-xL, BAX, BAD, MCL, PUMA, and BNIP
  and the alternate reading frame protein product of the CDKN2A locus (p14ARF) can
  further induce autophagy via reversal of Beclin-1 inhibition. Fork symbols: inhibition
  by indicated proteins. Arrow lines: upregulation or activation by indicated proteins.
  Double arrow: major pathway activity. p53-mediated upregulation of the cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor 1 (p21) enforces cell cycle arrest.'
