caption: We have previously shown that HCV core/gC1qR interaction up-regulates PD-1
  and SOCS-1 negative signaling molecules, leading to suppression of TLR-mediated
  IL-12 production. In this study, we further demonstrated that the Tim-3 inhibitory
  pathway is involved in the HCV core/gC1qR-induced inhibition of IL-12 expression
  by M/MФ during HCV infection. Specifically, we found that Tim-3 can be up-regulated
  by HCV core/gC1qR interaction, which in turn, inhibits TLR-mediated IL-12 production.
  We also found that Tim-3 can crosstalk with other inhibitory molecules such as PD-1
  and SOCS-1 to coordinately inhibit TLR-mediated IL-12 signaling pathways during
  HCV infection. We conclude that HCV-mediated innate immune dysregulation (impaired
  M/MФ IL-12 production) may ultimately lead to adaptive Th1/Tc1 dysfunction, and
  thus, HCV persistence.
