caption: Schematic illustration of possible mechanisms that may underlie H2S‐induced
  BP lowering. H2S lowers BP via vasodilatation by activation of vascular KATP channels
  and/or inhibiting Ca2+ influx via Ca2+ channels. NO and H2S share cross‐talk regulatory
  roles in vasorelaxation via the PI3K/Akt‐eNOS‐NO pathway. H2S increase haem oxygenase
  1 (HO1), which is the main enzyme for CO generation. H2S inhibits reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production through redox‐sensitive signalling pathways.
