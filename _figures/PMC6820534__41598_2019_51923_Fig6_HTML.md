caption: Supposed mechanism. GRK5 phosphorylates the GRPR upon bombesin binding. This
  leads to the activation of GRPR down-stream signalling and subsequently to the transcription
  of proteins like FLNA, PLAU and CD47. The final consequence is the maintenance of
  cell polarity and tension enabling cell migration which could be therapeutically
  exploited by inhibiting this pathway with sunitinib treatment.
