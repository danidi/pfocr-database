caption: Pathway for the biosynthesis of GlcCer in fungi. The last three steps of
  GlcCer synthesis, involving sphingolipid C-9-MT, fatty acid Δ3-desaturase, and GCS1
  enzymes, are shown (). The structures of C18 α-OH-Δ4,8-ceramide, C18 α-OH-Δ4,8,C-9-methyl-ceramide,
  and C18 α-OH-Δ4,8,C-9-methyl-glucosylceramide are shown. To our knowledge, neither
  the fatty acid Δ3-desaturase enzyme nor its gene has been studied in any fungus
  to date.
