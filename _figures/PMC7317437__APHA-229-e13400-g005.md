caption: 'A proposed schematic diagram of signalling pathways for doxorubicin‐induced
  muscle atrophy. Many intracellular pathways participate in doxorubicin‐induced muscle
  atrophy. The pathways are divided in three main pathways in this diagram: (a) The
  disrupted insulin signalling pathway leading to decreased protein synthesis, indicated
  in blue; (b) The autophagic signalling and ubiquitin‐proteasome proteolysis pathway
  leading to increased protein degradation, indicated in  green; and (c) Oxidative
  stress leading to mitochondrial degradation, indicated in  red. Insulin‐like growth
  factor 1 (IGF‐1) normally stimulates protein synthesis through Akt and mTOR. The
  insulin signalling pathway is disrupted in doxorubicin‐induced muscle atrophy and
  the expression of important proteins (ie GLUT4 and AMPK) involved in glucose uptake
  is decreased, which results in decreased protein synthesis. Myostatin (Mstn) increases
  protein degradation by activating forkhead (FOXO) family transcription factors.
  This allows for the increased transcription of important atrophy‐related genes (ie
  atrogin‐1/MaFbx and MuRF‐1). Furthermore, mitochondrial respiration is negatively
  affected by doxorubicin, resulting in excess ROS production. On the one hand this
  results in the activation of calpain‐1 and caspase‐3, which are proteases that are
  capable of, respectively, promoting muscle atrophy by cleaving structural proteins
  and degrading intact myofibrillar proteins. The activity of these two proteases
  is increased following doxorubicin administration, leading to proteolysis. On the
  other hand, it results in mitochondrial degradation, which leads to skeletal muscle
  atrophy. Note that underlined proteins are upregulated in response to chemotherapy'
