caption: Lipid synthesis in S. cerevisiae. The pathways shown in the figure include
  the relevant steps discussed in this work. The PAP reaction catalyzed by Pah1 is
  found at the branch point in lipid synthesis where PA is converted to DAG or CDP-DAG
  for the synthesis of TAG or membrane phospholipids, respectively. The PAP reaction
  is counterbalanced by the DAG kinase reaction catalyzed by Dgk1, and together, these
  enzyme reactions (highlighted by gray shading) play a major role in controlling
  the balance of PA and DAG. The dashed arrow leading from acetyl-CoA to acyl-CoA
  represents the many steps needed to form the fatty acyl moieties of lipids. The
  early steps for PE synthesis in the CDP-ethanolamine branch of the Kennedy pathway
  and the CL remodeling steps are not shown in the figure. A more detailed map of
  lipid synthesis pathways that also include the PI-derived synthesis of polyphosphoinositides
  and complex sphingolipids may be found elsewhere (). Gro-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  FA, fatty acid; Cho, choline; P-Cho, phosphocholine; Etn, ethanolamine; Ino, inositol;
  PGP, phosphatidylglycerophosphate.
