caption: The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway links the nervous system and immune
  system. Activation of the pathway by vagal nerve stimulation suppresses inflammation
  and enhancing this pathway protects kidneys from acute injury. The efferent vagus
  nerve stimulates CD4-positive T cells in spleen via the splenic sympathetic nerve.
  Release of norepinephrine binds to beta adrenergic receptors on CD4+ T cells, which
  then elicits release of acetylcholine (ACh). ACh binding to alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptors (α7nAChRs) on macrophages produces an anti-inflammatory response, such
  as TNFα suppression. Ultrasound prior to kidney ischemia and reperfusion attenuates
  injury through either a neuronal or neuronal independent pathway that requires the
  spleen, CD4+ T cells, and α7nAChRs expressed on bone marrow-derived cells (17,18).
