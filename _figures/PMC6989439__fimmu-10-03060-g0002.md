caption: Cellular-mediated rejection. (A) Natural killer (NK) cells-mediated rejection.
  Xenoantibodies bind to donor endothelial cells with their Fab portion. The Fc fraction
  of the antibody is recognized by FcRs located on the surface of NK cells, triggering
  the signaling cascade that leads to NK cell destruction. The release of lytic granules
  (marked as dark spots) leads to pig endothelial cells lysis. The activating NK cell
  receptors recognize their ligands on the donor cells and trigger lytic granule release.
  The inability of swine leukocyte antigen (SLA) class I to interact with human inhibitory
  NK-cell receptors makes porcine cells highly susceptible to human NK-cell-mediated
  lysis. (B) Macrophages-mediated rejection. Macrophages can be activated by cytokines
  [e.g., interferon gamma (IFN-γ)] that are produced by xenoreactive T cells contributing
  to the amplification of the T-cell response (not shown). Macrophage also can also
  be activated by signals mediated by the Fc receptor for IgG (FcγR) upon interaction
  with xenoreactive-antibody-coated porcine cells. Macrophages secrete proinflammatory
  cytokines [e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6)
  that augmented cytotoxicity of macrophages. (C) T-cell response in xenograft rejection.
  The direct pathway refers to the recognition of antigens presented by pig antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) by recipient T cells. The T cell is activated by interaction between
  T-cell receptors (TCRs) and the SLA I and II peptide complexes. This interaction
  results in T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity that is directed against the xenograft vascular
  endothelium. The indirect pathway refers to the recognition of donor-derived peptides
  on recipient APCs by recipient T cells. The interaction between primate TCRs and
  major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and porcine peptide complexes leads to primate
  T-cell response, including cytokines production and induction of B-cell activation.
