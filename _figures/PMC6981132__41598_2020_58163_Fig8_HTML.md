caption: Metabolic versatility of urea decomposition. (A) The two different metabolic
  routes of decomposition of urea catalyzed by different enzymes namely urease and
  urea carboxylase. (B) A phylogram based on the genes involved in the urease pathway
  and their organization into operons within genomes. The phylogenetic clades are
  shown with the colored boxes in front of each genome name in the tree.
