caption: Model of regulation of feeding by serotonin. A, In response to serotonin,
  SER-7 in MC cell-autonomously activates its downstream Gsα signaling pathway, which
  subsequently stimulates pharyngeal pumping by activating cholinergic transmission
  from MC to the pharyngeal muscles. B, In response to serotonin, SER-7 in M4 (and
  possibly in M2) activates its downstream G12α pathways in a cell-autonomous manner,
  which subsequently activates M4. The stimulus from active M4, along with dense core
  vesicle release controlled by an unidentified pathway, activates isthmus peristalsis.
  The Gsα signaling pathway and downstream cholinergic transmission also contribute
  to activating isthmus peristalsis, but their sites of action have not been characterized.
  Given that expression of SER-7 in M4 fully restored isthmus peristalsis rate in
  the ser-7 null mutant, it is plausible that release of dense core vesicles from
  the unidentified cells is constitutively active rather than triggered by serotonin.
  C, Stimuli from an active M4 neuron and from the anterior part of the pharynx, excited
  by pumping, are both required to activate isthmus peristalsis. In the absence of
  either stimulus, isthmus peristalsis does not occur.
