number: Figure 6
caption: 'HEK293 cells were transfected with WT-PFKFB3, R131/134L- or R131/134K-PFKFB3
  mutant. These cells were incubated with the medium containing 1 g l−1 13C6-labelled
  glucose for 5 min. Measurements of 13C-labelled metabolites were performed by CE-MS.
  (a) Differences in 13C-labelled metabolites in glycolysis and PPP between the cells
  transfected with WT-PFKFB3 (open bars), those transfected with R131/134K-PFKFB3
  (grey bars) and those transfected with R131/134L-PFKFB3 (closed bars). Data are
  expressed as mean+s.d. (nmol mg−1 protein) of six separate experiments *P<0.05 versus
  controls. ND, not detected. (b) The two nonmethylable mutants significantly increase
  PPP flux and suppress glycolysis. Differences in biotransformation of glucose in
  the cells carrying WT-PFKFB3 or two nonmethylable mutant: R131/134K and R131/134L.
  ∑13C-glycolysis and ∑13C-PPP are described in  and . BPG is expressed as total sum
  values of 2,3-BPG and 1,3-BPG. Note that the R131/134L mutant displays greater suppression
  of the glycolytic flux than the R131/134K mutant (†P<0.05). Data are expressed as
  mean+s.d. (nmol mg−1 protein) of six to seven separate experiments. *P<0.05 versus
  the cells carrying WT-PFKFB3. ANOVA with Fischer’s multiple comparison test was
  used throughout this figure.'
