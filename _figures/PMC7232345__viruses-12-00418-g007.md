caption: 'Proposed model for OAS2 regulation of ZIKV replication and IFN pathway.
  Viral infection initiates host innate immunity activation through the sensing of
  5′ region of ZIKV by retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), which maybe directly
  induced OAS2 expression and indirectly induced by type I IFN pathway. OAS2 inhibited
  ZIKV replication through three effects: (i) OAS2 activated RIG-I pathway, including
  enhanced expression of RIG-I, IRF7, TNFα and IL-8, to induce the production of IFNβ.
  (ii) OAS2 potentiated the anti-ZIKV activity of IFNβ. (iii) OAS2 activated the IFN-induced
  Jak/STAT signaling pathway through increased level of p-STAT1, enhanced ISRE activity
  and up-regulated expression of several ISGs.'
