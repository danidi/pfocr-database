caption: HSA21 trisomy leads to Bach1 repressor of transcription overexpression, which,
  in the nucleus, forms heterodimers with small Maf proteins and bind to antioxidant
  response elements (AREs), repressing transcription of HO-1 and NQO1 genes. DS individuals
  are characterized by early increase of oxidative/nitrosative stress (OS/NS), and
  the inhibition of HO-1 induction both contributes to BVR-A activity by increasing
  protein nitration. The HO-1/BVR-A pathway, when impaired, is not able to exert its
  neuroprotective function thus favoring the progression of AD pathology in DS individuals.
  Finally, the development of AD pathology in DS individuals leads the ubiquitination
  of Bach1 partially recovering HO-1 induction but not the system functionality.
