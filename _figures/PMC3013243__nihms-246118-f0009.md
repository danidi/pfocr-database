caption: 'TLR4 activates ERK pathway via IKKβ-mediated phosphorylation of p105. Based
  on the results presented here, we propose that GRK2 negatively regulates IKKβ-induced
  p105 phosphorylation and therefore the ERK pathway. Because p105 phosphorylation
  is also essential for p50 mediated NFκB activation, negative regulation of p105
  by GRK2 also modulates a subset of cytokines that are regulated by this pathway.
  Note that there are two exceptions: 1. Because MCP-1 was inhibited by ERK inhibitor
  but not by the IKKβ inhibitor, it is possible that MCP-1 is being regulated by GRK2
  in an ERK-dependent but p105-independent mechanism. 2. Also, because MIP1α was modestly
  inhibited by PD98059, it is possible that a small component of the ERK pathway may
  also regulate MIP1α. Previous studies in primary macrophages and neutrophils have
  demonstrated that TLR4 activation increases the expression of GRK2 significantly
  and thus GRK2 might act as a negative feedback regulator for TLR4 signaling.'
