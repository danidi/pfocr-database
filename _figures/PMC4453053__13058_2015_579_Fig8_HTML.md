caption: Illustration depicting the role of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor and
  β1-integrin in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process induced by cancer-associated
  fibroblasts. Long-term exposure to tamoxifen promotes the translocation of G protein-coupled
  estrogen receptor (GPER) to the cell membrane, which enhances the crosstalk between
  GPER and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The Ga subunit of GPER is responsible
  for the increase in cAMP generation in breast cancer cells and cAMP attenuates ERK1/2
  activity by suppressing protein kinase A (PKA) on Raf, whereas cAMP production triggered
  by GPER is disorganized upon acquisition of tamoxifen resistance leading to the
  increased activation of ERK1/2. Tamoxifen, as an agonist for GPER, stimulates the
  induction of β1-integrin expression through the GPER/EGFR/ERK signaling pathway.
  Upregulation of β1-integrin is accompanied by the activation of the β1-integrin
  signaling pathway, which is measured by FAK and Src activity. Conditioned medium
  (CM) produced by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) induces epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) through the activation of PI3K/AKT, with the involvement of β1-integrin.
  Targeted therapy with β1-integrin could reverse the stimulatory effect of CAFs in
  the tumor microenvironment on cell motility. ECM, extracellular matrix; ITGB1, β1-integrin;
