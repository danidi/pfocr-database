caption: Regulation of expression and functional role of CD38. Bifunctional enzyme
  CD38 is expressed on a variety of immune and mesenchymal cells including on airway
  smooth muscle cells. In immune cells, CD38 serves as a cell surface marker and contributes
  to inflammatory response. CD38 via production of cADPR, a calcium elevating second
  messenger, contributes to smooth muscle contractility and airway hyperresponsiveness
  (right half). Regulating CD38 expression, its enzyme activity or cADPR levels in
  effector cells may lead to human pathologies. Inflammatory cytokines, hormones,
  and other inflammatory mediators regulate CD38 expression via activation of transcription
  factors such as NF-κB and AP-1 or via expression of specific microRNAs (left half).
  Overall, CD38 expression can be modulated at transcriptional level as well as posttranscriptionally
  by microRNAs.
