caption: Interaction between GPCR and BACE1 in neuronal cell. Ligand-bind GPCR can
  activate G proteins and then stimulate downstream signal molecules such as PLC,
  IP3, AC, and cAMP. IP3 can bind to IP3 receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  leading the release of Ca2+. β-Arrestin can be recruited to GPCR mediating its desensitization,
  internalization and G protein independent signaling pathway. GPCR, BACE1, APP, and
  γ-secretase are synthesized in ER, and then be transported into plasma membrane,
  then be guided to endosome. After that these proteins can be sorted to lysosome,
  proteasome, ER, or back to plasma membrane. After sequential cut by BACE1 and γ-secretase,
  APP releases Aβ, which can form oligomers and fibers and finally senile plaque.
  In addition, soluble Aβ can promote the phosphorylation of tau, which in turn accelerates
  the aggregation of Aβ. These factors eventually cause the synapse dysfunction and
  AD.
