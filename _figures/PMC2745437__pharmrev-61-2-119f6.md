caption: The fMLF-induced signaling events leading to the activation of phagocyte
  NADPH oxidase (Nox2). Depicted schematically are major signaling pathways activated
  by fMLF that results in NADPH oxidase activation in neutrophils. Upon activation
  of the Gαi proteins, the released Gβγ subunits trigger PI3K activation, resulting
  in the production PIP3 and its degradation products. The Gβγ and PIP3-mediated p-Rex1
  activation is key to the conversion of GDP-bound Rac small GTPase to GTP-bound Rac,
  which translocates to membrane and associates with gp91phox.Gβγ is also responsible
  for PLCβ2 activation, leading to the production of the second mesengers diacyl glycerol
  and 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3), which stimulate PKC activation. Isoforms
  of PKC (PKCδ, PKCξ, PKCβII, and PKCα), MAPK (p38, ERK), and Akt are known to catalyze
  the phosphorylation of p47phox in fMLF-stimulated neutrophils, prompting membrane
  translocation of the cytosolic factors. The PX domain in p47phox also facilitates
  its membrane association. Assembly of a membrane complex of NADPH oxidase is key
  to its conversion of molecular oxygen to superoxide. Omitted in this drawing is
  the phospholipase D (PLD) activation pathway, which is reported to contribute to
  fMLF-induced superoxide generation.
