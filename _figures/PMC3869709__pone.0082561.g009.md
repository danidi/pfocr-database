caption: An increase of Aβ plaques induces oxidative stress and, thus, increases the
  WBV and reduces the CBF and OTE. Moreover, rats with AlCl3-induced AD exhibit a
  high concentration of plasma fibrinogen, which increases erythrocyte aggregation,
  plasma viscosity, and WBV. In contrast, Aβ plaques increase and deposit in the neurons
  of the hippocampus and cortex, increasing the activity of AChE and reducing the
  levels of NAA and Cr. The sustained neurovascular uncoupling ultimately results
  in cognitive decline.
