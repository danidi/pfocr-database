caption: Functional relationship between GFAP+ (glial fibrillary acidic protein) reactive
  astrocytes and IBA+ (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule) activated microglia.
  Reactive astrocytes produce critical components that activate microglia (e.g., CXCL10,
  HMGB1, Lcn2, C3, etc.). These components are recognized by specific microglial receptors
  (CXCR3, TLR4/RAGE, LCN2R, C3aR, respectively) that trigger signaling cascades leading
  to microglia activation. Microglia can also get activated by increases in the levels
  of ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or glutamate in the medium. Activated microglia
  produces IL-1α, TNFα, and C1q, which transform resting astrocytes into type A1 reactive
  astrocytes. Therapeutic strategies to prevent this action are in red. In addition,
  activated microglia participates in the phagocytosis of neurons using specific receptors
  (e.g., TREM2—triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) that recognize specific
  “eat-me” signals. As a consequence of astrocyte and microglia reactivity, critical
  mediators in glial physiology are altered, leading to seizures. Pointed arrows indicate
  direction of the signaling pathway. Blunt arrows indicate inhibition.
