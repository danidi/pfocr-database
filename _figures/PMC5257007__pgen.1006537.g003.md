caption: '(A) Energy metabolism in anaerobic mitochondria of F. hepatica by malate
  dismutase. While the classical anaerobic fermentation to lactate is present (enzymes
  indicated in gray) when oxygen tension is low, the malate dismutation pathway is
  preferred (blue arrows). Phosphenol pyruvate reduction to malate occurs in the cytoplasm
  (orange). Within the mitochondria, part of the malate is oxidized to acetate (yellow)
  while other fraction reduced to succinate and further transformed to propionate
  (blue). Genes predicted for key enzymes involved in anaerobic respiration are indicated.
  Abbreviations: PEP, phosphenolpyruvate; OXAC, oxaloacetate; MAL, malate; FUM, fumarate;
  SUCC, succinate; PYR, pyruvate; AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; CITR, citrate. Enzymes indicated
  are: PK, pyruvate kinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase, PEPCK, phosphenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (ATP dependent); MDH, malate dehydrogenase; ME, malic enzyme; PDH,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase; ASCT, acetate:succinate CoA-transferase; SCS, succinyl-CoA
  synthetase; FH, fumarate hydratase; FRD, fumarate reductase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase,
  MMM methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase. (B) Parasite specific
  enzyme usage in TCA cycle. The KEGG module for TCA cycle (M00009) is shown with
  groups of orthologous enzymes indicated using KEGG orthology (KO) IDs. An interesting
  example of alternate enzyme usage is shown for fumarate hydratase (reaction R01082),
  catalyzed by a class II enzyme (EC 4.2.1.2B; K01679) in both the host and parasite.
  However, F. hepatica also has a Platyhelminthes-specific class I fumarate hydratase
  (EC 4.2.1.2A; K01676), not annotated in any of the host proteomes. Such knowledge
  can be leveraged to design worm specific therapies with potentially low (or no)
  impact on the host health.'
