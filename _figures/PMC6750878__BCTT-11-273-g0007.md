caption: 'Glutathione synthesis for ROS detoxification drives metabolic adaptations
  to maintain glutamate production and cystine acquisition in the absence of GLS activity.
  Glutathione synthesis for ROS detoxification drives metabolic adaptations to maintain
  glutamate production and cystine acquisition in the absence of GLS activity. In
  the absence of GLS activity, glucose-derived pyruvate can feed the TCA cycle generating
  α-KG, which can then be used to generate glutamate via glutamate dehydrogenase.
  With the intracellular pool of glutamate maintained, GSH production can continue,
  both with glutamate itself as a component for GSH and as an exchange factor for
  cystine, the rate-limiting substrate of GSH synthesis. Bolded arrows represent the
  pathway that is hypothesized to compensate for loss of glutamine-derived glutamate
  under conditions of GLS inhibition or low glutamine conditions. Under in vitro conditions,
  the addition of sodium pyruvate to cell culture media drives this process.Abbreviations:
  CYS, cystine; CYS-CYS, cysteine; GSH, glutathione; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  GLS, glutaminase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; α-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate; TCA,
  tricarboxylic acid.'
