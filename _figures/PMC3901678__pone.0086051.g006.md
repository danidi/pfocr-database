caption: 'Genes, up-regulated in males: Most of upregulated gene the involved in biological
  regulation, G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway and regulation of cell
  differentiation. Smaller functional groups of genes, involved in the regulation
  of oskar mRNA translation, spermatogenesis, regulation of reproductive process and
  phospholipase C-activating G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway were also
  upregulated. Genes, down-regulated in males: The genes characterized with decreased
  expression were mostly known to be involved in the cellular respiration and related
  functional category of mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport. Small
  independent cluster of carboxylic acid metabolic process was also downregulated.
  Genes, up-regulated in females: Most of genes were annotated as involved in the
  processes of the proteolysis, defense response, and response to biotic stimulus.
  The smaller clusters of cellular response to heat and humoral immune response were
  revealed. Genes, down-regulated in females: The most of downregulated genes were
  annotated as involved in cell communication. Related functional categories, such
  as homophilic cell adhesion, were also revealed.'
