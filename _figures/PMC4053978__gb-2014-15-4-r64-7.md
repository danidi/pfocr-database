caption: Comparison of sensitivity profiles from environmental to genetic perturbations.
  High dimensional sensitivity information for mutants in threonine biosynthetic pathway
  (circled in red) were obtained from SGA experiments []. These profiles correlate
  with the sensitivity profile obtained in this study when strains are grown on galactose:urea.
  This suggests a correspondence between the internal states of the cells when grown
  in a specific environment, and when subjected to a specific genetic perturbation.
  For example, hom2Δ, hom3Δ, hom6Δ, and thr4Δ mutants would all be expected to accumulate
  aspartate because these mutants shut down a major metabolic shunt for aspartate.
  The phenotypic similarity in genetic interaction space between these mutants and
  growth on galactose:urea suggests that growth on galactose:urea may cause the internal
  accumulation of aspartate or some other metabolic intermediate unique to the hom2Δ,
  hom3Δ, hom6Δ, and thr4Δ mutants.
