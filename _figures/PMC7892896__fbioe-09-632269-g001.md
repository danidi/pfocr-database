caption: 'Taxol biosynthetic pathway from geranylgeranyl diphosphate, showing carbon
  positions. Enzymes in red are not yet characterized and steps in red dotted arrows
  are not yet fully elucidated. Blue arrows—genes encoding putative PCL and T2′αH
  were recently isolated, though not yet applied in metabolic engineering designs.
  Enzyme abbreviations: TXS, taxadiene synthase; T5αH, taxane-5α-hydroxylase; TAT,
  taxane-5α-ol-O-acetyltransferase; T10βH, taxane-10β-hydroxylase; T13αH, taxane-13α-hydroxylase;
  T1βH, taxane 1β-hydroxylase; T9αH, taxane 9α-hydroxylase; T9αO, taxane 9α-dioxygenase;
  T2αH, taxane 2α-hydroxylase; T7βH, taxane 7β-hydroxylase; C4-C20, C4-C20 epoxidase;
  TBT, taxane-2α-O-benzoyl transferase; DBAT, 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-O-acetyltransferase;
  PAM, phenylalanine aminomutase; PCL, phenylalanine-CoA ligase; BAPT, C-13 phenylpropanoyl-CoA
  transferase; T2′αH, taxane 2′α-hydroxylase; DBTNBT, Debenzoyl taxol N-benzoyl transferase.
  Products of T5aH—OCT, 5(12)-oxa-3 (11)-cyclotaxane and iso-OCT, 5(13)-oxa-3(11)-cyclotaxane,
