caption: 5-FU enhances resistance of BC cells to 5-FU by regulating GRP78/lncRNA MIAT/AKT
  pathway through inducing ER stress. After BC cells were treated with 5-FU, the expression
  of GRP78 was elevated through ER stress, thereby increasing the expression of OCT4.
  Upregulation of OCT4 increased the expression of AKT through increasing lncRNA MIAT,
  thereby inducing resistance in BC cells to 5-FU.
