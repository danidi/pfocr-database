caption: Proposed pathway for l-Pro-B and d-Pro-B catabolism based on the genome neighborhood
  contexts in P. bermudensis, P. denitrificans, and R. sphaeroides. The interconversion
  of l-Pro-B and d-Pro-B is catalyzed by HpbD; l-Pro-B undergoes two N demethylations
  to l-Pro; and finally, l-Pro oxidation is catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme PutA
  to give l-glutamate, which is readily deaminated to ammonia plus 2-ketoglutarate,
  the citric acid cycle intermediate.
