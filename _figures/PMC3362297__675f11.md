caption: Proposed roles of the calcineurin signaling cascade in stress responses,
  drug tolerance, and virulence in C. glabrata. Calcineurin and Crz1 are required
  for various stress responses, including thermotolerance, ER stress, echinocandin
  tolerance, cell membrane integrity, and virulence. Calcineurin also exhibits Crz1-independent
  functions, including pH homeostasis and optimal growth in serum. Calcineurin (Cna1
  or Cnb1) suppresses calcium tolerance, whereas Crz1 inhibits azole tolerance. Regulator
  of calcineurin 1 (Rcn1) is an endogenous positive regulator of calcineurin that
  participates in the control of multiple cellular processes, including thermotolerance,
  ER stress, and echinocandin tolerance. Rcn2 acts as a feedback inhibitor of calcineurin
  function in calcium tolerance. Solid arrows represent promoting functions, and bar-headed
  arrows represent inhibitory functions within the calcineurin signaling cascade.
  The dotted arrow represents function as seen in S. cerevisiae, but undetermined
  in C. glabrata.
