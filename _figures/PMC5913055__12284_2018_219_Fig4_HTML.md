caption: MapMan analysis of late pollen-preferred genes. a Metabolic overview and
  (b) regulation overview were analyzed with 627 genes. Cell wall organization and
  modification, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism were dominant MapMan
  terms in metabolic overview. Red boxes in these overviews indicate late pollen-preferential.
  Genes associated with transcription factors, protein modification, and protein degradation
  were identified from regulation overview. In addition, diverse hormone responses,
  signaling pathway components, and redox responses for late pollen development were
  visualized. Detailed information about overviews is shown in Table S5.
