caption: Mechanism of GnRH-(1–5) action in Ishikawa cells. The metabolite GnRH-(1–5)
  binds GPR101 to induce EGF release in a G protein-dependent mechanism. An increase
  in EGF release, likely via the cleavage of membrane-bound EGF, induces the phosphorylation
  of EGFR at the residues Y992, Y1045, and Y1068. Activation of the EGFR pathway in
  turn initiates signaling cascades important in the promotion of cell migration.
