caption: The 3 signals of T-helper cell activation. 1. Antigen presentation. Peptides
  derived from a vaccine are loaded on MHCII molecules by the APC and presented to
  the T-cell receptor (TCR) on T-cells. 2. Co-stimulation. Activated APCs express
  co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80/86 which support T-cell activation through
  interaction with CD28 on T-cells. 3. Cytokines. APCs can produce different cytokines
  depending on the type of PAMP that has activated the APC. These cytokines provide
  a third signal to the T-cell by engaging their cognate receptors on the T-cell surface.
  Whereas IL-12 (red) signaling leads to Th1 polarization of the CD4+ T-cell, IL-4
  (yellow) signaling induces Th2 polarization and IL-6/IL23 (blue/purple) signaling
  provides a pathway towards Th17 CD4+ T-cells
