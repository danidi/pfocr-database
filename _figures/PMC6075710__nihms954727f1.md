caption: 'Metabolic pathways of ceramide synthesis. Ceramide can be generated by 3
  pathways: de novo synthesis initiated by the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine
  to form 3-ketosphinganine; hydrolysis of sphingomyelin; or breakdown of complex
  sphingolipids via a series of reactions referred to as the salvage pathway. Complex
  sphingolipids have various acyl chain lengths varying in carbon length and degree
  of saturation. For simplicity, only C16:0-linked sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids
  are illustrated. Monohexosylceramides consist of a single sugar residue, either
  glucose or galactose (galactosylceramide is not shown).'
