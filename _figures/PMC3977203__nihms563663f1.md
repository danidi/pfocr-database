caption: Negative feedback inhibition of HER3. A. The HER2-HER3 dimer potently activates
  both the PI3K-AKT and MAPK pathways, both of which result in inhibition of HER3
  transcription. Activation of PI3K by phosphorylated (P) HER3 results in the PI3K-mediated
  conversion of PIP2 to PIP3. The production of PIP3 recruits AKT to the extracellular
  membrane where it can become phosphorylated by mTORC2 as well as PDK1. Phosphorylated
  AKT can then inhibit the FOXO family of transcription factors that activate RTK
  gene expression. Signaling through the MAPK pathway begins with RTK-mediated activation
  of RAS which signals downstream to RAF, MEK and eventually, MAPK. Specifically in
  the context of mutant V600E BRAF expression in thyroid cancer, it has been shown
  that MAPK signaling can negatively regulate transcription of HER3. B. Inhibition
  of the PI3K-AKT pathways, with either PI3K, AKT or mTOR inhibitors, as well as inhibition
  of the MAPK pathway with vemurafinib (BRAF V600E inhibitor) has been shown to result
  in transcriptional upregulation of HER3, eventually leading to reactivation of its
  downstream targets.
