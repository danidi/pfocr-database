caption: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent and nuclear factor (NF)κB-mediated activation
  of proinflammatory cytokines. LPS binds to LPS-binding protein (LBP) and forms a
  complex with the surface protein CD14 that further interacts with MD-2 associated
  Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)
  is recruited to TLR4 by its Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (IL1R) (TIR) domain and
  further activates serine/threonine kinase interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase
  (IRAK) by its death domain (DD). After recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor
  associated factor 6 (TRAF-6), another adapter protein, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) transforming growth factor β activated kinase (TAK1)
  is activated that phosphorylates the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) complex. Activated
  IKK removes inhibitory IκB from the IκB-NFκB complex so that NFκB can enter the
  nucleus and where it stimulates the expression of proinflammatory chemokines. In
  a second pathway, which is not listed here, TAK1 is able to activate MAP kinases
  p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).
