caption: LIF binds to LIF receptor complex to activate the Stat3 signaling pathway.
  Stat3 transcriptionally induces inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1), which can up-regulate
  MDM2, a key negative regulator of p53. The increased MDM2 levels promote p53 protein
  degradation, which leads to decreased p53 protein levels and reduced function in
  apoptosis. In turn, LIF promotes chemoresistance in human colorectal cancer cells.
