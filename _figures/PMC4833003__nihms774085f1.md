caption: The AR (Aldose Reductase) and GR (Aldehyde Reductase) mutations affect two
  separate portions of the third step of the vitamin C synthesis pathway. The AR/GRKO
  mutation is a double knockout preventing the conversion of L-glucuronate to L-gulonate.
  SMP30 is a mutation in the fourth step of synthesis affecting gulonolactonase, preventing
  the conversion of L-gulonate to L-gulono-γ-lactone. Sfx, GULOKO and OSD affect the
  fifth step of synthesis and are distinct mutations of L-gulono-γ-lactoneoxidase,
  which converts L-gulono-γ-lactone to ascorbic acid. Mutation names are denoted in
  red, intermediates are denoted in black, step numbers are denoted in blue.
