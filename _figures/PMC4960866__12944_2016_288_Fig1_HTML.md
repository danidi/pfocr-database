caption: Overview on the role of apolipoprotein E (APOE) in the three main pathways
  of plasma lipoprotein metabolism. In the exogenous pathway, chylomicrons (CM) are
  generated in the intestine from dietary fat and cholesterol and enter the systemic
  circulation, where they acquire APOE. CM are lipolyzed by lipoprotein lipase (LPL)
  and form CM remnants (CMR). Peripheral tissues, e.g., skeletal muscle and adipose
  tissue, take up released free fatty acids (FFA) and cholesterol. CMR undergo hepatic
  clearance after APOE-mediated binding to cell surface receptors, e.g., low density
  lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) or LDLR-related protein (LRP) and heparan sulfate
  proteoglycan (HSPG) pathways. In the endogenous pathway, very low density lipoproteins
  (VLDL) are synthesized and secreted by the liver. LPL and hepatic lipase (HL) cause
  the release of FFA and the formation of VLDL remnants which can be cleared by the
  liver by APOE-mediated uptake (see above). Complete hydrolysis of VLDL results in
  the formation of LDL which lack APOE (LDL contain APOB-100 which mediates cellular
  uptake). The reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) enables excess cholesterol to be
  redirected from peripheral tissues to the liver via high density lipoproteins (HDL)
  that comprise APOE. APOE apolipoprotein E, CM chylomicron, CMR CM remnant, FFA free
