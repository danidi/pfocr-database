caption: Schematic depiction of crosstalk between Notch and HIF-1α. (1) The canonical
  hypoxic signaling leads to the inhibition of HIF-1α degradation mediated by PHD1/2/3.
  STAT3 could bind to the HIF-1α promoter and stimulates its transcription, whereas
  PI3K/AKT, ERK were contributed to the translation of HIF-1α protein through phosphorylation
  of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E) binding protein (4E-BP1)
  and p70 S6 kinase (S6K). Elevation of HIF-1α protein induces the activation of downstream
  genes, such as VEGF, PGK1, and ET1, through binding to HRE elements in the corresponding
  promoters. (2) After binding to ligand, the Notch receptor undergoes two proteolytic
  cleavages and then releases the intracellular domain of NICD, which translocates
  to the nucleus and associates with the CSL transcription factor and coactivators
  such as RPBJK, and regulates the expression of target genes such as Hey and FABP7.
  (3) HIF-1α and NICD form a point of convergence between the two signaling, leading
  to stabilization of NICD, recruitment of HIF-1α to Notch-responsive promoters, and
  activation of Notch downstream genes. HIF-1α could also induce the elevation of
  DLL1, which may contribute to HIF-1α-mediated activation of Notch pathway. 1, the
