caption: Damaged mitochondria lead to the release of mROS, oxidative mtDNA and mitochondria
  or its components-containing EVs under stress(hypoxia). (1) The oxidative mtDNA
  in resident cells increases inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 through
  activating NOD (Nucleotide binding oligomerization domain)-like receptors (NLRP3)
  inflammasome pathway. (2) mtDNA that enter endolysome pathway through endocytosis
  into the receptor cells via EVs and by mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) acts
  on Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9)–myeloid differentiation primary response protein
  88 (MYD88)–nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) signaling for pro-inflammatory gene expression.
  (3) Damaged mitochondria enter into the recipient cells via EVs, which induce the
  generation of mROS that lead to the increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines,
  such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and Type I interferon (IFN) in recipient cells.
  (4) In addition, damaged mitochondria can be degraded through mitophagy, and mitochondrial
  miRNA and protein can be detected as diagnostic markers.
