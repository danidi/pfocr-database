caption: The mevalonate pathway-mutp53 positive-feedback loop and statin’s inhibitory
  effects on this loop and cancer progression. Cancer cells expressing mutp53 have
  increased expression of the mevalonate pathway enzymes due to the mutp53-SREBP2
  interaction, leading to enhanced activity of the mevalonate pathway. Activated mevalonate
  pathway increases the levels of MVP, leading to mutp53 stabilization (positive-feedback
  loop) and also promotes prenylation of Ras and Rho proteins, accelerating cancer
  progression. Thus, the mevalonate pathway promotes cancer progression by increasing
  activities of oncogenic proteins mutp53, Ras, and Rho (left). Inhibition of the
  mevalonate pathway activity by statins reduces MVP levels and protein prenylation
  of Ras and Rho, which in turn induces mutp53 degradation and decreases activities
  of Ras and Rho, thus inhibiting cancer progression (right).
