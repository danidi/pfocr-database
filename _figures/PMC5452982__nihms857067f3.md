caption: a | Interferon-γ (IFNγ)-mediated induction of macrophage activation coordinates
  the initial inflammatory response and the regulation of muscle differentiation.
  In the well-characterized signalling pathway through which IFNγ activates the M1
  phenotype, the cytokine binds its receptor, leading to the recruitment of the tyrosine
  kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2, which in turn phosphorylate and activate
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and IFN-regulatory factor
  1 (IRF1). Nuclear targeting of dimerized, phosphorylated STAT1 enables it to bind
  γ-activated sequences (GASs) of target genes, leading to the activation of a range
  of genes that can promote the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. Simultaneously, IFNγ-activated
  signalling in muscle cells through the JAK–STAT1 pathway increases the expression
  of MHC class II transactivator (CIITA). During early stages of myogenesis, CIITA
  binds directly to myogenin (MYOG) and inactivates it, preventing MYOG-mediated induction
  of myogenic genes that are required for muscle differentiation and function (for
  example, TNNI2 (which encodes fast skeletal muscle troponin I2 and LMOD2 encoding
  leiomodin 2)). This helps to retain myogenic precursor cells (MPCs) in an undifferentiated,
  proliferative state. In later stages of differentiation, increased levels of CIITA
  lead to its recruitment of EZH2 to the Polycomb-response element (PRE) of muscle-specific
  genes, which leads to their silencing and prevents the expression of genes that
  are required to reach the fully mature muscle phenotype. b | Increased release of
  tumour necrosis factor (TNF) coordinates early myogenic events with the initial
  inflammatory response during early stages of muscle injury and repair. Although
  numerous cells, including those of muscle itself, can express TNF, inflammatory
  cells are the primary sources at early stages post injury. TNF binding to its receptor
  (TNFR) on macrophages activates signalling through TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2),
  leading to activation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase (IKK), and the
  subsequent phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB (IκB) and activation
  of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Activated NF-κB then translocates to the cell nucleus
  to bind to the NF-κB-response element (NRE) of target genes to activate their expression.
  Expression of those target genes is essential to maintain the initial inflammatory
  response. Alternatively, the binding of molecules containing damage-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs), especially high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) can also activate
  NF-κB. HMGB1 binds to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on macrophages to activate NF-κB
  via myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and TRAF6. At the same
  time, TNF can bind its receptor on the MPC surface to activate mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 3 (MKK3) or MKK6, leading to the activation of the
  MAPK p38α. Phosphorylation of EZH2 by p38α causes EZH2 recruitment to the Polycomb
  repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which leads to binding at the PRE of target genes.
  Activated EZH2 then trimethylates histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) at the target genes,
  leading to their repression. Two functionally important target genes in activated
  satellite cells are PAX7 and NOTCH1, and their silencing prepares the satellite
  cells to transition to the early stages of differentiation. CCL2, CC-chemokine ligand
  2; CXCL9, CXC-chemokine ligand 9; IFNγR, IFNγ receptor; IL, interleukin; IL-6R,
