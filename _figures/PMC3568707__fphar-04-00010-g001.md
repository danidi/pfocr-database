caption: 'BiP as master regulator of the Unfolded Protein Response. Upon accumulation
  of unfolded peptides in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) the chaperone BiP is titrated
  away from the stress sensors PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein
  1 (IRE1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). When released by BiP, PERK
  homodimerizes and autophosphorylates before phosphorylating the alpha subunit of
  the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α). eIF2α phosphorylation inhibits transcription
  while activating the transcription factor ATF4 and its target gene C/EBP homologous
  protein (CHOP). CHOP induces apoptosis by suppressing Bcl-2 and activating Bim and
  Bax gene expression. Similarly to PERK, the kinase/endonuclease IRE1 homodimerizes
  and autophosphorylates before splicing Xbp1 mRNA (Xbp1u: Xbp1 unspliced; Xbp1s:
  Xbp1 spliced). The third branch of the UPR is activated after cleavage of the transcription
  factor ATF6 in the Golgi (cATF6). Both cATF6 and Xbp1s regulate transcription of
  pro-survival genes like Glucose Regulated Proteins 78 and 94 (GRP78 and 94) and
  Protein Disulfide Isomerases (PDIs). In addition to its canonical function in the
  ER, it has also been shown that BiP can localize to the plasma membrane and regulate
  the Akt/PI3K pathway. (Yellow dots indicate phosphorylation. For simplicity PERK
  and IRE1 are shown as monomers).'
