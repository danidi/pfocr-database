caption: Schematic representation of the nucleolar surveillance pathway. Under normal
  growth conditions (left), ribosomal proteins (RPs) are assembled with ribosomal
  RNA into the 40S and 60S subunits in the nucleolus. p53 activity is maintained at
  low levels by ubiquitin-mediated degradation induced by MDM2. Following nucleolar
  stress (right), ribosome biogenesis is halted thus RPs, rRNAs, and other nucleolar
  proteins are released into the nucleoplasm. RPL5 and RPL11 are free to bind to MDM2
  and prevent p53 ubiquitylation. p53 is then available for regulation of its target
  genes leading to cellular responses like cell cycle arrest, senescence, apoptosis
  and autophagy.
