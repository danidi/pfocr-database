caption: Transcriptional regulation of thrombin-induced endothelial cell VEGF induction.
  (A) Vessel injury and thrombin formation promote a proangiogenic response in ECs.
  While resting vascular ECs form a protective anticoagulant lining that prevents
  uncontrolled blood activation at the blood–endothelial interface [], different types
  of pathological conditions can promote activation of vascular ECs, leading to thrombin
  and clot formation. Thromboinflammation may be triggered upon disruption of the
  protective endothelial interface, thereby allowing the detrimental contact of blood
  with subendothelial highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142), which can induce
  the extrinsic TF pathway of coagulation. In addition, the intrinsic contact activation
  pathway of coagulation may be activated through multiple triggers. Activation of
  either coagulation pathway leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and fibrinogen
  to fibrin, with thrombin being able to stimulate EC activation and release of VEGF
  with concomitant EC proliferation and repair. (B) Molecular mechanisms underlying
  endothelial angiogenic response to thrombin. ECs can be activated by various stimuli
  (e.g., vascular injury, thromboinflammation, and thrombin release), which can promote
  EC proliferation and repair (e.g., VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis). We here identified
  that these events are mediated through a signaling cascade involving PAR-1, ERK,
  and AP-1 signaling, with concomitant VEGF promoter engagement (Position −267 to
  −53 nucleotides from the VEGF gene), VEGF mRNA synthesis, and VEGF protein secretion.
