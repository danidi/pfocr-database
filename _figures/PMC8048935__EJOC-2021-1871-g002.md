caption: 'Synthetic pathways for the target compounds: Conventional route consisting
  of a 3 step synthesis including condensation, demethylation, and acylation steps;
  Alternatively, a pre‐functionalization pathway consisting of 2 steps to include
  the preparation of aldehyde and porphyrin condensation to yield the target compound;
  Aldehydes 9A, 10A, 8 and 9 were successfully re‐crystallized forming crystalline
  compounds that were later analyzed via X‐ray crystallography, non‐essential hydrogen
  atoms, solvent, and counter anion molecules omitted for clarity, thermal ellipsoids
  give 50 % probability.'
