caption: 'Activation of this pathway leads to proliferation and survival of cells.
  Section (A) demonstrates normal inhibition of HER2 signaling pathway by Trastuzumab
  in cancers without mutations that may confer resistance. Section (B) demonstrates
  mutations in HRAS which lead to constitutive activation of the Ras gene downstream
  of Trastuzumab inhibition thus leading to resistance to Trastuzumab. MEK inhibitors
  such as Selumetinib act downstream of these activating mutations and can overcome
  the effects of HRAS mutations. Section (C) demonstrates mutations in PIK3Ca which
  lead to constitutive activation of this pathway downstream of Trastuzumab inhibition
  thus, leading to resistance of Trastuzumab therapy. Section (D) demonstrates mutations
  in PTEN that lead to truncation or a frameshift mutation resulting in a loss of
  function. PTEN inhibits the activation of PI3K hence, the loss of function is thought
  to contribute to resistance to Trastuzumab therapy. In both section C and section
  D a potential therapy downstream of these mutations conferring resistance to Trastuzumab
  include mTOR inhibitors such as Everolimus. Abbreviations: Chr - Chromosome; MAPK
  - Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase; mTOR - Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin; PI3K
  - Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-Bisphosphonate 3-Kinase.'
