caption: ADE of infection, leading to a pro‐inflammatory cytokine response, compared
  with neutralization. (A) Anti‐spike IgG antibodies bind to a virus particle creating
  an antibody‐virus complex that attaches to Fcγ receptors on myeloid lineage cells
  (monocyte/macrophage), leading to antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection.
  The infected cell expresses high levels of the pro‐inflammatory cytokines, TNF‐α,
  IL‐6, and IL‐8. (B) Neutralizing antibodies bind to S proteins on the surface of
  the virus particle, blocking interactions with the viral entry receptor, ACE2, preventing
  infection of the host cell through this pathway. Reproduced from Iwasaki and Yang.()
