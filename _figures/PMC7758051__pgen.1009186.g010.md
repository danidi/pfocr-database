caption: Wounding of the cell cortex leads an rush of calcium into the cytoplasm developing
  locales of increased calcium concentration known as microdomains. To plug the hole,
  elevated calcium levels initiate exocytotic programs to recruit vescles to the wound
  area, forming a plug while simultaneously releasing insulin-like peptide 104 (ilp4)
  into the perivitelline space. Ilp4 is recognized by the insulin receptor (InR) where
  it binds and activates the IIS pathway. Subsequent phosphorylation events downstream
  of InR, ultimately activate downstream effectors including the actin remodelers
  Chickadee and Girdin to repair and restore the cortex back to its normal state.
