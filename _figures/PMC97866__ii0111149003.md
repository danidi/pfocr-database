caption: A working model for stress-induced bradyzoite differentiation. Stress conditions,
  including pH shock and exposure to nitric oxide, result in elevation of cAMP and
  cGMP (in response to nitric oxide) within host cells. Host cell stress and cAMP
  response genes are induced. Stress also induces formation of cAMP within the parasite
  by adenylate cyclase, which may be coupled to a receptor that senses an extracellular
  signaling molecule or nutrient. cAMP activates PKA and leads to transcription of
  bradyzoite-specific genes. Prolonged cAMP also activates pathways inhibitory to
  bradyzoite differentiation. TPK3, a GSK3 family member, may also interact with the
  PKA signaling pathway as seen in other stress-induced differentiation models such
  as Dictyostelium. PVM, parasitophorous vacuole membrane.
