caption: '(A) In the proamyloidogenic pathway (right side), BACE1 cleavage of APP
  generates the N terminus of Aβ, thus creating the secreted sAPPβ ectodomain and
  membrane-bound APP CTFβ fragments. Next, γ-secretase cuts CTFβ to produce the C
  terminus of Aβ and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Aβ is then secreted from
  the neuron, where it self-aggregates into extracellular amyloid plaques and causes
  neurodegeneration. In contrast, the antiamyloidogenic pathway (left side) involves
  cleavage of APP by ADAM10, leading to the generation of membrane-bound APP CTFα
  and the secreted sAPPα ectodomain, the latter of which has neurogenic and neurotrophic
  properties. γ-secretase then cuts CTFα to produce the nonamyloidogenic p3 fragment
  and the AICD. ADAM10 and BACE1 compete with each other to cut APP, such that changes
  in the amount of ADAM10 cleavage result in opposite effects on BACE1 processing
  of APP and vice versa.(B) ADAM10 is a 748 amino acid type I membrane protein. Upon
  transit through the trans-Golgi network, the prodomain of ADAM10 is removed by furin
  or PC7. The mature enzyme is then trafficked to the plasma membrane, where it performs
  ectodomain shedding of diverse membrane protein substrates. The asterisks denote
  the positions of the two prodomain mutations that cause LOAD; the position of the
  dominant-negative artificial mutation in the protease domain is also indicated.
  The following abbreviation is used: Dis & Cys: disintegrin and cysteine domain.(C)
  During synthesis of the enzyme, the wild-type (WT) ADAM10 prodomain serves as an
  intramolecular chaperone that facilitates correct protein folding of ADAM10 (left
  side). After prodomain removal and degradation, mature ADAM10 exhibits full α-secretase
  activity and performs antiamyloidogenic processing of APP. In contrast, the mutant
  (MT) ADAM10 prodomain has impaired intramolecular chaperone function, which results
  in improper ADAM10 protein folding and reduced α-secretase activity, thus leading
  to increased proamyloidogenic cleavage of APP by BACE1 (right side).'
