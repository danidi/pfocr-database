caption: 'Key roles are played by ALA Synthase-1 [ALAS1], heme oxygenase-1 [HMOX1],
  nuclear receptors [NRs], and hydroxymethylbilane [HMB] synthase [HMBS]. Heme itself
  downregulates several steps in the synthetic pathway, especially ALAS1, as shown
  in the figure, by down-regulating transcription (minus sign, −), up-regulating mRNA
  breakdown (plus sign, +), blocking uptake into mitochondria (−), and increasing
  Lon peptidase 1 breakdown of the mature mitochondrial enzyme (+). Heme up-regulates
  HMOX1 (+), mainly by increasing its transcription through binding to Bach1, a b-zip
  protein that binds DNA, and a tonic repressor of HMOX1. HMBS is present in relatively
  low amounts, compared to other enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway down-stream of
  ALAS1, and HMBS becomes rate-controlling for heme synthesis when ALAS1 is induced.
  50% deficiency of HMBS, the defect in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), can lead
  to critical deficiency of heme and uncontrolled induction of ALAS1. Such induction
  may also occur, albeit less often and less severely, when there are inherited or
  acquired defects in coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) or protoporphyrinogen oxidase
  (PPOX). Heme administered intravenously is taken up by hepatocytes, and can replete
  heme pools rapidly and transiently down-regulate ALAS1 and correct the defects caused
  by HMBS, CPOX, or PPOX deficiency.[Other abbreviations: BVR, biliverdin reductase;
