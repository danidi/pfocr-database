caption: Schematic diagram of PKB activation. Inactive PKB (shown in red) and PDK1
  are recruited to the membrane via their PH domains. The kinase domain of PKB is
  phosphorylated at Thr308 by PDK1 and the HM at Ser473 by mTORC2 to give fully activated
  PKB (shown in green), which can remain at the membrane or migrate to the cytosol
