caption: 'Compatible solute biosynthesis. A representative metabolic pathway illustrating
  reactions from multiple cyanobacterial species are combined to show the metabolism
  of compatible solutes and glycogen (purple) as a function of primary photosynthates
  derived from the Calvin Cycle. The major compatible solutes for freshwater (sucrose
  and trehalose), marine (glucosylglycerol and glucosylglycerate), and halophilic
  cyanobacteria (glycine betaine) are shown. It must be stressed that these reactions
  are not necessarily all contained in any one cyanobacterial species, but are a combination
  of known pathways from representative freshwater, marine, and halophillic strains
  (S. elongatus 7942, S. elongatus 7002, Synechocystis 6803 & Aphanothece halophytica).Abbreviations:
