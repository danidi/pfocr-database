caption: 'Differential ganglioside metabolism pathways between MDA-MB-231 GD3S+ clone
  #4 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Glycosyltransferase gene expression profile
  obtained by qPCR were mapped onto a subpart of the “Ganglio-sphingolipid metabolism”
  pathway from WikiPathways [,] based on the differential expression between two cell
  lines. In the squared nodes, colors vary from blue (≤ −2) to white (= 0) and red
  (≥ 2) to indicate the repression to the over-expression of the glycosyltransferase
  gene in MDA-MB-231 GD3S+ clone #4 compared to MDA-MB-231 cells (thick black arrows).
  Quantitative data concerning the relative amounts of gangliosides obtained by MALDI-QIT-TOF
  mass spectrometry were added to the pathway based on the comparison between MDA-MB-231
  GD3S+ clone #4 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In the octagonal nodes, colors vary from green
  (≤ −8) to white (= 0) and fuchsia (≥ 8) to indicate a restraint to a rise of the
  amount of a given ganglioside based on the differences observed between the two
  cell lines. Grey color indicates the absence of any available quantitative data
  about the expression.'
