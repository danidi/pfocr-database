caption: Proposed model for the role of TGFβ in IL4-induced alternative microglia
  activation. IL4 induces expression of the alternative activation markers Ym1 and
  Arg1 via the IL4Rα-Stat6 pathway. TGFβ binds to its receptors TGFβ type I and type
  II, which form a heteromeric complex and initiate Smad-dependent and Smad-independent
  pathways. Exogenous TGFβ1 enhances IL4-induced Ym1 and Arg1 expression either by
  a direct effect on Ym1/Arg1 promoter activity or indirectly by up regulating the
  IL4Rα through activation of the MAP kinase (Smad-independent) pathway. Furthermore,
  IL4 treatment alone increased endogenous TGFβ2 expression and secretion. Autocrine
  TGFβ2 in turn might be able to enhance IL4-induced Arg1 expression by using similar
  signalling mechanisms to exogenous TGFβ1.
