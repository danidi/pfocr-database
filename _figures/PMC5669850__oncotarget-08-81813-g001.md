caption: 'TLRs and some NLRs, in particular, NOD1 and NOD2, activate nuclear factor
  (NF)-kB by recognizing PAMPs and DAMPs. TLRs are transmembrane receptors, except
  for TLR-3/7/8/9, with a leucine-rich repeats ((LRRs) motif), a Toll/IL-1 receptor
  (TIR) interaction domain required for forming multimers with TIR-containing adaptor
  molecules, namely myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD)88, MyD88
  adaptor-like also known as TIR domain-containing adaptor protein, TIRAP), TIR domain-containing
  adaptor inducing IFN-b (TRIF). Upon stimulation, TLRs activate MyD88-dependent pathway:
  MyD88 recruits members of the IRAK family and TRAF6 for the activation of the TAK1/TAB
  complex, with the resultant IKK complex activation that triggers NF-kB and its translocation
  to the nucleus. However TLR-4, as TLR-3, active TRIF-dependent pathway which lead
  to NF-Kb activation with the recruitment of receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP-1).
  Among NLRs there are NOD-1 and NOD-2 which present in the N-terminal portion Pyrin
  domain (PYD) or caspase-recruitment domain (CARD), a central NACTH domain and in
  the C-terminal portion a series of leucine-rich repeats (LRR). Though CARD-CARD
  interactions NOD-1 and NOD-2 recruit RIP-2 kinase that lead to TAK-1/TAB complex
  and then NF-kB activation.'
