caption: Interaction of antagonists with Wnt5A/Ryk signalling in vascular endothelial
  cells. a Wnt5A binds to the Ryk receptor by interaction with its WIF domain, inducing
  downstream activation of the ROCK/LIMK/CFL pathway. Phosphorylated CFL is inactivated
  and allows formation of actin stress fibers (f-actin), that can interact with adherens
  junction protein β-catenin and tears VE-cadherin junctions apart. As a result, endothelial
  monolayer permeability is increased. b In the presence of the Wnt antagonist secreted
  Frizzled-related peptide (sFRP) that covers the Wnt5A binding site for the cysteine-rich
  domain of Frizzled receptors, interaction of Wnt5A with Ryk is still unaffected.
  c In the presence of the Wnt antagonist WIF1 (WIF) that covers the Wnt5A binding
  site interacting with Ryk receptor’s WIF domain, Wnt5A/Ryk interaction is blocked,
  and downstream signalling is not transduced. CFL1 remains active and restricts f-actin
  formation. Actin remains mainly in the globular form (g-actin), that does not interact
  with adherens junction proteins
