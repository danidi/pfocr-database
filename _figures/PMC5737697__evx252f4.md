caption: —Functional interaction network connecting the downregulated serine protease,
  Ser12, to cellular pathways involved in apoptosis and response to stress. Protein–protein
  interaction and activation of the thioredoxin peroxidase 2, Jafrac2, by Ser12 directly
  signals the activation of apoptotic cysteine-type endopeptidase, as well as potential
  regulatory cascades involving prophenol oxidase 2 (PPO2). Jafrac2 is also involved
  in cellular response to oxidative stress conditions, and regulated cell survival
  via the Janus activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (JAK/STAT) pathway. Up- and downregulated transcripts were indicated in green and
  orange boxes, respectively. Putative networks defined between DEGs and gene ontologies
  (biological processes; gray nodes) were connected by DEG yeast-2-hybrid protein–protein
  interaction partners.
