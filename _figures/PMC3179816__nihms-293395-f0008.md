caption: c-MYC expression in the prostatic epithelium provokes a mild increase in
  proliferation and apoptosis. A majority of the c-MYC-expressing cells show no histological
  abnormality. At this stage, the p53 pathway is not activated. Next, c-MYC-expressing
  cells preferentially lose the Pten tumor suppressor leading to increased proliferation
  and progression to cancer. However, at this stage apoptosis is also evident due
  to activation of p53 pathway upon Pten loss. Selective pressure to avoid apoptosis
  promotes loss of p53, allowing cells to overcome apoptosis, resulting in development
  of aggressive prostate cancer.
