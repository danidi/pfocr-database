caption: 'CD30 signals through TRAFs: upon stimulation by CD30L, CD30 recruits TRAF2
  via interaction with its TRAF binding motif, resulting in TRAF2 degradation. TNFR1,
  on the other hand, signals through TRADD leading to activation of caspases and ultimately
  apoptosis or activation of the classical NF-κB pathway and ultimately survival and
  proliferation. Signaling through CD30 depletes intracellular TRAF2 diverting signaling
  through TNFR1 to apoptosis []. Not all TRAF2 undergoes degradation upon CD30 stimulation.
  In certain ALCL cells, TRAF2 translocates to a detergent-insoluble cellular compartment,
  and this translocation has been associated with NF-κB pathway activation []. Activation
  of the classical NF-κB pathway involves activation of the IKK complex and proteasomal
  degradation of the IκB proteins. The proteasomal degradation of TRAF2, TRAF3, and
  c-IAP-1/2 which hold NIK upon recruitment by a subset of TNF receptor superfamily
  proteins, notably CD40, leads to the activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway
  via liberation and stabilization of NIK []. Activation of the alternative NF-κB
  pathway involves activation of IKK1 and proteolytic processing of the p100 precursor
  protein to the p52 subunit of NF-κB. (Illustration courtesy of Alessandro Baliani.
