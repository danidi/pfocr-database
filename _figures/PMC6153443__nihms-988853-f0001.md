caption: A recent study in mouse models by Chen et al. showed that deletion of two
  tumor-suppressor genes commonly lost in prostate cancer resulted in the activation
  of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and increased production
  of lipids in prostate cancer cells (Panel A). The authors observed a similar effect
  when the mice were fed a high-fat diet, and they found that the effect was suppressed
  with the administration of fatostatin, a molecule that blocks adipogenesis (Panel
  B). Upward arrows indicate increased, and downward arrows decreased.
