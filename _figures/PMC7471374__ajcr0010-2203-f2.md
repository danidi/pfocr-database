caption: The upstream and downstream pathways of CARD9. Dectin-1 bears an hemITAM
  and mediates intracellular signaling directly via Syk, it mainly senses β-glucans
  in fungal cell walls; Dectin-2 and Mincle mediate intracellular signaling indirectly
  via association with an ITAM-containing adaptor molecule called FcRγ and Syk. And
  Dectin-2 mainly recognizes α-mannose, while Mincle majorly senses amphiphilic glycolipids.
  Dectin-3 couples with an unknown signaling adaptor to initiate Syk and can also
  recognize α-mannans. TLRs are also transmembrane receptors. They are capable of
  recognizing diverse PAMPs such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan and nucleic
  acids of fungal, bacterial and viral components. The signaling transmission mediated
  by TLRs demands specific intracellular signaling adaptors including MyD88. CARD9
  transduces signals downstream of Syk to the canonical NF-κB pathway through cooperating
  with BCL10 and MALT1 for pro-inflammatory responses. Syk activates PKCδ and Vav
  proteins, which promote the activation of CARD9; RIP2 associates with CARD9, IRAK4,
  and TRAF6 to mediate activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. IKK complex consists of IKKα,
  IKKβ, and IKKγ, among which IKKγ is required for connecting with downstream molecules.
  MALT1 is responsible for relaying the signal from BCL10 to the IKK complex. Upon
  stimulation, IKKγ mediates ubiquitination and causes NF-κB to locate to the cell
  nucleus, thus inducing gene transcription of cytokine production.
