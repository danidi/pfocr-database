caption: The L-arginine–NO biosynthetic pathway regulates key vasculogenic and angiogenic
  factors in pregnancy. Demand for L-arginine is increased during pregnancy to support
  the rapidly growing placenta and fetus. L-arginine is acquired in protein-rich foods,
  which are often lacking in diets in low-resource settings. Therefore, reduced dietary
  intake, in combination with increased demand in pregnancy, may place pregnant women
  at risk of arginine deficiency and reduced bioavailable NO. L-arginine is converted
  to NO via NOS enzymes. L-citrulline, which is also acquired through dietary intake,
  is produced as a by-product of NO synthesis from L-arginine, and can be recycled
  in a feedback loop to generate more arginine. Several enzymes and competitive inhibitors
  such as arginase, ADMA, and SDMA influence the equilibrium of arginine use between
  metabolic pathways and affect the bioavailability of NO. ADMA competitively inhibits
  NOS, whereas SDMA can inhibit the cellular uptake of L-arginine, directly and indirectly
  preventing L-arginine conversion to NO. The enzyme DDAH degrades methylarginines,
  including ADMA. At the placental trophoblast, NO interacts with critical mediators
  of angiogenesis (PlGF, VEGF, the angiopoietins). The induction of angiogenesis by
  angiopoietin and VEGF proteins is dependent on downstream activation of eNOS and
  production of NO from L-arginine. NO signaling also acts in a positive feedback
  loop to increase endothelial amounts of VEGF and Ang-1. Furthermore, NO reduces
  inflammation-mediated endothelial activation by reducing expression of vascular
  adhesion molecules and proinflammatory cytokines. ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine;
  Ang-1/-2, angiopoietin-1 and -2; DDAH-1, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1;
