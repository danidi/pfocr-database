caption: Scavenger receptor class B, member 2 and EV71 infection in RD cells. (A)
  Comparison of the structures of human and mouse SCARB2. The human and mouse SCARB2
  proteins are type III transmembrane proteins consisting of 478 amino acids. The
  amino acid identity of human SCARB2 to mouse SCARB2 is 85.8%. Because mouse SCARB2
  does not serve an efficient receptor, it is possible to identify the virus binding
  site using chimeric receptors including mouse and human sequences. The 63-amino-acid
  region that is encoded in exon 4 of the human SCARB2 gene plays an essential role
  in EV71 binding and infection. (B) Mechanism of EV71 infection in RD cells. The
  SCARB2 protein is located in the lysosomal and endosomal compartments and shuttles
  to the plasma membrane. This protein is able to bind EV71 when present at the cell
  surface. Hussain et al. () have shown that EV71 infection is dependent on the clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis pathway by knockdown of the expression of proteins that participate
  in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. EV71 infection is also inhibited when cells are
  treated with drugs that block acidification of the endosome.
