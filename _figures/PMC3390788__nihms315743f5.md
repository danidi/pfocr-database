caption: 'Alpha adrenergic signaling during the awake state (a) and during dexmedetomidine
  or clonidine administration (b). (a) Normal adrenergic signaling from the LC during
  wakefulness and normal pain signaling during wakefulness from the spinal cord to
  the brain stem. (b) Dexmedetomidine-induced loss of consciousness through NE mediated
  inhibition of the POA and decreased noradrenergic signaling in the thalamus and
  cortex. Clonidine-induced analgesia through enhanced inhibitory activity in the
  descending pain pathway. Abbreviations: 5HT, serotonin; ACh, acetylcholine; DA,
  dopamine; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; GABAA, gamma aminobutyric acid receptor subtype
  A; Gal, galanin; His, histamine; ILN, intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus; LC,
  locus coeruleus; LDT, laterodorsal tegmental area; NE, norepinephrine; PAF, peripheral
  afferent fiber; PN, projection neuron; POA, preoptic area; PPT, pedunculopontine
  tegmental area; RVM, rostral ventral medulla; TMN, tuberomamillary nucleus; vPAG,
  ventral periaquaductal gray.'
