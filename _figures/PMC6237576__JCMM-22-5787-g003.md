caption: Potential contributions of PCAF‐induced acetylation to the development of
  liver injury and mediators of inflammation. A, Oxidative stress increases the level
  of PCAF; acetylation of TyrRS by PCAF promote the nuclear translocation of TyrRS,
  which may cause hepatocellular DNA damage under oxidative stress; (B) PCAF is recruited
  by KLF10 to the FOXP3 transcriptional regulatory regions that are critical for the
  induction of this gene which will amplify the chronic liver damage; (C) The EMT
  and MET events which are involved in liver fibrosis occurrence are regulated by
  PCAF acetylation on ZEB1; (D) As a target for miR‐181a/b, PCAF down‐regulation by
  TNF‐α provides negative feedback regulation to inflammatory reactions in liver epithelial
  cells responses, a process that may be relevant to the epigenetic fine‐tuning of
  epithelial inflammatory processes in general; (E) HMGB1 is acetylated by PCAF, this
  modification is associated with nonclassical vesicle‐mediated pathway which is an
  inflammatory response to liver injury. TyrRS, Tyrosyl‐tRNA synthetase; KLF10, transforming
  growth factorβ (TGFβ)‐inducible Kruppel‐like factor; FoxP3, forkhead box P3; Tregs,
  CD4+ ‐T cell; APC, antigen‐presenting cell; ZEB1, zinc finger E‐box‐binding homeobox
  1, HMGB1, Serum high‐mobility group box 1; EMT, epithelial‐mesenchymal transition;
  MET, mesenchymal‐epithelial transition
