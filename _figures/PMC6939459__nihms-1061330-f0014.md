caption: 'a, Early-stage Th1 cell activation is supported by the malate-aspartate
  shuttle and mitochondrial citrate export. These mitochondrial transport systems
  provide the key substrates needed for cell division and histone acetylation. Citrate
  export results in cytosolic acetyl-CoA production that can be used to synthesize
  the fatty acids needed for plasma membrane expansion during division as well as
  the acetyl-groups used for histone acetylation. Interconnected with this export
  pathway is the malate-aspartate shuttle, a carbon-neutral cycle that results in
  the net movement of NAD+ to the cytosol and NADH into the mitochondria, whereby
  it can fuel the activity of electron transport chain (ETC) Complex I. Through the
  activity of Complex I, NAD+ can be continually recycled, enabling the production
  of aspartate, an essential precursor for nucleotide synthesis. These processes are
  antagonized by the activity of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)/ETC Complex II, which
  consumes α-ketoglutarate, limiting its availability for the malate-aspartate shuttle
  and promoting Th1 cell effector function. b, Th cell activation is defined by two
  major phases: 1) a period of rapid division and epigenetic remodeling; and 2) cell
  cycle arrest and cytokine production. Each of these phases is supported by a discrete
  component of mitochondrial metabolism. The malate-aspartate shuttle and citrate
  export generate the material needed for early phase differentiation to occur. As
  differentiation continues, the activity of Complex II draws carbon away from the
  shuttle and thus acts to pull activated Th1 cells out of the differentiation process
  and to enable to them to fully engage their terminal effector cell program. When
  the mitochondrial transport networks are disrupted, Th1 cells are unable to properly
  proliferate or epigenetically reprogram. In contrast, inhibiting the activity of
  Complex II causes activated Th1 cells to continuously proliferate and remodel their
  chromatin, preventing them from exiting the differentiation phase and engaging their
  terminal effector program.'
