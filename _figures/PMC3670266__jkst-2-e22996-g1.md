caption: Figure 1. Hypothetical overview of cellular communications originating from
  cancer cells. Cell communication is mediated by direct contact between neighboring
  cells or by secreted factors. Growth factors produced by cancer cells are well known
  to enhance cell survival and abnormal proliferation. These soluble factors modify
  the microenvironment to favor tumor escape, for instance by the activation of endothelial
  cells and through the upregulation of angiogenic activities. Besides these secreted
  factors, it appears that microvesicles that contain miRNAs are also produced by
  cancer cells, to modify the microenvironment and probably to allow tumor progression.
  Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the STAT3-NFκB pathway in the
  establishment of autocrine survival loop mediated by secreted factors. It will be
  important to determine if these secreted miRNAs are also involved in the constitutive
  activation of oncogenic pathways.
