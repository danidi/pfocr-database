caption: This schematic illustrates key features of the canonical CDK/RB/E2F pathway.
  In this schematic, proteins thought to be primarily tumor suppressing are highlighted
  in red (“stop” light), whereas proteins generally considered tumor promoting are
  highlighted in green (“go” light). Solid pointed arrows indicate a direct activation
  event, as in the case of cyclins binding CDKs to activate them. Blunt solid arrows
  indicate direct inactivation by direct binding (such as RB binding E2F to abolish
  its transcriptional activity) or by protein modification (such as the phosphorylation
  of pRB by CDKs resulting in its inability to bind and repress E2F. Dashed lines
  indicated indirect regulation.
