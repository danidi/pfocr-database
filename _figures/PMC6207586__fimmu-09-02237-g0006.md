caption: Mechanism of action of microtitre plate based complement activation assays.
  Schematic representation of the mechanisms for commercially available enzyme immune
  assays (EIA) to monitor complement activation via the three different pathways.
  Wells of microtiter plates are coated with ligands for the recognition molecules
  within each pathway. For each assay, serum supplemented with inhibitors for the
  other two pathways is incubated. After complement activation, the readout for all
  assays is formation of the terminal complement complex C5b-9.
