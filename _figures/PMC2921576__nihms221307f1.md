caption: 'Schematic representation of hepatic methionine metabolism. The first steps
  in hepatic methionine (Met) metabolism are conversion to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe),
  through a reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), and transfer
  of the methyl group of SAMe to numerous methyl acceptors with formation of S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH). Although there are a large number of SAMe-dependent methyltransferases, the
  reaction that quantitatively contributes most to the transmethylation flux is the
  methylation of glycine by glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT, a reaction activated
  by SAMe) to form N-methyl-glycine (Me-Gly) (,). Accordingly, the liver of GNMT-KO
  mice shows a marked increase in the concentration of SAMe and aberrant methylation
  reactions of DNA and proteins (). Nicotinamide (NAM) administration may be used
  to reduce the elevated levels of hepatic SAMe in GNMT-KO mice. NAM is methylated
  to form N-methyl-NAM (Me-NAM) by the enzyme NAM N-methyltransferase (NNMT). SAH
  is subsequently hydrolyzed to homocysteine (Hcy) by SAH hydrolase (SAHH), which
  is an important metabolic hub. Hcy can be remethylated to regenerate Met, via either
  methionine synthase (MS, a pathway inhibited by SAMe) and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT), or used for the synthesis of cysteine and α-ketobutyrate as result of its
  transsulfuration. The transsulfuration pathway involves two enzymes: cystathionine
  β–synthase (CBS, which is activated by SAMe) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL). Cysteine
  is then utilized for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH), while α-ketobutyrate penetrates
  the mitochondria where is further metabolized. This coordinated modulation by SAMe
  of the flux of Hcy through the remethylation and transsulfuration pathways maximizes
  the production of cysteine, and consequently of GSH, after a methionine load minimizing
  the regeneration of this amino acid.'
