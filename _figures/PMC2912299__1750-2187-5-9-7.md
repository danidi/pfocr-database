caption: 'Model representing the signaling pathway of G17-induced migration. Stimulation
  of G17/CCK2R pathway leads to activation of two separate signaling axes: (i) an
  activation of MLK3/JNK1 axis, which via activation of its downstream transcription
  factor c-Jun induces MMP7 transcription leading to increased migration; (ii) an
  induction of GSK3βSer9 phosphorylation (inhibition of axis) via a PI3Kinase-independent
  (and yet unknown) mechanism. This leads to an increase in Snail protein expression
  and β-catenin nuclear translocation, combination of which lead to increased MMP7
  transcription and cell migration.'
