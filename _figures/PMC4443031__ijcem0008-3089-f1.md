caption: Regulation between ROCK and MLC. Extracellular signals initiate the activity
  of Rho, which then binds to Rho kinase and change GDP-Rho into GTP-Rho. Activated
  Rho kinase phosphorylates MLC, leading to an accumulation of pMLC. With the increasing
  of pMLC, it enhances stress fibrosis formation and rearranges F-actin cytoskeleton.
