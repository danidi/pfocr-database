caption: Cartoon summary of expression and anatomical data, and a model for phases
  of A/P axis re-organization. (A) Expression patterns of anterior and posterior wnt
  and sFRP genes in intact planarians. Dashed line; plane of amputation used to generate
  head and tail fragments. (B) Sequence of gene expression during posterior and anterior
  regeneration in head and tail fragments, respectively. (C) Sequence of gene expression
  during regeneration in the absence of stem cells. wnt1 is expressed at the wound
  site as normal. Despite a decrease in expression levels compared to controls, posterior
  and anterior markers are expressed anew and A/P axis re-organization begins. wnt11-5
  expression dynamics are very similar in irradiated and unirradiated animals. (D)
  Gut remodeling appears to lag behind the molecular re-organization of the A/P axis
  and does not occur in the absence of stem cells. After 4 dpa, wnt11-5 expression
  expands towards the anterior in control and irradiated animals, but in the absence
  of stem cells wnt11-5 expansion does not halt and is instead expressed along the
  entire A/P axis. (E) A model that divides planarian A/P axis re-organization into
  3 phases and integrates what is known about planarian regeneration. Apoptotic and
  proliferative spikes are observed within 12 hpa. Around 6–9 hpa, the wnt1 wound-specific
  expression response is observed. Finally, the A/P decision is made sometime within
  1 dpa, which has been shown to involved the Hh-wnt/β-catenin pathways, gap junction
  signaling, calcium signaling, and Smed-prep. Aside from proliferation, Phase I does
  not depend upon regeneration or the presence of stem cells. Phase II involves a
  fading of the wnt1 wound response by 2 dpa, followed by another round of spikes
  in apoptosis and proliferation. Concurrently, cells of the fragment assess their
  new A/P position. Aside from the proliferative response, Phase II also does not
  depend upon stem cells or regeneration. Finally, Phase III involves an integration
  of new A/P address with the remodeling anatomy, including the gut. This Phase is
  dependent upon stem cells.
