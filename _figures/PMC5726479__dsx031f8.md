caption: 'Networks of signalling and transcription factors regulate the pheromone
  response. Key components of cAMP-mediated Protein Kinase A (PKA) signalling are
  heterotrimeric G protein a subunit Gpa3, b subunit Bpp1, adenylate cyclase Uac1
  and regulatory and catalytic PKA subunits Ubc1 and Adr1, respectively. Lipopeptide
  pheromone activates its cognate seven-transmembrane domain receptor (Pra). The activated
  receptor triggers a signalling pathway containing the scaffold protein Ubc2 and
  a pheromone responsive MAPK module (MAPKKK Kpp4, MAPKK Fuz7 and MAPK Kpp2). The
  MAPK regulates Prf1 via phosphorylation and at the transcriptional level. At least
  four different transcription factors, Rop1, Crk1, Hap2 and Prf1, recognize defined
  cis-active elements in the prf1 promoter (RRS1-3: Rop1-responsive sequence; CCAAT:
  CAT box; PREs: pheromone response elements; UAS: upstream activating sequence; bent
  arrow: transcriptional start site). In addition, MAPK activity is counteracted by
  phosphatase Rok1, which is activated at the transcriptional level by the MAPK module,
  resulting in negative feedback regulation. Prf1 leads to expression of the b-mating
  type locus gene bE and bW. After cell fusion, sexual and pathogenic development
  is orchestrated by the bE/bW-heterodimer, coordinating the key players of important
  developmental steps: Clp1 is required for in planta proliferation; Rbf1 is the central
  transcriptional regulator, controlling appressoria formation and penetration of
  the host plant via the transcription factor Biz1 and the MAPK Kpp6, as well as filamentous
  growth and the G2 cell cycle arrest by concerted action of Biz1 and Hdp1.'
