caption: Cellular exposure to Zymolyase leads to activation of both the HOG and CWI
  pathways. The cellular exposure to Zymolyase leads to phosphorylation of Slt2/Mpk1.
  Activation of the CWI pathway is independent of the known cell stress sensors that
  function in the CWI pathway but dependent on the HOG pathway. Activation of the
  HOG pathway in the presence of Zymolyase is Sho1 dependent and Sln1 independent.
  Expression of Crh1, a downstream target of the CWI pathway, is Hog1 and Slt2/Mpk1
  dependent. Broken lines indicate potential signal transduction events.
