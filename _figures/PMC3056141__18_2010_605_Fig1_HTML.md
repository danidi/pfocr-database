caption: DNA-mediated activation of innate immune signaling. a TLR9-dependent innate
  immune signaling. TLR9 localizes in the ER and interacts with UNC-93B, which mediates
  TLR9 translocation. Upon stimulation of DNA-containing CpG motifs (CpG DNA) including
  viral genome, TLR9 traffics from ER to endosome to contact CpG DNA, and recruits
  a signaling complex consisting of MyD88, IRAK4, and TRAF6. TRAF6 in turn activates
  TAK1, and TAK1 subsequently activates MAPK and the IKK complex (IKKα, IKKβ, and
  IKKγ) to activate NF-κB. NF-κB and MAPK regulates inflammatory cytokines expression.
  IRAK4 activates TRAF3 and IRAK1, which catalyze IRF7 phosphorylation and induce
  type I IFNs expression. b Cytosolic DNA-mediated innate immune signaling. Cytosolic
  AT-rich dsDNA is recognized by RNA PolIII and transcribed into 5′ triphosphate RNA,
  which activates RIG-I/IPS-1 signaling. IPS1 interacts with FADD/RIP1, which activate
  NF-κB. IPS-1 also activates TBK1 which phosphorylates IRF-3 and induces type I IFNs
  expression. AT-rich dsDNA or non-AT-rich dsDNA is recognized by unknown receptor,
  and activate STING-dependent signaling. STING localizes in the ER with translocon
  complex (TRAPβ, Sec61), and activate Sec5/TBK1 to induce type I IFNs. STING also
  activates NF-κB to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines. dsDNA also activates AIM2/ASC/Caspase-1
  inflammasome pathway to activate IL-1β
