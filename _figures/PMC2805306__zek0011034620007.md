caption: Putative P. carinii sterol pathway. A putative sterol biosynthetic pathway
  indicating genes that have been cloned and functionally characterized (gray, boldface)
  and genes that have not been detected in analyses (ND) is represented. Other genes
  listed include those where either genomic or cDNA sequences have been identified
  by the Pneumocystis genome project (http://pgp.cchmc.org/), but the genes have not
  been characterized. However, the sterol products of these reactions have been identified
  in previous analyses (). Two post-lanosterol pathways are proposed for P. carinii,
  one leading the formation of pneumocyterol (), as indicated by the dotted arrow,
  and another leading to the formation of episterol. Hatched arrows indicate steps
  that have not been determined due to the lack of detection of the genes involved.
