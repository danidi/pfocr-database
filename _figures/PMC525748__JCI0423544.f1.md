caption: Models of Notch and polycystin-1 signaling via RIP. (A) Newly synthesized
  Notch is constitutively cleaved in the trans-Golgi network by furin-like proteases.
  Following this site 1 (S1) cleavage event, the bipartite Notch receptor consisting
  of a noncovalent interaction between the ectodomain (NotchECD) and a membrane-tethered
  intracellular domain (NotchTM) is inserted into the plasma membrane. Activation
  of Notch by its ligand, e.g., Delta, triggers 2 additional proteolytic events. S2
  cleavage by extracellular proteases of the ADAM/TACE (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase/TNF-––converting
  enzyme) family releases NotchECD and generates an activated, membrane-bound form
  of NotchTM that is further processed via RIP-mediated S3 cleavage. These events
  lead to release of the Notch intracellular domain (NotchIntra), which translocates
  into the nucleus and displaces the corepressor (Co-R) complex from the CBF-1, Su(H),
  Lag-1–type (CSL-type) transcription factors. The coactivating (Co-A) complex containing
  NotchIntra and CSL stimulates expression of CSL/Notch target genes. Figure modified

  Current Biology () with permission from Elsevier. (B) Polycystin-1 (pc-1) is a cell-surface
  receptor that undergoes regulated extracellular proteolytic processing at its GPS,
  which results in the release of its N-terminal fragment. In this issue of the JCI,
  Chauvet et al. () show that the CTT of polycystin-1 can also be cleaved from its
  transmembrane anchor, presumably through RIP-related mechanisms. Once released,
  this domain translocates to the nucleus, where it activates the AP-1 transcription
  pathway. This translocation event appears to be regulated by polycystin-2.
