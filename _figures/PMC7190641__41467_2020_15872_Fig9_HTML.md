caption: a Activation of nematode IL-17Rs ILCR-1 and ILCR-2 engages ACTL-1, the C.
  elegans ACT1-like adapter, probably via their SEFIR domains. ACTL-1 recruits the
  C. elegans IRAK and MALT1 homologs to form the ACT1-IRAK-MALT1 signalosome in the
  cytoplasm. This serves a scaffolding function to recruit IκBζ/NFKI-1, and modulate
  its actvity by an unknown mechanism. NFKI-1 probably orchestrates changes in the
  transcriptome of RMG and other cells. MALT1-mediated cleavage of unknown substrate(s)
  positively regulates NFKI-1 signaling. In parallel to this pathway, MALT-1 forms
  a complex of unknown function with TIR-1/SARM1, and with multiple RNA-binding proteins.
  b ILCR receptors and downstream signaling components including MALT-1 are expressed
  in many neurons. This neuronal signaling cassette alters associative learning, as
  well as O2-escape behaviors, and suppresses lifespan and immunity.
