caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed apoptotic signaling pathways triggered
  by JRS-15 in HeLa cells. JRS-15 treatment blocks cell cycle at G1/S phase, which
  triggers the apoptotic signaling by step or multistep. In response to apoptotic
  stimuli, Bax and Bak, translocate to mitochondria, resulting in the depolarization
  of MMP and downstream release of cytochrome c and Smac, which is coincided with
  the downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-xL and XIAP. These events all
  contribute to the subsequent activation of initiator caspase-9 and effector caspase-3,
  and eventually leading cell to an inevitable death.
