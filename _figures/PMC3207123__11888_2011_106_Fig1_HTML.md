caption: A view of CD133 expression as it relates to variety of normal tissue and
  cancer stem cells. CD133 expression is due to the lack of CpG island methylation
  and is regulated by several important pathways, including miR-200a, which serves
  as stemness promoter through the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway. There are three
  reported isoforms, CD133-1, CD133-2, and CD133-3, which are detected in different
  tissue stem cells, niche, and normal tissues
