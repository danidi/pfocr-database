caption: Liver microenvironment. Circulating HCV-specific CD8+ T cells migrating through
  the hepatic sinusoid interact with resident liver cells [Kupffer cells, dendritic
  cells (DC), hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), stellate cells]
  that could act as antigen presenting cells. These cells up-regulate PD-L1 expression
  during persistent HCV infection and interact with the PD-1 molecule expressed on
  HCV-specific CD8+ T cells. This interaction leads to T cell anergy. PD-1 up-regulation
  is produced by TCR stimulation in addition to the interaction between HCV-core protein
  and the complement receptor (gC1qR). In this micro-environment the regulatory T
  cells (Treg) also participate, whose activity is also regulated by the PD-1/PD-L1
  pathway.
