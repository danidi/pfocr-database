caption: A) 1205Lu cells were treated with 1 μM vemurafenib overnight. Cells were
  then treated with or without 10 μg/mL huHER3-8 for 45 minutes followed by treatment
  with 10 ng/mL NRG1 for 15 minutes or 24 hours, as indicated. Cell lysates were prepared
  for RPPA analysis. Linear RPPA scores were averaged and normalized to vemurafenib
  alone samples. Proteins which were regulated 1.5 fold or greater are shown.B) A375
  cells were treated as in (A). Proteins regulated 1.5 fold or greater are shown.C)
  RPPA data generated from vemurafenib-treated 1205Lu cell samples were transformed
  and analyzed using GSEA. Significantly enriched pathways in the presence of NRG1
  were visualized in Cytoscape where pathway node sizes are indicative of NES scores
  relative to each other, as indicated. Data from samples treated with NRG1 for 15
  minutes and 24 hours were averaged together and normalized to vemurafenib alone
  samples to generate the color labeling of protein nodes shown.D) Significantly enriched
  pathways in 1205Lu samples treated with vemurafenib, NRG1, and huHER3-8. Pathway
  analysis was performed as in (C).
