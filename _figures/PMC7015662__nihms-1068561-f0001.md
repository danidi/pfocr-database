caption: Regulation of AIM2 inflammasome activation. AIM2 is a dsDNA sensor and is
  composed of C-terminal HIN-200 domain and N-terminal pyrin domain. AIM2 forms an
  inflammasome when dsDNA from a number of microbial pathogens and host DNA from cellular
  damage binds to the HIN-200 domain of AIM2. The cytosolic bacterium Francisella
  novicida induces the production of type I IFNs via the c-GAS/STING pathway. Type
  I interferons activate IRF1. IRF1 then induces the upregulation of Gbp5 and Irgb10.
  These interferon-inducible proteins directly attack the bacterial membrane of F.
  novicida, releasing its DNA into the cytoplasm; its DNA binds to AIM2. The DNA virus
  MCMV, transfected poly(dA:dT), host DNA from cellular damage and fungal ligands
  from Aspergillus fumigatus activate AIM2 via a non-canonical pathway bypassing the
  requirement of type I IFNs. Ionizing radiation induces dsDNA breaks in host cells,
  leading to the redistribution of AIM2 and ASC into the DNA breakage area of nucleus.
  AIM2 and ASC then translocate to the cytoplasm to assemble an inflammasome complex.
  AIM2 activation can be inhibited by a mouse p202, a bipartite protein containing
  two HIN domains that interact with the HIN domain of AIM2. AIM2 can also be inhibited
  by human POP1 and POP3. During inflammasome activation, ASC brings caspase-1 to
  the inflammasome complex by CARD-CARD interactions. Activated caspase-1 then leads
  to the induction of pyroptosis via the proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal domain
  of gasdermin-D that generates pores on the host cell membrane from which the proteolytically
  cleaved form of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 are released.
