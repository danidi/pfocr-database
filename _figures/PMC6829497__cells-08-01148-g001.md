caption: Canonical Wnt ligands induce two mutually exclusive Dvl2- and Fyn-dependent
  arms. (a) In Wnt OFF, LRP5/6 co-receptor interacts through p120-catenin and E-cadherin
  with inactive CK1ε and Src (both inactive kinases are shown in yellow). (b) Wnt3a
  promotes that PP2A phosphatase, associated to Fz2 through the PR61ε regulatory subunit,
  moves closer to CK1ε, and dephosphorylates and activates CK1ε (in orange). (c) CK1ε
  increases Dvl2 phosphorylation and its binding to Fz2. (d) Dvl2′s association leads
  to signalosome assembly, axin recruitment, and further responses of this pathway.
  (e) LRP5/6 dimerization promotes Src activation and (f) Src-dependent phosphorylation
  of Tyr552 in Fz2. (g) Phospho-Tyr552 binds and activates Fyn, promoting the phosphorylation
  of Stat3. Fyn also phosphorylates β-catenin Tyr142, releasing β-catenin from α-catenin
  and cadherin and thereby facilitating its transcriptional activity.
