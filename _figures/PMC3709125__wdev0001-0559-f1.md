caption: Model of gene regulatory networks in mammalian sex determination. Sex-determining
  genetic activity in the XY pre-Sertoli cell (PSC) is dominated by SRY-SOX9-FGF9/FGFR2.
  This genetic pathway is stabilized by mutually positive (curved arrows) interactions
  between SOX9 and FGF9, resulting in continued expression of SOX9 in the Sertoli
  cell lineage, in combination with antagonism (hammered lines) of ovary-determining
  genes/proteins (shown in red). Only a short period of SRY expression is required
  to upregulate Sox9 from its basal levels in the bipotential gonad. FGF9 and PGD2
  support paracrine signaling (arrows exiting from lower cell), resulting in the recruitment
  of additional supporting cell precursors (upper PSC) that express SRY and/or SOX9
  to the Sertoli cell lineage. The secreted molecules FGF9 and desert hedgehog (DHH)
  also function in masculinizing the germ cell and steroidogenic cell lineages, respectively.
  This testis-determining gene regulatory network and its downstream targets (‘testis
  genes’) initiate a variety of morphogenetic processes, including the migration of
  endothelial cells from the adjacent mesonephros, which are crucial to the formation
  of testis cords and the associated coelomic blood vessel. In the female (XX) gonad,
  the absence of SRY in pregranulosa cells (PGC) results in successful antagonism
  of SOX9/FGF9 by ovary-determining gene products. This causes commitment to the granulosa
  cell lineage and permits retinoic acid (RA) to drive ovarian germ cells into meiosis.
  Note the linear core of the testis-determining pathway and the somewhat more modular
  appearance of the ovary-determining network. Note also that NR5A1 functions at distinct
  stages—this is likely to be true of several molecules included. Question marks indicate
  missing components or uncertainty in terms of regulatory relationships. IR = INSR,
  INSRR, and IGF1R.
