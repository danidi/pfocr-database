caption: Different pathways induced by ALS proteins converge on translational repression.
  Most of ALS proteins, including mutant SOD1, TDP-43, FUS, as well as DPRs (poly-dipeptide
  repeat proteins which are RAN-translated from G4C2 repeat expansion in C9orf72 gene),
  accumulate as misfolded and/or aggregated species inside cells (1). Interestingly,
  these protein aggregates are often found to be positive for stress granules markers
  suggesting a direct relationship between these two entities (2). SG formation is
  strongly associated to translational repression, which is indeed observed in ALS
  models linked to these genetic forms (3). Protein aggregates are able to induce
  ER stress, which is mediated by the activation of PERK kinase which in turn phosphorylates
  the translational initiation factor eIF2a (eIF2a-P; 4). eIF2a-P has a central role
  in cell stress response, since it represses the translation of most cellular mRNA,
  while promoting the synthesis of proteins that help to overcome stress, including
  chaperones. Dephosphorylation of eIF2a, mediated by the phosphatase GADD34, is then
  essential to turn off this pathway. Drugs such as GSK2606414, Salubrinal, Guanabenz
  and Sephin, that act on this mechanism have been tested in models for their therapeutic
  efficacy, giving conflicting results. Other ways, which are independent from eIF2a
  phosphorylation, might be responsible of translational repression induced by ALS
  proteins. Indeed, FUS and TDP-43 are both RNA-binding proteins involved in RNA transport
  as part of RNA transport granules, and ALS-associated mutations might affect the
  proper localization and translation of specific mRNAs (such as Rac1, GluR1 and Map1b)
  that are important for neuromuscular junction (NMJ) structure and function (5).
  Moreover, C9orf72 RNA foci sequester eIF2a, which might be less available for mRNA
  translation, thus resulting in translational inhibition and stress response (6).
  Finally, both repeat RNA foci and DPRs cause mRNA export defects, thus leading to
  the retention of mRNAs in cell nuclei and their reduced cytoplasmic availability
  (7). DPRs have been also found to directly bind mRNAs, making them less accessible
  to translation initiation factors, thus inhibiting protein translation (8).
