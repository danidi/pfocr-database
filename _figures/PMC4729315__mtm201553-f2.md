caption: Trafficking and neutralization of GAA. (a) Exogenous rhGAA (red) provided
  as ERT binds to the CI-MPR which is endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits. GAA is
  then trafficked to early endosomes which subsequently undergo fusion with lysosomes,
  delivering the enzyme to the proper intracellular location. (b) ERT initiates an
  immune response that results in high-titer anti-GAA antibodies that bind and inhibit
  rhGAA uptake. (c) Cell autonomous correction resulting from gene therapy (AAV-GAA;
  black) allows for proper production of GAA and trafficking from the trans-Golgi
  network to lysosomes, representing the more efficient, endogenous pathway, which
  is protected from antibody-mediated neutralization. (d) GAA trafficking from the
  trans-Golgi network may escape and exocytose into the circulation (cross-correction),
  which may be sequestered by anti-GAA antibodies. AAV, adeno-associated virus; CI-MPR,
  cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor; EE, early endosome; GAA, acid α-glucosidase;
  L, lysosome; TGN, trans-Golgi network.
