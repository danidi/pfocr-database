caption: Known innate anti-viral immune response genes which are down-regulated with
  ART are shown in blue and HIV proteins are shown in green. After viral entry, TRIM5
  binds to the viral capsule and inhibits infection, although it only a weak inhibitor
  of HIV infection. DDX58 primarily binds to dsRNA viruses but may also bind to dsDNA
  in the cytoplasm to activate downstream IRF7. Post HIV RNA-transcription, the HIV
  protein Vif (virion infectivity factor) binds to APOBEC3G targeting it for destruction
  by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway via known interactions with CUL5 and RBX1 and
  recognition of the E3-ligase complex by UBR2. Additional partial innate defenses
  include TRIM22 which blocks the trafficking of HIV Gag protein and ISG16 which interferes
  with viral budding. RT=reverse transcription.
