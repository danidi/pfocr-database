caption: Overview of the intracellular signaling pathways that are linked to Insulin/IGF
  signaling in PDAC. Insulin, IGF-1 and IGF-2 can bind to IRs (IR-A and IR-B), IGF-1R
  and IR/IGF-1R hybrid receptors. Homodimer IR-A receptor has higher binding affinity
  to IGFs compared to the homodimer IR-B receptor. IGF-1R has binding affinity to
  IGF-1, IGF-2 and insulin. IGF-1 is the dominant ligand of IGF-1R. Insulin has a
  stronger binding affinity to IGF-1R compared to IGF-2. IGF-2R has binding affinity
  only for IGF-2. IGF-1R can form hybrid receptor with either IR-A or IR-B. Hybrid
  receptors have higher affinity to IGF-1 and IGF-2 ligands compared to the insulin.
  Thus, IGF-2R can decrease the bioavailability of IGF-2 in the circulation and attenuates
  insulin/IGF signaling axis by clearance of the circulating IGF-2. When insulin and
  IGFs that are free from IGFBPs bind to IR, IGF-1R or IR/IGF-1R hybrid receptors,
  these receptors are autophoshorylated. Depending on the expression level of the
  receptors in different tissues, autophosphorylation of these receptors activates
  different signaling pathways. Autophosphorylation of these tyrosine kinase receptors
  phosphorylates adaptor proteins such as insulin receptor substrate (IRS) and Shc.
  IRS phosphorylation initiates phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-Protein Kinase
  B (PKB)/AKT pathway. On the other hand, binding of adaptor proteins such as Shc
  to the phosphorylated receptors or to the IRS initiates mitogen activated protein
  kinase (Ras-MAPK) signaling pathway. To activate the PI3K-PKB/AKT pathway, the second
  messenger PIP3 should be generated by adding a phosphate group to PIP2. Phosphorylation
  of PIP2 to PIP3 is reversible, and dephosphorylation of PIP3 is regulated by the
  tumor suppressor PTEN. Membrane bound PIP3 triggers activation of the PDK1 protein,
  which phosphorylates AKT. To be fully activated, AKT should be phosphorylated not
  only by PDK1 but also by mTORC2. Activation of AKT induces many different effects
  such as recruitment of glucose transporters to the membrane, glycogen synthesis,
  lipid synthesis, protein synthesis, metabolism, cell survival and apoptosis. Activation
  of the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway is the second pivotal role of insulin/IGF signaling
  axis. To activate Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, first the adaptor proteins should
  bind to other adaptor proteins to activate guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)
  of Ras. Conversion of Ras-GDP to Ras-GTP by GEF activates Ras protein. Activation
  of Ras leads to the induction of MAPK signaling cascade that regulates cell proliferation
