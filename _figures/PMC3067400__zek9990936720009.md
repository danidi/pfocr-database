caption: Model of PHO pathway in two yeast species. See the introduction for a discussion
  of the PHO pathway in S. cerevisiae. The proposed PHO pathway in S. pombe shares
  at least four genes in common with S. cerevisiae, and they are indicated by the
  blue circles. We hypothesize that IP7 levels increase in response to phosphate starvation
  in a manner very similar to that of S. cerevisiae; these increased levels activate
  directly or indirectly the Pho7 protein (yellow circle). There are other genes involved,
  but their predicted role in the pathway is unclear, and they are indicated by empty
  circles. spcc1393.13+ and csk1+ must act upstream of the transcription factors based
  on epistasis experiments, but whether they regulate IP7 levels is unknown. Additionally,
  gpa2+ and pka1+ do not suppress the constitutive phenotypes, so they could be acting
  separately from the pathway, influencing IP7 levels, regulating the activation of
  Pho7 or Snf5 in a redundant manner, or regulating the secretion of Pho1. The genes
  in green circles are hypothesized to be regulating the secretion of Pho1.
