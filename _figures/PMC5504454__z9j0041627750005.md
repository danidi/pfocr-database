caption: Schematic showing the mechanisms by which CO and bilirubin affect VSMC proliferation.
  CO has been reported to 1) activate soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) leading to increased
  cGMP; 2) decrease cytokine-mediated apoptosis; 3) decrease NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1)
  activity; 4) decrease T-type Ca2+ channel activity; 5) increase cell cycle progression
  through the p38 MAPK pathway; and 6) increase caveolin expression. Bilirubin has
  been reported to decrease cell cycle progression through hypophosphorylation of
  retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and by increasing intracellular Ca2+, leading to a decrease
  in the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and altered transcription of genes
  important for VSMC cell cycle control.
