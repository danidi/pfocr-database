caption: Proposed model for NP signaling. Schematic representation of the proposed
  model for NP signaling. NP interacts with IRB. This interaction does not require
  NP phosphorylation but is partially dependent on IR phosphorylation. NP interaction
  with IRB does not interfere with the ability of insulin to stimulate Akt phosphorylation
  and does not affect the degree of Akt phosphorylation at baseline. On the contrary,
  NP prevents insulin ability to stimulate phosphorylation of p70S6K and in the absence
  of insulin, acts itself as a strong inducer of p70S6K phosphorylation through the
  PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in a way that is totally independent of IR phosphorylation,
  activity, and protein expression. Decreased IR phosphorylation and kinase activity
  augment NP signaling, suggesting that binding of IRB to NP may inhibit NP signaling.
  Decreased NP phosphorylation further augments NP signaling through p70S6K. It is,
  therefore, possible that, during starvation, NP independently contributes to stimulate
  p70S6K–dependent insulin transcription in preparation of the next round of glucose
  exposure.
