caption: 'The same cytokines are responsible for metabolic factors leading to cancer
  growth, fatigue, and temperature dysregulation (fever). High levels of TNF-α and
  IL-6 affect blood concentration and makeup leading to fatigue (blue). Increases
  in TNF-α and IL-6 promote metabolic syndrome (green) which induces gluconeogenesis
  and adipocyte production. These bodily changes lead to an upregulation of various
  immune regulators that result in cancer development and growth. These cytokines
  also lead to fever via a PGE-2 dependent pathway (red). Temperature dysregulation
  (feeling cold) has been related to fatigue and may also be associated with cancer
  growth. RBC: red blood cell; COX-2: inducible cyclo-oxygenase, PGE2: prostaglandin
  E2; IGF-1: insulin-like growth factor 1; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; ROS: reactive oxygen species; DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid;
  VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor'
