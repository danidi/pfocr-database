caption: Schematic representation of PROK1 induction of RCAN1-4 and IL-8. Activation
  of the PROKR1 by PROK1 results in the induction of IL-8 and RCAN1-4 expression.
  This occurs via coupling of PROKR1 to Gq protein. Activation of PLCβ by Gqα results
  in the production of IP3 which can then bind to IP3R in the ER and result in an
  efflux of calcium from the ER into the cytoplasm. In addition, the opening of calcium
  channels in the cell surface can also contribute to the increase in Ca2+i. This
  increase in Ca2+i results in calmodulin saturation, which in turn activates calcineurin.
  Activated calcineurin then dephosphorylates cytoplasmic NFAT. Dephosphorylated NFAT
  can then migrate to the nucleus and bind to binding motifs in the promoter region
  of RCAN1-4 and IL-8 and induce their transcription. NFAT-induced transcription of
  IL-8 occurs in conjunction with AP-1. The accumulation of RCAN1-4 protein results
  in its binding to calcineurin and the inhibition of NFAT dephosphorylation by calcineurin
  which prevents further expression of IL-8 and RCAN1-4. Gqα = Gq protein alpha subunit,
  βγ = G protein beta gamma subunits, PLCβ = phopholipase C beta, IP3 = inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate,
  IP3R = IP3 receptor, ER = endoplasmic reticulum, Ca2+i = intracellular ionized calcium,
  Cam = calmodulin, CnB = calcineurin regulatory subunit, CnA = calcineurin catalytic
  subunit, NFAT = nuclear factor of activated T-cells, AP-1 = activator protein 1.
