caption: Non-melanoma skin cells, such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous
  cell carcinoma (SCC), express receptors for IL-17 and IL-22 and Nardinocchi et al.
  [] show that these factors can increase tumor cell proliferation and migration in
  vitro. The enhanced proliferation and migration of BCC and SCC cell lines in response
  to IL-17 and IL-22 is associated with the induction of IL-6 and IL-8. The recruitment
  of myeloid cells (CD11c+) may constitute one of the pro-tumorigenic mechanisms of
  action of Th17 cells. Th17 and Th22 cells are depicted in the figure, but the cellular
  source of their signature cytokines in skin cancer remains to be determined. Using
  xenograft assays, Nardinocchi et al. show that these cytokines also accelerate tumor
  growth in vivo. IL-17 treatment of the SCC cell line CAL 27 induced NF-κB signaling
  in these cells and IL-22 treatment activated the Erk1/2 and STAT3 signaling pathway,
  which may be responsible for tumor progression.
