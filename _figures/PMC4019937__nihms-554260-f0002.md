caption: The synthesis of fatty acids in archaea is proposed to proceed through essentially
  the same steps as in FAS I or FAS II mechanisms (see ), but by using CoA instead
  of the acyl-carrier protein, as in the β-oxidation of fatty acids (see ). Enzymes
  that catalyze the reduction (HDH and ACD) and dehydratation (ECH) steps are proposed
  to be the same as those involved in the bacterial β-oxidation pathway, whereas initiation
  of the cycle and fatty acid chain elongation are proposed to be catalyzed by various
  paralogs of the archaeal acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase. As discussed in the text,
  the presence of several paralogs of the latter enzyme in many archaeal genomes (denoted
  here as AACT1 and AACT2) might reflect their specificity towards chains of particular
  lengths. As an example, enzymes of Aeropyrum pernix K1, proposed to catalyze the
  respective steps, are indicated by their genome locus tags (GenBank accession no.
  BA000002).
