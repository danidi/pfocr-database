caption: 'Menadione decreases DNA-binding activity of the AhR–ARNT complex thus reducing
  positive input, and at the same time, activates Oct-1, which inhibits expression
  of AhR-dependent genes. red triangle—Benzo(α)pyrene, green oval with brown, blue,
  yellow and red ovals inside—inactive AhR in complex with its protein partners, green
  oval with a triangle inside—AhR activated by benzo(α)pyrene, pink oval—ARNT, yellow
  circle—menadione, blue oval—mediator protein, turquoise–light gray oval—Oct-1, NRE:
  negative regulatory element, XRE: xenobiotic-responsive element, AhR: aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor, ARNT: aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator.'
