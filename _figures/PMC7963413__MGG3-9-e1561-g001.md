caption: Cascade of events triggered by the overexpression of RB1CC1 in SCZ pathogenesis.
  Duplication‐induced overexpression of RB1CC1/FIP200 inhibits FAK, which physiologically
  regulates cell spreading and motility upon FAK‐Src signaling complex formation and
  paxillin/ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation. Upregulated RB1CC1 also blocks PYK2
  tyrosine kinase activity upon PI3K/Akt pathway, which promotes cell survival and
  proliferation, and GSK3 signaling, which instead controls neurogenesis, neuronal
  polarization, and axon growth during brain development. Importantly, PYK2 indirectly
  enhances paxillin activation through ERK1/2 MAP kinases. Finally, overexpressed
  RB1CC1 interferes with TSC1–TSC2 complex assembly/stabilization, a critical negative
  regulator of mTORC1. MTORC1 controls anabolic processes to promote cell growth and,
  importantly, strongly prevents autophagy initiation by regulating the activity of
  the ULK1 complex that is required for the formation of autophagosomes. Thus, the
  lack of mTORC1 inhibition by TSC1/TSC2 finally leads to autophagy blockade and neurocytotoxicity
