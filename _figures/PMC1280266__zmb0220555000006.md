caption: Pab1p mediates MFA2 translation regulation in a p38 MAPK/Hog1p-regulated
  pathway. p38 MAPK/Hog1p mediates translation regulation through the MFA2 3′-UTR
  in response to the presence of glucose medium growth conditions. In glucose-grown
  cultures, the 3′-UTR recruits Pub1p and Pab1p, which can interact with the eIF4G/cap
  complex as well. Pab1p may under these conditions be recruited to the AU element
  and interact with the eIF4G/cap complex. Such an mRNP would prevent the cap/poly(A)
  interaction that may be necessary to promote translation. Furthermore, the Pub1p-bound
  message may be localized to translationally silenced locations in the cell as described
  for the mammalian homolog TIA-1. Alternatively, in nonglucose conditions p38 MAPK/Hog1p
  may modulate Pub1p and Pab1p indirectly through unknown factors (represented as
  “?”) to prevent their recruitment to the MFA2 3′-UTR. The cap complex would not
  be involved in forming a translationally silenced complex through interactions with
  the 3′-UTR-3′-UTR-bound factors. This may be feasible due to the truncated form
  of Pab1p, the 53-kDa form, binding to the MFA2 3′-UTR instead of the full-length
  form (Pab1p). Pab1p may be modified such that the full-length form binds the poly(A)
  tail instead of the 3′-UTR, permitting a translationally favorable mRNP complex.
  Additionally, in the absence of Pub1p bound to the 3′-UTR, the transcript may be
  mobilized onto polysomes (depicted as 40S and 60S).
