caption: After entering a cell, viral genetic material may be recognized by one or
  more of the host’s PRRs. These include RLRs, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cGAS.
  Recognition by one or more of these PRRs triggers a signalling cascade that culminates
  in the transcription and subsequent generation of IFNs. Different viruses have evolved
  to antagonize these pathways at virtually all stages, indicated by blunt end arrows.
  Solid arrows indicate direct pathway connections. Dashed arrows indicate signal
  cascade components present in vivo but not shown for space concerns. Asterisks indicate
  viral antagonism by an unknown mechanism. See Table  for specific mechanisms at
  each stage. LGP2, laboratory of genetics and physiology protein 2; MDA-5, melanoma
  differentiation-associated protein 5; TRIF, TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing
  IFN-β; IKK-ε, IκB kinase-ε; HAV, hepatitis A virus; hCoV-NL63, human coronavirus
  NL63; PEDV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; GTOV, Guanarito virus; JUNV, Junin
  virus; MAVC, Machupo virus; SABV, Sabia virus; BDV, Borna disease virus; SFTSV,
  severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus; JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus;
  ANDV, Andes virus; SNV, Sin Nombre virus.
