caption: MicroRNA-gene interaction networks of the MAPK signaling pathway. Blue nodes
  represent microRNAs co-expressed in microvesicles derived from K562 cells and in
  K562 cells, while red nodes represent their target mRNAs. The edges represent the
  regulatory effect of microRNAs on mRNAs. miR-16, hsa-miR-17 and hsa-miR-15 family
  (miR-15a and miR-15b) were the most targeted mRNAs in the MAPK pathway (all exhibited
