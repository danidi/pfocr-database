caption: Summary and integration of the main results. Metabolomic measurements reveal
  an overall decrease in substrate concentration in uterine luminal fluid recovered
  from pregnant (Preg) compared to control cyclic (Con) cows on day 7 post oestrus.
  (1) Concentrations of two metabolites 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE, associated to the
  lipoxygenases pathway, were significantly greater in the Preg group. Transcripts
  for lipoxygenases were up- (ALOX12) and downregulated (ALOX15B) in the uterotubal
  junction of Preg animals, suggesting an endometrial origin of regulation of Lipoxygenases-derived
  metabolites in ULF. (2) Glycine and sarcosine were significantly lower in abundance
  in ULF recovered from Preg compared to Con cows. A downregulation of SLC6A9 (a Glycine
  transporter) transcripts was found in the Preg endometrial tissue, that was consistent
  with the lower Glycine concentration in ULF. Exposure to a day 7 embryo modulates
  the concentration of (3) phospholipids and (4) acylcarnitines concentration in ULF.
  We propose that metabolite composition of the ULF changes in response to a pre-hatching
  embryo in vivo.
