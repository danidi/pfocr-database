caption: MiRNA regulation of skin fibrosis in epithelial and fibroblast cells. MiRNA-21
  and miRNA-200 modulate skin fibrosis by interacting with transforming growth factor
  (TGF)-beta signaling to regulate the transition of the epithelial cell into fibroblast
  cell (epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or transformation, or EMT). MiRNA-200
  inhibits PTEN to promote EMT. MiRNA-200 inhibits the transcription factors, Zeb1
  and Zeb2, to antagonize EMT; miRNA-200 is also suggested to inhibit TGF-beta directly.
  Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta interacts with the type I (BR1) and type II
  (BR2) receptors, leading to activation of intracellular Smad2 and Smad3. Smad2 and
  Smad3 form a complex with Smad4 and regulate the expression of collagen. Smad7 is
  a recognized antagonist of TGF-beta profibrotic effects. Various miRNAs modulate
  skin fibrosis by regulating the TGF-beta signaling pathway, directly regulating
  collagen synthesis and degradation, and modulating fibroblast proliferation.MMP,
  matrix metalloproteinase; MAPK, mitogen activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular
  receptor kinase
