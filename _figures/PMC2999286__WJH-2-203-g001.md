caption: The involvement of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling in lipid
  metabolism. The UPR pathway through inositol-requiring 1α (IRE1α)/XBP1 or activating
  transcription factor 6 is involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) expansion by enhancing
  phospholipid biosynthesis under ER stress conditions. The IRE1α/XBP1 pathway also
  regulates lipogenesis by inducing expression of the key enzymes required for triglyceride
  synthesis under metabolic stress. Additionally, the IRE1α/XBP1 UPR branch can drive
  C/EBPα expression, facilitating adipogenesis and possibly lipogenesis. The UPR pathway
  through PERK/eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2α can stimulate expression
  of the key lipogenic regulators C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, and PPARγ, promoting lipogenesis
  under metabolic stress.
