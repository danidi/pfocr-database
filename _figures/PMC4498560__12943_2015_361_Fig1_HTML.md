caption: 'HPVs infect host epithelial cells (keratinocytes) by interacting with different
  cell surface receptors such as integrin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs).
  The HPVs replicate themselves using the host cell replication apparatus to express
  E6/E7/E5 oncoproteins to immortalize the infected cells not only by inhibiting tumour
  suppressors p53 and Rb and decreasing apoptosis, but also importantly by activating
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. All these processes enhance cell proliferation
  leading to the carcinogenesis. Solid line: stimulatory influence; Dashed line: inhibitory
  influence; ⊗: defective process.'
