caption: a Mechanism of action of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and approved
  systemic therapies. The testes produce 90–95% of the total circulating testosterone,
  while the adrenal glands produce the remainder of the circulating androgens. Androgens,
  usually dihydrotestosterone (DHT), bind to the androgen receptor (AR), dissociating
  chaperone proteins. Ligand-bound AR molecules dimerise and translocate to the nucleus
  where they bind to androgen response elements and act as transcription factors to
  signal downstream targets. Apart from acting as AR antagonists, second-generation
  antiandrogens, such as enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide, also prevent
  the translocation of AR to the nucleus. Abiraterone acetate, as a cytochrome P450
  17A1 (CYP17) and α-hydroxylase inhibitor, largely prevents androgen biosynthesis.
  The detailed sites of action of abiraterone are not depicted in this diagram. GnRH
  Gonadotropin-releasing hormone, ACTH adrenocorticotrophic hormone, LH luteinising
  hormone. b Conventional treatment pathway of prostate cancer. mHSPC Metastatic hormone-sensitive
  prostate cancer, nmCRPC non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, mCRPC
  metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. *Cabazitaxel can be given in first-line
  treatment of mCRPC if docetaxel is given in the hormone-sensitive setting. Dates
  in parenthesis indicate month of US Food and Drug Administration approval; only
  drugs approved since 2018 have date of approval indicated
