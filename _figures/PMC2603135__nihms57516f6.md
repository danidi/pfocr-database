caption: The ATM pathway map on the left was based on http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~spike/images/1.png.
  Shown in the map are two proteins, p53 (TP53) and BRCA1 (highlighted in red boxes),
  directly interact with ATM (green box) as its downstream signaling proteins. The
  right diagram depicts the ATM-p53 mediated and radiation-induced DNA repair pathway
  involving RRM2. The RRM2’s connections to p53 and HDAC1 were derived from the network
  analysis and were consistent with the expression data in this study. Both BRCA1
  and HDAC1 are known to be involved in DNA repair. The interactions between p53 and
  RRM2 proteins and between HDAC1 and RRM2 gene promoter have been reported in literature.
  The red colored proteins are observed as differentially expressed in response to
  radiation from this study. Solid arrows indicate direct binding, and dotted ones
  indicate multi-step processes.
