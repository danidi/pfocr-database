caption: (a) Overview of campesterol biosynthesis pathway in Y. lipolytica. Campesterol
  was produced via expression of DHCR7 and disruption of ERG5 based on the ergosterol
  synthesis pathway in Y. lipolytica. Acetyl-CoA, the precursor of campesterol, is
  provided either by glycolysis from hydrophilic carbon sources (i.e. glucose and
  glycerol), or by β-oxidization from hydrophobic materials (e.g. oil). Meanwhile,
  acetyl-CoA from either hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates can also generate cellular
  fatty acids and subsequently triacylglycerols (TAG), consisting of the de novo and
  the ex novo lipid accumulation process in Y. lipolytica respectively. (b) The method
  for expression of DHCR7 and disruption of ERG5 at the same time. The middle section
  of gene ERG5 was replaced by the DHCR7 expression cassette (URA3-EXP1p-DHCR7-XPR2t)
  in chromosome A. (c) GC-TOF/MS profile of the wild-type Y. lipolytica. ATCC 201249
  and campesterol producing strain SyBE_Yl1070030. Wild-type strain (blue) showed
  an ergosterol peak at 21 min, while Y. lipolytica SyBE_Yl1070028 (red) showed a
  campesterol peak at 21.7 min.
