  cytokines such as TNF, IL‐6, and pro‐IL‐1β. In addition, NF‐κB signaling upregulates
  NLRP3 expression (priming step). In the activation step of the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  diverse stimuli such as nigericin (ionophore), extracellular ATP, and medically

  that acts independently of its kinase activity. NLRP3 recruits the adapter protein
  ASC and the protease caspase‐1, which drives maturation of pro‐IL‐1β and pro‐IL‐18
  into their respective active forms. At the same time, caspase‐1 cleaves GSDMD to
  release GSDMD‐N that forms GSDMD pores into the plasma membrane and drives pyroptosis,
  causing the release of various DAMPs such as IL‐1β, IL‐18, IL‐1α, and HMGB1. In
  the non‐canonical NLRP3 pathway, intracellular sensing of LPS activates caspase‐4/11
  (human/mouse) that cleaves GSDMD, which induces pyroptosis, consequently activating
  the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL‐1β maturation through K+‐efflux. NLRP1 undergoes auto‐catalytic
  processing in its FIIND domain. Proteasomal degradation of its auto‐inhibitory N‐terminus
  is considered a primary requirement of NLRP1 inflammasome activation. In rodents,
  cleavage on the N‐terminal part of the NLRP1b protein by anthrax lethal toxin or
  IpaH7.8 allows the C‐terminal CARD domain to engage caspase‐1 for activation. In
  addition, mouse NLRP1b and human NLRP1 are activated by DPP8/DPP9 inhibitors. Activation
  of the NLRC4 inflammasome requires NAIPs that recognize T3SS inner rod proteins,
  needle proteins, or flagellin. In case of NLRP1b and NLRC4, caspase‐1 can directly
  be recruited independently of the adapter ASC. dsDNA of microbial or host origin
  in the cytosolic compartment activates AIM2, which requires ASC to activate caspase‐1.
