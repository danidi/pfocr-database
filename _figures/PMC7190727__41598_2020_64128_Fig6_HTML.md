caption: Identification of key PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway downregulated proteins in
  TurNP + EP compared to TurNP in MDA-MB-231 cells. Proteins from GO term “PI3K-Akt
  Signaling Pathway” from KEGGpathway analysis were uploaded to the Cytoscape 3.6.1
  software and matched to the PI3K-Akt Signaling Pathway using the WikiPathway app
  (beta), with the degree of shading representing the fold change.
