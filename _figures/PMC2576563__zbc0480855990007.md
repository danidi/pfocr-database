caption: Schematic representation of tight regulation of MUC5AC mucin induction  by
  pneumolysin via PAK4-JNK and MKP1 signaling pathways. As indicated, the  PAK4-JNK
  signaling pathway negatively regulates MUC5AC induction by  recombinant pneumolysin
  in a TLR4-dependent manner. Interestingly induction of  MKP1 appears to be crucial
  for inhibiting JNK activation. Our data thereby  unveil a complex signaling mechanism
  underlying tight regulation of MUC5AC  mucin by pneumococcal pneumolysin.
