caption: The initial phosphorylation of dietary fructose in the liver is largely catalyzed
  by fructokinase C (a), which is not regulated by hepatic energy status. This results
  in unregulated fructose uptake and metabolism by the liver. The excess substrate
  leads to increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL)(b). DNL increases the intra-hepatic
  lipid supply directly, via synthesis of fatty acids (c), and indirectly, by inhibiting
  fatty acid oxidation (d). Increased levels of intra-hepatic lipid content promote
  very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) production and secretion (e). This leads to
  increased levels of circulating TG and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (dyslipidemia
  (f)), risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) (g). Increased levels of hepatic
  lipids may also promote hepatic insulin resistance by increasing levels of diacylglycerol,
  which may activate novel protein kinase C (nPKC) and lead to serine phosphorylation
  (serine P) of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and
  impaired insulin action (h). Due to selective insulin resistance, DNL is even more
  strongly activated in the insulin resistant liver DNL (i), which has the potential
  to generate a vicious cycle (circular arrows). This cycle would be expected to further
  exacerbate VLDL production and secretion via increased intra-hepatic lipid supply.
  Hepatic insulin resistance also exacerbates VLDL production/secretion (j) by increasing
  apolipoprotein (apo)B availability and apoCIII synthesis, and by up-regulating microsomal
  triglyceride-transfer protein expression (MTP). This exacerbates and sustains exposure
  to circulating TG, leading to muscle lipid accumulation (k), impaired insulin signaling,
  and whole body insulin resistance (l). The fructokinase-catalyzed phosphorylation
  of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate, which results in conversion of adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and a depletion of inorganic phosphate, leads
  to uric acid production via the purine degradation pathway (m). High levels of uric
  acid are associated and may contribute to increased risk for development of fatty
  liver (n), CVD (o), and metabolic syndrome. Fructose exposure in the intestine (p)
  and liver (q), and fructose-induced increases of visceral adipose (r) may promote
  inflammatory responses that further promote liver lipid accumulation (s) and/or
  impair hepatic insulin signaling (t).
