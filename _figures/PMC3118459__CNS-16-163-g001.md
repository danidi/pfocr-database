caption: 'Glutamate and DA in basal ganglia function in intact brain and during HD.
  Left is a simplified schematic showing normal basal ganglia circuitry. Glutamate
  inputs are represented in red, GABA in blue and DA in green. Under normal conditions
  (left), the thalamus is inhibited by GPi and SNr GABA projections. In early HD (middle),
  cortical dysfunction induces excessive glutamate release in the striatum. Abnormally
  elevated striatal glutamate and DA levels trigger selective dysfunction of enkephalin‐containing
  MSNs. Imbalance between the direct and indirect pathways induces hyperkinesia via
  two pathways: (1) Selective dysfunction/degeneration (dashed lines) of enkephalin‐containing
  MSNs leads to decreased release of GABA in the GPe and to its disinhibition. In
  turn, overactivation of GABA neurons of the GPe leads to increased release of GABA
  and to inhibition of STN which decreases glutamate release and decreases activity
  of the GPi and SNr. (2) Overactivation of the direct pathway MSNs (by abnormal DA
  modulation and/or excessive glutamate) leads to increased release of GABA and to
  inhibition of GPi and SNr. Together, alterations in direct and indirect pathways
  in early HD induce inhibition of GPi and SNr GABA neurons and to a decreased release
  of GABA in their output structure, the thalamus. Disinhibition of the thalamus is
  responsible for abnormal movements. In late HD (right), corticostriatal and nigrostriatal
  inputs progressively degenerate, leading to decreased striatal glutamate and DA
  release. Low striatal glutamate and DA levels trigger dysfunction of both direct
  and indirect pathway MSNs. Imbalance between the direct and indirect pathways induces
  hyperkinesia and hypokinesia via two pathways: (1) Alterations in the indirect pathway
  are similar to early HD and lead to hyperkinetic movements. (3) Dysfunction/degeneration
  of direct pathway MSNs induces decreased release of GABA and disinhibition of GPi
  and SNr. Increased activity in GPi and SNr leads to inhibition of the thalamus and
  hypokinesia. Depending on the stage of dysfunction of direct and indirect pathway
  MSNs, activity in the basal ganglia could result in hypokinesia or hyperkinesia
  and would explain why some symptomatic patients display both chorea and akinesia.
