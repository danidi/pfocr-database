caption: LTCCs are voltage-gated Ca2+ channels that form heteromeric complexes on
  the neuronal membrane and are composed of a voltage-sensitive Ca2+ pore forming
  Cav or α1 subunit and auxiliary β, α2δ and γ subunits (, ). Two LTCC subunits have
  been found in the brain, the Cav1.2 (α1C) and Cav1.3 (α1D) subunit (). Activation
  of LTCCs results in influx of intracellular Ca2+ and activates either the Ca2+/calmodulin
  (CaM)-dependent kinase (CaMK) or Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphatase pathways (, ; ;
  , ; ; ; ). The two primary kinase pathways activated by LTCCs are the Ca2+/CaM kinase
  (CaMK) and the MAP (ERK1/2) kinase pathways, and the primary phosphatase pathway
  is the calcineurin (PP2B) pathway. In the VTA, NAc and dorsal striatum both these
  pathways activate intraneuronal mediators involved in psychostimulant actions that
  leads to the downstream activation of the transcription factor CREB (cyclic AMP
  response element-binding protein) and CREB-mediated gene expression, which are critical
  mediators of psychostimulant-induced neuronal plasticity (; , , ).
