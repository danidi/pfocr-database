caption: Model depicting direct and indirect regulation of clock output genes involved
  in conidiation. (See the text for a full explanation of the developmental pathway
  and the clock-regulated events.) Once a day, the endogenous circadian clock signals
  the production of aerial hyphae from vegetative hyphae (solid arrow). Independent
  of the time of day, exogenous environmental signals can trigger the same event (dashed
  arrow). Both pathways eventually lead to the production of conidia. Conidia are
  formed by budding of the aerial hyphae involving the formation of minor constriction
  chains, requiring the products of acon-2 and fld, and major constriction chains,
  requiring the products of fl and acon-3. The csp-1 and csp-2 genes are required
  for conidial separation. The genes shown to be regulated by the clock independent
  of the developmental pathway are linked to the clock by solid arrows. The epistatic
  relationships between the key developmental regulators and developmentally induced
  genes (, , ) are depicted by dashed arrows. Rhythmic fl expression requires its
  upstream developmental regulator, ACON-2 (shown as a heavy solid arrow). A solid
  line was not drawn to acon-2, since it is not known if acon-2 is rhythmically expressed.
  The fl gene is shown to act during the production of aerial hyphae and after the
  formation of minor constriction chains.
