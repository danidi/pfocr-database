caption: Proposed mechanism of maternal exercise attenuated neurocognitive impairment
  in offspring born to mothers exposed to sevoflurane during mid-pregnancy. Fetal
  sevoflurane exposure causes histone hypoacetylation, an epigenetic change that leads
  to more condensed chromatin structure less conducive to transcription of the target
  genes BDNF. BDNF is crucial for synaptic plasticity. BDNF binds to TrkB, activating
  downstream Akt signal pathway. Maternal exercise triggers histone acetylation and
  activates BDNF/TrkB/Akt signaling. Maternal exercise has neuroprotective effects
  in mitigating sevoflurane-induced impairments on dendritic spine formation and cognitive
  functions. Maternal infusion of ANA-12 reverses the beneficial effects of exercise.
