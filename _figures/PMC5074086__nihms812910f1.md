caption: 'After entering the cell, glucose is phosphorylated by HK1 and then most
  of it is degraded via glycolysis (A) to pyruvate. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria,
  where it is decarboxylated and oxidized by PDH enzyme complex to acetyl-CoA, the
  main source of energy for Krebs cycle. After entering the Krebs cycle, acetyl-CoA
  condensates with oxaloacetate to produce citrate, catalyzed by CS. Citrate either
  stays in the mitochondria and is converted to isocitrate by ACO, or is exported
  to the cytoplasm to be used as a precursor for lipid biosynthesis (via conversion
  by ACLY). Isocitrate is subsequently decarboxylated to α-ketoglutarate by IDH. α-ketoglutarate
  is then either converted to succinyl-CoA by α-KGDH complex or exits the mitochondria
  and serves as a precursor for amino acid biosynthesis. Succinyl-CoA is either transformed
  to succinate in the reaction catalyzed by SUCLG or can be utilized for porphyrin
  biosynthesis. Succinate is then oxidized to fumarate by SDH, which also represents
  complex II of the ETC (dotted circle/ellipse). Fumarate is hydrated to malate by
  FH and, finally, malate is oxidized by MDH to restore oxaloacetate. In the Krebs
  cycle, hydrogen atoms reduce NAD+ and FAD to NADH + H+ and FADH2 respectively, which
  feed the ETC to produce ATP. The Krebs cycle as a biosynthetic pathway produces
  intermediates that leave the cycle (cataplerosis) to be converted primarily to glutamate,
  GABA, glutamine and aspartate, and also to glucose derivatives and fatty acids.
  A minor part of glycolytic glucose-6-phosphate is redirected to the pentose phosphate
  pathway (B) to produce ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH, which will be used to synthetize
  nucleotides. The triose phosphates can be used for lipids and phospholipids. In
  normal cells, amino acids follow the physiological turnover of the proteins and
  little part is used to synthetize the nucleotide bases. After deamination, the remainder
  of amino acids are used for energy production.When Krebs cycle ketoacids are consumed
  or removed, they need to be replaced to permit the Krebs cycle sustained function.
  This process is called anaplerosis and is tightly coupled with cataplerosis ().
  The anaplerotic reactions of Krebs cycle include the catabolism of essential amino
  acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,
  tryptophan, and valine) as well as odd chain fatty acids. Anaplerotic reactions
  provide the Krebs cycle with fumarate, oxaloacetate, α-ketoglutarate, malate, and
  succinyl-CoA. Oxaloacetate is formed via carboxylation of pyruvate by PC, from malate
  through oxidation by malate dehydrogenase, or by transamination of aspartate. Pyruvate
  can also be decarboxylated to malate. Glutaminolysis (C) serves as the source of
  the Krebs cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate and oxidation of odd chain fatty acids
  or metabolism of methionine and isoleucine provide succinyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can
  be replenished from β-oxidation of fatty acids (D).Abbreviations: α-KGDH, alpha-ketoglutarate
