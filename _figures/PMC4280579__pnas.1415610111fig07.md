caption: Integrated model of NDV-3–mediated protective efficacy versus MRSA in murine
  SSSI. We hypothesize that the NDV-3 immunogen (rAls3p-N) is recognized through toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) or like sensors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  on antigen-presenting cells (APCs; 1). Presentation of processed rAls3 to naïve
  T cells in the context of a TGF-β1, IL-6, and TNF-α cytokine milieu (2) stimulates
  immune polarization bias to Th22/Th17 via the signal transduction activator of transcription-3
  (STAT3; 3). Supporting the Th17 pathway is the elaboration of CC chemokines and
  IL-23 that recruit/expand antigen-specific Th17 T cells to sites of infection (4).
  There, immunogen-stimulated Th22 and Th17 cells elaborate IL-17A and IL-22 (5),
  which serve to activate two parallel arms of immune effector function—induction
  of β-defensins and other cutaneous host defense peptides (6) as prompted by IL-22—and
  CXC chemokine ligand generation (e.g., keratinocyte chemoattractant in mice or its
  ortholog CXCL8 in humans) from fibroblasts or epithelial cells (7), in turn recruiting/activating
  neutrophils or other leukocytes to foci of infection (8). Thus, the current findings
  support the hypothesis that NDV-3 stimulates an antigen-specific and highly coordinated
  immune response that is protective against SSSI due to MRSA.
