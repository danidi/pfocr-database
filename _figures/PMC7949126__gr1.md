caption: Sphingolipid metabolism. Shown are the pathways that regulate sphingolipid
  levels in mammalian cells. As illustrated, the de novo synthetic pathway uses serine
  palmitoyl-CoA-acyltransferase (SPT) to produce 3-ketosphinganine (3-keto-dihydrosphingosine),
  which is converted to sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) through the action of 3-ketosphinganine
  reductase (KSR). Sphinganine is converted to ceramides via sequential reactions
  employing one of the ceramide synthases (CerS) and ceramide desaturase (DES). The
  salvage pathway involves the conversion of sphingosine 1-P to sphingosine by sphingosine-1-phosphate
  lyase (S1PPase) and the CerS-mediated production of ceramide from sphingosine. An
  alternate pathway for generation of ceramides is via phosphatase (Phos) action on
  ceramide 1-P, whereas ceramides and sphingomyelins are interconverted through the
  activities of sphingomyelinase (SMase) and sphingomyelin synthase (SMS). Ceramides
  and glucosylceramides also are interconverted, using the enzymes glucosylceramide
  synthase (GCS) and glucosyl ceramidase (GCase), and glucosylceramides are used as
  substrates for the synthesis of other hexosylceramides, as well as cerebrosides
  and gangliosides. Other enzymes involved in sphingolipid metabolism include ceramidase
  (CDase), ceramide kinase (CK), and sphingosine kinase (SK).
