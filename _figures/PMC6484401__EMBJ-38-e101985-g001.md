caption: Illustration showing the molecular mechanisms involved in recruiting LUBAC
  to Htt aggregates and the functional implications of this activity on cellular function.
  LUBAC is recruited to Htt aggregates through a mechanism involving the AAA+ ATPase
  p97. Once localized, LUBAC poly‐ubiquitinates Htt aggregates to influence multiple
  aspects of aggregate biology. 1) LUBAC‐dependent poly‐ubiquitination reduces aggregate
  levels through a process likely involving increased targeting of Htt subunits to
  the proteasome. 2) Linear Ub chains on Htt aggregates can recruit proteins such
  as NEMO that bind to linear M1 Ub linkages to remodel the aggregate surface and
  potentially induce localized signaling. 3) LUBAC‐dependent ubiquitination shields
  aggregates to prevent aberrant interactions with low complexity transcription factors
  such as SP1. Blocking SP1 interactions with aggregates increases SP1 transcriptional
  activity, which includes the regulation of LUBAC subunits such as HOIP and SHARPIN.
  4) LUBAC‐dependent linear ubiquitination of Htt aggregates suppresses phosphorylation
  of c‐Jun, reflecting reduced signaling through the JNK/c‐Jun signaling pathway.
