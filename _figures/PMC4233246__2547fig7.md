caption: A model of how a p66β/Sufu complex inhibits Gli transcriptional activity
  and a Mycbp/Gli complex enhances Gli transcriptional activity in the nucleus. In
  the absence of Hh signaling, Sufu-bound Gli (such as Gli2) is inactive, since Sufu
  recruits p66β (and other proteins) to block Gli-mediated Hh target gene expression.
  Hh pathway activation leads to dissociation of Sufu/p66β from Gli, releasing Gli
  inhibition and priming Gli protein for activating Hh targets. p66β may recruit components
  of the NuRD repressor complex or other players to inhibit Gli-mediated Hh responses.
  We propose that Mycbp is recruited to the Sufu/Gli protein complex in the absence
  of Hh signaling but remains inactive. How Mycbp is inactivated is not known. Upon
  Hh pathway activation, Sufu/p66β dissociation from Gli (likely Gli1/2) enhances
  Mycbp/Gli interaction and enables Mycbp to promote Gli protein activity and Hh target
  gene expression. The molecular mechanism by which Mycbp enhances Hh responses is
  unclear. Post-translational modifications of Sufu, Gli, p66β, and Mycbp could influence
  their interactions and confer important properties of Hh responses. It is also possible
  that other activators/repressors also control nuclear Gli activity and exhibit functional
  redundancy with p66β/Mycbp. (R) Repressor; (FL) full-length.
