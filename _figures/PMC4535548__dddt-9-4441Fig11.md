caption: 'EIF2 signaling pathway was regulated when THP-1-derived macrophages were
  treated with the novel NP-siRNA liposomes at 12.5 μg/mL for 24 hours.Notes: The
  proteomic response was determined by SILAC, and the pathways were analyzed using
  IPA. The figure shows that ERK1/2 was upregulated in the EIF2 signaling pathway.
  Red indicates an upregulation; green indicates a downregulation. The intensity of
  green and red colors indicates the degree of down- or upregulation. Solid arrow
  indicates direct interaction, and dashed arrow indicates indirect interaction.Abbreviations:
  EIF2, eukaryotic initiation factor 2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; IPA, ingenuity pathway analysis; NP, nanoparticle; SILAC,
  stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture; siRNA, small interfering
  RNA.'
