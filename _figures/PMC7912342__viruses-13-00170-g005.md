caption: 'NLRP3 Inflammasomes signaling pathway. A two-step signal for NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation. The priming signal (left panel) is induced by PRRs, IFNAR or TNFR activation
  that further leads to the activation of NF-κB (p65/p50) and its subsequent translocation
  to the nucleus where it triggers the expression of NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, pro-IL-1β,
  and pro-IL-18. Following the priming step, an adaptor protein (ASC), recruits NLRP3
  and pro-Caspase-1, forming a complex called the NLRP3 inflammasome (right panel;
  activation signal). Next, activation of NLRP3 triggered by multiple signals including
  PAMPs/DAMPS, disruption of potassium homeostasis, lysosomal rupture, mitochondrial
  damage and a mitotic factor NEK7, leads to the activation of Caspase-1. Activated
  caspase-1 induces secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and regulates
  pyroptosis, an inflammatory programmed cell death. Capasase-1 activates propyroptotic
  factor gasdermin D, which is responsible for forming pores on the membrane of infected
  cells, facilitating the release of IL-1β/IL-18 and inducing pyroptosis. ‘P’ indicates
  phosphorylation. WNV: West Nile virus; IAV: Influenza A virus; HCV: Hepatitis C
  virus; MV: Measles virus; HIV: Human immunodeficiency virus.'
