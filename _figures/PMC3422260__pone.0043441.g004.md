caption: The green nodes denote high frequency microRNAs. The red nodes denote high
  frequency genes in both methylation and mRNA dysfunctional sets. The yellow nodes
  indicate high frequency genes in mRNA dysfunctional sets only. There is no specific
  high frequency gene in methylation dysfunctional sets. The white nodes indicate
  non-high frequency genes. The black edges show interactions from the KEGG pathway
  “hsa05223 Non-small cell lung cancer”. The green edges show regulation by high frequency
  microRNAs on their target genes.
