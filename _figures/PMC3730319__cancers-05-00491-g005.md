caption: The pathway network of the metabolome and transcriptome. Metabolomics pathways
  inferred under hypoxia treatment were identified from our study. Transcriptomics
  pathways inferred under hypoxia treatment were obtained from the published study.Pathways
  on the right side of this figure including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and pyruvate
  metabolism are the major changes in the metabolomic responses, and pathways on the
  left side including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and pyruvate metabolism are the transcriptomic
  responses. Consistent pathways are “glycolysis/gluneogenesis”, “pyruvate metabolism”,
  “purine metabolism” and “arginine and proline metabolism”.Each rectangle represents
  one metabolism with the simplified pathway route. Pathways are placed according
  to the KEGG global metabolism map and connected according to the shared metabolites
  or enzymes. Mapped enzymes or metabolites are highlighted with red color. The widths
  of the edges represent the number of shared metabolites or enzymes between each
  two pathways pair. TCA and urea cycle are also placed on the map as two circles.
