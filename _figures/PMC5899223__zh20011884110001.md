caption: Classification of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). It is now widely accepted
  that classification of TMA according to etiology (rather than clinical features)
  is a more useful guide to prognosis and treatment. TMA represents a final common
  pathway in many disease processes (). PLTs, platelets; HUS, hemolytic uremic syndrome;
  AKI, acute kidney injury; CNI, calcineurin inhibitors; SLE, systemic lupus erythematosus;
  APLS, anti-phospholipid syndrome; STEC, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli;
  TTP, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura; HELLP, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes,
  low platelet count syndrome.
