caption: Upon stimulation with CCR5 Ab Pos, the CCR5 receptor associates with G protein
  and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) induce receptor phosphorylation. β-arrestin1/2
  can initiate desensitization, thus contributing to the internalization of CCR5 by
  clathrin-coated pits. In particular, β-arrestin2 accumulates in protein complexes
  with activated CCR5 and leads to activation and retention in the cytoplasm of MAP
  kinase ERK1. These events contribute to the formation of a CCR5 signalosome with
  β-arrestin2 and ERK1 into the cytosol, which remains stable from 150′ up to 48 h.
  The signalosome could be targeted for degradation with consequent de novo synthesis
  of the proteins complex (CCR5, β-arrestin2, ERK1). As a consequence, CCR5 reappears
  on the cell surface with long lasting kinetics (8 days).
