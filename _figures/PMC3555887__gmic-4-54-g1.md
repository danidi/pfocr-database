caption: Figure 1. Mechanisms of cancer-like phenotypes upon bacterial infection in
  the midgut and hindgut.(A) Midgut stem cell compensatory mechanism upon enterocyte
  loss and its perturbation upon Ras oncogene expression. Enterocyte apoptosis and
  cytokine Upd3 expression - driven by JNK - lead to a compensatory mechanism that
  preserves intestinal homeostasis through proliferation of intestinal stem cells
  (ISCs) and their progeny, the enteroblasts (EB). Ras oncogenic predisposition leads
  to supernumerary but aberrant ISCs and EBs and a dysplastic tissue. (B) Hindgut
  model of cell invasion and dissemination. An immune response to intestinal bacteria
  induces the Imd pathway and activates JNK. Induction of JNK synergize with Ras1V12
  oncogene to degrade the basement membrane (laminin layer) by MMP1, facilitating
  hindgut cell invasion and dissemination in the abdominal cavity.
