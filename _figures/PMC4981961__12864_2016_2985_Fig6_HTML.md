caption: 'KEGG pathway analysis of target genes. a The top 26 significant enriched
  pathways based on KEGG analysis. The x-axis shows 26 different enriched pathways
  target gene productions involved in. The y-axis shows the absolute value of lgq.
  As the pathways with p-value < 0.05 and q-value < 0.05, they were predicted as the
  most significant ones in P. purpureum. b The most significant enriched pathway for
  conserved miRNAs. c The most significant enriched pathway for novel miRNAs. In the
  pathway map, small boxes represent proteins or enzymes and red ones indicate the
  candidate target genes encoding them. The small circles represent metabolites. The
  arrows represent different metabolic pathways. The detailed introduction about the
  pathways can be seen online. The website of (B): http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko04666.
