caption: Schematic illustration of the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways driven by
  the increasing accumulation of genetic alterations in the progression from low-grade
  to high-grade thyroid cancers. In this model, primary genetic alterations in the
  MAP kinase pathway, such as the BRAF mutation, transform the thyroid cell into PTC.
  As the genetic alterations accumulate, particularly with those that can also activate
  the PI3K/Akt pathway, the cancer progresses into aggressive type, such as ATC. If
  primary genetic alterations, such as genetic or epigenetic silencing of PTEN, occur
  in the PI3K/Akt pathway, the thyroid cell is transformed into follicular thyroid
  tumors. As genetic alterations accumulate in this pathway, a follicular adenoma
  can progress into FTC when tumor invasion occurs, which can progress further into
  ATC when genetic alterations accumulate further, particularly if there are genetic
  alterations that can dually activate the PI3K/Akt and MAP kinase pathways, such
  as Ras mutations or genomic amplifications of the receptor tyrosine kinase genes.
  The increasing intensity of the gray tint in the circles represents increasing genetic
  alterations and the signaling pressure of the pathways in the progression from thyroid
  cells to benign thyroid tumors to differentiated thyroid cancers and to ATC. The
  figure is adapted from reference  with permission. FTC, follicular thyroid cancer.
