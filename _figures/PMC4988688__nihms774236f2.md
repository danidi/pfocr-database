caption: Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathways. The pathway is inactive in the absence
  of HH ligands or activating mutations. Active HH signaling occurs with ligand binding,
  PTCH1/2 mutations (loss of function, red X) or SMO mutations (gain of function,
  yellow X). Activate HH signaling leads to GLI-regulated transcription and in tumors
  can lead to increased proliferation and tumorigenicity
