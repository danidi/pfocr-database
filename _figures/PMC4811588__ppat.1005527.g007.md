caption: Bb α-toxin bound to BmGRK2, a key GPCR regulatory kinase, affecting the modulation
  of GPCRs signaling pathway, leaded to a continuous up-regulation of downstream activity,
  which stimulates Gαs, promotes production of cAMP, and activates PKA. In turn, PKA
  activation alters effectors that disturb homeostasis and many fundamental biological
  process that destroy midgut cells, inducing larvae death (pathway 1). Alternatively,
  Bb α-toxin bound to BmGRK2 may also alter the signals downstream of receptor tyrosine
  kinases (RTKs) that are involved in cell cycle phases, but whether these signaling
  pathways participate in the Bb α-toxin pathogenic mechanism is unknown (pathway
  2). Activation of some other signaling pathway is not through pathway 1 or pathway
  2 but through other unknown receptors (pathway 3) in Bb α-toxin pathogenic mechanism.
  All of these pathways work together, leading to cell death.
