caption: Schematic illustration for the signaling pathways regulating endocytosis
  of NCKX2 in the somatodendritic compartment. Under resting conditions, the unphosphorylated
  or dephosphorylated tyrosine motif of NCKX2 interacts with AP-2 and thereby NCKX2
  undergoes endocytosis. When elevation of cytosolic [Ca2+] activates PYK2-SFK signaling
  pathway, activated SFK phosphorylates Tyr-365 of NCKX2, which in turn prevents interaction
  of AP-2 with NCKX2. Without interaction with AP2M1, NCKX2 avoids endocytosis resulting
  in higher surface expression of NCKX2 and enhanced Ca2+ clearance. These processes
  may contribute to local Ca2+ homeostasis. Inset, the subunit structure of AP-2.
