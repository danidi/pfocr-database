caption: Graphical summary of expression profiling of human lymphoblastoid cells derived
  from an SS patient. Many of the processes affected in these types of cells are essential
  for lymphocyte differentiation and formation, homeostasis, cell survival and B Cell
  receptor signaling. Includes all entities with p < 0.05 and z score ≥ 2 for diseases,
  functions and upstream regulators. Orange entities repre-sent activated nodes with
  z score ≥ 2, while blue entities represent inhibited nodes with z score ≤ −2. Vertical
  ellipses represent transmembrane receptors, horizontal ellipses = transcription
  regulators, rectangular bar = ligand-dependent nuclear receptor, squares = cytokines
  or growth factors, octagons = function, crosses = disease, squeezed rectangle =
  ca-nonical pathway and circles = other.
