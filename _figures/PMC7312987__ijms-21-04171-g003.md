caption: Activation of the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-dependent
  UPR signaling pathway within retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). POAG pathogenesis, on
  the molecular level, is correlated with the accumulation of aberrant proteins, such
  as mutant myocilin, within the ER lumen, which evokes ER stress conditions within
  the RGCs, subsequent significant elevation of the intraocular pressure (IOP) and
  activation of the PERK-dependent unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling pathway.
  Under mild to moderate ER stress conditions, UPR has a pro-adaptive role, whereas
  severe or long-termed ER stress conditions trigger activation of the pro-apoptotic
  branch of the UPR, directly leading to RGCs’ apoptosis.
