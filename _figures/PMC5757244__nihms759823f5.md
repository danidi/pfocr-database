caption: A1, LTP is exaggerated in Tsc2+/- mice. From (). A2, Activation of NMDARs
  leads to the inhibition of TSC1/2, which disinhibits TORC1. Activation of TORC1
  leads to the translation of proteins important for LTP, including GluA1/2 subunits.
  AMPAR exocytosis supports LTP. Loss of TSC1/2 (as seen in tuberous sclerosis) would
  lead to excessive TORC1 activation, and exaggerated LTP (experimentally supported
  by A1). B1, LTD is exaggerated in FMRP KO mice. From ()(Copyright 2002 National
  Academy of Sciences, USA). B2, Putative signaling pathway linking metabotropic GluR
  action to local translation of Arc and LTD. Activation of mGluR1/5 activates PP2A,
  which dephosphorylates FMRP. This releases mRNA transcripts from FMRP repression,
  and allows the local translation of LTD-relevant proteins. Translation of Arc supports
  readout of low spine activity by β-CaMKII, Arc-dependent AMPAR endocytosis, and
  LTD (). Loss of FMRP (as seen in FXS), leads to decreased inhibition of translation,
  and increased LTD (see panel B1).
