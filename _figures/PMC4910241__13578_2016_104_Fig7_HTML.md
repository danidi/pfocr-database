caption: Hedgehog pathway is involved in NC-induced inhibition of EMT and CSCs-like
  properties in breast cancer cells. In MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells exposed to NC,
  the schematic picture shows the effects of NC dual-blocking EMT and CSCs-like properties
  and then targeting breast cancer migration and invasion through inactivation of
  Hedgehog signaling

papertitle: Hedgehog pathway is involved in nitidine chloride induced inhibition of
  epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells-like properties in breast
  cancer cells.
