caption: Transcriptional reconfiguration of lysine biosynthetic pathway in C. albicans.
  Schematic diagram illustrating the occurrence of binding site(s) for S. cerevisiae
  Lys14 (blue) or Gcn4 (red) in the promoters (up to −500 bp upstream from the ATG
  codon) of S. cerevisiae and C. albicans LYS genes, as determined using the YeTFaSCo
  database. The dashed arrows indicate the absence of chromatin occupancy data for
  Lys14 at the S. cerevisiae LYS gene promoters. Gcn4 occupancy was found at the>
  S. cerevisiae LYS20, LYS2, and LYS1 promoters in a genome-wide ChIP-chip study ()
  and at the promoters of C. albicans LYS2 and LYS9 in this study, as shown by the
  data in  C. albicans Lys14-like proteins could rescue the lysine auxotrophy in S. cerevisiae;
  besides this, no recruitment was detectable at the LYS gene promoters in C. albicans.
