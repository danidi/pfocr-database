caption: The possible mechanisms of CRI enhancing insulin action and insulin signaling
  were shown in figure. The CRI treatment may directly suppress IDE and ubiquitin-proteasome
  system (UPS) in the liver, and result in reduction of insulin clearance and degradation
  of proteins (such as IRS-1 and IRS-2) in the downstream of insulin signaling pathway.
  The consequent of CRI treatment enhances insulin signaling, increases insulin sensitivity,
  and improves glucose metabolism in insulin-resistant and diabetic conditions.
