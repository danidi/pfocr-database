caption: Hypothesis of “The regulation of H3K27me3 on S. aureus subclinical mastitis
  susceptibility in dairy cows lymphocytes”. This cartoon shows the interaction of
  signaling networks induced by S. aureus infection including MHC I pathway, T cell
  receptor pathway and cytokines-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway,
  in which γ-interferon mediates MHC I to act on CD8 T cells and nature killer cells
  for killing the target cells. Cytokine genes IL10, IL13RA1 and CXCL10 participate
  in the synthesis of γ-interferon. ARG1 gene is involved in cell responses to identify
  S. aureus and then induces the immune interaction. However, H3K27me3 regulates expressions
  of these key genes in this immune signaling network
