caption: 'This figure depicts some of the targets of melatonin to prevent apoptosis
  in normal cells. Three major action pathways have been described: through its membrane
  receptors MT1 and MT2, as a direct antioxidant and/or promoting ubiquitination.
  The first two act by performance optimization of essential organelles such as the
  endoplasmic reticulum and the unfolded protein response (UPR) and improving the
  mitochondrial physiology. The third one leads to protein destruction through the
  proteasome. In a potential minor pathway, melatonin directly acts on molecules involved
  in apoptosis, such as calpains and calpastatins that regulate apoptosis due to its
  action on caspases, or on proteins located in the mitochondria, favoring an increase
  of mitochondrial efficiency and reducing free radicals production'
