caption: Model describing the proposed role of Rap1GAP in the control of GDNF-induced
  Ret signaling. After activation of Ret by the heterocomplex GDNF/GFRα1, Ret becomes
  phosphorylated at different tyrosine sites. In particular, the Tyr1062 has been
  described to mediate the activation of Dok-4, which then triggers a sustained activation
  of Rap1-ERK1/2 pathway and neurite outgrowth. At the same time, Ret activation results
  in phosphorylation of the Tyr981 (Y981), which is the docking site involved in the
  recruitment of the negative signaling regulator Rap1GAP. Thus, Rap1GAP counterbalances
  the Dok-4/Rap1/ERK1/2 pathway and controls neurite outgrowth. The figure also shows
  a possible role of PKA in the inhibition of Rap1GAP activity (dashed line), and
  indicates the potential involvement of Rap1 in the modulation of neurite outgrowth
  through the concomitant activation of Vav2 and/or Tiam1, two GEFs for Rac1 and Cdc-42
  (dashed arrow).
