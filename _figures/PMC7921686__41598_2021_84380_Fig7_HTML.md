caption: The Target-pathway network, constructed in Cytoscape3.7.2 (https://cytoscape.org/),
  was built by the candidate targets and a pathway if the pathway was lighted at the
  target. (Yellow nodes represent signaling pathway from enrichment analysis. Blue
  nodes represent the candidate targets in fucosterol. Red nodes represent the hub
  genes screened by PPI network.)
