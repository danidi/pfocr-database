caption: The effects of Nec-1 in programmed cell death. (A) 2D and 3D structures of
  Nec-1. Nec-1 is a type of alkaloid with small molecule weight, identified as an
  inhibitor of RIP1 and IDO. (B) Nec-1 halts the necroptosis signaling pathways by
  inhibiting RIPI signaling cascades. Furthermore, Nec-1 also affects necroptosis
  by targeting ROS. Nec-1 inhibits apoptosis by targeting RIP1 when the cell undergoes
  signaling pathway of RDA, yet it loses this anti-apoptosis effect when the pathway
  is RIA.
