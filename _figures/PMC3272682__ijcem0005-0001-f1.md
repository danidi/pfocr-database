  and Signaling. Upon stimulation, the endosomal TLR3 recognizes viral dsRNA while
  TLR7 detects ssRNA derived from virus-infected cells. TLR9 recognizes DNA derived
  from both viruses and bacteria. TLR7 and TLR9 activate the MyD88-dependent pathway
  to regulate inflammatory responses by activating NF-κB. IRF7 forms a signaling complex
  with MyD88, IRAK1 and IRAK4 and translocates to the nucleus. TRAF6-dependent ubiquitination
  is also essential for IRF7 activation that regulates expression of type I IFN together
  with NF-κB. TLR3 utilizes TRIF but not MyD88, TIRAP/Mal and TRAM for its signaling
  and interacts with TBK1 to induce IRF3. Activation of IRF3 and NF-ΚB is required
  for the induction of type I IFN. In addition to TLRs, the cytosolic RIG1 detects
  the dsRNA or the 5'-triphosphate ssRNA that have accumulated in the cytoplasm after
  viral infection as a part of a RNA-quality control mechanism. RIG-I is essentially
  expressed in the cytoplasm as an inactivated molecule, in which CARD and helicase
  domains are masked. Upon infection, viral RNA is detected by the helicase domain
  of RIG-I which results in conformational changes to allow interaction with the downstream
  adaptor, IPS-1, on the mitochondria and signal transduction, leading to the activation
  of both NF-ΚB and IRF3. Binding of viral dsRNA to the kinase PKR, causes the protein
  to undergo activation and subsequent phosphorylation of the eIF2α which leads to
  the inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. PKR has also been implicated in NF-κB
  signaling induced by viral dsRNA. TLR-mediated recognition of nucleic acids can
  induce synthesis of IL-1β through the activation of NF-ΚB. Bacterial RNA that is
  presented to the cytosol through the release from intracellular bacteria or active
  transport stimulates the NALP3 inflammasome through the adaptor ASC. Stimulation
  of cryopyrin/Nalp3 mediates caspase-1 activation that process IL-1β and IL-18 into
  the mature cytokine.
