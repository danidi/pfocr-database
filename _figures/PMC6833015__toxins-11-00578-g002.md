caption: The polyol pathway. The polyol pathway is a two-step enzymatic pathway. In
  the first strep, glucose is reduced to sorbitol by aldose reductase. In the second
  step, sorbitol is converted to fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. Endothelial toxicity
  arises from sorbitol/fructose accumulation within endothelial cells.
