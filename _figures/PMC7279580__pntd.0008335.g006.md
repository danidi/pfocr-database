caption: ZIKV-induced dysregulation of different proteins and cellular signaling pathways
  important for spermatogenesis. Energy supply is predicted to be affected by dysregulation
  of the PPAR signaling and glycolysis pathways. Testicular development could be affected
  by downregulation of microRNAs and upregulation of STC1, TIMP1, and IGF-1 signaling
  pathways. BTB integrity could be compromised by upregulation of cytokine (IL-6,
  IL-15 or ERK/MAPK) signaling pathways. Upregulation of IL-6 and ERK/MAPK signaling
  could also directly impact the spermatogenesis process. NK-kB and GM-CSF signaling
  could reduce the sperm count via apoptosis. However, spermatogonial proliferation
  and maintenance, regulated by EGF and FGF signaling pathway, were significantly
  upregulated by ZIKV infection, which could also adversely impact the spermatogenesis
  process.
