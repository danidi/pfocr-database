caption: Initially, the episomal viral genome is coated with repressive chromatin
  marks such as H3K9me3 at promoters. As stress increases, the JNK signaling pathway
  is activated and phosphorylation on H3S10 allows transcription of viral genes without
  the removal of H3K9me3, passing the threshold for reactivation. With an increase
  in transcription of viral genes such as VP16, the reactivation enters Phase II with
  the re-writing of active marks such as H3K9ac on the viral genomes, viral replication,
  and progeny production.
