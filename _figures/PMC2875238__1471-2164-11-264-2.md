caption: Representation of M. xanthuscore energy metabolism pathways significantly
  influenced at the transcriptional level during glycerol-induced sporulation. M.
  xanthus metabolic pathways identified by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) Pathway database [-] were amended as described in the text and were examined
  for significantly regulated genes. Genes are designated as the four digit Mxan_
  number. Significantly downregulated, upregulated class I, upregulated class II,
  and not significantly regulated genes are identified by blue, yellow, orange, and
  white outlined boxes, respectively. Entry sites of amino acids or fatty acids into
  the metabolic pathways are indicated in red. Consumption of activated sugars as
  precursors for spore coat components is indicated in green.
