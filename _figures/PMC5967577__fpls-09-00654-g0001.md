caption: 'Possible mechanisms by which RNS modulate the ABA regulation of dormancy.
  In absence of ·NO, the transcription factor ABI5 controls the expression of genes
  relevant to ensure the dormant state. The expression of ABI5 is induced by the Group
  VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTORS (ERF) and the activity of ABI5 is promoted by SnRK2
  kinases. ABA binds to the PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor to complex PP2C and avoid the inactivation
  of SnRK2. However, seed imbibition produces an increase of ·NO levels, resulting
  in a potential increase of different RNS. In this situation, the ABA control of
  dormancy can be attenuated by four different pathways: (i) the PYR/PYL/RCAR complex
  can be S-nitrosylated avoiding the interaction with ABA; (ii) ·NO can S-nitrosylate
  SnRK2 kinases inactivating their kinase activity; (iii) ·NO can target ABI5 to the
  proteasome by S-nitrosylation affecting the expression of genes under its regulation;
  and (iv) ·NO also targets the Group VII ERF to the proteasome, via the N-end rule
  pathway of proteolysis.'
