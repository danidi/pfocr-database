caption: A proposed working model of LRRC25-mediated negative regulation of NF-κB
  signaling pathway. NF-κB signaling activation stabilizes LRRC25, which, in turn,
  acts as a bridge to promote the interaction between p65/p50 and p62/SQSTM1 for feedback
  negative regulation of p65/Rel, leading to the degradation of p65/RelA through autophagic
  pathway and inhibiting NF-κB signaling.
