caption: 'Interface between addiction and stress: Reward versus anti-reward. During
  acute drug use, the reward system becomes overactive and dopamine is upregulated,
  especially in the NAc, giving rise to positive reinforcing symptoms, such as drug-liking
  and euphoria. In the dependent state, the reward system becomes down-regulated and
  the anti-reward system becomes upregulated and CRF released from the hypothalamic
  neurons acts on the pituitary to release ACTH, which in turn results in the secretion
  of cortisol by the adrenal glands. The production of CRF is initially controlled
  by negative feedback of cortisol on the hippocampus and hypothalamus. However, this
  is eventually overcome by the production of extra-hypothalamic CRF from the amygdala
  in a feed-forward manner, which maintains the sympathetic nervous system stress
  response. This latter pathway produces a stress surfeit that contributes to the
  negative emotions associated with withdrawal and which goes unbuffered because of
  the hypodopaminergic tone in the mesolimbic pathway. ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone;
  BP, blood pressure; CRF, corticotropin-releasing factor; DA, dopamine; MFB, medial
  forebrain bundle; NA, noradrenaline; NAc, nucleus accumbens; PFC, prefrontal cortex;
  VTA, ventral tegmental area.'
