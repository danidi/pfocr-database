caption: The DMP1 gene is unique in that it produces both oncogenic (DMP1β) and tumor-suppressive
  proteins from the single genomic locus. DMP1α causes cell cycle arrest in Arf-p53-dependent
  fashion while DMP1β stimulates G1-S progression independent of p53 (). Since both
  Ki67 and cyclin D1 proteins are upregulated in MMTV-DMP1β mice, DMP1β is considered
  to be in the upstream of the cyclin D1/CDK-RB pathway, but the molecular details
  for its action need future research. The activity of 16γ is dependent on the RB
  pathway while p12 does not have the CDK4-inhibitory activity but causes gene transactivation/repression,
  and thus might have other targets than RB (–). Splice variants from the MDM2 locus
  act through MDM2, and thus are mostly dependent on p53 regardless of the fact that
  they lack the p53-binding domain. Both ARF and MDM2 have other targets than p53.
  Published studies indicate that p53 variants (both N- and C-terminal isoforms) are
  dependent on p53 for their biological activities.
