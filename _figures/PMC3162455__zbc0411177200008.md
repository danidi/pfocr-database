caption: Schematic model for changes of sugar catabolism caused by overexpression
  of SigE. The transcriptions of genes for glycogen catabolism and the OPP pathway
  are up-regulated by overexpression of SigE. Increased protein levels of the enzymes
  of glycogen catabolism and the OPP pathway enhance glycogen degradation. FbaII is
  down-regulated by SigE overexpression. The up-regulation of sugar catabolism changes
  metabolite levels in the TCA cycle. Enzymes or metabolites that increase or decrease
  by the overexpression of SigE are shown in red or blue, respectively. G6P, glucose
  6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; F1,6P, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; DHAP,
  dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate.
