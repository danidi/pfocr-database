caption: Model of relationship between EphB2, FGFR, MAPK, and cell repulsion. The
  diagram depicts relationships deduced in the current study integrated with the results
  of other studies described in the Discussion. Baseline activation of EphB2 is kept
  low by LAR and other receptor PTPs, which also limit the amount of ephrin-induced
  phosphorylation. LAR is down-regulated by FGFR1 activation. In the absence of FGFR1
  activation, there is a high level of activation of EphB2 by ephrinB1 involving a
  positive feedback loop mediated by the MAPK pathway; this positive loop is limited
  by the inhibition of MAPK by RasGAP. EphB2 activation triggers multiple pathways
  that promote cell repulsion, one of which involves the inhibition of R-Ras by RasGAP.
  After induction of Sprouty genes downstream of FGFR, there is inhibition of the
  positive MAPK loop downstream of EphB2. This shifts the response to inhibition of
  MAPK by EphB2 and a lower level of EphB2 activation and cell repulsion.
