caption: The proposed signaling pathway of Tat-induced upregulation of P-gp expression
  in human brain endothelial cells. The HIV-1 protein Tat, acting via intact lipid
  rafts, activates RhoA and ROCK kinases, leading to inhibition of MLCP (via phosphorylation
  of MYPT-1) and increased phosphorylation of MLC. This study provides novel evidence
  that these events are involved in the regulation of P-gp expression.
