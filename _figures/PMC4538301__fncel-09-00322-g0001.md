caption: Nitric oxide signaling pathway. Figure shows different steps in the NO signaling
  cascade and its interaction with several elements involved in the signaling pathway.
  NO is synthetized by two Ca2+-dependent or one independent Ca2+-mediated processes.
  First, (1) NOS1 or neuronal NOS (nNOS)-catalyzed reaction converts L-arginine into
  L-citrulline in the presence of O2, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  (NADPH) and tertiary-butyl hydroperoxide (TBH) after the activation of the NMDA
  receptor by Ca2+. Also, (2) intracellular Ca2+ activates eNOS to release NO from
  brain microvessels. This NO binds to soluble guanylyl cylclase (sGC) receptors,
  which trigger a cGMP-dependent pathway and interacts with its downstream effectors
  (cGKI, CNG, PKG, PDE), the ultimate mediators of the NO’s physiological response.
  In addition, sGC is also critically affected by redox status. NO initiates the synthesis
  of ONOO− when O2− is present, which results in a dysfunctional uncouple variety
  of nitric oxide synthases (NOS) that produces O2− rather than NO. Finally, (3) NO
  is synthesized following the transcriptional expression of a Ca2+-independent iNOS
  isoform in glial cells, astrocytes and microglia after cytokine exposure.
