caption: A schematic diagram of signaling pathway in mast cells activated by antigen/antibody
  reaction and smoke exposure in vivo and in vitro. The data suggest that smoke exposure
  induces TGF-β release from a variety of cells including mast cells. The released
  TGF-β activates mast cells through expression of Smad isoforms such as TβRI/pSmad3C
  and pSamd3L and subsequent activation of these proteins via MAP kinases. In this
  way, it exacerbates allergic asthma symptoms. Question mark (?) indicates TGF-β
  predicted to be produced by various cell types or indicates predicted signaling
  cascade. The dotted arrow indicates a response that was not determined in this study.
