caption: On the left-hand side, the green arrows indicate the various effects of PAR2
  on the TGF-β pathway such as an increase in ALK5 protein abundance, R-Smad phosphorylation,
  Smad-mediated transcription, target gene expression and cell migration/invasion.
  On the right-hand side, still hypothetical mechanisms are shown that can lead to
  an increase in ALK5 protein such as deubiquitylation (eventually resulting in less
  degradation) or inhibition of a microRNA that targets ALK5 for degradation. The
  green arrows indicate stimulatory interactions and the red lines inhibitory interactions.
  The black stippled arrow indicates anterograde transport of ALK5 protein to the
  cell surface. P, phosphate residue; SBE, Smad binding element; USP, ubiquitin-specific
  protease.
