caption: Example of concordant pathway between COPD and IPF. The extracellular matrix
  organization pathway, one of the COPD-up pathways highly ranked by NetPathScore
  according to its network overlap with the IPF up-regulated module. Green and gray
  nodes represent the pathway genes and their first neighbors, respectively. The purple
  nodes represent the IPF disease module, with the darker and lighter shades of purple
  indicating the up- and down-regulated portions of the module.
