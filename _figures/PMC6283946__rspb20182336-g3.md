caption: An overall model of the metabolic flux and cellular responses of harbouring
  different Symbiodiniaceae species. The metabolites identified as enriched in the
  homologous B. minutum-colonized host cell (left) and heterologous D. trenchii-colonized
  host cell (right) indicate the downstream metabolic response of the host cell and
  how this might affect the fate of the symbiosis. Font colour indicates larger (red)
  or smaller (blue) relative abundance of the labelled fraction. Arrow thickness indicates
  activity, with thick arrows indicating a very active pathway and thinner arrows
  relatively less activity. Dashed arrows are putative responses.
