caption: (A) Across eukaryotic lineages, TORC1 coordinates metabolism with ribosome
  biogenesis. When glucose (or ATP), amino acids, and nucleotides are sufficiently
  available, TOR promotes ribosome biogenesis at multiple levels, including transcriptional,
  translational, and post-translational controls. (B) Comparative global profiling
  in Arabidopsis and humans presented here revealed a set of ‘core’ 5′TOP mRNAs that
  are regulated by the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis. (C) We propose that TOR-LARP1-5′TOP
  signaling evolved an early role in regulating ribosome biogenesis in the last common
  ancestor of plants and animals by controlling translation of ribosome biogenesis
  (RiBi)-associated mRNAs. Subsequently, plants exapted this signaling axis to regulate
  the expression of other mRNAs that encode, for example, proteins involved in hormone
  signaling and developmental patterning. Animal ancestors adapted the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP
  pathway to directly control expression of ribosomal protein mRNAs themselves, rather
  than diverse upstream RiBi mRNAs. Other lineages, including a recent ancestor of
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lost the LARP1 pathway, and presumably coordinate ribosome
  biogenesis downstream of TOR through other mechanisms.
