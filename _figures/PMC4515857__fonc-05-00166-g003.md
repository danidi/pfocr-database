caption: PTEN localization and interactions with representative partners. Canonical
  PTEN (red) can be found in the cytoplasm or in cytoplasmic organelles (ER, mitochondria)
  and in the nucleus. The primary cellular substrate of PTEN is the second messenger
  phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), which hydrolyzes giving phosphatidylinositol
  (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2), thus regulating the PI3K pathway. PTEN needs to be recruited
  on the membrane to perform this function. The association with the membrane is regulated,
  among others, by interaction with PDZ-domain proteins (MAGI1/2/3). PDZ interaction
  between PTEN and Bazooka (a PDZ-domain containing protein) is also important for
  the formation of the PAR/aPKC complex, which is required for the separation of apical
  and basolateral plasma membrane domains, for the asymmetric localization of cell
  fate determinants and for the proper orientation of the mitotic spindle. In the
  cytoplasm, PTEN also dephosphorylates FAK thus inhibiting cell adhesion. Finally,
  cytoplasmic PTEN also functions as a scaffolding protein. It associates with androgen
  receptor (AR), with melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) as well as with Amplified in
  breast cancer 1 (AIB1), a transcriptional coactivator. In all cases PTEN regulates
  the stability of these proteins by promoting their degradation. In the nucleus,
  PTEN also functions as a scaffolding protein. It interacts with transcription factors
  regulating their activity [p53, SMAD3, MTF-1 (metal-responsive transcription factor
  1)]. It correlates with miRNA processing by interacting with RNH1 and interfering
  with the formation of Drosha complex and it promotes degradation of nuclear located
  proteins as in the case of pAKT. Nuclear PTEN interacts also with CENP/C promoting
  chromosomal integrity and positively regulates expression of Rad51, which reduces
  the incidence of spontaneous double-strand breaks (DSBs). Additionally, PTEN is
  required in the nucleus for the formation of the APC/CDH1 complex, which is a regulator
  of cellular senescence and cell cycle. Canonical PTEN located in the ER is associated
  with Ca2+ release and regulation of apoptosis through interaction with the inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs). A translational variant of PTEN (PTEN-L,
  green) is secreted and associated with the mitochondria. PTEN-L exerts its phosphatase
  activity outside the cell boundaries, whereas in mitochondria it is related to mitochondria
  structure and energy production.
