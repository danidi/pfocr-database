caption: Activation of TNFR1 may promote multiple alternative signaling pathways,
  including the activation of NF-κB, RIPK1-independent apoptosis (RIA), RDA, and necroptosis.
  Activation of TNFR1 by trimerized TNFα induces the formation of a membrane-associated
  transient complex (named complex I or TNF-RSC), which includes RIPK1, TRADD, TRAF2/5,
  cIAP1/2, LUBAC, ABIN-1, A20, NEMO, PELI1, CYLD, and SPATA2. In complex I, RIPK1
  is rapidly polyubiquitinated by K63-linked and M1-linked ubiquitin chains mediated
  by cIAP1/2 and LUBAC, respectively. K63 ubiquitination chains on RIPK1 mediate the
  recruitment of TAB2/3 to facilitate the activation of TAK1, leading to phosphorylation
  of the IKK complex and RIPK1 on S320/S331/S333/S335. M1 ubiquitination chains on
  RIPK1 mediate the recruitment of PELI1, ABIN-1, and NEMO. ABIN-1 in turn recruits
  phosphorylated A20 to promote K63 deubiquitination of RIPK1. CYLD/SPATA2 promote
  the M1 deubiquitination of RIPK1. The activated IKK/NEMO complex promotes the activation
  of NF-κB. When the output of the NF-κB pathway is inhibited by cycloheximide, which
  blocks the expression of cFLIPL, FADD interacts with caspase-8 to form complex IIa-RIA
  to promote RIA. Alternatively, dimerization of RIPK1 can mediate the activation
  of RIPK1 during the transition from complex I to complex II. Activated RIPK1* can
  interact with FADD and caspase-8 to form complex IIa-RDA to promote RDA. When caspase-8
  is inhibited, activated RIPK1* is ubiquitinated by PELI1 on K115 and binds with
  RIPK3 to form complex IIb, leading to MLKL activation and necroptosis. Nec-1s inhibits
  the activation of RIPK1 kinase and in turn prevents the formation of complex IIa
  to block RDA and complex IIb to block necroptosis.
