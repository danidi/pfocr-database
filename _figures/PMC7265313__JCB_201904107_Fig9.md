caption: Final scheme. Graphic summary of prominent phenotypes observed after KIF14
  depletion and effects AURA inhibitionDAP, distal appendage proteins; KD, siRNA knockdown;
  sDA, subdistal appendage. KIF14 localizes to the ciliary axoneme. KIF14-depleted
  cells have increased pAURA levels on BBs, decreased intensities of distal appendage
  proteins FBF1 and SCLT1, and changed distribution of IFT57 and IFT88. This in turn
  leads to lower proportion of ciliated cells, reduced ciliary length, and failure
  to respond to HH pathway activation (reduced SMO ciliary localization and diminished
  expression of target gene Gli1). Treatment of KIF14-depleted cells by AURA inhibitor
  rescues the localization defects of FBF1, SCLT1, IFT57, and IFT88; defective cilia
  formation; and reduced ciliary length but fails to restore competence of KIF14-depleted
  primary cilia to respond to HH pathway activation.
