caption: Cross-talk between Nrf2 and other proteins. The substrate adaptor sequestosome
  1 protein (p62) modulates the Nrf2–Keap1 signaling pathway by directly interacting
  with Keap1. p62 sequesters Keap1 in autophagosomes, which results in a decrease
  in Nrf2 ubiquitination, an increase in Nrf2 stability, and activation of Nrf2 target
  genes. Nrf2 is stabilized in response to p21 up-regulation. p21 associates with
  the DLG motif on Nrf2, thereby disrupting the ability of Keap1 to properly bind
  and ubiquitinate Nrf2. DPP3 binds to Keap1, inhibits Nrf2 ubiquitination, and drives
  Nrf2-dependent transcription in cancer cells. (E) ETGE; (S) STGE; (D) DLG.
