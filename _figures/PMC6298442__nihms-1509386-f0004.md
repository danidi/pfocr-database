caption: 'One carbon metabolism metabolites of interest (i.e., metabolites significantly
  correlated with both arsenic metabolism and a metabolic outcome) are highlighted
  in pink (a-f). OCM facilitates the generation of SAM (a), the methyl donor for numerous
  substrates, which are essential to many biological processes including arsenic metabolism.
  SAH (b) is a product of SAM-dependent methylation reactions, and is hydrolyzed to
  Hcys, which can be remethylated to form methionine and activated to regenerate SAM.
  SAH is a potent inhibitor of most transmethylation reactions, including arsenic,
  through its binding with methyltransferases. SAH is only removed from methyltransferases
  if Hcys is pulled forward for the remethylation of Hcys to form methionine or diverted
  to the transsulfuration pathway for glutathione synthesis. Glutathione is a tripeptide
  consisting of cysteine (c), glutamate (d), and glycine and is critical to the body’s
  antioxidant response (in its reduced form as GSH), including detoxification of heavy
  metals. Choline can provide methyl groups for the remethylation of Hcys through
  conversion to betaine. Choline is also used in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) (e), an abundant phospholipid involved in maintenance of hepatic lipid metabolism.
  PCs may also be synthesized through the methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) using SAM as the methyl donor. aaPCs consist of glycerol linked to phosphocholine
  and two fatty acid residues, and removal of one fatty acid produces LPCs (f). aePC’s
  comprise an ether linkage to one alkyl chain and one polyunsaturated fatty acid.
  Abbreviations: As (inorganic arsenic); DMA (dimethylarsinic acid); GSH (glutathione);
  LPCs (lysophosphatidilycholines); MMA (monomethylarsonic acid); PCs (phosphatidylcholines);
  SAH (s-adenosylhomocysteine); SAM (S-adenosylmethionine)'
