caption: Biogenesis of microRNA (miRNA), extracellular vesicles (EV) and uptake mechanisms.
  miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II from chromosomal DNA into primary RNA
  (Pri-miRNA; 1-3 kb). Pri-miRNA is processed by Drosha into precursor miRNA (Pre-miRNA).
  Pre-miRNA is transported to the cytoplasm and cleeved into miRNA/miRNA duplices
  (∼22 bp) by Dicer. miRNA duplex strands separate with the incorporation of the protein
  Argonaute (AGO) and RNA-induced silencing complex (Risk; Xu et al. ; Sohel ; Tomasetti
  et al. ). miRNA can be packed in the EV or be exported as protein-miRNA complexes
  (Arroyo et al. ; Canfran-Duque et al. ). Exosomes are derived from the endocytic
  pathway and their biogenesis requires multiprotein complexes called Endosomal Sorting
  Complex Required for Transport. Microvesicles are formed by the outward budding
  of the plasma membrane, whereas apoptotic bodies are vesicles released from cells
  that undergo apoptosis (Akers et al. ; Morrison et al. ). EV are taken up by recipient
  cells by a variety of mechanisms including endocytosis (mediated by lipid rafts,
  clathrin or caveolin), pinocytosis, phagocytosis and membrane fusion (Mulcahy et
  al. ). Proteins present on the EV can trigger signaling pathways in the target cells
  or be involved in antigen presentation (Thery et al. ; El Andaloussi et al. ). miRNA-protein
  complexes are also internalized by interaction with specific receptors on the recipient
  cell. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) associated with miRNA (miRNA-HDL) interacts
  with scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1; Canfran-Duque et al. ). miRNA-AGO-2
  interacts with neuropilin-1 (NRP1; Prud’homme et al. ). EE Early endosome, MVB multivesicular
  body, NPM1 nucleophosmin 1, OMVs outer membrane vesicles, dsRNA double-stranded
