caption: Pathway network analyses of upregulated genes from early stage (stages II
  and IIIa) TNBC. Arrow direction indicates a functional association between an upstream
  regulator and a downstream element. The results demonstrated that there were significant
  pathway networks involving CDK1 and STAT1, regulating cell growth of early stage
  TNBC tumors. TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer.
