caption: Schematic representation of the kynurenine metabolic pathway. The kynurenine
  pathway is commonly segregated into two distinct branches that are regulated by
  KATs and KMO, as well as the availability of l-kynurenine within the brain. Additionally,
  kynurenine metabolism is regulated by a variety of proinflammatory mediators which
  impact enzyme expression levels, thereby altering substrate availability and metabolite
  formation favoring the KMO branch of the pathway under immune-related pathological
  conditions. TRP, tryptophan; 5-HT, serotonin; Kyn, kynurenine; KYNA, kynurenine
  acid; 3-HK, 3-hydroxykynurenine; AA, anthranilic acid; XA, xanthurenic acid; 3-HAA,
  3-hydroxyanthranilic acid; QUIN, quinolinic acid; IDO, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase;
  KAT, kynurenine aminotransferase; KMO, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase; KYNU, kynureninase;
  HAAO, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxidase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; BCG, bacillus
  Calmette-Guerin; IFNs, interferons; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin.
