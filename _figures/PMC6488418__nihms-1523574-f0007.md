caption: CD36 signal transduction in platelets is via a redox pathway that promotes
  pathophysiologic thrombosis. In (A), CD36 signaling activates Src family kinases,
  predominantly Fyn and Lyn, that promotes downstream generation of specific reactive
  oxygen species, superoxide radical anion and hydrogen peroxide, from NADPH oxidase.
  Superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide then activate redox-sensitive signaling
  pathways, including the MAP kinase ERK5. ERK5 links platelet CD36 to a prothrombotic
  phenotype. Interruption of this pathway by either pharmacologically, by blocking
  antibodies, or through genetic deficiency of key components prevented platelet activation
  and subsequent thrombosis in dyslipidemia. In (B), under pathophysiologic conditions,
  redox-dependent events initiated by CD36 enhances phosphatidylserine externalization
  predominantly through apoptotic-like caspase signaling. This ERK5 dependent pathway
  cross-talks with the collagen receptor GPVI pathway to enhance phosphatidylserine
  exposure, subsequent fibrin formation, and promote pathological arterial thrombosis.
  In (C), the physiologic pathways of phosphatidylserine externalization and integrin
  activation are described to the left, where physiologic agonists activate their
  receptors and triggers receptor-dependent signaling pathways. In one phenotype,
  signaling by physiologic agonists promote activation of integrin aIIbb3 that leads
  to platelet aggregation and subsequent thrombosis. In another phenotype, potent
  physiologic agonists activate the peptidylprolyl isomerase cyclophilin D to sensitize
  the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore that enhances procoagulant
  phosphatidylserine externalization. This mechanism promotes assembly of the prothrombinase
  complex to promote thrombin generation and subsequent fibrin deposition to support
  thrombosis. An alternative physiologic pathway to phosphatidylserine externalization
  was described, in which aged platelets promote phosphatidylserine externalization
  through apoptotic-like signaling. Phosphatidylserine exposure in this setting enhances
  platelet clearance.
