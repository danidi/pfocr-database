caption: Collateral efficacy in GPCR signaling. In the traditional paradigm of linear
  efficacy, a given agonist or antagonist for a GPCR initiates or inhibits a signaling
  pathway before the process is terminated by regulatory proteins such as GRKs and
  β-arrestins. In collateral or pluridimensional efficacy, a given ligand may be an
  antagonist for one pathway whereas simultaneously permitting activation of other
  pathways through G protein-dependent and -independent signaling. Therefore, multiple
  functions may be seen via a single receptor-ligand interaction and a subsequent
  unique receptor conformation change.
