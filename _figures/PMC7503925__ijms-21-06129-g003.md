caption: Biosynthetic pathway of eumelanin and pheomelanin. Eumelanin and pheomelanin
  begin with the common pathway by converting tyrosine to Dopa and subsequently Dopa
  to dopaquinone. Tyrosinase interacts with two tyrosinase related proteins, TYRP1
  and TYRP2 or dopachrome tautomerase (DCT) to form eumelanin pigments. On the other
  hand, cysteine is incorporated into dopaquinone to form cysteinyldopa which is then
  converted to benzothiazine metabolites to form pheomelanin pigments. Dopaquinone
  obtained by tyrosinase oxidation is a highly reactive intermediate, and in the absence
  of thiol compounds, it undergoes intramolecular cyclization, leading eventually
  to the production of eumelanin. However, the intervention of thiols, such as cysteine,
  with this process gives rise to the thiol adducts. Further oxidation of these cysteinyldopa
  isomers leads to the production of pheomelanin. In reality, most of the melanin
  pigments present in the hair and skin, and in melanomas may not be homopolymers
  of a single monomer unit, but rather they are complex heteropolymers made up of
  both eumelanin and pheomelanin building blocks.
