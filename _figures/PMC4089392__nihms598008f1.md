caption: A schematic cross-section of a podocyte foot process with the corresponding
  cell body, the glomerular basement membrane, and the glomerular endothelium is shown.
  Pathways involved in podocyte injury that may be drug-targeted are depicted in different
  colors. Sustaining nephrin expression and phosphorylation (yellow) might contribute
  to both antiapoptotic signaling and actin polymerization. The B7-1 pathway (light
  blue) may be targeted by (1) toll-like receptor-4 antagonists or (2) blocking the
  binding of B7-1 to slit diaphragm structure proteins. Urokinase plasminogen-activator
  receptor (uPAR)-induced podocyte motility (violet) could be inhibited by (1) interfering
  with binding of uPAR to αvβ3 integrin, (2) inhibiting β3 integrin activation, or
  (3) inhibiting binding of αvβ3 integrin to vitronectin. The notch pathway (dark
  blue) can be targeted by (1) interfering with its upstream activation by blocking
  the TGF-β1 effect, (2) inhibiting γ-secretase, which is required for proteolytic
  receptor activation, or (3) interfering with target gene transcription. TRPC6 channels
  (red) may be targeted by (1) channel blockers or (2) inhibiting their expression.
  The CatL pathway (green) could be targeted by (1) specifically inhibiting CatL expression
  or activity, (2) shifting the equilibrium of synaptopodin toward the phosphorylated
  form by inhibiting calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation or enhancing PKA or CAMKII-mediated
  phosphorylation, (3) protecting synaptopodin and dynamin by compounds that bind
  to the CatL cleavage site, or (4) delivering cleavage-resistant synaptopodin or
  dynamin mutants.
