caption: Excitation/contraction energetics coupling in healthy cardiomyocytes. Left,
  Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release from the SR increases cytosolic [Ca2±], leading to activation
  of myofilaments. Ca2+-release from myofilaments allows for myofilament relaxation.
  Right, Zoomed view of the creatine (Cr) and phosphocreatine (PCr) export pathway
  in healthy cardiomyocytes. Mitochondrial ATP synthase regenerates ATP from ADP,
  which via mitochondrial CK the phosphoryl group in ATP is used to generate PCr inside
  the mitochondria. Muscle CK uses the shuttled PCr to rapidly regenerate ATP from
  ADP at the myofilaments. CK, creatine kinase; NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Color images
  are available online.
