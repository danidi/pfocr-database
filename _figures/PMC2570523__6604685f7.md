caption: Schematic illustration of the molecular anatomy of the endosialin promoter
  and regulatory pathways induced by hypoxia and cell density. Distal part of the
  promoter contains adjacent hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) and ETS transcription
  factor-binding site (EBS) element and transmits hypoxic signalling through hypoxia-inducible
  factor (HIF)-2 directly binding to DNA and cooperating with Ets-1. Proximal part
  of the promoter contains two EBS elements (but not HRE) and hypoxia signalling is
  mediated by HIF-2 through Ets-1 and two EBS elements. High cell density contributes
  to endosialin activation by means of SP1-binding sites in the proximal promoter
  and partially feeds the hypoxic pathway by pericellular hypoxia. Moreover, hypoxia
  might influence activation of endosialin indirectly through HIF-1 that upregulates
  expression of Ets-1, which in turn upregulates expression of SP1. On the basis of
  this model, hypoxia and density cross-talk to induce endosialin transcription.
