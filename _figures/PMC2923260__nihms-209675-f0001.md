caption: 'Homocysteine in the liver is converted to methionine by two reactions: methionine
  synthase (MS) (a) and betaine homocysteine methionine transferase (BHMT) (b). 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
  (MTHF) is a substrate for MS which produces tetrahydrofolate (THF). BHMT uses betaine
  as a substrate with production of dimethylglycine (DMG). Methionine is converted
  by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) (c) to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which
  is irreversibly converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by donating its methyl
  moiety to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (d). SAH hydrolase (e) regulates the bi-directional
  reaction that leads to the synthesis of homocysteine from SAH or vice versa. The
  transsulfuration pathway is regulated by the vitamin B6-dependent enzymes cystathionine
  β synthase (f) and cystathionase (g) which both catalyze irreversible reactions.
  Alpha-aminobutyric acid (abu) is the collateral product of the reaction catalyzed
  by cystathionase.'
