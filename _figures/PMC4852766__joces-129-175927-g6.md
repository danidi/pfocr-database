caption: 'Proposed models that potentially link collagen VI myopathy and circadian
  genes. Model A suggests that circadian rhythm deregulation is a downstream effect
  of ColVI deficiency and contributes to muscle damage pathogenesis. The inappropriate
  persistence of AKT1 activation could follow reduced ColVI expression, leading not
  only to the downregulation of autophagy (also related to mTOR overexpression) but
  also to the activation of HIF1A transcription factor and the downregulation of the
  GSK3-β kinase. HIF1A physically interacts with several central components of the
  circadian rhythm pathway: BMAL1 protein (), PER1 (), PER2 () and ROR-α. HIF1A activation
  has been shown to increase levels of PER1 and CLOCK proteins (). Increased levels
  of PER1, a negative regulator of circadian rhythm, might lead to decreased transcriptional
  activity of the BMAL1–CLOCK heterodimer, thereby slowing down circadian oscillations.
  GSK3-β also plays a role in the post-translational regulation of molecular clock
  components, targeting BMAL1 for degradation at the end of the circadian cycle and
  stabilizing Rev-ErbA, a negative regulator of BMAL1 transcription (). Model B suggests
  that circadian rhythm deregulation in collagen VI myopathies is an independent event
  acting as a secondary modifier of disease severity. The collagen VI α6 chain is
  downregulated in the mouse circadian model, suggesting that circadian genes can
  influence the primary ColVI defect, as supported by the direct control circadian
  genes have on MyoD1 (muscle development) and ATG14 (autophagy circuit) proteins.
  Downregulation of CLOCK induces ATG14 persistence and autophagy activation, whereas
  MyoD1 overexpression alters regeneration and induces muscle damage.'
