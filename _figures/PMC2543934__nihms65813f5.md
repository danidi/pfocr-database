caption: PPAR-γ in Type 1/Type 2 T (NK) cell differentiation. Major molecular components
  involved in Type 1/Type 2 T (NK) cell differentiation are presented. The schematic
  diagram suggests several possible mechanisms by which PPAR-γ and its endogenous
  ligands favour Type 2 differentiation. Briefly, interaction of IL-4 with its cognate
  receptor will induce, either directly or indirectly through STAT6, the expression
  of genes such as GATA3 and PPAR-γ to increase the production of several cytokines
  including IL-4 itself, IL-5, and IL-13. These cytokines drive cell differentiation
  to Type 2 phenotype. Meanwhile, GATA3 and PPAR-γ may also negatively regulate the
  expression of genes critical for Type 1 differentiation such as T-bet. Binding of
  IL-12 with its surface receptor triggers activation of a JAK2/STAT4 cascade leading
  to IFN-γ gene expression. T-bet is the transcription factor whose expression is
  essential for IFN-γ gene expression in CD4+ T cells and NK cells. Whether T-bet
  is the downstream target for JAK2/STAT4 pathway remains to be determined. Expression
  of IFN-γ gene is a hallmark of Type 1 differentiation. Secreted IFN-γ binds to its
  surface receptor to initiate a JAKs/STAT1 signalling cascade, which promotes ubiquitin–proteasome-mediated
  PPAR-γ degradation. Thus, reduction of IFN-γ will help maintain the level of PPAR-γ.
  Meanwhile, PPAR-γ ligands can also block the production of IL-12. Together, the
  outcomes will favour Type 2 T and/or NK cell differentiation.
