caption: Hippo pathway mediates the activity of miRNAs inducing cardiomyocyte proliferation.
  a The active dephosphorylated form if YAP/TAZ localizes to the nucleus and associates
  with TEAD transcription factors to drive cell proliferation genes expression. b
  miR-199a-3p, miR-1825, miR-302d, miR-373 and miR-33b downregulate cofilin 2, which
  disassembles actin filaments. The resulting cytoskeletal rearrangement leads to
  YAP activation and nuclear localization. c When Hippo signaling is on, MST1/2 activate
  LATS1/2 kinases, which in turn phosphorylate and inactivate the downstream effectors
  YAP and TAZ. miR-302/367 complex directly targets the expression of MST1, LATS2
  and MOB1B, thereby blocking the Hippo signaling. miR-1825 activates miR-199a-3p,
  resulting in the downregulation of its target genes TAOK1 and β-TrCP, eventually
  leading to Hippo pathway repression and prevention of YAP degradation. miR-31a-5p
  downregulates RhoBTB1 and results in Hippo deactivation
