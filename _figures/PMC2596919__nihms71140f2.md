caption: 'The key event is an increase in plasma FFA concentration. This leads to
  the accumulation of fatty acid CoA and DAG, and activation of PKC in skeletal muscle,
  liver and vascular endothelial cells. It is assumed that activation of PKC interrupts
  insulin signaling by serine phosphorylation of IRS 1/2, resulting in a decrease
  in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS 1/2. In endothelial cells, PKC has been shown
  to activate NAD(P)H oxidase, which produces reactive oxygen species and destroys
  NO. Elevation of plasma FFA levels also leads to the production of inflammatory
  and proatherogenic proteins through activation of the IKK/IκB-α/NFκB and JNK pathways.
  The broken lines indicate that activation of PKC by the IKK/IκB-α/NFκB pathway and
  by ROS is a possibility that has not yet been demonstrated in human muscle or liver.
  Increased FFA-induced insulin resistance reduces glucose uptake in muscle and increases
  glucose production in the liver. Together, this results in hyperglycemia. In endothelial
  cells, FFA-mediated insulin resistance results in decreased NO and decreased vasodilatation,
  which may contribute to the development of hypertension. In muscle and liver, FFA
  activation of the IKK/IκB-α/NFκB and JNK pathways results in low grade inflammation,
  which may promote ASVD and NAFLD. ASVD: atherosclerotic vascular disease; CoA: Coenzyme
  A; DAG: diacylglycerol; FFA: free fatty acids; IRS: insulin receptor substrate;
  NAD(P)H: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced; NAFLD: non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease; NFκB: nuclear factor κB; NO: nitric oxide; PI: phosphoinositide;
  PKC: protein kinase C; ROS: reactive oxygen species.'
