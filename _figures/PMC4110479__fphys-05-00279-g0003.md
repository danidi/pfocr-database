caption: Tolerogenic properties of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). pDCs utilize
  several molecular mechanisms to induce tolerogenic properties. When phosphorylated,
  indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme catabolizing L-tryptophan to
  N-formylkynurenine acquires potent immunomodulatory properties. IDO promotes differentiation
  of naïve T cells to inducible CD4+ and CD8+regulatory T cells (Tregs) through cytotoxic
  T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)/CD80 pathway. In pDCs, IDO expression could be induced
  by multiple mechanisms including interferon (IFN)-γ-, IFN-α-, and transforming growth
  factor (TNF)-β-dependent pathways. Transcription factors Foxo and FoxP3 also stimulate
  IDO production. Kynurenine, a product of the IDO-catalyzed reaction can up-regulate
  IDO via a positive autocrine feedback mediated by the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor
  (AhR). IDO can up-regulate expression of the immunosuppressive molecule PD-L1 (programmed
  death-ligand 1) on the surface of pDCs. PD-L1 interaction with the PD-1 molecule
  decreases proliferation of the target T cell. Stimulation of the Toll-like receptor
  (TLR)-9 with CpG oligonucleotides leads to the activation of PD-L1 and induces expression
  thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor on the surface of pDCs. The TSLPR is
  essential to mediate stimulatory effects of TSLP produced by Hassall's corpuscles
  on pDC-mediated differentiation, maturation, and expansion of immature thymocytes
  to CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs and promoting central tolerance. TSLP-activated pDCs produce
  chemokines CCl17 and CCL21 essential for attraction of thymocytes to the thymic
  medulla. TSLP-induced pDCs drive maturation of Tregs that produce more IL-10 and
  less TGF-β. On the surface, pDCs express unstable antigen-Major Histocompatibility
  Complex (MHC) class II due to up-regulated membrane-associated MHC II ubiquitin
  E3 ligase MARCH-I that promotes rapid turnover and degradation of antigen-presenting
  complexes and supports maturation of Tregs. Finally, IL-3 could activate expression
  of granzyme B in pDCs, and its release suppresses proliferation of effector T cells.
