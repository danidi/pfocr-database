caption: Collagen XIα1 in cancer promotion. ColXIα1 is a downstream target of the
  TGF-β pathway, acting through transcription factor NF-Y. Once translated, procolXIα1
  is transported into the ECM, where its N and C termini are cleaved by proteinases.
  Mature colXIα1 can then regulate MMP3 expression through transcription factor Ets-1,
  perhaps through putative cell surface receptors integrin α2β1 and/or DDR1/2. ColXIα1
  also binds nucleolin, a cell surface receptor, which autolytically degrades itself
  into fragments which post-transcriptionally regulate MMP9. Ultimately, colXIα1 promotes
  cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis, and therapeutic resistance.
