caption: 'Schematic diagram indicating the pathways of metabolism of exogenous glutamate
  taken up by astrocytes. The portion of the figure outlined with a dashed line shows
  transport of glutamate from the extracellular milieu. The oval depicts the astrocytic
  glutamate transporter GLT1/EAAT2 or GLAST; rectangle depicts Na+, K+-ATPase. Astrocytic
  glutamate can be converted to α-ketoglutarate by the energy producing enzyme glutamate
  dehydrogenase or via one of the transaminase enzymes (primarily via aspartate aminotransferase
  but also by BCAT and ALAT). α-Ketoglutarate formed from glutamate is metabolized
  via a partial TCA cycle to either malate or oxaloacetate. For the complete oxidation
  of glutamate to occur malate (or OAA) must leave the TCA cycle, be converted to
  pyruvate by malic enzyme, and then converted to acetyl CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase.
  The acetyl CoA formed by these pyruvate recycling reactions re-enters the TCA cycle
  and is subsequently oxidized for energy. The dotted in the TCA cycle indicates that
  the NADH generated from the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction would only be formed
  when the acetyl CoA formed from the pyruvate recycling pathway is metabolized via
  the TCA cycle because the initial entry of carbons α-KG at is subsequent to this
  step. The complete oxidation of one glutamate molecule can yield 24–27 ATP depending
  on whether the initial step in metabolism is via GDH or AAT. The ATP is estimated
  at ∼20 since the maximum theoretical yield of ATP is never recovered due to mitochondrial
  proton leak. [See Table  for reaction details and (B) for labeling pattern of metabolites
  labeled from the initial metabolism of [U-13C]glutamate and the labeling pattern
  from subsequent metabolism via the pyruvate recycling pathway and re-entry into
  the TCA cycle]. Abbreviations: Glu, glutamate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate OAA, oxaloacetate;
  Asp, aspartate; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; AAT aspartate aminotransferase; BCAT,
  branched-chain aminotransferase; ALAT, alanine aminotransferase; KGDH, α-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase; ME, malic enzyme; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; GS, glutamine synthetase.
