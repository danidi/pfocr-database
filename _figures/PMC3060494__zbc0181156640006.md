caption: RPA/9-1-1- and hMSH2-mediated ATR activation in DNA damage signaling. DNA
  damage signaling involving ATR activation may take two pathways, which are respectively
  initiated by RPA/9-1-1 and hMSH2. RPA/9-1-1 and hMSH2 separately recruit ATR/ATRIP
  to DNA damage sites for ATR activation, leading to the activation of Chk1 and Chk2,
  culminating in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. TopBP1 is required for ATR activation
  by the RPA/9-1-1 pathway; however, its role in hMSH2-mediated ATR activation is
  unclear (dashed line).
