number: Figure 1
caption: The Figure depicts the major metabolic pathways activated during fasting
  and transcription factors involved in each of them. Gluconeogenesis precursors are
  supplied by muscle-derived amino acids and adipose tissue-derived glycerol. Shunting
  of these gluconeogenic precursors as well as gluconeogenesis itself are regulated
  transcriptionally. Ketogenesis mainly relies on fatty acid oxidation for its precursor
  – acetyl-CoA. Thus, TFs which regulate fatty acid oxidation often has an effect
  on ketogenesis. Accordingly, some of these TFs were directly implicated in ketogenesis.
  We determined the involvement of a TF in regulating a pathway based on evidence
  showing that the TF induces genes involved in the pathway and/or evidence showing
  that the metabolic output of the pathway is affected when the TF is inhibited or
  activated. (C/EBP - CCAAT enhancer binding protein, CREB - cAMP responsive element
