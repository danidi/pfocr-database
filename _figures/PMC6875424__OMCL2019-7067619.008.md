caption: Possible mechanisms of the effects of methane against APAP-induced hepatic
  injury. APAP induced the production of cytotoxic NAPQI, which induced oxidative
  stress, inflammation, and cell apoptosis. MRS could penetrate the cell membrane
  and protect against APAP-induced cell damage by enhancing the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant
  activity, downregulating NF-κB-mediated inflammation, and suppressing ERS-mediated
  apoptosis.
