caption: In the ‘OFF’ state, Patch inhibits the activity of SMO. Inactive SMO is unable
  to inhibit Sufu, which promotes processing of the Gli transcription factors in favour
  of shorter, transcriptional repressor forms (GliR). In the ‘ON’ state, Hh ligands
  bind to and inhibit Patch, thus releasing SMO activity and in turn blocking Sufu.
  Gli processing is then shut down, leading to the accumulation of transcriptional
  activator forms (GlIA).
