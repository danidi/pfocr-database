caption: 'Molecular mechanisms regulating EMT-like programs in GSCs. Several interconnected
  signaling pathways have been shown to activate EMT-like processes in GBM, promoting
  the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype in GSCs. Signaling pathways whose deregulation/aberrant
  activity has been found to promote the expression of EMT-associated genes in GBM
  primarily include the Wnt/β-catenin, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-MET, and TGF-β
  pathways. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway: in the absence of canonical Wnt signals,
  GSK3β readily phosphorylates cytoplasmic β-catenin, targeting it for subsequent
  degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. However, when Wnt ligands
  bind to a Frizzled receptor, GSK3β activity is inhibited (although this inhibition
  can also be mediated through the PI3K/AKT pathway). Active Wnt signaling thereby
  allows β-catenin to accumulate in the cytoplasm, which can subsequently translocate
  into the nucleus and bind to LEF/TCF transcription factors, in doing so activating
  the expression of target EMT genes. HGF/c-MET pathway: the c-MET receptor tyrosine
  kinase is often aberrantly overexpressed in GBM cells, including glioma stem-like
  cells, and has been implicated in enhancing tumor invasiveness by modulating the
  expression of genes involved in EMT. Upon binding its cognate ligand, HGF, c-MET
  can activate the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling cascades, both of which have been
  shown to lead to increased expression of transcription factors involved in glioma
  cell motility and invasion. TGF-β pathway: binding of TGF-β1 or TGF-β2 to either
  type I/II TGF-β receptors induces phosphorylation, and thereby activation, of receptor-regulated
  SMAD proteins (SMAD2/3). Activated SMAD2/3 is then able to interact with the common-mediator
  SMAD4, forming a trimeric SMAD complex that is free to translocate into the nucleus
  and cooperate with transcription factors to induce the expression of EMT-related
  genes. Moreover, TGF-β signaling can also induce EMT through SMAD-independent pathways
  through activation of the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling cascades, but these mechanisms
  have not been studied extensively in the context of GBM invasion'
