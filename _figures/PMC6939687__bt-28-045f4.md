caption: Mechanism of the neurovascular dysfunction associated with neurological disorders
  such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). With increasing age, amyloid β (Aβ)-mediated oxidative
  stress may lead to reduction of the cerebral glucose uptake and metabolism through
  the decrease of the glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 and GLUT-3, which in turn reduces
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) activity. The enhanced activation
  of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) induces amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression
  and increases Aβ formation. GSK3β also induces tau hyperphosphorylation, neurofibrillary
  tangle formation, and synapse elimination. HIF-1α phosphorylation and proteasomal
  degradation by GSK3β can result in decreased VEGF expression. A depleted neural
  stem cell population and VEGF signaling by loss of the HIF-Notch interplay may lead
  to neurovascular dysfunction.
