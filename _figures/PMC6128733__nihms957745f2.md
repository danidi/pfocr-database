caption: (a) Constitutive delivery of Trk receptors to axons via the secretory pathway.
  Exit of Trk receptors from the trans-Golgi-network may be mediated by interactions
  with sortilin, and its binding partner, ARHGAP33. (b) Anterograde transport of Trk
  receptors in secretory vesicles that are positive for Rab3 or Rab27B, mediated by
  kinesin motors, KIF1A or Kinesin-1. Trk receptors are coupled to kinesin motors
  with the help of adaptors such as Slp1, CRMP-2, JIP1 or JIP3. (c) In addition to
  the canonical secretory pathway, Trk receptors undergo axonal targeting via transcytosis,
  where soma surface-resident receptors are internalized and transported to axons
  in Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Retrograde NGF signaling is necessary for
  anterograde transcytosis of TrkA receptors. Active axon-derived TrkA receptors are
  inserted on soma surfaces where they elicit phosphorylation and subsequent endocytosis
  of naive soma surface receptors. Endocytosed receptors are dephosphorylated by PTP1B,
  an Endoplasmic Reticulum-resident protein tyrosine phosphatase, to ensure axon targeting
  of inactive receptors to engage with ligand at terminals.
