caption: 'Synergistic effect of three combined strategies by targeting complement/C3aR
  /C5aR1/IL-10 pathway and other treatment modalities. The three combined strategies
  were shown as follows: (1) dual blockade of complement signaling and immune checkpoint
  receptor PD-1; (2) complement signaling blockade and chemotherapy; (3) the clinical
  use of pegylated rhIL-10 with anti-PD-1 antibody.'
