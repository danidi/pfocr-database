caption: Functional alterations and HSC aging mechanisms. Aging negatively affects
  HSC functions, including decreasing self-renewal ability and myeloid/platelet-biased
  differentiation and impairing implantation ability. The intrinsic mechanisms are
  illustrated at the gene level, signaling pathway level, and epigenetic level. HSC
  aging is accompanied by some cell surface markers being upregulated with age (such
  as CD28, CD38, CD41, CD47, CD62, CD 69, CD74, and CD81) and some being downregulated
  with age (such as CD27, CD34, CD37, CD44, CD48, CD52, CD63, CD79b, CD86, CD97, CD97b,
  and CD160). Furthermore, aged HSCs show different expression levels of specific
  genes. For example, Amp3, Anxa7, Ap3b1, SELP, Egr1, Arhgef12, and Cbfa2t1h are upregulated,
  and Flt3, Xab2, Rad52, Xrcc1, Sox17, Bcl11b, and Blnk are downregulated. In addition,
  some signaling pathways are activated/repressed during HSC aging, including the
  JAK/STAT-NF-κB-mTOR pathway, TGF-β pathway, Wnt pathway, and ROS and UPRmtpathway.
  Age-related epigenetic regulation includes DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3.
  Extrinsic mechanisms include HSC-surrounding cells (including MSCs, neutrophils,
  megakaryocytes, and macrophages), cytokines (including IL-6 and IL-1B), enzymes
  (including caspase-1), and β-adrenergic nerve signaling (including increased β2-AR
  signaling and decreased β3-AR signaling). The red box indicates that the molecule
  is upregulated with age, and the green box indicates that the molecule is downregulated
  with age
