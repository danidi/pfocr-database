caption: 'Simplified diagram of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway in S. cerevisiae,
  including regulation of distinct steps within the pathway proposed to be regulated
  by TORC1/Ypk1/2 signaling (A) and proposed direct regulation of CerS by CK2 (B).
  In A, the dotted box denotes reactions that compose the so-called ceramide-LCBP
  rheostat. The major complex sphingolipids in yeast are indicated: inositol phosphorylceramide
  (IPC), mannose inositol phosphoceramide (MIPC), and mannose-(inositol phosphate)2
  ceramide (M(IP)2C). Other components are as described throughout the text.'
