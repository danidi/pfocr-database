caption: ER signaling pathway. Breast cancer cells have relatively high ERα expression
  and low ERβ expression. These two types of nuclear hormone receptors form homo-
  or heterodimers upon ligand binding and translocate into the cell nucleus for transcriptional
  regulation, which is the main function of ERs. ER dimers bind to the ERE region
  of target genes and recruit co-regulators to achieve the regulation of transcriptional
  activity. Another mechanism by which ERs control the expression of target genes
  is acting as a co-regulator for other transcription factors.
