caption: (a) Outline of the betalain biosynthetic pathway with the key enzymes CYP76AD1
  and 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) marked in red. CYP76AD1 catalyses the conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine
  (l-DOPA) into cyclo-DOPA, whereas DODA catalyzes the conversion of l-DOPA to betalamic
  acid. Betalamic acid spontaneously cyclizes with cyclo-DOPA to give red-pigmented
  betanidins, whereas betalamic acid can conjugate with amino and amine groups to
  generate yellow betaxanthins. (b) Variegated forms of Mirabilis jalapa, with yellow
  forms in which betaxanthins are the dominant pigment and pink forms in which betacyanins
  are dominant.
