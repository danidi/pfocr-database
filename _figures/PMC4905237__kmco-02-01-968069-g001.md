caption: RB1-related pathways in tumorigenesis. (A) Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) model
  in which the remaining wild-type retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1) allele
  is eliminated and the nullizygous state contributes to malignancy. The disease sites
  in humans and mice where this paradigm is most relevant are depicted at the bottom.
  (B) Conditional haploinsufficiency model in which loss of one RB1 allele contributes
  to chromosomal instability (CIN). Further loss of tumor protein p53 function is
  conducive to tumorigenesis in this paradigm and the cancer types consistent with
  this pathway are indicated.
