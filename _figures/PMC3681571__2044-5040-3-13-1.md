caption: Innate immune mechanisms of muscle damage in myositis. Skeletal muscle undergoes
  continuous injury and repair in response to a variety of physiological (exercise)
  and pathological (infection) insults and releases damage-associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs) from dead and damaged cells (Step 1). DAMPs initiate innate immune signaling
  by binding to surface or endogenous TLRs on various cells including skeletal muscle
  fiber, infiltrating macrophages (Mϕ), myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs), plasmacytoid
  DCs (pDCs), capillaries, and other cell types such as fibroblasts (Step 2) [-].
  This innate signaling through TLR and other innate immune receptors induces the
  secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [e.g., Type 1 interferons
  (IFN-α, IFN-β), TNF-α, IL-1, IL-12 and IFN-γ] into the microenvironment (Step 3).
  These cytokines and DAMPs bind to their respective receptors on muscle and capillaries
  [e.g., tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), IL-1 receptor (IL-1R)] and exert downstream
  effects (Step 4) [-]. Cytokines and/or chemokines directly cause damage to capillaries
  and hypoxia in the affected muscle. Cytokines such as TNF-α can directly induce
  cell death of muscle cells, while NF-kB is known to block MyoD and inhibit formation
  of the new muscle fibers [-]. Thus this pathway not only effectively enhances the
  death of existing muscle fibers but also inhibits formation of new muscle fibers
  leading to the loss of skeletal muscle mass and weakness in these disorders.
