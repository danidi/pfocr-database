caption: A final figure summarizing the major findings of this study and showing the
  integration of the lncRNA–microRNA–mRNA network and epigenetic regulation pathways.
  (A) LncRNA PVT1 and GREM1 were overexpressed, whereas miR-128-3p was downregulated
  in glioma tissues and cells. Meanwhile, we also validated the regulatory relationships
  between miR-128-3p and lncRNA PVT1 or GREM1. (B) Our study substantiated that lncRNA
  PVT1 modulated GREM1 and BMP signaling pathway through functioning as a sponge of
  miR-128-3p, thereby promoting tumorigenesis and progression of glioma
