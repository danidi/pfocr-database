caption: Model depicting the cooperative action of JNK and GSK-3 in regulating the
  c-Jun stress response in neurons. After the withdrawal of trophic support, the activities
  of JNK and GSK-3 are rapidly induced. Stress-activated JNK phosphorylates c-Jun
  leading to increased transcriptional activity and induction of AP1-responsive proapoptotic
  proteins c-Jun and Bim. Coordinate activation of GSK-3 is required for increased
  c-Jun/Bim expression and subsequently for AP1-induced death. This suggests that
  GSK-3 acts as a checkpoint on this apoptotic pathway. Active AP1 alone is not sufficient
  to drive the full death program. In addition, GSK-3 activity is essential for the
  full execution of c-Jun-mediated death.
