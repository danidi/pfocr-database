caption: The role of CL in mitochondrial protein translocation and morphology. (A)
  Protein translocases in the OM and IM are dependent on CL. Protein translocation
  is regulated by phosphorylation of components of the TOM complex. Mistargeted proteins
  activate the UPRam signaling pathway. (B) OM fusion is mediated by MFN1 and MFN2,
  fusion of the IM requires OPA1. See main text for a detailed description of the
  role of CL in the function of OPA1. The phospholipase MitoPLD converts CL into phosphatidic
  acid (PA), which facilitates MFN-mediated fusion. Fission is mediated by recruitment
  of DRP1 oligomers to the OM, where it interacts with CL. DRP1 oligomerization is
  intensively regulated by posttranslational modification. OM, outer membrane; IM,
  inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space.
