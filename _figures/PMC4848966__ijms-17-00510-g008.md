caption: 'Schematic representation of potential molecular pathways and targets mediating
  the proliferative response to the MF, as from the present and previously published
  data. Proliferation would be induced through two different pathways: a FR-dependent
  one, mediated by early, transient activation of p38 (1) and an FR-independent pathway,
  mediated by transient activation of ERK1/2 (2). A proliferative response would trigger
  only when both pathways are activated. JNK activation induced by the MF would not
  intervene in the MF-proliferative effect (3).'
