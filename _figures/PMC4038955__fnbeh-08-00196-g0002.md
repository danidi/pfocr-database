caption: Basal ganglia model. A possible model whereby basal ganglia compute the utility
  of gains and losses via two segregated pathways in the corticostriato-thalamocortical
  circuit. Striatal output neurons of the direct pathway express D1 receptors and
  project to the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata
  (SNr), and has an action selection effect on cerebral cortex. Striatal output neurons
  in the indirect pathway express D2 receptors and reduce the tonic inhibition of
  the external globus pallidus (GPe) on the GPi/SNr, which leads to action inhibition
  in the cortex. D1 receptors respond mainly to phasic (high concentration) dopamine
  signaling due to their low affinity for dopamine. D2 receptors have high affinity
  for dopamine and respond to lower tonic dopamine levels. Excitatory projections
  in green, inhibitory in red.
