caption: Proposed integrated model of BTN3A1 modifications induced by phosphoantigens
  and leading to the antigenic activation of Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes. Intracellular accumulation
  of pAg could originate from a dysregulation of the Self mevalonate (MVA) pathway
  in pathological situations (e.g., cancer, infections) and/or be from exogenous origin
  (e.g., pathogens). In some situations, negatively charged pAg would need to be routed
  (e.g., import/export) via active processes (e.g., ABC transporters). pAg would then
  bind to intracellular parts of butyrophilin molecules (e.g., B30.2 ± juxtamembrane
  domains) at different sub-cellular locations during synthesis and routing steps
  of the molecules (e.g., ER, cell membrane). The binding of pAg to butyrophilins
  induces structural modifications that affect the dynamics of the molecules (e.g.,
  membrane diffusion) and the immunological visibility of these molecules. Accordingly,
  the transition from resting to activatory state of these molecular complexes might
  also be linked to the nature of the multimerization of BTN3A1 glycoproteins (e.g.,
  homodimers, heterodimers). The contribution of additional partner molecules, some
  of them being species-specific, regulating actin cytoskeleton modifications (e.g.,
  RhoB, PPL) might also be important. The mechanisms that drive this unique antigenic
  activation process of human Vγ9Vδ2 T lymphocytes sensing these subtle molecular
  changes though a specific, contact-, and Vγ9Vδ2 TCR-dependent process remain a major
  conundrum. The question marks (?) refer to unsolved or yet unclear issues.
