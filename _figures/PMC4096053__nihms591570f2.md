caption: The many functions of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and PML as a
  negative regulator of the PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway. a Promyelocytic leukemia
  nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) regulate diverse cellular functions, including the DNA-damage
  response, by storing and releasing checkpoint proteins and repair proteins following
  DNA damage; metabolism necessary for stem cell maintenance; cellular apoptosis and
  senescence; and angiogenesis. PML-NBs orchestrate these many functions through post-translational
  modification of proteins, including sumoylation, acetylation and phosphorylation;
  regulation of nuclear activities, such as transcription and chromatin organization;
  and the identification and storage of proteins. b Aberrant activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR
  pathway leads to the depletion of HSCs, which enter the cell cycle and are quickly
  exhausted. This pathway is negatively regulated by nuclear PML at several levels.
  PML maintains the PTEN tumor suppressor in the nucleus and inactivates phosphorylated
  AKT by recruiting an Akt phosphatase. PML also suppresses mTOR by inhibiting its
  association with Rheb, through physical interaction and accumulation of mTOR in
  the nucleus. Rheb, Ras homolog enriched in brain; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex
