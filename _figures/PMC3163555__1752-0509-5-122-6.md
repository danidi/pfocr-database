caption: Retrosynthetic maps for the production in E. coli of A) penicillin G and
  B) cephalosporin. Compounds in gray are endogenous to the chassis organism (E. coli);
  enzymatic reactions are represented as circles; branching compounds, which can be
  produced by more than one biochemical transformation, are (S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2-carboxylate,
  L-2-aminoadipate-6-semialdehyde; the target compound is at the bottom of the plot.
