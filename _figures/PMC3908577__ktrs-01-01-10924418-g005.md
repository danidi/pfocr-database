caption: 'Figure 5. Model: telomerase recruitment to uncapped telomeres is controlled
  by the relative stoichiometries of telomerase components. Yeast telomeres exist
  in a range of states, from fully capped and full length to uncapped and short. As
  telomeres age, they progressively shorten, and at some point reach an intermediate,
  uncapped status, recruiting the MRX+Tel1p complex. Tel1p phosphorylates Cdc13p (part
  of the Cdc13, Stn1, Ten1 comples shown as TSC), promoting telomerase recruitment
  through Est1p, and inducing checkpoint arrest at the G2/M boundary. Telomerase recruitment
  stimulates telomere repair (up arrow on left), and releases cells from checkpoint
  arrest. Failure to recruit telomerase leads to further telomere shortening (down
  arrow on right), where they eventually resemble double-stranded breaks (DSB-like).
  These short telomeres also promote checkpoint arrest, but since they cannot recruit
  telomerase they enter crisis. Recruitment of the DSB repair machinery promotes chromosome
  end joining in some cells, where homologous recombination is used to amplify telomere
  sequences enabling checkpoint bypass. We propose that maintaining the correct stoichiometric
  ratios of telomerase components is critical for telomerase recruitment and telomere
  length homeostasis. Alteration in the expression of one of these factors, e.g.,
  overexpression of Est2p by ablation of -1 PRF, weakly inhibits telomerase recruitment
  resulting in accumulation of shorter, intermediate length telomeres and accumulation
  of cells arrested at G2/M. Overexpression of all of these factors by inactivation
  of NMD has strong dominant-negative effects on telomerase recruitment, increasing
  the proportion of cells with short telomeres with similarly strong cell cycle effects.'
