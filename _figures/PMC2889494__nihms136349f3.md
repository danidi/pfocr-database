caption: The protein components of the pheromone response network constructed by the
  PCST approach. Note that the canonical pheromone response pathway (enclosed by dashed
  lines) is but a small component of the broad cellular changes revealed by applying
  the algorithm to the mass spectrometry and expression data. For clarity the differentially
  transcribed genes included in the network are not presented. Functional groups based
  on GO annotation are outlined with red boxes. PKC, protein kinase C; TF with phos.
