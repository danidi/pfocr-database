caption: 'Myostatin pathway: myostatin levels regulate skeletal muscle cell homeostasis.
  Myostatin is synthesized and secreted by muscle cell; it signals through the activin
  receptor IIB/ALK4/5 heterodimer to activate different pathways including Smad2/3
  and MAPK (ERK1/2, p38MAPK) resulting in the regulation of gene expression. Myostatin
  stimulation results in inhibition of muscle growth and muscle differentiation'
