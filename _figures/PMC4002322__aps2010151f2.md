caption: p53 regulation of energy metabolism. p53 regulates energy metabolism through
  target proteins that is directly or indirectly involved in energy metabolic pathways.
  p53 inhibits the expression of the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, resulting
  decrease of the levels of phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), an enzyme in glycolytic
  pathway, while increase the expression of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis
  regulator (TIGAR). TIGAR diverts glucose to an alternative pathway, the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP), which leads to the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH). NADPH is used for the removal of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS).
  Mutant p53 has been found to activate expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2), which is
  an important enzyme involving in glycolysis. p53 induces GLS2 to enhance mitochondrial
  respiration by increasing the production of glutamate and α-ketoglutarate. p53 targets
  another gene named synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2). SCO2 regulates the
  cytochrome c oxidase complex, which is essential for mitochondrial respiration and
  utilization of oxygen to produce energy (ATP). The end-product of glycolysis, pyruvate,
  enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle located within the mitochondria.
