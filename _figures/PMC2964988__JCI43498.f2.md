caption: One pathway involves descending input from the ACC to the PFC and then to
  the PAG. Another descending pathway arrives at the PAG from the insula via the amygdala.
  A descending pathway from the PAG through the RVM to the dorsal horn of the spinal
  cord influences nociceptive afferent transmission. Adapted from Science () and Nature
