caption: 'A new paradigm in the mechanism of GSIS in the context of the regulation
  of insulin secretion. Glucose transporters, GLUT2 in rodents and GLUT1 in humans,
  allow the equilibration of blood glucose with the cytosolic glucose concentration
  in pancreatic β-cells at any time. A specific hexokinase isoform, glucokinase (GK)
  is not feedback inhibited, which together with the absence of functional pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) kinases and lactate dehydrogenase, allows the entire glycolytic
  output to be utilized for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and hence efficient
  synthesis of ATP. As a result, elevated blood glucose induces elevated ATP synthesis
  and respiratory chain (RC) proton pumping, thus increasing ΔΨm and respiration.
  Moreover, a portion of glucose-6-phosphate formed by GK enters the PPP, producing
  NADPH at two sites, by G6P dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.
  This elevates cytosolic NADPH and thus the NOX4 activity. Since NOX4 directly produces
  H2O2, elevated glucose evokes instant redox signaling. Hypothetically, either KATP
  is only closed when both ATP and H2O2 are elevated and TRPM2 can also be independently
  activated by H2O2 (red *); or ATP only closes KATP and H2O2 activates TRPM2, as
  one of NSCCs, which is essentially required to reach the threshold of −50 mV for
  the activation of CaV. The intermittent opening of CaV channels followed by the
  opening of KV leads to repeatable action potential spikes, provoking pulsatile Ca2+
  entry and oscillations in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, which stimulate the
  exocytosis of insulin granules. There are amplifying regulation systems: (i) given
  by the Ca2+ import to the mitochondrial matrix, where increased Ca2+ activates several
  dehydrogenases, including the PDH complex; and activates the PKA-mediated phosphorylation
  of Cox4.1 and sAC-mtPKA-mediated phosphorylation of IF1, where the former protects
  the ATP inhibition of Cox4.1, and the latter releases the inhibition of the ATP-synthase
  and (ii) redox shuttles contribute to the elevated cytosolic NADPH. Incretins, GLP-1
  or GIP, massively amplify insulin secretion via their receptors, transferring signals
  via the Gαs proteins, tmAC, cAMP and either the PKA or EPAC2A pathway. PKA increases
  the sensing range of KATP to physiological mM ATP, inhibits KV, activates CaV, GLUT2
  (gray *) and snapin. EPAC2A directly activates TRPM2, essential for KATP-triggered
  GSIS; and activates Rim2α or via Rap2-calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) activates RyR,
  providing the Ca2+efflux from ER, when CaL is open, thus again amplifying IGV exocytosis.
  Biased GLP1R (GIPR) signaling activates PLC and either IP3-IP3R or PLC STIM1-Ora1-TRPC1
  mediated Ca2+ efflux from the ER (or TRPC1 migration to the plasma membrane); or
  the DAG-PKC pathway phosphorylating and thus activating TRPM4 and 5, so providing
  another essential NSCC-mediated shift up to −50 mV. Somatostatin (SST) and the andrenergic
  inhibitory pathway (via Gi or Go proteins) are also depicted.'
