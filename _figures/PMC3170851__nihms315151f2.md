caption: (A) Domain structure of the mammalian autophagy cargo receptors p62, NBR1,
  Ndp52, and NIX. Most of these proteins possess ubiquitin-binding domains (UBA or
  UBZ) and the LC3-interacting region (LIR) a linear amino acid motif required to
  bind LC3 and other ATG8 orthologues. (B) Misfolded and aggregated proteins are marked
  ubiquitin,, which is recognized by ubiquitin-binding domains of p62 and NBR1. These
  cargo receptors bind to LC3 (or another ATG8 orthologue) and target the substrate
  for autophagy. During mitophagy, damaged mitochondria are also ubiquitinated due
  to the recruitment of Parkin, an E3 ligase, which targets them for mitophagy. In
  a parallel pathway, the BH3 protein NIX is induced during mitophagy, interacts with
  LC3, and contributes to the recognition of mitochondria by autophagic membranes.
  (C) Autophagy inhibition can lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins and mitochondria,
  resulting in oxidative stress. At the same time, p62 accumulation and aggregation
  activates the Nrf2 pathway, which can promote the survival during oxidative stress,
  predisposing cells to genotoxic stress and oncogenic transformation.
