caption: 'ACE2 over expression in the central nervous system regulates AT1, AT2 and
  Mas receptors’ expression and activates nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway,
  leading to the modulation of baroreflex sensitivity, sympathetic and parasympathetic
  tone and eventually resulting in the decrease of neurogenic hypertension. (+) indicates
  a reinforcement and (−) indicates an inhibition of the pathways. Abbreviations:
  NT, non-transgenic; SA, syn-hACE2 transgenic mice.'
