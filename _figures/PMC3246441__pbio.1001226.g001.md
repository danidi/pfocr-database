caption: ComP autophosphorylates in response to binding the quorum-sensing signal
  ComX and subsequently phosphorylates ComA. ComA∼P drives transcription of the srfA
  operon that in turn triggers the expression of late-stage competence genes. RapC,
  RapF, and RapH inhibit the binding of ComA to its target promoters, repressing the
  induction of genetic competence. Mature Phr peptides are generated proteolytically
  from pro-Phr proteins during export. The Spo0K permease (not pictured) imports Phr
  peptides into the cytoplasm where they antagonize Rap protein function. H, histidine;
  D, aspartic acid; P, phosphoryl group.
