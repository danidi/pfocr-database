caption: Activation of unfolded protein response. Due to stress conditions, unfolded
  protein levels increase in the ER lumen. The dissociation of GRP78 from transmembrane
  sensors PERK, ATF6, and IRE1 leads to the activation of UPR signaling. Activation
  of IRE1 and PERK results in their oligomerization and transphosphorylation. Active
  IRE1 triggers the unconventional splicing of XBP1u mRNA resulting in the translation
  of an active transcription factor sXBP1. The active IRE1 can also interact with
  JNK and TRAF2 and thereby activating downstream signaling. The activation of ATF6
  leads to its translocation to the Golgi and its proteolytic cleavage, resulting
  in a transcriptionally active form. Activation of PERK triggers phosphorylation
  of elF2α leading to global translational attenuation and favoring translation of
  ATF4. Activation of all three pathways activate downstream transcriptional machinery
  resulting in expression of target genes to overcome the stress conditions. Persistent
  and excessive ER stress may lead to activation of mitochondria mediated cell death
  pathway.
