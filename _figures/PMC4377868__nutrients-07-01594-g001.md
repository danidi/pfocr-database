caption: 'Biological roles of sulphate and pathways of sulphate homeostasis. (A) Sulphonation
  contributes to numerous cellular and metabolic functions in human physiology; (B)
  Pathways of intracellular sulphate generation and sulphonation. Methionine is converted
  to cysteine via the transsulphuration pathway involving cystathionine β-synthase
  (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CTH). Cysteine is converted to sulphate via two
  pathways: A minor pathway involving CBS, CTH, sulphide quinone reductase-like (SQRDL),
  thiosulphate sulphurtransferase (TST) and sulphite oxidase (SUOX); and a major pathway
  involving cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 1 (GOT1)
  and SUOX. ST, Sulphate transporters; PAPSS2, PAPS synthetase; SULT, sulphotransferases;
  R represents those substrates shown in (A); (C) Flux of intracellular sulphate and
  sulphonated molecules. In adults and children, sulphate is obtained from: (i) extracellular
  sources via sulphate transporters; (ii) catabolism of methionine and cysteine; (iii)
  hydrolysis of proteoglycans in the lysosome; and (iv) sulphatase-mediated removal
  of sulphate from substrates in the cytosol.'
