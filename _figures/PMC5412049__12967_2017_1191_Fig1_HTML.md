caption: Schematic diagram of apoptotic signaling pathway. Apoptosis can be induced
  by the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway.
  The extrinsic pathway is initiated after an apoptotic ligand (e.g. FasL, TNF-α,
  TRAIL) binds to its death receptor. Subsequently, death-inducing signaling complex
  is formed resulting in caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 activates effector caspases
  and triggers the terminal phase of the apoptotic cascade. The intrinsic pathway
  is initiated through wide range of none-receptor mediated stimuli (e.g. deprivation
  of growth factors, hypoxia, oxidative stress), resulting in changes of the mitochondrial
  membrane permeability. After its release from mitochondria, cytochrome c together
  with Apaf-1 and procaspases-9 forms an apoptosome, resulting in caspase-9 activation.
  Caspase-9 then activates effector caspases, such as caspase-3. AIF and EndoG are
  also released from mitochondria and translocate to cell nucleus where they cause
  DNA fragmentation, independently of caspase activation. Both extrinsic and intrinsic
  pathways converge on the same terminal pathway
