caption: Death receptor signaling and programmed necrosis. This diagram summarizes
  the possible pleiotropic outcomes following death receptor activation and the signaling
  pathways leading to these outcomes. Ligand binding to and trimerization of death
  domain containing members of the TNF receptor superfamily, recruits FADD, a death
  effector domain containing adaptor protein and procaspase 8, forming the DISC. Signaling
  for apoptosis then proceeds via the extrinsic or intrinsic pathway. In the extrinsic
  pathway, active caspase-8 directly cleaves caspase-3. Activation of the mitochondrial
  or intrinsic pathway proceeds via caspase-8 mediated cleavage of cytosolic Bid.
  The truncated form of Bid then translocates to mitochondria, thereby functioning
  as a BH3-only transducer of the death receptor signal at the cell plasma membrane
  to mitochondria. Simultaneously, cleaved caspase-8 may inactivate death receptor
  signaling via RIP1 kinase, by cleaving and inactivating both RIP1 and RIP3. Conversely,
  RIP1 may act to stimulate TNF apoptosis signaling by promoting activation of caspase-8.
  In the setting of caspase inhibition or severe energy failure, death receptor signaling
  may preferentially proceed via RIP1 kinase, a death domain containing protein, that
  binds the death receptor signaling complex containing the adaptor proteins TRADD
  and TRAF2 at the cell membrane and then TRADD and FADD and RIP3 as cytosolic complex
  II. Along with RIP3, RIP 1 kinase, death receptor–mediated cell death occurs with
  ROS production and a cell death morphology resembling necrosis. Both mitochondrial
  and NADPH oxidase may be the source of enhanced free radical production in this
  signaling paradigm. When ubiquitinated and bound to the membrane cytosolic complex
  I, RIP1 kinase activates downstream kinase pathways, which may also contribute to
  ROS production (possibly via JNK) and also cleave the IKK subunit from the NF-jB
  complex, initiating NF-κB proinflammatory/prosurvival signaling. Gender likely also
  has a determinant effect on cell death phenotype following HI. DISC = “death-induced
  signaling complex”; FADD = Fas-associated death domain; HI = hypoxia-ischemia; IKK
  = IkappaB kinase complex; JNK = c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NADPH = nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate; NF-κB = nuclear factor kappa B; RIP1 = receptor interacting
  protein 1; RIP3 = receptor interacting protein 3; ROS = reactive oxygen species;
  TNF = tumor necrosis factor; TRADD = TNF receptor-associated death domain; TRAF2
  = TNF receptor-associated factor 2.
