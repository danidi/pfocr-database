caption: '(A) It seems that halofantrine and vinblastine could affect on five different
  signaling pathways in TNBC. Group 5: Halofantrine- or vinblatine-related proteins
  which are also related with proteins of A6B1 and A6B4 Integrin signaling pathway.
  Group 6: Proteins which are related with vinblasitne as well as proteins of EGFR
  family signaling pathways (such as ERBB1 signaling pathway, ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling
  events, ERBB4 signaling events, ERBB receptor signaling network). (B) We hypnotized
  that halofantrine and vinblastine are synergistic because they complementary regulate
  integrin and EGFR signaling pathways. Group 0: A part of EGFR family signaling pathways.
  Group 1: A part of A6B1 and A6B4 Integrin signaling pathway.'
