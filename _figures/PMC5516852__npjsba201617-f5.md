caption: Predicted changes in the flux distributions as computed with FVA between
  pH 7.5 and 6.5 involving protons. Upregulated fluxes (green) include the main glycolytic
  pathway, lactate production and degradation of L-arginine and L-serine, downregulated
  ones (blue) comprise fermentative reaction, the pentose-phosphate pathway (PGL)
  as well as one reaction from the amino acid pathway (GLUDy). Reactions not involving
  protons are omitted. The change in proton production per reaction is given in .
  ACt6, acetate transport in/out via proton symport; ASAD, aspartate-semialdehyde
  dehydrogenase; CITt6, citrate transport in/out via proton symport; CK, carbamate
  kinase; DHAK, dihydroxyacetone (glycerone) kinase; GAPD, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase (NAD); GLUDy, glutamate dehydrogenase (NADP); G6PDHy, glucose 6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, HSDy, homoserine dehydrogenase (NADPH); OAADC, oxaloacetate decarboxylase;
  OCBT, ornithine carbamoyltransferase; PGL, 6-phosphogluconolactonase; SERt6, L-serine
  transport in/out via proton symport. The upper and lower bounds as well as the flux
  interval size are shown in .
