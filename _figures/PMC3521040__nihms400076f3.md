caption: Therapeutic modulation of the AP C3 convertase activity. (A) Soluble and
  targeted RCA constructs for convertase inhibition via decay acceleration (DAA) and
  cofactor activity (CA). Grey arrows signify targeting to sites of ongoing complement
  activation (iC3b, C3dg) and/or self-pattern (GAG); red, pink, and cyan circles represent
  regulatory, recognition, and receptor domains, respectively. (B) Protein-protein
  interaction inhibitors based on therapeutic antibodies, proteins and peptides. Though
  only labeled on C3, compstatin and its analogs bind to both C3 and C3b. (C) Theoretical
  structural model of native C3 binding to C3bBb (as suggested in (); combined from
  PDB structures 2WIN and 2A73) and superimposition of the co-crystal structures of
  the three C3b-binding inhibitors compstatin (PDB 2QKI), CRIg (PDB 2ICF) and S77
  (PDB 3G6J).
