caption: Working hypothesis for the involvement of M4 receptors in the regulatory
  mechanism of cholinergic stimulation of gastric acid secretion. The cholinergic
  stimulation of acid secretion is mediated by the activation of M3 and M4 receptors.
  The activation of M3 receptors directly affects acid secretion from the parietal
  cells through a Gq protein/Ca2+pathway, while the activation of M4 receptors inhibits
  somatostatin secretion from D cells and by so doing unmasks the stimulatory effect
  of CCh mediated by the activation of M3 receptors in the parietal cells.
