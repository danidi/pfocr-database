caption: Hypothetical model presenting how β1/c-MET molecular complexes provide cancer
  cell resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies. In untreated cells, ligand-activated
  VEGFR-2 engages both α5β1 integrin and c-MET, impeding their physical contact. In
  α5β1 integrin-expressing cells, anti-angiogenic therapeutic intervention with bevacizumab
  decreases VEGF/VEGFR-2 binding. β1/c-MET complex formation is thus promoted, which
  leads to the cross-activation of both receptors and the activation of the downstream
  AKT signaling pathway (adapted from []).
