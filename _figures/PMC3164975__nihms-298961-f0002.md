caption: (A) Smooth transcriptional waves of cyclic gene expression sweeping through
  the zebrafish PSM (shown in blue).(B) Schematic representation of the PSM cells
  as coupled phase oscillators.(C) Model of the zebrafish oscillator. The Notch pathway
  has been proposed to synchronize oscillations by coupling by connecting the zebrafish
  Her1/Her7 intracellular oscillator to the Notch/DeltaC intercellular loop. The transcription
  factors Her1/Her7 establish a negative feedback loop controling the periodic repression
  of DeltaC, allowing the synchronous activation of Notch signaling in neighboring
  cells. In addition to receiving inputs from Notch signaling, the Her1/Her7 oscillator
  requires the Her13.2 partner, which is downstream of FGF signaling. The coupling
  between cellular oscillators provided by the Notch/Delta intercellular loop is thought
  to confer robustness to the clock synchronized oscillations against developmental
  noise such as cell proliferation, cell movement or stochastic gene expression.
