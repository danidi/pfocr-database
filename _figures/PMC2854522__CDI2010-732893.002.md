caption: Human Vγ2Vδ2 T cells respond to stimulatory phosphoantigens produced during
  bacterial or mammalian isoprenoid synthesis. Isoprenoid synthesis in many prokaryotes
  and protists produces the intermediate (E)-4-Hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate
  (HMBPP) from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate via the erythritol 4 phosphate
  pathway. Eukaryotes use the mevalonate pathway that produces isoprenoids and colesterol.
  HMBPP and IPP are phosphoantigens; HMBPP is unique to the erythritol 4 phosphate
  pathway while IPP is produced in both pathways. Phosphoantigens stimulate cytokine
  secretion and cytotoxicity in human Vγ2Vδ2 T cells. Statins block the eukaryotic
  pathway prior to mevalonate synthesis, and decrease the production of IPP. Bisphosphonates
  are a class of drugs that inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and cause the
  accumulation of IPP in mammalian cells. When mammalian cells of myeloid origin and
  some tumor cells are treated with bisphosphonate, they are more stimulatory for
  Vγ2Vδ2 T cells due to increased IPP production.
