caption: The NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) shows that at high doses, the action of
  IKK enhances IκB phosphorylation, degrades IκB, reduces the content of IκB in the
  cytoplasm, and increases the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in normal tissues or
  cells, thereby enhancing the expression of NF-κBp65 and NF-κB; (B) indicates that,
  in inflammatory or tumor cells, arsenic reduces cytoplasmic IKK levels, suppresses
  IκB phosphorylation, attenuates IκB degradation, increases cytoplasmic IκB levels,
  and weakens the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB, thereby decreasing the expression
  levels of NF-κB and NF-κBp65.
