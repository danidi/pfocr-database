caption: 'Using multiple mechanisms, PI3K/AKT pathway activation primes chromatin
  for subsequent transcriptional activation. From Left to Right: The DNA methyltransferase
  DNMT1/3a dissociates with chromatin following phosphorylation by AKT, causing DNA
  hypomethylation at promoter CpG islands, which has been shown to increase gene expression.
  AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 decreases EZH2
  affinity for chromatin, reducing the repressive promoter-associated H3K27me3 modification.
  Phosphorylation of the histone demethylase KDM5A increases its cytoplasmic localization,
  thereby increasing promoter H3K4me3 and transcriptional competence. Histone acetyltransferase
  activity and substrate affinity of p300/CBP is enhanced with AKT phosphorylation,
  increasing H3K56 and other lysine acetylation and transcriptional activation. CBP
  phosphorylation at T1871 has also been shown to specifically reduce H3K18ac, thereby
  contributing to oncogenic growth. PI3K/AKT has also been reported to have other
  effects on chromatin; Bmi1 phosphorylation by AKT promotes H2A ubiquitination and
  AKT-mediated phosphorylation of the histone acetyltransferase MOZ affects alters
  p53 acetylation and function, both of which independently modulate tumor suppressor
  expression.'
