caption: Working models. (A) Three-dimensional representation of the peculiar structure
  of the juxtanuclear actin network, showing the spatial contributions of Rho proteins
  to E4orf4-induced actin dynamics (see Discussion for details). We speculate that
  the nucleation of actin comets at the surface of endosomes (dark gray circles) drives
  their recruitment to the juxtanuclear region where they provide a localized input
  of microfilaments and actin modifiers for assembly of the contractile ring. (B)
  E4orf4 hijacks Rho GTPases signaling to kill cells in a way that requires interaction
  with Src-family kinases. Potential mechanisms include the activation of RhoGEFs
  and/or inhibition of RhoGAPs through Src-mediated phosphorylation. We propose that
  E4orf4-induced actin dynamics lead to severe perturbations of vesicular traffic
  and organelle-based membrane dynamics, which trigger the activation of an endo-lysosomal–based
  caspase-independent death pathway.
