caption: Schematic diagram showing the mechanism by which AT1R mediates pressor effect
  in the glutamatergic neurons of the RVLM of SIHR. Ang II triggers the activation
  of NADPH oxidase derived ROS-SAPK pathway via AT1R in the glutamatergic neurons
  of the RVLM of SIHR, then may activate activator protein (AP)-1 to evoke gene transcription
  and increase AT1R expression, which promotes the release of glutamate in the IML
  and eventually increases BP and HR.
