caption: 'Several serum metabolites, altered with significance on day 16 with disease
  in targeted analysis, share the common glycolysis/tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway.
  Grey arrows indicate multi-step reactions. The data presented in table format are
  discussed in the Metabolomics portion of the Results section; metabolites that were
  altered In 2 or more of the comparisons are similarly shaded in . * P<0.05.Abbreviations:
  2-DG = 2-deoxyglucose; Glucose/Fructose-6-P = glucose/fructose-6-phosphate; Fru-1,6-diP
  = fructose-1,6-diphosphate; 3/2-PGA = 3/2-phosphoglycerate; PEP = phosphoenolpyruvate;
  3-HPP Acid = 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid; 3-HA Acid = 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid; Hyp = 4-hydroxyproline; 2-KG Acid = 2-ketoglutaric acid; Succ-CoA = succinyl-CoA;
