caption: Common disease states that trigger autoreactive iNKT-cell activation include
  IRIs and metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or obesity-associated
  inflammation. Several pathways may lead to activation and functional changes in
  iNKT cells in response to these stressors. First, APCs may sense stress directly
  and respond, for example, via the ER-stress-response pathway, to present self-lipid
  antigens and/or produce cytokines including IL-12 and -18. Each can trigger iNKT-cell
  activation. Second, the altered environment of stressed tissues may affect iNKT-cell
  subset composition indirectly, by sensing and responding to molecules that re released
  following tissue damage. IL-33 and high-mobility group box 1 are two examples of
  such stress-associated molecules that can modulate the iNKT-cell response. Third,
  metabolic stress signaling pathways can shape iNKT-cell subset differentiation and
  polarization directly, as has been widely demonstrated for HIF pathway genes, autophagy,
  and unfolded protein response.
