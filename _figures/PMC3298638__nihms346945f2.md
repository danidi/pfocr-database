caption: For Wnt signaling, the transcriptional coactivator, β-catenin, is degraded
  in the absence of a Wnt signal, whereas the scaffold protein, Axin, is stable. Binding
  of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled and LRP5/6 coreceptors results in inhibition of β-catenin
  degradation whereupon it enters the nucleus. Transcription factors such as TCF,
  BCL9, and Pygopus form a complex with nuclear β-catenin that leads to activation
  of a Wnt transcriptional program. In contrast, Axin degradation is stimulated upon
  Wnt pathway activation. Members of the GLI family of transcriptional factors are
  the mediators of canonical Hedgehog (HH) signaling. In the absence of HH, GLI proteins
  are degraded or converted to a lower molecular weight form (GLI-R), which acts as
  a transcriptional repressor. Proteolysis of GLI occurs in a cytoplasmic complex
  containing several kinases including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), casein kinase
  1α (CK1α), and protein kinase A (PKA). The binding of HH to its receptor, Patched
  (Ptch), relieves inhibition of the seven membrane-spanning protein, Smoothened (Smo),
  by Ptch via an unknown mechanism. The uninhibited Smo protein subsequently inhibits
  GLI proteolysis, promoting accumulation of the full-length form and subsequent activation
  of HH target genes. Notch signaling is initiated upon binding of the transmembrane
  Notch protein to the Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 (DSL) family of plasma transmembrane ligands
  present in the membrane of adjacent cells. Binding results in a series of proteolytic
  cleavage events that ultimately release the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into
  the cytoplasm followed by its translocation into the nucleus. In the absence of
  NICD, the CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG1 (CSL) family of DNA binding proteins
  associates with corepressors (CoR) to inhibit Notch target gene transcription. Nuclear
  NICD interacts with CSL and the transcriptional coactivator Mastermind (MAML1) to
  recruit transcriptional coactivators (CoA) to initiate transcription of Notch target
  genes.
