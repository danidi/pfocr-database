caption: 'In the proposed model, PTHR1 signaling in osteocytes activates at least
  two distinct pathways: one leading to increased bone mass and the other leading
  to increased bone remodeling. Suppression of Sost/sclerostin and activation of LRP5
  signaling increase osteoblast numbers and are required for the increase in bone
  mass. The elevation of bone resorption is independent of the Sclerostin/LRP5 pathway.
  The question mark indicates uncertainty of the cellular source of RANKL and M-CSF
  (osteocytes versus stromal/osteoblastic cells).'
