caption: Potential mechanisms of miR-218 inhibition of glucose metabolism. The inhibitory
  action of miR-218 on glucose metabolism was via reducing the levels of GLUT1 directly
  and also inactivating the NF-κB signaling pathway that affects membrane translocation
  or expression levels of the key enzymes involved in glucose metabolism indirectly.
  miR-218, microRNA-218; GLUT1, glucose ttransporter 1; HK2, hexokinase 2; PFK1, phosphofructokinase-1;
  G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
