caption: Model of hedgehog action in the fetal male reproductive system. The fetal
  testis is composed of testis cords that encapsulate the developing germ cells and
  Sertoli cells, an extensive vascular network, and an interstitial compartment that
  contains the steroidogenic Leydig cells and peritubular myoid cells among other
  cell types. DHH produced by the Sertoli cells signals through PTCH1 and GLI1 in
  the Leydig and peritubular myoid cells to regulate their development and overall
  testis cord organization. Interestingly, despite the same hedgehog signaling components,
  these two cell types respond differently to the DHH ligand possibly due to the presence
  of SF1 in the Leydig cells. DHH signaling has also been shown to influence spermatogenesis;
  however, it is unclear if this occurs through a direct or indirect mechanism. Within
  the mesonephros, SHH is produced by the Wolffian duct epithelium and PTCH1 and GLI1
  are expressed in the mesonephric mesenchyme. Together, these data indicate that
  the hedgehog signaling pathway mediates epithelial–mesenchymal communication during
  fetal male reproductive development
