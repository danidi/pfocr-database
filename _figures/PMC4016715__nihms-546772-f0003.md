caption: Model depicting ciliary cargo trafficking pathways. Cilium-bound, membrane-associated
  proteins are initially sorted at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) before being delivered
  to the subapical (pericentriolar) region. There is evidence for at least four possible
  transport pathways. Pathway A involves direct targeting to the periciliary membrane.
  At the TGN, Arf4 regulates the budding of vesicles containing membrane-associated
  ciliary proteins, and Tctex-1 (Dynlt1) binds to a ciliary targeting sequence on
  the cytoplasmic domains of a cargo protein (for example, rhodopsin) to promote dynein
  motor coupling (1). Additional regulatory components, including Rab8, Rab11, Asap1
  and FIP3 (not shown), and at least one IFT protein (IFT20), may also ride on the
  pericentriolarly directed transport vesicles (2). Centriolar satellites associated
  with the basal body (3) may act as a way station for ciliary trafficking components
  (for example, BBS4) and ciliary proteins (transition-zone-associated RPGR and Cep290,
  which are required for Rab8 trafficking to cilia). The recycling endosome (4), which
  is important for basal body migration and early ciliogenesis, may represent an intermediary
  trafficking step in pathway B. Some ciliary-bound proteins may use a third route
  (pathway C) and be delivered to the apical plasma membrane before lateral movement
  into the periciliary membrane area (5). The switch from vesicular trafficking to
  intraflagellar trafficking may involve direct interactions between IFT54 (also known
  as MIP-T3, Elipsa and DYF-11) and IFT20 (both part of IFT sub-complex B), as well
  as the Rab8-binding protein Rabaptin5 (6, inset). IFT-associated cargoes are then
  moved into the cilium by anterograde transport (7). Finally, a fourth potentially
  discrete mechanism (pathway D) employing Unc119, Arl3 and RP2 ensures the trafficking
  of myristoylated cargo (for example, Nphp3 and G proteins) into the cilium (8).
