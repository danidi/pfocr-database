caption: 'Components shown by Storelli et al to regulate (or correlate with) the growth-promoting
  effects of L.p. are indicated in blue. Increased larval growth rate and altered
  InR and E74B gene expression indicate increased systemic signaling by the growth-promoting
  hormones insulin-like peptides and ecdysone, respectively. Over-expression of the
  TOR inhibitors TSC1,2 in either fat-body or prothoracic gland (PG) blocked the growth-promoting
  effect of L.p., indicating a requirement for the TOR nutrient sensing pathway in
  each of these tissues. The model involves significant inter-tissue signaling: L.p.
  and dietary protein in the gut lumen signal through the intestinal epithelium to
  the internal tissues, most likely by increasing circulating titers of amino acids.
  The Slimfast amino acid transporter transduces this signal to increase TOR signaling
  in the fat body. The fat-body releases an as-yet-unclear signal (indicated by question
  mark) that causes specialized brain cells to release insulin-like peptides. The
  PG receives an unknown signal (perhaps increased circulating amino acid titers?)
  that stimulates TOR signaling and the secretion of ecdysone. Because L.p. increased
  larval growth rate without affecting the size of the resultant flies, it suggests
  that the increased rate of larval growth produced by the fat-body and systemic insulin-like
  signaling is balanced by an increased rate of transition through developmental stages
  stimulated by the PG and ecdysone. These results underscore the importance of inter-tissue
  signaling in coordinating growth and metabolism in response to diet and microbiota.'
