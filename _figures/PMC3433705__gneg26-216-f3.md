caption: Schematics of putative chromophore biosynthetic pathway. Dietary carotenoids
  and xanthophils are taken up in the midgut by NINAD and carried by circulation to
  extra retinal neurons and glia to be taken up there by SANTA MARIA. The dietary
  β-carotene, once taken up, is reported to be rapidly hydroxylated to form zeaxanthin
  by unknown mechanisms. In extraretinal neurons and glia, NINAB cleaves and isomerizes
  zeaxanthin to yield 11-cis (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal and all-trans (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal.
  Presumably, the chromophore is generated from both products. 11-cis (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal
  (right branch in ) is converted to its retinol form, 11-cis (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol
  by a still uncharacterized retinal dehydrogenase. In the mean time, 11-cis (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol
  may also be generated from all-trans (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal (left branch in ) by
  conversion to its retinol form and 11-cis isomer. PINTA preferentially binds the
  retinol form of the retinoids in pigment cells and this binding is required for
  the chromophore biogenesis, though its precise role is not yet clear. In the final
  step of chromophore synthesis, 11-cis (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol is converted to its
  3S stereoisomer by NINAG to yield 11-cis (3S)-3-hydroxyretinol. This isomerization
  takes place about the chiral center at the C-3 position of the retinoid ring. C-3
  is marked by the red dot and the highlighted OH residue. 11-cis (3R)-3-hydroxyretinol
  is converted to 11-cis (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal to bind opsin (NINAE) expressed in
  R1–6 photoreceptors by forming Schiff base linkage with the lysine residue. Inset
  depicts photo-interconversion of rhodopsin (Rh1) and metarhodopsin (M*).
