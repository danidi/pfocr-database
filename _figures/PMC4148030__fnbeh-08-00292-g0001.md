caption: 'Behavioral training and testing were followed by slice recording. (A) Experimental
  design. We TC animals in two different tasks on the plus maze: a spatial navigation
  task (left) and a cue-response task (right). In both cases, the rats walked from
  one of a pair of opposite start arms to the goal arm that was baited on the particular
  trial. In the spatial memory task the animals had to remember the location of the
  food, while in the cue response task they had to remember a cue-motor response association.
  Thus, the rat had to choose and consistently use the appropriate strategy. Neither
  task involved spatial or body turn alternation (see Supplementary Figure ), but
  required either spatial navigation, or a cue-response strategy. (B) Stimulation
