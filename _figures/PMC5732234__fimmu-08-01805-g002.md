caption: The immune deficiency (IMD) pathway in fruit fly and the TNF pathway in the
  mouse. (A) The IMD pathway in Drosophila melanogaster is activated by Gram-negative
  bacteria and certain Gram-positive bacilli. The intracellular adaptor protein immune
  deficiency (Imd) interacts with the Drosophila Fas-associated death domain (dFADD)
  and the death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like caspase (DREDD) that cleaves Imd, which is
  then activated by K63 ubiquitination. This leads to the activation of the transforming
  growth factor beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1) that in turn activates the D. melanogaster
  inhibitor of kinase kinase ß and γ complex (dmIKKßγ). Activation results in the
  translocation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factor Relish
  (Rel) Dorsal to the nucleus which induces the transcription of antimicrobial peptide
  (AMP) genes, such as Diptericin. (B) The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathway in
  M. musculus is activated by TNF alpha (TNF-α) which binds and activates the transmembrane
  receptors R1 (TNFR1) and recruits the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and TNF
  receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2). TRAF2 employs mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase kinase 3 (MEKK3) which in turn activates the inhibitor of kinase kinase ß
  and γ complex (IKKßγ), which results to the translocation of NF-κB transcription
  factors p50 and Rel A. The latter translocation induces expression of several genes
  that are involved to immunity and inflammation.
