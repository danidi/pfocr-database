caption: A simplified scheme for metabolic proteins that are involved in longevity.
  There are complex interactions among individual metabolic signaling pathways, such
  as the insulin/IGF1, TOR, AMPK, sirtuin and FOXO pathways. These interactions impact
  healthspan and longevity. For instance, the TOR pathway, which is activated in situations
  of nutrient excess, is not only linked to other nutrient-responsive pathways, such
  as the insulin/IGF1 pathway, but also to the CR-induced pathway involving AMPK and
  Foxa activation. Longevity promoting proteins are in green, proteins that when mutated
  increase longevity are in red, other proteins are indicated in blue; mammalian protein
  names are used.
