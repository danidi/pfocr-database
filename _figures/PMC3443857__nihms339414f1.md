caption: The progesterone regulated paracrine signaling model depicted within the
  uterine compartments at the time of embryo implantation. Ihh is a progesterone target
  activated within the epithelium which signals downstream to COUP-TFII in the stroma
  establishing the Ihh–COUP-TFII axis within the dual uterine compartments. COUP-TFII
  has demonstrated to be a critical effector of decidualization and the maintenance
  of pregnancy during post-implantation through the activation of Bmp2 and Wnt4. COUP-TFII
  may also play a role in the activation of Hand2 in the stroma leading to the inhibition
  of the FGF pathway, a pathway known to be involved in the promotion of epithelial
  proliferation by estrogen signaling. The arrows represent activation. The bars denote
  inhibition. The question marks next to arrows represent an activation that is lacking
  substantial evidence.
