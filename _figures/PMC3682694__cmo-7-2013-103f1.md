  suppressor is the major brake of the pathway and a common target for inactivation

  with other inhibitors of the pathway, relevant to cancer progression. PTEN constitutes
  the main node of the inhibitory network, and a series of convergences at different
  levels in the PI3K-Akt pathway, starting from those with growth factor receptors,

  (PIP(3)) phosphatase; thus, opposing the activity of PI3K, the concerted actions
  to increase the availability of PIP(3) in cancer cells, relying either on other
  phosphoinositide enzymes or on the intrinsic regulation of PTEN activity by other
  molecules are discussed. Particularly, the synergy between PTEN and the circle of
  its direct interacting proteins will be brought forth in an attempt to understand
  both the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway and the connections with other parallel
  oncogenic pathways. PI3K is a major signaling hub downstream of HER2 and other receptor
  tyrosine kinases. PI3K activates AKT, serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent

  involved in cell cycle progression and survival. Recent new findings have demonstrated
  that PTEN also plays a critical role in DNA damage repair and DNA damage response.

  with and stabilizes p53 by suppressing Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and nuclear
  export of p53. Moreover, upon genotoxic stress, pVHL causes acetylation of p53,

  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Understanding the interplay between the modulators
