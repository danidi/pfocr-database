caption: Notch signaling plays a role in T helper type 2 (Th2) cell polarization and
  maintenance by affecting a variety of processes during Type 2 inflammation. Conventional
  dendritic cells (cDCs) in mucosal tissue are exposed to antigens during Type 2 inflammation,
  in this case, helminth infection in the intestine. This includes Type 2-associated
  antigens (Type 2-Ag), including helminth Ag, and those that induce Type 1 responses
  (Type 1-Ag), such as those from bacteria or viral species. Type 2-Ag and Type 1-Ag
  drive upregulation of Jagged and Delta ligands on cDCs, respectively. cDCs traffic
  to the draining lymph node (dLN) and interact with naïve CD4+ T cells. Jagged upregulation
  on cDCs may support a Th2 cell fate by activating Gata3 and Il4 expression downstream
  of Notch. Delta ligands expressed by cDCs may inhibit Th2 priming and induce a Th1
  cell fate by inhibiting Il4 expression and driving Ifng induction. Notch ligands
  are also expressed in the dLN by non-hematopoietic cells, including structural cell
  populations such as stromal fibroblasts. Exposure to Notch ligands on these cells
  may drive expression of functional genes and induce migration to inflamed tissue.
  Further exposure to Notch ligands in the periphery or inflamed tissue (such as the
  intestine) may also help to maintain a Th2 cell fate by promoting continued Gata3
  and Il4 expression []. The exact location and ligand-bearing cell(s) in this interaction
  are not known. Notch ligands can regulate T cell survival and apoptosis, while also
  influencing the development and function of Tregs (not depicted), which have the
  potential to limit Type 2 activation to resolve inflammation [].
