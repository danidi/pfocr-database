caption: H-, N-, and K-Ras are first farnesylated by FTase in the cytosol and bind
  to the ER membrane, where further processing of the CAAX box occurs. K-Ras (yellow
  box) travels by a non-vesicular, undefined pathway directly to the plasma membrane
  (dotted line). Farnesylated H- and N-Ras (blue box) traffic to the Golgi via secretory
  vesicles and are palmitoylated there by a Golgi-associated PAT, DHHC9. Transit of
  farnesylated, palmitoylated Ras to the plasma membrane is mediated by the secretory
  pathway. Removal of palmitate from plasma membrane-localized Ras is accelerated
  by binding of FKBP, and can be catalyzed by APT1. Depalmitoylated Ras dissociates
  from the membrane, and accumulates in the Golgi as a result of repalmitoylation.
  Inhibitors have recently been described for each of the above modification reactions
  (in red) [, , , , ].
