caption: A model of metabolic feedback via HBP and N-glycan branching. Steps 1 and
  2, in the fed state, hepatic glucose transport into the cell (step 1) and flux to
  HBP (step 2) increase intracellular UDP-GlcNAc supply to the medial Golgi. Step
  3, UDP-GlcNAc is a rate-limiting substrate for the Mgat enzymes. Step 4, N-glycan
  branching on Gcgr and other glycoproteins increases (left to right). Step 5, equilibrium
  shifts in a cyclical manner with feeding and fasting. Mgat5 N-glycan branching enhances
  galectin-9 binding and sensitivity to glucagon. The galectin lattice may promote
  Gcgr receptor dimerization and/or recruit coreceptors. Increasing Gcgr sensitivity
  during feeding may be an adaptation that precedes and anticipates fasting in the
  normal feeding/fasting cycles. Step 6, increasing Gcgr sensitivity may contribute
  to glucagon signaling in the hyperglycemic state of diabetes. Step 7, high protein
  diet or salvage of amino acids during starvation may support UDP-GlcNAc concentrations
  and Gcgr sensitivity.
