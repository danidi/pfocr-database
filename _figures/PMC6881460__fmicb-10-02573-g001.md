caption: '(A) The fungal cell wall and the targets that have been explored for antifungal
  development: β-D-glucan synthase, chitin synthase, and the enzyme Gwt1 from the
  GPI anchor pathway; (B) Echinocandin exposure causes cell wall stress by inhibition
  of the β-D-glucan synthase. The protein kinase C (PKC), high osmolarity glycerol
  response (HOG), and Ca+2-calcineurin pathways have been implicated in the response
  to cell wall damage and chitin synthase hyper stimulation. Calcineurin is a client
  protein for the Hsp90 chaperone and genetic compromise of the gene HSP90 reduces
  the tolerance mechanism.'
