caption: Transferrin endocytosis and signaling pathways in protozoan parasites. (A)
  Trafficking and insertion of membrane vesicles. The Tf-TfR complex is endocytosed
  in clathrin coated vesicles in T. brucei and E. histolytica but in noncoated vesicles
  in T. cruzi. The monomeric G proteins, Rabs, play a role in controlling the trafficking
  and insertion of new vesicles into endosomes or with endocytic recycling endosomes
  (ERCs) that recycle the receptor in T. brucei and Leishmania; in the case of T.
  cruzi, the receptor is not recycled back to the membrane. (B) Inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate
  and diacylglycerol signaling pathway. In T. brucei and Leishmania, TfR activation
  stimulates the formation of InsP3 and DAG through the action of GPI-PLC. Insp3 produces
  Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum to stimulate cell proliferation. Ca2+
  in the cytoplasm binds to calmodulin (CaM) and translocates into the nucleus. DAG
  activates PKC, which then phosphorylates proteins that generate a specific response.
  (C) MAPK signaling pathway. TfR activated by Tf binding results in phosphorylation
  of MAPK, which has a central role in cell proliferation, and phosphorylation of
  the ERK1/2 kinases, which then translocate into the nucleus to activate transcription
  factors. These types of kinases are described in E. histolytica, T. brucei, and
  Leishmania. (D) Growth factor signaling pathway through TOR. Active PI3K takes information
  to TOR complexes that regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylation. TOR kinase
  functions are well conserved in eukaryotes with some differences in cellular localization
  in T. brucei and T. cruzi.
