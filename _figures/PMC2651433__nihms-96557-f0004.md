caption: Enzymes controlling NAD metabolism in professional antigen presenting cells
  (PAPCs; microglia, macrophages, or dendritic cells) are shown with consideration
  of pharmacological administration of complementary NAD precursors or effectors of
  NAD utilizing enzymes (SIRT1 activators / PARP-1 inhibitors) towards rescue NAD
  deficiency arising from chronic inflammatory disease. Immunomodulatory factors exert
  a coordinated regulation of NAD levels during autoimmune disease or infection. PAPCs
  including microglia act as sinks acquiring de novo pathway NAD precursor (tryptophan)
  or degrading NAD directly via activation of IDO and CD38 respectively. CD38 activity
  is required for chemotaxis (1). Thus, IFNγ activates IDO to increase intracellular
  NAD while simultaneously activating tryptophanyl-tRNA (encoded by WRS) to maintain
  essential tryptophan-dependent protein synthesis (2). All three IFNγ-mediated inductions
  occur in professional antigen presenting cells. IFNγ-mediated activation of IDO
  leads to complementary increases in NAD levels in a pyridoxyl phosphate (PLP; derived
  from vitamin B6) co-factor dependent fashion. The anti-epileptic molecule kynurenate
  is also produced through this pathway. In the end this pathway is predicted to affect
  global chromatin structure through NAD dependent SIRT-1 and PARP-1 mediated activities
  as well as other effects through related Sirtuin/PARP family member proteins (3).
  During chronic inflammation local extracellular NAD sources become deficient (tryptophan
  and NAD) and this exerts both an anti-proliferative immunotoleragenic effect on
  T cells but also decreases PAPC chemotaxis while making neighboring cells more vulnerable
  (4). Accordingly pharmacological application of NAD precursors provides tremendous
  cytotrophic benefit in numerous models of autoimmune disease. ADPR from either ROS-PARP1-PAR-PARG
  or excessive CD38 activity can lead to persistent activation of TRPM2 leading to
  programmed cell death, PCD (5). Excessive CD38 activity has been observed in type
  1 diabetics via excessive autoreactive anti-CD38. Highly expressed in the brain
  and clearly important in immune function, the role of CD38 in MS is completely unexplored.
  Peroxynitrate can activate PARP1 leading to nuclear PAR formation that translocates
  to the mitochondria to promote AIF release which also leads to programmed cell death
  (PCD). Two R(O/N)S sensitive pathways shown at the bottom include DNA damage-PARP1
  activation along with direct activation of the redox sensitive TRPM2 divalent cation
  channel. (6) Administration of pharmacologic doses of NAD precursors (nicotinic
  acid/niacin, nicotinamide/niacinamide, or nicotinamide riboside) or pharmacologic
  targeting of NAD-dependent targets (SIRT1 activators or PARP1 inhibitors) may complement
  the NAD deficiencies arising from immune activation of IDO and CD38.
