caption: A) Projection on KEGG metabolic pathways of functions encoded by the MGS126
  reconstructed genome (in red) using Ipath tool. Functions of the KEGG global map
  were depicted underneath. B) Presence of genes predicted to encode enzymes of the
  butyrate synthesis pathway (thiolase EC 2.3.1.9 (THL); β-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase
  (BHCD; EC 1.1.1.35); crotonase (CRO; EC 4.2.1.17); butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (BCD;
  EC 1.3.99.2); Electron-Transfer Flavoprotein α and β sub-units (ETFα and ETF β;
  E.C. 1.5.5.1); butyrate kinase (BK; EC 2.7.2.7); butyryl-coA acetyl-coA transferase
  (ButCoA; EC 2.8.3.8) among the reconstituted Clostridiales MGS. C) Abundance of
  butyrogenic modules of the human gut microbiota in the IBS cohort at baseline. Mean
  and standard deviation are represented. Results are presented using Tukey box-and-whisker
  plots.
