number: Figure 6
caption: Regulation of posttranscriptional modifications of NF-κB and histone H3 with
  and without TNF-α stimulation. Open arrowheads designate addition of groups whereas
  closed arrowheads designate their removal; Red arrows show inhibiting post-translational
  modifications whereas green arrows show activating modifications, both related to
  NF-κB transactivation potential. cAMP-response element-binding protein binding protein
  (CBP); SET domain containing lysine methyltransferase 6 (SETD6); protein kinase
  C (PKC); G9a-like protein (methyltransferase) (GLP); p300/CBP-associated factor
  (P/CAF); histone acetyltransferases (HAT); histone deacetylase (HDAC); sirtuin (SIRT);
  tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α); histone (H); methylation (me); acetylation (ac).
  (Scheme realized with Science Slides).
