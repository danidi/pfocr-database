caption: Pathway Enrichment Map of dyregulated protein complexes. We extracted the
  protein members of the dysregulated protein complexes and found enriched pathways
  using DAVID online tool.To visualize enrichment map of pathways, we used Enrichment
  Map Cytoscape plugin  to visualize enriched pathways. Nodes in this figure represents
  enriched pathways, links between nodes represent the fraction of overlap between
  them. The darker the node the more enriched the pathway is, and the thicker the
  link, the more significant the overlap is.
