caption: 'CFTR depletion led to an increase in FA uptake mostly by L-FABP (and to
  a lesser extent by CD36) and channeled to the lipoprotein assembly pathway, resulting
  in increased output of FFA-enriched lipoproteins. Furthermore, activation of the
  lipogenic pathway through stimulation of SREBP-1c expression and ACC (dephosphorylation
  and activation) caused cellular FA accretion, especially SFA which were converted
  to MUFA due to increased desaturase activity. These newly synthesized FA were incorporated
  into PL, TG and CE and efficiently secreted by the cell. ACC: acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  Apo: apolipoprotein; CE: cholesteryl ester; CM: chylomicron; FFA: free fatty acid;
  HDL: high-density lipoprotein; L-FABP: liver fatty-acid binding protein; LDL: low-density
  lipoprotein; LXR: Liver X receptor; MTP: microsomal transfer protein; MUFA: monounsaturated
  fatty acid; PPAR: Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor; PL: phospholipids;
  RXR: Retinoid X receptor; SFA: saturated fatty acid; SREBP-1c: Sterol regulatory
  element-binding protein-1c; TG: triglycerides; VLDL: very low-density lipoprotein.'
