caption: Interactions between signalling modules. The 12 signalling modules identified
  by the PRODISTIN method are represented as circles. The lines between circles represent
  the 30 protein-protein interactions linking the signalling modules. The 16 blue
  lines and the 14 red lines correspond to protein-protein interactions linking different
  modules in the same pathway and in different pathways respectively. The INS2 module
  is disconnected from the other signalling modules since only direct interactions
  between modules are here represented.
