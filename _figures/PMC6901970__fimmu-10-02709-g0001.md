caption: Regulation of Tfr cell differentiation and function. The miR-17–92 clusters
  enhance PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling by inhibiting PTEN, which promotes conversion of
  regulatory T (Treg) cells into T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells. mTORC1 phosphorylates
  STAT3 and thereby induces expression of the transcription factor TCF1, which upregulates
  Bcl-6, inducing surface expression of CXCR5 and the migration of Tfr cells into
  germinal centers (GCs), where they regulate the GC response. Interleukin (IL)-6
  signaling may downregulate FOXP3 and activate the STAT3 pathway at this stage. Interactions
  between Tfr cells and B cells such as ICOS-ICOSL and CD28-B7 are also required for
  Tfr cell generation. Tfr cells differentiation is inhibited by PD-1/PD-L1. IL-21
  signaling also negatively regulates Tfr cell differentiation by promoting Bcl-6-mediated
  inhibition of CD25 (IL-2 receptor) and lowering responsiveness to IL-2. FOXO1 negatively
  regulates Tfr cell differentiation by inhibiting the expression of ICOS. Tfr cells
  have a suppressive effect on T follicular helper (Tfh) and B cells by secreting
  granzyme B, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, and IL-10. The expression of CTLA-4
  in Tfr cells inhibits this process.
