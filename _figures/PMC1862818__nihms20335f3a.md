caption: Schematic of a signal transduction pathway activated by FAD mutations of
  APP. In the normal cell, the function of APP is tightly regulated by the binding
  of its ligand (portrayed in the figure as a trapezoid). FAD APP is relieved of such
  constraints, and, together with PAK3, Go, and APP-BP1, causes aberrant neuronal
  DNA synthesis and apoptosis.
