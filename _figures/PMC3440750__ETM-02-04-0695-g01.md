caption: Putative mutual relationship for carcinogenesis between proximal colon cancer
  and precursor lesion. Whether colon cancer acquires MSI or not is highly influenced
  by its origin, SSA or TA, but it is not a definitive pathway for carcinogenesis.

  with microsatellite unstable colon cancer in a location-dependent manner.
