caption: Schematic model of the regulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Under basal
  conditions, Nrf2 undergoes Keap1-mediated ubiquitylation and 26S proteasome-mediated
  degradation. In response to oxidants, toxicants, or Nrf2 inducers, Nrf2 is released
  from Keap1, translocates into the nucleus, and activates the transcription of ARE-mediated
  protective genes.
