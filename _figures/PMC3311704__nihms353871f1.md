caption: (A) Sialic acid biosynthesis begins with UDP-GlcNAc, which is converted to
  CMP-Neu5Ac; in humans Neu5Ac is subsequently installed into cell surface glycans
  by one of 20 sialyltransferases. (B) Various “R’” modified sialosides can be introduced
  into glycoconjugates by using the indicated CMP-Neu5Ac analogs. (C) Alternately,
  the sialic acid pathway can be intercepted with ManNAc analogs bearing (D) non-reactive
  alkyl N-acyl groups, (E) bioorthogonal functional groups, or (F) fluorinated substituents.
