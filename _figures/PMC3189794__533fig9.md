caption: Model depicts mechanisms by which morphological defects are induced in isc1Δ
  cells under stress conditions. (A) In one pathway, HU treatment of isc1Δ cells generates
  signals that are recognized by Rad9 and passed to Rad53, inhibiting the latter and
  leading to overproduction and/or stabilization of Swe1. This leads to Cdk1 phosphorylation
  and inactivation, resulting in a G2/M arrest and defects in actin dynamics. Furthermore,
  ISC1 gene deletion causes cell-wall defects under HU stress. The combination of
  the actin defect and the cell-wall defect leads to morphological aberrations. Alternatively,
  HU treatment of isc1Δ cells leads to stabilization of Swe1, which inactivates Cdk1;
  also HU treatment of isc1Δ cells causes signaling through Rad9 and Rad53. Both Cdk1
  and Rad53 (see parallel pathways in Figure 9A) pathways finally lead to actin and
  cell-wall defects, causing morphological aberrations. Finally, Cdk1 is known to
  phosphorylate Rad53 to control cellular morphology. In isc1Δ cells, this pathway
  may also be active (arrow from Cdk1 to Rad53). The role of Mrc1, Tof1, and Csm3
  is not shown. (B) Galactose or butanol treatment of isc1Δ cells causes Swe1 stabilization
  that, in turn, causes morphological aberrations.
