caption: Impaired Nrf2 activation and antioxidant gene expression in fetal endothelial
  cells in GDM. The Nrf2-Keap1 antioxidant defense pathway is compromised in fetal
  endothelial cells exposed to maternal diabetes in utero, potentially as a consequence
  of decreased DJ-1 and increased p-GSK3β expression. Decreased stabilization of Nrf2
  by DJ-1 and/or enhanced nuclear export of Nrf2 by p-GSK3β renders cells more vulnerable
  to a disturbed redox balance. The altered fetal endothelial redox phenotype may
  predispose offspring of GDM mothers to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes
  in later life.
