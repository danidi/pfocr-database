caption: Scheme of the proposed function of MIG6 and the underlying mechanism in endothelial
  cells. Shown is the proposed working model displaying that MIG6 restrains SHC1 signaling
  pathway by binding to it and inhibiting its phosphorylation, leading to reduced
  ERK1/2 activation and EC proliferation and migration, thus resulting in the inhibition
  of angiogenesis.
