caption: The Hedgehog signaling pathway. (A) The Hedgehog signaling pathway in fly.
  In absence of Hh, Ptc inhibits the localization of Smo on cell membrane. In the
  cytoplasm, Cos2, Fu and Sufu assemble in complex with Ci-FL protein, favoring its
  phosphorylation by PKA, CK1, and GSK3. This event induces the Ci-FL ubiquitylation
  by SCFSlimb E3 ligase thus leading both to proteasome degradation and cleavage into
  truncated repressor form (CiR). CiR blocks the transcription of Hh target genes.
  On the contrary, in the presence of Hh ligand, Ptc releases the inhibitory effect
  exerted on Smo which is activated by PKA and CK1 phosphorylation on the C-terminal
  domain, and then bound by Cos2 and Fu. These processes culminate in the Ci activation,
  promoting Hh transcription. (B) The Hedgehog signaling pathway in vertebrates. When
  the pathway is turned off, PTCH prevents the accumulation of SMO in the primary
  cilium. SUFU restrains GLI transcription factors in the cytoplasm where PKA, CK1α,
  and GSK3β kinases promote their phosphorylation. This process attracts the SCFβTrCP
  E3 ligase that determines the processing of GLI2 and GLI3 (GLI2/3R) in their repressor
  forms and the proteasome-mediated degradation of GLI1. In presence of HH ligand,
  PTCH inhibition is relieved. SMO is accumulated in the primary cilium and activated
  by GRK2 and CK1α phosphorylation. GLI activator forms (GLIsA) translocate into the
  nucleus and induce the transcription of HH target genes.
