caption: Relationship between ROS and chronic inflammation. The imbalance caused by
  oxidative stress leads to damage in the signaling in cells. ROS have a key role
  both upstream and downstream of the NF-κB and TNF-α signaling pathways, which are
  the main mediators of the inflammation. A vicious circle is observed between ROS
  and these pathways. ROS are generated by the NOX system. Proteins modified by ROS
  could result in activation of the auto-immune response to stimulate TNF-α and thus
  NOX. The dysregulation of these targets leads to the activation of several pathways
  involved in cancer initiation.
