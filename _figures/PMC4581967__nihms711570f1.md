caption: Upon recognition of a foreign or damage cell surface, one or more complement
  pathway is activated. The classical and lectin pathways differ in their initiation.
  The alternative pathway is distinct from the other two pathways but all three pathways
  converge toward the formation of a C5 convertase, which is necessary for the MAC
  formation. The   indicate a cleavage. Ag, antigen; MAC, Membrane Attack Complex.
