caption: Diagram of information flow in glucose signal of transcription as deduced
  from global analysis of expression of genes in the strains used in this study. The
  number of genes regulated by each branch of the pathway, the nature of the regulation
  (red, induction; green, repression), and some of the functional categories of genes
  enriched in each branch are indicated.
