caption: Proposed parasitic arsenic cycle. Solid arrows represent processes and enzymes
  that have been experimentally proven in this study or elsewhere, while dashed lines
  represent proposed connections and enzymes that have not yet been experimentally
  determined. Phytoplankton, represented by the Prochlorococcus cell on the left,
  detoxify arsenate by methylation, resulting in accumulation of methylated arsenic
  compounds in the environment. Methylated arsenic compounds, represented here by
  DMA and MMA, are demethylated by Pelagibacter, resulting in the release of inorganic
  arsenic or MMA (single demethylation of DMA) into the environment. In this study,
  we have observed the demethylation of DMA (gray circle) and the resultant production
  of MMA, arsenate, and CO2 (yellow circles). We postulate that LMWPc_ArsC, an arsenate
  reductase, and the associated aquaporin constitute an arsenic toxicity resistance
  module. Many parts of this scheme are speculative, for example, the role of CsdB.
  The tetrahydrofolate-linked C1 oxidation pathway in Pelagibacter has been demonstrated
  to produce energy via oxidation of methyl groups but does not supply net organic
  carbon for growth; hence, this proposed cycle is a form of energy parasitism.
