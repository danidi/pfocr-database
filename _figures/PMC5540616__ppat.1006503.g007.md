caption: LMP1 up-regulates GLUT1 expression by activating p65 and binding to GLUT1
  to delay GLUT1 p62-dependent autolysosomal degradation. The increased GLUT1 expression
  results in more extensive glycolysis. The increase in glycolysis triggers the activation
  of p65 and the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, leading to the production of
  IL-1β, IL6 and GM-CSF from NPC cells, which promotes tumor-associated MDSC expansion
  in NPC microenvironments.
