caption: 'Protein and metabolite level in the pentose phosphate and amino acid pathways.
  A: Pentose phosphate and B: amino acid pathways. According to the carbon source,
  the mean value and SD of abundance for each protein and the response ratio for each
  metabolite were normalized to a value of 100. Each column graphic represents the
  growth phases studied (from left to the right: lag, early exponential, late exponential
  and stationary). In the column charts a color code was included to differentiate
  proteins and metabolites found when X. dendrorhous was cultured with the different
  carbon sources: proteins in glucose (orange), proteins in succinate (cyan), metabolites
  in glucose (red) and metabolites in succinate (green). The pathways were adapted
  from the KEGG database. In the metabolic pathways, names are written in a color
  letters: metabolites (black), PP pathway proteins (coffee) and amino acids (pink).
  Statistical significant differences between samples from different carbon sources
  at the same growth phase are represented as stars (t-test p < 0.02) and triangles
  (Benjamini-Hochberg correction p < 0.05). Abbreviations: PRPP: 5-phosphoribosil
  diphosphate, P: phosphate, TCA: tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
