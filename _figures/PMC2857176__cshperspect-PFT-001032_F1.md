caption: Incorporating information of both the inherited and somatic genetics of the
  p53 gene could further define patient populations in their abilities to respond
  to certain therapies. (A) Some studies suggest that cells from individuals with
  the proline (Pro) allele of p53 codon72 will undergo less apoptosis in response
  to DNA-damage-inducing therapies compared with individuals with the arginine (Arg)
  allele of p53 codon72. This has been suggested to be caused by less transcriptional
  activation of apoptotic effectors. (B) Other studies suggest that cancer cells with
  somatic p53 mutations from individuals with the proline (Pro) allele of p53 codon72
  will undergo more apoptosis in response to DNA-damage-inducing therapies compared
  with individuals with the arginine (Arg) allele of p53 codon72. This has been suggested
  to be potentially because of an enhanced inhibition of the p73 tumor suppressor
  by mtp53-codon72-Arg.
