caption: Possible mechanism by which thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) mediates
  ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by interacting with mitochondrial thioredoxin-2
  (TRX2). Ischemia/reperfusion induces cellular production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). In response to oxidative stress, Txnip is shuttled from the nucleus to mitochondria,
  where TRX2 regulates the generation of mitochondrial ROS and the mitochondrial apoptosis
  signaling pathway. Thioredoxin-2 also repairs reversible oxidative protein damage
  by reducing disulfide bonds that are formed by the oxidation of cysteines. Thioredoxin-interacting
  protein binds to TRX2 through a disulfide bond formation, inhibiting the reducing
  functions of TRX2. The interaction between Txnip and TRX2 promotes the generation
  of mitochondrial ROS and triggers the mitochondrial apoptosis signaling pathway,
  which leads to I/R injury.
