caption: RSK2 is phosphorylated at both Ser227 and Thr577 in response to DNA damage.
  Activated RSK2 translocates to the nucleus and interacts with Atm, thus activating
  the Atm/p53-dependent DNA damage pathway, as well as p53-controlled cellular events.
  RSK2 KO relieves AD-induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M check point and subsequently
  inhibited the DNA repair process, as indicated by the increased formation of γH2AX
  foci.
