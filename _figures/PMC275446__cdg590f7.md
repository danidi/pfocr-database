caption: Fig. 7. GC action on the JNK pathway. (1) In the absence of GCs, GR is located
  in the cytoplasmic compartment and associated with multiprotein complexes. Likewise,
  in non-stimulated cells, JNK associated with MKK7 is tied by scaffold proteins into
  specific signaling modules. In the nuclear compartment, AP-1 complexes containing
  c-Jun are bound to the TPA response elements (TREs) found in the regulatory sequences
  of the AP-1 target genes, although the AP-1-dependent transcription is turned off.
  (2) Upon stimulation, the signal is transduced along the JNK pathway signaling modules
  by a cascade of phosphorylation events (filled circles) that ends in the activation
  of JNK. Active JNK dissociates from the signaling module and translocates into the
  nuclear compartment where it associates with and phosphorylates the c-Jun N-terminal
  domain. Thereafter, c-Jun phosphorylation induces the dissociation of a repressor
  complex resulting in AP-1 activation and, in consequence, triggers transcription
  of AP-1-responsive genes. (3) In the presence of GCs (inverted triangles), hormone-bound
  GR dissociates from the multiprotein complexes and exposes a JNK docking site. Some
  JNK molecules dissociate from the signaling modules, bind to GR and travel together
  with GR into the nuclear compartment where they associate with c-Jun. (4) In these
  conditions, upon stimulation, JNK-deficient signaling modules fail to transduce
  the signal, resulting in the GC-induced inhibition of JNK pathway activation. In
  consequence, fewer molecules of active JNK are produced and, hence, enter into the
  nucleus. In addition, these active JNK molecules have to compete for the c-Jun docking
  sites with the already c-Jun-bound inactive JNK molecules.
