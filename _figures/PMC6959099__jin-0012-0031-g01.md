caption: Overview of catabolic and anabolic metabolism in the cell. Catabolic and
  anabolic metabolic pathways are interconnected and are coordinated depending on
  the energy demand and nutrient availability of the cell to ensure adequate supply
  of energy and macromolecules. In this figure, catabolic pathways are shown in blue
  boxes and pathways involved in the biosynthesis of macromolecules and redox balance
  are shown in green. a Glucose is taken up by cells through GLUTs and undergoes phosphorylation
  by HK to Glucose-6-P, which enters the glycolytic pathway in the cytoplasm to produce
  pyruvate. Under normal aerobic conditions, most of the pyruvate is converted to
  acetyl-CoA by PDH in the mitochondrion. A proportion of pyruvate is converted to
  lactate, by LDH. A number of glycolytic intermediates feed into amino acid and fatty
  acid biosynthesis. b Glucose-6-P can be directed to the PPP that generates Ribose-5-P,
  a precursor of nucleotide biosynthesis, and NADPH, which is required for the maintenance
  of redox balance and fatty acid synthesis. c Acetyl-CoA is also produced by FAO
  in the mitochondrion, following fatty acid conjugation to carnitine by the enzyme
  CPT1. d Citrate, produced by the combination of acetyl-CoA and OAA in the mitochondrial
  matrix, enters the TCA cycle, which generates the reduced intermediates NADH and
  FADH2. Citrate can be used in fatty acid biosynthesis through its conversion to
  acetyl-CoA by ACL. e NADH and FADH2 produced by the TCA cycle carry electrons (e−),
  which are used in the process of OXPHOS to reduce oxygen, leading to the production
  of energy in the form of ATP through the phosphorylation of ADP. Partial reduction
  of oxygen during OXPHOS leads to the production of ROS. f–g Amino acid catabolism
  also supports energy production and provides biosynthetic precursors. f Glutamine
  undergoes glutaminolysis to glutamate, which is converted by GLDH into the TCA cycle
  intermediate α-ketoglutarate. Glutaminolysis also provides glutamate for the synthesis
  of the antioxidant glutathione and nitrogen for amino acid and nucleotide synthesis.
  g Arginine is converted to ornithine and urea through the action of the mitochondrial
  arginase isozyme, ARG2. The enzyme OAT converts ornithine to glutamate, which is
  then converted to α-ketoglutarate to feed the TCA cycle. Arginine can alternatively
  be converted to citrulline by induced NO synthase leading to the production of NO.
  Citrulline is converted back to arginine through the successive actions of the enzymes
  ASS and ASL. The activation or differentiation of innate immune cells in response
  to pathogens and inflammatory mediators is associated with changes in the expression
  and activity of key metabolic enzymes, leading to a shift in the balance between
  catabolic and anabolic metabolism. These metabolic changes are required to support
  innate immune function. Increased glycolysis, FAO, OXPHOS, and arginase activity
  ensure adequate energy production to support prolonged survival, resolution of inflammation
  and repair in anti-inflammatory cells, such as M2 macrophages. On the other hand,
  pro-inflammatory macrophages and activated dendritic, mast cells and neutrophils
  have truncated glycolysis and/or TCA cycle, leading to accumulation of upstream
  intermediates, which are channelled towards the PPP and anabolic pathways. This
  results in increased production of proteins, lipids, nucleotides and ROS, which
  are required for inflammatory mediator production and anti-microbial effects. Abnormal
  metabolic reprogramming may be a driver of defective innate immune responses in
  lung diseases, such as asthma and COPD. Fructose-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; Fructose-1,6-BP,
