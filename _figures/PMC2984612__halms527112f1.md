caption: 'The intrinsic pathway can be initiated by the release of proapototic molecules
  such as cytochrome c, from damaged mitochondria, which activate the intracellular
  receptor Apaf-1 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1) forming with caspase-9
  a proteotically active structure called the apoptosome []. Extrinsic activation
  of apoptosis, on the other hand, can occur upon stimulation of a cell membrane associated
  death receptor (DR). To date eight DRs have been described: TNF-R1 (CD120a) [, ],
  Fas (APO-1 or CD95) [, ], TRAMP (DR3, Apo3, LARD or Wsl-1)[–], TRAIL-R1 (DR4) [–],
  TRAIL-R2 (DR5) [, ], DR6 [], NGFR (p75NTR) [] and EDA-R (ectodermal dysplasia receptor)
  []. The best characterized are TRAIL-R1/R2 and Fas, which have been shown to play
  a crucial role in the immune system, in both immune-cell mediated cytotoxicity and
  downregulation of immune responses. Upon binding with their cognate ligands, these
  receptors form aggregates that enable the recruitment of the adapter molecule FADD
  (MORT1) [] and the initiator protease caspase-8 (FLICE, MACH, MCH5) [–], hence forming
  the so-called Death-Inducing Signalling Complex (DISC) in which caspase-8 is processed
  and activated []. Both intrinsic and extrinsic systems transmit signals through
  protein–protein interactions that are mediated by homologous and evolutionarily
  related protein-interaction motifs, including the death domain (DD), the death effector
  domain (DED) or the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD). Execution of the apoptotic
  process in all instances is dependent on a family of intracellular cysteine proteases,
  called caspases [, –]. These interactions induce caspase activation by cleavage
  in a close proximity [] that enables the activation of the caspase cascade culminating
  in the cleavage of various substrates, such as lamins, fodrin, gelsolin, actin or
  the Inhibitor of Caspase-Activated DNase (ICAD), leading to cell dismantle ().'
