caption: Examples of ciliary chemo-, photo-, and mechanotransduction. a Schematic
  of a single olfactory sensory neuron. Boxed region of interest is magnified and
  illustrates the ciliary signaling pathway. Odorant activation of olfactory G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) results in an increase in cAMP levels, which is mediated by type
  3 adenylyl cyclase (ACIII). This results in activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated
  (CNG) channels leading to an increase in Ca2+ levels, subsequent activation of chloride
  channels, and depolarization of the neuron. b Schematic of a photoreceptor, which
  is comprised of an inner and outer segment that are connected by a “9+0” connecting
  cilium. Proteins are synthesized in the inner segment and transported by IFT across
  the connecting cilium to the outer segment, which is a highly modified cilium, where
  they mediate phototransduction. c Schematic of a renal cilium demonstrating Ca2+signaling
  mediated by the ciliary proteins polycystin 1 (PC1) and polycystin 2 (PC2) in response
  to bending of the cilium by fluid flow. Renal cilia may also act as chemosensors
  by mediating vasopressin activation of the type 2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) on
  the ciliary membrane, which in turn modulates cAMP-signaling
