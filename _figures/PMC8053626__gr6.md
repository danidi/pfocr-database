caption: Schematic of the mechanism of abnormal cholesterol transport in the 827G
  cybrids. A possible pathologic mechanism of cholesterol gallstone formation in the
  827G cybrids. The 827A>G variant of the B4b′d′e′j haplogroups led to decreased abundance
  of proteins related to OXPHOS and to further dysfunction. On the one hand, the levels
  of acetyl coenzyme A, used for cholesterol synthesis, decreased due to downregulation
  of fatty acid oxidation and TCA metabolism processes; on the other hand, high ROS
  levels in the 827G cybrids further activated mitochondrial retrograde signaling
  pathways, including the JNK and AMPK pathways. The JNK pathway reduced biogenesis
  of OXPHOS complexes, which further aggregated mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover,
  downregulation of PPARα/RXRα inhibited cholesterol efflux into peripheral blood
  through the transporter ABCA1. However, AMPK activation may have increased the levels
  of the transporter ABCG5/8, thus increasing the risk of cholesterol entering the
  bile and gallbladder.
