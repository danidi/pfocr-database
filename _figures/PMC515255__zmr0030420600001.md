caption: Signaling pathways of long dsRNAs in the cytoplasm. The major known pathways
  of signaling by long cytoplasmic dsRNAs are shown and are discussed in detail in
  the text. Most long cytoplasmic dsRNAs result from virus infections. Such dsRNAs
  can bind to and activate PKR and 2′,5′-AS as well as activating the interferon pathway.
  Activated PKR phosphorylates a number of targets, including the translation factor
  eIF2α and the IκB protein, leading to translation inhibition and effects on gene
  expression in the nucleus. Activated 2′,5′-AS leads to activation of RNase L, which
  degrades mRNAs. As discussed in the text, long dsRNAs can also lead to apoptosis.
