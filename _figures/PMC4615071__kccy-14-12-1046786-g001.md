caption: Schematic representation of the secretion of miR-122 in exosomes by cancer
  cells. The export of miR-122 allows cancer cells to increase their glucose uptake
  by enhancing GLUT1 expression to support cancer cell growth, while simultaneously
  suppressing glucose uptake in niche cells. Bold arrows represent the favored pathway.
