caption: The presence of mutant SP-C protein in the ER induces the dissociation of
  BiP from three proximal sensors, IRE1, ATF6, and PERK to initiate transcription
  factor cascades for chaperone induction or translation attrenuation. If uncorrected,
  SP-C misfolding sustains both a long-term UPR (= “ER stress”) and an accumulation
  of SP-C aggregates which induces an ER-dependent apoptotic cascade. The linking
  pathways include the participation of the IRE1 sensor, which can independently trigger
  caspase 4 activation or ASK-1 / JNK upregulation. Previously published data () also
  implicates mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (CytC) as a third pathway (----→)
  which is resistant to caspase4 and JNK inhibition. Apoptotic upregulation by BRICHOS
  SP-C mutants occurs independently of CHOP activation (“X”), a transcription factor
  known to induce apoptosis in some other systems.
