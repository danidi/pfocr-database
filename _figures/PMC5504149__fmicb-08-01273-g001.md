caption: Schematic representation of metabolic pathways of Staphylococcus aureus glucose
  and galactose catabolism. Galactose is catabolized in the tagatose 6-phosphate pathway
  into the glycolytic intermediates DHAP and GAP. DHAP and GAP originated from galactose
  and glucose are oxidized to pyruvate in the EMP (glycolysis) pathway, which can
  be reduced to lactate, α-acetolactate and/or acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA can be converted
  to acetate, to generate ATP, and ethanol. Alternatively, acetyl-CoA can be used
  to produce citrate for the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle). Under aerobic conditions,
  the NADH molecules formed in the EMP and TCA cycle are oxidized in the respiratory
  chain, thereby restoring the redox balance, and producing ATP. Proposed pathways
  were reconstructed based on genome information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi),
  literature and database surveys (KEGG, MetaCyc). Inside boxes are the end products
  of pyruvate metabolism. Inside the black box is the ALS enzyme. AAs, amino acids;
  ACS, acetyl-CoA synthetase; ADH, bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase;
