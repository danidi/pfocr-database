caption: A. GCs especially when added in the presence of insulin, mimicking the fed
  state, induce the expression of genes involved in lipid uptake (LPL), TG synthesis
  (LIPIN, AGPAT, DGAT1) and de novo lipogenesis (ACC, FAS). GCs also increase the
  expression of genes involved in TG hydrolysis (ATGL, HSL, MGL). GC induction of
  PCK1 expression is likely to play a role in glyceroneogenesis, contributing to TG
  synthetic pathway. B. GCs increase lipid turnover in adipose tissue. While GCs are
  widely cited as lipolytic and thought to increase systemic FFA, they also increase
  lipid uptake and TG synthesis. Factors that tip this balance toward TG synthesis
  in a depot-dependent manner may lead to hypertrophy of existing adipocytes and hence
  affect regional adiposity.
