caption: Proposed model for Nox-induced ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysregulation in
  diabetes. Based on the data accrued from the current studies, we propose a model
  for the Nox–ROS–JNK signaling in the metabolic dysfunction of the pancreatic β-cell
  under the duress of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Glucotoxicity or lipotoxicity
  induces Nox activation by promoting the phosphorylation of p47phox and Rac1 activation.
  We have recently demonstrated that inhibition of Rac1 activation by NSC23766, or
  prenylation inhibitors, attenuates high glucose- or palmitate-induced Nox activation
  and ROS generation (,). Likewise, inhibition of Nox action by apocynin, diphenylene
  iodonium, or siRNA-p47phox alleviates ROS generation and oxidative stress under
  the duress of high glucose, high palmitate, or cytokines (–). Nox activation and
  excessive ROS generation leads to the activation of stress-activated kinases (JNK1/2),
  culminating in mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase-3 activation. In support of
  this formulation, our current studies using SP600125 demonstrated significant inhibition
  in glucose-induced JNK1/2 phosphorylation and caspase-3 activation. On the basis
  of these data, we propose that the collective effects of Tiam1-mediated Rac1 activation,
  p47phox phosphorylation, Nox holoenzyme assembly, and associated ROS generation,
  followed by inhibition of ERK1/2 and activation of JNK1/2, result in mitochondrial
  dysregulation and caspase-3 activation leading to the islet β-cell dysfunction and
  demise in diabetes. DPI, diphenylene iodonium; siRNA, short interfering RNA; T2DM,
  type 2 diabetes mellitus.
