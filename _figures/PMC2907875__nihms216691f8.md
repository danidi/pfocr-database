caption: 'In the lower portion of the figure, the phenotypes of breast cancer progression
  in vivo are compared with those in the in vitro model. The genomic, epigenetic and
  gene transcription changes are listed and compared among the different stages of
  cancer progression. In the epigenetic changes, the hypermethylated genes at the
  different stages are indicated. In the transformation stage, loss of heterozygosity
  (LOH) in chromosome 13q12.3 and a 5 base-pair deletion in p53 exon 4 were detected.
  In the invasive and tumor stages, several gains and losses have been described.
  EMT: epithelial-mesenchymal transition.'
