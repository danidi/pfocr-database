caption: Communication between the prostate mesenchymal (orange) and epithelial cells
  (green) is essential for normal prostate development. Here recent progress in paracrine
  signaling involved in prostate development is highlighted. Arrows indicate the directionality
  of the communication between the mesenchyme and epithelium. Pathways including the
  Wnt, sonic hedgehog (Shh), androgen receptor (AR), and fibroblast growth factor
  (FGF) pathways are critical for the normal growth, differentiation, and development
  of the prostate. Receptor and ligand locations in the mesenchyme and epithelium
  are depicted in the model. FGF 7, 13, and 14 are secreted by the mesenchyme and
  bind to epithelial FGFR1 and FGFR2. The FGF pathway also works the opposite direction
  where the UGM expresses FGFR1 and the UGE secretes FGF1. Studies using TGFβRII knockout
  in the epithelium or mesenchyme demonstrated that TGFβRII receptor on the UGM was
  important for androgen response. SFRP1 and SFRP2 are expressed in the developing
  UGM and activate non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways by binding to Wnt receptors
  such as Wnt4 that activate epithelial proliferation, . Shh secretion by the UGE
  to activate stromal smoothened (Smo) and patched (Ptch) is critical for normal prostate
  development, but this same pathway can also activate inhibitors of prostate development
  such as Bmp7. Notch expression in the epithelium is required for budding of the
  prostate epithelium, but is restricted to specific locations by mesenchymal Bmp7.
  This complex network of signaling between the UGM and UGE is critical normal prostate
  development.
