caption: Acetylation of IFNαR-ISGF3 pathway is required for the antiviral activity
  of IFNα. Upon stimulation with IFNα, CBP is translocated from the nucleus to the
  cytosol and induces IFNαR acetylation on Lys 399. IRF9 interacts with this acetylation
  site leads to formation of the ISGF3 complex, which includes IRF9, STAT1 and STAT2.
  This complex is then translocated to the nucleus where it binds DNA and drives gene
  expression.
