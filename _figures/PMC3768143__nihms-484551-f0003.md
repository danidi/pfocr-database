caption: Activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway - Microglial cells
  activated by Aβ plaques/ongoing systemic inflammation increase the secretion of
  proinflammatory cytokines. The cytokines activate the ‘cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  pathway’ which increases ACh release. As a response to increased ACh levels, AChE
  activity levels increase to dampen the effect.
