caption: An illustration of how diversified signaling pathways are achieved via allostery
  in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), also known as seven-transmembrane spanning
  receptors (7TMR). The first step of the diversified GPCR signaling involves a process
  of conformational selection among the multiple active states of a single GPCR. The
  population shift toward one of the active GPCR conformations elicited by the bound
  ligand leads to two distinctive pathways, the agonist (G protein-dependent) pathway
  and the biased agonist (arrestin-dependent) pathway. The binding of an agonist referred
  as ‘the classical model’ results in the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins
  and promotes the consequent signaling of second messenger such as cyclic AMP. However,
  the activated conformations of GPCRs also bind and activate GPCR kinases (GRKs)
  to phosphorylate Ser/Thr in the cytoplasmic loops and tail of the GPCR. In turn,
  the phosphorylation enables the recruitment of β-arrestins to mediate receptor desensitization
  and internalization. The biased agonist pathway emphasizes that a distinct active
  GPCR conformation activates a different set of GRKs to create phosphorylation patterns
  (‘barcode’) on GPCR. It is the barcode that imparts distinct conformations (illustrated
  in different colors in the Figure) to the recruited arrestin either through orthosteric
  (at the binding site) or allosteric phosphorylation events, which in turn mediate
  different signaling pathways such as the ERK 1/2 activation. Note that the detailed
  cell/tissue- specific variability of regulated signaling pathways as well as those
  related to isoforms of GPCRs, GRKs, and arrestins, is not included in the Figure
  (; ).
