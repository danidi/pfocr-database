caption: Immediately after injury, SN is released from nerve endings in the cornea
  to recruit circulating neutrophils and induce an initial inflammatory response (Phase
  I). Then necrotic or injured keratocytes release HSPB4 in response to injury and
  oxidative stress. The HSPB4 activates resident macrophages in the cornea via TLR2/NF-κB
  signalling pathway to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1 and IL-6.
  The pro-inflammatory signals released by resident macrophages are amplified by keratocytes
  that produce chemokines to further recruit large amount of neutrophils (Phase II).
  TSG-6 inhibits the initial activation of resident macrophages by modulating TLR2/CD44/NF-κB
  signalling and thereby decreases the Phase II inflammatory response.
