caption: The depicted interactions involving HVEM that initiate positive cosignaling
  through LIGHT-HVEM interaction or inhibitory signaling through HVEM binding BTLA.
  LIGHT bound to HVEM activates (+) TRAF-dependent activation of NF-κB, whereas HVEM-BTLA
  acts through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of BTLA to recruit
  the phosphatase SHP-2, attenuating kinases activated by TCR signaling. The HSV virion
  envelope protein gD attaches to HVEM, acting as an entry step for infection. The
  binding of gD to HVEM competitively blocks BTLA binding and non-competitively prevents
  LIGHT binding, inhibiting both intercellular communication pathways. UL144 of human
  CMV binds to BTLA but not LIGHT, selectively mimicking the inhibitory pathway of
  HVEM-BTLA. DcR3 is a soluble TNFR family member that binds to LIGHT, acting as a
  circulating inhibitor of LIGHT-HVEM signaling. The CRD1 of each protein is shown
  as a gray oval ().
