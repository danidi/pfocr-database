caption: A, The scaffolding proteins Gab1 and Gab2 have opposing roles in the regulation
  of Akt phosphorylation. Gab2 binds to the receptor complex more transiently, and
  its dissociation is hypothesized to be mediated by Shp2. A detailed schematic using
  Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN) [] [] is shown in Figure S1 in . B, Along
  with the signaling pathways, canonical pathways apply to all receptor complexes.
  All receptors or receptor complexes are internalized, recycled and degraded at different
  rates for ligated and unligated receptors. These parameters are estimated based
  on optimization of model outputs against experimental data. VEGF may dissociate
  from all VEGFR2 complexes, resulting in a disintegration of the complex. ‘iR2’ and
  ‘dR2’ refers to internalized and degraded receptors respectively. ‘X’ refers to
  any molecular species bound to VEGFR2.
