caption: Model of cell junction formation and maturation under RhoGTPase control in
  epithelial cells. (a) Initiation of AJ formation. Nectin is recruited at cell–cell
  adhesion sites. The interaction between nectin molecules drives Rac1 and Cdc42 activation,
  which in turn modulate IQGAP1. Further, nectin interacts with afadin, which indirectly
  interacts with vinculin. Consequently, cytoskeleton reorganization occurs driving
  recruitment of already formed cadherin–catenin complexes to the cell adhesion sites.
  The recruitment of the cadherin–catenin complexes is aided by afadin's direct interaction
  with α-catenin and indirect interaction with vinculin, α-actinin and p120-catenin,
  which increases cadherin adhesion by driving further interactions between cadherin
  extracellular domains on adjacent cells. (b) Adherens junction expansion and initiation
  of tight junction formation. Cadherin–cadherin interactions activate Rac1 signalling
  by recruiting Abl kinase and the RacGEF, TIAM1. Nectin interactions at the cell–cell
  interface activate Cdc42. In turn, Rac1 and Cdc42 activate WAVE and Arp2/3, promoting
  branched actin polymerization and lamellipodial formation, thereby promoting further
  cell–cell contact and cadherin clustering. Rac1 also promotes p190RhoGAP recruitment
  to cadherin clusters, which together with Abl and Arp2/3, ensure Rho signal silencing.
  While cadherin–catenin clusters start to form, ZO1 is recruited to the primordial
  junction through α-catenin and/or afadin. ZO1 then triggers TJ formation by recruiting
  JAMs. Tuba and MgcRacGAP are also recruited to junction formation sites and further
  promote Cdc42 activation. Later, nectin–cadherin clusters recruit Crumbs (CRB3)
  which triggers the rearrangement of protein complexes and cell polarization. (c)
  Adherens and tight junction maturation requires a switch from Rac1 to RhoA signalling.
  Par3 is recruited to nascent TJ sites where it inhibits TIAM1 and therefore Rac1
  signalling. Additionally, α-catenin recruits the centralspindlin complex, which
  simultaneously activates RhoA and inactivates Rac1 by inhibiting p190RhoGAP localization
  at AJs. RhoA is also activated at TJs by p114RhoGEF and ARHGEF11 recruitment. Once
  activated, RhoA acts on formins and Myo-IIA (through moderate ROCK activation) promoting
  the formation of an actomyosin ring at the ZA. (d) Summary of pathways acting downstream
  of RhoGTPases Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA, which regulate cell adhesion by modulating adherens
  and tight junction formation, maturation and stability. All three proteins regulate
  junction assembly and stability by modulating cytoskeleton dynamics and protein
  turnover. Depending on the circumstances (cell type, process regulated, timing,
  pathway on which they act) any of them can promote junction assembly and stabilization
  or junction disassembly. Asterisk marks processes that lead to loss of cell adhesion
  and increased cell spreading, migration, or invasion.
