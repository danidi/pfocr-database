caption: A simplified metabolic scheme and signal transduction pathway for ABA and
  H2O2 in the leaves of pumpkin-grafted cucumber seedlings exposed to 80 mM Ca(NO3)2.
  The model is based on the results presented here. The red arrow (dotted line) indicates
  possible metabolic pathways in our experiment.
