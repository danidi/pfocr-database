caption: Numbers represent fold increase (↑) or decrease (↓) in mRNA expression as
  derived from microarray analysis (Cyp27a1 expression was measured by real-time PCR).
  +/− denotes unchanged expression. Only those genes represented on the Affymetrix
  chip are shown. Broken and dotted lines represent positive and negative regulation
  respectively. 1, 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; 2, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase; 3, mevalonate kinase; 4, diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase; 5, squalene
  synthase; 6, squalene epoxidase; 7, lanosterol synthase; 8, lanosterol demethylase
  (Cyp51); 9, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase; 10, cholesterol 27α-hydroxylase (Cyp27a1);
  11, oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7b1); 12, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (Cyp7a1);
  13, 3β-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase (HSD3B7); 14, sterol 12α-hydroxylase (Cyp8b1).
