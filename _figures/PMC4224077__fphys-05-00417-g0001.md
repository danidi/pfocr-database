caption: Overview of the processes accounted for by the coagulation model. The blood
  coagulation model represents the biochemical reactions that result in factor activation.
  The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of the model lead to thrombin and fibrin formation
  downstream of Factor Xa, known as the common pathway. Drug action is represented
  by the competitive inhibition of Factor Xa by rivaroxaban and by down-regulation
  of the vitamin K-dependent synthesis (arched arrow) of the factors VII, IX, and
  X, and prothrombin (Factor II) by warfarin. These structural elements of the coagulation
  cascade, as well as proteins C and S (not depicted), formed the basis of the model
  by Burghaus et al. ().
