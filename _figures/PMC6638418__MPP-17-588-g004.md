caption: 'srfr1‐1 specifically upregulates the MYC2 branch of the jasmonic acid (JA)
  response pathway on S podoptera exigua feeding compared with RLD. Schematics of
  simplified JA/ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) pathways. Marker gene mRNA levels
  were taken from the data presented in Fig. S4. Genes that were upregulated in both
  replicates of the indicated pair‐wise comparisons are shown in a yellow box, whereas
  downregulated genes are shown in a blue box (empty box: no consistent change). See
  Table S1 for Wilcoxon signed‐rank test statistics.'
