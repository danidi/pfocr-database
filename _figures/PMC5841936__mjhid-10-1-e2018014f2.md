caption: The SLAMF receptors are structurally characterized by IgV and IgC2 domains
  within an extracellular portion and one or more ITSMs, depicted as a closed rectangle,
  within the cytoplasmic portion. The mostly homophilic interactions between SLAMF
  receptors result in their costimulatory effects on TCR/CD3 complex signaling pathway.
  When the SLAMF receptor is engaged by its ligand, cytoplasmic domain ITSMs with
  tyrosine-based motifs undergo phosphorylation, recruiting adaptors proteins, SAP
  or EAT-2. SAP can then recruit the Src family protein tyrosine kinase Fyn or Lck,
  which is important for activation via SLAM family receptors. The coupling of EAT-2
  carboxyl-terminal tail to the PLC-γ SH2 domains leads to an additional activation
  pathway. ITSM-like motif (non-ITSM) depicted as an unfilled rectangle does not bind
  SAP or EAT-2. SAP is mostly expressed in T cells, while EAT-2 is primarily expressed
  in antigen-presenting cells.
