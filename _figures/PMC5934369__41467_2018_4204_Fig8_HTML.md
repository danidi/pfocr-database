caption: Genes coding for plant fiber degrading enzymes are enriched in the Treponema-abundant,
  LF-associated WLG enterotype 2, while genes encoding enzymes involved in fucose
  degradation are elevated in the Prevotella-abundant enterotype 3. Box-and-whiskers
  plots showing the relative abundance (in counts per million sequences, cpm) of a
  endoglucanase, b cellodextrinase, c alpha-glucuronidase, d ligninase, and e xyloglucanase
  (identified by HUMAnN2 analysis) in WLG enterotypes 1 (n = 5), 2 (n = 5), 3 (n = 5)
  and 4 (n = 4). f Schematic of the pathway for fucose degradation, along with box-and-whiskers
  plots showing the relative abundance (in counts per million sequences, cpm) of genes
  (identified by HUMAnN2 analysis) encoding the enzymes or transporter in samples
  from WLG enterotypes 1 (n = 5), 2 (n = 5), 3 (n = 5) and 4 (n = 4). Two-tailed P-values
  from Mann–Whitney tests are indicated. NS not significant at α = 0.05
