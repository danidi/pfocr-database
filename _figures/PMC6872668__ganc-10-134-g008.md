caption: The data demonstrate that the consequences of switch from Smad2 to Smad3
  signaling pathway results in converting TGF-β from tumor suppressor to pro-oncogene
  as cells acquire increasing malignant properties through Smad3 mediated TMEPAI expression.
pmcid: PMC6872668
papertitle: Increased Smad3 and reduced Smad2 levels mediate the functional switch
  of TGF-β from growth suppressor to growth and metastasis promoter through TMEPAI/PMEPA1
  in triple negative breast cancer.
