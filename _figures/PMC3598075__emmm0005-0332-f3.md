caption: The anti-bacterial reagent mupirocin targets the bacterial IARS synthetic
  active site by blocking Ile-AMP binding.The anti-fungal reagent AN2690 targets the
  yeast LARS editing active site by boron-mediated trapping of tRNALeu.The anti-fibrotic
  reagent halofuginone targets synthetic active site of PRS in human EPRS, triggering
  the AAR pathway and inhibiting Th17-cell differentiation.
