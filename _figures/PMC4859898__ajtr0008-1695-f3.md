caption: 'Mitochondrial dysfunction signaling pathway regulated by CDDO-Me in Ec109
  cells. Notes: Ec109 cells were treated with 0.5 μM CDDO-Me for 24 hours and the
  protein samples were subject to quantitative proteomic analysis. Red indicates an
  upregulation; green indicates a downregulation. The intensity of green and red molecule
  colors indicates the degree of down- or upregulation, respectively. Solid arrows
  indicate direct interaction and dashed arrows indicate indirect interaction. Abbreviations:
  CDDO-Me, methyl ester of 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid.'

papertitle: The therapeutic response of CDDO-Me in the esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
  (ESCC) cells is mediated by CaMKIIα.
