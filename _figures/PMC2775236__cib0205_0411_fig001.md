caption: The effect of neuronal activity on the function of the miR379-410 cluster
  member miR-134. (A) Schematic representation of miR379-410 cluster dependent dendritogenesis
  pathway. Neuronal activity induces Mef2-dependent transcription of microRNAs from
  the miR379-410 cluster. At least three of them (miR-134, -329 and -381) are necessary
  for activity-dependent dendritogenesis. The targets of miR-329/381 are unknown.
  One of the miR-134 targets important for dendritogenesis is Pum2. Enhanced expression
  of miR-134 blocks Pum2 translation. Reduced Pum2 expression, in turn, allows the
  synthesis of dendrite growth promoting factors (and/or interferes with the synthesis
  of inhibiting factors). (B) miR-134 regulates dendritic spine size. Bdnf (neuronal
  activity) application inhibits the repressive effect of miR-134 on translation of
  Limk1 mRNA which leads to increased spine size.
