caption: 'A summary of the biochemical reactions involving folate and vitamin B12
  inside an oligodendrocyte and proposed inhibition of myelin production by co-administration
  of methotrexate (MTX) and drugs affecting vitamin B12. Abbreviations: 5-MTHF (5-methyltetrahydrofolate,
  levomefolic acid), MB 12 (methyl B12), THF (tetrahydrofolate, tetrahydrofolic acid),
  5,10-MTHF (5,10-methylene THF), DHF (dihydrofolate, dihydrofolic acid), DHFR (dihydrofolate
  reductase), MB 12 (methyl-vitamin B12), MTHFR (methylenetetrafolate reductase),
  MTX (methotrexate), met synthase (methionine synthase), SHMT (serine hydroxyl-methyltransferase).
  MTHF participates in the production of methionine from homocysteine by methionine
  synthase, catalyzed by MB12 and zinc, creating THF and methionine. THF participates
  in the production of purines and pyrimidines for DNA synthesis. Methionine is a
  vital amino acid involved in myelin production via its conversion to S-adenosyl
  methionine (SAM). SAM is involved in the methylation of many proteins and intermediates
  ultimately involved in myelin production, such as phosphatidylcholine, which is
  important in the production of sphingomyelin, a major component of the myelin sheath.
  Homocysteine can be converted to homocysteic acid and homocysteine sulfinic acid
  which are excitotoxic glutamate analogues acting at the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)
  receptor, which may be a factor in acute methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity. Methotrexate
  inhibits the function of DHFR, preventing the conversion of DHF to MTHF. Active
  vitamin B12 contains reduced cobalt (Co+), but nitrous oxide (N2O) produces irreversible
  oxidation to Co++ and Co+++, rendering vitamin B12 inactive. Any simultaneous compromise
  of folate and vitamin B12 via co-administration of methotrexate and agents known
  to deplete active vitamin B12, such as N2O could result in increased homocysteine
  and reduced methionine levels both of which may contribute to the neurotoxic effects
  of methotrexate treatment. Other as yet unidentified compounds may also reduce bioavailable
  vitamin B12 levels. Blue arrows indicate proposed increase or reduction in various
  relevant pathway metabolites'
