caption: Models for organization of CO2signaling pathways. Two alternative models
  for architecture of CO2response pathways are shown. A model with distinct nonneuronal
  CO2 sensors that each modulate immune and other downstream effects, such as Na,K-ATPase
  endocytosis, is shown in blue. A model in which a single CO2 sensor leads to a branched
  pathway is shown in red. Genes and responses known to be conserved in CO2signaling
  between mammals and Drosophila are shown in green.
