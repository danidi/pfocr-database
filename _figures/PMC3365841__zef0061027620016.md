caption: GPCR-modulated channel activity in pituitary cells. GPCRs expressed in pituitary
  cells regulate numerous voltage-gated channels through intracellular messengers.
  Top panel shows agonists that activate GPCRs in mammalian cells. Red letters indicate
  the principal regulators of pituitary functions, and black letters indicate agonists
  that modulate pituitary cell function. Note that only somatotrophs utilize all three
  signaling pathways and that lactotroph function is regulated by numerous Gi and
  Gq/11-coupled receptors. Melatonin receptors are present only in neonatal pituitary
  gonadotrophs. Bottom panel shows channels expressed in pituitary cells in which
  gating is affected by an intracellular messenger. The nature of Nab current is unknown
  at the present time, as well as the Na+-conducting channel that is phosphorylated
  by PKA. It has also not been clarified whether inhibition of erg and M current accounts
  for agonist-induced depolarization of cells and sustained stimulation. The operation
  of the STIM/Orai pathway in pituitary cells has not been established.
