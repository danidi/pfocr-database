caption: Schematic diagram showing plausible mode of action of curcumin in protecting
  HT22 cells and cellular response during hypoxic stress in vitro. Hypoxia-driven
  ROS generation evokes oxidative stress and reduced expression Prdx6 that leads to
  ER stress. In the cellular redox environment, cytoplasmic IκBα is phosphorylated
  and degraded. NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and binds to Prdx6 gene promoter,
  which leads repression of Prdx6 gene transcription. In HT22 cells, curcumin inhibits
  NF-κB signaling pathway and relieves Prdx6 transcription that in turn blocks feed-forward
  deleterious signaling due to cellular abundance of Prdx6.
