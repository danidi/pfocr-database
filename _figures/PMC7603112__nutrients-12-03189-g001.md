caption: Vitamin D metabolic pathway by cytochrome P450 oxidases (CYPs). Vitamin D
  is hydroxylated at the C25 site by CYP2R1 or CYP27A1 in the liver leading to the
  production of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. The 25(OH)D is hydroxylated at the
  C1α site by CYP27B1 in the kidney, producing 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D].
  Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D are metabolized by CYP24A1, inactivated and in part
  excreted into the feces as bile or in urine.
