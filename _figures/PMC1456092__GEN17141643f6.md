caption: Model of Fz activation in PCP and Arm signaling. In the absence of a Wnt
  ligand, Fz has an intrinsic ability to signal to the PCP pathway. This may occur
  via a direct interaction with Dsh. When Wg is present, the coreceptor Arr is brought
  into proximity to Fz, which results in the close apposition of Dsh and Axn. This
  combination of intracellular components switches the output of Fz from PCP to Arm
  signaling.
