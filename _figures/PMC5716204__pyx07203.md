caption: Waiting impulsivity model. (A) Waiting impulsivity at rest. Functional connectivity
  at rest suggests high impulsivity associated with decreased functional connectivity
  of indirect pathway implicating high tonic subthalamic nucleus (STN) output and
  impaired thalamocortical regulation. Decreased functional connectivity of the subgenual
  cingulate (SgAcc) and STN may be relevant to hyperdirect fast reactive signalling
  of environmental context. (B) Waiting impulsivity in response to high rewards. However,
  high impulsivity is associated with enhanced sensitivity to high value rewards with
  greater orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) activity and enhanced functional connectivity
  with the STN. In response to high reward cues, high impulsivity is associated with
  greater functional connectivity between the SgAcc, a region implicated in motivational
  processes, and the anterior insula (AntIns) implicated in the transition from impulsive
  to compulsive processes, and lower functional connectivity with regions implicated
  in response and motor control (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC; and M1).
