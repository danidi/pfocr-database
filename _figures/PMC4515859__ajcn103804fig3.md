caption: Biochemical network of arachidonic acid metabolism. Combined transcriptomic
  and metabolic network analysis of differences in arachidonic acid metabolism between
  VAT and SAT adipose tissues. Metabolites are illustrated as circles; genes are illustrated
  as squares. Significant (FDR <0.05) members of the network are colored red or green
  (higher or lower in VAT, respectively). Node size is proportional to fold change.
  No oxylipins, prostaglandins, or leukotrienes were measured in this study, but orange
  indicates a predicted alteration in abundances in VAT based on the combined measured
  metabolic network. Blue indicates a group of multiple metabolites being accepted
  as substrate/product. FDR, false discovery rate; LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine;
  PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; SAT, subcutaneous adipose tissue; VAT, visceral adipose
  tissue.
