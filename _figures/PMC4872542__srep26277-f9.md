caption: 'Bupivacaine induced ovarian cancer (SKOV3) cell death was associated with
  the activation of caspase 8 and 9, while only cleaved caspase 8 involved in prostate
  cancer cell death. The death pathway induced by bupivacaine is not linked to FAS
  receptor. The phosphorylation of GSK-3β on tyr 216 residue promote the sensitivity
  of ovarian cancer cells to bupivacaine induced cytotoxicity. Dashed line: death
  pathway for prostate cancer, solid line: death pathway for ovarain cancer. FAS-L = FAS
  ligand; GSK-3β = Glycogen synthase kinase-3β.'
