caption: Network analysis of the host factors found to be associated with the extremities
  of the murine norovirus genome. The interaction network shows the proteins identified
  as being associated with the MNV genome by riboproteomics, as described in the text.
  The proteins shown were identified with a probability greater than 90% and with
  at least 2 unique peptides showing at least a 90% peptide identification probability.
  To simplify these interdependencies, host factors that interacted with themselves
  only or did not interact with other factors in the network are not shown. Proteins
  shaded in orange were identified using only the the 5′ extremity of MNV genomic
  RNA and those shaded in blue were identified using the 3′ extremity, while proteins
  shaded in gray were identified using both RNA targets. Proteins in brackets represent
  those further characterized during this study. Note that the network was generated
  using the data presented in  and  as well as additional experimental data sets.
  Proteins not identified in the data set illustrated in  and  and  are highlighted
  with an asterisk. The interaction network was generated using the Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis program (Ingenuity Systems). Full lines represent direct interactions,
  while dashed lines indicate indirect interactions. An arrow pointing from one protein
  to another indicates that the first protein acts on or activates the second protein
  (at which the arrow is pointing).
