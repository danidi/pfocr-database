caption: The roles of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP) in glycolysis and pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP) and its proposed extracellular action. Diagram showing the
  main steps in glycolysis, its relationship to the PPP and the roles of F1,6BP. Glucose
  enters cytoplasm via glucose transporters (GLUT3 in neurons or GLUT1 in glia), where
  glycolysis takes place. Glucose is first phosphorylated to glucose-6-P (G6P), is
  further converted to F1,6BP, and is ultimately catalyzed to pyruvate, which then
  enters mitochondria to participate in the TCA cycle. G6P also enters the PPP, which
  generates reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and glutathione
  (GSH) to prevent the cell damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Accumulation
  of F1,6BP weakly inhibits F6P conversion to F1,6BP, and potently shunts G6P into
  PPP, leading to the production of GSH. In addition, exogenous F1,6BP may interfere
  with voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) and reduce Ca2+ influx, based on evidence
  in this study.
