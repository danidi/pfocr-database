caption: Model of the Proposed PRR7 Function in Phytochrome-Regulated Seedling Deetiolation
  and Phasing of the Circadian Oscillator.Light perceived by phytochromes induces
  both seedling deetiolation and oscillations in expression of the central clock–component
  genes CCA1, LHY, and TOC1. PRR7 acts positively in the pathway that controls seedling
  photomorphogenesis but negatively in the circadian cycle by transiently repressing
  or delaying CCA1 and LHY expression during a temporally defined window and by antagonizing
  or repressing the promotive activity of TOC1. PRR7 expression also is controlled
  by the circadian clock.
