caption: 'Eicosanoid biosynthesis and EP receptor signaling pathway. A) Phospholipids
  from the plasma membrane are mobilized and coverted to arachidonic acid (AA) by
  phospholipase A2 (PLA2). COX enzymes convert AA to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) precursor
  molecule which is then converted to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) by the synthase molecule
  PGES. Once produced PGE2 can exert its effects in one of two ways. 1) PGE2 can be
  exported into the extracellular microenvironment by multidrug resistance-associated
  protein four (MRP4) where PGE2 can bind to its cognate receptors, the E-series of
  prostaglandin receptors (EP) on the plasma membrane of a tumor cell, stromal cell
  or immune effector cell such as a T or Natural Killer (NK) cell. 2) After being
  synthesized by PGES, PGE2 can directly act on EP receptors located on the nuclear
  membrane. After binding its receptor, PGE2 can be transported back into the cytoplasm
  through a passive mechanism or actively through a prostaglandin transporter (PGT).
  PGE2 is inactivated by 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and converted
  to 15-keto-PGE2. B) EP receptors are G-protein coupled receptors of which four subtypes
  exist: EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4. Each receptor is coupled to a different intracellular
  signaling pathway. The EP2 and EP4 receptors are linked to stimulation of cyclic
  AMP (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling through sequential activation of
  Gαs and adenylate cyclase (AC). EP4 can also activate phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  (PI3K) through Gαi. The EP1 receptor leads to elevation of intracellular calcium
  through Gαq. EP3 exists in multiple isoforms which are generated through alternative
  splicing and differing at their carboxy terminal tail. These isoforms are capable
  of eliciting different intracellular responses through multiple signal transduction
  pathways. The majority of the isoforms act to inhibit cAMP generation via Gαi. Ligand
  binding can also lead to an increase in IP3/ intracellular calcium. Another isoform
  can act to stimulate adenylyl cyclase leading to an increase in cAMP. On immune
  effector cells, PGE2 acting through the EP receptors can modulate the function of
  various immune effector cells. PGE2 acting through its cognate receptor can inhibit
  NK cell activity and cytotoxic T cell proliferation leading to a decrease in target
  cell lysis. C) There is now growing evidence to support perinuclear and/or nuclear
  localization of functional EP receptors. To date EP1, EP2, EP3α, and EP4 have been
  shown to be colocalized at the nuclear membranes of a variety of cell types and
  tissues. Nuclear EP receptors could exert different effects from their plasma membrane
  counterparts; however, the signaling pathways for nuclear receptors have yet to
  be determined.'
