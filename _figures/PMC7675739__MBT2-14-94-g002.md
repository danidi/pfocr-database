caption: Iterative design of DBTL (design–build–test–learn) cycle for the identification
  of flavonoids as inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2 Mpro. Design step includes the selection
  of target compounds based on previous works, the in silico design of production
  pathways, optimal pathway segregation, identification of enzymes and the selection
  of microbial hosts to express the minimal metabolic modules (precursors, assembly
  and functionalization). Build stage is based on combinatorial DNA assembly methods
  to construct metabolic pathways that will be finally expressed in different components
  of a synthetic microbial consortium. Test stage includes production of the target
  compounds and the development of a synthetic protease inhibition biosensor to analyse
  biological activity using high‐throughput screening technologies. Learn stage processes
  the analytical data from the above steps and finds connections between compound
  structures, inhibition activities and metabolic fluxes to give recommendations to
  perform subsequent DBTL cycles.
