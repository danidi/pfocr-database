caption: Capsule and cell wall biosynthesis. Activated nucleotide sugar donors (shown
  as NDP-hexagon) are synthesized in the cytosol. Some glycans, including the chitin
  and glucan polymers of the cell wall, are made directly from these cytosolic precursors
  by synthetic enzymes (green). Other glycan structures are made in the secretory
  pathway (ER/Golgi), including protein N- and O-linked glycans and capsule polymers.
  Nucleotide sugar precursors for these reactions are transported into the secretory
  compartment by NSTs (dark blue) for use by glycosyltransferase enzymes (purple)
  located there; this cartoon shows elongation and subsequent export of a capsule
  fiber (light blue). In many cases glycan synthetic reactions release an NDP moiety
  that is subsequently cleaved by NDPase (red); the resulting phosphate is exported
  by the phosphate transporter (orange) while the NMP product serves as an NST antiport
  substrate.
