caption: Tryptophan pathway. Pathway map presenting the key metabolites that reported
  significant inter-group differences following Kruskal-Wallis tests. Post hoc Dunn
  tests revealed that those highlighted with red shading were significantly lower
  in the AD group in serum, whilst those highlighted with blue shading were significantly
  lower in AD in urine. The downstream metabolites are inherently more polar and are
  therefore fit with biological and metabolic logic that polar, downstream metabolites
  would be renally excreted and therefore altered in urine
