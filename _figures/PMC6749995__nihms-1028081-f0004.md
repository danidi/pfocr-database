caption: Primary tumours secrete various growth factors, cytokines and enzymes (vascular
  endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), placental growth factor (P1GF), transforming
  growth factor-β (TGFP), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and lysyl oxidase) and shed
  extracellular vesicles into the circulation that systemically impact the lung microenvironment.
  Tumour-derived factors can also activate bone marrow compartments, resulting in
  the mobilization and recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells into the lungs. Together,
  these activities contribute to the generation of pre-metastatic niches in the lung.
  Extravasation of disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) into the lung parenchyma is facilitated
  by microRNA miR-105 delivered by breast cancer exosomes, which silence the tight
  junction protein zona occludens 1 (ZO1) to allow DTCs to breach vascular barriers.
  In addition, CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) gradients recruit CC-chemokine receptor
  2 (CCR2)+ inflammatory monocytes, which produce VEGF to increase vascular permeability.
  Following extravasation, the pre-metastatic niche contributes to the seeding and
  colonization of the DTCs in the lungs. Hypoxia in primary breast tumours upregulates
  lysyl oxidase, which systemically oxidizes lysine residues in collagen and elastin,
  resulting in covalent crosslinking of these molecules in the lungs. Collagen crosslinking
  increases the adhesion of myeloid cells to generate microenvironments conducive
  to DTC colonization. Platelets secrete CXC-chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5) and CXCL7,
  which recruit granulocytes to facilitate metastatic seeding. Exosome-derived small
  nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) activate Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in lung alveolar type
  II cells to induce chemokine secretion, which in turn mediates neutrophil recruitment.
  Neutrophils, via arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5)-dependent leukotriene synthesis,
  stimulate adhesion, chemotaxis and vascular permeability to support colonization
  of leukotriene receptor-positive DTCs. In addition, the extracellular matrix (ECM)
  component fibronectin enables clustering of bone marrow-derived VEGF receptor 1
  (VEGFR1)+ haematopoietic cells, leading to increased production of CXCL12, which
  recruits CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)+ DTCs to the pre-metastatic niche. Following
  seeding of DTCs, α4 integrin-expressing macrophages interact with vascular cell
  adhesion protein 1 (VCAM1)+ DTCs to induce pro-survival AKT signalling. The polarized
  neutrophils in the pre-metastatic lungs may suppress activation of CD8+ T cells
  to dampen anti-metastatic immunity. Subsequently, metastatic outgrowth is supported
  by various pathways. Neutrophils may secrete cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase
  to proteolytically degrade the antitumorigenic factor thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) to
  promote the metastatic outgrowth. Tumour-secreted factors induce expression of chemoattractants,
  such as S100A8 and S100A9, by lung endothelial cells and MAC1 (also known as CD11b)+
  myeloid cells, which facilitate the homing of tumour cells to the pre-metastatic
  niche, through the induction of serum amyloid A3 (SAA3). Notably, SAA3 stimulates
  nuclear factor-κβ (NF-κβ) signalling in a TLR4-dependent manner to facilitate inflammation-mediated
  metastasis. DTCs can induce expression of periostin or tenacin C in lung fibroblasts
  to support cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance and expansion through WNT and Notch
  signalling, respectively. The colonized mesenchymal tumour cells may undergo an
  epithelial conversion that is supported by paracrine interactions with reprogrammed
  monocytic cells. The myeloid-derived proteoglycan versican mediates inhibition of
  the TGFβ-SMAD2 or SMAD3 pathway in DTCs that induces mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
  (MET) and promotes metastatic outgrowth. Through another mechanism, mesenchymal
  DTCs can also express TSP2 to activate local fibroblasts, which in turn promote
  MET of cancer cells. Lastly, metastatic outgrowth can be facilitated by infiltrating
  bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and endothelial cells, which
  contribute to the switch to angiogenesis. The pre-metastatic niche can exhibit features
  of metastasis suppression, as lung endothelial cells expressing CX3C-chemokine ligand
  1 (CX3CL1) attract CX3C-chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1)+ patrolling monocytes, which
  through expression of CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5 recruit cytotoxic natural killer (NK)
  cells to inhibit metastasis. Similarly, metastatic incompetent tumours express the
  glycoprotein prosaposin, which systemically reprogrammes myeloid cells in the lungs
  to express TSP1, which inhibits metastatic outgrowth. G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating
  factor; IL-1β, inter1eukin-1β; LY6C, lymphocyte antigen 6C; MMP9, matrix metalloproteinase
