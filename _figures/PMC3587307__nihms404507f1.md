caption: (A) LEM2 is a negative regulator of ERK signaling during muscle differentiation.
  Although the mechanism by which ERK1/2 is inhibited is unclear, one possibility
  could be through the sequestration of ERK1/2 to the nuclear periphery. Emerin has
  been shown to play a role in two different signaling cascades. First, it negatively
  regulates Wnt signaling by preventing accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus,
  presumably by stimulating export of β-catenin. Second, emerin negatively regulates
  ERK signaling through unclear mechanisms. MAN1 negatively regulates TGF-β signaling
  by sequestering R-Smads away from gene targets. (B) During myogenesis, NET39 acts
  as a repressor of the mTOR-IGF-II signaling pathway. NET39 blocks IGF-II transcription
  by inhibiting mTOR activity at the NE. NET37, an INM protein with glycosidase activity
  promotes myogenesis by activating AKT signaling through the maturation and secretion
  of IGF-II in the PNS/ER.
