caption: Pathways by which prospective immigrant dogs and cats can enter Britain,
  with or without rabies infection, accounting for all relevant control measures and
  points of interception. Each branching point indicates—in chronological sequence—the
  dichotomies rabies infected/uninfected, checked/not checked, quarantined/not quarantined
  and legal/illegal. Six possible outcomes are captured in the boxes at the foot of
  the diagram. Knowing the number of prospective immigrants (top), and the proportion
  that travel down each pathway, we can calculate the risk of a rabid animal entering
  Britain (GB) and escaping all checks and detection in quarantine (by either of the
  two routes marked in grey) [].
