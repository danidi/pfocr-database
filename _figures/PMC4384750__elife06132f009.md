caption: 'In untreated cells, mutant EGFR drives cell survival by activating downstream
  signaling pathways, including PI3K and MAPK, which inhibit apoptosis through transcriptional
  and post-transcriptional effects on BH3-domain proteins, including pro-apoptotic
  BIM and BMF. In most cells (red lines), erlotinib treatment results in EGFR inhibition,
  inhibition of downstream signaling and increased pro-apoptotic proteins, leading
  to apoptosis. The high SOX2 induced by erlotinib through activation of FOXO6 in
  some cells (blue lines) counteracts the pro-apoptotic effects of EGFR inhibition,
  sufficiently decreasing the levels of BIM and BMF to delay the apoptotic response.DOI:
