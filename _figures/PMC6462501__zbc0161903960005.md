caption: Systematic association of the MSC components with mTOR and DNA repair pathways.
  Network models describing interactions of MSC–ARS/AIMPs with molecules involved
  in the mTOR signaling (A) and HR-based DNA repair pathways (B) in H. sapiens. Pink
  diamonds and orange circles represent MSC–ARS/AIMPs and their interactors in the
  pathways, respectively. Pink lines are the interactions between MSC–ARS/AIMPs and
  their interactors in the two pathways. Gray lines indicate the known interactions
  among the cellular factors in the pathways. Known activation (arrows) and inhibition
  (inhibition symbols) information obtained from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
  (KEGG) pathway database and the previous literature are denoted with black lines.
  Solid and dashed lines are direct and indirect interactions between the molecules,
  respectively. Active interactions between the pairs of MSC–ARS/AIMPs and the molecules
  in the pathways with significant mRNA expression–survival correlations are highlighted
  with thick pink lines. See supporting information for methodological details. ATP6V1A/B2/D/E1/F
  are the components of ATPases in phagosomes or lysosomes (A). QRS interacts with
  MRE11, a component of MRN complex involved in the initial processing of double-strand
  DNA breaks before HR-based DNA repair. EPRS and DRS interact with RPA1/2/3 that
  prevent ssDNA from winding back before HR-based DNA repair. QRS, LRS, and AIMP3
  interact with H2AFX, ABL1, and ATR, respectively, which are involved in RAD51-mediated
  heteroduplex formation during HR-based DNA repair. QRS interacts with XRCC3 and
  DDX1 involved in DNA extension during HR-based DNA repair (B).
