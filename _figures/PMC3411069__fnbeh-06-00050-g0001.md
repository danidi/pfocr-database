caption: 'Diagram illustrating select connectivity of brain structures involved in
  the voluntary control of rodent behavior. Four regions of rodent striatum are indicated
  by labels and color; the color gradient approximates the gradient of afferent projections
  (Voorn et al., ). Corresponding color in the other structures represents general
  projection topography. Note that ventral hippocampus has direct projections outside
  of the hippocampal formation, whereas the dorsal hippocampus does not (see text).
  Tapered arrows indicate highly convergent input. Output of the striatum can proceed
  through two distinct pathways to reach the thalamus and other targets: a “direct”
  pathway that has a disinhibitory effect (+), and an indirect pathway that has an
  inhibitory effect (−). These pathways are innervated by separate populations of
  medium spiny neurons in the striatum that predominantly express D1 (direct) or D2
  (indirect) dopamine receptors. Projections from dopamine neurons in the VTA and
  SNc are shown in red. The overarching organization is that of loops linking neocortex,
  basal ganglia, and thalamus. The table indicates some characteristic features of
  dissociated behavioral control systems, with color indicating corresponding brain
  structures. Abbreviations for the table: stimulus (S), context (C), affective outcome
  (Oa), response (R), specific outcome (O). Abbreviations for the main figure: DLS,
  dorsolateral striatum; DMS, dorsomedial striatum; VSc, core of the nucleus accumbens
  in ventral striatum; VSs, shell of the nucleus accumbens in ventral striatum; VTA,

  pars reticulata, P, pallidum; STN, subthalamic nucleus; dH, dorsal hippocampus;
