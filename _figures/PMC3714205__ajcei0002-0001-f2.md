caption: 'Signaling via by cytokines and growth factors and its negative regulation
  by SOCS proteins. Cytokines (A) or growth factors (B) bind to their respective cell
  surface receptors, Cytokine receptors (CytoRs) and Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs),
  leading to receptor dimerization. For CytoRs this leads to activation of associated
  intracellular JAKs, which phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor complex,
  creating docking site for STATs. These are then phosphorylated, enabling dimerization
  with other STATs, followed by translocation to the nucleus, where they act as transcription
  factors to induce expression of target genes that mediate a range of biological
  processes. These targets include SOCS genes capable of regulating receptor signaling,
  creating a negative feedback loop. RTKs possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity
  and may by-pass JAK and/or STAT activation. Individual SOCS proteins negatively
  regulate signaling by several mechanisms: degradation of receptors or associated
  proteins via the proteasomal pathway; inhibition of JAK tyrosine activity; competition
  for receptor phosphotyrosine residues thereby blocking other signaling molecules;
  prevention of nuclear translocation of key signaling molecules.'
