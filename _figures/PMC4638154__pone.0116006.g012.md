caption: In the absence of MT1-MMP, triple helical type I collagen activates DDR1
  (yellow star). Activated DDR1-triggers a signalling pathway culminating in the transcriptional
  up-regulation of BIK and apoptosis. The exact implication of Src family kinase (SFK)
  members remains unclear (question marks). Catalytically active MT1-MMP can cleave
  type I collagen, preventing its recognition by DDR1. MT1-MMP is also able to shed
  the extracellular domain of DDR1. Both cleavages impair DDR1 activation, thereby
  preventing BIK up-regulation and apoptosis.
