caption: (A) Cholesterol deficiency. When the cholesterol content of ER membranes
  falls below 5 mol% of its total lipids, Scap binds COPII proteins, which incorporate
  the Scap/SREBP complex into COPII-coated vesicles that move to the Golgi. In the
  Golgi, SREBPs are cleaved by two proteases, S1P and S2P, allowing the active portion
  to enter the nucleus where it activates genes that increase cholesterol synthesis
  and uptake.(B) Cholesterol excess. When ER cholesterol rises above 5 mol% of membrane
  lipids, cholesterol binds to Scap, thereby causing Scap to bind to Insig. This releases
  COPII proteins, abrogating transport to the Golgi. The fall in nuclear SREBP reduces
  transcription of genes for cholesterol synthesis and uptake.
