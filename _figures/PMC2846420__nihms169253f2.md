caption: 'Schematic of neuromodulatory receptors in striatum. Excitatory and inhibitory
  projections as depicted in . DARs in red, AChRs in green, and glutamate receptors
  in grey. (*) denotes pathway-dependent receptor expression, i.e. DARs on MSN spine
  shafts are primarily D1Rs on “direct” pathway MSNs and D2Rs on the “indirect” pathway
  MSNs and M1Rs on both “direct” and “indirect” pathway MSNs, but M4Rs on “direct”
  pathway MSNs only. Presynaptic processes depicted without specific postsynaptic
  targets denote incomplete information on these synapses. Omitted for simplicity:
  GABA receptors as well as myriad intracellular signaling cascades and their downstream
  effects on ion channel families and receptor expression/trafficking. (Abbreviations:
  Glu – glutamate; LTS – low-threshold spiking interneuron; NO – nitric oxide). Based
  in part on figures in (; ; ; ; ).'
