caption: 'Proposed model of airway tolerance. In the absence of immunoregulatory pathways,
  epithelial barrier cells readily respond to allergen binding on their pattern recognition
  receptors, among which TLR4, by the secretion of inflammatory mediators (IL-1α,
  IL-25, IL-33, GM-CSF, CCL20, and others). These mediators license antigen-bearing
  IRF4+ CD11b+ conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s) to polarize naïve T cells to T
  helper 2 (Th2) cells in the lung-draining lymph nodes. Neonatal and germ-free mice
  are especially prone to develop such Th2 responses. Respiratory syncytial virus
  (RSV) infection and second hand cigarette smoke, two known asthma risk factors,
  increase IL-33 secretion and may thereby stimulate this pathway. Exposure to endotoxin,
  farm dust or microbial colonization blunts the epithelial response by increasing
  the expression of negative regulators. Epithelial IL-33 release is also inhibited
  by helminth-derived excreted and secreted products (HES). DCs devoid of epithelial
  activation signals do not induce T cell activation (Th0). Other protective factors
  impede T cell activity by influencing the maturation, antigen presentation, or phagocytic
  capacity of DCs. Some protective factors induce DCs that provoke regulatory T cell
  (Treg) activity or T helper 1 (Th1) activity. Regulatory macrophages (rM) can also
  induce Tregs, or block DC-mediated Th2-polarization. Abbreviations: HDM, house dust
  mite; TLR4, Toll like receptor 4; IL-1R, IL-1 receptor; H. pylori, Helicobacter
  pylori; L. lactis, Lactococcus lactis; SCFA, short chain fatty acids; AIP-2, anti-inflammatory
  protein 2.'
