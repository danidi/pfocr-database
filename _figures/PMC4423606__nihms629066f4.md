caption: 'Functional annotation of the identified proteins using enrichment of biological
  pathways and gene ontology (GO) terms in DAVID (Panel A: TOP - antigen presentation
  cluster, BOTTOM - metabolism cluster). Green block indicated that a particular gene
  (columns) that is associated with a given pathway/GO term (rows) was identified
  in the secretome (BT-474 - red, SKBR3 - black, both cell lines - blue). Black regions
  of the grid indicate that GO association for a gene has not been reported. Graphical
  summaries of the MHC class I pathway (Panel B) and the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  pathway (Panel C) obtained from the KEGG Pathway database were annotated with the
  identified proteins (BT-474 secretome - red star, SKBR3 secretome - black star,
  secretomes from both cell lines - blue star).'
