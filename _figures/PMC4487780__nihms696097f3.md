caption: A. NAD+ is an essential coenzyme for sirtuin, PARP and CD38 activity, all
  of which metabolize NAD+ into NAM. Glycolysis and the TCA cycle also consume available
  NAD+ for the production of NADH, providing reducing equivalents for either lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH) or the electron transport chain (ETC). Red font indicates environmental
  or physiological stimuli that activate sirtuins by increasing NAD+ while blue font
  indicates a reduction in NAD+, thereby diminishing sirtuin activity. NAM can be
  shunted away from NAD+ production following methylation by NNMT, a pathway activated
  by a HFD or with long term or high doses of NAM, which can favor the development
  of a fatty liver, due to reductions in available methyl groups. In contrast, NNMT
  depletion by NNMT-antisense oligonucleotides in animals, or mNAM supplementation
  in cells reduces NAM methylation. With a HFD, NAD+ can be reduced by elevating energy
  availability and NADH production, while exercise, fasting and CR reverses this process
  providing more NAD+ for sirtuin activation and protein deacetylation. NR supplementation
  or intraperitoneal NMN increases NAD+ availability via the NAD+ salvage pathway
  in mice. Ultimately, SIRT1 induces mitochondrial biogenesis, energy expenditure,
  antioxidant defenses, and lifespan extension by a mechanism that involves the mitochondrial
  unfolded protein response (UPRmt). PARPs consume NAD+, reducing SIRT1 activity,
  by increasing PARylation of DNA and proteins during aging, cancer, neurodegeneration,
  and mitochondrial diseases. B. SIRT1 negatively regulates PARP1 through the inhibition
  of transcription and possibly through deacetylation. Reciprocally, PARP1 inhibits
  SIRT1 by limiting NAD+ levels, while PARP2 directly inhibits SIRT1 transcription.
  Interestingly, PARP1 is required for the transcriptional co-activation of NF-κB,
  while SIRT1 inhibits NF-κB activity through the deacetylation of RelA/p65. In addition,
  PARP1 and SIRT1 oppositely regulate p53 nuclear accumulation and activation following
  cytotoxic stress. Since the Km of PARP1 for NAD+ is lower than that of SIRT1, as
  NAD+ levels drop following cell stress or senescence SIRT1 becomes less effective
  at regulating PARP1, and inhibiting inflammation or cell death through the inactivation
  of NF-κB and p53. Dashed arrows indicate pathways that need further validation.
