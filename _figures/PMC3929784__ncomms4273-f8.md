caption: Normal B-cell development proceeds from haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) through
  multiple stages to ultimately become mature B cells. A small subset of pro-B cells
  express renin and are termed BRenin-cells. In this model, activation of the renin
  promoter in BRenin-cells results in cre recombinase expression and subsequently
  RBP-J deletion. These cells fail to differentiate along the normal B-cell pathway,
  undergo epigenetic activation and enrichment of a precursor B-cell gene programme.
  Mutant cells additionally experience cell cycle progression and cell proliferation
  ultimately resulting in expansion of a lymphoblast population and the development
  of precursor B cell leukaemia.
