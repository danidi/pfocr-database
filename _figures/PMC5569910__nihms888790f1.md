caption: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling pathway (A) is best known for
  the induction of xenobiotic metabolizing genes via activation by environmental toxicants.
  AHR activation can be inhibited by AHR antagonists such as α-naphthoflavone (NF)
  (B) by decreasing AHR-directed transcription.
