caption: A simplified scheme that illustrates some of the main points of this review.
  Two main pathways link DNA binding, topoisomerase II action and drug-induced tumour
  cell death. In the first, which occurs broadly through most phases of the cell division
  cycle, inhibition of the religation step during strand passing leads to DNA double-strand
  breaks. In the second pathway, inhibition of DNA strand passing during anaphase
  interferes with the proper segregation of chromatids following mitosis. Both processes
  can activate the p53 pathway, leading to cycle arrest mainly in G1 phase for the
  first process and tetraploid G1 phase for the second. Both processes can lead to
  cell death and the activation of immune responses, including the stimulation of
  interferon genes (STING), induction of cytokines, induction of T-cell-mediated responses
  and cytotoxicity.
