caption: The activin signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. Schematics of the activin
  pathway under normal conditions (A), cancer cachexia (B) and treatment with the
  sActRIIB decoy receptor in cancer cachexia (C) are shown. (A) Myostatin and activin,
  activating ligands of the activin pathway, and the inhibitory ligand inhibin are
  able to bind the ActRIIB receptor, causing a balanced activation of the pathway
  so that SMAD2 is phosphorylated, which causes FOXO3A to be activated by dephosphorylation,
  inducing the activation of muscle-atrophy-associated E3 ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1
  and MuRF1 to steady-state levels. The hypertrophy signals mediated by the muscle
  satellite cells and other factors are also at steady state levels, leading to a
  balance between muscle atrophy and hypertrophy under normal conditions. (B) However,
  during cancer cachexia, higher levels of myostatin and activin hyperactivate the
  pathway, resulting in increased levels of phospho-SMAD2 and dephosphorylated FOXO3a,
  causing overinduction of atrogin-1 and MuRF1, resulting in the balance shifting
  towards muscle atrophy. (C) Treatment with sActRIIB during cancer cachexia causes
  myostatin and activin to be sequestered by this decoy receptor, leading to reduced
  availability of these ligands to activate the ActRIIB receptor, which leads to decreased
  activin signaling, thereby preventing muscle atrophy. It is not clear whether inhibin
  binds sActRIIB. An increase in proliferation by the satellite cells in this situation
  shifts the balance towards muscle hypertrophy.
