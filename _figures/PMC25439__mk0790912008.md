caption: Bypass Sec14p mechanisms. The relevant lipid metabolic pathways and proteins
  that determine the activity of these pathways are shown. The key lipids (i.e., PtdIns-4-P,
  PtdCho, and DAG) are indicated in bold. Key proteins and their corresponding sites
  of action are indicated in the black boxes. We propose two principal mechanisms
  for bypass Sec14p. First, we suggest that Kes1p, SacIp, and Bsd1p are involved in
  a PLD regulatory pathway that, in yeast mutants carrying the corresponding bypass
  Sec14p alleles, results in PLD activation and subsequent production of DAG. This
  particular pathway recapitulates the physiological function for the PtdIns-bound
  form of Sec14p (Sec14p∼PI) that we have proposed effects DAG production via regulation
  of inositol phospholipid metabolism (). Loss of SacIp function results in PtdIns-4-P
  accumulation that, in turn, either activates Bsd1p (identified by dominant bypass
  Sec14p alleles; ; ) or inactivates Kes1p (identified by recessive bypass Sec14p
  alleles; ). The consequence is activation of PLD, which results in DAG production
  through the metabolism of the PtdOH generated by PLD-mediated hydrolysis of PtdCho.
  We propose that the excess DAG generated via this route is consumed by the CDP-choline
  pathway for PtdCho biosynthesis, thereby resulting in the observed activation of
  this pathway biosynthetic pathway in sac1 mutants. Second, we suggest that dysfunction
  of any one of the enzymes of the CDP-choline pathway results in the observed recessive
  bypass Sec14p phenotypes (), because inactivation of the CDP-choline pathway recapitulates
  the function of PtdCho-bound Sec14p (Sec14p∼PC) (). Although bypass Sec14p via this
  route also requires PLD activity, there is nonetheless a measurable PLD-independent
  component to suppression of Sec14p defects by CDP-choline pathway defects.
