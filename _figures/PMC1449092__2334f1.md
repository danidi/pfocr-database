caption: 'Pathway model of the Gαo-Gαqsignaling network as inferred from C. elegans
  genetic studies. Solid lines indicate that direct interactions are known or likely,
  while dashed lines and/or large gaps between line endpoints and downstream effectors
  indicate predicted interactions or missing components. Proteins that positively
  regulate neurotransmitter release are shown in green. Reducing green protein function
  results in aldicarb resistance, paralysis or decreased locomotion, decreased egg
  laying, and, in some cases, paralytic larval arrest. Proteins that inhibit neurotransmitter
  release are shown in red blocks. Reducing red protein function results in aldicarb
  hypersensitivity and increased rates of locomotion and egg laying. The bottom green
  dashed lines represent hypothetical components (searched for using the genetic screens
  herein) that could positively regulate the EGL-30 (Gαq) pathway to establish or
  maintain synapse activation. This model is based on the following studies: , , ,
