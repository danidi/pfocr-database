caption: Neuroendocrine pathways regulate stress tolerance in C. elegans []. Schematic
  depiction of the three neuroendocrine pathways that regulate stress responses in
  C. elegans. (a) The IGF/IL signaling pathway. IL ligands bind the IL receptor DAF-2
  to activate a phosphorylation cascade, which then activates the PI3 kinase AGE-1.
  This results in the phosphorylation of the ACG kinases, AKT-1 AKT-2 and SGK-1, which
  ultimately phosphorylate DAF-16 and SKN-1. Phosphorylated DAF-16 and SKN-1 are cytoplasmic
  and inactive. Unphosphorylated DAF-16 and SKN-1 are active and translocate to the
  nucleus to transcribe their target genes. IL signaling also modulates the activity
  of HSF1 in manner yet to be characterized, (b) The TGF-β signaling pathway in C.
  elegans has all the components of the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway. The TGF-β
  ligand DAF-7 binds the type I and type II receptors DAF-1 and DAF-4 to modulate
  the phosphorylation state of the downstream SMAD proteins DAF-8 and DAF-14. DAF-8
  and DAF-14 inhibit the function of a DAF-3, a co-SMAD and DAF-5, a protein homologous
  to the Sno/Ski family of oncogenes. Phosphorylated DAF-8 and DAF-14 translocate
  to the nucleus where they transcribe its target genes involved in the development
  of dauer larvae. (c) The nuclear hormone receptor (NR) signaling pathway. Insulin/IGF-I
  and TGF-β peptide signals converge on the nuclear receptor branch of the dauer pathway.
  NCR-1/2, a Niemann-Pick C1 homolog, delivers cholesterol to DAF-9, presumably triggering
  the synthesis of steroid hormone. In the presence of hormone, DAF-12 directs expression
  of genes involved in reproductive development and the animals are not stress tolerant.
  In unfavorable environments, hormonal pathways are suppressed and unliganded DAF-12
  specifies dauer development and stress resistance.
