caption: Differential involvement of IKKβ/NF-κB signaling in neurons of the hypothalamic
  arcuate nucleus in the pathogenesis of obesity and hypertension. There are two key
  neuronal populations in the arcuate nucleus; the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons
  and the neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons which also express agouti related protein (AgRP).
  IKKβ/NF-κB axis in the orexigenic NPY/AgRP neurons is required for the development
  of diet-induced obesity. On the other hand, IKKβ/NF-κB axis in the POMC neurons
  mediates the obesity-associated hypertension via activation of the sympathetic nervous
  system (SNS). The inset shows the pathway for IKKβ/NF-κB signaling which leads to
  the modulation of gene expression. Under basal conditions, inactive NF-κB resides
  in the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitory protein IKBα. Phosphorylation of IKBα causes
  it to be released from NF-κB, ubiquitinated and degraded in the proteasome. The
  phosphorylation of IKBα is facilitated by the IκB kinase IKKβ, which is itself activated
  via serine phosphorylation in response to activation of cell surface receptors such
  as IL-1β, TNFα, the toll-like receptors, or in response to reactive oxygen species.
  Free of IKB, NF-κB can then translocate to the nucleus where it modulates the transcription
  of its target genes.
