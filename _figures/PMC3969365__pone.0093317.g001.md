caption: '(a) E. coli biosynthesizes GPP and FPP using endogenous farnesyl diphosphate
  (IspA), which provides direct substrates for monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthesis,
  respectively. Using FPP as a starter molecule, S. aureus CrtM and CrtN biosynthesize
  diaponeurosporene, a yellow C30 carotenoid. By expressing GGPP synthase (CrtE from
  P. ananatis or Pantoea agglomerans in this work), a large portion of endogenous
  FPP is converted to GGPP. GGPP can be fed either to diTPSs or to the pathway of
  C40 carotenoid pigment lycopene (by CrtB, and CrtI from P. ananatis or P. agglomerans).
  Geraniol synthase (GES) from sweet basil, 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (TEAS) from
  tobacco, and taxadiene synthase (TXS) from Pacific yew were used to represent monoTPSs,
  sesquiTPSs, and diTPSs, respectively. G. stearothermophilus farnesyl diphosphate
  synthase (FDS) and its specificity-shifted variants (FDSY81A and FDSY81M)  were
  also tested. (b) Left panel: diTPS competes for GGPP with C40 carotenoid enzymes.
  pAC-EBI harbors crtE, crtB and crtI genes from P. ananatis under the control of
  the lac promoter. Right panel: monoTPS or sesquiTPS competes for FPP with C30 carotenoid
  enzymes. pAC-MN harbors crtM and crtN genes from S. aureus under the control of
  the lac promoter.'
