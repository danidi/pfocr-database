caption: After RANKL stimulation, the CD44 expression in osteoclast cells was upregulated.
  CD44 could increase the interaction between RANK and TRAF6, then it would activate
  its downstream signaling molecules, lead the phosphorylation of Src or Akt, which
  phosphorylates IκB-α and promotes the expression of NFATc1. NFATc1 induces the expression
  of genes related to the function and activity of osteoclast.
