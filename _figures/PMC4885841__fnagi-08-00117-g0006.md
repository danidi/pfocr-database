caption: Schematic diagram demonstrating the immunomodulatory and therapeutic effects
  that grafted stem cells exerted on the recipient upon transplantation. The immunomodulatory
  effects, regulated by MSCs and NSCs, are dominated by the delicate balance of IFN-γ
  and executed by the microglial phenotype switch between M1 and M2. An anti-inflammatory
  microenvironment can promote microglial TLR4 expression and IFN-γ secretion in MSCs,
  thus switching to a pro-inflammatory state. Similarly, a pro-inflammatory microenvironment
  can switch to an opposite one via microglial TLR3 expression upregulation and anti-inflammatory
  cytokines secretion. Moreover, MSCs can promote angiogenesis and neurogenesis through
  secretion of VEGF, EGF, and neurotrophic factors. In the context of iPSCs transplantation,
  the innate immunity activation (TLR3 signaling pathway activation) can enhance nuclear
  reprogramming efficiency via facilitation of epigenetic modifiers.
