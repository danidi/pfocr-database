caption: Potential pathways and mechanisms underlying the enhancement of endothelial
  dysfunction in aged mice subjected to sepsis. In aged blood vessels, septic shock
  induces an overwhelming degree of oxidative damage, leading to a marked degree of
  endothelial dysfunction, which, in turn, contributes to the MODS and mortality of
  sepsis. We hypothesize that part of the process involves the fact that in aged endothelial
  cell, oxidative stress is unable to induce an appropriate activation of the Nrf2/ARE
  pathway. Please see  for additional details. ARE, antioxidant response element;
  BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin, a co-factor of eNOS; eNOS, endothelial isoform of NO synthase;
  iCa2+, intracellular calcium concentration; Keap1, Kelch-like erythroid cell-derived
  protein with CNC homology (ECH)-associated protein 1; MODS, multiple organ dysfunction
  syndrome; NO, nitric oxide; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2)-related factor
  2; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.
