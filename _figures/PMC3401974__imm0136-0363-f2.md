caption: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway regulates T-cell activation,
  differentiation and migration. (a) Downstream of T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD28,
  phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) leads to activation of the serine/threonine
  kinase Akt, which subsequently controls mTOR activity. This signalling cascade promotes
  the glucose metabolism and protein synthesis necessary for T-cell activation, proliferation
  and differentiation into CD4+ T helper type 1 (Th1), Th2 and Th17 subsets. The PI3K–Akt–mTOR
  axis also promotes down-regulation of secondary lymphoid organ (SLO) homing receptors
  CD62L, CCR7 and S1P1. Antigen experienced T cells, therefore, home to their respective
  non-lymphoid tissues. (b) Inhibition of mTOR via rapamycin or genetic deletion reduces
  protein synthesis and T-cell proliferation, and promotes differentiation toward
  anergic, CD4+regulatory T (Treg) cell and CD8+ memory cell subsets. Rapamycin-mediated
  inhibition of mTOR causes T effector cells to re-express CD62L and CCR7 and home
  to secondary lymphoid organs.
