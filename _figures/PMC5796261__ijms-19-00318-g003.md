caption: TREM2-DAP12 and CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling in aged microglia. (A) TREM2 expression
  is reduced in aged mice. A progressive decline in TREM2 expression might occur during
  aging in certain areas of the human brain, reducing microglial cell numbers and
  the microglial response to the breakdown of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neurons,
  and myelin. These events would create a fertile ground for neurodegeneration. TREM2
  deficiency hinders the accumulation of microglia during aging. (B) CX3CL1 expression
  levels physiologically decrease in aged rodents which show a reduction of ramified
  microglia and a rise of neuroinflammatory markers. Reduced levels of CX3CL1 and
  CX3CR1 in the aged brain greatly alter the overall functionality of this pathway,
  with morphological and functionally impaired microglia. During aging, reduced neurogenesis
  occurs in the hippocampus. The pharmacological knockout or genetic deletion of CX3CR1
  lead to decreased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus, with
  an IL-1β-dependent decline of both the survival and the proliferation rate of the
  neuronal progenitors. The physiological decline in neuronal CX3CL1 might contribute
  to increased microglia activation.
