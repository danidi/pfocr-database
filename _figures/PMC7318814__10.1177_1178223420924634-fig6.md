caption: Summary of mechanisms of action underlying MEMP HT in BC cells. As depicted,
  MEMP HT inhibits proliferation and migration in MCF-7 cells (A) and MDA-MB-231 BC
  cells (B). Acute (1 hour) or chronic (24 hours) exposure to the MEK1/2 (PD98059)
  or MEK5 (BIX02189) inhibitors in MCF-7 cells decreased pERK1/2 and pERK5 (trends),
  respectively, leading to decreases in NF-κB and increases in Elf-5. In MCF-7 cells,
  MEMP HT alone increased pERK5 in MCF-7 cells, which was blocked in the presence
  of 02189 and PD98059, suggesting that both MEK1/2 and 5 modulate MEMP HT’s actions
  on pERK5. β1-INTEGRIN levels increased only when MEMP HT was combined with PD98059
  suggesting that a co-(up)-regulation of β1-INTEGRIN occurred between MEMP HT and
  MEK1/2. For NF-κB, the BIX02189-mediated up-regulation of NF-κB was blocked in the
  presence of MEMP HT, suggesting that the MEK5 pathway inhibits NF-κB and MEMP HT
  reverses this. For MDA-MB-231 cells, acute (1 hour) exposure to the MEK1/2 (PD98059)
  or MEK5 (02189) inhibitors decreased pERK1/2 and pERK5, respectively; however, chronic
  (24 hours) exposure to PD98059 alone produced a compensatory up-regulation of MEK1/2
  and MEK5 pathways leading to increases in pERK1/2, pERK5, and RUNX2; RUNX2 was blocked
  when MEMP HT was combined with PD98059. Although MEMP HT alone was without effect
  on the proteins examined, when it was combined with PD98059 a compensatory up-regulation
  of pERK1/2 and β1-INTEGRIN occurred and when combined with 02189 a compensatory
  up-regulation of pERK1/2, β1-INTEGRIN, and Elf-5 occurred suggesting cross-modulation
  of these signaling pathways is occurring in MDA-MB-231 cells distinct from that
  of MCF-7 cells. BC indicates breast cancer; MEMP HT, melatonin, estrogen, and progesterone
  hormone therapy.
