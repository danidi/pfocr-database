caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms of PDCD4 induced cell death through suppression
  of p62/Nrf2 signaling in NSCLC cells. In this diagram, PDCD4 activates Keap1 by
  directly binding to PDCD4, leading to p62 and Nrf2 inhibition; Inhibition of p62/Nrf2
  pathway promotes cell death in NSCLC cells.

  pathway and upregulating Keap1 expression.
