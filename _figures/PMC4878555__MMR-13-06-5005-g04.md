caption: Possible mechanisms involved. (A) Expression of V1 is suppressed by siRNA;
  (B) TLR2 increases; (C) TLR2 and a second TLR (not involved in pathogen sensing)
  form a complex on the cell surface, inducing a severe reaction; (D) increased TLR2
  located on the cell surface; (E) activation of the downstream NF-κB pathway; (F)
  increased release of TNF-α results in a more severe reaction. NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α, siRNA. small interfering RNA; ALI, acute lung injury;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharide; V1, versican V1.
