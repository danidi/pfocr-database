caption: Regulation of STAT3 signal transduction pathway. Cytokine binding induces
  receptor oligomerization that facilitate cross-phosphorylation and activation of
  the receptor-associated JAK kinases. Recruitment of STAT3 to activated gp130 receptors
  in response to cytokines result in their activation, dimerization and translocate
  into the nucleus to induce the expression of cytokine responsive genes including
  SOCS3 and to a lesser extent, SOCS1. The SOCS proteins inhibit or terminate JAK/STAT
  signals by binding to the activation loop tyrosine residues of JAKs and/or the tyrosine-phosphorylated
  cytokine receptors and target them for degradation by the proteosome. The STAT3
  signal can also be attenuated by PIAS3, a member of the protein inhibitors of activated
  STATs (PIAS) family of proteins. PIAS3 binds selectively to activated STAT3 dimers
  and blocks their ability to bind DNA and activate transcription.
