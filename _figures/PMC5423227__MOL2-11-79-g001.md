caption: Alterations in DNA methylation patterns as a source of cancer progression
  traits. (A) Loss of DNA methylation expands the HIF2A tumour‐initiating pathway
  output in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to promote metastasis. In the presence of oxygen,
  HIF2A is normally targeted for proteosomal degradation, but in VHL mutant RCC cells
  HIF2A is constitutively expressed and it drives tumorigenesis. DNA demethylation
  in metastatic cells increases the HIF2A pathway target gene spectrum to include
  pro‐metastatic CYTIP expression. (B) Melanocyte lineage factor MITF signalling output
  is expanded through DNA demethylation in support of metastatic progression in melanoma.
  MITF drives differentiation/pigmentation and proliferation/survival in melanocyte
  and melanoma cells. Loss of DNA methylation allows MITF to bind additional gene
  promoters and induce expression of metastasis‐promoting TBC1D16. (C) Metabolic alterations
  can induce global alterations in DNA methylation. In glioblastoma, IDH1/2 mutants
  produce the oncometabolite 2‐hydroxyglutarate (2‐HG) which inhibits the activity
  of TET enzymes. TETs normally mediate demethylation of DNA by converting 5‐methylcytocine
  (5mC) to 5‐hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). Thus, the accumulation of 2‐HG leads to
  increased DNA methylation resulting in the global CpG island hypermethylator phenotype
  (CIMP). This can lead to tumour suppressor silencing or loss of the binding of methylation
  sensitive DNA‐binding factors such as CTCF. CTCF functions as an insulator protein
  that demarcates chromatin domains. In glioblastoma, CIMP‐induced loss of CTCF binding
  can allow aberrant PDFGRA activation. Thus, unspecific large‐scale alterations in
  DNA methylation can result in specific cancer phenotypes. Similar mechanism could
  activate metastasis genes as well.
