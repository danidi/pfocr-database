caption: Schematic diagram of icariin regulation upon PA-induced insulin resistance.
  Proteasome functions as a key role in PA-induced insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes.
  Dysfunction of proteasome facilitates ER stress and promotes an increase of TXNIP
  protein levels. Excessive TXNIP contributes to inflammatory response and hyperactivation
  of STAT3 leading to insulin resistance. In addition, ER stress induces insulin resistance
  through inflammation and JNK/IRS-1 pathway. The precise mechanism that regulates
  proteasome remains unclear; however, the improvement of proteasome activity by icariin
  administration results in degradation of TXNIP protein and attenuation of ER stress,
  both of which contribute to improvement of insulin resistance.
