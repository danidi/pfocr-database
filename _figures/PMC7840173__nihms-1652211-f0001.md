caption: 'The four major pathways of the protein C system are: (1, bottom left) activation
  of protein C and generation of APC, (2, bottom right) the cytoprotective pathway,
  (3, top right) the anticoagulant pathway, and (4, top left) inactivation of APC
  by serine protease inhibitors (SERPINs). (1, bottom left) Activation of protein
  C is mediated by thrombomodulin (TM)-bound thrombin and facilitated by presentation
  of protein C bound to EPCR on the endothelial cell surface. (2, bottom right) After
  activation when APC is bound to EPCR, APC can induce cytoprotective activities via
  the non-canonical activation of PAR1 at Arg46 and of PAR3 at Arg41. Cytoprotective
  activities may include anti-apoptotic activities, anti-inflammatory activities including
  inhibition of NLRP3-mediated inflammasomes and inhibition of neutrophil extracellular
  trap formation, stabilization of endothelial barriers, and alterations of gene expression
  profiles. Not shown here is APC’s ability to inactivate extracellular histones,
  which does not require APC-mediated cell signaling but involves proteolytic degradation
  by APC. Also, not depicted, are other receptors required for some of APC’s cytoprotective
  effects, including Mac-1, S1P receptor 1, Tie2, and others. (3, top right) Dissociation
  of APC from EPCR and binding of APC to negatively charged lipid membranes such as
  on activated platelets permits anticoagulant activity of APC. Proteolytic inactivation
  of the activated clotting factors Va and VIIIa by APC is supported by various cofactors
  such as protein S, factor V, and various lipid cofactors. (4, top left) Inactivation
  of APC by SERPINs limits the activity of APC in plasma and is primarily responsible
  for the half-live of ~16 min of APC in vivo. Abbreviations: PC, protein C; APC,
  activated protein C; IIa, thrombin; TM, thrombomodulin; EPCR, endothelial protein
  C receptor; PAR, protease activated receptor; FVa, activated factor V; FVIIIa, activated
  factor VIII; SERPINs, serine protease inhibitors. This figure is modified from Griffin
