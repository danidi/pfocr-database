caption: 'Both exogenous factors such as irradiation and endogenous factors such as
  stalled replication forks can lead to DSBs in eukaryotic chromosomes. The presence
  of unrepaired DSBs promotes genome instability, and cells have evolved two major
  repair pathways to restore intact DNA strands: the nohomolous end-joining (NHEJ)
  and homologous recombination (HR) pathways (). NHEJ involves the direct religation
  of broken ends, while HR is initiated by 5’ to 3’ DNA resection at ends, utilizing
  information present on an intact donor chromosome or sister chromatid to repair
  DNA (–) Both pathways employ a set of unique proteins to carry out repair, and the
  order of protein recruitment and the action of these factors at DSBs have been defined
  by a combination of biochemical, genetic, molecular, and cytological approaches
  (–). NHEJ can occur throughout the cell cycle, but because strand resection, the
  essential initial step in HR is promoted in S and G2 phases, NHEJ is the predominant
  repair pathway in G1 phase and HR is favored in S and G2 phases (, ).'
