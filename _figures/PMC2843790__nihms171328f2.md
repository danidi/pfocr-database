caption: 'Differentiated cells maintain their transcriptome with stable DNA and histone
  modifications for preserving cell-type-specific gene expression. Major epigenetic
  regulation of gene expression occurs through histone acetylation that enhances target
  gene expression, histone methylation that inhibits target gene expression and DNA
  modifications such as methylation of the promoter region that can prevent transcription
  factor binding. In a simplified model, reprogramming cell fate would require the
  initiation of gene expression specific to the target cell type that would most likely
  be within genomic loci that are silenced in a differentiated unrelated cell. Therefore,
  modifying cellular gene expression patterns would involve the regulation of histone
  deacetylases (HDACs), histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and DNA methyl transferases
  (DNMTs) that can modulate genome-wide DNA and histone modifications. In several
  studies, the reprogramming efficiency and generation of iPS cells could be enhanced
  using small molecules to inhibit these enzymes. In addition, factors inhibiting
  cell proliferation also affect epigenetic plasticity. In dividing cells, the chromatin
  is considered to be in an ‘open’ state and thereby more amenable to chemical modifications
  of histones and DNA. However, certain events can make a cell refractory to gene
  expression changes required for reprogramming to occur. Recent studies have shown
  that a tumor suppressor gene, p53, nicknamed the ‘guardian of the genome’ presents
  a barrier to epigenetic reprogramming. The p53 pathway is physiologically activated
  in conditions of DNA damage to induce cell cycle arrest, leading to global chromatin
  condensation. Suppression of p53 by either siRNA or induction of undifferentiated
  embryonic cell transcription factor 1 (UTF1) can significantly enhance reprogramming
  efficiency. Although the link between p53 activation and the reprogramming pathway
  is unclear, this physiological cellular response appears to ensure iPS cell genomic
  integrity. Chromatin-remodeling proteins such as Chd1 promote reprogramming by ensuring
  an open state of chromatin. Telomerase activity is also crucial for reprogramming:
  senescence associated with telomere attrition is inhibitory towards epigenetic reprogramming.'
