caption: Global and specific regulation of translation initiation. (a) Overview of
  the major steps (numbered) in the cap‐dependent translation initiation pathway in
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae. (b) Global mechanisms for translational repression in
  response to different stresses. Mechanisms that interfere with the initiation pathway
  are shown in red. (c) Overview of mechanisms that promote translational upregulation
  or maintenance of specific mRNAs contrary to global stress‐induced repression (shown
  in green). Note that the elements and mechanisms shown may also combine to influence
  translation negatively, depending on their context [Colour figure can be viewed
