caption: 'A schematic of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor interactions. A. Soluble gp130, an
  antagonist of IL-6 activity. Serum IL-6 binds with sIL-6Rα. This complex in turn
  binds to sgp130. Soluble gp130 thereby competitively antagonizes the binding of
  the IL-6-sIL-6Rα complex to membrane-bound gp130, and thereby inhibits IL-6 effects
  on this cell. B. Membrane-bound gp130 and membrane-bound IL-6Rα. Membrane-bound
  IL-6Rα is restricted in location and is found in only select cell types, whereas
  gp130 is ubiquitous. In this case, serum IL-6 complexes with membrane-bound IL-6Rα
  and then associates with membrane-bound gp130, to generate a signaling-capable hexameric
  complex. As classically described, signaling is mediated proximally by the Jak kinases
  and STAT proteins. Phosphorylation of STAT proteins by the Jak kinases and their
  subsequent translocation to the nucleus induces gene transcription. The Jak kinases,
  with the help of tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2, also activate a series of additional
  kinases (Ras, Raf, Mek, and ERK), which in turn eventually phosphorylate a transcription
  factor (TF) and thereby induce gene transcription. A third pathway, not illustrated
  involves PI3K (see text for details). C. Soluble IL-6Rα, an agonist for IL-6 activities.
  Soluble IL-6Rα binds to serum IL-6. This complex then engages membrane-bound gp130,
  which is found on most cells, to transduce signal in those cells that lack membrane-bound
  IL-6Rα. This phenomenon, termed “trans-signaling,” allows IL-6 to target multiple
  cell types. Adapted from Arthritis Res. 2002; 4(suppl 3): S233-S242,Biochem J. 2003;
  374(pt 1):1–20,Crit Care Med. 2005; 33(8):1839–1844, and Acta Biochim Pol. 2003;
  50(3):603–611.72 IL indicates interleukin; gp, glycoprotein; sIL-6Rα, soluble IL-6Rα
  STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.'
