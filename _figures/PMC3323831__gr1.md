caption: TLR signalling. There are two types of TLRs, those located at the plasma
  membrane that sense microbial membrane components and the intracellular ones that
  sense microbial nucleic acids. TLR4 can signal both at the plasma membrane and at
  endosomes, where it can be activated by viral envelope glycoproteins. All TLRs signal
  via the adaptor MyD88, except TLR3 that can function only via TRIF. MyD88 leads
  to the activation of kinases such as IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs). The
  resulting phosphorylation cascade activates members of TNF receptor associated factor
  6 (TRAF6) and, ultimately, transcription factors NF-κB, JNK and p38 (as well as
  IRF7 for TLR7 and TLR9). The TRIF pathway stimulates TRAF6, Fas-associated protein
  with death domain (FADD) and the transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, NF-κB. TLR4 is
  the only receptor that can engage both MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways.
  It requires bridging adaptors TRAM and Mal to recruit MyD88 and TRIF, respectively.
  TLR2 depends only partially on Mal. Membrane signalling triggers an inflammatory
  response whereas intracellular TLR signalling leads to antiviral and adjuvant responses.
