caption: Functional crosstalk between CD36 and CD47 signaling. In vascular cells ligation
  of CD36 by amyloid-β or a peptide derived from the type 1 repeats of TSP1 inhibits
  uptake of free fatty acids via CD36, which regulates eNOS, and inhibits downstream
  NO/cGMP signaling. The latter pathway requires CD47, but the mechanism remains unclear.
  One possibility is the lateral association of CD36 with an integrin that also associates
  with CD47.
