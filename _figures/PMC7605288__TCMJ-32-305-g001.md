caption: Caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 plays different roles in embryo,
  intestinal epithelium and colorectal cancers. (a) In blastocyst, caudal-related
  homeobox transcription factor 2 determines the gut development by downregulation
  of Oct 4 and Nanog. In the intestinal epithelial cell, caudal-related homeobox transcription
  factor 2 could both promote and inhibit proliferation to maintain the renewal of
  the intestinal epithelium. (b) In the colorectal cancer cells, caudal-related homeobox
  transcription factor 2 downregulates the Wnt pathway and prevents G1-S cell cycle
  transition. Overexpression of caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 decreases
  the epithelial mesenchymal transition. Caudal-related homeobox transcription factor
  2 protein binds to ATM and prevents DNA double strand break repair in colorectal
  cancer cells
