caption: Proposed mechanisms for NF-κB activation. In basal conditions NF-κB is sequestered
  in the cytoplasm by IκBα. Upon stimulation, IκBα is rapidly phosphorylated at Ser32
  and 36 by the IKK complex and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (classical pathway);
  DNA damage induces CK2 activation that leads to phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser293
  and proteasome degradation (atypical pathway); oxidative stress induces Syk protein
  tyrosine kinase activation leading to IkBα Tyr42 phosphorylation and proteasome
  degradation (Oxidative stress-induced pathway). The released NF-κB dimer translocates
  to the nucleus and activates target genes by binding with high affinity to κB elements.
  External stimuli induce NIK and IKKα-dependent proteasomal processing of p100 into
  p52, which translocates to the nucleus and binds to DNA in association with RelB
  (alternative pathway).
