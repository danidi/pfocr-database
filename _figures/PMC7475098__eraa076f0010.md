caption: Proposed working model linking ABA signaling in rice roots to the response
  to high-NH4+ stress. Under HA stress, OsSAPK9–OsbZIP20 mediated ABA signaling via
  three routes to relieve HA inhibition of root growth. First, ABA strengthens NH4+
  assimilation by increasing GS, GOGAT, and GDH enzyme activities, reducing free NH4+
  accumulation in roots. Secondly, ABA fortifies the antioxidant apparatus by increasing
  the enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, and APX, reducing ROS levels and oxidative stress
  damage. Thirdly, the transcription factor OsbZIP20 up-regulates LEAs to facilitate
  adaptation to HA stress.
