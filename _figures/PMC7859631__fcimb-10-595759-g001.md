caption: The gut-brain axis in HE. The homeostasis of intestinal microbiota is affected
  in severe hepatic disease and portal shunt disease. Gut-origin substances are delivered
  to the brain through the immune, humoral and vagus nerve pathway (; ). Chronic intestinal
  inflammation and “leaky gut” promote gut microbiota metabolite and bacterial translocation
  into the circulatory system leading to systemic inflammation and body metabolic
  disorders (). The brain microenvironment loses stability, followed by BBB dysfunction.
  Moreover, multiple factors disturb the CNS function, including changes in brain
  structure, neurotransmitters, and other substance concentrations, leading to cognitive
  impairments in HE (; ; ; ; ).
