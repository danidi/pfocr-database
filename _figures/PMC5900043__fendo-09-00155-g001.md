number: Figure 1
caption: Glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) and schematic cartoon of the insulin
  signaling pathway in podocytes. (A) Schematic structure of GFB. (B) Electron microscopic
  image of the GFB in mouse. (C) Insulin activates the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase,
  which recruits and phosphorylates different substrate adaptors, such as the IRS
  family proteins. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 binds PI3K. The catalytic subunit
  of PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) leading to
  the formation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3). PI3K is also
  linked to the activation of the protein kinase Akt (protein kinase B), and further
  downstream to the translocation of GCVs to the plasma membrane. Also, activation
  of PKG-I leads to enhanced phosphorylation of AKT and increases glucose uptake.
  E, endothelial cell; FP, foot process; GBM, glomerular basement membrane; GCV, GLUT4-containing
  vesicle; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; P, phosphorylation; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; PKG-I, cGMP-dependent protein kinase G type I.
