caption: On one hand, Up-regulation of TERT upon the EtOH treatment can induce the
  expression of M1 macrophage markers including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, NOS2, and CCL2
  by interacting with p65, which suggests TERT promotes macrophage polarize towards
  M1 phenotype via NF-κB signaling. On the other hand, as a stimulus of NF-κB signaling,
  LPS, can bind LPS-binding protein and then deliver the LPS ligand to CD14 receptor.
  The LPS-CD14 complex interplays with TLR4 in conjunction with the small extracellular
  protein MD2 to activate intracellular signaling via NF-κB pathway. Upon activation
  of TLR4, signaling intermediates IRAK1/4 are recruited to the TLR4 complex via interplay
  with MyD88 leading to IKK kinase activation.TLR4-induced MyD88- independent (TRIF)
  signalling results in activation of IKKε and NF-κB as well. Afterwards, NF-κB forms
  p65/p50 heterodimers in macrophages and binds to the promoter region of TERT and
  various pro-inflammatory genes to result in gene transcription. In short, this crosstalk
  mechanism may provide a possible explanation for the ethanol-mediated hepatic proinflammatory
  response and M1 macrophage polarization in vitro.
