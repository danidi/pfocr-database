caption: 'Schematic representation of mechanism of miR21 in PC development. miRNA-21
  has previously been shown to target the expression of PTEN and PDCD4. Through inhibition
  of PTEN via miRNA-21, cell survival pathways are activated. With Akt pathway functionality
  heightened, the inhibition of BAD increases, which is a pro-apoptotic pathway, thus
  leading to a reduction in apoptosis. PTEN also inhibits angiogenesis within the
  VEGF pathway, thus miRNA-21 can enhance the establishment of new vasculature. Source:
