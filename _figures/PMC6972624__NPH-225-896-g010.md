caption: Proposed model. In mock rice plants (Oryza sativa), OsCSN5A removes the RUB1
  from OsCUL1, regulating the activity of the SCF complex, leading to the ubiquitination
  and 26S proteasome degradation of OsJAZs, releasing the specific OsMYCs. Genes of
  the JA signaling pathway are then adequately regulated by corresponding MYC transcription
  factors, promoting normal rice growth. Under RBSDV infection condition, P5‐1 binds
  to OsCSN5A, compromising the activity of OsCSN5A over OsCUL1, and blocking OsJAZ
  degradation via ubiquitination and the 26S proteasome. The stabilized OsJAZs bind
  to corresponding MYCs, inhibiting down‐stream gene expression in the JA response
  signaling pathway and promoting RBSDV infection.
