caption: Stages of autophagy. When nutrients and growth factors are abundant, mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) associates with and inhibits (T bar, solid
  line) the ULK1/2-mAtg13-mAtg101-FIP200 complex (ULK complex) by phosphorylation
  of unc-51-like kinase 1/2 (ULK1/2) and mAtg13. Under starvation and other stress
  conditions, mTORC1 dissociates (T bar, dotted line) from ULK1/2 leading to its dephosphorylation
  and allowing it to subsequently phosphorylate focal adhesion kinase family-interacting
  protein of 200 kDa (FIP200) and mAtg13 triggering (red arrow) the initiation of
  autophagy. Following initiation, the activated ULK complex participates in the recruitment
  of additional proteins like Beclin-1, human vacuolar protein sorting-associated
  protein 34 (hVps34), Atg14-like protein (Atg14L) and p150 that constitute the PI3K
  complex, which is involved in the nucleation (red arrow) and assembly of an initial
  double membrane structure, called phagophore, at the site of the autophagic activity.
  Elongation of the nascent phagophore membrane to form autophagosome is mediated
  by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. In the first system, mAtg12 is covalently
  bound to mAtg5 assisted by the mAtg7 and mAtg10 enzymes. Subsequently, Atg16L1 associates
  with the mAtg12-mAtg5 conjugate forming a mAtg12-mAtg5-Atg16L1 complex. The latter
  promotes (blue arrow) the function of the second system which involves LC3. The
  initial form of LC3 (pro-LC3) is cleaved by the protease mAtg4 to produce the active
  cytosolic form LC3-I. LC3-I is then activated by mAtg7 and covalently conjugated
  to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) by mAtg3 to form LC3-II, which then associates
  with the elongated autophagophore and resides in its inner and outer membrane. As
  autophagosome maturation proceeds p62 identifies and delivers ubiquitinated, misfolded
  and aggregated proteins or damaged organelles into the autophagosome via its ubiquitin-associated
  and LC3-binding domains. The mature, closed autophagosome is then fused with lysosomes
  to form autolysosome. The engulfed cargo into autolysosome, along with p62 and LC3-II,
  is exposed to the lysosomal hydrolases that degrade it and then degradation products
  are transferred into the cytosol for further recycling via anabolic procedures.
  In addition to their cytoplasmic presence, Beclin-1, LC3B and p62 autophagy markers
  are found in the nucleus through nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (double red arrows),
  carrying out autophagy and non-autophagy related functions.
