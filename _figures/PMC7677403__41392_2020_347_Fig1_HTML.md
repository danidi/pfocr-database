caption: RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) mediated signal transduction pathway. RIG-I-like
  receptors (RLRs) have been identified as important cytoplasmic RNA sensors, including
  RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. RLRs are common in sharing the DExD/H-box helicase domain
  and C-terminal domain (CTD), and RIG-I and MDA5 contain two N-terminal tandem caspase
  activation and recruitment domains (CARD), while LGP2 lacks CARD. RIG-I detects
  cytoplasmic viral short dsRNA that contains a 5′-triphosphate or 5′-diphosphate
  moiety, whereas MDA5 recognized long dsRNA structures. LGP2 can bind RNA ligands
  of RIG-I, interfering with IKK recruitment to MAVS through protein interaction or
  binding to RIG-I through a repressor domain directly, to inhibit the activation
  of RIG-I. LGP2 can increase the ability of MDA5 to form stable filaments on dsRNA
  to promote the MDA5- mediated pathway. LGP2 interacts with TRAF and disrupt its
  activity, which results in the disruption of IRFs and NFκB activation. Activated
  RIG-I and MDA5 induce the recruitment and polymerization of the adapter MAVS on
  the mitochondrial membrane. Then MAVS activates TBK1 as well as the IKK complex,
  which activates IRF3 and IRF7, and NF-κB. And the gene expression of IFNs, pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines is induced to defend viral and modulate the immunity
