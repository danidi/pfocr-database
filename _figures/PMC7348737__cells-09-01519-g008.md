caption: 'Summary of potential outcomes of ubiquitin recycling. “Traditional Ub cycle”:
  ubiquitin is attached to a substrate protein either as a monomer (not shown) or
  as a polymer. Poly-ubiquitin can be removed as a single unit by DUBs, dismantled
  into mono-ubiquitin, and then reused. “Additional outcomes”: based on our studies
  in Drosophila from earlier investigations and from this work, unanchored poly-ubiquitin
  can be reused as a single unit and become attached onto another protein [], or can
  be degraded ([] and this work). If handled as described thus far, unanchored chains
  are not detrimental (No Toxicity). However, if the ability of cells to reuse or
  to ubiquitinate free poly-ubiquitin as described here is hampered, unanchored chain
  toxicity results from cellular pathway perturbation, as with NF-kB processes evidenced
  here (Toxicity). Based on our data, this toxicity is reversed by an isoleucine 44
  to alanine mutation that disrupts a critical interaction site on ubiquitin.'
