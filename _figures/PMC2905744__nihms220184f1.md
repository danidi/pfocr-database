caption: Notch1 is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by proteolytic cleavage
  following ligand binding. The Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) translocates into
  the nucleus where it forms a complex with CBF1 and other proteins to activate gene
  transcription.

papertitle: Novel targets for the treatment and palliation of gastrointestinal neuroendocrine
  tumors.
