caption: Local innate immune activation or tissue stress can initiate a cytokine milieu
  capable of stimulating nearby memory T cells in the absence of TCR ligation. The
  synergy of IL-15 and TL1a in the presence of IL-12, IL-18 can increase expression
  of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines from memory T cells. Such innate stimulation
  of CD4 and CD8 T cells has been observed in bacterial infection models in which
  IL-18R signaling contributes to the production of IFN-γ and host protection against
  pathogenic bacteria (Right). This non-cognate pathway might be particularly for
  the host if a pathogen evades antigen presentation or if a co-infection is present.
  However, innate stimulation of memory T cells in mucosal tissues might also induce
  or perpetuate harmful inflammatory responses (Left).
