caption: Man-P-Dol acts as mannosyl donor for the synthesis of M9-DLO, GPI anchors,
  and C- and O-mannosylated proteins. Man-P-Dol is synthesized on the cytosolic monolayer
  of the ER membrane from GDP-Man and Dol-P and flips (Flippase 2) to the lumenal
  monolayer where it functions as mannosyl donor for four mannosyltransferases in
  the DLO pathway and three mannosyltransferases in GPI anchor assembly. At least
  seven O-mannosyltransferases have been characterized in yeasts and mammals. The
  number of C-mannosyltransferases remains unknown. Following mannosyl transfer, Dol-P
  is released and returned to the cytosolic monolayer by Flippase 4.
