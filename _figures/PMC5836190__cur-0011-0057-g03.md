caption: Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the canonical pathway. The second
  step of the canonical pathway is activation. DAMPs and PAMPs trigger this step and
  lead to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Proposed cellular events involved
  include ROS, Ca2+signaling, and, most likely, K+ efflux. Regardless, NLRP3 inflammasome
  assembly is initiated and the catalytic domain of the never in mitosis gene a-related
  kinase 7 interacts with the LRR domain of NLRP3 causing oligomerization through
  binding of NACHT domains (the figure depicts only a dimer for simplicity). This
  leads to NLRP3 binding to ASC and ASC in turn binding to pro-caspase-1. Pro-caspase-1
  molecules in close proximity lead autocatalytic cleavage of pro-caspase-1 to caspase-1
  (induced proximity). Activated caspase-1 then cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into
  their active forms (IL-1β and IL-18). Caspase-1 also cleaves gasdermin D whose N-terminus
  is responsible for forming a pore that results in pyroptosis and the release of
  IL-1β and IL-18.
