caption: Altered fluxes in the PIM and LM/LAM biosynthetic pathways in the lpqW mutant
  and derived bypass mutants. The major accumulating PIM and LAM species in wild-type
  and mutant strains are underlined. (A) Proposed role of LpqW and PimE in the wild
  type. PimE converts AcPIM4 into AcPIM5 on the extracytoplasmic face of the cytoplasmic
  membrane. LpqW, on the other hand, is involved in channeling AcPIM4 into the LM/LAM
  biosynthetic pathway (see Discussion). (B) Mutants of lpqW lose the ability to produce
  normal quantities of LAM (top panel). This is overcome through evolution in complex
  media, resulting from the selection of spontaneous pimE mutants. These mutants accumulate
  AcPIM4, rebalancing the biosynthetic pathway to restore LAM production. The pimE
  mutants either show partial PimE activity, where AcPIM5 production is reduced and
  AcPIM4 accumulates, or a complete loss of PimE function, where AcPIM5 synthesis
  is absent.
