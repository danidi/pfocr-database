caption: Schematic illustration of the inflammatory myocardial contractile depressant
  model, with the general pathway illustrated on the left and specifics of these pathways
  on the right Although the pathway is illustrated as a linear system to aid in clarity,
  the in vivo responses are more complex with many of the effector factors, such as
  TNF, IL-1 or nitric oxide, being able to serve as inducing factors as well. In this
  way certain inflammatory products can initiate a positive feed-back loop and thereby
  amplify the inflammatory response.
