caption: (A) In healthy aging, IRs are present at synapses, and proper insulin signaling
  favors synapse function and leads to memory formation. (B) In early AD, accumulation
  of AβOs stimulates TNF-α signaling, which activates the JNK pathway (, ) and, possibly,
  PKR and IKK pathways. Activation of these stress-sensitive kinases, which can also
  be triggered by ER stress in peripheral tissues (), results in IRS-1pSer, decreasing
  downstream insulin signaling (, , ). This contributes to initial cognitive impairment
  in early AD. (C) At later AD stages, increased accumulation of AβOs and their binding
  to synapses lead to removal of IRs from the neuronal plasma membrane (, , ). Additionally,
  TNF-α/JNK activation ultimately blocks insulin actions (), contributing to severe
  impairment in cognition and memory. (D) Stimulation of insulin and GLP-1Rs blocks
  early AβO-induced defects in insulin signaling. Insulin protects neurons by preventing
  AβO binding to neurons (). In addition, activation of GLP-1Rs by exendin-4 or liraglutide
  and of IRs by insulin prevents JNK activation, allowing physiological tyrosine phosphorylation
  of IRS-1 and stimulating downstream insulin signaling. (E) At later AD stages, activation
  of GLP-1Rs prevents inhibitory IRS-1pSer, stimulating insulin-related downstream
  signaling pathways and ameliorating cognitive and memory impairment. Red arrows
  indicate inhibitory pathways and green arrows indicate stimulatory pathways of insulin
  signaling.
