caption: Proliferation vs. meiotic entry decision in the C. elegans germline. (A)
  A simplified genetic pathway showing the proteins involved in regulating the proliferation
  vs. meiotic entry decision. LAG-2, which is expressed on the somatic DTC at the
  distal end of the gonad, interacts with the GLP-1/Notch receptor that is expressed
  on the germ cells. This is thought to cause the intracellular portion of GLP-1,
  ICD, to translocate to the nucleus and interact with the LAG-1 transcription factor,
  turning on genes necessary for proliferation. GLP-1/Notch signaling inhibits the
  activities of two redundant pathways (GLD-1 and GLD-2 pathways), through the activity
  of two PUF proteins, FBF-1 and FBF-2. The GLD-1 and GLD-2 pathways promote meiotic
  entry and/or inhibit the proliferative fate. (B) Gene model of puf-8 illustrating
  the positions of the exons (boxes) and introns (connecting lines), as well as the
  5′ and 3′ UTRs (black boxes) and the region encoding the eight PUF domain repeats
  (gray box). Also shown is the location of the puf-8(oz192) lesion, which results
  in a premature stop codon in the second PUF repeat, and the deletion associated
  with the puf-8(q725) allele.
