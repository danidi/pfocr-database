caption: The mevalonate (MVA) pathway and those steps engineered in the current study
  for novel sesquiterpene production in yeast. The MVA pathway is localized to the
  cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells and supports the biosynthesis of numerous terpene
  macromolecules. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ergosterol is the dominant terpene
  derived from FPP, a highly regulated 15-carbon intermediate in the MVA pathway ().
  Various combinations of mutations in genes coding for a phosphatase (DPP1) and squalene
  synthase (ERG9), along with selection for aerobic uptake of exogenous ergosterol
  (sue) and engineering of a soluble, unregulated form of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  CoA reductase (HMGR) should yield yeast strains capable of accumulating excess levels
  of FPP. The potential to divert the excess FPP to novel sesquiterpene hydrocarbon
  biosynthesis was assessed by introducing key branch point enzymes (terpene synthases),
  and the potential to further modify these hydrocarbon skeletons was determined by
  co-transformation with a gene encoding for a cytochrome P450 hydroxylating enzyme
  (terpene hydroxylase).
