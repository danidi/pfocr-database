caption: Nutritional lipids lead to increased synthesis of TG-rich particles and export
  by the gut. At the level of the brain, the tripartite synapse composed of neurons
  and astrocytes will detect changes in nutrient availability. Free fatty acids (FFA)
  enter astrocytes or neurons through lipid receptors/transporters or via lipoprotein
  lipase (LPL) mediated breakdown of lipoprotein. Once in the cell FFA can enter the
  TCA-cycle but can also directly activate lipid-activated nuclear receptors (NR)
  including proliferated activated receptors delta (PPARδ) or the nuclear enhancer
  of kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κΒ) signaling pathways, or
  through indirect pathways involving Toll-like receptor activation, inflammatory
  processes, ER-stress, or prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. In turn, activated NR and
  NF-κB exert a direct regulation at the transcriptional level on dopamine D2 receptor
  (D2R). At the level of the astrocyte, NF-κB activation leads to increased cytokine
  production which promotes the release of the neural-growth factor (NGF). NGF released
  by astrocyte directly regulates neural D2R abundance. The astrocyte-specific Ankyrin
  repeat and kinase domain containing 1 (ANKK1) directly interacts with NF-κB and
  MAP kinases. In that regard, mutation of ANKK1 (TaqIA A1) would directly impact
  most FFA-induced cellular responses. At the level of DA neuron signaling, early
  D2R response and late β-arrestin mediated responses could both be affected by a
  FFA/ANKK1 initiated pathway.
