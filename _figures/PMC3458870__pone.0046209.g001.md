caption: The stippled arrow illustrates the polymerization of autoxidated homogentisate
  to make pyomelanin. PAH, phenylalanine hydroxylase; AT, amino acid transferase;
  HPPD/Lly, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase/legiolysin; HmgA, homogentisate-1,2-dioxygenase;
  HmgC, maleylacetoacetate isomerase; HmgB, fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase. The two
  L. pneumophila mutants used in this work are marked by asterisks and their gene
  names are shown (in italics).
