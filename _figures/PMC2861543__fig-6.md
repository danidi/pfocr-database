caption: Differential role for endocytosis in receptor-dependent Nox1 generation of
  ROS and activation of cellular signalling. In vascular SMC, TNF-α induces a Nox1-dependent,
  dynamin-dependent, endosomal generation of ROS with subsequent activation of PI3K-Akt-ATF-1
  pathway. In contrast, thrombin activates Nox1 to transactivate the EGFR via metalloproteinase
  (MP)-mediated shedding of EGF-like ligands, with subsequent amplification of dynamin-independent
  ROS generation. Activation of PI3K-Akt-ATF-1 by thrombin is inhibited by dn-dynamin,
  consistent with its dependence on internalization of the activated EGFR. Internalization
  of receptor complexes is important in the temporal regulation of signaling.
