caption: 'Calcium stimulates intracellular signaling (inside–out signaling) through
  its binding to CaR. In one pathway, CaR activates the G protein Gαq, leading to
  PLC activation and generation of IP3 with the release of calcium from intracellular
  stores. This is the predominant mechanism for the initial spike in Ca2+i concentration
  following the calcium switch. CaR also activates Rho that, in turn, activates the
  src kinases Src and Fyn to tyrosine phosphorylate the catenins, enabling their binding
  to the E-cadherin–catenin complex. As noted in the legend of , this results in PLC-γ1
  activation, leading to a sustained increase in Ca2+ i concentration both by release
  of calcium from intracellular stores and by stimulating the influx of calcium through
  store-operated channels. The latter role may be played by PLC-γ1 as part of the
  complex in Golgi with the Golgi calcium pump SPCA1, CaR and the IP3 receptor.Ca2+i:
  Intracellular calcium; CaR: Calcium receptor; IP3: Inositol trisphosphate; IP3R:
  Inositol trisphosphate receptor; PLC: Phospholipase C; SOC: Store-operated channel.'
