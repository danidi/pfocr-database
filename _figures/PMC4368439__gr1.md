caption: The tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. Tryptophan is synthesised from chorismate
  and kynurenine via anthranilate. The chorismate to anthranilate step is mediated
  by trpE/G (genes are present in Escherichia coli but not present in Chlamydia spp.)
  whereas the kynurenine to anthranilate step is mediated by host kynurinase. Chlamydia
  pecorum and Chlamydia caviae encode an almost complete tryptophan biosynthesis operon
  that includes the tryptophan repressor (trpRDCFBA) and is switched on when intracellular
  tryptophan levels decrease. Chlamydia abortus and Chlamydia muridarum lack all of
  these genes, Chlamydia trachomatis encodes only trpRBA. Tryptophan is degraded by
  the host enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which can be induced by interferon-γ
  or constitutively expressed, most notably by foetal trophoblasts in the placenta.
