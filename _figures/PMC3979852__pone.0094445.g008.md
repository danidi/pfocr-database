caption: LPS triggers TLR4 signaling and induces NF-κB and MAPK activation, possibly
  together with CCR8 activation, which results in the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and
  IL-10. CCR8 is required for full activation of both signaling pathways. Production
  of IL-6 and TNF-α involves both the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. IL-10 production is
  largely dependent on the JNK pathway and is mediated by CCR8 activation. In addition
  to the antagonistic effect on CCR8, possible sites of action of R243 are indicated.
