caption: Significant signaling pathway networks in each group. Network constructed
  in (A) Vehicle; (B) CM; (C) UA; (D) JA; (E) JU. Red and green nodes represent the
  differentially expressed genes identified in these networks. A red node denotes
  an up-regulated gene, and a green node denotes a down-regulated gene. The intensity
  of colors indicates the degree of up- or down-regulation. Genes in uncolored notes
  were not identified as differentially expressed in our experiment and were integrated
  into the computationally generated networks based on the evidence stored in the
  IPA knowledge memory, indicating relevance to this network.
