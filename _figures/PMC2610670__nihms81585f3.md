caption: Notch signaling pathway. Notch ligands such as Jagged 1/2 bind to the extracellular
  domain of Notch receptors. Cleavage of the Notch receptors by α-secretase and γ-secretase
  releases the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates into the nucleus, resulting
  in transcription activation. γ-Secretase has been validated as a therapeutic target
  (see ).
