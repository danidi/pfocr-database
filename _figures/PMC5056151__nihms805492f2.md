caption: Transport proteins in Alzheimer’s disease. Down-regulation of ABCB1, ABCG2
  and LRP1 reduce Aβ clearance across the BBB and cause Aβ accumulation in brain parenchyma.
  Reduced activity of ABCA1 in astrocytes and neurons decreases Aβ clearance via the
  ApoE clearance pathway, while ABCA7 deficiency accelerates Aβ production, which
  trigger formation of Aβ oligomers and amyloid plaques. Reduced glutamate uptake
  by astrocytes through glutamate transporters (EAAT) increases glutamate concentration
  in synaptic cleft. Increased expression of RAGE increases Aβ entering the brain.
  Glucose transporters (GLUT) are also reduced which reduce glucose cellular uptake.
