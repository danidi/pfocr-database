caption: The “central” RP–Bmp pathway in dorsal telencephalic patterning and MIH HPE.
  A, Normal development. Zic2 induces the RP, which produces Bmps that generate a
  Bmp activity gradient in the dorsal telencephalon. This activity gradient then directs
  dorsal midline induction (tCPe and cortical hem in orange and brown, respectively)
  and dorsal cortical patterning. LHX5 also acts upstream of the RP, and the RP exerts
  negative feedback that restricts Zic2 and Lhx5 expression to the midline. B, Pathways
  to MIH HPE. Two independent pathways give rise to RP deficits that ultimately lead
  to MIH HPE. In the first pathway, the RP deficit results from failed induction as
  a result of reduced Zic2 function. In the second (Zic2-independent) pathway, RP
  dysfunction arises from excessive RP cell death, which leads to reduced Bmp signaling
  in the dorsal telencephalon. In addition to ZIC2 mutations, candidate inducers of
  MIH HPE include LHX5 mutations, factors that exacerbate RP cell death (including
  increased Bmp signaling) and mutations that decrease Bmp signaling. For additional
  details, see Discussion.
