caption: Hypothetical model of the differentiation hierarchy within the mammary epithelium
  and potential relationships with breast cancer subtypes. NF-κB activation through
  the canonical or the non-canonical pathway is depicted as p50/p65 or p52/RelB heterodimers,
  respectively. Cell surface markers used for the isolation of human epithelial cell
  subsets are shown in blue. Adapted from [,]. ER, oestrogen receptor; PR, progesterone
  receptor.
