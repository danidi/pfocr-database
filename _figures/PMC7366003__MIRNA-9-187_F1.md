caption: Relationship between modulation of GSH homeostasis and cancer metabolic reprogramming.
  The metabolic reprogramming, an event that characterizes cancer cells, leads to
  an increase in both glycolysis and glutaminolysis. This adaptation is due to the
  ability of cancer cells to facilitate the glucose uptake by increasing the expression
  of glucose transporters 1 (GLUT1) and increasing glutamate intracellular levels
  by stimulation of the glutaminase (GLS) activity. However, intracellular glucose
  is metabolized by glycolysis, but also via the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) which,
  leading to the formation of NADPH, contributes to maintaining GSH in its reduced
  form. On the other hand, GSH levels are also due to the action of glutaminase, the
  enzyme that catalyzes glutamine deamination contributing to the formation of glutamate
  that can be used either in the Tricarboxylic Acid cycle (TCA) to produce ATP and
  in GSH biosynthesis. In this network, Myc, which has a central role by directly
  increasing the gene transcription of GLUT1 and glutaminase, is also able to modulate
  these genes by regulating the expression of specific miRNAs. (A higher resolution
  / colour version of this figure is available in the electronic copy of the article).
