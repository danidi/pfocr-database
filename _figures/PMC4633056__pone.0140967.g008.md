caption: The repeated association between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned
  stimulus (US) leads to a conditioned response (CR), in which the CS alone (the placebo)
  is capable of inducing the same unconditioned response (UR) of the US. In the case
  of oxygen treatment, the CS (the ritual of the oxygen mask) induces a CR characterized
  by a decrease in Vmin and pH. In the case of aspirin treatment, the CS (the ritual
  of the pill) induces a CR characterized by a decrease in prostaglandins (PG) and
  thromboxane (TX). The present study suggests that PGE2 might be the final common
  pathway of the analgesic effect. In fact, both placebos decrease PGE2.
