caption: The great versatility of integrin receptors relies on their ability to form
  signaling complexes with many distinct signaling effectors. Possibly most important
  among these is the coordinate signaling between integrins and growth factor receptors.
  These signaling complexes are identified by co-immunoprecipitation of their component
  molecules. Modeled in this diagram is the α6 integrin signaling pathway activated
  as lens cells initiate their differentiation in the equatorial zone. This pathway
  involves transactivation of IGF-1R and ERK by α6 integrin. The activation of the
  IGF-1R leads to an ERK-dependent induction of Bcl-2 and IAP3.
