caption: 'TGF-β1 pathway activation is reduced following RYGB. (A) The upstream regulator
  function of Ingenuity pathway analysis software was used to predict master transcriptional
  regulators underpinning disease-associated shifts in the renal cortical transcriptome
  in SHAM-operated rats and changes in the disease-associated transcriptome arising
  secondary to RYGB. Color intensity reflects weighted z-score. (B) Annotation of
  the KEGG TGF-β signaling pathway with genes, the expression of which is significantly
  altered by RYGB. Green signifies that expression is reduced by RYGB and red indicates
  increased expression following RYGB. (C) Validation of expression changes in Grem-2
  and Id4 at the mRNA level was undertaken by quantitative RT-PCR. *P<0.05 SHAM versus
  fa/+ and #p<0.05 RYGB versus SHAM. RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR; RYGB, Roux-en-Y
  gastric bypass; SHAM, sham surgery (laparotomy); TGF-β, transforming growth factor.'
