caption: LPS, a component of gram-negative bacteria, can be delivered into the cytosol
  of host cells. The presence of intracellular LPS results in the activation of the
  non-canonical inflammasome signaling pathway. The activation of caspase-11 requires
  the aggregation of CARD from a monomer, via a homodimer, to a homotetramer, then
  the oligomerization of caspase-11 induces self-cleavage, which results in the release
  of the catalytic domain of caspase-11. The catalytic domain of caspase-11 then cleaves
  GSDMD, inducing pyroptosis.
