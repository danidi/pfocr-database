caption: 'Human and mouse bile acid synthesis and conjugation. Cholesterol catabolism
  results in the creation of primary bile acids (BAs) through either the classical
  pathway, accomplished by Cytochrome P450 7A1 (CYP7A1), or the alternative/acidic
  pathway, conducted by Cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1). Alteration by various cytochrome
  P450 family of enzymes allows for the creation of cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic
  acid (CDCA). Primary BAs can become conjugated to glycine or taurine prior to secretion
  to the biliary ductules. Deconjugation and reconjugation occurs in the distal ileum
  through bacterial intervention creating secondary BAs: lithocholic acid (LCA) or
  deoxycholic acid (DCA). Mice have additional primary BAs: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
  and α- and β-muricholic acid. The murine specific primary BAs created by cytochrome
  P450 2C70 (CYP2C70) can also be conjugated to glycine or taurine prior to secretion
  into bile duct and alteration by gut microbiota into secondary BAs. Figure reprinted
