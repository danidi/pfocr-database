caption: Mechanisms of sorafenib resistance. Sorafenib as an anticancer drug is transported
  into the cell through SLC proteins (e.g., OCT1). Inside the cell, the drug is broken-down
  via phase 1 cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and phase 2 UDP glucuronosyltransferase
  1A9 (UGT1A9) mediated metabolism to form the M1-M8 metabolites []. Sorafenib glucuronide
  (SG) is excreted out of the cell by a process mediated by ABC transporters. Aberrations
  in the expression of SLC proteins and ABC transporters, as well as genetic polymorphisms
  in metabolizing enzymes can control intracellular concentration, subsequently influencing
  drug efficacy. Sorafenib is a drug designed to target multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors
  such as VEGF, PDGF, and EGF that activate downstream signaling pathways such as
  the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Overexpressed drug targets and perpetually activated
  signaling pathways will promote cell proliferation and survival, therefore promoting
  chemoresistance. Cellular processes such as DNA repair, apoptosis, and autophagy
  can redirect their effect to promote cell proliferation and survival rather than
  cell death.
