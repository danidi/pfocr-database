caption: Predicted models for central metabolisms of A. thiooxidans strains, including
  carbon assimilation (A), nitrogen metabolism (B), and sulfur oxidation (C). In the
  incomplete TCA cycle (citrate cycle), 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase that catalyzes
  the transformation of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA was predicted to be absent
  (orange area), which were also previously reported in some other studies (,). The
  nitrate reductase (NarGHJI) and nitrite reductase (NirBD) pertaining to dissimilatory
  nitrate reduction, and putative assimilatory nitrate reductase catalytic subunit
  (NasA) associated to assimilatory nitrate reduction were predicted to be present
  in A. thiooxidans species except for ATCC 19377 (green area). For strain ATCC 19377,
  ammonium was required as an alternative nitrogen source. Unlike other A. thiooxidans
  strains, a key enzyme sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR) involved in sulfur oxidation
  was absent in draft genome of strain ATCC 19377 probably due to the low sequencing
  depth (blue area). CBS, carboxysome; PP pathway, pentose phosphate pathway; CODH,
