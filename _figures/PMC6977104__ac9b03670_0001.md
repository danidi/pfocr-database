caption: Schematic representation of the glycolate-oxalate metabolic pathway. Only
  the metabolites of interest to this study are represented. The expected isotopomers
  are shown. The red cross shows which enzymatic conversion is affected in primary
  hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) patients. (AGT, alanine:glyoxlyate aminotransferase).
