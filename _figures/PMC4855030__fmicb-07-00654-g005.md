caption: Interaction network of innate immunity related proteins. The proteins classified
  as belonging to innate immune response pathway were analyzed by STRING database
  and an interaction network was generated using Cytoscape. The edges connecting NS1
  and known NS1-interacting host proteins are represented by dashed lines and the
  NS1-interacting host protein nodes are highlighted by an octagon shaped border.
  Nodes represent the proteins in the network. Edges represent the interaction connecting
  the two nodes.
