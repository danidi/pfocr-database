caption: Roles of PARPs in the immune response after pathogen invasion. (A) Viral
  RNA degradation in a cell. Viral RNA is equipped with a m7G cap and a poly(A) tail
  at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the sequence, respectively. PARP13 has a role in this process
  though a binding interaction, which initiates a series of other actions. Upon binding
  though its N-terminal zinc finger region to the 3′ end of the viral RNA sequence
  (1), degradation factors are recruited. At the 3′ end, a deadenylase known as poly(A)-specific
  RNase (PARN) binds to PARP13, prompting the removal of the tail (2). At the 5′ end,
  a decapping complex formed by dcp1a and dcp2 (3) performs the removal of the m7G
  cap (4). A second degradation factor known as the exosome binds the zinc finger
  region of PARP13 through its RRP46 and RRP42 subunits (green and purple), signaling
  the 3′-5′ degradation process (5). In addition, PARP13 is removed from the RNA molecule
  (6). At the 5′ end a second exoribonuclease known as XRN1 initiates the degradation
  of the 5′ end of the sequence (7). This pathway results in the degradation of viral
  RNA from both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the sequence (8). (B) Some of the roles of other
  PARP family members following the infection of a host cell by a RNA virus. Following
  replication, PARP12 has also been shown to degrade viral RNA. In addition, the presence
  of viral RNA in the cytoplasm activates protein kinase RNA-activated ISGs which
  initiate the production of stress granules, where PARP5, -12, -13, -14, and -15
  can be found. These PARPs function to modify other proteins such as the argonaute
  proteins, G3BP1, and TIA-1. In the cytoplasm, they also act to modify proteins by
  PARylation and are thought to function as scaffolds to recruit other RNA-binding
  proteins. (C) Immune responses following the infection of a host cell by two DNA

  of viral replication (, , ).
