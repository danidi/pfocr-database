caption: Schematic overview of the LPS TLR4 signaling pathway. Recognition of LPS
  is established by the interplay between lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins (LBPs)
  and CD14 that transfer the LPS to the MD-2/TLR4 complex. Dimerization of TLR4 then
  initiates downstream intracellular signaling transduction through Toll-interleukin-1
  receptor (TIR) domains and several adaptor molecules. Eventually, the intracellular
  signaling results in the activation of specific pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles
  by the MYD88-dependent or TRIF-dependent pathway.
