caption: Rag GTPase-dependent amino acid signaling pathway upstream of mTORC1. (A)
  Current model of mTORC1 activation by amino acids in mammals. In the presence of
  amino acids, the heterodimeric Rag GTPase complex is comprised of GTP-bound RagA/B
  and GDP-bound RagC/D (active Rag complex). The active Rag complex anchors mTORC1
  to the lysosome. During amino acid scarcity, mTORC1 is dispersed throughout the
  cell at an unknown location. Ragulator functions as a scaffold to anchor the Rag
  complex to the lysosome, and is a GEF for RagA/B. v-ATPase binds to Ragulator and
  is required for mTORC1 activity. GATOR1 functions upstream of the Rag complex as
  a GAP for RagA/B. KICKSTOR is thought to tether GATOR1 to the lysosome. GATOR2 functions
  upstream of GATOR1 and inhibits GATOR1 through an unknown mechanism. Sestrin1/2
  is a cytosolic leucine sensor and CASTOR1/2 is a cytosolic arginine sensor. In the
  absence of amino acids, Sestrin1/2 and CASTOR1/2 bind to and inhibit GATOR2. The
  presence of leucine or arginine interrupts the interaction between Sestrin1/2 and
  GATOR2 or CASTOR1/2 and GATOR2. FLCN-FNIP2 is a GAP for RagC/D. Positive regulators
  of mTORC1 are indicated in green and negative regulators are indicated in red. (B)
  Current model of TORC1 activation by amino acids in yeast. In their active form,
  Gtr1 binds to GTP and Gtr2 binds to GDP. Ego1, Ego2, and Ego3 form the EGO complex
  that anchors the Gtr complex to the lysosome. Vam6 is a GEF for Gtr1. Lst7-Lst4
  acts as a GAP for Gtr2. SEACAT inhibits SEACIT, which is a GAP for Gtr1. Methionine
  activates TORC1 activity by promoting SAM synthesis, which in turn activates PP2A
  and inhibits SEACIT. Leucine activates TORC1 through Cdc60. Positive regulators
  of TORC1 are indicated in green and negative regulators are indicated in red.

  description: Rag GTPase-dependent amino acid signaling pathway upstream of mTORC1.
    (A) Current model of mTORC1 activation by amino acids in mammals. In the presence
