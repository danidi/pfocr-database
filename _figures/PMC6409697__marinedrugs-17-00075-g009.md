caption: rLj-112 was internalized with EGFR to suppress the downstream signaling pathways
  to initiate the anti-tumor steps in B16 cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) or
  other ligands might target EGFR (labeled with orange) on the membrane of the B16
  cells to activate the downstream signaling pathways including PI3K, Akt, and MAPK
  (increased phosphorylation levels) to promote cell proliferation, migration, invasion,
  and survival. After treatment with FITC-labeled rLj-112 (green), both rLj-112 and
  EGFR (orange) were internalized into the cytoplasm of the B16 cells and subsequently
  the downstream signaling pathways including PI3K, Akt, and MAPK were inhibited (decreased
  phosphorylation levels) which finally led to the suppression of cell proliferation,
  migration, invasion, and survival. Promotion is indicated with purple arrows; while
  suppression is indicated with red arrows.
