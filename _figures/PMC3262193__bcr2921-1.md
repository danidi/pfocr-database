caption: STAT5 influences differentiation, survival, and proliferation through alterations
  in cellular gene expression. After activation by tyrosine phosphorylation (P), STAT5A
  and STAT5B form homodimers and heterodimers that move into the nucleus, where they
  can act as transcription factors to influence gene expression. STAT5, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 5.
