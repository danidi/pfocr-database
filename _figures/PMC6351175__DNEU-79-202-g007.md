caption: Hypothesized regulatory relationships between TGFβ, Tgif1, miR‐18a, and NeuroD
  during photoreceptor differentiation. Tgif1 functions downstream of Smad2 and Smad3
  in the TGFβ signaling pathway (Lenkowski and Raymond, ). As a transcriptional corepressor,
  Tgif1 negatively regulates the expression of miR‐18a, and miR‐18a suppresses NeuroD
  protein levels to regulate the timing of photoreceptor differentiation.
