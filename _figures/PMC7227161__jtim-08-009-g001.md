caption: 'Schematic diagram of the role of ACE2 in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
  and its protective effect on organs. Ang I is converted to Ang II by ACE. ACE2 converts
  Ang II to Ang 1-7. Ang 1-7 interacts with Mas receptor to exert opposite effect
  to ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway in multiple organs such as heart, lung, and kidney. ACE2
  also cleaves Ang I to produce the presumably inactive Ang 1-9, and Ang1-9 can further
  be converted to Ang1-7 by ACE. Ang I: angiotensin I; Ang II: angiotensin II; ACE:
  angiotensin-converting enzyme; ACE2: angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; Ang1-7: angiotensin
  1-7; Ang1-9: angiotensin 1-9; AT1R: angiotensin II type 1 receptor. AT2R: angiotensin
  II type 2 receptor; Mas: Mas receptor.'
