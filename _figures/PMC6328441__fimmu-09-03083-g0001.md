caption: Upstream regulatory pathway of CHOP. The three signaling branches of UPR
  lead to CHOP transcription. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which results in
  the translation of ATF4. Subsequently, ATF4 translocates to the nucleus, which increases
  the expression of CHOP and ATF3. CHOP and ATF3 then bind to the promoters downstream
  genes. ATF6 translocates to Golgi apparatus, where it is activated by proteolysis.
  Activated ATF6 transcriptionally upregulates CHOP expression. Additionally, ATF6
  can regulate XBP-1 to activate CHOP. On one hand, the activation of IRE1α processes
  unspliced XBP1 mRNA to create activated XBP1(s), which enters the nucleus and controls
  the expression of CHOP. On the other hand, IRE1α activates apoptotic signaling kinase
  1 (ASK1), which in turn phosphorylates p38MAPK and JNK to activate CHOP.
