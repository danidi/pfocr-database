caption: Hyperglycemia-induced metabolic derangement in endothelial cells. During
  diabetes, entry of glucose-6-phosphate into the pentose phosphate pathway is inhibited.
  This causes a reduction in the production of NADPH and a buildup of H2O2, which
  both contribute to oxidative stress in diabetic endothelial cells
