caption: Interplay between nutrient-sensing pathways potentially affecting health
  span. A complex crosstalk exists between nutrient and energy-sensing pathways in
  mammals. Caloric restriction (CR), that is a 25–30% reduction of caloric intake
  without malnutrition, as well as other dietary restriction (DR) interventions such
  as protein restriction (PR) or low protein/carbohydrate diets represent conditions
  that downregulate the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) mediated pathway. A reduced
  signaling of this pathway leads to a decrease of AKT, which causes the inhibition
  of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activation of forkhead box O transcription
  factor (FOXO) which, in turn, suppresses mTOR. Reciprocal modulation of mTOR and
  FOXO induced by CR correlates with reduced global protein synthesis and decreased
  cell growth and proliferation. In PR conditions, low levels of essential dietary
  amino acids, particularly of methionine, stimulates the expression of fibroblast
  growth factor 21 (FGF21), a main inhibitor of IGF1 signaling. Through these mechanisms,
  DR orchestrates a program of genes involved in protein homeostasis and stress resistance
  that positively affects health span. Under conditions of CR, increased cellular
  AMP/ATP and NAD+/NADH ratios cause activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
  and sirtuins (SIRTs), respectively. AMPK, a critical cellular energy sensor, inhibits
  mTOR and contributes to stimulate SIRTs, including SIRT1 and SIRT3. In turn SIRTs,
  through a positive loop, further favor activation of AMPK itself. Both AMPK and
  SIRTs activate FOXO and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator
  1α (PGC1α) through phosphorylation and deacetylation, respectively. PGC1α coactivates
  FOXO thus favoring the expression of key antioxidant enzymes as well as pathways
  involved in autophagy and mitophagy. Moreover, PGC1α induces the transcription of
  many important genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, complete fatty acid oxidation
  and stress resistance pathways. Therefore AMPK, SIRTs, FOXO and PGC1α can engage
  in a positive feedback loop, thus connecting these sensors into a unified response
  which may improve health span. This simplified model does not account for macronutrient-specific
  responses or tissue-specific nutrient detection and it does not distinguish between
  different tissues when summarizing downstream signaling effects.
