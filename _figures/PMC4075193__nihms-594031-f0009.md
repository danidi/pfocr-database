caption: AngII directly induces multiple ECM protein synthesis including fibulin-2
  and TGF-β. We postulate that the increased fibulin-2 in the ECM stimulates TGF-β
  activation, by which TGF-β is further up-regulated in an autocrine fashion. The
  additional TGF-β-mediated effects, cardiac hypertrophy and increased ECM protein
  synthesis are only seen in WT mice. Thus fibulin-2 is necessary in activating endogenous
  TGF-β in the ECM.
