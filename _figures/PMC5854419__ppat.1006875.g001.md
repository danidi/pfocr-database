caption: A. Distinct and overlapping functions of the cAMP-PKA pathway and Pmk1 and
  Mps1 MAPK cascades during plant infection. B. Physical and chemical signals known
  to trigger appressorium formation include surface hydrophobicity and hardness, cutin
  monomers, plant surface waxes, and primary alcohols. Msb2, Sho1, Pth11, and Cbp1
  are involved in recognizing extracellular or surface signals to activate the downstream
  cAMP-PKA pathway and Mst11-Mst7-Pmk1 MAPK cascade. Both the trimeric G-proteins
  and Ras monomeric G-proteins are functionally related to these two pathways that
  regulate appressorium formation, penetration, and invasive growth. Although its
  upstream sensors have not been characterized, the Bck1-Mkk2-Mps1 cascade likely
  functions downstream from PKC and is important for sporulation, appressorium penetration,
  and pathogenesis via downstream Mig1, Swi6, and possibly other transcription factors.
  The adapter protein Mst50 is involved in both Pmk1 and Mps1 pathways. Mip11 is a
  RACK protein that interacts with both Mst50 and Mck1. Pmk1 positively regulates
  Mst12, Mcm1, Sfl1, and likely other transcription factors during different infection
  processes. Together with the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor complex, Sfl1 also functions
  as a transcriptional repressor for hyphal growth. cAMP, cyclic adenosine monophosphate;
  MAPK, MAP kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PKC, protein kinase C; RACK, receptor for
  activated C kinase.
