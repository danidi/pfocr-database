caption: Changes in protein flux through the secretory pathway trigger signaling from
  ER-resident receptors including IRE1, ATF6 and PERK. The major components detailed
  in the text are shown for the PERK pathway, and the schematic summarizes the results
  of several in vivo studies in oligodendrocytes. Thus, perturbing the functions of
  PERK, eIF2 or CHOP exacerbates disease symptoms. These components normally fulfill
  adaptive functions to enable cells to re-establish homeostasis (green). In contrast,
  perturbing the function of GADD34 reduces disease symptoms, indicating that this
  protein normally serves to increase cell sensitivity to the effects of protein misfolding.
  As such, this activity can be, perhaps paradoxically, interpreted as maladaptive;
  however, the greater risk of apoptosis is offset because the cell is able to grow
  and function effectively.
