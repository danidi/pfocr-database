caption: In mammals, IGF-1 is produced primarily in the liver in response to growth
  hormone secreted by the pituitary gland. IGF-1 mainly functions as an endocrine
  hormone by activating the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) in distant tissues. Insulin secreted
  by pancreas activates the insulin receptor (INSR). IGF1R and INSR activate similar
  downstream signaling pathways via insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, which
  eventually inactivate FOXO transcription factors. Multiple mechanisms that perturb
  the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway have been identified in long-lived strains or
  species. For example, unique mutations in the growth hormone (GH) receptor and IGF1R
  are identified in Brandt’s bats, which downregulate insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Long-lived
  mouse strains and small dogs have reduced plasma IGF-1 levels compared to their
  counterparts. In addition, IGF1R expression levels in the brain negatively correlate
  with species maximum lifespan.
