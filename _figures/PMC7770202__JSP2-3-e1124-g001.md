caption: Signaling pathways of interest in the peripheral and central nociceptive
  pathway. Tissues innervated by the DRGs release proinflammatory mediators and neurotrophic
  factors, which act on their receptors on nerve endings and stimulate the NFκB response
  in DRGs. Damage to axons through compression or injury in age‐related degenerative
  diseases including intervertebral disc degeneration stimulates the expression of
  nerve injury markers and cell stress, such as, ATF3 and NPY. In response to damage
  or inflammation DRGs can dynamically regulate expression of cold and heat sensing
  ion channels, TRPA1 and TRPV1, and nociceptive neuropeptides, CALCA and TAC1. Nociceptive
  neuropeptides are released into the dorsal horn in the spinal cord where they act
  on their receptors RAMP1 and TACR1 to regulate expression in spinal nociceptive
  neurons
