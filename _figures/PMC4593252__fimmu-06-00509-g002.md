caption: Involvement of Crk adaptor proteins in TCR- and integrin-coupled signaling
  pathways that regulate T-lymphocyte adhesion. A simplified scheme of surface receptors
  and signaling pathways that regulate T-cell activation and adhesion. T-cell receptor
  (TCR) ligation results in Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the intracellular portion of the CD3
  subunits, leading to the recruitment of ζ-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kDa
  (ZAP-70) and its phosphorylation on several distinct tyrosine residues, including
  Tyr315 (). The subsequent Lck- and ZAP-70-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple
  substrates activates several signaling cascades, in which calcineurin (CaN) and
  protein kinase C theta (PKCθ) play a major role, leading to cell activation, proliferation,
  and differentiation. In parallel, Crk adaptor proteins transiently interact via
  their SH2 domain with ZAP-70 Tyr315 and, apparently, promote the recruitment of
  additional Crk-binding proteins to the receptor site that contribute to the “outside-in”
  signaling pathway (). Crk interaction with the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor
  (GEF), C3G, imposes the conversion of the small GTPase, RAP1, to an active GTP-bound
  protein, which in turn leads to activation of the LFA-1 integrin and increases T-cell
  adhesion. Activation of this “inside-out” signaling pathway, which promotes integrin-mediated
  T-cell adhesion, is sensitive to a regulation by immunophilins (). GEF-mediated
  activation of Rap1, which is essential for upregulation of the integrin receptors,
  can also be mediated by a WASP family verprolin-homologous protein-2 (WAVE2)-regulated
  CrkL-C3G complexes () as well as by other Crk-independent pathways (). Integrins
  can also initiate “outside-in” and “inside-out” signaling pathways since their interaction
  with ICAM-1 or extracellular matrix results in signal delivery that promotes conformational
  changes in adjacent integrins leading to increase in their clustering and binding
  affinity. For simplicity, additional effector proteins that interact with Crk, such
  as WAVE and immunophilins, which are also involved in the regulation of T-cell adhesion,
  are not included in the figure. Red arrows indicate direct effects and black arrows
  indicate indirect effects. Ag, antigen; AP-1, activation protein-1; C3G, CRK SH3
