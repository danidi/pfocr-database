caption: 'Hypothetical model representing the role of AtMIN7 involved in the cuticle
  formation and cuticle-associated defense response. The fatty acyl groups (C16/C18
  FAs) are generated in the plastid, which are exported from the plastid to the ER
  as C16/C18-CoA. In the ER, C16/C18-CoA are synthesized as wax and cutin precursors
  [,]. The intracellular transport pathway for wax- and cutin-related components from
  the ER to the plasma membrane (PM) are predicted by several putative mechanisms,
  one of which is the Golgi or TGN-mediated secretory pathway [,,,]. Multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) are the late endosomes in plants, which can form intraluminal vesicles
  involved in the delivery of defense cargoes upon the pathogen infection [,]. Here,
  MVBs might be involved in the intracellular transport of the wax- and cutin-related
  components. The extracellular export of the wax- and cutin-related components across
  the PM and cell wall of Arabidopsis is predicted to be carried out by the ATP-binding
  cassette (ABC) transporters and lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) [,,]. However, very

  In the present study, the TGN/EE-localized AtMIN7, an Arabidopsis ARF-GEF, is discovered
  to be critical for the cutin formation, which may play important roles in the sorting,
  assembling, or delivering cutin precursors or other related important components,
  such as the proteins and enzymes, involved in cutin formation through the intracellular
  trafficking pathway. Moreover, AtMIN7 might be involved in hormones (SA, JA, and
  ABA) biosynthesis, and also might be associated with the integration between plant
  hormones (specifically for SA, JA, and ABA) and plant cuticle for the defense against
  the Pto DC3000 pathogen infection in Arabidopsis plants. The detailed mechanisms
