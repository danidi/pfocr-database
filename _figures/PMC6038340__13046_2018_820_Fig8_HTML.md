caption: Working model of intra-pathway feedbacks and BRAF/MEK growth-inhibitory synergism.
  a In BRAF-wt/KRAS-mut contexts, selective BRAF inhibition induces BRAF-CRAF dimerization,
  which hyperactivates the MAPK pathway, thus resulting in relative resistance to
  treatment. In BRAF-wt/KRAS-wt contexts, paradoxical MAPK activation may be sustained
  by the RAS-dependent upstream signaling of RTKs (in particular EGFR family members).
  b Upon allosteric MEK inhibition, the MAPK pathway downstream of a mutant KRAS is
  efficiently shut down; however, MEK inhibition-induced removal of ERK-mediated feedback
  RTK inhibition may result in incomplete MAPK pathway inhibition or pathway reactivation,
  again resulting in relative resistance to the drug. c Combined BRAF/MEK inhibition
  results in efficient pathway blockade and a synergistic effect on cell growth inhibition,
  particularly downstream of a mutant KRAS; however, as highlighted also in panel
  b, in KRAS-wt contexts removal of ERK-mediated feedback RTK inhibition may result
  in RTK-dependent pathway (re)activation, thus resulting in only partial blockade
  of downstream signaling. d Thus, in KRAS-wt contexts, triple RTK (EGFR family in
  the specific case discussed here)/BRAF/MEK inhibition is hypothesized to completely
  prevent paradoxical MAPK activation; functional growth-inhibitory synergism will
  then vary according to the degree of intrinsic sensitivity/resistance to RTK inhibition
