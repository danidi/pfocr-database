caption: The mechanism of NRF2 activation by oxidative stress. In the basal nonstressed
  state, NRF2 is targeted for ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation
  by the KEAP1-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase. In response to oxidative stress, the
  direct binding of stressors to reactive cysteine residues results in a conformation
  change in KEAP1, which inhibits the ubiquitination of NRF2. As NRF2 is not release
  by KEAP1, it saturates all of KEAP1’s binding sites, allowing newly translated NRF2
  to bypass KEAP1, translocate to the nucleus, and upregulate cytoprotective gene
  expression.
