caption: 'Schematic diagram of glucose metabolism in the brain. Glucose is transported
  via glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) across the endothelial cells of the blood-brain
  barrier, and then enters neurons and astrocytes through GLUT3 and GLUT1. In neurons,
  HK catalyzes the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-P, which is the irreversible
  process and ATP-driven phosphorylation. Glucose-6-P, the crossroad-metabolite, connects
  different pathways of intracellular glucose metabolism. It can be catabolized by
  glycolysis in cytoplasm to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate can then enter mitochondria
  and be subsequently utilized to generate ATP via TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.
  Additionally, glucose-6-P can also enter the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which
  is the main source of reducing equivalents (NADPH) and provides the precursors for
  biomacromolecules synthesis such as ribose-5-P. In astrocytes, glutamatergic neurotransmission
  can induce the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS). Increased lactate in astrocytes
  is shuttled to neurons by monocarboxylate transporters, which can be used by neurons
  to generate ATP.HK: hexokinase; GPI: glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; Fru-6-P: fructose-6-phosphate;
