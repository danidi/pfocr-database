caption: Predicted metabolic pathway of methanol metabolism in strain La 6 based on
  genome sequence analysis. Enzymes are shown in red whilst compounds and names of
  pathways are in black. Solid arrows indicate enzymatic reactions, dashed arrows
  indicate reactions are non-enzymatic or unknown. Reactions within the blue/green
  box are part of the dissimilatory/assimilatory pathway. XoxF, methanol dehydrogenase;
  GSH-FDH, glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase; FGH, S-formylglutathione
  hydrolase; FDH, formate dehydrogenase; PurU, 10-formyl-H4F hydrolase; FtfL, formyl-H4F
  ligase; FolD, bifunctional methylene-H4F dehydrogenase- methenyl-H4F cyclohydrolase;
  Fch, methenyl-H4F cyclohydrolase; MetF, methyl-H4F reductase; EMC, ethylmalonyl-CoA;
  PHB, polyhydroxybutyrate.
