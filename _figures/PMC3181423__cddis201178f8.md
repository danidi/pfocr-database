caption: Model of the differential regulation of CD95L- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis
  by TNFR1. TNFR1-induced activation of the classical NFκB pathway results in concomitant
  upregulation of FLIPL/S and CD95. Although upregulation of FLIPL/S antagonizes TRAIL-induced
  apoptosis, this effect is overcompensated in context of CD95L-induced signaling
  by the strong increase in CD95 expression
