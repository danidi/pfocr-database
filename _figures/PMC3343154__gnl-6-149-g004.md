caption: Mitophagy inhibits pathways of mitochondrial dysfunction and associated cell
  death and inflammation. Mitophagy restitutes physiological cell functioning by inhibiting
  mitochondrial-related cell death and/or injury arising either from the generation
  of reactive oxygen-species (ROS) or pro-inflammatory signals, or as a result of
  mitochondrial membrane permeability transition (MPT). During activation of the intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway, BH3-only protein members, including BAK and BAX, effect mitochondrial
  membrane permeabilisation (MOMP) and release of intermembrane space proteins, including
  cytochrome c which induces a downstream caspase cascade activation that leads to
  apoptosis. Alternatively, necrotic cell death may be initiated by cyclophilin D-dependent
  initiation of MPT pore. Once opened, MPT destroys the mitochondrial transmembrane
  potential (Δψm), thereby abrogating oxidative phosphorylation and exacerbating ROS
  generation. Excessive ROS formation can activate the NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing
  protein 3 (NALP3) inflammasome. Uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation can also
  trigger MPT, during which mtDNA may undergo cytoplasmic translocation, leading to
  nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor-dependent inflammatory
  pathway activation. Importantly, excess intra-mitochondrial ROS is able to mutate
  mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), leading to premature aging and mitochondrial inefficiency
  post-replication (this in turn exacerbates ROS generation through impaired oxidative
  phosphorylation).
