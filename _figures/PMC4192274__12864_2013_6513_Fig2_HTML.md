caption: Genes from the PPAR signaling pathway that were in regions surrounding QTL
  associated with at least one trait using the Bayesian approach. Genes that are colored
  in blue, green and yellow were within 500kbs of a QTL associated with carcass conformation,
  carcass weight and carcass fat, respectively. The complete figure of the PPAR signaling
  pathway, showing all genes in this pathway, is contained in Additional file .
