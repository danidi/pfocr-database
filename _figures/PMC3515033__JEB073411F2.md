caption: Classification of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). All TLRs recognize bacteria
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of protein, lipid or nucleotide composition.
  Approximately half recognize viral PAMPs, either lipids or nucleotides. TLR2/6 and
  TLR4 recognize fungal PAMPs whereas TLR9 and TLR11 recognize protozoan PAMPs. Several
  of the TLRs respond to extracellular ligands (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 not shown)
  whereas others localize to cellular vesicles and respond to PAMPs that have been
  internalized by the cell (3, 7, 8, 9 and murine 11; human TLR11 is a pseudogene).
  Although some of the TLRs also activate proliferation of immune cells through an
  Akt-dependent pathway (not shown), they all induce the expression and secretion
  of cytokines. Cytokine production is largely responsible for behavioral changes
  induced by infection. All TLRs shown (TLR10 cooperates with TLR2 to recognize triacylated
  lipoproteins but does not activate typical TLR signaling) (), except TLR3, directly
  induce the expression of TNFα, IL-1β and IFNγ whereas TLR3, 4, 7 and 9 activation
  results primarily in IFNα and IFNβ expression (). A brief list of PAMPs or active
  analogs is shown for each TLR. For definitions, see List of abbreviations.
