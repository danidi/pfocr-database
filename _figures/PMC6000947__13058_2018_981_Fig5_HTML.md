caption: Model of crosstalk between triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and lymphatic
  endothelial cells (LECs). In TNBC, secreted IL-6 from TNBC cells binds to IL-6 receptor
  in LECs, which enhances CCL5 secretion by activating the STAT3 signaling pathway
  in LECs. The interaction of CCL5 and CCR5 consequently promotes TNBC tumor growth
  and metastasis. Therefore, maraviroc and tocilizumab are potential therapeutic drugs
  to inhibit TNBC tumor growth and metastasis
