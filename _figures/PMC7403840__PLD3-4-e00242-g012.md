caption: Hypothetical model of the early transcriptional changes in roots to NAE 18:2
  and NAE 18:3. NAE 18:2 may be bound to a signaling receptor or oxidized by lipoxygenase
  (LOX) 1. LOX 1 introduces a hydro(per)oxy group at the 9 position in the acyl chain
  of NAE18:2 generating 9NAE‐H(P)OD. NAE 18:3 may be bound to a signaling receptor
  or be oxidized by LOX 2. LOX 2 introduces a hydro(per)oxy group at the 13 position
  in the acyl chain of NAE18:3 generating 13NAE‐H(P)OT. (a and b) The NAE oxylipins,
  9NAE‐HOD or 13NAE‐HOT, are presumed to bind to a signaling receptor that upon activation
  modulates the abundance of transcripts that encode proteins involved in several
  plant hormone response or stress response pathways. NAE 18:3 or 13NAE‐HOT increased
  the abundance of PBL27, a chitin signaling component that links receptor activation
  to MAPK signaling specifically in roots. In addition, transcripts that encode enzymes
  in the ABA biosynthesis pathway or MAPKs increased in abundance. The activation
  of the signaling receptor and/or downstream secondary messengers increases or decreases
  the abundance of transcription factors and ubiquitin ligases. The change in abundance
  of transcription factors inhibits the expression of cell wall biosynthesis enzymes
  and structural components of the cell walls. In addition, ubiquitin ligases facilitate
  the turnover of proteins involved in primary root elongation. Ultimately, these
  pathways lead to a reduction in primary root elongation
