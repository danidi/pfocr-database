caption: 'Disruption of ncRNA Networks in Cancer. (A): miRNA editing: in glioblastoma,
  ADAR2 edit the precursors of miR-222/221 and miR-21 and decrease expression of the
  corresponding oncomiRs in vitro and in vivo, (B): Epigenetic regulation: Methylation
  and deacetylation of miR-127 promoter suppresses expression of the tumor suppressor
  miRNA. Consequently, BCL6 oncogene expression increases. (C): Uridylation of miRNA
  and lncRNA: the enzyme TUTase adds Uridine groups at the 3′-end of pre-let-7 and
  the lncRNA Rmrp. Degradation of oligo-Uridine tails through the exonuclease Dis3L2
  unified in the DMD pathway may explain the reduced expression of let-7 and other
  tumor suppressor miRNAs as well as lncRNAs deregulation in cancer. (D): 3′UTR regulatory
  sequences, ARES: ARES interact with micro-ribonucleoproteins (microRNPs) such as
  AGO2 as a complex with other proteins to regulate the stability and translation
  of mRNAs in response to external or internal stimuli. miR-369-3 binds ARES, AGO2
  and fragile X mental retardation-related protein 1 (FXR1) complex to induce translation
  of TNFα, in serum starved HEK293 and HeLa cell lines. When cells start to proliferate,
  miR-369-3 inhibits TNFα. (E): RBPs of 3′UTR, Pumilio: Bladder carcinomas selectively
  down-regulate miRNAs that cooperate with Pumilio to target E2F3, and multiple tumor
  cell lines shorten the 3′-end of the E2F3 mRNA, removing the Pumilio regulatory
  elements. (F): 3′UTR alterations SNPs: A somatic SNP in the 3′UTR of the oncogene
  MDM4 created a new binding site for miR-191. This miRNA suppressed only the oncogene
  MDM4-C allelic variant expression and retarded ovarian cancer progression and the
  tumor became chemosensitive. (G): LncRNA modifications: (1) Methylation: tumor suppressor,
  lncRNA MEG3, has binding sites for onco-miR-9, so that it does not bind its targets,
  FOXO1 and E-cadherin, in ESCC human cell lines. Promoter of lncRNA MEG3 is usually
  methylated in ESCC and cannot sequester miR-9 and this induces to proliferation
  of cancer cells. (2) SNPs: lncRNA PTENP1 polymorphism rs7853346 in GC, change the
  local folding structure of lncRNAPTENP1. The latter is not able to exert its decoying
  effect on miR-106b and miR-93, with a consequent reduction of the tumor suppressor
  PTEN gene expression.'
