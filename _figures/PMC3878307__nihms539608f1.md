caption: 'The enzymes and metabolites discussed in this study are indicated in this
  schematic. TMEFF2 is shown interacting with SARDH. Changes in the expression of
  TMEFF2 affect the activity and/or expression of some of the enzymes of this pathway,
  and ultimately its balance, possibly affecting the methylation potential of the
  cell (see text). Negative regulation of GNMT by CH3-THF and of CH3-THF formation
  by SAM is indicated by dotted lines. SAH: S-adenosyl-homocysteine; Hy: homocysteine.
  Other abbreviations are as described throughout the manuscript.'
