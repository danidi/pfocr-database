caption: Signal crosstalk during NO-regulated stomatal closure in turgid leaves of
  Arabidopsis thaliana. In turgid leaves ABA-induced stomatal closure is dependent
  on the synthesis of H2O2 by various NADPH oxidases and the subsequent synthesis
  of nitric oxide (NO) by nitrate reductase 1 (NR1). NO signals via a Ca2+-dependent
  ABA signaling pathway, possibly by the S-nitrosylation of Ca2+-dependent ion channels.
  Numerous environmental signals modulate this response and determine the actual stomatal
  apertures observed., Interestingly the ABA-induced accumulation of H2O2 in turgid
  guard cells also appears to depend on the ability of the ethylene receptor, ETR1,
  to perceive ethylene and although not actually required for the ABA-induced accumulation
  of this reactive oxygen species, downstream components of the ethylene signal transduction
  pathway also seem to be required for H2O2 to signal its presence in these cells.,
  Thus, the synthesis and signaling of H2O2 and NO in turgid guard cells may constitute
  points of convergence of ABA and ethylene signaling. However, numerous question
  remain concerning how the activities of the NADPH oxidases and NR1 are regulated
  and whether or not this occurs via the direct regulation of the extant proteins
  or via increased transcription as a result of ABA and ethylene signaling. Additionally,
  questions remain as to exactly how H2O2 induces NR1-mediated NO synthesis and whether
  this is either by the direct modulation of protein activity or as a result of downstream
  signaling. For example, H2O2 may signal in its own right or may mediate the activity
  of components of the ethylene signal transduction chain leading to an increase in
  NIA1 transcription. Future studies aim to clarify these questions.
