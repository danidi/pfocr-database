caption: Central illustration. Schematic representation illustrates the involvements
  of PPI and its related components in DDAH-related ventricular remodeling in postinfarcted
  rats. PPIs increase superoxide production through vitamin C-related decreased uptake.
  Thereby, attenuated DDAH activity increases ADMA levels and subsequent decreases
  eNOS activity. Inhibition of these signaling pathways by their respective inhibitors
  is indicated by the vertical lines. RONS, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.
  ADMA, asymmetric dimethylarginine; DDAH2, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase
  2; LV, left ventricular; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PPI, proton pump inhibitors;
  p-eNOS, phosphorylated-eNOS; RONs, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species; Vit C,
  vitamin C.
