caption: Roles of lectin pathway PRRs in multiple situations and important processes.
  Upon presentation of a number of different situations; cell stress, bacterial, viral
  or fungal invasion and apoptotic cells, the PRRs of the lectin pathway bind to substrates
  and through MASPs cause lectin pathway mediated cleavage of C3. This stimulates
  inflammation, enhances antigen presentation and T and B cell responses, opsonisation,
  parenchymal injury and cell death. In addition, PRRs of the lectin pathway have
  roles in the clotting cascade and MASPs themselves can aid in the regulation of
  certain cellular and developmental pathways. PRR pattern recognition receptor, LP
  lectin pathway, MASP MBL-associated serine protease, Ag antigen, LTA lipoteichoic
  acid. Note that the binding ligand for CL-11 on mammalian cells is represented as
  a monosaccharide, when in reality it forms part of complex polysaccharides
