caption: Recapitulative scheme of the suggested resveratrol signaling pathway on mitochondrial
  metabolism. RSV directly stimulates complex I activity (1), thus turning on the
  mitochondrial NAD+/NADH balance toward increasing NAD+ concentration (2). This favors
  sirtuin activation (3), which finally enhances substrates supply to respiratory
  chain by both tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation (4). This increase
  in substrate supplies to the respiratory chain leads to an increase in respiration
  rates (5) after resveratrol treatment.
