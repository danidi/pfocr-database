caption: Diverse extracellular signaling pathways are regulated by A disintegrin and
  metalloproteinase (ADAM)-mediated shedding events. (a) TNFα/TNFR signaling pathway.
  ADAM17 is the principal protease responsible for the cleavage of the TNFαligand
  and both TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors, all of which are type II transmembrane proteins.
  (i ) Membrane-anchored TNFα (mTNFα) precursors engage in juxtacrine signaling with
  cell surface TNFRs, particularly high-affinity TNFR2 receptors. (ii ) ADAM17 cleaves
  mTNFαto release soluble TNFαligand (sTNFα) that can bind to cell surface TNFRs in
  an autocrine or paracrine manner. (iii ) ADAM17 can also cleave TNFRs, reducing
  the level of functional TNFR signaling at the cell surface. Soluble TNFRs (sTNFRs)
  can act as decoy receptors by sequestering sTNFα. (b) ErbB ligand/ErbB receptor
  signaling pathway. Multiple ADAMs, particularly ADAM10 and ADAM17, are responsible
  for cleaving different ErbB ligands and ErbB receptors, which are all type I transmembrane
  proteins. Both ADAM10 and ADAM17 cleave several ErbB ligands, such as HB-EGF and
  neuregulin (NRG1), under different experimental conditions. Mouse genetic loss-of-function
  studies have implicated other ADAMs (e.g., ADAM9 and ADAM19) in the processing of
  ErbB ligands (not shown). (i ) Membrane-anchored ErbB ligand precursors, such as
  HB-EGF, engage in juxtacrine signaling with cell surface ErbB receptors. (ii ) ADAM10
  and ADAM17 cleave different membrane-anchored ErbB ligands, releasing soluble ligands
  that function in an autocrine or paracrine manner. (iii ) ADAM10 and ADAM17 can
  cleave ERBB2 and ERBB4 receptors, respectively, reducing functional ErbB receptor
  signaling at the cell surface. Soluble ErbB receptors can act as decoy receptors,
  and soluble ERBB2 (sERBB2) can reduce the therapeutic efficacy of neutralizing antibodies
  against ERBB2 receptors. (c) IL-6 trans-signaling. The IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) can
  be cleaved by ADAM10 and ADAM17, but ADAM specificity is species dependent. In classical
  IL-6 signaling, IL-6 binds to cell surface IL-6R, which recruits two molecules of
  GP130 into a functional ligand/receptor signaling complex. However, in IL-6 trans-signaling,
  IL-6R is cleaved by either ADAM10 or 17 to release soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R) that can
  bind to soluble IL-6 ligand. The IL-6/sIL-6R complex has high affinity for cells
  expressing GP130 receptor and activates them. Classic IL-6 signaling mediates the
  activation of anti-inflammatory and regenerative pathways, whereas IL-6 trans-signaling
  is primarily observed in inflammatory and stress conditions. (d ) Cell adhesion.
  ADAM10 and ADAM17 cleave different cell adhesion molecules that alter cell-cell
  interactions. (i ) Homotypic E-cadherin protein interactions are involved in maintaining
  adherens junction formation between epithelial cells. ADAM10 cleaves E-cadherin,
  resulting in (ii ) decreased cell-cell interaction and altered epithelial cell migration.
  (iii ) L-selectin and VCAM1 are examples of cell adhesion molecules involved in
  leukocyte rolling and adhesion to endothelial cells (not shown). (e) Canonical Notch
  signaling. ADAM10 initiates the processing and activation of the Notch receptors.
  (i ) Notch ligand expressed on the signal-sending cell engages the Notch receptor
  on the signal-receiving cell. (ii ) Normally, the negative regulatory region (NRR)
  within the Notch receptor masks the α-secretase (S2) cleavage site close to the
  transmembrane domain. Notch ligand binding to its receptor is proposed to confer
  a conformational change in the NRR domain, allowing ADAM10 to access the Notch S2
  cleavage site. ADAM10 is responsible for cleavage of the NOTCH1, -2, and -3 receptors.
  (iii ) The Notch remnant is subject to intramembrane proteolysis, in which the γ-secretase
  complex cleaves within the intramembrane domain at the S3 cleavage site to release
  the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) into the cytoplasm. After translocation into
  the nucleus, the NICD associates with other transcriptional cofactors and activates
  expression of Notch-responsive genes such as Hes1. (iv) Under certain experimental
  conditions, Notch ligands can be subject to extracellular cleavage by ADAM proteases,
  such as ADAM17. Notch ligand processing may limit active ligand availability, or
  it may be involved in ligand sequential processing or bidirectional signaling by
  the ligand intracellular domain. Alternatively, soluble Notch ligand may bind to
  and activate Notch receptors via a noncanonical pathway. ( f ) Exosome signaling.
  ADAM10 and substrates such as L1, CD44, and Notch are enriched in exosomes, providing
  a mechanism for short- and long-range cellular communication. ADAM10 and its substrates
  on the cell surface are trafficked through the endosomal compartment and then enriched
  in intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) produced within multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Upon
  MVB fusion with the plasma membrane (PM), IVLs are released as exosomes into the
  extracellular environment. (i ) L1 and CD44 can be shed from ADAM10-expressing exosomes
  into the extracellular space (not shown). (ii ) Exosomes can also interact with
  cells at distant cellular sites. In addition, ADAMs may be expressed on ectosomes
  generated by outward budding of the PM (not shown).
