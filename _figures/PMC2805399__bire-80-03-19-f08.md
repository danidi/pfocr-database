caption: A proposed working model of the complex Sertoli cell-germ cell interaction
  describing the mechanism by which Sertoli cells trigger germ cell apoptosis following
  MEHP-induced Sertoli cell injury. First, MEHP-induced decreases in TIMP2 expression
  in Sertoli cells allow for the increased activation of MMP2. Active MMP2 can then
  cleave membrane-bound TNFA produced by germ cells to generate the soluble active
  form of TNFA. The binding of sTNFA with Sertoli cell TNFRSF1A triggers the NFKB1
  signaling pathway and robustly induces FASL expression. An increase in Sertoli cell
  FASL allows for the instigation of germ cell apoptosis by the classic death receptor
  pathway.
