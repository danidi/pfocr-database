caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway of prodiginines produced by bacterial endophyte
  S. marcescens MSRBB2 with assigned incorporation of labeled precursors (15NH4Cl,
  [1–13C]-L-proline, [methyl-D3]-L-methionine, [1,2–13C2]-sodium acetate). The pathway
  was modified based on earlier publications,. MAP: 2-methyl-3-amylpyrrole; HBM: 4-hydroxy-2,2′-bipyrrole-5-methylalcohol;
  HBC: 4-hydroxy-2,2′-bipyrrole-5-carboxaldehyde; MBC: 4-methoxy-2,2′-bipyrrole-5-carboxaldehyde;
  AdoMet: S-adenosylmethionine.'
