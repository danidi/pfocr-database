caption: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) expression can be regulated
  at the transcriptional level by tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNFα) (arrow 1) through
  the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein-1 (AP1), which
  negatively regulate PPARγ expression–. Recent data indicate rapid turnover of PPARγ
  mRNA in adipocytes and treatment of cultured adipocytes with TNFα might enhance
  PPARγ mRNA degradation (dashed arrow 2). Translational control of PPARγ that is
  mediated by MAP4K4 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase-4), a
  protein kinase that is upregulated by TNFα, can also occur (arrow 3). Furthermore,
  activation of caspases by TNFα signalling might trigger PPARγ protein degradation
  in adipocytes (dashed arrow 4). Regulation of PPARγ activity and stability are also
  negatively regulated by kinase-mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, which
  promote PPARγ protein degradation through a proteasome-dependent pathway (arrow
  5). TNFα action at multiple levels might therefore result in decreased PPARγ activity.
  Precise regulation of PPARγ expression and function can contribute to the control
  of triglyceride biosynthesis, hydrolysis and deposition in the lipid droplet — the
  lipid storage organelle of adipocytes. This can occur through the regulation of
  the expression of triglyceride metabolism enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
  (PEPCK), fatty acid synthase (FAS), Acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), lipoprotein lipase
  (LPL) and lipid-droplet proteins including CIDEA, FSP27 and perilipin (arrow 6).
  Dashed arrows that emanate from PPARγ mRNA (step 2) and protein (step 4) indicate
  hypotheses that await definitive testing.
