caption: 'Ceramide metabolism in desipramine-pretreated mice undergoing septic cardiomyopathy.
  Data of transcripts related to biosynthesis and metabolism of ceramide were extracted
  from micro array experiments for schematic depiction of gene expression changes
  comparing mice with polymicrobial sepsis with subsequent cardiac dysfunction. Desipramine
  pretreatment not only resulted in inhibition of rapid and transient ceramide generation
  by acid sphingomyelinase Smpd1, but also in blockade of metabolism by ceramidases
  (Asah1, Asah2, Asah3l), which were all moderately down-regulated. The increase of
  ceramide levels could also be controlled by an up-regulation of transcripts related
  to de novo synthesis of ceramide: three ceramide synthases (Cers2, Cers4, Cers5)
  were found to be up-regulated. Interestingly, the desaturase Degs1 catalyzing the
  last step in the ceramide biosynthetic pathway and a catalytic subunit of the rate
  limiting enzyme serine-palmitoyl transferase (Sptlc) were also significantly up-regulated.
  Development of ceramide overload might also be affected by strong and significant
  down-regulation of sphingomyelin synthase (Sms). Transcripts encoding enzymes for
  the metabolism of sphingosine (sphingosine kinases Sphk1/2 as well as sphingosine-1-phosphate
  phosphatase, Sgpp1) were unaffected. There was also no change in transcript levels
  of enzymes regulating (de-)phosphorylation of ceramide (Ppp2ca, Lpin). Change of
  expression level is represented by a color code (blue down-regulation, red up-regulation),
  significant changes are indicated by an arrow (Abbreviations: C1P: ceramide-1-phosphate).'
