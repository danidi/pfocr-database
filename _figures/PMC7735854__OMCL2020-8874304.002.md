caption: 'Double-edged sword effects of astrocyte activation. TBHQ activates Nrf2
  and then regulates its downstream HO-1, HIF-1α, and VEGF. This process activates
  the Sigma-1 receptor, so that astrocytes become activated from inactivated, and
  activated astrocytes can play a role in resisting methamphetamine-induced oxidative
  stress. TBHQ can also increase activated astrocytes and their coverage to reduce
  ROS. ROS inhibits the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. TBHQ, as an Nrf2 agonist, can
  also indirectly activate Nrf2 by positively regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
  Sigma-1 receptor KO or Sigma-1 receptor antagonists can activate Nrf2 as well as
  block excessive Sigma-1 receptors, thereby preventing the overactivation of astrocytes.
  However, methamphetamine can induce overactivation of astrocytes. TBHQ: tert-butyl
  hydroquinone; Nrf2: nuclear factor E2 related factor 2; HO-1: heme oxygenase-1;
  HIF-1α: hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; KO:
  knockout; ROS: reactive oxygen species; PI3K: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; AKT:
  protein kinase B.'
