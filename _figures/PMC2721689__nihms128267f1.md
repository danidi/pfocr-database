caption: (A) Processing of RNAs in miRNA and siRNA. Pri-miRNA transcripts are processed
  by Drosha/DGCR8 in the nucleus and Dicer in the cytoplasm. The cleavage sites are
  indicated by orange triangles. siRNAs start as dsRNA and are processed by Dicer.
  In both cases the end product 20–30 nt RNA is incorporated into the RISC complex.
  (B) Model of piRNA pathway. Transposon mRNA is cleaved by PIWI using a piRNA guide
  strand. A fragment of cleaved transposon RNA is incorporated into Ago3 RISC and
  used to cleave the piRNA cluster transcript. Its fragment is incorporated into PIWI
  protein to start another round of the cycle. (C) Domain composition of proteins
  involved in RNA interference.
