caption: Major pathway of the conversion of propionyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA in human
  cells. The biotin-dependent enzyme, propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCCA, PCCB) converts
  propionyl-CoA into D-methylmalonyl-CoA which is then racemized into L-methylmalonyl-CoA
  and isomerized into succinyl-CoA, a Kreb cycle intermediate. The L-methylmalonyl-CoA
  mutase (MUT) reaction requires adenosylcobalamin. The class and genes associated
  with methylmalonic acidemia are mut (MUT), cblA (MMAA), cblB (MMAB), cblD variant
  2 (unknown gene(s)), cblC (MMAHC), cblF (unknown gene(s)). Question marks indicate
  unknown genes or poorly defined cellular processes.
