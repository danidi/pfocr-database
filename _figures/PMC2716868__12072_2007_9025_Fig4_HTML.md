caption: 'Schematic representation of the metabolic pathways involved in carbohydrate
  conversion to fat in the liver. Represented are glycolysis, part of the citric acid
  cycle, citrate cleavage enzyme, fatty acid synthase, fatty acyl-CoA desaturase,
  pentosephosphate pathway and triacylglycerol synthesis. The following nonstandard
  abbreviations are used: Fru, fructose; Gluc, glucose; Fru-1P, fructose 1-phosphate;
  Gluc-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; TrP, triosephosphates; OxAc, oxaloacetate; Citr,
  citrate; Mal, malonyl-; CAC, citric acid cycle; Facyl-, fatty acyl; –(C=C)–, monounsaturated,
  long-chain fatty acid; TAG, triacylglycerol; PPP, pentosephosphate pathway. Red
  triangles denote enzymes or other proteins whose gene expression was upregulated
  at least 1.5-fold, and they are as follows: 1, glucose transporter 5; 2, ketohexokinase;
  3, glucokinase; 4, components of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase isoenzymes); 5, citrate cleavage enzyme; 6, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  7, stearoyl (fatty acyl)-CoA desaturase; 8, acylglycerol O-acyltransferase; 9, malic
  enzyme (cytosolic and NADP-dependent). The pentosephosphate pathway (PPP) is represented
  here at the lower right side of the figure by the reaction catalyzed by glucose
  6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which was upregulated in HCD-fed animals. Genes encoding
  enzymes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation, a pathway that may contribute to triacylglycerol
  accumulation in the liver, were not found to be changed. Also, some of the genes
  listed in Table  are not represented in the figure in order to keep a certain degree
  of simplicity. Enzyme classification (EC) for the enzymes in the map is given in
  Table'
