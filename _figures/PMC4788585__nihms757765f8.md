caption: Proteolytic cleavage of the membrane-bound AREG precursor (proAREG) results
  in the release of soluble AREG that binds and activates EGFR ultimately promoting
  G1/S progression via pathways that involve classical MEK/ERK signaling, cyclin D1
  phosphorylation of Rb and activation of E2F family transcription factors. A second,
  as yet not completely characterized intracellular pathway, possibly involving the
  proAREG cytoplasmic domain, supports a separate FoxM1-dependent program necessary
  for G2/M transition and cytokinesis.
