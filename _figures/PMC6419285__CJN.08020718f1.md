caption: MicroRNA biogenesis and function. microRNA coding regions in the human genome
  are found either intergenic or in the introns of annotated genes. microRNA synthesis
  starts in the nucleus where most of the miRs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II
  into primary miR transcripts (pri-miR) of several kilobases that contain local stem-loop
  structures. The first step of miR maturation is cleavage at the stem of the hairpin
  structure by a microprocessor complex consisting of Drosha (an RNase III protein)
  together with its cofactor DiGeorge Syndrome Critical Region 8 (DGCR8), which releases
  a small hairpin structure of 70 nucleotides that is termed a precursor miR (pre-miR).
  After nuclear processing, pre-miRs are exported to the cytoplasm by exportin 5 (XPO-5),
  where they are cleaved near the terminal loop by another RNase enzyme called Dicer,
  thereby releasing an approximately 22 nucleotide miR duplex. This duplex is loaded
  onto an AGO protein to generate the microRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC).
  One strand (guide strand) remains in the AGO protein as a biologically active miR
  whereas the other stand (passenger strand, known as miR*) is degraded. The mature
  miR as part of the effector RISC binds to the 3′UTR region of the mRNA and mediates
  mRNA degradation, destabilization, or translational inhibition. Apart from this
  canonical pathway, there is an alternative “mirtron” pathway, independent from Drosha
  and DGCR8. Mirtrons are miRs that originate from spliced-out introns and are created
  when small RNAs bind to the termini of small intronic hairpins. Pre-microRNA hairpins
  with 3′ overhangs are so formed and can mature into 22 nucleotides structures, which
  look and function as normal miRs. microRNAs exert their repressive function intracellularly,
  but are also released into the extracellular compartment, with this initiating their
  role as important intercellular communicators as they are taken up by recipient
  cells. microRNA can be released passively after cell death or injury, or can be
  actively secreted in different types of extracellular vesicles, including exosomes,
  microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. Circulating microRNAs form complexes with RNA
  binding proteins including AGO2 proteins and lipoproteins (HDL and LDL), which protects
  them from RNAse-dependent degradation. AB, apoptotic body; E, exosome; MV, microvesicle;
  RNA pol II, RNA polymerase 2.
