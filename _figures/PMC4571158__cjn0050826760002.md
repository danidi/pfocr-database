caption: A schematic presentation of secreted, endocytic, and signaling pattern-recognition
  receptors. (A) The lectin pathway of complement activation. Mannose-binding lectin
  is a secreted pattern-recognition receptor specific for microbial carbohydrates.
  Binding of mannose-binding lectin to its microbial ligands leads to activation of
  the complement cascade. (B) Endocytic pattern-recognition receptors stick to pathogen
  specific cell walls and mediate phagocytosis. The pathogens are digested into antigenic
  peptides and presented to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules
  on the surface of APCs. This complex is recognized by T-cell receptors, which leads
  to T-cell activation. (C) Signaling pattern-recognition receptors, which are represented
  by Toll-like receptors, recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The activation
  via these receptors mediates induction of cytokines and costimulatory molecules,
  for example CD80 and CD86, on the surface of APCs. Thus, pattern-recognition receptors
  of innate immunity system are instrumental for the adaptive immunity system.
