caption: 'Summary of the possible implication of R2R3-MYB transcription factors in
  the regulatory mechanisms of the flavonoid pathway during grape berry development.
  The roles of VvMYBPA1, VvMYB5a, VvMYB5b, VvMYBA1, and VvMYBA2 were assigned according
  to gene expression levels during berry development together with functional characterization
  data presented in this article for VvMYB5b and VvMYB5a, in  for VvMYBPA1, in  for
  VvMYB5a, and in  for the VvMYBA genes. Gene expression levels throughout berry development
  were determined by quantitative RT-PCR and are presented in  (VvMYB5b) and in Supplemental
  Figure S1 for the other genes. The same RNA samples extracted from Shiraz berries
  collected at various developmental stages (see “Materials and Methods”) were used
  to analyze the expression level of each gene. According to these data, VvMYBPA1,
  VvMYB5a, and VvMYB5b appear particularly involved in the regulation of PA synthesis
  before veraison in skin and seed tissues. At veraison, PA synthesis is complete
  and anthocyanin synthesis begins in skin cells where UFGT gene expression is specifically
  regulated by VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2, whereas genes encoding enzymes of the general
  flavonoid pathway required for anthocyanidin synthesis appear to be regulated by
  VvMYB5b. Abbreviations are as follows: PAL, Phe ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4
  hydroxylase; 4CL, 4 coumarate CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3 hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′5′ hydroxylase; FLS,
  flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase;
  LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase; and UFGT, UDP-Glc:flavonoid
  3-O-glucosyltransferase.'
