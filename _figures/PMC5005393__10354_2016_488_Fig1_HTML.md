caption: Demonstration of how gene ontology annotations lead to understanding of biological
  networks. The genes Slc27a, Lpl, Rxrg, Acadl, Cpt2, and Acadvl are differentially
  expressed in interneurons. All of them except Acadvl contribute to the peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway which is therefore assumed
  to be changed. Three of these genes, Acadl, Acadvl, and Cpt2 are also involved in
  fatty acid metabolism. The overlapping genes of the PPAR signaling pathway and fatty
  acid metabolism are Acadl and Cpt2. The number of direct connections can be used
  as an indicator how well connected—how important—a process or a pathway is. Using
  this existing knowledge in combination with experimental data, it is possible to
  analyze, visualize, and understand a network of changed processes
