caption: Gene regulatory network in three hybrid combinations. DGs in three hybrid
  combinations were used for direct interaction analysis by Pathway Studio 9.0. Interaction
  searching includes promoter binding, expression, regulation and binding. LHY, LATE
  ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL; PRR7, PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7; SVP, SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE;
  TIC, TIME FOR COFFEE; GI, GIGANTEA; ZTL, ZEITLUPE; APRR3, PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR

  PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1; TT4, TRANSPARENT TESTA 4. Black, dark green, navy refers to
  protein are encoded by DGs in LY2163, LY2186 and LYP9 respectively; dark magenta
  refers to protein are encoded by DGs in LY2163 and LYP9; orange refers to protein
  are encoded by DGs in LY2186 and LYP9; red refers to protein are encoded by DGs
  in LY2163, LY2186 and LYP9.
