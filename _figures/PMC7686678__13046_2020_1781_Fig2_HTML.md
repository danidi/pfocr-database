caption: Dexosome function. a Direct presentation of antigens by dexosomes to T cells
  (Antigens are not captured or processed by DC in this pathway). b Indirect presentation
  of antigens by dexosomes to T cells. Here, antigens are first captured and processed
  by DCs through the endocytic pathway and are subsequently cross-presented on DC
  surface to T cells. c Indirect antigen presentation to DCs through cross-dressing
  of DCs by dexosomes. d Indirect antigen presentation by dexosomes to DCs via tumor
  cells. Here, antigens, i.e. TAAs, are captured by tumor cells and then cross-presented
  to T cells
