caption: Diagram summarizing how cells ensure cholesterol homeostasis. Cells synthesize
  cholesterol from acetyl-CoA by a long series of enzymatic steps requiring energy
  and molecular oxygen. Intermediates of the pathway serve as precursors for other
  biologically active molecules. Highlighted enzymes are 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA
  reductase (HMGCR), which is rate-limiting for the mevalonate pathway and inhibited
  by statins, 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR24) and 7-dehydrocholesteol reductase
  (DHCR7), whose defects cause rare human diseases. Cells can take up cholesterol
  by receptor-mediated endocytosis of lipoproteins bearing apolipoproteins. In this
  pathway, Niemann-Pick Type C Protein 1 and NPC2 mediate cooperatively the exit of
  cholesterol out of the endosomal-lysosomal system and thereby allow for its incorporation
  into the intracellular pool. Defects in either protein cause the lysosomal storage
  disorder Niemann-Pick Type C. Overload by cholesterol is prevented by its intracellular
  esterification and subsequent storage in lipid droplets and by its release. Cholesterol
  is released either as a complex with apolipoprotein-containing lipoproteins via
  members of the ATP-binding cassette transporters or after conversion to oxysterols.
  Examplary proteins for each process are indicated. The relative contribution of
  each pathway to cholesterol homeostasis is probably cell type-specific. The post-lanosterol
  steps of cholesterol biosynthesis are divided into Bloch and Kandutsch–Russell pathways,
  which share enzymatic stages but produce C24 double-bond reduced cholesterol at
  different steps.
