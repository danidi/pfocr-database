caption: (A) An illustration of the striato-thalamocortical motor loop that is impaired
  in Parkinson’s disease (PD) due to dopamine depletion within the SNC of the basal
  ganglia (cross and dotted lines). (B) An illustration of The Compensation Hypothesis,
  which suggests recruitment of the cerebello-thalamocortical pathway that bypasses
  the BG (red lines). Alternatively, The Restoration Hypothesis suggests a facilitation
  effect on the striato-thalamocortical pathway, specifically facilitating dopaminergic
  function in the basal ganglia, (blue lines). M1, primary motor cortex; SMA, supplementary
  motor cortex; PMC, premotor cortex; PC, parietal cortex; SNC, substantia nigra pars
  compacta; GPe, external globus pallidus; GPi, internal globus pallidus; STN, subthalamic
  nucleus (adapted from Fujii and Wan, ).
