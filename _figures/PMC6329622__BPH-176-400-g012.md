caption: Nef has a protective effect on mitochondria through activation of the p62–Keap1–Nrf2
  pathway in cerebral ischaemia. Upon the onset of the ischaemic stroke, the mitochondria
  were damaged. Nef increased the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus through the
  activation of the p62–Keap1–Nrf2 pathway and further rescued mitochondria.
