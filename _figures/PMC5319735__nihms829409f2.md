caption: 'Intra- or extracellular signaling by CL is triggered by its externalization
  to the mitochondrial surface. Intracellular CL: In healthy cells, CL is exclusively
  localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) specifically on the inner leaflet
  of the IMM that faces the matrix. Damage to the mitochondria results in loss of
  this asymmetry and movement of the lipid to the outer leaflet of the IMM, to the
  inner leaflet of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and finally to the outer
  leaflet of the OMM. Additionally, oxidative stress results in peroxidation of oxidizable
  CL (having polyunsaturaed acyl chains) by cytochrome c, to produce CLox, which may
  also be presented at the mitochondrial surface as a damage signal. Once at the mitochondrial
  surface, CL in the presence of cytoplasmic LC3, signals clearance of the damaged
  organelle by mitophagy, thereby restoring intracellular homeostasis. Under pathological
  conditions, such as presence of intracellular pathogens or presence of intracellular
  pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), mitochondrial
  CL and/or CLox promotes activation of the NLRP3 dependent inflammasome pathway that
  directs cell death by pyroptosis. Extracellular CL: Mitochondria released following
  cell damage provide human CL (hCL) as a source of extracellular damage associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), which challenge host cells, including professional phagocytes.
  Similarly, infections challenge these cells with bacterial CL (bCL) and LPS. Both
  hCL and bCL signal engulfment of mitochondrial and bacterial membranes by professional
  phagocytes for subsequent degradation in lysosomes. hCL and bCL also interfere with
  binding of LPS to MD2, thereby attenuating Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 dependent
  inflammatory cytokine production. The attenuation of cytokine response and phagocytic
  clearance both contribute to restoration of homeostasis.'
