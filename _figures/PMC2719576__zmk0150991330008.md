caption: The exocytic signal conferred by PI signaling and regulation of the actin
  cytoskeleton. Sfh5, a nonclassical PITP, delivers PI to the PM via the (actin- and
  myosin-dependent) secretory pathway (1). Upon SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion at the
  PM (2), Sfh5 delivers PI to the PI 4-kinase and PI(4)P 5-kinase (e.g., Stt4 and
  Mss4) to generate PI(4,5)P2 (3). PI(4,5)P2 in turn regulates three activation paths
  that converge on the actin cytoskeleton and secretory pathway (4–6). One path consists
  of a Cdc42-dependent signaling pathway (4) that regulates polarity establishment
  and actin organization to perpetuate exocytosis until budding is completed. A second
  path involves the recruitment of the GEF for Rho proteins, Rom2, by PI(4,5)P2, resulting
  in activation of the Rho1 signaling pathway (5). Rho1 then activates Pkc1 to regulate
  a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade that leads to the up-regulation of genes
  involved in cell wall integrity, as well as actin organization. Finally, recent
  studies suggest that certain exocyst components (e.g., Sec3) interact with Rho family
  GTPases (e.g., Rho3) and are recruited to membranes in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner
  (6). This may control exocyst assembly at the site of exocytosis and facilitate
  secretion, among other possible functions (i.e., cortical ER delivery and anchoring).
  Alone, PI(4,5)P2-mediated Cdc42 and Rho activation should stabilize the polarized
  actin cytoskeleton and, in turn, maintain both integrity of secretory pathway and
  facilitate further Sfh5-mediated PI delivery to the cell surface.
