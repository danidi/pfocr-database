caption: Simplifed MAPK signaling. Receptor activation by growth factors or mitogens
  triggers a signal cascade in which mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinases
  (MAPKKK) are activated and in turn activate mitogen activated kinase kinases (MAPKK)
  and then the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), ERK, JNK, and P38. Evidence
  suggests that this pathway is upregulated in PD substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons,
  potentially contributing to cell death.
