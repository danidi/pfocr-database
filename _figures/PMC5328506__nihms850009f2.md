caption: '(Left) Apoptosis can be triggered via intrinsic or extrinsic pathways, including
  by natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) granzymes. These stimulate
  the cleavage of BID to tBID, which causes BAX and/or BAK to trigger mitochondrial
  outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in release of cytochrome C (CytC),
  which binds to apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1). APAF1 then oligomerizes
  into the apoptosome, the platform for caspase 9 activation. Either caspases 8 or
  9 will cleave the effector caspases 3 and 7 into their active forms, which leads
  to apoptosis. (Right) Necroptosis can be triggered by DNA-sensing via ZBP1, which
  activates receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) followed by phosphorylation
  of MLKL. Phosphorylated MLKL binds to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and
  forms the necroptotic pore–. (Center) In the more complex necroptotic pathway, tumour
  necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)–TRIF, or TLR4–TRIF
  signal via RIPK1 to activate NF-κb (but RIPK1 is not required for the TRIF-type
  I IFN response,). RIPK1 can be thought of as a finely balanced teeter-totter with
  two guards: caspase 8 on one side balanced by a duo of RIPK3 and ZBP1 on the other.
  When TNFR1–TLR3–TLR4 signalling proceed normally, RIPK1 is “balanced” and functions
  as a scaffolding protein that becomes poly-ubiquitinated, and serving as a platform
  for signalling complex assembly driving transcriptional responses. When signalling
  is inhibited, for example by inhibition of cIAP1/2 pharmacologic inhibitors (with
  SMAC mimetics), by inhibiting TAK1, by inhibition of protein synthesis, or by blocking
  RIPK1 ubiquitination , or potentially by virulence factors, RIPK1 becomes “unbalanced”.
  RIPK1 then recruits FADD (a DD-DED adaptor) via DD-DD interactions, and FADD recruits
  caspase 8 via DED-DED interaction thereby triggering extrinsic apoptosis–. Successful
  caspase 8 activation provides negative feedback to prevent necroptosis by cleaving
  RIPK1 and RIPK3 in the kinase domains,. However, inhibition of caspase-8 pharmacologically
  or by viral virulence factors permits continued RIPK1 kinase activity, and the teeter-totter
  swings the other direction. RIPK1 recruits RIPK3 via RHIM-RHIM interaction, and
  phosphorylates it, triggering RIPK3 kinase activity and necroptosis–. Thus, RIPK1,
  RIPK3, and caspase 8 act as a cross guard system for TNFR1, TLR3, and TLR4. TLRs
  such as TLR2 that do not signal through TRIF,,,, unless longer time points are examined
  where TLR2-driven TNF could require caspase 8 to cause paracrine TNFR1 stimulation.'
