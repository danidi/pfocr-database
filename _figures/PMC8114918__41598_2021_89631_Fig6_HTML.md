caption: Schematic figure showing the possible contribution of miR-506 to phenotypic
  presentation of colitis in patients with PSC + UC compared to those with UC alone.
  MicroRNA-506 expression was upregulated in ascending colons of patients with primary
  sclerosing cholangitis and concurrent ulcerative colitis (PSC + UC). This overexpression
  of miR-506 resulted in reduced expression of anion exchange protein 2 (AE2) and
  inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate-receptor (InsP3R3), which destabilized protection against
  toxic bile acids. The lack of sphingosine-kinase-1 (SPHK1) induction in the face
  of increased inflammation in this part of the colon, as well as the loss of sphingosine-1-phosphate
  lyase (SPL) activity, promoted neoplastic transformation via a p53-dependent pathway.
  In contrast, colonic suppression of miR-506 in both parts of UC patient colons,
  and in the sigmoid colons of PSC + UC patients, was accompanied by a substantial
  increase in SPHK1 expression. The enhanced levels of kinase SPHK1 resulted in upregulation
  of bioactive sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) which led to further activation of S1P-dependent
  signaling pathways. The net effect of these responses is severe inflammation. S1P
  is continuously and irreversibly degraded by the SPL enzyme, which is abundantly
  expressed in enterocytes, protecting from colitis-associated cancer.
