caption: AD-360°. This global view of AD pathogenesis includes both the amyloid-independent
  (green pathway) and amyloid-dependent (red pathway) mechanisms. The Aβ/amyloid-independent
  mechanisms are mediated via APP, intracellular fragments (i-CTFs) and PS1 via the
  cellular processes discussed here (green arrows) while the amyloid mechanisms are
  mediated via Aβ42 or Aβ oligomers or plaques (red arrows). Cdk5 (blue box) may be
  influenced by or interacts with both pathways and its activation triggers DNA damage,
  cell cycle activation and neurodegeneration (blue arrows). Non-APP/PS factors such
  as Tau and ApoE also contribute to AD pathology (blue and black arrows) and there
  is strong evidence to suggest that cellular processes such as inflammation, oxidative
  stress and Ca2+ dysregulation implicated in AD pathogenesis can be triggered by
  both amyloid-dependent and amyloid-independent mechanisms. All of these pathways
  can lead to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration and AD most likely results
  from the cumulative effects of multiple pathway.
