caption: Possible Aβ-dependent and Aβ-independent mechanisms of neurotoxicity. In
  this model, 1 route toward neurotoxicity begins with either APP mutations or PS1
  mutations (top center of figure). The pathway toward toxicity flows downward via
  elevated Aβ42 levels and elevated oligomer levels. An alternative pathway is shown
  on the right side of the figure, whereby superoxide (O2•–) or hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2) oxidize lipids such as prostaglandins, forming F2α-isoprostanes. Both H2O2
  and F2α-isoprostanes are known to accelerate Aβ aggregation and presumably its oligomerization.
  This author proposes that toxicity in this pathway occurs both directly from reactive
  oxygen species (H2O2 and O2•–) and via acceleration of Aβ oligomerization by these
  reactive oxygen species.
