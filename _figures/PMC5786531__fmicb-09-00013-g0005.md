caption: Model of regulatory mechanism for blaA induction in S. oneidensis. S. oneidensis
  possesses two pathways for blaA regulation. One is an AmpG-NagZ-dependent repressible
  pathway, which is also LT dependent. Another one is AmpG-NagZ-independent inducible
  pathway, which is dependent on PBP1a. PBP1a is responsive to the presence of antibiotics
  in the periplasm, impaired peptidoglycan production by PBP1a compromises cell envelope
  integrity, and then activates an unknown TCS, eventually results in expression of
  blaA in S. oneidensis. Moreover, it cannot be excluded that LTs inactivation disturbs
  peptidoglycan homeostasis, which is then monitored an unknown TCS to induce the
  expression of blaA.
