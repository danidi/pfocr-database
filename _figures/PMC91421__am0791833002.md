caption: EMP pathway for glucose decomposition and production of acetate, propionate,
  and butyrate from pyruvate. The numbers of the C atoms of glucose that are found
  in the various C atoms of products formed by the pathway are indicated, as are the
  carbons of propionate that are formed from carbon dioxide (indicated by asterisks).
  Details of the enzyme reactions between glucose and pyruvate and between pyruvate
  and acetate, propionate, and butyrate are not shown. For details of enzyme reactions
  between glucose and pyruvate and between pyruvate and acetate, propionate, and butyrate,
  see reference .
