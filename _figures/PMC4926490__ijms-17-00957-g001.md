caption: An illustration of the genesis of exosomal aquaporin-2 (AQP2) in renal collecting
  duct principal cells. Activation of the V2 receptor (V2R) by vasopressin (AVP) released
  from the posterior pituitary stimulates adenylate cyclase (AC), resulting in an
  increase of cAMP, thereby activating protein kinase A (PKA). This protein kinase
  phosphorylates AQP2, thus increasing the expression of AQP2 in the apical membrane
  through a vesicular trafficking mechanism. The PKA also phosphorylates CRE binding
  protein (CREB), and this phosphorylated protein enhances transcription of the AQP2
  gene, leading to an increase in the synthesis of AQP2 protein. When apical AQP2
  is ubiquitinated, the ubiquitinated AQP2 is endocytosed. Endosomal sorting complex
  required for transport (ESCRT)-0 then captures the ubiquitinated AQP2, and this
  interaction activates the sequential reactions mediated by ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and
  ESCRT-III. Finally, the endosomal membrane is excised from the endosome membrane
  through the action of ESCRT III and vacuolar protein sorting 4 (VPS4), thus generating
  multivesicular bodies (MVBs) including intraluminal vesicles. Once the MVBs fuse
  with the plasma membrane, the intraluminal vesicles are released as exosomes into
  the extracellular space. A recent paper has also suggested that an endocytotic pathway
  for exosomes is stimulated by activation of the V2 receptor in renal collecting
  duct principal cells [].
