caption: 'Owing to their lipophilic, detergent properties, bile acids can directly
  disrupt the plasma membrane and cause activation of PKC which in turn activates
  the p38 MAPK pathway. The resultant activation of p53 and NF-κB lead to induction
  of apoptosis and increased inflammation. Activated NF-κB translocates to the nucleus
  and promotes transcription of genes that encode pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6, which can positively regulate NF-κB activation and thus
  promote a continued cycle of inflammation. IL-6 also activates the Janus Kinase
  (JAK)–Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway which leads
  to decreased apoptosis and progression of HCC. IL-1β also activates the PI3K–MDM2
  pathway to negatively regulate p53, thus increasing survival of DNA damaged cells
  which might lead to HCC. The NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer has also been shown to bind
  directly to the promoter of FXR and inhibits its transcription, resulting in: reduced
  expression of bile acid transporters such as OSTα/β, BSEP, MRP2, MDR2/3 which leads
  to decreased bile acid efflux and cholestasis and increased biosynthesis of bile
  acids. Inhibition of FXR transcription collectively leads to increased amounts of
  bile acids in the liver which causes inflammation that can lead to HCC. Membrane
  perturbation by bile acids can also activate PLA2 which causes release of arachidonic
  acid (AA) from the cell membrane via cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX),
  ultimately resulting in increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the
  hepatocyte,. ROS can directly activate NF-κB and can also induce direct DNA damage
  in cells which might lead to HCC.PKC, protein kinase C; MAPK, mitogen-activated
