caption: High rates of cholesterol efflux through cholesterol transporters ABCA1 and
  ABCG1, such as those observed in macrophage derived foam cells can deplete cellular
  ATP stores. In response to ATP depletion AMPK becomes activated initiating a number
  of cellular changes necessary to restore cellular energetic balance. One of these
  changes involves the activation of PGC1α and stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.
  This results in numerous improvements in mitochondrial function including increased
  respiration capacity and ATP production thus restoring cellular energy stores necessary
  for continued removal of intracellular cholesterol. In the present study, Karunakaran
  and colleagues demonstrate that miR-33 plays an important role in regulation of
  mitochondrial biogenesis and function through targeting of PGC1α and other mitochondrial
  genes. Together with earlier work these findings demonstrate the central role of
  miR-33 in regulating this energetic pathway by direct repression of ABCA1 and ABCG1
  (only in rodents) as well as targeting critical genes involved in cellular energy
  sensing (AMPK), mitochondrial biogenesis, and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation
  (CROT, CPT1a, HADHB). This figure was prepared using the Servier Medical Art resources
