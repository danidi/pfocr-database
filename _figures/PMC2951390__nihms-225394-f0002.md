caption: 'Nitrate and other N sources produced by nitrate reduction by the nitrate
  assimilatory pathway are able to act as signals that regulate molecular processes
  and pathways (purple rounded rectangles) leading to regulation of developmental
  processes (green rounded rectangles). The arrow heads or lines at the end of the
  edges indicate the direction of information or metabolic flow. 2-OG: 2-oxoglutarate;

  synthase; IPT3: Isopentenyl transferase 3; NRTs : Nitrate transporters; NIA : Nitrate
  reductase; NiR: Nitrite reductase. See the text for more details.'
