caption: Current model for the Apobec3-dependent NAb response. (Left) In Rfv3 resistant
  mice, higher levels of the B6 Apobec3 gene results in the release of noninfectious
  particles that stimulate GC B cells via the TLR7-Myd88 pathway, resulting in a strong
  NAb response. (Right) In Rfv3 susceptible mice, released infectious particles result
  in virus replication and immune dysfunction, resulting in a weaker NAb response.
  Note that during acute infection, similar numbers of FV particles are released independent
  of B6 Apobec3 activity. Not shown are the infection of other cell types, particularly
  erythroblasts, myeloid cells and T cells which could all contribute to humoral immune
  dysfunction in Apobec3/Rfv3 susceptible mice
