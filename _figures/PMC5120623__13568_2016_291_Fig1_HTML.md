caption: Biosynthesis of PHA in E. coli LSBJ utilizing short-chain-length (SCL) and
  medium-chain-length (MCL) fatty acids. The absence of fadB and fadJ in E. coli LSBJ
  in combination with the plasmid-borne recombinant enzymes PhaC1(STQK) and PhaJ4
  establishes a linear pathway for the production of PHA polymers from free fatty
  acids. Extracellular fatty acids are transported across the outer membrane dependent
  on size; SCL and shorter MCL fatty acids can diffuse across the outer membrane,
  while longer MCL fatty acids can be transported by the long-chain fatty acid transporter
  FadL (Lepore et al. ). Inner membrane transport and activation is accomplished by
  the SCL-specific Ato system (AtoEAD) or the MCL-specific acyl-CoA synthetase FadD
  (Kameda and Nunn ; Theodorou et al. ). Acyl-CoA substrates are converted into enoyl-CoA
  by the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme FadE (Campbell and Cronan ), and are unable
  to proceed further through β-oxidation due to the absence of FadB and FadJ. The
  enoyl-CoA pool is then converted to (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA by the R-specific enoyl-CoA
  hydratase PhaJ4 (Tsuge et al. ), and finally polymerized by the PHA synthase PhaC1(STQK)
  (Takase et al. , ). This system allows for the biosynthesis of PHA polymers with
  tightly controlled repeating unit composition, as the number of carbons present
  in the fatty acid substrate is retained as the total number of carbons in each repeating
  unit
