caption: Transforming growth factor beta signaling pathway TGFβ1 latent proteins are
  present in 2 forms; a small complex consists of TGF-β noncovalently associated with
  a latency-associated protein (LAP) and a large latent complex in which LAP is linked
  to latent TGF-β-binding proteins (LTBPs). Integrins, plasmin and thrombospondin
  1 (TSP-1) convert the inactive latent complex to the active form by releasing it
  from LTBP and LAP. The active TGF-β I binds to the type II receptor (TRII) which
  then recruits, transphosphorylates and binds the type I receptor (TRI). The activated
  TRI phosphorylates the transcription factors R-Smads (Smad 2/3) which then bind
  to the common Smad 4. R-Smad/Co-Smad complexes translocate to the nucleus, where
  they associate with DNA-binding partners and then regulate the transcriptional response
  of the TGF- β target genes. Inhibitory Smad 6 and 7 repress TGF-β responses.
