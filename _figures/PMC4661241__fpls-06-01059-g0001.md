caption: A diagram of the ethylene’s role in plant under salinity. Under salinity,
  stress signals could activate the MAPK phosphorylation cascades which then stabilize
  some ACSs to promote ethylene production. The transcripts level of ACSs and ACOs
  are also up-regulated under salinity. Then, salinity-induced ethylene signal is
  transduced mainly through the classical receptors-CTR1-EIN2-EIN3 pathway to regulate
  many effectors involved in plant growth and salinity response. Under proper concentration,
  ethylene promotes the homeostasis of Na+/K+, nutrients and ROS to enhance plant
  tolerance to salinity, with no irreversible inhibition of normal growth, while excessive
  ethylene will lead to harmful hyper-inhibition of plant growth. To avoid damage
  from extreme ethylene response, plants have evolved some negative feed-back mechanisms
  to alleviate ethylene response and promote seedling growth. In these mechanisms,
  some small proteins such as NtTCTP, NEIP2, AtSAURs, and AtARGOS are supposed to
  act as key modulators to coordinate plant growth and ethylene/salinity responses.
