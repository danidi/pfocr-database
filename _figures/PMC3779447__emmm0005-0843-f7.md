caption: Flow restriction upon occlusion of a main arterial route results in downstream
  ischaemia and increases the shear forces on the vessel wall of upstream, preformed
  collateral vessels, inducing the release of different cytokines and chemokines (black
  triangles). Chemoattractant cues such as CCL2 (MCP1) and/or vessel permeability
  molecules, including ANG2 (white circles), promote − directly or indirectly − macrophage
  recruitment to the immature collaterals. Subsequently, ANG1 (black circles) induces
  transcriptional downregulation of Phd2, activating the NF-κB pathway. In turn, NF-κB
  upregulates Tie2 in a feed-forward loop where TIE2 receptor is functionally required
  to sustain the in situ programming of macrophages towards a proarteriogenic, M2-like
  phenotype. TEMs are then required to promote the maturation of collateral vessels
  (arteriogenesis).
