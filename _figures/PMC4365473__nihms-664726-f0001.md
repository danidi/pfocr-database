caption: This model shows an interrelation of pathological hallmarks in sporadic inclusion
  body myositis (sIBM) including vacuoles, muscle atrophy, degeneration, accumulation
  of protein aggregates, and inflammation (shown in boxes). The consequences of aging
  (circled as the ‘initiating’ factor) include reactive oxygen species (ROS) and accumulation
  of ubiquitinated protein aggregates, degenerating mitochondria, and other macromolecules.
  In this model, these accumulations are both directly toxic to myofibers and also
  induce inflammation via induction of NF-κB. Protein aggregates are normally degraded
  via the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy, both of which are induced
  by the transcription factor FOXO. Growth factors such as IGF-1 stimulate protein
  synthesis and inhibit autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/TOR pathway to enable muscle growth.
  Disruption of autophagolysosome degradation may lead to accumulation of these structures
  as ‘rimmed vacuoles’ in sIBM patients. Thus, autophagy may be tightly regulated
  in muscle cells such that it is induced during cellular stress to allow degradation
  of toxic aggregates and inhibited during cell growth to allow synthesis of structural
  proteins.
