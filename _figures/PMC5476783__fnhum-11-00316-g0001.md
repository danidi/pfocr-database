caption: Scheme for the relationship among stress, inflammation and stress-related
  diseases. (A) Stress, including psychosocial, material, patho/physiological stressors,
  induces chronic CNS and peripheral inflammation, which is then related to stress-related
  diseases. (B) Stress-induced chronic low-grade inflammation might be the common
  soil of stress-related diseases. Multifactorial factors, including genetic predisposition,
  aging and life style and so on, act on stress-related diseases. Stress-induced inflammatory
  response represents the common soil of a wide variety of the chronic multifactorial
  diseases.
