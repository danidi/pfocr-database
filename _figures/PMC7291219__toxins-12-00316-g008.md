caption: VT-1-induced ER stress triggers apoptotic or survival pathways in Burkitt
  lymphoma cells. We showed previously that the signal transduction pathway induced
  by VT-1 in BL cells is a relatively conventional caspase- and mitochondria-dependent
  pathway [,,]. Here, we report that treating cells with VT-1 induces the ER stress
  response by activation of the ER stress sensors IRE1 and ATF6, followed by increased
  expression of the transcription factor CHOP. Interestingly, we observed differential
  roles for CHOP, which appears to be part of the VT-1-induced apoptotic pathway in
  BL2 cells, whereas it is not implicated in the death process of Ramos cells. On
  the contrary, ER-phagy which occurred in these cells restrained VT-1-induced apoptosis.
  The role of CHOP in Ramos cells and the pathway (ATF6 or/and IRE1) involved in triggering
  ER-phagy are still not known. Dashed lines indicate possible mechanisms, solid lines
  indicate demonstrated effects.
