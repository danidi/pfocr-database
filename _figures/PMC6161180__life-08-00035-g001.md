caption: The proposed virtuous circle sketched here over a backdrop of a putative
  submarine green rust-mackinawite-greigite mound is intended to identify envisioned
  reactions demonstrated, or yet to be investigated in the lab—steps toward the first
  ligand-accelerated autocatalytic cycle (numbered reactions are specified in ). It
  models denitrifying methanotrophic acetogenesis as the proposed pathway to the emergence
  of life in a submarine alkaline hydrothermal mound [,]. This model was conceived
  partly as a response to the generally trivial and intermittent yields of methane
  in our hydrothermal experiments []. Note, given the high kinetic barrier to the
  reduction of carbon dioxide, a short cut to formate may have been initially offered
  by the serpentinization reaction []. As the main drivers to the overall process
  are the pH and redox vectors (likely involving molybdenum as an electron bifurcator)
  operating across the inorganic membrane, we predict that green rust will prove to
  act as a general redox and pH disequilibria-converting engine in, and comprising,
  the membrane, supported by FeNi-sulfide catalysis and electron transfer [,,,,,,,,,,,,,].
  The conditions responsible for these putative steps were probably localized somewhere
  on the margins of the mound and are only separated on this sketch for clarity.
