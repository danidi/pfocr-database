caption: Antitumoral effects of mevalonate (MVA) pathway inhibition. The inhibition
  of MVA pathway triggers a series of anticancer events that get to inhibit tumor
  growth and progression. These include the reduction of MVA synthesis, which in turn
  decreases the levels of downstream products (isoprenoids) and therefore prevents
  protein prenylation; the reduction in the translocation of small GTPases such as
  Rho and Ras to the cell membrane; and the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. All
  these inhibitory actions suggest that targeting the MVA pathway could represent
  a key mechanism to prevent cancer progression.
