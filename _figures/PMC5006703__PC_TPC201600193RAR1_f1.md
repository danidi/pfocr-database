caption: Proposed Pathway for Camptothecin Biosynthesis in C. acuminata.Camptothecin
  (12) is synthesized from the central precursor strictosidinic acid (5) derived from
  condensation of tryptamine (4) and the iridoid secologanic acid (3), a monoterpenoid
  glycoside. In vivo labeling experiments with deuterated [α,α,β,β-d4]-tryptamine
  resulted in labeling of strictosidinic acid and downstream metabolites with the
  number and the likely positions of deuterium (D) indicated in red. Enzyme activities
  are indicated. TDC1 and CYC1 were identified and characterized in this study. 7-DLS,
  7-deoxyloganetic acid synthase; 7-DLGT, 7-deoxyloganetic acid glucosyltransferase;
  7-DLH, 7-deoxyloganic acid hydroxylase; SLAS, secologanic acid synthase; STRAS,
  strictosidinic acid synthase; DH, dehydration; RD, reduction.
