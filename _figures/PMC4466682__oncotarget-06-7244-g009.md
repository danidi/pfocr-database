caption: In summary, we have identified a signaling pathway that is implicated in
  EGF-induced gastric cancer cell EMT. EGF treatment can lead to the activation of
  the Arf6/ERK cascade in gastric cancer cells and contribute to P-ERK binding to
  Wnt5a promoter region, thereby suppressing Wnt5a expression at transcriptional level,
  and low Wnt5a protein expression allows EGF to induce EMT in gastric cancer cells.
