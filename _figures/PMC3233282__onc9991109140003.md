caption: 'Abiraterone acetate mode of action and chemical structure. (A): The cytochrome
  P450 enzyme CYP17 and steroids. Androgen biosynthesis pathway. The physiological
  effects of abiraterone acetate on steroidogenesis are indicated by arrows next to
  each steroid precursor. Abiraterone acetate inhibits 17α-hydroxylase (blunt arrow),
  causing a decline in serum cortisol and a consequent rise in adrenocorticotrophic
  hormone (ACTH) (broken arrow). This, in turn, results in a rise in deoxycorticosterone
  and corticosterone by approximately 10- and 40-fold, respectively. The elevated
  deoxycorticosterone levels result in the expected toxicities of secondary mineralocorticoid
  syndrome. Abiraterone acetate also inhibits C17,20-lyase (blunt arrow), resulting
  in significant declines in dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione, and testosterone.
  Aldosterone levels fall as a result of suppression of the renin–angiotensin pathway
  by high levels of deoxycorticosterone. However, there is a fourfold increase in
  11-deoxycortisol, which may be a result of the higher ACTH levels driving the partial
  reversal of the activity of 17α-hydroxylase but not C17,20-lyase. (B): Chemical
