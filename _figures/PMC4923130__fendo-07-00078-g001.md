caption: Glucocorticoid-mediated modulation of pro-inflammatory pathways. (A) LPS
  binds to TLR4 and activates the MAP kinase pathway, activating NFκB and increasing
  the gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6). Elevated
  and prolonged GC exposure increases and potentiates the pro-inflammatory response
  related to MAP kinase–NFκB pathway. (B) GR activation regulates the gene and protein
  expression of TLR2, which recognizes PAMPS. This event recruits intracellular proteins,
  ultimately leading to the downstream signaling activation of NFκB, increasing the
  expression of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β. (C) GR activation
  regulates the gene and protein expression of NLRP3, which recognizes DAMPS and regulates
  the immune system response in a mechanism similar to the proposed in (B). Schematic
  figures based on Ref. (, ).
