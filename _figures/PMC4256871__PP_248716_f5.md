caption: 'Spring-embedded network linking s and promoters via their interactions.
  A network of promoter to  interactions as generated using a spring-embedded approach
  is shown. This approach leads to s or promoters with more interactions being present
  in the center of the diagram and less connected ones being more distal. Only promoters
  or s showing three or more interactions were included in the analysis, and the Ward
  algorithm was used for clustering. s chosen to validate in mutant analysis are shown
  in dark gray, whereas the other s are in light gray. Purple shows s that are known
  and validated to control aliphatic  accumulation. Circles show genes present only
  as the , squares are genes present only as promoters, and diamonds are present as
  both a  and promoter. The promoters are color coded as shown in  based on their
  pathway membership as follows: indolic s are pink, aliphatic regulatory genes are
  purple, and aliphatic peripheral genes are red. The aliphatic biosynthetic genes
  are parsed into the core pathway (green), elongation (blue), modifying (yellow),
  and seed specific (orange) to visualize regulation along the linear model of the
  pathway. s that validated by mutant analysis are shown in gray with the intensity
  showing the fraction of aliphatic  phenotypes that validated from light gray to
  dark gray. s with a black N are those that were tested but had no significant phenotypic
  effect on  accumulation.'
