caption: 'Functional annotation of 115 C/EBPβ target genes presented in pie chart
  format shows that 74% of target genes are dedicated to signaling, metabolism, and
  transport, with the remaining 26% having roles in transcription, synaptic transmission,
  differentiation and proliferation. Included in signaling and transport categories
  are multiple members of two gene families, the olfactory receptor genes and solute
  carrier genes. Fifty-four percent of these target genes are expressed in the brain,
  including GABAA receptor subunit beta, myelin transcription factor 1 involved in
  oligodendrocyte development, the clinically important alpha-synuclein and amyloid
  precursor protein beta, the calcium-dependent α-latrotoxin receptor neurexin 1,
  the nociceptin receptor opioid receptor like- 1, the signaling protein phospholipase
  C beta, the synaptic vesicle protein 2b and the netrin- 1 receptor Unc5 involved
  in axon guidance. B) Pathway analysis of C/EBPβ and its target genes was performed
  using a web- based entry tool, the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Network Generation.
  The central role played by C/EBPβ in one signaling network shows the interaction
  of C/EBPβ with 23 proteins. C/EBPβ and the transcription factors CREB and NFkB are
  found at the center of this network and are surrounded by the protein kinases PI3K,
  Akt, Lyn and Cdc42 as well as proteins that signal to these kinases, including calmodulin,
  the small GTPases Ras and Rac and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav. Acting
  on these pathways are the first messengers Pdgf, Egfr, thrombospondin (Cd47), growth
  hormone releasing hormone, netrin- 1 and glutamate (Grm7). Based upon SACO analysis,
  the direct transcriptional control of 15 of these proteins by C/EBPβ has been added
  to this network. The addition of these transcriptional control points results in
  a network where multiple signaling pathways modify C/EBPβ function, either directly
  by phosphorylation or indirectly through CREB and NFkB effects on C/EBPβ gene expression,
  while at the same time C/EBPβ feeds back to regulate expression of these same signaling
  proteins. Abbreviations: ABI1, abl-interactor 1, Akt, thymoma viral proto- oncogene,
  BRAC1, breast cancer 1, CABIN1, calcineurin binding protein 1, Calmodulin, CD47,
