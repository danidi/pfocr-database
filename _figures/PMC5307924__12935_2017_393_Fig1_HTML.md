caption: Negative-feedback mechanism of ROS-induced Wnt/β-catenin signal in cancer
  stem-like cells. The exposure to oxidative stress activates Wnt pathway and up-regulates
  both CD44 and c-Myc (blue cells). CD44v8-10 stabilizes xCT (cystine/glutamate antiporter)
  and provides CSCs cystine, the rate-limiting substrate of glutathione synthesis.
  The decreased ROS level due to CD44v-xCT axis influences on ROS-induced Wnt signal
  in a negative-feedback manner (red cells). Both blue and red cells belong to CSCs,
  but c-Myc expression level is different each other, which makes the invasive CSCs
  population quite heterogeneous in terms of cell cycle and proliferation. Although
  the precise molecular machineries regulated by Fbw7 remain to be unknown, CD44v8-10
  and c-Myc tend to exhibit the inversed expression pattern at the invasive front
  where heterogeneous CSCs are enriched
