caption: a) Digrammatic representation of follicle growth from the non-proliferating
  pool of primordial follicles. Primordial follicles are continuously activated into
  the growing population where they become primary follicles consisting of an oocye
  arrested at the dictyate stage of prophaseI of meiosis (yellow) surrounded by granulosa
  cells (green). Primary follicles undergo oocyte growth and granulosa cell proliferation
  and differentiation (purple) when they form an antral cavity. Antral follicles continue
  to grow and granulosa cells differentiate into two sub-populations of cells 1) cumulus
  surrounding the oocyte (blue) and 2) mural lining the wall of the follicle (orange).
  Exact timings for this developmental sequence to occur in humans are not known but
  estimations suggest several months, however, it is not known whether the growth
  profile is continuous or whether there are “resting” phases through follicle development.b)
  Simplified version of the PI3K pathwayThe factors initiating this process are largely
  unknown but a body of evidence is emerging to show that the phosphatidylinositol-3’-kinase
  (PI3K-AKT) signalling pathway is a major regulator of early follicle/oocyte development
  and that components of this pathway are involved in controlling the rate of activation
  from the non-growing population of follicles. The phosphatase PTEN converts PIP3
  to PIP2, which negatively regulates PI3K activity. Signaling mediated by PI3Ks converge
  at PDK1. PDK1 phosphorylates Akt and activates it. Akt can phosphorylate and inactivate
  tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2, or tuberin), which leads to the activation of
  mTOR complex (mTORC1). mTORC1 can phosphorylate (activate) S6K1. S6K1 subsequently
  phosphorylates and activates rpS6, which enhances protein translation that is needed
  for cell growth. mTORC1 can be inhibited pharmacologically with Rapamycin and stimulated
  by leucine. The manipulation of this pathway could have important clinical applications
  in the field of fertility preservation.
