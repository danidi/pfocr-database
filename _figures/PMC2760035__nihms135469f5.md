caption: 'A) Interactions between neighboring cells in a growing epithelium allow
  mutual assessment of metabolic state. If no metabolic difference is detected between
  neighboring cells, all cells survive and reproduce to populate the tissue. Detection
  of a metabolic difference between neighboring cells leads to competition: the relatively
  more robust state of ‘winner’ cells (blue) gives them a growth advantage, but signals
  exchanged between the populations lead to death of their relatively less robust
  neighbors (‘loser’ cells, orange)B) A model of cell competition. We postulate that
  cells continually monitor their own metabolic state (effectively a measure of ribosome
  function) and that of their neighbors. This mutual sensing may be through the production
  of soluble factors by both cells that report ribosome function. Cells with lower
  levels of dMyc or Rp have reduced ribosome function (“losers”) and are sensed by
  neighbor cells with higher dMyc or Rp levels and thus higher ribosome function (“winners”).
  Winner cells relay a death signal to loser cells, which respond by activating the
  JNK stress pathway, induce expression of the proapoptotic factor Hid, and commit
  suicide. Winner cells are protected from these death signals by an unknown mechanism.
  Winner cells are stimulated to proliferate more in response to signals produced
  by dying loser cells (green arrow). The extracellular factors produced during cell
  competition can diffuse across the epithelium and modulate growth and cell survival
  decisions up to 10 cell diameters from the competitive boundary (A). Although JNK
  activity is induced in loser cells, it is not required for their death.'
