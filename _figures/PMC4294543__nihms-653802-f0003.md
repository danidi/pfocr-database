caption: Notch signaling pathway and inhibitors. The Notch signaling pathway has been
  implicated in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) carcino-genesis. Enhanced expression of NICD
  occurs in CCA. Several inhibitors of the Notch pathway are currently in development.
  These include inhibitors of γ-secretase, a key enzyme in the Notch pathway, as well
  as monoclonal antibodies (mABs) targeting the Notch receptors and ligands.
