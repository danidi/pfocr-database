caption: Schematic of the biological nitrogen cycle. Arrows are labeled with the pathway
  to which they belong. All genes examined in this study are labeled next to the step
  they catalyze. Genes without sufficient data for subsequent analysis are labeled
  in gray. Adapted from Canfield et al. ()
