caption: DNA damage caused by cisplatin activates a signaling pathway in which TAp63
  plays a key regulatory role, with downstream transcriptional induction of Puma,
  resulting ultimately in the unleashing of the apoptosis effectors BAX and BAK. Cyclophosphamide-induced
  DNA damage activates an alternate signaling pathway that does not require TAp63;
  possible mediators are FOXO3a and/or p53. Solid arrows denote known pathways. Dashed
  arrows denote possible alternative pathways (not yet characterized)
