caption: 'The sphingolipid metabolic network. A: Schematic representation of the sphingolipid
  metabolic pathway. Note that the degradative enzymes for sphingosine kinase, the
  specific sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatases SPP1/2 and the sphingosine-1-phosphate
  lyase are intrinsic membrane proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum. Similarly, the
  enzymes for ceramide biosynthesis, serine palmitoyl transferase, 3-keto sphingosine
  reductase, and the ceramide synthases, are intrinsic membrane enzymes of the endoplasmic
  reticulum; B: Structures of lipids in the sphingosine and ceramide biosynthetic
  pathway. Note that sphingosine is initially produced by the hydrolysis of ceramide
  by ceramidases. Dihydroceramide is directly produced by the de novo biosynthetic
  pathway of ceramide biosynthesis. Modified from Siow et al[], 2010.'
