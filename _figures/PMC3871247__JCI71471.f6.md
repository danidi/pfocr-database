caption: Modulation of cytoskeleton assembly is required for the coordination of cell
  adhesion, polarization and migration. The active form of RhoA (RhoA-GTP) activates
  ROCK and interacts with the integrin intracellular signaling pathway. RhoA also
  modulates cytoskeleton reorganization via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation
  and front-rear polarity via phosphorylation of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN).
  Phosphorylation of ROCK’s downstream effector MLC is required for the assembly of
  actomyosin complexes. ROCK downregulates the MLC phosphatase (MLCPase), resulting
  in an increase in phosphorylated MLC, cell contraction, actin organization, stress
  fiber formation, and focal adhesions, which confer contractility and migration properties
  to the cell. Phosphorylation of ROCK’s downstream effector ERM has a role in microvilli
  formation. Phosphorylated LIM domain kinase (LIM-K) phosphorylates and thus deactivates
  the actin-depolymerizing protein cofilin. Y-27632 blocks Rho-induced actomyosin
  activation. These data support a role for TTC7A in the downregulation of ROCK activity.
  Activation and inactivation are shown as arrowheads and blunted lines, respectively.
  MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; NHE1, Na+/H+ exchange protein.
