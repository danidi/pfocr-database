caption: Innate immune modulation of CTL response to LCMV through MyD88 signaling.
  MyD88 mediates recognition of LCMV by TLR7/TLR9 and possibly other, unknown receptors
  via pDCs. Type I IFNs produced by infected pDCs result in activation and clonal
  expansion of virus-specific CTLs. In an alternative pathway, CTLs are activated
  by proinflammatory cytokines in an MyD88-dependent manner. Activated CTLs mount
  effector functions that finally contribute to virus elimination.
