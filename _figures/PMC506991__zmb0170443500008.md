caption: Action of SHP on negative feedback regulation of CYP7A1 in bile acid signaling.
  Bile acid-induced SHP interacts with the mSin3A/Swi/Snf-Brm complex in cells and
  recruits the complex to the endogenous human CYP7A1 promoter (A), which results
  in chromatin remodeling at the promoter chromatin (B). (A) Bile acid treatment also
  causes dissociation of the p300/CBP/SRC-1 coactivator HAT complex from the promoter.
  (B) Recruitment of mSin3A/HDAC-1 and dissociation of HATs lead to histone deacetylation
  at the promoter. Bile acid-induced chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation
  both contribute to transcriptional repression after bile acid treatment. (A) The
  bile acid-activated JNK or ligand-activated PXR (SXR) pathway may contribute to
  bile acid-mediated CYP7A1 repression independent of the SHP pathway, but the details
  of the mechanisms are not known, so they are indicated with dashed lines.
