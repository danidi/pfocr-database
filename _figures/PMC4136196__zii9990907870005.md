caption: Coinfection of Filifactor alocis with P. gingivalis showing downregulation
  of proteins involved in gene expression and protein synthesis pathways. HeLa cells
  were infected with the F. alocis ATCC 35896 and D-62D strains (MOI of 1:100 [105
  epithelial cells]) in monoculture or coculture with P. gingivalis strains as previously
  reported (). Tandem isobaric mass tagging analysis of cocultures and monocultures
  was carried out using Orbitrap. The eukaryotic proteins were analyzed using MASCOT,
  and functional analysis was carried out using Ingenuity pathway analysis software.
  The gene ontology classification was used for referencing the proteome. F. alocis
  coinfection with P. gingivalis showed overall downregulation of histone cluster
  proteins (histone [Hist] H1, Hist 1H1B, Hist 1H1C, and Hist 1H1E) (shown within
  the circle), peptidyl prolyl isomerase (PPIA and PPIB), and antioxidant enzymes
  (PRDX1 and PRDX5). Green, downregulation; red, upregulation; solid lines, direct
  interaction; dotted lines, indirect interaction.
