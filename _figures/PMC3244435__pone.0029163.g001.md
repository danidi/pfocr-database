caption: Azathioprine (AZA) is a prodrug of mercaptopurine (MP). Thioguanine (TG)
  and MP can be converted by hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) to thioguanine
  nucleotide (TGNs) metabolites. MP can also be converted to the methylthioinosine
  monophosphate (meTIMP) by thiopurine methyltransferase (Tpmt) which inhibits purine
  synthesis; however, thioguanine bypasses the conversion to this metabolite. Thiopurines
  can be converted to inactive metabolites [i.e. methyl-mercaptopurine (meMP); methyl-thioguanine
  (meTG); and methyl-thioguanine nucleotides (meTGNs)] by Tpmt. TGN metabolites are
  incorporated into DNA and RNA leading to cell death. However, DNA incorporation
  is believed to be the primary mode of cytotoxicty.
