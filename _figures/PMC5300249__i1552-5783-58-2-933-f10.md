caption: Proposed novel signaling pathway in the development of diabetic retinopathy.
  During diabetes, leaked glycated proteins initiate the inflammatory cascade of DR
  through activation of ADA2 in macrophages and production of soluble inflammatory
  cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6, which activate leukocyte adhesion to retinal endothelial
  cells and finally leads to disruption of tight junction proteins and breakdown of
  the BRB. MicroRNA-146b-3p might be able to inhibit the production of inflammatory
  cytokines from macrophages through inhibition of ADA2 and subsequently might protect
  BRB. This signaling pathway suggests ADA2 as a potential therapeutic target to prevent
  or at least minimize the microvascular dysfunction in DR.
