caption: PDAC comprises of complex interactions between T cells, B cells, APCs, pancreatic
  tumor cells, and stromal elements. These interactions result in a profoundly immunosuppressive
  tumor microenvironment, and consequently single agent immunotherapy has been largely
  ineffective. However, emerging preclinical data has suggested that combination therapy
  may dramatically affect overall survival. Current trial design is being driven largely
  by this data. The figure summarizes major pathways in PDAC tumorigenesis that are
  being manipulated in clinical trials for patients with metastatic PDAC. Except for
  (G.), which represents in part IDO activated Tregs in TDLNs from a melanoma model
  (), this figure represents data known exclusively from PDAC models.(A.) Tregs and
  γδ T cells block Teff division and drive PDAC growth, while γδ T cells block T cell
  infiltration ().(B.) MDSCs and macrophages are mobilized into the TME by PDAC derived
  GM-CSF and CCL2, respectively. (,,).(C.) Macrophages block CD4+ T cell entry into
  the PDAC microenvironment. CD40 is expressed on these CD4+ T cells, and activation
  of the CD40 pathway concurrently with gemcitabine can drive T cell infiltration
  ().(D.) Stromal associated fibroblasts produce CXCL13, which recruits regulatory
  B cells into the TME. These regulatory B cells produce IL-35, which drives PDAC
  progression (,). These Bregs may be inhibited by BTK inhibitors, such as ibrutinib
  ().(E.) Tumor infiltrating macrophages stimulate PDAC progression. Blockade of the
  CSF1 receptor expressed by macrophages can lead to macrophage depletion, CTLA-4
  upregulation on CD8+ T cells, and PD-L1 upregulation on pancreatic tumor cells (,).(F.)
  Stromal elements create a physical barrier to immune infiltration and therapeutic
  agents. Stromal fibroblasts block Treg accumulation and PDAC progression (), but
  targeting other stromal elements have achieved encouraging results. Stromal hyaluronic
  acid deposition results in decreased vascular patency (,), and FAK1 drives stromal
  fibrosis (). Inhibition of either target has led to decreased PDAC progression when
  combined with chemotherapy in preclinical models.(G.) IDO induction in DCs by tumors
  activate Tregs via MHC and CTLA4 pathways (,). In phase II studies, gemcitabine
  based therapy synergizes with IDO inhibition to improve response rates in PDAC (),
  possibly via transient depletion of Tregs (). This provides an immune system reset,
  allowing for chemotherapy-mediated elimination of previously activated Tregs, followed
  by indoximod mediated inhibition of subsequent Treg activation.(H.) Recent evidence
  suggests the Fusobacterium found within the PDAC microenvironment drives PDAC progression,
  but the mechanism of this is unknown ().
