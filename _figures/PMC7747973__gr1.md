caption: Hormonal Regulation of PIN Trafficking.Polar auxin transporters (e.g., PINs)
  undergo constant recycling between the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments
  (green arrows). In response to developmental or environmental signals, the levels
  of PINs can be downregulated by their re-direction for lytic degradation to vacuoles
  (blue arrows). Plant hormones interfere with distinct steps of the PIN trafficking
  pathway, thereby contributing to fine-tuning of auxin transport and regulation of
  plant growth and development. ABA, abscisic acid; BR, brassinosteroids; CK, cytokinins;
  GA, gibberellic acid; JA, jasmonic acid; NO, nitric oxide; SA, salicylic acid; SL,
  strigolactones; LE, late endosome; MVB, multivesicular body; PVC, prevacuolar compartment;
  TGN, trans-Golgi network.
