caption: Models of iron metabolism in the enterocyte, hepatocyte, macrophage and erythroid
  precursor are shown with labels indicating those gene products for which models
  of deficiency have been recently reported. For simplicity, not all sites of gene/protein
  function are indicated nor are all factors essential for iron metabolism shown.
  Red and green fonts indicate that a factor acts in a stimulatory or inhibitory manner
  respectively. For a more detailed description of gene function, refer to text. In
  the gastrointestinal tract, gastrin and Atp4a stimulate gastric acidification, thereby
  aiding food digestion and maintenance of Fe3+ solubility. After reduction of Fe3+
  to Fe2+, iron is transported into the enterocyte by Dmt1, the levels of which are
  respectively increased and decreased by activity of Hif2α and Ndfip1. Within the
  enterocyte, ferritin stores iron and indirectly regulates the rate of gastrointestinal
  iron absorption, while iron regulatory proteins Irp1 and Irp2 influence levels of
  Dmt1 and Fpn1. Hif2α activity leads to increased basolateral membrane levels of
  Fpn1, which effluxes iron into plasma for oxidation and binding to Tf. In the hepatocyte,
  diferric Tf and Bmp6 stimulate hepcidin expression via a pathway dependent upon
  Hfe, Tfr2, Alk2, Alk3 and Hjv. Expression levels of Hjv are increased by activity
  of neogenin and miR-122 and decreased by activity of Tmprss6. Expression of hepcidin
  is also influenced by Hif1α, Hif2α, Vhl, Irp2 and Fbxl5. In the macrophage, senescent
  red blood cells are catabolized. Nramp1 mediates iron efflux from phagolysosomes,
  while HRI is required for macrophage maturation. Fpn1 effluxes reclaimed iron into
  the plasma for binding to Tf; Hif2α activity stimulates Fpn1 expression levels.
  In the erythroid precursor, Fe is obtained by receptor-mediated endocytosis of diferric
  Tf complexed to Tfr1, the levels of which are regulated by Stat5a/b and Nme1/2.
  Iron is imported into mitochondria by mitoferrin while Fech catalyzes the incorporation
  of iron into heme precursors. Flvcr maintains heme at appropriate levels within
  the erythroid precursor.
