caption: Schematic illustration of a working model depicting the relationship between
  proline and polyamine in wild type, PvP5CS OE and RNAi transgenic plants under control
  and salt stress conditions. In summary, proline metabolism is in cooperation with
  polyamines metabolism in switchgrass. If switchgrass has enough proline to confer
  salt stress, ornithine could be as substrate involved in PAs biosynthesis. However,
  under less proline accumulation to improve the salt tolerance of switchgrass, ornithine
  will be used as a precursor entering the pathway of proline synthesis. Altogether,
  proline and polyamine metabolism cooperated to improve salt tolerance in switchgrass.
