caption: Hypothesis how decreased expression of glucose transporters in brain leading
  to a decreased intracellular d-glucose concentration in neurons may promote the
  emergence of AD. A reduced concentration of d-glucose in neurons decelerates the
  biosynthetic pathway of hexosamine (HBSP) leading to a decreased O-glycosylation
  of proteins tau and APP with N-acetylglucosamine. The glycosylation of these proteins
  is neuroprotective because it decreases hyperphosphorylation of tau that promotes
  the formation of tau oligomers and decreases Aβ formation by degradation of APP.
  The effects of downregulation of cerebral glucose transporters are indicated by
  red arrows. GlcNAc N-acetylglucosamine, UDP-GlcNAc uridine 5′-diphosphate-N-acetylglucosamine,
  OGT O-GlcNAc transferase, OGA O-GlcNAcase, APP amyloid precursor protein
