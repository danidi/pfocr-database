caption: NLRP3, NLRC5, NLRP7, AIM2 and other inflammasome-like signaling is activated
  in response to S. aureus. Activation of inflammasome signaling typically proceeds
  in two steps. First, TLRs engage PAMPS to prime inflammasome signaling. S. aureus
  lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major constituent of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria
  binds TLR2. TLR signaling activates NF-κB-mediated transcription of pro-IL-1β and
  also triggers post-translational modifications of the inflammasome signaling pathway.
  Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome occurs through pore-mediated and phagocytosis-mediated
  processes. PFTs and Hlb damage the plasma membrane and cause potassium efflux necessary
  for inflammasome activation. PVL-induced NLRP3 inflammasome signaling requires CTSB
  activation. PVL, Hla and LukAB also promote Caspase 1-independent cell death. PFTs
  may also destabilize lysophagosomes during phagocytosis of S. aureus. In particular,
  LukAB has been shown to bind CD11b on the phagosomal membrane to promote S. aureus
  escape. This triggers NLRP3-dependent cytokine secretion and NLRP3-independent cell
  death. Lysophagosomal rupture is thought to lead to CTSB leakage into the cytoplasm,
  though this has not been shown directly with S. aureus. A variety of other inflammasomes
  have also been implicated in sensing S. aureus. NLRC5 binds to NLRP3 and enhances
  cytokine secretion. NLRP7 and its ATP-binding activity are required for Caspase
  1 activation in response to S. aureus. AIM2 is activated in response to S. aureus
  central nervous system abscess formation, though it isn't clear if AIM2 is sensing
  S. aureus or a danger-associated molecular pattern resulting from S. aureus infection.
  PSMs also trigger secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, but through a Caspase 1-independent
  mechanism.
