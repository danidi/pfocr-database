caption: Function of bacterial actin nucleators during infection. (A) Vibrio VopF,
  VopN and VopL contribute to the disruption of intestinal epithelial integrity by
  inducing the formation of aberrant protrusions, filopodia and altering tight junctions.
  VopF further contribute to cell alterations by inhibiting apoptosis and arresting
  the cell cycle, by relieving the inhibition of NF-kB regulated genes—a function
  also exerted by VopN by an unknown mechanism. (B) Chlamydia Tarp contributes to
  host cell invasion by rapidly nucleating actin filaments, and indirectly by triggering
  the Rac signalling cascade that leads to activation of the Arp2/3 complex. Phosphorylated
  Tarp also has a role in mediating host cell survival by binding the eukaryotic SHC-1
  adaptor protein. (C) BimA nucleates actin filaments from the Burkholderia cell pole
  allowing bacterial motility in the cytosol and host cell fusion. Burkholderia thailandensis
  BimA also recruits and activates the Arp2/3 complex, leading to the formation of
  curved actin tails. (D) Rickettsia Sca2 promotes invasion of the host cell by mediating
  adhesion to an unknown receptor and inducing actin remodelling. After uptake and
  escape into the cytosol, Sca2 induces the formation of actin comet tails from the
  bacterial cell pole, thus allowing intracellular movement and spread to neighbouring
  cells. (E) Salmonella SipC is part of the T3SS translocon complex and is thought
  to nucleate actin filaments to facilitate invasion. Additionally, SipC is involved
  in the recruitment of exocytic vesicles to the site of entry, presumably to provide
  membrane to the invasion process. SipC might also contribute to the maturation of
  the SCVs by recruiting Golgi-derived vesicles enriched in LAMP1. (F) Legionella
  VipA interferes with eukaryotic vesicle trafficking in the MVB pathway and associates
  with early endosomes during macrophage infection, possibly contributing to the avoidance
  by the LCV of the endocytic machinery.
