caption: Regulatory mechanisms of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. The expression levels
  of NLRP3 are regulated by miR-223 in basal conditions but can be upregulated after
  cell recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns that induce NF-κB signaling
  pathway. The activation of NLRP3 by cellular damage signals as intracellular K+
  decrease or reactive oxygen species (ROS) production requires a deubiquitylation
  of NLRP3 by BRCC3 and also their interaction with NEK7, only available during interphase.
  External signals, such as interferons (IFNs) or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), negatively
  regulate NLRP3 through different mechanisms. The increase in nitric oxide (NO) produced
  by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) leads to the S-nitrosylation of NLRP3
  impairing the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The increase of cyclic AMP (cAMP)
  induced by PGE2 signaling via prostaglandin E2 receptor 4 (EP4) activates the phosphorylation
  of NLRP3 reducing its oligomerization and increasing its ubiquitination to be degraded
  in autophagosomes. The interaction with pyrin domain-only proteins (POPs) can regulate
  NLRP3 inflammasome assembly by sequestering ASC or NLRP3.
