caption: Schematic representation of fibrosis regulation by RBM7 via NEAT1 ncRNA decay
  in the lung. Following bleomycin (BLM) administration, RBM7 expression is selectively
  elevated in the fibrotic phase, and it leads to sustained apoptosis in the epithelium
  via regulating NEAT1 ncRNA decay. CXCL12 from apoptotic non-hematopoietic cells
  is critical for segregated-nucleus-containing atypical monocyte (SatM) migration
  followed by fibrosis initiation. These events, together with the conventional TGF-β/growth
  factor-driven fibrosis pathway, accelerates extracellular matrix (ECM) production
  by activated myofibroblasts. Also, apoptosis is the major source of autoantigens
  for natural autoantibodies, which can reflect the ongoing disease pathology and
  modify the disease course.
