caption: (A) The Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway of ICL repair. Upon fork stalling at
  ICL sites, BRCA1 acts to dismantle the replisome (not shown) and RAD51 binds to
  the single‐stranded DNA to protect the fork. Subsequent FANCM–FAAP24–MHF1/2 complex
  binding activates ATR signalling and promotes recruitment of the FA core complex.
  The core complex in turn ubiquitinates the FANCI–FANCD2 heterodimer, which acts
  via SLX4 as a platform to recruit multiple nucleases (ERCC1‐XPF, SLX1 and MUS81‐EME).
  Nucleolytic incisions unhook the ICL and facilitate translesion synthesis‐dependent
  lesion bypass, mediated by REV1 or Polζ polymerases. The thus‐generated DSB is repaired
  by HR. (B) The HR pathway of DSB repair. DNA ends at a break site are resected to
  generate single‐stranded DNA tails. Resection is initiated by the MRN complex, stimulated
  though CtIP interaction and further extended though the activities of EXO1, BLM,
  WRN and DNA2. The resulting single‐stranded DNA is a substrate for RAD51 monomer
  loading in BRCA2‐ and RAD51 paralog‐dependent manner. The nucleoprotein filament
  thus generated invades a homologous double‐stranded DNA and, following second‐end
  capture, a double Holliday junction structure is generated. Branch migration facilitates
  cleavage of Holliday junctions by GEN1 or SLX4‐MUS81‐EME1‐SLX1 resolvases, or their
  dissolution dependent on the BLM–TOPIIIα–RMI1 complex. Crossover or non‐crossover
  molecules are the final products of the DNA repair reaction. Blue, FA proteins;
  red, HR proteins annotated as FA complementation groups; grey, other proteins associated
  with each pathway.
