caption: Shedding light on a novel signalling pathway. The recent discovery that LKB1
  can activate NUAK1, leading to inactivation of MYPT1 and increased MLC2 phosphorylation,
  suggests this pathway may be important in cancers with LKB1 LOF mutations. In cancer
  LKB1 LOF mutations should result in activation of MYPT1, decreased MLC-2 phosphorylation,
  and increased tumor cell-cell adherence, which could positively feedback to promote
  proliferation. LOF mutations in other kinases, such as DAPK3, could be a means for
  a tumor cell to reach the same end point.
