caption: Proposed model of the relationship between p70S6K2 and the HH pathway. The
  activation of the canonical HH pathway is initiated by binding of the HH ligand
  to its receptor PTCH, which relieves the repression of SMOH. The activation of SMOH
  is translated into GLI zinc-finger transcription factors. Glycogen synthase kinase-3
  beta (GSK3β) negatively regulates GLI transcription factors cooperating with other
  kinases such as PKA and CK1s. GSK3β is negatively regulated through phosphorylation
  by p70S6K2 which is a downstream effecter of the PI3K pathway.
