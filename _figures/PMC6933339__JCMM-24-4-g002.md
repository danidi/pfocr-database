caption: TRPM2‐dependent molecular mechanisms for delayed neuronal death. Two distinctive
  TRPM2‐mediated molecular mechanisms for delayed neuronal death leading to ischaemia‐reperfusion
  brain damage have been proposed. A, Elevated generation of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) during ischaemia‐reperfusion and subsequent activation of the TRPM2 channel
  in hippocampal neurons induce down‐regulation of the GluNA2‐containing NMDAR‐mediated
  survival signalling pathway and up‐regulation of the GluNB2‐containing NMDAR‐mediated
  death‐promoting signalling pathways, resulting in neuronal death. B, Elevated ROS
  during reperfusion following transient ischaemia stimulates NADPH‐dependent oxidases
  (NOX)‐mediated ROS generation. ROS causes lysosomal loss and dysfunction and release
  of Zn2+, elevating the cytosolic Zn2+ level. ROS also induces activation of the
  TRPM2 channel in the mitochondria as well as on the cell surface via promoting ADPR
  generation catalysed by poly(ADPR) polymerase (PARP) and poly(ADPR) glycohydrolase
  (PARG) in the nucleus. Activation of the TRPM2 channel in the mitochondria increases
  mitochondrial uptake of Zn2+ that triggers mitochondrial loss and dysfunction and
  mitochondrial ROS generation. Therefore, activation of the TRPM2 channel sets in
  motion a positive feedback mechanism ultimately drives lysosomal and mitochondrial
  dysfunction and neuronal death
