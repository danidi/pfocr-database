caption: AtT-20 cells express proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and produce products characteristic
  of anterior pituitary corticotropes. Endogenous levels of PAM in AtT-20 cells are
  much lower than pituitary levels; PAM trafficking has been studied by stably expressing
  single isoforms of PAM and PAM mutants in AtT-20 cells. PAM-1 can be proteolytically
  processed in the lumen of the SG by the prohormone convertases to generate soluble
  PHM, membrane PAL (PALm) or soluble, bifunctional PAMs. The soluble proteins are
  released upon exocytosis while the membrane proteins [PAM-1, PALm and transmembrane
  domain-cytosolic domain (TMD-CD)] are inserted into the plasma membrane. They are
  quickly endocytosed and can be cleaved by endoproteases in the endocytic pathway,
  degraded in lysosomes or returned to the TGN for re-entry into SGs. Peptide products
  stored in the SGs (represented by gold balls) are released in response to stimulation.
