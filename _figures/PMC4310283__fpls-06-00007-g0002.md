caption: 'Early biosynthetic steps of flavonoid metabolism leading to the formation
  of flavonoid groups of Flavanones and Flavones. At the initial steps, the flavonoid
  core molecule is produced from the condensation reaction of activated hydroxinnamic
  acids with 3 molecules of Malonyl-CoA (not shown) by the action of chalcone synthase
  (CHS) and subsequent isomeration with the enzyme chalcone isomerase (CHI) for the
  generation of the flavanone group (Ververidis et al., ). Following the action of
  flavone synthase I (FNS I) the group of flavones is produced. 4CL, hydroxycinnamic
  acid:CoA ligase; CHR, chalcone reductase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′ hydroxylase; F3′5′H,
  flavonoid 3′5′ hydroxylase; MT, methyltransferase; GT, glucoside transferase and
  Sam5: microbial C3H (Lee et al., ). Flavonoids indicated with the same lettering
  (A–D) declare components of certain biosynthetic path. (*) Dihydrotricetin is produced
  from naringenin chalcone (A) by the action of both F3′5′H before the action of CHI,
  thus it is introduced instead of naringenin into pathway (D) (Andersen and Markham,
  ).'
