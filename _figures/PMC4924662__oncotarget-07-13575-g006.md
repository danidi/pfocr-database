caption: In HCC cells, high concentration of FGF19 from autocrine, paracrine and endocrine
  secretion constitutively activates FGFR4, resulting in phosphorylating GSK3β at
  S9, which in favor of increased active β-catenin in nuclear. Nuclear β-catenin represses
  E-cadherin expression to promote EMT through enhancing the expression of Snail1
  and Twist.
