caption: Models. Epithelial cell fate decision in the lower FRT. Vaginal mesenchymal
  cells instruct vaginal epithelial cell fate in MDE by secreting BMP4, ActA, and
  FGF7/10. In MDE, BMP4 signal is transduced by canonical SMAD-dependent pathway,
  whereas ActA signal activates RUNX1 expression through a SMAD-independent pathway.
  FGF7/10 signal is transduced by the FGFR2IIIb-MAPK pathway in MDE. Three signaling
  pathways in concert activate expression of ΔNp63, and afterwards, the transcriptional
  activity of ΔNp63 locus is maintained by ΔNp63 itself (). The disruption of one
  of these pathways interferes with ΔNp63 expression and subsequently cervical/vaginal
  epithelial differentiation, resulting in cervical and vaginal adenosis.
