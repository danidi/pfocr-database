caption: Distribution of Actinidia ESTs in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. Previously
  published sequences in GenBank belonging to the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway
  [] were used to identify genes in the Actinidia EST database using BLAST searches.
  ESTs refers to the number of ESTs found in the Actinidia EST database for each step
  of the pathway.
