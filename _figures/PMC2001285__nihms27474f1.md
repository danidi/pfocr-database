caption: 'This diagram summarizes recent findings from neural systems analysis of
  the behavioral model, conditioned potentiation of feeding, that relies on learned
  cues to override metabolic signals. In that model, a cue previously paired with
  food when an animal was hungry can initiate eating in sated rats.The lateral hypothalamus
  (LHA) is an integrative site for feeding signals, both intrinsic and extrinsic.
  Pathways in red show projections to the LHA with origins in the forebrain neurons
  that show activation by a conditioned stimulus (CS+) that promotes feeding. The
  origins of these pathways in the basolateral amygdala (BLA; includes BL, BM, and
  LA), and ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC; includes PL, ILA, and mOFC) are
  critical functionally, as shown by lesions of each of these areas, which abolish
  CS-enhanced feeding. Our studies have further shown that direct projections from
  CEA are not critical; as indicated by lack of selective activation of that pathway
  by the effective CS+, and the fact that lesions of CEA spare CS-enhanced feeding.
  Blue line shows interconnections between the BLA and mPFC that may also play a role
  in regulation of feeding by learned cues.Abbreviations: ARH, arcuate nucleus of
  the hypothalamus; BLA, basolateral amygdala; BL, basolateral nucleus of the amygdala;
  BM, basomedial nucleus of the amygdala; DMH, dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus;
  ILA, infralimbic area; LA, lateral nucleus of the amygdala; LHA, lateral hypothalamic
  area; PL, prelimbic area; mOFC, medial orbitofrontal area; VMH, ventromedial nucleus
  of the hypothalamus. Plates modified from the atlas of Swanson [].'
