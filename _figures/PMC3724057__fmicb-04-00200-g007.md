caption: 'MOMA analysis identifies double-gene knockouts in primary metabolism that
  funnel carbon toward DHA. As per one MOMA prediction, engineering the FyDHA strain
  by knocking out two genes (1: OAC1 or YKL120W, which codes for an oxaloacetate transporter
  and 2: AAT1 or YKL106W, which codes for an aspartate aminotransferase) should result
  in 4.2 mol DHA per 100 mol of glucose, which amounts to a ~70-fold increase as compared
  to our current yield and translates to ~18% of the theoretical yield of DHA from
  glucose. This metabolic map depicts the mechanism by which these two deletions accomplish
  the flux redirection. Red arrows indicate decreased flux and green arrows indicate
  increase in flux relative to our (control) DHA-producing strain; arrow thicknesses
  and numbers alongside the arrows represent flux differences between the baseline
  strain FyDHA’ and the double-gene knockout strain are in arbitrary units. On the
  basis of the 13C isotopomer results, FBA predicted that our control strain loses
  a significant amount of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA (ACoAm) to CO2 through a cyclic,
  cytosolic pathway that contains most steps of the TCA cycle. Knocking out YKL120W
  and YKL106W breaks this cycle while not significantly affecting biomass production,
  thus allowing ACoAm to be diverted toward downstream pathways including DHA biosynthesis.'
