caption: Wnts exert both pre- and post-synaptic effects. Presynaptic Wnt signaling
  through Wnt3 and Wnt7 acts through a Dvl pathway to stabilize microtubules and also
  influences presynaptic clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) through an
  APC-mediated mechanism (upper left). Presynaptic β-catenin is also involved in synapse
  formation and maintenance through cell–cell adhesion mechanisms, though a relationship
  between this and Wnt signaling remains speculative. Wnt5a-activated signaling through
  the Ror kinase is also thought to contribute to an increase in presynaptic sites
  through a mechanism that has not yet been determined (upper right). Postsynaptic
  Wnt signaling driven by Wnt5a probably acts through a Dvl/Rac/JNK pathway to regulate
  the actin cytoskeleton (lower right). Application of Wnt3a, Wnt 7a, or Wnt7b is
  sufficient to induce β-catenin translocation to the nucleus and may well also influence
  synapses (not shown). As in the presynaptic terminal, β-catenin is present in the
  postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses where it is involved in cell–cell adhesion.
  Also not shown is a highly divergent postsynaptic pathway established at the Drosophila
  neuromuscular junction involving cleavage and translocation of Fzd receptors to
  the nucleus; there is evidence that a mechanistically similar pathway operates at
  some vertebrate synapses
