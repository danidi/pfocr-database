caption: (A) Ang II-mediated stimulation of AT1R leads to the activation of both Gαq
  protein- and β-arrestin-mediated signaling pathways, each of which can induce protein
  synthesis through the activation of the ERK1/2-Mnk1-eIF4E pathway, though it is
  not known if the effects of each pathway are equivalent. Sequestration of ERK1/2
  in the cytosol by β-arrestins prevents nuclear targeting and effects on gene expression
  and promotes anti-apoptotic signaling via p90RSK regulation of intracellular BAD
  targeting. β-arrestins 1 and 2 each interact with a number of proteins involved
  in receptor internalization, including c-Src, AP-2 and ARNO, which promote AT1R
  endocytosis following stimulation. Interaction with AIP4 promotes ubiquitination
  of TRPV4, a nonselective cation channel, promoting its internalization in conjunction
  with AT1R. A possible β-arrestin-Gaf-1-Rab11 complex may promote trafficking of
  internalized AT1R to the plasma membrane. (B) AT1R stimulation mediates hypertrophy
  via distinct mechanisms including transactivation of EGFR via either Gαq protein-
  or β-arrestin-mediated activation of the c-Src-MMP-HB-EGF shedding pathway, as well
  as Gαq protein-mediated activation of PKC signaling. Each signaling pathway results
  in ERK1/2 activation and an increase in hypertrophy, though the relative contributions
  of each pathway to the hypertrophic response in different cell types and pathological
  states, and whether they are equivalent responses, is unknown. (C) Activation of
  AT1R leads to Gαq protein-mediated increases in contractility via modulation of
  intracellular Ca2+ levels and PKC signaling. AT1R-β-arrestin-mediated signaling
  leads to activation of RhoA and ROCK, which subsequently contributes to stress fiber
  reorganization and membrane blebbing in HEK 293 cells. Whether these processes mediate
  contractility is not yet known. β-arrestins 1 and 2 each interact with a number
  of other proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation, including actin, cofilin,
  PP2A and slingshot, which though coordinated action can lead to actin depolymerization
  and possible effects on contractility following AT1R stimulation.
