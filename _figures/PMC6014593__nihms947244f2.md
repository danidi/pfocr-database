caption: Summary schematic of eye morphogenesis pathways. This schematic describes
  some of the pathways involved in morphogenesis of the mouse eye from E9.5, when
  the lens placode overlies the optic vesicle, to E10.5 when the lens pit has invaginated
  and the optic cup has become bilayered. The surface ectoderm, presumptive retina,
  and presumptive retina pigmented epithelium are color-coded in red, green, and gray,
  respectively. Within the red box, we summarize the action of three GTPases that
  have distinct actions on lens placode invagination. Cdc42 and IRSp53 are required
  for the generation of filopodia within the presumptive lens that connect to the
  presumptive retina and permit force transmission between the two epithelia. They
  are required for a full invagination of the lens pit and for subtle shaping of the
  optic cup. This is and example where lens pit invagination depends on extrinsic
  forces. The GTPases RhoA and Rac1 are required for the generation of intrinsic forces
  for lens pit invagination because they control cell length (Rac1 through an Arpc2/cortactin
  response) and apical constriction (RhoA through a Rho kinase (ROCK) phospho-myosin
  pathway). RhoA activity is likely controlled by the TRIO guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor and in turn, this is required for the apical localization of Shroom3, an
  actin and ROCK-binding protein required for apical constriction. At the transcriptional
  level, Shroom3 is positively regulated by Pax6. During lens pit invagination, the
  coordinated morphogenesis of the optic cup is in part stimulated by Wnt/Catnb pathway
  ligands that are produced by nonlens surface ectoderm. These ligands stimulate the
  production of cells within the developing retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). The
  RPE thus expands against the relatively static retina and, with the principle of
  a bimetallic strip, induces curvature in the optic cup. The red arrows indicate
  the movements of morphogenesis for the each epithelial layer.
