caption: The predicted interactions among apoplastic proteins and signaling molecules
  in resurrection plants during dehydration. Dehydration induces turgor pressure changes,
  which are sensed by mechanosensitive (MS) calcium channels As a consequence [Ca2+]cyt
  levels rise. The plasma membrane-localized NADPH oxidases (respiratory burst oxidase
  homologs, RBOHs) are activated through binding [Ca2+]cyt and produce O2−, a substrate
  of the cell wall superoxide dismutase (SOD). The apoplastic H2O2 as the product
  of SOD also leads to Ca2+ influx. Cell wall peroxidases produce hydroxyl radicals
  (OH−) with apoplastic H2O2 as substrate. The reactive OH− is able to rupture glycosidic
  bonds and leads to cell wall loosening. In addition to OH−, expansin and xyloglucan
  endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (XTH) may contribute to loosening the cell wall by
  disrupting the interaction between hemicellulose and cellulose during the early
  stages of dehydration and rehydration. Cell wall peroxidases facilitate wall stiffness
  by reinforcing the cross-linking of extensin with cell wall polysaccharides. Excessive
  [Ca2+]cyt is toxic and thus [Ca2+]cyt is transported to the extracellular space
  by Ca2+ efflux systems (Ca2+ exchangers are shown). The alkalization in the apoplast
  affects the activity of many cell wall proteins, one of which is pectinmethylesterase
  (PME). PME exerts its demethylesterifying role on pectin in alkalized apoplast and
  generates negatively charged pectins, which form the egg-box pectin gelatin with
  apoplastic Ca2+ and increase wall stiffness. Wall-associated kinase (WAK) forms
  a complex with the glycine-rich protein (GRP) and can detect the egg-box pectin.
  This then in turn activates the vacuolar invertase activity. The classic (glycosylphosphatidyl
  inositol) GPI-anchored cell wall arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are involved in
  signal transduction between the intracellular and extracellular compartments and
  act as plasticizers in resurrection plants against desiccation. The signaling pathway
  and the interactions in the apoplast are hypothesized according to the available
  literatures and the current research on cell walls of resurrection plants.
