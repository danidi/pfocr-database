caption: Model of interaction between an oncolytic virus and the host type I IFN response
  and cyclin expression. Host pattern recognition receptors (PRR) will recognize intracellular
  viral particles and initiate a type I IFN response. Upon viral recognition, IFN
  signals through the type I IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR) leading to the activation of
  Janus kinase 1 and/or tyrosine kinase 2 (JAK1/TYK2) and recruitment of signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) for phosphorylation and dimerization. The
  phosphorylated STAT1 dimer then binds IRF9 to form the interferon-stimulated gene
  factor 3 complex (ISGF3) complex, which binds IFN-stimulated response elements located
  in ISGs, resulting in the activation of antiviral genes. Some of the most well-studied
  antiviral genes include OAS1 and MxA. OAS1 is dsRNA-dependent synthetase that activates
  the endoribonuclease RNase L to degrade ssRNA while MxA proteins bind target viral
  proteins to inhibit viral replication. The expression of these ISGs induces an antiviral
  state. Viruses have developed mechanisms to antagonize the type I IFN response.
  The ability of E1A protein to decrease IRF9 levels, thereby inhibiting the type
  I IFN pathway, is shown. Viral E1A protein promotes cyclin E expression, which in
  turn, binds to and promotes the activation of CDK2. Activated CDK2 promotes viral
  replication. Palbociclib increases IRF9 expression and promotes cyclin E/CDK2 activation.
  Thus, the ability of the oncolytic virus to replicate and cause cytotoxicity will
  be dependent on the level of activation of type I IFN and cyclin E/CDK2.
