caption: Proposed catalytic mechanism for PseG based on modeling of the UDP-sugar
  complex and activity analysis of substitution derivatives. Here, PseG employs a
  single displacement mechanism involving C–O bond cleavage via direct attack of the
  anomeric carbon by a hydroxide nucleophile. Specifically, the residue His17 performs
  a base-catalyzed attack of water by abstracting a proton. The activated water is
  anchored with its other proton hydrogen-bonded to the main-chain carbonyl of Ile13,
  and it is further stabilized by the partially positively charged edge of the aromatic
  ring of Tyr78 (not shown). Several PseG residues participate in direct intermolecular
  interactions with the sugar moiety and stabilize the Michaelis complex, including
  Asn255 that appears as a determinant in selecting the twist-boat conformation already
  present in the free substrate. This twist-boat conformation of the sugar appears
  primed for catalysis, as it exposes the C-1 atom and favors attack by the His17-activated
  water, resulting in inversion of stereochemistry at C-1 and cleavage of the C-1–OGly
  bond. The liberated sugar product is expected to attain an equilibrium distribution
  of α and β anomers that interconvert nonenzymatically in solution. The inset shows
  a proposed scheme for His17 acting as a general base, abstracting a proton from
  water, or via the H17N substitution H-bonding with the proposed catalytic water
  molecule.
