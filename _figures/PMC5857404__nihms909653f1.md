caption: The Protein C (PC) pathway and the protective effects of activated protein
  C (APC) after ischemic injury. There are four major PC pathways. 1. PC activation.
  PC, bound to its receptor, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), is activated by
  thrombomodulin (TM)-bound thrombin (IIa) complex on the endothelial cell surface.
  2. Antithrombotic activity. APC employs its anticoagulant activities by proteolytic
  inactivation of factor Va (FVa) and factor VIIIa (FVIIIa) aided by the cofactor
  Protein S (PS). 3. Cytoprotective signaling. APC associated with EPCR cleaves protease-activated
  receptor-1 (PAR-1) in caveolae initiating cytoprotective signaling including altered
  gene expression, and anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and barrier protective activities.
  Other receptors (not shown) may also contribute to cytoprotective signaling. 4.
  APC is inhibited by serine protease inhibitors (Serpins). APC is transported across
  the blood-brain barrier (BBB) into brain where it has many protective and regenerative
  effects. APC treatment after ischemic stroke limits brain injuries by protecting
  the BBB and neurons and reducing inflammatory responses. Furthermore, APC promotes
  neovascularization and neurogenesis, and it improves neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation,
  integration and neurogenic activity, aiding functional recovery.
