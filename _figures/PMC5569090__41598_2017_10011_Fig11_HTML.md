caption: 'Schematic presentation of the mechanism for shell biomineralization mediated
  by the TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway in molluscs. In the mantle, the ligand Bmp2 or
  Bmp7 binds to the complex of type I receptor Bmpr1b and type II receptor Bmpr2.
  Bmpr1b is phosphorylated by the constitutively active Bmpr2 kinase and thereby recruits
  a cytoplasmic Smad1/5/8 (R-Smad), which is then phosphorylated by activated Bmpr1b.
  Smad1/5/8 may dissociate from the receptors to form a heteromeric complex with Smad4
  (Co-Smad). The Smad complex is transported into the nucleus, where it regulates
  the expression of specific matrix protein (MP) genes alone or by binding certain
  transcription factors (either corepressors or coactivators). The MPs may be synthesized
  through conventional ways throughout the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus
  (GA) and secreted out of the mantle cells. Finally, the MPs arrive at the mineralization
  site on the surface of the shell, and the MPs with different functions regulate
  the formation of the nacreous layer (NL) and prismatic layer (PL). Bambi is a negative
  regulator and competitively binds to the ligands and Bmpr2, which cannot trigger
  the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, inhibiting the signal transduction in this pathway.
  The green arrows indicate known pathways, and the gray dotted arrows indicate potential
  pathways. The red dotted circle indicates the interactions of Bambi, Bmpr2 and Bmpr1b.
