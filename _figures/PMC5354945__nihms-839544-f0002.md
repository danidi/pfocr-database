caption: The absence of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (c-IAPs) results
  in the activation of cell death pathways. Activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor
  1 (TNFR1) by its ligand tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) results in formation of a
  complex consisting of Fas-associated via death domain (FADD), receptor-interacting
  protein 1 (RIP1), and caspase-8, which leads to downstream apoptosis. Should caspase-8
  be absent, necroptosis is triggered through a FADD, RIP1, and RIP3 intermediary
  that results in activation of the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein.
  c-IAPs also upregulate canonical NF-κB signaling while concurrently downregulating
  non-canonical NF-κB pathway activation. In canonical NF-κB signaling, binding of
  TNFR1 by TNFα results in the recruitment of adaptor proteins TNF receptor 1-associated
  via death domain (TRADD) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to TNFR1.
  In turn, RIP1 and c-IAP1/2 are recruited to the activated complex. c-IAP ubiquitination
  of RIP1 leads to the creation of a binding platform for TGFβ-activated kinase 1
  (TAK1), TAK1 binding protein (TAB), and the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) kinase (IKK)
  complex. IKKβ is subsequently activated via phosphorylation and itself phosphorylates
  the inhibitory NF-κB subunit (IκB), leading to its degradation. This frees the NF-κB
  subunits p50 and RELA and allows their translocation to the nucleus. In the non-canonical
  NF-κB pathway, c-IAPs work to keep levels of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) constitutively
  low. Acting as part of a cytoplasmic complex in concordance with TRAF2 and TRAF3,
  c-IAPs continuously ubiquitinate NIK, marking it for proteasomal degradation. Depletion
  of c-IAPs through the use of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC)
  mimetics allows for a buildup of NIK to occur. This results in NIK-mediated phosphorylation
  of IKKα, which then phosphorylates the inactive NF-κB subunit p100 and leads to
  its partial proteasomal degradation. As a result, the active NF-κB subunit p52 is
  generated and translocates to the nucleus along with RELB to activation gene transcription.
