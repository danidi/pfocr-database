caption: Metabolic pathways influence effector function of multiple cell types. Glycolysis
  is typically associated with inflammatory functions of immune cells whereas oxidative
  phosphorylation is associated with suppressive or reparative functions. Activated
  CD4 T cells in SLE have enhanced glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Metformin
  inhibits mitochondrial complex 1, thereby inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation,
  but also acts via the mTOR pathway to increase fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis.
  The latter is inhibited by 2 deoxy-glucose (2DG), explaining why the combination
  of metformin and 2DG can reverse active SLE in mouse models, whereas neither drug
  can do this alone [].
