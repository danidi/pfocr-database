caption: 'The amygdala and its network. This figure shows selected afferents and efferents
  of the amygdala. Functional groups are color coded. The amygdala screens stimuli
  received from high-order sensory cortices (orange pathway). The response of the
  amygdala to the incoming stimulus is determined by the activity of several modulation
  pathways. These pathways include a context- and memory-based modulation (green pathway),
  a top-down modulation (red pathway), and a reward-based modulation (blue pathway).
  BLn: Basolateral nucleus, CEA: Central nucleus of the amygdala, DM Vagus: Dorsal
  motor nucleus of the Vagus, Lat. Habenual: Lateral habenula, mPFC: medial prefrontal
  cortex, Nacc: Nucleus accumbens, PAG: Periacqueductal gray area, Rmtg: Rostromedial
  tegmental nucleus, VTA: Ventral tegmental area'
