caption: A model for SMARCAL1 function at stalled replication forks. SMARCAL1 binds
  at the single strand/double strand junction in the replicating arm, partially through
  an interaction between its N terminus and the C-terminal domain of RPA32. In an
  ATP-dependent manner, it stabilizes base pairing between the daughter and parent
  strands. In the absence of SMARCAL1, incomplete daughter strands are allowed to
  peel off their parent strands, leading to aberrant DNA structures and replication
  fork instability. Following a break at the fork, the end is resected, RAD51 is loaded,
  and the DNA enters the homologous recombination pathway.
