caption: 'The cyst(e)ine-glutathione-GPX4 axis regulates ferroptosis. The cystine/glutamate
  antiporter, system Xc−, is composed of two subunits, SLC7A11 and SLC3A2. System
  Xc− is the dominant pathway for regulating cysteine levels within cells by transporting
  cystine into cells. An alternate pathway for synthesizing cysteine is through the
  transsulfuration pathway. Cysteine is used as a substrate for glutathione biosynthesis,
  which is further used to activate GPX4 to inhibit lipid peroxidation. This antioxidative
  activity of GPX4 allows for the prevention of ferroptosis. Selenium metabolism is
  important for the activity of GPX4, which is a selenoprotein. Ferroptosis inhibiting
  and inducing factors are indicated in green and red, respectively. (Abbreviations:
