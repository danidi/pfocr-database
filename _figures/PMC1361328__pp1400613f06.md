caption: Demand-driven synthesis and multiple regulation of GSH. Maintenance of GSH
  homeostasis and increase in PC levels provide tolerance to zinc stress in transgenic
  tobacco overexpressing glyoxalase genes. Nontransgenic plants exposed to high levels
  of zinc not only undergo oxidative stress but also show an increase in MG levels.
  ROS and high MG levels cause damage to the plants. However, glyoxalase transgenics
  seem to be capable of detoxifying both of these harmful compounds and survive heavy-metal
  stress. Increased level of MG is directly detoxified through overexpression of glyoxalase
  pathway enzymes, and maintenance of GSH levels in transgenics could be involved
  in quenching of ROS generated upon stress. Also, GSH homeostasis helps in increased
  production of PCs, which might sequester the excess zinc ions through the PC-metal
  ion complex. γ-EC, (γ-glutamylcysteine); γ-ECS, (γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase);
  GS, (glutathione synthetase).
