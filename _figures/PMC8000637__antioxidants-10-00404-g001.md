caption: Albumin structure and its tubular reabsorption. (A) Schematic drawing of
  the human serum albumin (HSA) structure. The mature HSA presents 585 amino acids
  and a molecular weight of 66.5 kDa, containing three homologous α-helical domains
  (I, II, and III), each comprised of two sub-domains A and B. Each sub-domain is
  represented by a rectangular bar with a unique color. The two Sudlow’s sites, high
  affinity binding sites for different molecules on HSA, are marked in black dashed
  lines. (B) Albumin is partially filtered in the glomeruli and reabsorbed by receptor-mediated
  endocytosis into proximal (71%) and distal tubule cells (26%). This schematic representation
  shows albumin internalization and its degradation in the proximal tubule. Albumin
  binds to the megalin–cubulin complex receptor and is directed into clathrin-coated
  vesicles for endocytosis. Following endocytosis, endosomal acidification occurs,
  which causes albumin dissociation from the megalin–cubulin complex, leading albumin
  to bind to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). Finally, albumin is transferred to the
  lysosomal compartment for degradation (step a) or for the transcytotic pathway (step
  b), while the receptors may be recycled through dense apical tubules.
