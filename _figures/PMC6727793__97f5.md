caption: 'Models of SAM1 vs. SAM2 perturbations to the methyl cycle resulting in genome
  stability effects. Top left panel: Known methyl cycle pathway in S. cerevisiae.
  Bullet points in blue at the top are known points about cells in steady state and
  the portions of the methyl cycle that might affect genome stability. Top right panel:
  Effects observed in sam2-deficient cells due to the sole functionality of SAM1.
  Points in blue are supported from previous data or data presented here. Red X represents
  the model supported here in which presence of SAM1 alone does not sufficiently generate
  AdoMet from methionine and ATP, leaving a decreased AdoMet pool and an increased
  methionine concentration, impeding the methyl cycle leading to increased genome
  instability. Bottom panel: Effects observed in sam1-deficient cells due to the sole
  functionality of SAM2. Points in blue are supported from previous data or data presented
  here. Two models are proposed that might explain the decreased genome instability
  observed. Model A (left): Red Xs represent points where lack of SAM1 impedes cellular
  sensing of AdoMet for AdoMet usage in downstream pathways. Decreased genome instability
  likely occurs due to increased AdoMet levels suppressing production of more reactive
  methyl donor species. Model B (right): Red arrows represent points were cycle is
  overactive due to lack of SAM1 to sense and control AdoMet levels. Increased AdoMet
  increases methyl cycle cyclization and decreased genome instability may arise from
  increased AdoMet suppression of alternate more reactive methyl donors, increased
  GSH for ROS scavenging, and/or increased dNTP that can facilitate genome repair.'
