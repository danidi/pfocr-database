caption: Increased RGS4 degradation induced by NO release subsequent to angiogenesis/arteriogenesis
  in the heart acts as a hypertrophic switch that promotes a growth response in cardiomyocytes.
  Loss of RGS4 relieves G protein inhibition; thus, Gα/Gβγ subunits are prone to propagate
  hypertrophic signaling. This is most likely initiated by freely dissociated Gβγ
  subunits through activation of the PI3Kγ/Akt/mTORC1 pathway. This mechanism occurs
  in the absence of traditional hypertrophic stimuli.
