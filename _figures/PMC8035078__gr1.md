caption: Schematic representation of LTA synthesis, models for the cross-membrane
  d-alanine modification process and examples of WTA and complex SCWP synthesis pathways.
  (a) Glycolipid anchor and type I poly-glycerolphosphate LTA synthesis in S. aureus.
  The glycolipid Glc2-DAG is produced by YpfP using UDP-glucose as substrate and flipped
  to the outer leaflet of the membrane by LtaA. The GroP polymer is produced by LtaS-type
  enzymes on the outside of the cell. (b) Current models for the cross-membrane d-alanine
  modification process of LTA. An alanine is attached by DltA to the phosphopantetheine
  prosthetic group of the carrier protein DltC. DltC binds to DltB, which is thought
  to transfer the d-alanine onto either a lipid carrier (left side) or directly onto
  DltD (right side), which then transfers it onto the LTA polymer. (c) RboP WTA synthesis
  in S. aureus. The RboP WTA polymer is synthesized in the cytoplasm, modified intracellularly
  by the glycosyltransferases TarM, TarS and/or TarP, exported and attached to the
  peptidoglycan layer. (d) RboP WTA synthesis in L. monocytogenes serotype 1/2a strains.
  Similar to S. aureus, the RboP WTA polymer in L. monocytogenes serotype 1/2a strains
  is polymerized intracellularly, but then thought to be exported and glycosylated
  extracellularly using a multi-component transmembrane glycosylation system. (e)
  Rhamnose cell wall polysaccharide (RhaCWP) synthesis and glycosylation in S. pyogenes.
  The cell wall polymer is produced in the cytoplasm, exported and glycosylated extracellularly
  using a multi-component transmembrane glycosylation system. (f) Complex SCWP synthesis
  and glycosylation in B. anthracis. The polymer is thought to be produced using a
  Wzx/Wzy-enzyme translocation and polymerization pathway. Small polymer subunits
  are produced intracellularly, partially glycosylated intracellularly, transported
  across the membrane and further glycosylated via a multi-component transmembrane
  glycosylation system, before polymerization and attachment to the peptidoglycan
  layer.
