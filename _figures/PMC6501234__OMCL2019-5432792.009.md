caption: Schematic diagram of the proposed molecular mechanism for LPS-induced downregulation
  of StAR expression and progesterone production in pGL. Treatment with LPS leads
  to the elevation of ROS and subsequently reduces GATA4 and GATA6 expressions, which
  finally reduced the expression of StAR. Elimination of ROS with melatonin or Vc
  could rescue the expressions of GATA4, GATA6, and StAR. LPS treatment also downregulates
  P450scc (encoded by the CYP11A1 gene) and 3β-HSD expressions, but not through the
  ROS/GATA4/GATA6 signaling pathway.
