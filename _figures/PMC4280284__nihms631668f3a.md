caption: (A) In Tregs, TCR and IL-2 signaling promotes Treg proliferation and function
  by activating mTORC1-dependent lipid biosynthesis, particularly the mevalonate pathway.
  mTORC1 also promotes Treg function through inhibition of mTORC2 activity. VAT-associated
  Tregs exhibit increased expression of PPAR-γ, which promotes fatty acid metabolism
  and hence stimulates the accumulation and suppressive phenotypes of Tregs residing
  in adipose tissue. (B) In conventional T cells, mTOR signaling inhibits Foxp3 induction
  partly by inducing HIF1α expression and HIF1α-dependent glycolysis. mTOR signaling
  promotes TH1, TH2, TH17 and effector CD8+ T cell differentiation. However, mTORC1
  signaling negatively regulates memory CD8+ T cell differentiation. Whether and how
  mTOR signaling controls Tfh differentiation is currently unknown.
