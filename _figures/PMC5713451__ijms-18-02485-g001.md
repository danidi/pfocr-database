caption: Physiologic and oncogenic Hedgehog signaling. (a) In the absence of HH ligands,
  PTCH1 constitutively represses SMO, blocking the HH signal transduction; (b) The
  family of extracellular HH ligands binds to PTCH1, de-represses SMO thereby allowing
  its translocation on the tip of the primary cilium. SMO sends signals through a
  series of interacting proteins, including SUFU, resulting in activation of the downstream
  GLI family of transcription factors; (c) Loss of function of PTCH1 (red cross) or
  activating mutations of SMO (blue asterisk) induces HH pathway in the absence of
  HH ligands. HH; Hedgehog; PTCH1; Patched Homolog 1; SMO; SMOothened; SUFU; suppressor
  of fused; GLI; glioma-associated oncogene.
