caption: (A) Metabolism of MG by the glyoxalase system. (B) Protein modification by
  methylglyoxal with formation of arginine-derived hydroimidazolone, MG-H1. (C) DNA
  modification by methylglyoxal with formation of deoxyguanosine-derived imidazopurinone
  MGdG. The adduct residue is shown with guanyl base only. This figure is reproduced
  with permission from []. The major MG glycation adducts of protein and DNA are shown,
  accounting for ca. 90% of total adducts formed. Other minor adducts were described
  elsewhere [, ]
