caption: A model of how oncogenic network influences cancer treatment outcome. How
  two oncogenic moieties (NF-κB and bcl2) are connected in a network at diagnosis
  - a linear pathway in which NF-κB drives bcl2 expression reminiscent of ABC DLBCL,
  or in independent parallel pathways reminiscent of GCB DLBCL - influences the cellular
  outcome and sensitivity to treatment using conventional chemotherapy and/or novel
  NF-κB inhibitor.
