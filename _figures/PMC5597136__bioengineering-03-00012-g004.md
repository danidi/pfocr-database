caption: Known and recovered GRN for cell cycle pathway in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
  (a) target pathways of the 14 genes. CDC28 associates with cyclin CLN3 at the start
  of mitosis to cause the activation of SBF (SWI4/SWI6) and MBF (MBP1/SWI6), promoting
  the transcription of CLN1, CLN2. At G1 phase CDC28 associates with G1-cyclins CLN1
  to CLN3, while B-type cyclins CLB1 to CLB6 regulate CDC28 during S, G2, and M phases.
  CLN1 and CLN2 interacting with CDC28 promote activation of B-type cyclin associated
  Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), which drives DNA replication and entry into mitosis.
  Adapted from []. (b) recovered yeast cell cycle pathway. The arrows show the direction
  of regulation. Some key regulations like activation (positive regulation) of the
  SBF (SWI4/SWI6) and MBF (MBP1/SWI6) complexes by the starter complex (CDC28/CLN3)
  are recovered.
