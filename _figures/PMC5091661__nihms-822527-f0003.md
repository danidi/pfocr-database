caption: 'Metabolic pathways used for synthesis of NAD+ in yeast and mammals. (a)
  The de novo NAD+synthesis pathway converts tryptophan to quinolinate (blue box),
  which is then converted into NAMN, a precursor to NAD+. The NAD+ salvage pathway
  (light brown arrows) converts NAM, one of the by-products of sirtuin-mediated deacetylation,
  back into NAD+. Yeast converts NAM into NAD+ through the generation of NA. (b) Mammals
  are able to process NA in the same manner as yeast to generate NAD+. However, the
  mammalian salvage pathway does not generate NA; instead, NAM is converted into NMN
  and then directly back into NAD+. NAD+ is consumed during the deacetylation of histones
  catalyzed by sirtuins. Abbreviations: NA, nicotinic acid; NaAD, nicotinic acid adenine
  dinucleotide; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NAM, nicotinamide; NAMN,
  nicotinic acid mononucleotide; NAMPT, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; NMN,
  nicotinamide mononucleotide; OAAR, O-acetyl ADP-ribose.'
