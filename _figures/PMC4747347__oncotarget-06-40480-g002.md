caption: During aging or under pathological conditions, α-synuclein A53T can cause
  mitochondria damage and induce mitophagy. However, damaged mitochondria cannot be
  removed efficiently through mitophagy, which contributes to PD. Also, A53T impairs
  autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells by upregulating mTOR signaling. E46K α-synuclein impairs
  autophagy via JNK1-Bcl-2 but not the mTOR pathway in PC12 and HEK293 cells. LRRK2
  can regulate autophagy either positively or negatively, while its molecular mechanism
  still remains unclear. According to a recent study, LRRK2 G2019S mutation can induce
  mitophagy by interacting with Bcl-2. Also, LRRK2 dysfunction may be upstream to
  α-synuclein. PINK1 or parkin is indispensable for the proper autophagic removal
  of damaged mitochondria. PINK1 accumulates specifically on damaged mitochondria.
  After PINK1 accumulation, PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin and Parkin to activate
  Parkin's E3 ligase activity. Once activated, Parkin facilitates the mitochondrial
  clearance via ubiquitylation of specific mitochondrial proteins thereby recruiting
  autophagic adapters, such as p62 to execute final autophagy. Mutations of PINK1
  and Parkin may impede mitophagy, cause the accumulation of defective mitochondria,
  potentially initiate apoptotic events, and ultimately lead to neurodegeneration
  in PD. In addition, PINK1 can enhance autophagy by interacting with Beclin-1. DJ-1
  can alter autophagy via NF-κB signaling. ATP13A2 is responsible for α-synuclein
  clearance via the lysosome, and a failure in this process would lead to the toxic
  accumulation of α-synuclein in the cytoplasm. miR-595 positively regulates ULK1
  thereby inducing autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells, while miR-4487 negatively regulates
  ULK1 and thus inhibiting autophagy, which may provide potential strategies for PD
  therapy.
