caption: Summary of metabolic FGFs. The metabolic FGFs are produced by specific tissues
  and signal in either an endocrine or autocrine/paracrine fashion to target cells
  through FGFR4 or FGFR1, complexed with or without β-klotho, to regulate metabolism.
  FGF15/19 signaling through hepatic FGFR4/β-klotho regulates the indicated hepatic
  processes (except glucose effectiveness which occurs through central effects), while
  the direct cellular targets of FGF21 through FGFR1/β-klotho signaling remain unclear.
  Endogenous FGF1 acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner to signal through FGFR1 independent
  of β-klotho. Although the metabolic FGFs possess different physiological functions,
  they produce similar pharmacological actions in models of metabolic disease through
  a common FGFR1-mediated pathway.
