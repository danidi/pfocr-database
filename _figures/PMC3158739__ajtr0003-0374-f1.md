caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of CDF driven pathway changes in BxPC-3
  cells. BxPc-3 cells were seeded in triplicate 100 mm plates and treated with CDF
  (500 nM) for 24 hrs. RNA was isolated using our previously published reports [,].
  Microarrays were run using the Human HT-12 microarrays. The microarray data was
  fed into the IPA software and networks were mapped under defined conditions as described
  elsewhere [,]. Note: activation of c-Myc hub.'
