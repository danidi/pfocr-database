caption: (A) Rb regulates multiple cellular processes, including cell cycle progression,
  apoptosis, DNA replication and repair, cellular differentiation and senescence.
  Rb binds to and represses E2F/DP transcription factor complexes. During the G1/S
  phase transition, Rb phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) results
  in dissociation of Rb from E2F/DP complexes. The derepressed E2F/DP complexes are
  free to initiate transcription of S phase-specific genes, thus allowing cell cycle
  progression. (B) NS5B interacts with Rb in the cytoplasm of HCV-infected cells,
  and recruits the E3-ubiquitin ligase E6AP to facilitate ubiquitylation of Rb. (C)
  Ubiquitylation targets Rb for proteasome mediated degradation. Loss of Rb results
  in dysregulation of the many processes that Rb controls. For example, the unscheduled
  activation of E2F/DP-dependent gene expression can compromise cell cycle checkpoints
  that guard against chromosomal instability as well as induce p53-dependent apoptosis.
