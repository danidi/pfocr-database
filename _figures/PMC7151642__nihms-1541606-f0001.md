caption: cGAS is an innate immune sensor that recognizes a diverse array of cytosolic
  dsDNA, which includes DNA with viral, apoptotic, exosomal, mitochondrial, micronuclei,
  and retroelement origins. cGAS oligomerizes with dsDNA in a 2:2 complex. The interaction
  of cGAS with DNA induces the formation of liquid droplets through phase transition,
  in which cGAS exerts its catalytic role to generate the second messenger 2’,3’-cGAMP.
  The presence of cGAMP stimulates STING at the ER, which undergoes higher-ordered
  tetramerization. STING translocates from the ER to Golgi compartments and is palmitoylated.
  STING serves as a signaling platform for TBK1 and IKK. TBK1 phosphorylates STING,
  which in turn recruits IRF3 for TBK1-mediated phosphorylation. Activated IRF3 dimerizes
  and translocates to the nucleus. IKK-mediated phosphorylation of the inhibitory
  IκB protein licenses nuclear entry of p50-RelA. Together with IRF3 in the nucleus,
  p50-RelA dimers stimulate the transcriptional expression of interferon and other
  immune-stimulatory genes. Artwork by Terry Helms, Graphics Department, MSKCC.
