caption: Intracellular GSH balance is maintained by de novo synthesis, regeneration
  from GSSG, and extracellular GSH uptake. In transport epithelial cells, such as
  enterocytes, γ-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) and dipeptidase (DP) catalyzed the hydrolysis
  of extracellular GSH to its constituent amino acids, glutamate, cysteine and glycine.
  Additionally, intestinal epithelial cells can import intact GSH from the lumen via
  specific plasma membrane transporters. Cytosolic synthesis of GSH takes place in
  two ATP-dependent reactions catalyzed by glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and glutathione
  synthase (GS). The intracellular GSH pool, present in millimolar concentrations,
  is involved in various GSH-dependent reactions. Compartmentation of GSH within the
  mitochondria, nucleus, or endoplasmic reticulum creates distinct and independently
  regulated subcellular redox pools. As part of the antioxidant defense system, GSH
  participates in conjugation reactions catalyzed by glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs),
  in the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) catalyzed
  by glutathione peroxidases (Gpxs), and the reduction of protein-disulfides (PrSSG)
  catalyzed by glutaredoxins (Grxs). The reduction of glutathione disulfide (GSSG)
  by glutathione reductase (GR) in the GSH redox cycle regenerates GSH. GSSG reduction
  occurs at the expense of NADPH, produced from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)
  from glucose oxidation.
