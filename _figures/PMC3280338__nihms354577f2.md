caption: 'a | Structure of the Drosophila melanogaster testis. The D. melanogaster
  male germline stem cell niche, located at the apical tip of the testis, hosts two
  kinds of stem cells: the germline stem cells (GSCs) and the somatic cyst stem cells
  (CySCs). The ‘hub’ cells at the apical tip are critical niche components. GSCs produce
  gonialblasts, which undergo synchronous divisions to generate spermatogonia and
  eventually mature sperm. CySCs generate somatic cyst cells, which surround the gonialblasts
  and maturing spermatogonia. b | A crucial signalling molecule from the hub is Unpaired
  (UPD), which activates the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of
  transcription (STAT) pathway in adjacent CySCs to promote their self-renewal by
  activating transcription factors ZFH1 (zinc-finger homeodomain 1) and CHINMO (chronologically
  inappropriate morphogenesis). In GSCs, the JAK–STAT pathway functions to facilitate
  their attachment to the hub via adherens junctions. In addition, the Bone morphogenic
  protein (BMP)–like molecules Decapentaplegic (DPP) and Glass bottom boat (GBB) are
  secreted from both the hub and the CySCs to activate BMP signalling in GSCs and
  repress the differentiation factor bag of marbles (bam). Together, this permits
  GSC self-renewal. c | In some cases, CySCs also generate cells that can contribute
  to the hub.'
