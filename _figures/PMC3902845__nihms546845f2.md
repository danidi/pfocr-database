caption: Multiple changes in gene expression influence KRAS activity, the KRAS downstream
  pathway and cell growth occur during development of a “mature” PDAC cell. RAS activity
  is still affected by upstream factors, but this component might be less important
  in the presence of a mutant form of KRAS. The downstream effectors of KRAS are highly
  activated and might eventually become independent of KRAS. Finally, expression of
  several regulators of cell cycle are altered in cancer cells; the cyclins listed
  in the figure are all expressed at levels exceeding those of normal pancreatic cells.
