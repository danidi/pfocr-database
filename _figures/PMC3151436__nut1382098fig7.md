caption: A schematic model depicting the potential preventative effects of RA against
  AP-1–dependent activation of COX-2 expression. Under the current model, several
  stimuli, including TPA, may activate signaling cascades that lead to the subsequent
  activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, including the ERK1/2. The
  ERK1/2 pathway contributes to the recruitment of members of the AP-1 factor, which
  comprises members of the Jun and Fos family of transcription factors, to the COX-2
  promoter. RA may exert preventative effects against the induction of COX-2 transcription
  by antagonizing the activation of ERK1/2 and the recruitment of AP-1 factors to
  the CRE harbored in the proximal COX-2 promoter. Arrows indicate activation and
  the bar indicates repression by RA. Thr-202 and Tyr-204 indicate phosphorylation
  sites on ERK1/2. The +1 indicates the initiation of transcription of the COX-2 gene.
