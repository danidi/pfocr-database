caption: Models for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. DNA DSBs are resected
  to generate 3′-protruding ends followed by formation of Rad51 filaments that invade
  into homologous template to form D-loop structures. (A) After priming DNA synthesis,
  three pathways can be invoked. In the DSBR pathway, the second end is captured and
  a dHJ intermediate is formed. (B) Resolution of dHJs can occur in either plane to
  generate crossover or non-crossover products. Alternatively, dHJs can be dissolved
  by the action of Sgs1–Top1–Rmi1 complex to generate only non-crossovers. In the
  SDSA pathway (C), the extended nascent strand is displaced, followed by pairing
  with the other 3′-single-stranded tail, and DNA synthesis completes repair. Nucleolytic
  trimming might be also required. In the third pathway of BIR (D), which can act
  when the second end is absent, the D-loop intermediate turns into a replication
  fork capable of both lagging and leading strand synthesis. Two other Rad51-independent
  recombinational repair pathways are also depicted. In SSA (E), extensive resection
  can reveal complementary sequences at two repeats, allowing annealing. The 3′-tails
  are removed nucleolytically and the nicks are ligated. SSA leads to the deletion
  of one of the repeats and the intervening DNA. Finally, the ends of DSB can be directly
  ligated resulting in NHEJ. (F) Newly synthesized DNA is represented by dashed lines.
