caption: Proposed pathway of kynurenine effects on BMSCs. Aging upregulates activity
  of IDO1 which converts tryptophan to kynurenine. Kynurenine is then taken up by
  BMSCs and binds to cytoplasmic AhR. Upon binding, ligand-bound AhR is transported
  into the nucleus where it forms a complex with Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear
  translocator (ARNT). The newly formed complex acts as a transcription factor and
  downregulates Hdac3 and CXCL12 transcription while upregulating miR-29b-1-5p. Hence,
  the overall effect of kynurenine and AhR complex is shifting from osteogenic to
  adipogenic differentiation in BMSCs. CXCL12 acts via a feedback regulation mechanism
  to downregulate IDO1 and AhR mRNA levels, while miR-29b-1-5p upregulates AhR mRNA
  level.
