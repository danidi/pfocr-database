caption: Inflammasome activation. Two signals are required for inflammasome activation.
  The first is “signal 1” or “priming signal”, which acts through NF-κB signaling
  pathway. The priming signal starts with binding of PAMPs (e.g., LPS) or DAMPs (e.g.,
  heat shock proteins) to TLR, IL-1β to IL-1R, or TNF-α to TNFR (see more details
  in Table ). Such receptor binding subsequently activates NF-κB signaling pathway
  by dissociating NF-κB from its inhibitor IκB and translocating NF-κB into the nucleus
  to upregulate expression of its target genes encoding NLRP3, pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18,
  and TNF-α. The second is “signal 2” or “activation signal”, which acts through the
  induction of PRRs by various PAMPs or DAMPs (see more details in Table ), resulting
  in recruitment of ASC and pro-caspase-1 to form inflammasome complex with such PRRs.
  Pro-caspase-1 is then cleaved to caspase-1 that subsequently converts pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 to IL-1β and IL-18, respectively, leading to secretion of IL-1β and
  IL-18. From both signals, the secreted IL-1β and TNF-α can potentiate activation
  of NF-κB signaling pathway and in turn increase their own production. In addition,
  caspase-1 cleaves gasdermin D and the N-terminal fragments of gasdermin D cause
  pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death.
