caption: Schematic representation of apoptosis or parthanatos cell-death pathways.
  (A) Schematic representation demonstrating intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis.
  The intrinsic pathway is initiated from within the cell usually in response to cellular
  signals resulting from DNA damage, hypoxia, or other types of severe cell stress.
  These signals stimulate proapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax) in the mitochondrial membrane
  leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, that allows translocation of
  cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol. Cytochrome
  c binds the adaptor apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (APAF-1), forming a large
  multiprotein structure known as the apoptosome. The initiator caspase 9 is recruited
  into the apoptosome and activates the downstream effector caspases 3. The extrinsic
  pathway begins outside the cell through the activation of specific proapoptotic
  receptors on the cell surface by specific molecules known as proapoptotic ligands.
  Such a ligand binding induces receptor clustering and recruitment of the adaptor
  protein Fas-associated death domain and the initiator caspases 8 as procaspases,
  facilitating their autocatalytic processing and release into the cytoplasm where
  they activate the effector caspases 3, thereby converging on the intrinsic pathway.
  One of these pathways (or both) may operate in determining death of glial cells
  in the spinal cord subjected to PM application (dysmetabolic insult). (B) Schematic
  representation showing the parthanatos pathway mediated by PARP-1 hyperactivation.
  Following excitotoxicity (kainate and glutamate receptor overactivity), intracellular
  increase in free Ca2+ activates downstream cascades leading to peroxynitrite formation.
  This readily induces DNA damage, thereby activating PARP-1 that initiates the synthesis
  of PAR. PAR interacts with the mitochondrial membrane to change its membrane potential,
  thus allowing AIF translocation to the nucleus, a process leading cell death. An
  additional lethal mechanism may originate from excessive PARP-1 activation to deplete
  the NAD pool and cause severe ATP starvation and cell energy failure with the outcome
  of cell death.
