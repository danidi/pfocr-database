caption: Potential mechanism of n-3 PUFA-mediated neuroprotection. 1, Under physiological
  conditions, Nrf2 is physically “locked” with Keap1, which leads to proteasomal degradation
  of Nrf2 via the Cul3 (E3)-dependent pathway. 2, Under oxidative stress conditions,
  such as brain ischemia and reperfusion, lipid oxidation produces α,β-unsaturated
  carbonyl electrophiles. n-3 PUFA-derived 4-HHE is more powerful than n-6 PUFA-derived
  4-HNE in electrophilicity. 3, Four-HHE covalently reacts with cysteine residues
  of Keap1, which causes conformational changes in Keap1, setting Nrf2 free. 4, Nrf2
  then accumulates, translocates into the nucleus, and binds the antioxidant response
  element (ARE) of phase 2 genes, leading to upregulation of HO-1 and other enzymes.
  5, HO-1 protects the brain against ischemic damage by breaking down heme into biliverdin
  (antioxidative) and carbon monoxide (CO; anti-inflammatory), reducing calcium overload
  and positive feedback on HO-1 expression. C, Cysteines; Cul3, cullin3; PLA2, phospholipase
  A2; Ub, ubiquitin.
