caption: An integrated model of signal transduction via the AT1R and resultant physiologic
  effects within the cardiovascular system. Upon agonist ligand (Ang II) binding to
  the AT1R, both G protein–dependent and G protein–independent signaling pathways
  are activated. The AT1R is principally coupled to Gαq, as illustrated, but may also
  couple to Gαi (not shown). Agonist-induced Gαq activation results in activation
  of phospholipase C (PLC), which catalyzes breakdown of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which respectively
  act to increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and to activate PKC. Proximally, a
  series of events results in the inhibition of initiation of Gαq-mediated signaling
  (desensitization). Agonist-ligand binding induces GRKs to catalyze cytoplasmic serine/threonine
  phosphorylation, which enhances binding of β-arrestin to the AT1R cytoplasmic tail;
  this sterically inhibits Gαq coupling to the AT1R. β-arrestin also serves as a scaffold
  for signaling effectors such as Src, resulting in downstream activation of cytoplasmic
  ERK. Also, as illustrated, AT1R induces activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Upon
  ligand stimulation, the multifunctional enzyme PI3K is recruited to the plasma membrane
  by interactions with GRK2 (). In addition to its protein kinase activity, PI3K functions
  to catalyze the conversion of PIP2 to phoshatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3)
  to promote 7TMR internalization (). Both G protein–dependent and –independent pathways
  have distinct physiologic and pathophysiologic effects, as shown. The acute physiologic
  effects of G protein–independent signaling via AT1R as well as the chronic physiologic
  effects of G protein–independent signaling on ventricular function and systemic/pulmonary
  hemodynamics are unknown. The novel physiologic findings of Zhai et al. () are each
  listed and indicated with an asterisk.
