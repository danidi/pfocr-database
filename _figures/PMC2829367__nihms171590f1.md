caption: 'Hypothetical function of mT1-mmP homodimer and heterodimer formation on
  proteolytic activity, cell migration and proliferation: The hemopexin (PeX) domain
  of mT1-mmP interacts with CD44 or an unknown protein (heterodimer) at the cell surface,
  which signals for cell migration through maPK, PI3K and rac pathways, possibly involving
  initial activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (rTK) and ras. maPK also signals
  to the nucleus leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (emT) by enhancing Twist-1
  and Snail activation. enhanced activity of PI3K or Wnt signaling pathways leads
  to inhibition of GSK-3β, an important regulator for β-catenin and Snail. Inhibition
  of GSK-3β results in transcriptional downregulation of IκB, and hence enhances activity
  of nFκB and subsequent Snail expression. mT1-mmP also forms homodimers at the cell
  surface which is critically important for the enzymatic activity of mT1-mmP. Cleavage
  of cell-cell adherens junction molecule, e-cadherin by mT1-mmP leads to dissociation
  of the e-cadherin-β-catenin complex and results in β-catenin relocation. β-catenin
  relocation to nucleus serves as a transcription factor along with TCF to upregulate
  gene expression for cell proliferation. Positive and negative feedback loops involving
  mT1-mmP and e-cadherin maintain the aggressive character of emT cancer cells. mT1-mmP
  also cleaves prommP-2, most of extracellular matrix (eCm) components, growth factors,
  and cell surface receptors. Both proteolytic activity and non-proteolytic activity
  of mT1-mmP coordinate to promote cancer emT. other control mechanisms for mT1-mmP
  function in cells involve enzyme activation by furin in the trans Golgi network
  and an elaborate endocytic pathway (not shown).'
