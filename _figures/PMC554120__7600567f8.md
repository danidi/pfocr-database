caption: Model for the inhibition of Myt1 in the meiotic and mitotic cell cycles in
  Xenopus. In the meiotic cell cycle, p90rsk, the downstream kinase of the Mos–MAPK
  pathway, interacts with and phosphorylates Myt1, thereby inhibiting its activity.
  During this period, Myt1 is also phosphorylated on the Plx1-docking site (Thr478)
  by Cdc2, but its interaction with Plx1 is largely inhibited by p90rsk-mediated phosphorylation.
  After fertilization, however, p90rsk is inactivated due to the degradation of Mos,
  allowing Myt1 to interact with Plx1 via the Cdc2-phosphorylated Thr478 residue.
  Consequently, in embryonic mitosis, Plx1 can phosphorylate Myt1 (at as-yet-unidentified
  sites) and thereby inhibit its activity. The inhibition of the Plx1–Myt1 interaction
  in the meiotic cell cycle may allow a preferential binding of Plx1 to Cdc25C, resulting
  in strong activation and maintenance of Cdc2 activity during oocyte maturation.
  In the mitotic cell cycles, however, Plx1 may play a key role in the amplification
  loop of Cdc2 activation through both Cdc25C activation and Myt1 inhibition. KD,
  kinase domain; PBD, Polo-box domain;  phosphorylation. See also Discussion.
