caption: The aerobic biosynthesis of adenosylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide from uroporphyrinogen
  III. The individual steps along the aerobic route for cobalamin synthesis are shown.
  Initially, uroporphyrinogen III undergoes three methylation steps at C2, C7, and
  C20, before hydroxylation at the C20 position generates precorrin-3B, a masked pinacol
  that is primed for ring contraction through rearrangement. The contraction is mediated
  by CobJ, which also methylates at C17. More methylations, a decarboxylation, and
  a mutase reaction generate the orange-colored hydrogenobyrinic acid (HBA) intermediate.
  Cobalt insertion followed by adenosylation and amidation of the side chains generates
  adenosylcobyrinic acid a,c-diamide, the point where the aerobic and anaerobic (see  and
  ) pathways rejoin. The gray shading surrounding Uroporphyrinogen III coordinates
  with other pathway figures and the summary in .
