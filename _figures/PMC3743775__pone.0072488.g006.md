caption: 'After binding pathogenic products, TLR signaling involves cross-linking
  of adapter proteins, such as MyD88 (1) and TRIF (2), activation of NFКB-dependent/-independent
  (IRF3) pathways, and phosphorylation of multiple signaling molecules, including
  STAT-1 and STAT-3. Phosphorylated STAT-1 activates transcription/translation of
  IL-12 (3); whereas STAT-3 phosphorylation activates IL-23 but inhibits IL-12 expressions
  (4). In the case of chronic infections (such as HCV and HIV), pathogens may up-regulate
  Tim-3 expression on M/MΦ and Gal-9 expression by other cells, facilitating Tim-3/Gal-9
  trans- association and so impairing innate immune responses. More specifically,
  extracellular Gal-9 trans association with Tim-3 expressed on the surface of M/MΦ,
  triggers Tim-3-SH2 tyrosine (Y265) phosphorylation by interleukin inducible T cell
  kinase (ITK), delivering negative signaling to TLR-mediated STAT-1 phosphorylation
  (5), and positive signaling to TLR-induced STAT-3 activation (6), resulting in inhibition
  of IL-12 but promotion of IL-23 productions. Imbalanced IL-23/IL-12 favors the differentiation
  of TH2, TH17, and Treg cells that contribute to the development of chronic infection
  and autoimmune disorders. In the case of acute infection (such as self-limited HCV),
  TLR signaling may activate Gal-9 and Tim-3 cis association within the same M/MΦ
  (7) and yield adequate inflammatory cytokine expressions. Moreover, intracellular
  Gal-9 expressions can modulate M/MΦ Tim-3 and IL-12/IL-23 gene transcriptions (8).
  Upon TLR stimulation, intracellular Gal-9 rapidly translocates into nuclei, binds
  to NF-IL6 but not NFКB, and triggers IL-1β and IFN-γ transcriptions31 (9). Intracellular
  Gal-9 also inhibits STAT3 but not STAT-1 phosphorylation, leading to increased IL-12
  and decreased IL-23 gene transcriptions. However, intracellular Gal-9 appears to
  reduce Tim-3 cell surface expression by two distinct mechanisms: cis association/internalization
  and transcriptional inhibition, through a STAT-3-independent but possibly T-bet-dependent
  pathway (10). Appropriate TLR signaling in innate immune cells may thus facilitate
  proper adaptive immune responses to successfully clear the acute infection. Based
  on this schematic model, therapeutic strategies manipulating Tim-3/Gal-9 trans and/or
  cis association might be of clinical benefit.'
