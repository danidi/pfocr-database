caption: 'Shown are key factors mediating the three known pathways of high-affinity
  iron uptake in this organism: reductive iron uptake, siderophore-iron uptake, and
  hemoglobin-iron uptake. Gene families encode ferric reductases and multicopper oxidases
  of the reductive pathway, and only a subset are expressed in an iron-dependent fashion.
  Ccc2 is a copper transporter required for proper assembly and function of Fet3/iron
  permease complexes. Genes for each depicted protein are directly activated by Sef1,
  and genes for Ftr1, Sit1, and Rbt5 are directly repressed by Sfu1.'
