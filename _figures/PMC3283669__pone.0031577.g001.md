caption: Arrows represent activation and cross-bars represent inhibition. The TOR,
  PKA and Sch9 pathways transmit nutrient signals to Gis1, Msn2 and Msn4 by controlling
  the nuclear localization of the Rim15 protein kinase, but there is evidence that
  the PKA and Sch9 pathways also transmit signals that are independent of Rim15. Gis1,
  Msn2 and Msn4 activate gene expression through PDS and STRE motifs in the promoters
  of their target genes. The DNA damage checkpoint pathway inhibits Gis1 and Rph1,
  which repress the PHR1 gene through a STRE motif in its promoter. Our results presented
  here show that Rph1 also functions together with Gis1 downstream of the nutrient
  sensing pathways.
