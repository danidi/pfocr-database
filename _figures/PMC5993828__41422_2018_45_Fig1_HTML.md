caption: 'GAPDH is a target for dimethyl fumarate. Following activation, innate and
  adaptive immune cells increase glucose uptake to fuel aerobic glycolysis, an essential
  step for their activation and effector functions, and GAPDH represents a rate-limiting
  enzyme in this pathway. Engagement of glycolysis favors the generation of pro-inflammatory
  immune cell subsets such as M1-polarized macrophages, Th1 and Th17 cells. DMF and
  MMF both alter the functionality of GAPDH, by inducing succination of Cys-152 in
  the enzyme active site. This modification inactivates GAPDH, causing a block in
  glycolysis, an increase in OXPHOS, the development of anti-inflammatory immune cell
  subsets such as Tregs and M2-polarized macrophages, and an overall inhibition of
  the inflammatory response. Abbreviations not present in the main text: TCR T-cell
  receptor, Cys cysteine, 2SC S-(2-succino)cysteine, Mϕ macrophage'
