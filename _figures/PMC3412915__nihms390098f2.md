caption: A schematic of calcium signaling pathways in osteocytes investigated in present
  study. The increase of Ca2+ intensity in cytoplasm has two major sources, the extracellular
  Ca2+ in medium and intracellular calcium store in ER. Ion channels, such as voltage
  gated calcium channels, ligand gated ion channels and stretch-activated ion channels
  can transfer Ca2+ between intra- and extracellular environments. The calcium in
  ER store can be released by activation of IP3 sensitive channels. [Ca2+]isignaling
  in bone cells can induce ATP release through hemi-channels on membrane. ATP can
  further activate the purinergic receptors which are correlated with PLC and IP3pathway.
  Gap junction between neighboring cells provides a physical channel for small molecules
  (e.g., IP3 and Ca2+) to diffuse between two connected cells. As two of the essential
  signaling pathways involved in bone mechanotransduction, PGE2 and NO pathways were
  investigated to identify their correlations with mechanical loading induced [Ca2+]i
  responses.
