caption: Schematic presentation of mechanisms of actions of CTS. CTS abrogates the
  actions of TNF-α-mediated inhibition of skeletal muscle differentiation (SMD). IGF-I
  (IGF1) stimulates muscle differentiation by activating the phosphoinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)-phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3)-Akt pathway, triggering
  MyoD-MEF2 transactivational capacity. The expression and synergistic interaction
  of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, MYOD1 and MYOG, and the MEF2 family
  of proteins regulate sequential steps in myogenesis, resulting in the induction
  of muscle-restricted target genes such as MYHC, myosin light chains, and TPM1. On
  the contrary, TNF-α induces expression of proinflammatory molecules like NOS2A,
  TNF-α, and TNF-R1 via the NF-κB pathway and, in parallel, inhibits MYOD1 and MYOG
  expression and/or protein loss, consequently blocking the expression of muscle-specific
  proteins. CTS abrogates the TNF-α-induced expression of NOS2A synthesis (1), upregulates
  MYOD1 and MYOG induction (2), and activates the Akt pathway (3). Thus, mechanical
  signals, by inhibiting inflammation and upregulating skeletal muscle differentiation,
  act as potent reparative signals during inflammation. IGFR, IGF receptor.
