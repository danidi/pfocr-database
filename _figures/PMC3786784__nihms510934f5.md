caption: Aminoacylated-tRNA donor molecules are generated by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
  (aaRS, shown in red). Typically the aminoacylated-tRNA product of the aaRS catalyzed
  reaction is bound by elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) and delivered to the ribosome
  (shown in green) for use in protein synthesis. Cyclodipeptide synthases (blue) must
  hijack certain aminoacylated tRNA species and divert them into the cyclodipeptide
  biosynthesis pathway. Putative steps in the pathway are shown in italics. Reproduced
