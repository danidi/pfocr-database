caption: Intracellular effects of soluble mediators are mainly mediated through the
  interaction with specific receptors that link extracellular signals up to modulation
  of gene expression. GLP-1 signaling pathway is activated after the binding to its
  receptor, GLP-1R, and subsequent transactivation of the EGFR. GLP-1's effects on
  beta-cell are mainly mediated by the cAMP signaling pathway. GLP-1 potentiates glucose-induced
  insulin secretion, improves the function of pancreatic beta-cells by promoting neogenesis
  and proliferation and by decreasing apoptosis signals, increases antioxidant defense,
  promotes insulin gene transcription, mRNA stability, and biosynthesis, and increases
  the expression of Pdx-1 and the binding of Pdx-1 to the insulin promoter. Exendin
  4, a GLP-1R agonist, potentiates expression of gene products subjected to the UPR
  in response to ER stress, stimulates GK expression, and prevents depletion of SERCA
  expression. Metformin enhances the expression of GLP-1R, via a peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor- (PPAR-) α-dependent mechanism, and improves the responsiveness to incretins.
  The thiazolidinediones (TDZs) act by activating the nuclear receptors PPARγ. TDZs
  preserve pancreatic beta-cell mass and improve their function, prevent NF-κB activation,
  improve insulin secretory capacity in patients with diabetes, protect human islets
  against apoptosis, and maintain the homeostasis of intracellular Ca2+ preventing
  the loss of SERCA. Extracellular signaling is mediated by cytosolic molecules which
  can be enzymes, ions, and so on. The PI3K/Akt signaling is a converging pathway
  in the regulation of beta-cell mass by growth factors, insulin, incretins, and glucose.
  The health of the beta-cell is also related to the maintenance of its homeostasis
  during its intensive function. The UPR restores ER homeostasis by decreasing ER
  protein load and increasing ER folding capacity. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration
  is important for GSIS, and also for ER function. The enzyme GK, which is considered
  a “glucose sensor” in pancreatic beta-cells, regulates pancreatic beta cell mass
  as well as their function. The temporally fluctuating activation of stress signaling
  is required for the maintenance of beta-cell survival, whereas its persistent activation
  results in beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis. Indeed, ROS generation is not only
  a harmful process but, rather, plays a substantial role in the normal insulin signal
  transduction and is one of the metabolic signals stimulating insulin secretion.
  The ROS levels need to be finely regulated to keep good radicals from going bad
  thus avoiding oxidative damages. The ratio of the oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG)
  and the reduced form (GSH) is a dynamic indicator of the oxidative stress. The cellular
  adaptive response to oxidative stress is finely regulated by Nrf2, which upregulates
  transcription of antioxidant and phase II detoxification enzymes. Regulation of
  gene transcription is regulated at different biological levels. Recently, miRNAs
  target genes emerged important for pancreas development, beta-cell proliferation,
  insulin secretion, and exocytosis. Interestingly, as expression of the transcription
  factors implicated in the regulation of insulin transcription, such as MafA, Pdx-1,
  and FoxO1, are controlled by the relationship between themselves for instance, FoxO1
  and PDX-1 bind directly to the MafA promoter and mediate MafA transcription, and
  transcription of the gene coding for PDX-1 is negatively regulated by the binding
  of FoxO1 to the PDX-1 promoter.
