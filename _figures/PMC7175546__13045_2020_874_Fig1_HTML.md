caption: Participation of WEE1 kinases (Cdk1 inhibitors) and CDC25 phosphatases (Cdk1
  activators) in the regulation of the activity of Cdk1 kinase during G2 and M phases.
  The binding of WEE1 kinases to 14-3-3 protein, which activates WEE1 kinases, may
  be carried out in two different ways—via the phosphorylation of ser642 (with participation
  of CHK1) or autophosphorylation. WEE1 inhibitor abrogates the G2/M checkpoint, resulting
  in cancer cell death
