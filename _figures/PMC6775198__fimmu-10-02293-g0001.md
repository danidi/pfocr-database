caption: Role of Wnt Proteins in T cells. (i) The differentiation of naïve CD8+ T
  cells into CD8+ T effector cells is inhibited, the development of memory precursor
  and central memory CD8+ T cells is promoted, and the expansion is stimulated by
  TCF-1. Naïve CD8+ T cells are resistant to becoming CD8 effector T cells if they
  are TCF-1high cells, whereas TCF-1low cells become active IFN-γ+ T-bet+ effector
  T cells. WNT/β-catenin-mediated activation of effector CD8+ T cells can stimulate
  the transcription of TCF-1, which inhibits type I IFN-mediated cell exhaustion.
  (ii) The differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells is inhibited
  and differentiation into Th2 and Tfh subsets is promoted by TCF-1. Unlike TCF-1,
  all types of T cell differentiation and function are enhanced by the expression
  of β-catenin. The transcription of TCF-1 is inhibited by T-bet, which is the Th1
  hallmark transcription factor, thus preventing the inhibition of T-bet-mediated
  transcription of IFN-γ. Beta-catenin activation enhances memory Th1 cell formation.
  In Th2 cells, the transcription of GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA-3) can be induced
  by β-catenin. GATA-3 stimulates the expression of IL-4, which can bind IL-4R and
  suppress transcription of the short form of TCF-1 via STAT6. In Th17 cells, IL-17
  transcription can be suppressed by TCF-1 directly. Wnt signaling activation inhibits
  the transcription of TGF-βRI, II, and III, which has an important effect on Th17
  differentiation. Upon β-catenin activation, RORγt transcription can be increased
  by TCF-1 directly. TCF-1 promotes Tfh differentiation by increasing Bcl-6 expression
  and inhibiting the transcription of Blimp-1 and IL2RA. (iii) TCF-1 inhibits the
  Treg cell-mediated suppression of effector T cell (Teff) proliferation. In the absence
  of WNT, the transcriptional repressor Foxp3 inhibits many genes including IL-2.
  TCF-1 activity is prioritized over Foxp3 when WNT is present, which results in the
  expression of various transcriptional targets shared by Foxp3 and TCF-1. TCF-1,
  T-cell factor 1; IFN-γ, interferon gamma; GATA3, GATA binding protein 3; IL-4, interleukin
  4; TGFβRI, transforming growth factor beta receptor I; TGFβRII, transforming growth
  factor beta receptor II; TGFβRIII, transforming growth factor beta receptor III;
  Blimp-1, B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1; IL2RA, interleukin 2 receptor
  alpha.
