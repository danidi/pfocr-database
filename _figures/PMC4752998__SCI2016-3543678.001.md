caption: The epithelial/mesenchymal status of MCs is due to the balance of signals
  delivered by multiple receptors. Stimuli promoting EMT are delivered by TGF-β in
  cooperation with inflammatory cytokines and other mediators such as IL-1β, IL-6,
  TLR ligands, AGEs, and angiotensin. Smad2/3 pathway plays a main role in combination
  with ERK1/2 and NF-κB pathway and all converge on the expression of Snail, the master
  gene of EMT. Integrin activation promotes the induction of conformational changes
  and the invasivity of MCs. On the other hand, signals delivered by BMP7 and HGF
  favor the epithelial phenotype through the activation of Smad1/5/8 and the inhibition
  of the Smad2/3 signaling. Also, signals delivered by cell-to-cell confluency (E-cadherin
  omotypic junctions) may lead to predominance of p38 MAPK over ERK1/2 and to the
  inhibition of NF-κB activity. Caveolin-1 organizes signaling platforms favoring
  the stability of membrane receptors and inhibiting the Ras/MEK/ERK1/2 pathway.
