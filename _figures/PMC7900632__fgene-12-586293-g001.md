caption: 'iSO595 is an updated reconstruction of Prochlorococcus marinus MED4, featuring
  a complete Entner–Doudoroff pathway, rewired glycogen metabolism and increased coverage
  of the genome. The central panel is a simplified illustration covering the most
  relevant metabolic features. (A) To simulate the natural environmental constraints
  experienced by Prochlorococcus we use “Push-FBA”: Light and bicarbonate uptake are
  given a fixed flux independent of growth rate. This contrasts standard FBA where
  light and bicarbonate would be “pulled” in by the demand needed to support maximal
  growth rate up to a given bound. (B) We rewired the glycogen metabolism in iSO595
  to study the dynamic allocation the dynamic allocation of glycogen. (C) Additionally,
  we implemented dynamic light conditions and light absorption in COMETS to simulate
  the growth of P. marinus during the diel cycle. (D) iSO595 has increased coverage
  both in terms of genes, reactions and metabolites compared to its ancestor iJC568.'
