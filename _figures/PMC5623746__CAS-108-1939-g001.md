caption: Activation of various oncogenic proteins in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
  can induce malignant transformation. (a) Introduction of various oncogenic proteins
  (FLI‐1/EWS, FUS/CHOP, and synovial sarcoma translocated protein [SYT‐SSX1]) into
  MSCs may cause transformation of these cells into malignant sarcoma cells. (b) C‐X‐C
  motif chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) signaling pathway stimulates the transformation
  of MSCs into cancer‐associated fibroblasts. (c) Cell fusion between MSCs and gastric
  mucosal cells under Helicobacter pylori infection increases the risk of developing
  gastric carcinoma.
