caption: When 4NQO is quickly metabolized in the squamous epithelial cells by NQO1,
  the ultimate carcinogen (4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide, 4HAQO) causes gene mutations.
  Meanwhile, metabolism by glutathione transferases (GSTs) results in glutathione
  (GSH) depletion in these cells as well, and generates ROS which also produces oxidative
  damages and gene mutations. These gene mutations are presumably the driving force
  leading to SCC in mouse tongue. As a protective response, 4NQO-GSH conjugate is
  expected to be eliminated through multidrug resistant protein (MRP), and ROS activates
  the Nrf2 pathway which regulates antioxidative stress genes such as MT1, HO1, superoxide
  dismutase (SOD) and catalase. It is known that NQO1, GSTs, MRP, SOD, catalase are
  all transcriptionally regulated by NRF2. Based on this proposed mechanism, the 4NQO-induced
  oral carcinogenesis model in mice shares the same mechanism of oxidative damage
  as human oral carcinogenesis. SFN, which acts as a chemopreventive agent for 4NQO-induced
  oral carcinogenesis in mouse tongue through NRF2 and the isothiocyanate moiety,
  is therefore potentially effective for chemoprevention of human oral cancer.
