caption: Proposed lithium’s neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia. The
  neuroprotective effects of lithium against cerebral ischemia are proposed to result
  from its interactions with cell survival and apoptotic machinery. A significant
  portion of brain damage following cerebral ischemia is caused by an increase in
  extracellular glutamate and subsequent over-stimulation of NMDA receptor-mediated
  toxic increase in intracellular calcium. This signaling pathway plays a critical
  role in mediating glutamate-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. Lithium at
  therapeutically relevant concentrations inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated calcium
  influx, which in turn decreases subsequent activation of JNK, p38 kinase, and transcription
  factor AP-1. Inhibition of intracellular calcium increase also attenuates the activity
  of calpain and calpain-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic Cdk5/p25 kinase. On
  the other hand, lithium can directly and indirectly reduce the activity of constitutively
  activated GSK-3 by multiple mechanisms, leading to disinhibition of several transcription
  factors, such as CREB and HSF-1, and resulting in induction of major cytoprotective
  proteins such as BDNF, VEGF, MMP-9, HSP70, and Bcl-2. A decrease in GSK-3 activity
  further reduces the activity of pro-apoptotic protein p53 and its downregulating
  effect on Bcl-2. BDNF, via activating its cell surface receptor and the down-stream
  ERK and PI3-kinase/Akt pathways, induces neuroprotective effects in part by inhibiting
  GSK-3 and stimulating CREB. Induction of BDNF is an early and essential step for
  neuroprotection and is involved in lithium-induced neurogenesis. In addition, superinduction
  of HSP70 by lithium treatment not only inhibits brain ischemia-induced apoptosis,
  but also contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of lithium through inactivation
  of NF-κB. Counteraction of GSK-3 inhibition of VEGF and MMP-9 by lithium enhances
  angiogenesis and neurovascular remodeling. MMP-9 is also a key molecule involved
  in potentiating MSCs migration by lithium. Improvement in transplanted MSCs migration
  toward ischemic sites might increase neurogenesis as well. Taken together, these
  effects of lithium in reducing apoptosis, suppressing inflammation, enhancing angiogenesis
  and neurogenesis, contribute to behavioral improvement and functional recovery after
  ischemia. Lines with solid arrows represent stimulatory connections; lines with

  description: Proposed lithium’s neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia.
    The neuroprotective effects of lithium against cerebral ischemia are proposed
    to result from its interactions with cell survival and apoptotic machinery. A
    significant portion of brain damage following cerebral ischemia is caused by an
    increase in extracellular glutamate and subsequent over-stimulation of NMDA receptor-mediated
    toxic increase in intracellular calcium. This signaling pathway plays a critical
    role in mediating glutamate-induced caspase activation and apoptosis. Lithium
    at therapeutically relevant concentrations inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated calcium
    influx, which in turn decreases subsequent activation of JNK, p38 kinase, and
    transcription factor AP-1. Inhibition of intracellular calcium increase also attenuates
    the activity of calpain and calpain-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic Cdk5/p25
    kinase. On the other hand, lithium can directly and indirectly reduce the activity
    of constitutively activated GSK-3 by multiple mechanisms, leading to disinhibition
    of several transcription factors, such as CREB and HSF-1, and resulting in induction
    of major cytoprotective proteins such as BDNF, VEGF, MMP-9, HSP70, and Bcl-2.
    A decrease in GSK-3 activity further reduces the activity of pro-apoptotic protein
    p53 and its downregulating effect on Bcl-2. BDNF, via activating its cell surface
    receptor and the down-stream ERK and PI3-kinase/Akt pathways, induces neuroprotective
