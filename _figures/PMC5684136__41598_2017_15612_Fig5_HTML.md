caption: Intermediates of tricarboxylic acid pathway (TCA). Variation in the levels
  of metabolic intermediates in Kreb’s cycle. It was interrupted at succinate production
  with a decrease in fumarate and malate levels, and down-regulation of FUMH, MDHM
  and succinate dehydrogenase enzymes (black arrow). Values are mean ± SD (n = 9)
  of normogravity (white columns) and microgravity (black columns) metabolites. Statistical
  significance was indicated by *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
