caption: 'Distribution, variety, and frequency of fusion events in riboflavin biosynthesis.
  Riboflavin gene fusions and identification are given in (Additional file : Tables
  S2 A and B). Pathway enzymes are shown as yellow boxes and their abbreviations are
  given in the central bottom panel. The domain name is given in parentheses inside
  each yellow box. Fusion partners are listed in the white boxes immediately below
  the corresponding pathway enzyme. Of these, domains of the riboflavin pathway are
  in black font and unknown domains or domains belonging to other pathways are in
  blue font. Compounds are shown in ovals. Their abbreviations are given in the left
  bottom panel. Highly reactive compounds are marked with a red oval. Participation
  in triple fusion events is flagged with colored squares inserted in the white boxes
  of the corresponding enzymes. The identification code for these squares is given
  in the bottom right panel. The variety of fusions of each riboflavin gene is shown
  on the top left insert. This variety is represented by a color range where the number
  of binary fusion events in which each gene participates (see Additional file : Table
  S2B), is proportional to the orange color intensity. The frequency of fusions of
  each riboflavin gene is displayed on the top right insert. This frequency is expressed
  as a percentage and it was calculated as described in Methods. It is represented
  by a color range where the ratio for each riboflavin gene mentioned above is proportional
  to the blue color intensity. Enzymes that participate in only a few fusions are
  colored grey in both inserts'
