caption: 'Proposed mechanism for RPG in regulating the uterine involution in post-natal
  dairy cows. The effect of RPG addition was mediated by both IGFs and mTOR/AKT signaling
  pathways. RPG addition might promote IGF1 and IGF2 binding to their respective receptors
  and enhance IGF-independent actions of IGFBPs, thereby activating the mTOR/AKT signaling
  pathway and accelerating the endometrial proliferation and repair. Each ligand displayed
  a specific binding affinity for the receptors: continuous arrows indicate high affinity,
  while dotted arrows and a red “X” indicates low affinity. The black dashed arrows
  are currently unknown.'
