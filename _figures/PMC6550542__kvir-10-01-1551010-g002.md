caption: Interplay between enteroviruses and the host autophagy pathway. Major members
  of enteroviruses have been shown to subvert the host autophagy machinery at different
  phases of viral life cycle to enhance viral growth and for immune escape. (1) Viral
  entry. Autophagy core proteins benefit echovirus 7 entry, likely through regulation
  of the endocytic pathway. During PV, CVB1, and CVB3 infection, PLA2G16 is recruited
  to the fragmented endosome to antagonize the function of galectin-8 in initiating
  autophagic degradation of viral RNA genome. (2) Viral replication. Autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion is blocked during CVB3, PV, and EV-D68 infection through viral protease 3C-induced
  cleavage of SNAP29. Accumulation of autophagosomes appears to favor viral replication
  by offering replication membranes for PV, CVB3, EV-D68, and EV-A71. (3) Viral maturation.
  Formation of acidified amphisomes is required for EV (e.g., PV, EV-D68, EV-A71)
  maturation to generate infectious viruses. (4) Viral release through AWOL. EVs (e.g.,
  PV, EV-D68, EV-A71, CVB3, and HRV2) utilize autophagosomes as envelopes for non-lytic
  viral exit. (4) Immune evasion. Autophagy receptor SQSTM1 is cleaved by viral protease
  2A during CVB3, PV, EV-D68, and HRV1A infection (cleavage of NBR1 is also observed
  during CVB3 infection) to counteract virophagy-mediated clearance of viral particles/components.
  CALCOCO2 exhibits a pro-viral function toward CVB3 via inhibiting type I IFN signaling.
  Enhanced autophagy during EV-A71 and CVA16 infection was shown to benefit viruses
  by suppressing TLR7-mediated type I IFN signaling. PV, poliovirus; CVB, coxsackievirus
  B; CVA, coxsackievirus A; EV, enterovirus; HRV, human rhinovirus; SNAP29, synaptosomal-associated
  protein 29; SQSTM1, sequestosome 1, NBR1, neighbor of BRCA1; CALCOCO2, calcium binding
  and coiled-coil domain-containing protein 2; AWOL, autophagosome-mediated exit without
  lysis; IFN, interferon.
