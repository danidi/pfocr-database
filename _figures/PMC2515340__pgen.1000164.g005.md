caption: 'Photorespiration occurs in three organelles: the chloroplast, the peroxisome,
  and the mitochondria. Ammonia association pathway is tightly linked to photorespiration
  for recycling ammonia, byproduct of photorespiration. Rubisco activase 1 (Rca1)
  commits photorespiration by helping to incorporate O2 to active site of ribulose
  bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RUBISCO) and ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) is
  oxidized to 3-phosphoglycerate (glycerate 3-P) and 2-phosphoglycolate (glycolate
  2-P). Then, glycolate 2-P is converted to glycine by a series of reactions: 2-phosphoglycolate
  phosphatase1 (PGP1), glycolate oxidase (GLO1) serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase
  (SGAT). The decarboxylation of two glycines produces serine, CO2 and NH3 by glycine
  decarboxlasse complex (GDC) and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 1 (SHMT1, P5-1).
  In addition, gulatamate dehydrogenase (GDH) in mitochondria deaminates glutamate
  and generates 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) and NH3 needed for ammonia assimilation (GS2/Fd-GOGAT
  cycle). SGAT also generates 2-OG from glutamate. Glutamate is supplied from chloroplast
  by glutamine synthase 2 (GS2) and ferredoxin dependant glutamine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase
  (Fd-GOGAT, U11) in ammonia assimilation, and glutamate/malate transporter (DiT2).
  Function of U5 gene product is suggested to transport 2-oxoglutarate to chloroplast.
  Serine is further converted to 3-phosphoglycerate by hydroxypyruvate dehydrogenase
  (HPDH1) and glycerate kinase (GLK). Photorespiration consumes CO2 and energy (ATP)
  in photosynthetic cells. Photosynthetic light reaction carried out by photosysntem
  I (PSI) and photsystem II (PSII, U3) supplies O2, ATP and reduncing powers (reduced
  ferredoxin form, Fdrd). Nitrate (NO3−) is another source of nitrogen for plant growth
  and nitrate assimilation pathway is alternative way to provide ammonia for GS2/Fd-GOGAT
  cycle. Nitrate reductase 1 (NR1, P9-1) commits this pathway. U4 is suggested to
  have roles in transcriptional regulation of nitrate assimilation pathway. Glycerate
  3-P resulted from photorespiration goes into Calvin cycle for the CO2 fixation.
  Carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1, P2-1) might be involved in CO2 fixation in RuBP. Black
  circles indicate the steps in the pathway which are related to mutants identified
  in this study. Question marks (?) indicate genes of unknown function (U4 and U5).
  Purple lines indicate genes belonging to co-expressed cluster III; blue, cluster
  IV; yellow, cluster V; bright blue, cluster VIII; pure cyan, cluster IX; and dried
  sage, cluster X in . Weak gray lines indicate steps in each pathway not associated
  with data collected in this study.'
