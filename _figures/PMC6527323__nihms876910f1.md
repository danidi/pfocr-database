caption: Autophagy is regulated by the Akt-mTOR signaling cascade which negatively
  regulates the activity of the Atg1 kinase complex. The pathway is often artificially
  manipulated with chemical inhibitors such as rapamycin (induction) and 3-methyladenine
  (3-MA; repression). Once induced, the activated class III phosphatidylinositol kinase
  (PtdIns3K) complex attracts additional autophagy proteins (e.g. LC3-II) to the growing
  phagophore through the release of phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate (PI(3)p). The
  selective autophagy receptor p62 binds to ubiquitin chains conjugated to viral proteins
  such as alphavirus capsid proteins. These complexes interact with the membrane anchored
  LC3-II proteins thereby immobilizing the viral cargo within the growing autophagosome.
  Subsequently, mature autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes which facilitate acidification
  of the autophagolysosomes and degradation of the contents. A number of arboviruses
  can induce autophagy by blocking the activity of Akt. This occurs through a number
  mechanisms including direct inhibition (flavivirus NS4A/NS4B), signal transduction
  (vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) ((?) demarcates
  conflicting reports), or viral-induced ER-stress. The results of this induction
  can either be beneficial, detrimental or both. Autophagy functions in an antiviral
  capacity during VSV, RVFV and alphavirus infection and certain aspects of autophagy,
  such as p62 facilitated degradation and FAM134B-mediated reticulophagy, antagonize
  flavivirus replication. However, flaviviruses (e.g. DENV) also benefit from elevated
  levels of available ATP via increased lipid metabolism and autophagy-associated
  virion maturation. While this is the current working model of arbovirus-autophagy
  interactions in mammals, many unknowns remain. Further, it is unclear how well this
  will translate to autophagy-arbovirus infection of mosquitoes.
