caption: 'TLS synthesis in ICL repair by Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway: replicative
  DNA polymerase stalls upon encounter of an interstrand crosslink (ICL) in DNA. FA
  core complex (FANC-A, B, C, E, F, G, L and M) and associated proteins (FAAP20, FAAP24,
  FAAP100) are activated and recruited to the ICL site where, FANCL serves as E3-ligase,
  and monoubiquitinates FANCI-D2 heterodimer. Monoubiquitinated FANCI-D2 complex is
  recruited to the chromatin and recruits FAN1 nuclease to sites of damage. ICLs are
  incised and unhooked by the action of several structure specific endonucleases;
  MUS81-EME1, SNM1A, FAN1, XPF-ERCC1 and SLX1-SLX4. Complete repair of ICL is mediated
  by co-ordinated action of TLS and HR processes. FAAP20 interacts with the FA core
  complex and binds to monoubiquitinated REV1. FAAP20 may direct REV1 and Pol ζ to
  the unhooked crosslink to catalyze lesion bypass across the ICL adduct creating
  a suitable substrate for repair by the HR pathway'
