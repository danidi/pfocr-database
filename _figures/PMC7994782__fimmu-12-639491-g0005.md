caption: Reactome pathway enrichment analysis highlighting Interferon alpha/beta Signaling
  pathways found to be significant in both (A) Gaucher et al. () and (B) Scherer et
  al. (). The pathway diagram is in the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)
  () format. Results from both studies imply the stimulation of expression of IFN-induced
  genes though the Gaucher et al. () study shows more hit genes than the Scherer et
  al. study. Intriguingly, the Gaucher et al. () study implies STAT1, which is not
  shown in the Scherer et al. () study, while the Scherer study has USP18 that is
  not shared in the Gaucher et al. () study.
