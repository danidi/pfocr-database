caption: Microvessel ensheathment is initiated by BDNF/TrkB signaling, which is regulated
  by RhoA pathway and is sensitive to RhoA kinase (ROCK) inhibition. During inflammation
  and tissue injury pericytes are able to detach from the microvessel wall and transdifferentiate
  into fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM)-producing myofibroblasts. Deposition of
  ECM leads to fibrosis and organ failure. Fibrosis is regulated by JNK and TGFβ/Smad
  pathways, which cross-talk with RhoA pathway. Inhibition of JNK and TGFβ/Smad through
  the inhibition of RhoA kinase ROCK abrogates collagen production and fibrosis. Detachment
  of pericytes from the microvessel wall is regulated by the Ang/Tie pathway, which
  cross-talks with RhoA signaling. Because RhoA is a master regulator of actin-related
  cell functions it also regulates pericyte contractility. By crosstalking to Ang/
  Tie-2 and SEMAD4D/Plexin-B1/ANGPTL4 pathways, RhoA signaling influences pericyte
  differentiation and pericyte coverage, which in turn regulate blood flow and overall
  vessel permeability.
