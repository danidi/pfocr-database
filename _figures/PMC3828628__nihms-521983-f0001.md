caption: 'Chronic low-grade inflammation is associated with increased levels of IL-6,
  which leads to increased phosphorylation of STAT3, and subsequent increased SOCS3
  expression. Increased SOCS3 mediates the inhibitory effects of IL-6 on insulin signaling
  and glucose uptake. SOCS3 directly disrupts insulin signaling by binding to IR and
  preventing interaction with IRS-1 (primarily in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue)/IRS-2
  (primarily in the liver), and may target IRS-1/IRS-2 for degradation. Disrupting
  the early signaling events also has downstream effects on other proteins in the
  insulin pathway including PI3K and Akt, ultimately leading to insulin resistance
  and attenuated GLUT-4 mediated glucose uptake. Chronically elevated leptin levels
  also leads to increased SOCS3 expression, which can also directly inhibit insulin
  mediated glucose uptake. In addition, SOCS3 can have indirect effects on glucose
  uptake; increased SOCS3 leading to leptin resistance, and impaired leptin mediated
  AMPK activation. In contrast, acute/transient IL-6 elevations in response to exercise
  do not cause sustained increased SOCS3 expression, but cause increased insulin sensitivity
  in peripheral tissues by increased AMPK activity and subsequent increased glucose
  uptake. IL-6 mediated activation of AMPK in response to exercise is blunted in chronic
  inflammatory states. Since IL-6 is required for exercise-induced AMPK activation
  and obesity results in a blunted exercise-induced activation of AMPK, it is possible
  that increased SOCS3 may cause IL-6 resistance, which results in diminished AMPK
  activity and increased insulin resistance. IL-6: Interleukin-6; STAT3: Signal Transducer
  and Activator of Transcription 3; SOCS3: Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3; IR:
  Insulin Receptor; IRS: Insulin Receptor Substrate; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3 Kinase;
  GLUT-4: Glucose Transporter 4; AMPK: AMP activated Protein Kinase'
