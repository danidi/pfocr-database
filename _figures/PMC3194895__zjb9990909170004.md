caption: Biosynthetic pathway of shinorine in cyanobacteria depicting the two alternative
  routes to the iminomycosporines from mycosporine-glycine, with gene assignments
  for N. punctiforme and from A. variabilis gene products (in bold type next to reaction
  arrows) catalyzing the reactions, and working models for activation/reaction mechanisms
  of shinorine synthesis. The main mycosporine products are framed in gray. Dotted
  lines indicate proposed steps in the reaction mechanism. The “S” attached to Ava3885
  denotes a cysteamine thiol group in the enzyme's cofactor.
