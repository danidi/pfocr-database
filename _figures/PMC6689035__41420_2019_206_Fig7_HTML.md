caption: OPTN knockdown triggered inhibition of autophagy and caused increased migration
  and reduced colony formation. PDAC cells tried to reverse autophagy inhibition by
  activating different pathways; i.e., by ER stress as indicated by activation of
  the PERK/EIF2-α /ATF4 pathway, by stimulating CMA as manifested by upregulation
  of LAMP2, and by a low increase in ROS production. Cells which could not reverse
  the consequences of OPTN knockdown underwent apoptosis
