caption: 'Off state (left): In the absence of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) ligand, Ptch inhibits
  signal transduction by SMO. Gli canonical SHH signaling pathway proteins are sequestered
  in the cytoplasm by interaction with Sufu. Therefore, the expression of SHH signaling
  targets turns off. On state (right): In the presence of ligand, SHH binds to Ptch
  and, therefore, induces the translocation of SMO to the primary cilium, a subcellular
  compartment essential for signal transduction to the positive forms of Gli proteins.
  Gli proteins accumulate into the nucleus and activate target genes transcription.'
