caption: 'Different modes of PPP action. The PPP can function in different modes depending
  on the needs of the cell. Mode 1: Both ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH needed – predominating
  reactions are shown. – All the ribulose 5-phosphate is isomerized to ribose 5-phosphate,
  which is used for the synthesis of PRPP. Mode 2: More ribose-5-phosphate is needed
  than NADPH Ribose 5-phosphate is synthesized by the non-oxidative arm using fructose-6-phosphate
  and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate supplied by glycolysis. Mode 3: The cell needs NADPH
  and ATP but not ribose-5-phosphate. Ribulose-5-phosphate is converted to fructose-6-phosphate
  and glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate which are channeled into glycolysis'
