caption: Model for apoptosis by extracellular Par-4ER stress (a), induced by extracellular
  insults such as TRAIL, causes translocation of the Par-4-GRP78 complex from the
  ER to the plasma membrane (b). This leads to elevated expression of GRP78 and Par-4
  at the plasma membrane (c), and secretion of Par-4 (d). Extracellular Par-4 binds
  to cell surface GRP78 (e), and induces yet more ER stress (f), thereby activating
  the loop for translocation of ER GRP78 to the plasma membrane, in an intracellular
  Par-4-dependent manner. Finally, ER stress involves up-regulation of the ER component
  phospho-PERK, and activation of caspase-8 in a PERK-dependent manner (g). Activation
  of caspase-8 is also dependent on activation of FADD. Collectively, these events
  lead to activation of caspase-3 and apoptosis. This model is not restricted to prostate
  cancer cells, as the key features were recapitulated in lung and cervical cancer
  cells ().
