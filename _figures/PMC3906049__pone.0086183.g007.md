caption: This scheme summarizes starvation-related changes of insulin/TOR pathway
  components and JH synthesis. Molecules in red color are down-regulated (↓), while
  those in green are upregulated (↑). Previous experiments established the involvement
  of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and TOR in the transduction of insulin signaling
  in the CA . Astarvation-dependent decrease of insulin results in an increase of
  FOXO signaling that promotes activation of transcription of insulin receptor (INSr)
  and 4E-binding protein (4EBP). Transcripts levels for FOXO increase and mRNAs for
  JHAMT and TOR decrease. JH synthesis decrease, while increases of 4EBP inhibit translation
  and increases of INSr enhance insulin sensitivity.
