caption: Schematic representation of the intracellular cholesterol transport pathway.
  Extracellular cholesterol enters the cell via the LDL receptor and endocytosis.
  Transport from the endosomal system to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) occurs via
  transport proteins such as Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) protein. Once at the ER, excess
  cholesterol is converted to cholesterol ester by ACAT. If intracellular cholesterol
  levels drop, the N-terminus of the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein (SREBP)
  is released and enters the cell nucleus, resulting in transcription of mRNA to increase
  cholesterol production and increase receptors for extracellular cholesterol.
