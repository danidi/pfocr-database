caption: Overview of base excision repair (BER) pathway. The BER pathway is responsible
  for repairing damage induced by endogenous and exogenous agents, including chemotherapeutic
  agents. Repair is initiated by a damage-specific DNA glycosylase, that removes the
  damaged base to generate apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. AP sites can also be
  generated as a result of spontaneous base hydrolysis. Mono-functional DNA glycosylases
  remove the damaged base to generate an AP site, whereas bifunctional glycosylases
  in addition to excising the damaged base also nick the phospodiester backbone, 3′
  to the AP site. AP endonuclease 1 (Ape1), a critical component of the BER pathway,
  then processes the AP sites by hydrolyzing the backbone 5′ to the AP site to generate
  3′OH and 5′dRP groups. The 5′dRP group is removed by the dRPase function of DNA
  polymerase β and it also fills in the correct base. Repair is completed by DNA ligase
  III/XRCC1 by sealing the nick. In the major short-patch (SP) BER pathway, regular
  AP sites are repaired by the removal of the single damaged base. Modified or oxidized
  AP sites are repaired by the long-patch (LP) BER pathway where a flap of 3–8 nucleotides
  is displaced and excised by Fen1. DNA polymerase β, δ, or ɛ then inserts the correct
  nucleotides and repair is completed by sealing of the nick by DNA ligase I.
