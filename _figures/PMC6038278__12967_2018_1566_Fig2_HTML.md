caption: 'MiRNA-mRNA associations involving genes in the KEGG TGFβ-Signaling Pathway
  by location of action: extracellular factors (a), membrane receptors (b), and nuclear
  factors (c). mRNAs are shown as squares and miRNAs are shown in triangles. miRNA-mRNA
  associations are shown with lines (—) between the miRNA and mRNA pair, with an identified
  seed match are shown with a (—|) on the mRNA end of the line. Interactions with
  positive beta coefficients are shown with red lines, and those with negative beta
  coefficients are shown with green lines. Similarly, upregulated molecules are shown
  in red, with brighter red indicating a higher FC, and downregulated molecules are
  shown in green, with brighter green indicating a FC closer to 0'
