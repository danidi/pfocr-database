caption: Although many classes of GPCRs appear capable of promoting YAP activation,
  those like PAR1 that signal strongly through the Gα12/13 family are especially potent.
  Gα12/13 recruitment of Rho-GEFs causes RhoA activation and F-actin assembly, which
  promotes Lats1/Lat2 inactivation by an unknown, but myosin-independent mechanism.
  The generation of stress fibers, which entails both F-actin and myosin activation,
  also promotes YAP activation, however independently of Lats1/Lats2 inhibition. Not
  shown is the ability of some Gαs-linked GPCRs to promote the phosphorylation and
  inactivation of YAP. Solid and dashed lines and colors are used as in .
