caption: Carcinogenetic pathway and classification of colorectal cancer. Colorectal
  cancer (CRC) arises through accumulation of multiple acquired genetic and epigenetic
  alterations. Adenomas and CRCs can be classified into several sub-groups based on
  the status of DNA methylation and associated genetic mutations, suggesting that
  the different types of CRC developed through different molecular carcinogenetic
  pathways. DNA methylation accumulation occurs during aberrant cell expansion and
  is usually completed at adenoma stage. Non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms are hypothesized
  to develop through de novo pathway, whereas the epigenetic features of laterally
  spreading tumors have not yet been fully investigated.
