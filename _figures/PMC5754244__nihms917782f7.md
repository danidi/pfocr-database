caption: The present results demonstrate that MUC1-C activates the PD-L1 gene by NF-κB
  p65- and MYC-mediated mechanisms. MUC1-C→NF-κB p65 signaling also activates the
  ZEB1 gene and thereby represses miR-200c with induction of the EMT program and CSC
  state (,). Additionally, the MUC1-C→NF-κB p65 pathway promotes epigenetic reprogramming
  by induction of genes encoding DNMT1/3b and components of the PRC2 complex, including
  EZH2 (,). Moreover, MUC1-C-induced activation of the MYC pathway induces BMI1 expression
  and PRC1-mediated epigenetic alterations (). In this way, MUC1-C integrates PD-L1
  expression with the EMT program, CSC state and epigenetic reprogramming in basal
  B TNBC cells.
