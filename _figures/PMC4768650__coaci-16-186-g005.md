caption: Interleukin-5 plays a fundamental role in the proliferation, maturation in
  the bone marrow, recruitment and activation at sites of allergic inflammation of
  eosinophils. The engagement of interleukin-5R through the interaction of interleukin-5
  with interleukin-5αR and the βc subunit results in differentiation and maturation
  of eosinophils in the bone marrow, enhanced cell migration, release of granule proteins,
  and respiratory burst of eosinophils. Interleukin-3 and GM-CSF interact only with
  the βc subunit of interleukin-5R and enhance the functional response to stimuli
  of eosinophils (left side). Anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibodies (mepolizumab
  and reslizumab) bind to different epitopes of interleukin-5 blocking its ligation
  to interleukin-5Rα highly expressed on the human eosinophil membrane. Benralizumab
  is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to human interleukin-5Rα, resulting
  in inhibition of interleukin-5 activation. The latter approach also leads to antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity (ADDC) caused by Fc receptor binding on natural killer cells
  to the anti-interleukin-5Rα antibody on eosinophil (right side).
