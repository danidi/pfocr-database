caption: Effects of IL-17A on osteoclasts. ① IL-17A is produced by multiple lymphocytes
  including Treg cells, IL-17+ CD8+ T cells (Tc17 cells), γδ T cells, invariant natural
  killer T (iNK cells), and Th17 cells. Myeloid cells including macrophages/monocytes,
  neutrophils and mast cells can also secrete IL-17A. Th17 cells are the main source
  of IL-17A. ② Low concentrations of IL-17A promote osteoclastogenesis through the
  RANKL-JNK signaling pathway and reduces the apoptosis of osteoclasts through the
  RANKL-Beclin1-autophagy-TRAF3 pathway. IL-17A increases the expression of c-Fms
  in osteoclast precursors to promote proliferation and differentiation. IL-17A increases
  the number of RANK+ osteoclast precursors to influence subsequent RANKL-dependent
  osteoclastogenesis. ③ High concentration of IL-17A (5–50 ng/ml) inhibits osteoclastogenesis
  through the RANKL-JNK signaling pathway and promotes the apoptosis of osteoclasts
  through the RANKL-Beclin1-autophagy-TRAF3 pathway. However, a higher concentration
  of IL-17A (100 ng/ml) increases the number of RANK+ osteoclast precursors and induces
  polynuclear osteoclast formation. ④ IL-17A acts on osteoclast-supporting cells including
  mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts and osteocytes to produce various cytokines
  and molecules to regulate osteoclastogenesis indirectly.
