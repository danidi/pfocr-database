caption: The current US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved angiogenesis inhibitors
  for cancer therapy block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding to the
  VEGF receptor (VEGFR2) (the inhibitor bevacizumab) or inhibit the tyrosine kinase
  activity of VEGFR2 (the inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib). VEGFR2 activates several
  parallel signaling pathways that control angiogenesis, but inhibiting NO/cGMP signaling
  blocks most of these responses. Therapeutic responses to VEGF inhibitors may be
  limited by parallel activation of the downstream pathways by additional angiogenic
  factors produced by tumors that can activate NO/cGMP signaling independent of the
  VEGF receptor such as adrenomedullin, angiopoietin-1, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P),
  lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), angiopoietin-related growth factor (AGF), estrogens,
  insulin, and fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), –. Therefore, inhibitors that act
  on essential downstream pathways may be more effective than the existing VEGF/VEGFR
  antagonists for controlling tumor angiogenesis. Endostatin is one such agent that
  acts via the phosphatase PP2A to inhibit nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation
  and downstream to inhibit soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) expression. Thrombospondin
  1 (TSP1) is a redundant inhibitor of the NO/cGMP cascade, and the experimental drug
  ABT-510, a TSP1 mimetic, inhibits angiogenesis via the TSP1 receptor CD36. However,
  native TSP1 also acts through the more potent inhibitory pathway mediated by CD47.
  Proangiogenic factors and signaling pathways are shown in green, and anti-angiogenic
  factors and pathways are in red.
