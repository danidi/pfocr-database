caption: Energy capture, delivery and dissipation in plants and microalgae. When pigment
  molecules in Photosystem II absorb light, electrons are passed along an electron
  acceptor chain and finally to NADP+ reductase. The ATP and NADPH generated in light
  reaction are used to fix CO2. The intermediates from CBB cycle are then to participate
  in anabolism. The delivery of energy in microalgae depends on various pathways like
  malate/oxaloacetate shuttle and photorespiration. The energy dissipation depends
  on pathways like water to water pathway, photorespiration and H+ dissipation
