caption: Model of Syk and SFK signaling in B. burgdorferi internalization. B. burgdorferi
  internalization is mediated by multiple phagocytic receptors, including the scavenger
  receptor MARCO and integrin β1. In our study, we investigated the roles of these
  two receptors in activating signaling pathways that lead to phagocytosis. We found
  that β1 integrin, via its NPxY motif, participates in the activation of Syk, while
  both MARCO and β1 integrin participate in the activation of the SFK pathway. These
  pathways have been shown in other systems to lead to the activation of small GTPases
  such as Rac1 and Cdc42. The small GTPases are important for the phagocytosis of
  B. burgdorferi via the activation of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and
  Arp2/3, leading to F-actin polymerization and rearrangement.
