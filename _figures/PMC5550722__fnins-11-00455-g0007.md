caption: Proposed Aβ42-p75NTR-GIRK channel death signaling pathway. Aβ42 excitotoxicity
  increases intracellular calcium in neurons via NMDA receptors (NMDAR), which triggers
  an increase in the number of GIRK channels at the cell surface. Aβ42 also results
  in the cleavage of p75NTR to its C-terminal fragment, which can then activate the
  GIRK channels resident on the surface to promote a pathological potassium efflux.
  Lowered internal potassium concentration removes inhibition of apoptosome formation,
  thereby causing cell death. Cell death can be inhibited by raised extracellular
  potassium, the GIRK channel inhibitor tertiapin, chronic baclofen treatment removing
  GIRK channels from the cell surface, preventing p75NTR cleavage or treatment with
  a p75NTRsignaling inhibitor (c29).
