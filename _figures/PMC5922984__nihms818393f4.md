caption: 'A | Insulin-like signalling. Aa | In Caenorhabditis elegans, reduced activity
  of the abnormal dauer formation 2 (DAF-2) insulin-receptor homologue in neurons
  results in activation of the DAF-16 insulin-like signalling transcription factor
  in intestinal and muscle cells. Activation of DAF-16 may occur through two mechanisms:
  changes in insulin-like peptide release and/or a novel forkhead box O (FOXO)–FOXO
  signalling pathway, which both lead to upregulation of different sets of DAF-16
  target genes. DAF-16 activation in intestinal cells results in extended longevity,
  whereas DAF-16 activation in muscle cells leads to improvements in proteostasis.
  Bidirectional communication of DAF-16 activity between these tissues depends on
  the transcriptional co-regulator mediator 15 (MDT-15). Ab | In Drosophila melanogaster,
  activity of Foxo causes an increase in activity of the Foxo target 4E-BP, a regulator
  of translation. 4E-BP activity improves muscle cell proteostasis and delays muscle
  decline, which is mediated in part by autophagy. Moreover, 4E-BP activity results
  in changes in feeding behaviour, which alters insulin-like peptide release and therefore
  the regulation of Foxo activity and proteostasis in distal tissues, and ultimately
  influences longevity. Activation of Foxo in muscle cells also reduces activin signalling,
  which leads to an increase in autophagy, improved proteostasis and a reduction in
  insulin-like peptide release from the brain. Finally, mitochondrial stress activates
  the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) in muscles, increasing proteostasis
  and the release of an insulin-binding protein, Ecdysone-inducible gene L2 (ImpL2),
  which reduces systemic insulin circulation and increases longevity. B | Gonadal
  signalling in C. elegans. Loss of germline stem cells activates signalling pathways
  involving DAF-12, DAF-9 and krev interaction trapped/cerebral cavernous malformation
  1 (KRI-1) that upregulate or downregulate multiple pathways in distal cells to increase
  longevity (for example, target of rapamycin (TOR)). Proteostasis and stress resistance
  are also increased, and this is at least in part mediated by an increase in proteasome
  activity through DAF-16-mediated upregulation of the proteasome subunit regulatory
  particle non-ATPase 6 (RPN6). Solid arrows indicate direct regulatory interactions,
  dashed arrows represent regulation that may be indirect. Black arrows indicate pathways
  that regulate longevity and proteostasis; grey arrows indicate pathways known to
