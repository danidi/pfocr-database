caption: PXR–4β-hydroxycholesterol–LXR pathway as a regulator of cholesterol transporters
  and its putative role in vascular tone regulation. PXR activation by xenobiotics
  elevates circulating 4βHC, leading to the induction of cholesterol efflux transporters
  ABCA1 and ABCG1 and the repression of cholesterol influx transporter LOX-1. In addition
  to ABCA1 and ABCG1, inducible degrader of the LDL receptor (IDOL), another LXR target,
  is induced by 4βHC. The exact mechanism of LOX-1 repression is currently not known.
  The effects of 4βHC in vascular tone regulation are yet to be explored.
