caption: Biosynthesis of TPP in E. coli is accomplished by the separate synthesis
  of the pyrimidine and thiazole moiety, which are finally coupled and phosphorylated
  to form TPP (Begley et al., ). The biosynthesis of the pyrimidine part of thiamine
  starts with an intermediate of the purine biosynthesis pathway, namely aminoimidazole
  ribotide (AIR). The thiamine biosynthesis protein ThiC whose exact function remains
  to be elucidated, converts AIR to hydroxymethylpyrimidine-phosphate (HMP-P), which
  is subsequently phosphorylated by the bifunctional HMP/ HMP-P kinase ThiD to yield
  hydroxymethyl-pyrimidine pyrophosphate (HMP-PP). The thiazole moiety of thiamine
  is derived from tyrosine, cysteine and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose phosphate (DXP). In a
  yet unresolved chain of reactions featuring thiF, thiS, thiG, thiH and thiI gene
  products, hydroxyethyl-thiazole phosphate (HET-P) is formed. HMP-PP and HET-P are
  joined by one enzymatic step mediated by the ThiE protein, followed by phosphorylation
  of the formed TMP by ThiL to create TPP. Three distinct kinases, ThiM, ThiD, and
  ThiK, are involved in the salvage of HET, HMP, and thiamine, respectively, from
  the culture medium. Thiamine, thiamine phosphate, and thiamine pyrophosphate are
  actively transported in enteric bacteria using the ABC transport system ThiBPQ (Webb
  et al., ). At present, no other distinct thiamine transporters, neither HET nor
  HMP transport systems, have been identified in bacteria (Rodionov et al., ). Essential
  genes are colored red, gray genes are not validated in E. coli.
