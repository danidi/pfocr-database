caption: Figure 1.A putative model of functional coupling between T-type Ca2+ channels
  and APP processing. The amyloidogenic pathway is characterized by the proteolytic
  cleavage of APP by β-secretase (BACE1) and the resulting production of a soluble
  APP fragment (sAPPβ) and a 99-amino acid C-terminal fragment (C99) that is subsequently
  processed by γ-secretase to generate neurotoxic Aβ (Αβ40 and Αβ42) peptides that
  tend to aggregate and form extracellular senile plaques. In contrast, the non-amyloidogenic
  processing of APP by α-secretase (ADAM10) produces an 83-amino acid C-terminal fragment
  (C83) precluding the formation of APP, and a soluble sAPPα product with neurotrophic
  effects that counteract apoptotic signaling and promote synaptogenesis. In the young
  developing brain, activation of T-type Ca2+ channels stimulates non-amyloidogenic
  processing of APP, possibly by facilitating the maturation of ADAM10, which supports
  neuronal growth and synaptogenesis. In contrast, alteration of T-type Ca2+ channel
  expression in the aging brain favors amyloidogenic processing of APP and associated
  neuronal damages.
