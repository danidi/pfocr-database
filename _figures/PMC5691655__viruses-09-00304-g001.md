caption: 'DNA damage repair (DDR) factors regulate cccDNA formation, expression, and
  degradation. Two pathways for cccDNA formation have been proposed: the first pathway
  (A) is based on the transformation of dslDNA derived from DHBV replication into
  cccDNA by the classical non-homologous end joining pathway (cNHEJ); the second pathway
  (B) is based on the transformation of human HBV rcDNA, derived from incoming virions
  or intracellular recycling pathway, into cccDNA and involves several enzymatic activities.
  (1) Viral polymerase release from minus strand might be mediated by cellular TDP2
  protein. (2 and 3) Removal of redundancy terminal region and degradation of RNA
  oligomer could be mediated by cellular exo- and/or endonucleases. (4) Completion
  of the plus strand involves the activity of cellular DNA polymerases i.e., POLκ,
  POLλ, and POLη. (5) Ligation of plus and minus strands is carried out by cellular
  ligases. Once formed, cccDNA is assembled into a minichromosome and it functions
  as the transcriptional template to generate all viral mRNAs. Cellular factors can
  regulate cccDNA homeostasis by silencing its expression (i.e., Smc5/6) or inducing
  its degradation (i.e., APOBEC proteins). Note that: minus and plus strand DNAs are
  shown in blue and red, respectively; capped RNA oligomer is depicted in green; and
  viral polymerase (P) is represented as a yellow circle in the rcDNA. Question marks
  indicate conflicting results published in the literature. Dashed arrows shown in
  the first pathway (A) indicated that there is no evidence that this pathway occurs
  in human HBV cccDNA formation.'
