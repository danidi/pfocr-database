caption: Drivers of senescence and therapeutic opportunities in WS and HGPs. Drivers,
  factors leading to the accumulation of DNA damage, are boxed at the top of the diagram,
  with causative factors shown in red. All result in DNA damage if unchecked; however,
  several therapeutic or modulatory options are now available. Blocking pre-lamin
  A farnesylation with farnesyl transferase inhibitors (FTIs), or depleting lamin
  A using either morpholinos or RNAi leads to a significant reduction in aberrant
  morphological changes of the nucleus usually associated with HGPS, and a reduction
  in resultant DNA damage. Mouse cells and mice models of HGPS treated with FTIs show
  significant improvement in proliferation, and the entrie organism shows better bone
  structure and increased longevity. FTIs are already licensed for treatment of malaria
  and various cancers. Statins also reduce farnesylation and may prove useful in HGPS.
  Telomere attrition leading to signalling into the DNA damage pathway can be overcome
  in cell cultures by ectopically supplying telomerase, whilst the problems with DNA
  replication and cell proliferation resulting from loss of WRN can be overcome using
  a Holliday junction resolving enzyme, resolvase. As far as Signal transduction is
  concerned, during adipose differentiation, SRBEP1 binds and stimulates the PPARγ
  transcription factor; SREBP1 sequestration by progerin may prevent this in HGPS.
  Use of the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone has proven valuable in diminishing several
  aspects of lipodystrophy and metabolic syndrome in WS patients and may play an equally
  important role in the treatment of HGPS. Once DNA damage has occurred, through whatever
  route, there is still scope to modulate the response of the cell by inhibiting the
  stress signal transducing kinase p38 with the inhibitor SB203580, a drug already
  licensed for use in diabetes. Moving on to effectors; inhibition of the tumour suppressor
  p53 may not be ideal as it would be expected to lead to increase in cancer incidence;
  however, interfering with its downstream effector p21CDKN1 appears to reduce excess
  cell cycle exit and senescence in mouse models, without increasing cancer incidence.
  Gene deletion in people is not yet a viable option as in experimental animals, but
  RNAi may prove useful in this context. The flip side of preventing senescence using
  drugs is the possibility of causing senescence by design, with major benefits in
  cancer therapy. In particular, hyperactivating the p21CDKN1pathway through small-molecule
  drugs (e.g. nucleoside analogue CYC102) may prove a fruitful therapeutic route.
