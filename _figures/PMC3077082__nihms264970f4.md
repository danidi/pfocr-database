caption: Certain bacteria (such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  and Bacillus anthracis) bind CD14 and induce Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2)–TLR1 inside-out
  signalling for activating and binding complement receptor-3 (CR3), which leads to
  a relatively ‘safe’ uptake of these organisms by macrophages. The signalling pathway
  that activates the high-affinity state of CR3 is mediated by RAC1, phosphatidylinositol-3
  kinase (PI3K) and cytohesin 1 (CYT1). Enterococcus faecalis and Bordetella pertussis
  stimulate their uptake by CR3 through an alternative inside-out signalling pathway.
  This mechanism is activated by the interaction of these bacteria with a receptor
  complex comprising the αvβ3 integrin and CD47, and is dependent on PI3K signalling.
  Similarly, CR3-mediated uptake of these bacteria inhibits their intracellular killing
  and promotes their persistence in the mammalian host.
