caption: RNAi amplification, spreading and transcriptional gene silencing pathways.
  a Amplification pathway. RNA dependent RNA Polymerases (RdRP) employs the 3′ of
  the siRNA as primer to synthesis a new long dsRNA using the mRNA as template. PIR-1
  and DRH-3 are required for Dicer to process long dsRNA, while RDE-3 intervenes in
  an intermediate step, stabilizing the product of the initial round of cleavage,
  allowing the amplification mediated by RdRPs. SMG genes, Mut-14 and Mut-16 act downstream
  of secondary siRNA generation. RNAi persists in the animals exposed to dsRNA for
  several days []. This persistence depends on SMG genes. The secondary siRNA with
  the Secondary Argonautes (SAGOs) produce a secondary siRISC complex. b Systemic
  spreading. The secondary siRNAs spread throughout other tissues inducing the systemic
  silencing of the target gene. c Co-transcriptional silencing and chromatin remodeling.
  A specialized Argonaute, NRDE-3, transports the secondary siRNA to the nucleus where
  produce co-transcriptional gene silencing and interacts with other factors to remodel
  the chromatin. Factors with homologous genes detected in flatworms are indicated
  (“Flatworm Distribution Code” box). A shape code was used to indicate predicted
  function of factors (“Protein Function Code” box)
