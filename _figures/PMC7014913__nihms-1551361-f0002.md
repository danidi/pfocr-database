caption: Mechanisms of pathogenic alpha-synuclein transmission. This schematic of
  alpha-synuclein transmission demonstrates current hypotheses about the uptake (1),
  processing (2), escape (3) and release (4) of misfolded alpha-synuclein in a neuron.
  Astrocytes and microglia are shown in the background because they may also play
  critical roles in this process. Additionally, several of the shown cellular processes
  may occur in astrocytes and microglia as well. Extracellular alpha-synuclein can
  be taken up into neurons either through non-selective endocytosis or receptor-mediated
  endocytosis (1). In presynaptic terminals, the synaptic vesicle cycle that releases
  neurotransmitter may also promote uptake of extracellular alpha-synuclein, explaining
  the retrograde spread of alpha-synuclein pathology in animal models. Following uptake,
  misfolded alpha-synuclein is processed through the endo-lysosomal pathway (2). At
  this point, alpha-synuclein may be directly targeted back to the plasma membrane
  through recycling vesicles, or into multivesicular bodies. At some point in processing,
  alpha-synuclein seeds can escape the endolysosomal pathway and become free in the
  cytosol (3). This allows recruitment of endogenous, functional alpha-synuclein into
  fibrillar structures, a process which would be most devastating at the presynaptic
  terminal where alpha-synuclein levels are highest (3). Autophagy has the ability
  to degrade both cytosolic and vesicular alpha-synuclein through engulfment by the
  phagophore and subsequent fusion with the lysosome. Vesicles or multivesicular bodies
  containing alpha-synuclein can be targeted for exocytosis, possible to unburden
  the lysosomal degradation pathway. This leads to release of pathogenic alpha-synuclein
  from the neuron (4). The LB may provide an additional method of protection for neurons
  that cannot degrade all misfolded alpha-synuclein. Instead, they deposit it in juxtanuclear
  inclusions that keep alpha-synuclein from moving around in a more damaging form.
  Several genetic risk factors for PD encode proteins that are involved in parts of
  this alpha-synuclein processing pathway. LRRK2 has been implicated in several of
  the vesicular trafficking pathways. VPS35 may also interact with LRRK2 in vesicle
  trafficking. GBA1 is a lysosomal enzyme, and mutations may shift the flux through
  this system.
