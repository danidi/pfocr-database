caption: Adaptation of the pathway map entitled “Immune response_IL-4 – anti-apoptotic
  action” from MetaCore from Thomson Reuters. The map has been simplified leaving
  the minimal elements for activation of transcription factors essential in regulation
  of gene expression. ZAP-70 and its interactions with members of the pathway reported
  in the MetaCore database have been added to suggest its potential involvement in
  the pathway, and a link has been added for the reported interaction between NFκB
  and STAT6 . Red arrows indicate that IL4R, SOCS1, RPS6AK2, and NFKBIZ are components
  of the pathway identified as IL-4 upregulated targets in this study. Other genes
  of the pathway were significantly regulated by cell culture, such as AKT3 (up) and
  GRB2 (down).
