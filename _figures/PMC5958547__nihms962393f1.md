caption: The schematic displays targeting strategies to combat CSCs by blocking stemness
  signaling pathways. NOTCH receptors can be inhibited by brontictuzumab, MK-0752,
  and tarextumab while NOTCH ligands can be inhibited by demcizumab, MEDI0639, and
  rovalpituzumab tersirine. These agents all block NOTCH signaling, ultimately preventing
  intracellular Notch cleavage and translocation into the nucleus. The hedgehog pathway
  can be blocked using the smoothened receptor antagonist Vismodegib and Sonidegib,
  which prevent smoothened activation and downstream signaling. WNT ligands can be
  inhibited by ipafricept and WNT receptors can be inhibited by vantictumab and LGK974.
  Reparixin can block FAK signaling by inhibiting CXCR1 thereby blocking IL-8 binding
  which normally triggers FAK phosphorylation and downstream signaling. FAK can also
  be targeted directly by defactinib. Finally, napabucasin can preventSTAT3 transcriptional
  activation while amcasertib inhibits Nanog transcriptional activation. While these
  agents are designed to limit CSCs by inhibiting mechanisms of self-renewal, drug
  resistance, and metastasis, their efficacy in the randomized trials has yet to be
  demonstrated. Additional innovative strategies are sought to target CSC plasticity
  and heterogeneity, including immunotherapies that overcome CSC-mediated immune suppression
  and evasion with diverse CSC recognition and targeting, as well as big data and
  super computation-based bioinformatic intelligence.
