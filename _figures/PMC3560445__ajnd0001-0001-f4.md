caption: 'TRPV1 contributes to synaptic plasticity. As a calcium cation channel, TRPV1
  has been implicated in synaptic plasticity, especially in facilitating long term
  depression. (A) Activation of mGluR by glutamate triggers the synthesis and release
  of 12-(S) HPETE into the extracellular milieu. 12-(S)HPETE activates pre-synaptic
  TRPV1, and through a calcium-mediated pathway, glutamate release is blocked. (B)
  mGluR activation can also lead to production and release of anandamide. Anandamide
  binds postsynaptic TRPV1 to cause endocytosis of AMPA receptors, or to pre-synaptic
  cannabinoid receptors to inhibit glutamate release. 12-HPETE: 12(S)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid, LOX12: 12-Lipoxygenase, CB1: cannabinoid receptor'
