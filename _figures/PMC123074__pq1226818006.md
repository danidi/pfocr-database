caption: Model for the role of retinoid inhibition of rod CNG channels. The visual
  transduction pathway in photoreceptors, including two modes of positive feedback
  involving the all-trans-retinal liberated from rhodopsin following photoisomerization.
  Evidence suggests that all-trans-retinal can reenter the binding pocket in the opsin
  protein and stimulate transduction through a noncovalent interaction (). We suggest
  that the inhibitory effect of all-trans-retinal on the cGMP-gated channel may also
  contribute to channel closure under certain circumstances, perhaps during the response
  to bright light.
