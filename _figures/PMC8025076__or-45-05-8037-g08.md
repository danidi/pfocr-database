caption: Autophagy pathway consists of several sequential steps as reported previously
  (). PRIMA-1met markedly induces autophagic vesicle formation and fusion with lysosomes,
  while also increasing lysosomal degradation in colorectal cancer cell lines with
  different p53 statuses. PRIMA-1met upregulates AMPK activation in cells expressing
  wild-type or mutant p53, and negatively regulates mTOR expression in cells with
  wild-type p53, further increasing Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 and
  downstream PI3K Class III (Vps34) activation, regardless of p53 status. PRIMA-1met;
  p53-reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis-1, APR-017 methylated; ULK1,
  Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; AV, autophagic vesicle.
