caption: Sequential process of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and production
  of amyloid beta species. Transmembrane APP is cleaved by α-secretase followed by
  γ-secretase to produce non-toxic amyloid species (non-amyloidogenic pathway, left
  blue thick arrow), while, through the amyloidogenic pathway (right red thick arrow),
  toxic Aβ species are generated by β-and γ-secretase. The toxic Aβ species including
  Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 are easily aggregated and produce highly toxic Aβ oligomers. Both
  processes produce soluble ectodomains [soluble APPα (sAPPα) and sAPPβ] and identical
  intracellular C-terminal fragment of APP (AICD). RAGE and LRP-1 located in bloodbrain
  barrier (BBB) are involved in the transport of the Ab between the brain and peripheral
  blood.
