caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathways that are postulated to upregulate
  the expression of A20 and then inhibit inflammatory mediators in macrophages induced
  by M protein following GAS infection. Upon induction of macrophages by M protein
  of GAS, NF-κB is activated through the MyD88 pathway, which induces expression of
  genes associated with the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. A20
  expression depends on activation of NF-κB and partly on the interaction of TNF-αand
  TNFR. In turn, A20 targets TRAF-6 to inhibit inflammatory signal pathways, which
  leads to a reduction in the production of proinflammatory cytokines.
