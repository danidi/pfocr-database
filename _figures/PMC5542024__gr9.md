caption: 'Graphical Summary. ROS-induced contractile signalling pathway in rat pulmonary
  artery. Reactive oxygen species (ROS: superoxide and H2O2) generated in response
  to GPCR (presumably via NADPH-oxidase, NOX), LY83583 (via quinone oxidoreductase,
  QOR), or hypoxia (from mitochondria, mito), activate Src-family kinases (SrcFK)
  either via direct oxidation or via oxidative inhibition of c-Src kinase (CSK) or
  inhibitory tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). This is followed by sequential activation
  of ARHGEF1, RhoA and Rho-kinase, resulting in enhanced MYPT-1 and MLC20 phosphorylation
  and contraction. Boxed red text indicates treatments/antagonists that inhibit responses
  or activity of each component in the pathway. Temp/ebs = antioxidants Tempol & ebselen;
  SOD/cat = superoxide dismutase and catalase; PP2 = SrcFK inhibitor; rot/myx = mitochondrial
  electron transfer chain inhibitors rotenone & myxothiazol; Y16 = inhibitor of RGS
  domain containing RhoAGEFs. Question mark indicates steps shown previously but not
  examined in this study.'
