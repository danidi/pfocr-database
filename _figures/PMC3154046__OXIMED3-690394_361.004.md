caption: ROS signaling in enzyme/gene-depended processes. High glucose (HG)-induced
  ROS formation resulted in the phosphorylation of Ser36-p66shcA protein that promoted
  further ROS formation. ROS overproduction activated Akt/PKB kinase, which phosphorylated
  and inactivated FOXO3a protein, enhanced oxidative stress and suppressed the survival
  phenotype [, ]. Diabetes increased the levels of transforming growth factor TGFβ
  that led to the inactivation of phospho- FOXO3a protein and the enhanced oxidative
  stress []. Enhanced ROS in diabetic myocytes caused upregulation of the silent information
  regulator 2 (Sirt2) and FOXO3a, the reduction of Akt phosphorylation and the phosphorylation
  of glycogen synthase kinase GSK-3β []. The advanced glycation end products (AGEs)
  promoted the Ser-36 phosphorylation of p66shc, FOXO3a inactivation and MnSOD suppression
  in a ROS-dependent manner. This pathway can be blocked by AGER 1 (an AGE-receptor
  that counteracts receptor for advanced glycation end products RA GE) and epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) [].
