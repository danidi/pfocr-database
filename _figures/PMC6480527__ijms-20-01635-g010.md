caption: Model of the Nrf2-mediated oxidative stress response pathway in bovine granulosa
  cells under moderate oxidative stress conditions and under antioxidant (quercetin)
  supplementation. Oxidative stress and Que modulate Nrf2 post transcriptionally through
  the inhibition of miR-153, miR-28 and miR-708, which targeted bovine Nrf2. After
  that, Nrf2 protein was activated and localized to the nucleus, where it binds to
  the antioxidants reactive element (ARE) in the promoters of antioxidant genes. This
  activates antioxidant gene expression so the respective proteins can scavenge the
  excessive ROS and subsequently maintain the activity of mitochondria.
