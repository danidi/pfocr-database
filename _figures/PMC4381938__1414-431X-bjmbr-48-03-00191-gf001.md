caption: . Essential metabolic pathways for bovine embryonic development. The anaerobic
  pathway (glycolysis or the glycolytic pathway) does not utilize oxygen and generates
  lactate. Glucose, one of the most important metabolic substrates for glycolysis,
  is obtained from the extracellular medium or from glycogen reservoirs. In the aerobic
  (or oxidative) pathway, pyruvate is converted into oxaloacetate or acetyl-CoA and
  fatty acids are converted into acetyl-CoA. ATP synthesis is dependent on the Krebs'
  cycle and on oxidative phosphorylation (enzymatic reactions catalyzed by proteins
  from the inner mitochondrial membrane). The lipolytic pathway (or lipolysis) allows
  the oxidation of fatty acids, obtained from lipid (triglyceride) reservoirs or from
  the extracellular medium.
