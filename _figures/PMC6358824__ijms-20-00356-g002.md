caption: Schematic depiction of unmodified hexaacylated glycoform I and glycoform
  derivatives with various non-stoichiometric substitutions with a third Kdo-Rha disaccharide.
  Various genes whose products mediate different steps in LPS biosynthesis and incorporation
  of different modifications are indicated. Glycoform I constitutes the major LPS
  species under non-stress conditions (A). Upon the induction of RpoE sigma factor
  and conditions inducing BasS/R and PhoB/R TCSs, the lipid A part is modified by
  P-EtN and l-Ara4N at 1 and 4′ position by EptA and ArnT, respectively (B). The induction
  of RpoE causes increased synthesis of EptB overcoming MgrR silencing and incorporation
  of P-EtN on the second Kdo (panels B1 and B2). The induction of RpoE favors pathway
  of the third Kdo incorporation by increased synthesis of WaaZ and repression of
  WaaR by the RybB sRNA, leading to synthesis of glycoforms with a third Kdo with
  attachment of Rha on the third Kdo with a concomitant truncation of the terminal
  GlcIII-HepIV disaccharide shown in violet background. The PhoB/R induction leads
  to the incorporation of GlcUA at the expense of HepII phosphorylation (blue background).
  Lipid A can also be modified by PagP generating heptaacylated lipid A and by the
  removal of acyl chains by LpxR in the OM after translocation (light brown background).
  Various sRNA-mediated controls are shown in blue color.
