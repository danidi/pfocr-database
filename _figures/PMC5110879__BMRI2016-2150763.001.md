caption: 'MicroRNAs biogenesis and function. In the nucleus, DNA is transcribed into
  pri-miRNA and then cleaved by Drosha to produce pre-miRNA in the canonical microRNA
  biogenesis pathway. Noncanonical biogenesis pathways exist. Pre-miRNA is then moved
  in the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 where another RNase III, Dicer cleaves it into a
  microRNA duplex, to finally obtain a single stranded microRNA. The microRNA can
  exercise his action internally or in a cell-to-cell interaction, through convergent
  or divergent microRNA pathways. Circulating microRNAs are usually associated with
  lipoprotein, protein, exosome, and microvesicles. See text for further details.
