caption: Small molecule modulation of PERK signaling can be mediated by targeting
  eIF2α phosphatase complexes. PERK activation increases eIF2α phosphorylation, which
  in turn attenuates translation and increases expression of stress-responsive transcription
  factors. This pathway is negatively regulated by a phosphatase complex between protein
  phosphatase 1 and the constitutively expressed regulatory subunit CreP (PP1–CreP)
  and/or a stress-induced regulatory subunit GADD34 (PP1–GADD34). Small molecules
  that target these complexes can modulate eIF2α-dependent signaling, effectively
  mimicking PERK activation. Salubrinal inhibits both the PP1–CreP and PP1–GADD34
  phosphatase complexes, allowing for increased eIF2α phosphorylation in the absence
  of stress. Guanabenz selectively targets PP1–GADD34, providing a mechanism to prolong
  PERK-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation signaling activation in response to ER stress.
