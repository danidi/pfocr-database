caption: Iron redox cycling in aerobic iron metabolism. A, iron uptake and efflux
  from the intestinal enterocyte. Fe(II) is the substrate for transport, whereas the
  substrate for input and output from this metabolic pathway is Fe(III). B, Fe(II)
  is both the input and output substrate from Ft redox cycling; Fe(III) is the metabolic
  intermediate in this pathway. C, iron uptake at the fungal PM inverts the Ft cycle
  in that Fe(III) is the input and output substrate with Fe(II) as the intermediate.
  D, iron cycling in the yeast vacuole (Vac) is a combination of Ft and fungal PM
  iron cycling. The Fe(II) is the input substrate, and Fe(III) is the output substrate
  with a Ft-like intravacuolar cycling between Fe(II) and Fe(III). All reductions
  are 1e−. Reductions associated with transmembrane iron trafficking involve NADPH-dependent
  reductases mediated by cytochrome heme centers; the reducing equivalents associated
  with Ft iron mobilization have not been characterized. All oxidations are catalyzed
  by a ferroxidase center and consume dioxygen. The question marks indicate that ionic
  iron speciation in the cytoplasm is largely uncharacterized.
