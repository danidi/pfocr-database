caption: We propose three signaling pathways regulating the expression of NAG-1 by
  PPARγ agonists leading to apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells. The first
  pathway of NAG-1 regulation is mediated by the activation of PPARγ receptor and
  binding to the PPARγ responsive element (PPRE) of the KLF4 promoter to transactivate
  KLF4 expression. The KLF4, as a transcription factor, binds and transactivates NAG-1
  expression. The silencing of PPARγ and its antagonist, GW9662, inhibited the expression
  of KLF4, providing evidence of a PPARγ-dependent pathway. The second pathway of
  NAG-1 regulation involves PPARγ-independent regulation possibly through the transcription
  factor EGR-1 after PPARγ treatment (troglitazone) (). The third pathway illustrates
  posttranscriptional modifications of NAG-1 leading to increasing expression of NAG-1
  by PPARγ agonists (MCC-555) ().
