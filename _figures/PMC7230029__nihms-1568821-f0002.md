caption: Aberrant dsDNA within the cytoplasm can be generated by a variety of extracellular
  and intracellular sources, where it activates cGAS. This leads to cGAMP production,
  and subsequent STING activation. STING is located in the ER membrane, but upon activation
  translocates through the ERGIC and Golgi. STING can then interact with TBK (facilitated
  by palmitoylation of STING), which results in the phosphorylation of STING. STING
  phosphorylation results in IRF3 recruitment and phosphorylation by TBK1. Phosphorylated
  IRF3 can then translocate to the nucleus and induce activation of IFN genes. A major
  regulator of this signaling pathway is the ER-localized nuclease TREX1, which can
  degrade cytosolic DNA.
