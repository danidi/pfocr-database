caption: 'Pathogenic viruses target RLR regulation for immune evasion. There are five
  general strategies used by viruses to target RLR–MAVS signaling: (1) modulation
  of PTMs of RLRs, (2) cleavage of RLR pathway components, (3) sequestration of RLRs,
  (4) modulation of RLR localization, and (5) degradation of MAVS and other RLR downstream
  signaling molecules. The details of the viral antagonistic mechanisms are described
  in the text.'
