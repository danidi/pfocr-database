caption: A schematic diagram showing the proposed mechanism by which the Hippo signaling
  pathway regulates endometrial cancer. The Hippo pathway activates the PI3K/AKT pathway
  via growth factors, including 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (LPA),
  EGF, insulin, and IGF1, resulting in YAP and TAZ dephosphorylation, leading to nuclear
  translocation and TEAD transcriptional activation. MIR31 significantly inhibits
  the luciferase activity of mRNA binding to the LATS2 3’-UTR, and the downregulation
  of LATS2 leads to the dephosphorylation of YAP, promotes the translocation of YAP
  into the nucleus, and increases the transcription of CCND1. Inactivation of deubiquitinating
  enzyme USP51 inhibits FAT4, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of LATS1/2 and
  YAP, while increased YAP nuclear translocation and loss of LSR upregulate TEAD/AREG
  in EC cells, which promote proliferation and invasion. YAP/TEAD-AP1 cooperation
  engages SRC1-3 coactivators and drives downstream gene expression to regulate endometrial
  cancer cell migration and invasion. Verteporfin induces YAP retention in the cytoplasm
  through increasing levels of 14-3-3 and blocks the transcriptional activation of
  targets downstream of YAP.
