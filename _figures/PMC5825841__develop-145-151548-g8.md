caption: Model for regulation of Abl signaling by Notch. Prior to ligand activation,
  Notch is bound to Dab and Trio. This population of Notch protein is phosphorylated
  on tyrosine (Y-P). Dab localizes Abl and stimulates its kinase activity (; ); Trio
  stimulates Rac signaling. After binding to ligand (Delta) and proteolytic cleavage
  (Kuzbanian and Presenilin), Notch ICD is released from the plasma membrane and traffics
  away while remaining bound to Dab and Trio. This disrupts Abl signaling complexes
  (red X) by physically displacing the upstream regulatory components from their direct
  targets, thereby suppressing Abl pathway signaling.
