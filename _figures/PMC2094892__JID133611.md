caption: The role of inflammation, fibrinolysis and coagulation in infection. The
  inflammatory and procoagulant host responses to infection are intricately linked.
  Infectious agents and inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha
  (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 activate coagulation by stimulating the release of tissue
  factor from monocytes and the endothelium. The presentation of tissue factor leads
  to the formation of thrombin and a fibrin clot. Inflammatory cytokines and thrombin
  can both impair the endogenous fibrinolytic potential by stimulating the release
  of plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) from platelets and the endothelium.
  PAI-1 is a potent inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator, the endogenous pathway
  for lysing a fibrin clot. In addition, the procoagulant thrombin is capable of stimulating
  multiple inflammatory pathways and further suppressing the endogenous fibrinolytic
  system by activating thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). The conversion
  of protein C, by thrombin bound to thrombomodulin, to the serine protease activated
  protein C is impaired by the inflammatory response. Endothelial injury results in
  decreased thrombomodulin levels. The end result of the host response to infection
  may be the development of diffuse endovascular injury, microvascular thrombosis,
  organ ischemia, multiorgan dysfunction and death. Activated protein C can intervene
  at multiple points during the systemic response to infection. It exerts an antithrombotic
  effect by inactivating factors Va and VIIIa, limiting the generation of thrombin.
  As a result of decreased thrombin levels, the inflammatory, procoagulant and antifibrinolytic
  response induced by thrombin is reduced. In vitro data indicate that activated protein
  C exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the production of inflammatory
  cytokines (TNF--α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6) by monocytes and limiting the
  rolling of monocytes and neutrophils on injured endothelium by binding selectins.
  Activated protein C indirectly increases the fibrinolytic response by inhibiting
  PAI-1. Reproduced with permission from reference

  description: The role of inflammation, fibrinolysis and coagulation in infection.
    The inflammatory and procoagulant host responses to infection are intricately
