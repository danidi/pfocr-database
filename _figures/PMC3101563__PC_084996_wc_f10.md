caption: A Model Depicting the Involvement of WRKY33 Downstream of MPK3/MPK6 Cascade
  in Regulating Camalexin Biosynthesis in Plants Challenged by Pathogens.A simplified
  camalexin biosynthetic pathway and its regulatory pathway are placed in separate
  rectangular boxes with dashed outlines. Genes whose expressions are induced by pathogen
  infection and MPK3/MPK6 activation are marked by bold, italic font. Arrows with
  solid lines are used to connect WRKY33 and its direct target genes based on ChIP-qPCR
  analysis. WRKY33 binds constitutively to the W-box cis-elements. Upon phosphorylation
  by MPK3/MPK6, WRKY33 is able to activate the expression of its target genes, including
  WRKY33, forming a potential positive feedback regulatory loop downstream of MPK3/MPK6
  cascade. The activation of WRKY33 at both transcriptional and posttranslational
  levels eventually drives the high-level activation of camalexin biosynthetic genes
  and the induction of camalexin biosynthesis. One arrow may represent multiple steps
  because of unknown components.[See online article for color version of this figure.]
