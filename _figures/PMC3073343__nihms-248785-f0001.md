caption: Activators (forskolin, hesperidin) are indicated by the blue arrows; inhibitors
  by the red arrows (amiloride, INH-172). The structure of hesperidin is noted in
  the inset; the (2,3-dihydro-2-phenylchromen-4-one) nucleus of a flavone is shown
  in black. CBF and CFTR are activated through the PKA-dependent pathway. Hesperidin
  is thought to act as a CFTR channel potentiator through its interactions with the
  nucleotide binding domains (NBD) rather than activation (phosphorylation) of the
  Regulatory Domain (RD). Hesperidin also stimulates CBF through either localized
  changes in the composition of the periciliary fluid or an unknown mechanism that
  confers direct activation.
