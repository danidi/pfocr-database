caption: Overview of nuclear transport pathways for macromolecules. These pathways
  are all based on a thermal ratchet mechanism in which energy is used to rectify
  Brownian motion by mediating the assembly of cargo:carrier complexes in the donor
  compartment and their disassembly in the acceptor compartment. Proteins and small
  RNAs are transported using karyopherin-based carriers to mediate movement through
  nuclear pores. In nuclear protein import (A) karyopherins (Kap; yellow) such as
  importin-β bind their cargoes (green) in the cytoplasm (often employing an adapter
  such as importin-α), and then, when the cargo:carrier complex reaches the nucleus,
  RanGTP (red) binding to the karyopherin dissociates the cargo, after which the karyopherin:RanGTP
  complex returns to the cytoplasm where the RanGTPase is activated by RanGAP, generating
  RanGDP that dissociates from the karyopherin, freeing it for a further import cycle.
  The RanGDP is then recycled to the nucleus where RanGEF (RCC1, Prp20) recharges
  it with GTP. The export of proteins and small RNAs (B) is mediated by an analogous
  pathway, except that here the cargo binds to the karyopherin (such as Crm1) complexed
  with RanGTP in the nucleus and is released in the cytoplasm following GTP hydrolysis.
  The export of mRNAs (C) employs a different pathway that uses the Mex67:Mtr2 (NXF1:NXT1)
  complex () as a carrier to which binding in the nucleus and release in the cytoplasm
  are mediated by DEAD-box helicases (Sub2 and Dbp5, respectively) that hydrolyze
  ATP to remodel the mRNP. An additional feature of mRNA export is that it is necessary
  for the nuclear steps of the gene expression pathway to have been completed so that
  only fully matured transcripts are exported for translation in the cytoplasm. The
  machinery involved in these steps is summarized in .
