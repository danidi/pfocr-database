caption: Diphtheria toxin-mediated regulation of mRNA translation. Diphtheria toxin
  is internalized in cells by binding to cell surface receptors and is subsequently
  activated by cleavage of the regulatory B domain from the catalytic A domain. The
  activated A domain MARylates the diphthamide residue in EF2 protein using NAD+ as
  a substrate. Histidine is modified to diphthamide by a multi-step biosynthetic pathway.
  ADPRylation of EF2 attenuates protein synthesis by inhibiting (1) EF2 incorporation
  into ribosomes, (2) transfer of aminoacyl tRNA from the A site to P site, and (3)
  reverse translocation and −1 frameshifting of ribosomes during translational elongation.
  Loss of the members of the diphthamide biosynthesis pathway results in a loss of
  sensitivity to diphtheria toxin and enhanced sensitivity to TNFα-mediated apoptosis.
