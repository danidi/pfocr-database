caption: The biochemical pathway for biotin synthesis in analogy to the pathway in
  Escherichia coli is expected to proceed by methylation of malonyl-ACP 1 to the corresponding
  methyl ester 2 by BioC, which allows it to enter the fatty acid synthesis pathway
  (FAS-II) where it undergo two rounds of extension to pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester 3
  (; ). Hydrolysis of the methyl ester 3 by BioH is expected to furnish pimeloyl-ACP
  4. Next BioF catalyzes the decarboxylative condensation of pimeloyl-ACP 4 with alanine
  to furnish 8-aminopelaragonic acid (KAPA, 5). Reductive amination of KAPA to 7,8-diaminopelargonic
  acid (DAPA, 6) is performed by the PLP-dependent aminotransferase BioA. Carboxylation
  of DAPA 6 to dethiobiotin 7 mediated by BioD followed by C-H activation and sulfur
  insertion by BioB affords biotin 8.
