caption: ATM-dependent DNA damage signaling pathway. ATM, a serine/threonine kinase,
  is activated by reorganization of a higher order chromatin structure caused by DSBs.
  Activated ATM phosphorylates various downstream effectors and mediates or initiates
  DNA damage responses, including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. ATM,
  ataxia-telangiectasia mutated; DSBs, DNA double-strand breaks. To see this illustration
