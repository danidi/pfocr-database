caption: (A) WNKs phosphorylate the two related Ste20 kinases, SPAK and OSR1, on a
  T-loop threonine in the active site, which is required for SPAK/OSR1 activation,
  and on a serine in the PF1 domain in the C-terminus of the protein. SPAK and OSR1
  phosphorylate conserved serines and threonines in the sodium-coupled SLC12 chloride
  cotransporters, NCC, NKCC1 and NKCC2 in mammals, increasing transport activity.
  Phosphorylation of the potassium-coupled SLC12 chloride cotransporters, KCCs 1–4
  in mammals, results in transporter inactivation. (B) Schematic of the nephron showing
  sites of WNK action. WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling positively regulates NKCC2 in the thick
  ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle, and NCC in the distal convoluted tubule
  (DCT), promoting sodium chloride reabsorption. Decreased sodium delivery to the
  K+-secretory principal cell of the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN),
  where K+ secretion depends on a lumen-negative charge generated by Na+ reabsorption
  through the epithelial Na channel (ENaC), likely contributes to the hyperkalemia
  observed in patients with PHAII. WNKs also regulate ENaC and the K+-secretory channels
  renal outer medullary potassium channel (ROMK) and big potassium channel (BK, also
  known as maxi-K) (; ). Also pictured are the Na+/K+-ATPase, which generates the
  driving force for sodium reabsorption in the TAL, DCT and the principal cell of
  the ASDN; Clc-Kb, a chloride channel allowing basolateral exit of Cl−, and the heterodimeric
  Kir4.1/5.1 potassium channel, which is important for recycling K+ entering through
  the Na+/K+-ATPase and setting the basolateral membrane potential. KCC4 could also
  play a role in basolateral KCl exit (see text). (C) Summary of Wnk1 function in
  in zebrafish. During angiogenesis, Wnk1 is regulated by Vegfr signaling via Akt
  phosphorylation and is also a transcriptional target of Vegf signaling. Vgfr2 and
  PI3K are encoded by the flk1 and pi3kc2α genes, respectively. (D)Drosophila Wnk
  regulates Wnt signaling and the expression of Awh/ Lhx8 via Fray/OSR1.
