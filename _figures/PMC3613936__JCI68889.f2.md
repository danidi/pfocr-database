caption: (A) Shown in a schematized hepatocyte is the pathway that TMPRSS6 modulates
  to dampen hepcidin expression. Binding of the BMP6 ligand to BMP receptors (BMPRs)
  at the plasma membrane activates SMAD proteins, which translocate to the nucleus
  to activate hepcidin transcription. The membrane-associated protein HJV, which functions
  as a BMP coreceptor, augments hepcidin signaling through this pathway. TMPRSS6 dampens
  hepcidin signaling by cleaving HJV from the cell membrane. When liver iron stores
  increase, BMP6 production by the liver is also increased, thereby inducing hepcidin
  synthesis. (B) In the presence of Tmprss6-ASOs, Tmprss6 mRNA is degraded by RNase
  H. The resulting reduction in TMPRSS6 protein leads to enhanced BMP signaling for
  hepcidin transcription. For simplicity, other hepcidin-modulating pathways, as well
  as other proteins that interact with the BMP pathway, are not shown.
