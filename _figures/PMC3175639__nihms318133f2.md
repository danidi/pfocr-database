caption: This network was identified as operative in Immune Response, Cell-to-Cell
  Signaling and Interaction, and Hematological System Development and Function, as
  determined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Each shaded transcript was significantly
  altered following CRY2 silencing, with a mean fold change>|2| and B-H P-value <0.01
  in both biologic replicates of the whole genome microarray. Genes depicted in red
  are upregulated, while those in green are downregulated. Higher intensity color
  corresponds to greater magnitude of the fold change. Of the 29 molecules in the
  network which were significantly altered 27 were upregulated, while only 2 were
  downregulated; which is consistent with CRY2’s role as a transcriptional repressor.
