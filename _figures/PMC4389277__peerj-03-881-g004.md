caption: The pathway for synthesis of vitamin B6 is annotated with gene distribution
  in the six sequenced Blochmannia. Camp Bloch refers to all four sequenced Blochmannia
  of Camponotus sensu stricto, which have the same gene content for this pathway.
  A plus sign indicates an intact gene, a minus sign indicates a missing gene, and
  a psi symbol indicates a pseudogene.
