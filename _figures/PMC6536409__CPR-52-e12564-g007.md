caption: LncRNA TNRC6C‐AS1 facilitated cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis
  and autophagy by promoting the methylation of STK4 promoter region via the Hippo
  signalling pathway. Over‐expressed TNRC6C‐AS1 suppressed STK4 expression by promoting
  its methylation through methyltransferase recruitment. The protein levels of MST1
  and LATS1/2 as well as the extent of YAP phosphorylation were reduced, thus activating
  YAP in thyroid carcinoma (TC) cells and promoting its nuclear translocation. As
  a result, the proliferation of TC cells was promoted while the apoptosis and autophagy
  of TC cells were inhibited
