caption: Mutation-activated HRasV12 in Ink4a/Arf–/– melanocytes triggers the Ikkβ/NF-κB
  signal transduction pathway, leading to inhibition of the apoptosis machinery (p53,
  p21, Bcl2, caspase 3 cleavage), a transcriptional burst of IL6 accompanied by activation
  of Stat3, cell cycle progression (with induction of Rb phosphorylation, aurora kinase,
  Cdk4, survivin), cell proliferation, and immortalization when p16/p19 are deleted.
  Deletion of Ikkb in these cells blocks cell cycle progression (reduced Rb phosphorylation,
  aurora kinase, Cdk4, and survivin expression), reduces proliferation, and enhances
  p53-mediated apoptosis. When p53 is knocked down in cells null for Ikkb, the induction
  of apoptosis is reversed, indicating that p53 induction (indicated by bold font)
  is required for the effects of loss of Ikkb on inhibition melanoma tumor growth.
  Therefore, deletion of Ikkb emerges as an effective target for treating melanoma
  tumors that express wild-type p53.
