caption: Schematic model of the molecular signal pathway of the proposed cell death
  crosstalk in B16 cells exposed to plasma induced-ROS. In short, CAP-induced ROS
  cause oxidative stress. The excessive intracellular ROS can, in turn, activate the
  TNF-R1 pathway, which leads to ASK1 activation and downstream stimulation of ERK,
  JNK, or p38. Phosphorylated JNK activates the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax. Bax translocates
  to the mitochondria and triggers the release of cytochrome C into the cytosol, leading
  to the activation of caspase-3/7 and eventually causes apoptotic cell death. Intracellular
  ROS can also suppress cell growth by inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and
  upregulating p53 antitumor activity. P53 arrests the cell cycle via P21 and increases
  apoptosis based on the mitochondrial pathway by enhancing PUMA/NOXA/Bax. By contrast,
  ROS can directly stimulate ERK1/ERK2 and JNK. ERK1/ERK2 can induce LC3. JNK phosphorylates
  Bcl-2 and releases beclin1 associated with LC3 that is involved in autophagic cell
  death. Alternatively, JNK can induce c-jun phosphorylation. Phospho-c-jun induces
  AP-1 production, which in turn increases the expression of many genes such as c-jun,
  beclin 1, Atg5/7, Bax, and FasL. Beclin 1 and Atg 5/7 stimulate autophagic cell
  death, and FasL can induce Fas receptor (Fas-R) expression and activate caspase
  8, which in turn stimulates Bax-oligomerization.
