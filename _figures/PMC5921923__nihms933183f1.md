caption: Using the MMTV-Myc mouse model, EMT and Papillary tumors were used in a proof
  of principle experiment to predict therapy. For all tumors RNA was collected and
  gene expression was surveyed. Signaling pathway predictions (red on, blue off) for
  key signaling pathways were calculated based on gene expression signatures. EMT
  tumors were then transplanted to the mammary glands of syngenic mice. Once tumors
  reached 6 mm in the largest dimension, therapy for EMT, control therapy based on
  papillary tumors and vehicle control therapy was initiated in each cohort of mice.
  EMT treatment was found to be effective and specific for EMT tumors. Papillary treatment
  was also shown to be effective and specific for papillary tumors (not shown).
