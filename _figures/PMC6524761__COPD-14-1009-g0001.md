caption: 'Metabolic pathway of glycolysis, FAS and FAO. Glycolysis converts glucose
  into pyruvate, which can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Glycolysis also
  feeds the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which generates ribose for nucleotides
  and NADPH. Citrate can be fully oxidized to generate ATP or transported to the cytoplasm
  where it is converted back to acetyl-CoA by ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). A portion
  of the acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1).
  Fatty acid synthase (FAS) performs the condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
  to produce the 16-carbon saturated fatty acid palmitate and other saturated long-chain
  FAs. In the cytosol, fatty acy-CoA synthases (ACS）activate fatty acids by converting
  them to fatty acyl-CoA. Fatty acyl-CoA is converted to acylcarnitine by CPT1 on
  ther outer mitochondrial membrane and transported to the mitochondrial matrix. In
  the mitochondrial matrix, fatty acyl-CoA is oxidized to acetyl-CoA through fatty
  acid oxidation.Abbreviations: ACC1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase α; ACLY, ATP citrate
  lyase; ACS, acyl-CoA synthase; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1; FAS, fatty
  acid synthase; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle.'
