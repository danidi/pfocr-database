caption: The SIRT3, SDH, and GPR91 signaling pathway in HSCs and hepatocytes. Each
  solid line and arrow denotes a step in an activating pathway, and the dashed lines
  and arrows denote a step in an inhibiting pathway. Palmitate decreases SIR3 activity,
  thereby decreasing SDH activity in hepatocytes and HSCs. Increased succinate accumulation
  from decreased SDH activity in hepatocytes or HSCs moves out from the cytosol and
  activates GPR91 in HSCs, resulting in the production of α-SMA, TGF-β1, and collagen
  type I proteins.
