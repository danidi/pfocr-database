caption: 'Schematic representation of carbon-nitrogen metabolism changes in non-grafted
  cucumber (A) and rootstock grafted cucumber (B) exposed to CA stress. Photosynthesis,
  Calvin cycle, glycolysis, TCA cycle, glyoxylate cycle and nitrogen metabolism were
  regulated by grafting. Different color indicates level of gene expression with red
  representing up-regulation while green as down-regulation. The level of regulation
  was determined based on log2 fold change. The blue arrow represents the direction
  of substance metabolism in cyclic metabolic pathway. [Abbreviations for different
