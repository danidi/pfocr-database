caption: Summary of the common pathways underlying neurodegenerative diseases and
  cancer that are mediated by miRNAs. An individual miRNA can be involved in the development
  of both diseases by two mechanisms. A miRNA can target a gene that represents a
  common cellular pathway that leads to neurodegeneration and uncontrolled tumor cell
  growth. An individual miRNA can play roles in controlling both neurodegeneration
  and tumorigenesis by targeting disparate pathways that are specific for each pathogenic
  process. ‘?’ indicates that direct targets have not been validated.
