caption: Role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2/hemeoxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1)
  signaling pathway in oxidative stress. Under normal condition, Nrf2 is bound to
  Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1), gets ubiquitinated through Keap1, and
  undergoes proteasomal degradation. Under oxidative stress conditions, when exposed
  to reactive oxygen species (ROS), Keap1 inactivates and Nrf2 phosphorylation occurs.
  Phosphorylated Nrf2 (p-Nrf2) moves to the nucleus, where it binds to the antioxidant
  response element (ARE). As a result, numerous genes are activated, such as transport
  molecules, antioxidants, and detoxifying enzymes. This leads to an upregulation
  of hemeoxygenase -1 (HO-1). Upregulated HO-1 leads to a reduction of oxidative stress.
  HO-1 is a crucial endogenous antioxidant and creates an essential defense system.
  HO-1, when activated by Nrf2, can metabolize Heme into its metabolites Fe2+, CO,
  and biliverdin. These metabolites along with HO-1 by scavenging superoxide, hydroxyl-free
  radicals, and singlet oxygen can prevent the oxidation of proteins and lipids anions
  and play an important part in anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and anti-apoptosis.
