caption: 'The overview of anticancer properties of pterostilbene (trans-3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxystilbene;
  PS). PS are able to target apoptosis-dependent and -independent signaling pathways
  against cancer progression and likely cancer metastasis. The key events affected
  by PS in all the pathways are boxed in grey color. In the category of pro-apoptotic
  effects, PS inhibits onco-miRs (e.g., miR663b) and growth factors (e.g., EGFR),
  triggers an epigenetic modification through the inhibition of MTA1, induces ERS,
  or lowers autophagy through the inhibition of ATG1. In the category of nonapoptotic
  effects, most of the effects caused by PS are shown to inhibit pro-tumor signaling
  pathways including hTERT, Fas/FAK signaling, TNFα, cell growth/MMP-9, NF-κB/MUC1/β-catenin,
  AKT/ERK signaling axis, and packed in circulating sEVs that are involved in senescence
  prevention, EMT, inflammation, p38/mediated migration/invasion, and cancer stemness,
  polyFN assembly on CTCs, and miR17-92-delivery in the circulation, respectively.
  All these apoptosis-dependent and -independent inhibitory effects caused by PS likely
  lead to a reduction of cancer metastasis. Note: signaling events involved in the
  anti-metastatic activities of PS are depicted as solid or broken lines whenever
  supported or not yet supported (only logically deduced), respectively, by the literature.
  The corresponding full names abbreviated are listed as follows: ptw, pathway; meta,
  metastasis; gro, growth; mig, migration; inv, invasion.'
