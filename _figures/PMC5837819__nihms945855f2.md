caption: (Top) Drosophila Hh pathway. In the “signaling off “ state, Ci and its kinases
  PKA, GSK3 and CK1 form a large protein complex scaffolded by Cos2 and Fu, leading
  to its phosphorylation and proteolysis to generate a truncated repressor form that
  inhibits the expression of Hh target genes. In the “signaling on “ state, Hh binds
  Ptc and releases its inhibition of Smo, leading to Smo phosphorylation and activation.
  Smo interacts with Cos2/Fu and promotes Fu phosphorylation and activation but inhibits
  PKA/CK1-mediated Ci phosphorylation and processing. Activated Fu converts full-length
  Ci into an active form that stimulates the expression of Hh target genes.(Bottom)
  Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In the “signaling off “ state, β-catenin and its kinases
  GSK3 and CK1α form a destruction complex scaffolded by Axin and APC, leading to
  its phosphorylation and degradation. In the “signaling on “ state, Wnt binds Fz
  and LRP5/6, leading to phosphorylation of LRP5/6 by GSK3 and CK1. LRP5/6 phosphorylation
  on the PPPSP motifs recruits the destruction complex through Axin, leading to a
  blockage of β-catenin phosphorylation. As a consequence, β-catenin accumulates,
  translocate to the nucleus, and binds TCF to turn on Wnt responsive genes.
