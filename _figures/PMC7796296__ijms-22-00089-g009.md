caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in pro-migratory effects induced by the XCL1–XCR1
  axis in MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells: the interaction of XCL1 with
  its specific receptor XCR1 enhances phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which increases HIF-1α
  expression. HIF-1α accumulation promotes EMT by reducing E-cadherin, by enhancing
  N-cadherin and vimentin, and by increasing β-catenin nuclear translocation. Activation
  of the ERK/HIF-1α/EMT pathway is involved in the XCL1-induced promotion of MDA-MB-231
  and SK-BR-3 cell migration. XCL1, X-C motif chemokine ligand 1; XCR1, X-C motif
  chemokine receptor 1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; P, phosphorylation;
  HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; and EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition.'
