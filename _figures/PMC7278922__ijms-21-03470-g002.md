caption: Two distinct Fe/S cluster biosynthetic pathways exist in mitochondria (mitochondrial
  NFS pathway, left) and plastid (plastidial SUF pathway, right) in Arabidopsis. Sulfur
  from the L-cysteine (Cys) substrate is assembled into a nascent Fe/S cluster of
  the scaffold proteins, and then the cluster is transferred through carrier proteins
  before finally being incorporated into various Fe/S apo-proteins. As examples, the
  Fe/S proteins of the [2Fe-2S] type and of the [4Fe-4S] type (iron ions and sulfur
  atoms are indicated as brown and yellow dots, respectively) are shown.
