caption: Models of enzyme evolution that incorporate promiscuity and HGT. This simplified
  view illustrates trajectories leading to an enzyme that is specialized for a new
  function. Alternative fates of gene copies that retain the ancestral function (such
  as retention for gene dosage, pseudogenization, gene loss, or horizontal transfer
  into new hosts) are not shown. Likewise, the endpoints of each evolutionary pathway
  are shown to be functionally specialized, although examples in the text indicate
  that these endpoints can be multifunctional or promiscuous for the ancestral activity.
  Blue genes and proteins represent the original function, while hot pink represents
  the new function. Promiscuous enzymes are depicted as blue with light pink stripes,
  while bifunctional enzymes are depicted as hot pink with blue stripes. Each arrow
  is labeled with an evolutionary event (duplication/amplification, HGT, or mutation)
  and a symbol representing selection pressure on the event. Black symbols indicate
  selection pressure on duplication/amplification or HGT; blue symbols indicate selection
  pressure on enzymes retaining the original function; hot pink symbols indicate selection
  pressure on enzymes specializing for the new function; and purple symbols indicate
  selective pressure on enzymes carrying out either the ancestral or new activities.
  Positive selection is indicated by (+), purifying selection is indicated by (−),
  and neutral selection, or genetic drift, is indicated by (Ø). A) Neofunctionalization.
  The stage in parentheses is not in the original description of the model [] but
  illustrates how promiscuous activity could also be incorporated into a neofunctionalization
  model. Likewise, the upper symbols under the first two arrows indicate the selection
  pressure proposed by Ohno’s original model, and the lower symbols in parentheses
  indicate experimentally determined selective pressure on duplicated genes. B) Subfunctionalization.
  The expected selective pressures on function predicted by the DDC and EAC models
  are shown for the last stage of functional divergence. The specialization model
  (not shown) is similar to the EAC model, but it does not require equal degrees of
  positive selection to specialize each duplicate for different functions. C) Innovation-Amplification-Divergence.
  The diagram shows the IAD model as it would occur in a single strain. HGT (not shown)
  could occur at any point, as described in the text.
