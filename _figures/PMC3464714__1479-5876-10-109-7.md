caption: Possible involvement of AEG-1 in a p53 independent apoptotic pathway. After
  DNA-damage the MRN complex is recruited to the DNA break. AEG-1 is activated after
  DNA damage by an unknown mechanism, leading to NF-κB activation. The active p65
  subunit of NF-κB is required for p73 dependent Noxa gene expression, leading to
  apoptosis.
