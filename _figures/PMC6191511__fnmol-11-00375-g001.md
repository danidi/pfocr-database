caption: Functional analysis of genes differentially expressed in response to L-lactate
  after 1 h. (A) GO plots showing enrichment of biological processes and molecular
  functions for the genes differentially expressed after 1 h stimulation with L-lactate
  (135 genes, q-value < 0.1, three biological replicates, n = 3 independent cultures).
  Statistical significance for the enriched terms is based on the multiple testing-corrected
  p-value, which is color-coded. The number of genes associated with each respective
  term is indicated by the dot size. (B) A detailed KEGG graph of the MAPK signaling
  pathway with genes modulated by L-lactate at 1 h highlighted in green indicating
  that they are up-regulated. Dusp10 and Gadd45g are not indicated on the pathway
  map. Genes highlighted in red are genes down-regulated in the co-treatment condition
  with MK801 and L-lactate. (C) Bar plot showing fold enrichment of specific transcription
  factor binding sites in the promoters of genes modulated by L-lactate at 1 h (FDR
  < 0.001). Z-score is the main enrichment indicator and is obtained by dividing the
  rate of occurrence of a TFBS in the target set of genes to the expected rate estimated
  from the pre-computed background. The Fisher score is calculated as the negative
  natural logarithm of the one-tailed Fisher exact probability.
