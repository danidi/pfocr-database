caption: Serine biosynthesis and utilization. Serine can be imported into the cell
  or biosynthetically produced from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate
  (3PG) in a three step pathway. Flux through serine biosynthesis additionally drives
  the production of cytosolic alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG). Serine is catabolized to
  generate phosphatidylserine, sphingosine, cysteine, glycine or pyruvate, the latter
  conversion being restricted to non-transformed liver cells. The conversion of serine
  to glycine or the subsequent catabolism of glycine in the mitochondria provides
  one-carbon units for nucleotide biosynthesis and the methylation reactions of the
  cell. Key enzymes are shown in light blue.
