caption: 'Summary of the correlations between the DCM matrix mean values (B, C) and
  the individual BAS–drive scores (reward–drive or appetitive motivation) (Spearman''s
  r). There is no significant relationship between reward–drive scores and individual
  values of the effect of faces per se on both the amygdala and the ventral anterior
  cingulate cortex (DCM matrix C values — regardless of the emotional expression).
  In contrast, there is a statistically significant higher order negative correlation
  between the reward–drive score and the subject-specific effect of emotion (DCM Bilinear
  matrix B — angry vs. neutral context) on connectivity in the pathway from the ventral
  Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) to amygdala (B2,1) but again (as in the one sample
  t test, see Fig. ) not from AMY to ventral ACC (B1,2). DCM: Dynamic Causal Modeling.
  ROI: region of interest.'
