caption: 'Metformin enhances CD8+/CD4+ ratio to favor an immunoreactive microenvironment.
  The canonical pathway of metformin intracellular activity that results in 5′-AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) is shown. Presumably, this enhancement in AMPK and the consequent mTOR inhibition
  is attributed to the metabolic effects of metformin in promoting glycolysis through
  inhibited mitochondrial respiration; however, this was not experimentally shown
  in these studies and is represented by dotted lines. The ability of metformin to
  increase the CD8+/CD4+ ratio [,] was associated with increases in functional CD8+
  tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and concomitant increases in interleukin 2
  (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and interferon gamma (IFNγ) []. Decreases
  in Foxp3-driven CD4+ T cell phenotypes and the subsequent reduction in interleukin
  10 (IL-10) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) expression were also separately
  observed []. Cited experiments are denoted by their respective reference numbers
  [,]. CTC: cytotoxic CD8+ TILs, OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation, Treg: regulatory
  T cells. Blue arrows indicate upregulation/activation, red arrows indicate downregulation/inactivation
  and red T symbols indicate direct inhibition. Solid lines represent data presented
  in the cited manuscript; dotted lines indicate informed interactions from well-established
  data.'
