caption: A model illustrating balanced root hair tip growth. RHE-containing root hair-specific
  (RHS) genes are under the control of the putative root hair-specific transcription
  factor (RHF). RHS genes are divided into two subgroups, where RHS + (blue) enhances,
  but RHS − (red) inhibits root hair elongation. RHS10, a proline-rich RLK, may play
  a key negative role in root hair elongation by the global control of RNA degradation
  via RNS2, an RNase. On the other hand, RHS1, a calmodulin-like (CML) protein, may
  negatively affect root hair elongation through an unknown negative Ca2+signaling
  pathway. The balanced activities between RHS+ and RHS− will generate a specific
  root hair size under certain cellular and environmental conditions. Blunt end, negative
  action; arrow, positive action; solid line, experimentally supported; broken line,
  hypothetical.
