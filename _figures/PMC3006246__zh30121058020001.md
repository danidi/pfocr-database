caption: Schematic diagram of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)
  is synthesized as a 45-kDa precursor protein that undergoes cleavage to yield a
  26-kDa carboxy-terminal fragment and a 19-kDa amino-terminal fragment. The 19-kDa
  fragment is further modified by membrane bound O-acyltransferase Skinny Hedgehog
  (Ski), which covalently links a molecule of palmitate to the 19-kDa fragment. In
  the absence of Shh, Ptch inhibits Smo. Binding of Shh to Ptch results in the removal
  of the inhibition of Ptch on Smo and enables the passage of the signaling cascade
  and the activation of transcription factor Gli. The Hedgehog signaling pathway was
  blocked by treating mouse nontumorigenic gastric epithelial (IMGE-5) cells with
  Smo inhibitor cyclopamine (1), anti-Shh 5E1 antibody (2), or knockdown of Ski by
  transducing Ski short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into IMGE-5 cells by using a lentiviral
  vector (3) to inhibit the synthesis of biologically active Shh protein secreted
  from IMGE-5.
