caption: GRP-78/BiP chaperone protein represents one of the key molecules targeted
  by MDA-7/IL-24. The cytokine dissociates the complex formed between GRP-78/BiP and
  PERK allowing activation of PERK and EIF2α protein. This, in turn, affects the global
  translation of proteins resulting in loss of pro-survival proteins like c-Flip,
  Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2. Phosphorylated PERK also enhances the transcription of
  certain DNA damage response genes (i.e., GADD 34, GADD 45, GADD 153) in a PERK-dependent
  manner. Activation of PERK also results in increased levels of ROS and ceramide
  that affects autophagy pathway and triggers JNK and p38 signaling. Overall, these
  events disrupt the mitochondrial integrity by affecting the balance between pro-survival
  and pro-apoptotic proteins and eventually lead to growth inhibition and cell death
