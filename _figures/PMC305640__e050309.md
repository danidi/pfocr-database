caption: Fig. 9. Model of Xdsh domains mediating Wnt signaling and its role at the
  membrane. Wnt signaling components and the putative transducing domains in Xdsh
  are indicated in dark gray; the membrane translocation domain of Xdsh, the incoming
  putative tissue polarity signal as well as possible effects are depicted in light
  gray. Specific Wnt molecules bind and trigger the Frizzled receptors to transmit
  their respective intracellular signals (A or B, or both). Xdsh integrates different
  signals from Frizzled receptors and mediates a β–catenin-dependent pathway (A, dark
  gray) and a tissue polarity-like pathway (B, light gray), or both. Xdsh is modified
  via a kinase (P*). The DEP domain regions mediate the Xdsh accumulation at the membrane,
  which may lead to the regulation of G-protein signaling and Rho-mediated cytoskeletal
  rearrangements. The DIX region and the small N-DEP stretch of Xdsh may be brought
  into proximity by the PDZ domain and act in concert to transduce the Wnt signaling
  cascade that leads to β–catenin accumulation and nuclear signaling necessary for
  axis formation. Newly discovered Xdsh-interacting molecules (CKIɛ, axin, GBP and,
  indirectly, GSK-3) are indicated near the interacting Xdsh region.
