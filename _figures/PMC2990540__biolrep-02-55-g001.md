caption: (a) The inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) occurs
  primarily in the cytoplasm through the generation and amplification of kinetochore-generated
  signals that are balanced by the dissociation of inhibitory complexes. Checkpoint
  kinases (e.g., Mps1 and AurB) are thought to act on this dissociation pathway to
  stabilize the inhibited form of the APC/C. (b) These same kinases act at the kinetochore
  to activate and maintain the checkpoint through the regulation of the local generation
  of the wait signal. This activity keeps checkpoint generators such as the Mad1/Mad2
  and the Spindly/RZZ/dynein complexes localized to kinetochores through the action
  of kinases on scaffolds such as kinetochore-null 1 (KNL1) and checkpoint activators
  such as dynein. AurB, Aurora B kinase; Mad, mitotic arrest defective; MCC, mitotic
  checkpoint complex; Mps1, monopolar spindle 1; RZZ, rough deal, zeste white 10,
  zwilch.
