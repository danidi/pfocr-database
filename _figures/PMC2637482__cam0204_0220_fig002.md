caption: Crosstalk between Robo4/Slit2 and VEGF signaling pathways. Jones et al. suggests
  that Robo4/Slit2 signaling can negatively regulate angiogenesis. Activation of VEGFR2
  by VEGF-165 leads to the phosphorylation of SFK family member Src, which in turn
  stimulates downstream effector, Rac1 leading to angiogenesis and increased vascular
  permeability. Binding of Slit2 to Robo4 leads to signaling that blocks the VEGFR2
  signaling pathway.
