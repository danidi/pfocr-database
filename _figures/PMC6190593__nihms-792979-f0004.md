caption: The digestive tract of Drosophila melanogaster is highly regionalized, and
  is composed of the ectodermal foregut, the endodermal midgut and the ectodermal
  hindgut. The midgut is the primary site of digestion and absorption, and is protected
  by a chitinous membrane known as the peritrophic matrix. The midgut is subdivided
  into domains that have distinct physiological properties. The gut immune response
  is highly regionalized; the Toll pathway is active only in the foregut and hindgut,
  whereas the immune deficiency (Imd) pathway mostly regulates the immune response
  in the midgut. In response to Imd activation, different regions of the gut express
  different antimicrobial peptides (AMPs); this regional regulation depends on local,
  developmentally programmed cues (such as local expression of the transcription factor
  Caudal). The recognition of extracellular and intracellular bacterial components
  takes place in different gut regions; immune recognition in the midgut occurs by
  either membrane‑bound peptidoglycan recognition protein LC (PGRP‑LC) in the anterior
  midgut or by intracellular PGRP‑LE in the middle and posterior midgut. The gut epithelium
  also produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to both the natural microbiota
  and more virulent microorganisms by activating the NADPH oxidases dual oxidase (Duox)
  and Nox. Together with toxins, such as pore‑forming toxins (PFTs), excessive gut
  immune responses can cause tissue damage and enterocyte delamination, which is rapidly
  repaired through the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells.
  To decrease damage and maintain tissue homeostasis, negative regulators of the Imd
  pathway, such as poor Imd response upon knock‑in (Pirk) and the amidases PGRP‑LB
  and PGRP‑SC, prevent excessive activation of the immune response. Sensing of viral
  infection leads to the induction of antiviral extracellular signal‑regulated kinase
  (ERK) activation via a RAS mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the
  gut epithelium.
