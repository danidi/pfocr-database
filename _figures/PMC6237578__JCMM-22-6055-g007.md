caption: The mechanism for schematic diagram of pathological cardiac hypertrophy induced
  by TRPV3 activation. Under a variety of pathological stimuli, TRPV3 is activated,
  which in turn accelerates intracellular Ca2+ level in cardiac myocyte, further results
  in an increase in calcineurin/NFATc3 signalling pathway, and eventually leads to
  cardiac hypertrophy
