caption: The key components of ethylene signaling pathway. Gray and white circles
  depict negative and positive regulators of ethylene signaling, correspondingly.
  Position frequency matrix for Arabidopsis EIN3 binding motif () was retrieved from
  CIS-BP database () and visualized using Tomtom tool (http://meme-suite.org/tools/tomtom;
  ). The model is based on the findings reported previously (; ). The explanations
  are in the text. EBS, EIN3 binding site.
