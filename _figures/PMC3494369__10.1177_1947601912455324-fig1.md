number: Figure 1
caption: The Mdm2-MdmX-p53 signaling pathway. Mdm2 and MdmX expression is upregulated
  by p53 due to the presence of intragenic p53 promoter response elements (triangles).
  The subsequent increase in MDM proteins results in the inhibition of p53 functions
  due to p53 and Mdm2/MdmX complex formation.
