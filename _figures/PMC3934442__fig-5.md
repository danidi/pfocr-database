caption: Role of Rho/ROCK in cardiac hypertrophy. Pharmacological studies using ROCK
  inhibitors have shown that Rho/ROCK pathway mediates pathological cardiac hypertrophy
  in response to angiotensin II infusion and thoracic aorta constriction. Recent genetic
  mouse models have revealed that ROCK2, but not ROCK1, mediates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
  ROCK2 activates SRF and ERK through inhibition of FHL2. Both ROCK1 and ROCK2 contribute
  to myocyte apoptosis and interstitial fibrosis in pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase; FHL2, four-and-a-half
  LIM-only protein-2; SRF, serum response factor.
