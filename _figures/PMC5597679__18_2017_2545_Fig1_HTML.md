caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the molecular mechanisms for ATP release and
  hydrolysis, and ATP-induced Ca2+signalling in MSC. MSC release ATP constitutively
  through connexin (Cx) hemi-channels and in response to mechanical stimuli via vesicular
  exocytosis. Extracellular ATP are hydrolyzed to ADP and AMP by ecto-nucleoside triphosphate
  diphosphohydrolases (E-NTPDases) and ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase
  (E-NPP) and further to adenosine (Ade) by ecto-5′-nucelotidase (E-NT). Once outside
  the cell, ATP acts as an autocrine or paracrine signalling molecule by elevating
  the cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]c) through three molecular mechanisms.
  ATP can induce activation of the P2X7 receptor ion channel allowing extracellular
  Ca2+ influx. Alternatively, ATP can activate the P2Y1, P2Y2 and/or P2Y11 receptor,
  leading to sequential activation of Gα,q/11, phospholipase C (PLC), conversion of
  membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol triphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), activation of the receptor for IP3 (IP3R) and Ca2+
  release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Depletion of the ER Ca2+, upon activation
  of the Gα,q/11-PLC-IP3R signalling pathway or blockage of the sarco/endoplasmic
  reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) induces extracellular Ca2+ entry via the store-operated
  Ca2+ (SOC) or Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel. Stim1 acts as the ER Ca2+
  sensor via the EF-hand motifs located in the ER lumen (denoted by yellow strip)
  to monitor the ER Ca2+ level. Reduction in the ER Ca2+ level induces conformal changes
  in Stim1, leading to its translocation to and trapping at the ER-plasma membrane
  junction, where it interacts with the Orai1 protein to open the Ca2+-permeating
  channel. Further details and references are described in the text. The structural
  features of the P2X7 receptor, Orai1 channel and P2Y receptor are illustrated on
  the right
