caption: Working model. Downstream effectors of the cAMP, Epac and PKA, differentially
  affect cell proliferation in cultured normal and PCK rat cholangiocytes. In normal
  cholangiocytes, Epac activation stimulates proliferation, while PKA activation suppresses
  this process. These effects involved ERK1/2 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation,
  respectively. However, in PCK cholangiocytes, which over-express Epac1, Epac2 and
  PKA RIβ and have decreased intracellular Ca2+, Epac and PKA both increase cell proliferation
  via MEK-ERK1/2 pathway. PKA-stimulated hyperproliferation of PCK cholangiocytes
  appears to be associated with decreased intracellular Ca2+ levels in these cells.
  Restoration of intracellular Ca2+ levels in cystic cholangiocytes activates PI3K
  and AKT signaling, that subsequently inhibits the PKA-associated proliferation observed
  in the original situation of low intracellular Ca2+. Epac-associated proliferation
  is not affected by changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels.
