caption: Schematic representation of the potential disruption of the hepatic GHR-JAK2-STAT5b
  signal transduction pathway by TCDD. GH, secreted from the pituitary gland in a
  pulsatile fashion in male rodents, triggers dimerization of the cell-surface GHR,
  followed by recruitment and activation of the tyrosine kinase JAK2, and phosphorylation
  of a specific tyrosine residue in STAT5b. A STAT5b homodimer forms via symmetrical
  and mutual SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions, and this dimer translocates to the
  nucleus and binds to specific DNA response elements to influence the expression
  of STAT5b target genes such as Cyp2d9, Cis, and Mup2. TCDD diffuses through the
  plasma membrane and may disrupt this signaling pathway via AHR-dependent or AHR-independent
  mechanisms. We also assessed whether TCDD’s effects were accompanied by induction
  of two hepatic inflammatory markers (SAP and SOCS3).
