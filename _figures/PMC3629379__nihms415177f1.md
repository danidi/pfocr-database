caption: Central roles for BDNF in the beneficial effects of exercise, dietary energy
  restriction and cognitive challenges on brain health. Vigorous intermittent exercise,
  energy restriction and cognitive challenges activate excitatory neuronal circuits
  that employ glutamate at their synapses. Glutamate receptor activation results in
  calcium influx and activation of calcium/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent kinases. CaM
  kinases can stimulate local translation of BDNF mRNA in dendrites, and can also
  activate the transcription factor CREB which induces the expression of the Bdnf
  gene. BDNF activates high affinity receptors (trkB) in both the neuron in which
  it is produced and in adjacent neurons. Activated trkB engages the PI3 kinase–Akt
  kinase pathway which up-regulates the production of the indicated proteins involved
  in neuroplasticity (synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis) and neuroprotection. BDNF-independent
  adaptive stress response signaling pathways are also activated by exercise, energy
  restriction and cognitive challenges.
