caption: Schematic diagrams comparing 1O2-mediated and EX-dependent signaling in light-grown
  flu mutants following a dark-to-light shift (A) and in wild type exposed to a mild
  higher light/lower temperature stress (B). A The flu mutant suffers from an impairment
  of negative feedback control of tetrapyrrole synthesis. In the dark, the mutant
  overaccumulates Pchlide within chloroplast membranes. During re-illumination, excited
  Pchlide acts as a photosensitizer and generates highly reactive 1O2 by energy transfer
  to ground state 3O2. 1O2-mediated and EX-dependent signaling in the flu mutant operates
  as a default pathway that leads to an almost immediate loss of chloroplast integrity
  and a subsequent cell death. As indicated by question marks, it is not clear yet
  whether 1O2-responsive genes cause the loss of chloroplast integrity or chloroplast
  leakage is triggered by a separate 1O2-dependent mechanism. In flu, 1O2-mediated
  changes depend on EX1 and EX2 and are suppressed in flu/ex1/ex2 triple mutants.
  B In wild type exposed to mild light stress, chlorophyll associated with PSII rather
  than Pchlide acts as a photosensitizer. Besides 1O2, wild type under mild light
  stress produces enhanced amounts of H2O2. It is not known yet whether H2O2 antagonizes
  1O2-mediated responses directly by suppressing 1O2 production or indirectly via
  gene expression changes. 1O2-mediated chloroplast leakage and programed cell death
  are controlled by several modulators that in addition to H2O2 include the PLEIOTROPIC
  RESPONSE LOCUS (PRL) 1 protein () and stress acclimation triggered by pre-stress
  or 1O2-mediated gene expression changes. 1O2-mediated responses of plants exposed
  to mild light stress depend on EX1 and EX2 and are suppressed in ex1/ex2 plants

  description: Schematic diagrams comparing 1O2-mediated and EX-dependent signaling
