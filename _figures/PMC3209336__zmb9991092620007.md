caption: Schematic diagram of nitric oxide-activated AMPK activation in β cells. Nitric
  oxide induces IRE1-dependent phosphorylation of AMPK and subsequent AMPK-dependent
  phosphorylation of Raptor and ACC. The AMPK signaling node connects IRE1 to mTORC1
  in response to nitric oxide (black arrows) and is independent of the currently known
  AMPK kinases (gray arrows, indicating that they do not participate in this pathway).
  The direct effects of nitric oxide on IRE1 are currently unknown.
