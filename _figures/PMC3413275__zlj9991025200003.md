caption: Example of a target lesion biopsied and examined by microarray for epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway expression and activation (A) before and (B)
  after therapy. Each bubble represents the relative gene expression of a different
  gene/mRNA in the EGFR pathway (blue, above average expression; dark gold, average;
  gold, below average). Across the bottom are three previously defined EGFR activation
  signatures demonstrating activation in the pretherapy specimen and inactivation
  after 1 week of combination cetuximab plus chemotherapy. This patient experienced
  clinical response.
