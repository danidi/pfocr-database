caption: 'Nitrite may be reduced to NO by a variety of metal containing enzyme systems
  and the NO or the NO-modified proteins and lipids may in turn mediate cytoprotection
  against IR injury through any a variety of mechanisms. These mechanisms include:
  (A) S-nitrosation (and potentially N-nitrosation) of critical proteins involved
  in the signaling of apoptosis; (B) opening of mitochondrial KATP channels via the
  classic NO – cyclic guanidine monophosphate (cGMP) – protein kinase G (PKG) pathway
  which protects against cell death by preventing mitochondrial cytochrome c release,
  calcium overload and the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)
  pore; (C) Inhibition of complex I which reduces the direct production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) or the inhibition of complex IV which slows mitochondrial respiration
  and oxygen depletion during ischemia and thereby may minimize ROS production; (D)
  NO and NO-modified proteins have been associated with a variety of anti-inflammatory
  effects which minimize tissue injury after IR.'
