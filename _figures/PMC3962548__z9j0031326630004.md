caption: Controlling clot formation. Many natural inhibitors of coagulation target
  the amplification units that include tissue factor (initiator), factors VIIIa and
  Va (amplifying cofactors), and factor Xa (shared by intrinsic and extrinisic pathways).
  Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) blocks the tissue factor pathway. The protein
  C pathway minimizes factors VIIIa and Va activities. This pathway on endothelial
  cells is responsible for making the activated protein C (APC) enzyme by the combined
  efforts of the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), thrombin, and thrombomodulin
  (TM). In concert with protein S (PS), activated protein C cleaves cofactors VIIIa
  and Va which slows clotting by orders of magnitude. APC also activates PAR-1, initiating
  signaling pathways that contribute to endothelial barrier protection. Antithrombin
  is the primary natural inhibitor of thrombin, but it also has broad specificity
  for several coagulation enzymes including factors IXa and Xa. Antithrombin activity
  is accelerated orders of magnitude by heparin and becomes a specific of factor Xa
  in the presence of low-molecular-weight heparin. Hirudin, originally derived from
  leech salivary glands and now available as a recombinant peptide, is a specific
  inhibitor of thrombin. The new chemical anticoagulants target factor Xa, at the
  junction of both arms of the coagulation cascade.
