caption: NF-kB signaling pathway. In resting cells, the dimeric transcription factor
  NF-kB, composed of p50 and p65, is sequestered in the cytosol, bound to the inhibitor
  I-kB. Stimulation by TNF-α or IL-1 induces activation of TAK1 kinase (step 1), leading
  to activation of the trimeric I-kB kinase (step 2a). Ionizing radiation and other
  stresses can directly activate I-kB kinase by an unknown mechanism (step 2b). Following
  phosphorylation of I-kB by I-kB kinase and binding of E3 ubiquitin ligase (step
  3), polyubiquitination of I-kB (step 4) targets is for degradation by proteasomes
  (step 5). The removal of I-kB unmasks the nuclear-localization signals (NLS) in
  both subunits of NF-kB, allowing their translocation to the nucleus. Copyright 2011
