caption: Model of potential cobalamin precursor exchange among UCC community members.
  The two types of B12 producers (adenylylcobamide versus adenosylcobinamide) are
  shown at the top and the auxotrophs are shown at the bottom. Intermediates that
  are predicted to be salvaged are shown in the middle; HBA, hydrogenobyrinic acid;
  Cbr, cobyrinate a,c-diamide; Cby, cobyrate; Cbi-GDP, cobinamide-guanosine diphosphate.
  Arrows between intermediates depict the order (earliest to latest from left to right)
  in which they enter the cobalamin biosynthetic pathway. Pseudo-B12 (PsB12) has an
  adenine rather than a 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) at the alpha-axial ligand
  position. Note that auxotrophs at the far bottom right are unable to make use of
  precursors produced by the cyanobacteria.
