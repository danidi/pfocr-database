caption: Regulation of the Hippo pathway in smooth muscle cells. Several stimuli,
  such as mechanical stress, ECM stiffness and TP receptors regulate the Hippo pathway
  and the nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ by modulating the activity of Rho GTPases
  or remodelling the actin cytoskeleton. The target genes of proliferation, phenotypic
  modulation, migration and apoptosis in smooth muscle cells are regulated by YAP/TAZ,
  which contribute to the development of aortic aneurysm and pulmonary hypertension.
