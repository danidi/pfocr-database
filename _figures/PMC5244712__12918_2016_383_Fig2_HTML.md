caption: 'Predicted central metabolic fluxes for (a) diazotrophic and (b) photoautotrophic
  cells of T. erythraeum. Flux balance analysis was used to predict fluxes for both
  metabolic modes in a trichome of T. erythraeum. The thickness of the arrows depicts
  the amount of flux through the reaction normalized to the uptake of the carbon source.
  Dotted gray lines are available unused pathways. Diazotrophic cells have high flux
  through respiratory pathways, this protects nitrogenase from oxygen. As expected,
  photoautotrophic cells have high fluxes in the Calvin Benson Basham Cycle, which
  is the carbon fixing pathway. Abbreviations for metabolites are provided in abbreviations
  section. Full catalog of fluxes are provided in Additional file : Table S5'
