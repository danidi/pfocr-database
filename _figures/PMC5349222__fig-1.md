caption: Simplified model of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop. Both
  STN and GPi are common targets for Parkinson's therapy. Glu, glutamatatergic; GABA,
  GABAergic; GPe, globus pallidus external segment; GPi, globus pallidus internal
  segment; STN, subthalamic nucleus; VA/VL, ventral anterior/ventrolateral. Important
  circuit elements not shown include cortical innervation of STN (hyperdirect pathway),
  dopaminergic inputs to striatum and extrastriatal areas via the substantia nigra
  pars compacta, and the substantia nigra pars reticulata as a basal ganglia output
  nucleus.
