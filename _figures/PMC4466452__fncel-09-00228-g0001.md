caption: 'Schematic representation of identified molecular targets involved in ELFEF-induced
  enhancement of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and osteogenesis. Experimental evidence
  demonstrates that ELFEFs affect key molecular players involved in the up-regulation
  of pro-neuronal genes in hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs, upper panel) and bone-related
  genes in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, lower panel). In hippocampal NSCs ELFEFs
  enhance pro-neuronal gene expression by a mechanism involving: (i) Ca2+-dependent
  phosphorylation/activation of CREB and its binding on pro-neuronal gene promoters;
  (ii) increased recruitment of the HAT CREB-binding protein (CBP) on the same regulatory
  sequences; (iii) enhanced histone 3 (H3) acetylation on lysine 9 (H3Ac) of pro-neuronal
  gene promoters (i.e., NeuroD1 and Neurogenin1). In MSCs ELFEF-induced up-regulation
  of bone-related genes has been also linked to intracellular Ca2+signaling and enhanced
  expression of the transcription factor Runx2 which is known to bind the regulatory
  sequences of osteogenic genes promoting their expression. Question marks indicate
  putative common molecular targets of ELFEFs in NSCs and MSCs including: (i) Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling regulating pro-neuronal and osteogenic gene expression at transcriptional
  and epigenetic levels; (ii) activation of p300 or other HATs by Runx2, resembling
  the pCREB/CBP pathway activated by ELFEFs in hippocampal NSCs.'
