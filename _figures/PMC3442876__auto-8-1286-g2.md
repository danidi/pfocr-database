caption: Figure 2. The multifaceted roles of autophagy in immunity. The many currently
  recognized roles of autophagy in innate and adaptive immunity have been steadily
  increasing in complexity. Normal autophagy function contributes to balanced immunity
  responses, resulting in protection against disease. Imbalanced autophagy results
  in maladaptive responses and more severe disease. Here “diseasome” stresses more
  on convergence of different diseases as “every road leads to Rome” in which autophagy
  may be a common pathway.
