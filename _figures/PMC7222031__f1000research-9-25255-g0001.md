number: Figure 2.
caption: A. Classical role of PVR in synapse signaling, tweaking the immune response
  toward a pro-tumoral profile. B. Using an antagonistic mAb directed against PVR
  would block its interaction with TIGIT, CD96, and DNAM-1. This would partially inhibit
  the signaling pathway, as the synapse would be maintained by Nectin-2 but with a
  much weaker affinity. Upon blockade, DNAM-1 expression would be upregulated in effector
  cells. APC, antigen-presenting cell; DNAM-1, DNAX accessory molecule-1; mAb, monoclonal
  antibody; NK, natural killer; PVR, poliovirus receptor; TIGIT, T Cell Immunoreceptor
  with Ig and ITIM domains.
