caption: Schematic depiction of the strategy employed for mining the O-Man glycoproteome
  in cell lines with knock-out of COSMC, POMGNT1, POMT1, and POMT2. A, knock-out (KO),
  indicated by a red cross, of the two enzymes POMGnT1 and COSMC abrogates elongation
  of O-Man (left)- and O-GalNAc (right)-type glycosylation, respectively, resulting
  in truncated homogeneous O-glycan structures limited to O-Man and O-GalNAc. The
  POMGnT2-dependent elongation of O-Man glycans (left) is not affected. Knock-out
  of POMT1/2 abrogates the initiation of the classical O-Man glycosylation pathway.
  Solid and dashed lines represent single and multiple biosynthetic steps, respectively.
  B, quantitative differential labeling of isogenic HEK293 cells using stable dimethyl
  isotopes; total cell lysate tryptic digests from COSMC/POMGNT1 double KO and COSMC/POMGNT1/POMT1/POMT2
  quadruple KO are differentially labeled with stable isotopes, mixed in a 1:1 ratio,
  and enriched for O-Man and O-GalNAc glycopeptides by ConA or VVA LWAC, respectively.
  Enriched glycopeptides from both LWAC steps are identified and quantified by nLC-MS/MS.
