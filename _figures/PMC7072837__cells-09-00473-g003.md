caption: EV71-induced changes in metabolism of epithelial cells. Vero cells were infected
  and extracted for metabolomic analysis as described in . The features of interest
  were extracted, and the validated metabolites of interest were mapped onto biochemical
  pathways. The levels of metabolites are expressed relative to those of mock-infected
  cells. The arrow indicates the metabolic pathway, and the dashed one indicates the
  transport of biomolecules. Data are mean ± SD (n = 9). * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
  *** p < 0.005, significant difference from mock-infected cells.
