caption: 'Co-expression network of 106 genes associated to the FA metabolism in P.
  tricornutum. The co-expression network can visually be divided into two subclusters.
  Subcluster 1 (blue, left square) contains mainly genes of the mitochondrial TCA
  cycle and β-oxidation. Subcluster 2 (red, right square) includes genes of the plastidial-located
  de novo FA synthesis and the endoplasmatic n-3 LC-PUFA biosynthesis. Color code:
  TAG biosynthesis (light purple); TCA cycle (red); ACCase (acetyl-CoA carboxylase);
  de novo FA and HTA (16:3n-4) synthesis (light blue); Predicted elongases and desaturases
  (dark blue); Predicted EPA pathway (turquoise); Acetyl-CoA precursors and transporter
  (light red); Acyl-CoA synthetases, ATpase4 (gray); Mitochondrial or peroxisomal
  located β-oxidation and FA elongation (yellow); Kennedy pathway, phospholipid-,
  glycerolipids, sphingolipid and sterol biosynthesis (green); Ca2+-dependent lipid-binding
  protein, amid hydrolase, DHHC palmitoyltransferase, serine incorporator, ATP-binding
  protein (ABC) transporter (purple). Shapes in the cluster indicate the localization
  of enzymes encoded by the gene: Triangle, mitochondria; Square, chloroplast; Diamond,
  peroxisome; Circle, no prediction. Transcription data of five microarray datasets
  from P. tricornutum submitted to GEO, NCBI (GSE12015, GSE17237, GSE31131, GSE42039
  and GSE42514; [,,,,]) were used to construct based on log2 expression ratios from
  the experiments, an unweighted co-expression network by using Cytoscape (version
  2.8.3) and the force directed drawing algorithm []. The network represents 106 genes
  related to lipid metabolism with similar transcriptional profiles and includes 311
  calculated gene-pairs with Pearson correlation values r > 0.85.'
