caption: Control of MDSC by cytokines. (A) Inflammatory environments lead to expansion
  of MDSC by activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway by several factors including
  granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; ); macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor (M-CSF; ); IL-6 (); peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARγ;
  ); vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF; ; ); stem cell factor (SCF; ); IL-13
  (); Hps72 (); and fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L; ). Agonists of the COX2
  pathway also result in expansion of MDSC, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), IL-1β, and IFN-γ (). The complement anaphylatoxin C5a is also described to
  induce MDSC (). (B) Blockade of SCF/c-kit interaction or SCF blockade by siRNA reduce
  MDSC expansion (). The combination of IL-4 and GM-CSF inhibits MDSC function by
  inducing their differentiation into mature DC (; ).
