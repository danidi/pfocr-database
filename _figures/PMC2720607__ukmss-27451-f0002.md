caption: Principal enzymes and substrates of the folate pathway involved in formation
  of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and its utilisation in the thymidylate cycle. Other enzymes
  involved in the interconversion of tetrahydrofolate forms modified at the N5 and
  N10 positions of the pteroate moiety are not shown. Salvaged pre-formed folate feeds
  into the pathway, commonly in the form of folic acid or folinic acid (from culture
  medium) or 5-MeTHF (from host plasma), and modified appropriately. pABA can also
  be salvaged from the above sources or synthesised de novo from the shikimate pathway.
  Note (1), the triphosphate group is removed before the DHNA step, thought to be
  by non-enzymatic loss of pyrophosphate and subsequent removal of the final phosphate
  by a non-specific phosphatase activity. Note (2), polyglutamated forms are the preferred
  substrates for folate pathway enzymes and the predominant forms within the cell.
  It is not known whether newly synthesised folate in P. falciparum is polyglutamated
  at the DHF or THF stage (or both). For simplicity, it is shown here as occurring
  at the THF stage (large brackets), but omitted from substrate names in the thymidylate
  cycle. Activities targeted by the components of Fansidar, pyrimethamine (PYR) and
  sulfadoxine (SDX), are indicated. GTPC, GTP cyclohydrolase I (EC 3.5.4.16); DHNA,
  dihydroneopterin aldolase (EC 4.1.2.25); PPPK, hydroxymethyldihydropterin pyrophosphokinase
  (EC 2.7.6.3); DHPS, dihydropteroate synthase (EC 2.5.1.15); DHFS, dihydrofolate
  synthase (EC 6.3.2.12); DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase (EC 1.5.1.3); FPGS, folylpolyglutamate
  synthase (EC 6.3.2.17); SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.1); TS,
  thymidylate synthase (EC 2.1.1.45).
