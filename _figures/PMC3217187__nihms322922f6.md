caption: Tao-1 directly phosphorylates Hpo at T195 in the kinase activation loop,
  leading to the activation of Wts and inhibition of Yki, which remains cytoplasmic
  when phosphorylated. In the absence of HSW pathway activity, Yki translocates to
  the nucleus to promote transcription of target genes that promote growth and inhibit
  cell death. Genetic and biochemical experiments position Tao-1 upstream of Hpo and
  suggest that Mer and Ex function through Tao-1 to activate HSW signaling. Kibra,
  Mer and Ex can form a protein complex and promote HSW activation, but it remains
  unclear if Kibra functions upstream or in parallel to Tao-1.
