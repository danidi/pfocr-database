caption: Gene expression within cluster MCL2 is enriched in genes affecting NK cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity. Fold change in gene expression from MCL2 is shown on the KEGG pathway
  map (modified from map04650, natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity, at the Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [KEGG] website http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg1.html,
  with permission). KIR2DL, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase
  Cγ (PLCγ) depicted in this pathway are represented by multiple gene transcripts
  in MCL2; in these cases genes are colored according to the transcript with the largest
  fold change in expression within a multigene or transcript family (KIR2DL4, PI3KCD,
  and PLCG2). Participants with disease and infection had the greatest changes in
  gene expression (shown on the map by increasing intensities of red). Onto-tools
  Pathway Express expression perturbation analysis based only on differentially regulated
  genes (<0.5 and >2.0 at an adjusted P value of <0.01) comparing healthy subjects
  with diseased and infected subjects also identifies NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity
  as substantially affected. An overlapping effect on antigen processing and presentation
  related primarily to NK cell activity was also observed. The impact factor is the
  estimated effect on each pathway as a result of changes in transcript expression
  in addition to enrichment.
