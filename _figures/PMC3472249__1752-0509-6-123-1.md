caption: Proteomics based network model showing differential expression of proteins
  in canonical cancer pathways and the intricate involvement of Meq, via hypothesized
  CD30-NF-κB-Meq pathway. Canonical Network model of proteome data using differential
  proteomic expression (CD30hi compared to CD30lo) mapped against cancer specific
  KEGG pathway “Pathways in cancer” and further modified by adding published Meq interaction
  and hypothesized Meq-CD30-NF-κB-Meq pathway. Light black solid lines indicate direct
  interaction, dotted lines indicate indirect interaction. Red dotted lines indicate
  our hypothesized CD30-NF-κB-Meq pathway. Literature based Meq interacting proteins
  are indicated by dark black lines originating from Meq.
