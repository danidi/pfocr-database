caption: Vitamin D and its receptor (VDR) in the cytokine-mediated onset of depression.
  (A) Stress and/or infection activate the inflammatory response resulting in inflammatory
  cytokines production. These cytokines can trigger the kynurenine (KYN) pathway by
  stimulating indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO). Therefore, tryptophan enters the
  KYN pathway instead of the serotonergic pathway, resulting in the depletion of monoamines.
  Once the KYN pathway is triggered, kynurenic acid (KA) in astrocytes and quinolinic
  acid (QUIN) in microglia are synthesized. QUIN contributes to the activation of
  N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) itself and by inhibiting glutamate re-uptake,
  resulting in excessive extracellular glutamate, inducing further NMDAr agonism.
  Excessive NMDAr activation leads to the disruption of the glutamatergic system,
  a key pathological feature in mood disorders. (B) The binding of vitamin D to VDR
  in a number of immune cells (e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, B
  cells, T cells, astrocytes and microglia) leads to attenuation of the inflammatory
  response and stimulation of anti-microbial peptides production, potentially ameliorating
  symptoms of mood disorders. However, certain pathogens can also block or modulate
  epigenetic VDR activity.
