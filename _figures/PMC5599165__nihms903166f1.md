caption: 'Schematic representation of the major pathways involved in excitation-contraction,
  and relaxation coupling in GI smooth muscle. RhoA/ROCK may be activated either by
  G-protein coupled receptor activation or independent of it. The complex of RhoA.GDI.GDP
  usually reflects inactive state of RhoA. It transforms via RhoGEFs into an active
  RhoA.GDI.GTP complex formation. GEFs catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP on RhoA.
  RhoGAP drives the reaction in the reverse direction. Activated RhoA/ROCK leads to
  the phosphorylation of MLC20, and subsequent contraction via these different pathways.
  First, there is inhibition of MLCP through its regulatory subunit MYPT1. Second,
  there is phosphorylation of CPI-17 and subsequent inhibition of MLCP via its catalytic
  subunit PP1c. Finally there is MLCK-like activity. Shown on the left side, RhoA/ROCK
  may either activate PKC directly or via PLD1/PA/DAG. There is growing evidence in
  different smooth muscle systems that PKC may lie upstream of RhoA/ROCK pathway (denoted
  by bidirectional arrow). In contrast with the multiple pathways for the phosphorylation
  of MLC20 as in the case of RhoA/ROCK, the major target for the PKC is CPI-17. Interestingly,
  phosphorylation of CPI-17 is not limited to RhoA/ROCK and PKC, but other kinases,
  such as ZIP kinase, and ILK can mediate this event.Green arrows and substrates indicate
  stimulation, red lines and substrates indicate inhibition.* = hypothetical sites
