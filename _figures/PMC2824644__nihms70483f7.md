caption: Our findings verify that TNF-induced IκBα degradation and classical NF-κB
  activation is critically dependent upon NEMO and IKKβ (left). Similarly, IL-1 signaling
  absolutely requires intact NEMO (right). However, IL-1-induced IκBα degradation,
  NF-κB nuclear translocation, and NF-κB transcriptional activity occurs in the absence
  of IKKβ, demonstrating that NEMO and IKKα can form a signaling complex capable of
  activating the classical NF-κB pathway in response to certain pro-inflammatory stimuli.
