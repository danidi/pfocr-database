caption: Arid5a translocation and association with adipogenesis and obesity. (A) In
  the resting stage, Arid5a usually resides in the nucleus. Arid5a is imported via
  an importin-α/β1 pathway. UPF1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. During
  inflammation, toll-like receptor 4 signaling is activated by lipopolysaccharide,
  and Il-6 expression is induced by NF-κB. Arid5a interacts with the Il-6 mRNA, and
  Arid5a is subsequently exported to the cytoplasm via the CRM1 pathway with UPF1.
  (B) Arid5a and Ppar-γ2 in adipogenic homeostasis. Cebp activates Ppar-γ2, and both
  are involved in adipogenesis. Immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells, infiltrate
  adipose tissues and provide a framework to regulate energy homeostasis. In adipose
  tissue, these cells secrete cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-17, which induce Arid5a.
  Arid5a further represses Ppar-γ2 transcription in fibroblasts, thereby inhibiting
  adipocyte development and inhibiting adipogenesis and obesity.
