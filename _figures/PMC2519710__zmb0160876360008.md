caption: Circuit representations of ROS effects on the HIF1α pathway. (A) Coherent
  feed-forward loop type 4 in hypoxia, where ROS blocks PHD2 expression, leading to
  upregulation of HIF1α; another upregulation of HIF1α by ROS may come as a direct
  dependency of oxygen availability. (B) Incoherent type 1 feed-forward loop, where
  ROS may increase HIF1α through limiting O2 availability, ferrous iron, and Asc or
  decrease HIF1α by increasing 2OG and Fe2+ or donating O2 in hypoxia. (C) Incoherent
  type 2 feed-forward loop, where ROS blocks HIF1α through PHD2 or independently by
  donating O2 in hypoxia. (D) Incoherent type 3 feed-forward loop, where ROS increases
  2OG and Fe2+ or, conversely, blocks PHD2. (E) Succinate follows a coherent type
  4 mechanism to increase the HIF1 response by blocking PHD2 or possibly by independently
  signaling a limitation in O2 availability. (F) A coherent type 4 loop can describe
  the effects of hypoxia on HIF1α, through PHD2-dependent and O2-independent mechanisms
  (e.g., the AKT pathway).
