caption: Model for the Slc3a2-mediated signaling pathway regulating YSN localization
  and cell–cell fusion in the YSL. (A) Slc3a2 is involved in integrin outside–in signaling,
  which activates c-Src, which in turn inhibits RhoA. Microtubule arrays in the YSL
  then are retained, contributing to regular YSN localization and normal cell–cell
  fusion. (B) slc3a2 knockdown abolishes c-Src activation; hence, microtubule networks
  in the YSL are disrupted by increased RhoA/ROCK activity in the YSL, thereby causing
  YSN clustering and enhanced ectopic cell–cell fusion.
