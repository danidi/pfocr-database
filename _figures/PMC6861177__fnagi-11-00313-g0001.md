caption: Mitochondrial quality control. (A) Mitochondrial unfolded protein response.
  Refolding or degradation of mitochondrial misfolded/unfolded proteins is mainly
  mediated by molecular chaperones and proteolytic enzymes in the mitochondria. (B)
  Dynamic remodeling and repair of mitochondrial fission and fusion. Mitochondrial
  fission is regulated by dynamin-related GTPase (DRP1) and FIS1, while mitochondrial
  fusion is regulated by MFN1/2 and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1). (C) Mitophagy. The PINK1–Parkin-mediated
  mitophagy pathway can mediate the formation of autophagosomes. (D) Mitochondrial
  biogenesis. Mitochondrial biogenesis is mainly regulated by PGC-1α and nuclear respiratory
  factors 1 and 2 (NRF1/2).
