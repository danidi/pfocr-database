caption: 'RNAs that regulate nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). At the first stage
  of NHEJ, the p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) binds to the break region. The synthesis
  of the protein is controlled by miR-34a. Next, the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and DNA-dependent
  protein kinases (DNA-PKcs) are recruited to the damaged region. The stability of
  these three factors mRNA is controlled by the following miRNA: miR-124, miR-502
  and miR-545 (Ku70); miR-526b, miR-622 and miR-218–5p (Ku80); miR-101 and miR-874-3p
  (DNA-PKcs). Furthermore, long intergenic radiation-responsive ncRNA1 (LIRR1) suppresses
  the expression of Ku70 and Ku80 by activating p53. lncRNA in nonhomologous end-joining
  pathway 1 (LINP1) to participate in the assembly of a complex with Ku80 and DNA-PKcs.
  “Bridge” RNA could hold together the DNA strands in the break area. At the last
  stage, DNA ligase IV and its cofactor X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 4
  (XRCC4) link the free ends of the DNA, eliminating the break. Expression of DNA
  ligase IV and XRCC4 is controlled by miR-4727-5p and miR-151a-3p correspondingly.
  These miRNAs are blocked by lncRNA radiation-induced (lnc-RI) and SBF2 Antisense
  RNA 1 (SBF2-AS1).'
