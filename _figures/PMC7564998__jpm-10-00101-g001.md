caption: 'Oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, axonal transport, and glutamate
  excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). An increase in oxidative
  stress can result from defects in detoxifying pathways. Such defects include the
  loss of SOD1 function, aberrant DNA damage repair machinery, or a decrease in expression
  of antioxidant genes affecting the NRF2-ARE pathway. Oxidative stress can also be
  increased by the stimulation of ROS production via increased NADPH oxidase activity
  or from disrupted mitchondrial respiratory chain activity. Mitochondrial activity
  can be affected by several ALS mutations, such as those leading to the accumulation
  of protein aggregates, or to decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and transport, or
  to increased cytosolic Ca2+ (as observed when glutamate receptor activity is stimulated
  or when the Ca2+-buffering capacity is decreased). Consequently a disruption of
  the mitochondrial respiratory chain will lead to an increase in ROS production and,
  thus, to an accumulation of oxidized proteins, lipids, DNA, and RNA. Oxidative damage
  occurring over time may then stimulate apoptotosis and, thus, cell death. Defective
  axonal transport affects not only the mitochondria but, also, the transport of other
  proteins and RNA, with consequences on the axon structure and function being accompanied
  by neurofilament accumulation. Defective glutamate uptake by astrocytes, and/or
  a defect in glutamate receptor clearance or in AMPA or GABA receptors, can lead
  to increased Ca2+ permeability and can impact the post-synaptic hyperexcitability
  and mitochondrial function. ARE: antioxidant response element, AMPA2: α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
