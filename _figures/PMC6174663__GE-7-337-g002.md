caption: 'Signaling pathways implicated in the hypertrophic response: the SAPKs, calcineurin/NF-AT3,
  and a putative costimulatory pathway. Hypertrophic stimuli (e.g., cell stretch or
  neurohormonal mediators including Ang II, ET-1, and α-adrenergic agents) lead to
  an increase in cytosolic-free [Ca2+]. This, together with calmodulin, activates
  the protein phosphatase, calcineurin, and likely also plays a role in activation
  of the SAPKs, although the pathway connecting the increase in [Ca2+] to SAPK activation
  is unclear. Calcineurin dephosphorylates the transcription factor, NF-AT3, exposing
  a nuclear localization signal and allowing NF-AT3 to be imported into the nucleus.
  Upon activation, the SAPKs translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and
  activate the transcription factors, c-Jun, and one or more TCFs (Elk-1 or SAP1).
  Activated TCFs likely induce transcription of c-fos. By analogy with the costimulatory
  pathway of T cells, the signals from these two parallel pathways may be integrated
  at the promoters of various hypertrophic response genes by complex formation of
  c-Fos, c-Jun, and NF-AT3. Also shown are the pharmacologic inhibitors of calcineurin,
  CsA and FK506, and SEK-l(KR), the dominant inhibitory mutant of the immediate upstream
  activator of the SAPKs.'
