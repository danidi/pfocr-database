caption: Known and proposed pathways of l-hydroxyproline and l-proline metabolism.
  A, known mammalian l-hydroxyproline pathway. B, known general l-proline pathway.
  C, novel l-hydroxyproline pathway of bacteria. Gray-colored reaction is hypothetical.
  αKGSA is produced from alternative metabolic pentose pathways and acid-sugar pathways
  from bacteria (B) and archaea (A).
