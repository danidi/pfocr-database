caption: Pathways for L-Tyrosine and L-Phenylalanine biosynthesis in E. coli and plants.
  (a) shows the pathway for both amino acids from the intermediate chorismate in E.
  coli. Abbreviations in the diagram include PheA (chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydratase),
  TyrA (chorismate mutase, prephenate dehydrogenase), and TyrB (tyrosine aminotransferase).
  (b) depicts the plant pathway for the synthesis of the amino acids from the common
  intermediate L-Arogenate.
