caption: 'Red lines indicate pathways that promote obesity; green lines indicate pathways
  that protect. Undigested carbohydrates are fermented by the intestinal microbiota
  to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), primarily acetate (60%), propionate (20–25%),
  and butyrate (15–20%). SCFA can signal through G protein-coupled receptor 41 (GPR41)
  on enteroendocrine cells, inducing the secretion of peptide YY, which can contribute
  to obesity through slowing transit time thus increasing energy extraction from food,
  or can protect against obesity by increasing satiety. SCFA are readily absorbed
  and contribute up to 10% of caloric intake, can increase adipogenesis by binding
  GPR41 on adipocytes. In the liver, acetate is a substrate for cholesterol synthesis
  and lipogenesis. Locally, butyrate increases the epithelial tight junctions, blocking
  the translocation of LPS, a potent inflammatory mediator that increases weight gain,
  total body and liver adiposity, and insulin resistance. Similarly, the mucus layer
  can also block LPS translocation. Inflammasome dysfunction allows translocation
  of bacterial products, which induce hepatic TNFα expression and drive non-alcoholic
  steatohepatitis (NASH) in a TLR4/TLR9-dependent manner, in mice with other risk
  factors (e.g. methionine choline deficient diet). Loss of TLR5, which senses bacterial
  flagellin, leads to a dysbiosis in the microbiome, increased inflammatory cytokines,
  hyperphagia, insulin resistance, and diabetes in the context of a high fat diet.
  The NASH and metabolic syndrome phenotypes in inflammasome- and TLR5- deficient
  mice are transferrable via the microbiome to germ-free wild-type (wt) recipients,
  demonstrating the roles of the altered microbiome in adiposity. Inset: Deleting
  any component of the lymphotoxin pathway results in loss of control of the microbiome
  and blocks the ability of mice to gain weight on high-fat diet. Co-housing lymphotoxin
  receptor-deficient and wt mice restores diet-induced obesity and partially restores
  a wt/HFD microbiota.'
