caption: Schematic model of the hypothetic assembly of a PKA microdomain beneath the
  NMJ. Amongst other potential roles at the NMJ, PKA-RI is critical for proper lifetime
  regulation of AChR. At least a part of these regulatory processes appears to be
  linked to the endocytosis/recycling of AChR. From the endocytic compartment, AChRs
  may either return to the postsynaptic membrane (recycling) or be routed to a degradation
  pathway. To carry out its function, PKA-RI needs to be recruited to endocytic/recycling
  vesicles which transport AChR and those vesicles are to be tethered close to the
  postsynaptic membrane in order to receive local rises of cAMP levels. Anchoring
  of PKA-RI to these vesicles is mediated by rapsyn, while myo5a serves to restrain
  endocytic/recycling vesicles in the actin-rich cortex underneath the NMJ. First
  messengers triggering the relevant local rises in cAMP levels are still elusive
  and they might originate from motoneurons, sympathetic nervous system or other sites.
