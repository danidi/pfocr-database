caption: 'A model depicting mechanism of apoptosis in RSV infected prostate cells.
  Model for the mechanism of apoptosis in RSV infected PC-3 prostate cancer cells
  – apoptosis occur in PC-3 cells due to high (↑) level of RSV infectivity and inhibition
  (↓) of NF-κB activity following RSV infection. NF-κB inhibition results in down-regulation
  (↓) of anti-apoptotic molecules and activation (↑) of pro-apoptotic proteins. The
  major mechanism (shown with solid arrows) comprises of activation of mitochondria-dependent
  intrinsic pathway: the pathway that is activated following induction (↑) of pro-apoptotic
  proteins [and suppression (↓) of anti-apoptotic proteins] leading to change in mitochondrial
  membrane potential and release of cytochrome-c which can activate caspase-9. Active
  caspase-9 then activates the “executioner” caspase, caspase-3 to induce apoptosis.
  The minor mechanism (shown with broken arrows) involves induction of death-domain-mediated
  extrinsic pathway; which is accomplished via the paracrine/autocrine action of TNF-α
  (upon binding to the TNF-α receptor/TNFR) produced from infected cells. Binding
  of TNF-α to its receptor (TNFR) results in activation of caspase-8; which in turn
  activates caspase-3 leading to apoptosis.'
