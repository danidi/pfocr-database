caption: The proposed model represents key molecular components and metabolic processes
  known to be involved in plant-pathogen interactions based on KEGG, for which bean
  orthologs have been identified in our EST collection with significant statistical
  support (p≤0.05). Gene Ontology (GO) categories and Enzyme Codes (EC) inside boxes
  are differentially represented in the bean EST libraries (arrowheads pointing down
  represent down-regulation and arrowheads pointing up represent up-regulation). Continuous
  arrows represent established relationship between components of the pathway and
  intermittent arrows represent undirected relationship. Components of PAMP-triggered
  immunity (PTI) are depicted to the right of the diagram.
