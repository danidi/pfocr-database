caption: 'Cell cycle progression: JARID1A and JARID1B promote G1-S progression through
  repression of CDK inhibitors and Cyclin D upregulation. PI3K pathway activation:
  JARID1B’s repression of the PTEN and SHIP1 phosphatases can enhance activation of
  the PI3K/Akt pathway. Akt activation increases JARID1B expression indicating a putative
  feed forward loop of increasing PI3K activity. By contrast, phosphorylation of JARID1A
  as a direct Akt substrate excludes it from its actions in the nucleus as a result
  of PI3K signaling. EMT, invasion, and metastasis: JARID1A, JARID1B, and JARID1C
  are all linked to promotion of these effects by multiple mechanisms. Hypoxia: JARID1B
  is a direct HIF1α target gene that is upregulated by hypoxia, and similar HIF1α-independent
  effects are reported for JARID1A and JARID1C. At the same time, O2 substrate deprivation
  reduces the catalytic actions of all isoforms but also may produce a qualitative
  shift toward demethylase-independent effects. Excessive genomic instability: JARID1B
  and JARID1C can participate directly in the DNA damage response and may prevent
  exhaustion of a stem cell-like tumor cell fraction by limiting excess cancer genome
  instability and conferring resistance to DNA-damaging drugs. Tumor promoting effects
  that are potentially targetable by JARID1 inhibition are indicated by bold lines.'
