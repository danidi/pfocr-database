caption: Pathway and enzymes of dimethylsulfone degradation in Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans
  S1. Reduction of dimethylsulfone [DMSO2; (CH3)2SO2] to dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO;
  (CH3)2SO] and further reduction of DMSO to dimethylsulfide provides the substrate
  for DMS monooxygenase. Formaldehyde is either assimilated (via the serine cycle)
  or oxidized to CO2 providing reducing equivalents. Sulfide is oxidized to sulfate;
  see reference  for further details.
