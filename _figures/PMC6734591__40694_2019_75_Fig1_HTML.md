caption: Model for the regulatory function of PKA in the cAMP pathway. Adenylate cyclase
  ACY impacts cAMP dependent function of PKA. The regulation of plant cell wall degrading
  enzymes by PKA is in parts mediated via phosphorylation of the carbon catabolite
  repressor CRE1 and the photoreceptor complex of BLR1 and BLR2. Function of the photoreceptor
  ENV1 on the BLR-complex overlaps with PKA regulation regarding enzyme production.
  The regulatory effect of ENV1 in part shows a cAMP level dependent output. PKA further
  positively impacts sexual development as well as production of secondary metabolites
