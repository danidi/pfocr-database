caption: 'Several signalling pathways can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition
  in pancreatic cancer cells for example Notch, transforming growth factor-β, Midkine,
  hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and tumor necrosis factor-α. EMT phenotype is associated
  with gemcitabine resistance; however, the signalling pathway relating EMT factors
  (e.g., Snail, Twist and Zeb1) to gemcitabine resistance is not clearly identified,
  although ENT1 and CNT3 upregulation was observed in KPC mice models with deleted
  Snail or Twist. EMT independent pathways can also lead to gemcitabine resistance
  for example MAPK activation, transporter proteins, and gemcitabine metabolising
  enzymes (e.g., CDD). MRP1: Multidrug resistance protein1; CDD: Cytidine deaminase;
  TGFβ: Transforming growth factor-β; MK: Midkine; HIF1α: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α;
  TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor-α; EMT: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; ENT1: Equilibrative
  nucleoside transporter 1; CNT3: Concentrative nucleotide transporter.'
