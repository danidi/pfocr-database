caption: Collagen XVII (C XVII) ectodomain (Ecto) shedding modulates α6β4 integrin-driven
  motility and proliferation of wound keratinocytes. In resting skin collagen XVII
  and α6β4 integrin are part of the hemidesmosomal adhesion complexes and the continuously
  shed collagen XVII ectodomain (low shedding rate) is integrated into the basement
  membrane (BM). During cutaneous wound healing, when the hemidesmosomes (HDs) at
  the wound edges are disrupted via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated
  phosphorylation of the β4-subunit, collagen XVII shedding is strongly induced. The
  released ecto- and endodomains have a repressive function on keratinocyte velocity
  and proliferation through dampening of α6β4 integrin-driven Akt/ mechanistic Target
  of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation. While the released ectodomain is part of
  the newly formed BM surface topography, the membrane tethered endodomain stump seems
  to be involved in cell-intrinsic motility via formation of the front-to-rear polarity
  (Figure adapted from []).
