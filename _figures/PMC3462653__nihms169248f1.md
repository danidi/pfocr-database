caption: Following recognition of a microbe, or unknown Plasmodium ligand, by soluble
  PGRP molecules, the Toll pathway is stimulated by binding of the ligand Spätzle
  with the Toll transmembrane receptor. This triggers a series of molecular events
  that culminate in the activation (*) and translocation of Rel1 into the nucleus,
  up-regulating transcription of immune genes that are responsible for microbial killing.
  The IMD pathway is stimulated when the transmembrane PGRPLC receptor binds peptidoglycan
  or an unknown Plasmodium ligand that leads to the cleavage of Rel2-F and translocation
  of active Rel2-S (*) into the nucleus. A different set of anti-Plasmodium genes
  are up-regulated when the IMD pathway is stimulated. Branching of the IMD pathway
  is indicated, but the JNK pathway has not been extensively characterized in Anopheles
  mosquitoes.
