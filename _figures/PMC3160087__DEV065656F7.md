caption: Model of the role of the Nodal and Cripto signaling pathways in mouse XEN
  cell differentiation. (A) Nodal signaling through Alk4 is Cryptic dependent and
  leads to Smad2 phosphorylation. This canonical pathway eventually leads to visceral
  endoderm and AVE differentiation (blue dashed arrow). (B) In the absence of Nodal,
  Cripto can signal through Alk4 to promote Smad2 phosphorylation, which may lead
  to visceral endoderm and AVE differentiation; this Cripto activity could conceivably
  be mediated through Alk4 binding by an unknown TGFβ ligand that is distinct from
  Nodal. However, the ability of Cripto to promote visceral endoderm and AVE differentiation
  is at least partially independent of Alk4 kinase activity and Smad2 phosphorylation,
  as it is not blocked by SB431542. Thus, Cripto can also signal in a non-canonical
  pathway (red dashed lines), either through Alk4 in a kinase-independent manner through
  an unknown signal transducer `X' or through an unknown cell-surface receptor `Y'
  that can also mediate visceral endoderm and AVE differentiation. VE, visceral endoderm;
  AVE, anterior visceral endoderm.
