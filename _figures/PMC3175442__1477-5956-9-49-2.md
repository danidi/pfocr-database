caption: Map of pentose phosphate pathway (Genego Metacore) overlapped with quantile-normalized
  estimations of protein abundance. Flags indicate direction of change (red, up-increased,
  blue; down-decreased) and fold change (length) of protein abundance in relation
  to solvent control. 1, IGF-1 and 2, Resveratrol. Results were expressed as mean
  for three replicate experiments for each treatment group.
