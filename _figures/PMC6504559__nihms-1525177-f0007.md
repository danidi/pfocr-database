caption: 'Schema of possible mechanisms of action of MyD88−/− donor T cells during
  aGVHD. Various receptor signaling pathways have been shown to use MyD88 as an adaptor
  protein, including all TLRs except TLR3, the IL-1 superfamily of receptors, and
  recently the IL-15 receptor. We propose a two-pronged approach as to how MyD88 Tcons
  are able to resist Treg-mediated suppression. First, signaling through MyD88 activates
  the PI3K/AKT pathway. Shortly after conditioning for transplant, the damage caused
  by the conditioning leads to release of various DAMPs, PAMPs, and alarmins that
  can activate TLR and IL-1R superfamily signaling. The loss of lymphocytes after
  conditioning also causes excessive IL-15 to be available. IL-6 is produced and released
  through IL-1R and TLR signaling and can bind to the IL-6R on other Tcons. Both IL-6
  signaling and MyD88 signaling can activate the PI3K/AKT pathway. Through a yet to
  be defined mechanism, others have proposed that hyper-activation of PI3K/AKT signaling
  promotes resistance of Tcons to suppression by Tregs. Second, we show that sST2
  production in Tcons is reduced in MyD88−/− Tcons; however, how MyD88 regulates sST2
  production is still unknown. sST2 released by Tcons can bind free IL-33, preventing
  IL-33/ST2 signaling on Tregs and Th2. IL-33/ST2 signaling on Tregs and Th2 has been
  shown by numerous groups to promote Treg function. Blocking sST2 with a neutralizing
  antibody has been shown to increase Treg frequency and ameliorate experimental aGVHD.
  We hypothesize that MyD88−/− Tcons have less PI3K/AKT activation and secrete less
  sST2, allowing the Tcons to be better repressed by Treg cells. Solid lines: direct
  effect; Dashed lines: indirect effect; dotted lines: proposed effect.'
