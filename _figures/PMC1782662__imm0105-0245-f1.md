caption: Model of cellular signalling by CpG-DNA. CpG-DNA (either as a free molecule
  or encapsulated in whole bacteria) is taken up by an immune cell, for instance a
  dendritic cell (DC). After processing through a chloroquine-sensitive pathway, signalling
  starts by engagement of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9). The proteins myeloid differentiation
  factor 88 (MyD88), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) and tumour necrosis
  factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) activate cellular kinases such as IκB-kinase
  (IKK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and signal transduction on these
  well-known pathways leads to gene induction and evokes effector functions such as
  cytokine secretion. An alternative or parallel pathway (see the text for details)
  has been suggested to involve the activation of DNA-PKcs by direct, cytoplasmic
  binding of CpG-DNA, leading to IKK activation and nuclear factor (NF)-κB induction.
