caption: Schematic showing the activation of complement by the alternative pathway.
  The alternative pathway of complement is constituently active where the protein
  C3b becomes deposited on all surfaces. (A) In the absence of host regulatory proteins,
  complement factor B (FB) binds the deposited C3b forming a complex that is susceptible
  to the proteolytic cleavage by factor D (FD). The cleavage of FB bound to C3b creates
  an active C3 convertase capable of cleaving C3 into C3b; the C3 convertase is stabilized
  by the binding of factor P (FP, also known as properdin). This is the start of the
  amplification loop of complement that leads to a rapid and uncontrolled deposition
  of C3b onto the surface (opsonisation), labeling it for uptake by phagocytosis,
  accompanied by the release of the potent anaphylatoxin, C3a. This amplification
  loop feeds into the terminal pathway of complement; (B) where the formation of the
  C5 convertase releases another anaphylatoxin, C5a, and eventually leads to the formation
  of the membrane attack complex (MAC) that is inserted into the membranes of cells
  causing lysis and death; (C) Complement factor H (FH) derived from the blood, or
  locally in the eye following secretion by the RPE, is recruited to host surfaces
  through interactions with polyanions (charged sugar molecules). FH can compete off
  FB from deposited C3b preventing the formation of the C3 convertase. Furthermore,
  FH acts as a co-factor for factor I (FI) that can cleave C3b into inactive C3b (iC3b).
  Inactive C3b is unable to bind FB to form a new C3 convertase and cannot therefore
  stimulate a runaway amplification loop.
