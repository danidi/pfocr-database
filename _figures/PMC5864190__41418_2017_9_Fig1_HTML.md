caption: Models of RIPK1 regulation by IKKα/β and MK2 phosphorylation. a RIPK1 regulates
  signaling downstream of several innate immune receptors. Cell death is generally
  not the default response of these receptors. Upon ligand binding, RIPK1 is recruited
  to the receptor signaling complex where its platform function contributes to the
  activation of the NF-κB and/or MAPK pathways for prosurvival and proinflammatory
  gene expression. The feedback phosphorylation of RIPK1 by IKKα/β and MK2 maintains
  RIPK1 in a prosurvival mode. b Certain pathogens, such as the Yersinia genus of
  bacteria, express inhibitors (YopP/J) of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways in an attempt
  to evade host defenses. Under these conditions, RIPK1 is not properly phosphorylated
  by IKKα/β and MK2, which leads to its kinase activation and results in apoptosis.
  The cell demise generates signals that activate anti-bacterial defenses. c. Certain
  members of the TNF superfamily, such as TWEAK, induce degradation of a pool of cIAP1/2
  to activate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. The reduced levels of cIAP1/2 in the
  cell affects proper activation of the MAPK and canonical NF-κB pathways by TNF.
  As a result, RIPK1 phosphorylation by IKKα/β and MK2 is affected and the cell succumb
  by RIPK1 kinase-dependent cell death
