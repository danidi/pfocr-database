caption: 'Schematic representation of the postulated signaling of MAP kinase pathway
  in proliferating or differentiating HL60 cells. A: In the early stage of HL60 cell
  differentiation, when proliferation still continues (hematopoietic lineage amplification),
  activation of ERK MAP kinase pathway is important in regulating proliferation-related
  genes, such as c-myc, Ets, and other targets. B: In the later stages of HL60 cell
  differentiation activation of both MEK-1 and ERK kinases is low, while the activation
  of RAf-1 signaling is continuously increasing, and appears to activate downstream
  targets such as p90RSK, while bypassing the MEK/ERK module. KSR-1 may amplify the
  Raf-RSK pathway, and result in phosphorylation of targets such as C/EBPβ. The C/EBPβ
  is one of the effectors of monocytic differentiation, perhaps through a C/EBP element
  present in the promoter of the monocyte marker CD14.'
