caption: (A) Second-site mutations can reinstate oncogene function while abrogating
  inhibitor activity, as exemplified by BCR-ABL gatekeeper mutations as an inhibitor
  resistance mechanism. (B) Mutations in oncogene pathway components can reinstate
  pathway signaling despite continued oncogene inhibition, as exemplified by MAP2K1
  mutations as a resistance mechanism for BRAF inhibitors. (C) Mutational or non-mutational
  activation of bypass signaling pathways can render cancer cells independent of the
  original oncogene, as exemplified by MET activation as a resistance mechanism for
  EGFR inhibition.
