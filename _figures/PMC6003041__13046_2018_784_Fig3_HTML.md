caption: Regulation of SREBP1 and lipid metabolism by oncogenic signaling in CSCs.
  Oncogenic PI3K (H1047R)- and K-Ras (G12 V) activates SREBP1 and SREBP2 to support
  de novo lipid synthesis and cell growth. The mTOR signaling regulates SREBP1 level
  through both transcriptional or translational mechanisms. Activation of PI3K.AKT/mTOR
  signaling pathway or FGFR3 leads to stabilization of SREBP1 protein and promotes
  SREBP1 translocation to nucleus. Mitotic kinase Cdk1 and Plk1 physically interact
  with nuclear SREBP1 protein. Sequentially phosphorylation of SREBP1 by Cdk1 and
  Plk1 blocks binding between the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7 and SREBP1 and attenuates
  SREBP1 degradation. Upon EGFR signaling activation, the nuclear form of PKM2 physically
  interacts with SREBP1, activating SREBP target gene expression and lipid biosynthesis
