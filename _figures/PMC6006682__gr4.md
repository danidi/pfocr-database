caption: 'Representative coverage of Calvin-Benson cycle enzyme. KEGG pathway map
  adapted for the ‘Calvin-Benson cycle’ module of ‘Carbon fixation in photosynthetic
  organisms’ (www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?cre00710). Boxes represent proteins
  in the pathway and are labeled with Enzyme Nomenclature numbers. Proteins are colored
  according to modifications found in this study: red for redox coverage only and
  purple for identification of both redox and phosphorylation sites. Proteins are
  abbreviated by either UniProt or KEGG gene names. An asterisk (*) marked PGK1 to
  show that it was identified with reversible oxidation in the preliminary experiment,
  but not in the LFQ datasets.'
