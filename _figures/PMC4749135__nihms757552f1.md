caption: A. In viruses, PRF events result in synthesis of C-terminally extended fusion
  proteins. In many virus families (e.g. Retroviridae, Totiviridae), rates of -1 PRF
  determine the stoichiometric ratios of capsid (pink Gag) to replicase (pink+blue
  Gag-pol) proteins. Correct ratios are critical for viral particle assembly. B. Canonical
  ‘genomic’ -1 PRF signals or poly(A) tracks (blue triangle) can direct an elongating
  ribosome to a -1 frame premature termination codon (PTC). The recognition of the
  PTC by the ribosome results in activation of nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD)
  pathway and subsequent degradation of the transcript through a process of decapping
  and deadenylation followed by exonucleolytic degradation by Xrn1p (5′ → 3′) and
  the Ski complex (3′ → 5′).
