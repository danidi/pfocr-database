caption: IR-61 selectively targets ATMs via the endocytosis pathway and preferentially
  accumulates in the mitochondria. IR-61 induces transiently increased mitochondrial
  ROS and promotes phosphorylation of Akt and Acly, which further potentiates mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation by increasing the content and activity of the mitochondrial
  complexes to inhibit pro-inflammatory macrophage (M1) activation, and improve obesity
  and associated disorders, such as insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis.
