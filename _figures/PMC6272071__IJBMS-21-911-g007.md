caption: The mechanism of effect of exercise and middle-age on cardiac hypertrophy.
  Middle age is decreasing plasmatic Klotho and increases heart tissue oxidative stress.
  Increased oxidative stress is associated with increased amounts of p38 and ERK1.2,
  which leads to pathological hypertrophy. But exercise increases the amount of Klotho
  in middle-aged samples and provides a physiological hypertrophy
