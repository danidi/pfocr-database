caption: Role of Cic in Ras-MAPK signaling and growth control. (A) Regulation of Cic
  repressor activity via MAPK signaling in Drosophila. In the absence of RTK/RAS/MAPK
  signaling, Cic acts as a default repressor by binding to specific Cic-binding sites
  (CBS) in its target genes (left). Upon RTK activation, RAS proteins become GTP-bound
  and initiate a phosphorylation cascade via the kinases Draf (RAF ortholog), Dsor
  (MEK ortholog) and the MAPK Rolled (ERK ortholog) causing phosphorylation of Cic,
  which in turn results in its degradation and/or nuclear exclusion (right). As a
  consequence, Cic target genes are transcriptionally induced (derepressed) at specific
  times and places during development. This induction depends on transcriptional activators
  (A) which remain only partially characterized. Two confirmed activators of Cic targets
  are Dorsal and Zelda, which activate the intermediate neuroblasts defective gene
  in the early embryo [,,]. Zelda also appears to activate tailless, [] another embryonic
  Cic target [,,]. See also panel B and [] and []. (B) Summary of Cic regulatory interactions
  in Drosophila growth control. In addition to its role downstream of Ras signaling,
  Cic mediates cross-interactions with the Hippo (Hpo) pathway and other regulatory
  inputs. For example, both Cic and the Sd:Yki co-activator complex regulate a common
  set of target genes, which become induced upon simultaneous reduction of Hpo signaling
  (leading to Sd:Yki upregulation) and Cic repressor activity. Some of these targets,
  including the Ets transcription factor Pnt [,] and the bantam microRNA, [,,,] are
  directly controlled by both Cic and Sd/Yki, whereas the input of Sd:Yki on other
  targets appears to be indirect, possibly via JAK/STAT signaling []. This latter
  set of targets includes negative feedback regulators of Ras signaling such as Argos
  and Sprouty, whose activity is represented by a dashed loop. bantam has also been
  proposed to function in a negative feedback loop to downregulate Cic expression
  levels. Finally, recent evidence linking Mnb kinase activity to both Cic [] and
  Hpo signaling [] (not included in the model) implies the existence of additional
  layers of crosstalk. Cic and Sd are DNA binding proteins and are represented by
  ovals. The correspondence between Drosophila proteins illustrated in the diagram
  and their mammalian orthologs is indicated on the right. See main text for further
  details.
