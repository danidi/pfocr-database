caption: Activation and negative regulation of NF-κB and STAT3. (A) Activation of
  NF-κB in response to the stimulation of TNFR1, IL-1R, or TLRs. A20 is induced by
  NF-κB in the TNFR1, IL-1R, or TLRs pathways, functioning as a negative feedback
  loop. (B) Activation and negative regulation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. The
  activation of STAT3 is mediated in response to cell surface receptor (growth factor
  or cytokine receptors) stimulation that leads to the recruitment and activation
  of the JAK family of kinases, which, in turn, phosphorylate STAT3. Phosphorylated
  STAT3 dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they directly regulate gene
  expression. This activation loop can be turned off by PIAS and SOCS proteins.
