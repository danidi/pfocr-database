caption: Pyruvate and glutamate transformations enable TCS RspA1/A2-dependent regulation
  of glucose metabolism in Streptomyces albus. Pathway 1 represents the flux of pyruvate
  converting to TCA cycle; Pathway 2 represents the flux of glutamate transformation
  to glucose through TCA cycle; Pathway 3 represents gluconeogenesis pathway. → Up-regulated
  in the original strain A30; ---→ Down-regulated in the original strain A30; → Positive
  control; —| Negative control.
