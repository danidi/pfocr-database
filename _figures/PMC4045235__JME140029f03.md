caption: The CUL7-OBSL1-CCDC8 pathway and its predicted role in cell growth. OBSL1
  interacts with both CUL7 and CCDC8 (solid connections shows protein–protein interactions)
  all three associate with the mRNA splicing machinery with particularly high abundance
  of HNRNPs in the 3-M interactome. Alternative splicing of the Insulin receptor (INSR)
  is modulated by CUL7, OBSL1 and CCDC8, IRS-1 is also a target of the CUL7 E3 ubiqutin
  ligase and this impacts on downstream signalling upon growth factor stimulation
  leading to dysfunction in MAPK and AKT activation. This subsequently results in
  a reduction of cell proliferation in cells derived from 3-M syndrome patients.
