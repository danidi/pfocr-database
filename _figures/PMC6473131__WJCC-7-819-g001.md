caption: 'Possible mechanisms of cancers caused by Porphyromonas gingivalis. When
  Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) infects the host, the expression of the
  B7-H1 receptor is activated, contributing to anergy and apoptosis of activated T
  cells, which eventually leads to immune evasion. Nucleoside diphosphate kinas (NDK)
  from P. gingivalis antagonizes ATP activation of purinergic receptor (P2X7) receptors
  and thus reduces the production of interleukin-1β and promotes tumourigenesis. NDK
  also phosphorylates heat shock protein 27 (HSP27); the phosphorylation of HSP27
  and ATP activation of P2X7 receptor both inhibit apoptosis. The upregulation of
  miRNA-203 leads to inhibition of the negative regulator suppressor of cytokine signaling-3
  (SOCS3), and SOCS3 can play a role of inhibiting JAK/STAT3 signalling, while the
  activation of Jak1/Akt/Stat3 signalling pathways and the increased Bcl2: Bax ratio
  induced by P. gingivalis infection both curtail the release of cytochrome c and
  block the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 that positively correlate with apoptosis.
  By activating the ERK1/2-Ets1, p38/HSP27, and PAR2/NF-kB signalling pathways, P.
  gingivalis induces the expression of proMMP-9, and the levels of MMPs also substantially
  increase after P. gingivalis infection; both consequently promote the invasion of
  tumour cells. P. gingivalis causes the host to be in a chronic inflammatory state.
  Inflammatory factors, such as IL-6 and IL-8, are subsequently released; the former
  causes DNA hypomethylation and tumourigenesis, and the latter inhibits the levels
  of MMPs and makes connections with the invasion of tumour cells. Additionally, the
  metabolism of carcinogenic substances and the activation of TRL are involved in
  tumourigenesis as well. NDK: Nucleoside diphosphate kinase; P2X7: Purinergic receptor;
