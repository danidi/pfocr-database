caption: 'Putative catabolic pathway of lignin derived monomers and catabolism genes
  in Comamonas serinivorans SP-35. H type pathway. Symbol “?” means the enzyme encoding
  gene was un-confirmed. The reactions indicated by dashed arrows have not been confirmed.
  Abbreviations: Numbers represent the aromatic compounds were shown in Table , and
  the circled numbers representing the number of enzymes are shown in Table'
