caption: Model of Cmpd1-mediated modulation of Stat3 signaling and the role of the
  MEK-Erk1/2 pathway and Cmpd1-dependent induction of mTOR, p38, Akt, Hsp27, and Src
  signaling in human glioma cells. Cmpd1 mediates inhibition of Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation
  (pY705Stat3) and Stat3-dependent gene transcription in parallel with the upregulation
  of pS727Stat3, which is dependent on MEK-Erk1/2 induction, and Cmpd1 further upregulates
  mTOR(pS2448), p38 (pT180/Y182), Akt (pS473), Hsp27 (pS78/82), and Src (pY416) induction
  in glioma U251MG cells. ?, not definitively determined; ↑, induction; ↓, suppression.
