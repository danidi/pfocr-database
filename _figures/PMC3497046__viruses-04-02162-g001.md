caption: A) Schematic representation of arenavirus life cycle. Boxed regions refer
  to B) and C). For details, please see text. B) Biosynthesis of GPC in the ER with
  SSP cleavage by signal peptidase and maturation by the cellular protease SKI-1/S1P
  along the secretory pathway. The myristoylation modification and lysine 33 are also
  shown. Note that while LASV GP is cleaved early in the ER, LCMV GP is cleaved later
  in Golgi/TGN []. C) Arenavirus virion structure showing the tripartite GP protein
  complex, the Zinc finger matrix protein (Z), the RNA dependent polymerase (L), the
  nucleoprotein (NP) and the negative single stranded ambisense RNA genome.
