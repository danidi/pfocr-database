caption: Model of redoxosomal signaling for IL-1β and TNFα pathways. In the resting
  state, the cell expresses Nox, an anion channel(s) (AC), and IL-1R1 or TNFR1 on
  the plasma membrane. Following receptor binding by IL-1β or TNFα, pathway-specific
  early effectors (MyD88 or TRADD) are recruited to their cognate receptor at the
  plasma membrane and initiate endocytosis. Rac1 recruits Nox into the early endosome
  by tethering (indirectly or directly) the receptor to the Nox complex. Phox subunits
  (p47phox and p67phox in the case of Nox2) are recruited to the newly formed endosomes
  to produce superoxide-generating redoxosomes. It is currently unclear at which point
  SOD1 is recruited to Rac1 on redoxosomes. However, this process appears to be important
  for maintaining Rac1 in a GTP-bound active state. Membrane-impermeable superoxide
  generated in the redoxosome lumen may spontaneously dismutate to hydrogen peroxide
  and pass through the endosomal membrane and out of the redoxosome. Alternatively,
  a DIDS/NFA-sensitive chloride channel may transport the superoxide out of the redoxosome,
  where it is subsequently converted to hydrogen peroxide. The localized production
  of hydrogen peroxide at the redoxosome surface leads to transmission of redox-specific
  signals to either the receptor or one of the downstream effectors (IRAK/TRAF6 or
  TRAF2), allowing for docking of these TRAF effectors and subsequent activation of
  pathway-specific IKKKs. These IKKKs in turn phosphorylate the IKK complex, which
  leads to NFκB activation. The redoxosomal-signaling pathway is downregulated as
  the build up of cytosolic hydrogen peroxide oxidizes Rac1 on the surface of the
  endosome, and this causes disassociation of SOD1 from Rac1 (not shown). In the absence
  of SOD1 binding to Rac1, Rac1 quickly hydrolyzes GTP and becomes inactive, leading
  to the termination of Nox-dependent superoxide production. (For interpretation of
  the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
