caption: Model of the cellular responses to ER stresses in yeast. ER stress can induce
  the UPR involving Ire1 (1), cell cycle delay at G2/M involving Swe1 (2), a cell
  death pathway (3), and the cell integrity MAP kinase cascade involving Pkc1 and
  Mpk1, which stimulates the Cch1-Mid1 Ca2+ channel and calcineurin signaling (4).
  Calcineurin and Mpk1 also antagonize cell death and Pkc1 regulates transcription
  of genes encoding ribosomal subunits and other phenomena known as the arrest of
  secretion response (ASR).
