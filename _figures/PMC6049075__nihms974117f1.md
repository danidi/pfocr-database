caption: Trafficking pathways in human and yeast ER-endolysosomal systems. (a) Receptor-mediated
  endocytosis of LDL particles (containing sterol-esters) and their trafficking through
  the endosomal pathway to late endosomes/lysosomes, where cholesterol-esters within
  LDL particles are degraded into free cholesterol. Free cholesterol must then leave
  the lysosome lumen in an NPC1-dependent manner and traffic to the plasma membrane
  (PM) and/or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). At the ER, the SREBP system senses local
  cholesterol levels. Low ER cholesterol induces the translocation and proteolytic
  cleavage of SREBP-2 at the Golgi, producing a soluble transcription factor which
  enters the nucleus. (b) The ER-endolysosomal system of budding yeast Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae. The ER is partitioned into distal cortical ER (cER) and nuclear ER (nER),
  which makes direct contact with the vacuole/lysosome via the nER vacuole junction
  (NVJ)
