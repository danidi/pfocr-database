caption: KEGG pathway enrichment analyses of genes that were found to be differentially
  expressed upon resibufogenin treatment. A. Distribution of TOV-21G transcriptome
  sequences among KEGG pathways. All 13 apoptosis and migration-related pathways are
  shown. LgP is the negative logarithm of P-value; larger LgP values indicate smaller
  P-values. B. The differentially expressed genes that participate in the PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway mapped in KEGG. C. The differentially expressed genes that participate
  in actin cytoskeleton pathway mapped in KEGG. The tree displays the log-transformed
  value of average fold changes. Red indicates up-regulated gene expression levels,
  whereas blue indicates down-regulated expression levels of genes. D. The differentially
  expressed genes that participated in the actin cytoskeleton signaling pathway mapped
  in KEGG. E. The brief graph of the differentially expressed genes that participated
  in the actin cytoskeleton signaling pathway mapped in KEGG.
