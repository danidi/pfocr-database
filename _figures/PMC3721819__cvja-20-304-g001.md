caption: 'The classical NO signalling pathway. Endothelial cells lining the lumen
  of blood vessels express endothelial NO synthase (eNOS ), which produces physiological
  concentrations of NO . NO diffuses into the underlying vascular smooth muscle cells
  (VSMC) where the sGCcGM P-PKG pathway is activated and ultimate inhibition of the
  L-type calcium channel takes place, leading to VSMC relaxation and vasodilatation.
  sGC: soluble guanylate cyclase, GT P: guanosine triphosphate, cGM P: cyclic guanosine
  monophosphate, PKG: protein kinase G.'
