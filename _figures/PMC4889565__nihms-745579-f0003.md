caption: Unbiased analysis of transcriptomics reveals that a 48-hour toxic exposure
  Nevirapine significantly regulates bile acid synthesis (FDR 0.1, p < 0.05) resulting
  in increased expression of several key genes. (A) Ingenuity pathway analysis of
  predicts an increase of bile acids and bile salts suggestive if intracellular accumulation
  (Inset). A 48-hour toxic exposure to Ritonavir (B) also regulates bile acid synthesis
  (FDR 0.1, p < 0.01) but downregulates the expression of the same genes with a predicted
  decrease of bile acids and bile salts. Ritonavir significantly inhibits key efflux
  transporters like ABCB4 indicating a different mechanism of intracellular bile acid
  accumulation (Inset).
