caption: Two networks diagrams generated by ingenuity pathway analysis with the 85
  genes. The associated network functions of network 1 (a) were cell-mediated immune
  response, cellular development, and cellular function and maintenance and included
  19 of the 85 genes, with a score of 47, and those of network 2 (b) were gene expression,
  cellular development, and cellular growth and proliferation, and included 15 of
  the 85 genes, with a score of 31. The networks are based on known protein–protein
  interactions and functional relationships. The intensity of gene (node) color in
  the networks indicates the degree of hypermethylation (red) or hypomethylation (gray).
  Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of
  gene products
