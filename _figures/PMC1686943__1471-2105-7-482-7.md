caption: The Petri net model of the mating pheromone response pathway of S. cerevisiae.
  The Petri net, modelling the signal transduction pathway of the mating pheromone
  response in S. cerevisiae. The meaning of the places is listed in Table 3 and of
  the transitions in Table 4. The logical nodes are coloured in grey. A logical node
  is identified by its name and exists in multiple copies in the net, which are logically
  identical. This construct is mainly used to avoid immoderate arc crossings. The
  transitions, which are contained in the seven MCT-sets of Table 5, are coloured
  differently.
