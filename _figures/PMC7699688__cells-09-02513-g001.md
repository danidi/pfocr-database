caption: Neuronal Ca2+ as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Schematic
  of Ca2+ dysregulation in neurons in AD that could be used as potential targets.
  In AD, Ca2+ dysregulation is present in many of the different compartments within
  neurons. In the plasma membrane, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and receptor
  operated Ca2+ channels, including N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and nicotinic
  acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), allow for the influx of Ca2+ ions into the neuron
  after depolarization or ligand binding, respectively. Both Aβ and tau overactivate
  these channels and increase their function (A). In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
  Ca2+ is released via ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  receptors (IP3Rs) to the cytosol after stimulation. Ca2+ is then extruded by the
  sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pump, which actively consumes ATP while
  bringing Ca2+ into the lumen. AD-associated presenilin (PS) mutations impair IP3R
  and RyR signaling, increasing Ca2+ release into the cytosol, and diminish SERCA
  activity, increasing cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Following ER Ca2+ depletion,
  the stromal-interacting molecule (STIM) interacts with the Orai channel in the plasma
  membrane to activate the store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway. SOCE is decreased
  by diverse familial AD (FAD) PS mutations and by soluble Aβ. Lastly, in order to
  facilitate the communication between mitochondria and ER, contact points known as
  mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs) are established. Increased association
  between the ER and mitochondria and enhanced Ca2+ transfer have been observed in
  AD (B). In the mitochondria, the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein
  (VDAC) lets Ca2+ across the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and the mitochondrial
  Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) complex allows the influx of Ca2+ across the inner mitochondrial
  membrane (IMM). Ca2+ efflux is partially managed by the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCLX).
  Both Aβ and tau (phospho-tau, p-tau) have been found in mitochondria. Elevated mitochondrial
  Ca2+ levels and decreased NCLX activity have been observed in AD (C). In the lysosome,
  the P/Q type VGCCs in their membrane regulate Ca2+ efflux into the cytosol, while
  the V-ATPase and Ca2+/H+ exchanger are in charge of lysosomal Ca2+ refilling (D).
  Additionally, Aβ and tau accumulate extracellularly and intracellularly, respectively,
  and lead to loss of dendritic spine density and synaptic function.
