caption: NKTR-214 is a CD122-biased cytokine agonist conjugated with multiple releasable
  chains of PEG located at the interface of IL2 and IL2Rαβγ. The PEG chains slowly
  release at physiological pH, creating conjugated-IL2 species with fewer PEG chains
  and increased bioactivity. Sustained signaling through the heterodimeric IL2 receptor
  pathway (IL2Rβγ) preferentially activates and expands effector CD8 T and NK cells
  over Tregs.
