caption: 'As a matricellular protein, thrombospondin-4 (Thbs4) pentamers are synthesized
  in the ER lumen and then transported to the Golgi, where after they traverse the
  secretory pathway to fuse with the plasma membrane for secretion. Thbs4 can then
  reside within the extracellular matrix (ECM) or be actively endocytosed and returned
  to the intracellular compartment by a recycling receptor. In addition to its established
  extracellular functions, combined studies in the heart and skeletal muscle now reveal
  that while in the ER, Thbs4 can compete with BiP (GRP78) for binding to the ER-resident
  transcription factor ATF6α, thereby facilitating ATF6α translocation to the Golgi
  for processing and subsequent shuttling to the nucleus where it regulates expression
  of ER stress responsive genes that are also part of the unfolded protein response
  (UPR). ATF6α induction in cardiac and skeletal muscle, or by overexpression in Tg
  mice (lower panel) causes a dramatic expansion of the ER and post-ER vesicles, as
  well as increased vesicular trafficking to the membrane. The ability of Thbs4 to
  induce ATF6α processing and nuclear trafficking also causes this same ER expansion
  and augmentation of intracellular vesicular trafficking to the membrane. However,
  Thbs4 uniquely regulates trafficking of selected integrins and dystrophin-associated
  glycoprotein complexes (DGC) members to the sarcolemma, thereby enhancing the mechanical
  stability of the myofiber, such as observed in Thbs4 Tg muscle (middle panel).DOI:
