caption: 'Overview of the regulation of autophagy pathways and targets for modulating
  autophagy by drugs/compounds. Two major signaling pathways to regulate autophagy
  are depicted in this figure: mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways
  and mTOR-independent signaling pathways. Autophagy is modulated by mTOR in response
  to certain nutritional stimulations. Insulin or growth factors activate class I
  PI3K pathway, leading to activation of mTOR and inhibition of autophagy. Glucose
  starvation activates AMPK and inhibits mTOR, followed by activating of ULK1 complex
  and activating autophagy. mTOR can be pharmacologically inhibited by activating
  AMPK (e.g., metformin) or inhibiting class I PI3K (e.g., EGFR antagonist). Recent
  new drugs such as PI-103 can activate autophagy by inhibiting both class I PI3K
  and mTOR. In the mTOR-independent pathway, increase of intracellular cAMP level
  and Ca2+ inhibits autophagy. Intracellular level of cAMP is upregulated by adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) and the calpain-Gsα pathway, which is activated by intracellular Ca2+
  level. The inhibitory effect of cAMP on autophagy is mediated by increase of synthesis
  of inositol-(,,)-trisphosphate (IP3) and inositol. Increased level of IP3 activates
  IP3 receptor in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and release Ca2+ into cytosol, leading
  to inhibition of autophagy. Activation of L-type Ca2+ channel triggers Ca2+ influx
  and elevates intracellular Ca2+ level, which activates cysteine protease called
  calpain. In addition to elevating cAMP by the calpain-Gsα pathway, calpain inhibits
  autophagy by cleavage of Atg5. However, the concise mechanism by which cytosolic
  cAMP, Ca2+, inositol, and IP3 regulate autophagy is still unclear. In this cyclical
  mTOR-independent pathway, autophagy can be modulated by mainly targeting intracellular
  levels of cAMP or Ca2+. L-type Ca2+ receptor blockers such as verapamil inhibit
  Ca2+ influx, which leads inhibition of calpain activity and cAMP synthesis. Activation
  of autophagy by drugs such as lithium or carbamazepine is mediated by at least reduction
  of Ca2+ release by IP3 receptor (IP3R). EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
