caption: Example of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors blocking cytokine signalling. Many
  cytokines exert their biological effects via the JAK–signal transducer and activator
  of transcription (STAT) pathway. As JAK inhibitors block JAK enzymes from initiating
  this signal transduction cascade, they also interfere with cytokine signalling.
  A variety of JAK inhibitors currently being evaluated in clinical trials interfere
  with more than one JAK. However, selective JAK inhibitors are also being developed.
