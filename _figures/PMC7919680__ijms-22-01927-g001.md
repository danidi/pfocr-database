caption: The 5-HT1A-FGFR1 heteroreceptor complexes (to the left) and the 5-HT1A-5-HT2A
  isoreceptor (to the right) heteroreceptor complexes are illustrated. The term isoreceptor
  is used for the 5-HT1A-5-HT2A heteromer since the two types of 5-HT receptors are
  activated by the same transmitter (5-HT). They are in the plasma membrane of control
  rats (healthy). They are shown to be in balance with the corresponding homoreceptor
  complexes in the plasma membrane. The FGFR1 homoreceptor complex is presented as
  a dimer and this is also true also for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A homoreceptor complexes.
  The FGFR1 homoreceptor and the FGFR1 protomer in the heteroreceptor couple are all
  coupled to ERK1/2, a major signaling pathway for plasticity, via growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2 (adaptor protein) and RAS protein. With a curved arrow and plus sign close
  to it, the allosteric enhancement by the 5-HT1A protomer of the FGFR1 protomer signaling
  over the GRB2-RAS-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is illustrated. The 5-HT1A receptor protomer
  is presented as a dimer. As a result, the FGFR1 activation by an FGFR1 agonist is
  increased, leading to enhanced neuroplasticity involving the ERC1/2 pathway [].
  The 5-HT1A protomer in the heteroreceptor complex mainly signals via Gi/o to inhibit
  AC activity, like the 5-HT1A homoreceptor, as indicated. The other 5-HT1A-FGFR1
  heteromer instead is used to illustrate how the FGFR1 protomer linked to GRB2 upon
  activation can reduce the coupling of the 5-HT1A protomer to the GIRK channel via
  an inhibitory allosteric interaction in the heterocomplex. The detailed molecular
  mechanism is unknown, but the result is an allosteric brake of the 5-HT1AR-induced
  opening of the GIRK channels. In the dorsal raphe, it leads to an inability of the
  5-HT1A auto-receptor to hyperpolarize the dorsal raphe neurons and an increased
  firing of the dorsal raphe serotonin neurons can develop, leading to antidepressant
  actions. In the right part of the figure, the 5-HT1A-5-HT2A heteromer is shown as
  a heterodimer. It is illustrated that the 5-HT2A protomer via an inhibitory allosteric
  receptor–receptor interaction can reduce its signaling over the Gi/o-AC-PKA pathway.
  This leads to a dominance of 5-HT2A signaling with depressive effects []. The figure
  especially illustrates how allosteric inhibitory or facilitatory allosteric receptor–receptor
  interactions among the receptor protomer of the complex can produce antidepressant
  or depressive events which can help determine if antidepressant or depressive effects
  develop.
