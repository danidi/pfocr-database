caption: 'Overview of peroxisome biogenesis: converging de novo and growth and division
  models. PMPs are translated in the cytosol on free ribosomes and are incorporated
  into the ER membrane through specific translocons (Sec61 or Get3) (van der Zand
  et al., ; Borgese and Fasana, ). It is assumed that the PMPs are segregated and
  sorted (presumably, through an intramolecular signal) into at least two different
  pre-peroxisomal compartments (pER) in the ER (Fakieh et al., ). These PMPs leave
  the ER through vesicular carriers that bud in a Pex19 dependent manner (upper inset)
  (Lam et al., ; Agrawal et al., ). These vesicles undergo heterotypic fusion to unite
  the components of the importomer to form import competent peroxisomes (van der Zand
  et al., ), a process that requires the Pex1 and Pex6 proteins (Titorenko et al.,
  ). It is expected that Type II PMPs are incorporated at this stage since they are
  essential for the import of matrix proteins (Koller et al., ). Here Pex19 might
  act as an mPTS receptor that binds and stabilizes the Type II PMPs in the cytosol
  and incorporates them into the peroxisomal membrane upon docking to the membrane
  bound Pex3 (Schmidt et al., ) (lower inset). Upon subsequent import of matrix proteins,
  peroxisomes grow in size and undergo division to replenish cells with an adequate
  number of peroxisomes to meet metabolic requirements of the cells. This pathway
  could be the most plausible way by which peroxisomes are repopulated in cells lacking
  peroxisomes (such as pex3Δ/ pex19Δ) when the missing gene is reintroduced (Hoepfner
  et al., ; van der Zand et al., ; Agrawal et al., ). However, in WT cells as well,
  ER might supply PMPs to replenish and maintain the actively dividing peroxisomes
  (Motley and Hettema, ). An active interaction between the two pathways would enable
  cells to adapt dynamically to changing environments.'
