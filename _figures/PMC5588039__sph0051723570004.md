caption: 'A model for the regulation of biofilm formation in Paracoccus denitrificans
  based on the work described in this paper. Abbreviations: H-NOX, heme NO and oxygen
  binding; REC, receiver domain; HK, histidine kinase. GGDEF and EAL are sequence
  motifs associated with the diguanylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase, respectively.
  Enzymes and enzyme-catalyzed reactions are shown in black, signaling interactions
  in blue and gray (the latter indicating pathways that are likely to be indirect).
  We suggest that Hmp is the dominant pathway for NO metabolism in the static cultures
  used for biofilm assays.'
