caption: Neuroimmune interactions of kynurenine intermediates. Metabolism of tryptophan
  via the kynurenine pathway leads to several neuroactive intermediates; kynurenic
  acid (synthesised by kynurenine aminotransferase, KAT) has neuroprotective properties
  through antagonism at the N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA) receptor. Quinolinic acid (QUIN),
  in contrast, is an NMDA receptor agonist. Both 3-hydroxykynurenine (3OH-kynurenine)and
  QUIN can induce neurodegeneration and apoptosis through induction of excitotoxicity
  and generation of neurotoxic radicals, respectively. Activity of the key enzyme
  of the kynurenine pathway, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and of the 3-OH-kynurenine
  forming enzyme kynurenine monoxygenase (KMO) is induced by proinflammatory cytokines
  like interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-4
  (IL-4). Serotonin is normally degraded to 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), but
  the indole ring of serotonin can also be cleaved by IDO. (blue arrows = activation;
  red arrows = inhibition).
