caption: Results of ANOVA testing of all identified aliphatic glucosinolate QTLs for
  significant impact upon the accumulation of individual glucosinolate metabolites,
  transcript level of all biosynthetic genes, total aliphatic glucosinolate content,
  and the average expression of the aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway is
  presented graphically. The genes and metabolites are shown with respect to the currently
  theorized biosynthetic pathway. Trait abbreviations are as listed in . Gene names
  are as listed in , and TAIR locus identifiers are used for gene families where there
  is no settled naming system.Cells within boxes represent aliphatic glucosinolate
  QTLs. The legend at the bottom right contains the QTL name. Cells representing QTLs
  significantly controlling the represented trait are colored to show the directionality
  of the allele substitution effect; a positive effect of the Bay-0 allele is blue,
  and a positive effect of the Sha allele is red. Dark red and dark blue show that
  the allele substitution at the given QTL led to greater than 50% phenotypic change
  in the trait, while the lighter colors represent QTLs of smaller phenotypic effect.
  Significant epistasis between the GSL.Aliph.AOP, GSL.Aliph.Elong, and GSL.Aliph.V.66
  QTLs are shown by black cross-hatching within the respectively labeled cell. For
  example, but-3-enyl is controlled by QTL at GSL.AOP, GSL.Elong, and GSL.I.20 with
  epistasis between the GSL.AOP and GSL.Elong loci. QTLs for gene expression are shown
  in smaller font with a smaller ANOVA box, while QTLs for metabolites are shown in
  bold larger font with a larger box.(A) QTLs for the whole pathway broken down into
  individual metabolites and transcripts.(B) QTLs for total aliphatic glucosinolate
  content and the mean z-score for the biosynthetic pathway.
