caption: Tblastx comparison of the C-P lyase complex. An E-value cutoff of 1e-10 was
  used and visualization was done with the program Easyfig []. Functional genes of
  the C-P lyase complex were marked in green, accessory genes in orange, the ABC-type
  transporter in blue and the regulatory subunit in red. Genes not directly associated
  with this pathway are marked in grey
