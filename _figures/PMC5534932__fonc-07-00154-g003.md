caption: VDAC1 function in cell death. Different models proposed for the release of
  apoptogenic proteins, such as Cyto c (gold balls) and apoptosis-inducing factor
  (AIF), from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space to the cytosol, leading to apoptosis.
  These models include (a) VDAC1 closure and outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) rupture
  serving as the Cyto c release pathway—prolonged VDAC1 closure leads to mitochondrial
  matrix swelling and OMM rupture, resulting in the appearance of a non-specific release
  pathway for apoptogenic proteins; (b) a permeability transition pore (PTP) provides
  the apoptogenic protein release pathway—a large conductance pore-forming complex,
  the PTP, composed of VDAC1 in the OMM, adenine nucleotide translocase in the inner
  mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and cyclophilin D (CyD) in the matrix, allows apoptogenic
  protein release; (c) Bax activation, followed by its oligomerization, results in
  OMM permeabilization—upon apoptosis induction, Bax becomes associated with mitochondria
  as a large oligomer/complex forming a Cyto c-conducting channel in the OMM; (d)
  a pore is formed by oligomerized forms of Bax and Bak—Bax/Bak oligomerization, supposedly
  activated by BH3-only proteins (e.g., Bid), results in OMM permeabilization and
  Cyto c release; (e) a Bax- and VDAC1-based hetro-oligomer mediates Cyto c release—the
  interaction of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax/Bak) with VDAC1 forms a cytochrome c
  (Cyto c) release pathway; (f) mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing channel (MAC) as
  the release pathway—MAC offers a high-conductance channel and a putative Cyto c
  release channel; (g) oligomeric VDAC1 as a channel for the release of apoptotic
  proteins—a protein-conducting channel is formed within a VDAC1 homo-oligomer, allowing
  Cyto c release and apoptotic cell death; (h) mitochondrial Ca2+ overload induces
  apoptosis—following Ca2+ overload in the matrix, Ca2+ transport mediated by VDAC1
  across the OMM and by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) in the IMM leads to
  dissipation of the membrane potential, mitochondria swelling, PTP opening, Cyto
  c release, and apoptotic cell death. PTP opening is also accompanied by an efflux
  of the accumulated Ca2+ into the cytosol.
