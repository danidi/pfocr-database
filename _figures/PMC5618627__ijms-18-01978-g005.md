caption: Mechanisms of HSP60 mediated cytoprotection. HSP60 regulates apoptosis via
  two mechanisms–modulation of mitochondrial survivin (SVV) stability and control
  of p53 expression. HSP60 is an SVV associated protein as it complexes with survivin
  in the mitochondria to stabilize SVV. Moreover, HSP60 also forms a complex with
  p53, which decreases the stability of p53, thus inhibiting the pro-apoptotic functions
  of p53 in cancer cells. Silencing of HSP60 leads to loss of chaperonage function
  leading to the loss of SVV which results in activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic
  pathway. In addition, HSP60 silencing leads to enhanced stabilization of p53 proteins
  leading to p53-dependent transcription of apoptotic factors like BAX that ultimately
  promote cell death (based on Ghosh et al., []).
