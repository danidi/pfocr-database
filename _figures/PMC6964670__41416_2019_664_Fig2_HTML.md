caption: Analysing IDO1 inhibitors clinical trial results. a Intra-tumoural penetrance
  of IDO1 inhibitors (IDO1i) could be hindered due to diminished blood supply to tumours
  or elevated oncotic pressure in solid tumours (left). Even if IDO1i are able to
  access tumours, ABC transporters can interfere with their intracellular penetrance
  (middle). Cellular uptake of IDO1i can lead to AHR activation in various cell types
  and therefore contribute to cancer progression (right). b Combination of IDOi with
  other types of therapies can lead to the upregulation of IDO1 expression through
  various mechanisms (see text). In addition, clinical trials have included patients
  pre-treated with BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi), which were shown to promote an enrichment
  of a population of cells with constitutive AHR activity. This might further lead
  to the induction of IDO1 expression and contribute  to  cancer progression. c Even
  if IDO1 inhibition is effectively achieved, IDO2 and TDO2 might compensate for IDO1
  blockade. BRAFi and IDO1i can promote AHR activation in various cells present in
  the tumour microenvironment, which unleashes the intrinsic cancer promoting effects
  driven by the AHR. Moreover, AHR activation leads to the upregulation of IDO2 and
  TDO2, which can further activate the AHR and deplete Trp. IDO1i and immune check
  point blockade (ICB) lead to an increase in cytotoxic TILs, which in turn secrete
  pro-inflammatory molecules, such as IFN-γ, which also induces IDO2. In addition,
  the pro-inflammatory microenvironment driven by IDO1i and ICB therapy can also lead
  to the upregulation of TDO2, via the COX2–PGE2–EP4 pathway. d In order to obtain
  a more robust view of the effects of IDO1 inhibition and improve the outcome of
  its use in clinical trials, we suggest stratifying patients based on the concentration
  of Trp, Kyn and Kyn-derived metabolites in plasma and tumours, as well as on the
  expression of the TCE and AHR activity present in tumours. Once stratified, patients
  can be treated more accurately with one or more therapies targeting Trp catabolism.
