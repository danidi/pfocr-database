caption: Phosphoproteins down-regulated in PCP and PCPPPI compared to Sal and SalPPI,
  respectively, which were significantly enriched in LTP signaling pathway. The blue
  phosphoproteins were down-regulated in PCPPPI, the red phosphoproteins were down-regulated
  in PCP, and the green phosphoproteins were down-regulated in both PCP and PCPPPI
  rats. Uncolored proteins were not quantified in our study. The solid lines represent
  direct relationship have been reported and the dashed lines represent relationships
  inferred from the literature based on the relationships of proteins from the same
  family.
