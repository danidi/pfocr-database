caption: During cellular oxidative stress, especially vascular oxidative stress, a
  host of cellular pathways are activated that directly result in the enzymatic formation
  of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), (). The terms ROS/RNS are general terms
  used for the reactive species derived from oxygen or nitrogen atoms. As such, it
  is difficult to imagine a scenario where all of the species formed result in a unified
  physiological outcome. However, given their short half-lives, it is still challenging
  to decouple the specific action of individual ROS/RNS molecules in each pathway.
  In the case of PCB induced toxicity, uncoupling cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and
  activation of AhR is thought to play a major role of ROS generation, which in turn
  results in the excess production of free radicals, leading to chronic inflammation
  and disease [, ]. Another mechanism common to oxidative stress induction that has
  been identified in PCB toxicity is the formation of superoxide anions via the NADPH
  oxidase enzyme that results in the oxidation of NADPH to NADP+ []. Within the cytosol,
  this superoxide anion is subsequently converted to hydrogen peroxide in the presence
  of superoxide dismutase (SOD). In turn, hydrogen peroxide in the presence of transition
  metal ions (Cu, Fe) can form the highly reactive, hydroxyl radicals [].
