caption: Model of PAS mechanism of action in Mycobacterium. The normal folate pathway
  is depicted on the left. As a para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) analog, PAS is incorporated
  into the folate pathway by competing with pABA in the reaction catalyzed by DHPS,
  the product of which is further processed by DHFS to generate hydroxyl dihydrofolate
  (right). This antimetabolite in turn inhibits DHFR activity (denoted by the T bar)
  and thus blocks the folate pathway (denoted by the cross).
