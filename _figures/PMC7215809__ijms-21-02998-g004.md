caption: Diazaborine treatment allows tracing the ribosome biogenesis pathway from
  the nucleolar to the early cytoplasmic stage. While the steady state population
  of Nog1 in untreated cells (diazaborine t0) mainly contains 27SB pre-rRNA representing
  late nucleolar and early nucleoplasmic particles, treatment with diazaborine leads
  to a steady shift to a cytoplasmic population shortly after export. Since Nmd3 and
  Tif6 are the last two factors that leave the 60S-precursor before subunit joining,
  their cytoplasmic pool is significantly larger than the ones of Rlp24, Bud20 and
  Nog1, which dissociate shortly after export. As a consequence, significant amounts
  of Nmd3 and Tif6 can still be recycled shortly after drug application, while the
  recycling of Rlp24, Bud20 and Nog1 is blocked immediately (diazaborine t < 5 min).
  This fact allows tracking the particles that already contained Nog1 at the time
  of diazaborine application over time. The small nucleolar peak of Nog1 originates
  from de novo synthesis and import of Nog1, which is not affected by diazaborine
  and becomes detectable after about 15 minutes of drug treatment (diazaborine t >>5
  min) [].
