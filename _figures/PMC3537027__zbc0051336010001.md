caption: The anaerobic ring contraction step in relation to the structure of adenosylcobalamin.
  The ring contraction step is mediated by CbiH60 in B. megaterium. The pathway is
  thought to involve either the transformation of cobalt-precorrin-3 into cobalt-precorrin-4
  or the oxidized versions of these intermediates (cobalt factor III and cobalt factor
  IV). The numbering system used for the corrin ring is shown with adenosylcobalamin.
