caption: A. The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) activates signaling pathways
  that mediate, gene expression, protein and lipid synthesis, growth of cellular biomass
  and survival after cytotoxic therapy []. EGFR transduces signals through the well-described
  kinase pathways initiated by Ras, including the Raf/Mek/Erk and Phosphatidyl-inositol
  3-kinase (PI3k)/Akt/mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR). Akt activates mTOR through,
  i) phosphorylation and inhibition of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2), which
  inactivates the mTOR activating GTP-binding protein Rheb and/or ii) phosphorylation
  of PRAS40 a member of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) (one of the two functional complexes
  of mTOR that includes mLST8/Gbl and the scaffold protein Raptor []). mTORC1 promotes
  Cap-dependent gene expression and translation through phosphorylation-mediated activation
  of p70S6-kinase (p70s6k) and phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of translation
  initiation inhibitor eIF4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1) [, ]. The PI3k-mTOR pathway
  stimulates glucose uptake and de novo lipogenesis (DNL). Regulation of the latter
  is mediated at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational level.
  PI3k-Akt facilitate cleavage of Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBP)
  1a, c and 2 [] which, translocate to nucleus to stimulate expression of lipogenic
  enzymes mediating both fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. Transcription of ACLY,
  ACC1 and FASN is stimulated by the PI3k-Akt pathway through SREBPs [, ]. SREBP1a
  and 1c regulate genes involved in FA metabolism while SREBP2 regulates cholesterol
  synthesis genes []. B. Metabolic stress activates a metabolic stress response signals
  through mediators, such as Liver Kinase B 1 (LKB1), which phosphorylates and activates
  AMP-activated kinase (AMPK). AMPK suppresses mTOR activation through dual action
  to phosphorylate and enhance the activity of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 and 2
  (an inhibitor of mTOR) and through inhibitory phosphorylation of mTORC1 protein
  Raptor. Further, it suppresses lipogenic gene transcription through inhibitory SREBP
  phosphorylation that prevents cleavage and nuclear translocation to induce transcription.
  Genotoxic Stress induced by ionizing radiation activates the DNA Damage Response
  (DDR). Chromosomal damage is recognized by MRE11 complex and ATM, a key mediator
  of DDR, which phosphorylates histone H2Ax (γH2Ax), a step leading to recruitment
  of molecular DNA repair complexes at the sites of strand breaks. ATM induces p53
  expression and phosphorylation and expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor
  p21cip1, which facilitates the G1-S and G2-M checkpoints. Further, p53 blocks lipogenic
  gene expression at the transcriptional level. In lung cancer cells ATM induction
  of p53-p21cip1 appears to be mediated through AMPK []. Genotoxic stress, such as
  radiation, induces in lung cancer cells and tumors sustained activation of the ATM-AMPK-p53-p21cip1
  and suppression of the Akt-mTOR pathways [, , ].
