caption: Potential contributors to the electrophysiology of the signaling endosome.
  It remains to be determined whether the V-ATPase and Nox enzymes operate in the
  same or different populations of vesicles. If they are present in the same compartment,
  the balance between superoxide production by Nox and proton accumulation by all
  potential mechanisms (V-ATPase, proton channels, Na+/H+ exchange, Cl−/H+ antiport)
  may determine both the pH and the redox state of the compartment. Control of the
  microenvironment of the signaling endosome may be critical to proper processing
  of endocytosed proteins and subsequent signal transduction. Rapid superoxide production
  associated with alkalinization of the vesicle lumen could allow significant accumulation
  of superoxide, which may then leave the endosome via an anion conductance. This
  mechanism may provide a controlled pathway for cytoplasmic ROS signaling by superoxide
  that is independent of H2O2 production.
