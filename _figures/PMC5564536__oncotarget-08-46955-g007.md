caption: A. The HMG box is necessary for nuclear import of SOX14A and SOX14B. The
  N-termini NLS mediate the nuclear translocation of SOX14A/B through a calmodulin-dependent
  pathway and C-termini NLS interacts with importin-β pathway to stimulate nuclear
  transport. Both E. sinensis SOX14A and SOX14B contains an imperfect hydrophobic
  NES, which is sensitive to the CRM1-specific inhibitor LMB. B. The classical pathways
  of the nucleocytoplasm transport of SOX9/10 are well established. The calmodulin
  and importin-β can facilitate the nuclear import of SOXE group protein SOX9 and
  SOX10. And the classical leucine-rich sequence of HMG box is necessary and sufficient
  to export the SOX9/10 protein out of the nucleus. In our study, we found that the
  N-termini NLS and the C-termini NLS of SOX14A/B mediates the nuclear import across
  the nuclear pore complex, this could be mediated by calmodulin and Importin-β. Strikingly,
  we found a new nonconventional nuclear export pathway which activates SOX14A and
  SOX14B transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through the CRM1-dependent pathway.
  We demonstrated that the leucine-rich NES sequence located in the HMG box is response
  to leptomycin B. This indicated that the NES signals that required for nuclear export
  are not only existed in the well-known SOX9/10. The other SOX proteins, such as
  SOX14A and SOX14B, also have the functional NES signals.
