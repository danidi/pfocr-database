caption: Regulation of dimorphism in C. albicans by multiple signaling pathways. The
  Cph1-mediated MAPK pathway and the Efg1-mediated cAMP pathway are well-characterized
  signaling pathways in dimorphic regulation. In C. albicans, Ras1 is an important
  regulator of hyphal development and likely functions upstream of both pathways.
  In the cAMP-PKA pathway, two catalytic subunits or isoforms of PKA, Tpk1 and Tpk2,
  have differential effects on hyphal morphogenesis under different hypha-inducing
  conditions. The MAPK cascade includes Cst20 (PAK), Hst7 (MAPKK), Cek1 (MAPK), and
  the downstream transcription factor Cph1, which is a homolog of the S. cerevisiae
  transcription factor Ste12. Transcription of the hyphal regulator TEC1 is regulated
  by Efg1 and Cph2. Rim101 or Czf1 may function through Efg1 or act in parallel with
  Efg1. Tup1 is the negative regulator of the hyphal transition. Tup1, recruited by
  Rfg1, Nrg1, or Mig1, and Rbf1 are also implicated in dimorphic transitions. GlcNAc-inducible
  hexokinase, Hxk1, plays a negative role in hyphal development under certain conditions.
  Cell wall proteins (HWP1 and ECE1, etc., which are involved in adherence) are also
  regulated by Efg1. Transcription factors are shown in rectangular boxes.
