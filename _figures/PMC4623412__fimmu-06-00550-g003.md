caption: Duplicitous signaling roles of IL-6. (A) Classical IL-6 signaling occurs
  via direct interaction of IL-6 with the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor, which has
  a limited cellular distribution, and the ubiquitously expressed gp130. gp130 lacks
  intrinsic kinase activity; IL-6 signals are transduced intracellularly via the recruitment
  and activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. (B) Cells lacking the IL-6 receptor are
  not receptive to IL-6 except (C) in the presence of the IL-6/soluble IL-6 receptor
  complex which interacts with gp130 expressing cells and this is defined as IL-6
  trans-signaling. (D) Inhibition of IL-6 trans-signaling can be achieved via the
  presence of excess soluble gp130Fc fusion protein.
