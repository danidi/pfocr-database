caption: In noninfected conditions, unstable nuclear ncRNAs are degraded by the NEXT‐RNA
  exosome pathway. Upon infection, loss of MTR4 and RRP6 ensues and decreases unstable
  nuclear ncRNA turnover, resulting in the subsequent upregulation of the immune response
  through transcriptional activation of downstream target genes.
