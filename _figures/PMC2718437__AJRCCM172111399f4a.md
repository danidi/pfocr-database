caption: Expression changes in genes of the fibrinolysis signaling pathway in lungs
  of mice exposed to nickel for 72 h as measured by oligonucleotide microarray and
  RT-PCR. (A) Changes in gene expression are expressed using the GenMAPP format. Genes
  that were increased at least 1.5-fold over control values and had a significance
  value of p ⩽ 0.05 are labeled in red. Those genes that were decreased at least 1.5-fold
  from control values and had a significance value of p ⩽ 0.05 are labeled in green.
  Those genes that did not meet the aforementioned criteria are labeled in gray, and
  those genes that were not on the array are labeled in white. (B) RT-PCR analysis
  of serine (or cysteine) proteinase inhibitor, clade E, member 1 (Serpine1) mRNA
  after 24, 48, or 72 h of exposure. Data are presented as fold changes over control
  values (n = 5 mice/group, means ± SEM) and are normalized to Rps2 expression. *
  Denotes significant difference from nonexposed control group, p < 0.05.
