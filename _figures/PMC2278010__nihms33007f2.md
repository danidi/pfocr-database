caption: 'Functions of AC6 that are not dependent on β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) stimulation
  and cAMP generation (Transgene Pathway) may underlay the beneficial effects of AC6
  gene transfer, offsetting the potentially deleterious effects associated with agents
  that provide excessive cAMP/PKA activation (Classical Pathway). AC6 gene transfer
  increases AC6 content in non-plasma membrane compartment (). Superscripts refer
  to published data: 1 (); 2 (); 3 (); 4 (); 5 (); 6 (); 7 (), 8 (Roth et al., 2000);
  9 (). Gas, stimulatory GTP-binding protein; AC6, adenylyl cyclase type 6; AC6 Unplugged,
  transgene AC6 not associated with plasma membrane and βAR/Gas interaction; cAMP,
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A; ATF-3, activating transcription
  factor-3; PLB, phospholamban; AC6:Phosphatase, postulated AC6:phosphatase interaction
  which may increase Akt and PLB phosphorylation in the basal (unstimulated) state'
