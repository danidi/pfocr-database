caption: The LRP1 receptor is expressed on tumor cells and on macrophages and we propose
  that serpinE2 targeting with Ab11 impacts on LRP1 signaling in both cell types.
  (A) In metastatic tumors, serpinE2-LRP1 binding stimulates ERK signaling and secretion
  of CCL2. Tumor cells display hyperactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs);
  FGFRs, which are active in the 4T1 model, also stimulate ERK pathway activation.
  We speculate that in macrophages, the combination of high CCL2 levels and serpinE2-activated
  LRP1 promotes the M2 phenotype. Indeed, there are high levels of phagocytic, Texas-red
  positive M2 tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in the metastatic tumors; they are
  known to be responsible for degrading the matrix during tumor development. (B) Ab11
  or sepinE2 KD (not drawn in model) lowers ERK pathway activity and the secretion
  of CCL2, and stimulates TIMP1 secretion. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) block
  RTK signaling. The matrix-degrading M2 TAMs are decreased in Ab11-treated tumors.
  Moreover, depleting macrophages with clodronate liposomes results in deposition
  of a dense collagen matrix, similar to that observed in Ab11-treated tumors. Thus,
  we propose that the drop in CCL2, which contributes to a decrease in M2 TAMs, as
  well as blocking serpinE2, which skews the TAMs towards the M1 phenotype, causes
  the emergence of a dense collagen matrix that inhibits intravasation and metastatic
  dissemination.
