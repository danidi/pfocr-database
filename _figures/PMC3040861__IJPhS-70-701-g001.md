caption: Role of lovastatin in inhibition of cholesterol synthesis The cellular and
  molecular mechanism of statins by considering the biosynthetic pathway of cholesterol.
  The main step leading to the reduction in cholesterol synthesis is the decrease
  in the precursor mevalonate by the inhibition of the HMG-CoA reductase. By inhibiting
  the HMG-CoA to mevalonate, the biosynthesis of two major downstream products of
  mevalonate, cholesterol production and synthesis of isoprenoids are influenced.
