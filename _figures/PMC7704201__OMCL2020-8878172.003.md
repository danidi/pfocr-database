caption: 'The Nrf2/Keap1/ARE pathway in T2DM. (a) Under diabetic conditions, the Nrf2
  transcription factor is covalently bonded to cysteine residues on its native repressor
  Keap1 in the cytoplasm, which results in the (1) constitutive ubiquitination and
  degradation of Nrf2 in the proteasome and (2) inhibition of the antioxidant response.
  (b) During a stressful condition of electrophilic or oxidative stress, cysteine
  residues on Keap1 are modified, resulting in the stabilization and translocation
  of Nrf2 into the nucleus where it can bind to the promoter region of ARE and initiate
  the transcription of various cytoprotective enzymes which can promote cellular survival
  through a variety of mechanisms including the upregulation of antioxidant function,
  inflammatory inhibition, and the transport of toxic metabolites. These cellular
  adaptations have been shown to improve a wide array of tissue damage underlying
  the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes. There are three major mechanisms of
  Nrf2 induction by small molecule activators: (1) upstream kinases such as AKT and
  ERK, which phosphorylate Nrf2 at specific sites, favoring its release by Keap1 and
  nuclear translocation; (2) modification of Keap1 cysteine residues, which disrupts
  the Nrf2-Keap1 complex, favoring dissociation of Nrf2 and subsequent nuclear translocation;
  (3) inhibition of Nrf2 ubiquitination by Keap1 and degradation by the proteasome
  augments Nrf2 availability, thus favoring nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Ub: ubiquitination;
  P: phosphorylation.'
