caption: Tumor proliferation, apoptosis/anoikis evasion, and EMT are functional contributing
  process to tumor recurrence, invasion, and metastasis. Genes including CCND1, SPP1,
  SOX4, and Myb promote tumor proliferation and survival, with Myb also demonstrating
  a role in enhancing survival in the context of ADT-resistance. SMAD4 and PTEN are
  known tumor suppressors, and decreased expression of these genes is known to increase
  prostate cancer growth and invasion. Resistance to anoikis-related cell death is
  crucial for tumor survival in the circulation during metastasis. Overactivation
  of the eHsp90-EZH2 pathway and overexpression of LGALS8 have been shown to promote
  tumor cell survival and invasion. WT1 and TFF1 promote EMT by decreasing E-cadherin
  expression via direct transcriptional modulation, and eHsp90 upregulates expression
  of EZH2, which decreases E-cadherin expression by direct interaction with the E-cadherin
  promoter to enhance prostate cancer invasion. miR-22 and miR-23b have tumor suppressor
  roles and their loss is associated with decreased E-cadherin expression. Consequential
  to E-cadherin loss, β-catenin is released from the plasma membrane and canonical
  Wnt signaling is activated, leading to acquisition of invasive properties. Myb is
  associated with promotion of filopodia formation, and tetraspanins such as TSPAN1
  and CD151 are also associated with increased expression of classical EMT machinery,
  promoting cellular motility and dissolution of cell polarity. VEGFA is a direct
  target of HIF-1α and is transcriptionally regulated by AR, and the HIF-1α/p300 pathway
  and AR-signaling promotes VEGFA production. In the context of ADT-resistance, the
  CREB/EZH2 axis promotes vascularization by allowing tumor cells to bypass androgen
  dependent angiogenesis. miR-30d and let-7d are pro-angiogenic and associated with
  increased tumor vascularity, while miR-137, miR-212, and miR-218 have inhibitory
  roles in angiogenesis and are frequently downregulated in prostate cancer. Finally,
  transdifferentiation and acquisition of a NE phenotype is a critical means of achieving
  ADT-resistance. ASCL1 and hASH1 are cell fate regulators that respond to decreased
  androgen signaling by downstream formation of NE characteristics. CSCs exhibit resistance
  to chemotherapy, and CD133+ cells demonstrating DTX-resistance often have increased
  CD44, Oct4, SOX9, and Nanog expression. Expression of renewal and stemness genes
  such as Nanog and Myc are also induced by PTOV1 during CSC formation.
