caption: Biosynthesis of Isoprenoid building blocks. The three pathways leading to
  the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP – MEP/DOXP pathway, Mevalonate and the alternate
  mevalonate pathway (in red), which is prevalent in archaea are shown. Mevalonate
  and the alternate mevalonate pathways share four of their seven enzymatic steps.
