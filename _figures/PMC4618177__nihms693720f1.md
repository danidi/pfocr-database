caption: '(a) Schematic of homology motifs in Auxin Response Factor (ARF) and Aux/IAA
  proteins. The ARF DNA binding domain (DBD), middle region (MR), and III/IV interaction
  motif are indicated. The Aux/IAA sequence motifs I (TOPLESS interaction), II (degron),
  and III/IV (interaction motif) are shown. (b) The top panel depicts the auxin response
  model from the year 2005. Under low local auxin concentrations, Aux/IAA proteins
  interact with ARF proteins, thereby repressing their action. In the presence of
  auxin , TIR1/AFB perceives auxin, allowing for SCFTIR1/AFB interaction with Aux/IAA
  proteins. Subsequently, Aux/IAA repressors are degraded via the 26S proteasome to
  allow for ARF-mediated gene expression changes. The bottom panel integrates structural
  biology contributions to our understanding of auxin signaling, including the ‘molecular
  glue’ interaction of auxin with TIR1 that allows for interaction of SCFTIR1/AFB
  with Aux/IAA repressors (PDB: 2P1Q; []); the ARF5 DBD structure (PDB: 4LDU; [])
  providing the ‘molecular calipers’ model of AuxRE recognition (PDB: 4LDX; []), and
  the possibility of PB1 domain multimerization in ARF (PDB: 4NJ6; []) and Aux/IAA
  (PDB: 2MUK; []) proteins to regulate auxin signaling. The cryo-EM proteasome structure
  is also shown for reference ([]; PDB: 4CR2).'
