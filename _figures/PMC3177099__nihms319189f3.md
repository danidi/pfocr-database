caption: Once significantly altered metabolites are identified, they can be placed
  on one of several available biochemical pathway diagrams such as, in this case,
  nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. In this manner, other metabolites within
  these pathways can targeted for further testing, and, should they be available,
  inhibitors of the pathway can be considered for clinical trials in the disease of
  interest. (reproduced from Urine Metabolomic Analysis Identifies Potential Biomarkers
  and Pathogenic Pathways in Kidney Cancer. Kim K, Taylor SL, Ganti S, Guo L, Osier
