caption: 'Seventeen genes are known to be involved in the “gemcitabine metabolism
  pathway”. These include two different types of nucleoside transporters, human equilibrative
  nucleoside transporters (hENT) and human concentrative nucleoside transporters (hCNT).
  Gemcitabine has been shown to be a substrate for two hENT family members (SLC29A1
  and 29A2) and three hCNT family members (SLC28A1, A2 and A3) [, ]. Once gemcitabine
  is inside the cell, it is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) to form a
  monophosphorylated metabolite, difluorodeoxycytidine monophosphate (gemcitabineMP)
  []. This metabolite is subsequently phosphorylated by nucleoside monophosphate (CMPK)
  and nucleoside diphosphate kinase to generate active forms of the drug, difluorodeoxycytidine
  diphosphate (gemcitabineDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (gemcitabineTP)
  []. These phosphorylated gemcitabine metabolites can be dephosphorylated by 5′-nucleotidase
  (5′-NT) family members [], including 5 known 5′-nucleotidases: NT5C, NT5C1A, NT5C1B,
  NT5C2 and NT5C3. Gemcitabine is inactivated by deamination catalyzed by cytidine
  deaminase (CDA) and deoxycytidylate deaminase (DCTD) []. GemcitabineDP can inhibit
  ribonucleotide reductase (RRM1, RRM2 and RRM2B) enzymes that catalyze reactions
  which generate deoxynucleoside triphosphates required for DNA synthesis [].'
