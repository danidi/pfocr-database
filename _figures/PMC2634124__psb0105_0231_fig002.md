caption: 'Update schematic diagram of the ET signaling pathway. ET is perceived by
  a family of receptors which are bound to ER membrane. The possibility exists that
  these EtRs constitute a cluster and act cooperatively and are regulated by RTE,
  a regulator of ETR1 function and negative regulator of ET signaling. Downstream
  EtR is: (A) CTR1 (MAPKKK) which is proposed to be activated by mean a physical interaction
  with EtR (+air) and inhibited (+ET), (B) MAPK module, and (C) several positive regulators
  of ET signaling (EIN2, EIN5, EIN6 and the transcription factors EIN3/EIL)., In absence
  of ET, EIN3 levels are reduced by proteasome-mediated degradation(Ub/26S) involving
  EBF1/EBF2 (E3 complex); whereas the presence of ET prevent EIN3 degradation.,, All
  components of this pathway (EtR → → → EIN3/EIL) exclusively respond to ET. EREBP,
  ET response element binding protein; PERE, primary ET response element; T F, transcription
  factor.'
