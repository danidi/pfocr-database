caption: 'Mass isotopomer labeling measurements of intracellular metabolites (red
  bars, after 8.0 h in growth phase I; green bars, after 14.25 h in growth phase II)
  arranged by pathways: fractional abundance over mass in context of the metabolic
  network. Error bars indicate standard deviations derived from two technical replicates
  (phase I) and two independent biological replicates with two technical replicates
  each (phase II). For abbreviations of flux and metabolite names used in the model,
  see Table S3.2 and S3.3 in the supplemental material. A switch from predominantly
  fully labeled mass isotopomers in the EMP and the PPP intermediates to almost naturally
  labeled TCA cycle intermediates is evident. Analysis of unphosphorylated glucose
  in the cytoplasm was rendered unfeasible by the large excess of extracellular glucose.
  Therefore, the labeling pattern of intracellular glucose is not included in the
  analysis. STD, standard deviation.'
