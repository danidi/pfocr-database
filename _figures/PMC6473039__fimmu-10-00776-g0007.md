caption: Model of BmPGRP2 functional differentiation in host immune response to pathogens.
  The two isoforms of BmPGRP2 were generated from different transcription initiation
  sites (TIS). BmPGRP2-1 recognizes and binds to DAP-type PGN through the extracellular
  PGRP domain and activates the Imd pathway and AMP to inhibit bacteria; BmPGRP2-2
  is induced by BmNPV to suppress PTEN, thereby relieving its inhibition of PI3K/Akt
  signaling and triggering an increase in Akt phosphorylation and activation to inhibit
  cell apoptosis. The increased cell survival is beneficial for viral replication.
  (Part of the evidence for protein levels is lacking).
