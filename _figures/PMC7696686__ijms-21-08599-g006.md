caption: 'Schematic illustration of the current working hypothesis. The gene expression
  pattern (I) showed that PD-MSCs improve trophoblast invasion via various gene expression.
  (1) PD-MSCs trigger trophoblast invasion via upregulating HIF1α and activating MMPs
  and the Rho family signaling pathway. The mitochondrial function (II) indicated
  that PD-MSCs regulate dynamic mitochondrial function including ATP synthesis, calcium
  transfer and mitophagy in invaded trophoblast cells. (2) PD-MSCs regulate the mitochondrial
  function of invasive trophoblasts. Particularly, the mRNA expression of both MCU
  and IP3R, transporters that move calcium ions though the mitochondria and ER, is
  upregulated in invasive trophoblasts. Additionally, PD-MSCs increase the mRNA expression
  of ABCB10, which is involved in ATP production, in invasive trophoblasts. (3) PD-MSCs
  regulate mitochondrial fragmentation via maintaining the balance between fission
  and fusion in trophoblasts. (4) PD-MSCs trigger mitochondrial autophagy in trophoblasts
  via upregulating PINK1 and PARKIN expression. Finally, PD-MSCs promote trophoblast
  invasion via regulating mitochondrial dynamics, including ATP production and mitochondrial
  autophagy. PD-MSCs: Placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells; HIF-1a: Hypoxia inducible
  factor 1 alpha; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase; ATP: Adenosine triphosphate; mRNA:
  messenger RNA; MCU: Mitochondrial calcium uniporter; IP3R: Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate;
  ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; ABCB10: ATP binding cassette subfamily B 10; PINK1: PTEN-induced
  kinase 1; PARKIN: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase'
