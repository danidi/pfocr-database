caption: . Proposed model of the effects of mindin deficiency on cardiac hypertrophy
  and fibrosis. Mindin deficiency enhances the activation of AKT/GSK3β signalling
  induced by aortic banding or Ang II infusion, which exacerbates cardiac remodelling.
  First, the activated AKT/GSK3β signalling pathway promotes hypertrophic marker expression
  and subsequently results in cardiac hypertrophy. Second, the AKT/GSK3β signalling
  pathway enhances Smad signalling, increases expression of fibrotic markers and leads
  to collagen synthesis and fibrosis. Mindin deficiency enhances these AKT-dependent
  signalling pathways and exacerbates cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, which promotes
  the progression of cardiac remodelling and heart failure. Pharmacological inhibition
  of AKT/GSK3β signalling rescues both cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in Mindin−/−
  mice in response to hypertrophic stimuli.
