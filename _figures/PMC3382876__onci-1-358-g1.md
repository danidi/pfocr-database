caption: Figure 1. Role of molecular pathway inhibition in tumor host immune interactions.
  Tumor-host immune interactions within the microenvironment are critical for tumor
  development and sustained tumor growth. Complex crosstalks between various immune
  effector cells, antigen-presenting cells and tumor cells yield an integrated outcome
  toward either antitumor immune activation or tolerance. Oncogenic alterations within
  molecular pathways in tumor cells as well as therapeutic inhibition of these pathways
  in tumor cells, along with both on- and off-target effects of targeted drugs in
  immune cells, interfere with this network, affect functional tumor immune responses,
  and may be exploited for more effective therapies.
