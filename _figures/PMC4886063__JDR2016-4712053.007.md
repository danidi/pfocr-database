caption: P2-dependent activation of the IRK/PI3K/Akt pathway. IRK activates both MEK/MAPK
  and PI3K/Akt pathways. On one side, activated PI3K [, ] generates PtdIns(3,4, 5)P3,
  which interacts with the PH domain of Akt and recruits the inactive protein to the
  membrane, where it is phosphorylated at T308 by the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase, PDK1 []. On the other side, BVR interacts with MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 to enhance
  activation of ERKs []. Activation of ERK1/2 results in activation of transcription
  factors to stimulate expression of the insulin gene []. The peptide, P2 (KYCCSRK),
  binds to the receptor kinase domain, which results in activation of the multistep
  process leading to activation of MEK1/2 in the MAPK pathway. Specific sequence motifs
  in hBVR mediate its interactions with proteins in the signaling pathways, where
  it acts as a scaffold to bring kinases in contact with their substrates []. Akts
  phosphorylate GSK3α, β resulting in its inactivation; the inactive GSK3s in turn
  cannot phosphorylate and inactivate glycogen synthase, resulting in an activation
  of glucose uptake.
