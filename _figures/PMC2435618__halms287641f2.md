caption: Pathways involved in cell differentiation, homeostasis and apoptosis in the
  adult intestinal epithelium, β-catenin and TCF4 are expressed in the proliferative
  compartment, where are located the intestinal epithelial stem cells. The β-catenin/TCF4
  complex mediates WNT signaling pathway by transcriptional activation of target genes
  (C-MYC, BMP4, EphB2, EphB3; other genes are reviewed in www.stanford.edu/~rnusse/wntwindow.html).
  β-catenin/TCF4 pathway is important in maintaining the proliferative compartment
  of the adult intestinal epithelium. Two members of the hedgehog family are expressed
  in the adult intestinal epithelium. Shh is expressed in the base of the small intestinal
  crypt and could positively regulate precursor cell proliferation. Ihh is expressed
  in the differentiated colonic cells and could regulate the maturation of the enterocytes.
  LKB1, a Ser/Thr kinase, regulates specific p53-dependent apoptosis pathways in the
  intestinal epithelium. Its gradient expression pattern along the villus axis highly
  suggests a function of LKB1 in the natural apoptosis of the intestinal epithelial
  cells.
