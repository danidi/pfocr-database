caption: Inflammatory stimuli reach the BM, where they activate the NF-κB pathway
  in HSCs/hematopoietic progenitors and immature myeloid cells. NF-κB activation could
  be mediated by TLR4 or endothelial receptors if they are already expressed in myeloid
  cells. (1) Activation of the NF-κB pathway leads to simultaneous up-regulation of
  VEGFR-3 and its ligand VEGF-C. (2) Coexpression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 creates an
  autocrine loop leading to up-regulation of lymphatic-specific genes. Prolymphatic
  reprogramming generates M-LECPs, which coexpress monocytic (e.g., CD11b) and lymphatic-specific
  (e.g., Lyve-1 and PDPN) markers that are normally segregated to distinct cell lineages.
  (3) Under chronic inflammatory conditions or cancer, BM-generated M-LECPs are mobilized
  to peripheral blood. (4) Circulating M-LECPs are recruited to inflamed sites and
  tumors and either integrate into pre-existing lymphatic vessels (4a) or initiate
  de novo formation of new lymphatic vasculature (i.e., lympho-vasculogenesis; 4b).
  (5) M-LECP integration might be necessary to induce sprouting of existing vessels
  that otherwise might be resistant to undergo remodeling.
