caption: Biosynthetic pathway exploited for salidroside production in S. cerevisiae
  and C. glutamicum. The direct salidroside precursor tyrosol can be obtained from
  the aromatic amino acid l-Tyr by an Ehrlich pathway (shown in green), which is naturally
  present in S. cerevisiae and which was functionally introduced into C. glutamicum
  by expression of the heterologous genes aro10 and yqhD encoding 2-oxo acid decarboxylase
  and alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively. The conversion of l-Tyr to 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  was catalyzed by endogenous transaminases in both organisms. C. glutamicum was also
  engineered toward an increased supply of UDP-Glc required for the glycosylation
  of tyrosol catalyzed by UDP-Glc-dependent glycosyltransferases (shown in blue).
  To this end, genes coding for phosphoglucomutase and GalU were expressed for increasing
  the conversion of the glycolysis intermediate Glc-6-P to UDP-Glc. Pgm, phosphoglucomutase;
  TA, transaminase; ODC, 2-oxo acid decarboxylase; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase.
