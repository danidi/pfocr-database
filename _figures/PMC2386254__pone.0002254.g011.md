caption: 'Upon intoxication or irradiation, Net1 is dephosphorylated and induces activation
  of RhoA, leading to a RhoA dependent phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and its downstream
  effector protein MK2. This signalling pathway can be blocked at different levels
  by: i) iRNA knock down of endogenous Net1 levels or expression of the dominant negative
  Net1ΔDH; ii) C3-mediated RhoA inhibition or iRNA knock down of endogenous RhoA levels;
  iii) p38 specific inhibitors. In each case, the effect of this interference results
  in enhanced cell death in response to genotoxic agents.'
