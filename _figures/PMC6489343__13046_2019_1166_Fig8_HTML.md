caption: Schematic diagram of cisplatin resistant lung cancer cells promoted M2 polarization
  of tumor-associated macrophages via the Src/CD155/MIF functional pathway. Thus,
  kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib may be of potential for treating cisplatin-resistant
  lung cancer by targeting both tumor and the tumor microenvironment
