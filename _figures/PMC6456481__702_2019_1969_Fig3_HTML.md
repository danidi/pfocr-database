caption: Possible molecular mechanism by which alpha-synuclein monomers/oligomers/synuclein
  fibrils can modulate the A2AR homo-heteroreceptor complexes and their balance in
  the plasma membrane. In the left part it is proposed that monomeric alpha-synuclein
  transmembrane (TM) peptides can become linked to the A2AR homoreceptor complex and
  modulate the A2AR function. Under the modulation of the monomeric alpha-synuclein
  peptides the A2AR antagonist may favor the formation of non-propagating alpha-synuclein
  dimers (pathway highlighted in red). Instead the A2A receptor agonist induced A2AR
  activation (pathway highlighted in green) may in the alpha-synuclein-A2AR complex
  produce signals that favor the propagation of alpha-synuclein dimers/oligomers into
  small and large synuclein aggregates that accumulate in Lewy bodies.In the far left
  several mechanisms are illustrated that can produce posttranslational modifications
  of alpha-synuclein. It involves changes in phosphorylation, transglutaminase cross-linking
  and ubiquitination and may play a role in the transformation of alpha-synuclein
  into propagating alpha-synuclein dimers. Ring-like synuclein oligomers can also
  be formed, which enter the plasma membrane and there produce beta sheet structures
  that associate and produce pores through which calcium ions may pass. In the A2AR–mGluR5
  heteromer, shown as the coming together of two homodimers (A2AR homodimer in blue
  and mGluR5 homodimer in green), the signaling pathways are illustrated. Changes
  in the activity of protein kinases like PKA, PKC and calcium–calmodulin kinase II
  can have a role in the modulation of the synuclein aggregation process
