caption: Schematic view of glycerolipid biosynthesis pathways integrated with microarray
  data. To visualize the relative transcript levels between gpsAFR transgenic plants
  and the wild-type control, gene-expression data were mapped to the pathway diagrams
  compiled from the AraCyc data base and Refs.  and . Different lipid species are
  derived either from the ER pathway (sn-1/sn-2, C18:C18 or C16:C18) or from the chloroplast
  pathway (sn-1/sn-2, C18:C16). Dashed lines represent possible channeling between
  the ER and chloroplasts. Red diamonds represent induced genes, whereas green diamonds
  denote repressed genes based on the transcript level ratio. Ph-E, phosphorylethanolamine;
  Ph-C, phosphorylcholine; CDP-C, CDP-choline; oe, outer envelope; ie, inner envelope;
  FAS, fatty acid biosynthesis.
