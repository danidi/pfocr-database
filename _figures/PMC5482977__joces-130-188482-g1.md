caption: Enzymes of the ubiquitylation cascade. The ubiquitylation reaction can be
  divided into three steps, each of which is catalyzed by a different class of enzyme.
  The first step is mediated by ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1) that use the energy
  from hydrolyzing ATP (to AMP and PPi) to form a covalent thioester linkage with
  the C-terminus of ubiquitin (Ub). Ubiquitin is then passed on to a cysteine residue
  within the Ub-conjugating enzyme (E2). In the final step, the E2 forms a complex
  with an E3 ubiquitin ligase that coordinates the final transfer of ubiquitin (or
  preformed ubiquitin chains) onto the substrate protein. A depiction of the detailed
  mechanisms of how ubiquitin is transferred from the E2 to substrate proteins by
  different types of E3s can be found in . The type of ubiquitylation determines the
  outcome for the substrate protein (). The attachment of a single ubiquitin molecule
  (mono-ubiquitylation) typically affects the trafficking behavior or activity of
  the protein (; ), while the formation of linear or branched chains of ubiquitin
  consisting of two or more molecules (polyubiquitylation) alters processes such as
  signal transduction (K63-linked ubiquitin chains) (; ), protein half-life (K48-linked
  or branched ubiquitin chains) () or NF-κB signaling and protein trafficking (mixed
  linkages) (). Effects of the most common types of ubiquitylation on the substrate
  protein are listed in the white box. Reversal of the ubiquitylation reaction is
  catalyzed by a class of proteases called DUBs that remove ubiquitin or ubiquitin
  chains from substrate proteins. Bacterial effector proteins that target the ubiquitylation
  pathway by functioning as E3 ligases or DUBs are shown in the blue and pink box,
  respectively, and are detailed in Table S1.
