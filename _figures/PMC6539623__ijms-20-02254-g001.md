caption: Outline of the glycolytic pathway and TCA cycle. The cell uses glucose transporter,
  GLUT1, to take up glucose, which is metabolized ultimately to pyruvate in the glycolytic
  pathway, producing 2 ATP molecules per one glucose molecule. In pluripotent stem
  cells (PSCs), a majority of glucose-derived pyruvate is converted to lactate and
  secreted out of the cell while some of pyruvate is transported into mitochondria
  and converted into acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). The pathways that are connected
  with the glycolytic pathway produce ribose, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH),
  and amino acids, which are required for rapidly proliferating cells such as PSCs
  and cancer cells. In mitochondria, acetyl-CoA is converted into citrate, which,
  in addition to oxidization in the TCA cycle, will be transported out of the mitochondria
  into the cytosol and converted back into acetyl-CoA. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is
  important for reactions such as lipid synthesis and histone acetylation. Key enzymes
  that are regulated in the glycolytic pathway are indicated in red. Arrows indicate
  the flow of metabolites, and the T bar indicated negative regulation of PDH by PDHK1.
