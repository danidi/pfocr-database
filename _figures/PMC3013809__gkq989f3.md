caption: Comparative representation of transcriptome and metabolome data between Arabidopsis
  and rice in the Universal Map mode. The species to be represented on the maps can
  be selected using the ‘Select Species’ button below the pathway diagram. The data
  for both species were randomly generated as examples, and the values are represented
  as colors. In the rectangles for the enzyme reactions, both of the genes from Arabidopsis
  (Ath) and rice (Osa) are represented. The metabolome data from Arabidopsis is represented
  in the upper part of the circles for the metabolites, and the data from rice is
  in the lower part. The detail of how the figure is produced on the KaPPA-View4 system
  is shown in Supplementary Data Section 4.
