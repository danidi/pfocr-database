caption: Vaccination induces humoral and cellular immune response in immunized individuals.
  In the normal condition, when the homologous virus enters an immunized body, it
  will be neutralized or cleared by vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies (Abs)
  or specific T cells, respectively. In the context of vaccine-associated disease
  enhancement, vaccines mainly induce non-neutralizing Abs or low titres of neutralizing
  Abs (suboptimal concentration) or type 2 T helper cell (TH2 cell)-biased T cell
  responses. When these vaccinated individuals are challenged by homotypic or heterotypic
  serotype viruses, the antibodies will immediately recognize the viruses and mediate
  antibody-dependent disease exacerbation in two ways. First, virus–antibody complexes
  might enter Fc receptor (FcR)-bearing cells, such as dendritic cells and monocytes,
  by FcR-mediated internalization, which is termed ‘antibody-dependent enhancement’
  (ADE). For viruses with innate tropism for FcR-bearing cells, such as dengue virus,
  ADE will result in higher viral loads than in conditions without antibodies. a |
  After entry, the virus, no matter whether it replicates or does not replicate, may
  activate a harmful immune response, resulting in the release of proinflammatory
  cytokines. b | Aside from ADE, antibody–antigen complexes can stimulate the complement
  pathway through activation of the C1q pathway, thus further strengthening the inflammatory
  responses c | Vaccine-associated disease enhancement can also involve a TH2 cell-biased
  immune response. The activated TH2 cells contribute to the activation of antibody
  production. However, they release interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-13 and IL-5, as well
  as eosinophil chemoattractant, thus resulting in eosinophil infiltration and proinflammatory
  cytokine production in the lung. d | Natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ cytotoxic
  T lymphocytes (CTLs) are poorly stimulated in TH2 cell-skewed immune responses.
  The exaggerated cytokine release (part b), activation of the complement pathway
  (part c) and the excessive mobilization of eosinophils all contribute to the infiltration
  of the lung by eosinophils, neutrophils and lymphocytes, and production of inflammatory
  cytokines (part d), leading to acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome.
