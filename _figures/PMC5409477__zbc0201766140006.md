caption: Proposed model of 2-AG action in stressed cardiomyocytes. Inflammation (induced
  by TNFα) and lipid oversupply (FFA) perturbs insulin sensitivity and restricts glucose
  uptake in cardiomyocytes in the long term, leading to DCM. The endocannabinoid 2-AG,
  via CB1R and CaMKKβ, activates the AMPK signaling pathway to inhibit inflammation,
  restore insulin sensitivity, and facilitate glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes, implying
  that 2-AG treatment can be a viable therapeutic approach to restore cardiometabolic
  homeostasis via energy balance in IR.
