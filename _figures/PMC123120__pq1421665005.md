caption: Scheme of the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of fiber type
  and fiber size by nerve activity in regenerating skeletal muscle. The scheme is
  based on the results of the present study and previous works on the role of Ras–mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) () and calcineurin () in regenerating rat soleus muscle between
  day 3 and day 10 after bupivacaine injury.
pmcid: PMC123120
papertitle: A protein kinase B-dependent and rapamycin-sensitive pathway controls
  skeletal muscle growth but not fiber type specification.
