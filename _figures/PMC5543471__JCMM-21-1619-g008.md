caption: The molecular mechanism of the mTOR pathway in Vil‐Cre;Pkd2 f3/f3 mice, with
  or without rapamycin treatment. Based on our study and other group finding, we deduced
  the molecular link between mTOR signalling changes and the polycystin‐2 dysfunction
  in cystogenesis. (A) The loss of PC2 impairs normal PC1 function, which may in turn
  disrupt PC1's inhibitory effect on the mTORC1 pathway by disturbing interactions
  between PC1 and the tuberous sclerosis 2 gene product (TSC2). Activated mTORC1 promotes
  the phosphorylation of 4E‐BP1 and eIF4E, which activates cyclin D1 gene expression.
  Cyclin D1 couples with CDK4/6 and phosphorylates retinoblastoma protein (RB), thereby
  releasing (E2F), which promotes the expression of the other cell‐cycle‐associated
  cyclins (A, B and E) and CDK1, eventually leading to increased cell proliferation.
  (B) Rapamycin treatment suppressed all of the mTORC1 downstream factors, including
  cyclins D1, A, B, E and CDK1, thereby arresting aberrant cell proliferation.
