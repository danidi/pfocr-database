caption: 'Proposed Pathway for Biosynthesis of Glycyrrhizin.The structures of possible
  biosynthetic intermediates between β-amyrin (1) and glycyrrhizin (8) are shown:
  (2), 11-oxo-β-amyrin; (3), 30-hydroxy-β-amyrin; (4a), 30-hydroxy-11-oxo-β-amyrin;
  (5), 11-deoxoglycyrrhetinic acid; (6), glycyrrhetaldehyde; and (7a), glycyrrhetinic
  acid. Solid black arrows indicate a dimerization reaction of two farnesyl diphosphate
  (FPP) molecules catalyzed by squalene synthase (SQS) originating squalene, oxidation
  by squalene epoxidase (SQE) to 2,3-oxidosqualene, or cyclization catalyzed by bAS.
  A dashed arrow between mevalonic acid and farnesyl diphosphate indicates multiple
  enzyme reactions. The blue arrow indicates a single oxidation reaction catalyzed
  by the CYP88D6 enzyme (); the red arrow indicates a single oxidation reaction catalyzed
  by the CYP72A154 enzyme, as described herein; the dotted arrows signify undefined
  oxidation and glycosylation steps. UGATs, UDP-glucuronosyl transferases.'
