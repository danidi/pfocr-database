caption: 'The regulatory mechanisms of linc-ROR in breast cancer. (a) Given that the
  binding sites between miR-145 and mRNAs of MUC1 and ARF6, linc-ROR promotes the
  EMT process in breast cancer by targeting miR-145; (b) linc-ROR overexpression activates
  TGF-β signaling pathway via upregulating the expression level of TGF-β, which triggers
  α-SMA and Smad2 expression, and thereby promotes the proliferation and invasion
  of breast cancer cells. (c) by facilitating the degradation of DUSP7, an inhibitor
  of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, linc-ROR activates ERK and promotes the tamoxifen
  resistance and tumor growth of breast cancer. (d) linc-ROR down-regulates the sensitivity
  of tamoxifen in breast cancer cells by binding to the 3ʹUTR of miR-34a. (e) linc-ROR
  promotes EMT and tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer via acting as a molecular
  sponge of miR-205 and increasing the expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2.Abbreviations:
  MUC1, Mucin1; ARF6, ADP-ribosylation factor 6; EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition;
  DUSP7, dual specificity phosphatase 7; MAPK/ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
  regulated protein kinases; ZEB1, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1.'
