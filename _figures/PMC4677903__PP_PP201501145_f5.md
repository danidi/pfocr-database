caption: SlMIXTA-like is required for cutin biosynthesis and deposition of the cuticle.
  A generic cutin biosynthetic pathway using the most abundant C16 fatty acid moiety
  as a substrate. Transcriptomic analysis pertaining to the pathway is displayed in
  the form of graphs indicating relative gene expression. Values are means of three
  independently transformed lines ± se (n = 3). For specific fold change values, see
  . Relative changes to major cutin monomers are also shown (green arrows; n = 3).
  FA, Fatty acid.
