caption: 'Resulting endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response
  (UPR) gene network from a modelling approach using the set of differentially regulated
  genes common to all pancreatic cancer cell lines after nemorosone treatment. The
  genes showing strongest regulation (DDIT3, ATF3, CDKN1A, AREG, ASNS, VEGFA) were
  used as starting points for expanding the gene regulatory network in Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis software using a knowledge-based algorithm applied to all 336 genes regulated
  by nemorosone treatment. The gene expression fold changes subsequent to the hypothetical
  nemorosone-induced calcium release from the ER are depicted. Red genes are up-regulated,
  green genes are down-regulated. Nemorosone-induced ER stress is sensed by three
  ER-resident proteins (PERK, ATF6, IRE1α), thus inducing downstream transcription
  factors ATF4, ATF3 and DDIT3 mainly involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.
  If ER stress cannot be resolved through induction of pro-survival genes and growth
  factors, DDIT3 induced pro-apoptotic BCL2 family members like BAK1 and BCL2L11,
  thus initiating the caspase cascade. Expression levels of genes marked with # were
  inferred by quantitative PCR rather than microarray measurements (C). GO, gene ontology.'
