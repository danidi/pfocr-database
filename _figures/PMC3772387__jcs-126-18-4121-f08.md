caption: Recruitment of FLNa, IQGAP1 and RacGAP1 to active β1 integrin regulates Rac1
  activity. Scheme representing a cycle of sequential integrin-mediated signalling
  events regulating Rac1 activation. Integrin–ECM engagement triggers an increase
  in Rac1 activity, most likely via the recruitment of a GEF (1). Rac1 activity levels
  increase to a maximum, and FLNa and IQGAP1 are recruited (2 and 3). FLNa and IQGAP1
  recruit RacGAP1 to suppress Rac1 activity (3 and 4). Rac1 activation level is represented
  by a red gradient around its edge. Hypothetical activation and protein level of
  GEFs and GAPs are represented by the size of their nodes.
