caption: Three basic strategies of interaction (neutral—blue line, negative—red line,
  positive—green line) existing between the rhizobacteria and growing plants. In the
  negative interaction, it is highlighted the pathway of ethylene (ET) that occurs
  under soil stress, and the effect of mitigation that can be played by PGPRs on a
  plant root’s cell. Regulation of ethylene signalling and plant stress response.
  Ethylene pathway in plants. ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) the amino
  acid methionine is converted to SAM (S-adenosylmethionine) by the action of ACC
  synthase enzyme (ACS). ACC is then converted to ethylene by the enzyme ACC oxidase
  (ACO), triggering different ethylene response factors (ERFs). Plant growth-promoting
  bacteria can alter all steps of ethylene signalling. Some bacteria species can increase
  the ethylene levels by producing ACC oxidase (microbial ethylene-forming enzyme),
  by inducing ACC synthase in plant or by affecting other plant hormones indirectly.
  They can also modulate ethylene response by producing plant hormones that interact
  with ethylene signalling. Other microorganisms can also decrease ethylene production
  by cleaving its precursor ACC. ACC, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate; ACS, ACC
  synthase; ACO, ACC oxidase; Ax, Auxine; ET, Ethylene; ERFs, Ethylene Response Factors;
