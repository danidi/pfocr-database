caption: Model for the role of SWI/SNF in excision repair. Our data suggest that repair
  factors recruit SWI/SNF to lesion sites to remodel the nucleosome (left arm) but
  do not exclude the alternative pathway, in which remodeling by SWI/SNF first accelerates
  the assembly of the repair factors to form PIC1 (right arm). SWI/SNF may contribute
  to the subsequent steps, PIC2 and PIC3 formation, as well. Circles indicate histones,
  asterisks indicate DNA damage, and the half arrow indicates repair synthesis. F/1,
  XPF/ERCC1.
