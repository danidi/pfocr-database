caption: The synthesis of ceramide is regulated by several enzymes such as sphingomyelinase,
  β-glucocerebrosidase, and ceramidase. Also a de novo pathway mediated by serine
  palmitoyltransferase (SPT) functions as the key pathway of ceramide systhesis. SM,
  spingomyelin; SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase.
