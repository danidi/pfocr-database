caption: Mechanisms involved in aging-induced Nrf2 dysfunction. The Nrf2 response
  pathway is an evolutionarily conserved adaptive mechanism that attenuates oxidative
  stress, limits the cellular and macromolecular damage caused by the increased free
  radical production, and maintains cellular homeostasis in the vascular wall. Nrf2
  regulates the transcription of over 200 cytoprotective genes involved in antioxidant
  defenses and repair of macromolecular damage through the antioxidant response elements
  (ARE) present in target gene promoters. Aging is associated with dysregulation of
  Nrf2, and as a result, in the aged vasculature oxidative stress fails to activate
  Nrf2-regulated ROS detoxification systems and repair pathways. The scheme depicts
  potential mechanisms that contribute to the dysregulation of Nrf2 activation during
  the vascular aging process
