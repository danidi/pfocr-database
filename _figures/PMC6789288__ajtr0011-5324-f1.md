caption: RhoA/ROCK signaling. GTP-loaded RhoA interacts with RBD domain of ROCK activity
  and induces the activation of RhoA/ROCK signaling. The activation of the RhoA/ROCK
  pathway has been implicated in a wide range of biological processes. Following activation
  of RhoA, ROCK proteins serve as major downstream effectors for mediating actin depolymeriztion
  and actomysion contraction. Substrates of ROCK include MLC, MLCP and LIMK. Phosphorylation
  of the substrates of ROCK such as MLC and LIMK is involved in the stabilization
  of actin filaments and actomysion contraction [,,].
