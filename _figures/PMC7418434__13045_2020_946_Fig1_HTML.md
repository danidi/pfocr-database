caption: 'Pathways controlling ferroptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. Xc-complex
  imports cystine, which is used to synthesize glutathione. Glutathione is used by
  GPX4 to prevent lipid reactive oxygen species accumulation. In this context, the
  normal expression and function of Xc-complex and GPX4 are essential for the inhibition
  of ferroptosis under physiological conditions. Gasdermins form membrane pores to
  cause pyroptosis. The following three pathways have been confirmed to induce pyroptosis
  in mammals: (1) NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1/GSDMD axis, (2) caspase-4/5/11/GSDMD axis, and
  (3) caspase-3/GSDME axis. Membrane-associated MLKL induces necroptosis. When the
  function of caspase-8 is inhibited, the binding of TNF-α and its receptor could
  promote the assembly of a RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signaling complex. RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation
  of MLKL leads to MLKL translocation to the plasma membrane to trigger membrane damage.
  As a result of membrane damage, potassium ion outflow could further activate NLRP3
  through NEK7, which may be a crosstalk with pyroptosis pathway'
