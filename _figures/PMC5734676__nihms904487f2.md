caption: An illustration of the known physiological pathways of one allo-BA, (taurine-conjugated)-allo-cholic
  acid, (T)ACA. The mechanisms shown below have been shown experimentally to occur
  in non-human systems as detailed in the text. In pathway 1, tauro-allo-cholic acid,
  (T)ACA. The mechanisms shown below have been shown experimentally to occur in non-human
  systems as detailed in the text. In pathway 1, tauro-allo-cholic acid is transported
  into hepatocytes by Ntcp and Oatp. In pathway 2, (T)ACA is transported efficiently
  into the hepatocyte nucleus and is capable of activating FXR, though the mechanism
  through which this happens is unknown. A question mark (?) indicates that the current
  mechanism of membrane penetration is unknown, such as in pathway 4, in which (T)ACA
  is transported into the bile canaliculus from hepatocytes through an unknown mechanism.
  In addition, (T)ACA inhibits but is not transported by Bsep. In the center simplified
  cholesterol metabolism schematic (3), the mechanism of planar BA formation is assumed
  to be via SRD5A-mediated cholesterol metabolism, though this has not been definitively
  proven as of yet.
