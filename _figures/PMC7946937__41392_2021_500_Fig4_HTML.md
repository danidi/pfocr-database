caption: Rewired signal pathways by deregulated Myc in cancer and its related components
  available for synthetic lethality. Input signals, including pro-stability signals
  from CAMKIIγ or Aurora B kinase, pro-expression signals from IRE1α–XBP1s pathway,
  and gross genetic changes of Myc, lead to the deregulation of Myc. Multiple pathways,
  including cell cycle progression, DNA repair, ER stress response, mRNA processing,
  metabolism, and transcription, were rewired by the output signal from oncogenic
  Myc to meet its oncogenic needs. Among these Myc-educated signal pathways, some
  related components indicated here have been verified as synthetic lethal partners
  of oncogenic Myc
