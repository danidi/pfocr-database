caption: Endosomal and cytoplasmic pathways for virus recognition and IFN production.
  In DCs, TLR7 and TLR8 located in endosomal compartments recognize viral ssRNA through
  either direct infection, autophagocytic uptake of viral material from cytoplasm
  or phagocytic uptake of other infected cells or vial particles. Both TLR 7 and 8
  signal through adaptor MyD88, which through interaction with IRAK4/IRAK1/TRAF6 complex
  leads to phosphorylation and activation of IRF7 and subsequent IFN transcription.
  TLR3 located in endosomes of cDCs, macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts
  is activated by encountering dsRNA. Following its activation, TLR3 signals through
  its adaptor, TRIF which leads to activation of noncanonical IKK kinases (TBK1/IKKε)
  and subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. NF-κB is also
  activated by TRIF mediated signaling through canonical IKK kinases (IKKα, β, and
  γ). Cytoplasmically located RIG-I and MDA5 are expressed in most cells and recognize
  5′ppp containing dsRNA or long dsRNA, respectively. Both of these cytoplasmic sensors
  upon activation interact and signal through the mitochondrially located adaptor
  MAVS. This signaling pathway, analogous to that of TLR3, leads to activation of
  the canonical and noncanonical IKK kinases and the following nuclear transclocation
  of NF-κB and IRF3. Concurrent activation of IRF3 and NF-κB in turn allows for transcription
  of IFN genes and its synthesis and export
