caption: Adipose tissue requires glycerol-3-phosphate as the initial substrate for
  triglyceride and glycerophospholipid biosynthesis. Initially, glycerol-3-phosphate
  is acylated using fatty acyl coenzyme A (FA-CoA) at the sn-1 position by the class
  of enzymes called glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPATs), and forms 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate
  or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Further acylation of LPA at the sn-2 position by
  the enzymes called 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (AGPATs or LPAATs)
  results in formation of phosphatidic acid (PA). Phosphatidic acid phosphatases then
  remove the phosphate group from PA to produce diacylglycerol (DAG). Further acylation
  of DAG at the sn-3 position by the enzymes called diacylglycerol acyltransferases
  (DGATs) finally produces triacylglycerol (TG). The synthesis of glycerophospholipids
  uses the intermediates, PA and DAG. Phosphatidylinositol and cardiolipin can be
  formed from PA, whereas, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine
  can be synthesized from DAG.
