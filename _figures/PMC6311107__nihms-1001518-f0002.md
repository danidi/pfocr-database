caption: A simplified model of the molecular pathways by which pazopanib and AR42
  combine to kill cancer cells. As an HDAC inhibitor, AR42 causes DNA damage and causes
  inhibitory chaperone acetylation. Pazopanib, as a multikinase and chaperone inhibitor,
  also inhibits chaperone activities as well as many class III receptor tyrosine kinases.
  DNA damage causes activation of ATM. ATM signals to activate the AMPK. AMPK signaling
  inactivates RAPTOR and TSC2 resulting in the inactivation of mTORC1 and mTORC2.
  Downstream of mTOR is the kinase ULK-1; the drug combination via AMPK promotes ULK-1S317
  phosphorylation which activates the kinase; the drug combination via mTOR inactivation
  reduces ULK-1S757 phosphorylation which also activates the kinase. Activated ULK-1
  phosphorylates ATG13 which is the key gate-keeper step in permitting autophagosome
  formation. AR42-induced ATM signaling also acts to reduce the activities of multiple
  chaperone proteins. Reduced HSP90 and HSP70 function lowers the expression of all
  receptor tyrosine kinases and the activities of STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2, and AKT that
  results in lower expression of ROS/RNS detoxifying enzymes such as TRX and SOD2.
  Reduced GRP78 function causes activation of PERK and subsequently eIF2α. Enhanced
  eIF2α signaling reduces the transcription of proteins with short halflives such
  as c-FLIP-s, MCL-1, and BCL-XL, and enhances expression of Beclin1, DR4, and DR5.
  Thus, the convergent actions of reduced HSP90 and HSP70 chaperone activity and eIF2α
  signaling lead to a profound reduction in the protein levels of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1,
  and BCL-XL which facilitates death receptor signaling through CD95, DR4, and DR5
  to activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Enhanced Beclin1 expression converges
  with elevated ATG13 phosphorylation to produce high levels of autophagosome formation
  that acts to reduce HDAC2/5/6/10/11 expression but also to stall autophagosome fusion
  with lysosomes and to stall autolysosome maturation, which likely through cytosolic
  cathepsin proteases converges with the extrinsic apoptosis pathway to cleave BID
  and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Tumor cell killing downstream of the mitochondrion
  was mediated by AIF and not caspases 3/7. The tumoricidal actions of AIF were facilitated
  by reduced HSP70 functionality as this chaperone can sequester AIF in the cytosol
  and prevent its translocation to the nucleus.
