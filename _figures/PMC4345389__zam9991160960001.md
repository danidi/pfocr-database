caption: Overview of natural metabolic pathways that can be harnessed for the conversion
  of glucose to valuable aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes through carboxylic acid
  intermediates based on E. coli metabolism. Aldehydes can also be obtained from the
  2-keto acid pathway (, ), terpenoid pathways (), and other pathways. TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid.
