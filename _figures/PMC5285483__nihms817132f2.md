caption: During normal development (top panel), MET signaling is absent (white shading)
  during progenitor cell proliferation and neuron migration. MET signaling increases
  and is maintained at high levels (pink shading) during the early and peak periods
  of process outgrowth and synapse formation. At this time, activation of MET by its
  ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), results in an increase in the phosphorylated
  receptor (pMET), which activates the MAPK/ERK pathway to increase dendritic growth.
  In the same neurons, pMET also activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to promote immature
  synapse formation, denoted by the NMDA (green) and AMPA (red) glutamate receptor
  ratio in the postsynaptic membrane. During the period of synaptic refinement, MET
  signaling rapidly declines (white shading), and is accompanied by a maturation (increased
  AMPA:NMDA ratio) of the nascent synapses. In the absence of MET signaling (middle
  panel), there is a reduction in spine density, but an increase in spine head volume
  that is accompanied by a premature onset of synapse maturation (early AMPA:NMDA
  ratio increase). In contrast, prolonged MET signaling (bottom panel) increases dendritic
  growth and promotes nascent synapse formation, but delays synapse maturation.
