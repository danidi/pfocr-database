caption: 'The Hippo signalling pathway in tumour cells and its association with tumour-associated
  macrophages (TAMs): mammalian sterile 20-like kinases 1 and 2 (MST1/2) combine with
  the scaffolding protein Salvador/WW45 to phosphorylate the NDR family kinases Lats1
  and Lats2 (Lats1/2) downstream, and the adaptor protein Mob1, after which, they
  phosphorylate the YAP and TAZ. Phosphor-YAP and TAZ would be sustained and degraded
  in the cytoplasm, thereby preventing nuclear accumulation and leading to cell proliferation,
  PD-L1 expression, and drug resistance. Furthermore, aberrant YAP transcription in
  the nucleus is highly correlated with the secretion of IL-6, IL-4, MCP-1, CSF-1,
  and IL-13, which might enable the infiltration of recruited TAMs and induce M2 polarization.
  The alternatively (M2) activated TAMs are anti-inflammatory cells, which exacerbate
  the migration and proliferation of tumour cells.'
