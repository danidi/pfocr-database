caption: Apoptosis, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulated by
  the caspase family. Stress stimulation such as DNA damage can trigger intrinsic
  apoptosis, in which releasing cytochrome c activates the complex of apoptosis-activating
  factor 1 (Apaf-1) and caspase-9, initiating the auto-activation of caspase-9. The
  binding of cell surface death ligand and receptors induces extrinsic apoptosis,
  and caspase-8 or caspase-10 are the initiator caspases. Caspase-3, -6 and -7 execute
  apoptosis effector of both apoptosis pathways to catalyze a variety of key cellular
  substrates. Death stimulations restrain anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 subfamily
  through the pro-apoptotic factors BH3 subfamily and then activate the pro-apoptotic
  factors Bax subfamily, functioning as the co-factor of caspases. The central member
  of the caspases in response to the inflammation is caspase-1. Inflammasome sensors
  (The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) family,
  the HIN200 family member absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) and the TRIM family member
  Pyrin) identify the inflammatory irritants such as pathogens and activate caspase-1
  by forming a complex with the adaptor protein apoptosis associated speck like protein
  containing a CARD (ASC) and caspase-1 to promote the maturation and secretion of
  IL-1β and IL-18 in the canonical inflammasome pathway. Caspase-4, -5 and -11 respond
  to lipopolysaccharide arising from Gram-negative bacterial infection with the non-canonical
  inflammasome pathway. Finally, severe inflammations lead to apoptosis. ER stress
  response is mediated by caspase-4, -5, -8 and -12 with different mechanisms to induce
  inflammation and apoptosis. Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α) and PKR-like ER
  kinase (PERK) are the transmembrane sensors of ER. The Human transmembrane protein
  214 (TMEM214) locates at the upstream of caspase-4.
