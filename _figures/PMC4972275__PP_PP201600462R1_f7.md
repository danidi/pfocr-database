caption: 'Possible pathways for 7-heptadecene synthesis in C. reinhardtii. Two major
  possibilities are presented based on findings of this work and reactions known in
  other organisms. The specificity for cis-vaccenic acid would be brought by a phospholipase
  A1 or another type of lipase depending on the lipid used as substrate. Left side:
  cyanobacterial- or plant-type pathway with acyl reduction and formal decarbonylation
  of aldehyde intermediate. Chloroplast localization would involve acyl-acyl carrier
  protein (acyl-ACP) substrate, while other subcellular localizations would involve
  acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) substrate. Right side: bacterium-type pathway with decarboxylation
  of a free fatty acid (but without formation of terminal double bond). Decarbonylase
  and decarboxylase are indicated with quotes because decarbonylation and decarboxylation
  might be only formal and not actual reactions. Regulation by light may occur at
  the step of free fatty acid generation and/or at its conversion to heptadecene.'
