caption: HLA class II-restricted helper CD4+ T cell responses can prolong CD8+ CTL
  activity. (A) CD8+ T cells recognize HLA class I-peptide complexes on tumor cells
  and directly kill cancer cells, reducing tumor burden. However, this reaction is
  not sustained for very long and the remaining tumor mass may continue to divide
  and progress. (B) Tumor cells that express HLA class II proteins or are induced
  to express class II proteins, can stimulate CD4+ T cells resulting in prolonged
  CD8+ CTL response and sustained tumor killing through the release of cytokines and
  immune stimulatory molecules.
