caption: (a) The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) undergoes amyloidogenic processing
  mediated either by β- and γ-secretases to yield amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) (purple rectangles).
  Amyloidogenic processing of APP largely occurs in lipid rafts. Cholesterol and LRP,
  an ApoE receptor, promote the localization of BACE1 to lipid rafts. GGPP (a short
  chain isoprenoid) has been shown to promote the association of the γ-secretase complex
  with lipid rafts. Several lipids (shown in bold text) and lipid metabolizing proteins
  (italicized bold text) influence APP processing through a variety of mechanisms.
  (b) APP is also subjected in neurons to a non-amyloidogenic pathway mediated by
  α-secretase. Localization of APP to non-lipid raft compartments favors processing
  by α-secretase. Isoprenoids, diaglycerol and phospholipase C (PLC) have been shown
  to promote the non-amyloidogenic pathway. (c) The relative abundance or absence
  of the lipids listed on the figure directly influences the activity of BACE1 or
  γ-secretase. Increased levels of cholesterol or ceramide enhance the activity of
  BACE1. Cholesterol and sphingolipids are positive modulators of γ-secretase activity
  while SMase and PLD1 have been identified as negative modulators of γ-secretase
  activity. PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 promotes amyloidogenesis by stimulating
  γ-secretase activity and PtdIns(4,5)P2 has been shown to directly inhibit γ-secretase
  activity.
