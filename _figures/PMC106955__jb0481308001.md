caption: The biosynthetic pathway for synthesis of l-isoleucine and l-valine. ALS
  catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate and condensation of the resultant hydroxyethyl-thiamine
  pyrophosphate moiety with α-ketobutyrate in isoleucine biosynthesis and condensation
  with another molecule of pyruvate in valine biosynthesis. In E. coli K-12, two ALS
  isozymes are normally expressed. In the strain used in this study, ALS I, which
  is insensitive to SM, was not expressed. Catalysis of this step was by ALS III,
  which is inhibited by SM.
