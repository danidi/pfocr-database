caption: Extracellular glucose is taken up by glucose transporters, including GLUT3,
  as well as by diffusion and is metabolized by hexokinase (HK) and glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase (GPI) to enter different metabolic pathways. The glycolytic pathway includes
  subsequent steps mediated by PFK, ALDO, and GAPDH; LDH also supports the glycolytic
  pathway by production of the GAPDH coenzyme NAD+. These enzymes were all upregulated
  in T4-2 cells, leading to loss of integration of form and function. The sAC-EPAC-RAP1
  pathway regulates β1 integrin positively, most likely via a direct link between
  ATP production in the glycolytic pathway and cAMP generation by sAC, which is mediated
  by tumor-specific PKM2-sAC association. HBP (dashed outline) is rate-limited by
  GFPT, which is also upregulated via activation of oncogenic signaling. Downstream
  O-GlcNAcylation of target proteins mediated by OGT regulates β1 integrin, EGFR,
  and GLUT3 expression. Inhibition of any of the key metabolic enzymes or the key
  signaling molecules results in suppression of all the others, reestablishment of
  the polarized acinar structure, and growth arrest. See Results and Discussion for
  details. Fonts distinguish metabolites (italic), proteins (bold), and genes (bold
  and italic). Colored text highlights proteins upregulated in T4-2 cells (orange),
  energy carrier molecules (green), and chemical reagents that do (red) or do not
  (purple) induce phenotypic reversion. 2DGP, 2DG-phosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
