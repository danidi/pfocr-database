caption: Nutrient starvation causes an AMPK-dependent p53 non-canonical pathway activation,
  which leads to the upregulation of LAL-mediated lysosome acid lipolysis. This pathway
  plays key role for adipocyte oscillating between glycolysis and lipolysis under
  feeding and fasting states. In insulin resistance, p53 is found to be upregulated,
  while p53 downregulation is associated with insulin sensitivity.
