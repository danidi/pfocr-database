caption: 'Menin-associated pathways with potential targeted therapies. Menin, which
  is encoded by the MEN1 gene, has roles in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and loss of
  menin expression (represented by grey boxes in the diagram) results in increased
  cell proliferation by multiple different pathways. Thus, in the nucleus, menin:
  interacts with the transcription factor JunD and the protein arginine methyltransferase
  (PRMT) 5 to repress transcription of target genes, for example Gastrin and Gas1,
  respectively,; binds to mixed linage leukaemia proteins MLL1 and/or MLL2, and Smad3,
  which is a TGF-β signalling component, to promote transcription of target genes–;
  and regulates the Wnt pathway by preventing β-catenin from entering the nucleus
  and therefore preventing transcription of Wnt pathway target genes,. In the cytoplasm,
  menin inhibits: the mTOR pathway, by binding to Akt, which is downstream of PI3K
  that is part of the RTK signalling pathway, and preventing its translocation to
  the plasma membrane; and K-Ras induced proliferation, by possible inhibition of
  ERK dependent phosphorylation and prevention of the interaction between SOS and
  K-Ras,. These advances in understanding the function of menin, have helped to identify
  potential new and targeted therapies (indicated in blue), which include: mTOR inhibitors;
  Wnt pathway inhibitors e.g. β-catenin antagonists; epigenetic modulators; MEN1 gene
  replacement; analogues of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), which interact and alter TGF-β
  signalling, that includes the menin-interacting protein Smad3; RTK inhibitors; and
  somatostatin analogues which act on a broader spectrum of SSTRs. All pathways affect
  proliferation (shown in the cytoplasm only), which involves both nuclear and cytoplasmic
  process and mechanisms; RTK – receptor tyrosine kinase; GF – growth factor; P13K
  – phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt – protein kinase B; mTOR – mechanistic target of
  rapamycin; FRZ – fizzled; MLL – mixed lineage leukemia; CDKN – cyclin dependent
  kinase inhibitor; PRMT5 – protein arginine N-methytransferase 5; GAS1 – growth arrest
  specific 1; SMAD3 – mothers against decapentaplegic hormone 3; TGFβ(R) – transforming
  growth factor beta (receptor); TSP1 – thrombospondin 1; SST(R) – somatostatin (receptor);
  SOS1 – sons of sevenless 1; RASSF1A – ras associated domain family member 1 isoform
