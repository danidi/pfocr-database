caption: Molecular events in cholangiocarcinogenesis. Chronic biliary inflammation
  and cholestasis lead to cellular changes leading to cholangiocarcinoma development
  and progression. Inflammatory cytokines induce iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase)
  in cholangiocytes, favoring mutagenesis, impaired DNA repair, and COX-2 up-regulation.
  Aberrant bile acid signaling contributes to the promotion of cholangiocyte growth
  via transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and is also
  linked to activation of the COX-2 pathway. Alterations in various genetic and epigenetic
  molecular pathways selectively depicted in the figure then combine to promote the
  features of immortalization, evasion of apoptosis, autonomous proliferation, and
  invasion and metastasis characteristic of malignant cholangiocytes. MMP, matrix
  metalloproteinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; TGF, transforming growth
  factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
