caption: Schema of deriving corneal cell phenotype from iPSCs. Human iPSCs treated
  with competitors of activin, and nodal pathways result in the inhibition of SMAD
  signaling inducing neuroectodermal progenitor (NEP) fate by activation of Zic and
  Fox gene family. Subsequent directed differentiation of NEPs to corneal epithelial
  cells (CEPs) having expression of Pax6, ABCG2, p63, and cytokeratin 12 and 13 is
  done by inhibiting TGFβ and WNT signaling pathways. To obtain CSKs, iPSCs are at
  first directed towards NCC phenotype by inhibiting TGFβ and BMP4 signaling using
  SB431542 and Noggin respectively. NCCs can be differentiated to keratocan and ABCB5-positive
  CSKs by following a co-culture system involving PA6 stromal cells for SDIA or by
  following a more defined culture method utilizing the bFGF and ascorbic acid (ascorpate-2-phosphate,
  A-2-P) signaling pathway. ZO-1 and Na,K-ATPase-positive CEnCs (see references [,
  ] for hCEnC markers) can be differentiated from NCC following a sequential differentiation
  procedure where the NCCs are first treated with a GSK3b inhibitor to activate the
  WNT/β-catenin pathway followed by treatment with SB431542 to inhibit TGFβ-mediated
  SMAD signaling. RA promotes terminal CEnC differentiation inhibiting while ROCK
  inhibitor promotes survival and enhances functional properties of the CEnCS [, ]
