caption: In OSCC cells, vitamin D promoted LCN2 promoter methylation to inhibit LCN2
  protein expression, which reduced LCN2-RPS3 binding and thus reduced RPS3-NF-κB
  binding. The formation of the NF-κB complex ultimately reduced the activation of
  NF-κB, increasing the chemotherapeutic sensitivity of the tumour to cisplatin.
