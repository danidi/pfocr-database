caption: Proposed mechanism for how αvβ3 integrin signaling could be mediating fibronectin
  matrix assembly in TM cells. Recent studies by Schiller et al. suggest that there
  are alternative ways in which stress fibers can be assembled by integrin signaling.
  Signaling from α5β1 integrins can activate a RhoA/ROCK-dependent signaling pathway
  that results in myosin phosphorylation. In contrast, αvβ3 integrin signaling can
  use a separate ROCK-independent pathway that utilizes RhoA/mDia, which promotes
  enhanced F-actin polymerization that is required for the formation of stress fibers.
  In addition, these actin filaments are necessary for the formation of fibrillar
  adhesions that are the sites of fibronectin fibrillogenesis. Together these two
  processes lead to stronger contractile forces that could ultimately lead to the
  enhanced fibronectin matrix assembly demonstrated by CAβ3 cells.
