caption: Working model for the role of peroxisomes in fungal infection. During infection,
  lipid bodies in fungal conidia are mobilized by the Pmk1‐mitogen‐activated protein
  kinase (Pmk1‐MAPK) signalling pathway and cyclic adenosine monophosphate/protein
  kinase A (cAMP/PKA) signalling pathway. After lipolysis, lipid bodies are degraded
  into fatty acids and glycerol. Fatty acids can induce the peroxisomal fission process,
  through which the peroxisomal number is rapidly increased. After peroxisome biogenesis
  and the peroxisomal protein import process, the newly formed peroxisomes become
  mature. Then, fatty acids can be degraded by peroxisomal β‐oxidation. The main product
  of fatty acid oxidation is acetyl‐coenzyme A (acetyl‐CoA), which can be used by
  the glyoxylate cycle for structural and nutrient material during host infection.
  When fatty acids are consumed, the peroxisomes are degraded by the pexophagy process.
