caption: Application of IROA metabolomics for evaluating impacts of small molecules
  on targeted natural product biosynthetic pathways. Impacts of bipyridyl on N. dassonvillei
  production of DKPs 1–10 were evaluated. (A) The previously reported biosynthetic
  pathway for 1–10 includes aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (AARS)-catalyzed ligation of
  amino acids with tRNAs, followed by cyclodipeptide synthase (CDPS)-catalyzed formation
  of DKPs 1, 3, and 6 from different combinations of aminoacyl-tRNAs. Tailoring of
  these DKP intermediates by a cyclic dipeptide oxidase (CDO) and/or methyltransferase
  (MT) leads to final products 2, 5, and 10 []. (B) LC/MS2 supported identification
  of each DKP from N. dassonvillei extracts. Comparison of MS2 fragments for 1, 3,
  and 6 from N. dassonvillei with synthetic standards supported their identification,
  while dehydrogenated and/or methylated derivatives were confirmed by correspondence
  between observed fragments shown in color with literature values [,]. (C) Heatmap
  of mean (n = 4) log2 fold changes in abundance of DKP pathway metabolites in response
  to bipyridyl. From left-to-right, the heatmap is arranged in the order of precursors
  leading to final DKPs 2, 5, and 10. Map fields marked with “X” indicate metabolites
  not required for production of the final DKP indicated in that row, fields in gray
  indicate previously reported pathway intermediates that were not detected in our
  experiments, and numbers superimposed within the heatmap correspond to compound
  numbers from (A). Xaa and Yaa indicate Phe, Leu, or Tyr residues of DKPs.
