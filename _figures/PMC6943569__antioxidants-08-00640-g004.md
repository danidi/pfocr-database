caption: Activation of NF-кB by the canonical and/or the noncanonical pathway. The
  canonical NF- кB-activating pathway depends on the phosphorylation of IкB-kinase
  (IKK) β. The phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IкBα translocate NF-кB into the
  nucleus. where it helps in the transcription of target genes. Many membrane-bound
  ligands involved in activating the NF-кB pathway act as effective upstream regulators
  and the IKK complex is the common upstream component of all NF-кB pathways. In contrast,
  the non-canonical pathway is NF-kB essential modulator (NEMO)-independent and depends
  on IKKα activation to induce the NF-kB/RelB activation complex, leading to the phosphorylation
  of p100 and the generation of p52/RelB complexes.
