caption: Model for possible mechanisms of regulation of DP thymocytes by multiple
  factors. Activation of RORγt transcription requires cooperation of the transcription
  factors TCF-1 and HEB. There are three possible pathways responsible for activation
  of TCF-1. (1) preTCR signals might activate β-catenin, which translocates into the
  nucleus and switches TCF-1 from a repressor to an activator, eventually leading
  to induction of RORγt transcription. (2) Activation of β-catenin could also result
  from the binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled receptor in the canonical Wnt signaling
  pathway. (3) preTCR signals might induce TCF-1 transcription independently of β-catenin.
  These three possible pathways may be non-exclusive, and could have synergy that
  leads to maximal activation of TCF-1 at the DN4 and DP stages. Compared to TCF-1,
  which upon activation functions to stimulate RORγt transcription, HEB seems to mediate
  fine-tuning of RORγt transcription. At the DN to DP transition, preTCR signals upregulate
  Egr3 transiently. Egr3-induced Id3 sequesters E proteins such as HEB from binding
  to the RORγt promoter. Because both HEB and TCF-1 are required for substantial induction
  of RORγt, the absence of HEB leads to reduction of RORγt expression. When thymocytes
  differentiate to the DP stage, Egr3 subsides and Id3 is removed, which leads to
  recovery of HEB activity. HEB then binds to the RORγt promoter, together with already
  activated TCF-1, and leads to stimulation of maximal RORγt transcription. HEB binds
  to two E-box sites 200 bp upstream of the RORγt transcription starting site, whereas
  TCF-1 targets the 200 bp fragment between the RORγt transcription starting site
  and translation starting site, as determined based on our ChIP assay results. Whether
  HEB and TCF-1 interact with and influence each other’s activity remains unknown.
  RORγt and c-Myb cooperate in upregulating Bcl-xL, which eventually leads to protection
  of DP thymocytes from apoptosis. Mcl-1 could also enhance DP thymocyte survival;
  however, it is not essential and may only partially compensate for lack of Bcl-xL.
  Dashed lines indicate pathways and interactions that have not yet been proven.
