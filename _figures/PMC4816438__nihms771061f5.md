caption: Schematic representation of the components of the complex purinergic signaling
  pathways mediated by extracellular nucleotides. Intracellular ATP (3–5 mM) is released
  from the cells in small quantities into the extracellular milieu through specific
  transport processes, such as nucleotide transporters (NT) or pannexin (PNX) or connexin
  (CNX) hemichannels. Extracellular ATP, even at low-micromolar (5–20 μM) concentrations,
  interacts with P2X or P2Y receptors. P2X receptors (subtypes 1–7) are ATP-gated
  channels that open up, allowing ions (Na+, K+, or Ca2+) to either influx or efflux.
  P2Y receptors (subtypes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 11–14) are G protein–coupled receptors with
  downstream effector signaling pathways that cause an increase in either intracellular
  free Ca2+ or cyclic AMP (cAMP). The extracellular ATP and related nucleotides are
  sequentially hydrolyzed to ADP and AMP by CD39 [nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase
  1 (NTPDase1)] and/or nucleotide pyrophosphatase (NPP). AMP is converted to adenosine
  by CD73 (5′-ectonucleotidase). Adenosine is a potent agonist of P1 receptors (subtypes
  A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), the activation of which results in increased or decreased
  activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC). Similar to P2Y receptors, P1 receptors are G
  protein–coupled receptors with complex downstream signaling pathways. This pathway
  leading from ATP to the generation of adenosine, known as the CD39-adenosinergic
  axis, is active locally and apparently regulates the balance between P2 and P1 receptor
  activity in cells. Adenosine can also be generated from extracellular cAMP, which
  has two sources. Being stable in blood and body fluids, cAMP released from distant
  organs, such as the liver, can reach kidney cells. cAMP can also be released locally
  within the kidney during heightened receptor-mediated activation of AC. Intracellular
  cAMP reaches the extracellular milieu through the same transport systems used by
  ATP and other nucleotides. Extracellular cAMP is converted to AMP by the action
  of ecto-phosphodiesterase (ePDE) or tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatases (ns-AP).
  The AMP thus formed is converted to adenosine by CD73. This pathway, which connects
  the cAMP formed distantly with the local formation of adenosine from cAMP, is known
  as the extracellular cAMP–adenosine pathway. Another purinergic ligand, the nucleobase
  adenine, is not generated in these two pathways. Instead, extracellular adenine
  either comes from the bloodstream or is released locally from cells through NT.
  Adenine selectively binds to P0 or adenine receptor (AdeR), a G protein–coupled
  receptor. In most species, the activation of the AdeR results in decreased AC activity.
  But there is evidence that some AdeRs may activate AC. ADA denotes adenosine deaminase.
