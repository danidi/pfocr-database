caption: 'The interplay between glucose, acetate, and choline metabolism. By providing
  substrate for de-novo fatty acid synthesis, acetate metabolism may feed into phosphatidylcholine
  synthesis, explaining why tumors showing high uptake of 11C-acetate may also show
  increased uptake of radiolabeled choline on PET. Because acetyl-CoA produced from
  acetate may also serve as a substrate for the citric acid cycle and other pathways,
  it is possible that, for some cancers, 11C-acetate uptake may not always provide
  a consistent readout of tumor lipogenesis. The Kennedy pathway is an ATP-dependent
  pathway that may rely to varying degrees on glycolysis as a source of ATP. ATP:
  Adenosine triphosphate.'
