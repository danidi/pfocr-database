caption: 'Schematic overview of selected amino acid biosynthesis pathways in S. Typhimurium
  and their origin from central metabolic pathways. Genes that encode the relevant
  enzymes are indicated and are further referred to in the text. Intermediates in
  the proline biosynthesis pathway are indicated by numbers, as follows: ①, γ-glutamyl
  phosphate; ②, glutamate γ-semialdehyde; ③, Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. Solid arrows
  indicate single reaction steps, while dotted arrows represent several reactions,
  with the number of steps given in parentheses. The reaction from ② to ③ occurs spontaneously.
  αKG, α-ketoglutarate; αKV, α-keto-isovalerate; CIT, citrate; GLC, glucose; OAA,
  oxaloacetate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, pyruvate.'
