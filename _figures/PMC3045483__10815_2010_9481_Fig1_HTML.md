caption: 'The interactions occuring in the ovarian mural granulosa cells (GC) and
  cumulus cells (CC) after the administration of hCG for ovulation induction. The
  hypothetical figure is based on earlier literature [, , ]. LH will mainly act on
  the mural granulosa cells where it will induce the production of Egf like family
  members: Amphireguline (Areg), Betacelluline (Btc), Epireguline (Ereg). All can
  bind to the Egf receptor (Egfr) present in both GC and CC. Egfr stimulation involves
  the MEK1/2 and MAPK1/3 pathway and will induce Ptgs expression and therefore the
  production of Prostaglandin E2 (Pge2). Both prostaglandin and the Egf like family
  members are secreted by GC and can transduce the ovulatory response in the CC and
  also have an autocrine function in the CC. The ovulatory response will trigger the
  production of Hyaluronic acid synthetase 2 (Has2), Versican (Vcan) and activated
  leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (Alcam), genes occuring predominantly in the CC.
  The expression of Ptgs1 and Syndecan 4 (Sdc4) in GC or CC was not earlier documented
  so its involvement as represented here needs to be further documented'
