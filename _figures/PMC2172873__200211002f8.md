caption: 'GIT1 regulates synapse formation. GIT1 is targeted to synapses through the
  SLD. At the synapse, GIT1, or possibly other related molecules, functions as an
  adaptor protein recruiting exchanges factors, such as PIX, to synapses where they
  locally activate Rac. Locally regulated Rac activation is essential for spine morphogenesis
  and synapse formation. When GIT1/PIX is mislocalized from synapses, Rac is activated
  outside the synaptic area. Mislocalized active Rac is responsible for the increased
  dendritic protrusions and decreased synaptic density. Inhibition of the Rac signaling
  pathway results in a decrease in the density of spines and synapses. The indicated
  domains of GIT1 are as follows: ARF-GAP domain (ARF-GAP), ankyrin repeats (ANK),
  Spa2 homology domain 1 (SHD1), synaptic localization domain (SLD), and paxillin
  binding domain (PAX). The question mark indicates the unknown molecule that targets
  GIT1 to synapses.'
