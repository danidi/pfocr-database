caption: Mechanism by which apigenin induces apoptosis and suppresses cell growth
  in HCT-116 cells. Apigenin affects the PKCδ pathway to increase p21 and NAG-1 expressions,
  followed by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation. Phosphor-p53 at
  Ser-37 and Ser-15, which are active forms, were increased by apigenin through the
  ATM pathway. Overall, apigenin affects p21 and NAG-1 expression in a p53- independent
  pathway.
