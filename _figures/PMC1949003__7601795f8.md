caption: 'Model for the role of Tps1 in Magnaporthe grisea. In response to G6P and
  nitrate, Tps1 coordinates nitrate utilisation by a genetic response involving NMR1
  and a post-translational effect on NADPH levels via stimulation of G6PPDH activity.
  Tps1 also regulates glycogen metabolism based on its effect on G6P levels and independently
  controls sporulation-related functions and virulence-associated gene expression.
  Protein names are explained in the text, except the following: PGM, phosphoglucomutase;
  GS, glycogen synthase; G6PDH, G6P dehydrogenase; GP, glycogen phosphorylase; Nia1,
  nitrate reductase and Nii1, nitrite reductase.'
