caption: Many cellular stress stimuli activate p38MAPK leading to phosphorylation
  of specific serine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR (, , ) [Step 1]. Domain-specific
  polarity factors could either enhance uptake from the apical membranes [Step 2a],
  or alternatively inhibit uptake from BL membranes similar to physical interactions
  between EGFR and E-cadherin that limit ligand-induced EGFR internalization () [Step
  2b]. These p38MAPK-induced modifications cause EGFR internalization and arrest at
  nondegradative endosomes, where the receptors have kinase signaling functions independent
  of exogenous soluble ligands (, ) [Step 3]. Stress-exposed EGFRs are sorted to ILVs
  by a subset of ESCRT components including HRS that enables the recruitment of ESCRT-I,
  and Alix which carries out multiple functions including cargo recognition, linking
  ESCRT-I to ESCRT-III necessary for ILV formation, and ILV back-fusion with endosomal
  limiting membranes (, ) [Steps 4a, 4b]. Although it is currently unclear how stress-exposed
  EGFRs are transactivated in endosomes, the most likely explanation involves c-Src
  dependent phosphorylation of Tyr-845 in the activation loop of the EGFR kinase domain
  that also drives robust EGFR-STAT3 signaling (, ) [Step 5]. The EGFR-STAT3 pathway
  triggers a TWIST-dependent EMT transcription program that could conceivably provide
  positive selection for emerging tumor cells by counteracting anoikis sensitivity,
  activating matrix metallopeptidases that regulate cell invasiveness, and up-regulating
  vimentin expression to levels that exceed a critical threshold value that marks
  viable cells for apical extrusion and death by anoikis (, ) [Step 6]. TJ, tight
  junction.
