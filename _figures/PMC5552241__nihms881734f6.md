caption: Proposed model of the Src/IGF-IR signaling axis present in both prostate
  cancer Exo and cells. Our model shows signal propagation and crosstalk between IGF-IR
  and Src, leading to FAK activation by Src and downstream activation of proliferative
  signals from the PI3K/AKT pathway and the Ras-MAPK pathway. There is also potential
  regulation by GRK6, as all of these proteins are highly enriched in Exo. This signaling
  axis may be active inside of Exo and may be activated by Exo in recipient cells.
