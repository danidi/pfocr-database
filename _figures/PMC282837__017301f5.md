  Leaves.De novo FA biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA occurs exclusively in the plastids
  of all cells (represented by the oval). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) and fatty
  acid synthase (FAS) complex are key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of C16:0
  FA. Upon elongation to C18:0, this FA undergoes desaturation to C18:1. This step
  is catalyzed by the SSI2-encoded S-ACP-DES. The product of this reaction (C18:1-ACP)
  either enters the prokaryotic pathway of lipid biosynthesis through the acylation
  of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) or is exported out of the plastids as a CoA thioester
  to enter the eukaryotic pathway. The acylation of G3P is catalyzed by an ACT1-encoded
  G3P acyltransferase. Desaturation of the C18:1 present on membrane glycerolipids
  (GL) is catalyzed by FAD2- or FAD6-encoded ω6 desaturases that are present on the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the plastid envelop, respectively. Esterification
  of the CoA group is mediated by acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS). Symbols for various components
  are as follows: ACP, acyl carrier protein; C, carbon; DAG, diacylglycerol; DGDG,
  digalactosyldiacylglycerol; Lyso-PA, 1-acyl-G3P; MGDG, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol;
  PA, phosphatidic acid; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; SL, sulfolipid.'
