caption: Signaling cascades resulting in vegetative growth or asexual reproduction
  in A. nidulans. Signalling involves FluG (see ) and independently, two heterotrimeric
  G-protein complexes, both consisting of SfaD and GpgA (the Gβγ subunits) and the
  Gα subunits FadA and GanB, respectively. GTP-bound FadA and GanB stimulate vegetative
  growth via the cAMP PkaA pathway and repress asexual reproduction via brlA. The
  RGS proteins FlbA and RgsA hydrolyze the GTP bound to FadA and GanB, respectively,
  thereby repressing vegetative growth and promoting asexual development. The SfaD-GpgA
  dimer also stimulates vegetative growth. This is regulated by PhnA. (Adapted from
  ).
