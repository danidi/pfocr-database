caption: Schematic representation of the interrelations between A. baumannii and the
  respiratory epithelium. A. baumannii has several virulence factors that enable the
  bacterium to adhere to and invade host cells. Main proteins involved in the interaction
  with host cells and extracellular host proteins are OmpA, Omp33, OmpW, Ata and FhaB.
  A. baumannii cells are internalized via a zipper mechanism and reside and survive
  within membrane-bound vacuoles. Bronchial epithelial cells respond to A. baumannii
  infections by eliciting the Jak-STAT pathway as well as the intracellular oxidative
  stress response that eventually lead to apoptosis []. TLR2 and TLR4 on type II pneumocytes
  recognize lipoproteins and LOS and release cytokines (i.e., IL-8) via NF-κB and
  p38-Erk1/2-dependent pathway to chemoattract neutrophils at the site of infection
  []. A. baumannii can engage CEACAM-1, -5, and -6 to gain access to type II pneumocytes.
  Internalization through CEACAM-1 triggers IL-8 production together with TLR2 and
  TLR4 via NF-κB and Erk1/2-dependent pathway; however, IL-8 secretion decreases significantly
  at 24 h post-infection, possibly due to a bacterial-induced inhibitory activity
  of CEACAM-1 ITIM on the TLR2 signaling cascade. Conversely, engagement of CEACAM-5
  and -6 triggers induce LC3 associated phagocytosis (LAP) for clearance of A. baumannii
  via the JNK1/2-Rubicon-NOX2 pathway, which inhibits the canonical autophagic pathway
  []. Furthermore, A. baumannii can interact with platelet-activating factor receptors
  (PAFRs) via ChoP-containing OprD, leading to a signaling cascade that includes G
  protein-coupled PLC, clathrin, β-arrestins and an increase of intracellular Ca++,
  thereby leading to bacterial internalization []. Invasion and persistence of A.
  baumannii is assisted by TFEB which induces the autophagosome-lysosome system that
  A. baumannii exploits to traffic intracellularly and persist within lung cells,
  possibly due to reduced lysosome acidification []. It has been hypothesized that
  both intracellular persistence and apoptosis are A. baumannii strategies to allow
  bacterial dissemination to deeper tissues and lead to invasive diseases. Individual
  components are not to scale.
