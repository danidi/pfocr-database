caption: At the systemic level metformin may inhibit tumour development by reducing
  insulin/IGF-1 signalling, preventing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines through
  NF-κB and enhancing the immune response [mediated by natural killer cells (NK cells)
  and cytolytic T-cells (T-cells)] to cancer cells. Metformin also has direct effects
  in cancer cells, many of which are mediated by AMPK. When activated, AMPK disrupts
  cancer cell energy metabolism by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis (inhibition of
  ACC) and suppressing the Warburg phenotype mediated by the action of the hypoxia-induced
  factor (HIF-1) on the glycolytic enzymes pyruvate kinase (PDK) and pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH). AMPK may also block folate and methionine metabolism, which is required for
  nucleotide synthesis. AMPK down-regulates the oncogene c-MYC by inducing the expression
  of Dicer and up-regulates the tumour suppressor p53 by inhibiting its negative regulator
  MDMX. Furthermore, AMPK blocks the mTORC1 signalling pathway by inhibiting Raptor
  and activating TSC2. AMPK independent mechanisms have also been described. Metformin
  can protect against DNA damage by inhibiting complex I and suppressing ROS production.
  Metformin also inhibits hexokinase activity and impairs glucose uptake. Metformin
  can block mTORC1 signalling in the absence of AMPK via inhibition of Rag GTPases.
  Additionally, metformin reduces levels of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1 in
  a p53- and REDD1-dependent manner. Finally, metformin promotes apoptosis by down-regulating
  the Stat3/Bcl-2 pathway through release of cytochrome C and also promotes autophagy.
