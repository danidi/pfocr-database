caption: Proposed model for AMSH and UBPY function in the pathway of agonist-induced
  trafficking of PAR2. 1, proteases cleave PAR2 to expose a tethered ligand that binds
  to and irreversibly activates the receptor. 2, G protein receptor kinases (GRK)
  phosphorylate PAR2, which induces membrane translocation of β-arrestins. β-Arrestins
  interact with phosphorylated PAR2 to uncouple the receptor from heterotrimeric G
  proteins, resulting in desensitization. The E3 ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl translocates
  to the plasma membrane and endosomes to mediate multi-monoubiquitination of activated
  PAR2. 3, β-arrestins serve as adaptors for clathrin- and AP2-mediated endocytosis
  of PAR2. 4, β-arrestins co-internalize with the receptor and recruit a MAPK complex
  that mediates PAR2signaling through the ERK1/2 pathway. 5, PAR2 associates with
  the Hrs-STAM complex in clathrin-coated microdomains of the early endosome. Hrs/STAM
  recruit further components of the ESCRT machinery, leading to receptor sorting into
  intralumenal vesicles. These vesicles give rise to MVBs and late endosomes that
  ultimately fuse with lysosomes and release their internal vesicles within the lysosomal
  lumen. AMSH and UBPY deubiquitinate PAR2, allowing the deubiquitinated receptor
  to invaginate into the lumen of the MVB vesicles. 6, PAR2 is degraded in lysosomes,
  resulting in permanent down-regulation of PAR2signaling. 7, resensitization of protease
  signaling requires mobilization of PAR2 from prominent stores in the Golgi apparatus
  and eventually synthesis of new receptors.
