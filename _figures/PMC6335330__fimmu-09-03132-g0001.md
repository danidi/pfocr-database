caption: Epigenetic regulation at the RUNX3 AS-associated locus. In CD8+ T-cells the
  regulatory region upstream the promoter of RUNX3 is characterized by binding of
  several TFs, included p300 and IRF4, and enhancer histone marks (H3K4Me1). RUNX3
  AS-risk allele has an epigenetic effect to reduce RUNX3 expression that might affect
  CD8+ T-cell numbers and function. The contribution of other genes associated with
  AS, like T-bet, Eomes and IL7R strengthen the involvement of CD8+ T-cells development
  pathway in AS pathogenesis.
