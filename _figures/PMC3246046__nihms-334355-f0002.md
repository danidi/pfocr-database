caption: Mechanisms for induction of a preconditioned neuroprotected phenotype by
  ethanol in stroke. Ethanol exposure activates ionotropic glutamate receptors of
  the kainite Gluk1 receptor (Gluk1-KAR) subtype to release gamma-aminobutyric acid
  (GABA) from intraneuronal synaptic terminals, which subsequently activates postsynaptic
  GABAA receptors (left arm of figure). The ensuing influx of chloride ions through
  activated GABAA receptors hyperpolarizes the membrane, thereby decreasing I/R-induced
  calcium influx through kainite Gluk2 receptors (Gluk2-KAR) via an effect to suppress
  assembly of Gluk2, postsynaptic density protein-95, and mixed-lineage kinase 3 signaling
  module induced by ischemia, which in turn inhibits the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3
  (JNK3) apoptotic pathway. Gluk1-KAR activation also decreases tyrosine phosphorylation
  of synaptic N-methyl-d-apartate receptors (NMDAR), which may also contribute to
  neuroprotection. The central arm illustrates the effect of ingestion of moderate
  levels of ethanol to produce an anti-inflammatory phenotype such that postischemic
  leukocyte/endothelial interactions are suppressed. The attenuation of neutrophil-dependent
  neuronal injury and cell death appears to be initiated by the effect of ethanol
  at moderate levels to invoke the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
  activation of large conductance, calcium-activated potassium (BKCa) channels, cytoprotective
  events that may be mechanistically linked since oxidants can activate these potassium
  channels. Interestingly, NMDAR are thought to be initial pro-survival sensors for
  ethanol, engendering protection against dementia-inducing neuroinflammatory proteins
  (right arm of figure) via activation of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) and focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK), which in turn induce elevations in protective heat shock
  proteins (HSP). Since age-dependent cognitive decline and/or dementia are thought
  to have an ischemic component, the disparate neuroprotective roles of NMDA receptor
  activation versus inhibition in dementia vs ischemic stroke implies dramatically
  different receptor regulation of downstream signaling elements in these conditions.
