caption: 'The network composed of reactions exhibiting change in flux in response
  to increase in glycerol uptake. To understand the potential metabolic response in
  the presence of glycerol, flux balance analysis, with minimization of the sum of
  absolute fluxes as the objective function together with biomass production constraint,
  was performed repeatedly with gradual increase in glycerol uptake. This analysis
  was used to identify reactions with co-related response to change in glycerol uptake
  in the presence of light. Reactions r1–r20, Calvin cycle/glycolysis/gluconeogenesis;
  r21, Pyrdh, r22–r32; TCA cycle; r33–r35, C4 metabolism; r36–r40, Thr metabolism;
  r41–r45, glycerate metabolism; r46–r47, oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; r48–49,
  glycerol degradation; r50, RuBP oxygenase; r51, glycolate oxidase; r52, LHD I–V,
  etc.; AOX, alternative oxidase; L1–L2, light reactions. Reactions with increased
  flux are denoted by green, while those with reduced flux are denoted by red. Note:
  Flux in RuBP carboxylase decreases; however, flux in most of the reactions involved
  with the Calvin cycle increases, as they are also associated with other metabolic
  routes. External metabolites are denoted in the boxes; CO2 and O2 are considered
  to be exchanged between the organism and the medium. 2KG, 2-ketoglutarate; 2PG,
