caption: (A) The strategy for identifying Ub modification sites in protein targets
  and for analyzing polyUb chain topologies. All tryptic sites in ubiquitin are shown.
  (B) Measurement of the abundance of Ub linkages by the AQUA strategy using mass
  spectrometry. The synthesis of stable isotope labeled internal standard as exemplified
  by K48 linkage. It is also shown to use liquid chromatography coupled with multiple
  reaction monitoring (MRM) to quantify K48 and K63 linkages.
