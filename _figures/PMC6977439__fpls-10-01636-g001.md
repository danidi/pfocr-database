caption: Summary of putative interactions as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels increase
  in a C3 plant that assimilates nitrate in their leaves. At present atmospheric conditions,
  the enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) catalyzes both
  the carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, utilizing ATP and NADPH + H+ to
  generate triose-phosphates through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle that can
  be used in sucrose biosynthesis, or the oxygenation, to produce compounds that must
  be “salvaged” through photorespiration (PR). In the PR pathway, reductant equivalents
  are shuttled from the chloroplast through the malate/oxaloacetic acid (OAA) transporter
  to the cytosol and then peroxisome. A portion of these reductant equivalents remain
  in the cytosol where they are used for metabolic processes, such as to maintain
  redox homeostasis through the glutathione-ascorbate Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle
  or nitrate reduction. After nitrate is reduced, nitrite is transported into the
  chloroplast where it is reduced by nitrite reductase (NiR) and reduced ferredoxin
  (Fd-) to ammonium ion. Ammonium ion, either produced from nitrate assimilation or
  received via the phloem, is further converted to glutamine and then glutamate; this
  later conversion, catalyzed by glutamine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT) also
  requires Fd-. Thus, Fd- produced through the thylakoid-associated light-dependent
  reactions is necessary for nitrogen assimilation and also to generate NADPH required
  for the CBB cycle via the Fd–dependent NADP+ reductase (FNR). Under predicted future
  environmental conditions, elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (eCO2) will favour
  the Rubisco carboxylation over oxygenation reaction, increasing the demand for NADPH,
  generated by FNR, in the CBB cycle. Cytosolic reductant levels may decrease as photorespiration
  decreases and this may affect cellular redox balance (Foyer-Halliwell-Asada cycle)
  that links to defence phytohormone levels as well as nitrate assimilation. The phytohormones
  jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) have reciprocal negative effects on each
  other which allows the plant to fine tune its defense responses to the environment.
