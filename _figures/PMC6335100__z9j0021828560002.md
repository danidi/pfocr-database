caption: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling network. The mTOR signaling
  pathway responds to various inputs to regulate biological processes controlling
  cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. In the figure, factors that contribute
  to the activation of mTOR are presented in green, whereas negative regulators are
  shown in red. In response to growth factors, tyrosine kinase receptors autophosphorylate
  and recruit adaptor proteins, including growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)
  and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), which contribute to activate RAt sarcoma
  (RAS) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), respectively. Active RAS amplifies PI3K
  and turns on mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, including RAF proto-oncogene
  serine/threonine-protein kinase (RAF), mitogen-activated kinase kinase (MEK), and
  extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). When active, PI3K promotes the
  production of phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol
  (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), an event that activates mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). PIP3
  production is also required for the activation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase
  1 (PDK1) by growth factors. The activation of mTORC2 and PDK1 promotes protein kinase
  B (AKT) phosphorylation and activity. In addition to AKT, mTORC2 also activates
  other AGC [protein kinase A, G, and C families (PKA, PKC, PKG)] kinases, including
  serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1) and protein kinase C-α
  (PKC-α). The activation of these kinases by mTORC2 affects different biological
  processes, including cytoskeletal rearrangement, metabolism, survival, and cell
  mobility. A major hub integrating growth factor inputs to control the activity of
  mTORC1 is the protein complex tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Phosphorylation
  of TSC by ERK, ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), and AKT inhibits TSC and promotes the
  guanosine triphosphate (GTP) loading of RHEB, a key activator of mTORC1. Inflammation,
  hypoxia, nucleotide levels, and energy deficits also signal to mTORC1, at least
  in part, by affecting the activity of TSC toward RHEB. Amino acids are well known
  to serve as a key activator of mTORC1. Amino acids promote the localization of mTORC1
  and Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) to the lysosome, where the complex can
  be fully activated. mTORC1 senses intralysosomal and cytosolic amino acids through
  distinct mechanisms. The lysosomal amino acid transporter solute carrier family
  38 member 9 (SLC38A9) interacts with the RAG-Ragulator-v-ATPase (vacuolar H+-adenoside
  triphosphate) complex and is required for intralysosomal arginine to activate mTORC1.
  The binding of intralysosomal arginine to SLC38A9 also promotes the efflux of several
  essential amino acids to the cytosol, where they activate mTORC1. Cytosolic amino
  acids use various pathways to promote mTORC1. Arginine binds to its intracellular
  sensor CASTOR1 (cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 1), an event that disrupts
  CASTOR interaction with GATOR2 (GAP activity toward Rags complex 2). In the CASTOR-free
  state, GATOR2 inhibits GATOR1, a complex that represses mTORC1 signaling by acting
  as a GAP for RAGA/B. Leucine similarly activates mTORC1 by activating GATOR2. The
  binding of leucine to its intracellular sensor Sestrin2 breaks up Sestrin2 interaction
  with GATOR2, allowing GATOR2 to repress GATOR1. Thus, in leucine- and arginine-rich
  conditions, RAGA is thought to be mostly GTP loaded, leading to recruitment and
  activation of mTORC1. Lastly, methionine controls mTORC1 via the methionine-derived
  metabolite S-adenosylmethionne (SAM). SAM directly binds to its intracellular sensor
  SAMTOR (SAM sensor upstream of mTORC1), an event that blocks SAMTOR interaction
  with GATOR1. The loss of interaction blocks GATOR1 action on Ras-related GTP-binding
  protein A/B (RagA/B) and activates mTORC1. A complete overview of regulatory processes
  by which amino acids control mTORC1 was recently reviewed by others ( ). The activity
  of mTORC1 can also be activated by cholesterol. Lysosomal cholesterol activates
  mTORC1 through a mechanism that depends on SLC38A9. When active, mTORC1 promotes
  metabolism and the synthesis of several molecules to support growth, including proteins,
  lipids, and nucleotides, through the phosphorylation of several effectors. mTORC1
  also blocks catabolism by repressing autophagy and lysosome biogenesis. 4E-BP1/2,
