caption: 'Mechanistic aspects of the VHL-HIF-BNIP3 signaling pathway. Step A: The
  binding of HIF-α to VHL and to the E3 ligase complex causes HIF-α to be ubiquitinated
  and marked for degradation by the cell’s proteasomal complex. Step B: In a hypoxic
  environment, HIF-α cannot bind the VHL protein, and consequently cannot be degraded.
  Step C: Aberrant functioning of VHL also leads to an accumulation of HIFα. Step
  D: HIF-α levels rise in the cell, allowing the protein to bind with HIFβ. The HIF-α/β
  heterocomplex may be translocated to the nucleus and bind to specific HREs. Step
  E: HREs activates downstream genes, including VEGF, PDGF, TGFα, and several others,
  which have important roles in tumor growth and progression. BNIP3 can also be activated
  by HREs. Step F: Structure of the BNIP3 protein: NH2, N-terminal domain; BH3, Bcl-2
  homology domain 3; CD, conserved domain; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, COOH-terminal
  domain; Step G: BNIP3 can induce mitochondrial autophagy in response to environmental
  changes to promote cell survival. Step H: Under seriously detrimental environmental
  conditions, excessive mitochondrial autophagy is induced, leading to apoptosis.
  Step K: BNIP3-induced cell death is also activated under conditions of extreme hypoxia,
  acidosis and NO. Ub, ubiquitin; HRE, hypoxia-response element; VHL, Hippel-Lindau;
  HIF-1(α/β), hypoxia-inducible factor-1(α/β); VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor;
  PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; TGFα, transforming growth factor α.'
