caption: Herpesviruses modulate the JAK-STAT pathway. When IFNs are induced, Type
  I, II and III IFNs bind to their cognate receptor complexes. When bound to type
  I IFNs, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 heterodimers recruit JAK1 and TYK2 to their cytoplasmic
  tails. Type III IFNs bind to IL-10R2 and IFNLR1 heterodimers to recruit JAK1 and
  TYK2. JAK1 and TYK2 are placed in proximity to IFN receptors and autophosphorylate
  to promote their activation. Activated JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylate tyrosine residues
  within the intracellular carboxyl termini of STAT1 and STAT2. These phosphorylated
  STAT1 and STAT2 form a heterodimer that binds to IRF9, constituting the ISGF3 complex.
  In contrast, type II IFNs activate JAK1 and JAK2 by IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 heterodimers,
  leading to the phosphorylation of both JAK1 and JAK2, and the subsequent phosphorylation
  of receptor chains. Phosphorylated STAT1 forms a homodimer, known as GAF, and translocates
  into the nucleus. In addition, IRF1 can directly translocate into the nucleus and
  transactivate ISGs, including itself. The red lines delineate the impact of viral
  infection on the JAK-STAT pathway. Multiple steps of the JAK-STAT pathway are inhibited
  or hijacked by herpesviruses. The blind-ended lines and arrows indicate the cellular
  components that are inhibited and hijacked by herpesviruses, respectively. The question
  mark denotes an unknown herpesviral protein.
