caption: Mechanism of RNA interference (RNAi). A pri-miRNA molecule is processed by
  an RNAse III enzyme called Drosha and becomes pre-miRNA. Exportin 5 exports the
  pre-miRNA into the cytoplasm where it is processed by the RNAse III enzyme Dicer
  and becomes the mature miRNA. After this point, the endogenous pathway is similar
  to the exogenous pathway, in which synthetic RNAi molecules are inserted into the
  cell cytoplasm. The double-stranded RNA molecule with 19–23 base pairs is then incorporated
  into RISC (or miRISC), were the passenger strand is released, and the guide strand
  mediates the degradation or translation inhibition of its target mRNA
