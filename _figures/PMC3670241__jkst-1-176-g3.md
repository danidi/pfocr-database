caption: Figure 3. Hematopoiesis. (A) The lymph gland is the larval hematopoietic
  organ. In the third larval instar, one large anterior lobe and several smaller posterior
  lobes are found along the dorsal vessel, interspersed with pericardial cells. In
  the anterior lobe, there are three distinct zones. Cells in the posterior signaling
  center (PSC, blue) form the niche for multipotent progenitors called prohemocytes
  that reside in the medullary zone (MZ, green). Prohemocytes are quiescent and eventually
  give rise to all Drosophila blood lineages. Differentiation of hemocytes occurs
  in the cortical zone (CZ, red). Under homeostatic conditions, prohemocytes give
  rise primarily to plasmatocytes, which are phagocytic cells, and crystal cells,
  which mediate melanization reactions. Under immune challenge, prohemoctytes give
  rise to lamellocytes, large flat cells that encapsulate foreign objects. Plasmatocytes
  constitute more than 90% of differentiated hemocytes, while crystal cells and lamellocytes
  make up less than 5%. (B) Cells in the PSC (blue) produce soluble proteins like
  Upd3 and Hedgehog (Hh). Prohemocytes in the MZ (green) respond to Upd and Hh by
  activating JAK-STAT (pSTAT) and Hh signaling (CiACT), respectively, which keeps
  these progenitors quiescent. PSC cells also produce Pvf1, which signals to cells
  in the CZ (red). Pvf1 activates Pvr on differentiating cells in the CZ, which leads
  directly or indirectly to activation of STAT92E (pSTAT) independently of canonical
  JAK-STAT signaling. Activated STAT92E increases expression of Adgf-A, a secreted
  protein. The primary function of Adgf-A is to inactivate extracellular adenosine,
  which can bind the adenosine receptor AdoR to activate PKA. By contrast, Hh signaling
  inhibits PKA. Since the level of PKA activity regulates whether CiACT is cleaved
  into a shorter repressor form (CiR), PKA is a node through which prohemocytes can
  be regulated to remain quiescent via Hh produced by the niche or a Pvr/STAT/Adgf-A
  cascade in CZ cells.
