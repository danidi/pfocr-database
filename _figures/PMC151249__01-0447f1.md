caption: Auxin Regulates the Ubiquitination of Target Proteins, Marking Them for Degradation
  by the 26S Proteasome.Key components of this pathway are shown. Target proteins
  are recruited to the E3 SCF ligase by the F-box protein. Auxin-regulated modification
  of targets, which include the Aux/IAA proteins, is likely to be required before
  recognition by the F-box protein. Ubiquitin (Ub) is activated (via an E1 enzyme)
  and conjugated to the target (via E2–E3 interaction), a process that is reiterated
  to form a polyubiquitin chain. The ubiquitination activity of the SCF is enhanced
  by modification of the cullin subunit with the ubiquitin-like protein RUB1. RUB1
  is activated by AXR1/ECR1, an E1-like enzyme. The COP9 signalosome regulates the
  deconjugation of RUB1 (dotted arrow) and possibly other processes relating to the
  efficient degradation of SCF targets.
