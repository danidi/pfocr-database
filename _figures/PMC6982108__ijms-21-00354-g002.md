number: Figure 2
caption: Molecular mechanisms of regulation of the BR-dependent gene expression in
  rice and other monocots. Transcription factors are shown as ovals, other proteins
  are depicted as rectangles. Green arrows indicate stimulation, whereas red lines
  with the bullet points represent suppression. Detailed description is given in the
  text. Some of the interactions and responses were described in maize (C) and wheat
  (D).
