caption: Interplay between HIF-1α and Notch during hypoxia. The inactive Notch precursor
  is cleaved by a Furin-like convertase and translocates into the cell membrane. The
  binding to a Notch ligand induces a second cleavage by the ADAM (containing a disintegrin
  and metalloprotease) family, resulting in the formation of a membrane-tethered Notch
  truncated fragment, which is further processed at two sites by a presenilin-dependent
  γ-secretase complex; the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), the active form of the
  Notch receptor, is generated. In the absence of NICD, the CSL transcription factor
  represses Notch target gene transcription. Following NICD activation, CSL is converted
  into a transcriptional activator to stimulate transcription of the same genes. Upon
  hypoxia and activation of Notch, HIF-1α potentiates Notch signaling through interactions
  with the NICD and the CSL transcription factor, leading to maintenance of the stem
  cell state. In the presence of factor-inhibiting HIF-1α (FIH-1), HIF-1α becomes
  hydroxylated at asparagine. FIH-1 blocks the interaction of the HIF-1α with the
  transcriptional coactivator p300-CBP (CREB binding protein). NICD can sequester
  FIH-1, thereby preventing hydroxylation of HIF-1α and consequently enhancing HIF-1α
  recruitment to hypoxia-response element sites.
