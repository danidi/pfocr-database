caption: Insulin modulates the SREBP pathway through transcriptional and post-transcriptional
  mechanisms that require the action of mTOR. Insulin-mediate activation of mTOR leads
  to phosphorylation of S6K1, which enhances cleavage of SREBP-1c by activating an
  unknown target. At the same time, mTOR activates an unknown factor that in turn
  modulates the LXR/C-EBPβ complex to enhance transcription of the SREBP-1c gene.
  Finally, mTOR phosphorylates Lipin-1, relieving its inhibition of SREBP transcriptional
  activity.
