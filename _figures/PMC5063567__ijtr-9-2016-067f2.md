caption: 'The role of the kynurenine pathway in inducing tolerance in immune-privileged
  sites, in tumors, and in the tumor microenvironment.Notes: The production of kynurenine
  by the IDO enzymatic activity of tumor cells and of APCs leads to immune tolerance
  in immune-privileged sites and in the tumor microenvironment. Kyn plays a major
  role by inducing Treg cells, which can also be directly induced by the cytokines
  and chemokines produced by tumor cells. The cytokines and chemokines produced by
  tumor cells can also stimulate APCs to activate the KP, which contributes further
  to tumor development. The four major mechanisms of the KP that influence the immune
  response are as follows: (1) Trp depletion followed by GCN2 induction and mTOR1
  suppression; (2) activation of AhR by Kyn; (3) Treg induction through expression
  of CTLA-4 and PTEN; and (4) Kyn-mediated blockade of IL-2. Other factors implicated
  in immune tolerance include tumor cell expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and macrophage expression
  of MIF. Dotted lines represent decreased Trp concentrations.Abbreviations: AhR,
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor; APCs, antigen-presenting cells; DC, dendritic cell; GCN2,
  general control nonderepressible 2; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; IFN-γ, interferon
