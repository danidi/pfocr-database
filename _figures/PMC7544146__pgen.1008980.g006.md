caption: The italic rosy (increased) and green (decreased) letters represent the markedly
  alternated genes of melanin synthesis pathways in crescents and star spots areas
  during the moulting. The metabolites of hemolymp whose abundance changed significantly
  are in colored circles. Dots from blue to orange represent the increasing metabolite
  levels. Black dots are metabolites that were not detected by MS.
