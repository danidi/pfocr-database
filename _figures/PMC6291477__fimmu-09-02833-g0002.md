caption: AHR signaling pathway. AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor the
  resides in the cytosol being held in conformation by chaperone proteins until bound
  by ligand. Once bound by ligand, AHR translocates to the nucleus, sheds its chaperone
  proteins, and binds ARNT. This complex then binds XREs on DNA and induces gene transcription
  of genes such as CYP1A1. AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; ARNT, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor nuclear translocator; XRE, xenobiotic response element; CYP, cytochrome
  P450.
