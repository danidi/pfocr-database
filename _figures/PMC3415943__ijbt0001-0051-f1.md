caption: The regulation of ITGB4BP in cells. With the phosphorylation of ITGB4BP,
  its dissociation from 60s subunit allows the formation of 80s subunit and further
  induces the protein synthesis as a translation initiation factor. Secondly, ITGB4BP
  downregulates the special protein expression via RISC. Thirdly, ITGB4BP inhibits
  cell apoptosis through Bcl-2/Bax signal pathway. Fourthly, ITGB4BP regulates cell
  adhesion and cytoskeleton formation via connecting integrin and intermediate filaments.
