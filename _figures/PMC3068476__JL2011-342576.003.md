caption: Modulation of PA metabolic pathways by sphingolipids in synaptosomes (Syn)
  from adult (a) and aged (b) rat cerebral cortex. In adult Syn (a), Cer modulates
  DAGL and MAGL activities negatively while their phosphorylated form, C1P, stimulates
  MAG and Gly production via LPAPase/MAGL pathway. In aged Syn (b), results indicate
  that there is a major modulation by sphingolipids. Cer and Sph stimulate PA metabolization
  via LPPs/DAGL/MAGL pathway. C1P increases LPAPase, DAGL, and MAGL activities. In
  contrast, S1P inhibits DAG generation but produces an increase in Gly formation.
  (1) LPPs, lipid phosphate phosphatase; (2) DAGL, diacylglycerolipase; (3) MAGL,
  monoacylglycerolipase; (4) PLA, phospholipase A; (5) LPAPase, lysophospholipase
  phosphatase or LPPs. The relative size of arrows indicates the predominance of PA
  metabolism pathway.
