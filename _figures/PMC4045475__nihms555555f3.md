caption: 'Signaling downstream of MUC1 regulates the expression levels of ROS-attenuating
  enzymes (SOD1/2, CAT, and GPx) and increases the flux through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) in order to fine tune ROS levels in cancer cells. The PPP pathway
  produces high levels of NADPH that can neutralize intracellular ROS. MUC1 also enhances
  expression of PDK1 and LDHA that cause decreased carbon flux to the TCA cycle and
  hence, decreased ROS production. Enzymes upregulated by MUC1 are indicated by an
  upward red arrow. All the enzymes are written in blue color. Metabolic pathways
  upregulated by MUC1 are indicated by an upward purple arrow, whereas a downward
  purple arrow indicates metabolic pathways downregulated by MUC1. Abbreviations include
  the following: glucose transporter1 (GLUT1), pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glutathione
  reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase
  (SOD), acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), MCT (Monocarboxylate transporter), TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic
  Acid cycle), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), pyruvate Dehydrogenase Kinase 1 (PDK1),
  lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), α-Ketoglutarate (α-KG), and solute carrier family
  1, member 5 (SLC1A5).'
