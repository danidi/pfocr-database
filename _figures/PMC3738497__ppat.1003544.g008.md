caption: Accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER leads to recruitment of chaperones
  such as BiP and activation of ER stress sensors such as IRE1. (A) IRE1 dimerizes,
  autophosphorylates itself, and activates an endoribonuclease activity, which mediates
  Xbp1 mRNA splicing. The XBP1s protein activates transcription of ERAD genes such
  as ERdj4. (B) MCMV M50 and HCMV UL50 interact with IRE1 and induce IRE1 degradation,
  thereby inhibiting the IRE1-XBP1 pathway shown in A. (C) Activated IRE1 can also
  cleave certain glycoprotein (gp)-encoding mRNAs and microRNAs. (D) Recruitment of
  TRAF2 by activated IRE1 can lead to JNK or caspase-12 activation and subsequent
  induction of apoptosis.
