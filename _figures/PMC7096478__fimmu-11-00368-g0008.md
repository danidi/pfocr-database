caption: Hypothetical model of the possible mechanisms used by M. leprae to modulate
  the expression of the Notch signaling pathway in eccrine cells and their consequences.
  This figure shows how M. leprae could reduce the expression of Hes-1 in the eccrine
  cells. This would block the activation of STAT3 and the function of the stem cells
  located in this cutaneous annex. This effect could be partially mitigated by Runx-1.
  In addition, the reduction of the expression of Hes-1 could be associated with the
  reduction of sweat secretion, probably because the inhibition of the expression
  of the Best-2 channels, with a consequent reduction of secretion of antimicrobial
  peptides (cathelicidin LL-37) and cytokines (IL-31), could promote the proliferation
  of M. leprae and the interaction host-pathogen.
