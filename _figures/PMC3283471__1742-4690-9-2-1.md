caption: 'The interplay between Tax and the DDR pathway dictates cell fate. In the
  early steps of HTLV-1 infection, Tax expression fuels unrestrained cells proliferation
  leading to DNA damage and engagement of the DDR pathway. Severity of genomic lesions
  determines the outcome of DDR activation: a transient cell cycle arrest allowing
  DNA repair and cell survival. If the damage cannot be repaired, cells undergo senescence
  or apoptosis. An intact DDR barrier would thus protect against malignancy. Checkpoint
  adaptation permits DNA damaged cells to proliferate, accumulate and fix mutations
  that can have detrimental, neutral, or positive effects on cell growth. Acquisition
  of growth-promoting mutations is the seed for ATL development, particularly when
  mutations abrogate the dependence on continued Tax-expression for growth. In this
  case, cells would indeed evade both DDR and immune response control.'
