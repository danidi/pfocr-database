caption: RhoA/ROCK‐1 signaling pathway of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Transmembrane
  proteins, such as integrins, located on the MSC membrane can sense mechanical stimuli,
  convert them into mechanical signals, and subsequently transmit them to the G proteins
  that bind them. The G protein then transmits the signal into the cell to catalyze
  the transformation of RhoA to an active GTP state. The activation of RhoA triggers
  the downstream effector molecule ROCK‐1, which mediates the actions of myosin and
  determines the direction of MSC differentiation.
