caption: BF-induced M2-type macrophages in the auto-inflammatory response associated
  to BP. Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against
  two proteins of the hemidesmosome structure, BP180 and BP230. The binding of BP
  autoantibodies ① onto their target initiates the activation of the complement pathway
  ② which then provokes the release of chemokines and cytokines by mast cells ③. These
  pro-inflammatory molecules trigger subsequent recruitment of inflammatory cells
  at the dermal-epidermal junction ④. Inflammatory key mediators secreted by these
  latter cells induce an overexpression of proteases, such as the matrix-metalloproteinases-9
  (MMP9) and the neutrophil elastase, which are involved in extracellular matrix (ECM)
  degradation and blister formation ⑤. We here further demonstrated the ability of
  blister fluid to induce M2-type macrophages at site of skin lesion by increasing
  CD163, CD206, and IL-10 expression. BF-induced M2-type macrophages also show pro-inflammatory
  function by releasing MMP-9 and then participating to pathophysiological process
  of BP. Under corticotherapy the auto-amplification process associated to pro-inflammatory
  cell interaction is dismantled. Indeed, steps ③, ④, and ⑤ are inhibited. In addition,
  we showed that inhibition of MMP-9 production by methylprednisolone was not associated
  with a switch toward a M1 macrophage phenotype, but instead reinforced their M2-type
  phenotype promoting tissue regeneration and repair.
