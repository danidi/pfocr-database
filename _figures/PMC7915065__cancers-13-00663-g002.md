caption: Key mechanisms underlying resistance to PD-L1 (1). The transcription factor
  Yin Yang 1 (YY1)-induced upregulation of PD-L1 expression triggers NOD-, LRR- and
  pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome to promote tumor Wnt5α expression
  via HSP70-TLR4 signaling, and non-canonical WNT ligands activate the YAP pathway
  to induce chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) ligands, while granulocytic
  subset of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) relied on CXCR2 to suppress
  T-cell function. (2) Loss-of-function mutations in JAK1/2 leads to the paucity of
  PD-L1 expression. (3) Tumor-suppressing microenvironment. Tumor-associated macrophages
  (TAMs) promote tumor progression, while Indole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) generated by
  tumors enhances Tregs and MDSCs activity, which suppress immunity. (4) Activation
  of alternative immune checkpoints. T-cell immunoglobulin mucin 3 (TIM-3) and Lymphocyte
  activation gene-3 (LAG-3) produced by T-cells impair generation of IFN-γ, which
  activates T-cells. CTLA-4 demonstrates a higher affinity and avidity in conjunction
  with CD80 and CD86 than CD28 to antagonize costimulation. VISTA is found to be related
  to MDSC mainly derived CD33 expression and HHLA2 decreases T-cell proliferation.
