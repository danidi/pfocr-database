caption: A hypothetical network based on differentially expressed transcription factors
  and DEmiRNAs. Molecular interactions obtained from protein-protein interactions,
  KEGG pathway interactions, putative transcriptional regulatory interactions derived
  from 1423 DEGs, and predicted DEmiRNA and DETF interactions were combined. (A).
  The network containing 689 nodes composed of 22 DETFs (open squares), 618 DEGs (filled
  circles) and 49 DEmiRNAs (filled triangles) and 1391 non-redundant interactions
  was generated. The network can be grouped into 7 modules (as indicated) based on
  the connectivity of nodes - the more interacted nodes are grouped together. (B)
  This figure displays only the network consisting of the DETF (with known binding
  sites) and their cognate DEmiRNAs. The transcription factors, which do not have
  well characterized binding site information were not used in prediction of interactions,
  and are shown as open circles.

  description: A hypothetical network based on differentially expressed transcription
    factors and DEmiRNAs. Molecular interactions obtained from protein-protein interactions,
    KEGG pathway interactions, putative transcriptional regulatory interactions derived
    from 1423 DEGs, and predicted DEmiRNA and DETF interactions were combined. (A).
    The network containing 689 nodes composed of 22 DETFs (open squares), 618 DEGs
    (filled circles) and 49 DEmiRNAs (filled triangles) and 1391 non-redundant interactions
    was generated. The network can be grouped into 7 modules (as indicated) based
    on the connectivity of nodes - the more interacted nodes are grouped together.
    (B) This figure displays only the network consisting of the DETF (with known binding
    sites) and their cognate DEmiRNAs. The transcription factors, which do not have
    well characterized binding site information were not used in prediction of interactions,
