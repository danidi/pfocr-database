caption: Hypothetical pathway of MIF-2/D-DT-dependent mechanisms in proximal tubule
  cell regeneration. Our study shows that MIF-2/D-DT treatment enhances expression
  of its receptors Cd74 and Cd44 in kidney tubular epithelial cells following I/R
  injury. Moreover, MIF-2/D-DT treatment rapidly (within 1–3 h) activates the transcription
  factors eIF2α and ATF4, which stimulate cell regeneration through autophagy and
  the unfolded protein response (UPR). A long-term effect of MIF-2/D-DT treatment
  (24–36 h) is the stimulation of cell proliferation through SLPI-dependent activation
  of cyclin D1 and D2. AS, asparagine synthetase.
