caption: Model of the functional role of parkin. Under physiological conditions, parkin
  promotes regulatory ubiquitylation of TRAF2 and IKKγ during stress, leading to the
  activation of NF-κB. As a consequence, transcription of prosurvival genes is upregulated.
  The activity of parkin can be modulated by stress. Under moderate stress, parkin
  is upregulated. For an immediate response, it is conceivable that parkin activity
  can be regulated by posttranslational modifications. In contrast, severe proteotoxic
  stress, for example induced by oxidized dopamine, causes misfolding and thus inactivation
  of parkin. Mutations in the parkin gene linked to familial PD also interfere with
  the capacity of parkin to stimulate the IKK/NF-κB signaling pathway.
