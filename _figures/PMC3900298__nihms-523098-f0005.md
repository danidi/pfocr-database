caption: 'Shh is responsible for the proliferation and regeneration of neural precursor
  cells. The G-protein-coupled receptors (including both patched and smoothened) activate
  Shh signaling to occur. Gli-1, Gli-2 and Gli-3 are a family of transcriptional activators,
  and are thought to be located downstream of the smoothened pathway. TRPV1 is responsible
  for regulating and detecting body temperature.Shh: Sonic Hedgehog.'
