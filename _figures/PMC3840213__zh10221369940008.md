caption: Graphic summary of factors regulating β-cell proliferation and size as a
  function of pancreas developmental stages. At E13.5, PRLR is already expressed in
  fully differentiated β-cells and only activated by placental lactogen hormones (PL),
  since PRL levels are undetectable at this stage. However, PRL exposure stimulates
  embryonic pancreatic rudiment growth and β-cell proliferation (). PRLR activation
  leads to stimulation of insulin growth factor II (Igf2) expression, notably before
  birth, and presumably its secretion. At E18.5, PRLR is strongly activated by both
  PL and PRL inducing at least through S6K pathway (). Drastic IGF-II production was
  observed, which may act in an autocrine/paracrine manner through IGF receptor (IGF-R)
  signaling. Other sources of IGF-II could also account for enhanced β-cell proliferation
  (see ) and increased β-cell size (see ). After birth (D6.5), IGF-II was almost undetectable;
  PRL alone induces other target genes, whereas proliferation rate is largely reduced.
  Even though a second wave of β-cell proliferation will take place later (D20) in
  rodents.
