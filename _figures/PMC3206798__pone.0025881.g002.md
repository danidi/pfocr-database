number: Figure 2
caption: 'Schematic representation of the flux of selected metabolic reactions and
  pathways at different proliferation rates, in cells utilizing glycolysis with net
  zero ATP production. The individual panels show the rate of the indicated reactions
  (vertical axis, in units of mM/min = mmol/min/L) as a function of the proliferation
  rate (horizontal axis, in units of 1/day). The gray shadow background contains reactions
  taking place in the mitochondria. Note, that the predicted metabolic switch is lost
  if the molecular crowding constraint is removed from the model (see ). Abbreviations:
  metabolite import/export (Ex metabolite: glc = glucose, gln = glutamine, Ala-L = L-alanine,
  phe-L = L-phenylalanine, ile-L = isoleucine, lys-L = L-lysine, val-L = L-valine,
  lac-L = L-lactate), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), pyruvate kinase (PK), phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase (PGCD), L-alanine transaminase (ALATA-L), malic enzyme (ME), malate
  dehydrogenase (MDH), pyruvate carboxylase (PC), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), citrate
  synthase (CS), α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (AKGD).'
