caption: Clock and mTOR pathway interconnection. (A) Environmental cues such as light
  synchronizes the master clock in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) while feeding regimen
  entrains the peripheral and metabolic clock. Further, peripheral and SCN clocks
  directly cross-talk with the metabolic clock, i.e., PI3K/Akt/mTOR. (B) mTORC1, through
  4-EBP1 phosphorylation, regulates the SCN clock. In the periphery, a feedback loop
  is formed in which mTORC1 regulates BMAL1 activity through S6K1 mediated phosphorylation,
  while BMAL1 accumulation, in turn, inhibits mTOR activity. Constitutive mTORC1 activation
  for example, by Tsc2 inhibition, disturbs this feedback loop that could, in turn,
  drive uncontrolled protein synthesis, cellular growth and proliferation, thus, contributing
  to cancer development.
