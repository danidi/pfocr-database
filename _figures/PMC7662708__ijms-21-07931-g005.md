caption: Kynurenine Induces Osteoclastogenesis Via the AhR Signaling Pathway. In the
  presence of RANKL, KYN induces Raw 264.7 cells to undergo osteoclastogenesis. This
  is mediated by KYN binding to AhR which translocates to the nucleus. Based on the
  literature the ligand bound to AhR forms a transcription factor complex with ARNT
  []. This complex binds to the Xenobiotic responsive elements in the promotor regions
  of target genes, which here include c-fos, NFATc1 and CYP1B1 [,,,]. The down-stream
  consequence is osteoclast differentiation and activation of osteoclast bone resorption.
  These effects can be blocked by pharmacologic inhibition of AhR with the DMF, or
  genetic inhibition with AhR siRNA. This suggests that inhibiting KYN levels, blocking
  KYN binding of AhR, or blocking KYN/AhR signaling may be potential therapeutic approaches
  to limit the role of osteoclast activity in age-associated bone loss or osteoporosis.
