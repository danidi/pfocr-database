caption: Dual role of LILRB4 during tumorigenesis. LILRB4 has dual effects in cancer.
  On the one hand, immune cells escape from tumor cells by affecting the activity
  of antigen-presenting cells; on the other hand, LILRB4 expression is upregulated
  under the action of the lymphocyte antigen receptor signal inhibitor Deltex1. A
  large amount of LILRB4 interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate 5-phosphatase
  1 on the cell surface to inhibit the activity of Akt kinase. Decreased Akt kinase
  activity affects the downstream Akt pathway, which in turn inhibits tumor invasion.
