caption: The Hippo signalling core cassette in mammals. In response to upstream signals
  (coming from GPCRs and other plasma membrane associated factors), MST1/2 are activated
  by phosphorylation. Phosphorylated MST1/2 in complex with the scaffolding protein
  SAV then activates LATS1/2 kinases by phosphorylation. Activated LATS1/2, associated
  with their co-activator MOB1, hyperphosphorylate YAP/TAZ on different sites. These
  YAP/TAZ phosphorylation events create a 14-3-3 binding site that causes the cytoplasmic
  retention of YAP/TAZ (mediated by Ser127 phosphorylation of YAP) and a separate
  phospho-degron that mediates the proteasomal degradation of YAP/TAZ (mediated by
  Ser381 phosphorylation of YAP). When the Hippo pathway is inactive, YAP/TAZ are
  not phosphorylated by LATS1/2 allowing the transcriptional co-activators YAP/TAZ
  to accumulate in the nucleus which can result in the transcription of specific target
  genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and differentiation control. Of note, the
  MST1/2-LATS1/2-YAP/TAZ axis can also be influenced by additional factors (depicted
  as X) on each individual signalling level.
