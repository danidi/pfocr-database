caption: Neurotrophin signalling. This depicts the interactions of each neurotrophin
  with Trk and p75NTR receptors and major intracellular signalling pathways activated
  through each receptor. The p75NTR receptor regulates three major signalling pathways.
  NF-κB activation results in transcription of multiple genes, including several that
  promote neuronal survival. Activation of the Jun kinase pathway similarly controls
  activation of several genes, some of which promote neuronal apoptosis. Ligand engagement
  of p75NTR also regulates the activity of Rho, which controls growth cone motility.
  Pro-apoptosis actions of p75NTR appear to require the presence of sortilin, which
  functions as a co-receptor for the neurotrophins. Sortilin is not depicted in this
  figure, but is described in the text. Each Trk receptor also controls three major
  signalling pathways. Activation of Ras results in activation of the MAP kinase-signalling
  cascade, which promotes neuronal differentiation including neurite outgrowth. Activation
  of PI3 kinase through Ras or Gab1 promotes survival and growth of neurons and other
  cells. Activation of PLC-γ1 results in activation of Ca2+- and protein kinase C-regulated
  pathways that promote synaptic plasticity. Each of these signalling pathways also
  regulates gene transcription. Many additional adaptors for p75NTR and Trk receptors
  have been identified which are not depicted in this figure for simplicity, but are
  described in more detail in the text. Interactions between p75NTR and Trk receptors
  are not depicted in this figure, but are described in the text. p75NTR also appears
  to function as constituent of other receptor complexes, most notably the Nogo receptor
  complex. These interactions and signalling pathways are not depicted here.
