caption: 'Production of 6-deoxyeritronolide B in E. coli. Key metabolites and cofactors
  are shown. E. coli’s native metabolism is shown in black. Engineered propionate
  assimilation pathway is shown in green. The Wood Werkman cycle is shown in red.
  6-dEB synthesis is shown in blue. The main genes involved in the pathways sourcing
  precursors propionyl-CoA and S-methylmalonyl-CoA are shown. Under anaerobic conditions,
  the reactions shown in dashed lines occur in the reverse direction as indicated.
  Propionate assimilation occurs through a propionyl-CoA synthetase (prpE). Propionyl-CoA
  carboxylase (ppc). Mutase-epimerase pathway from p. shermanii (mut, mce). The wood
  Werkman cycle from p. acidipropionici: methylmalomnyl-CoA carboxyltransferase (mtc);
  propionyl-CoA:succinate transferase (pst); methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mut); methylmalonyl-CoA
  epimerase (mce). GLC, glucose. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate. PYR, pyruvate. LAC, lactate.
  ACECOA, acetyl-CoA. ETOH, ethanol. FOR, formate. ACE, acetate. OAA, oxaloacetate.
  ISOCIT, isocitrate. A-KETOGLU, α-ketoglutarate. MAL, malate. FUM, fumarate. SUCC,
  succinate. SUCCOA, succinyl-CoA. MMCOA-R, methylmalonyl-CoA (R). MMCOA-S, methylmalonyl-CoA
  (S). PROCOA, propionyl-CoA. PROP, propionate. 6DEB, 6-deoxyeritronolide B. Reactions
  are not balanced.'
