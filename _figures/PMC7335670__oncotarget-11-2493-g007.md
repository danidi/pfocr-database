caption: 'Balanced phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycling and dynamic localization
  normally couples centrosome size and division. Right: chronically unphosphorylated
  IQGAP1(dominant negative), activates a novel rewired Erk-Mnk1-JNK-Akt1-β-catenin
  signaling pathway and displaces IQGAP1 (red) from the nuclear envelope, thereby
  diminishing centrosome-nuclear transport- via nuclear pore complex (NPC)- known
  to be required for centrosome division [], leading to enlarged centrosome. These
  events alter BRCA1 centrosome-nuclear distribution, causing cytosolic aggregates
  seen in certain variants of TNBC and other cancers. Left: Chronically phosphorylated
  IQGAP1 (dominant active) activates Mnk1, suppresses β-catenin expression and nuclear
  translocation, enhances centrosome-nuclear transport, thereby leading to centrosome
  amplification seen in certain variants of TNBC and other cancers. Accordingly, IQGAP1
  generates cancers by, at least, two context-dependent pathways and can serve as
  a common therapeutic target or biomarker in heterogenous cancers like TNBC.'
