caption: Administration of pamidronate after burn injury through preventing bone resorption
  hypothetically reduces the release of the TGFβ family members from the bone. The
  reduction of TGFβ family members seems to be responsible for the partial rescue
  of myotube atrophy. This signaling appears to be due to the reactivation of the
  anabolic AKT/mTOR pathway and the reduction of the catabolic ubiquitin-dependent
  pathway.
