caption: The environmental and genetic factors that may explain the health disparity
  between Caucasian American and Asian American breast cancer and a potential link
  between obesity and breast cancer risk. (1) Unhealthy diets cause higher AA (arachidonic
  acid) content in the body, which cause the activation or up-regulation of several
  pathways including AA metabolism, VEGF signaling, and PPAR signaling, which are
  related to cancer development and migration. (2) Known genetic variants in CYPs
  may cause the differential expression of these genes and different metabolic patterns
  of AA, which, in turn affect AA content and AA metabolism pathway. (3) A PPARγ variant
  exists in Chinese population that is associated with severe obesity. The variant
  may also exist in people in western countries. The variant may cause the differential
  regulation of PPAR signaling pathway in the two race groups. (4) Both estrogen production
  and metabolism are important for breast cancer risk and genetic differences between
  AS and CA population may affect the estrogen metabolism, which in turn, may have
  affected their breast cancer incidence rate.
