caption: 'DHA inhibits VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration, which plays a role
  in angiogenesis and wound repair. The effects of DHA on wound repair and angiogenesis
  are due, at least in part, to a reduction in cell migration. DHA reduces VEGF-induced
  cell migration mediated by FFAR4 and the PP2A/ERK1/2/eNOS signaling pathway. Abbreviations:
  DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; FFAR4, Free fatty acid receptor 4; PP2A, protein phosphatase
  2A; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; eNOS, eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase; NO, nitric oxide'
