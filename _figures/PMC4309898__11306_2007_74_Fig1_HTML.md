caption: Schematic overview of flavonoid pathway engineering in tomato. Solid black
  arrows represent the active pathway in tomato fruit peel. Anthocyanin production
  is occasionally found in vegetative tissues (dotted arrow). Increased flavonol biosynthesis
  was obtained by upregulating the pathway in fruit flesh using the transcription
  factor genes Lc and C1, or by relieving the block in the pathway in fruit peel using
  the petunia CHI gene (blue arrows). An RNAi approach was used to block specific
  steps in the pathway (red crosses). Newly introduced flavonoid branches are depicted
  in green
