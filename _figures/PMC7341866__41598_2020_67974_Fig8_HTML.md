caption: Metabolic pathway for the synthesis of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and
  glutamate/glutamine shuttle in neurons. Succinic semi-aldehyde (SSA) is formed in
  the mitochondria by GABA-transaminase (GABA-T). SSA can either be oxidized to succinate
  by succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) in the mitochondria or transported
  to the cytosol where it is reduced to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by succinic
  semialdehyde reductase (SSR). Glutamate can form GABA by glutamate decarboxylase
  (GAD). Glutamine is broken down to glutamate under the action of glutaminase. Glutamate
  is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase (GS). In the low dose tramadol
  group, the content of SSA was down regulated and the content of GHB was up regulated.
  In the high dose tramadol group, the content of glutamine was down regulated and
  the content of GHB was up regulated.
