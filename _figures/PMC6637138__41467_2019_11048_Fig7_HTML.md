caption: Model of innate immune response activation in BRCA2-deficient cells. Intrinsic
  replication stress and unrepaired DSBs cause genomic instability leading to release
  of DNA into the cytosol. Cytosolic DNA assembles into micronuclei, where it binds
  to and activates cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), a cytosolic DNA sensor. cGAS catalyzes
  the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), which binds to and activates STING (stimulator
  of interferon genes). STING promotes TBK1-dependent phosphorylation of interferon
  response factor 3 (IRF3), which translocates into the nucleus as a homodimer to
  induce transcription of type I interferon. Secreted interferon binds to transmembrane
  receptors and elicits autocrine and paracrine signaling, both mediated by the JAK-STAT
  pathway. Janus kinases (JAKs) phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcription
  1 (STAT1) and 2 (STAT2), which enter the nucleus as a heterodimer to initiate transcription
  of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ER, endoplasmic reticulum
