caption: In the canonical pathway, miRNA precursors transcribed from exonic, intronic,
  or intergenic sequences are recognized by the RNA-binding protein DGCR8 and cleaved
  by the RNase III Drosha. This cleavage generates a 55- to 70-nt pre-miRNA hairpin
  that is exported to the cytoplasm, where it undergoes a second cleavage by the RNase
  III enzyme Dicer that removes the terminal loop. The miRNA duplex is then loaded
  into the RISC complex containing Ago2 in mammals. Some miRNAs derive from mirtron
  loci, which produce short intronic hairpins that are excised by the splicing machinery.
  Mirtron intermediates are then linearized by the lariat-debranching enzyme and exported
  to the cytoplasm where they are further processed by Dicer. Some mirtrons are produced
  with extended 5’ or 3’ end regions (“tailed mirtrons”) and trimmed before their
  export and cleavage by Dicer. In the case of miR-451, processing of the primary
  transcript by Drosha releases an unusually short hairpin that cannot be cleaved.
  Instead, it is directly loaded onto the RISC complex and cleaved by Ago2 to release
  a 30-nt-long precursor that is likely processed and trimmed by Poly(A)-specific
  ribonuclease (PARN) to produce mature miR-451.
