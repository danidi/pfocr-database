caption: Effect of WNT signaling on cancer immunosurveillance. (i) Activation of the
  WNT/β-catenin pathway in cancer cells inhibits the secretion of CCL4 and recruits
  BATF3-dependent DCs to the TME. This causes a decrease in DC-derived CXCL10 levels
  and limits CD8+ CTL infiltration, leading to defective cross-priming. WNT ligands
  released by cancer cells can induce the canonical WNT signaling pathway in DCs,
  leading to the increased secretion of IL-10, restricted production of IL-12, and
  up-regulation of indoleamine IDO1. This contributes to the production of Treg cells
  and the subsequent inhibition of CTL activity. The inhibition of GSK3 in cancer
  cells promotes β-catenin activation and subsequently stabilizes PD-L1, which drives
  CTL exhaustion upon interactions with PD-1. Canonical WNT/β-catenin in MDSCs inhibits
  their ability to accumulate and infiltrate into malignant lesions, leading to the
  increased recruitment of CTLs. (ii) DKK1 secreted by latent metastatic cells prevents
  NK cell-dependent cancer cell lysis, which is caused by the low expression of NKALs,
  which engage NKARs. GSK3 inhibition and β-catenin overexpression in NK cells lead
  to the up-regulation of transcription factors responsible for NK cell maturation,
  thereby stimulating the function of NK cells as effectors. (iii) Although the expression
  of β-catenin is beneficial for the survival of Treg cells in vitro, the activation
  of TCF-1, downstream of canonical WNT signaling, blocks Foxp3 transcriptional functions
  and impairs the immunosuppressive activity of Treg cells. CTL, cytotoxic T cell;
