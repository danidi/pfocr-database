caption: 'CTLA-4 can act intrinsically on the T cell that expresses it. Proposed intrinsic
  pathways may involve downstream inhibitory pathways or competitive inhibition of
  the positive pathway mediated by CD28. Alternatively, CTLA-4 may act via involvement
  of other cells, such as APCs, or processes outside of the T cell that expresses
  it. Extrinsic pathways include inhibitory cytokine release by immune cells. There
  are multiple theories on how CTLA-4 aids in extrinsic sequestration of the B7 ligand,
  thereby preventing its positive function. Data presented at the AACR Tumor Immunology:
  Multidisciplinary Science Driving Basic and Clinical Advances meeting in Miami last
  week. Recent data (unpublished) from Allison’s lab suggests that anti-CTLA4 antibodies
  may also deplete intratumoral T-regs by antibody dependant cellular cytotoxicity.'
