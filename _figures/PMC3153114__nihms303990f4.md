caption: Schematic depiction of the metabolic pathway followed by exogenous lactate
  once it crosses the blood brain barrier. Lactate is primarily taken up by neurons
  through the high-affinity isoform monocarboxylate-2 transporter (MCT-2), predominantly
  localized at the synapses (thick arrow). The isoform MCT-4, mainly found on astrocytic
  end-feet, has a lower affinity for lactate (thin arrow). Once in the cytosol of
  neurons, lactate is transported into the mitochondrial matrix by a monocarboxylate
  (MCT) transporter. Lactate is converted into pyruvate by mitochondrial lactate-dehydrogenase
  (LDH, isoforms 1 or 3), an enzyme that does not require the coenzyme NAD+. LDH 1–3
  is the first enzyme of the mitochondrial oxidative pathway and supplies pyruvate
  to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Eventually lactate oxidization will yield
  up to 18 ATPs per molecule.
