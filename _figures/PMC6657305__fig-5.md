caption: 'Noncanonical functions of NAD(P)-dependent dehydrogenases. Several pathophysiological
  conditions can manifest neomorphic enzyme activities from NAD(H)- and NADP(H)-dependent
  dehydrogenases such as those found in the Krebs'' cycle. (A) Normal (canonical)
  function of dehydrogenases: MDH oxidizes malate to OAA, reducing NAD+ to NADH. LDH
  reduces pyruvate to lactate, oxidizing NADH to NAD+. IDH isoforms 1 and 2 decarboxylate
  isocitrate to α-KG in an NADP+ dependent manner, whereas IDH isoform 3 performs
  the same reaction in an NAD+-dependent manner. (B) Under conditions of hypoxia and/or
  acidosis, both MDH and LDH can use NADH to reduce α-KG to the l-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate
  (l-2-HG). In addition, IDH 1/2 can operate in reverse, using NADPH to perform reductive
  carboxylation of α-KG to form isocitrate. The latter is an important biosynthetic
  pathway in cancer cells, using α-KG derived from the amino acids glutamine or glutamate,
  to fuel fatty acid synthesis for biomembranes. (C) Mutations in IDH 1/2 are associated
  with aggressive forms of cancer such as glioma and result in a neomorphic activity,
  that is, the ability to use NADPH to reduce α-KG to the d-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate
  (d-2-HG). For this reason, d-2-HG is commonly referred to as an “oncometabolite.”
