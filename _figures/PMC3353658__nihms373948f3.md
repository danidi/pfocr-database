caption: ER stress induces Grp78 transcription, resulting in upregulation of GRP78
  and GRP78va, the latter is generated by alternative splicing. In the ER lumen, GRP78,
  in association with P58IPK and other co-chaperones, enhances protein folding and
  degradation of misfolded proteins (ERAD). Release of GRP78 from PERK, IRE1 and ATF6
  induces the UPR signaling. PERK activation leads to eIF2α phosphorylation and translation
  attenuation, contributing to cell survival. In the cytosol, GRP78va enforces PERK
  signaling by inactivation of the cytosolic P58IPK.
