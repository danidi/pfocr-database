caption: The MAP3K1 gene mutation causes increased phosphorylation of the downstream
  MAP kinase pathway targets–MAPK11, MAP3K and MAPK1, thereby promoting phosphorylation
  of ERR1/2 and p38 and ultimately leading to 46, XY DSD. Increased phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 and p38 may result in decreased expression of SOX9 and increased activity
  of β-catenin, respectively, which are important signaling molecules in testicular
  and ovarian-promoting pathways.
