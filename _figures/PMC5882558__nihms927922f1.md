caption: Metabolic enzymes linked to Pol III and Maf1 in yeast. A Entry of glycerol
  into the glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathway. Double headed arrows indicate reversible
  reactions. Pairs of arrows indicate irreversible steps for which separate enzymes
  are required. Gluconeogenic enzymes discussed in the text are shown in red, aldolase
  is shown in green. The red asterisks highlight the positive allosteric regulation
  of pyruvate kinase by fructose 1,6, bisphosphate. Key functions of sugars in the
  upper part of the pathway are indicated as discussed in the text. B Top view of
  the Pol III elongating complex []. The boxed region, enlarged below, shows the position
  of the rpc128-1007 mutation in green and residues containing atoms within 5 Å. These
  include atoms from three amino acids at the interface with AC40 in magenta and Rpc128
  amino acids spanning residues 1005–1010 and 929–933 in dark blue. C A hypothetical
  scheme suggests that when glucose and F-1,6-P levels are high, binding of the latter
  to Fba1 (aldolase) in complex with Pol III may promote transcription.
