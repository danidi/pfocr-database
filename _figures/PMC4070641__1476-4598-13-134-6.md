caption: Schematic model for the mechanism of RPN2-mediated CD63/MDR1 glycosylation
  pathway in breast cancer cells. In breast cancer cells, high expression of RPN2
  resulted in increased glycosylation of CD63/MDR1 and enhanced membrane localization
  of CD63/MDR1, which promoted cancer malignancy. In contrast, inhibition of RPN2
  expression reduced glycosylation of CD63/MDR1 and decreased membrane localization,
  thereby attenuating cancer malignancy in breast cancer cells.
