caption: Stable building blocks were synthesized to afford RvD4. (A) The C1-C9 fragment
  was prepared in nine steps from D-ribose. C14-C22 was accomplished in seven steps
  and coupled by Sonogashira conditions with C10-C13, synthesized in three steps from
  commercially available starting material 3-Butyn-1-ol. Sonogashira coupling of precursor
  C10-C22 with C1-C9 followed by Boland reduction and base hydrolysis afforded RvD4.
  (B) The biosynthetic pathway of Resolvin D4 involves subsequent enzymatic transformations
  to a 4,5-epoxide intermediate in a stereo-controlled biosynthesis [, ] to afford
  the potent pro-resolving mediator RvD4. The conversion pathway by oxidoreductase
  yields the 17-oxo-RvD4 further metabolite.
