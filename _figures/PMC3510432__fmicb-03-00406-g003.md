number: Figure 3
caption: HTLV-1 Tax subcellular localization. HTLV-1 Tax undergoes extensive post-translational
  modifications that regulate Tax trafficking through the cytoplasm and nucleus, binding
  partners, and consequently its function. The figure shows Tax translocation from
  nucleus to cytoplasm through a sumoylation/ubiquitination cycle. Cytoplasmic ubiquitinated
  Tax activates several signal transduction pathways and can be found in association
  with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and microtubule organizing
  center (MTOC). Additionally, cytoplasmic Tax can be secreted by extracellular shuttling.
  De-ubiquitinated Tax migrates to the nucleus where it is sumoylated and acetylated,
  resulting in assembly to nuclear bodies. Nuclear Tax can be involved in a number
  of processes, including interactions with nuclear proteins, incorporation into nuclear
  bodies as foci for high transcriptional activity, being targeted for proteasomal
  degradation, as well as actively being translocated into the cytoplasm via CRM1
  pathway or other pathways that need yet to be defined (STAMBPL1). Lysine 48 and
  63 ubiquitin branching is denoted as Ub-K48 and Ub-K63 respectively, while monoubiquitination
  at lysines 280 or 284 is indicated as K284/K280-Ub.
