caption: Summary of the strategies for engineering the regulatory networks to enhance
  lycopene production in E. coli. (1) Acetyl phosphate (ACP), as an indicator of glucose
  flux, was set as a signal of the two-component regulon Ntr, to regulate the expression
  of idi and pps for lycopene biosynthesis. (2) Transcriptional engineering on the
  global regulator cAMP receptor protein (CRP) was conducted by using error-prone
  PCR and site-directed mutagenesis, to subtly balancing the whole metabolic pathway
  networks for improving the lycopene yield. (3) RpoS regulates the transcription
  of genes induced at the stationary phase and energy metabolism. (4) Crl regulated
  the expression of csgBA for curli surface fiber formation to promote the accumulation
  of lycopene in cells. (5) Genomic integration of related genes made the expression
  stable and controlled the expression intensity by gene copy number. (6) The AppY
  transcriptional regulator was relative to anaerobic energy metabolism.
