caption: The hypothesis of a therapy using mTOR inhibitors (Everolimus) in COVID-19.
  The critical phases of COVID-19 show pathophysiological aspects resembling a sort
  of immune response hypersensitivity, mediated by exacerbated immune mechanism and
  cytokine storm. mTOR inhibition (i.e., by Everolimus) could act in reducing SARS-CoV2
  replication (A), in inhibiting the cytokine storm dependent on the hyper-activated-STAT3
  pathway (B), in contrasting Treg down-regulation, and in reducing conventional hyper-reactive
  T cells (C) in COVID-19. Current step-use of Tocilizumab, Hydrochloroquine, Heparin,
  and Steroids is reported in the figure.
