caption: Model showing the effect of miR-182-5p on the DNA repair pathway. When a
  cell undergoes double-strand breaks (DSB), “sensor” genes activate a signaling cascade
  including transducer and effector genes that leads to an efficient repair of the
  DNA damage. Under this model, miR-182-5p-mediated deregulation of the DNA damage
  response pathway (orange) typically results in impaired DNA repair with subsequent
  effects on the cell cycle, apoptosis, or genetic stability leading to tumorigenesis.
  We have also highlighted previously validated and novel targets that we have mechanistically
  shown to interact with miR-182-5p, belonging to the DNA damage response pathway.
