caption: (A) Sec14p pathway. Individual roles for PC, DAG, PA, PI-4-P, and PI-4,5-P2
  in stimulating yeast Golgi secretory function have been proposed. PC-bound Sec14p
  down-regulates flux through the DAG-utilizing CDP-choline pathway for PC biosynthesis,
  whereas PI-bound Sec14p stimulates PI-4-P synthesis. PI-4-P is a precursor for PI-4,5-P2,
  which is an obligate cofactor for PLD activity. PLD hydrolyzes PC to PA and choline.
  PA is dephosphorylated to DAG. The execution points for gene products whose inactivation
  effects bypass Sec14p (i.e., Cki1p, Pct1p, and Sac1p) are shown. How Kes1p antagonizes
  activity of the Sec14p pathway is unclear. (B) Yeast ARFGAP- and ARFGAP-like proteins.
  Gcs1p domains are aligned with those of homologous yeast proteins. ARFGAP catalytic
  (CAT) domains, or domains homologous to them, are in black. The putative PH domains
  of Gcs1p, Age2p, and Age1p (Sat1p in ) are hatched. Gcs1p residue 228 marks the
  beginning of the Gcs1p PH domain. Residue 196 marks the beginning of the Age2p PH
  domain.
