number: Fig. 2
caption: 'An overview of carbon metabolism with enzymes affected by methotrexate.
  MTX can be seen inhibiting many enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. The enzymes
  inhibited in this figure are all dehydrogenase enzymes and involved in reduction
  of NAD +/NADP + to NADH/NADPH. These reduced compounds are involved in multiple
  cellular reactions, the regeneration of reduced glutathione being one of them. Also
  seen in this figure is the incorporation of asparagine and glutamine as carbon sources
  for the production of TCA cycle intermediates.Legend: NAD +, nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide; NADP +, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADH, reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADPH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; star-shape indicates reaction of multiple reactants and products with
  various intermediates. Dashed lines indicate a metabolite is present in two locations
  along the metabolic pathway. Bold lines indicate an irreversible reaction.'
