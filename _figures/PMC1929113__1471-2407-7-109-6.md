caption: 'Upregulation of cyclins and CDKs in melanoma cells. Part of KEGG cell cycle
  pathway is shown on top with a focus on cyclins and CDKs and their associated PET
  counts. Two solid squares are added to each active ''gene box'' (green) for accessing
  PET data related to gene isoforms: the left square links to the Melan-a2 melanocyte
  library (SMN001_36623nr2), while the right square links to the B16F1 melanoma library
  (SMT001_32267nr2). The degree of PET-to-gene isoform matching is indicated by different
  colors: blue, no match at all; yellow, partially matched; and red, all isoforms
  matched (by PETs). Boxes in the lower portion show PET counts for the gene isoforms
  of each pair of cyclin (top) and CDK (bottom). PET counts have been normalized to
  cpm (counts per million).'
