caption: Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) and Toll-IL-1 receptor
  domain–containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF) are 2 major mediators of
  Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling that cooperate in promoting innate immune responses.
  Engagement of TLR2 by Pam3CSK4 or lipoteichoic acid (LTA) initiates the MyD88-dependent
  pathway resulting in the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines via the induction
  (black lines) of nuclear factor (NF)–κB. Stimulation of TLR3 by Poly(I:C) induces
  the recruitment of TRIF, which in turn triggers expression of interferon (IFN)–β
  by activating interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a substrate of c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase 1 (JNK1). Engagement of TLR4 by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers both MyD88-dependent
  and TRIF-dependent signaling. Both TLR3 and TLR4, but not TLR2, initiate an IFN-β-positive
  feedback loop that amplifies the initial response through the IFNAR–signal transducers
  and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling axis. The differentiation of
  M2 monocytes occurred independently of MyD88 and phosphorylation and degradation
  of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα. In contrast, TRIF-dependent TLR signaling was negatively
  regulated in M2 monocytes. Phosphorylation of JNK1 and p38 MAPK and subsequent nuclear
  translocation (DNA binding) of IRF3 and ATF-2, 2 components of the IFN-β enhanceosome,
  were inhibited. GA-mediated M2 monocyte differentiation is associated with inhibition
  of STAT1 phosphorylation. Copyright Xavier Studio, reprinted with permission.
