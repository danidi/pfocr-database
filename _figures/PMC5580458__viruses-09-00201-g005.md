caption: Proposed model for the role of autophagy in HIV-induced pathology and HIV-induced
  metabolic dysfunction in astrocytes in the context of opioid abuse. Green arrows
  indicate an induction, red arrows indicate a reduction, and blue equal symbols indicate
  no significant role of the respective molecules. Blocking the autophagy pathway
  with siBeclin1 significantly decreased HIV and morphine-induced intracellular calcium
  release and glutamate uptake with minimal changes in RNS and ROS production. Silencing
  with siBeclin1 significantly decreased HIV production and HIV and morphine-induced
  cytokines and chemokine secretion. On the contrary, increasing autophagy with rapamycin
  significantly increased HIV and morphine-induced intracellular calcium release,
  restored glutamate uptake and showed minimal decrease in RNS and ROS production.
  Rapamycin increased HIV replication, and HIV and morphine-induced TNF-α and IL-8
  release. These effects correlate with the modulation of the NF-κB pathway by the
  autophagy pathway.
