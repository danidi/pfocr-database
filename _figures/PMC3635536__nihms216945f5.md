caption: More than 80 SNPs within the Erb4/NRG1 receptor/ligand pair have been associated
  with schizophrenia. All NRG1 isoforms signal through an EGF domain, either through
  paracrine, juxtacrine, or autocrine mechanisms. ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 form dimers
  and heterodimers, which signal through multiple pathways. Classical signals are
  transduced through the Grb2 and Shc adaptor molecules and the Raf–MEK–ERK, or JUN
  kinase cascade to activate transcription factors such as GABP, SRF, and c-jun. Also
  activated are the PI3K, AKT, mTOR pathway. Brain-specific receptor-type proteintyrosine
  phosphatase, RPTP-beta, modulates ErbB4 signals through an interaction with MAGI
  proteins. Additionally, ErbB4 colocalizes with PSD95 and may modulate NMDA, AMPA,
  and metabotropic glutamate receptor function. The non-cannonical ErbB signals are
  transmitted by a cleaved ErbB intracellular domain (EICD), which translocates to
  the nucleus and interacts with nuclear transcription factors. Three ErbB signaling
  pathways overlap with the disrupted in Schizophrenia 1, DISC1, interactome, namely,
  AKT-mTOR, EICD, and PSD95 mediated signals.
