caption: Proposed signalling interactions between C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP)
  and mechanical loading in chondrocytes. CNP primarily activates natriuretic peptide
  (Npr)2 which underlies guanylyl cyclase (GC) activity and mediates several cell-signalling
  effects through the synthesis of 3,5-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and membrane-bound
  cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase II (PKGII). It has been reported that the Gi/o
  binding domain in Npr3 activates extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK
  1/2) or the phospholipase C (PLC) and inosital triphosphate (IP3) pathway via adenylate
  cyclase/cAMP inhibition. PLC activation and IP3 generation is well known to contribute
  to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. This pathway supports cartilage homeostasis
  by mediating the anabolic effects involved in mechanotransduction. Furthermore,
  mechanical signals stimulate Npr expression and CNP levels, which mediates anabolic
  effects involving extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis. In contrast, IL-1β stimulates
  catabolic activities via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitric oxide
  (NO)/sGC/cGMP levels. The IL-1β-induced catabolic response could be inhibited by
  mechanosensitive CNP or Ca2+ release through stretch-activated ion channels or integrin-mediated
  signals involving F-actin/cytoskeletal reorganisation.
