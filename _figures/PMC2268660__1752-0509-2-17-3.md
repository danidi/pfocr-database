caption: Glucose signaling and regulatory pathway in the yeast S. cerevisiae. A) Inferred
  regulatory interaction map for glucose repression. We used genome-wide gene expression
  data from different mutants with deletions in key glucose repression elements (Δgrr1,
  Δhxk2, Δmig1, Δmig1mig2 and Δrgt1) [9,11] to determine Reporter TFs (p-value < 0.01;
  see Additional file ). The graph links the deleted elements (colored nodes) to the
  corresponding Reporter TFs. The end arrow indicates if the protein is also a 'Reporter
  TF for Up-Regulated Genes only' (triangular arrow), a 'Reporter TF for Down-Regulated
  Gene Only (T arrow), both (diamond arrow) or none (no arrow). B) The two main pathways
  reported in literature for glucose sensing and signaling in yeast.
