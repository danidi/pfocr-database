caption: Current model of Cln3 function in Dictyostelium. (1) Cln3 localizes primarily
  to the contractile vacuole (CV) system, and to a smaller extent, compartments of
  the endocytic pathway and the Golgi complex. (2) Cln3 function is linked to mitosis.
  (3) Loss of cln3 increases the rate of cell proliferation, alters cytokinesis, decreases
  the efficiency of regulatory volume decrease (RVD), reduces adhesion, delays aggregation,
  causes cells to develop precociously, and impairs spore integrity. (4) Loss of cln3
  reduces the intracellular level of CsaA protein. (5) Loss of cln3 increases the
  expression of tpp1A during osmotic stress and increases TPP1 enzymatic activity.
  (6) Cln3 modulates the secretion of AprA and CfaD. (7) Loss of cln3 increases the
  secretion of Tpp1F, Cln5, CtsD, CadA, and selected cysteine proteases. (8) Loss
  of cln3 reduces the secretion of CMF during growth.
