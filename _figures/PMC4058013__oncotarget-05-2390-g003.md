caption: A, Schematic representation of the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis
  and biotransformation. Genes that are upregulated in response to KLK5 are denoted
  in red and downregulated genes in green. To generate an interaction network with
  IPA, a subset of the identified genes was selected based on their predicted functions
  in cholesterol and lipid metabolism (B) or genes predicted to be regulated by SREBF1
  and SREBF2 (C). D, SREBF1 is activated in KLK5-expressing cells as confirmed here
  by RT-PCR, while the expression of INSIG2 was unaltered. E, SREBP1 is induced in
  KLK5-expressing cells as confirmed here by Western blotting.
