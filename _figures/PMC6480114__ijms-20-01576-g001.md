caption: Proposed mechanical cues regulates Hippo signaling pathway in gastric tumorigenesis.
  (A) Hippo pathway turn on and YAP1 inactivation under soft ECM or high cell density.
  Cells reside in soft ECM and ECM exerts low mechanical force on gastric cells. Integrin
  signaling is inactivated. RAP2/ARHGAP29 axis activates MST1/2 and LATS1/2, as well
  as other Hippo pathway components. The GPCR/Gαs directly phosphorylates LATS1/2
  via a cAMP/PKA dependent manner. Mechanical force also triggers SWI/SNF activation
  in the nucleus to bind with YAP1, preventing the interaction between YAP1 and TEADs.
  Meanwhile, under high cell density, E-cadherin/β-catenin and α-catenin bind on the
  junctional proteins, mediating AMOT and 14-3-3 to quench YAP1. Due to the activation
  of Hippo pathway, YAP1/TAZ is retained in the cytoplasm and undergoes further degradation.
  Transcription activity of TEADs is thus suppressed. Moreover, the activation of
  RhoA and formation of F-actin fibers are abrogated by ARHGAP29 in a Hippo pathway
  independent manner. (B) Hippo pathway turn off and YAP1 activation under rigid ECM,
  low cell density, and shear stress. Rigid ECM causes the activation of integrin
  signaling and promotes the assembly of FA/SRC complex. Rho-GTPases facilitate the
  polymerization of F-actin cytoskeleton. F-actin guides the nuclear translocation
  of YAP1/TAZ. Besides, ligands bind to GPCRs to recruit downstream G proteins, Gα12/13,
  Gαq/11, and Gαi/o. Through Rho-GTPases, GPCR signaling suppresses the functional
  role of Hippo pathway and increase YAP1/TAZ nuclear translocation. Overexpressed
  YAP1/TAZ and the downstream effectors promote GC cell grow, metastasis, and drug
  resistance. Production of MMPs are increased, further enhancing ECM rigidity. Low
  cell density enables the cytokine secretion which is required for vascular invasion.
  Shear stress also leads to the accumulation of cytokines for metastasis and lymph
  nodes transportation. Verteporfin has been proved as a prominent small molecule
  targeting YAP1-TEAD and inhibiting tumorigenicity. ECM, extracellular matrix; FA,
  focal adhesion; TJ, tight junction; AJ, adherent junction; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases.
