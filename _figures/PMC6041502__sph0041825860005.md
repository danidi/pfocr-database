caption: Current model for how environmental lipids modulate TbACC. Environmental
  lipids activate a kinase signaling pathway that leads to the phosphorylation and
  inactivation of TbACC. Environmental lipids also increase TbACC protein expression
  through repression of TbACC mRNA translation and/or stimulation of protein degradation.
  Lipids may regulate TbACC activity and expression directly or through the action
  of a lipid sensor. In addition, lipids may coordinately control TbACC protein levels
  and activity via the same kinase signaling pathway, or TbACC protein and activity
  may be regulated by distinct mechanisms. FAS, fatty acid synthesis.
