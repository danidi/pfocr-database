caption: Under normal circumstances the RANK signal peptide is cleaved as it emerges
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the receptor migrates to the cell surface
  where it can be activated by RANKL causing NFκB activation through the classical
  pathway (left side of figure). Insertion mutations affecting the signal peptide
  of RANK result in failure of signal peptide cleavage causing the abnormal protein
  to accumulate in the ER with activation of NFκB through the unfolded protein response
  (UPR) (right side of figure).
