caption: Regulation of PKA in committed cells. (a) The PKA pathway. The addition of
  glucose to a non-fermenting yeast culture results in a rapid increase in the cellular
  level of cyclic AMP (cAMP, red circle), which binds to the regulatory subunit of
  PKA, thereby releasing and activating the catalytic subunits. Arrows indicate activation
  and barred lines indicate inhibition. (b) BCY1 expression. (c,d) The average expression
  of PKA-responsive genes. The average is over (c) 161 PKA-induced and (d) 314 PKA-repressed
  genes (identified by [35]). Each expression pattern is accompanied by a colored
  bar indicating the log2 fold change.
