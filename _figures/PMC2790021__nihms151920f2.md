caption: 'Proposed pathway for syntrophic benzoate metabolism adapted from McInerney
  et al.[]. The enzymes involved are: BamY, benzoyl-CoA ligase; BamI, benzoyl-CoA
  reductase; BamR, cyclohex-1,5-diene-1-carboxyl-CoA hydratase; BamQ, 6-hydroxycyclohexane-1-carboxyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase; BamA, 6-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxyl-CoA hydrolase. Gene product designations
  are from [,,]. Reactions with question marks are postulated routes for cyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxyl-CoA
  and cyclohexane carboxyl-CoA formation, but enzymatic evidence is lacking. ATP synthesis
  from acetyl-CoA could occur by archaeal-like acetyl-CoA synthetases (ADP-forming)
  (Acd) or by enzymes similar to phosphotransacetylase (Pta) and acetate kinase (AK).
  Reducing equivalents, [H].'
