caption: 'Pathways that convert acetate to cholesterol or oleoyl-CoA and retinaldehyde
  to RA or retinyl esters. All processes are inhibited in Cyp1b1-/- pups (KO) ().
  Srebp2/cholesterol pathway genes and Aldh1a1 show no effect of GVAD in WT pups.
  The Srebp-1/oleoyl-CoA pathway genes show losses with GVAD treatment of WT pups.
  The retinaldehyde is formed in the liver from β-carotene by Bco1. The reductase,
  Rdh11, which regenerates retinol, follows the Srebp1 pattern. This step, followed
  by Lrat, generates retinyl esters in stellate cells. Aldh1a1 is the major means
  to convert retininaldehyde to RA (A). Distinctive Cyp1b1 –retinol partnerships for
  Srebp1 and Srebp2 during stimulations by Igf1. Inhibition Pathway (I): Cyp1b1 removes/metabolizes
  the mediator of an inhibitory pathway, which becomes active in Cyp1b1-/- pups. Retinol
  supports this inhibitory pathway, leading to stimulation with GVAD in Cyp1b1-/-
  pups, but no effect in WT, where Cyp1b1 removes the mediator. Activator Pathway
  (A): Retinol stimulates an Activator Pathway that leads to the suppression by GVAD
  in WT pups. A contribution of Cyp1b1 to activation is possible, but Cyp1b1-/- Activator
  losses cannot be distinguished from enhancement of the Inhibitor Pathway. TORC1
  activation and Insig inhibition control the Scap-Srebp complex that is suppressed
  by cholesterol (CH) (B).'
