caption: Summary of hepatic metabolic perturbations associated with APAP-induced mitochondrial
  dysfunction and oxidative stress. Diagrammatic representations of the glycolysis
  pathway (a) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (b), as well as the methionine–homocysteine
  cycle and glutathione synthesis (c) are shown. Red shading depicts an APAP-induced
  elevation, while blue shading represents an APAP-induced depletion. Key d-3-HB,
  d-3-hydroxybutyrate (color figure online)
