caption: Putative pathway of metabolic alterations via TGF‐β1 TGF‐β1 binds the cognate
  receptor and then causes downstream signalling from the canonical pathway to activate
  glutaminolysis via up‐regulation of glutaminase 1 enzyme, and this leads to fibrosis
  possibly through increased epigenetic marks. Glycolysis is also up‐regulated leading
  to fibrosis via up‐regulation of glycolytic enzymes. Both pathways can be blocked
  with G968 (glutaminase 1 inhibitor) or 2‐DG and 3PO for glycolysis. Extracellular
  succinate also up‐regulates fibrosis possibly through the activation of P38 via
  phosphorylation of this intracellular signalling molecule. 4‐OI mediates an anti‐fibrotic
  effect by first being cleaved to itaconate via esterases and alkylates cysteine
  residue 161 (Cys 161) of KEAP1 thus repressing its ability to modify nrf‐2 to be
  degraded via the proteosome. Nrf‐2 is then up‐regulated and downstream targets such
  as HO‐1 are increased that are anti‐fibrotic. 2‐DG; 2Deoxyglucose, 4‐OI; 4‐octyl
  itaconate, HO‐1; Haem oxygenase‐1, nrf2; nuclear factor erythroid‐2‐related factor,
  TGF‐β1; transforming growth factor beta 1
