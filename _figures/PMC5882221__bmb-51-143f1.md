caption: The ubiquitin system. (A) Ubiquitin is activated by a ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme (E1) and transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2). E3 ligase binds
  target substrate and coordinates the covalent attachment of ubiquitin. Target proteins
  may be mono-ubiquitinated or, as in this example, poly-ubiquitinated. (B) The HECT
  E3 ligase acts as an acceptor of ubiquitin from E2 enzyme. Ubiquitin is then transferred
  to a specific Lys residue in the substrate. Conversely, RING E3 ligase acts as scaffold
  by facilitating interaction between E2 and substrate. These E3s can be a single
  chain or as large multiprotein complexes. (C) Generation of free ubiquitin from
  the precursors is a key function of deubiquitinases (DUBs). DUBs have a crucial
  role in maintaining ubiquitin homeostasis and preventing degradation of ubiquitin
  together with substrates of the proteasomal or lysosomal pathways (recycling of
  ubiquitin) (upper left panel). DUB-E3 interactions can rescue E3s or common substrates
  from degradation, or remove a non-degradative ubiquitin signal (upper right and
  lower left panels). The A20 combines DUB activity with E3 activity in one single
  polypeptide chain to modulate the ubiquitination status of key adaptors in NF-κB
  signaling (lower right panel). E3 ligase and DUB activity is indicated with black
  arrows and red arrows, respectively.
