caption: Summary of differential metabolism of procainamide in humans and mice. The
  acylation of procainamide in humans is responsible for the protective metabolism,
  consistent with procainamide acylation in mouse. However, more acylated metabolites
  of procainamide can be formed by acyltransferase in humans than in mice. The differential
  metabolism of procainamide is N-oxidation and N-hydroxylation associated with the
  side-effects of procainamide in vivo. In humans, N-oxidation mediated by FMO1 and
  FMO3 is the major route of metabolism of procainamide, while N-hydroxylation regulated
  by CYP2D6 and CYP1A1 is a minor metabolic pathway. In contrast, N-hydroxylation
  is the major metabolic route of procainamide in mice, while N-oxidation is a minor
  pathway in this species.
