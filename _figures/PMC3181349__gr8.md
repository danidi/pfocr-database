caption: Proposed signaling pathway that regulates the in AngII-dependent TRPC6 expression
  in podocytes. Results from our study together with previously published data suggest
  the existence of the following signaling pathways in podocytes mediating AngII-induced
  TRPC6 expression and podocyte injury. AT1R stimulation by AngII results in Ca2+
  influx at least in part mediated by TRPC6. Ca2+-dependent calcineurin activation
  leads to activation and nuclear translocation of NFAT, which enhances transcription
  of NFAT-responsive genes such as TRPC6. A consequent increase in TRPC6 protein expression
  at the cell membrane could result in a positive feedback regulatory circuit, because
  Ca2+ influx through TRPC6 itself appears to be involved in the signaling pathway
  leading to increased TRPC6 expression. Our studies show that NFAT activation per
  se is sufficient to induce TRPC6 transcription and proteinuria. Hypothetically,
  the proposed feedback mechanism could also result in a persistent calcineurin activation,
  which was previously demonstrated to lead to the dephosphorylation and degradation
  of the actin-binding protein synaptopodin (dashed box). The latter was shown to
  result in cytoskeletal rearrangement and, eventually, proteinuria. Possibly, the
  latter pathway is involved in the generation of podocyte injury subsequent to AngII-induced
  TRPC6 expression.
