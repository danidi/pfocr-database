caption: Figure 2. Scheme illustrating STAT3 mediated processing of individual miRNAs
  and contrariwise, the modulation of the STAT3 pathway by miRNAs at different levels.
  STAT3 mediates positive and negative regulation of various miRNAs at the transcriptional
  level. On the other hand, this signaling pathway is controlled by numerous miRNAs
  at the receptor level, by modulating its activators and suppressors and by direct
  regulation of STAT3 mRNA.
