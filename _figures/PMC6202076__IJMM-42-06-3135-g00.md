caption: Network of drug-target genes and DPT-associated genes and their enrichment
  analysis. (A) DrugBank was used to find 11 primary and DPTs of aspirin (red); STRING
  was used to find 300 secondary DPT-interacting proteins (green); Cytoscape was used
  to create a PPI network of all 311 genes. (B) Cytohubba was used to find network
  hub genes by degree, and the top 10 hub genes are displayed (red, high score; yellow,
  low score). The second hub gene-UBC was not suitable as a hub gene, thus was removed.
  DPT, direct protein target; STRING, Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting
  Genes/Proteins; PPI, protein-protein interaction. Network of drug-target genes and
  DPT-associated genes and their enrichment analysis. (C) DAVID was used to analyze
  GO annotations (biological process) of all 311 genes. The top 12 terms were selected
  according to P-value. (D) The top 12 KEGG pathways enriched for all 311 genes were
  identified using the aforementioned method. DAVID, Database for Annotation, Visualization
  and Integrated Discovery; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes; GO, gene
  ontology.
