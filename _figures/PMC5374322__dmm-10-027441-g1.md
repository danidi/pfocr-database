caption: 'Step-wise tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer. Cartoon of the large intestine
  showing the structure of the normal colonic mucosa, with many mucous-secreting goblet
  cells (blue) at top left. Tumorigenesis begins with the mutation of intestinal epithelial
  stem cells (shown in magenta) in the colon or rectal mucosa, with mutations often
  occurring first in the APC, KRAS or BRAF genes. Mutations in BRAF or KRAS (in the
  absence of Wnt pathway mutations) are often associated with the formation of aberrant
  crypt foci (ACF). Most adenomas are associated with mutations in Wnt pathway components,
  such as APC or CTNNB1, which result in hyperactivation of Wnt signaling in early
  adenomas. Deregulation of Wnt signaling often co-occurs with mutations in KRAS,
  PIK3CA, or other mutations, leading to activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling cascade.
  Adenomas then progress with additional mutations (e.g. SMAD4) and frequently acquire
  genomic instability. Lastly, mutations in TP53 and TGFBR2 are associated with later
  stages of cellular transformation and with invasive characteristics of adenocarcinomas.
  Official human gene symbols and full names: AKT, AKT serine/threonine kinase 1;
  APC, adenomatous polyposis coli or Wnt signaling pathway regulator; BRAF, B-Raf
  proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase; KRAS, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene
  homolog or proto-oncogene and GTPase; PIK3CA, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha; SMAD4, Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog
  family member 4; TGFBR2, transforming growth factor beta receptor 2; TP53, tumor
  protein p53.'
