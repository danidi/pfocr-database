caption: Hepatitis C virus life cycle. Following the initial binding of hepatitis
  C virus (HCV) to glycosaminoglycans present on heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs),
  to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), to scavenger receptor class B type 1
  (SR-BI) and to CD81, the viral particles utilize different proteins, such as epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR), Ras, Rho ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2), transferrin
  receptor 1 (TfR1), cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), claudin-1
  (CLDN1) and occludin (OCLN), for entering into the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
  After the pH-dependent fusion between viral and target membranes, HCV RNA is released
  into the cytosol and translated at the rough ER, giving rise to a polyprotein that
  is then cleaved into mature viral proteins. Viral proteins together with host cell
  factors, induce the formation of the membranous web (MW), composed by vesicles as
  well as cytosolic lipid droplets (cLD) where the RNA replication occurs. Assembly
  of HCV particles probably starts in close proximity to the ER and lipid droplets.
  The viral envelope is acquired by budding into the ER at sites of lipoprotein synthesis.
  HCV particles are thought to be released via the constitutive secretory pathway
  in association with components of lipoproteins in order to produce a mature form
  of lipoviroparticles (LVP). This lipidation might occur either during budding (hybrid
  particle model; I) or during egress via interaction between the virion and lipoproteins
  (dual-particle model; II).
