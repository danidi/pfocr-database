caption: The effect of PUFAs on food allergy. The color of the arrows and text indicate
  if the evidence is obtained from clinical, in vivo or in vitro data. The + or—indicates
  if the observed effect is an inhibitory or stimulatory response of a certain cell
  type. Note that clinical and in vivo arrows indicate the observed end stage effects
  only, this may not be a reflection of the direct effect of PUFAs on the target cells.
  Therefore, the components could actually target a cell group earlier in the pathway.
