caption: The roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 on Tregs generation, expansion, function,
  and migration. The absence of mTOR signaling dramatically increase Tregs generation,
  while deleting either mTORC1 or mTORC2 signaling does not lead to the upregulation
  of Foxp3+ Tregs. mTORC1 and mTORC2 play opposite roles in Tregs function, the absence
  of main component Raptor of mTORC1 limits Tregs function, and lack of mTORC2 increases
  Tregs function via promoting the activity of mTORC1. mTORC2 promotes the migration
  of Tregs to inflammatory sites. However, the effects of mTORC1 on the Tregs migration
  remain unclear. mTOR signaling is essential for Tregs expansion. Consequently, Slc3a2-deficient
  Tregs have an impaired mTORC1 pathway and show lower proliferation ability. However,
  the role of mTORC2 on Tregs expansion remains unclear.
