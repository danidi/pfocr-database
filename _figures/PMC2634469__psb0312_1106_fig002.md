caption: Model for metabolic fates of Arg. The catabolic route, initiated in mitochondria,
  is via ARGAH and dOAT, resulting in export of P5C that is converted to cytosolic
  glutamate. The only route for polyamine production in Arabidopsis is via ADC, which
  is not localized to the mitochondrion (SUBA database). There is no reported in vitro
  activity for direct oxidation of polyamines to NO. Polyamine oxidases (DAO and PAO)
  generate H2O2, either in the apoplast or peroxisome., The relationship between H2O2
  and NO is complex. In guard cells H2O2 stimulates production of NO via a cytoplasmic
  NR (dotted arrow) and NO can conceivably inhibit heme-containing catalases, thereby
  increasing H2O2 levels (hence, the double-arrow between H2O2 and NO). The complexity
  of any pathway to NO production from Arg via polyamines leads us to favor a direct
  Arg to NO conversion. Increased LRF in low-ADC mutants, spe1 and spe2, is also inconsistent
  with polyamine generation of NO.
