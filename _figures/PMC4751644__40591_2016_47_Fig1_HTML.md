caption: PI3K signaling and common mutations related with ASD and schizophrenia. Class
  I PI3K is activated by growth factors through a tyrosin kinase receptor. The PI3K
  activation results in the conversion of PtdIns [, ]P2 (PIP2) to PtdIns [–]P3 (PIP3),
  a process that is reversed by the action of PTEN. PIP3 serves as docking for Akt
  and PDK1. Akt, indirectly, stimulates mTORC1 resulting in an augment of protein
  synthesis by phosphorylation of the ribosomal kinase p70S6K or 4E-BPs. Phosphorilation
  of the former releases its binding to eIF4E and enhances translation. The mTOR kinase
  is encoded by a single gene in mammals, but it is the active enzyme in two multi-protein
  complexes called mTORC1 and 2. mTORC1 is defined by the Raptor subunit (regulatory-associated
  protein of mTOR) while mTORC2 by the Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of
  mTOR). mTORC2 is also activated by growth factors through a not well-defined PI3K-dependent
  mechanism. mTORC2 contributes to the full activation of Akt by phosphorylation on
  serine 473 (for a review see []). An important kinase downstream of PI3K is GSK3,
  which is inhibited by direct Akt phosphorylation. Among other functions GSK3 regulates
  TSC activity and indirectly protein translation. Several signaling pathways dramatically
  alter PI3K activity. Downstream mGLUR5, fmr1 regulates transcriptional levels of
  PIKE or the catalytic PI3K subunit p110β. Mutations in the phosphatase PTEN enhance
  mTOR dependent translation. Mutations on NF1 enhance Ras and p110 catalytic activity.
  Lack of MecP2 expression reduces BDNF levels that in turn contributes to a general
  deficit of PI3K signaling. Mutations in the PI3K catalytic subunit p110δ or Akt3
  isoform are associated with schizophrenia. Elevated levels of CYT-1 expression,
  one of the isoforms of the ErbB4 receptor, raised expression of the p110δ subunit
  and are also connected with schizophrenia
