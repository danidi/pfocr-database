caption: (A) Sirt1 reduces the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)
  by diminishing the expression of lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (Lox-1) via
  the deacetylation and suppression of the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to a reduction
  of foam cell formation. (B) Sirt1 interacts with the liver X receptor (LXR) and
  promotes its deacetylation and subsequent activation. Activation of LXR upregulates
  the expression of ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member (ABCA) 1 and ABC sub-family
  G member (ABCG) 1, which leads to the reverse transport of cholesterol and the suppression
  of foam cell formation and cholesterol loading in macrophages. The induction of
  C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) contributes to foam cell migration, resulting
  in a reduction of foam cell formation.
