caption: Schematic representation of the involvement of AMPK in DHT's inhibitory effect
  in FSH-mediated mitogenesis. Results from the present study suggest that DHT exposure
  increases AMPK activation, which in turn reduces FSH-mediated inhibition of AMPK.
  AMPK activation also blocks the mitogenic stimulus of FSH on ERK activation leading
  reduced cyclin D2 mRNA expression. These effects as well as the reported increase
  in cell cycle inhibitor p27kip due to AMPK activation might be playing a significant
  role in DHT-mediated inhibition of granulosa cell proliferation.
