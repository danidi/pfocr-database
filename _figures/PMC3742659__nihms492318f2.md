caption: Semaphorin 3A produces a rapid growth cone collapse (left side). We previously
  showed that calpain, by cleaving p-p53, was involved in the regulation of RhoA synthesis
  and the activity of ROCK/LIM kinase pathway, and therefore in disruption of the
  actin network and growth cone collapse (). Recent findings indicate that while m-calpain
  is activated by ERK/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation, which is downstream of semaphorin
  receptor and EGFR activation, it is suppressed by cAMP-induced PKA activation (right
  side). The findings that m-calpain activation results in PTEN degradation, and activation
  of the mTOR pathway suggest the existence of more complex interactions between proteolysis
  and protein synthesis through the mTOR pathway. The spatio-temporal regulation of
  these complex events will determine the fate of the growth cone, either growth or
  collapse. Blue lines in the right side panel indicate events potentially linked
  to growth cone growth.
