caption: TGR5 signaling in hepatic metabolic regulation. (A) TGR5 signaling regulates
  glucose homeostasis by increasing GLP-1 secretion from enteroendocrine L cells [,]
  and energy expenditure in adipocytes []. TGR5 signaling also improves glucose tolerance
  through signaling in hepatocytes []. (B) TGR5 signaling decreases hepatic CYP8B1
  expression, leading to a decrease in the production of 12-α-hydroxylated bile acids
  [,], and upregulates the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis, thereby decreasing
  bile acid profile hydrophobicity [,]. (C) TGR5 signaling may protect against non-alcoholic
  fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by reducing hepatic cytokine expression in Kupffer cells
  [,] and decreasing hepatic lipid deposition [,], which together, attenuate hepatic
  insulin resistance. TGR5 signaling also decreases serum AST and ALT concentrations
  [], as well as hepatic fibrosis [], ultimately improving hepatic function. (D) TGR5-dependent
  improvements in glucose tolerance following bariatric surgery depend on surgery
  type. Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) results in decreased hepatic glucose production
  and inflammation, and increased hepatic insulin signaling [,]. Following gallbladder
  bile diversion to the ileum (GB-IL), there is no TGR5-dependent improvement in insulin
  sensitivity []. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) has no TGR5-dependent effect on
  glucose tolerance [].
