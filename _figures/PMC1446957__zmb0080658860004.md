caption: In vitro carcinoma and tumor cell survival. Three major α6β4-dependent cancer
  cell survival mechanisms have been reported. Carcinoma survival has been reported
  to depend on the upregulation of VEGF downstream of tyrosine 1494 in β4. Exocytosis
  of VEGF results in the activation of its receptor, which leads to carcinoma survival
  through activation of the PI-3 kinase/Akt survival pathway. Interestingly, if p53
  is functionally present, Akt is downregulated and carcinoma cells undergo apoptosis;
  this effect is also dependent upon α6β4 in these cells. In contrast to carcinomas,
  tumor cell survival depends on the formation of HDs and the activation of NF-κB.
  VEGFR, VEGF receptor.
