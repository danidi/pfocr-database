caption: (i) CD20-specific mAb (i.e., rituximab) (anti-CD20), as reported in the current
  issue of the JCI by Kelishadi et al (), binds and selectively depletes CD20+ B cells,
  thereby reducing alloantibody levels. Third generation CD20-specific mAbs are under
  development (e.g., ocrelizumab, ofatumumab). (ii) Inhibitors such as belimumab neutralize
  BAFF, while inhibitors such as atacicept (TACI-Ig) inhibit both BAFF and APRIL.
  (iii) Proteasome inhibitors (e.g., bortezomib) reversibly bind to the proteasome
  and disrupt various cell signaling pathways including the NF-κB pathway. (iv) Complement
  inhibitors, such as eculizumab (an antibody specific for complement component 5
  [C5]), bind the complement protein C5, leading to cessation of complement-mediated
  cell lysis via the membrane attack complex (MAC). Since activation of the complement
  system is initiated by binding of 2 alloantibody molecules to a multivalent antigen
  followed by formation of the C1 complex, C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) prevents initiation
  of the serial complement cascade by inhibiting proteolytic cleavage of later complement
  components (specifically C2 and C4) and formation of C3 convertase. (v) Abatacept
  and belatacept (LEA29Y) are CTLA4-Ig molecules that bind the B7 costimulation molecule
  and block T cell costimulation of B cell activation and thereby production of alloantibodies.
  (vi) CD40-specific mAb (anti-CD40) binds the CD40 costimulation molecule. Blocking
  CD40L/CD40 interactions with CD40-specific antibody prevents T cell help to B cell
  activation, and consequently alloantibody production is inhibited.
