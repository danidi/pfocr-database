caption: A-SAA is probably mainly due to the passive diffusion process from blood
  into the joint cavity. However, A-SAA expression in joints may also arise from primary
  chondrocytes, FLS and preadipocytes under glucocorticoid treatment, from dedifferentiated
  chondrocytes under spontaneous release and from preadipocytes and adipose synovium
  under IL-1β treatment. Glucocorticoid-induced A-SAA expression is GR-dependent and
  can be downregulated in the presence of PPAR-γ agonists (genistein and rosiglitazone)
  or under the control of TGF-β, with ALK1 as a stimulatory pathway and ALK5 as an
  inhibitory pathway. Spontaneous secretion of A-SAA by dedifferentiated chondrocytes
  can also be inhibited by TGF-β. TLR4 can mediate A-SAA-induced cytokines and MMPs
  expression in both primary chondrocytes and FLS, and be selectively inhibited by
  TAK242. * Ref .
