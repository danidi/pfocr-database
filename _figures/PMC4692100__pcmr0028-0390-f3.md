caption: Individual functions of MITF at different expression levels. High MITF expression
  can be endogenous or the result of cAMP‐induced upregulation. MITF expression can
  be intrinsically low or induced through exogenous factors such as TGF β, WNT5A or
  hypoxia. Concomitant signalling will impact on MITF's function with regard to target
  gene recognition and transactivation from the respective promoters, and ultimately
  on the cellular response. At all levels, MITF regulates cell cycle progression,
  but at low levels, its contribution is less.
