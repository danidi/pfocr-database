caption: Proposed pathway of MMA metabolism by Methylocella silvestris. Formaldehyde
  produced from this pathway is either assimilated as a carbon source through the
  serine cycle or further oxidized to CO2, and the ammonium produced is assimilated
  as a nitrogen source through the glutamine synthetase (GS)/glutamate synthase (GOGAT)
  pathway. e−, electron.
