caption: Redundant miRNA mechanisms regulating proliferation and survival pathways
  in cancer. Expression of transcription factors, BCL-2 family genes and inhibitors,
  and cell cycle regulatory molecules is redundantly regulated by miRNAs in cancer,
  prompting speculation about possible regulatory roles of these miRNAs in a similar
  pathway in AD.
