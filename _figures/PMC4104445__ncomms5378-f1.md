caption: 'This proposal integrates salient information from the present study (*)
  and considers published literature. Metastasis-associated protein 1-mediated fibrosis
  and transformation of cell cycle progress are linked to: transforming growth factor-beta
  (TGF-beta) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated cell proliferation,
  associated with an upregulation in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), TGF-beta-stimulated
  clone 22 homologue (TSC22D1) and EGFR pathway substrate 8 (EPS8); cell cycle activation
  and cytokinesis associated with an upregulation in dual specificity protein kinase
  TTK (TTK), serine/threonine kinase 6 (STK6), CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit
  2 (CKS2), budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine
  kinase (BUB1 and BUB1B), cell division cycle 20 (CDC20), protein regulator of cytokinesis
  1 (PRC1), kinesin family member 2C (KIF2C); and endogenous/exogenous xenobiotic
  metabolism associated with an upregulation in UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family,
  polypeptide A10 (UGT1A10); UGT 2 family B11 (UGT2B11), carbohydrate sulphotransferase
  4 (CHST4) and sulphotransferase family, cytosolic, 1C, member 1 (SULT1C1). Chronic
  opisthorchiasis is linked to genetic alterations in tumour protein 53 (TP53: 44.4%
  cases), mothers against decapentaplegic homologue 4 (SMAD4; 16.7%), Kirsten rat
  sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS; 16.7%), histone-lysine N-methyltransferase (MLL3;
  14.8%), roundabout homologue 2 (ROBO2; 9.3%), guanine nucleotide-binding protein
  (GNAS; 9.3%) and ring finger protein 43 (RFN43; 9.3%).'
