caption: The default of VLCFA synthesis within the oenocytes provokes the failure
  to transfer lipids through the spiracular ducts from the spiracular gland to the
  spiracular opening. The gene products identified to be involved in this metabolic
  pathway within the oenocytes are indicated (oval forms surrounded in black). The
  signal running from the oenocytes to the spiracles is yet unidentified.
