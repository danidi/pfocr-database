caption: 'STAU1 and/or STAU2, either individually (as shown for simplicity) or more
  likely as homo- or hetero-dimers if not multimers, bind to a 3''UTR SBS that can
  be formed by either intramolecular or intermolecular base-pairing,. During protein
  synthesis, when ribosomes reach a termination codon that resides sufficiently upstream
  of an SBS so that bound STAU1 and/or STAU2 is not removed by the terminating ribosome,
  UPF1, which is recruited by SBS-bound STAU(s), is activated. Taking cues from the
  related pathway, NMD, translation termination may facilitate the loading of UPF1
  onto the mRNA 3''UTR, as may SBS-bound STAU1. Activation of mRNA decay may involve
  UPF1 phosphorylation, possibly by SMG1: it has been reported that UPF1 phosphorylation
  enhances the co-IP of UPF1 with STAU1. STAU promotes a conformational change in
  UPF1, thereby enhancing UPF1 helicase activity without concomitantly enhancing UPF1
  ATPase activity. That noted, however, ATP hydrolysis is required for helicase activity,
  which may be required for mRNP remodeling, as is the case for NMD. Cap, 5'' mRNA
  cap structure; SBS, STAU-binding site; Ter, termination codon; (A)n, poly(A) tail,
  orange ovals, 80S translationally active ribosome; purple UPF1, inactive form; blue
  UPF1, conformationally changed and active UPF1.'
