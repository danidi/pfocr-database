caption: Oxidative stress induced by environmental toxicants activates the PI3K/c-Src/FAK
  pathway, which subsequently controls the phosphorylation of caveolin-1, TJ and/or
  AJ proteins, the stability of E3 ubiquitin ligase Hakai and the interaction of polarity
  proteins with the endocytic adaptor Numb. This leads to the internalization of TJ
  and AJ proteins at the cell-cell interface, which imposes a feedback mechanism to
  dephosphorylate FAK. Aldehydes such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) are produced
  during oxidative stress to inactivate FAK. In addition, environmental toxicants
  induce the production of cytokines which are also regulated by the activation of
  MAPK via oxidative stress. Cytokines stimulates production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) from leukocytes to further increase oxidative stress. Cytokines and the activation
  of MAPK together result in endocytic vesicle-mediated internalization of TJ and
  AJ proteins. Note that polarity proteins such as Par6 are also involved in mediating
  the action of cytokines to recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf1 for the polyubiquitination
  and degradation of RhoA, which is important for the disruption of cell junctions.
  This illustrates that crosstalk exists between the PI3K/c-Src/FAK and cytokines/MAPK
  pathways via polarity proteins as their common downstream signaling mediators.
