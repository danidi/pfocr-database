caption: An illustration of the mechanism by which valosin‐containing protein (VCP)
  protects left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) against pressure overload. Pressure
  overload reduces VCP expression in heart which activates mTORC2 and attenuates the
  inhibitive effect of VCP on AKT/mTORC1/S6K signaling, subsequently promotes the
  pro‐growth pathway. VCP TG restores the TAC‐suppressed VCP and represses the TAC‐induced
  activation of AKT/mTORC1/S6K, fetal gene upregulation, and collagen synthesis and
  thus protects the heart against TAC‐induced LVH.
