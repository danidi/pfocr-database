caption: The critical difference between the active (A) and inactive (B) states of
  the canonical WNT signaling pathway is the accumulation of the licensing factor
  β-catenin, especially in the nucleus, where it binds to TCF/LEF family transcription
  factors to promote changes in gene transcription. The active state of the pathway
  (A) is characteristic of colorectal cancers and colorectal progenitor cells, as
  it favors proliferation and survival at the expense of differentiation and sensitivity
  to apoptosis. The inactive state (B) is characteristic of mature, differentiated
  cells of the colorectal epithelium that express APC. APC (green) is a required component
  of the cytoplasmic complex that limits β-catenin availability by promoting its proteolytic
  degradation.
