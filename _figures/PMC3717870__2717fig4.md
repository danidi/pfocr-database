caption: Analysis of gene transcription in response to an acute bout of exercise identifies
  dysregulation of SMAD, CREB, and HDAC activity in LRT. RNA was extracted from the
  soleus muscles of rats under resting conditions or 3 h after an acute bout of treadmill
  running exercise. Genes that were significantly upregulated (red) or downregulated
  (blue) in response to exercise in LRT/HRT were identified using Affymetrix Rat ST
  1.0 chips and analyzed using ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA; false discovery rate
  [FDR] = 5%, no fold-change filter). Transcription factor analysis in IPA clearly
  identified activation of SMAD3 (Z score = 2.3; P = 1.1 × 10–7) and CREB1 (Z score
  = 2.1; P = 6.7 × 10–6) target genes, whereas HDAC-regulated genes were inhibited
  (Z score = −2.8; P = 1.1 × 10–7) in response to exercise in LRT. Direct transcription
  factor/target gene relationships are indicated by solid arrows, and indirect relationships
  are indicated by broken arrows. No transcription factor enrichment was found in
  the HRT-regulated gene list, which was a set of entirely upregulated genes (n =
  156, FDR = 5%, no fold-change filter) that bore no ontological or pathway overlap
  with the LRT dataset in IPA. n = 5–6 chips/group.
