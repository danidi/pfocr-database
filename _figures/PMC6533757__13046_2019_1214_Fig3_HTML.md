caption: The immunosuppressive effect of the tumor microenvironment. The hypoxia and
  acidosis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) contribute to immunosuppression via
  several mechanisms. These mechanisms include increased accumulation, activation,
  and expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells; recruitment of inflammatory
  monocytes and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and reprogramming of TAMs towards
  the pro-tumor M2 phenotype; suppression of dendritic cell (DC) maturation, which
  results in inhibiting activation of tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs).
  Importantly, the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)–programmed cell death 1
  ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway is often activated in the TME as a mechanism to evade anticancer
  immune responses, with up-regulation of PD-L1 expression on TAMs, DCs, and tumor
  cells. In addition, tumor-infiltrating CTLs typically up-regulate PD-1, limiting
  their cytotoxic potential against tumor cells. CCL20, C-C-motif chemokine ligand
  20; CXCL, C-X-C-motif chemokine ligand; GM-CSF, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; IL, Interleukin
