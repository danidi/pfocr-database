caption: Putative signaling effect of ⋅NO on nodule development. ⋅NO has been shown
  to induce the transcription of CRE1. Through this way, ⋅NO could promote CK signaling
  which is known to participate in nodule development. Moreover, ⋅NO is suggested
  to repress PIN expression resulting in auxin accumulation and cell division. Finally,
  the binding of ABA to the PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor can be avoided by tyrosine nitration,
  not allowing the inactivation of PP2C, which inhibits SnRK2 and the downstream ABA
  signaling through ABI5. ⋅NO is also known to directly inactivate both SnRK2 and
  ABI5 by S-nitrosylation, which also results in the suppression of ABA signaling.
  By these mechanisms, ⋅NO could attenuate ABA-mediated suppression of nodule development
  (shown in lower opacity). ABF1, ABA RESPONSIVE ELEMENT-BINDING FACTOR 1; ABI, ABA
