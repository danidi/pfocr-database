caption: Innate immune dysfunction in rosacea. Overview of innate immune-mediated
  inflammatory responses in rosacea. UV light activates the vitamin D pathway, leading
  to increased levels of cathelicidin. Activation of TLR2 leads to increased levels
  and activity of KLKs (e.g., KLK5), resulting in increased cleavage of cathelicidin
  to form LL-37, causing release of pro-inflammatory cytokines; mast cell activation,
  and macrophage and neutrophil chemotaxis. In response to trigger factors (e.g.,
  stress, spices, exercise, noxious cold, and heat), TRPV1 and/or TRPA1 channels become
  activated, inducing neuropeptide responses, which activate/amplify the inflammatory
  response leading to the signs and symptoms of rosacea. KLKs kallikreins, MMPs matrix
  metalloproteinases, TLR2 toll-like receptor 2, ROS reactive oxygen species, UV ultraviolet.Modified
  from Yamasaki et al. [, , ], Two et al. [], Muto et al. [], Reinholz et al. [],
