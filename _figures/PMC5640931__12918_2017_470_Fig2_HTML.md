caption: 'Schematic representation of the mathematical model. a: The spatial model
  considers a single row of 21 adjacent hepatocytes. Each hepatocyte harbours the
  identical structure of the Wnt/ β-catenin signalling pathway shown in (b), but differs
  in its total APC concentration. Dkk may diffuse along the row of cells through the
  space of Disse as indicated by the green arrows. b: Model scheme exemplarily shown
  for neighbouring hepatocytes. The hepatocytes and their nuclei are indicated by
  light and dark brown backgrounds, respectively. The reaction scheme is identical
  in each of the 21 cells. The model is subdivided into three modules: the receptor
  module, the signalling module, and the target gene module. Components in a complex
  are separated by slashes. One-headed arrows denote reactions taking place in the
  indicated direction; double-headed arrows illustrate reversible binding reactions.
  Dashed arrows represent activation mechanisms; the dashed line ending in T-shape
  denotes inhibition. The number next to an arrow specifies the number of the reaction.
  Model equations and the reference parameter set are provided in the Additional file 
  (Section A). Note that Dkk can diffuse (green arrow) to all neighbouring hepatocytes
  on the right and left side'
