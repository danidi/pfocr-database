caption: Interaction network and co-expression analyses of Group A PP2Cs after salt
  treatments in BX (a) and FJ (b) and related genes in Arabidopsis. The genes marked
  with red show upregulation (Log2 based fold change >1). The genes marked with green
  show downregulation (Log2 based fold change < −1)
