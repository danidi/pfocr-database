caption: The TLR5 signaling cascade on the cell surface is stimulated by the binding
  of bacterial flagellum which is composed of flagellin. Flagellin-stimulated TLR5
  recruits the adapter protein, MyD88, which activates MAP kinases, p38, JNK, and
  the transcription factor NF-κB. NF-κB further induces downstream pro-inflammatory
  pathways resulting in the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8,
  IL-6 and TNFα. TP359 attenuated inflammation in human A549 lung cells exposed to
  P. aeruginosa and flagellin by down-regulating the phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK
  pathway or blocking the binding of flagellin to TLR5 receptor, thereby inhibiting
  the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
