caption: 'The role of SKN-1 in the development of C. elegans. In the early embryo
  skn-1 mRNA is deposited in both cells: AB and P1, but the level of SKN-1 protein
  is higher in the posterior cell (P1). This asymmetry is regulated by EEL-1, which
  binds SKN-1 and targets it to degradation mainly in AB cell. After division AB cell
  forms Aba (anterior) and ABp (posterior) cells and P1 forms P2 and EMS cells. In
  this four-cell embryo, SKN-1 is concentrated mostly in EMS cell. In the next step,
  EMS divides into the mesodermal MS precursor, which develop into pharynx and muscles,
  and the endodermal E precursor, which generates intestine cells. SKN-1 increases
  level of the transcription factors MED-1 and MED-2, which in turn activates end-1,3
  transcription. In MS cell POP-1 protein inhibits END-1,3, whereas MED-1 and MED-2
  activate transcription factors: tbx-35 and ceh-51, which are crucial for mesoderm
  development. In E cell POP-1 is modified on Wnt/β-catenin-dependent pathway, what
  activates END-1,3. END-1,3 cooperate with each other to increase the level of ELT-2,
  which starts intestine development'
