caption: Summary diagram illustrates a hypothesis for how ZSTK474 exerts its effects
  on ischemic reperfusion injury. Administration of ZSTK474 after cerebral ischemic
  reperfusion injury decreases the number of microglia/macrophages and shifts their
  phenotype toward the more restorative state. This treatment reduces the level of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhances the level of anti-inflammatory cytokines
  secreted. ZSTK474, a member of a specific class of IPI3K inhibitors, inhibits the
  phosphorylation of AKT to downregulate downstream mediators. The beneficial effects
  of ZSTK474 that we observed may result from inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway, which
  is an important downstream mediator of AKT-adjusted cell growth and translation
