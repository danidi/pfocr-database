caption: Schematic presentation of D-allose-triggered plant immunity and growth inhibition.
  After treatment D-allose can enter the plant cells through unknown mechanism, then
  phosphorylated by hexokinase (HXK) to produce D-allose 6-phosphate, which acts on
  the signal transduction downstream of DELLA protein (SLR1 in rice) as a suppressor
  of growth and gibberellin-dependent reactions. D-Allose can also activate NADPH
  oxidase leading to ROS production and resistance against Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
  oryzae []. Exogenous application of D-allose could also transiently upregulate extracellular
  cell wall invertase (CWI) activity, as reported for some nonmetabolizable sugars
  [], resulting in activation of MAPK signaling pathway, transcription factors and
  cofactors such as WRKY 45 or Nonexpresser of PR (NPR1) genes—a key regulator of
  salicylic acid-mediated systemic acquired resistance pathway, and ultimately production
  of PR proteins. Penetration of D-allose inside the plant cell would also alter the
  sucrose:hexose ratio, thereby affecting the sugar signaling and triggering plant
  immune response.
