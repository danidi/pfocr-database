caption: A schematic representation of the nitrergic system and its downstream effects
  in hippocampal neurons following stress exposure. In hippocampal neurons, the majority
  of nitric oxide (NO) production occurs via the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline
  by the neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) ①. High concentrations of
  NO can then covalently bond with protein thiol groups (protein-SH) to form S-nitroso-proteins
  (protein-SNO) ② or interact with the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) forming S-nitrosoglutathione
  (GSNO) ③. This can be regenerated back to GSH via an initial conversion to oxidized
  glutathione (GSSG) by S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), and subsequent reduction
  of GSSG by glutathione reductase (GSR) ④. Interaction of NO with the superoxide
  radical (O2−) results in the formation of the neurotoxic radical, peroxynitrite
  (ONOO−) which irreversibly reacts with protein tyrosine (Tyr) residues to form 3-nitrotyrosine
  (3-NT) ⑤. Increased NO and ONOO− are capable of causing cellular energy deficiency
  by inhibition of all components of the electron transport chain (Complex I–IV),
  including ATP synthase, resulting in decreased ATP production ⑥. Both post-synaptically
  produced NO, and NO produced by the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),
  can act as a neurotransmitter on pre-synaptic neurons ⑦. This pre-synaptic NO causes
  glutamate release, which activates post-synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDAR) to increase
  calcium (Ca2+) concentration and, in the presence of calmodulin, further potentiate
  nNOS-derived NO ⑧. Stress exposure increases NO by activating inflammatory cytokines
  to potentiate glial/astrocyte iNOS activity ⑨, and by increasing circulating corticosterone
  (CORT) which induces nNOS activity via a mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated
  pathway ⑩. This increase in NO results in downregulation of hippocampal glucocorticoid
  receptors (GR) and subsequently increases hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone
  (CRH) to induce depressive-like behaviors ⑪.
