caption: Nutritional regulation of the cell size and cell differentiation by the TORC1-Greatwall-Ensa-PP2A/B55
  pathway in fission yeast. In nitrogen-rich medium, the TORC1 complex is highly active.
  In this condition, the Ppk18/Cek1-Igo1 switch is inhibited by the fission yeast
  S6 kinase homologue Sck2. Therefore, the activity of the PP2A/B55 complex is high
  and counteracts the phosphorylation of the mitotic substrates carried out by the
  Cdk1/CyclinB, so mitosis is delayed, and cells divide with a large size. High PP2A/B55
  phosphatase also inhibits the phosphorylation of Gad8 and the sexual differentiation
  response. When cells are shifted to a nitrogen-poor medium, TORC1 complex activity
  drops, and the Ppk18/Cek1-Igo1 module is activated and inhibits PP2A/B55. Low activity
  of PP2A/B55 allows entry into mitosis with reduced levels of Cdk1-Cyclin B activity,
  and with a smaller cell size. The phosphatase also no longer inhibits Gad8 phosphorylation;
  as a result, the sexual differentiation response is induced.
