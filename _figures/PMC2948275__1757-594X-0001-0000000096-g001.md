caption: Following double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), the ataxia telangiectasia mutated
  (ATM) and ATM-related (ATR) kinases are activated and in turn phosphorylate and
  activate several target proteins, including checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and Chk2.
  Chk2 activates the p53 response pathway, which can lead to cell cycle arrest. ATR
  activation leads to the activation of caspase-2 and apoptosis following irreparable
  DNA damage. ATR also activates Chk1, which can then act in a feedback loop to negatively
  regulate ATR and inhibit further activation of nuclear caspase-2. DNA-dependent
  protein kinase (DNA-PK) is also activated by DSBs, presumably by ATM/ATR, and forms
  a complex with p53-inducible protein with a death domain (PIDD) and caspase-2 (DNA-PK
  PIDDosome). This complex serves to phosphorylate and activate caspase-2, which is
  then required for the initiation of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and DNA repair.
  Cytosolic caspase-2 is also activated by other stress signals such as reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), metabolic stress, cytotoxic drugs, heat shock, or endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress. Following heat shock, RAIDD (receptor-interacting protein-associated
  ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domain) can activate caspase-2, which
  is inhibited by HSP90α. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) acts to inhibit
  caspase-2 activation and cell death in oocytes. Activated cytosolic caspase-2 is
  able to cleave Bid to its truncated form (tBid), which (via Bax/Bak) can induce
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeability (MOMP), activation of caspase-9 and -3,
  and cell death. P, phosphorous; PUMA, p53-upregulated mediator of apoptosis.
