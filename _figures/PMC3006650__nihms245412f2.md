caption: Proposed interplay between TAG, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipid metabolism.
  De novo synthesis of sphingolipids occurs via SPT in the endoplasmic reticulum.
  A ceramide transfer protein transports ceramide to the Golgi apparatus, where complex
  sphingolipids, like SM and glycosphingolipids (not shown) are synthesized. Complex
  sphingolipids are then transferred to the plasma membrane, which contains more then
  75% of the total cellular sphingolipids.The synthesis of both TAG and glycerophospholipid
  from activated fatty acids follows a common pathway to the formation of DAG. DAG
  can be used either for TAG synthesis, storage, and secretion or for synthesis of
  the two main glycerophospholipid classes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylserine
  (PS). Metabolically, the sphingolipid, glycerophosoholipid and TAG pathways are
  linked through SM synthase, shown in the middle of the diagram. Exogenous palmitic
  acid partitions in a competitive fashion between sphingolipid and TAG pools.DAG
  and ceramide (boxed in the middle) are bioactive metabolites implicated in down-regulation
  of insulin signaling cascade. As the diagram indicates, they are in the crossroad
  of mulltiple pathways and their levels are subject to complex regulation.
