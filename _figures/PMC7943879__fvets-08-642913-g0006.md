caption: Forsythoside A (FTA) attenuates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endometritis
  by causing significant changes in the number of miRNAs in bESCs to regulate the
  target genes involved in different pathway. Through the activation of the NF-κB
  signaling pathway, a complex inflammatory response occurs, and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines are produced and released. FTA can increase the expression
  of miRNA-146a, miR-29E, miR-677, and miR-2904, and negatively regulate the target
  genes, TLR4, TRL2, and DHX58, to reduce the production of TLR4, TRL2, and DHX58
  receptor proteins. MiR-1434-5p and miR-2332 can attenuate the activation of the
  NF-κB signaling pathway by targeting TBK1 and TRAF6, respectively. MiR-205, miR-2904,
  miR-31, miR-302a, miR-302b, miR302-d, and miR-1434-5p target multiple cytokines
  and chemokines to reduce the production of inflammatory factors and reduce the inflammatory
  response. For example, bta-miR-205 targeted several inflammatory cytokines, including
  IL1A, IL27, IL2RA, and IL21. Bta-miR-2904 targeted IL1A. IL6ST is a signal transducer
  of IL-6 and a target gene of bta-miR-302a, bta-miR-302b, and bta-miR302-d. Bta-miR-1434-5p
  targeted chemokines CXCL5, CXCL8, and CXCL9. IL1B is a target gene of bta-miR-31.
  The black arrow indicates the mechanism underlying the inflammatory response of
  bESCs stimulated by LPS, and the green arrow indicates that miRNA expression partly
  increases under the action of FTA. The red T-shaped line indicates that miRNA targets
  inflammatory cytokines and reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and
  red arrows indicate that inflammatory factors or proteins can promote the expression
  of downstream inflammatory factors or proteins.
