caption: A. Structure and molecular weight of thiols that participate in the sulfur
  metabolic pathway. B. Alkyl maleimides are reacted with reduced thiol in 80% acetonitrile
  solution with 5 mM ammonium formate at pH 8. Tagged thiols were combined at 1:1
  ratio and analyzed by HILIC-MS/MS. The mass tags yield differing molecular weights
  but identical retention times by HILIC separation.
