caption: 'Mechanism of adaptive immune resistance in the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway.Notes:
  (A) Naive T cells around cancer cells were collected. (B) The TCR recognized and
  activated T cells with MHC, and besides, they induced T cells to express PD-1 and
  secrete IFN. (C) Local levels of IFN increased to induce PD-1 expression in cancer
  cells. PD-L1 and T-cell-expressed PD-1 recognized and generated an inhibitory signal,
  and as a result, the activated T cells lost their activity. (D) Application of PD-1/PD-L1
  antibody drugs blocked the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway and removed the inhibitory
  signal, allowing the T cells to attack the tumor cell.Abbreviations: TCR, T-cell
  receptor; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; IFN-γ, interferon γ; PD-1, programmed
  cell death 1; PD-L1, programmed cell death ligand 1; Anti-PD-1, antibody programmed
  cell death 1; anti-PD-L1, antibody programmed cell death ligand 1.'
