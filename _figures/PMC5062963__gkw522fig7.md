caption: Comparative model of transcriptional activation of ERα by cognate ligand
  versus cAMP signaling in the absence of estrogen. Note that in the estrogen-dependent
  pathway the recruitment of CARM1 to ERα is indirect and mediated by Grip1 whereas
  upon cAMP signaling and phosphorylation of CARM1 and LSD1 by PKA, at least CARM1
  is directly recruited to the unliganded ERα. This signaling crosstalk may favor
  OHT resistance by rendering some steps OHT-insensitive. Additional AF2-directed
  coactivators are likely to be involved.
