caption: Hypothetical Signaling Pathway of the Thermo-Activation of Opsins. Recent
  data show the involvement of opsins (rhodopsin/melanopsin) and TRPA1 in temperature
  discrimination of Drosophila larvae. Temperature activates opsins by an unknown
  mechanism, triggering the phosphoinositide cascade. Depletion of PIP2 from the cell
  membrane leads to TRP channel opening and cation influx into the cytoplasm.
