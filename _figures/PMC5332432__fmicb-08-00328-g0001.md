caption: Activation and control mechanisms of the human complement system. The classical
  pathway, initiated by antibody (Ab)-pathogen antigen (Ag) complexes, and the lectin
  pathway, initiated by lectin-microbial carbohydrate complexes, generate the C3 convertase
  C4b2a. The alternative pathway, initiated by interaction of C3b with the microbial
  surface, generates the C3 convertase C3bBb. These C3 convertases, by recruiting
  other complement components, generate C5 convertases (C4b2a3b and C3bBb3b), which
  in turn result in the release of pro-inflammatory peptides (C5a), deposition of
  opsonins (C3b) on the microbial surface to enhance phagocytic clearance, and generation
  of the membrane attack complex (MAC or C5b-9). Different complement regulators exists
  to modulate complement activation. For example, C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) binds to C1r/C1s
  or MASPs and inhibits their proteolytic activity, thus inactivating the classical
  and lectin pathways. C4BP binds to C4b, factor H (FH), and factor H-like protein
  1 (FHL-1) bind to C3b on C3 convertase. These interactions recruit factor I (FI)
  to inactivate C3b and subsequent activation steps.

  description: Activation and control mechanisms of the human complement system. The
    classical pathway, initiated by antibody (Ab)-pathogen antigen (Ag) complexes,
    and the lectin pathway, initiated by lectin-microbial carbohydrate complexes,
    generate the C3 convertase C4b2a. The alternative pathway, initiated by interaction
    of C3b with the microbial surface, generates the C3 convertase C3bBb. These C3
    convertases, by recruiting other complement components, generate C5 convertases
    (C4b2a3b and C3bBb3b), which in turn result in the release of pro-inflammatory
    peptides (C5a), deposition of opsonins (C3b) on the microbial surface to enhance
    phagocytic clearance, and generation of the membrane attack complex (MAC or C5b-9).
    Different complement regulators exists to modulate complement activation. For
    example, C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) binds to C1r/C1s or MASPs and inhibits their proteolytic
    activity, thus inactivating the classical and lectin pathways. C4BP binds to C4b,
    factor H (FH), and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) bind to C3b on C3 convertase.
    These interactions recruit factor I (FI) to inactivate C3b and subsequent activation
    steps.
