caption: The biosynthesis of Neu5Ac (sialic acid) occurs in the cytosol, where glucose
  undergoes several modifications to become UDP-GlcNAc. The UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase
  activity of the bifunctional GNE enzyme then epimerises UDP-GlcNAc into ManNAc,
  after which the GNE ManNAc kinase activity further converts this to ManNAc-6-P,
  which then undergoes two more steps to form cytoplasmic free sialic acid. A nuclear
  step activates free sialic acid to CMP-sialic acid, which translocates back to the
  cytosol, where is utilized by the Golgi complex to sialylate glycans (glycoproteins
  and glycolipids). Cytoplasmic CMP-sialic acid strongly feedback-inhibits the UDP-GlcNAc
  2-epimerase enzymatic activity in its allosteric site (dashed line). PEP=phosphoenolpyruvate.
  Patients with GNE myopathy have deficiency of GNE UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and ManNAc
  kinase activity, resulting in decreased sialic acid production. Supplementation
  of ManNAc (uncharged small molecule that crossed membranes readily) circumvents
  the feedback inhibition step in this pathway and increases sialic acid production.
  ManNAc can be converted to ManNAc-6-P by the ancillary enzyme GlcNAc kinase, which
  likely occurs in GNE myopathy patients with severe ManNAc kinase deficiency. See
  text for further details and references. Figure courtesy of Daryl Leja and Julia
