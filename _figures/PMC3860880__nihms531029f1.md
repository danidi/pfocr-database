caption: 'After T-DM1 binds HER2, the HER2–T-DM1 complex undergoes internalization,
  followed by lysosomal degradation. This process results in the intracellular release
  of DM1-containing catabolites that bind to tubulin and prevent microtubule polymerization,
  as well as suppress microtubule dynamic instability. T-DM1 has also been shown to
  retain mechanisms of action of trastuzumab, including disruption of the HER3/PI3K/AKT
  signaling pathway and FCγ receptor-mediated engagement of immune effector cells
  that leads to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.ADCC: Antibody-dependent
  cellular cytotoxicity; Lys: Lysine; T-DM1: Trastuzumab emtansine.'
