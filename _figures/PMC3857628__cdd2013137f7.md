caption: Schematic diagram of the molecular pathways activated in adipocytes upon
  limited nutrient delivery. Ageing is associated with reduced vascularization of
  visceral AT. Resident adipocytes suffer from limited nutrient delivery and metabolically
  adapt to this condition to prevent energetic catastrophe. Upon nutrient starvation
  ATGL upregulation is crucial in preventing adipocytes death and AT inflammation
  via the increase of mitochondrial lipid oxidation. ROS produced by mitochondrial
  proline oxidase are the upstream mediators of the FoxO1-dependent ATGL expression.
  ATGL represents a stress resistance mediator in adipocytes, restraining AT dysfunction
  typical of age-related metabolic disorders. AT, visceral adipose tissue; ATGL, adipose
  triglyceride lipase; CPT1b, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b; FoxO1, forkhead box
  protein O1; FoxO1RE, FoxO1-responsive element; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  pnpla2, patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 2; POX, proline oxidase; PRO,
  proline; P5C, pyrroline 5 carboxylate; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TG, triglycerides
