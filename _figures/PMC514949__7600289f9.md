caption: Multiple pathways involved in tumorigenesis by VEGF-null tumor cells. VEGF-null
  tumor cells secrete PDGF AA (and perhaps CC) to recruit host stromal fibroblasts
  through PDGFR α signaling pathway. The recruited host stromal fibroblasts in turn
  provide VEGF to simulate endothelial cell (EC) and to initiate angiogenesis. The
  stability of tumor vessels is dependent on the interaction between pericytes (PC)
  and endothelial cells (EC) via the PDGFR β signaling pathway.
