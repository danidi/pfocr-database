caption: Overview of key metabolic pathways in neutrophils. Glycolysis is a major
  metabolic pathway in neutrophil cytosol, which converts glucose to pyruvate through
  a series of enzymes and reaction. In the absence of oxygen through anaerobic glycolysis,
  pyruvate gets reduce to lactate, and secreted out. While in the presence of oxygen,
  pyruvate participates in TCA cycle by its conversion to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl
  Co A) that provides reducing energy intermediates NADH and FADH2 which trough ETC
  generate ATPs. Neutrophils also utilize additional pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP)
  by using glucose-6-phosphate, an intermediate of the glycolytic pathway, as an entry
  point and using oxidative and non-oxidative phases produce NADPH and riboses that
  subsequently generate nucleotides. NADPH is critical as key NADPH oxidase dependent
  ROS generation in neutrophils and also regulates redox signaling. Depending on glucose
  abundance, glycogen stores get enriched in neutrophils that on-demand provides glucose
  based glycolytic intermediate supply. TCA cycle intermediate citrate through fatty
  acid synthesis (FAS) can lead to the generation of free fatty acid, while these
  endogenous FFA or transported from the extracellular environment through FAO pathway
  yields acetyl-CoA that fuels TCA cycle and produce significantly more energy in
  form of ATPs. Glutamine through glutaminolysis produces α-ketoglutarate and thus
  supports the TCA cycle. In addition, neutrophils also utilize glycerol-3- phosphate
  shuttle to generate NAD+ from NADH and helps in maintaining mitochondrial membrane
  potential. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ETC, electron transport chain; FAO, fatty
  acid oxidation; NADPH, the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
