caption: Prorenin and renin effects via PRR include Ang II-dependent and independent
  actions. Ang II-dependent actions involve increased catalytic activity of the PRR-bound
  prorenin to generate Ang I from AGT. Ang II-independent action involves intracellular
  signaling that triggers activation of an extracellular signal-related protein kinase
  (ERK1/2) pathway.
