caption: Model depicting how inner ear polarity is generated in response to extracellular
  signals. Wnt signals secreted by the dorsal neural tube (dark green) are necessary
  and sufficient for the regulation of Dlx5/6 in the dorsal otocyst (light green).
  This contrasts with the function of Shh emanating from the notochord (blue), which
  specifies ventral otic cell fates by regulating the transcription of genes, including
  Pax2 and Ngn1 (light blue). The combination of Wnt and Shh signaling activities
  are required for the maintenance of Gbx2 along the dorsomedial side of the otocyst
  (green-blue shading). Shh also restricts Wnt pathway activation, and consequently
  Dlx5/6 expression, to dorsal regions of the otic vesicle. An additional signal secreted
  from the dorsal neural tube, possibly a Bmp family member (red), restricts Shh target
  genes to the ventromedial domain of the otocyst. A balance between these dorsal
  and ventral signals is key to promoting regional identity within the otic epithelium
  with the ultimate goal of coordinating the morphogenesis of vestibular and auditory
  organs.
