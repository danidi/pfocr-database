  description: Simple scheme of photosynthetic energy-metabolite supply for isoprene

    Photosynthesis is the largest sink for ATP provided by photophosphorylation and

    photosynthesis are thought to occur due to feedback inhibition resulting from
    limited recycling of Pi that is incorporated both in the main photosynthetic intermediate  as

    Pi levels drop because processes downstream of immediate CO2 fixation releasing

    of thylakoids further feedback inhibits the entire photosynthetic electron transport
