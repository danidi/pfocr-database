caption: Schematic representation of folate metabolism illustrating the entry of natural
  folates and folic acid into the pathway, and flow of methyl groups towards either
  DNA synthesis or DNA methylation. RFC, reduced folate carrier; hFR, human folate
  receptor; MTR, methionine synthase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase;
  SHMT, serine hydroxymethlytransferase; TS, thymidylate synthase; THF, tetrahydrofolate;
  DHF, dihydrofolate; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; dUMP,
  deoxyuridine monophosphate; dTMP, deoxythymidine monophosphate.
