caption: (A) In the wild-type background, a replication fork stalls spontaneously
  at an ICL and is cleaved. The resulting one-ended DSB is resected to produce ssDNA
  (single-strand DNA), to which RPA-1, RFS-1 and an unknown protein ‘X’ bind. RNF-113
  is proposed to ubiquitinate X, and the ubiquitinated X together with RFS-1 promotes
  replacement of RPA-1 on ssDNA by RAD-51. (B) In the absence of RNF-113, X is not
  ubiquitinated so that RPA-1 cannot be displaced from ssDNA. The presence of RPA-1,
  together with RFS-1 and unmodified X on ssDNA prevents the loading of RAD-51, and
  the DNA intermediate is at a dead end. (C) In the absence of RFS-1, RAD-51 cannot
  be recruited to ssRNA, even though RNF-113 ubiquitinates X on ssDNA. Nevertheless,
  the DNA intermediate with RPA-1 and ubiquitinated X bound is shunted to an error-prone
  repair pathway involving nucleotide excision repair (NER) and translesion DNA synthesis
  (TLS). In the absence of both RNF-113 and RFS-1, the DNA intermediate with RPA-1
  and unmodified X is also shunted to the error-prone repair pathway.
