caption: Target sites and inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway used in GBM. NF-κB signaling
  can be targeted at multiple points to block activity, and a wide range of both specific
  and nonspecific agents have been used for NF-κB inhibition in GBM. The IκK complex
  is the primary regulation point of NF-κB activity and has been targeted by the largest
  number of agents. Downstream of IκK, IκBα degradation has been blocked in GBM using
  either the IκB super repressor or, more nonspecifically, with proteasome inhibitors.
  Depletion of individual NF-κB subunits has also been examined using RNA interference.
