caption: Fig. 7. (A) Schematic depiction of catabolic flow of intracellular taurine.
  Plasma taurine is taken up through the taurine transporter. Cytoplasmic taurine
  is excreted as such or in the form of bile salts like taurocholate. Cytoplasmic
  taurine is imported into mitochondria through a putative mitochondrial taurine transporter
  to be used as a constituent for τm5(s2)U synthesis in mt tRNAs. (B) Possible biosynthetic
  pathway of τm5(s2)U. Mitochondrial trmE (trmE*) is involved in the initial step
  of τm5(s2)U synthesis. After some unidentified steps, mitochondrial taurine is directly
  incorporated into mt tRNAs to build τm5U. Mitochondrial trmU (trmU*) is responsible
  for 2-thio group synthesis of τm5s2U.
