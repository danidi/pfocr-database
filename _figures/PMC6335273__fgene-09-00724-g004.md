caption: The three main features (GSIS, beta cell mass and insulin action) and insulin
  secretion pathway in GK rat. (A) The time course of expression of related genes
  associated with the GSIS (red), insulin action (yellow) and beta cell mass (orange)
  in GK rats. Impaired GSIS appeared early in the first week of life (); insulin sensitivity
  occurred in the first 3 weeks after birth (), and insulin resistance appeared in
  peripheral tissues at the age of 8 weeks (); the beta cell mass reduction started
  as early as fetal age 16 days in GK rat (). (B) Related genes (red) involved in
  the insulin secretion pathway. In this pathway, glucose is transported into the
  beta cells by GLUT2 (coded by Slc2a2) and is phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate
  by glucokinase (Gck). Glucose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis and generates pyruvate.
  The TCA cycle then produces ATP and changes in the ATP/ADP ratio leading to the
  closure of KATP channel which in turn activates the Ca2+ channel by membrane depolarization
  which is required for insulin secretion. In addition, Adcy3, Ptprn2, Bmp4, and Fam3b
  genes were reported to be responsible for calcium transport and activity of Ca2+
  channel.
