caption: PLP and TDP de novo synthesis pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. D‐glyceraldehyde
  3‐phosphate, L‐glutamine, and keto‐D‐ribose 5‐phosphate are converted to PLP by
  the catalytic activity of the SNO1, 2,3 and SNZ1, 2,3 gene products . Gcn4 acts
  as positive regulator of de novo PLP biosynthesis, whereas Bas1 acts as an inhibitor.
  Gcn4 is inhibited by amino acids and activated under amino‐acid starvation. Bas1
  instead is upregulated in the presence of glycine. PN, PM, and PL are imported by
  Tpn1. PN is converted at the expense of ATP to PNP by Bud16 whereupon Pdx3, produces
  PLP and hydrogen peroxide in an oxygen‐dependent reaction. Similarly, PLP can be
  formed starting from PM in two steps by action of Bud16 and Pdx3, with PMP as intermediate.
  Moreover, PL can also be converted to PLP by action of Bud16. PLP is used as cofactor
  or converted to HMP‐P by one of the four homologous enzymes Thi5, Thi11, Thi12,
  and Thi13, under consumption of L‐histidine. HMP‐P is the intermediate for the formation
  of the pyrimidyl moiety of thiamine (shown in cyan). Thi20 and Thi21 further phosphorylate
  HMP‐P to HMP‐PP. The thiazole moiety (shown in yellow) is synthesized by activity
  of Thi4 in a suicide mechanism, leading to HET‐P. HMP‐PP and HET‐P are merged by
  the gene product of THI6 to TMP. The following reaction catalyzed by an acid phosphatase
  (EC number 3.1.3.2) yields thiamine. Thiamine can be taken up with the aid of the
  transporter Thi10. Finally, thiamine is converted to its biologically active form
  TDP under consumption of ATP by Thi80. Pdc2, Thi2, and Thi3 are responsible for
  the upregulation of transcription of THI5/11/12/13, THI20/21, THI6 and THI4. Alcohol
