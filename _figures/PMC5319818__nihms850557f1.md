caption: '[a | NO-mediated mechanisms of tumour cell killing by tumour-associated
  macrophages. Upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in activated
  tumour-associated macrophages leads to the production of high local levels of NO.
  At the same time, macrophages also produce superoxide (O2–) from nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and other cellular sources. Together, NO
  and superoxide form peroxynitrite (ONOO–), a reactive oxidant species. The resulting
  combination of nitrosative and oxidative stress can be cytostatic or cytotoxic to
  certain tumour cell types (the NO-associated component of cell killing is tumour-cell-type
  dependent). In susceptible tumour cells, the NO-mediated cell killing involves the
  inhibition of mitochondrial activity, DNA damage and activation of downstream pathways
  including such as the p53 and caspase activation pathways, culminating in tumour
  cell lysis. These mechanisms can be enhanced by various immunostimulatory therapies
  and/or by supplementation of L-arginine, the substrate of NOS. b | Pro-tumour effects
  of low levels of endogenously produced NO, carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S). Survival and proliferation of the tumour cell is stimulated by gasotransmitter
  production within the tumour. Within the tumour, induction of iNOS and consequently
  elevated levels of NO (top right), induction of haem oxygenase 1 (HO1) and elevated
  levels of CO (middle cancer cell on top of the right side of the graph) and/or induction
  of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and elevated levels of H2S (bottom right) can
  exert pro-survival and pro-proliferative effects. Depending on the gasotransmitter,
  these signalling mechanisms can culminate in upregulation of fibroblast growth factor
  2 (FGF2), activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), upregulation of tissue
  inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs), activation of PI3K, and/or the
  stimulation of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase (COX2). In addition to tumour-autonomous
  effects, each gasotransmitter can diffuse out from the tumour cells and can stimulate
  intra- and peritumour angiogenesis through paracrine actions on endothelial cells,
  for instance by stimulating various pro-angiogenic pathways (including the cyclic
  GMP–protein kinase G (PKG) signalling pathway, activation of protein kinase C (PKC),
  RAF, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1) and ERK2, and stabilization
  of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)). Although the signalling mechanisms are
  gasotransmitter- and condition-dependent, the ultimate result is the stimulation
  of peritumour angiogenesis and an increase in tumour blood flow.'
