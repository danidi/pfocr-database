caption: A schematic for DSB repair by HR and NHEJ pathways. DSBs can be repaired
  by either HR or NHEJ. New players (RAD51C and POLN/HEL308) in the HR pathway are
  displayed in the left side of the figure, and are described in detail below. For
  initiation of HR, DSB ends must be resected to expose 3′ overhangs of ssDNA by the
  exonuclease activity of CtIP. The exposed ssDNA is rapidly coated with RPA. RPA
  is then replaced by RAD51, the step facilitated by BRCA1, PALB2, and BRCA1. A mediator
  protein, RAD52, also helps RAD51 loading (not shown). The resulting ssDNA–RAD51
  presynaptic filaments are capable of invading the homologous region in the nearby
  duplex DNA, forming a triplex DNA called a D-loop. DNA polymerases further extend
  DNA synthesis (possibly by combined or redundant activities of POLη, POLδ, and POLN),
  and the recombination intermediates are finally resolved to complete the repair
  (not shown). RAD51C, one of the five RAD51 paralogs found in human cells, appears
  to promote loading of RAD51 (required for RAD51 foci formation) at an early step
  of HR. RAD51C—by forming a complex with another paralog, XRCC3—may also act to resolve
  Holliday junctions at the later step of HR (). NHEJ directly seals two DSB ends
  and does not generally require DSB end resection. Binding of Ku70–80 heterodimer
  (the regulatory subunits of DNA-PK) at DSB ends recruits DNA-PKcs. The activated
  DNA-PKcs recruits DNA ligase IV (LIG4), which subsequently joins two broken DNA
  ends. NHEJ can occur without homology, such as ligation between two blunt ends or
  ends with overhangs that can be processed by resection or fill-in. Recent studies
  suggested that the MRE11 nuclease may function in end processing () A minor form
  of NHEJ, microhomology-directed NHEJ, is not described here to keep simplicity.
  In addition to these “core” NHEJ proteins, other factors, such as MRE11 of the MRN
  complex, regulate certain types of NHEJ (; ).
