caption: Post-translational modification of the processivity factor for eukaryotic
  DNA polymerases, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), by ubiquitin-like modifiers
  results in the recruitment of specific proteins that otherwise display weak interactions
  with PCNA. In response to DNA damage, monoubiquitylation of PCNA by the yeast E2
  conjugating enzyme Rad6 and the E3 ligase Rad18 recruits translesion polymerases
  and results in error-prone damage bypass. After monoubiquitylation, polyubiquitylation
  of PCNA by an E2 complex – comprising ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13 (Ubc13) and
  the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant Mms2 – and the ubiquitin E3 ligase Rad5
  results in error-free repair, although the specific factors recruited are not clear.
  PCNA is also modified by small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) on Lys164 during
  S phase by the E2 enzyme ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9) and the SUMO
  E3 ligase Siz1, and on Lys127 by Ubc9, Siz1 and Siz2. This results in recruitment
  of the ATP-dependent DNA helicase Srs2 to inhibit recombination during replication.
