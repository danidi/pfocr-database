caption: 'The seven structural genes controlling each step of carotenoid synthesis
  from IPP in X. dendrorhous are shown. The encoded enzymes are in parenthesis, and
  intermediary carotenoids are listed to the left of the pathway. The chemical structures
  of the precursors and of the majors’ carotenoids produced are represented. Abbreviations:
  IPP: isopentenyl pyrophosphate, DMAPP: dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, FPP: farnesyl
  pyrophosphate, GGPP: geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.'
