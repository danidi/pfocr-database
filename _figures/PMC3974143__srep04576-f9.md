caption: In the central nervous system, damaged cells (top) release ATP, glutamate
  and K+ into a narrow extracellular space and thus can reach concentrations approximating
  those in the cytoplasm. Extracellular ATP binds to purinergic receptors, including
  P2X7R, activating it and also activating the Panx1 channel through intracellular
  signaling cascade. ATP efflux through the Panx1 channel then provides a positive
  feedback for P2X7R activation. Under normal circumstances this positive feedback
  would be interrupted by the inhibition of the Panx1 channel by extracellular ATP.
  Increased [K+]o renders this negative feedback loop ineffective as shown in the
  present study. In addition, [K+]o stimulates Panx1 directly. P2X7R and/or Panx1
  signal to the inflammasome and thereby activate caspase-1. In addition, caspase-3
  gets activated through an unknown pathway (present study). Panx1 is a substrate
  of caspase-3 and its cleavage results irreversibly in constitutive channel activity.
  Cell death thus is a combination of apoptotic events combined with the rundown of
  all membrane gradients for small molecules due to the permanently active Panx1 channel.
