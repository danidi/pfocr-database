caption: Rad6-Rad18-dependent and Rad51-, Rad52-, and Rad54-dependent pathways for
  replication of UV-damaged DNA in yeast. It is proposed (see text for details) that
  Rad5-mediated PRR is restricted to the leading strand and that Rad proteins 51,
  52, and 54, which are also likely to involve the other proteins that function with
  this group, such as Rad55 and Rad57, promote lesion bypass on the lagging strand.
  Further, it is suggested that both of the PRR pathways utilize nonrecombinational
  means that involve fork regression and template switching mediated by Rad5 () and
  the SDSA pathway, in which the Rad51-coated ss nucleoprotein filament formed on
  the strand with the 3′-OH terminus from the gapped region on the lagging strand
  invades the duplex on the leading strand side, and this is followed by D-loop formation,
  synthesis, and reannealing reactions (, ).
