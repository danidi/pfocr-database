caption: 'An extensive literature search revealed that the candidate genes are cross-linked
  to 3 signaling pathways: NF-κB, Akt and MAPK, which all play a role in cancer. NF-κB
  signaling pathway has a crucial role in regulating immune responses, whereas Akt
  signaling has been shown to inhibit the growth of GBM cells and GBM stem-like cells
  that may also be impaired by MAPK signaling disruption. Because of the RT-qPCR results,
  CTSK''s role has been examined and it was found via cross linking to other candidate
  genes obtained via osteopontin (OPN) gene functions.'
