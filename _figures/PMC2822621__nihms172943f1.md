caption: Activation of cell-surface receptors by insulin triggers a signalling cascade
  in the cell that is mediated by the enzyme PI3K and subsequently by FOXO transcription
  factors. Kalaany and Sabatini find that dietary restriction reduces the activity
  of this pathway in some tumour cells, thereby enhancing cell death and reducing
  tumour size. However, tumours in which this pathway is constitutively active — owing
  to mutations in PI3K or in the PTEN enzyme, which normally counteracts PI3K — are
  resistant to the beneficial effects of dietary restriction.
