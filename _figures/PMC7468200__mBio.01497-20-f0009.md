caption: Proposed Wbp/Vim pathway for the synthesis of the linking sugars in P. gingivalis
  and T. forsythia. The Wbp pathway is modeled on the work previously published on
  P. gingivalis (). The new additions are the steps catalyzed by VimE, VimA, and PGN_1234
  (WbpS) based on the evidence presented in this study. The function of the predicted
  epimerase (BFO_2566) has not been experimentally tested. The sequence of the first
  4 steps catalyzed by WbpA/B/E/D is well established, but it is not known whether
  VimA/E are dependent on the Wbp pathway. The specificities and, hence, positions
  in the pathway of WbpI and WbpS are also not known.
