caption: THP-1 cells were pretreated with vehicle or DCA (30 min) followed by stimulation
  with LPS (1 μg/ml) as described in . Biochemicals in the transsulfuration pathway
  were measured, and box plots of the levels of selected analytes in the pathway shown.
  Significant differences are indicated for LPS relative to untreated cells (LPS)
  or DCA pretreatment relative to LPS (DCA+LPS) for each corresponding time point.
  Green boxes indicate a significant difference (p≤0.05) between the groups shown;
  metabolite ratio of <1.00. Light green boxes indicate narrowly missed the statistical
  cutoff for significance 0.05<p<0.10; metabolite ratio of <1.00. Red boxes indicate
  a significant difference (p≤0.05) between the groups shown; metabolite ratio of
  ≥1.00. N=5.
