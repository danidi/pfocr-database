caption: Potential proangiogenic mechanisms activated in the omentum during transcoelomic
  EOC metastasis in the presence of anti-VEGF therapy. Malignant ovarian cancer cells
  create aggregates as a result of an adaptive metastatic process. Once omental implantation
  is established, the micrometastasis starts to secrete proinvasive factors. This
  leads to a “switching” of the omental microvasculature toward a proangiogenic phenotype.
  Secreted proteases and protease inhibitors [MMPs, CD and CL, urokinase (uPA), and
  PAI-1] interplay to remodel the ECM allowing the omental ECs to migrate, whereas
  cancer-derived VEGF and HGF promote vascularization. In the presence of anti-VEGF
  therapy (selective inhibition of the VEGFA proangiogenic pathway; represented by
  SU5416 = Semaxanib), c-Met signaling may be favored, contributing to the omental
  angioarchitecture. IGFBP-7 and IGFBP-2 intensify the EC angiogenic response, potentially
  facilitating the formation of functional tumor vasculature and EC recruitment, respectively.
  Furthermore, cancer-secreted chemokines (PF4 and CXCL16) fuel protumorigenic inflammatory
  responses in the malignant omentum caused by the migration of distinct proangiogenic
  cell populations. Therefore, the presence of anti-VEGF therapy may amplify the impact
  of alternative proangiogenic transducers, e.g., c-Met in concert with supportive
  factors such as cathepsins, MMPs, chemokines, and IGFBPs, possibly explaining the
  poor efficacy of anti-VEGFA therapies in ovarian cancer patients with transcoelomic
  omental metastasis.
