caption: Engineered pathways for the production of FABCEs. Branched-chain alcohols
  (isobutanol and isoamylol) were produced through the branched-chain amino acid biosynthetic
  pathway by overexpression of alsS, ilvC, ilvD, aro10, and adh2. FABCEs were synthesized
  through esterification of branched-chain alcohols and fatty acyl-CoAs by overexpression
  of ws/dgat. Furthermore, BFABCEs were produced by overexpression of ws/dgat which
  can catalyze esterification of branched-chain alcohols and branched fatty acyl-CoAs
  produced by the overexpression of bckd and fabHB
