caption: Exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the cell membrane,
  rather than its normal location in the inner leaflet, marks apoptotic cells for
  engulfment by phagocytic cells (not shown). During phagocytosis, phosphatidylserine
  is recognized by the membrane receptor BAI1, which normally signals through the
  ELMO/Dock180/Rac1 pathway to drive actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and engulfment
  of apoptotic cells. In muscle cells, however, this pathway does not lead to engulfment
  of apoptotic cells. But Hochreiter-Hufford et al. report that phosphatidylserine–BAI1
  signalling also enhances myoblast fusion — with healthy myoblasts and with the multinucleated
  myotubes — in an ELMO/Dock180/Rac1-dependent manner. The precise mechanism by which
  this occurs remains unclear, but it does not require fusion or engulfment of the
  apoptotic cell.
