caption: ATF6 signaling pathway. ATF6 is synthesized as a transmembrane protein with
  a luminal stress-sensing domain that binds to BiP and a cytosolically oriented transcription-factor
  domain. During ER stress, BiP is released, allowing it to be transported to the
  Golgi, where it is cleaved by S1P and S2P proteases. The liberated transcription
  factor trafficks to the nucleus and upregulates ER chaperones and the XBP1 mRNA.
