caption: (A) In proliferating cells under normoxic conditions, citrate is synthesized
  from both glucose and glutamine. Glucose carbon provides acetyl-CoA through the
  activity of PDH. Glutamine carbon provides oxaloacetate through oxidative mitochondrial
  metabolism dependent on NAD+. Glucose-derived acetyl-CoA and glutamine-derived oxaloacetate
  condense to form citrate via the activity of citrate synthase (CS). Citrate can
  be exported to the cytosol for lipid synthesis. (B) In cells proliferating in hypoxia
  and/or with HIF-1 activation, glucose is diverted away from mitochondrial acetyl-CoA
  and citrate production. Citrate can be maintained through an alternative pathway
  of reductive carboxylation, which we propose to rely on reverse flux of glutamine-derived
  α-ketoglutarate through IDH2. This reverse flux in the mitochondria would promote
  electron export from the mitochondria when the activity of the electron transport
  chain is inhibited because of the lack of oxygen as an electron acceptor. Mitochondrial
  reverse flux can be accomplished by NADH conversion to NADPH by mitochondrial transhydrogenase
  and the resulting NADPH use in α-ketoglutarate carboxylation. When citrate/isocitrate
  is exported to the cytosol, some may be metabolized in the oxidative direction by
  IDH1 and contribute to a shuttle that produces cytosolic NADPH.
