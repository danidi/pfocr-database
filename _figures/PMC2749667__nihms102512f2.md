caption: Nutrient-dependent control of autophagy through the TOR pathway. Amino acids,
  glucose and other nutrients stimulate the protein kinase activity of TOR within
  the multi-component TOR complex 1 (TORC1) through poorly characterized sensing and
  signaling mechanisms. Starvation leads to loss of TORC1 activity, relieving the
  inhibition of the protein kinase Atg1 and leading to induction of autophagy. Overlayed
  on this basic scheme are number of positive and negative feedback mechanisms. Reduced
  TORC1 signaling leads to loss of S6K activity, resulting in both a direct reduction
  in autophagy and an upregulation of insulin signaling. In addition, autophagy is
  intrinsically self-limiting, as the nutrients generated by autophagy can serve to
  activate TORC1 signaling. Mutual inhibition of TOR and Atg1 results in a self-reinforcing
  feedback loop that may amplify changes in nutrient signals. In addition, Akt activity
  is stimulated by the rapamycin-insensitive TOR complex 2, but how this complex is
  regulated is poorly understood. Not shown in this diagram are TOR-independent effects
  of nutrients and Atg1-independent effects of TOR on autophagy.
