caption: Schematic of the primary Staphylococcus aureus wall teichoic acid biosynthetic
  pathway (, ). Following intracellular assembly, the poly(ribitol-phosphate) polymer
  is transported to the outside by a two-component ABC transporter, TarGH, and then
  covalently linked through a phosphodiester bond to the MurNAc sugars of peptidoglycan
  by an unidentified enzyme (, , ). Non-essential WTA pathway enzymes are colored
  green and their deletion leads to an avirulent phenotype. Conditionally essential
  enzymes are colored red and their deletion is lethal in a wildtype background but
  permitted in a ΔtarO or ΔtarA background (, , ). The tailoring enzymes that modify
  the poly(ribitol-phosphate) polymer are omitted for clarity (). In addition to TarI,
  J, and L, all S. aureus strains contain a homologous set of enzymes designated TarI′,
  J′ and K, that direct the synthesis of a distinct WTA polymer, whose cellular function
  remain incompletely understood (, ).
