caption: Sample regulation summary diagrams for E. coli . a) The trpD diagram shows
  inhibition by TrpR (a homodimer, as indicated by the appearance of multiple stacked
  copies) bound to tryptophan, attenuation by tryptophanyl-tRNA, and substrate-level
  regulation of the final complex by tryptophan. b) The oppD diagram shows inhibition
  by several transcription factors (the leucine ligand blocks regulation by Lrp),
  and regulation of translation by a spermidine riboswitch and RNA GcvB with accessory
  protein Hfq (a homosexamer). c) The glnG diagram shows activation and dual regulation
  by several transcription factors, and post-translational modification triggered
  by phosphorylated NtrB.
