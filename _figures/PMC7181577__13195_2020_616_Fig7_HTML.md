caption: The proposed effect of NgR reduction on APP traffic to lysosome through Rho/ROCK2
  pathway. Full-length APP is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported
  to the cell surface or endosomes/lysosomes. Once APP is transported to the cell
  surface, it undergoes amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic processing by β-secretase
  or α-secretase cleavage. While partial APP is internalized and delivered to endosome,
  a fraction of endocytosed APP molecules is recycled back to the cell surface, and
  other fractions are either processed in the endosome to release Aβ or delivered
  to lysosome for degradation. NgR reduction suppresses the downstream Rho/ROCK2 signaling
  pathway which enhances APP traffic to lysosomes, thus may reduce APP distribution
  to other cellular compartments and decrease Aβ production
