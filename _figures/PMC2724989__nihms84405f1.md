caption: Viral ssRNA with 5′-triphosphate group and dsRNA are detected by the cytoplasmic
  pathogen recognition receptors, RIG-I and MDA5, respectively. Viral RNAs also activate
  2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) to synthesize 2′,5′-linked oligoadenylate
  (2–5A) from ATP. 2–5A activates RNase L to cleavage cellular RNAs to yield small
  self-RNA molecules, which are also recognized by RIG-I and/or MDA5. RIG-I and MDA5
  contain N-terminal CARD and C-terminal RNA helicase motifs. In addition, RIG-I contains
  a repressor domain (RD). The RNA-mediated interaction induces conformational changes
  of RIG-1 and MDA5, which leads to the CARD–CARD interaction of RIG-I and MDA5 with
  their adaptor, CARD-containing MAVS (also known as VISA, Cardif and IPS-1) in the
  mitochondrial membrane. These events relay the signal through activation and translocation
  of NF-κB p65–p50 heterodimer and IRF3 as well as IRF7 into the nucleus to activate
  downstream genes that encode α- and β-interferon. The exact roles of TRAF2, TRAF6,
  FADD and RIP1 in this pathway are yet to be defined. Activation of RIG-I by the
  ubiquitin ligase TRIM25-mediated lysine-63-linked ubiquitination is not shown, neither
  is a MAVS-mediated MAP kinase cascade. Red arrows indicate phosphorylation
