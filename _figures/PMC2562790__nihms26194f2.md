caption: A molecular pathway triggered by RAR-β2 for the suppression of human carcinogenesis.
  Benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) exposure is a risk factor in the development
  of esophageal cancer. BPDE is thought to act by suppressing RAR-β2 expression and,
  in turn, upregulating EGFR expression and Erk1/2 phosphorylation, resulting in the
  induction of AP-1 and COX-2 expression. Further, BPDE can educe the expression of
  retinoid receptor-induced gene-1 (RRIG1), perhaps through reduction of RAR-β2. RRIG1
  mediates RAR-β2 effects on the regulation of cancer cell growth and gene expression.
  RRIG1 protein binds to and inhibits RhoA activity and consequently suppresses Erk1/2
  phosphorylation and expression of COX-2 and cyclin D1, resulting in reductions in
  tumor cell colony formation, invasion, and proliferation.
