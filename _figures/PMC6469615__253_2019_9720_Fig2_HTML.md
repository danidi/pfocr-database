caption: 'Proposed metabolic pathway for shea butter biosynthesis adapted from Argout
  et al.  and Baud and Lepiniec . The genes for shea butter biosynthesis were marked
  and the gene numbers were labeled after each gene. Enzymes involved in the pathway
  are listed based on their sequential order and their compartmentalization in plastid
  and ER. Predicted orthologous gene copy numbers in shea tree are indicated in parentheses
  beside each enzyme abbreviation: CAC2, heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase BC subunit;
  BCCP, heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase BCCP subunit; CAC3, heteromeric acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase alpha-CT subunit; ACCD, heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta-CT subunit;
  ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme A; MAT, plastidial malonyl-CoA; ACP malonyltransferase;
  KAS, ketoacyl-ACP synthase; KAR, plastidial ketoacyl-ACP reductase; HAD, plastidial
  hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydrase; ENR1, plastidial enoyl-ACP reductase; FAB2, stearoyl-ACP
  desaturase; FATA, acyl-ACP thioesterase; FATB, acyl-ACP thioesterase; LACS, long-chain
  acyl-CoA synthetase; FAD2, ER oleate desaturase; FAD3, ER linoleate desaturase;
  KCS, β-Ketoacyl-CoA synthase; KCR, ketoacyl-CoA reductase; ECR, enoyl-CoA reductase;
  HmACCase, homomeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase; LPCAT, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase;
  GPAT, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; LPAT, lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase;
  PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase; DGAT, acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase;
  G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; TAG: triacylglycerol. CAC2, BCCP, CAC3, and ACCD are
  the four subunits of ACCase in the plastid. Dashed arrows indicate the four-step
  elongation cycle catalyzed by KAS, KAR, HAD, and ENR1, which is repeated multiple
  times during chain elongation. Orthologous gene number for each enzyme in T. cacao
  was determined as described'
