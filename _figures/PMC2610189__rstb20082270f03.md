caption: Contribution of mGluR1 to synapse elimination during cerebellar development.
  Elimination of redundant climbing fibre synapses on Purkinje cells consists of two
  phases, the early phase (until P10) and the late phase (P10–P20) in mice. The mGluR1
  signal is required for the late phase. Neural activity along mossy fibre (granule
  cell) and parallel fibre (Purkinje cell) pathway, which is gated by NMDA receptor
  at the mossy fibre to granule cell synapses, drives the mGluR1 signalling cascades
  in Purkinje cells. Subsequently, the downstream signalling cascade involving Gq,
  PLCβ4 and PKCγ is activated and, through unknown mechanisms, it facilitates the
  elimination of weaker climbing fibre synapses while leaving stronger climbing fibre
  synapses intact. AMPAR, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor;
  NMDAR, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.
