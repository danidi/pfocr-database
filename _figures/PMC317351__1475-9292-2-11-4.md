caption: 'Comparison of glycolysis in primitive anaerobic organisms and trypanosomatids.
  The consumption of one glucose molecule through glycolysis generates two molecules
  of pyruvate, ATP and NADH. To maintain the redox balance (NAD+/NADH ratio) of the
  cell, NADH produced by GAPDH has to be oxidized to NAD+. In the simplest fermentation
  scheme, the lactic fermentation (panel A), which probably occurred in the primitive
  anaerobic organisms, NAD+ is stochiometrically regenerated by converting pyruvate
  into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase []. A variation of this primitive scheme,
  the "succinic fermentation" (Panel B), is the replacement of the reduction step
  (lactate dehydrogenase) by one carboxylation step (pyruvate carboxylase) followed
  by two reduction steps (MDH and FRD). The consequence of this adaptation is that
  one half of the PEP is converted into succinate to maintain the redox balance, while
  the other half can be used for biosynthetic pathways. In 1980, Gest [] proposed
  that the primitive FRD was soluble and NADH dependent, whereas none of the known
  present-day FRDs possess both characteristics. Interestingly, the trypanosome glycosomal
  FRD is soluble and NADH dependent []. Panel C shows the succinate product pathway
  recently characterized in the procyclic form of T. brucei, which ressembles primitive
  "succinic fermentation". The NAD+, NADH, ADP and ATP molecules produced by this
  pathway are bold faced and underlined, with a special attention to NAD+/NADH which
  are circled. For the boxed glycolytic metabolites (G-3-P, 1, 3BPGA, 3-PGA, PEP and/or
  pyruvate), two molecules are produced per glucose consumed. End products (lactate,
  succinate and acetate) are in white characters on a black background. The metabolic
