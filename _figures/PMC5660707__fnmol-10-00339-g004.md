caption: The identified manganese transport system and its association with AD. On
  the cell membrane, DMT1, ZIP8/ZIP14, and DAT are responsible for Mn2+ influx, while
  Tf/TfR mediates Mn3+ entry into the endosome through endocytosis and is eventually
  released into the cytoplasm by DMT1. In contrast, SLC30A10 and Fpn transport Mn2+
  out of cells. Furthermore, ATP13A2 and SPCA1 also transport Mn2+ into the lysosomes
  and Golgi for bioavailability or by forming secretary vesicles that facilitate Mn2+
  efflux. In the AD brain, Mn2+ exposure induces mitochondrial oxidative stress that
  further advances tau phosphorylation. Moreover, high Mn2+ levels increase the expression
  of p53 and its transcriptional target gene, APLP1, which consists of APP. Increased
  APLP1 expression promotes the generation of Aβ peptides. Mn2+ could also bind to
  Aβ and enhance its aggregation. DAT, dopamine transporter; SLC30A10, solute carrier
  family 30 member 10; ATP13A2, ATPase 13A2; SPCA1, secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase
  1; APLP1, amyloid-b precursor-like protein 1.
