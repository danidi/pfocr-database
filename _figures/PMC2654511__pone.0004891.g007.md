caption: AECII cells initiate an immunity to boost AM anti-infection function. The
  chemokine MCP-1 seems a crucial factor in this cell-cell cross-talk, which may be
  initiated by lipid rafts and regulated by Lyn. While boosting MCP-1 production through
  NFκB pathway, Lyn may contain excessive production of MIP-2α as another mechanism
  to keep the inflammation response in control.
