caption: '(a) Notch-Runx1 signaling controls specification of HSPCs in the ventral
  wall of the dorsal aorta during early embryogenesis. This signaling pathway initiates
  HSPC expression of both the key transcription factor Cmyb and the epigenetic regulator
  Dnmt3bb.1. (b) As development proceeds Runx1 expression is down-regulated and continued
  maintenance of active Cmyb expression in HSPC depends on Dnmt3bb.1–mediated Cmyb
  gene body DNA methylation, ensuring maintenance of HSPC cell fate during the Runx1-independent
  phase.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11813.020'
