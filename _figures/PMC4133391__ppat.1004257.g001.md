caption: Oral epithelial cell discrimination of C. albicans yeast from hyphae is enabled
  via differential MAPK signalling. Recognition of yeast triggers activation of PI3K
  (green) and NF-κB (blue) as well as weak, transient activation of all three MAPK
  pathways (red). This MAPK activation leads to a transient activation of the c-Jun
  transcription factor via JNK/ERK1/2 signalling, with as-yet-unknown transcriptional
  effects. Activation of the PI3K pathway leads to activation of the epithelial damage
  protection and/or prevention response. Exposure of epithelial cells to C. albicans
  hyphae leads to the strong activation of MAPK signalling, resulting in the activation
  of the c-Fos transcription factor via the p38 pathway. At this point, regulation
  of MAPK signalling is initiated by the induction and stabilisation of the MAPK phosphatase,
  MKP1 (via the ERK1/2 pathway), which acts to regulate p38 and JNK signalling. Activation
  of c-Fos in the presence of NF-κB and PI3K signalling leads to the production of
  cytokines and inflammatory mediators, thereby activating immune responses to C.
  albicans.
