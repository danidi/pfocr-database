caption: Schematic representation of the antiangiogenic Sema3E-plexin D1 signaling
  pathway in endothelial cells. The activation of plexin D1 by Sema3E induces the
  association of the Ras GAP domain of plexin D1 with R-Ras, thus sequestering R-Ras,
  and promotes the rapid activation of Arf6, likely by stimulating Arf6 GEFs. This
  results in the inactivation of integrins and their subsequent internalization, respectively,
  thus inhibiting endothelial cell adhesion to the ECM by disrupting integrin-mediated
  adhesive structures and causing filopodial retraction in endothelial tip cells.
  Ultimately, this two-pronged mechanism by which the Sema3E-plexin D1 signaling system
  acts may provide a repulsive cue for endothelial cells, thereby providing protection
  from the aberrant sprouting and growth of new blood vessels.
