caption: β cells receiving glucose signals upon glucose intracellular transportation
  by GLUT2 transporters up-regulate insulin gene positive regulatory factors, e.g.
  PDX-1 and NKx2.2 to enhance insulin gene expression. On the other hand, β cells
  initiate the negative regulatory pathway through up-regulating C-ABL expression,
  and C-ABL in turn down-regulates gene expression of NKx2.2 and its downstream insulin
  gene, as well as GLUT2.
