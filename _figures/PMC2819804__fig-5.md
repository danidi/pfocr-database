caption: PERK signaling pathway. Like Ire1, PERK exists as a BiP-bound monomer under
  normal physiologic conditions. On activation, PERK oligomerizes, and its kinase
  domain is activated. The target of this kinase is a component of the translation-initiation
  complex, EIF2α, which results in a transient inhibition of most cap-dependent translation.
  Downstream of the translational arrest is the activation of NF-κB due to loss of
  IκB, a G1 cell-cycle arrest, and paradoxically, the translation of ATF4, a transcription
  factor that upregulates a number of genes involved in ROS metabolism, as well as
  GADD34, which dephosphorylates eIF2α, allowing translation to resume. (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  web version of this article at www.liebertonline.com/ars).
