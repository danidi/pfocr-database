caption: The progressive activation of IGF1-R signaling in the brain that accompanies
  aging leads to a naturally occurring TrkA to p75NTR switch. The signaling pathway
  downstream of IGF1-R requires IRS2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the lipid
  second messenger phosphatidyilinositol-triphosphate (PIP3), and is under the regulatory
  control of PTEN and p44/p53 [,]. PTEN converts PIP3 into PIP2, whereas p44 downregulates
  PTEN. As a result of p44 overexpression, p44+/+ mice display hyperactivation of
  IGF1-R signaling, premature aging, and an early TrkA to p75NTR switch [,]. The TrkA
  to p75NTR switch requires Egr-1 and Hipk2; Egr-1 activates the transcription of
  p75NTR, whereas Hipk2 downregulates TrkA. This event most likely requires additional
  molecules that provide specificity to the signals mediated by Egr-1 and Hipk2 (indicated
  as a question mark). The downregulation of TrkA is expected to increase the half-life
  and signaling activities of p75NTR (see text), therefore “potentiating” the effects
  caused by the above transcriptional events. Finally, the activation of p75NTR has
  been linked to neuronal death and increased production of Aβ (please, see text).
  The neuronal death may –at least in some extent- be activated by Aβ itself acting
  as a ligand for p75NTR []. The sequence of positive events downstream of IGF1-R
  is shown by the green arrows. The points of inhibitory control are shown in red.
  Finally, the effects caused by Egr-1 and Hipk2 downstream of IGF1-R (described in
  this paper) are in blue.
