caption: 'Aerobic glycolysis in activated immune cells: Activated immune cells undergo
  aerobic glycolysis; there is inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in these cells.
  In addition, there is a selective increase in the pentose phosphate pathway in these
  cells resulting in ribose-5-phosphate to facilitate nucleotide synthesis to support
  cell proliferation.'
