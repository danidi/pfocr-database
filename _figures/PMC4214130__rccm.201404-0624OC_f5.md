caption: Hypothetical pathway analysis depicts mitochondrial dysfunction. Gene-by-metabolite
  associations highlight problems with tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle regulation,
  β-oxidation, branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation, and peroxisomal activation
  likely leading to increased production of various acyl-carnitines, a strong predictive
  signature of poor sepsis outcomes. This mitochondrial dysregulation is likely mediated
  by peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor-γ family transcription factors and/or
  novel zinc finger proteins. Problems with lipid metabolism are manifest in the strong
  association of kynurenine family metabolites and peroxisomal deactivation. Perhaps
  most interesting is the association of succinate with inflammatory gene IL-1β, suggesting
  a potential link to mitochondrial dysfunction and initiation of the inflammatory
  response. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+); key TCA cycle rate-limiting
  enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase 2 (PDP2) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
  2 (PDK2) were down-regulated in high-dose challenges and nonsurvivors.
