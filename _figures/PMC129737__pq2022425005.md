caption: Model for repair of camptothecin-induced replicative damage. The drawing
  depicts selected DNA lesions and repair intermediates (numbered) that might occur
  after a replisome (large oval) collides with a Top1 cleavage complex (small oval).
  The outcomes vary depending on whether Top1 was attached to the leading strand template
  (Top) or lagging strand template (Bottom). Possible repair steps are indicated by
  arrows, including enzymatic reversal of the Top1 cleavage complex by Top1 itself,
  repair that includes Top1 removal by Tdp1, and repair that includes Top1 removal
  by Rad1-Rad10. Smaller pathway arrows indicate less favored possibilities. Arrowheads
  in the drawings indicate DNA synthesis by a replication fork. The dashed line represents
  repair synthesis that must occur before formation of the recombination D-loop. See
  text for further discussion.
