caption: The regulation of rhein on the crosstalk of MAPK signaling pathway. The MAPK
  signaling pathway is activated by the membrane receptors of several pathways, and
  then its downstream pathways are regulated. Rhein acts on multiple sites of these
  pathways to exert the extensive and effective pharmacological activity. The protein
  marked with star is the target of rhein. Red and green star represent negative and
  positive regulation, respectively.

  description: The regulation of rhein on the crosstalk of MAPK signaling pathway.
    The MAPK signaling pathway is activated by the membrane receptors of several pathways,
    and then its downstream pathways are regulated. Rhein acts on multiple sites of
    these pathways to exert the extensive and effective pharmacological activity.
    The protein marked with star is the target of rhein. Red and green star represent
    negative and positive regulation, respectively.
