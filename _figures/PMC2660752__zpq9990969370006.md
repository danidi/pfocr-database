caption: Metabolic origin of glyoxylate in M. extorquens AM1 during growth on methanol.
  The contributions of central metabolic pathways to glyoxylate biosynthesis were
  calculated from the positional isotopomers of glycine measured by NMR. Results are
  expressed relative to methanol uptake, set arbitrarily to 1.0, and confidence intervals
  are given within brackets. TCA indicates tricarboxylic acid cycle; EMCP, ethylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway (); and GRC, glyoxylate regeneration cycle ().
