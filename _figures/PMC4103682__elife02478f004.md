caption: 'Predicted fluxes if (A) major amino acids and the corresponding oxoacids
  and dicarbonic acids are allowed to freely diffuse between cells, (B) the α-ketoglutarate
  and glutamate transfer between mesophyll and bundle sheath was constrained (C) additionally
  the transfer of alanine and pyruvate between mesophyll and bundle sheath was constrained
  (D) transfer of all nitrogen containing compounds except for glycine and serine,
  which are used by the C2cycle were constrained. Fluxes are given in µmol s−1 m−2.
  Values in brackets show minimum and maximum of flux resulting from flux variability
  analysis. Flux of dissolved gasses, sucrose, inorganic compounds and processes that
  carry flux below 1 µmol s−1 m−2 are not shown. The sums of absolute fluxes over
  the plasmodesmata for the different variants were (A): 17.8 µmol s−1 m−2; (B): 18.4
  µmol s−1 m−2; (C): 19.0 µmol s−1 m−2; (D): 22.1 µmol s−1 m−2. See  for plasmodesmatal
