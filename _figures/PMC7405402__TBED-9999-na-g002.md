caption: Cell cycle of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the host cells. The virus goes into the target
  cells via direct membrane fusion (a) or a clathrin‐mediated endosomal pathway (b).
  Binding of the surface unit of the S protein (S1) to angiotensin‐converting enzyme
  2 (ACE2) facilitates the viral attachment. Viral fusion is primed by TMPRSS2, and
  the active spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 acquires an RGD motif (in itsS1 domain) known
  to bind integrins. The attachment to integrin may play an auxiliary role in ACE2
  binding, like simplifying endocytosis by signalling through the integrin. RGD is
  not found in other coronaviruses. The viral RNA is unveiled by the effect of endosomal
  cathepsins at low pH. Following, the replicase gene of the viral genome is translated
  into large polyproteins which are cleaved by the proteases to yield 16 non‐structural
  proteins (nsps). In consequence of replication, transcription and translation, assembly
  of nucleocapsids with RNA and N proteins is occurred in the cytoplasm, followed
  by budding into golgi intermediate compartment. Then, the enveloped virus is exocytosed.
  Plausible drugs inhibiting each step of the cycle are indicated in light blue boxes
