caption: Deregulated focal adhesion pathway in NSCLC cell lines. Key focal adhesion
  proteins underwent either up-regulation (shown by violet color) or down-regulation
  (blue color) in NCIH1755 cell line compared to NCI-H1703 cell line. CRKL was identified
  with novel N-terminal peptide in NCI-H1703 (blue lightning). Three proteins, ITGB,
  FAK, and ACTB, which are not identified in our data were shown by dash circle.
