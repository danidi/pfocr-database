caption: Inflammatory signaling pathways activate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)
  which converts tryptophan to the neuroactive metabolite intermediary kynurenine.
  IDO activation is thought to compete with tryptophan hydroxylase (TH) metabolism
  of serotonin (5-HT). Kynurenine is then metabolized by kynurenine hydroxylase to
  kynurenic acid, which activates α7 nicotinic receptors leading to inhibition of
  the presynaptic release of dopamine. However, kynurenine is also metabolized via
  the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) pathway to QUIN, a potent activator of NMDA
  receptors and lipid peroxidation, which is thought to underlie the neurotoxic effects
  of IDO activation. Inflammatory signals also activate P38 MAPK, which phosphorylates
  the serotonin transport (5HTT), increasing the uptake of serotonin. (AAAD=aromatic
  amino acid decarboxylase)
