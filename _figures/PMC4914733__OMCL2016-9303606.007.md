caption: Proposed signaling mechanisms mediated by Lipoxin A4 in preventing intestinal
  epithelium cells from intestine ischemia reperfusion (IIR) injury. Lipoxin A4 promotes
  Keap1 dissociation from Nrf2 and leads to Nrf2 translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus,
  resulting in enhancing downstream HO-1 gene expression without binding to the Lipoxin
  A4 receptor (ALXR). Antioxidant enzyme HO-1 could possibly reduce cytochrome C release
  from mitochondria and decrease lipid peroxidative product 15-F2t-Isoprostane and
  elevate cell antioxidant ability evidenced by increase of superoxide dismutase (SOD)
  and finally decrease cells apoptosis. In addition, Lipoxin A4 binding to ALXR could
  also reduce damage of diamine oxidase (DAO) products, D-lactic acid (DLA), and intestinal-type
  fatty acid-binding protein (FABP2) release with other mechanisms.

    Lipoxin A4 binding to ALXR could also reduce damage of diamine oxidase (DAO) products,
