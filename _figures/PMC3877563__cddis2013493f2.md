caption: Pathways of necrosis. Necrosis can be elicited by a wide range of stimuli.
  Activation of DRs such as Fas and TNFR or cellular stresses induces the interaction
  and activation of the kinases RIP1 and RIP3. Necrotic death stimuli can also activate
  PARP-1, which can potentially induce necrosis either through activation of the RIP
  kinases or another signaling pathway. Activation of necrosis by RIP1/RIP3 and PARP-1
  is thought to occur through cathepsin release, increased ROS production, ATP depletion,
  and calpain activation. Necrostatin 1 is a small molecule inhibitor of RIP1
