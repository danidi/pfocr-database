caption: A model for mesenchymal stem cell dysfunction in HGPS. In wild-type mesenchymal
  stem cells (MSC; left), Notch signaling, which operates through the cleavable and
  nuclear-penetrating Notch intracellular domain (NICD), is active at basal levels,
  resulting in basal expression of Notch downstream targets, including Hes1, Hes3,
  Hes5, Hey1, Hey2, and TLE1. In Hutchison-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), Notch
  signaling is increased in mesenchymal stem cells (right), leading to an increase
  in the expression of Notch pathway genes and to perturbed differentiation, including
  increased osteogenesis and decreased adipogenesis. INM, inner nuclear membrane.
