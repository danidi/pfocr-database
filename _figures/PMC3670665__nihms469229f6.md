caption: A. Inhibitory stress kinase regulation of insulin signaling and heat shock
  protein (HSP) expression. Oxidative stress in muscle activates stress kinases c-Jun
  NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and inhibitor of nuclear factor (IKKβ). These stress kinases
  serine phosphorylate the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and decrease insulin
  signaling by blocking IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Decreased signaling through
  Akt leads to increased activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), which can
  feedback and further increase IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. GSK-3 and JNK also can
  serine phosphorylate the HSP transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), on
  serine residues (Ser) 303 and 363, respectively. Chronic serine phosphorylation
  of HSF-1 by GSK-3 and JNK can inhibit HSF-1 and the HSP response. A decreased HSP
  response could result in the development and/or acceleration of a number of oxidative
  stress-related disease states, including insulin resistance. Open shapes represent
  inactive proteins, dark filled shapes represent active proteins. B. Modulating HSPs
  to inhibit stress kinases and improve insulin signaling. Heat stress, exercise,
  and pharmacological interventions increase HSPs expression in skeletal muscle. Exercise
  could stimulate HSP expression through a pathway independent of heat stress, whereas
  GSK-3–dependent activation of HSF-1 may be a common pathway of HSP activation. These
  pathways indicate the complex interregulatory relationship of stress kinases, insulin
  signaling, and HSP in skeletal muscle. Open shapes represent inactive proteins,
  dark filled shapes represent active proteins. ROS, reactive oxygen species.
