caption: 'The Rho GDP–Rho GTP signaling pathway from membrane to the cytosol. With
  the binding of Rho GDI to Rho-GDP, inactivated Rho-GDP is extracted from the membrane
  to the cytosol. When cells are stimulated with certain agonists, Rho-GDP is converted
  to Rho-GTP through the action of Rho GEF. Rho-GTP is then targeted to the specific
  targets. Rho GAP inactivates Rho by dephosphorylating GTP to GDP. The downstream
  effector of Rho is ROCK. Stimulation of GPCR also leads to ROCK activation via Rho
  GEF. Activated ROCK, mediated through, phosphorylates various downstream targets
  including the MBS of MLCP. Phosphorylation of MBS inhibits MLCP activity leading
  to increased MLC phosphorylation and actomyosin activation. Abbreviations: CaM,
  calcium/calmodulin; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; MBS, myosin-binding subunit;
