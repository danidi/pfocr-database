caption: Patterning the DV axis in Drosophila and Tribolium. (A–C) DV patterning cascade
  of Drosophila. (A) In the ovary, localization of grk mRNA (red) around the oocyte
  nucleus leads to the activation of the EGF pathway (blue) in the follicle cells,
  restricting pipe expression to the ventral follicle cells. (B) In the perivitelline
  space, ECM components modified by pipe lead to the localized activation of a protease
  cascade and, ultimately, to the activation of Spz, which binds and activates the
  Toll receptor. (C) In the embryo, Toll activation leads to phosphorylation and degradation
  of Cact, allowing nuclear translocation of Dorsal in a ventral-to-dorsal gradient
  (purple circles) where it regulates the expression of target genes. Components of
  the BMP (sog, dpp, and tld) and EGF (rho) signaling pathways and a regulator of
  Notch (N) signaling (sna) activated by different thresholds of Dorsal concentration
  are shown on the left side of the split embryonic cross-section. On the right side,
  tissue-specific target genes that integrate input from one or more of these pathways
  with that of Dorsal concentration are shown. (D–F) DV patterning cascade of Tribolium.
  (D) Like Drosophila, EGF signaling is activated in association with the position
  of the oocyte nucleus. However, mRNA for the ligand (tgfα) is not localized. Targets
  of EGF signaling have not yet been identified in the Tribolium ovary, and it is
  not clear how patterning information is transmitted to the embryo. (E) Preliminary
  evidence indicates that the protease cascade and Spz are required for Toll activation,
  but how or whether these events are restricted to the ventral perivitelline space
  is not known (indicated by ???). (F) Unlike Drosophila, there is considerable feedback
  regulation at the zygotic level in the Tribolium DV patterning system. As in C,
  the left half of the cross-section illustrates the expression of signaling pathway
  components just before gastrulation, while the right half shows the expression of
  target genes of Dorsal and/or downstream signaling pathways. For EGF signaling,
  the pathway has been shown to be activated laterally, but it has not been demonstrated
  that it has direct input into vnd or sim expression.
