caption: Possible model for indole signaling in E. coli. The tnaAB operon is depicted
  and is activated by CRP-cAMP as nutrients are depleted. This results in indole production
  via the TnaA (tryptophanase) enzyme. The indole is secreted and acts as an extracellular
  signal. The components of the signal response pathway are unknown and are indicated
  by a question mark.
