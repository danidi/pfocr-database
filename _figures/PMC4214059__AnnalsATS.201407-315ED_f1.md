caption: A causal model specifying how genetic variation increases the susceptibility
  to clinical disease through smoking and alternate pathways (). In this example,
  the observed increased likelihood of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary
  disease (COPD) associated with the CHRNA5/A3/B4 region is partitioned into a smoking-related
  pathway of smoking behaviors (e.g., nicotine dependence as measured by the Fagerström
  Test of Nicotine Dependence [FTND]) () and exposure to smoking, as measured by exhaled
  carbon monoxide, and an alternate unspecified pathway. The alternate pathways may
  be biological; that is, CHRNA5/A3/B4 has additional effects beyond smoking or may
  relate to experimental variability in the smoking-related traits.
