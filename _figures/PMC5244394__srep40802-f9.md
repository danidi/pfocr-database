caption: (a) In gastric cancer cells, cytoplasm ChAT protein catalyzes ACh synthesis,
  then ACh is secreted and released into the extracellular space, the extracellular
  ACh could combine and activate M3 receptor located in cytomembrane of cells, following
  activating EGFR signaling, and then leading to the increasement of p-ERK1/2 and
  p-AKT, thus, promote gastric cancer cell proliferation and survival. (b) When the
  function of M3R was blocked by specific antagonists (such as 4-DAMP), or its downstream
  effector EGFR, inhibited by specific inhibitor AG1478, the auto-stimulating role
  of ACh in cell proliferation will be weaken in some degree. The M3R/EGFR signaling
  inhibitors can enhance the chemosensitivity of 5-Fu and reduce cell viability in
  gastric cancer. The combined strategy may provide a feasible strategy for gastric
  cancer therapy.
