caption: Drosophila IMD pathway. Recognition of DAP-type PGN by the cell surface receptor
  PGRP-LC or the cytosolic receptor PGRP-LE triggers the IMD pathway. DAP-type PGN
  forms the cell wall of most Gram-negative bacteria and some Gram-positive bacteria,
  such as Bacillus spp. and Listeria. Extracellularly, detection of polymeric and
  monomeric PGN (TCT) occurs through homo or heterodimers of PGRP-LC splice forms,
  as depicted. PGRP-LE detects intracellular bacteria and stimulates the IMD pathway
  as well as an autophagic response. PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE signaling proceeds through
  IMD, FADD and the caspase DREDD, which are likely to form a complex on the activated
  receptor. DREDD-dependent cleavage of IMD exposes an IAP-binding motif in IMD, through
  which it binds DIAP2. This IMD-DIAP2 association leads to robust K63-ubiquitination
  of cleaved IMD by DIAP2, Uev1a, Bendless (Ubc13) and Effete (Ubc5). These K63-polyubiquitin
  chains are likely to serve as a scaffold for the recruitment and activation of the
  TAK1 kinase complex and the IKK complex. Once activated, TAK1 in turn activates
  both IKK and JNK kinase. Relish is phosphorylated by IKK and cleaved by DREDD to
  release the fully active N-terminal RHD for translocation into the nucleus and the
  transcriptional induction of AMP genes and other targets. The concurrent activation
  of JNKK leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of AP-1
