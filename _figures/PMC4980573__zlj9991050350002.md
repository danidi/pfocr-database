caption: The programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunologic checkpoint. PD-1 is
  expressed on activated T cells. Interactions between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1
  and PD-L2, are complex and occur at multiple steps of an immune response. For illustration,
  we have shown an interaction early after activation in the lymph node where PD-L1/PD-L2
  on an antigen-presenting cell (dendritic cell shown) negatively regulates T-cell
  activity through PD-1 and through an interaction between B7 and PD-L1. The PD-1
  pathway is also likely important in the tumor microenvironment where PD-L1 expressed
  by tumors interacts with PD-1 on T cells to suppress T-cell effector function. MHC,
  major histocompatibility complex.
