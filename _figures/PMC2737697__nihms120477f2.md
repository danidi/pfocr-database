caption: 'Note that these are proposed models and it is possible, even likely, that
  the mechanism(s) by which these genes confer risk for SLE involve not only the pathways
  presented, but also other pathways.a | Phagocytosis. A presumed environmental trigger
  (for example, UV irradidation, viral infection or dysregulated apoptosis) leads
  to activation of antigen presenting cells which phagocytose self-antigen coated
  by opsonins (e.g. C3b), which are bound by their respective receptors (e.g. ITGAM).
  This leads to subsequent APC activation and presentation of self-antigen to host
  lymphocytes. This pathway potentially plays a role in disease initiation and perpetuation.
  In terms of initiation, a tendency towards antigen-presenting cell hyperactivation
  is a path toward loss of self-tolerance. In terms of perpetuation, when immune complexes
  are not cleared, this leads to the production of autoantibodies. [C1q: Complement

  Recent data () suggest that TREX1 digests cytosolic DNA and prevents activation
  of a cell-intrinsic type I interferon (notably, interferon-α) response pathway (see
  ). Similarly, activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs – notably TLR7, TLR8, and
  TLR9) on ligand recognition (CpG DNA or ssRNA) leads to production of type I interferon
  by immune cells, notably plasmacytoid dendritic cells and the interferon responsive
  gene expression signature observed in lupus serum. [CpG DNA: DNA containing CpG
  dinucleotides; ssRNA: single-stranded RNA; TLR: toll-like receptor; IRAK1: Interleukin-1
  receptor associated kinase-1; TNFAIP: Tumor necrosis factor-α induced protein 3

  | Immune Signal Transduction: Various stages in the life-cycle of lymphocytes are
  important for the development of the autoreactive B-cell clones, which produce the
  pathological autoantibodies observed in SLE. Here we focus on activation events.
  Self-antigen recognition by B-cells starts at the B-cell receptor (membrane IgM),
  where the balance of positive (B-cell receptor cross-linking) and negative signals
  (FCGR2B ligation) are transduced via intracellular kinases, such as BLK and BANK1,
  leading to B-cell activation. A similar process, leading to T cell activation occurs
  after uptake of the self-antigen and presentation on a class II MHC molecule, such
  as HLA-DR to a CD4+ T lymphocyte, which subsequently provides “Help” to B lymphocytes.
  It should be noted that autoreactive clones must avoid deletion before activation
  events can lead to florid autoimmunity. [BCR: B cell receptor; FCGR2B: Fc fragment
