caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for iso-MGS as well as MGS and the DGNs according
  to module and domain organization of MgsCD glutarimide biosynthesis enzymes, the
  MgsEFG AT-less type I PKSs and the MgsH discrete AT, and the MgsIJH post-PKS tailoring
  enzymes. A, biosynthesis of glutarimide starter unit (heavy bonds denote intact
  incorporation from malonate) and B, overview of the iso-MGS biosynthetic machinery
  featuring the iso-MGS AT-less type I PKS with 8-desmethoxy-17-hydroxy-iso-MGS as
  the nascent intermediate en route to iso-MGS and its subsequent H2O-mediated, non-enzymatic
  ring-expansion and ring-opening rearrangements to MGS and the DGNs. The ACP domain
  indicated with an overlaid X is nonfunctional, black ovals denote AT-docking domains,
  and the domain with a question mark denotes an unknown function.
