caption: Hypothetical scheme for bacteria-regulated intestinal stem cells and tumorigenesis.
  (A) Enteric bacteria and their products (e.g., the effector protein AvrA) induce
  ROS and inflammation, leading to the activation of the JAK-STAT, JNK, and/or Wnt
  pathways. These pathways act as a homeostatic compensatory mechanism to replenish
  apoptotic enterocytes and replace damaged tissue by stem cell proliferation and
  differentiation. The stem cell proliferation and differentiation are well-balanced.
  (B) In an intestine containing mutated cells (APC mutation, Ras mutation, or PTEN
  knockout), the bacteria-induced chronic inflammation and activation of Wnt and JAK-STAT
  pathways result in an increased number of cell stem cells. Bacterial proteins and
  products, such as AvrA, participate in the activation of Wnt pathway in the intestine.
  This uncontrolled inflammation and hypoproliferation then leads to dysplasia and
  eventually the development of a tumor.
