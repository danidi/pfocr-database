caption: Reactions involved in chromophore regeneration in rod and cone photoreceptors.
  Rod pigment regeneration is limited to the canonical pathway where RPE65 isomerises
  11-cis-RAL from RE. Isomerization occurs independently of RPE65 in the cone specific
  pathway, involving the Müller glia. CRALBP is thought to be the primary 11-cis retinoid
  carrier in both pathways.
