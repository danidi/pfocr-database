caption: Schematic diagram illustrates how tilorone and hypoxia may share common mechanisms
  in the mediation of the preconditioning response. 1) Tilorone is believed to intercalate
  into DNA, and its mechanisms for inducing the anti-viral response are unknown. 2)
  Hypoxia leading to secondary increases in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA damage can
  result in accumulation of cytosolic DNA. Under normal conditions, TREX1, a cytosolic
  DNA endonuclease, can degrade accrued cytosolic DNA. However, it is possible that
  tilorone could stabilize cytosolic DNA by binding to it and thereby suppress TREX1
  activity leading to activation of cGAS synthase. Activation of cGAS synthase catalyzes
  the formation of cGAMP from ATP and GTP. 3) As an alternative to binding to cytosolic
  DNA, tilorone could be an agonist of the ER adaptor protein STING. STING activation
  leads to the recruitment of the kinase TBK1 and consequent phosphorylation of IRF3.
  Phosphorylated IRF3 translocates to nucleus to induce a cassette of interferon genes
  involved in innate immunity preconditioning. As a DNA binding drug, tilorone could
  also bind to nuclear DNA to enhance IRF3-mediated transcription downstream of STING.
