caption: Figure 6. Schematic representation depicting the interactions between the
  different molecular intermediates studied. The scheme proposes that the increase
  of oxidative stress activates, by 4-HNE, PPARβ/δ, which, in turn, triggers the decrease
  of TrkBfl. On the other hand, the oxidative stress, through a not well-identified
  pathway (PPARβ/δ-dependent?), increases pro-BDNF and the ratio ICD/p75NTR with concomitant
  increase of neuronal death.
