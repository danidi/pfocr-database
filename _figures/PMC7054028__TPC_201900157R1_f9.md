caption: Hypothetical Model of TOR Kinase Function in the Regulation of Pro Metabolism
  and Amino Acid Respiration in General.(A) Regulation of Pro metabolism.(B) Amino
  acid respiration in general.Amino acids activate the plant TOR pathway by yet-undiscovered
  mechanisms. Activation of TOR inhibits amino acid catabolism and respiration by
  targeting the expression of amino acid catabolic genes, consistent with previous
  transcriptomic results. At the same time, TOR activation promotes anabolic pathways,
  partly via S6K phosphorylation, as a metabolic destination for amino acids. In this
  way, the presence of amino acids contributes to an overall signal of nutrient abundance
  in mature leaves.
