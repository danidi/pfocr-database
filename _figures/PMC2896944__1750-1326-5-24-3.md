caption: Hsp90 shelters aberrant neuronal proteins. (A) Aberrant neuronal proteins
  regulated by Hsp90. To tolerate the accumulation of dysregulated processes and to
  allow the development of the disease phenotype, the functional stability of these
  aberrant processes likely requires a "buffering" mechanism, such as offered by Hsp90.
  These aberrant neuronal proteins activities develop Hsp90-dependency and promote
  disease progression. (B) Pharmacologic Hsp90 inhibition results in inactivation
  or degradation of Hsp90-regulated proteins, mainly by a proteasomal pathway.
