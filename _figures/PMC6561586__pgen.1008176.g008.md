caption: During isolation, the up-regulation of NPF2 signal suppresses the NOS transcription
  by inhibiting CREB-B phosphorylation catalyzed by PKA, thus reducing locomotor activity.
  Upon crowding, the down-regulation of NPF2 signal promotes PKA activity, which in
  turn activates CREB-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription and consequently enhanced
  locomotor activity. Blue dots in the locust brain indicate NPF2 localization. Bold
  indicates increased levels or activity.
