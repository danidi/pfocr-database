caption: Schematic illustration of LEF1/CYLD and cIAPs in the modulation of RIP1 deubiquitination
  and triggering of apoptosis via caspase-8. Selenite treatment caused the upregulation
  of CYLD transcription via LEF1 and cIAP degradation, which triggered RIP deubiquitination
  and subsequent caspase-8 activation. Activated caspase-8 cleaved the cytoplasmic
  protein Bid to generate tBid, which translocated to the mitochondria and triggered
  the endogenous apoptosis pathway. In addition, caspase-8 initiated the extrinsic
  apoptosis pathway through direct activation of executioner caspases
