caption: 'Metabolite abbreviations are, Phe: L-phenylalanine (VMH [] ID: phe_L), Tyr:
  L-tyrosine (VMH ID: tyr_L), L-DOPA: levodopa (VMH ID: 34dhphe), DA: dopamine (VMH
  ID: dopa), BH4: tetrahydrobiopterin (VMH ID: thbpt), BH2: dihydrobiopterin (VMH
  ID: dhbpt). Internal reactions are labelled R1–R4. R1 (dashed lines) is the phenylalanine
  hydroxylase reaction (VMH ID: r0399). R2 (dotted lines) is the tyrosine hydroxylase
  reaction (VMH ID: TYR3MO2 and THBPT4ACAMDASE). R3 (dash-dotted lines) is the DOPA
  decarboxylase reaction (VMH ID: 3HLYTCL). R4 (solid line) is a composite of the
  formate dehydrogenase reaction (VMH ID: FDH) and the dihydropteridine reductase
  reaction (VMH ID: DHPR). Exchange reactions are labelled E1–E6. The hydrogen ion
  (H+) exchange reaction E7 was omitted to simplify the figure. Atoms are numbered
  according to their order in each metabolite’s molfile. Atoms of different elements
  are numbered separately, in colours matching their elemental symbol. Atoms belonging
  to the same conserved moiety have identically coloured backgrounds.'
