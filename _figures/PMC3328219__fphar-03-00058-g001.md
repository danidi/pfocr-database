  Upon dietary intake and intestinal absorption, retinoids, and carotenoids are converted
  to retinol, which is bound to CRBP-II. Retinol is further processed to retinyl esters,
  incorporated into chylomicrons, and transported to the liver. In hepatocytes, retinyl
  esters are hydrolyzed to retinol which forms a complex with CRBP-I. Retinol can
  then be transferred to stellate cells for storage as retinyl esters. Alternatively,
  retinol may bind to RBP, and the retinol:RBP complex is bound to TTR and transferred
  to circulation for transport to target tissues. Binding to TTR reduces renal clearance.

  of CRBP-I, LRAT, REH, and oxidoreductases (ADH, SDR, AKR, and RALDH) influence the
