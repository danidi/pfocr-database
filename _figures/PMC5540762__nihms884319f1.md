caption: Proposed model for the role of Aβ in thrombosis, fibrinolysis, and inflammation
  via its interaction with fibrinogen and FXII. FXII activation by Aβ may induce inflammation
  through bradykinin activation and increase fibrin generation through the intrinsic
  coagulation pathway. Furthermore, the interaction of Aβ with fibrin(ogen) can decrease
  fibrinolysis via abnormal fibrin clot formation as well as by inhibiting the plasmin(ogen)-fibrin
  interaction. Together, these processes may increase the level of fibrin and inflammation
  in the cerebral blood vessels, which could induce or enhance the cerebrovascular
  dysfunction observed in AD patients.
