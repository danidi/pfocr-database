caption: Schematic of the two pathways that make precursors for ester biosynthesis.
  The fatty acid pathway contributes to the straight chain esters while the Ile biosynthesis
  pathway contributes to the branched chain pathway. Colored sections show the relative
  expression patterns of genes that were differentially expressed in skin in response
  to ethylene treatment, as detected by microarray and confirmed by qPCR. Red depicts
  the level of highest expression and white the lowest. Sections from left to right
  are 0, 4, 18, 96, and 192 h after ethylene addition and 192 h no-ethylene control.
  Genes that showed changes in expression in skin on the microarray but were not confirmed
  by qPCR are indicated with an asterisk.
