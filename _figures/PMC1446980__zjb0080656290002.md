caption: A diagram showing σL-dependent transcriptional enhancers BkdR and YplP, which
  are associated with cold shock adaptation and the downstream-regulated genes. The
  σL/BkdR regulation pathway is responsible for the cold shock adaptation of the membrane
  by the degradation of isoleucine to α-keto acids for branched-chain fatty acid synthesis.
  σL/YplP downstream-regulated cold-relevant genes are still unknown.
