caption: Model showing that MDM2 is a central hub in estrogen signaling and works
  through an Rb-E2F1 pathway to promote proliferation. Breast cancer cells harboring
  SNP309 have increased binding of the transcription factor Sp1, which causes elevated
  MDM2 protein levels. Fulvestrant blocks the MDM2 pathway and the Rb-E2F1 pathway.
