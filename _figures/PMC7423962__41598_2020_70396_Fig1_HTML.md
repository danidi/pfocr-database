caption: Layout of the model of acidity control in tumor cells. A cell takes up from
  the environment nutrients and oxygen which are then converted by cell metabolism
  to lactic acid,  and ATP. Lactic acid dissociates to lactate and  ions, whereas  reversibly
  hydrates to  and . These chemical species diffuse through cell membranes () or are
  actively transported outside and eventually inside the cell by means of specific
  protein transporters. We consider monocarboxylate (MCT), sodium-hydrogen exchanger
  (NHE) and generic bicarbonate () transporters. We also model the activity of the
  membrane-bound enzyme Carbonic Anhydrase 9 (CA9). Chemical reactions are indicated
  by solid lines and the regulatory pathways by dashed lines. Proton concentrations
  inside and outside the cell are used to compute the intracellular () and the extracellular
  () pH. Detailed information on each pathway is given in the main text.
