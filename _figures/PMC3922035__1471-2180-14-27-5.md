caption: Protein interaction network analysis of the up-regulated proteins in M. pneumoniae-treated
  A549 cells. Using protein interaction network analysis tool (STRING database), three
  networks of the associated proteins were found among the up-regulated proteins.
  These included the network for stress response proteins (red circle), signaling
  pathway associated proteins (blue circle), and cellular metabolic proteins (green
  circle). Different line colors represent the types of evidence for the association.
