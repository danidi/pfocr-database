caption: Schematic description of genetic abnormalities (mutations or upregulation)
  associated with secondary off-target resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. Mutations involved
  in the RAS/MAPK pathway were reported. NRAS mutation is the most common among them.
  Axl-1, coded by the AXL gene, is a receptor tyrosine kinase that leads to the activation
  of RAS/MARK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. The upregulation of the AXL gene was observed
  in midostaurin-resistant AML cell lines. Pim-1 is part of the downstream signaling
  of STAT5, contributing cell survival and proliferation as well as cell migration.
  A lestaurtinib-resistant AML cell line showed the overexpression of Pim-1. Other
  gene mutations commonly seen in AML regardless of FLT3 status were also detected.
  Although a direct relationship with FLT3 signaling was not suggested, these mutations
  have an essential role in maintaining leukemic clones by modulating epigenetic/transcriptional
  regulations (e.g., ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A and STAG2), altering the metabolism of the
  citrate acid cycle (e.g., IDH1 and IDH2) and preventing apoptosis (e.g., TP53).
