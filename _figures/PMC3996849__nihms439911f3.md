caption: 'Intestinal cholesterol absorption is a multistep process regulated by multiple
  genes. These intracellular events could also exert major influences on the regulation
  of cholesterol absorption. This provides multiple therapeutic targets for inhibiting
  cholesterol absorption by drugs: (1) the bile acid sequestrants; (2) specific lipase
  inhibitors; (3) intestinal NPC1L1 inhibitors; (4) intestinal ABCG5/G8 inhibitors;
  and (5) intestinal ACAT inhibitors. Ezetimibe is a highly selective intestinal cholesterol
  absorption inhibitor. It can effectively and potently prevent the absorption of
  cholesterol by inhibiting the uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol across the
  brush border membrane of the enterocyte through the NPC1L1 pathway. Ezetimibe provides
  a novel strategy for the prevention of not only hypercholesterolemia, but also cholesterol
  gallstones. Abbreviations: ABC, ATP-binding cassette (transporter); ACAT2, acyl-CoA:cholesterol
