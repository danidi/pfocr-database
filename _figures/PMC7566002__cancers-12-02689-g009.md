caption: 'Schematic model of a possible molecular network between RASSF1A, the Hippo
  pathway effector YAP1, AKT, FOXO3A, FOXM1, and ERα based on the findings in this
  paper and on the published literature. (A) In the absence of RASSF1A, the Hippo
  pathway effector YAP1 is active and affects the expression and activity of ERα and
  FOXM1, directly and indirectly. First, YAP1 causes expression of FOXM1 and the ERα
  leading to increased levels of both proteins. Second, YAP1 also causes increased
  activity of AKT1 []. AKT1 phosphorylates FOXO3A and subsequently curtail its activity.
  FOXO3A can counteract ERα activity []. Under the influence of E2, ERα binds to the
  FOXM1 promoter and induces FOXM1 expression. Vice versa, FOXM1 can bind to the ERα
  promoter, maintaining, or increasing ERα expression in a positive feedback loop
  between both proteins. This feedback loop is sustained in the presence of E2. As
  FOXM1 is a key regulator of cell cycle progression, deregulated FOXM1 expression
  leads to uncontrolled proliferation and resistance against senescence. (B) RASSF1A
  interferes with the network outlined in (A) by inhibiting YAP1 and AKT1 signaling,
  thereby increasing the activity of FOXO3A. FOXO3A can inhibit ERα and FOXM1 by two
  different mechanisms: (i) FOXO3A can directly bind to the ERα and thereby inhibit
  its activity. This causes the suppression of ERα target gene expression []. In the
  presence of E2, ERα binds to the FOXM1 promoter and induces FOXM1 expression [].
  Thus, the RASSF1A-mediated increase in FOXO3A activity can suppress FOXM1 expression
  through inhibition of ERα activity. (ii) FOXO3A and FOXM1 negatively regulate each
  other, as FOXO3A is a functional antagonist of FOXM1 [] and FOXM1 negatively regulates
  FOXO3A [,]. Increased levels and activity of FOXO3A in the presence of RASSF1A,
  therefore, lead to the replacement of FOXM1 on the FHRE of the FOXM1 promoter with
  activated FOXO3A, which results in sustained inhibition of FOXM1 expression [].
  In addition to these FOXO3A-dependent mechanisms, RASSF1A suppresses expression
  of Cdk1, 2, and Plk1 and increases expression of the Cdk4 and 6 inhibitor p21Cip1/Waf1.
  As Plk1 and Cdk1, 2, 4, and 6 phosphorylate and thereby activate FOXM1 [,,,,]. RASSF1A
  might also inhibit FOXM1 activity by suppressing the expression of these kinases.
  Taken together, these mechanisms determine that in the context of events that transform
  mammary epithelial cells, RASSF1A acts as an inhibitor of ERα driven breast cancer
  cell growth through a complex, hierarchical organized network that involves first
  suppression of the Hippo effector YAP1 and subsequent inhibition of AKT1, increased
  FOXO3A activity as well as the blockade of FOXM1 and ERα expression, thereby inducing
  growth arrest and senescence. Based on these findings, we conclude that loss of
  RASSF1A is an important initial step towards ERα+ breast cancer initiation and progression.'
