caption: Proposed regulation of cardiac Per2. (1,2) Adenosine A2b receptor (Adora2b)
  signaling is able to induce cardiac Period 2 (Per2) transcript via the cAMP/CREB
  (cyclic AMP responsive element-binding protein) pathway (1) or Per2 protein via
  the inhibition of the SKP1–Cullin1–F-box (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase (2a). The SCF
  complex consists of the Skp1 bridging protein, Cullin 1 (Cul1, which forms the major
  structural scaffold), the F-box protein (contributes to the specificity of SCF by
  aggregating to target proteins) and Rbx1 (contains a small zinc-binding domain called
  the RING Finger, to which the E2-ubiquitin conjugate binds, allowing the transferral
  of the ubiquitin to a lysine residue on the target protein). As Per2 is phosphorylated
  during the day, it becomes a target for the SCF ubiquitin ligase with subsequent
  degradation via the proteasome (2b). Adora2b signaling deneddylates Cullin1 (Cul1)
  which inhibits the ubiquitin ligase activity, thereby increasing Per2 protein levels
  (2a). (3) Adora2b and Per2 levels are increased in patients with ischemic heart
  failure. As such, Adora2b signaling could also lead to the induction of Per2 transcript
  and protein via the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Acetylation of histone
  H3 increases the binding of polymerase polII to the Per2 promotor, increasing its
  transcription (3). (4) Besides Adora2b signaling other humoral pathways could be
  involved in the regulation of cardiac Per2, e.g. TGFα via Il-6 receptors, cardiotrophin-like
  cytokine (CLC) viaEGFR receptors or prokineticin via its respective receptors.
