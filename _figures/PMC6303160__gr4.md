caption: 'Pathway for conversion of glycolytic product, pyruvic acid, into acetyl-S-CoA
  and lactic acid involving different enzymes and their respective coenzymes. The
  conversion of pyruvic acid into acetyl-S-CoA catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase
  complex (PDH: E1 + E2 + E3) and its reduction into lactic acid catalyzed by lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH) are indicated on the left side of scheme. The entry of acetyl-S-CoA
  into Kreb’s cycle is shown by an arrow. The utilization of coenzymes such as thiaminepyrophosphate
  (TPP), acetyl-S-CoA and acyllipoyllysine as well as flavin adenine dinucleotide
  (FAD) by pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1), dihydroliyltransacetylase (E2) and dihydrolipoyl
  dehydrogenase (E3), respectively are also displayed. The inhibitions of Kreb’s cycle
  as well as the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) by pesticides are demonstrated
  on the top of the scheme.'
