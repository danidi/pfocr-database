caption: 'Crosstalk between Connexin 32 and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway
  in renal IR-induced AKI. In renal IR-induced AKI, Cx32 gap junction participated
  in cellular and renal damage by delivering ROS and activating NF-κB/p53/PUMA-mediated
  mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. In the absence of Cx32, ROS production
  and accumulation are alleviated, which ameliorate p65 phosphorylation and p53/PUMA-induced
  cellular apoptosis and renal damage. Note: ①Step 1: renal IR causes the generation
  of ROS. ②Step 2: ROS is transmitted through GJ composed of Cx32. ③Step 3: ROS activates
  the NF-κB and causes p65 nuclear translocation. ④Step 4: p65 regulates the activation
  of p53 and its downstream targets, including PUMA. ⑤Step 5: activation of p53/PUMA
  induces mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. ⑥Step 6: mitochondrial apoptosis
  occurs and gives rise to more ROS. ⑦Step 7: ROS is transmitted through GJ composed
  of Cx32 to another neighboring cell. Color images are available online.'
