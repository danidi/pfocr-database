caption: Menaquinone biosynthetic pathway. Each compound in the pathway is identified
  by its abbreviation and a Roman numeral. CHA, chorismate; ICHA, isochorismate; SS-TPP,
  succinic semialdehyde-TPP, R1 = pyrimidine component of TPP, R2 = CH3, R3 = CH2CH2
  OP2O63−; SEPHCHC, 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate;
  SHCHC, 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate; OSB, o-succinylbenzoate;
  OSB-CoA; o-succinylbenzoyl-CoA; DHNA-CoA, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-napththoyl-CoA; DHNA,
  1,4-dihydroxy-2-napththoate; DMK-8, demethylmenaquinone (may be initially formed
  as a quinol). MK-8, menaquinone; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine.
  The genes encoding the enzymes are shown for each reaction followed by their location
  on the chromosome in min. The gene encoding the thioesterase for the conversion
  of DHNA-CoA (compound XI) to DHNA (compound XII) remains to be identified and is
  shown as men? ?.
