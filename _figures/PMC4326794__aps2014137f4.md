caption: Modulation of drug metabolic activity by PPP and p53 regulators. Activation
  of p53 by NSC 66811 and inhibition of G6PD by 6-AN decreased both the PPP flux and
  drug metabolic rates, whereas inhibition of p53 by cyclic PFT-α and stimulation
  of the PPP by menadione have the opposite effect. Furthermore, TAp73 increased the
  PPP flux and directed glucose to the production of NADPH by stimulating G6PD. HK,
  hexokinase; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  TAp73, a structural homologue of the pre-eminent p53; Mena, menadione; 6-AN, 6-aminonicotinamide;
  cyclic PFT-α, cyclic pifithrin-α hydrobromide; DME, drug metabolizing enzyme; Ru5P,
  ribulose-5-phosphate.
