caption: See text for details. Our data indicate that mir-48, mir-84, and mir-241
  act in parallel with lin-28 and lin-46 and upstream of hbl-1 to control specification
  of L3-stage events. Both the lin-28 and lin-46 pathway and the mir-48, mir-84, mir-241
  pathway converge on hbl-1 to specify the L2-to-L3 transition. let-7 functions later
  to control specification of adult-stage events through its downstream effectors,
  hbl-1 and lin-41. mir-48, mir-84, and mir-241 control the exit from the molting
  cycle and may contribute to the repression of hbl-1 and lin-41 at the L4-to-adult
  transition.
