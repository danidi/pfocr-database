caption: Inflammatory regulation in depression. Inflammatory pathways use the pro-inflammatory
  NF-κB signaling pathway to drive the neurohormonal changes seen in depression. Reduced
  glucocorticoid receptor expression and parasympathetic activity leaves immune cells
  in a primed pro-inflammatory state due to sympathetic nervous system dominance.
  NF-κB, nuclear-factor kappa-B; CRH, corticoptropin-releasing hormone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropin
  hormone; a7-nAChR, alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; GCR, glucocorticoid
  receptor; AR, adrenergic receptor. This figure is an modified/updated version of
  a previously published figure by Bennett and Sturmberg ().
