caption: Gut immunity coordinates diet-induced changes in the microbiota for host
  growth. (A) Host growth relies on the sum of interactions between diet, immunity
  and commensal composition. HFD is able to alter microbial community composition
  independently of the lymphotoxin pathway to some effect (i.e. expansion of Firmicute
  phyla). This may occur through different bacteria’s individual capacity to utilize
  the new nutrient source. However, lymphotoxin-dependent regulation of the IL-23
  and IL-22 axis appears to facilitate species reduction (i.e. SFB) through the expression
  of anti-microbial peptides, for example RegIIIγ. Both HFD and immunity are therefore
  able to change to the commensal microbiota and thus influence weight gain. The lymphotoxin-signaling
  pathway may be agonized by dietary components, microbial products or even changes
  in epithelial cells that can agonize the IL-23/IL-22 axis. Cells that produce IL-22
  (i.e. type 3 ILCs, Th22 cells) do not express LTβR but can express membrane-bound
  lymphotoxin that agonizes IL-23 from local myeloid or stromal populations that may
  initiate their own IL-22 production. (B) Gaps in the current model for how immunity
  can coordinate changes to the microbiota and influence host health. Although LTβR
  is emerging as a paradigm for these interactions, more knowledge is needed about
  how a range of human diets directly affects both the microbiome and mucosal immunity;
  how immunity directly affects the microbiome and vice versa; and how interactions
  between the diet and immunity combine to affect the microbiome and thus affect host
  health. It is not clear whether LTβR signaling directly influences composition of
  the microbiome or if instead the lymphotoxin pathway is required to maintain an
  appropriate immune microenvironment for the effector function of innate lymphoid
  cells, epithelial cells or even Th17 cells. Additionally, many factors will influence
  the outcome of any given model system including composition of diet and starting
  microbial community composition.
