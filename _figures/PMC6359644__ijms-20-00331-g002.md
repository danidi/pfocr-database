caption: Current model of the signaling pathway in the presence or absence of brassinosteroids
  (BRs) in Arabidopsis. In the absence of BR, the receptor kinase BRI1 (BRASSINOSTEROID
  INSENSITIVE 1) does not heterodimerize with its coreceptor BAK1 (BRI1-ASSOCIATED
  RECEPTOR KINASE 1), maintaining their inactive forms. Consequently, BIN2 (BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE
  2), a negative regulator of BR signaling pathway, is free to constitutively phosphorylate
  BZR1 (BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT 1) and BES1 (BRI1-EMS SUPPRESSOR 1), the two master
  transcription factors of BR-induced responses, inducing their interactions with
  14-3-3 proteins that, in turn, promotes the cytoplasmic retention of BZR1/BES1,
  suppressing their DNA-binding activity. On the other hand, in the presence of BR,
  the activation of BRI1 triggers its autophosphorylation and partial kinase activity
  and dissociation from its inhibitor BKI1, which is attached at the BRI1 kinase domain.
  This leads to its heterodimerization with BAK1, and transphosphorylation to complete
  BRI1 kinase activity. Activated BRI1 then phosphorylates BSKs (BR-SIGNALING KINASES)
  and CDG1 (CONSTITUTIVE DIFFERENTIAL GROWTH 1) which both phosphorylate BSU1 (BRI1
  SUPPRESSOR 1), leading to BIN2 dephosphorylation. BIN2 is subsequently restrained
  by KIB1 (KINK SUPPRESSED IN BZR1-1D), which prevents the association of BIN2 with
  BZR1/BES1 and facilitates its ubiquitination and degradation. The inactivated form
  of BIN2 allows BZR1 and BES1 to enter into the nucleus and regulate the expression
  of BR target genes. Additionally, PP2A (PHOSPHATASE 2A) also positive regulates
  BR signaling by dephosphorylating BZR1 and BES1, whereas SBI1 (SUPPRESSOR OF BRI1)
  deactivates BRI1 through the methylation of PP2A.
