caption: Proposed mechanism of interaction between human γδ T cell and tumor cell.
  γδ T cells activated through interaction of γδ T cell receptor with IPP produced
  via mevalonate pathway at higher concentration in tumor cell. Besides that NKG2D
  provides activation signals upon binding to MICA/B and ULBP of tumor antigens results
  in the release of cytokines and chemokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-17, perforin,
  grazymes, CXCL-10, and CXCL-13, which can directly lyse the tumor cell and can recruit
  other immune cells like T cells (TH cells and TC cells), B cells, and dendritic
  cells (DC) to aid killing of tumors. γδ T cells expressing CD16 receptor (FCγRIII)
  interacts with TAA mediate ADCC through activation of B cell.
