caption: '(A) In normal cells, Top1-DNA covalent complexes can be repaired by redundant
  mechanisms, which can be divided in two main pathways: i/the Tdp1 hydrolysis pathway
  (see ), and ii/the 3′-endonuclease pathway (see ). (B) Cancer cells might be more
  dependent on the Tdp1 pathway as a result of mutations and inactivation of DNA checkpoints
  (BRCA1, Chk2…). The expected effect of combining a Tdp1 inhibitor with a Top1 inhibitor
  would be an increase in the therapeutic index of the Top1 inhibitor as the Tdp1
  inhibitor would sensitize preferentially the cancer cells.'
