caption: Cilia-dependent PDGFR signaling. The G-protein coupled receptors such as
  platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRα) are located at the cilia membrane.
  The PDGFR pathway is initiated with PDGF ligand binding to their receptors and inducing
  cellular responses through downstream signaling pathways such as the MEK/ERK cascade.
