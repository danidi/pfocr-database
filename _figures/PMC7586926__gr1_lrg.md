caption: 'SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on ACE2, TMPRSS2,
  and CTSL (A) The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses two ways to enter the host cells: (1.1) Via
  host membrane fusion through the binding of the viral spike proteins (S) to the
  ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor, which is co-expressed with the
  serine protease TMPRSS2 (type II transmembrane serine protease), that allows the
  priming of the viral protein S, initiating the fusion of the viral membrane with
  the host membrane. (1.2) Via endosomes. In this pathway the endosomal protease CTSL
  (cathepsin L) primes the viral protein S. Then, (2) viral RNA is released into the
  host cell. Once (3) viral RNA transcription and replication occurred, (4) the virion
  assembly takes place, small vesicles are released from the Golgi apparatus containing
  (5) virions that are released from the infected cell through exocytosis. (B) The
  receptors and proteases essential for SARS-CoV-2 infective cycle are present in
  a wide variety of tissues and cell types: brain (glial cells and neurons), eye (corneal
  epithelium), nasal (globet, basal and ciliated cells), heart (myocyte, pericyte),
  lungs (secretory, basal and multiciliated cells), liver (cholangiocytes), pancreas
  (ductal epithelium), kidney (proximal tubule cells), ileum (fibroblast, endothelial,
  and epithelial enterocytes), bladder (fibroblast, and epithelial cells), among others.
  (C) SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce a host immune response that leads to exacerbated
  inflammation not only in the respiratory system but at the systemic level and in
  the central nervous system. The common mechanisms supporting such inflammatory state
  include enhanced cellular influx with the subsequent cytokine and chemokine secretion,
  which are in part due to pyroptosis induced by the pathogen. An effective anti-inflammatory
  treatment might comprise the administration of corticosteroids at stage 2 just before
  the appearance of cytokine storm. Pulmonary insufficiency is likely associated to
  impairment of the central respiratory system provoked by the viral-induced neuroinflammatory
  response. Therefore, IN administration of low GC doses may provide better therapeutic
  effects avoiding the undesired effects of the high GC doses typically administered
  parenterally, such as the increase of viral load. A clinical trial to assess this
  proposed therapeutic scheme is under planning.'
