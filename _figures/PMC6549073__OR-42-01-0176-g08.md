caption: Cisplatin-induced apoptosis in p53-intact and p53-disrupted signaling pathway
  conditions. (A) In the cell lines with an intact p53 pathway, cisplatin-induced
  DNA damage activated ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR). ATR induced
  phosphorylation (P) of p53, which activated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor
  p21, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Cell cycle checkpoint protein, Chk1 and Wee1
  were sequentially activated to inactivate CDK1, resulting in G2/M arrest. (B) In
  the condition of a disrupted p53 pathway, since G1/S arrest was not induced, G2/M
  arrest was the main mechanism for cell growth arrest and apoptosis.
