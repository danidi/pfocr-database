caption: Mechanism of Calcineurin B-like protein 4 (CBL4)-CBL-interacting protein
  kinase (CIPK24) signaling pathway. (a) The Ca2+-binding CBL4 interacts with the
  NAF motif of CIPK24 and changes the conformation of CIPK24. CIPK24 exposes its activation
  loop and then is phosphorylated by an unknown upstream protein kinase. Activated
  CIPK24 phosphorylates and stimulates salt overly sensitive 1 (SOS1), subsequently;
  (b) Abscisic acid-insensitive 2 (ABI2) binds to the phosphatase interaction (PPI)
  domain of CIPK24 and dephosphorylates SOS1 which was phosphorylated by CIPK24; (c)
  Activated CIPK24 is dephosphorylated by ABI2 and its activity is inhibited.
