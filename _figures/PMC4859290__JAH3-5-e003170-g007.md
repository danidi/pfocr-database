caption: 'Analysis of signaling pathways specific to base:apex comparison. A, Venn
  diagram comparing overlap of genes identified in the top 3 canonical pathways: eIF2
  signaling, mTOR signaling, and regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling. In total,
  18 genes were identified in common. B, Schematic of translation initiation with
  genes/complexes associated with the DEG list identified. Shaded in green are genes
  that are upregulated in the apex. C, Venn diagram of genes of mitochondrial dysfunction
  and oxidative phosphorylation. No genes were unique to oxidative phosphorylation.
  D, Schematic of oxidative phosphorylation. Genes identified in each complex are
  listed. For (B and D), red indicates genes/complexes that are downregulated, green
  indicates genes/complexes that are upregulated in the LV apex, and white indicates
  genes/complexes that are not represented on the DEG list but are important to pathway.
  DEG indicates differentially expressed gene; EEC, endocardial endothelial cell;
  eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; LV, left ventricle; mTOR, mammalian target of
  rapamycin.'
