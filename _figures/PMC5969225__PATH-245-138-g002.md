caption: Hh–Gli signalling in myofibroblasts. The canonical Hh pathway is characterized
  by binding of one of the three ligands desert hedgehog (Dhh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh)
  or sonic hedgehog (Shh) to the receptor Ptch1, which discontinues its tonic inhibition
  on the transmembrane protein smoothened (Smo) upon ligand binding. Smo then activates
  the transcriptional activators of Hh signalling, the so‐called Gli proteins, which
  will transfer to the nucleus and activate expression of Hh target genes, promoting
  expansion of myofibroblasts and fibrosis. Non‐canonical Hh signalling can activate
  Gli proteins directly and independently of the Hh ligands Ptch1 and Smo.
