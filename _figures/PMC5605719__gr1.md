caption: Stimulus-secretion coupling in the pancreatic β-cell. Glucose is transported
  into the β-cell via facilitated diffusion in proportion to its extracellular concentration.
  Metabolism in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle ensues. This leads
  to a rise in the ATP/ADP ratio and closing of an ATP-dependent K+-channel (KATP)
  in the plasma membrane. A voltage-dependent Ca2+-channel opens and triggers exocytosis
  of insulin. In addition, metabolic coupling factors (MCF) amplify insulin secretion.
  These are thought to be generated by metabolite cycles associated with the TCA cycle
  and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). MCFs may be NADPH, perhaps mediating its
  effect via cellular redox, glutamate or lipid moieties. AcCoa – acetyl-CoA; CA –
  citrate; ETC – electron transport chain; GLUT – glucose transporters; OAA – oxaloacetate;
  Ω – membrane polarization.
