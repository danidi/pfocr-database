caption: Transfer of parasitic extracellular vesicle cargo to host cells. In this
  figure, we used a generic host cell to exemplify three different molecules delivered
  by parasitic extracellular vesicles. In the upper left part of the diagram, Trypanosoma
  cruzi releases EVs containing TS (trans-sialidase, blue circles) that can trigger
  gene modulation through the MAPK signaling pathway, which may be regulated by microRNAs.
  In the upper right part of the diagram, Leishmania donovani releases GP63 vesicles
  (orange circles) that cleave DICER (red), impairing microRNA maturation. Finally,
  in the bottom part of the diagram, EVs containing tsRNA (tRNA-derived small RNAs,
  in green) from Leishmania and from stressed Trypanosoma cruzi parasites modulate
  gene expression and might form RNP complexes (green).
