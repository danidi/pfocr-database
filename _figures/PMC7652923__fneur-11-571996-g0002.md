caption: SARS-CoV-2 attacking the vascular system. When the SARS-CoV-2 virus invades
  the human body, activated monocyte-derived macrophages can release massive amounts
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL and TNF to combat the infection. Moreover,
  when ACE2 receptors on the cell surface are occupied by SARS-CoV-2, the expression
  and function of ACE2 are reduced, Ang2 in the serum then increases, which also has
  a pro-inflammatory effect. These pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce the expression
  of TF. TF expressed by activated monocyte-derived macrophages and endothelial cells
  can activate the extrinsic coagulation pathway, leading to fibrin deposition and
  blood clotting. All these factors may increase the risk of acute ischemic stroke.
  On the other hand, the intracranial cytokine storms induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection
  may result in the breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier, thus causing hemorrhagic
  stroke. In addition, the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 receptors may increase the
  synthesis of Ang2, and may thus elevate blood pressure and increase the risk of
  hemorrhagic stroke. ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme II; Ang2, angiotensin II;
  BP, blood pressure; IL, interleukin; TF, tissue factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
