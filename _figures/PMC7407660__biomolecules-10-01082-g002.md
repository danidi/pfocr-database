caption: The COP9 signalosome (CSN) partners with ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15)
  and 48 (USP48) in the NF-κB signaling pathway. (1) Upon stimulation, the activated
  IκB kinase (IKK) complex phosphorylates IκBα, which is subsequently recognized by
  β-TrCP, the substrate receptor of the CRL1. (2) The CRL1β-TrCP ubiquitylates (K48)
  IκBα, which becomes consequently degraded by the 26S proteasome. (3) Due to the
  degradation of IκBα, NF-κB is released and translocated to the nucleus to activate
  NF-κB target genes including IκBα. (4) De novo synthesized IκBα can be phosphorylated
  again, (5) but the CSN regulates the activity of CRL1β-TrCP by deneddylation and
  (6) CSN-associated USP15, which promotes stabilization and re-accumulation of IκBα,
  thereby (7) terminating NF-κB activation. In a late response at the chromatin, (8)
  the CRL2SOCS1/ECSSOCS1 targets the nuclear RelA for degradation. However, NF-κB-dependent
  transcription activity could be sustained by the CSN-associated USP48 activity.
  (9) Herein, USP48 deubiquitylates RelA, which stabilizes RelA at the chromatin.
