caption: AhR in breast cancer and the role of dietary compounds. High levels of AhR
  induce malignant transformation in HMEC cells characterized by EMT, increased growth
  rates, abrogated cell cycle control, and increased migration and invasive potential.
  Exposure to exogenous AhR agonists such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAH),
  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and other dioxin-like compounds (DLC) leads
  to activation of AhR in the mammary gland. The endogenous AhR agonist kynurenine
  is produced through metabolism of tryptophan by tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO)2,
  which can be upregulated in the tumor stroma and intratumorally in TNBC; or Indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which is induced in stromal cells by cancer cell upregulation
  of COX-II. Activated AhR induces expression of many key genes in BC including 1)
  COX-2, which enhances invasive capacity and metastatic potential of mammary tumors
  and may cause sustained hyperactivation of AhR through positive feedback by upregulating
  IDO in stromal cells leading to kynurenine accumulation; 2) CYP1B1, which metabolizes
  estradiol (E2) to the mutagenic 4OH-Estradiol metabolite; and 3) SLUG, a transcription
  factor largely involved in EMT. The activated AhR also mediates epigenetic silencing
  of BRCA1, which would otherwise function to maintain genomic stability through the
  stable homologous recombination pathway. Closed arrowheads represent stimulus. Blunted
  lines represent inhibition.
