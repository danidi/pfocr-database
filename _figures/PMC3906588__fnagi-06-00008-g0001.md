caption: UPR response underling memory consolidation in Alzheimer's disease. Activation
  of ER stress signaling by abnormal protein misfolding activates several stress kinases
  leading to phosphorylation of eIF2α, inhibiting protein synthesis. Phosphorylation
  of eIF2α impairs synaptic function and cognitive processes. The IRE1α/JKN pathway
  may feed forward to enhance amyloid deposition and AD process, whereas XBP1 has
  neuroprotective effects against Aβ toxicity, and controls the expression of a cluster
  of AD-related genes.
