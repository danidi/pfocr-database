caption: A schematic model illustrating that CNP regulates BTB dynamics by promoting
  endocytosis of integral membrane proteins. This effect, coupled with degradation
  of proteins at the BTB possibly via the ubiquitination/lysosomal pathway under the
  influence of other molecules, in turn reduces the steady-state levels of integral
  membrane proteins at the BTB. The net result opens the BTB to facilitate preleptotene
  spermatocyte migration that occurs at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle. It is
  likely that CNP is working in concert with other molecules in the microenvironment
  of the seminiferous epithelium, such as TGF-β3 and TNFα, to regulate BTB dynamics.
