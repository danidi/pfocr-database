caption: Additional analysis of the PPI network. (A) Nodes in the PPI network that
  were also regulated by pathway output, as mined from in vivo transcriptome analyses.
  Blue nodes were encoded by genes that were down-regulated by pathway output; yellow
  nodes were up-regulated. (B) Correlation between expression of the genes encoding
  the baits and preys. Orange edges denote interacting partners that exhibited an
  inverse correlation in expression; blue edges denote interacting partners that exhibited
  positive correlation in expression.
