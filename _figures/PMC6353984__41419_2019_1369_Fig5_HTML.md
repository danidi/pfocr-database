caption: Silencing of cyclinB1 elevated the reactive oxygen species levels. This in
  turn directly activated AMPKα by phosphorylating at Thr172 and then activated ULK1
  by phosphorylating at Ser555 leading to autophagy. Activated AMPKα also phosphorylated
  beclin-1 at Ser93 site, which further enhanced the activity of PI3K compound. Moreover,
  elevated ATG4a cleaved the C-terminal part of MAP1LC3 allowing the release of (LC3-I).
  Then a subpopulation of LC3-I was subsequently converted into a LC3-II. Additionally,
  p62 bound autophagosomal membrane protein LC3/Atg8, delivering p62-containing protein
  aggregated to the autophagosome, which led to a decline in p62 level. Arrows represented
  promotion events, blunt arrows indicated suppression events
