caption: Axonal transport is disrupted by the presence of pathogenic forms of normal
  neuronal proteins, which lead to activation of specific kinase signaling pathways.
  For example, tau filaments activate a phosphatase PP1/GSK3P pathway (), which preferentially
  phosphorylates conventional kinesin motors containing KLC2 (). This phosphorylation
  in turn leads to release of kinesin from the associated cargo vesicle. Similarly,
  pathogenic forms of huntingtin activate a MAP kinase pathway leading to JNK3, which
  preferentially phosphorylates motors containing kinesin-1B and -1C subunits and
  inhibits their interaction with microtubules (). JNK3 also inhibits retrograde AT,
  but the specific cytoplasmic dynein subunit that is modified has not been identified.
