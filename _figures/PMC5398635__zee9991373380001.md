caption: Proposed mechanism for the action of A-II and Kir3.4 mutations affecting
  the selectivity filter function on aldosterone secretion. A, Baseline. Adrenal ZG
  cells are hyperpolarized primarily through the activity of the TASK-1 and/or TASK-3
  potassium channel and Kir3.4 channels. B, A-II stimulation. A-II depolarizes the
  ZG cell by blocking the activity of the TASK-1 and/or TASK-3 and Kir3.4 channels.
  This results in opening of calcium channels, stimulating the calcium calmodulin
  pathway, resulting in increased expression of the CYP11B2 and decreased expression
  of the Kir3.4 channel at the mRNA and protein level. C, Kir3.4 mutation. Presence
  of a copy of a mutated Kir3.4 potassium channel at the selectivity filter results
  in an increase in intracellular sodium, membrane depolarization, and mobilization
  of calcium, resulting an increase in the expression of the CYP11B2 enzyme and synthesis
  of aldosterone.
