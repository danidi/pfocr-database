caption: Proposed model for DEP-induced expression of IL-8, COX-2 and CYP1A1, based
  on the presented findings. DEP-induced mRNA expression of CYP1A1 in BEAS-2B cells
  occurs at much lower DEP-concentrations than the concentrations necessary to induce
  mRNA expression of IL-8 and COX-2. Activation of AhR and expression of CYP1A1 mRNA
  seem essential in facilitating the DEP-induced expression of IL-8 and COX-2 mRNA
  via a permissive pathway (required, but not decisive for the strength of the response),
  not involving p38 and NF-κB/p-65. However, the p38 and p65 pathways seem crucial
  in DEP-induced expression of COX-2 and IL-8 mRNA, via a major pathway.
