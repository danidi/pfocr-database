caption: Schematic diagram of the neurotransmitter controlled behaviors and the associated
  mutant used in this study. The CAT-2 gene encodes for tyrosine hydroxylase and is
  the primary pathway for dopamine (DA) synthesis. Serotonin synthesis requires the
  TPH-1 tryptophan hydroxylase gene. Serotonin is removed from the synaptic space
  by the MOD-5 serotonin reuptake transporter. MOD-1 receptor encodes an ionotropic
  5HT receptor and SER-4 belongs to the class of metabotropic G-protein-coupled 5HT
  receptors, and is homologous to mammalian 5-HT1 receptor class. The drug aldicarb
  is a cholinesterase inhibitor that causes an accumulation of acetylcholine at the
  neuromuscular junction, which eventually leads to paralysis. Exogenous 5-HT can
  inhibit this behavior. 5-HT stimulates egg-laying in C. elegans and both dopamine
  and acetylcholine inhibit it.
