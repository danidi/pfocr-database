caption: 'Proposed signaling pathway for prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor-mediated ATP
  release from erythrocytes. Exposure to PGI2 or its analogs results in activation
  of the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs. This leads to activation of AC and an increase
  in cAMP that is regulated by PDE3 activity. Increases in cAMP activate PKA and,
  subsequently, CFTR. The final conduit for ATP release in this pathway is VDAC. Abbreviations:
  IPR = PGI2 receptor; Gs = heterotrimeric G protein, Gs; AC = adenylyl cyclase; ATP
  = adenosine triphosphate; cAMP = cyclic adenosine monophosphate; AMP = adenosine
  monophosphate; PKA = protein kinase A; CFTR = cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator; VDAC = voltage-dependent anion channel; GTP = guanosine triphosphate;
  cGMP = cyclic guanosine monophosphate; GMP = guanosine monophosphate; sGC = soluble
  guanylyl cyclase; PDE3 = phosphodiesterase 3; PDE5 = phosphodiesterase 5; (+) =
  activation and (−) = inhibition.'
