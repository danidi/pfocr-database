caption: Germline or somatic mutations involving DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1,
  BRCA2, ATM and MSH2 are present in 20% of metastatic castration-resistant prostate
  cancers (mCRPCs). Loss of homologous recombination genes (such as BRCA2) has been
  associated with response to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor (PARPi)
  treatment and platinum chemotherapy. Mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes
  (for example, MSH2) results in hypermutation and microsatellite instability. Loss
  of CDK12 or deficiency in mismatch repair genes (dMMR) has been associated with
  response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; DSB, double-strand
  breaks; RNA Pol II, RNA polymerase II.
