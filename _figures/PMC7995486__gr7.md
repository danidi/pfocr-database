caption: Systematic diagram showing how the lncRNA SNHG4/let-7e/KDM3A/p21 pathway
  is involved in the development of NSCLClncRNA SNHG4 binds with miR-let-7e and thus
  positively regulates the expression of KDM3A. KDM3A, a histone demethylase, inhibits
  the transcriptional activity of p53 by erasing p53-k372me1 and reduces the expression
  of p21. In this context, reduced p21 promotes the development of NSCLC.
