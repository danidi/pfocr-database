caption: Proposed mechanism for the effect of FPS-ZM1 in COPD. Exposure to CSE and
  release of elastase by injured cells during smoking increase ligands, such as S100
  calgranulins and HMGB1. The ligands bind to and activate response by RAGE. The engagement
  of RAGE is linked to the DAMP signaling pathway, notably NF-κB and MAPKs, which
  overlap considerably with the Nrf2 signaling pathway for RAGE-mediated emphysematous
  response to stress stimuli in the lung (airspace enlargement, sustained inflammation,
  excessive ROS/RNS, immune cell infiltration, and epithelial cell death). When mice
  exposed to PPE or epithelial cells exposed to CSE are treated with FPS-ZM1, RAGE-mediated
  emphysema and DAMP signaling pathway recover. However, FPS-ZM1 treatment of Nrf2-deficient
  mice after elastase application fails to repair airspace enlargement, excessive
  ROS/RNS, and activation of DAMP signaling, including NF-κB and MAPK signaling; FPS-ZM1
  reverses only the infiltration of inflammatory cells and cytokines. Eventually,
  boosted RAGE expression promotes COPD progression. In this respect, FPS-ZM1 may
  offer a potential therapeutic application to inhibit inflammation during the development
  of COPD, where this sustained inflammation is a big hurdle. Taken together, there
  is a need to verify the affirmative action of FPS-ZM1 against excessive infiltration
  of inflammatory cells and cytokines in COPD.
