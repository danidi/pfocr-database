caption: Genetic (a) and biochemical (b) control of AOX respiration in plants. Genetic
  control of AOX gene expression likely involves both retrograde signals from the
  mitochondrion and other cellular signals related to growth, energy metabolism and
  stress. Biochemical control of the partitioning of electrons to AOX is, at least
  in part, the result of a feed-forward activation of AOX by upstream carbon (pyruvate)
  and redox (NAD(P)H) status.
