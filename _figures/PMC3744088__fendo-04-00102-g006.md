caption: The extent to which glutamate (GLU) is oxidized in astrocytes seems to increase
  particularly during higher glutamate concentrations. A net synthesis of tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle intermediates occurs when the initial reaction is catalyzed by
  glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) which paves the way for the complete oxidation of
  the carbon skeleton of glutamate. This requires pyruvate recycling via the concerted
  action of malic enzyme (ME) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) converting malate into
  acetyl CoA producing NAD(P)H. Acetyl CoA is oxidized completely in one turn of the
  TCA cycle. A partial oxidation of glutamate is acquired when pyruvate (PYR) is reduced
  to lactate (LAC) instead of being oxidized to acetyl CoA. The redox state of the
  cell is likely important in the regulation of the destiny of the glutamate molecule.
  As an alternative to the activity of GDH, aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) facilitates
  the formation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) from glutamate at the expense of oxaloacetate
  (OAA); thus no net synthesis of TCA cycle intermediates is obtained. In contrast
  to the complete oxidation initiated by the activity of GDH, AAT enables the truncated
  TCA cycle which refers to the net synthesis of aspartate from glutamate, a pathway
  shown to accelerate during hypoglycemic conditions. All enzymes except ME and LDH
  are located in the mitochondria. PC, pyruvate carboxylase; CIT, citrate.
