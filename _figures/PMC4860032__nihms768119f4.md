caption: Shown in this figure are the pathways contributing to androgen synthesis
  that occur in the testes, adrenals, and prostate tumor itself in men with CRPC.
  Expression of CYP17A1 in all three tissues produces androgens, and further metabolism
  of these androgenic substrates results in the synthesis of the potent androgen receptor
  agonists, testosterone and DHT. Highlighted in purple is the backdoor pathway to
  DHT synthesis that bypasses testosterone as an intermediate. Independent studies
  have shown evidence to support this particular pathway being intact in CRPC.
