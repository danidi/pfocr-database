caption: CySBGN overview. CySBGN overview. Diagram (a) shows a small part of the imported
  diagram of the central plant metabolism with 1324 nodes and 1322 edges. Diagram
  (b) depicts par of the imported MAPK cascade model. Diagram (c) represents the glycolysis
  metabolic pathway. Panel (d) is the Data Panel of Cytoscape where the user can check
  the node and edge attributes loaded from the SBGN-ML file. Both diagram (a) and
  (b) are part of the core validation tests of CySBGN. All these examples are part
  of the test examples of libSBGN and the examples of SBGN. All the test files are
  available on CySBGN project web page http://sourceforge.net/projects/cysbgn/.
