caption: 'A and B: schematics of the song control system and relevant auditory structures.
  Represented are the posterior vocal-motor pathway (VMP, blue), and the anterior
  forebrain pathway (AFP, red). HVC is the origin of both pathways and the entry site
  of inputs from auditory areas (yellow) into the song system. For abbreviations,
  see . In A, brain topography is preserved, for easier comparison with experimental
  brain sections. In B, indication of broad brain subdivisions (on the right) facilitates
  comparison with mammalian brains.'
