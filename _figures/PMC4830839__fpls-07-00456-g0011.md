caption: Hypothetical model summarizing the potential signaling pathway of nitric
  oxide (NO) involved in cold-inhibited C. sinensis pollen tube growth. This simplified
  model was based on the pollen tube models proposed by Wang et al. (2009 and 2012),
  (Wudick and Feijó, ), and Domingos et al. (). Cold stress induces an increase in
  NO through the synergism of several pathways in C. sinensis pollen tubes, such as
  the accumulation of NOS-like activity and cytochrome P450 activity. Consequently,
  the cytoplasmic Ca2+ gradient was regulated largely by mediating the Ca2+ flux,
  which is dependent on various Ca2+ channels, such as CNGCs (cGMP-activated channels),
  GLRs and TPCs, and this subsequently triggered secondary and tertiary regulatory
  networks, including Ca2+ sensor and relay proteins, the MAPK cascade, ROS, actin,
  vesicles and pH signaling. In addition, Ca2+-dependent [pH]cyt acidification interacted
  with PMEs, leading to changes in the cell wall structure and component distribution.
  Furthermore, RAC signaling involved in the process of cold-induced NO inhibited
  C. sinensis pollen tube polarized growth by regulating the Ca2+ and ROS signaling
  pathways. Together, the complex signaling network dominated by NO mediates the cold-inhibited
  C. sinensis pollen tube growth. NOS, nitric oxide synthase; GC, guanylyl cyclase;
  PTPs, protein tyrosine phosphatases; cPTIO, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide;
  PTKs, protein tyrosine kinases; CNGCs, cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels; GLRs,
  glutamate receptor-like channels; CPK, calcium-dependent protein kinase; NOX, NADPH
  oxidase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ADF, actin-depolymerizing factor; PME, pectin
  methylesterase; RACs, Rac-like GTP-binding proteins.
