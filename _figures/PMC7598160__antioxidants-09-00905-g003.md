caption: Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the retina. The retina relies
  on glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (Oxphos) as sources of
  ATP. Glucose uptake into retinal cells occurs via insulin-dependent glucose transporter
  4 (GLUT4) and insulin-independent glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1). Fatty acid (FA)
  uptake is not hormonally regulated, but rather potentially driven by circulating
  availability (FAcirc) [,]. In the retina, FA uptake is regulated by a lipid sensor,
  the free fatty acid lipid receptor 1 (Ffar1), and mediated by the very low density
  lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR). In retinal cells, glucose follows multiple metabolic
  pathways, including glycolysis and the polyol pathway, the latter of which leads
  to the production of sorbitol and ultimately fructose. Pyruvate is either converted
  to lactate or transported into mitochondria where it is converted by pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH) to acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
  PDH is inhibited by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases that are activated by excessive
  acetyl-CoA and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). For simplicity, other glucose
  metabolic pathways are not shown. FAs, which are released from triglycerides and
  imported into retinal cells via the VLDLR, are converted to fatty acyl-CoA, shuttled
  into the mitochondria via carnitine palmitoyltransferases 1 and 2 (CPT1 and 2),
  and oxidized via FA β-oxidation. FA β-oxidation yields NADH, flavin adenine dinucleotide
  (FAHD2), and AcCoA, which are further oxidized by the electron transport chain (ETC)
  complexes in the process of Oxphos with ATP synthesis. FA β-oxidation is inhibited
  by malonyl-CoA (an intermediate of FA synthesis), FADH2/FAD+ ratios, and NADH/NAD+
  ratios. Malonyl-CoA is degraded by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD), thus decreasing
  its inhibitory effect on CPT1. Although described in other organs, these regulatory
  steps are yet to be identified in the retina. Mitochondrial Oxphos provides the
  bulk of retinal ATP. As electrons transfer NADH and FADH2 to molecular oxygen by
  ETC complexes, an electrochemical gradient is built across the mitochondrial inner
  membrane (IM). This gradient is used by the complex V to produce ATP. Mitochondria-generated
  ATP is transferred to the cytosol by the creatine kinase (CK) shuttle to sustain
  the normal functions of the retinal cells. The inset included here is an electron
  micrograph of a mouse rod photoreceptor and shows the inner segment mitochondria.
  For simplicity, the nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, a mitochondrial inner
  membrane enzyme that reduces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH+)
  by oxidizing NADH and using the mitochondrial proton-motive force, is not shown
  in this figure. The oxidized NAD+ and NADP+ are shown in red.
