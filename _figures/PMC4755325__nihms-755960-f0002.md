caption: A detailed overview of the cGAS-STING DNA sensing pathway is depicted. Both
  positive and negative regulators of STING are shown. Black arrows indicate pathways
  that lead to activation of STING and induction of the type I IFN response. White
  arrows indicate pathways that negatively regulate STING. Protein ubiquitination
  is depicted as K48 or K63 linkages and protein phosphorylation is depicted as P.
