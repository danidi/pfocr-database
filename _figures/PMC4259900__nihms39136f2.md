caption: Signaling pathways involving PAN-family proteins. (A) In response to certain
  PAMPs, PAN-family proteins are activated (see  below), which results in the recruitment
  of adapter proteins by PYRIN domain interaction. To date ASC is the only identified
  adapter protein that is recruited to these PAN-family protein complexes. Activated
  downstream effector pathways include NF-κB, MHC class I gene expression, and caspases
  that are either linked to apoptosis or inflammation. Some PAN-family proteins also
  recruit TUCAN (CARD8, Cardinal, NDPP1, KIAA0955), a protein implicated in the negative
  regulation of NF-κB, caspase-1, and caspase-9. However, it is feasible that in response
  to ligand-dependent PAN-family protein activation, TUCAN might be converted from
  an inhibitor to an activator of these pathways. Alternatively, TUCAN might provide
  a mechanism to fine-tune responses elicited by activated PAN-family proteins. (B)
  NAC (CARD7, DEFCAP, NALP1, CLR17.1) represents an exception, as it also contains
  a CARD, which allows direct recruitment of pro-caspase-5 by CARD-CARD interaction
  (D) or links to the apoptotic pathway via pro-caspase-2 and APAF-1. (C) Recruitment
  of ASC could also link NAC to NF-κB activation.
