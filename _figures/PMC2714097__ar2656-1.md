caption: Pathways for osteogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Osteoblasts mature from
  mesenchymal stem cells to preosteoblasts. The Wnt signaling pathway antagonists
  (DKK-1, sclerostin, and SFRP1) and serotonin all inhibit osteogenesis. A number
  of cell types can synthesize Wnt signaling antagonists. Fibroblast-like synoviocytes
  from rheumatoid arthritis patients after stimulation with TNF-α, and myeloma cells
  synthesize DKK-1 and osteocytes synthesize sclerostin. Osteoblasts also now are
  known to be the main controllers of osteoclastogenesis through the production of
  RANKL by pre-osteoblast cells. The antagonist of RANKL, OPG, is produced by mature
  osteoblasts and prevents RANKL from binding to its receptor, RANK, so that osteoclast
  maturation and activity are inhibited. DKK, dickkopf; OPG, osteoprotegerin; RANKL,
  receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand; SFRP, secreted frizzled-related
  protein; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
