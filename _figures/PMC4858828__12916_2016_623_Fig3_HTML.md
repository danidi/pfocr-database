caption: T cell activation in the lymph node. a Both immunological signal 1 (T cell
  receptor (TCR) recognition of antigens) and immunological signal 2 (stimulation
  of CD28 by B7 costimulatory molecules) are required for T cell activation in the
  lymph node. The interaction between the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein
  4 (CTLA-4) receptor and B7 expressed on T cells and antigen presenting cells, respectively,
  prevents T cells from becoming fully activated by blocking immunologic signal 2.
  b Antibodies that block the CTLA-4 pathway (e.g. ipilimumab) permit T cell activation
  by derepressing signaling by CD28. MCH, Major histocompatibility complex. (Adapted
  from [])
