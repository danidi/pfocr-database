caption: 'a WES of 157 germline samples from 80 UC patients (WCM-UC cohort) b Somatic
  variants identified through EXaCT-1 whole-exome sequencing (WES) pipeline using
  matched tumor-normal samples. c The DGVar framework for the identification of putative
  deleterious germline variants (pDGVs). d Comparison cohorts: 398 patients from the
  TCGA-BLCA cohort, and 11,035 noncancer subjects from the SPARK non-cancer cohort.
  e Functional predictions using CADD scores, three-dimensional modeling of the effects
  of pDGVs on protein data bank (PDB) structures and somatic LOH analysis f Germline-somatic
  interactions at the gene and pathway levels.'
