caption: Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy does not abolish renal protection, indicating that
  C1 neuron-mediated cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) activation does not
  occur via a parasympathetic route but via a sympathetic route. The mechanism of
  CAP activation via C1 neurons (sympathetic) might differ from that via vagus nerve
  stimulation (parasympathetic). The dotted lines are strongly suggested, though not
  conclusively proven, pathways.Ach, acetylcholine; α7nAChR, alpha 7 subunit of the
  nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; β2AR, β2 adrenergic receptor; DMV, dorsal motor
  nucleus of the vagus; NE, norepinephrine; SGN, sympathetic ganglionic neuron; SPGN,
  sympathetic preganglionic neuron; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha.
