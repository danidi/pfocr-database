caption: A, The GI-FKF1-CDF1 module during flowering in Arabidopsis. When CDF1 binds
  to the GI/FKF1 complex in the leaf, its degradation is facilitated and the floral
  pathway is enhanced. CDF1 inhibits both CO and FT transcription. In Arabidopsis,
  blue light perceived by FKF1 is required to stabilize the GI and FKF1 complex (lightening
  flash), so that longer inductive photoperiods cause enhanced accumulation of the
  GI-FKF1 complex and increased CO and FT mRNA levels. FKF1 controls the interaction
  with GI by absorbing blue light through its LOV domain. Phytochrome B signaling
  in response to  also promotes CO stability (lightening flash), whereas red light
  destabilizes CO protein. The PRR proteins repress CDF1 transcription, whereas the
  clock proteins CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY)
  activate it (revised from ; with permission of the authors). PRR, PSEUDO-RESPONSE
  REGULATOR. B, The regulatory network of BEL5, CDF1, and SP6A during the onset of
  tuberization in potato. In potato leaves, the GI/FKF1/CDF1 complex (blue dashed
  oval) functions to degrade CDF1 and delay tuber signaling. When CDF1 is available,
  it represses CO activity, leading to conditions favorable for tuberization. Low
  levels of blue and red light induce BEL5 in leaves (lightening flash). BEL5 then
  transcriptionally activates (red arrows) CDF1 and SP6A. CDF1 blocks CO, releasing
  its repressive effect on both SP6A and BEL5. Under , CONSTANS-LIKE1 (StCOL1/StCO2)
  stability is enhanced through phytochrome B activity. COL1 suppresses SP6A through
  the intermediary activity of a second FT ortholog, SP5G. CO also likely mediates
  its suppressive effect through a direct interaction with the promoter of StSP6A.
  In these models, CO represses tuberization but enhances flowering.
