caption: Upon binding activated (processed) Spätzle, Toll dimerizes. The resulting
  conformational change allows the Toll TIR domain to bind to the TIR domain of the
  adaptor protein MyD88. (For simplicity, interactions and downstream events are shown
  for only one monomer of a dimeric Toll receptor). MyD88 brings along with it the
  adaptor protein Tube, an association mediated by a death domain in each protein.
  The bivalent Tube death domain then binds the death domain of Pelle, recruiting
  the inactive protein kinase into the signaling complex. Within the complex, Pelle
  undergoes autoactivation via autophosphorylation. Pelle then interacts with Dorsal-bound
  Cactus, an interaction enhanced by the binding of Dorsal to both Tube and Pelle.
  Pelle phosphorylates Cactus, triggering recognition by the Slimb βTrCP and subsequent
  ubiquitination and proteasome mediated degradation. Pelle likely also phosphorylates
  Dorsal, enhancing its gene regulatory activity upon release from Cactus, and Tube,
  initiating negative feedback regulation on Toll signaling.
