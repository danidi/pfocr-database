caption: 'PD and PK pathways of HMGCo A reductase inhibitors (Statins). (a) Cholesterol
  and lipoprotein transport: genes involved in mediating statin effects on hepatic
  cholesterol metabolism and consequent effects on plasma lipoprotein transport. Statins
  inhibit endogenous cholesterol production by competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase
  (HMGCR), the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early
  rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. This pathway delineates genes involved
  in statin pharmacogenomics, including genes involved in mediating the PD effects
  of statins on plasma lipoprotein metabolism and those involved in the PKs effects
  of the drug transport and metabolism. Note the effects of inhibition of HMG-CoA
  reductase on major aspects of hepatic cholesterol metabolism and selected gene products
  that can modulate the effects of statins on metabolism and transport of plasma lipoproteins.
  (b) PKs of Statins: representation of the superset of all genes involved in the
  transport, metabolism, and clearance of statin class drugs. This figure depicts
  a generalized view of the PKs of statins, representing the superset of all genes
  with a reported influence on statin transport and metabolism. Statins are dosed
  orally and enter the systemic circulation through intestinal cells both passively
  and by active transport via the ABC and SLC gene family transporters. The major
  organs of metabolism and elimination include the liver and, to a lesser extent,
  the kidney. Metabolism is catalyzed by enzymes of the CYP and UGT gene family. The
  main pathway of elimination is ABC-transporter-mediated biliary excretion. The more
  hydrophilic compounds (e.g., pravastatin) require active transport into the liver,
  are less metabolized by the CYP family, and exhibit more pronounced active renal
  excretion, whereas the less hydrophilic compounds are transported by passive diffusion
  and are better substrates for both CYP enzymes and transporters involved in biliary
  excretion. These figures are available at www.pharmgkb.org.'
