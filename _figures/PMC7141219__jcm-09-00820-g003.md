caption: Upstream network analysis of the proteins from endothelial cells exposed
  to ponatinib and Notch-1 signaling inhibition. Upstream inhibited in HUVECs treated
  with ponatinib compared to those co-treated with ponatinib and anti-Notch-1 antibody.
  Panel (A,B), image shows the upstream activation of NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha (NFKBIA)
  gene resulting in a z-score of 2.546, and the upstream inhibition of Transforming
  Growth Factor-Beta1 (TGFB1) gene (A) and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
  gene (B) resulting in a z-score of −6.282 and −4.261, respectively. Blue color key
  indicates inhibited regulators, while the orange one indicates the activated regulators.
  The intensity of the color is proportional to the score prediction value. As reported
  previously, z-scores > 2.0 indicate that a molecule and/or function is activated,
  whereas z-scores < −2.0 indicate the inhibition of the target.
