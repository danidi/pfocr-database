caption: Proposed model of adiponectin-mediated inhibition of Ang II-induced VSMC
  remodeling. Treatment with Ang II induces hypertrophy in VSMC. Adiponectin suppresses
  AngII-induced VSMC hypertrophy through signaling pathways that activates NO synthesis
  in endothelial cells (ECs). The inhibitory effect of adiponectin on Ang II-induced
  VSMC hypertrophy is mediated through modulating the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway,
  F-actin to G-actin ratio, and ROS formation.
