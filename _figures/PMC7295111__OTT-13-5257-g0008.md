caption: A schematic diagram of p70S6K-induced EMT in the acquired resistance of erlotinib
  in NSCLC. p70S6K, a downstream molecule of mTORC1 signaling, facilitates global
  protein synthesis. p70S6K played a simulative role in EMT as well as the acquired
  resistance of erlotinib in NSCLCs. GSK3β promoted the degradation of mTOR, raptor
  and p70S6K. The decreased expression of GSK3β in HCC827-ER cells could lead to the
  enhancement of mTORC1-p70S6K signaling pathway, which further stimulated EMT and
  erlotinib resistance.
