caption: A model for NOS-mediated induction of βFTZ-F1 expression during Drosophila
  metamorphosis. In the PG (pink), NOS-mediated production of NO prevents E75 function
  as a suppressor of DHR3, allowing DHR3 to induce βFTZ-F1 expression. βFTZ-F1 in
  turn promotes ecdysteroidogenesis, at least in part through the induction of ecdysteroidogenic
  enzymes. In peripheral tissues (yellow), 20E induces expression of both E75 and
  DHR3. E75 prevents DHR3 function when the hemolymph 20E titer is high, and 20E-mediated
  NOS repression through a nongenomic pathway might also be at work to fully potentiate
  E75 function. Upon decline of the 20E level, E75 quickly degrades to liberate accumulated
  DHR3, allowing it to induce βFTZ-F1 expression. Restored NOS function may further
  block residual E75 to prevent DHR3 function. Transiently expressed βFTZ-F1 during
  midprepupal stage is necessary for the response of peripheral tissues to the next
  surge of 20E titer, which promotes metamorphosis throughout the animal body.
