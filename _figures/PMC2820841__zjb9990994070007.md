caption: Hypothetical pathway for LPS and EmaA biosynthesis in A. actinomycetemcomitans.
  The proposed LPS biosynthetic pathway is based on enzymatic reactions that are known
  or proposed, based on protein homology, for other Gram-negative bacteria. We propose
  that EmaA monomers are translocated across the inner membrane (IM) using the Sec
  translocon mediated by the signal sequence (data not shown). Once in the periplasmic
  space, the O-PS sugars are transferred to the individual EmaA monomers by the O-antigen
  ligase (WaaL) before translocation through the outer membrane (OM) and presentation
  on the bacterial surface.
