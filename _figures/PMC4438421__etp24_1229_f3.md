caption: 'Schematic representation of TLR-ligand-mediated NF-κB activation. TLR ligands
  (multiple, not all radioprotective) interact with TLR receptor inducing two divergent
  signaling pathways controlled by two pairs of adaptor proteins: TRAM/TRIF and TIRAP/MyD88.
  The MyD88-dependent pathway quickly upregulates inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB
  activation by its dissociation from inhibitory component (IκB). This permits NF-κB
  to enter the nucleus where it can ‘turn on’ the expression of specific genes such
  as inflammatory or immune response, a cell survival response, cellular proliferation
  and oxygen-scavenging MnSOD. The MyD88-independent pathway does this as well, in
  addition to inducing type-1 IFN expression through IRFs and triggering IFN-β, which
  results in cell maturation. MyD88-independent pathways are activated with slower
  kinetics. Radiation produces ROS, which also activate NF-γB.'
