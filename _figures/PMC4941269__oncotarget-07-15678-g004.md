caption: Knockdown of RGMs facilitates BMP signaling through the Smad1/5/8 pathway
  and partly through Smad2/3. The MAPK-JNK pathway is inhibited thereby mediating
  the expression of BMP downstream genes. FAK/paxillin is induced by BMP through Smad1/5/8
  and TGF-β through Smad2/3. It also interacts with components of the ERK1/2 pathway
  []. Expression of focal adhesion proteins is primarily stimulated by activation
  of Smad1/5/8 and partially by Smad2/3 in the absence of RGMB, which leads to increased
  cell adhesion in breast cancer. Snai1 can be induced by TGF-β through Smad2/3 [].
  Regulation of Snai1 is also associated with Smad1/5/8 activation after RGMB knockdown,
  which induces EMT. ID-1 is upregulated or downregulated by TGF-β via Smad2/3, depending
  on the phase [, ], and it can also be activated by BMPs through Smad1/5/8 and the
  PI3K/Akt pathway [–]. Knockdown of RGMs in prostate cancer cells has been shown
  to result in upregulation of ID-1 primarily through Smad2/3, which may promote cell
  proliferation [], migration [], and adhesion []. Knockdown of RGMB suppressed expression
  and activation of caspase-3 (executes the cell apoptotic program) and reduced c-Myc
  expression, which may also be involved in the regulation of cell death. Binding
  of RGMs to neogenin may trigger different pathways that mediate neuronal growth,
  differentiation, and iron metabolism [–]. RGMB binds PD-L2, which promotes respiratory
  immunity independent of another PD-L2 receptor, PD-1, which inhibits antitumor immunity
  [].
