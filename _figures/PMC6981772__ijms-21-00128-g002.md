caption: 'Plant sterol and cholesterol metabolism. Dietary lipids, biliary cholesterol,
  and bile acids are incorporated into mixed micelles in the intestinal lumen. Competition
  between plant sterols and free cholesterol during digestion causes a reduction in
  cholesterol solubilization and increases cholesterol excretion in feces. Free cholesterol
  and free plant sterols are absorbed through the NPC1L1 transporter, while other
  lipids are taken up into the enterocyte by facilitated diffusion at the brush border.
  Plant sterol absorption is controlled by ABCG5/8, which acts as an efflux pump to
  export free sterols from enterocytes back into the intestinal lumen. Alternatively,
  plant sterols may also be packed into lipoproteins in a similar way as cholesterol.
  After intestinal uptake, dietary and biliary free cholesterol (and some free plant
  sterols) are normally esterified by ACAT-2, incorporated into chylomicrons, and
  secreted into the lymph. Unesterified cholesterol is secreted back to the intestinal
  lumen by ABCG5/8. Chylomicrons reach the circulation and deliver free fatty acids
  to peripheral tissues through the activity of LPL. Chylomicron remnants undergo
  hepatic uptake, where they contribute to the formation of VLDL along with cholesterol
  esters (synthesized through the HMG CoA pathway) and TAG (synthesized through the
  malonyl-CoA pathway). Once plant sterols reach the liver, they can also be returned
  to the intestine by ABCG5/8 transporters at the hepatobiliary interface. VLDL particles
  are secreted into the bloodstream and give rise to LDL particles. LDL distributes
  cholesterol and plant sterols to tissues and undergoes hepatic uptake through LDL
  receptors (LDLr). However, LDL particles may infiltrate the endothelial intima where
  they undergo oxidative and enzymatic modification. Uptake of modified LDL by intima
  macrophages leads to the formation of foam cells and fatty streaks. The atherosclerotic
  process may be attenuated by HDL, as it promotes cholesterol efflux from other tissues
  by LCAT, and also from the macrophages. HDL is recognized by SRB1 receptors in the
  liver and deliver cholesterol (or plant sterols) for biliary excretion, keeping
  the “cholesterol reverse transport” cycle. Hepatic cholesterol homeostasis is controlled
  by several sensors. Decreased levels of cholesterol esters activate SREBP-2, which
  upregulates HMG CoA reductase, increases LDL receptor (LDLr) expression, and induces
  expression of PCSK9, that after secretion binds to LDLr on the hepatocyte surface,
  forming a complex PCSK9–LDLr, which is internalized and undergoes degradation. On
  the other hand, increased levels of cholesterol in hepatocytes leads to activation
  of LXR and FXR, which upregulate expression of enzymes and transporters involved
  with biliary excretion. Activation of LXR in enterocytes leads to luminal excretion
  of cholesterol and facilitates intestinal HDL synthesis. For details on lipid metabolism
