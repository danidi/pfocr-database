caption: Contribution of MTHFR, MTR and MTHFD1 in the folate metabolic pathway. 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-CH2-THF) is either oxidized by MTHFD1 dehydrogenase to 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate
  (5,10-CHTHF) or reduced by MTHFR to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3-THF). Methionine
  synthase (MTR) uses 5-CH3-THF as a methyl group donor to remethylate homocysteine
  (Hcy) to methionine (Met). Methionine adenosyltransferase converts methionine to
  Sadenosylmethionine (SAM), which donates a methyl group to various methyl transferases,
  including catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Methylation of L-dopa is catalyzed
  by COMT, which drives the production of S- adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which can
  be reversibly hydrolyzed to Hcy. The production of Hcy is regulated by the enzymes
  MTR, cystathionine β-synthase, and betaine-Hcy methyltransferase. B-vitamins including
  folate, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 are cofactors for these enzymes, and deficiencies
  of these cofactors can lead to elevated Hcy.
