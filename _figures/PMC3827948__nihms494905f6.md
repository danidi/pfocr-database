caption: 'S4 controls FGF2-mediated signaling through RhoG-dependent macropinocytosis
  of the FGFR1-S4-FGF2 signaling complex. (A) Before FGFR1 and S4 are activated by
  FGF2, RhoG is kept inactive by S4 (in complex with synectin and RhoGDI1), and Rab5
  activity and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 are low at baseline. (B) Upon ligand binding,
  FGFR1 and S4 form a signaling complex, and independent signaling pathways are initiated
  by each co-receptor: Tyrosine kinase phosphorylation of FGFR1 activates several
  parallel signaling networks, and S4 releases inactive RhoG to become activated by
  GEFs such as SGEF. This induces membrane ruffling and subsequent macropinocytosis
  of the entire receptor complex. In the absence of functional Rab5, nascent vesicles
  cannot mature and become fully functional signaling endosomes, which leads to inadequate
  activation of the MAPK pathway (as indicated by diminished phosphorylation of ERK1/2).
  (C) Physiological signaling (designated by a double-border) is restored as functional
  Rab5 localizes to nascent macropinosomes containing FGFR1-S4-FGF2 and becomes activated,
  facilitating vesicle maturation. This permits effective activation of the MAPK pathway
  (as indicated by ERK1/2 phosphorylation). (D) In the absence of S4 or S4’s cytoplasmic
  PDZ domain, RhoG activity is high at baseline, causing increased membrane ruffling
  and macropinocytosis. Enhanced macropinocytosis leads to increased co-receptor internalization.
  Rab5 promotes vesicular maturation, leading to potentiated ERK1/2 activity with
  slower deactivation kinetics upon FGF2 stimulation. Green and black denote activation,
  and purple denotes the process of vesicular maturation into early/signaling endosomes.'
