caption: Dietary nutrients are converted to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)
  through discrete endogenous biosynthetic routes. The de novo pathway converts tryptophan
  to NAD+ via a series of enzymatic steps. Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a
  rate-limiting enzyme that catalyses the first step in this pathway, the conversion
  of tryptophan to N-formylkynurenine (not shown). Quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase
  (QPRT) catalyses the conversion of quinolinic acid to nicotinate mononucleotide
  (NAMN). This bottleneck step commits the pathway to NAD+synthesis. The Preiss–Handler
  pathway converts the acid form of vitamin B3, nicotinic acid (also known as niacin),
  to NAMN. This conversion is catalysed by nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT).
  NAMN is converted to NAD+ by the sequential action of nicotinamide mononucleotide
  adenylyl transferases (NMNATs) and NAD synthetase (NADSYN). The salvage pathway
  converts the base analogue of vitamin B3, nicotinamide (Nam; also known as niacinamide),
  to NAD+ via the rate-limiting enzyme Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Nam
  mononucleotide (NMN) is a measurable intermediate in this pathway that can also
  be obtained through supplements and synthesized from the dietary precursor nicotinamide
  riboside. The salvage pathway is so named because NAD+ is ‘reclaimed’ from the Nam
  product of enzymes that consume NAD+ to generate ADP-ribose (ADPR) or cyclic ADPR
  (cADPR). NAD+ is converted to NAD+ phosphate (NADP+) by NAD+ kinases (NADKs). Hydride
  transfer from NADH to NADP+ by nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) also
  generates NADPH. NRKs, nicotinamide riboside kinases.
