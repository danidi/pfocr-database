caption: VHF and pathogenicity have some signaling mechanisms in common. The Fmk1
  MAPK cascade regulates both VHF and virulence-related functions such as adhesion
  and invasive growth. By contrast, Fso1 functions in a distinct pathway which is
  essential for VHF but contributes only marginally to virulence, indicating that
  VHF is not essential for pathogenicity on plants.
