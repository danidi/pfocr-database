caption: Model of production and uptake of siderophores by C. violaceum and their
  importance to bacterial virulence. C. violaceum produces at least two putative siderophores
  (chromobactin and viobactin) assembled by the NRPSs CbaF and VbaF from the common
  precursor 2,3-DHB (complete pathway for 2,3-DHB synthesis is indicated). These siderophores
  are exported into the extracellular milieu, bound to Fe3+, and taken up by the TBDRs
  CbuA and VbuA, allowing bacteria to overcome the iron limitation imposed by the
  host. The absence of both siderophores decreased the bacterial virulence by imposing
  iron starvation. The inability to take up both siderophores caused extracellular
  siderophore accumulation in the host, inhibition of the NET production by neutrophils,
  and robust reduction of virulence (events indicated by heavy red “x”). Question
  marks indicate siderophore transporters yet unknown.
