caption: 'The regulatory mechanisms of tsRNAs. tsRNAs are involved in a variety of
  biological processes: (A) Regulate rRNA synthesis by acting as a part of the pre‐rRNA
  splicing complex; (B) Regulate the reverse transcription process of some viral RNAs;
  (C) Response to the stress by triggering the formation of stress granules; (D) inhibit
  mRNA translation initiation by connecting with the translation initiation complex;
  (E) Regulate mRNA stability in canonical miRNA pathway; (F) Regulate mRNA stability
  in non‐canonical miRNA pathway; (G) Regulate oncogenic mRNA stability. miRNA, microRNA;
  RISC, ‐induced silencing complex; rRNA, ribosome RNA; RT, reverse transcription;
  YB‐1, Y‐box binding protein 1'
