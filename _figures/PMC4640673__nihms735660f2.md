caption: ECM receptors control a key set of biochemical signaling modules, shown here
  within a dendritic spine. Integrins can activate a number of kinase signaling cascades
  that regulate downstream proteins to modulate the actin cytoskeleton and control
  dendrite and synapse stability. Additionally, some of these cascades activate NMDA
  receptors via phosphorylation of different NMDA subunit intracellular tails, which
  leads to calcium (Ca2+) influx and the induction of LTP. Very low-density lipoprotein
  (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E (ApoER2) signal through a well-characterized pathway
  to Disabled-1 (DAB1). Finally, syndecans can activate the actin regulatory molecule
  cortactin to control F-actin stability and impact synaptic function. Together, these
  pathways impact cytoskeletal regulation, LTP induction, neuronal morphology, and
  stability.
