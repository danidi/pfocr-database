caption: 'Proposed model: EGF triggers nuclear PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, local InsP3 production,
  and Ca2+ release into the nucleoplasm through intra-nuclear PLCδ4, which mediates
  cell proliferation. Scheme of the proposed EGF-induced nuclear Ca2+signaling pathway.
  Upon EGF binding EGFR is activated and initiates signal transducer cascades. EGFR
  is shuttled to the nucleus to induce downstream targets. PLCδ4 is a nuclear enzyme
  induced by EGF stimulus and leads to PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis that generates InsP3 and
  DAG. InsP3 binds to InsP3R present on the inner nuclear envelope triggering Ca2+
  release in the nucleoplasm. DAG can activate nuclear-resident PKCs. Ca2+ and PKCs
  can activate downstream targets which ultimately result in cell proliferation.'
