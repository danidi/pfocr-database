caption: Proposed regulatory mechanism of Sch9 and Hsf1 in thermotolerance of C. neoformans.
  C. neoformans Sch9 regulates thermotolerance in an Hsf1-dependent and Hsf1-independent
  manner. In response to temperature upshift, HSF1 transcript levels decrease partly
  in an Sch9-dependent manner. However, under basal conditions, protein levels, not
  transcript levels, of Hsf1 appear to be positively regulated by Sch9, suggesting
  that Sch9 may be involved in Hsf1 stability. Hsf1 is required for growth and control
  genes involved in oxidative stress response and thermotolerance. Hsf1 may regulate
  thermotolerance both positively and negatively. Hsf1 directly binds to the step-type-like
  HSEs within the promoter region of HSPs even under unstressed conditions and its
  binding markedly increases upon temperature upshift. Hsf1 increases the expression
  of KAR2, a known downstream factor of the UPR pathway. The UPR pathway is also involved
  in C. neoformans thermotolerance. In conclusion, Sch9 is involved in thermotolerance
  by regulating Hsf1, the UPR pathway, and other unknown HSP factors in C. neoformans.

  description: Proposed regulatory mechanism of Sch9 and Hsf1 in thermotolerance of
    C. neoformans. C. neoformans Sch9 regulates thermotolerance in an Hsf1-dependent
    and Hsf1-independent manner. In response to temperature upshift, HSF1 transcript
    levels decrease partly in an Sch9-dependent manner. However, under basal conditions,

    by Sch9, suggesting that Sch9 may be involved in Hsf1 stability. Hsf1 is required
    for growth and control genes involved in oxidative stress response and thermotolerance.
    Hsf1 may regulate thermotolerance both positively and negatively. Hsf1 directly
    binds to the step-type-like HSEs within the promoter region of HSPs even under
    unstressed conditions and its binding markedly increases upon temperature upshift.
    Hsf1 increases the expression of KAR2, a known downstream factor of the UPR pathway.
    The UPR pathway is also involved in C. neoformans thermotolerance. In conclusion,
    Sch9 is involved in thermotolerance by regulating Hsf1, the UPR pathway, and other
    unknown HSP factors in C. neoformans.
