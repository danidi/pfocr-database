caption: Mannose-6-phosphate biosynthetic pathway. Biosynthesis starts with a co-translational
  transfer of a 14-sugar glycan precursor, onto an asparagine residue of a nascent
  polypeptide (steps 1–4). Next, the modified protein undergoes sequential trimming
  by glucosidases and mannosidase that remove glucose and mannose moieties, respectively
  (steps 4–7). Loss of one mannose residue in step 7 serves as a checkpoint of a proper
  folding state of a protein and enables transfer to the cis-Golgi (steps 7–8). As
  the protein traverses the Golgi it undergoes further modification by a GlcNAc-phosphotransferase
  to obtain the M6P tag enabling recognition of the M6P modified proteins and subsequent
  transfer into the lysosome. Note that the steps 1–7 occur in the endoplasmic reticulum,
  whereas steps 8–11 occur in the Golgi compartment.
