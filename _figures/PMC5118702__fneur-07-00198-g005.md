caption: Molecular and biological pathway interaction map analysis of altered proteins
  from the CCI samples (1 vs. 7 days post-CCI). Using Pathway Studio 9.0, altered
  proteins relevant to CCI at different time points were analyzed. The network was
  generated using “direct interaction” algorithm to map biological processes and interactions
  among altered proteins. Several processes believed to be central to the pathogenesis
  of CCI were identified using this search. (A) Examples of those processes including
  apoptosis, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and autophagy were shown to
  be altered at day 1. (B) Similarly, at day 7, processes including apoptosis, inflammatory
  response, oxidative stress, ischemia as well as cell regeneration and cell growth
  were shown to be altered. The red color represents upregulated proteins, while the
  blue color signifies proteins that are downregulated.
