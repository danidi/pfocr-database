caption: Schematic model of WRAP53β function in the DDR pathway. (Step 1) In response
  to IR, γH2AX and MDC1 accumulate at DSBs independently of WRAP53β. ATM-mediated
  phosphorylation of MDC1 makes MDC1 competent to bind RNF8. However, RNF8 is not
  yet localized at DSBs. (Step 2) WRAP53β is recruited to sites of DNA damage in an
  ATM-, H2AX-, and MDC1-dependent manner. Simultaneous binding of MDC1 and RNF8 to
  WRAP53β facilitates their direct interaction and retention of RNF8 at DSBs. (Step
  3) Once assembled at DSBs, RNF8 catalyzes ubiquitylation of H2AX. Ubiquitylation
  at DSBs enables recruitment and accumulation of 53BP1, BRCA1, and RAD51 and subsequent
  DNA repair.
