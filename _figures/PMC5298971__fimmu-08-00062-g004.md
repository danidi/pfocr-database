caption: Schematic overview of the three major bile salt pathways throughout vertebrate
  evolution. All bile acids are derived from cholesterol, a 27-carbon molecule. In
  early fish, e.g., hagfish and sea lamprey, a 7α-hydrocholesterol is converted to
  5α-bile alcohols, followed by conversion to 5α-bile alcohol sulfate. The production
  of bile salts in mammals, birds, cartilaginous fish, and in some teleost and amphibians
  is dependent on the conversion of 7α-hydrocholesterol into 5β-bile alcohol. In cartilaginous
  fish, mainly, but also in some teleost and amphibians, 5β-bile alcohol is further
  converted to 5β-bile alcohol sulfates (“Later pathway”). In mammals and birds, as
  depicted in the “Recent pathway,” bile salt production involves the conversion of
  5β-bile alcohol to 24-carbon bile acids in the liver (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic
  acid) by cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation. When these bile acids are secreted
  into the lumen of the intestine, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are converted,
  by colonic bacteria, to the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid and lithocholic
  acid, respectively. While secondary bile acids in higher concentrations are potentially
  toxic to cells, they can, together with primary bile acids, be taken up into the
  blood stream and liver for re-secretion. In all pathways, the production of 7α-hydroxylation
  is the rate-limiting step in these reactions. Figure based on Ekins et al. ().
