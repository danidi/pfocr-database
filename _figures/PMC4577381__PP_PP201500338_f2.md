caption: 'Oxygen (O2) and nitric oxide () signal transduction via N-end rule regulation
  of ERFVII stability. Arabidopsis ERFVII transcription factors are transcribed either
  constitutively and/or in response to several upstream signals, including ethylene.
  MET AMINOPEPTIDASE (MetAP) enzymes cleave -Met cotranslationally to reveal -Cys
  (C). In the presence of oxygen and  (which may be derived from a variety of cellular
  sources: NR, nitrate reductase; NOA1, nitric oxide associated protein1), -Cys is
  oxidized to Cys-sulfinic or Cys-sulfonic acid (C*). This oxidation is facilitated
  by PLANT CYS OXIDASE (PCO) enzymes (). Oxidized -Cys is then arginylated (R) by
  ARGINYL tRNA TRANSFERASES (ATE1/2). -Arg-ERFVII is recognized by the N-end rule
  E3 ligase (N-recognin) PROTEOLYSIS6 (PRT6), which targets the protein for proteasomal
  degradation via polyubiquitination (Ubi; ; ). ERFVII degradation initiates germination,
  inhibits hypocotyl growth, stimulates stomatal closure, represses the hypoxia transcriptional
  response, and promotes photomorphogenesis. In conditions in which either oxygen
  or  (or both) become limiting, -Cys oxidation is inhibited, and ERFVIIs are stabilized
  (). Stable ERFVIIs promote anaerobic gene expression, maintain seed dormancy and
  open stomata, promote hypocotyl growth, and repress photomorphogenesis. Regulation
  of ERFVII stability by the N-end rule pathway therefore controls the homeostatic
  response to oxygen and  availability.'
