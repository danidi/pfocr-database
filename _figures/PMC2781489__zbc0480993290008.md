caption: Schematic representation showing the signaling and functional consequences
  from uPA-uPAR-integrin interactions and model of the plausible signaling events
  regulated by ECRG2. A, at the leading edge of migrating cells, the uPAR binds inactive
  urokinase (pro-uPA), which is then converted to active uPA. uPAR lacks a cytosolic
  domain but transmits intracellular signals through its association with transmembrane
  integrins. uPA-bound uPAR frequently interacts with α3β1 or α5β1 integrin, causing
  its activation. This leads to integrin-dependent recruitment of Src, FAK, or PI3K,
  which results in activation of MAPK signaling. B, model of ECRG2 regulating cell
  migration and invasion. The binding of ECRG2 to the uPA·uPAR complex blocks the
  interaction of uPAR with α3β1 or α5β1 integrin and results in integrin inactivation,
  disassembly of the uPA·uPAR·integrin complex, inactivation of its intracellular
  signaling components, and reduced Src/MAP kinase activation.
