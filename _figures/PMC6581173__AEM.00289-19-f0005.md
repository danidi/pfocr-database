caption: Hypothesized metabolic pathway of methylphosphonate in Prochlorococcus strain
  MIT9301. Methylphosphonate (MPn) is transported across the cell membrane (gray lines)
  by the PtxABC ATP-binding cassette transport system. MPn carbon is hydroxylated
  by PhnY, an Fe(II)/α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, forming hydroxymethylphosphonate
  (HMPn). PhnZ, an Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase of the histidine-aspartate hydrolase
  superfamily, completes the oxidation of MPn to formate and inorganic phosphate (Pi).
  Formate can be excreted through the cell membrane by simple diffusion or by an unknown
  transporter. Formate is also assimilated by PurT to form FGAR (formyl-glycinamide
  ribose). FGAR is further modified in the synthesis of purine ribonucleotides.
