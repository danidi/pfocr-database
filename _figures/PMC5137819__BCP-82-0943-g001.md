caption: The phosphatidylinositol‐3 kinase (PI3K)–AKT PI3K‐AKT pathway is activated
  upstream by ligand binding to a growth factor receptor, in this case a receptor
  tyrosine kinase (RTK). Activated phosphotyrosine residues of the RTK interact with
  src‐homology 2 (SH2) domains on PI3K, as well as other SH2‐containing proteins.
  This leads to generation of the important lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5‐trisphosphate (PIP3). AKT localizes to the cell membrane through interactions
  of its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with PIP3, which ultimately leads to phosphorylation
  and activation of AKT by phosphoinositide‐dependent kinase (PDK) 1 and PDK2. AKT
  activates and inhibits a number of effector proteins via phosphorylation, including
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), IκB kinase (IKK), mouse double minute 2 homolog
  (Mdm2), Bad, p27, glycogen synthase kinase‐3 (GSK3) and forkhead family of transcription
  factors (FOXO) 1,4. The net result is increased cell survival and proliferation.
  P, phosphate; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5‐bisphosphate; PTEN, phosphatase and
  tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10
