caption: 'The optimal pathway for threonine production calculated from iJO1366 model
  and the related genetic engineering targets used in this study. Red lines indicate
  reactions in the threonine bypass. Through threonine bypass, the theoretical mole
  yield of PHB was increased from 1 to 1.26. The metabolites are: F6P fructose 6-phosphate,
  FBP fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, GAP d-Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, DHAP dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate, PEP phosphoenolpyruvate, Pyr pyruvate, OAA oxaloacetate, Asp aspartate,
  A4P aspartyl-4-phosphate, ASA aspartate semialdehyde, Hser homoserine, PHS homoserine
  phosphate, Thr threonine, AKB 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate, Gly glycine, Ser serine, MTHF
  methylene-tetrahydropteroylpolyglutamates, Glu glutamate, AKG 2-oxoglutarate'
