caption: 'Mechanisms of secretion of protective factors. Stem cells secrete neurotrophic
  factors or generate EVs mainly containing proteins, lipids, and RNA with multiple
  neuroprotective effects: inhibiting the activation of microglia and astrocyte, and
  also promoting microglia shift to the anti-inflammatory phenotype instead of the
  pro-inflammatory; downregulating Th1 and Th2 and upregulating Th17 and Treg; promoting
  the migration, differentiation, and secretion of neurotrophic factors to the ischemic
  periphery; upregulating the content of many factors including VEGF, bFGF, and NGF
  in the ischemic periphery; and mediating angiogenesis and neuroprotection through
  the induction of MEK/ERK/MAPK and Notch signaling pathway. Abbreviations: ↑, upregulation;
  ↓, downregulation; EVs, extracellular vesicles; NSCs, neural stem cells; Th, T helper
  cells; Treg, regulatory T cells; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; bFGF,
  basic fibroblast growth factor; NGF, nerve growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAP kinase.'
