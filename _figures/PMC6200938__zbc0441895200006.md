caption: Schematic of Rag-independent Gln stimulation of mTORC1 via PLD-derived PA.
  We have shown that Gln, which enters the cell through SLC1A5, can be metabolized
  into αKG via either GOT or GDH in the presence or absence of Leu. Although αKG has
  been shown previously to activate mTORC1 by stimulating GTP loading of RagB for
  its subsequent activation (), in this study, we have shown that αKG can activate
  mTORC1 independently of RagA/B. It remains unclear how αKG activates the Arf1–RalA–Rheb–PLD
  signaling apparatus independently of Rag GTPases; however, PA can activate mTORC1
  in the absence of any of the GTPases and in the absence of Gln. The Rag-independent
  pathway for mTORC1 activation is also independent of Leu. However, Leu can be brought
  into the cell in exchange for Gln via SLC7A5/SLC3A2, is a potent activator of Rag
  signaling to mTORC1, and can stimulate glutaminolysis through the activation of
  GDH (, , ).
