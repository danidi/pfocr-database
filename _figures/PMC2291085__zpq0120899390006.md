caption: A model of the role of the MAPKKKα/MEKK1–MKK4/MKK5–MPK3/MPK6 cascade in regulating
  camalexin biosynthesis in plants challenged by pathogens. A simplified camalexin
  biosynthetic pathway and its regulatory pathway are placed in separate rectangular
  boxes with dashed outlines. Genes identified by genetic screens (PAD1 to PAD4) are
  boxed. Enzymes whose encoding genes are induced by pathogen infection and MPK3/MPK6
  activation are marked by bold font. One arrow may represent multiple steps because
  of unknown components.
