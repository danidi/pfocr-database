caption: 'Extended model for the cyclin/Cdk network driving the mammalian cell cycle.
  The model presented in a simplified manner is composed of four modules centred on
  the main cyclin/Cdk complexes: cyclin D/Cdk4–6, cyclin E/Cdk2, cyclin A/Cdk2 and
  cyclin B/Cdk1, which control the successive phases G1, S, G2 and M of the cell cycle
  depicted on the right part of the figure. Entry from a quiescent phase G0 (not shown)
  into phase G1 of the cell cycle is driven by GFs and/or sufficient stiffness of
  the ECM. Defining a serum-dependent growth pathway, the presence of GFs elicits
  the activation of signalling pathways leading to the synthesis of AP1; this transcription
  factor in turn promotes the synthesis of cyclin D, which is followed by entry into
  G1. Defining an anchorage-dependent growth pathway, ECM stiffness activates the
  FAK, which eventually leads to the synthesis of cyclin D that elicits entry into
  the cell cycle. Entry in the cell cycle is impeded by contact inhibition at high
  cell density, via the Hippo/YAP pathway. Also indicated are the antagonistic roles
  of the transcription factor E2F and the tumour suppressor pRB, which, respectively,
  promote and impede cell cycle progression. Because it incorporates the external
  control of the Cdk network by the ECM via FAK, on one hand, and by cell density
  via Hippo and YAP, on the other hand, the model represents an extension of its previous
  version presented in []. Cyclin D/Cdk4–6 and cyclin E/Cdk2 drive progression in
  G1 and the G1/S transition by phosphorylating, and thereby inhibiting, pRB. Cyclin
  A/Cdk2 allows progression in S and G2, while cyclin B/Cdk1 brings about the G2/M
  transition. The active, unphosphorylated form of pRB inhibits E2F, which promotes
  cell cycle progression by inducing the synthesis of cyclins D, E and A. The protein
  Cdh1, inhibited by cyclin A/Cdk2, promotes the degradation of cyclin B, and inhibits
  Skp2, which promotes the degradation of cyclin E; activation of cyclin A/Cdk2 thus
  leads to the activation of cyclin B/Cdk1 and to the inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2.
  The protein Cdc20, activated by cyclin B/Cdk1, promotes the degradation of cyclin
  A and cyclin B, which leads to the decrease in cyclin A/Cdk2 and cyclin B/Cdk1.
  The roles of the Cdk inhibitor p21/p27 and of the Cdk inhibitory kinase Wee1 are
  also indicated, together with the positive feedback loop involving Wee1 and Cdk1;
  the role of the phosphatase Cdc25 which activates Cdk1 and is activated by it, thus
  creating another positive feedback loop, is not indicated for the lack of space
  (see the electronic supplementary material in [] for more detailed schemes of the
  model for the Cdk network). The regulatory interactions between the four Cdk modules
  give rise to sustained Cdk oscillations (figures –), which allow the repetitive,
  ordered progression along the successive phases of the cell cycle (see also [,]).
  Electronic supplementary material, tables S1 and S2 provide a list of all variables
  and parameters considered in the model. (Online version in colour.)'
