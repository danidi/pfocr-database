caption: As proposed in , two sets of uterine Tregs could be generated during pregnancy.
  Semen/seminal fluid specific Tregs develop early and populate the implantation site.
  Their depletion or their poor development and recruitment may lead to implantation
  failure. Importantly, we propose that uterine Tregs could also be converted into
  inflammatory Tregs in response to bacterial and viral triggers. This could also
  lead to excessive production of TNF-α and presence of Th17 T cells. This pathway
  will be the cause of break-down in immune tolerance and angiogenesis and eventually
  lead to fetal loss. Tregs are identified as cells intrinsically expressing surface
  T cell markers CD4 and CD25 and the nuclear transcription factor FoxP3.
