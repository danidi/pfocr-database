caption: 'TLR4 signaling pathway in the DN on the basis of literatures. Activation
  of TLR4 initiates the MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways. Moreover,
  the pathways converge in the activation of NF-κB, which is responsible for the synthesis
  and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules,
  and profibrotic markers involved in inflammation and fibrosis, eventually leading
  to diabetic nephropathy. HSPs: heat shock proteins; HMGB1: high-mobility-group box
  1.'
