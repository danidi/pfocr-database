caption: Cell–cell communication and cyclic AMP coordinates oocyte meiotic maturation
  in worms and mammals. (a) In C. elegans, in the absence of the sperm signal, the
  Gαo/i pathway in somatic sheath cells surrounding the oocyte (pink) leads to the
  inactivation of adenylate cyclase 4 (ACY-4) and protein kinase A (PKA). This inhibition
  blocks MAP kinase (MAPK) activation and oocyte meiotic maturation. Additionally,
  the VAB-1/Ephrin Receptor in the oocyte also inhibits MAPK and oocyte maturation.
  Presence of the major sperm protein (MSP) antagonizes both the somatic Gαo/i and
  oocyte VAB-1 signaling pathways and activates Gαs pathway in the somatic sheath
  cells resulting in MAPK activation and meiotic maturation. (Adapted from  reprinted
  with express permission from David Greenstein and Current Biology.) (b) Cyclic AMP
  in the oocyte inhibits meiotic maturation in mammals. cGMP produced by the cumulus
  somatic cells enters the oocyte via the gap junctions (via currently unknown mechanisms)
  to inhibit PDE3A. PDE3A hydrolyses cAMP. Binding of luteinizing hormone (LH) to
  its G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) (blue) activates the cAMp pathway and enables
  meiotic maturation via promoting GVBD
