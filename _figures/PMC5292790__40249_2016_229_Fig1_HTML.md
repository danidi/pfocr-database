caption: Immune response in the polar clinical forms of leprosy. a In tuberculoid
  leprosy (TT) patients, the innate immune response is activated by M. leprae through
  toll-like receptors (TLR2/1). IL-15 stimulates the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial
  program in macrophages and inhibits phagocytosis of mycobacteria. These events promote
  a Th1 T-cell cytokine response (IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF, and IL-15) that contains the infection
  in well-formed granulomas, and a Th17 response (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21 and IL-22)
  that leads to tissue inflammation and destruction, neutrophil recruitment, macrophage
  activation, and enhancement of Th1 effector cells. b In lepromatous leprosy (LL)
  patients, IL-4, IL-10, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor subfamily A member
  2 (LILRA2), and oxidized phospholipids inhibit TLR2/1-induced cytokine responses
  but preserve IL-10 release. In addition, immune complexes trigger IL-10 production
  and increase phagocytosis of M. leprae, ApoB, haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex and
  oxidized phospholipids by macrophages through the receptors CD209 and CD163, without
  activating the vitamin D-dependent antimicrobial pathway. The foamy appearance of
  macrophages is due to the accumulation of lipid droplets (LD) inside these cells.
  There is an upregulation of perilipin and the adipose differentiation-related protein
  in the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi complex with the formation of vesicles containing
  lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol ester, and cholesterol. Further, there is an
  increase in both the synthesis of LDL receptors (such as CD36, LDL-R, SBA-1, SR-B1,
  and LRP-1) and uptake of endogenous cholesterol that accumulates intracellularly.
  This induces a Th2 and Treg immune profile, with the production of IL-4 and IL-10,
  antibody production, absence of granulomas, and failure to restrict M. leprae growth
