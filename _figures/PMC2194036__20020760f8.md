caption: 'Biosynthetic scheme proposed for resolvins: aspirin-triggered omega-3-derived
  products. Acetylation of COX-2 by ASA treatment generates novel 17R-H(p)DHA from
  DHA that is reduced to its corresponding alcohol and converted via sequential actions
  of a leukocyte 5–LO and leads to formation of both dihydroxy- and trihydroxy-containing
  docosanoids that retain their 17R configuration. Pathways are denoted in blue for
  omega oxidation products that are likely to be in vivo markers of enzymatic inactivation.
  The resolvin pathways appear to be maximally induced during the “spontaneous resolution”
  phase of inflammation and compounds are activated to dampen PMN infiltration, which
  reduces exudate PMN numbers to promote proresolution of inflammatory exudates (resolvins
  from EPA, the 18R-HEPE series, are denoted in green) that leads to potent inhibitors
  of PMN recruitment in vitro and in vivo (see pathway, right, text, and reference
  ). The complete stereochemistries of the new di- and tri-hydroxy–containing compounds
  remain to be established and are depicted here in their likely configuration based
  on biogenic total synthesis. See  and text for further details.'
