caption: Autophagy contributes to integrin recycling and degradation. Cell migration
  is dependent on integrin recycling, where integrins are endocytosed, recycled back
  to the plasma membrane, or degraded in the lysosome. Canonical integrin recycling
  is depicted, including short-loop integrin recycling (pink arrows), long-loop integrin
  recycling (blue arrows), and endosome-mediated trafficking of integrins to the lysosome
  or to the plasma membrane for exosome secretion (black arrows). The autophagy pathway
  (green arrows) converges with and contributes to endosomal integrin trafficking
  pathways at several points, including in the formation of amphisomes, vesicle trafficking
  from RAB11 recycling endosomes to growing phagophores, and autophagy-mediated delivery
  of integrins to lysosomes.
