caption: IR can promote a G2 arrest in cells with and without wild-type p53 at least
  in part by increasing Wee1 and Chk1 activity. Passage from G2 phase into mitosis
  requires the activity of Cyclin B/Cdc2 complexes. Cdc2 is inactivated through phosphorylation
  at Tyr15 by Wee1 kinase. The phosphatase cdc25 activates Cdc2 by dephosphorylating
  Tyr15. Chk1 phosphorylates and thereby inhibits cdc25. IR activates Chk1 and Wee1
  to promote p53-independent G2 arrest. IR also activates the p53 signaling pathway
  in cells expressing wild-type p53, leading to increased levels of p21. P21 can also
  inhibit Cdc2/Cyclin B complexes preventing entry into mitosis. GA binds and inhibits
  HSP90 leading to degradation of Wee1 and Chk1 which decreases inhibitory phosphorylation
  on Cdc2 allowing cells to enter mitosis. However, in p53 wild-type cells p21 maintains
  G2 arrest by retaining Cyclin B1/Cdc2 complexes in an inactive state.
