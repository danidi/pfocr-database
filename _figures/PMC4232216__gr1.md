caption: BMP Family and Signaling Pathways. (A) Phylogenetic analysis of the human
  BMP family members. The human BMP full-length precursor protein sequences and coding
  region sequences were analyzed using Phylogeny.fr. The branch length is proportional
  to the number of substitutions per site. (a) Phylogenetic analysis was performed
  using the amino acid sequence of human BMPs. (b) Phylogenetic analysis was carried
  out using the coding region of human BMPs. (B) BMPs signal via the canonical, Smad-dependent
  pathway or various non-canonical pathways. In the canonical pathway, BMPs initiate
  the signal transduction cascade by binding to type I or type II serine/threonine
  kinase receptors and forming a heterotetrameric complex. The constitutively active
  type II receptor then transphosphorylates the type I receptor, and the type I receptor
  phosphorylates the R-Smads (Smad1/5/8). Phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 associates with
  the co-Smad (Smad4), and the complex translocates to the nucleus where it further
  associates with coactivators or corepressors to regulate gene expression. Various
  non-canonical pathways, including the MAPK cascade, can also lead to regulation
  of gene expression. BMP signaling is modulated extracellularly (e.g., Noggin), intracellularly
  (e.g., FKBP12, microRNAs, phosphatases, and I-Smads), and by co-receptors in the
  plasma membrane (e.g., Endoglin).
