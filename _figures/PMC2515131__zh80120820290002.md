caption: Signal transduction events initiated by Kit and FcϵRI leading to specific
  mast cell responses, and the integration of these pathways for the synergistic enhancement
  of mast cell mediator release. Dimerization of Kit, following ligation by SCF, results
  in activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and autophosphorylation
  of specific tyrosine residues on its cytosolic tail. These phosphorylated residues
  provide docking sites for critical signaling molecules including Src kinases, Shc,
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). Subsequent activation
  of the Ras-Raf-Map kinase (MAPK) cascade via the GTP exchanger Sos, PI3K, PLCγ,
  and JAK2 leads to the enhanced concentrations of Ca2+, and activation of transcription
  factors and survival pathways necessary for mast cell growth, differentiation, survival,
  cell migration, adhesion, and cytokine production. The Src kinases Lyn and Fyn may
  also contribute to some of these responses. Aggregation of FcϵRI, following binding
  of antigen to antigen-specific IgE molecules occupying the FcϵRI, results in recruitment
  of the tyrosine kinase Syk to the γ chain-ITAMs following translocation to the lipid
  raft microdomains and phosphorylation of specific tyrosines within these motifs
  by Lyn. This results in activation of Syk and the phosphorylation of the transmembrane
  adaptor molecules LAT and NTAL that coordinate downstream signaling by providing
  multiple phosphotyrosine-based docking sites for associating molecules such as PLCγ1
  and the cytosolic adaptors Grb2, Gads, and Shc. These events regulate the activation
  of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2, which are required for calcium mobilization and PKC activation,
  essential signals for mast cell mediator release. A parallel pathway initiated by
  the tyrosine kinase, Fyn, leads to the activation of PI3K via the phosphorylation
  of the cytosolic adaptor Gab2. These events are also required for optimal degranulation
  and cytokine production, likely as a consequence of PI3K-dependent membrane association
  of the tyrosine kinase kinase, Btk, and activation of transcription factors. PI3K
  may also regulate the activation of sphingosine kinase (SK) and PLD, which produce
  the lipid mediators sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which
  also contribute to the critical calcium signal and PKC activation regulating mast
  cell mediator release. Concurrent with these events, the GTP exchangers Sos and
  Vav activate the Ras-Raf-MAPK pathway, which in turn contributes to the activation
  of specific transcription factors required for cytokine production. In addition,
  the MAPKs ERK1/2 control the activation of PLA2, which liberates arachidonic acid
  from membrane lipids for the subsequent generation of eicosanoids. NTAL appears
  to be a point of integration between the 2 pathways, providing an amplification
  mechanism also requiring PI3K and BTK, for the potentiation of antigen-dependent
  mediator release by SCF. Note that, although not depicted as such for clarity, many
  signaling events occur within specific microdomains within the cytosolic membrane.
  In addition, for clarity, several of the intermediary steps have been simplified
  and other pathways that may down-regulate mast cell activation have not been included.
