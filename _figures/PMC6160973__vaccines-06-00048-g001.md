caption: Innate and adaptive immune responses to recombinant Listeria. Listeria monocytogenes
  (Lm) is internalized by antigen-presenting cells into phagosomes. During entry,
  Lm is sensed by toll-like receptors leading to the activation of NFκ-B and synthesis
  of pro-inflammatory genes. Phagosomes may then fuse with lysosomes to form phagolysosomes
  where Lm can be killed, leading to loading of its antigens onto MHC class II for
  activation of CD4+ helper T cells. Alternatively, Lm can express the pore-forming
  toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) to perforate phagosomes and gain entry into the cytosol.
  Once in the cytosol, recombinant Lm secretes tumor-associated antigens (TAA) as
  fusion proteins with Lm antigens into the cytosol where they can be degraded by
  proteasomes and loaded onto MHC class I for activation of TAA-specific CD8+ cytotoxic
  T lymphocytes. Additionally, cytosolic Lm triggers further induction of pro-inflammatory
  pathways through secretion of the cyclic dinucleotide cyclic-di-AMP and detection
  of Lm DNA. Secreted cyclic-di-AMP directly stimulates the STING pathway and negatively
  regulates the NF-κB inhibitor RECON (not shown) [], while the presence of genomic
  Lm DNA can lead to the activation of STING and inflammasome pathways, both of which
  contribute to the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and cytokines.
