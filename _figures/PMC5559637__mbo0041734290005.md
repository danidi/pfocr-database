caption: Model of H. pylori cag-T4SS-dependent, NF-κB-driven innate immune response
  in gastric epithelial cells. A schematic representation of H. pylori factors that
  are delivered through the cag-T4SS into gastric epithelial cells to initiate the
  NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response is shown. The response is initiated by cytosolic
  delivery of HBP that activates TIFA, which may be phosphorylated at the Thr9 residue
  by kinase ALPK1 (). Phosphorylated TIFA forms oligomers that act as a scaffold to
  recruit and activate TRAF6, which in turn activates transcription factor NF-κB,
  which translocates into the nucleus and upregulates a suite of proinflammatory genes,
  including the IL-8 gene. Following TIFA activation, peptidoglycan (PG) delivered
  through the cag-T4SS activates NOD1, which ultimately amplifies NF-κB activation.
  Finally, CagA associates with host TAK1 and enhances its polyubiquitination, which
  is mediated by the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6. Polyubiquitinated TAK1 then activates
  NF-κB, further amplifying the proinflammatory cascade (, ). The HBP that is delivered
  through the cag-T4SS to activate TIFA is generated through the ADP-heptose biosynthesis
  pathway in the bacterial cytosol. Four H. pylori enzymes are involved in converting
  sedoheptulose-7-P into ADP-l,d-heptose. Two of these enzymes (marked with an asterisk),
  GmhA and HldE, appear to be essential in the G27 H. pylori strain. ADP-l,d-heptose
  and ADP-d,d-heptose are incorporated into the highly conserved core structure of
  H. pylori LPS, which consists of a hexa-saccharide (glucose—galactose-d,d-heptose
  [Hep III]—l,d-heptose [Hep II]—l,d-heptose [Hep I]—KDO). The variable O-antigen
  is directly attached to the Hep III molecule (). The LPS molecule is assembled in
  the bacterial cytosol, transported across the periplasm, and flipped across the
  outer bacterial membrane.
