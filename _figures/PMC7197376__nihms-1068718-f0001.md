caption: 'a, Rb is a type of protein known as a tumour suppressor, which can help
  to block cancer development. A common feature of lung cancer is Rb inactivation
  by the addition of phosphate groups (P) to the protein. This frequently occurs through
  a pathway that requires various enzymes: MAPK; Cdk4 and Cdk6; or Cdk2. b, Drugs
  that block the action of MAPK or Cdk4 and Cdk6 are in use in the clinic or under
  development for lung cancer treatment. Walter et al. studied a mouse model of lung
  cancer, and report that Cdk2 has a major role in inactivating Rb. Therefore, the
  development of drugs that target this protein might have promise in treating lung
  cancer, c, Rb expression is often lost in lung cancer cells (yellow). The authors
  studied the effect of Rb loss in mouse models of the cancer. The absence of Rb resulted
  in loss of cellular differentiation and an increase in the spread of cancer cells
  to other sites in the body through a process called metastasis. Proteins implicated
  in such changes, such as SOX2 and HMGA2, might offer targets for drug development.'
