caption: Biosynthetic pathways for PGE2 (1) and 15‐keto‐PGE2 (2) in mammals and algae.
  In the canonic pathway (thick red arrows), AA is converted by COX‐1 or COX‐2 into
  PGG2, which is subsequently reduced by the peroxidase activity of the COX to PGH2
  and converted by PGE2 synthase (PGES) into 1. In the novel pathway introduced here
  (thin red and thick green arrows), PGG2 is metabolized by a PGES‐like activity to
  the novel intermediate 15‐hydroperoxy‐PGE2 (3), which is reduced either enzymatically
  or non‐enzymatically to 1. 2 occurs as a metabolic by‐product. The contribution
  of both pathways to the formation of 1 differs between algae and mammals, probably
  due to different COX peroxidase activity.
