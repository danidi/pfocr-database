caption: 'Biosynthesis of VLC-PUFA and VLC-SFA. A: Schematic in vivo biosynthetic
  pathway from 18:3n3 and 18:2n6 mediated by ELOVL4 and other ELOVL family proteins.
  Desaturase and elongation steps are consecutively performed by fatty acid desaturase-1
  (FADS1 or Δ5 desaturase), fatty acid desaturase-2 (FADS2 or Δ6 desaturase), and
  ELOVL1-5. Although some elongases are specific for a single step, others are nonspecific
  or multifunctional and act at several steps (e.g., human ELOVL5 and murine ELOVL2).
  Panel A is an adapted reproduction from Man Yu et al. (). ©2012 by the American
  Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc. B: VLC-SFA biosynthesis pathway.
  Elongation steps from 18:0 to VLC-SFA by the different ELOVLs. C: Example of VLC-PUFA
  esterification in the retina: phosphatidylcholine containing the VLC-PUFA, 34:5n3
  and the LC-PUFA, 22:6n3 (DHA). D: Example of VLC-SFA amidification in the skin:
  ω-O-acylceramide containing the VLC-SFA, 28:0 ω-O-linked with 18:2n6. E: Example
  of VLC-SFA amidification in the brain: sphingomyelin containing the VLC-SFA, 30:0.
