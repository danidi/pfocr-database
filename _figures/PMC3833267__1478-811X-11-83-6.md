caption: 'The dominant-negative effect of STAT3-YF in the IL-6-induced STAT3 signaling
  pathway. The dominant-negative effect of STAT3-YF (red) on the WT-STAT3 (blue) activity
  in the cells relies on: 1) Competition in binding to phosphotyrosine motifs of the
  activated gp130-receptor 2) Formation of inactive, semiphosphorylated, non-DNA-binding
  heterodimers after IL-6 stimulation 3) Formation of preformed dimers between STAT3-YF
  and WT-STAT3 in the absence of IL-6 which reduces the capability of STAT3 to form
  active, DNA-binding homodimers after stimulation.'
