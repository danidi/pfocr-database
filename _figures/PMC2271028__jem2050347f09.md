caption: Schematic presentation of the roles of phospholipases A2 and their lipid
  products in monocyte chemotaxis to MCP-1. Recognition of MCP-1 by CCR2 activates
  parallel signaling pathway mediated by iPLA2β and cPLA2α. iPLA2β translocates to
  the pseudopod and regulates directionality and speed, likely by regulating actin
  polymerization and thereby inhibiting monocyte chemotaxis. cPLA2α translocates to
  the endoplasmic reticulum and regulates monocyte speed through AA or its metabolites.
  Both enzymes regulate the net migration of monocytes; therefore, deficiency of either
  of them inhibits chemotaxis of monocytes.
