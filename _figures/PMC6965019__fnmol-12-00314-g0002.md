caption: The TLR-MyD88 signaling pathway contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple
  sclerosis (MS). The TLR-MyD88 and TLR-TRIF signaling pathways activate dendritic
  cells (DCs), Th17 cells, Th1 cells, and B cells and increase pro-inflammatory cytokine
  secretion. These pathogenic DCs can also promote the activation of Th1 and Th17
  cells. Furthermore, the TLR signaling pathway destroys the blood brain barrier (BBB)
  and increases the expression of BBB-expressed adhesion molecules [ICAM-1 and vascular
  cell adhesion molecules (VCAM)-1] after being stimulated by PAMPs and endogenous
  danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The activation of these cells and
  the destruction of the BBB aggravate MS.
