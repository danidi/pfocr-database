caption: Newly identified IL4I1 which is induced by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB)
  mediates AHR signature genes through I3P-KynA/I3A metabolic pathway parallel to
  IDO1 and/or TDO2-driven AHR signaling. On one hand, IL4I1 can promote cancer cell
  motility and metastasis, on the other hand, it also inhibits T-cell proliferation
  and recruits suppressive immune cells
