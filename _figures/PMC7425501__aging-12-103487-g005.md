caption: MiR-1343 targeted RAF1 and LINC01559 positively regulated RAF1 via miR-1343-3p.
  (A) The prediction binding site of miR-1343-3p in RAF1 3’UTR. (B) Luciferase assay
  was applied to investigate the direct interaction between RAF1 and miR-1343-3p.
  (C) The RAF1 mRNA expression in miR-1343-3p mimic and miR-1343-3p inhibitor groups.
  (D) The RAF1 mRNA expression in shCtrl and shlinc01559 groups. (E) The RAF1 protein
  expression in shCtrl and shlinc01559 groups. (F) The relative expression of RAF1
  in nude mouse tumors. (G) The RAF1 mRNA expression after transfecting RAF1 vector
  or siRNA in PC cells. (H–J) Functional rescue experiments was performed to verify
  the effect of RAF1 vector on migration and proliferation in shlinc01559 group. (J)
  Western blotting showing the expression change of proteins involved in the ERK signaling
  pathway.
