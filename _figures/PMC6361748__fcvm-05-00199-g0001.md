caption: The role of PCSK9 in lipoprotein metabolism. The expression of LDLR and PCSK9
  are regulated by SREBP-2. The PCSK9 secreted from the endoplasmic reticulum to the
  Golgi apparatus, and then from trans-Golgi network into the medium. It can be sorted
  directly to lysosomes as a complex with the LDLR (intracellular pathway), or secreted
  into the plasma and then internalized with the LDLR into clathrin-coated endosomes
  for lysosomal degradation (Extracellular pathway). Both mechanisms result in the
  reduction of LDLR, and then LDL clearance from the circulation is reduced.; LDL-R,
  LDL receptor; SREBP-2, Sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2; HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl
  coenzyme A.
