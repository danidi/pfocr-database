caption: Model of FTY720-induced transporter endocytosis in yeast and human cells.
  (A) In yeast, exogenously supplied FTY720 molecules insert into the plasma membrane,
  thereby causing a decrease of the intrinsic activity of nutrient transporters, including
  amino acid permeases. The resulting decrease of nutrient uptake causes inhibition
  of the TORC1 kinase complex. This elicits activation of an unknown mechanism which
  then somehow stimulates the ability of the α-arrestin-family adaptor proteins and
  the Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase to promote permease ubiquitylation, triggering permease
  sorting into the endocytic pathway. (B) In mammalian cells, mTORC1 is regulated
  by nutrient availability and growth factors (GF). Addition of FTY720 similarly alters
  the inherent activity of nutrient transporters, including LAT1/SLC7A5, thereby causing
  mTORC1 inhibition. This reduced mTORC1 signaling contributes to stimulation of a
  mechanism involving a PP2A phosphatase which can activate a machinery, possibly
  dependent on ubiquitin, which promotes the endocytosis of nutrient transporters,
  including LAT1/SLC7A5. The signaling pathway responding to GFs also influences the
  cell-surface stability of nutrient transporters by regulating both mTORC1 and the
  PP2A-dependent mechanism under mTORC1 control. The presence of FTY720 inhibits both
  GF-dependent functions (via a mechanism involving a PP2A phosphatase), thereby contributing
  further to stimulation of transporter endocytosis.
