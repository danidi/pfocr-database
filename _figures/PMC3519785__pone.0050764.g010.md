caption: Ischemia induces intracellular ROS accumulation, antioxidant potential descent
  and lipid peroxidation, which causes Intracellular oxidative stress. Further, oxidative
  stress leads to elevation of intracellular [Ca2+]i, the increases in NO production
  by NF-κB/iNOS pathway and the activation of ASK1-MKK4/7 -JNK stress signaling pathway
  in cells. Finally, the above changes cause cell death. However, 20E markedly attenuates
  the above changes and protect from cell death.
