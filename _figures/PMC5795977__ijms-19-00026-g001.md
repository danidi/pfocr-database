caption: Schematic diagram of the Nrf2-Keap1-ARE signaling pathway. Under normal conditions,
  nuclear erythroid-2 like factor-2 (Nrf2) is constantly ubiquitinated through Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein1 (Keap1) and degraded in the proteasome. After exposure to
  oxidative stress (ROS), Keap1 is inactivated and Nrf2 becomes phosphorylated. Phosphorylated
  Nrf2 (p-Nrf2) accumulates in the nucleus and binds to antioxidant response element
  (ARE) sites, subsequently activating many genes including antioxidants, detoxifying
  enzymes, and transport molecules.
