caption: Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), the biosynthetic enzyme for cysteine is depleted
  in Huntington's disease (HD) at the transcriptional level. (A) CSE is a key enzyme
  in the reverse transsulfuration pathway which generates cysteine from its precursor,
  cystathionine. Cystathionine is synthesized by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) by
  condensing homocysteine derived from dietary methionine with serine. Both CSE and
  CBS generate the major gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from cysteine as well
  as homocysteine. In addition, cysteine serves as a building block for biosynthesis
  of the antioxidant glutathione. (B) Under normal conditions, CSE transcription is
  regulated by the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (SP1) in conjunction
  with associated coactivators such as TATA box binding protein (TBP), TBP-associated
  factor 4 (TAF4), subunits of the general transcription factor, transcription factor
  II D (TFIID). In HD, mutant huntingtin (mHtt)sequesters SP1 leading to a diminished
  expression of CSE, which results in lowered cysteine levels, elevated oxidative
  stress and neurodegeneration.
