caption: 'Figure 1. Two-component system interactions as drug targets. Model depicting
  perturbations in gene expression upon deletion of the qseC sensor in UPEC and how
  these perturbations could be exploited toward ablating UPEC virulence. (A) In the
  absence of QseC, the QseB response regulator becomes readily phosphorylated by another
  phosphodonor molecule that cannot adequately dephosphorylate and deactivate QseB.
  As a result, phosphorylated QseB accumulates at higher than normal levels, leading
  to dysregulation of multiple genes (representative examples are highlighted) including
  type 1 pili, and causing virulence attenuation. The observed downregulation of type
  1 pili stems, at least in part, from downregulation of TCA cycle genes. We have
  currently no evidence that QseB directly modulates expression of type 1 pili. (B)
  The pathway linking QseBC to fim gene expression can be exploited for the development
  of alternative therapeutics: (1) deletion of the QseC sensor can be recapitulated
  by identifying inhibitors that interfere with the QseC phosphatase activity, thereby
  enabling the QseB over-activation; (2) irreversible QseB activation may be chemically
  stimulated in the presence of QseC.'
