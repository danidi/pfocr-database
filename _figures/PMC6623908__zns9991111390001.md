caption: Schematic representation of the main metabolic pathways involved in MG production
  and elimination. A, B, MG is formed mainly by the fragmentation of the glycolytic
  intermediates glyceraldehyde-3P and DHAP (A), but also from the metabolism of lipids
  and proteins (B). PFK is the rate-limiting step of glycolysis and thus constitutes
  an important regulatory site, and one of its most potent allosteric activators is
  fructose-2,6-P2. Fructose-2,6-P2 levels are controlled by the Pfkfb, which is most
  abundantly expressed in astrocytes compared with neurons (). C, MG is detoxified
  principally via the glyoxalase system, which consists of the enzymes Glo-1 and Glo-2.
  The first step of MG detoxification requires its spontaneous reaction with GSH to
  form a hemithioacetal, which is used as a substrate by Glo-1 to form S-lactoylglutathione.
  Glo-2 then catalyzes the transformation of S-lactoylglutathione into d-lactate,
  recycling GSH in the process. D, The pentose phosphate pathway is linked to MG detoxification
  via the formation of NADPH, which is required for the recycling of GSH from its
  oxidized form (GSSG) via the action of glutathione reductase (GR).
