caption: Figure 1. Scheme of Type I and Type II apoptotic pathways. In the CD95 pathway,
  stimulation with CD95L of CD95 leads to formation of the death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC), where activation of procaspase-8 and procaspase-10 takes place.
  Caspase-8-mediated apoptosis occurs in different ways in type I vs. type II cells.
  Type I cells are characterized by high levels of DISC formation and increased amounts
  of active caspase-8 (left-hand side). Caspase-8 cleaves and thereby activates the
  downstream effector caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7. In type II cells, there
  are lower levels of CD95 DISC formation and, therefore, lower levels of active caspase-8
  (right-hand side). In this case, signaling requires an amplification loop that involves
  the cleavage by caspase-8 of the Bcl-2-family protein Bid to generate truncated
  (t) Bid and a subsequent tBid-mediated release of cytochrome C (cyt C) from mitochondria.
  The release of cyt C from mitochondria results in apoptosome formation, followed
  by the activation of initiator procaspase-9, which in turn cleaves downstream effector
  caspases. Type II CD95 signaling might be blocked by Bcl-2 family members such as
  Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Activation of procaspase-8 at the DISC can be blocked by c-FLIP
  proteins.
