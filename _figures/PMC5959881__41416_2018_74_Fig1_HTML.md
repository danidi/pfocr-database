caption: 'a Interaction between a tumour cell and a T cell. Tumour cells can activate
  T cells by presenting an antigen through major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
  to the T cell receptor (TCR). Under influence of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) tumours
  can express Programmed-Death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which inhibits TCR signalling by
  binding and activating Programmed-Death-1 (PD-1) expressed by T cells. b Proximal
  PD-1 pathway signalling. Activated PD-1 recruits SHP2, which inhibits ZAP70 function.
  ZAP70 is an important protein in the signalling pathway of the TCR. Complementary
  to its effect on ZAP70, SHP2 may also inhibit PI3K upon PD-1 activation. Both effects
  lead to inhibition of T cell activation. Note: the PD-1 pathway comprises many more
  proteins and signal transduction pathways, but these are omitted from this figure
  since they are not included in our analysis'
