caption: The diagram illustrates components and interactions in the mGluR pathway
  . Genes encoding proteins highlighted in yellow were sequenced in this study. Activation
  of postsynaptic group 1 mGluRs (mGluR1, mGluR5) stimulates protein synthesis by
  signaling through the Ras/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways. Group 1 mGluR function is
  modulated by interaction with Homer1, which interacts in turn with Shank3 and links
  mGluRs to the network of postsynaptic density-localized proteins. FMRP regulates
  synaptic protein synthesis by binding to target mRNAs and repressing their translation.
  Arc regulates mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity, and its levels are regulated
  by FMRP-dependent translation and Ube3a-dependent degradation. The activity of the
  mGluR pathway is regulated by several pathway components responsible for syndromic
  ASDs (indicated by asterisks), including NF1 (neurofibromatosis type 1), Ras/ERK
  cascade members (cardiofaciocutaneous/Noonan syndromes), PTEN (ASD with microcephaly),
  TSC1 and TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex), FMRP (fragile X mental retardation syndrome),
  and Ube3a (Angelman's syndrome). Mutations in Shank3, Nrxn1, Nlgn3, and Nlgn4 cause
  rare non-syndromic ASDs, and structural variants in SynGAP1 and DLGAP2/SAPAP2 have
  been associated with autism (indicated by asterisks) , , .
