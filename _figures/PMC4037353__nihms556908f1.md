caption: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate distinct aspects of the germinal center (GC)
  response. Upon priming by antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) in the T cell
  area of secondary lymphoid organs, naïve CD4+ T cells differentiate into effector
  T helper (Th) cells that migrate into the periphery where they mediate their effector
  functions. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are also generated during priming by
  DCs. These early Tfh cells upregulate the transcriptional repressor Bcl6 and the
  costimulatory molecule ICOS. Subsequent upregulation of the chemokine receptor CXCR5
  and downregulation of CCR7 enables these cells to localize to the T-B zone border
  and interfollicular regions where they interact with activated B cells in a cognate
  fashion. The induction of the Tfh cell gene expression program is dependent on miRNA
  expression by T cells. miR-17~92 promotes Tfh cell differentiation by repressing
  Pten and Phlpp2the latter being an important regulator downstream in the ICOS signaling
  pathway. In addition, miR-17~92 prevents co-expression of effector Th cell genes
  that are normally not expressed by Tfh cells through repression of Rora. The generation
  of T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cells residing in the GC is particularly sensitive
  to miR-17~92 dosage. miR-10a prevents the conversion of Foxp3+ Treg cells into Tfh
  cells under lymphopenic conditions. The Tfh gene expression program may serve as
  an intermediate state in effector Th cell subset differentiation, and Tfh cells
  may also persist as memory cells. While most activated B cells enter the extrafollicular
  pathway, some clones, together with Tfh cells, reenter the follicle in a process
  that requires Bcl6 and SLAM-associated protein (SAP) expression by B and T cells,
  respectively, to establish GCs. In these structures, B cells undergo somatic hypermutation,
  affinity maturation, and class switch recombination to generate memory B cells and
  long-lived plasma cells, which produce high-affinity antibodies. miRNA expression
  by B cells is required for robust GC B cell responses. miR-155 regulates several
  aspects of the GC reaction, exerting a positive net effect. Nevertheless, miR-155
  has also been shown to repress AID, a gene that is required for somatic hypermutation
  and class-switch recombination. miR-155 itself is regulated by Bcl6. miR-185 inhibits
  B cell activation, and overexpression of miR-150 or miR-181b inhibits GC B cell
  responses. Plasma cell differentiation is inhibited by miR-125b through repression
  of Blimp-1 and other targets. Overexpression of miR-155 or miR-17~92 promotes GC
  B cell lymphomagenesis. Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) might regulate miRNA expression
  in GC B cells through cell adhesion, a process that has also been correlated with
  lymphomagenesis.
