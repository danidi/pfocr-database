caption: Proposed model for interferon-induced senescence. The immediate effects of
  interferon treatment are a reversible growth arrest, mitochondrial changes, and
  p53 modifications (acetylation at K320 and dephosphorylation at serine 392). These
  changes do not commit the cells to an irreversible withdrawal from the cycling pool.
  However, chronic stimulation results in an increase in ROS production and activation
  of the DNA damage signaling pathway. The ATM kinase is a central regulator of the
  DNA damage response induced by interferon and it activates p53 by promoting its
  phosphorylation at serine 15 and inducing its transactivation potential. Activation
  of p53 is then critical to trigger a senescent cell cycle arrest in normal fibroblasts.
