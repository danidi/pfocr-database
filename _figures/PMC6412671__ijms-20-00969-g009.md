caption: Schematic model illustrating the response of Mg-deficient maize plants to
  Si supply. Application of Si to the Mg-deficient maize plants enabled the plants
  to cope better with Mg deficiency by regulating primary metabolites and inducing
  phytohormonal changes. Si induced multiple responses under Mg deficiency, whereof
  the first response was enhanced accumulation of sugars in the shoots as an osmoticum
  that was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in hexose-P levels, organic acids,
  stress amino acids as well as polyamines (Putrescine), which sufficiently provided
  the carbon flow to glycolytic pathway. The second response was related to the phytohormonal
  regulation, due to which specific changes were observed in the level of active cytokinins
  IP and IPR as well as JA and its derivative JA-ILE. The increased concentration
  of cytokinin maintained the plant growth under Mg-deficient condition as indicated
  by higher shoot fresh weights and augmented chlorophyll level, whereas the increased
  level of jasmonates switched on the plant defense system (against probable pathogen
  attack) in response to enhanced sugar accumulation which was correlated with higher
  expression of DELLAs that might have further induced the JA related genes. Altogether,
  these responses contributed to Mg stress tolerance in the maize plants (Red arrows
  = increase/upregulation).
