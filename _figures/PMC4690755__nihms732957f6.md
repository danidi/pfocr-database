caption: 'ApoA-I is secreted by hepatocytes variably lipidated with phospholipid and
  unesterified cholesterol, and interacts with ABCA1 to take up more unesterified
  cholesterol and form nascent HDL in a range of sizes. Exposure to LCAT in the hepatic
  lymphatics and sinusoids esterifies the cholesterol to form an HDL core of cholesterol
  ester while the size of most of the HDL does not enlarge enough to become a larger
  subfraction. HDL in these discrete sizes enters the systemic circulation, and then
  escapes to the interstitial space or lymphatic system. In these extravascular-extrahepatic
  spaces, very small, medium, large and very large HDL take up and esterify free cholesterol
  from cells. Simultaneously or right after HDL goes back to the systemic circulation,
  CETP catalyzes the exchange of recently formed cholesterol esters for triglycerides
  present in apoB lipoproteins. Circulating HDL may come into contact with SRB1 on
  hepatocytes, which selectively takes up cholesterol ester from HDL. HDL particles
  do not experience major changes in size because the influx of cholesterol from cells
  is balanced by the efflux of cholesterol esters from each HDL particle by the CETP
  and SRB1 pathways. Hepatic lipase, acting on the triglyceride from the CETP reaction,
  also may maintain stability of size. This cycle of HDL circulation between plasma
  and the extravascular space can be repeated many times over several days. In the
  vascular or extravascular space, small-discoidal HDL can, in a minor pathway, take
  up and esterify cholesterol from cells, becoming large or very large HDL. In a process
  facilitated by plasma PLTP, HL, CETP and LCAT, medium size HDL particles experience
  fusion to generate new small-discoidal HDL and perhaps new medium or large HDL.
  All HDL size subspecies can be cleared from circulation via holoparticle uptake.
  Reverse cholesterol transport can be accomplished by coupling cholesterol uptake
  from cells with CETP-mediated cholesterol ester transfer to apoB lipoproteins and
  SRB1-mediated selective CE uptake by the liver, without transforming the size of
  the individual HDL.ABCA1: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, FC: Free cholesterol,
