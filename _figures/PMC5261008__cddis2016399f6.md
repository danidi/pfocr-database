caption: 'The multi-targeted STAT3 and TLR9 for aGvHD therapy. The pathogenesis of
  GvHD is complicated and can be conceptualized in three phages: host APCs activation
  by conditioning regimen; donor T cells recognize alloantigen and activation; finally
  allo-reactive donor T cells migrate and target tissues inducing organs injury. In
  these stages, donor T cells activation plays a center role in GvHD progression,
  in which the Stat3 played important role. In this study, application of nifuroxazide
  blocked Stat3 activation, and inhibited T cells activation and proliferation. In
  addition, alloactivate donor T cells by host APCs, TLR9 appears to be a special
  important cofactor in the development of GvHD. SAT05f inhibited TLR9 pathway in
  the initial stage of aGVHD progressing, preventing inflammatory cytokines secretion
  and then inhibiting the activation of T cells. Combined suppressing of these two
  signaling pathways synergetically intervened in multiple key signals in effect T-cell
  activation, and thus exhibited more effectively in deterring the occurrence of aGVHD'
