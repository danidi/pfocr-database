caption: Potential roles and modulations of toll-interacting protein (Tollip) in acute
  and chronic inflammation. Under strong and acute inflammatory conditions, cell membrane-localized
  Tollip serves as a negative inhibitor for nuclear factor κ of activated B cells
  (NFκB) signaling pathway, facilitates the resolution of inflammation, and clearance
  of cellular debris as well as excessive lipids. However, under low-grade inflammatory
  conditions, Tollip undergoes translocation from cellular membrane to mitochondria.
  Dislocated Tollip loses its homeostatic function, fails to facilitate lysosome fusion.
  Instead, mitochondrial Tollip may facilitate non-resolving low-grade inflammation.
