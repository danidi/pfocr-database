caption: The neuroactive tryptophan pathway and metabolites.In mammals, as only about
  5% of tryptophan is catabolized via the serotonin pathway, the vast majority of
  tryptophan is metabolized in the kynurenine pathway, which is the precursor pathway
  for the synthesis of the neuroinhibitory molecule, kynurenic acid, and neurotoxic
  molecule, quinolinic acid. Is the rate of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism
  involved in central fatigue? If the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway is enhanced during
  central fatigue, does it lead to a reduction in cognitive functions and severe fatigue?
