caption: Hypothetical model of the regulation of PTOX activity by the proton gradient
  in higher plants. Under non-saturating light conditions linear electron transport
  between PSII and PSI takes place and a moderate proton gradient is established across
  the thylakoid membrane. PTOX cannot operate since it has no access to its substrate
  plastoquinol. At saturating light intensities linear electron transport is slowed
  down, the proton gradient and the plastoquinol concentration increases. The stroma
  gets more alkaline allowing PTOX to associate to the membrane and to catalyze the
  oxidation of plastoquinol. Production of  in a side reaction may trigger a ROS signaling
  pathway and thereby a stress acclimation response.
