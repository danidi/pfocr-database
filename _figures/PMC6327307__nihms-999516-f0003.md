caption: a | The DNA methylation cycle of cytosine nucleotide bases is depicted. DNA
  (cyto-sine-5)-methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and DNMT3B add methylation (m) modifications
  to unmodified cytosines in a de novo manner, whereas DNMT1 acts to maintain established
  patterns during DNA replication. Passive demethylation results from a lack of maintenance
  methylation and is replication dependent, whereas active demethylation is directed
  by Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins and can be either replication dependent
  or independent. TET proteins mediate the serial oxidation of methylated cytosines
  (red bases), resulting in multiple intermediary bases, including 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
  (green bases). Eventually, modified bases are returned to an unmodified state via
  the base excision repair (BER) pathway. b | Nucleosomes consist of two copies each
  of the histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 encircled by DNA. The amino-terminal
  tails of histone proteins protrude from the nucleosome structure and can be post-translationally
  modified. The amino acid sequence of the histone H3 N-terminal tail is shown along
  with the position of select lysines (K) that are subject to methylation (me) and/or
  acetylation (ac); however, this is not an exhaustive list of all H3 post-translational
  modifications. c | Chromatin can be broadly categorized as either euchromatin or
  heterochromatin on the basis of its accessibility level. Euchromatin is characterized
  by an open chromatin conformation that is less compact and more accessible by regulatory
  proteins (yellow oval). Heterochromatin is categorized as either facultative or
  constitutive. Both are more compact and inaccessible relative to euchromatin; however,
  constitutive heterochromatin is generally more compacted and is associated with
  gene-poor repetitive regions that largely remain in a closed state. Facultative
  heterochromatin, by contrast, is associated with regions that often transition to
  an open conformation as transcriptional requirements change. Each chromatin state
  has specific histone post-translational modifications that are associated with it,
  as depicted.
