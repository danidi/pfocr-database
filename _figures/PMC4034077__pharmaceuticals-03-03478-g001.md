caption: The Classical Jak/STAT Signaling Pathway. Ligand binding causes cytokine
  receptors to dimerize which results in Jak phosphorylation, recruitment of the Signal
  Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT) signaling proteins, which are then
  tyrosine phosphorylated by the Jaks. The phosphorylated STATs dimerize, and translocate
  into the nucleus where they bind to cis-inducible promoter elements to stimulate
  gene transcription.
