caption: '(A) Type I and II cytokine receptors comprise subunits that physically associate
  with Janus kinases (JAKs). Type I/II cytokine receptors do not have any enzymatic
  activity but instead depend upon JAKs to transduce intracellular signals. JAK proteins
  share 4 components: the kinase domain, the pseudokinase domain, the FERM (Four-point-one
  protein, Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) domain, and the SH2-like domain. The canonical
  JAK/STAT pathway is initiated by extracellular association of cytokines with their
  cognate receptors (1). This activates the receptor, resulting in apposition of receptor-associated
  JAKs (2). JAKs are tyrosine kinases, so upon activation they transfer phosphate
  from ATP to tyrosine residues on other proteins, including cytokine receptors and
  JAKs themselves. This is an important event, as tyrosine phosphorylation of kinases,
  including JAKs, triggers their enzymatic activity. Tyrosine phosphorylation of receptors
  (3) creates docking sites for signaling molecules including signal transducers and
  activators of transcription (STATs), which also undergo JAK-mediated phosphorylation
  of their tyrosine residues (4), leading to STAT dimerization, nuclear translocation
  (5), DNA binding and target gene induction (6). (B). Monoclonal antibodies can block
  Type I/II cytokines and their receptors. In contrast, jakinibs block cytokine signaling
  by inhibiting kinase activity. This prevents JAKs from phosphorylating STATs and
  other substrates, so that intracellular signals cannot be transduced. Because JAKs
  are critical for multiple different cytokines, jakinibs block the action of a range
  of cytokines, unlike biologics. First generation jakinibs block multiple JAKs whereas
  second generation jakinibs may have more selectivity for JAKs and so may inhibit
  a narrow range of cytokines. Cytokine receptors, JAK and STATs are drawn based on
  structural information ,.'
