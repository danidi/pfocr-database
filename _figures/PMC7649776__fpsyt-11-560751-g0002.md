caption: Pipeline used to study the multimorbidities between psychiatric and cognitive
  phenotypes. SNPs associated with ADHD, anxiety, BD, SCZ, UD, and cognitive functioning
  were obtained from the GWAS Catalog and analyzed using CoDeS3D () to identify the
  genes associated with significant spatial eQTLs. Phenotype-specific lists of eQTLs
  are presented in . Pathway analysis was used to identify pathways containing co-occurring
  eGenes for the different phenotypes (). Drug-eGene interaction analysis was performed
  to identify druggable genes ().
