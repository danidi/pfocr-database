caption: Innate immune signaling pathways and antagonism by PEDV and PDCoV proteins.
  Following the cellular receptor-mediated entry into the target cells, the genomic
  RNAs of both PEDV and PDCoV are released into the cytosol by viral-host membrane
  fusion. During the cytokine induction phase, the presence of the virus-derived RNA
  genome as well as other replicative RNA intermediates are sensed by both the endosomal
  TLRs (TLR3, 7/8) and cytosolic RLRs (RIG-I and MDA5). The recognition of the virus-derived
  RNAs by these receptors triggers a cascade of signaling molecule activation leading
  to a nuclear translocation of the key transcription factors including NF-κB, IRF1,
  IRF3, and IRF7. Inside the nucleus, the binding of these transcription factors to
  their respective PRD regions drives the production of type I and type III IFNs,
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines which are then secreted into the extracellular space.
  Subsequently, in the signaling phase, the engagement of both type I and III IFNs
  to their cognate receptors in both autocrine and paracrine manner induces the activation
  of JAK/STAT pathway leading to nuclear translocation of the ISGF3 complex as well
  as the subsequent production of the interferon stimulating genes (ISGs) (A). These
  ISGs confer the cells with an anti-viral state. In order to ensure the establishment
  of a successful infection, both PEDV and PDCoV either produce viral proteins (shown
  in red for those of PEDV and in yellow of PDCoV) to directly antagonize various
  critical steps of both IFN induction and signaling or affect indirectly the host
  cell anti-viral signaling cascades (B).
