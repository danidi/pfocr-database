caption: Proposed model of the pro-apoptotic pathway GAPDH/Siah1 in high glucose-induced
  human retinal pericyte apoptosis. Cell stress, such as high glucose, causes an increase
  in nitric-oxide synthesis (NOS) activity. This increase in NOS activity results
  in elevated cytosolic nitric oxide (NO), which causes S-nitrosylation of GAPDH.
  Nitrosylated GAPDH associates with Siah1, stabilizing the complex and facilitating
  its translocation to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, Siah1 degrades target proteins
  and/or GAPDH undertakes other non-glycolytic functions resulting in cell instability
  and ultimately cell death. This model is an adaptation from Hara et al. ().
