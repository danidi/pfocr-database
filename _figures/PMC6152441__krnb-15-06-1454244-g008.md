caption: Representation of the stress response induced by misreading tRNAs. The mutant
  misreading tRNAs expressed in NIH3T3 cells exposed to microenvironment stimuli in
  vivo induce ER stress and activation of the Akt pathway. These events lead to UPR
  activation, increasing the cells capacity to thrive under stress. In tRNASer(Ala)
  expressing cells where eIF2α-P is downregulated by upregulation of PP1α catalytic
  subunit there is derepression of protein synthesis which accelerates tumor growth.
  On the other hand, tRNASer(Leu) show downregulation of ERK2, which has been correlated
  with decreased cellular proliferation, leading to slow tumor growth. Adapted from
