caption: 'Metabolic pathway of the novel vitamin A5/X / provitamin A5/X pathway. Simplified
  metabolic pathway including structural formula starting from nutritionally derived
  carotenoids and retinoids and key metabolites of the vitamin A1 cluster pathway
  on the left side and colored in blue background: all-trans-retinyl ester (ATROL-ES),
  all-trans-retinol (ATROL), all-trans-β,β-carotene (ATBC), 9-cis-β,β-carotene (9CBC)
  to all-trans-retinal (ATRAL) and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) as the bioactive
  metabolites of the vitamin A1 cluster pathway. On the right side, and colored in
  reddish background, the novel claimed vitamin A5/X cluster pathway with 9CBC as
  a partial vitamin A1 / A5/X derivative representing the indirect nutritional vitamin
  A5/X precursor, with 9-cis-13,14-dihydroretinyl esters (9CDHROL-ES) as well as the
  direct nutritional precursor vitamin A5/X alcohol 9-cis-13,14-dihydroretinol (9CDHROL)
  and the provitamin A5/X carotenoid 9-cis-13,14-dihydro-β,β-carotene (9CDHBC), which
  can be transformed to the lipid hormone - vitamin A5/X acid 9-cis-13,14-dihydroretinoic
  acid (9CDHRA) as the resulting bioactive and endogenous RXR-ligand. In addition,
  direct 9CDHRA-precursors 9-cis-13,14-dihydroretinoyl ester (9CDHRA-ES) were still
  not endogenously identified.'
