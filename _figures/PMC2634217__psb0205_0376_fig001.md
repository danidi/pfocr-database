caption: Illustration of the dual roles of the ABP1 and TIR1 auxin receptors in control
  of the cell cycle. ABP1 has been demonstrated to mediate the permissive auxin signal
  for entry into the cell cycle and to modulate the G2/M transition. Plants defective
  in ABP1 also show aberrant cell expansion., A number of genes thought to be controlled
  by the TIR1 mediated protein degradation pathway have been implicated in various
  auxin responses.
