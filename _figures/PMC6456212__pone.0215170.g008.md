caption: 'Schematic representation of the therapeutic protective antioxidative effects
  of carnosinol against hydrogen peroxide-mediated alterations at myotube level showing
  that carnosinol may act through the mitochondrial PGC-1α/SIRT3 signaling pathway
  (black arrows), but if SIRT3 is inhibited carnosinol’s effects are not blocked (blue
  arrows). H2O2: hydrogen peroxide; CAT: catalase; COX2: cyclooxygenase2; PGC-1α:
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha; SIRT3: sirtuin3;
  SOD2: superoxide dysmutase2.'
