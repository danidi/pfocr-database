caption: GA-Signaling Pathway That Regulates Flowering in Arabidopsis.Activation of
  a hypothetical transmembrane receptor by GA inhibits repressors of GA signaling.
  These repressors are encoded by the RGA, GAI, and RGL genes. The SPY gene also represses
  GA signaling and genetically acts upstream of RGA and GAI. It may act to promote
  the activity of GAI/RGA/RGL by GlcNAc modification, in which case GA signaling may
  inhibit GAI/RGA/RGAL by repressing SPY function. PHOR1 has not been described in
  Arabidopsis, but has been shown to be involved in GA signaling in potato. Its possible
  involvement in ubiquitination and protein degradation leads to the tentative proposal
  that it is involved in the demonstrated degradation of the repressing protein RGA
  in response to GA. The floral meristem identity gene LFY is upregulated at the transcriptional
  level by GA. The flowering-time gene SOC1 is also upregulated by GA, whereas FPF1
  and GA-MYB were proposed to mediate between GAs and the regulation of flowering
  time. These three genes may therefore act downstream of GAI/RGA/RGL but upstream
  of LFY. The data underlying this scheme are described in detail in the text.
