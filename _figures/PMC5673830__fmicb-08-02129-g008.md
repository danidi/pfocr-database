caption: Schematic model of CSFV manipulate UPR and its potential outcome. CSFV activated
  the IRE1pathway at the initial stage of infection likely due to a reduction in cytoplasm
  Ca2+, the activation of IRE1 pathway benefit viral replication through GRP78 up-regulation.
  Dotted lines with arrows indicate tentative relationships that warrant confirmation.
