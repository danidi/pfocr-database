caption: Some examples of lncRNA mechanisms that unfold in the cytoplasmic compartment.
  Dashed lines specify pathways that are reduced upon lncRNA expression, whereas solid
  lines indicate outcomes of lncRNA expression. The examples are ordered in a counterclockwise
  manner. (A) HOTAIRM1 acts as a decoy for miR-20a, miR-106b, and miR-125b in NB-4
  cells, titrating them away from mRNAs that encode regulators of autophagy, and thereby
  enhancing the degradation of PML-RARA oncoprotein through this pathway. HOTAIRM1
  also modulates the expression of HOXA genes and of cell surface lineage markers
  CD11c and CD49d through an undetermined mechanism. (B) In contrast to wild-type
  CEBPα, truncated CEBPα-p30 transactivates the UCA1 promoter in AML cells with CEBPα
  mutations. The UCA1 transcript functions as a sponge on miR-125a and miR-126 and
  additionally competes with the p27kip1 mRNA for stabilizing interactions with hnRNP
  I. (C) PU.1-AS lncRNAs are polysome associated and interfere with PU.1 protein expression
  by competitively binding the translation initiating factor eIF4A.
