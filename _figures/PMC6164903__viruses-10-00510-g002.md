caption: Induction of innate immune response by viral infection. Induction of IFN
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines is mainly initiated by the recognition of several
  viral components in mammalian cells. RIG-like receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5 (cytoplasmic
  sensors) recognize viral-specific double strand RNA, and then the IPS-1-mediated
  signaling pathway is activated. On the other hand, Toll-like receptors such as TLR9,
  TLR7 and TLR3 (endosomal sensors) recognize viral DNA, RNA and replicative intermediate
  double strand RNA, and then a TRIF- or Myd88-mediated signaling pathway is activated.
  Finally, these pathways trigger the activation of transcription factors such as
  NF-κB and IRF3 or IRF7, followed by the production of inflammatory cytokines and
  Type I IFNs, respectively.
