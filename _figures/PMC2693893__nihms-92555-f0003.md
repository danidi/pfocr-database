caption: Autoradiographic studies using [1- or 6-14C]glucose demonstrate that most
  of the label corresponding to the additional glucose consumed in focally-stimulated
  tissue is not retained in activated structures (see  and text). Diffusible and volatile
  compounds are most likely to be released after generation of pyruvate or lactate
  by the glycolytic pathway, followed by oxidation in the cell where formed or after
  its putative shuttling among neurons or astrocytes. If glucose or lactate were rapidly
  and locally oxidized in a small metabolic compartment that does not quickly equilibrate
  with the large amino acid pools that would facilitate dilution and trapping of label,
  then appearance of 14CO2 in the interstitial fluid would be expected to show a temporal
  profile similar to that of [14C]lactate when extracellular fluid is sampled by microdialysis
  (see text).
