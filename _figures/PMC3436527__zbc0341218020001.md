caption: The Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway leads to the formation of UDP-GlcNAc,
  which is the donor substrate used by OGT to form the O-GlcNAc modification, which
  is in turn processed within the conserved active site pocket found in human OGA
  and homologs. A, O-GlcNAc consists of serine and threonine residues modified with
  a single β-O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue. Installation of O-GlcNAc
  is catalyzed by OGT, which uses UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate. Removal of O-GlcNAc from
  modified proteins is catalyzed by OGA. UDP-GlcNAc is made from the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (box). GlcNAc can be salvaged by phosphorylation to generate the HBSP intermediate
  GlcNAc-6-P. UDP-GlcNAc is also used for the biosynthesis of CMP-Neu5Ac and UDP-GalNAc.
  B and C, a conserved active site pocket is present around the 2-acetamido substituent
  in all GH84 family members. B, structure of BtGH84 with NAG-thiazoline bound in
  its active site (Protein Data Bank code 2CHN). Highlighted are residues that line
  the active site including the pocket formed beneath the 2′-methyl group of NAG-thiazoline.
  C, sequence alignment of several GH84 family members. Residues in boldface are those
  that line the active site pocket. Note that Asp-242, Phe-240, Thr-310, and Val-314
  are not noted in B because they are either out of plane (into the page) or obscured.
