caption: Proposed Model for P-Regulated TORC1 Signaling in Chlamydomonas.P availability
  is sensed by TORC1 via subunit LST8. In the presence of P, TORC1 is active and promotes
  translation via the S6K/RPS6 pathway while negatively regulating autophagy and TAG
  synthesis. P deprivation activates PSR1, which is required to maintain P homeostasis
  through the transcriptional activation of genes encoding Pi transporters and phosphatases.
  Decreased intracellular P levels negatively affect LST8 protein stability by an
  unidentified mechanism (dashed arrow), resulting in downregulation of TORC1 activity.
