caption: Pou4f1 (Brn3a) was strongly up-regulated in the Lmx1a−/− expression array,
  in line with a suggested role of Lmx1a in repressing an alternative, red nucleus,
  fate during development (dashed line). Lmx1a targets C130021l20Rik and Calb2 require
  Lmx1a directly or indirectly for correct expression in subsets of the mdDA system.
  The Nurr1 transcriptional pathway induces differentiating mdDA neurons, and loss
  of Lmx1a resulted in affected Nurr1 expression, but also in affected expression
  of Nurr1 transcriptional targets, mainly in rostral-lateral mdDA neurons. Rspo2
  is involved in the Wnt1/b-catenin signaling pathways, which is implicated in proliferation
  and cell-cycle exit. Loss of Lmx1a, resulted in decreased Rspo2 expression and loss
  of mdDA neuronal markers as Th, Ahd2 and Pitx3. Interestingly, loss of Rspo2 partially
  phenocopied the defects observed in the Lmx1a-dr/dr mdDA system.
