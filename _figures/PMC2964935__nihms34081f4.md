caption: The PAR signaling pathway; phosphorylation and binding of PAR-5 provides
  a mechanism for mutual exclusion from different PAR domains. On the left, PAR-1
  that has diffused onto the apical domain is phosphorylated by aPKC, which inhibits
  the PAR-1 kinase activity and induces binding of PAR-5, which in turn triggers release
  into the cytoplasm. A similar mechanism probably controls the cortical attachment
  of LGL, Numb, and perhaps XGAP. In a reciprocal fashion, PAR-3 that diffuses into
  the basolateral domain is phosphorylated by PAR-1, which induces binding of PAR-5
  and release into the cytoplasm.
