caption: Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) maintains microglial
  metabolism through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD). TREM2 pairs with DAP12 through charge interactions in the transmembrane
  domain. Upon TREM2 ligand binding, DAP12 gets phosphorylated and recruits spleen
  tyrosine kinase (SYK), which initiates a cascade of signaling events, including
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, which is composed of p85 and p110.
  The recruitment of p85 requires DAP10. One of the PI3K downstream targets AKT then
  activates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, which inhibits
  autophagy. These signaling events maintain microglia at high energy states so that
  in AD models, microglia are able to cluster around amyloid plaques.
