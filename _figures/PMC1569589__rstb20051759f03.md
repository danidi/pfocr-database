caption: Proposed model to illustrate the potential role of neuronal RyR as coincidence
  detectors of a simultaneous increase in [Ca2+] and ROS/RNS. As discussed in the
  text, stimulation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors (NMDAR) in hippocampal neurons
  elicits Ca2+ entry and promotes ROS generation; the resulting localized [Ca2+] increase
  stimulates the Ca2+-dependent neuronal NO synthase that is attached to the postsynaptic
  membrane, resulting in the generation of NO and possibly of other NO-derived RNS.
  The model proposes that the concomitant local increases in Ca2+ and ROS/RNS activate
  jointly RyR-mediated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), generating
  larger Ca2+ signals. The resulting RyR-mediated Ca2+ signals would stimulate Ca2+-dependent
  signalling cascades, such as the Ras MAP kinase pathway, producing increased ERK1/2
  phosphorylation. Translocation of phospho-ERK1/2 (P-ERK1/2) to the nucleus (N) would
  stimulate the sustained phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB, which
  is a requisite for transcription of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. According
  to this model, cross talk between Ca2+ and redox signals through joint stimulation
  of RyR-mediated Ca2+ release may play a key role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity.
  Furthermore, conditions that promote oxidative/nitrosative stress may result in
  excessive stimulation of RyR-mediated Ca2+ release that if unchecked can provoke
  pathological responses and neuronal death.
