caption: Phospholipid remodeling in proliferating cells. The scheme shows the fluxes
  of fatty acids in glycerolipid synthesis and the assumed involvement of storage
  lipids in the remodeling of membranes. FA are either incorporated into phospholipids
  for membrane biogenesis or into triacylglycerol for storage. Both membrane and storage
  lipids are subject to turnover during growth, resulting in an acyl-CoA pool that
  is fed by de novo synthesis, lipolysis of TAG, and phospholipase B action on phospholipids.
  In yeast, FA from phospholipids can also be directly incorporated into storage lipids
  by PC:diacylglycerol transferase activity and diacylglyerol derived from the first
  step of TAG lipolysis may directly serve as a substrate for synthesis of PE and
  PC in the Kennedy pathway or for the DAG kinase to generate phosphatidic acid (see
  main text for details).
