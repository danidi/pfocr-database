caption: PKD2 and PKD3 support EMT and cell migration. PKD2 and PKD3 form a complex
  in which basally-active PKD3 stimulates PAK4. Along with activated SSH1L, this leads
  to the dynamic reorganization of F-actin filaments necessary for cell migration.
  Both, PKD2 and PKD3 increase the expression and activation of uPA and MMPs augmenting
  ECM remodeling and enhancing cell migration. PKD3-dependent phosphorylation of GIT1
  affects paxillin trafficking and drives cell migration. Use of the pan-PKD inhibitor
  CRT0066101 in PKD2/PKD3 positive cells with mesenchymal phenotype also demonstrated
  that these oncogenic versions of PKD may be potential inducers of EMT, but the prospective
  regulatory molecules in this pathway have not been identified.
