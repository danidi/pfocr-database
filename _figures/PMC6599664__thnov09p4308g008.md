caption: Schematic depicting the mechanisms of RCAN1.4 to prevent liver fibrosis.
  RCAN1.4 was selectively downregulated in liver fibrosis mediated by DNMT1 and DNMT3b.
  Forced RCAN1.4 expression could alleviate liver injury, inhibit HSC activation,
  proliferation and promote activated HSC apoptosis through CaN/NFAT3 signaling pathway
  in vivo and in vitro. However, silencing of RCAN1.4 exacerbates liver fibrosis in
  vitro. In briefly, RCAN1.4 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment
  of liver fibrosis.
