caption: '(A) Overview of the important steps in Fanconi anemia (FA) signaling pathway.
  Damage signaling begins with the recruitment of FANCM, FAAP24, and MHF to a stalled
  replication fork, binding to the unwound DNA. Remodeling of the fork by FANCM leads
  to recruitment of RPA, the ssDNA-binding protein. RPA localization to the DNA is
  required for ATR activation, which phosphorylates several targets, including the
  components of the MRN complex, FANCD2, and FANCI. The MRN complex associates with
  CtIP, which assists in DNA end resection during HR. The FA core complex assembles
  and includes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM, FAAP20,
  FAAP24, and MHF, using FANCM, FAAP24, and MHF to bind DNA. Assembly of the core
  complex stimulates FANCL to monoubiquitinate FANCD2 and FANCI. Structure-specific
  endonucleases: MUS81-EME1 and ERCC1-XPF/FANCQ are recruited to the damage site via
  interaction with FANCP/SLX4. The core complex and FANCD2-FANCI are recruited to
  the chromatin where they facilitate resolution of the repair intermediate by TLS
  polymerases (REV1- Pol ζ-Pol η) and the homologous recombination machinery, including
  FANCJ/BPIP1/BACH1, FANCD1/BRCA2, RAD51, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C, and BRCA1. (B)
  Details of the protein–protein interactions important for recruitment of FA proteins
  to sites of DNA damage. The core complex is recruited to chromatin via interaction
  of FAAP20 with RNF8 and the FANCC interaction with BRCA2/FANCD1. RNF8-UBC13 polyubiquitinates
  histone H2A, marking the site of ICL damage. FANCD2 and FANCI are recruited to chromatin
  via interaction between FANCD2 and FANCE of the core complex. FAAP20 also interacts
  with the TLS polymerase REV1. Dissolution of the complex is dependent on UAF1/USP1
  deubiquitinating FANCD2 and FANCI. (C) Events that occur independently of the FA
  core complex. Recruitment of FANCM, MHF, and FAAP24 to stalled forks does not require
  the core complex to be present or monoubiquitination of FANCD2 or FANCI. In addition,
  RPA loading and ATR activation do not require the core complex members. Finally,
  homologous recombination, in particular the formation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 foci, FANCJ
  recruitment to the chromatin, DSB end resection by MRN-CtIP, and RAD51 loading on
  the resected end, do not require the core complex.'
