caption: 'A proposed model of gga- miR-1306-5p regulation on activation of pro-inflammatory
  responses via targeting Tollip in chickens (Red arrow: up-regulation or down-regulation).
  Tollip is required to maintain immune homeostasis and control the MyD88-dependent
  TLR signaling pathway during inflammation. Following pathogen or LPS stimulation,
  Tollip firstly binded with IRAK-1, and this Tollip-IRAK-1 complex interacted with
  IRAK-4. The results generated from our study showed gga-miR-1306-5p were significantly
  increased following SE infection or LPS stimulation. The highly expressed gga-miR-1306-5p
  could significantly suppress the target Tollip, and subsequently facilitate the
  downstream pro-inflammatory mediators including NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β'
