caption: 'The urea cycle is influenced by Mn, which is an essential cofactor for three
  enzymes: Arginases (ARG), Agmatinases (AGM) and Glutamine Synthetase (GS). Arginase
  pathway related metabolites are altered in HD striatum; and Mn exposure ameliorates
  this phenotype. (A) Representation of the urea cycle in WT striatum with the presence
  of adequate Mn (Note: ARG is a homotrimer with 2 Mn ions per monomer, AGM is a hexamer
  composed of dimers, and GS is composed of 8–12 identical subunits, each with two
  Mn ions, though Mg can substitute for Mn in GS). (B) Representation of the striatal
  urea cycle in the HD model with reduced bioavailable Mn, resulting in increased
  metabolites (indicated in pink).'
