caption: Broken TCA cycle in M1 macrophages. Both pyruvate (through pyruvate dehydrogenase-dependent
  formation of acetyl CoA) and lactate from glycolysis pathway are suggested to fuel
  the TCA cycle. However, 13C metabolites labeling studies suggest that TCA cycle
  is disrupted at distinct points in M1 macrophages. A downregulation of isocitrate
  dehydrogenase likely contributes to increase in citrate levels. Citrate fuels fatty
  acid synthesis and acts as a precursor for the synthesis of antimicrobial itaconate.
  Citrate may also be converted back to acetyl CoA by ATP citrate lyase and alter
  histone acetylation to regulate the expression of M2-associated genes. Accumulation
  of succinate stabilizes HIF-1α, and succinate-responsive succinate receptor 1 (SCNR1)
  signals processing and release of IL-1β. Intermediates of TCA cycle (e.g. fumarate)
  play a role in epigenetic programming. in M1 macrophages, while α-ketoglutarate
  is more important as facilitator of epigenetic programs in M2 macrophages. In addition,
  aspartate-arginosuccinate shunt produces arginine and supports NO production.
