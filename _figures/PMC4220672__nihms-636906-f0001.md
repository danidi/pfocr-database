caption: 'The proposed physiological effect of amylin/leptin combination therapy is
  that amylin, a neuroendocrine pancreatic peptide that contributes to short-term
  energy regulation and leptin, a well established hormone that contributes to long-term
  energy regulation act synergistically in the CNS by decreasing food intake and increasing
  energy expenditure (A). In the arcuate nucleus, amylin increases the phosphorylation
  of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) of the leptin signaling
  pathway resulting in an increase or restoration of central leptin sensitivity [,]
  (B) and therefore synergistic effects on weight loss, compared with either amylin
  or leptin administered alone [] (C).LepR: Leptin receptor.'
