caption: A schematic illustration of targeting the DDX5–mTORC1 axis by resveratrol.
  DDX5 protein is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer and promotes
  cell survival and growth by activating mTORC1 signaling. Resveratrol directly binds
  to DDX5 protein and promotes degradation of DDX5 protein, leading to suppression
  of the mTORC1 pathway, cancer cell survival, and growth

  pathway in prostate cancer.
