caption: Model for Stbd1 participation in glycogen metabolism and Stbd1 structure.
  A, classic cytosolic pathway of glycogen synthesis from glucose (Glc) via glucose-6-phosphate
  (Glc-6-P), glucose-1-phosphate (Glc-1-P) and the glucosyl donor UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc)
  is mediated by glycogenin (GN), glycogen synthase (GS) and branching enzyme (BE).
  Degradation to yield Glc-1-P is catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase (Ph) and debranching
  enzyme (DBE). A second pathway for glycogen breakdown involves transfer to lysosomes
  where it is hydrolyzed to glucose by lysosomal α-glycosidase (GAA). From the results
  of this study, we propose that Stbd1 participates in the vesicular trafficking of
  glycogen, mediated also by its interaction with GABARABL1 (or maybe GABARAP). In
  a number of diseases and mouse models, abnormal glycogen deposits can be formed,
  some possibly with elements of membranes associated. B, a number of the enzymes
  involved in glycogen metabolism can be partially purified with glycogen. PhK, phosphorylase
  kinase; PP1, type 1 protein phosphatase; PTG and RGL, glycogen binding PP1 targeting
  subunits; PP1c, catalytic subunit of PP1; LF, laforin. Shown also is the proposed
  role for Stbd1, anchoring glycogen to an intracellular membrane and interacting
  with GABARAPL1 (G-L1).
