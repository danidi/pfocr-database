caption: 'Schematic of one-carbon metabolism and the transsulfuration pathway. Recent
  findings have identified roles for these pathways in cancer. Genetic mutations and
  functional evidence for the existence of a cause of cancer (driver) at this point
  in the pathway (red), currently available drugs (yellow), and biomarker development
  (green) are highlighted. The specifics are indicated in ,  and . Causality is defined
  as either the presence of a genetic lesion or functional evidence (e.g. overexpression
  of a pathway component) that enhanced activity at this point in the pathway promotes
  oncogenesis. The biological outputs of the pathway are in a bold-italic red font.
