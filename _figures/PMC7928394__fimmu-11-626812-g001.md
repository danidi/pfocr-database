caption: Iron metabolism in the crosstalk between cancer cells and macrophages or
  neutrophils. Proinflammatory cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists induce
  activation of Stat1, NF-κB and C/EBPβ in macrophages, resulting in upregulation
  of hepcidin and inhibition of ferroportin. In parallel, engagement of TLRs further
  inhibits ferroportin expression. Reduced ferroportin levels in macrophages limit
  iron transport from macrophages to cancer cells. IL-10 activates the Jak/Stat3 signaling
  pathway and upregulates expression of lipocalin-2 in macrophages. Lipocalin-2 released
  from macrophages can bind to its receptor in cancer cells and in macrophages to
  stimulate cancer cell growth and M2 polarization, respectively. Lipocalin-2 can
  also induce VEGFC expression, resulting in promotion of lymphangiogenesis and cancer
  metastasis. Moreover, macrophage-secreted ferritin directly stimulates cancer cell
  growth. TLR engagement induces activation of NF-κB and hepcidin expression in neutrophils.
  GM-CSF, produced by metastatic tumor cells, induces activation of the Jak/Stat5β
  signaling pathway and transferrin synthesis in neutrophils. Neutrophil-derived transferrin
  can promote growth of metastatic tumor cells. In addition, lipocalin-2 released
  by neutrophils induces activation of Src family kinases (SFK) in prostate cancer
  cells and enhances cancer cell migration and metastasis.
