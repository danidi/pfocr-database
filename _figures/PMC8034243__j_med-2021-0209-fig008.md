caption: The schematic diagram of the main findings of this research. In ox-LDL-induced
  HUVECs, circ_0003204 inhibited the viability and promoted the apoptosis, oxidative
  stress, and inflammatory response of cells via mediating the activity of NF-κB signaling
  pathway by regulating the miR-330-5p/TLR4 axis.

  human umbilical vein endothelial cells injury: Circulating RNAs could explain atherosclerosis
  disease progression.'
