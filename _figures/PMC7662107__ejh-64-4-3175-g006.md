caption: Schematic representation of the hypothetical mechanism proposed for the changes
  observed in SREBP-1 and PPAR-α******protein expression. mTOR has a central role
  in lipid metabolism; dysregulation of mTOR signaling has been observed in obesity,
  diabetes, cancer and fatty liver diseases. The modulatory mTOR role involves the
  modulation of SREBP-1 and PPAR-α expression. mGluR5 has been found to activate the
  mTOR pathway in hippocampal slices, suggesting that the same pathway might be replicated
  also in hepatocytes.
