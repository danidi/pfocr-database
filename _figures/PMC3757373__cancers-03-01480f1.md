caption: Methionine metabolism in liver. The first step in methionine metabolism is
  catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), generating S-adenosylmethionine
  (AdoMet), which is converted to AdoHcy during transmethylation reactions. AdoHcy
  hydrolase catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of AdoHcy to yield homocysteine and
  adenosine. In the liver, homocysteine can undergo three metabolic pathways (labeled
  as 1, 2 and 3). First is the transsulfuration pathway, which converts homocysteine
  to cysteine through a two-step process consisting of two vitamin B6 dependent enzymes,
  cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and γ-cystathionase. Cysteine is further utilized
  for biosynthesis of GSH. The other two pathways that metabolize homocysteine re-synthesize
  methionine from homocysteine. One is catalyzed by methionine synthase (MS) and the
  other is catalyzed by betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT). Remethylation
  of homocysteine via MS requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), which is derived
  from 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) in a reaction catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR). 5-MTHF is then converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) as it donates
  its methyl group and THF is converted to 5,10-MTHF to complete the folate cycle.
  AdoMet is also utilized in the synthesis of polyamines, thereby generating methylthioadenosine
  (MTA) [].
