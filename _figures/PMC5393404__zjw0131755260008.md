caption: REACTOME diagrams of the type 1 interferon signaling pathway with highlighted
  and regulated proteins from the in vivo and in vitro experiments. A, REACTOME diagram
  of the type 1 interferon signaling pathway highlighted (in purple), with differentially
  regulated proteins in CD4+ T cells from patients on and off treatment. B, REACTOME
  diagram of the type 1 interferon signaling pathway with highlighted (in purple)
  and differentially regulated proteins in CD4+ T cells infected in vitro at the 24-h
  time point.
