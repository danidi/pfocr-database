caption: Inflammatory bowel disease is a result of intestinal inflammation, in which
  profound changes in metabolic supply and demand lead to an imbalance in oxygen supply.
  This imbalance causes severe hypoxia of the inflamed mucosa. Mucosal hypoxia during
  intestinal inflammation can be visualized using nitroimidazole compounds that stain
  hypoxic tissues,. Infiltrating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) contribute to
  tissue hypoxia of the inflamed intestinal mucosa by localized oxygen depletion and
  concomitant stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), thereby contributing
  to the resolution of inflammation. Inflammatory hypoxia causes the activation of
  hypoxia-elicited gene programmes. Coordinated gene programmes result in the increased
  production and signalling of extracellular adenosine. This gene programme is under
  the control of SP1-dependent induction of CD39, HIF-dependent induction of CD73
  and the adenosine A2A and A2B receptors. These transcriptional changes lead to an
  increased turnover rate of the extracellular nucleotides ATP and ADP to AMP (via
  CD39) and subsequently via CD73 to adenosine. This pathway provides robust protection
  during intestinal inflammation. Importantly, orally available inhibitors of prolyl
  hydroxylases (PHDs) are available for the treatment of patients and are effective
  in increasing erythropoietin responses. Such compounds can promote intestinal protection
  from inflammation via enhancing extracellular adenosine production and signalling
  through adenosine receptors.
