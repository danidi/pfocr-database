caption: Schema of neoadjuvant clinical trial with PI3K pathway inhibitor. Patients
  with breast cancers requiring neoadjuvant therapy prior to breast conserving surgery
  are randomized to the “standard” therapy ± the PI3K pathway inhbitor. Formalin-fixed
  and flash-frozen core biopsies are obtained after 2 weeks of therapy in order to
  document effects on tumor cell proliferation and/or apoptosis as well as pathway
  inactivation (i.e., downregulation of P-Akt, P-S6, P-PRAS40, etc., by IHC). Incorporation
  of noninvasive FDG-PET at 2 weeks could identify early metabolic changes (or lack
  thereof). Clinical response can be evaluated after approximately 4 months of therapy
  by measuring the tumor with calipers, ultrasound, and/or mammography. Absence of
  tumor in the surgical specimen would be scored as a path CR. Rate of breast conserving
  surgery is another endpoint that can be compared between both arms. No difference
  in terms of clinical and/or pathological response in favor of the “standard” therapy
  plus PI3K inhibitor arm would indicate the clinical development of the combination
  is not a priority
