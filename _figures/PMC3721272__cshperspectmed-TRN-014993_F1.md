caption: Pathways of alloantigen presentation. The three pathways of alloantigen presentation
  (direct, indirect, and semidirect) are shown. The frequency (%) of T cells that
  react to a specific pathway is indicated where known. APC, antigen-presenting cell;
  MHC, major histocompatibility complex molecule; TCR, T-cell receptor for antigen.
