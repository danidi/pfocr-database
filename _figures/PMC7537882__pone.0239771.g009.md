caption: DEGs (represented with a ‘T’), or DAPs (represented with a ‘P’) for males
  are depicted with the male sex symbol while those for females are depicted with
  the female sex symbol. Metabolites are highlighted in the left half if they were
  measured/differentially abundant in males, and are highlighted in the right half
  if they were measured/differentially abundant in females. Up-regulated DEGs/DAPs/DAMs
  are in red, down-regulated DEGs/DAPs/DAMs are in blue, measured but non-DAMs are
  highlighted in gray, and if some subunits or genes/proteins for the same enzyme
  are up-regulated and down-regulated then they are depicted in purple.
