caption: The metabolic pathway by which the different phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol
  are interconverted is represented. The kinase and phosphatase reactions are indicated
  by green and black arrows, respectively. The Drosophila gene encoding each of the
  enzymes responsible for these reactions are also indicated. Dotted lines indicate
  reactions that are yet to be established. The number of binding proteins (BPs) capable
  of binding each of the phosphoinositides are indicated in purple boxes.
