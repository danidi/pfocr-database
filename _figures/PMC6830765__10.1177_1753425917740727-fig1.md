caption: 'Schematic diagram of the NF-κβ pathway and the inhibitory effect of various
  alkyl nitrate N-Aryl Piperamide on NF-κβ translocation and COX-2 function. Membrane
  receptors including TLRs, tumor TNFR, IL-1R and RAGE recognize stimuli like PAMPs,
  DAMPs and cytokines which activate proteins such as TNF associated factors (TRAF)
  and myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88). TRAF and MyD88
  activate protein kinases such as MAPK such as ERK1/2, NIK, TAK1, and IRAK. These
  kinases cause phosphorylation of IkB-α via activating IkB kinases (IKKα, IKKβ and
  IKKγ). This process causes the breakage the IkB- NF-κβ complex and nuclear translocation
  of NF-κβ to binds to specific DNA. Neuclear translocationmotivate the expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, Cyclooxygenase-2
  and iNOS. Alkyl nitrate N-aryle piperamides (NAPA-ONO2) release and increase the
  amount of NO in site of inflammation. High amount of NO results in accetylation
  protection of Lys221 & Lys218 of ReIA, Stabilization of NF-KB via decreasing phosphorylation
  of IkB by S-nitrosylation of Cys179 of IKKB and Interfere transient degradation
  of IKB-α , in turn, inhibiting the IkB- NF-κβ complex breakage, ceasing the NF-κβ
  translocation and reducing or completely stopping the pro-inflammatory and inflammatory
  cytokines expression. Additionaly NAPA itself is capable to interact with COX-2
  enzyme and inhibit it directly. Figure has been modified from Fihuera-Losada et
  al., 2014 (doi: 10.3389/fnmol.2015.00024).'
