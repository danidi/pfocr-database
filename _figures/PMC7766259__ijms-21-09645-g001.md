caption: Global view of the sphingolipid metabolism. Simplified representation of
  the four main pathways encompassing the synthesis of sphingolipid species, with
  ceramides as central compounds. Plain arrows indicate single reactions. Dashed arrows
  denote multiple reactions. De novo and sphingomyelin pathways result in ceramide
  synthesis from palmitic acid and sphingomyelin as ultimate precursors, respectively.
  The so-called salvage or catabolic pathway results in the production of the bioactive
  sphingosine-1 phosphate. Ceramide itself can be phosphorylated into the bioactive
  ceramide-1 phosphate. Finally, the hydrolytic or glycosphingolipid pathway leads
  to ceramide glycation. Galactosyl-ceramide is the precursor of sulfatides, not shown
  in the figure. The rest of the complex glycosphingolipids (lactosides, globosides,
  cerebrosides, and gangliosides) are derived from lactosyl ceramide (LacCer). All
  pathways are reversible except the de novo synthesis.
