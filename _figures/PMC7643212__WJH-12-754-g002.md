caption: 'Tumor necrosis family receptor superfamily member 9/tumor necrosis factor
  receptor-associated factor 1 signaling complex. Schematic representation of tumor
  necrosis family receptor (TNFR) superfamily member 9 (4-1BB) signaling pathways,
  indicating the interaction between the trimeric 4-1BB ligand presented by the antigen
  presenting cell and the three molecules of the receptor 4-1BB. The signal transduction
  occurs through tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 1. Representative
  combinations of TRAF1, 2, and 3 and their interactions with adaptor proteins are
  presented. Canonical activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) leads to the activation
  of naïve T cells, which differentiate into effector cells and proliferate after
  antigen encounter. Non-canonical NF-κB bestows proliferation and survival of effector
  cells and also drives the generation and maintenance of memory T cells in a delayed
  manner. APC: Antigen-presenting cell; 4-1BB: Tumor necrosis family receptor superfamily
  member 9; 4-1BBL: 4-1BB-ligand; TRAF: Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor; cIAP: Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein; ERK: Extracellular signal-regulated
