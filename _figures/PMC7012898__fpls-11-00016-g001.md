caption: 'Upstream and downstream targets of the TOR Complex (TORC) in plants. Upstream
  regulators of plant TORC1: Light, glucose and nutrients are known activators of
  the TOR pathway. Light activates the TOR pathway via the inactivation of the negative
  regulator COP1, triggering the activation of the auxin pathway, leading to TOR activation
  during seedling de-etiolation. Light is also known to trigger GTP-ROP2/auxin activation
  of TOR signaling in the shoot apex. Light and glucose coordinate to inactivate the
  TOR antagonist SnRK1, leading to the indirect activation of TORC. The TORC kinase
  also senses sulfur availability indirectly through glucose signaling; sulfur deficiency
  induces low glucose levels, leading to the negative regulation of TOR signaling.
  Stress signals trigger ABA binding of PYL receptors, which activate SnRK2s. SnRK2s
  directly phosphorylate RAPTOR1, inhibiting TORC signaling to promote stress responses.
  Downstream targets of plant TORC1: Direct phosphorylation targets of TORC1 include
  PP2A (via the subunit TAP46), E2FA/B and S6K, leading to the activation of cellular
  processes throughout development. elF3H and RPS6 are direct phosphorylation targets
  of S6K-P. The YAK1 kinase is inhibited by active TOR, relieving the inhibition of
  CYC/CDKs by SMRs to allow cell proliferation in the meristem. Solid arrows indicate
  direct interaction, dashed arrows indicate indirect interaction.'
