caption: Possible mechanism for the enhancement of chemotherapy-resistance by DUSP6-overexpressing
  ovarian cancer cells. Based on RNA-sequencing, with verification by qRT-PCR, DUSP6
  is overexpressed in ovarian cancer SP cells. Our study demonstrated that DUSP6-overexpressing
  SKOV3 cells possess lower levels of CyclinD3. As DUSP6 is a known negative regulator
  of ERK1/2, we revealed that overexpression of DUSP6 decreases phospho-ERK1/2 levels
  in parallel with attenuated cyclin D3 expression. CyclinD3 plays an important role
  in G1/S phase transition and decreased levels are linked with G0/G1 cell cycle arrest.
  Since SP cells are predominantly in G1 arrest, and chemotherapy-resistant, we demonstrated
  that DUSP6 increases the G0/G1 phase ratio in ovarian cancer cells by negatively
  regulating ERK signaling, which links cellular quiescence to chemotherapy-resistance.
