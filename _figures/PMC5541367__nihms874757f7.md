caption: Proposed model of D1R signaling via the cGMP/PKG pathway in breast cancer
  cells. Fen binds to D1R, activates sGC, increases cGMP levels, and activates PKG,
  leading to apoptosis. This pathway can also be activated by YC-1 or Riociguat through
  sGC, and by Cialis, Viagra or Levitra through PDE5 blockade; KT selectively inhibits
  PKG. Underlined compounds are all FDA-approved for various diseases.
