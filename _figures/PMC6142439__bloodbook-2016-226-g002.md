caption: Complement-mediated hemolysis in cold agglutinin disease. Antigen-bound CA
  on the cell surface binds C1q and initiates the classical complement pathway. C1
  esterase activates C2 and C4, generating C3 convertase, which results in the cleavage
  of C3 to C3a and C3b. Upon warming to 37°C, CA detaches from the cell, allowing
  agglutinated erythrocytes to separate, whereas C3b remains bound. A proportion of
  the C3b-coated cells is sequestered by macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system,
  mainly in the liver. On the surface of the surviving RBCs, C3b is cleaved, leaving
  high numbers of C3d molecules on the cell surface. In some situations, complement
  activation may proceed beyond the C3b step with cleavage of C5, resulting in activation
  of the terminal pathway and intravascular hemolysis. C, complement protein. Reprinted
