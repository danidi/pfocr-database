caption: 'Ingenuity pathway analysis identified a network of genes down regulated
  in response to 60 minutes of ischemia in aged mouse liver. The network is displayed
  graphically as nodes (genes/gene products) and edges (the biological relationships
  between the nodes). Different shapes of nodes represent the functional class of
  the gene product. Edges describe the nature of the relationship between the nodes.
  A total of 17 differentially expressed focus genes involved in the proteasome pathway
  are identified: proteasome subunit, alpha type (PSMA) 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7; proteasome
  26S subunit, ATPase (PSMC) 1,2,4,5, and 6; proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase (PSMD)
  2, 4, 6, 7, 11, and 12; and phosducin-like (PDCL).'
