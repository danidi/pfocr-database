caption: Summary of AGB1-dependent transcriptome changes that contribute to the N-acylethanolamine–mediated
  chloroplast response in developing Arabidopsis seedlings. The expression level of
  genes that encode enzymes in the chlorophyll biosynthesis and chlorophyll catabolism
  pathways changed as a result of NAE-18:3 treatment. The transcript abundance of
  genes that encode chlorophyll biosynthesis enzymes and transcription factors that
  modulate chlorophyll biosynthesis genes decreased in an AGB1-dependent manner after
  3 h of NAE-18:3 treatment. NAE-18:3 treatment also led to statistically significant
  changes in the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in promoting senescence,
  autophagy, and enzymes in the chlorophyll catabolic pathway in an AGB1-dependent
  manner. The results presented here show that cotyledon degreening is preceded by
  a decrease in the abundance of transcripts of chlorophyll biosynthesis genes and
  an increase in the transcripts of senescence, autophagy, and chlorophyll catabolism
  genes in an AGB1-dependent manner. This figure was created with the software BioRender.com.
