caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of proteins displaying alterations in expression
  patterns following infliximab treatment in patients deemed to be responders. (See
  Results for response definitions.) The network diagram shows the relationship between
  the indicated proteins by solid or dashed lines, which represent direct or indirect
  interactions, respectively. Up-regulated proteins are shown in red, and down-regulated
  proteins are shown in green. The network is centred on tumour necrosis factor-alpha
  (TNF-α) and nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-κB) as reflected by the number of interactions
  associated with these proteins.
