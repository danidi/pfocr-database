caption: A proposed schematic representation of Mn-dependent adaptive and toxic response
  pathways. Adaptive (left), human neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y) exposed to physiological
  Mn resulted in enrichment of protein secretion pathway by increasing gene expression
  for Golgi-residing proteins—BET1, ADAM10, and ARFGAP3. BET1 participates in vesicular
  transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex thereby participating
  in protein transport and processing. ADAM10 has α-secretase activity in the neurons
  for proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor proteins, thereby preventing
  accumulation of unwanted proteins. ARFGAP3 is a GTPase-activating protein that regulates
  the early secretory pathway of proteins. The protein secretion pathway plays an
  important role in Mn sequestration and maintaining cellular homeostasis, thus promoting
  cell survival that could protect against neurological diseases. Toxic (right), cells
  exposed to toxic Mn disrupts energy metabolism by enrichment in oxidative phosphorylation
  pathway involving genes that participate in energy metabolism—ATP6V1H, NDUFAF5,
  and FABP5. ATP6V1H is a gene in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway that couples
  ATPase activity to proton flow and mediates acidification of intracellular organelles.
  NDUFAF5 is a gene that is extremely essential in complex I assembly, which is required
  for the function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. FABP5 is gene that
  regulates lipid metabolism by binding to long-chain fatty acids specifically and
  transporting them. Disruption in cellular and mitochondrial energy metabolism along
  with oxidative stress could lead to impending cell death and inability to recover.
  This combination could eventually be detrimental and result in Mn toxicity and neurological
  diseases.
