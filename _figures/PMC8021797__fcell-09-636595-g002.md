caption: Schematic presentation of the STAT1 signaling pathway. In response to type
  I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β), phosphorylated STAT1 binds to STAT2 and forms a heterodimer,
  which further forms a complex with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), along with interferon-stimulated
  gene factor-3 (ISGF-3), and then translocate into the nucleus to bind to the IFN-stimulated
  response element (ISRE) of target genes to regulate their transcription. In response
  to type II IFN (IFN-γ), phosphorylated STAT1 forms homodimer with STAT1 or heterodimer
  with STAT3. These dimers then translocate into the nucleus to bind to the gamma-IFN
  activation site (GAS) to perform the transcriptional activity. Cytokines such as
  interleukins (ILs) that bind to their receptors without the help of JAK can activate
  STAT1 and form STAT1 homodimer, followed by the nucleus translocation. In the crosstalk
  with the TGF-β signaling pathway, STAT1 constitutively interacts with TGF-β1 receptor.
  Upon TGF-β1 binding to its receptors (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2), the receptor-complex increases
  phosphorylation STAT1α on S727. Then, the activated STAT1α dissociates itself from
  the receptor complex and translocates into the nucleus. STAT1β blocks STAT1α homodimer
  formation.
