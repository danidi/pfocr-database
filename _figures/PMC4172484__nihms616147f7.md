caption: '(A) Baseline levels of Notch signaling in the Basolateral Amygdala (BLA)
  as a consequence of ligand (Jag1 and Dll1) and receptor (Notch 1 and Notch 2) interaction
  maintains status quo and the baseline state. (B) After training, miR-34a up-regulation
  in the amygdala results in down-regulation of components of the Notch pathway and
  a decrease in Notch signaling thereby creating a molecular and cellular environment
  that is permissive to the consolidation of cued-fear memory. Green: Inhibiting miR-34a
  action in the BLA by expressing miR-34a sponges via lentiviruses impairs fear memory
  consolidation, as does overexpressing Hes1 in the BLA and consequently increasing
  Notch signaling. Yellow: In contrast, inhibiting Notch signaling by suppressing
  the activity of γ-secretase using systemic DAPT administration, or using Anti-Jag1-Fc
  antibody in the BLA enhances fear memory consolidation.'
