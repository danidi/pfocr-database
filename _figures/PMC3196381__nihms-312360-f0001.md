caption: Proposed anti-WNV signaling pathways in mosquitoes. There is very little
  information on WNV-mosquito interactions. The model is drawn based on known antiviral
  pathways in Drosophila and Anopheles. a) siRNA-mediated antiviral signaling. Extracellular
  WNV virions are recognized by a secreted C-type lectin, mosGCTL-1, which then interacts
  with a cell surface membrane-bound protein tyrosine phosphatase homologue, mosPTP-1,
  to enable receptor-mediated endocytosis of virions. The dsRNA structures of viral
  genome or dsRNA intermediates resulted from replication are processed by RNase III,
  Dcr-2, into 20–25 nt long viRNAs. viRNAs are then integrated into RISC complex containing
  Ago-2 and several other proteins. One strand of viRNA is then degraded, the remainder
  is targeted to a complementary viral RNA, which is subsequently cleaved by RISC
  clipper Ago-2. piRNA-mediated RNAi is less understood, but could resemble viRNA.
  Free siRNAs or viral RNA released by secretory transport or lysis of infected cells
  could be internalized by uninfected cells, stimulating an antiviral state. b) Toll,
  Imd and Jak-STAT antiviral pathways. Virions can be directly sensed by Toll receptors
  or viral infection and can activate a serine protease cascade, leading to activation
  of Spatzle, a Toll ligand. Engagement of Toll leads to MyD88-dependent signaling
  cascade and eventually NF-κB mediated-transcriptional induction of numerous antiviral
  factors. Similarly, virus (glycosylated envelope proteins?) acting via peptidoglycan
  recognition protein (PGRP) or other unknown receptors, may activate Imd-dependent
  antiviral gene induction. The Jak-STAT pathway is initiated by the binding of Unpaired
  (UPD) to its transmembrane receptor, Domeless (Dome), which is then phosphorylated
  by Hopscotch (Hop). Subsequent phosphorylation, dimerization and nuclear translocation
  of STAT activates antiviral gene expression.
