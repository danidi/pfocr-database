caption: The mammalian Hippo pathway and cancer. A simplified view of the mammalian
  Hippo pathway reveals two sets of core kinases—Mst1/2 and Lats1/2—whose activity
  is modulated by the NF2/Merlin tumor suppressor, members of the Ras association
  domain family (RASSF), WW45/Sav1, and Mob1. When the pathway is “active,” phosphorylation
  of the YAP or TAZ transcriptional coactivators by Lats1/2 results in degradation
  and/or cytoplasmic sequestration, while pathway “inactivation” allows unphosphorylated
  YAP/TAZ to enter the nucleus and bind one of four TEAD family members, resulting
  in context-dependent transcriptional output. In a variety of human (uppercase) and
  mouse (lowercase) cancers, upstream components of the pathway are down-regulated
  through frank deletion (NF2) or epigenetic mechanisms (decreased expression shown
  in blue). YAP, TAZ, and TEAD are up-regulated in a variety of human tumors (increased
  expression shown in red) by mechanisms that include gene amplification and silencing
  of upstream components of the pathway. The porphyrin molecule verteporfin (VP) disrupts
  the formation of the YAP–TEAD complex by binding to YAP and changing its conformation,
  thereby blocking the transcription of downstream targets.
