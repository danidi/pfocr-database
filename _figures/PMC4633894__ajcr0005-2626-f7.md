caption: 'Schematic Model for ATG5/CHOP/Smac pathway and ATG5/Smac pathway in cancer
  cells responding to hypoxia. A. Interactions between autophagy, ER stress and mitochondrial
  response in cancer cells responding to hypoxia induced by CoCl2: Although Beclin-1
  can be down or up-regulated in responding to the CoCl2-induced hypoxia, it does
  not participate in autophagy formation. In contrast, ATG5 does not significantly
  respond to the hypoxia in transcription, it critically participate autophagy formation
  in the hypoxia. There are two pathways for ATG5 participating the induction of programmed
  cell death of cancer, each pathway have a subpathway by passing LC3II formation.
  Pathway A, autophagy, ER and mitochondrial responses: (a1) ATG5/CHOP/LC3II/Smac;
  (a2) ATG5/CHOP/SMAC; pathway B, autophagy and mitochondrial responses: (b1) ATG5/LC3II/SMAC;
  and (b2) ATG5/SMAC. B. Comparison of the ATG5/CHOP/SMAC pathway in the HeLa cells
  with the ATG5/SMAC pathway in the MDA-MB-231 cells: In the HeLa cells, ATG5 up-regulates
  CHOP, which subsequently up-regulates SMAC; while in the MDA-MB-231 cells, ATG5
  induces LC3 II/I, leading to activation of SMAC. In addition, ATG5-induced CHOP
  in the HeLa cells also promotes LC3II, forming a positive loop to strengthen PCD
  through activation of SMAC/caspase-3 pathway, whereas CHOP inhibits ATG5 in the
  MDA-MB-231 cells in the absence of CoCl2. ATG5: Autophagy protein 5; ATF4: activating
  transcription factor 4 (tax-responsive enhancer element B67); XBP1 u/s: X-box binding
  protein 1 unspliced/spliced; LC3/ MAP1LC3A: Microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B
  light chain 3A; a light chain of the microtubule-associated protein 1; CHOP/DDIT3:
  DNA-damage inducible transcript 3; SMAC/ DIABLO: second mitochondria-derived activator
  of caspases; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; Mit. Stress: mitochondrial stress; PCD:
  programmed cell death.'
