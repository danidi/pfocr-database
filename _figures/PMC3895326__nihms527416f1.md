caption: a, Previously identified biosynthetic pathway for cmo5U at wobble uridines.
  First, the wobble uridine is converted to ho5U by an unknown mechanism, followed
  by the action of CmoA and CmoB. b, Mechanism for CmoA-catalyzed Cx-SAM formation
  from SAM and prephenate. c, Mechanism for CmoB-catalyzed formation of cmo5U from
  ho5U and Cx-SAM.
