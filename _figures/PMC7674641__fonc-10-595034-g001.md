caption: Overview of metabolic pathways connected to protein prenylation. Citrate
  generated from glutamine or the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) is cleaved
  by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. Acetyl-CoA can also
  be synthesized by cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACSS2) from exogenous acetate.
  Acetyl-CoA, can be carboxylated to malonyl-CoA, to produce fatty acids (FA). Lipids
  can also be incorporated through exogenous uptake. Alternatively, acetyl-CoA enters
  the mevalonate pathway, where three molecules are condensed in a two-step reaction
  to produce 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA). HMG-CoA is then reduced by
  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) to produce mevalonate. Mevalonate
  is then converted into isopentenyl-diphosphate (IPP) through a series of enzymatic
  steps. IPP serves as a monomeric unit for the consequent synthesis of farnesyl diphosphate
  (FPP), geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) and other downstream metabolites (cholesterol,
  dolichol, coenzyme Q10, heme A, etc.). The isoprenoid moiety of FPP or GGPP may
  be covalently attached to cysteine residues on the carboxyl terminus of some proteins,
  in the first step of the protein prenylation pathway. For example, the activity
  of RHOA is regulated by geranylgeranylation, which localizes RHOA to the plasma
  membrane. RHOA promotes the nuclear localization and activity of the Yes-associated
  protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Gain
  of function p53 mutants (mut p53) functionally interact with sterol regulatory element
  binding proteins (SREBPs) to drive increased expression of mevalonate pathway genes.
  In contrast, wild type p53 (wt p53) represses the mevalonate pathway genes through
  inhibition of SREBP-2 maturation, as a consequence of transcriptional induction
  of ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 1 (ABCA1). Additionally, p53 point mutants
  can induce isoprenylcysteine carboxymethyltransferase (ICMT) expression, while wt
  p53 exerts the opposite effect, through transcriptional repression. ICMT catalyzes
  protein carboxymethylation, the last step of the protein prenylation pathway. The
  methyl donor in this reaction is S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), which is produced
  from the essential aminoacid methionine in the rate-limiting reaction catalyzed
  by methionine adenosyl transferase (MAT). SAM is transformed into S-adenosyl homocysteine
  (SAH), which can be used to regenerate methionine through the methionine cycle.
  Homocysteine can be derived to the transsulfuration pathway (TSP) to synthesize
  glutathione (GSH). Dashed arrows represent multiple enzymatic steps. Indications
  on reversibility of enzymatic reactions and subcellular localization of some enzymes
  have been omitted for simplicity. Enzymes known to be regulated by SREBPs are shown
