caption: Pathways of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis, highlighting roles of Bcl-2
  family members. The expression in β-cells of the various Bcl-2 family proteins listed
  is currently unknown, and their potential contributions are largely uncharacterized.
  The study of Grunnet et al. highlights a pathway leading from the IL-1 receptor
  (IL-1R) to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated via dephosphorylation of the
  BH3-only protein Bad. Sequestering members of the prosurvival group of Bcl-2 proteins
  relieves inhibition of Bax/Bak leading to downstream caspase activation. Previous
  work has identified a role for cleavage of Bid downstream of the TNFR, thus defining
  a cross-talk mechanism between the extrinsic and instrinsic apoptotic pathways ().
  How other known signals arising from IL-1R interact with Bcl-2 family members in
  β-cells is poorly understood. For simplicity, full signaling events downstream of
  IL-1R and TNFR are omitted, such as their cross-talk with each other, as well as
  the contribution of other relevant receptors such as that for interferon-γ.
