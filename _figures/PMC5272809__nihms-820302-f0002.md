caption: While the exact triggers for purinosome formation are not known, diffusion
  and protein-protein interaction studies have provided insight into how purinosomes
  may assemble in cells under purine-depleted growth conditions. (B) The first three
  enzymes in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway (PPAT, GART, and FGAMS) form
  the core of the purinosome and assemble first before secondary complexes of [PAICS·ADSL]
  and [ATIC] interact with the core. (C) Several proteomic studies have uncovered
  interactions between the enzymes in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway [, -].
  Captured here is the oligomeric state of the active form of each enzyme in the de
  novo purine biosynthetic pathway and those protein-protein interactions reported
  between them where the interaction strength (edge thickness) corresponds to the
  number of studies referencing the interaction. Downstream enzymes of IMP, IMPDH
  and ADSS, were also shown to be part of the purinosome; however, no protein-protein
  interactions between these enzymes and the de novo purine biosynthetic enzymes have
  been reported []. Likewise, Hsp90 and CK2 have been demonstrated to influence purinosome
  formation in cells by unknown mechanisms [, ].
