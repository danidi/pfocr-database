caption: Nodal pathway mutants affect the development of the ventral diencephalic
  and pretectal catecholaminergic neurons. A–E, th expression revealing the effects
  of mutations within the Nodal pathway on catecholaminergic neuron development (lateral
  views, anterior is to the left). A, D, th expression in wild-type embryos at 72
  and 48 hpf, respectively. B, In cyc mutant embryos, both the ventral diencephalic
  DA neurons and the catecholaminergic neurons of the pretectum fail to develop, whereas
  the CA neurons in the hindbrain are unaffected. C, By 72 hpf, oep mutants lack diencephalic
  catecholaminergic neurons, whereas those of the hindbrain clusters are formed. E,
  By 48 hpf, MZsur mutant embryos develop few-to-no catecholaminergic neurons in the
  diencephalon, whereas the LC appears normal. White arrows indicate absence of PrC;
  white arrowheads indicate absence of vDD. AD, Amacrine dopaminergic neurons; vDD,
  ventral diencephalic dopaminergic neurons; MC, medulla oblongata catecholaminergic
  neurons; PrC, pretectal catecholaminergic neurons. Scale bars, 100 μm.
