caption: Neighbor-Joining tree of flavin-dependent halogenases associated with characterized
  secondary metabolites. On each of the corresponding secondary metabolite, the site
  of halogenation is indicated. Red branches correspond to halogenases that modify
  acyl carrier protein bound substrates, and green branches correspond to enzymes
  that halogenate free substrates. The blue branch is occupied by Amm3, described
  in this work, and MibH, a halogenase that likely modifies a tryptophan embedded
  in a peptide substrate. MUSCLE alignment and phylogenetic tree were generated using
  Geneious 8.1.5.
