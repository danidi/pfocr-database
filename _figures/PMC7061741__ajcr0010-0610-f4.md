caption: A schematic diagram shows the proposed mechanism by which the Hippo pathway
  regulates cervical cancer. In cervical cancer cells, nuclear accumulation of YAP
  protein stimulates the expression of EGF-like ligands, such as TGF-α and AREG, which
  in turn activates EGFR and inhibits LATS 1/2 and MOB1 binding and further phosphorylation.
  Activated YAP activates transcription factors and induces the expression of growth
  factors, such as TGF-α and AREG, thereby promoting the growth of cervical cancer.
  HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins maintain YAP protein levels in cervical cancer cells by preventing
  the degradation of proteasome-dependent YAP. Accordingly, the high expression of
  YAP further promotes persistent HPV infection by upregulating putative HPV membrane
  receptor molecules and suppressing innate immunity in host cells.
