caption: LMP1 activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which causes the phosphorylation
  of FOXO3a. Phosphorylated FOXO3a then translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus
  and will most likely be degraded. The reduction of FOXO3a in the nucleus results
  in miR-21 production, which, then functions to reduce PDCD4 and Fas-L expression.
  These proteins are involved in mitochondrial and membrane-mediated apoptosis, leading
  to resistance to apoptosis and cisplatin in NPC cells (indicated by the solid lines).
  The ability to protect host cells from apoptosis is essential for EBV to establish
  its persistent latent infection, and therefore proapoptotic PDCD4 and Fas-L are
  usually the key target genes regulated by EBV in latency (indicated by dashed lines).
  This newly discovered signaling pathway should provide potential drug targets for
  sensitizing cancer cells to apoptosis and overcoming chemoresistance in LMP1-activated
  NPC cells.
