caption: 'Regulatory network of MYO18B mRNA that reflect the survival outcome in hepatocellular
  carcinoma. (A,B) Schematic showing MYO18B mRNA expression is inhibited by IFN-γ
  and bFGF through CEBPB (panel-A) but promotes the same in C19MC miR-520G stable
  cells (panel-B). (C) Schematic showing the requirement of CEBPB binding site within
  the regulatory regions of target genes to get enhanced transcription by IFN-γ. Note:
  IFI27 gene regulatory region do not harbor CEBPB binding sites but MYO18B has CEBPB
  binding sites. (D) Overall signaling pathway that reflects survival outcome in HCCs:
  based on experiments and clinical data.'
