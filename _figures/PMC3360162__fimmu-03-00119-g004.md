caption: 'Synthesis of eicosanoids and their actions in mast cells. Synthesis of eicosanoids
  is initiated by activation of cPLA2 via Erk-dependent pathway, followed by Ca2+-dependent
  translocation of cPLA2 to the plasma membrane where it liberates the arachidonic
  acid. Free arachidonic acid can be metabolized by three independent pathways: lipoxygenase
  pathway, cyclooxygenase pathway and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase pathway. The 5-lipoxygenase
  in cooperation with FLAP mediates transition of arachidonic acid to unstable LTA4.
  LTA4 is subsequently converted to LTB4, LTC4, and LTD4. In the cyclooxygenase pathway,
  arachidonic acid is converted to intermediate PGH2 by peroxidase activity of COX
  enzymes. PGH2 is then metabolized by specific enzymes to final products that include
  PGE2 and PGD2. Cytochrome P450 metabolizes arachidonic acid to epoxyeicosatrienoic
  acids (EETs), hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs), and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acids (HETEs). The final products are transported outside the cell by specific multidrug
  resistance protein (MRP) ABC-type transporters and can act there as chemoattractants
  for mast cells, their progenitors or other cells. Eicosanoids mediate their action
  via different GPCRs (BLT1, BLT2, CysLT1, CysLT2, EP2, EP3, DP1, and DP2) localized
  on the plasma membrane of target cells. Eicosanoids in red bodies are those secreted
  from mast cells and acting as chemoattractants on various targets.'
