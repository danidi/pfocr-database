caption: 'Schematic representation of UPR activation and patient outcome in cancer.
  The tumor microenvironment in EOC induces constant ER stress in cancer cells leading
  to the activation of the UPR pathway. The three branches of UPR: PERK, ATF6, and
  IRE1 have been implicated in cancer growth and progression. In several cancers,
  PERK, ATF6 and IRE1 expression along with the master regulators of ER stress, GRP78
  and PDI are elevated compared to normal tissue. High levels of PDI and GRP78 can
  be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of EOC patients.'
