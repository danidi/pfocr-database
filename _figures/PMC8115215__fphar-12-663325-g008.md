caption: Schematic illustration of PSA regulatory mechanism of VRC metabolism. PSA
  inhibits the TLR4/NF-κB axis signal transduction pathway induced by LPS, suppressed
  the secretion of mature IL-1β in the cytoplasm, promotes the expression of liver
  drug metabolic enzyme (CYP2C19) and transporter (P-gp and its protein coding gene
  ABCB1), and finally improves the metabolic ability of voriconazole.
