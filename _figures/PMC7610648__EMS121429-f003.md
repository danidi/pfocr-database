caption: Mechanism of replication-coupled ICL repair. ICLs are repaired during replication
  by the NEIL3 (left) or Fanconi anemia (right) pathways. Convergent replication forks
  stall at ICLs. NEIL3 glycosylase is recruited to cleave the ICL and the resulting
  DNA is repaired by translesion synthesis (TLS). If NEIL3 cleavage fails, the FA
  pathway repairs the ICL. Activation of the FA core complex and mono-ubiquitination
  of FANCD2-FANCI, leads to the recruitment of SLX4 with its partner endonuclease
  XPF-ERCC1. Dual incisions occur on either side of the ICL. The resulting DSB is
  repaired by TLS and HR.
