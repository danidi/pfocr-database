caption: 'Schematic image representing the mechanisms found in our study. (1) IBS
  leads to phosphorylation of p38 (2), which in turn causes TNF-α converting enzyme
  (TACE) activation and GpIb shedding (3). The latter is also up-regulated by the
  release of neuraminidase from intracellular stores, which cleaves sialic acid residues
  on GpIbα, priming the receptor for cleavage. IBS also induces (likely by UV) upregulation
  of the pro-apoptotic Bak (4), which results in the induction of apoptosis through
  a caspase-dependent pathway. Both processes lead to a reduced response of platelets
  to agonists and an accelerated clearance in vivo. GC: glycocalicin.'
