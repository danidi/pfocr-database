caption: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell engineering using different CAR designs
  and their in vivo persistence. Second-generation CAR T cells containing a CD3 zeta
  signaling domain, a CD28 or 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain and a scFv that will be
  displayed at the surface of the T cell for anti-cancer antigen recognition. For
  the second-generation CARs is indicated their dependence on a metabolic pathway
  and their persistence in vivo according to the co-stimulatory domain used. The third
  generation CAR contains 2 co-stimulatory domains.
