caption: 'Single-stranded RNA loading to AGO-clade Argonaute proteins. (A) mir-451
  is an miRNA widely conserved in vertebrates. Its precursor hairpin is generated
  by Drosha but too short (42 nt) to be cleaved by Dicer. Instead, the hairpin is
  directly loaded to Ago2 and cleaved on the 3′ arm by the slicer activity of Ago2.
  The resulting ac-pre-mir-451 (Ago2-cleaved-pre-miRNA: 30 nt) is further resected
  by the PARN exonuclease to mature as ~22–26 nt miR-451. (B) miRNA loop species loads
  to AGO. In the miRNA processing pathway, the loop region of pre-miRNA is released
  as non-structured RNA after processing by Dicer. Processed loops were considered
  as mere by-products, however, recent studies revealed that select miRNA loops are
  loaded to Argonaute complexes. Loaded loops are enriched with 5′U species, and their
  loading occurs independently of the HSP90/HSP70 system, in contrast to mature miRNAs
  loaded as duplexes. (C) Processing of tRNAs in eukaryotes. tRNAs are transcribed
  by RNA pol III whose transcription terminates with runs of U. The precursor tRNA
  contains a 5′ leader and a 3′ trailer, which are cleaved by RNaseP and RNaseZ, respectively.
  Nucleotidyl transferase adds CCA untemplated trinucleotides and the tRNA matures
  after further chemical modifications and aminoacylation. In addition to mature tRNA
  products, a variety of small RNA fragments (tRFs) are produced from tRNAs. After
  RNaseZ-mediated cleavage, some 3′ trailers containing 5′ Us are released as stable
  species termed 3′ U tRFs. Mature tRNAs can also produce Dicer-dependent species
  that are cleaved at the D-loop (5′ tRFs) or at the T-loop (3′ CCA tRFs). Some of
  3′U tRFs, 5′ tRFs, and 3′ CCA tRFs are loaded to Argonaute complexes and play gene
  regulatory roles.'
