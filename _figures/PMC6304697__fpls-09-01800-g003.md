caption: Plant metabolic orientation of hormone interplay, carbon partitioning and
  responses on mycorrhizal development under low available P. Box and arrow color
  indicate repression (red), or promotion (green). Orange boxes and black arrows are
  used for uncertain conditions. Based on the literature survey, mycorrhizal colonization
  is enhanced under low available P which goes together with the action of AM-promoting
  hormones (such as ABA, SL, and JA). This hormonal interplay is connected to a favorable
  metabolic frame which involves lower phytosynthetic activity, higher translocation
  of photosynthetats from shoots to roots, accumulation of sugars (reduced glycolysis
  flow and enhanced lipid oxidation), enhanced plant fermentation activity, cytosolic
  reductive potential (elevated NADH pool), electron partitioning which is orientated
  toward the alternative oxidase pathway, reduced ATP formation and ISR implementation.
  Root exudation of several sugars, aminoacids, some carboxylic acids and hormones
  (such as SL) participate to the molecular dialog with mycorrhizal fungi present
  in the rhizosphere. This can support physical contact with the root by stimulating
  hyphal branching and to induce plant responses by promoting Myc factor release from
  germative spore exudates. It is questioned if this metabolic flux is accompanied
  by lower oxygen consumption by plant cells, which may become more available for
  the fungus (as aerobic organism) under low P. ABA, abscisic acid; JA, jasmonate;
  GA, gibberellins; SA, salicylic acid; SL, strigolactones; ET, ethylene; CK, cytokinins;
