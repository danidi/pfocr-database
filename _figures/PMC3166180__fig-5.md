caption: Zn2+-dependent signaling in neuronal tolerance. A sublethal preconditioning
  stimulus can cause a transient accumulation of neuronal free Zn2+. The Zn2+ rise
  originates mainly from intracellular sources, like neuronal MT-3, and is facilitated
  by PKC-dependent phosphorylation at serine 32 of MT. Neuronal free Zn2+ can affect
  several downstream targets. In mediating long-term tolerance, Zn2+ can activate
  the transcription of Zn2+-regulated genes or can activate a caspase-3 mediated pathway
  leading to the upregulation of heat shock proteins. In addition, Zn2+ can contribute
  to immediate homeostatic processes in regulating neuronal excitability by modulating
  the activity and localization of Kv2.1 channels. Together, Zn2+ plays a central
  role in several neuroprotective strategies after sublethal ischemia. (To see this
  illustration in color the reader is referred to the web version of this article
