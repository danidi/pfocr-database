caption: Summary of mutants in GSH synthesis and metabolism shown to affect allicin
  resistance. The diagram shows (A) the interplay between the NADPH-generating steps
  of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway and (B) GSH synthesis and metabolism. The steps
  at which the respective deletion mutants (Δzwf1, Δgnd1, Δyap1, Δgsh1, Δgsh2, Δglr1)
  act in yeast cells are shown in red. Allicin reacts directly with reduced glutathione
  (GSH) to form S-allylmercaptoglutathione (GSSA). The Pentose Phosphate Pathway provides
  NADPH as an electron donor for the enzyme glutathione reductase (Glr), that reduces
  GSSA to GSH and allylmercaptan (ASH, prop-2-ene-1-thiol). Yap1 is the central regulator
  for the oxidative stress response in yeast and activates several genes important
  for the antioxidant response, including gsh1 and gsh2 whose protein products catalyze
  GSH biosynthesis, and glr1 which is necessary for the reduction of GSSG and GSSA
  to GSH by Glr1. Cysteine (Cys) and glutamine (Glu) are converted to γ-l-glutamyl-l-cysteine
  by Gsh1, and the addition of glycine (Gly) is catalyzed by Gsh2 to form GSH.
