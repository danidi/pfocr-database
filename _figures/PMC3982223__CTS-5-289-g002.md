caption: Effect of carbamazepine, fluphenazine, and pimozide on intracellular degradation
  of mutant ATZ. Soluble forms of ATZ (purple) are degraded by the proteasomal pathway
  (top right) and insoluble aggregates of ATZ (gold) are degraded by autophagy (bottom
  right). Carbamazepine appears to enhance autophagy and also the proteasome. Fluphenazine
  and pimozide enhance the autophagic degradation of ATZ.
