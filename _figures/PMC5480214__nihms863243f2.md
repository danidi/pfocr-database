caption: 'Summary of ergot-alkaloid biosynthetic pathways with emphasis on Clavicipitaceae.
  Colors indicate precursors (black), early steps (blue), middle steps (green), and
  late steps in Trichocomaceae (purple) and Clavicipitaceae (red). Examples of fungal
  species are given for ergot alkaloids that are pathway end products in those fungi.
  Several metabolites are end products in some fungi and intermediates in others,
  though even intermediates often accumulate to substantial levels in the fungus or
  host plant. Other metabolites (ergotryptamine and setoclavine) are spur products
  derived from early intermediates, and a question regarding elymoclavine biosynthesis
  in Claviceps fusiformis is discussed in the text. Enzyme designations are based
  on gene names (). Cofactors (except O2, H2O, and H2O2) and L-amino acids are indicated
  with standard abbreviations. Other abbreviations are as follow: DMAPP =dimethylallyl
  diphosphate, PhP = 4′-phosphopantetheine, and 2-OG = 2-oxoglutarate. Some cofactors
  are confirmed, whereas others are predicted based on signature sequences of the
  enzymes. In some cases, FAD can act in place of FMN, NADP in place of NAD+, and
  NADPH in place of NADH. Amino acids specified by the three LpsA modules vary, so
  they are generically designated aa1, aa2, and aa3.'
