caption: 'A: Strychnine treatment alone disinhibits GABAergic synaptic boutons that
  express NOS, leading to strong production of NO. GABAergic NOS amacrine cells may
  have wide-field arborizations and potentially more synaptic boutons expressing NOS
  than glycinergic amacrine synaptic boutons. These high levels of NO stimulate basal
  levels of sGC in glycinergic synaptic boutons still receiving GABAAR inhibition
  and activate sGC in disinhibited GABAergic synaptic boutons receiving glycinergic
  inhibition, leading to strong cGMP production. B: Adding TPMPA enhances glutamate
  output from the bipolar cell axon terminals onto both GABAergic and glycinergic
  amacrine dendritic processes, leading to enhanced inhibition between amacrine cells.
  However, the presence of strychnine prevents enhanced glycinergic inhibition of
  GABAergic synaptic boutons containing NOS or sGC, therefore the level of NO production
  from GABAergic cells should remain similar to that seen with strychnine alone. Enhanced
  GABAergic inhibition through GABAAR, however, would reduce the activity of sGC in
  glycinergic synaptic boutons. The net result of adding TPMPA would be similar levels
  of NO production but reduced cGMP production. It is also possible that the sources
  of NO are further away from the cells with sGC. C: Bicuculline treatment alone disinhibits
  glycinergic synaptic boutons expressing NOS. However, since glycinergic amacrine
  cells may be narrow-field cells, potentially having fewer synaptic boutons containing
  NOS, the effect of bicuculline on NO production is moderate. Since cGMP production
  is predominantly localized with glycine, more synaptic boutons expressing sGC may
  be glycinergic. Bicuculline would excite these glycinergic sGC-containing synaptic
  boutons, increasing the NO-sensitivity of the sGC in these boutons to the moderate
  levels of NO, still permitting a strong increase in cGMP levels. It is also possible
  that the sources of NO are closer to the cells with sGC. D: Adding TPMPA will enhance
  the glycinergic inhibition on the minority of sGC-containing synaptic boutons that
  are GABAergic, leading to slightly reduced cGMP levels.'
