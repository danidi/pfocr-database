caption: The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. A. When Wnt1 is active, kinase
  GSK3β is inactivated and β-catenin is free to enter the nucleus and begin transcription
  in co-operation with TCF4. B. When Frizzled is not ligated by Wnt1, GSK3β remains
  active and in co-operation with APC, axin, conductin and Casein kinase II phosphorylates
  β-catenin, which is then targeted for proteasome degradation.TCF4 remains associated
  with the inhibitor Groucho and transcription is not initiated.
