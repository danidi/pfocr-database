caption: 'Presynaptic: The active zone (AZ) is indicated by a T-bar. Cell membrane
  components include PS integrins (α3 and βPS subunits), homophilic CAM Fasciclin
  II (FasII) and cacophony calcium channels (Cac). Cytoplasmic proteins include kinases
  JNK and Shaggy, and the MAP1B Futsch. Postsynaptic: The glutamate receptor (GluR)
  domain includes two GluR classes (GluRIIA and B) and potassium channels (K+). Cell
  membrane components include PS integrins (α1/2 and βPS) and FasII. Membrane associated
  and cytoplasmic proteins include scaffolding proteins Discs large (DLG) and Dock,
  kinase PAK and regulators PIX and GIT1, and calmodulin kinase II (CamKII). Trans-synaptic
  pathways: Secreted signals Wingless (Wg), Glass bottom boat (Gbb) and Jelly belly
  (Jeb), and their respective membrane cognate receptors Frizzled 2 (Fz2), Thickveins
  (Tkv)/Wishful Thinking (Wit)/Saxophone (Sax) and Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk).
  The Frizzled nuclear import pathway is indicated as FNI. The known downstream transcription
  factor for Gbb is Mothers against decapentaplegic (Mad; P-Mad indicating phosphorylated
  form), and for Jeb is ERK (P-ERK indicating phosphorylated form). Extracellular
  synaptomatrix components are indicated as ECM between the presynaptic neuron and
  postsynaptic muscle cells.'
