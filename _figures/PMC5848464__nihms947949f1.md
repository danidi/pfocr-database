caption: Regulation of canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation by
  cylindromatosis (CYLD). NF-κB can be activated by canonical and noncanonical pathways,
  which rely on IκB degradation and p100 processing, respectively. Noncanonical NF-κB
  signaling involves receptor-mediated degradation of negative regulatory ubiquitin
  ligase complex, c-IAP/TRAF2/TRAF3, and accumulation of NIK. The canonical pathway
  involves K63 type of ubiquitination of several signaling components, particularly
  receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), which is required for the recruitment and
  activation of IκB kinase (IKK) and its activating kinase, Tak1. This pathway can
  be stimulated by various immune receptors, including TNFR1 (shown in the figure),
  IL-1R, TLRs, antigen receptors, etc (not shown). Activation of IKK by TNFR1 involves
  RIP1 ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRAF2, and cIAP1 and 2 (cIAP1/2).,
  Additionally, K63-linked ubiquitination of an NF-κB coactivator, Bcl3, promotes
  its nuclear translocation and, thereby, enhances NF-κB function. The different NF-κB
  complexes regulate distinct target genes, although they may function cooperatively
  in many cases. CYLD deubiquitinates the canonical NF-κB signaling components and
  Bcl3, and negatively regulates the NF-κB activation and Bcl3 nuclear translocation.
  Additionally, CYLD may also indirectly inhibit the atypical NF-κB pathways, as the
  inducible expression of noncanonical NF-κB members, RelB and NF-κB2 p100, and the
  coactivator, Bcl3, depends on the canonical NF-κB activation
