caption: Schematic summarizing the present findings. IL-6 signals through the MEK/ERK/Mnk
  pathway to phosphorylate the cap-binding protein eIF4E. NGF signals primarily through
  the PI3 kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway to phosphorylate both 4EBP and eIF4G. Phosphorylation
  of 4EBP, which is a negative regulator of eIF4F complex formation, results in its
  dissociation from eIF4E, thus allowing the binding of eIF4E to eIF4G to occur. Phosphorylation
  of eIF4E and eIF4G enhances the formation of the eIF4F cap-binding complex. The
  outcome of IL-6- and NGF-mediated eIF4F cap complex formation is the enhancement
  of cap-dependent translation, leading to rapid changes in translational control
  of gene expression in sensory neurons, and this effect is linked to mechanical allodynia
  evoked by these algogens.
