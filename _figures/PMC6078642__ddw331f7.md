caption: Enzymes necessary for local aldosterone synthesis are present in muscle-derived
  leukocytes. Schematic diagram depicting the aldosterone synthesis pathway and enzyme
  required for each step. Presence of each enzyme was confirmed by sequencing of RT-PCR
  products. Yellow star = detected in muscle cultures (myotubes generated from dystrophin-deficient
  mdx mouse neonatal myoblasts), green star = detected in immune cells (leukocytes
  isolated from C57BL/10 wild-type mice), and red star = detected in whole muscle
  tissue (diaphragm muscle tissue from dystrophin/utrophin-deficient double knockout
  dko mouse).
