caption: Schematic presentation of early steps of SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. The virus
  enters the cells by interacting with its receptor ACE2 protein using the spike protein
  and priming by the cell surface protease TMPRSS2. This induces formation of a vesicle
  via clathrin-dynamin-mediated endocytosis. The internalized vesicle loses its clathrin
  coat and fuses with an endosome. As the endosome undergoes acidification, it activates
  host proteases that induce fusion of the virus particle with the endosomal membrane,
  releasing the viral genomic RNA into the cytosol. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA is (+) sense,
  it can immediately undergo translation and further transcription to allow the remaining
  steps of virus life cycle to continue. The left panel illustrates the key explaining
  the different components of this pathway. See text for details.
