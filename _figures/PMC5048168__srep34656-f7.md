caption: (a) Normal TNFα-dependent signal propagation is capable of proceeding through
  both AKT and RIPK1-dependent pathways, which culminates in the activation of either
  ERK1/2 or NFκB and thus promotes inflammatory mediator induction. RIPK1 and AKT
  can both interact with MEKK3, providing cross-talk for signal flux between these
  pathways. Additionally, RIPK1 indirectly activates AKT via its role in reducing
  expression of PTEN, a phosphatase that inhibits the PI3K/AKT pathway. During TNFα
  stimulation, signal flux can be monitored through these pathways by the detection
  of high phosphorylation status of MEK1/2, IKKα/β and IκBα. (b) Here we demonstrated
  that P. gingivalis dysregulates TNFα-dependent signaling via degradation of host
  cell RIPK1, TAK1 and AKT kinases. Degradation of host kinases would limit the required
  interactions of RIPK1 and AKT with MEKK3, in addition to IKK recruitment, effectively
  blunting ERK1/2 and NFκB activation and proinflammatory induction. Cross-talk between
  pathways would be reduced due to a lack of RIPK1 initiating an increase in PTEN
  levels, allowing for inhibition of AKT activity. Attenuated signal flux was observed
  within downstream signaling proteins (reduced phosphorylation of MEK1/2, IKKα/β
  and IκBα). Of note, Nakayama et. al. have reported that P. gingivalis infection
  impairs PI3K/AKT activity through degradation of an unidentified membrane protein,
  creating a secondary assault to the signaling capacity of the AKT pathway. Dashed
  boxes represent host proteins whose protein abundance and/or activity are disrupted
  by P. gingivalis. Circled proteins are internal signaling proteins whose phosphorylation
  status are reduced and those in triangles are terminal signaling proteins identified
  to have reduced phosphorylation and/or activity during P. gingivalis induced dysregulated
  TNFα signaling.
