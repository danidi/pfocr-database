caption: 'a Organization, size and GC content of the frs BGCs from “Ca. B. crenata”
  and C. vaccinii (gray = NRPS, white = modifying enzyme). b Biosynthetic pathway
  of 1. First, the NRPS FrsDEFG together with FrsH forms a seven-membered linear peptide
  chain which is then hydrolyzed and cyclized by FrsGTE to 2. Then, FrsATE catalyzes
  intermolecular transesterification of N-Pp-Hle synthesized by FrsACAT and FrsH (see
  Fig. ) onto 2 to yield the final product 1 (or 3). Pp = Propionyl, Ac = Acetyl,
  Me = Methyl, Hle = l-3-Hydroxyleucine, PLA = Phenyllactic acid, Dha = Dehydroalanine.
  Domains are abbreviated as: C = condensation A = adenylation, T = thiolation, E =
  epimerization, MT = methyl transferase. Modules are colored according to their activated
  amino acid precursors. c Nucleotide alignment of frsA and frsD. All predicted domains
  and identity are indicated. Prediction of domains was conducted with InterPro (EMBL).'
