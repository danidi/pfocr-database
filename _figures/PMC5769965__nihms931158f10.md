caption: 'Astrocytes exposed to cocaine and Tat undergo several changes in cholesterol
  homeostasis. In astrocytes (left), intracellular levels of cholesterol are reduced
  following cocaine and Tat exposure. This diminishes activation of the LXR signaling
  pathway and therefore decreases expression of LXRβ target genes, ApoE and ABCa1.
  ApoE is a major carrier of cholesterol and forms a lipoprotein complex to export
  cholesterol out of the cell. ABCa1 transporters aid in lipidating and exporting
  these complexes into the extracellular compartment. In the presence of cocaine and
  Tat, there is a significant decrease in intracellular and extracellular ApoE and
  cellular ABCa1. In agreement with diminished intracellular cholesterol and reduced
  secreted ApoE, there is significantly less cholesterol released into the extracellular
  environment. In response to reduced cholesterol levels, SREBP2 is cleaved into is
  active form to stimulate cholesterol biosynthesis through the upregulation of target
  genes important for cholesterol synthesis including, HMCGR. Neurons (right) utilize
  cholesterol to maintain many functions including synaptic vesicle formation and
  maintenance of cell structure. To compensate for the diminished availability of
  astrocyte-derived cholesterol, neurons upregulated the expression of LDLR likely
  in an effort to bring in more lipidated ApoE particles. Deficits in cholesterol
  supply to neurons could have detrimental effects including loss of synaptic integrity,
  failed neurotransmission, and gradual cognitive decline. Key: Red arrows indicate
  decline, green arrows indicate increases, transparent symbols signify a reduction,
  dotted lines suggest upregulation. Abbreviations: LXRβ (Liver X Receptor Beta),
  ApoE (apolipoprotein E), ABCa1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter 1), SREBP2 (Sterol
  response element binding protein 2), HMGCR (3-Hydroxy-3- Methylglutaryl-CoA Reductase),
  LDLR (Low density lipoprotein receptor) and CYP46a1 (Cytochrome P450 Family 46),
  LXRE (LXR-response element), RXRγ (Retinoic acid receptor gamma).'
