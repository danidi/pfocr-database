caption: 'Schematic illustration of the Shh signaling pathway. A, In Shh-producing
  cells, the Shh precursor is proteolytically cleaved to generate the N-Shh in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Secreted Shh contains two covalent cholesterol modifications:
  a C-terminal cholesterol moiety and a palmitoyl group is added at the N-terminus.
  Skn and Dispatched, mediate the release of Shh ligand. B, The canonical Shh signaling.
  In the inactive state, the transmembrane protein receptor Ptch1 interacts with and
  inhibits the activity of a seven transmembrane protein, Smo. Interactions with cytoplasmic
  proteins, including Fused and Sufu, the transcription factors Gli are prevented
  from entering the nucleus and downstream target genes expression are repressed.
  In the active state, Shh binding to Ptch1, which allows Smo activation, thereby
  activating the cascade that leads to the Gli transcription factors to exert their
  effects in the nucleus. C, The non-canonical Shh signaling. There are two types
  of non-canonical Shh signaling pathways, one is Ptch1-dependent which regulates
  cell apoptosis and proliferation, the second is Smo-dependent which associate with
  modulation of actin cytoskeleton-dependent processes. Shh, Sonic hedgehog. N-Shh,
  N-terminal Sonic hedgehog. Skn, Skinny hedgehog. Ptch1, Patched-1. Smo, Smoothened.
  Hhip1, Hedgehog-interacting protein 1. Fu, Fused. Sufu, Suppressor of fused. Gli,
  Glioma-associated oncogenes.'
