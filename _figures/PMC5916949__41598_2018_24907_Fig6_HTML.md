caption: A schematic depicting the potential involvement of MALAT1 in regulating inflammation
  through epigenetic mechanisms in diabetic retinopathy. Based on our findings, we
  present a diagram for MALAT1 in potentially regulating inflammation by independent
  and dependent pathways in DR. In the independent pathways, indicated by ‘1’, DNA
  methylation regulates the transcriptional status of MALAT1 and if the actions of
  DNA methyltransferases are hindered, MALAT1 RNA expressions will increase. Following
  upregulation, MALAT1 can recruit PRC2 to the promoters of anti-inflammatory genes
  and epigenetically repress these targets, which will subsequently allow for heightened
  transcription of inflammatory genes. On the contrary, in the dependent pathway (indicated
  by ‘2.’), the MALAT1 transcript and MALAT1 gene may directly interact with inflammatory
  transcripts and inflammatory genes, respectively, to ultimately provoke a greater
  inflammatory response (Me = methylation; EZH2 + SUZ12 + EED + RBAP48 = PRC2 complex
  components; (+) and (−) = feedback loop; 1. = Indirect effect of MALAT1 on inflammation
  via DNA methylation and PRC2 pathways; and 2. = Direct effect of MALAT1 gene activity
  on inflammation and vice versa).
