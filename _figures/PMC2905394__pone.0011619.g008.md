caption: A model depicting the Wg signal transduction pathway is shown. In the pathway
  Dsh, Arm and dTCF act positively while Zw3, Axin, APC and dSno act negatively. Based
  on epistasis data, we propose two possible locations were dSno may be acting (indicated
  as question marks) within the Wg pathway. The first possibility is that dSno cooperates
  with the other antagonistic proteins Zw3, dAxin and APC (representing dAPC1 and
  dAPC2). The second possibility is that dSno blocks Arm activity at a point subsequent
  to the destruction complex and prevents it from regulating Wg target genes. The
  embryonic Wg antagonist Brinker does not inhibit Wg functions during wing development.
