caption: A model to illustrate the intracellular trafficking of IFITM3 and its antiviral
  action. Following its synthesis at the ER, IFITM3 traffics to the plasma membrane
  where its 20-YEML-23 motif interacts with the μ2 subunit of AP-2 complex and undergoes
  clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Ubiquitination of K24 is shown. C71/72/105 are palmitoylated.
  This trafficking mechanism positions IFITM3 on the endocytic pathway that many viruses
  utilize for cell entry. Examples of these viruses are VSV, IAV and EBOV. MLV is
  a pH-independent virus. VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; IAV, influenza A virus;
  EBOV, Ebola virus; MLV, murine leukemia virus. This model is partially adapted from
  those published in (, Diamond et al., 2013, ).
