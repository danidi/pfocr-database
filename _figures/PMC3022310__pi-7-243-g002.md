caption: 'BDNF-activated transduction pathways induce dendritic sprouting. a: BDNF
  binds to tyrosine kinase receptor type-B and induces the dimerization of the receptor.
  b: Binding of BDNF induces TrkB autophosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues
  of the receptor and thus creates binding sites for specific proteins. c: Three main
  intracellular signalling cascades are activated by TrkB: Ras-mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway and
  the PLCg-Ca2+pathway. d: Activation of PLC-g leads to the release of calcium from
  the endoplasmic reticulum and to activation of a calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase
  II (CAMKII), ending in phosphorylation of CREB and activation of transcription.
  Activation of the MAPK pathway can also regulate transcription through phosphorylation
  of CREB. e: Signaling pathways mediate BDNF-promoted modifications of dendritic
  morphology. Simultaneous triggering of the PI3K and MAPK pathways concurrently alters
  both actin and microtubule dynamics and changes downstream dendrite branching.'
