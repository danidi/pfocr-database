caption: The membrane receptor TLR3 recognizes and binds internalized extracellular
  dsRNA only in acidified endosomes, and then activated TLR3 induces type I interferon
  production via interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and proinflammatory cytokine
  generation via the NFκB pathway. The present study identifies Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18
  or CR3) as a novel PRR on the surface of macrophages. Mac-1 senses and binds extracellular
  dsRNA to facilitate the endocytosis of extracellular dsRNA thereby amplifying the
  TLR3-dependent signaling or to activate oxidative enzyme NOX2 to produce ROS thereby
  activating MAPK and NFκB pathways to induce proinflammatory cytokine production
  in a TLR3-independent manner.
