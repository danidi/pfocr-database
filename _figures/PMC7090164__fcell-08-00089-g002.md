caption: Exosome-mediated communication between osteoblasts and osteoclasts Osteoblast-derived
  exosomes containing RANKL could stimulate osteoclast differentiation through binding
  to RANK on the surface of osteoclasts. RNAK-enriched exosomes from osteoclasts competitively
  bind to RANKL and prevent activation of the RANK signaling pathway in osteoclasts.
  miR-214-containing exosomes from osteoclasts could be transferred into osteoblasts
  via ephrinA2/EphA2 recognition to inhibit osteoblast function.
