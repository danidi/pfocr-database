caption: Both VV and CPV stimulate the MEK/ERK/EGR-1 pathway from early until late
  times of viral infective cycle. Upon stimulation, EGR-1 translocates into the nucleus
  where it binds to the regulatory region (EBS) of EGR-1-regulated genes to control
  their expression. Pharmacological (PD98059) and genetic (dominant-negative mutation,
  DN) inhibition of MEK/ERK in conjunction with gene silencing (siEGR1-20) approaches
  demonstrate a distinct requirement of the pathway for viral biology (see right-hand
  box; Un, unaffected). While viral TK gene expression upon pharmacological inhibition
  was equally delayed (D) for both viruses (see left-hand box), viral DNA (vDNA) replication
  was unaffected (Un) only for CPV. A post-replicative event is required (Ara C) for
  CPV- but not for VV-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
