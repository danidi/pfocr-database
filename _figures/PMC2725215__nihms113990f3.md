caption: (A) A lag between checkpoint activation and CDK shutoff allows sufficient
  time for CDK to execute its function in repair before being inactivated by the checkpoint.
  (B) Phosphorylation of substrates involved in HR is constitutive, occurring during
  normal S-phase progression. In the cases illustrated, one substrate (S1) promotes
  HR in its phosphorylated form, whereas the other (S2) must be dephosphorylated after
  CDK activity is turned off by the checkpoint in order to exert a pro-recombinogenic
  effect. (C) Subpathways of CDK activation allow repair of DNA damage in arrested
  cells. Checkpoint activation inhibits the mitotic inducer Cdk1 by up-regulation
  of the kinase Wee1 and down-regulation of the phosphatase Cdc25, leading to increased
  Tyr15 phosphorylation. In this scenario, Cdk2 escapes inhibition because it follows
  a distinct pathway, in which activation by CAK and inhibition by Wee1 are uncoupled.
