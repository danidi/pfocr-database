caption: Inhibition of Hsp90 leads to disruption of regulatory complexes of Hsp90
  with HSF1 and client protein such as mutp53, thereby causing HSF1-mediated induction
  of Hsps such as Hsp70 and up-regulation of MDR1/P-gp, which is responsible for the
  resistance of MDR cells to Hsp90 inhibitor. CCB inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3
  that can up-regulate HSF-1, resulting in reduced resistance against Hsp90 inhibitor
  in MDR cells. Moreover, CCB can promote both apoptotic and autophagic cell death
  through inhibition of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway and down-regulation of Bcl-2/Mcl-1,
  which trigger autophagy-mediated degradation of mutp53.
