caption: Glucose, a key energy metabolite in the brain, is transported across the
  blood-brain barrier (BBB) via endothelial-specific glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1)
  hexose transporter. After uptake by brain cells, glucose undergoes glycolysis followed
  by Krebs cycle and oxidative metabolism providing the fuel for physiological brain
  functions through the generation of high-energy adenosine-3 phosphate (ATP) molecules,
  the foundation for neuronal and non-neuronal cell maintenance and the generation
  of neurotransmitters. On the other hand, glucose surrogate analogs 2DG and FDG,
  although still transported across the BBB via GLUT1 hexose transporter, cannot enter
  the glycolytic pathway or Krebs cycle in brain. After the initial hexokinase step,
  2DG- 6P and FDG-6P get trapped in the brain, because they are not substrates for
  glucose-6P isomerase, which is a necessary metabolic step in the glycolytic pathway.
  Therefore, 2DG and FDG are not metabolized by the glycolytic pathway or Krebs cycle,
  do not generate any ATP energy-donor molecules in brain, and their net metabolic
  rate in brain is zero joules.
