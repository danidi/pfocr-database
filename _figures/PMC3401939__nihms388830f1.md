caption: Targeting of oncogenes and miRNAs by retroviruses. Retroviral infection and
  subsequent integration into the cellular genome can lead to viral excision of a
  transcript through reverse transcriptase-mediated synthesis or overexpression of
  cellular gene critical to cellular tumorigenesis and malignancy. The viral excision
  pathway is responsible for the genesis of viral oncogenes such as v-Src, v-Myc,
  v-Myb, v-Fos, v-Mos, and others, but so far not the precursor to miRNA-encoding
  retroviruses. The tumor formation pathway is often found to target proto-oncogenes
  such as PIM1, LCK1, INT1, as well as the known viral oncogenes. In addition, miRNAs
  appear to be frequently targeted either directly or indirectly by close association
  with retroviral integration events. As the overexpression of miRNAs lead to down-regulated
  expression of presumed tumor suppressor gene targets, these miRNAs can be referred
  to as oncomiRs.
