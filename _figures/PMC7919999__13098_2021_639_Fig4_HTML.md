caption: Integrated stress response (ISR). The ISR signaling pathway initiates when
  distinct stressors activate at least one member of a family of four serine/threonine
  kinases—PERK, PKR, HRI, GCN2, and these activations will converge to induce phosphorylation
  of eIF2a on serine. At least two of the four serine/threonine kinases activated
  by distinct stressors—PKR and PERK—can downregulate the insulin signaling pathway
  through serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates, attenuating insulin
  action. Specifically for COVID-19, fragments of viral RNA can activate PKR, which
  will induce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation and consequently insulin resistance
