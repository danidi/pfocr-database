caption: (A) A subnetwork that illustrates the effect of homocystinuria on the metabolism
  and transport of methionine. Circular nodes represent metabolites and edges represent
  biochemical reactions. For simplicity, only abbreviations of metabolite names and
  enzyme E.C (Enzyme Commission) numbers are specified (explicit names are given in
  ). Metabolites marked in green participate in other reactions that are not presented
  here for simplicity. Homocystinuria is caused by a dysfunctional CBS, and hypermethioninemia
  is caused by dysfunctional AHCY. (B) Prediction of concentration changes of the
  boundary metabolite methionine in homocystinuria and S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
  deficiency based on interval comparison of its exchange reaction's flux. In both
  cases, inferring the elevated concentration of methionine simply based on the network
  topology is impossible, due to the cyclic methionine salvage pathway (involving
  reaction 4.1.1.50), which (though topologically plausible) cannot affect methionine
  concentration due to mass-balance constraints.
