caption: Proposed signaling pathway in brain capillaries. Based on our data presented
  here and our previously published data (–, ), we propose that seizure (Sz)-induced
  release of glutamate signals through the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) which leads to activation
  of cPLA2. This, in turn, leads to release of AA, which COX-2 converts to PGE2, which
  in turn leads to increased P-gp and BCRP protein expression and transport activity
  levels at the blood–brain barrier.
