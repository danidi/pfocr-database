caption: Protein quality control systems are potential targets for mechanism-based
  treatments of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). Genetic mutations
  and increased protein expression levels linked to demyelinating CMT induce misfolding
  of hydrophobic proteins such as peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22), myelin protein
  zero (MPZ), and SIMPLE in Schwann cells (step 1a and 1b). Chaperones at the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and the cytosol refold misfolded PMP22 and MPZ proteins (step 2),
  but when refolding is not possible, these proteins are recognized and retrotranslocated
  to the cytosol by the p97/VCP-dependent ER-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery
  (step 3). In contrast, misfolded SIMPLE is translocated to the cytosol by an ERAD-independent
  mechanism (step 1b). These misfolded proteins are targeted to the 26S proteasome
  by K48-linked poly-ubiquitination for degradation (step 4). When the chaperone and
  proteasome systems are damaged or overwhelmed, misfolded proteins accumulate and
  aggregate into toxic oligomers (step 5) that could inhibit proteasome function (step 6)
  and impair myelination by Schwann cells, leading to demyelinating CMT (step 7).
  The aggresome-autophagy pathway is another protein quality control system in which
  misfolded and aggregated proteins are transported by the microtubule-dependent dynein
  motor complex to the aggresomes (step 8). Aggresomes not only sequester toxic misfolded
  and aggregated proteins but also recruit autophagic membrane for the formation of
  autophagosomes (step 9) and subsequent degradation by lysosomal hydrolases upon
  autophagosome-lysosome fusion (step 10). Therapeutic strategies and currently available
  agents that enhance the targeting of misfolded and aggregated proteins for turnover
  are indicated by the color green (upward arrows), and drugs exacerbating the CMT
  neuropathy phenotype are marked by the color red (downward arrows).
