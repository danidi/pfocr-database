caption: Conceptual model of carbon stable isotope fractionation during the acute
  phase response to an invading pathogen. Invading pathogens activate the innate immune
  response by stimulating tissue macrophage activation., Inflammatory cytokines, such
  as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6, are released into
  circulation. TNF and IL-1 induce catabolism and amino acid release from skeletal
  muscle,,, and stimulate acute phase protein synthesis in the liver.,, Amino acids
  are loaded onto tRNA for protein synthesis in one enzymatic step, or they are metabolized.
  Carbon from metabolized amino acids requires multiple enzymatic steps before being
  released as CO2. During each enzymatic step heavier carbon sources will react more
  slowly due to the kinetic isotope effect. Fractionation of the stable isotope of
  carbon may occur over the entire metabolic pathway, leading to heavier carbon isotopes
  remaining with the body and lighter isotopes being expired in breath CO2.
