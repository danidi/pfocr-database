caption: 'Intrinsic pathway: cancer-associated inflammation. Intrinsic pathway is
  about the formation of cancer microenvironment. The inflammatory cancer microenvironment
  consists of cellular components and non-cellular components. When transformed or
  cancerous cells are established, immune responses are also started. Inflammasomes
  are activated through different mechanisms and release interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and
  interleukin-18 (IL-18) to initiate inflammation. Cancerous cells and stromal cells
  can release chemokines and lead to neutrophil infiltration. Neutrophils will in
  turn secret more proinflammatory cytokines including interleukins and interferons.
  B cells and antibodies are also observable. Regulatory T cells, TAMs, and MDSCs
  work together to enhance immunosuppression. The alteration of proinflammatory cytokines
  will lead to abnormal polarization of T helper cells. The imbalanced T helper cell
  population and cancer-related immune cells facilitate the cancer progression through
  angiogenesis, metastasis, and cancerous resistance against immune attacks. TAM,
  tumor-associated macrophage; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressor cell; CTL, cytotoxic
  lymphocyte.'
