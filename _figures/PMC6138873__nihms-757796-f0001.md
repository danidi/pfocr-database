caption: A model depicting cryptochrome signal transduction mechanisms in Arabidopsis.
  Cryptochromes (CRY) are composed of two domains, the PHR domain and the CCE domain,
  and form homodimers through the PHR domains. Upon blue light activation, CRYs undergo
  conformational changes in both the PHR and CCE domains to transduce signals to downstream
  components. Light-dependent phosphorylation at multiple sites of the CCE domain
  produce negative charges (−) at these sites via autophosphorylation and possibly
  by unknown kinases (Y) in the case of CRY1, and by CK1 and unknown kinases (Z) in
  the case of CRY2. The negative charges result in the electrostatic repulsion of
  CCE domain from PHR domain. In the dark, COP1 and SPA constitute an active complex
  to promote E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading the degradation of transcription
  factors such as HY5 and CO, positive regulaters for de-etiolation and flowering,
  respectively. In the light, photoactivated CRY1 constitutes the CRY1 signaling complex,
  in which CRY1 dissociates COP1 from SPA by direct binding via the CRY1 CCE domain
  to inactivate COP1/SPA complex. This results in the accumulation of HY5 and probably
  CO, and CRY1 binds with unknown factor (X) via the CRY1 PHR domain to activate the
  COP1 independent pathway, to promote primarily de-etiolation. Photoactivated CRY2
  directly binds with SPA via the PHR domain to inactivate COP1/SPA complex by tightening
  the connection between COP1 and CRY2. CRY2 also binds with CIBs through the PHR
  domain to promote flowering. CK1 Casein kinase1, CCE cryptochrome C-terminal extension,

  description: A model depicting cryptochrome signal transduction mechanisms in Arabidopsis.
    Cryptochromes (CRY) are composed of two domains, the PHR domain and the CCE domain,
    and form homodimers through the PHR domains. Upon blue light activation, CRYs
    undergo conformational changes in both the PHR and CCE domains to transduce signals
    to downstream components. Light-dependent phosphorylation at multiple sites of
    the CCE domain produce negative charges (−) at these sites via autophosphorylation
    and possibly by unknown kinases (Y) in the case of CRY1, and by CK1 and unknown
    kinases (Z) in the case of CRY2. The negative charges result in the electrostatic
    repulsion of CCE domain from PHR domain. In the dark, COP1 and SPA constitute
    an active complex to promote E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, leading the degradation
    of transcription factors such as HY5 and CO, positive regulaters for de-etiolation
    and flowering, respectively. In the light, photoactivated CRY1 constitutes the
    CRY1 signaling complex, in which CRY1 dissociates COP1 from SPA by direct binding
    via the CRY1 CCE domain to inactivate COP1/SPA complex. This results in the accumulation
    of HY5 and probably CO, and CRY1 binds with unknown factor (X) via the CRY1 PHR
    domain to activate the COP1 independent pathway, to promote primarily de-etiolation.
    Photoactivated CRY2 directly binds with SPA via the PHR domain to inactivate COP1/SPA
    complex by tightening the connection between COP1 and CRY2. CRY2 also binds with
    CIBs through the PHR domain to promote flowering. CK1 Casein kinase1, CCE cryptochrome
