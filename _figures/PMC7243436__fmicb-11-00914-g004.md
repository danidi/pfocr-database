caption: FA degradation pathway of B. subtilis illustrating the observed changes in
  protein expression in response to both cerulenin addition and rescue of cellular
  growth with exogenous FA supplementation (n16:0 and a15:0). The ΔyusL deletion has
  removed FadN in both cases, yet there appears to be an increase in the amount of
  enzymes preceding the deletion when the cells have been subjected to the FA labeling
  strategy. For locus tag, UniProt Description, log2 change in expression, and p-values
  for each differentially expressed protein (see ).
