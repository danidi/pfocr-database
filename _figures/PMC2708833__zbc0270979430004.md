caption: Role of long-chain acyl-ACP in the biochemical and genetic regulation of
  FAS-II. Membrane phospholipid fatty acids are produced by FAS-II, which is conceptually
  divided into initiation and elongation components. The initiation enzymes, β-ketoacyl-ACP
  synthase III (FabH), which catalyzes the first step in the pathway, and acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (AccABCD), which supplies malonyl-CoA for each condensation step, control
  the number of fatty acids produced and the rate of elongation. The elongation cycles
  of fatty acid biosynthesis process the nascent fatty acid chain into the end products
  of the pathway, which in S. pneumoniae consist primarily of 16:0 and 18:1Δ11 acyl-ACP.
  These acyl-ACPs are used by the PlsXYC acyltransferase system () to generate phosphatidic
  acid, which is the common intermediate used in the formation of membrane phospholipids.
  Long-chain acyl-ACPs biochemically regulate FAS-II by their feedback inhibition
  of FabH () and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (). This study extends the role of acyl-ACP
  to the transcriptional regulation of FAS-II via their binding to FabT, which represses
  the expression of the FAS-II genes by binding of the FabT-acyl-ACP complex to the
  two promoters (P1 and P2) that control expression of the FAS-II gene cluster ().
