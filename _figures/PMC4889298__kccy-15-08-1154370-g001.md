caption: The Role of DNA Double Strand Break and the NHEJ Signaling Pathway in Transcription
  of Inducible Genes. We depict recruitment to gene promoters, by a transcription
  factor dimer, of a complex containing NHEJ proteins including DNA-PK, as well as
  Topoisomerase IIβ and PARP1. Following generation of a DSB in the promoter by Topoisomerase
  IIβ, DNA repair pathways are triggered, resulting in the activation of DNA-PK that
  phosphorylates substrates such as H2AX and Kap1/TRIM28 throughout the transcribing
  gene, permitting RNA elongation by Pol II.
