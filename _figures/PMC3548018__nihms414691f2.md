caption: 'Integrated scheme for MIF expression, signal transduction and regulation
  of glucocorticoid immunosuppression and cell survival. Toll-like receptor agonists
  stimulate MIF production in a MIF allele (CATT5-8)-dependent fashion [, , ] and
  overide glucocorticoid-induced expression of the inhibitor of κB (IκB) [, ]. MIF
  activates a multicomponent receptor comprising two transmembrane proteins: the CD74
  ligand-binding protein and the CD44 signal transducer [, ]. MIF also activates CXCR2
  and CXCR4 dependent chemotactic responses []. MIF signaling leads directly to the
  phosphorylation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase ½ (ERK1/2), with sustained
  phase activation mediated by a c-Jun activation domain binding protein-1 (Jab1)
  dependent pathway []. MIF signaling then upregulates cytoplasmic phospholipase A2
  (cPLA2) activity, which is downregulated by glucocorticoids, leading to arachidonate
  production and prostaglandin E2 release []. Intracellular arachidonate increases
  the post-transcriptional stability of mRNAs for pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as TNF by activating c-jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (pJNK),
  which is suppressed by glucocorticoids. Finally, MIF inhibits glucocorticoid induction
  of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MPK-1), which downregulates the inflammatory response by
  dephosphorylating multiple MAPK family members. MKP-1 targets include MAP kinase-activated
  protein kinase 2, which mediates the degradation of pro-inflammatory mRNAs [, ].
