caption: Factors affecting the viability of dopamine neurons. Relations terminating
  in an arrowhead indicate facilitation, those with double arrowheads indicate mutual
  facilitation, and dashed lines terminating in a bulb indicate inhibition. Though
  still being settled, recent data suggest that alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is neuroprotective
  whereas monoubiquitylated αSyn, aggregated αSyn, and other pathogenic proteins promote
  neurodegeneration. H3 histone deacetylase inhibition (HDACI) increases αSyn, brain
  derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF),
  supporting neuronal synapses (αSyn) and providing trophic support for neurons and
  promoting neurogenesis (BDNF and GDNF). Neurotrophism appears to be facilitated
  by D3 dopamine receptor stimulation. HDACI also inhibits inflammation. Aggregated
  proteins inhibit the proteasome, promote reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial
  dysfunction, inflammation, and apoptosis, and impair neuronal viability. Inhibition
  of the proteasome results in reduced elimination of obsolete proteins, increases
  in aggregated protein species, facilitates apoptosis, and impairs neuronal viability.
  N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation by glutamate promotes neurotoxicity
  and apoptosis. Generation of peroxide radicals by MAOB promotes ROS. ROS and inflammation
  mutually promote each other, and each can induce apoptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  and ROS also mutually promote each other. Impaired mitochondrial respiration through
  inhibition of respiratory chain complexes (I-IV) can produce mitochondrial dysfunction.
  Mitochondrial dysfunction leads to the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential,
  opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and the release of cytochrome
  c and apoptosis inhibiting factor (AIF). Cytochrome c and AIF each independently
  trigger apoptosis. Protective factors against neurodegeneration include GBA, DRD3,
  CALB1, and other gene products. Thus, neurodegenerative processes include pathogenic
  proteins, proteasomal dysfunction, glutamate and other toxic molecules, NMDA receptor
  activation, ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptotic pathway activation, and subsequent
  neuroinflammation, in turn potentially inducing further ROS and apoptosis. Neuroprotective
  factors include GBA, MCCC1, CCDC62, HIP1R, DRD3, CALB1, αSyn, HDACI, BDNF, and GDNF.
  Neuroprotective factors promote while neurodegenerative processes impair the viability
  of the dopamine neuron. Nigral dopamine neurons promote normal motor functioning
  by release of dopamine on striatal D2 receptors, transcribed from the DRD2 gene,
  and reduced D2 stimulation is associated with Parkinson motor features.
