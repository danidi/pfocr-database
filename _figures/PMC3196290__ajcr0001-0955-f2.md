caption: Role of CRAF in the evolution of Whole Chromosome Instability (W-CIN). Our
  investigations have provided evidence for a role of deregulated CRAF in the evolution
  of W-CIN [, ]. This finding came about through studies of impaired activity mutations
  of BRAF that are detected in human cancer and are involved in the cancer phenotype
  through their ability to heterodimerise and transactivate CRAF. It was found that
  deregulated CRAF was involved in driving the evolution of CIN downstream of mutant
  BRAF. However, the consequent deregulation of the MEK/ERK pathway was found not
  to be involved in the emergence of aneuploidy but, rather, was found to be required
  for the growth of aneuploid cells. This discovery fits the previously proposed dual
  model for the evolution of W-CIN (). A number of MEK/ERK-independent effector pathways
  have been proposed previously for CRAF, as indicated, but which one(s) of these
  are involved in the two pathways leading to the evolution of W-CIN are not currently
  known. CRAF is a known effector of oncogenic RAS, and it will be important to assess
  in the future whether the emergence of W-CIN in RAS mutant tumours occurs through
  similar pathways. Our studies also ruled out a role for the most common BRAF mutant,
  V600EBRAF, as a single mutation in the evolution of W-CIN, which fits with the observation
  thatV600E-BRAF does not evidently signal through CRAF [] and with the fact the V600EBRAF
  mutation is primarily linked with CIN-low CRCs []. However, V600EBRAF may function
  as a second oncogene to support growth/survival of aneuploid cells generated by
  the first oncogene/TSG in some types of cancers such as melanoma.
