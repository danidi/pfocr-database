caption: Endosomal and cytosolic DNA sensors and their related signaling pathways.
  Endosomal DNA sensor TLR9 recognizes the CpG DNA of viral origin and recruits MyD88
  leading to activated IRF7 and NF-κB, which mediate induction of type I interferons
  (IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines. RNA pol III transcribes AT-rich double-stranded
  DNA (dsDNA) into 5’-triphosphate double-stranded RNA (5’-ppp-dsRNA), leading to
  the activation of the RIG-I-MAVS signaling pathway. Viral or bacterial DNA can also
  be detected by cGAS and other putative DNA sensors, all reported to activate the
  endoplasmic reticulum residing adaptor protein STING. STING travels from the endoplasmic
  reticulum to the Golgi complex for TBK1-IRF3 and NF-κB activation, triggering the
  production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines. AIM2 and IFI16 detect the viral
  DNA and respond by forming inflammasome by recruiting ASC and caspase-1 in the cytoplasm
  and nucleus. Active inflammasome leads to proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-β and pro-IL-18
  to produce mature cytokines. (AIM2, absent in melanoma 2; cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP;
