caption: Interaction of JC virus (JCV) T-antigen with key growth regulatory pathways.
  JCV large T-antigen (T-Ag) is believed to drive the oncogenic process of malignant
  transformation by associating with several cellular proteins. T-Ag has the capacity
  to interact with two tumour suppressor proteins that regulate cell cycle progression,
  pRb and p53. (A) Under normal physiological conditions, pRb is maintained in a hypophosphorylated
  state and sequesters the S phase specific transcription factor E2F-1, in a pRb:E2F-1
  complex. On JCV infection, T-Ag binds to the pRb protein releasing E2F-1, permitting
  it to induce cellular proliferation by promoting transcription of S phase genes.
  E2F-1 induces p14ARF gene expression, which interferes with the activity of MDM2,
  a negative regulator of p53 protein. Consequently, p53 is stabilised, which would
  inhibit the cell cycle and promote apoptosis (see fig 6 for additional details).
  (B) T-Ag binds to and inactivates p53, which prevents inhibition of the cell cycle
  or apoptosis. (C) T-Ag binds to IRS-1, a key member of the IGF signalling pathway,
  leading to uncoupling of IGF-1R from IRS-1, and its translocation to the nucleus.
  In the nucleus, IRS-1 may be important in Rad51 trafficking and homologous recombination
  directed DNA repair. (D) Finally, T-Ag can be oncogenic by deregulating the Wnt
  signalling pathway. In normal cells, β-catenin levels are regulated by a multiprotein
  complex of GSK3β, Axin-1, and APC, which phosphorylate β-catenin and trigger its
  degradation. On JCV infection, T-Ag binds to β-catenin, leading to its stabilisation,
  and providing a nuclear localisation signal. Once in the nucleus, stabilised β-catenin
  complexes with transcription factors such as TCR/LEF, which stimulates the transcription
  of cell cycle regulatory genes, including c-myc and cyclin D1.
