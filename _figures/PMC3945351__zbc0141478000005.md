caption: Schematic illustration of the autocrine and paracrine effects of WISP2. Adipogenic
  differentiation of mesenchymal precursor cells involves both commitments to the
  adipose lineage with Pparg induction as well as adipose cell differentiation following
  PPARγ activation. WISP2 is both an intracellular and a secreted protein by mesenchymal
  precursor cells. Intracellular WISP2 retains ZFP423, the transcriptional activator
  of Pparg, from entering the nucleus and initiate adipogenic commitment of the precursor
  cells. Secreted WISP2, in an autocrine manner, activates the canonical WNT pathway
  through an unknown cellular signaling pathway involving LRP5/6. This prevents PPARγ
  activation and maintains the precursor cells in an undifferentiated state. This
  effect of WISP2 is antagonized by the canonical WNT inhibitor DICKKOPF-1 (DKK1).
  Thus, WISP2 exerts dual effects in the regulation of adipogenesis. As a secreted
  protein, WISP2 can also target differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, inhibit PPARγ activation,
  and promote a myofibroblast phenotype. WISP2 may also target other peripheral cells,
  but this remains to be demonstrated.
