caption: Proposed model for the signaling pathway mediating NF-κB activation induced
  by C-type lectin receptors. In macrophages, recognition of C. albicans by CLRs leads
  to the phosphorlation of Syk and subsequently activates phospholipase C (PLC) γ2.
  Activated PKCδ can phosphorylate CARD9, which, may lead to the recruitment of BCL10-TRAF6-TAK1.
  TAK1 induces the phosphorylation of IKKα/β, whereas TRAF6 leads to the ubiquitination
  of Nemo. The combination of Nemo ubiquitination and IKKα/β phosphorylation can lead
  to the degradation of IκBα and subsequent NF-κB activation. Ub, ubiquitin.
