caption: Schematic illustration of the apoptosis signaling pathway in Drosophila and
  mammals. The same colors and shapes represent functional homologous in both Drosophila
  melanogaster and mammals. In Drosophila, RHG proteins (Rpr, Hid, and Grim) produced
  by apoptotic stimuli inhibit the function of DIAP1 (Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis
  protein 1). Dark (apaf-1 homologue) forms a complex (apoptosome) with the initiator
  caspase Dronc. Effector caspases DrICE and Dcp-1 are activated by the apoptosome,
  and the activated effector caspases promote cell death. Eiger (Drosophila TNFα ortholog)
  induces the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase)-mediated cell-death pathway through Grindelwald
  (TNF receptor). In mammals, Smac and HtrA2 released from mitochondria block the
  function of IAP (Inhibitor of apoptosis protein). Mitochondria also secretes cytochrome
  c (cyt c), and the apoptosome which is consisted of cyt c, Apaf-1, and pro-caspase-9
  activates effector caspases, such as Caspase-3 and Caspase-7. Cell death via initiator
  caspase-8 requires the activation of death ligands and receptor signaling (TNFα-TNF
  receptor and Fas-Fas ligand). TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α.
