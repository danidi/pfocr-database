caption: SLOB, through inhibitory modulation of SLO, influences dILP release from
  mNSCs and gene expression of to and dilp3. Slob null flies have elevated SLO activity,
  resulting in opposite effects on IIS and gene expression. Arrows denote positive
  regulation, while blunted lines denote negative regulation. Dotted lines denote
  relationships that are still unclear. See text for further details.
