caption: 'The pathways of central metabolism. For glycolysis, only some of the intermediates
  and enzymes of glycolysis are noted. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pyr, pyruvate; PFK,
  phosphofructokinase; TPIA, triosephosphate isomerase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; PDHC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. For acetate metabolism: POXB,
  pyruvate oxidase; PTA-ACKA, phosphotransacetylase-acetate kinase pathway; ACS, AMP-forming
  acetyl-CoA synthetase. The dotted arrows denote the proposed PDHC bypass formed
  by POXB and AMP-ACS. For the TCA cycle: CS, citrate synthase; ACN, aconitase; IDH,
  isocitrate dehydrogenase; 2-KG, 2-ketoglutarate; KGDH, 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase;
  SCSC, succinyl-CoA synthetase complex; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; FUMA, fumarase;
  MDH, malate dehydrogenase; OAA, oxaloacetate. FRD, fumarate reductase, expressed
  under anaerobic conditions, bypasses SDH. For the glyoxylate bypass: ICL, isocitrate
  lyase; MAS, malate synthase; IDHK/P, isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase.
  Underlines and dashed arrows denote enzymes and steps unique to the glyoxylate bypass.
  For gluconeogenesis: PPSA, PEP synthase; PCKA, pyruvate carboxykinase; MAEB and
  SFCA, malic enzymes. Boxes and double-lined arrows denote enzymes and steps unique
  to gluconeogenesis.'
