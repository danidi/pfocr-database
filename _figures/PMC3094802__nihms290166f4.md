caption: The role of Notch signaling pathway in the development and progression of
  cancer, and during the acquisition of EMT phenotype, and the formation of cancer
  stem cells. Natural agents and γ-secretase inhibitors could be useful for targeting
  Notch signaling pathway proteins, which could enhance the efficacy of conventional
  cancer therapies.
