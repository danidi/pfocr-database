caption: (A) Activation of the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway in incubations
  with BL21 or W3110. The schematic shows cytokines (ovals) and cytokine receptors
  (polygons) upregulated only by incubation with BL21 (blue) or only by incubation
  with W3110 (red). Incubations with either E. coli strain (purple) or with no change
  in regulation by either E. coli strain (gray) is also shown. (B) Schematic of genes
  involved in the canonical NF-κB pathway, adapted from the KEGG. Gene expression
  levels upregulated (green) and unaffected (gray) by incubations with both BL21 and
  W3110 compared to expression levels in medium alone are shown.
