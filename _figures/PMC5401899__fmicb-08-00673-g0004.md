caption: Biotic stress pathway analyses of DEGs in A. thaliana during early infection
  by P. brassicae. Analysis of the biotic stress pathway of DEGs was performed using
  MAPMAN software. Red boxes mean up-regulated genes and green mean down-regulated
  genes. (A) 24 h after inoculation; (B) 48 h after inoculation. The pathway frames
  are from the MAPMAN software database.
