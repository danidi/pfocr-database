caption: Potential mechanisms and regulation of insulin-stimulated reactive oxygen
  species in insulin target cells. The generation of cellular reactive oxygen species
  [superoxide (), H2O2] to insulin is coupled to a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase mechanism
  that we have found to involve the recently described catalytic subunit homologue,
  Nox4 (). Superoxide generated by the NADPH oxidase system is potentially converted
  to H2O2 species can play a role in modifying the catalytic activity of thiol-dependent
  regulatory enzymes in the cell, which can then alter by superoxide dismutase (SOD).
  Both of these reactive oxygen both proximal and distal insulin action (). The generation
  of reactive oxygen species by insulin may be enhanced by high glucose conditions,
  which increase mitochondrial superoxide production () and may also activate the
  NADPH oxidase system. Gαi2 may also modulate the activity of the insulin-sensitive
  NADPH oxidase pathway (, ). See text for further discussion. IR, insulin receptor.
