caption: 'Overview of microglial M1 and M2 signaling in neurodegeneration, and potential
  targets for neuroprotection. The left side of the figure compartment shows M1 microglial
  phenotype and its major signaling pathways. LPS binds to TLR4 on the cell surface
  which is coupled to MD2 (TLR/MD2) with participation of co-receptors CD14 and LBP
  (LPS-binding protein), activates interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs)
  through MyD88 and TRIF that causes translocation of transcription factors such as
  NF-κB, STAT5, activator protein-1 (AP1), and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)
  to the nucleus. M1 activation by IFN-γ occurs through IFN-γ receptors 1 and 2 (IFN-γR1/2)
  leading to the recruitment of Janus kinase 1 and 2 (JAK1/2) that phosphorylate and
  translocate STAT1 and IRFs to the nucleus. M1 activation stimulation through granulocyte-macrophage
  colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) occurs when GM-CSF binds to its receptor GM-CSF-R,
  which activates rat sarcoma oncoproteins (RAS), JAK2, and SFK, and causes translocation
  of STAT5 to the nucleus. The translocation of NF-κB, STAT1, STAT5, AP1, and IRFs
  to the nucleus causes upregulation of intracellular iNOS and cell surface markers
  (CD86, CD16/32, MHC-II). M1 stimulation also causes transcriptional upregulation
  of M1-associated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α) and chemokines
  (CCL2, CXCL10). The right side of the figure compartment shows various M2 microglial
  phenotypes and major signaling pathways involved. M2 activation can be classified
  into M2a, M2b, and M2c. M2a state is induced mainly by IL-4. IL-4 binds to IL-4R,
  which stimulates JAK1 or JAK3 that causes translocation of STAT6 to the nucleus
  leading to transcription of M2a-associated genes including IL-10, cell surface markers
  (CD206, scavenger receptors, SRs), and intracellular components such as suppressor
  of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), Ym1 (chitinase-like protein) and Fizz1 (found in
  inflammatory zone). The M2b activation state, which has some M1 response characteristics,
  is stimulated when TLRs fuse Fcγ receptors, which then bind to IgG (B cells) to
  derive the M2b phenotype. M2b activation results in secretion of IL-10 and, cell
  surface markers (CD86, MHC-II). M2c activation is induced by IL-10 which stimulates
  the IL-10 Receptor 1 and 2 subunits that activates JAK1 leading to the translocation
  of STAT3 to the nucleus. STAT3 translocation inhibits M1-associated pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and upregulation of IL-10, TGF-β and the cell surface marker CD206. M2c
  state plays an important role in immunoregulation, matrix deposition and tissue
  remodeling. The bottom half of the figure shows potential therapeutic microglial
  targets for neuroprotection. (1) JAK/STAT inhibition: M1 phenotype is induced via
  the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and inhibition of this pathway may suppress the downstream
  M1-associated pro-inflammatory genes. (2) Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors:
  Histone acetylation is increased in M1 state that may lead to the expression and
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. HDAC inhibitors prevent neurodegeneration
  by shifting microglia toward protective M2 phenotype and anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
  (3) Microglia-produced high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) inhibitors: HMGB1 is a
  pro-inflammatory cytokine released by microglia which is toxic to neurons. HMGB1
  inhibitors show neuroprotection by binding to HMGB1 and inhibiting its cytokine-like
  activity. (4) Alteration of M1/M2 balance: These agents promote the shift M1 pro-inflammatory
  phenotype toward protective M2 phenotype, and also exhibit neuroprotection by counteracting
  excessive pro-inflammatory M1 cytokines. (5) Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) activators: AMPK activators act by inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and iNOS by reducing NF-κB activation. (6) Peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor (PPAR) agonists: PPAR agonists exhibit neuroprotection by upregulating
  AMPK and protective genes, reducing oxidative damage, maintaining mitochondrial
  function and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. (7) Glycogen synthase kinase-3 β (GSK3β)
  inhibitors: GSK3β regulate microglial migration, inflammation, and neurotoxicity
  through astrocytes. GSK3β inhibitors decrease inflammation by reducing iNOS expression
  and release of nitric oxide (NO). (8) Endocannabinoid system targets: Agents that
  target the endogenous cannabinoid ligands anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol
  (2-AG) increase TGF-β, arginase 1 and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor
  (GDNF), and reduce iNOS and COX-2, expression. AICAR, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide
