caption: Proposed diagrams depicting effect of EACG on cell cycle, MAP kinases, and
  apoptosis signaling pathway. The modification of secondary metabolites of AC was
  induced by co-incubation with ginger. The interplay between these signaling networks
  at different cellular levels results in the ability of EACG to induce subG1/G2M
  arrest and apoptosis in Huh-7 cells.
