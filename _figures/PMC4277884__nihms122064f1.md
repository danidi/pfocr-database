caption: 'Red lines represent the metabolic cycle for complete acetyl-CoA oxidation
  including the glyoxylate shunt enzymes, which are shaded orange. This pathway is
  expected to increase fatty acid degradation by decreasing malonyl-CoA levels. The
  gray dashed lines represent alternative pathways, which include acetyl-CoA incorporation
  into oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis and malonyl-CoA for lipid biosynthesis, as
  well as the part of TCA cycle that is bypassed. The dashed green line represents
  allosteric inhibition. Abbreviations: PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase, CPT1a: carnitine
  palmitoyltransferse-1a, PEPCK: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, ME1: cytosolic
  malic enzyme.'
