caption: Schematic of a model for action of DOX within key signaling pathways necessary
  for LTF. The model is adapted and simplified from the previous model of  with the
  addition of the p38 MAPK pathway and the effects of DOX. p38 MAPK suppresses LTF
  via CREB2 activation. ERK plays a key role in the induction of LTF via inactivation
  of CREB2. 5-HT activates PKA and ERK and inhibits p38 MAPK, which in turn favors
  the expression of C/EBP and induction of LTF. DOX has dual effects on synaptic plasticity.
  It leads to activation of both p38 MAPK and ERK, at least in part, by inhibiting
  the expression of MKP1. The balance between p38 MAPK and ERK activation determines
  whether CREB2 is sufficiently inactivated for the expression of C/EBP. Arrows represent
  activation; balls represent inhibition.
