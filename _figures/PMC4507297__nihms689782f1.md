caption: Glucose is metabolized via the EMP pathway to AcCoA in an NAD+-dependent
  manner. GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase.
  The AcCoA interconverted with amino acids and fatty acids. It replenishes the NAD+-dependent
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It is the substrate for most secondary metabolites
  and it is the acetyl donor for some lysine acetylations, such as the PAT-dependent
  acetylation of ACS (acCoA synthetase). Acetate dissimilation requires the Pta-AckA
  pathway. The enzyme PTA (phosphotransacetylase) converts AcCoA and inorganic phosphate
  (Pi) into coenzyme A (CoA) and the high-energy pathway intermediate AcP. AcP can
  donates its phosphoryl group to certain two-component response regulators (RR).
  AcP also can donate its acetyl group to hundreds of proteins. The enzyme ACKA (acetate
  kinase) converts AcP and ADP to acetate and ATP. The acetate freely diffuses across
  the cell envelope into the environment. Acetate assimilation requires the high-affinity
  enzyme ACS. In a two-step process that involves an enzyme-bound intermediate (acAMP),
  Acs converts acetate, ATP, and CoA into AMP, pyrophosphate (PPi), and acCoA. ACS
  activity is inhibited by acetylation of a conserved lysine catalyzed by the lysine
  acetyltransferase (PAT, also known as YfiQ and Pka).Reactivation is catalyzed by
  the NAD+-dependent deacetylase CobB. Adapted from (Hu et al., 2010).
