caption: The conditional reprogramming (CR) culture system and the potential molecular
  mechanisms of CR. A, The CR co‐cultures patient‐derived primary normal or tumor
  cells with irradiated Swiss‐3T3‐J2 mouse fibroblasts (served as feeder cells) in
  the medium containing F medium (FM)/conditioned medium (CM), Y‐27632 (Rho‐associated
  kinase [ROCK] inhibitor), and optional components (ie, collagen solution, poly‐l‐ornithine
  solution, B‐27, R‐spondin‐1, N‐2 supplement, etc; the optional components are adjusted
  to specific cultures). The J2 feeder cells can produce diffusible factors (eg, murine
  hepatocyte growth factor [mHGF] and heparin‐binding epidermal growth factor [HBEGF])
  and extracellular matrix (eg, collagen, laminin, glycoproteins, interstitial procollagens,
  etc) which may promote the proliferation, growth, and attachment of the cultured
  conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs).,  B, Potential signaling pathways involved
  in the CR process. Under CR condition, β‐catenin is activated in a protein phosphatase
  2A (PP2A)‐dependent manner (noncanonical β‐catenin pathway). The activated β‐catenin,
  upon nuclear translocation, stimulates an increase in transcripts such as Axin2,
  CD44, and c‐Myc that are important for maintaining the adult stem‐like state of
  CRCs. Meanwhile, the mTOR signaling is activated in CRCs, which is found to significantly
  reduce Akt activity. Treated with ROCK inhibitor (Y‐27632), the TGF‐β/SMAD pathway
  and noncanonical NOTCH signaling can be blocked. As a result, the differentiation
  of CRCs is inhibited, whereas the stemness of them is maintained. Moreover, the
  J2 feeder cells could secrete diffusible factors such as mHGF and HBEGF that may
  activate MET, EGFR, and VEGFR signaling.,  Regarding protein expression, the cultured
  CRCs express an elevated level of hTERT, cell cycle‐related proteins (Cyclin A/E,
  MCM4, and PCDK1), and stem cell markers (p63, CD44, CD29, and CD49f), whereas they
  express inactivated pRB, p16INK4A, p21, and DAPK1., ,  As a result, the potential
  mechanisms of CR technology may rely on the interaction of these genes and signals
  to promote cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and differentiation, and maintain
  unlimited proliferative capacity, thereby allowing the culture of patient‐derived
  primary cells. It is noteworthy that the current exploration of CR mechanisms is
  very limited, and almost all are based on the scenario of normal epithelial cell
  culture. More in‐depth investigations are needed in the future.
