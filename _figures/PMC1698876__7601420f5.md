caption: Local NMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+signaling in CaMKII translocation. (A) In
  wild-type neurons, stimulation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) leads to an increase in
  [Ca2+]i directly (i), as Ca2+ ions enter via the receptor to form a locally restricted
  Ca2+ hot-spot beneath the NMDAR channel mouth and indirectly (ii) as NMDAR activation
  triggers other Ca2+ sources. Consequently, CaMKII is translocated to the PSD (a)
  where it can directly interact with and bind to the NMDAR (b) in a process favored
  by phosphorylation at residue T286. The translocation is reversible and CaMKII dissociation
  from the PSD (c) is furthered by inhibitory autophosphorylation. (B) In cells with
  Ca2+-impermeable NMDARs the path (i) is defective and CaMKII translocation (a) is
  possibly counterbalanced by pathways (b) and (c). The wild-type phenotype can, therefore,
  be rescued either by the autophosphorylation-mimicking CaMKII mutant T286D, which
  strengthens interaction (b), or by the inhibitory autophosphorylation-deficient
  mutant TT305/306VA, which weakens pathway (c).
