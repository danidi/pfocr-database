caption: JNK signaling enhances the compensatory proliferation of the neighboring
  cells, stem cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs). In response to stress signals, activated
  JNK induces the release of Wnt/BMP and IL-6 from the stressed cells in which an
  apoptotic response might be initiated but not yet completed, thus inducing a state
  of “undead” cells. The released Wnt/BMP and IL-6 interact with Fz and JAK complexes,
  respectively, on the surface of the neighboring cells, stem cells or CSCs, which
  is followed by the activations of the β-catenin/TCF and Stat3 signaling pathways
  in these cells. Both β-catenin/TCF and Stat3 are capable of enhancing the expression
  of the genes such as CCND1, OCT4, Sox2, KLF4, c-Myc, CD44, and others that are important
  for the cell proliferation and self-renewal of the stem cells or CSCs. There is
  a reciprocal positive feedback between Stat3 and JNK signaling in the non-stressed
  neighboring cells or stem cells. Alternatively, JNK can affect Stat3 through the
  suppression of Hpo/Wts (MST/LATS in mammals) to alleviate Yki (YAP in mammals) that
  can induce Stat3 through IL-6 signaling. Similarly, in addition to the regulation
  of the β-catenin/TCF pathway, the Wnt signaling can regulate the cell growth of
  stem cells by suppressing Notch, a repressor of c-Myc and other cell cycle genes.
  Circled arrow indicates a group of genes important for the self-renewal of the stem
  cells or CSCs.
