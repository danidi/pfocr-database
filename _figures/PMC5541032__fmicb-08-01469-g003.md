caption: Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Zika virus (ZIKV) and strategies
  to limit it. (A) General ADE mechanism. (1) FcγRs are receptors present on the surface
  of various immune cells. Binding of antibody along with ZIKV results in (2) internalization
  of immune complexes into cells, (3) a reduction of IL12, TNFα, and IFNγ expression
  levels, and (4) increased levels of IL6 and IL12 (5). IL10 acts in an autocrine
  manner and binds to its own receptor (6), inhibiting the JAK-STAT pathway (7), which
  leads to reduced IRF1 production (8) and reduced IFN-stimulated response element
  (IRF1) production, resulting in decreased nitric oxide production. Nitric oxide,
  a diffusible radical antimicrobial and anti-viral, is reduced (9), which results
  in an increase in the number of infectious virus particles (10) IFNα/β are inhibited
  (11), diffuse out from the cell (12), and bind to their own receptors to reduce
  JAK-STAT signaling. (B) Antibodies engineered to prevent ADE (12) Engineered antibodies
  having LALA mutations in their Fc region are able to neutralize virus but fail to
  bind to FcγRs, thus preventing ADE.
