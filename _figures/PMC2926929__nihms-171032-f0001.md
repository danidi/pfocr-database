caption: 'Composite phospholipid metabolic pathways derived from in vitro and in vivo
  investigations. [] EPA/DHA supplementation may affect: 1) plasma content of LPC
  and the pathway(s) leading to its synthesis; 2) plasma content of LPA and the pathway(s)
  leading to its synthesis. The dashed line to autotaxin indicates that the potential
  for aspirin to inhibit this pathway. LPP (lipid phosphate phosphatase) and acylglycerol
  kinase (AGK) regulate the balance of LPA and monoacylglycerol.'
