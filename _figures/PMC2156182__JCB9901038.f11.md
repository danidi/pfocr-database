caption: 'Model depicting proposed roles of PTEN, Shc, and FAK in integrin- and growth
  factor–mediated cell motility. Integrin and growth factors can collaboratively or
  separately stimulate the Shc-MAP kinase pathway. Integrin receptor engagement with
  fibronectin stimulates both FAK and Shc phosphorylation, and each initiates a distinct
  downstream signaling pathway activating either persistent movement or random migration;
  these pathways are additive. PTEN inhibits integrin-mediated FAK and Shc phosphorylation
  by direct dephosphorylation, thereby inhibiting cell migration and spreading. This
  model depicts at least two pathways for downstream regulation of cell migration
  in U-87MG cells: one involving Shc to a MAP kinase pathway producing random motility
  and the other a FAK to p130Caspathway involving directional migration. For activation
  of the Shc random motility pathway, the contributions of integrins compared with
  serum growth factors were estimated to be roughly 40 versus 60% in these cells,
  as determined by a putative integrin-specific Shc mutant. It should also be noted,
  however, that higher levels of FAK overexpression can activate FAK and affect the
  Shc pathway in 293 cells as described (, and this study; dashed lines). Summation
  of these regulatory processes controls the speed and the directionality of cell
  migration.'
