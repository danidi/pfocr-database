caption: Schematic illustration showing the main cascade of molecules in cardiomyocytes
  subjected to ischemia/reperfusion insult and the mechanism of acacetin effects.
  Cardiomyocytes suffering from hypoxia/reoxygenation induces oxidative stress and
  triggers ROS production that induces inflammation and apoptosis via releasing the
  pro-inflammatory cytokines TLR-4 and IL-6 which increase the apoptotic proteins
  Bax and cleaved caspase-3, and decrease anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 and anti-apoptotic
  protein Bcl-2. Acacetin activates Nrf2 by stimulating AMPK, and increasing HO-1,
  SOD1, and SOD2, thereby conferring protection to cardiomyocytes against hypoxia/reoxygenation
  insult by reducing ROS production and inhibiting inflammation and apoptosis.
