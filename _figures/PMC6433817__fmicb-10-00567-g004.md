caption: Some possible interactions between fungal cell regulatory hierarchies that
  could respond to oxidants and chemical stresses. The YAP1 pathway is as outlined
  in . Sensory histidine kinases (HK) signal to the stress-activated MAPK Hog1 via
  the phosphorelay Ypd1 and response regulator (RR) Ssk1. The mode of action of the
  fungicide fludioxonil could suggest a mechanism for sensing natural chemical signals.
  The Class VI HK, Sln1, a transmembrane protein, senses osmotic stress but has not
  been shown to respond to oxidants, while a different HK has this role in fission
  yeast. The long arrow to Hog1 in the left side indicates direct activation of Hog1
  via reactive cysteines, as shown for nitrosative stress in Candida albicans ();
  overexpression of the phosphatase Ptp2 was shown to provide resistance to fludioxonil
  (). See text for more details.
