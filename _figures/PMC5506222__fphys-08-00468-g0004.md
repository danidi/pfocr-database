caption: 'Schematic model showing AA sensing signaling pathways that might modulate
  neuronal activity of central olfactory areas. (A) Three electrogenic transporters
  (SLC6A15, SLC38A2, and SLC1A5) and one non-electrogenic antiporter SLC7A5/SLC3A2
  are observed in the OB and the PC. AAs fluxes depend on physiological needs, on
  the importance of transported AAs (essential or non-essential), and on the cellular
  gradient of AAs. When leucine (Leu) and glutamine (Gln) are highly available, they
  are co-transported with sodium inside the cell through SLC6A15, SLC38A2 or SLC1A5.
  Intracellular Gln is in turn co-exchanged with Leu via the bidirectional antiporter
  SLC7A5/SLC3A2. The anterior PC (APC) detects essential AA deficiency that increases
  uncharged tRNA and activates the general amino acid control non-derepressible 2
  (GCN2) pathway. The concomitant down regulation of GABAA receptor and KCC2 transporter
  disinhibits the APC that send messages to nutritional brain areas in order to stop
  eating the imbalanced diet. Signaling proteins of the mammalian target of rapamycin
  complex1 (mTORC1) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathways are also present
  in olfactory areas, which suggests that these structures could also be implicated
  in detecting AA abundancy or scarcity and indirectly modulating food intake. (B)
  Two AA receptors are described: T1R1/T1R3, and CasR receptors. Both are G-protein-coupled
  receptors and AA binding activates heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins composed
  of α-gustducin (Gα) and Gβγ subunits (brown and pink arrows). Gαpromotes phosphatidylinositol
  phosphate 2 (PIP2) activation of phospholipase C (PLC), leading to the production
  of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (D). IP3 opens ion channels
  on the endoplasmic reticulum, releasing Ca2+ into the cytosol of cells. Depending
  on the specific ion channels present on the membrane, a cell could be depolarized
  after melastatin-related transient receptor potential (TRPM5) channel opening or
  could be hyperpolarized after Na+ channel closure (red line) or Ca2+-dependent-K+
  channel opening (blue arrow). AAs: hexagons; activation: blue arrow, inhibition:
  red line. Direct and indirect action of one molecule: full and dotted line respectively.'
