caption: (A) Activation of postsynaptic EphA4 receptors by astrocytic expressed ephrin
  A3 leads to a cofilin-dependent early phase of spine elongation and synaptic reorganization,
  which is followed by dendritic spine elimination via inhibition and disassembly
  of an integrin signaling complex consisting of Cas, FAK and Pyk2 (; ; ). Furthermore,
  EphA4-induced signaling through Cdk5, ephexin 1 and RhoA is required for ephrin
  A1 induced spine loss (). (B) Astrocytes also participate in activity-dependent
  phagocytosis and elimination of retinogeniculate synapses during development, which
  requires the MEGF10- and MERTK-dependent phagocytic pathways (). (C) Microglia-released
  C1q targets dendritic spines for elimination through the classical complement pathway.
  C1q triggers cleavage of C3 to C3b, which leads to CR3-dependent phagocytic removal
  by microglia (; ; ; ). In addition to CR3, microglia express the fractalkine receptor
  (CX3CR1), which is vital for the engulfment of synaptic material and pruning of
  dendritic spines by microglia ().
