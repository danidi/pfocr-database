caption: ATM/ATR pathways regulate HR and NHEJ in response to oxidative DNA damage.
  DSBs can be resected by DNA nuclease, generating RPA-coated ssDNA. Rad51-coated
  flaments invade the homologous strand and strand synthesis continues to form the
  D loop. The Double Holliday junctions are resolved to generate crossover or non-crossover
  products. The Ku complex (KU70/Ku80) is bound to both DSB ends with the absence
  of homologous chromosome in the NHEJ pathway. The Ku complex is also regulated by
  ATM/ATR. Subsequently, the DSB ends are processed by the catalytic subunits of DNA-PK
  (DNA-PKcs) and the broken ends of DSB are fnally ligated. The MRN complex at the
  site of DSB may be phosphorylated by ATM/ATR, whereas ATM may also regulate Rad51
