caption: Reconstruction of AraR regulons in Clostridium species. (A) Metabolic context
  of the reconstructed clostridial AraR regulons. Matching colors are used to mark
  components of three distinct pathways related to arabinose metabolism. The AraR
  regulon members predicted in this work are in red boxes. (B) Maximum likelihood
  phylogenetic tree and inferred DNA recognition motifs of the AraR regulator. The
  AraR regulon was reconstructed in this work for the nine Clostridium genomes marked
  in red. The known AraR-binding motif in B. subtilis is also shown. (C) Genomic organization
  of the araR-containing loci and AraR-regulated genes in Clostridium genomes. Genes
  (shown by arrows) from the same metabolic pathway are marked in matching colors.
  The araR genes and candidate AraR-binding sites are shown by red arrows and circles,
  respectively. The predicted araK gene is marked by asterisks.
