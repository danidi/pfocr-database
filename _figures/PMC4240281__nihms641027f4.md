caption: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression is regulated by signalling
  pathways that can cooperate to induce full EMT responses. In addition to promoting
  EMT through SMAD proteins, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) can activate the
  PI3K–AKT, ERK MAPK, p38 MAPK and JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. TβRI phosphorylates
  the adaptor protein SRC homology 2 domain-containing-transforming A (SHCA), which
  creates a docking site for growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2) and son
  of sevenless (SOS) and initiates the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK pathway. TGFβ-induced
  p38 MAPK and JNK activation results from the association of TNF receptor-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6) with the TGFβ receptor complex, which activates TGFβ-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1) and p38 MAPK and JNK as a result. Several growth factors that act
  through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including epidermal growth factor (EGF),
  fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF), can induce EMT. The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK MAPK signalling cascade
  represents a major pathway that is activated by RTKs in response to growth factors.
  Once activated ERK1 and ERK2 MAPK can facilitate EMT by increasing the expression
  of EMT transcription factors and regulators of cell motility and invasion, such
  as RHO GTPases and the 90 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Other signalling pathways,
  such as the WNT, Notch and Hedgehog (HH) pathways, also participate in EMT. WNT
  signalling promotes EMT by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) to stabilize
  β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus to engage the transcription factors
  lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF) and T cell factor (TCF) and promote a gene
  expression programme that favours EMT. In HH signalling, glioma 1 (GLI1) can induce
  SNAIL1 expression, and the intracellular domain of Notch can activate SNAIL2 expression;
  thus HH and Notch signalling promote a decrease in epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin)
  levels. The cell microenvironment also regulates EMT. During inflammation and in
  cancer, interleukin-6 (IL-6) can promote EMT through Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-induced SNAIL1 expression. Hypoxia in the
  tumour environment can promote EMT through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α),
  which activates the expression of TWIST. EMT responses can be increased through
  crosstalk and cooperation between distinct pathways. For example, RTK- or integrin-induced
  AKT activation can induce SNAIL expression through nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and
  stabilize SNAIL and β-catenin by inhibiting GSK3β , thus cooperating with WNT signalling.
  TGFβ signalling can also increase EMT responses initiated by growth factors such
  as FGF or EGF. ECM, extracellular matrix; FZD, frizzled; ILK, integrin-linked kinase;
  MKK, MAPK kinase; mTORC2, mammalian TOR complex 2; Notch-IC , intracellular fragment
