caption: High concentrations of photofrin-derived singlet oxygen triggers the generation
  of cell-derived singlet oxygen, catalase inactivation and intercellular ROS-dependent
  apoptosis signaling through the NO/peroxynitrite and HOCl signaling pathway. (A)
  Tumor cells have activated NOX1 that generates extracellular superoxide anions (#1).
  The resultant H2O2 (#2) is decomposed by membrane-associated catalase and thus HOCl
  signaling is prevented. NO synthase (NOS) generates NO (#3) which is either oxidated
  by membrane-associated catalase (#4) or reacts with superoxide anions and forms
  peroxynitrite (#5) that is decomposed by catalase. Oxidation of NO and decomposition
  of peroxynitrite by catalase prevent NO/peroxynitrite signaling. (B) Singlet oxygen
  derived from high concentrations of illuminated photofrin (#1) inactivates a substantial
  number of catalase molecules on the surface of the tumor cell (#2). Thus, H2O2 and
  peroxynitrite are not decomposed locally and form singlet oxygen (#3) which inactivates
  further catalase molecules (#4). (C) As a result of (B), the surface of the tumor
  cell carries a sufficiently high number of inactivated catalase molecules (#2) besides
  residual active catalase (#1). As a consequence, superoxide anions derived from
  NOX1 (#3) dismutate and form H2O2 (#4) that is no longer decomposed by catalase
  and drives peroxidase (POD)-catalyzed HOCl synthesis (#5). HOCl reacts with superoxide
  anions (#6), thereby generating hydroxyl radicals that cause lipid peroxidation
  (#7) and subsequent apoptosis induction through the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis.
  NO synthase (NOS) generates NO (#8) that is not oxidated by inactived catalase (#9)
  and forms peroxynitrite after its reaction with superoxide anions (#10). As peroxynitrite
  is not decomposed, protonation of peroxynitrite results in the formation peroxynitrous
  acid (#11) that generates NO2 and hydroxyl radicals that cause lipid peroxidation
  (LPO) and apoptosis induction (#12).
