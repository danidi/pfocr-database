caption: '‘Lateral inhibition’ and ‘asymmetric cell division’ category genes with
  interactions are displayed as a network map. Genes are shown as nodes (node shape/colour
  denotes phenotype: gain, red circle; loss, green circle; both gain and loss, yellow
  circle; socket or hair duplication, blue triangle; completely lethal, black diamond;
  control genes with no phenotype in gain, loss, socket or duplication categories,
  white circle; positive control genes, bold outline), and relationships between nodes
  as edges (edge colour denotes interaction type: genetic, blue; interolog, green;
  yeast two-hybrid, orange; other, grey). MCODE-identified complexes are outlined
  in grey and rank is indicated. Enlargements of positive control complexes for the
  Notch pathway and asymmetric cell division are shown.'
