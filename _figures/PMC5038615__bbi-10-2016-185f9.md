caption: 'Pathways of brassinosteroide synthesis and signaling.Notes: (A) Brassinosteroide
  synthesis uses the precursor compound campesterol, which is derived from the MAD
  pathway. Two major routes are shown leading to the formation of the bioactive brassinosteroids
  castasterone and brassinolide. For further details, see text. The arrows are colored
  according to the species in which the enzymes were found (). Expression of the identified
  genes in tomato is shown as explained in . (B) The components involved in brassinosteroid
  signaling are presented as interaction scheme. Enzyme activities not expressed by
  any orthologue gene in Arabidopsis or tomato are indicated in gray. D2 and D11 were
  only detected in O. sativa and DDWF1 was identified in Pisum sativum.Abbreviations:
