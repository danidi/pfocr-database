caption: Schematic model showing the events occurring in B cells latently infected
  with KSHV in the context of angiogenin and the consequences of silencing angiogenin
  or inhibiting PLCγ activation by neomycin. In BCBL-1 cells, LANA-1 expression induces
  ANG, which activates the PLCγ, ERK, and AKT pathways. PLCγ activation is required
  for the nuclear translocation of ANG. The present study shows that in the nucleus,
  LANA-1 interacts with ANG and p53 and forms a complex. There are also other complexes
  consisting of ANG-p53, LANA-1-p53, and LANA-1-ANG. These interactions suppress p53
  functions, leading to enhanced cell survival and latency maintenance. When ANG is
  silenced or its nuclear transport via PLCγ activation is inhibited by neomycin treatment,
  AKT signaling is decreased while the ERK pathway is unaffected. ANG's nuclear translocation
  is inhibited, which results in decreased LANA-1 expression; decreased interactions
  between LANA-1-ANG-p53, LANA-1-p53, ANG-p53, and LANA-1-ANG, leading to the activation
  of p53; and increased detection of p53 free of ANG and LANA-1 in the cytoplasm,
  resulting in the induction of apoptosis, KSHV lytic cycle, and cell death.
