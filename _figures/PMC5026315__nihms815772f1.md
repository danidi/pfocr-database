caption: Complement activation is initiated by three pathways (green), converging
  toward activation of C3, which is further amplified in a positive feed-back loop
  (blue). The terminal complement pathway (purple) is activated upon the formation
  of C5 convertases that cleave C5. The underlined components attach covalently to
  target.
