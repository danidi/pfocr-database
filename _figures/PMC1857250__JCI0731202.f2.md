caption: (A) Natural Tregs arise in the thymus under homeostatic conditions, through
  the integration of a myriad of local thymic factors. Thymically derived natural
  Tregs defend against autoimmunity. (B) Adaptive Tregs arise in the periphery (outside
  the thymus), either from natural Tregs receiving additional signals or through an
  independent pathway. Both natural and adaptive Tregs might contribute to tumor immunopathology.
  CTLA4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4.
