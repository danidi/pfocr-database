caption: Exploiting the synthetic lethal relationship between PArP1 and BrCA1/2 for
  the targeted treatment of HR-deficient human tumors. HR can serve as a backup DNA
  repair pathway to resolve DSBs resulting from replication fork collapse. (A) In
  normal cells, base modifications are repaired using base excision repair prior to
  S-phase entry. (B) Pharmacological inhibition of the base excision repair component
  PARP1 results in unrepaired SSBs, which collapse replication forks into DSBs during
  S-phase. The newly synthesized sister chromatid can serve as a template for HR-mediated
  repair in BRCA1/2-proficient cells. In BRCA1/2-deficient cancer cells HR-mediated
  repair of PARP inhibitor-induced DSBs in not available. Instead, error-prone repair
  pathways, such as NHEJ and SSA are utilized, which results in progressive genomic
  instability and ultimately cell death.
