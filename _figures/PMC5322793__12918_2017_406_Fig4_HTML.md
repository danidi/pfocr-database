caption: IRF7 gene expression circuit. a In viral infected cells IRF7 gene expression
  is induced after IFN stimulation by the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The IRF7 promoter
  activation is governed by the binding of IRF7 dimer and ISGF3 to the promoter DNA
  binding sites (ISRE and IRFE). IRF7 promoter activation leads to the transcription
  of IRF7 mRNA and subsequent its translation to produce the IRF7 protein. Notice
  that the IRF7 production and subsequently phosphorylation and dimerization leads
  to the binding to its own DNA binding site, resulting in the production of more
  IRF7, making in this way a positive feedback loop. b A simplified system representing
  the IRF7 gene expression dynamics is given. Here, the promoter transitions between
  active/basal states (Pa/Po), the gene transcription and translation processes are
  represented as solid black lines as well as the feedback loop in the system
