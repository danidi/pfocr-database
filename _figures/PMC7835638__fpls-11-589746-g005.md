caption: A diagram showing glucosinolate metabolism and heat map of related genes
  in 6-day-old sprouts under red or blue light at the 16h-light/8h-dark regime. Three
  biosynthetic processes including (I) chain elongation, (II) core structure formation,
  and (III) side-chain secondary modification were illustrated. The light green part
  is for the synthesis of aliphatic glucosinolate, and the pink part is for the synthesis
  of indolic glucosinolate. The SUR1 and UGT74B1 in blue font represent genes function
  in both aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways. The solid arrows
  represent the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway, the dash arrow is for unknown
  pathway, and the asterisks (*) represent the significantly differentially expressed
  genes in HHR (vs. HHB). HHR, Chinese kale sprouts under red and blue light at the
  ratio of 10:0; HHB, Chinese kale sprouts under red and blue light at the ratio of
  0:10. The gene expression data were from libraries of HHR and HHB, each library
  containing three biological replicates.
