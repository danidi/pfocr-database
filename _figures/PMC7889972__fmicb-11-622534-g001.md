caption: Metabolic remodeling designed to reduce oxidative damage. In antibiotic treatments,
  dysfunction of TCA cycle and hyperactivation of cell respiration lead to ROS accumulation
  in bacteria. Defense against ROS can be achieved by metabolic remodeling. Reduced
  endogenous ROS formation can be achieved by upregulation of the glyoxylate shunt,
  which bypasses two NADH-generating steps. Replenishment of antioxidants can be achieved
  by rerouting metabolism toward the pentose phosphate pathway and enhancing production
  of cofactor NADPH. Also, ketoacids, including pyruvate and α-ketoglutarate, can
  mitigate oxidative damage via non-enzymatic decarboxylation in the presence of numerous
  carbon sources. G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; G6DPH, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
