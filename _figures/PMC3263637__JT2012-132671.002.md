caption: 'Effects of metals on the PLC signaling pathway at presynaptic terminal (green:
  activation/increase, red: inhibition/decrease). The PLC system consists of GPCRs
  coupled to Gq, which activate PLC, which activates DAG and IP3. IP3 increases intracellular
  calcium ([Ca2+]i) and activates DOC2 and synaptotagmin which leads to increased
  evoked release and readily releasable pool size. DAG activates PKC, which activates
  voltage-gated calcium channels. PKC phosphorylates Munc-18, which negatively regulates
  vesicle fusion and syntaxin. PKC activation leads to the increased spontaneous and
  evoked neurotransmitter release. The effects of metals on this pathway are shown
  in this figure where a green color indicates an activation/upregulation and a red
  color indicates an inhibition/downregulation.'
