caption: This pathway centres on the ZEB1-dependent synthesis, storage and use of
  long-chain PUFAs, which are susceptible to becoming reactive lipid peroxides through
  the action of lipoxygenase enzymes. GPX4 dissipates these reactive peroxides and
  prevents their downstream iron-dependent reactions that ultimately result in ferroptotic
  cell death. Red text denotes chemical perturbations used to probe and uncover this
  circuitry; blue text denotes genetic perturbations that have been carried out. ACSL4,
  acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4; ALOX, arachidonate lipoxygenase;
  ALOXi, ALOX inhibitor; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; GPX4, glutathione peroxidase
  4; LPCAT3, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3; sec-tRNA, selenocyteine tRNA;
  TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β; ZEB1, zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1.
