caption: Canonical Notch signaling with points of intervention of current therapies.
  The interaction between Delta/Jagged-type ligands and Notch receptors leads to S2
  cleavage on the extracellular site by “a disintegrin and metalloprotease” 10 (ADAM10)
  or ADAM17, which is followed by S3 cleavage by the γ-secretase–presenilin complex.
  The S3 cleavage gives rise to an intracellular Notch fragment (NICD) that translocates
  into the nucleus, where NICD binds to a protein complex containing recombination
  signal-binding protein Jκ (RBP-Jκ). This mediates the conversion of RBP-Jκ from
  a repressor to a transcriptional activator and is followed by the recruitment of
  the co-activator mastermind-like 1 (MAML1). These events lead to the de-repression
  of transcription of hairy/enhancer of split (Hes) and Hey. Several stages of the
  Notch signaling pathway are prone to pharmacological intervention and are labeled
  in the figure. Gamma-secretase inhibitors and blocking antibodies are already in
  clinical trials and decoys have been tested in animal models. Peptide inhibitors
  represent potential future treatment modalities. NECD, Notch extracellular domain;
  NTM, Notch transmembrane domain.
