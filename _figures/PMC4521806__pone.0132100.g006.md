caption: The data represent the core figure drawn according to Systems Biology Graphical
  Notation (SBGN) Activity Flow Specifications (Level 1 Version 1) using Beacon Software76.
  The relationships, or arcs, express the nature of influence (positive, negative
  or unknown) between the glyphs and summarize this paper’s findings along with support
  from literature described in the text.
