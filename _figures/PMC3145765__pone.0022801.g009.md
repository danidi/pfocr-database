caption: 'Redox recycling of DOX in mitochondria results in increased levels of superoxide
  and subsequent generation of other types of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
  (ROS/RNS). Increased levels of ROS results in activation of NF-κB leading to expression
  of iNOS and thus increased NO expression. Peroxynitrite formation in both mitochondria
  and cytosol leads to activation of stress signaling pathways such as MAPKs. Build-up
  of ROS results in expression of phosphorylated p53 which in turn activates the BAX
  gene. BAX is involved in cytochrome c release from the mitochondria which leads
  to activation of Caspase 3/7 pathway eventually causing apoptosis. In the absence
  of p53, negative feedback regulation of ROS and iNOS is lost, which leads to upregulation
  of reactive oxygen/nitrosactive stress. BAX gene is transcriptionally active in
  p53 null cells. Excessive ROS/RNS can cause translocation of BAX to mitochondria
  eventually leading to apoptosis. Further, p53 plays an essential role in mitochondrial
  DNA repair, and in the absence of p53 this process is hindered. Note: * or red arrows
  denote potential steps effected/involved in Dox induced cell death in p53 CKO cardiomyocytes.
