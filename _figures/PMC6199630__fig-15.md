caption: 'Complex DNA damage leads to immune signaling. (A) Repair of a clustered
  damaged DNA site: a challenging task. On induction by ionizing radiation of complex
  DNA damage, such as a DSB and two oxidative DNA lesions (a damaged base, red star,
  and an apurinic/apyrimidinic, AP, site), at least two DNA repair pathways and several
  DNA repair proteins will be activated. For the base damage, BER is the main repair
  pathway, while for the DSB, only NHEJ will be considered here for simplicity. In
  all cases, the most basic proteins and enzymes are described. For short-patch BER,
  a DNA glycosylase will recognize and remove the damaged base and the repair should
  be completed by the concerted activity of AP endonuclease 1 (APE1), a DNA polymerase,
  and ligase III to seal the broken ends. In the nearby DSB area (a few bp apart),
  the Ku heterodimer (Ku70/80) initiates NHEJ by binding to the free DNA ends and
  engaging other NHEJ factors, such as DNA-PK, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV, to the DSB
  site. DNA-PK becomes activated on DNA binding and then phosphorylates a number of
  substrates, including p53, Ku, and the DNA ligase IV cofactor XRCC4. Phosphorylation
  of these factors is believed to further facilitate DSB processing. For ligation,
  the ends must be partially processed by the nucleases Artemis, MRE11/RAD50/NBS1
  complex, and FEN-1. Moreover, as shown by advanced fluorescence microscopy, the
  formation of each DSB is rapidly accompanied by phosphorylation of thousands of
  histone H2AX molecules (γH2AX). The MRN complex functions as a sensor of DNA ends
  and activates the ATM kinase that phosphorylates CHK2, p53, and H2AX in flanking
  chromosomal regions. (B). Systemic effects. Processing of clustered DNA damage can
  lead to unrepaired and persistent DNA damage that can cause cell senescence or cell
  death (i.e., apoptosis). This can trigger the extracellular release of different
  “danger” signals or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs: ATP, short DNAs/RNAs,
  ROS, heat shock proteins [HSPs], high-mobility group box [HMGB]-1, S100 proteins,
  and others). DAMPs activate different PRRs, such as TLRs and the formation of inflammasomes,
  a process that leads usually to inflammation and immune-related pathologies. Interestingly,
  recent evidence (see section IV.B.1) suggests a direct interaction between different
  PRRs and DNA repair proteins. Cell damage or death can also lead to the release
  of several cytokines and chemokines that can regulate immune responses. PRR activation
  usually results in NF-κB-mediated release of various proinflammatory cytokines,
  such as IFNs, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, EGFR, and TNFα. The activation of APCs, for
  instance, dendritic cells and macrophages, will induce primarily the innate immune
  response (activation of T cells) and most rarely the adaptive immune response (mediated
  by B cells). In all cases, the constant triggering of the immune system might generate
  many detrimental systemic effects for the organism. Positive immunomodulation is
  usually mediated by the action of regulatory (suppressor) T cells (i.e., Treg cells),
  suppressor macrophages, and immunosuppressive cytokines to maintain overall tissue
  homeostasis. APCs, antigen-presenting cells; BER, base excision repair; DNA-PK,
  DNA-dependent protein kinase; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PRRs, pattern
  recognition receptors; Treg cells, regulatory T cells; TLRs, Toll-like receptors.
