caption: The pathway for activation of the PPIs to result in inhibition of the H,K
  ATPase. The top line shows the pyridine protonation that is responsible for accumulation
  of the PPIs in the acid space of the stimulated parietal cell with a pH<4.0. This
  protonation is followed by protonation of the benzimidazole or imidazopyridine moiety
  with a pKa~1.0 and this happens as shown on the left second row. The protonation
  of this moiety results in activation of the 2C position and the formation of a spiro
  intermediate as shown in the brackets. This rearranges to form the sulfenic acid,
  which is a highly thiophilic reagent. It can dehydrate to form the sulfenamide on
  the right or react directly with cysteines accessible from the luminal (acidic)
  surface of the pump to form covalent disulfides with cysteines accessible from the
  lumen. The sulfenamide is also thiophilic and can also bind covalently to the enzyme.
