caption: Molecular pathogenesis and potential treatments for thrombotic microangiopathy
  in the glomerular endothelium. The glomerular filtration barrier consists of fenestrated
  endothelial cells, the glomerular basement membrane, and the podocyte foot processes.
  In normal endothelium (bottom half of the figure), podocytes produce vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF), which binds to receptors in the endothelial cells, maintaining
  the integrity of the microvasculature. Endothelial cells produce nitric oxide (NO)
  and prostacyclin (PGI2) and express thrombomodulin on their surface, preventing
  the activation of the coagulation cascade and complement. Tissue factor (TF) and
  von Willebrand factor (VWF) remain internalized, and factor H, factor I, and membrane
  co-factor protein (MCP) block the activation and amplification of complement [,,].
  In TMA (top half of the figure), the endothelium becomes damaged and activated.
  TF is expressed on the cell surface, binding factor VIIa (FVIIa) and VWF, which
  promote thrombus formation with activated platelets (brown ovals). Plasminogen activator
  inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) prevents fibrinolysis of the clot. Activated endothelial cells
  express adhesion molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1), permitting the local recruitment
  of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocytes. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is released
  from the endothelial cell and binds to the Tie2 receptor which leads to vascular
  destabilization and vascular leakage. Activated APCs expressed tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF), potentiating the inflammatory response. Activated lymphocytes produce potentially
  donor specific (DSA, solid organ transplant) or recipient specific (RSA, HSCT) antibody,
  which can activate the classical complement cascade. Anti-factor H antibody can
  prevent inhibition of the alternative complement pathway. Activated complement leads
  to generation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which induces cell lysis. C4d
  remains covalently bound to tissue and is a marker of complement activation. Tissue
  damage and inflammation leads to fibrin deposition. Ultimately, albumin leaks into
  the urinary space when the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier is lost
  [,,,,–]. Potential treatments for TA-TMA are shown in the boxes. Defibrotide blocks
  PAI-1 and attenuates the effects of TNF. Rituximab may reduce the production of
  damaging antibodies (DSA, RSA, or anti-factor H antibody) and plasmapheresis may
  remove them. Plasmapheresis may also remove Ang-2. Eculizumab stops the progression
  of the complement cascade to the MAC. Finally, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor
  (ACE) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy reduces proteinuria, preventing
  inflammation and the progression of CKD [,–].
