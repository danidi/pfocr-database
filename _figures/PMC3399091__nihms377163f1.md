caption: PAK1 Molecular Pathway. A, The molecular pathways influenced by PAK1. PAK1
  is activated in response to extracellular stimuli and activated PAK1 in turn initiates
  cascades of pathways. PAK1 is established to impact the cytoskeleton remodeling
  and the cell survival and transformation pathways by phosphorylating various substrates
  and these substrates are shown. In the nucleus, PAK1 regulates cell cycle, chromatin
  and gene expression and the substrates involved in these pathways are also depicted.
  B, The current spectrum of various types of PAK1 inhibitors.
