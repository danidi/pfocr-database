caption: Two pathways that promote axon formation by regulating SAD activity or SAD
  protein levels. Prior studies revealed that SAD activity is positively regulated
  by LKB1, which is activated in response to extracellular signals such as BDNF (;
  ). In a new report published in this issue of Genes & Development,  present evidence
  for a parallel pathway, regulated by the Tsc1–Tsc2 complex and TORC1, which modulates
  SAD protein levels. This new work suggests that local protein synthesis in the nascent
  axon is critical for neurons to polarize.
