caption: Working model of E2-activated SGK1 involvement in negative regulation of
  TLR-4-mediated apoptosis and pro-inflammatory TH1 immune responses at the feto-maternal
  interface. E2-activated SGK1 via the PI3K signaling pathway promoted cell viability
  and suppressed LPS-induced apoptosis of DSCs by up-regulating the expressions of
  anti-apoptotic genes, and attenuating pro-apoptotic FOXO1 activation. E2-sensitive
  activation of SGK1 down-regulates TLR4-mediated NF-κB activation, leading to reduced
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting TH2 shift at the feto-maternal
  interface, which is beneficial to successful gestation.
