caption: 'Summary of the workflow followed in the present study. For increased validity,
  subjects were divided randomly into discovery and test sets. After proteomic analysis
  of the plasma specimens, pathway annotation was performed for the discovery set
  proteins and their abundance was correlated with the respective plasma concentrations
  in the plasma proteome database. Differentially expressed proteins were defined
  with the following criteria: case/control ratio ≥ 2 or ≤ 0.5; Mann–Whitney p-value ≤ 0.05;
  protein identifications based on multiple peptides. The differentially expressed
  proteins with identical expression trend in both sets were shortlisted and extensive
  literature mining was performed. The resulting validated dataset consists of proteins
  previously found associated with CVD and novel findings to be further investigated
  in the context of CVD pathophysiology'
