caption: (A) The scheme represents possible interconnections among the several aspects
  considered in this study (see Discussion). (B) The scheme focuses attention on the
  biochemical pathways involved in the energetic status of the cell. In particular,
  it is possible to hypothesize that the impairment of Complex IV may be a reason
  for the decreased energy production and increased oxidative stress. The loss of
  ATP synthesis may activate the AMPK pathway, inducing an increase in the glycolysis
  pathway to support the cell energy demands. Moreover, the mTOR pathway also seemed
  to be activated, probably to improve the energy production in the mitochondria.
  However, in the SDS cell, these reactions led to a vicious circle, which could increase
  the ATP/AMP ratio impairment.
