caption: Generation of Y-shaped cells in B. abortus. (A) Differential interference
  contrast (DIC) and fluorescence microscopy of a representative Y-shaped cell generated
  by the production of F1-5-YFP. Cells were labeled with the FM4-64 and DAPI compounds
  (staining bacterial membranes and DNA, respectively) and observed using the fluorescent
  signals of YFP, FM4-64, and DAPI as indicated. (B) Time-lapse microscopy. Bacteria
  were placed on a slide layered with rich medium (2YT), and micrographs were taken
  every hour. B. abortus wild-type strain (upper panels) and B. abortus expressing
  the F1-5-YFP, Y-shaped cell generation (middle panels), and Y-shaped cell growth
  and division (lower panels). Scale bar, 1 μm. (C) Model of the regulatory pathway
  proposed for the interpretation of generation of altered morphologies. The red frame
  indicates the proposed essentiality pathway. (D) In a normal situation, without
  alteration of growth or division, each sibling cell inherits a new growing pole
  after division (shown above). If division is inhibited and growth still takes place,
  at a similar time or cell volume, two growing poles are also generated, but in the
  same cell and at the new pole, generating a Y shape (shown below).
