caption: Graph abstract HCC manifestation is typically preceded by hepatic fibrosis
  and cirrhosis. There are limited cures for patients suffering advanced liver cirrhosis
  and HCC. Dysfunction of the Hippo signaling and TGF-beta transduction pathways plays
  a vital role in the pathogenesis and course of this illness. YAP1 recruits SMAD7
  to activated TGF-β receptor I (TβRI), hampering the formation of co-SMAD (SMAD2/3
  and SMAD2/4) complexes. These SMAD complexes are thus unable to enter the nucleus
  to activate transcription of downstream effectors. SMAD7 serves as the negative
  regulator of the TGF-β signaling pathway. The Hippo signaling pathway is composed
  of a series of kinases including MST1/2, LATS1/2, and nuclear effector YAP1. Once
  the Hippo pathway is activated, LATS1/2 is phosphorylated by MST1/2. LATS1 is mainly
  involved in cell autophagy, DNA methylation and drug resistance. LATS2 phosphorylates
  YAP1, leading to its degradation. Overexpressed miR-21-3p directly silences SMAD7
  expression by binding to its 3′-UTR region, further impairing the linkage between
  SMAD7 and YAP1. The decreased stability of the SMAD7/YAP1 complex facilitates YAP1
  translocation to the nucleus and results in the subsequent transcription of the
  downstream gene connective tissue growth factor (CTGF).
