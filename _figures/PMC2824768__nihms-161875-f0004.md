caption: Entry into an ICL repair pathway depends on the mode of recognition. (A)
  In the context of a non-replicating DNA, the distortion of the DNA helical structure
  caused by the lesion attracts protein(s) involved in the global damage surveillance
  of DNA. This process has been shown to involve proteins of the NER pathway, with
  XPC leading the initial recognition. The first incision step on either side of the
  lesion on one strand of the duplex by XPF-ERCC1 complex (and perhaps XPG) generates
  a gapped structure which serves as a substrate for bypass polymerases. The now flipped
  out monoadduct-like structure can be recognized by DDB2 and perhaps also by glycosylases
  such as MPG or Neil1. Again, the NER pathway will initiate the second cycle of repair
  and remove the remaining adduct on the opposite strand. (B) Stalling of RNA polymerases
  at the site of lesion during transcription can also serve as a means of ICL recognition
  in non-replicating DNA. (C) and (D), a stalled replication fork, either due to a
  single or dual fork encounter, is attractive to proteins of the Fanconi Anemia (FA)
  pathway and proteins such as Mus81-EME1/2, Snm1B, and MRN. Initial recognition is
  thought to be mediated by the FancM-FAAP24 complex, which then becomes part of the
  FA core complex. The FA core complex is a prerequisite to recruit the FancD2 and
  FancI proteins which are modified via ubiquitination and phosphorylation. The ICL
  is incised by XPF-ERCC1 and Mus81-EME1 on the leading strand, generating a DSB at
  the fork. In the case of converging forks (D), the first incision cycle may occur
  on either strand. The gapped structure will be filled in by lesion bypass polymerases,
  including polζ, polκ, polι, polN, polη and Rev1. When a single fork is stalled by
  the ICL polymerase(s) will extend a parental strand to fill the gap. When two forks
  converge on the ICL a leading daughter strand is extended to bypass the lesion.
  Upon removal of the remaining single adduct on the opposite strand, in an NER dependent
  pathway, the broken fork will be reconstructed by recombinational repair. A color
  version of this figure is available in the online version of this manuscript.
