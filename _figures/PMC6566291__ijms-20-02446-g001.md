caption: Mechanisms of TGF-β-mediated skeletal muscle fibrosis. Transforming growth
  factor beta (TGFB) promotes extracellular matrix (ECM) preservation by promoting
  the expression of profibrotic genes such as type I collagen. Members of the TGFB
  superfamily function by binding to TGFB type I receptor (TGFBRI) and TGFB type II
  receptor (TGFBRII). This triggers formation of a complex and phosphorylation and
  activation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 proteins, which then form a complex with SMAD4, allowing
  SMADs to be transported to the nucleus to bind transcription factors such as scleraxis.
  Another transcription factor, Sharp-1, associates with SMAD3 and antagonizes TGFB
  signaling. microRNA 29 (miR-29) leads to downregulated expression of pro-fibrotic
  genes. miR146a-5p leads to downregulated expression of SMAD4. Fibrinogen and osteopontin
  (OPN) are inflammatory molecules that lead to increased TGFB expression through
  increased neutrophil count and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) expression, respectively.
  Angiotensin II (Ang-II) signals through the angiotensin II receptor type I (AT-1R),
  coupled to heterotrimeric Gq proteins, stimulating NADPH oxidase (NOX)-derived reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) formation. Enhanced oxidative stress is another mechanism that
  leads to enhanced TGFB expression and signaling. Therapeutics targeting this pathway
  include antioxidants, NOX inhibitors, NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activators,
  angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers
  (ARBs). Suramin is a TGFB receptor antagonist and decorin is an inhibitor or TGFB
  signaling that have also been implicated as TGFB-targeted treatments of skeletal
  muscle fibrosis.
