caption: Hypothesis of miR-567 modulation in healthy and BC cells. When miR-567 is
  expressed, TGF-β, bound to its receptor (two subunits), activates the pathway that
  leads to the phosphorylation of downstream effectors (i.e., SMAD2 and 3) and to
  the downregulation of KPN family member. The last effect could be mediated by miR-567
  activity. miR-567 could possibly also modulate SMAD4 effector, needed for the transcriptional
  activation of TGF-β target genes. In aggressive BC cell, TGF-β is upregulated, and
  the higher activation of its pathway leads to transcription of genes involved in
  the proliferation control and invasion. The reduction of miR-567 observed in aggressive
  BC could lead to increase of KPN family members, facilitating the growth of the
  tumor. TGFβr = TGFβ receptor
