  inhibition of GPX4, and/or loss of the GPX4 protein. Iron-dependent lipoxygenase-mediated
  peroxidation of lipids (predominantly PUFAs) leads to the production of toxic “lipid
  ROS” which lead to subsequent loss of plasma membrane integrity associated with
  passive release of DAMPs. In addition, production of ROS in excess may lead to lipid
