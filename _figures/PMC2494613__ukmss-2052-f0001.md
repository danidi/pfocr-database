caption: In wild type flies, the combined action of the prepattern genes and signalling
  through the Wingless pathway leads to the expression of proneural genes of the achaete-scute
  complex in small groups of cells. All the cells within these proneural clusters
  have the potential to develop into SOPs. However lateral inhibition signalling restricts
  achaete-scute expression to one or two cells. These cells will divide three times
  to produce the socket, bristle, supporting, glial and neural cells of the sensory
  bristles. In the NMcd and NAx mutants there is increased Notch signalling via Deltex
  which represses proneural gene expression. This signalling prevents proneural cluster
  specification in NMcd flies and consequently no SOPs develop. In NAx mutants the
  increase in signalling via Deltex is not as great and proneural clusters of reduced
  size develop. The process of lateral inihibition then restricts proneural gene expression
  to one cell. Both signalling via Deltex and lateral inhibition are abolished in
  Nnull clones leading to robust achaete-scute expression and the development of multiple
  SOPs.
