caption: A. Acetyl-CoA and histone acetylation. Various metabolic pathways lead to
  the formation of acetyl-CoA, which is then utilized as an acetyl group donor during
  histone acetyltransferase-dependent acetylation of nucleosomal histones. B. NAD
  can be de novo synthesized from amino acids such as tryptophan and also through
  the salvage pathway. NAD+ is an obligatory cofactor for the activity of SIRT1 and
  SIRT6, which decetylase histone H3K9/14 and H3K9/56, respectively. Decetylation
  of histone H3 by these sirtuins modulate the expression of metabolic genes, thereby
  altering metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, mitochondrial respiration,
  fatty acid oxidation and lipogenesis. C. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is generated
  through methionine byosinthesis pathway and it is the universal donor of methyl
  groups to both histone methyltransferases (HMTs) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs).
  Within this metabolic pathway, S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) functions as a repressor
  of both DNMTs and histone lysine demethylases (KDMs). Alpha-ketogluterate (a-KG)
  is generated through the TCA cycle and serves as an obligatory cofactor for the
  catalytic activity of KDMs and ten-eleven translocation (TETs) enzymes. TETs oxidized
  DNA by successive catalysis of methylated cytosines into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
  (5hmC), 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) and 5-formylcytosine (5fC).
