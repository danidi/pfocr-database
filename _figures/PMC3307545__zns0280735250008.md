caption: 'Glutamate and dopamine signaling pathways act synergistically to induce
  Ca2+ overload and apoptosis of HD MSNs. Dopamine (Dop) released from midbrain dopaminergic
  neurons () stimulates D1-class and D2-class DARs, which are abundantly expressed
  in MSNs (). D1-class DARs are coupled to Gs/olf, activation of adenyl cyclase, and
  cAMP production (). PKA potentiates glutamate-induced Ca2+ signals by facilitating
  activity of NMDAR (; ) and InsP3R1 (; ). In HD MSNs, NR2B- and InsP3R1-mediated
  Ca2+signaling is further facilitated by Httexp (, ; , ). As a result, simultaneous
  activation of glutamate and dopamine receptors leads to cytosolic and mitochondrial
  Ca2+ overload in HD MSNs. The mitochondrial Ca2+ handling is further destabilized
  by direct association of Httexp with mitochondria (Mito) (; ). Once mitochondrial
  Ca2+ storage capacity is exceeded, mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)
  opens, leading to release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and activation of caspases
  9 and 3, which leads to progression of apoptosis, MSN degeneration, and HD. The
  model is supported by the ability of blockers (shown in red) to protect YAC128 MSNs
  from dopamine/glutamate-induced apoptosis in our in vitro experiments. The blockers
  that were effective in in vitro experiments are as follows: D1-class DAR blocker
  SCH23390; NMDAR blocker (+)-MK801 and NR2B-specific blocker ifenprodil; mGluR1/5-specific
  blockers MPEP and CPCCOEt; and membrane-permeable InsP3R1 blockers 2-APB and enoxaparin
  (Enox). Also shown is a clinically relevant NMDAR antagonist, memantine (MMT), which
  protects YAC128 MSNs from glutamate-induced apoptosis (), and a clinically relevant
  dopamine pathway inhibitor, TBZ, which demonstrated efficacy in the whole-animal
  experiments with a YAC128 HD mouse model as described in Results. PLC, Phospholipase
  C.'
