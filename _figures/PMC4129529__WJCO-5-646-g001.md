caption: 'Cell-proliferative signaling pathways in lung cancer cell. The epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) family consists of 4 members: EGFR/ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3
  and ErbB4. Specific ligands (e.g., EGF, TGF-α) binding to EGFR results in a conformational
  change of the receptor, exposing the dimerization domain and allowing for homodimerization
  with a second EGFR, or heterodimerization with another member of the EGFR family.
  Activation of the EGFR results in autophosphorylation of key tyrosine residues.
  These tyrosine phosphorylated sites leads to the activation of major downstream
  signaling cascades, including the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway and PI3K/AKT pathway. These
  pathways act in a coordinated manner to promote cell survival. While wild type EGFR
  is activated in a ligand-dependent manner, mutant EGFR is constitutively activated.
  First- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs bind reversibly or irreversibly to the kinase
  domain and effectively inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase by binding to the adenosine
  triphosphate-binding site of the enzyme and inhibit downstream signaling, leading
  to apoptosis of cancer cells.'
