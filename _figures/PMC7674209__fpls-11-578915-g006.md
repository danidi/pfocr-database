caption: Schematic illustrating the photosynthetic electron transport chain and state
  transition model. The depicted model consisting of linear and cyclic electron flow
  and ATP generation. Linear electron flow (red arrow) associated with photosystem
  II (PSII), cytochrome b6f (Cytb6f), photosystem I (PSI), and ferredoxin-NADPH (FNR).
  PSII is composed of activation of oxidoreductase transferring an electron from water
  to plastoquinone, resulting in the reduced form of PQH2. In this process, when adequate
  linear electron transfer occurs, it is catalyzed by FNR to NADPH on one side, and
  simultaneously, proton gradient drives the ATP synthase (ATPase). Cycling electron
  transport (CEF) (blue lines) is represented by a single pathway involving ferredoxin-PQ
  reductase, which transfers electrons from Fd to PQ. Further, under aerobic conditions,
  the plastoquinone terminal (PTOX) could oxidize the PQ pool; therefore, electrons,
  e.g., from glycolysis, are imported into the chloroplast and lead to a reduction
  in the PQ pool by an NADH dehydrogenase (Ndh). In this study, the net production
  of electron conversation by PSII was decreased over a twofold change because of
  downregulated PSII primary proteins that catalyze this process (see ). Subsequently,
  less electron and proton were pumped to the PSI to NADPH and ATP synthase for the
  Calvin cycle and carbon fixation process. Higher downregulation in LHC 1 by lower
  temperature (see ) affects the CEF electron, which has been sent to ATP synthase
  with less ATP formation for other cellular processes depending on these energies.
