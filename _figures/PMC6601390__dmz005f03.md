caption: Molecular characteristics of steroid hormone receptors in endometriotic tissue.
  In endometriotic tissue, high levels of local estradiol are maintained by the upregulation
  of various nuclear receptors such as NR5A1 and ESR2, which are connected via feedback
  loops involving inflammatory factors. The abnormally low ESR1:ESR2 ratio in endometriotic
  stromal cells is associated with low levels of PGR, which leads to progesterone
  resistance and further contributes to a hyperestrogenic environment via an abnormal
  retinoic acid signaling pathway. COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; ESR1, estrogen receptor
  alpha, ESR2, estrogen receptor beta; HSD17B2, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type
  2; PGE2, prostaglandin E2; PPARβ/δ, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
  beta/gamma; PGR, progesterone receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RERG, RAS-like
  estrogen-regulated growth inhibitor; NR5A1, steroidogenic factor 1; StAR, steroidogenic
  acute regulatory protein; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.
