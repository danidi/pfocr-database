caption: . (A) HR-ESI-MS spectra of 3 obtained from feeding experiments. (a) Control;
  (b) after feeding of l-[U-13C, 15N]methionine (only four carbons and one nitrogen
  are found in the final product, Fig. S17); (c) after feeding of l-[methyl-2H3]methionine
  (no d incorporated) showing that the aminobutyryl moiety of methionine (without
  S-methyl) is incorporated into the final product 3. (B) (a) Proposed biosynthetic
  pathway of colibactin up to intermediate 4 involving 1 and 2 tethered to the assembly
  line. After release of 4 and decarboxylation of the β-keto-acid, 3 is formed by
  intramolecular cyclization analogous to Dieckmann condensation. (b) A hypothesis
  for ACC biosynthesis and then loading on ClbH; (c) alternative hypothesis for loading
  of methionine onto ClbH and then conversion to ACC on the T domain catalyzed by
  A2 domain. (C) Biosynthesis of ACC moiety in other organisms. (a) Biosynthesis of
  ACC in the ethylene pathway in higher plants;, (b) incorporation of l-[U-13C]methionine
  into cytotrienin A showed that the ACC unit originates from methionine in Streptomyces
  sp. RK95-74; (c) biosynthetic pathway of the coronamic acid (CMA) moiety of coronatine
  in P. syringae strains., C, condensation domain; A, adenylation domain; T, thiolation
  domain; E, epimerization domain; KS, ketosynthase domain; AT, acyltransferase domain;
  DH, dehydratase domain; KR, ketoreductase domain; ER, enoyl reductase domain; SAM,
  S-adenosylmethionine; ACC, 1-aminocyclopropanecarboxylic acid.
