caption: Diagrammatic overview of the late stages of the HIV life-cycle. (A) After
  transcription the full length viral RNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
  for Gag (and Gag-Pol) synthesis. Singly spliced RNA is exported to produce the envelope
  glycoproteins (dark blue). Gag binds to a dimeric genomic RNA via its NC domain
  to form ribonucleoprotein complex which is trafficked to the membrane where more
  Gag assembles and budding occurs (black dashed-box and B). During HIV particle assembly
  or soon after particle release, protease (PR, not shown) cleaves the Gag polyprotein
  to MA, CA and NC and protein rearrangement occurs to form the mature virion. (B)
  Close-up view of the HIV budding process. ESCRT-I is recruited to the budding site
  via interactions between PTAP in p6 of Gag and TSG101 of ESCRT-I (black arrow).
  The link to ESCRT-III (CHMPs) for budding is via an unknown mechanism but seems
  to bypass ESCRT-II (black dashed-arrow). Additionally/alternatively, ALIX binds
  to YPXnL motif also in p6 and NC via V and Bro1 domain, respectively and directs
  Gag to ESCRT-III via its Bro1 domain for budding (blue arrow). RNA involvement in
  NC-ALIX binding has been suggested (wavy line), but the identity of the RNA is not
  clear. HIV has no PPXY motif, but the NEDD4-like ubiquitin ligase family has also
  been implicated in facilitating HIV joining the ESCRT pathway for budding probably
  via adaptors on the plasma membrane (NEDD4-2; red arrow) or the ALIX pathway (NEDD4-1).
  For membrane scission to occur, ESCRT-III components are activated and polymerized
  to form a dome-shaped structure. VPS4, regulated by LIP5-CHMP5 and CHMP1-ISTI binary
  complexes (not shown), is recruited to the budding site where it multimerizes to
  form a dodecamer and disassembles the ESCRT-III filaments for recycling. How membrane
  scission occurs is unknown.
