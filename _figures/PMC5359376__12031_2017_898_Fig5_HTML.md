caption: 'Enrichment analysis for pathway map ontologies revealed significant biological
  processes associated with the most promising targets commonly deregulated in mouse
  and human ALS. a Representation of the top 10 most significantly enriched (P value
  <0.05) canonical pathway maps associated with the most promising target genes commonly
  differentially expressed in end-stage SOD1G93A mice and SALS patients when compared
  with their corresponding controls. A histogram of statistical significance (−log
  P value) is shown: the list is arranged in descending order with the most significant
  pathways at the top. The analysis was performed using the MetaCore™ pathway analysis
  suite. Detailed information about pathway map enrichment analysis is described in
  Supplementary Table . b Interaction pathway map representing the 12 most promising
  targets deregulated in the same direction in both end-stage SOD1G93A mice and at
  least one of the two subgroups of SALS patients, together with their corresponding
  pharmacological modulators. The map was created using the MetaCore Pathway Map Creator
  tool (GeneGo). Gene expression values are presented on the map as “thermometer-like”
  figures (red for upregulated, blue downregulated with thermometer height relative
  to fold change) with SALS1 patients data represented as thermometer no. 1, SALS2
  patient no. 2, and 120-day old SOD1G93A mice no. 3. Pathway objects and links are
  described separately in the Supplementary Fig.'
