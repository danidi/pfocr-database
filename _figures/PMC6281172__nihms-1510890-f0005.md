caption: Illustrations of the canonical ISGF3 signaling system at steady state (left)
  and following type I IFN-stimulation (right). Prior to IFN stimulation, transmembrane
  IFNAR1/2 receptor chains are associated with TYK2 and JAK1 kinases, and latent factors
  STAT1 and STAT2 are present in the cytoplasm. IRF9 associates with STAT2 in the
  cytoplasm and also shuttles into the nucleus. Histones H2A.Z and H3.3 occupy transcriptionally
  silent ISG promoters. IFN binding to the receptor complex (right) induces oligomerization
  and phosphorylation of the receptor chains, generating docking sites for the latent
  STAT proteins’ SH2 domains, resulting in phosphorylation of STAT2 Y690 and STAT1
  Y701. Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 undergo SH2-mediated dimerization and along
  with IRF9 form the ISGF3 complex. ISGF3 translocates into the nucleus, where it
  binds to the ISRE at ISG promoters and recruits coactivators relevant to histone
  modification, chromatin remodeling, and Pol II activation, including GCN5 and BRD2
  that remodel the H2A.Z-containing nucleosome, MED14 to recruit Pol II for activating
  ISG transcription, and histone H3.3 is deposited at ISG gene bodies. The roles for
  essential co-activators RVB1, RVB2, CBP, BRG1, and HDACs are poorly understood.
