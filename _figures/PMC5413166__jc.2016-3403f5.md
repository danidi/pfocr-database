caption: '(A) An example of innate immune response induced by E2 in ML-1 cells. Recombinant
  HCV E2 protein increased the expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD40
  and the activation of other molecules involved in the NF-κB signaling pathways in
  the human thyroid cell line ML-1. (B) HSP network induced by HCV E2 protein in human
  thyroid primary cells. In human thyroid primary cells, the expression of several
  HSPs was increased by HCV envelope glycoprotein E2: HSP60 (HSPD1), HSP10 (HSPE1),
  and HSP12A (heat shock 70kDa protein12a). Ingenuity pathway analysis detected several
  molecules involved in this network. The numbers indicate the log2 ratio for each
  gene.'
