caption: 'A: TGFβ and BMP signalling pathways. To activate signalling, a TGFβ or a
  BMP ligand binds their respective receptor complexes that contain two type I receptors
  and two type II receptors, which causes a phosphorylation event that activates the
  receptor Smads (R-Smads). Following this, R-Smads bind with their Co-Smad, Smad4,
  and move into the nucleus to activate TGFβ or BMP-responsive genes, respectively.
  TGFβ Smads = Smad2, Smad3. BMP Smads = Smad1, Smad5, Smad8 (S1/5/8). The yellow
  star with a P represents a phosphorylation event. B: Notch signalling pathway. Notch
  signalling is activated when a signalling cell with the Notch ligands, Jagged (Jag)
  or Delta-like (Dll) bind with a Notch receptor on a signal receiving cell. The binding
  of the ligand to the Notch receptor causes a conformational change and exposes two
  cleavage sites S2 and S3 in the Notch receptor. The first cleavage of Notch occurs
  at the S2 site via a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) protein that releases
  the extracellular portion of Notch. The second cleavage of Notch occurs at the S3
  site by γ-secretase complex and this releases the intracellular domain of Notch
  (NICD). NICD translocates into the nucleus and binds with RBPJ (Recombination signal-Binding
  Protein 1 for J-Kappa), MAML (Master-mind Like), p300, and co-activators (CoA) to
  activate Notch responsive genes. In the absence of NICD, RBPJ is bound by co-repressors
  (CoR) and cannot activate Notch responsive genes.'
