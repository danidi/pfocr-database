caption: A. Mutual inhibition between the ROP2-actin pathway and the ROP6-MT pathway
  to maintain the interdigitated PM domains for lobe and indentation formation in
  pavement cells (Fu, Gu et al., 2005; Fu, Xu et al., 2009; Xu, Wen et al. 2010) ROPs
  shown in the figure are in their active state and therefore GTP-bound. B. Secondary
  cell wall patterning in vessel cells is modulated by the mutual inhibition between
  the ROP11-MIDD1 pathway and cortical MTs (Oda, Iida et al., 2010; Oda, Fukuda. 2012).
