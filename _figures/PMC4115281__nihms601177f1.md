caption: This schematic model of autophagy shows that early after infection with CVB3,
  Beclin 1, a component in the PtdIns3K complex responsible for the initiation of
  nucleation of the phagophore membrane, is activated enwrapping cytosolic proteins,
  protein aggregates, and organelles. CVB3 was shown to use the phagophore-attached
  membranes as scaffolds to support its own translation and replication [,,]. In the
  next step, Atg12–Atg5-Atg16 and LC3/Atg8, which is covalently linked to the amino
  group of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are recruited to the phagophore to facilitate
  the phagophore expansion step. Molecular interaction studies indicated that the
  Atg5–Atg12 conjugate negatively regulates the type I IFN production pathway (⊥)
  by direct association with the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway through
  the caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) []. Upon vesicle completion, most of the
  ATG proteins are dissociated from the autophagosome and autophagosomes subsequently
  fuse with endosomes to form an amphisome. It was proposed that upon fusion of endosomes
  with autophagosome TLR could recognize CVB3 RNA and initiate production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and type I IFN []. Ampisomes were recently also shown to be signaling
  platforms, where NADPH oxidase-driven ROS production promotes the release of the
  mucin granules []. At the next step autophagosome - endosome and/or - lysosome fuse
  and degrade cargo by lysosomal proteases. Fusion of autophagosome with lysosome
  was suggested to constitutively and efficiently deliver cytosolic proteins for MHC
  class II presentation [], and therefore promote the presentation of products of
  lysosomal proteolysis to CD4 T cells []. CVB3 was suggested to suppress (⊥), via
  an unknown mechanism, the latest stages of autophagy maturation and therefore escape
  presentation of its RNA to TLRs [] and/or loading of CVB3 derived antigens onto
  MHCII.
