caption: Infectious life cycle of L. monocytogenes (adapted from Sleator and Hill).
  Listeria has the ability to cross the epithelial barrier, through the expression
  of internalins (inlA, inlB), and after which be engulfed by sub-epithelial macrophage
  (A). While in the phagosome a number of cells are lysed (B) releasing antigens for
  subsequent presentation through the MHC class II pathway to stimulate CD4+ immune
  responses (C). Alternatively, Listeria escapes the phagosome using a pore forming
  cytolysin called listeriolysin O (D). Within the cytosol, Listerial proteins may
  be processed via the MHC class I pathway for stimulation of CD8+ immune responses
  (E). Listeria may also pass to neighboring cells through the expression of other
  virulence factors (F).
