caption: Natural products as TLR agonists and antagonists affecting various stages
  in the signaling pathway, including downstream molecules MyD88 and IKK. Agonist
  activity is shown in green while antagonist or inhibitory activity is shown in red.
  In particular, natural TLR agonists/antagonists are shown for TLRs 1, 2, 4, 6, and
  9. TLR, Toll-like Receptor; TIR, Toll/IL-1R; TIRAP, Toll-Interleukin 1 Receptor
  domain containing Adaptor Protein; MyD88, Myeloid differentiation primary response
  gene 88; IRAK, Interleukin-1 Receptor Associated Kinase; TRAF, TNF (Tumor Necrosis
  Factor) Receptor Associated Factors; IKK, Inhibitor of nuclear factor κB Kinase
  complex; NF-κB, Nuclear factor-κB.
