caption: 'Model of how the nuclear transport factor 2 and Ran may function in the
  import of the EcR-B1 in the 20E signal transduction pathway. 1, the EcR-B1 transport
  through the NPC by binding with the importinα1 and importinβ and goes into the nucleoplasm;
  2, in the nucleoplasm, 20E binds with EcR-B1 and formed trimeric complex with USP
  to regulate the transcriptions of genes. In the cytoplasm, NTF2 binds with RanGDP
  and transports RanGDP into the nucleoplasm, where RanGDP is converted into RanGTP
  by RCC1; RanGTP then is transported back into the cytoplasm by importinβ and hydrolyzed
  to RanGDP by RanGAP []; this process results in the energy gradient for the transport
  of EcR-B1 and the accumulation of EcR-B1 in the nucleus. NPC: nuclear pore complex;
  RCC1: Ran nucleotide exchange factor; RanGAP: Ran GTPase-activating protein. EcRE:
  ecdysone response elements.'
