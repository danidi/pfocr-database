caption: Energy metabolic map of enzymes up-regulated on the transcriptional and translational
  levels by STAT1. The majority of enzymes belonged to the glycolytic pathway. The
  two citrate cycle enzymes produce reduced forms of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2), which donate electrons
  in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Also, three subunits of the catalytic
  core of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthase (F1) were identified. Red,
  up-regulated by Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1). See
  Table 2 for further details.
