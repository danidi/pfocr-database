caption: Reconstruction of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-like signalling
  (IIS) pathway of Haemonchus contortus. Four insulin-like peptides (ILPs) are encoded
  in H. contortus (orange) compared with 40 in Caenorhabditis elegans. All core functional
  gene products (green) of the IIS pathway, except for AKT-2 and DDL-2 (grey), are
  encoded in H. contortus. Additional transcription factors activated downstream of
  the IIS pathway, such as SKN-1 and HSF-1, are also predicted in H. contortus. Phosphatidylinositol
  (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) is the product of the class I phosphoinostide 3-kinases
  (PI 3-kinases) phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2);
  it is a phospholipid in the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation represented by P (yellow).
  The insulin pathway controls the transcription of various genes, and regulates key
  processes, including dauer formation, longevity, stress resistance and morphogenesis,
  as well as other pathways such as TGF-β and involving other key transcription factors
