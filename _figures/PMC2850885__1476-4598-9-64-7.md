caption: Proposed model of a EGFR/β-catenin/cyclin D1 signaling pathway in oral cancer.
  EGFR induces phosphorylation of β-catenin (Tyr) and GSK-3β (Ser-9). Phosphorylation
  of β-catenin (Tyr) leads to its dissociation from membranes. Phosphorylation of
  GSK-3β (Ser-9) inhibits its kinase activity so that β-catenin is not degraded, but
  is translocated to the nucleus. In the absence of an EGFR signal, β-catenin target
  genes are occupied by a repression complex (e.g., HDAC and Suv39h1), and histones
  in this area are in a compressed status, marked by high level of H3K9 methylation.
  Following EGFR signal activation, nuclear-translocated β-catenin combines with TCF/LEF
  transcription factors to recruit coactivators (e.g., CBP, Brg, etc.) to the regulatory
  element. These replace the repression complexes, leading to decompression of chromatin
  and high level of histone acetylation and H3K4 methylation.
