caption: Terpenoid metabolism in engineered tobacco trichomes for triterpene production
  in plastids. The gray pathway represents the normal biosynthetic route for triterpenes
  and sterols. The enzymes are targeted to directly produce the triterpenes in the
  plastids. Overexpressed enzymes are denoted in dark blue. New products deriving
  from the engineering metabolism are denoted in light blue. The sinking plastidial
  isoprenoid pool might provoke undesirable consequences. Potentially affected metabolites
  are denoted in orange. ABA, Abscisic acid; CYP450, cytochrome P450; FDS, farnesyl
  diphosphate synthase; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate;
  GPP, geranyl diphosphate; OSC, 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase; SQE, squalene epoxidase;
  SQS, squalene synthase.
