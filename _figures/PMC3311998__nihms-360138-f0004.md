caption: PKM2 is a less active isoform of the terminal glycolytic enzyme pyruvate
  kinase. It is also uniquely inhibited downstream of tyrosine kinase signaling. The
  decreased enzymatic activity of PKM2 in the cytoplasm promotes the accumulation
  of upstream glycolytic intermediates and their shunting into anabolic pathways.
  These pathways include the serine synthetic pathway that contributes to nucleotide
  and amino acid production. When mitochondrial metabolism is excessive, reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) from the mitochondria can feedback to inhibit PKM2 activity.
  Acetylation of PKM2, dependent on acetyl-CoA availability, may also promote PKM2
  degradation and further contribute to increased flux through anabolic synthesis
  pathways branching off glycolysis.
