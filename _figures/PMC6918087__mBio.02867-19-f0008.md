caption: Hypothetical scheme of the role of GPS1 in influenza virus polymerase activity.
  The results of our study suggest that GPS1 plays a role in influenza virus polymerase
  activity via the NF-κB signaling pathway. (A) IκB inhibits the nuclear localization
  of NF-κB by masking the nuclear localization signal of NF-κB. (B) IκB is phosphorylated
  by IκB kinase (IKK). (C) GPS1, possibly with M2, supports the polyubiquitination
  of IκB. (D) Polyubiquitinated IκB is recognized by proteasomes and subjected to
  proteasomal degradation, and the NLS of NF-κB is exposed. (E) NF-κB translocates
  to the nucleus, and the NF-κB signaling pathway is activated. (F) Finally, the activation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway results in the upregulation of influenza virus polymerase
  activity. Ub, ubiquitin.
