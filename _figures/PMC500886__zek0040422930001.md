caption: Biosynthesis of sphingolipids in S. cerevisiae. A simplified diagram listing
  key steps in sphingolipid synthesis is shown. Proteins known to be involved at each
  step are listed by genetic designation. Gene products that are responsive to Pdr
  pathway regulation are indicated in bold italics.
