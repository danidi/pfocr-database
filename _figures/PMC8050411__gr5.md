caption: Enriched canonical pathways of the DEGs associated with the p53 signalling
  pathway identified by IPA, showing gene expression and predicted relationships between
  top regulated 311 nm UVB DEGs at 6 h and 18 h post-irradiation. Signalling pathway
  regulation based on the analysis of (A) 755 DEGs at 6 h and (B) 795 DEGs at 18 h
  respectively. Blue lines between DEGs represent predicted inhibition between genes
  and orange lines represent predicted activation between DEGs based on our transcriptomic
  data. Red symbols denote increased gene expression and green gene symbols represent
  downregulation. Each symbol shape represents a different molecule type. (For interpretation
  of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  Web version of this article.)
