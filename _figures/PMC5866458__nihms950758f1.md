caption: a | The canonical homologous recombination pathway begins with formation
  of a double-strand break (DSB). b | DSB formation is followed by end-processing
  reactions in which the 5′ single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends that flank DSBs are resected
  to expose 3′ ssDNA ends. c | These ends are quickly bound by ssDNA-binding proteins
  — single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) in bacteria or replication protein A
  (RPA) in eukaryotes — that protect the ssDNA from degradation and remove any secondary
  structure. d | Mediator proteins (such as the Escherichia coli RecFOR proteins,
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA repair and recombination protein Rad52 or human breast
  cancer type 2 susceptibility protein (BRCA2); not depicted) then stimulate the replacement
  of ssDNA-binding proteins with recombinases from the highly conserved RAD51/RecA
  family of DNA recombinases, which are all ATP-dependent DNA-binding proteins that
  form extended helical filaments on DNA. These filaments are referred to as presynaptic
  complexes, and they catalyse all the key DNA transactions that occur during the
  early stages of recombination. e | The presynaptic filament first performs a homology
  search to locate a donor double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule with sequence homology
  to the presynaptic ssDNA. Once a homologous donor has been identified, the presynaptic
  complex catalyses strand invasion, which results in the formation of a D-loop intermediate
  whereby the presynaptic ssDNA is paired with the homologous donor DNA. f | The 3′
  end of the invading ssDNA strand within the D-loop then serves as a primer for DNA
  polymerases to begin copying information from the donor template to complete repair
  of the damaged DNA through either the double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathway
  or the synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA) pathway. During DSBR, both of
  the 3′ overhangs from the processed DSB are paired with the donor DNA, and subsequent
  ligation of the newly replicated ends results in the formation of a double Holliday
  junction. Resolution of the double Holliday junction by cleavage of the DNA strands
  can yield either crossover products (as depicted) or non-crossover products (not
  shown). During SDSA, only one of the 3′ overhangs is paired with the donor DNA,
  and the second end is thought to remain unpaired. The 3′ invading end is used as
  a primer for DNA replication. The newly synthesized strand is then displaced from
  the donor DNA and annealed to the complementary 3′ overhang from the other end of
  the processed DSB. Flap removal and ligation restores the broken DNA, producing
  only non-crossover products. We refer readers to several reviews for more detailed
  descriptions of each of these reaction steps,,,,. DMC1, meiotic recombination protein
  DMC1/LIM15 homologue.
