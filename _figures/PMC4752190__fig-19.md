caption: Proposed mechanisms underlying nitroglycerin (GTN)-induced endothelial dysfunction.
  GTN treatment causes a decrease in Ser1177 () and an increase in Tyr657 () and Thr495
  () phosphorylation of the eNOS, leading to a decreased activity (eventually also
  uncoupling). In addition, the key enzyme of the de novo synthetic pathway of the
  eNOS cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), by GTP cyclohydrolase-1 (GCH-1) is downregulated
  by chronic GTN treatment (), also leading to a dysfunctional, superoxide (O2•−)-producing
  nitric oxide synthase. S-glutathionylation, a novel regulatory pathway of eNOS,
  is increased in the setting of tolerance (). The endogenous inhibitor of eNOS, ADMA,
  is upregulated in response to oxidative stress conditions (). All of these adverse
  regulatory pathways that are activated by GTN are normalized by telmisartan therapy.
  In addition, downstream of eNOS, the •NO receptor, sGC, is desensitized by GTN-mediated
  S-nitrosation and potentially S-oxidation and/or oxidative depletion of heme ().
