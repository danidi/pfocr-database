caption: We propose that C. elegans HCF-1 and SIR-2.1 coordinate to fine-tune the
  transcriptional activity of DAF-16 on a distinct subset of potential target genes.
  DAF-16 target genes responsive to the hcf-1/sir-2.1 pathway largely overlap with
  a small subset of IIS-regulated genes, and are specialized in longevity determination,
  cellular defense, and lipid/fatty acid/amino acid homeostasis. HCF-1 likely represses
  DAF-16 by forming a complex with SIR-2.1 and 14-3-3, and antagonizing their abilities
  to stimulate DAF-16. This functional relationship is highly conserved as mammalian
  HCF proteins also repress the expression of multiple FOXO/SIRT1 target genes and
  reside in protein complexes with SIRT1 and FOXO3. Our results highlight HCF proteins
  to be key components of the regulatory network linking SIR-2.1/SIRT1 and DAF-16/FOXO
  in diverse organisms.
