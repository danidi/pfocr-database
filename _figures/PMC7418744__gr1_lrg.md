caption: 'Pictographic representation showing the potential role of statins in COVID-19
  infection. SARS-CoV-2 activates the immune response through interaction with various
  inflammatory cells followed by release of inflammatory cytokines and host cell damage
  through the MYD88-NF-κB pathway culminating in ARDS, myocarditis and shock. In addition,
  SARS-CoV-2 also leads to a pro-coagulant state through activation of tissue-factor
  pathway and by virtue of a pro-inflammatory state. Statins have a pleotropic response
  and has anti-inflammatory action through (i) reduced MHC-class II expression on
  APCs hence decreased T-cell stimulation, (ii) reduced T-cell activation and (iii)
  downregulation of MYD88-NF-κB pathway. In addition, statins also exert an anti-coagulant
  and vasodilatory effects thus mitigating the adverse effects of “cytokine storm”
  in COVID-19. APCs: Antigen Presenting Cells; ARDS: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome;
  MHC: Major Histocompatibility Complex. Created with BioRender.com.'
