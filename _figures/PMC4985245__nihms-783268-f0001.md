caption: IL-33 signaling pathway. IL-33 first binds to a receptor complex, which is
  composed of ST2L and IL-1RAP. Signaling is induced through the cytoplasmic Toll-inter-leukin
  receptor domain and leads to the recruitment of MyD88; IRAK4 is then recruited to
  MyD88, followed by interaction between IRAK1, IRAK2, and/or IRAK3 to form a complex
  known as the myddosome. This myddosome then interacts with TRAF6 and further activates
  the transcription factors NF-κB or MAPK.
