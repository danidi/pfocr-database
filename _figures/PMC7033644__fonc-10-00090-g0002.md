caption: EV trafficking between leukemia and stromal cells reduces sensitivity to
  chemotherapeutics. (A) Bidirectional trafficking between leukemia and stromal cells
  leads to alterations in both the cellular composition and secretome of the stromal
  compartment. (B) In CML, EV-mediated signaling upregulates the secretion of IL-8
  from BM stromal cells. Increased IL-8 in the leukemic microenvironment increases
  CML cell adhesion, motility, and survival through CXCR1 and CXCR2 engagement, and
  promotes resistance to etoposide. (C) AML cells from the nutrient-depleted leukemic
  microenvironment exhibit marked endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and upregulation
  of BMP-2. AML-EVs transfer BMP-2 and ER-stress to stromal MSCs and OPCs, activating
  the unfolded protein response pathway (UPR). UPR activation induces osteogenic differentiation
  in MSCs and causes increased apoptosis in osteoprogenitor cells, altering the cellular
  composition of the BM, AML survival, and response to chemotherapy.
