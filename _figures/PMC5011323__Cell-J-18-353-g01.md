caption: Insulin receptor signal transduction via PI3K/PKB pathway. Insulin activates
  tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates and recruits different substrate adaptors
  such as the IRS protein family. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS subsequently displays
  binding sites for numerous signaling partners, among which PI3K has a major role
  in insulin function, mainly via the activation of the PKB and the PKC pathways.
  It stimulates glucose uptake in the muscles via translocation of GLUT4 vesicles
  to the plasma membrane through phosphorylation of AS160. Under basal conditions,
  small positive GLUT4 vesicles also contain VAMP2. VAMP2 is involved in the docking
  and fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane and indeed, studies have implicated
  a role for VAMP2 in insulin-dependent trafficking in cell. PI3K; Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  3-kinase, PKB; Protein kinase B, IRS; Insulin receptor substrate, PKC; Protein kinase
  C, GLUT4; Glucose transporter type 4, VAMP2; Vesicle-associated membrane protein
