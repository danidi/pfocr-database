caption: Schematic Representation of FGF4 Signaling Regulated by O-GlcNAc in ESCsPhosphorylated
  PKCζ, the active form, activates the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway by FGF4 stimulation. Thr-410,
  a phosphorylation site, of PKCζ is modified by O-GlcNAc in undifferentiated ESCs,
  and O-GlcNAc on PKCζ inhibits the phosphorylation of PKCζ. In the undifferentiated
  state of ESCs, O-GlcNAc inhibits the activation of the FGF4-PKCζ-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway
  by inhibiting PKCζ phosphorylation. Reduction of OGT induces a reduction in the
  O-GlcNAc level on PKCζ, PKCζ phosphorylation is enhanced by FGF4 stimulation, MEK
  and ERK1/2 are phosphorylated, and consequently phosphorylated ERK1/2 inhibits the
  maintenance of the undifferentiated state of ESCs.
