caption: A sample result following Ingenuity Pathway Analysis with microarray data
  mapped onto known pathways for rapid interpretation of the biological significance
  of experimental data. Protein-protein associations are indicated by edges containing
  single lines, whereas proteins that act upon another protein (controlling their
  expression) are indicated by arrows. Dotted lines represent indirect interactions.
  Proteins having higher expressions in pioglitazone-treated cells are shaded darker
  grey, those with lower expression are shaded lighter grey.
