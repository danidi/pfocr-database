caption: Biosynthetic molecular steps of terreic acid (TA) that were identified by
  heterologous pathway assembly. Speculated transition compounds are boxed. The AtX
  (polyketide synthase) catalyzes formation of polyketide 6-MSA (2); AtA (decarboxylase)
  catalyzes formation of 3-methylcatechol (5) by decarboxylative hydroxylation of
  6-MSA; AtG (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase) helps AtE (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase)
  to catalyze formation of 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol (6); AtD (cyclooxygenase) catalyzes
  formation of terremutin (3) by epoxidation and hydroxyl oxidation of 3-methyl-1,2,4-benzenetriol
  (6); AtC (GMC oxidoreductase) catalyzes formation of the final product, TA (1),
  via a reaction of oxidation of the hydroxyl group in terremutin (3).
