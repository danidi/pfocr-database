caption: The Hexosamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP) and O-GlcNAc Cycling. Glucose enters
  the cells and is enzymatically converted to Glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) by Hexokinase
  (HK). Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI) then converts Glc-6-P to Fructose-6-phosphate
  (Fruc-6-P), after which approximately 95% of it proceeds to glycolysis and 3–5%
  is converted to Glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) by the enzyme Glutamine fructose-6-phosphate
  amidotransferase (GFAT). Glutamine is required for this enzymatic reaction. This
  enzymatic reaction also constitutes the rate-limiting step of the HBP. Glucosamine-6-phosphate
  N-acetyltransferase 1 (GNPNAT1) then utilizes acetyl-CoA to convert GlcN-6-P into
  N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc-6-P). This is then converted to N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate
  (GlcNAc-1-P) by Phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase 1 (AGM1). Uridine triphosphate (UTP)
  is then utilized by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP) to convert GlcNAc-1-P
  to Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT)
  and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) facilitate O-GlcNAc cycling “on and off” serine and threonine
  amino acid residues of target proteins.
