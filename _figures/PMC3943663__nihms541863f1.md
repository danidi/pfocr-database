caption: HIV binding to CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5 allows infection of DC through fusion
  with the cell membrane. However, several restrictions factors (red) prevent efficient
  infection of DC, acting at different stages. TRIM5α binds to the incoming viral
  capsid to perturb its timely disassembly. SAMHD1 very potently blocks HIV infection,
  potentially through depletion of deoxynucleotides necessary for successful reverse
  transcription. APOBEC3G is incorporated into newly made virions, and induces hypermutations
  in newly infected cells during reverse transcription. Tetherin prevents viral budding
  and release. Type I IFN signaling secreted by pDC can potentiate HIV restriction
  (not depicted). Despite low infectivity, DC can participate to CD4+ T cells trans-infection.
  HIV attachment to DC through C-type lectins, such as DC-SIGN, can lead to endocytosis
  and storage of intact virions, or to its retention on the cell surface. HIV into
  multivesicular bodies can be delivered through an exocytic route that converges
  with the exosome dissemination pathway. Alternatively, virions trapped on the surface
  of DC can be directly transmitted to target T cells. The efficiency of trans-infection
  is highly augmented by the formation of an ‘infectious synapse’, which concentrate
  virions and HIV receptors in a limited intercellular region. The interaction between
  the adhesion molecules (LFA-1, ICAM-1) help stabilize the infectious synapse. Newly
  formed virions from infected DC can also bud to be released in the infectious synapse
  and binding to HIV receptors on CD4+ T cells.
