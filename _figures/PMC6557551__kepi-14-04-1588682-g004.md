caption: Cross-talk between one-carbon metabolism and Levodopa catabolism. Diagram
  depicting the effects of dopamine metabolism on the one-carbon metabolic pathway.
  Conversion of levodopa to dopamine requires the breakage of S-adenosyl methionine
  as methyl group donor which is the same source of methyl groups used by DNA methyltransferases
  (DNMTs) to methylation cytosine residues. In addition, homocysteine produced by
  the conversion levodopa-dopamine is an inhibitor of DNMTs activity and may alter
  DNA methylation. COMT further mediates the conversion of dopamine into O-methyl
  derivatives (3-methoxytyramine) by consuming methyl groups from SAM. The potential
  interaction with PD medication is indicated, with Sinemet and Stalevo increasing
  levodopa levels and COMTAN inhibiting COMT activity.
