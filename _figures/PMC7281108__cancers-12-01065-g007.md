caption: Suggested model of nelfinavir’s modes of action related to proteasome synthesis
  and activity. At concentrations ≥40 μM, nelfinavir partially inhibits β1/β5 and
  β2 activity of the proteasome [], thus activating TCF11/Nrf1-dependent proteasome
  re-synthesis (the bounce-back response). At the same time, nelfinavir inhibits UPR-activating
  protease S2P [,], which decreases active levels of the SREBP-1 transcription factor
  that is responsible for activating TCF11/Nrf1 transcription in the nucleus []. Therefore,
  TCF11/Nrf1 gene expression decreases. Furthermore, nelfinavir inhibits TCF11/Nrf1
  proteolytic processing, resulting in lowered TCF11/Nrf1 protein levels in the nucleus.
  This decreases re-synthesis of proteasome genes. However, due to nelfinavir’s ability
  to activate ER and oxidative stress, proteasome re-synthesis might be, at least
  to some extent, re-driven by the Nrf2 pathway.
