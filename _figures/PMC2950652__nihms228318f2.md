caption: Shown are the signaling pathways that regulate the pioneer round of translation
  (top) and subsequent steady-state translation (bottom). Under conditions that activate
  the mTOR signaling pathway, mTORC1 becomes activated and may bind to the translation
  initiation factor eIF3 associated with CBP80-CBP20 (CBC)-bound mRNA resulting in
  the phosphorylation and dissociation of activated S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). The EJC component
  SKAR (S6 kinase 1 ALY-REF-like target) then recruits phosphorylated (i.e., activated)
  S6K1. Activated S6K1 next mediates the phosphorylation of SKAR and other downstream
  effectors, including possibly eIF4B and PDCD4 (programmed cell death factor 4),
  that also associate with CBC-bound mRNA and thereby promote the pioneer round of
  translation for spliced mRNAs. The Cdc42-dependent phosphorylation of S6K1 also
  may promote the binding of CBC to cap structures, which would further stimulate
  the pioneer round. Another CBC-bound mRNA constituent, SF2/ASF, binds to the RNA
  export receptor TAP and also triggers S6K1 signaling via mTORC1 in ways that promote
  CBC-bound mRNA translation. Moreover, PYM interacts with the EJC core proteins Y14-MAGOH
  and with the 40S ribosomal subunit to somehow promote translation of spliced mRNAs
  presumably during and certainly beyond the pioneer round. (Left) The boxes summarize
  the translational regulation of CBC-bound or eIF4E-bound mRNAs under various cell-growth
  conditions. Under conditions of heat shock, hypoxia or serum starvation, the pioneer
  round of translation is favored over steady-state translation; steady-state translation
  is largely inhibited by phosphorylation of eIF2α (not shown) or by binding of 4E-BP1
  to eIF4E.
