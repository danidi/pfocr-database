caption: 'a | Schematic representation of the four human p38 kinases, indicating gene
  names (in parentheses), amino acid numbers and the different domains. The kinase
  domain is 90% identical in amino acid sequence among the four members. The CD domain
  is a negatively charged region involved in high-affinity docking interactions with
  substrates and regulators that contain positively charged docking (D) motifs. The
  ED domain contributes to substrate docking and specificity, being particularly important
  for interactions with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-activated protein
  (MAPKAP) kinase 2 (MK2) and MK3. The ATP binding site and the phosphorylated Thr
  and Tyr residues of the activation loop are also indicated. p38γ has an additional
  carboxy-terminal region that binds to PDZ domain-containing proteins (serving as
  scaffolding proteins for various signalling pathways). p38 kinases are also referred
  to as stress-activated protein kinases: SAPK2a (p38α), SAPK2b (p38β), SAPK3 (p38γ)
  and SAPK4 (p38δ). b | Schematic representation of the three human MAP2Ks involved

  p38 kinase activation pathways. The colour of the phosphates (P) indicates the kinase
  responsible for the phosphorylation. In the canonical pathway, the first step is
  activation of MAP3Ks, which is triggered by various stimuli, encompassing cytokines
  acting via their receptors, ligands of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs; which
  include hormones, metabolites, cytokines and neurotransmitters) and stress signals.
  Mechanistically, MAP3Ks can be activated by multiple mechanisms, including binding
  to RHO, CDC45 and RAC small GTPases, phosphorylation by STE20 kinases and ubiquitylation
  by TRAF ubiquitin ligases, triggering phosphorylation of MAP2K, which in turn phosphorylate
  and activate p38 kinases. In the non-canonical pathways, activation is triggered
  by autophosphorylation of p38α either by binding to proteins such as transforming
  growth factor-β-activated protein 1 (TAB1) (observed in various cell types, but
  the signals responsible for activating this pathway are not well defined (question
  mark)) or by ZAP70 phosphorylation (specific to T cells) downstream of T cell receptor
  (TCR) activation. d | Scheme showing the main mechanisms leading to p38α signal
