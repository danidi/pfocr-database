caption: 'Schematic diagram showing PR/RANKL pathway and downstream RANK-mediated
  signaling in mammary epithelial cells. a Natural or synthetic progesterone binds
  to its receptor in PR-positive breast luminal cell, leading to an increase in RANKL
  protein levels mainly through stabilization of its mRNA. Then, RANKL binds to its
  cognate receptor RANK expressed on the surface of the neighboring PR-negative breast
  luminal cell, activating downstream signaling pathways that promote cell proliferation.
  Basal cells (MECs and MaSCs, drawn in green at the bottom of the figure) constitutively
  express RANK on their surface, but they lack PR. RANKL produced by PR-positive breast
  luminal cells further up-regulates RANK expression on MECs and MaSCs surface, and
  activates RANK-downstream signaling pathways promoting cell proliferation, expansion
  and survival. b RANK-IKK-α-NF-kB-cyclin D1 pathway (1), and RANK-Id2-p21 pathway
  (2) represent the two main signaling pathways activated by RANK in mammary epithelial
  cells. IKK-α catalyzes phosphorylation, ubiquitination and proteasome degradation
  of IkBα, leading to its dissociation from NF-kB, which then migrates to the nucleus
  and induces cyclin D1 transcription. On the other hand, Id2 translocates into the
  nucleus and reduces expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Altogether, these
  molecular events result in increased proliferation and survival of mammary epithelial
  cells. RANK-c is a RANK isoform derived from alternative splicing of RANK gene,
  which has been identified in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumors. It acts
  as a dominant negative regulator of RANK-dependent NF-kB activation, inhibiting
  the NF-kB-mediated cell survival effect and correlating with lower cell motility
  and proliferative index. RANK-c may exert its function through the intracellular
  interaction with other key molecules, such as TRAF2 and EGFR. Notably, RANK-c has
  also been shown to act as a negative regulator of EGFR signaling, inhibiting EGFR
  phosphorylation after EGF ligand stimulation. Abbreviations: EGF, Epidermal growth
  factor; EGFR, Epidermal growth factor receptor; Id2, inhibitor of DNA binding protein
  2; IkBα, inhibitor of kappa Bα; IKK-α, inhibitor-kB kinase-α; LECs, luminal epithelial
