caption: During chronic infections, antigen specific T cells are exhausted due to
  PD-1 inhibitory signals and lack of positive co-stimulation. PD-1 pathway blockade
  promotes T cell activation by shifting the balance of signals delivered by cognate
  APCs from suppressive to activating. When rescued T cells recognize antigen in the
  periphery, in the absence of PD-1 engagement, T cells can assume full effector function
  and eliminate target cells []. Similar mechanisms also occur in cancer patients.
