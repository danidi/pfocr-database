caption: 'The key signaling pathway that regulates mTORC1 and mTORC2 is depicted above.
  mTOR is activated by signaling through the PI3K pathway, regulating cell growth,
  and proliferation. PTEN, TSC1, and TSC2 act as negative regulators of the mTOR pathway
  and inhibition of the aforementioned leads to hyperactivation of mTOR. mTOR1 signaling
  requires activation of the adaptor protein raptor and mTORC2, which is insensitive
  to acute rapamycin treatment, requires activation of rictor protein. Multiple signals
  from growth factors, amino acids, cellular energy status, and stress are integrated
  into mTORC1. Activated mTORC1 plays a major role in promoting cell growth and proliferation
  by stimulating various anabolic processes including protein, lipid, nucleotide synthesis,
  and ribosome biogenesis, and inhibiting catabolic processes such as autophagy. mTORC2
  is regulated by growth factors and although mechanisms are poorly defined, it has
  been linked to cytoskeleton.Abbv: IRS1:Insulin Receptor substrate 1; mTOR: mammalian
  target of rapamycin; PDK1: 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; PTEN:
  Phosphatase and tensin homolog; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; TSC1: TSC Complex
  Subunit 1; TSC2 TSC Complex Subunit 2; RHEB: Ras homolog enriched in brain; S6K1:
  Ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1; eIF4: Eukaryotic initiation factor 4F; 4E-BP1:
