caption: Model for interphase/S phase omission between the two meiotic divisions.
  (A) Model for meiosis in Xenopus oocytes. Both the Mos/MAPK pathway and the absence
  of Wee1 are involved in the omission of interphase/S phase between meiosis I (MI)
  and meiosis II (MII). The Mos/MAPK pathway may function to rapidly reactivate Cdc2
  after MI, thereby suppressing interphase/S phase, whereas the absence of Wee1 in
  MI directly omits interphase/S phase. Either pathway would act to suppress inhibitory
  Tyr-15 phosphorylation of Cdc2 during the MI/MII transition, thereby ensuring direct
  entry into MII. See text for details. (B) Model for meiosis in general. Absence
  of Wee1 is assumed to be the primary mechanism of interphase/S-phase omission between
  MI and MII. The S-phase omission may in turn activate the DNA replication checkpoint
  pathway, which, however, would be cancelled immediately also by the absence of Wee1.
  Large animal oocytes such as Xenopus oocytes may not activate such a replication
  checkpoint pathway due to constraints specific to them. In the other cases, however,
  the pathway may be actually activated, and its cancellation by the absence of Wee1
  may be important for entry into MII. Particularly in cases where the differentiated
  meiotic cells no longer have the ability to replicate DNA, cancellation of the replication
  checkpoint by the absence of Wee1 may be essential for normal entry into MII. (See
  text for details.)
