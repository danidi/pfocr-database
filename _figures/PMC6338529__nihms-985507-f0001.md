caption: 'This diagram summarizes the dendritic signaling pathways (left side) and
  subcellular compartments (right side) that have been suggested to contribute to
  rapid antidepressant responses. Ketamine and scopolamine by stimulating a surge
  of glutamate release, GLYX-13 via NMDA-R modulation, and TLQP-62 via a yet to be
  identified receptor, trigger BDNF release, increase BDNF/TrkB signaling, regulate
  dissociation of RNA binding protein hnRNP K from specific mRNAs, and desuppress
  translation via mTOR and/or eEF2 pathways. Thus, rapid local synthesis and insertion
  of GluR1, and rapid local synthesis and secretion of VGF (TLQP-62) and BDNF, are
  increased, stimulating synaptic plasticity. Identified subcellular compartments
  in dendrites through which receptors for insertion and proteins for secretion are
  trafficked include the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC).
  Vesicles budding from ERGIC that incorporate receptors with immature patterns of
  core glycosylation have been identified as endosomes. Large dense core secretory
  vesicles of the regulated secretory pathway, which could support protein processing
  (e.g. proBDNF to BDNF) remain to be identified. Abbreviations: LDCV, large dense
  core vesicle; Rapa, rapamycin; VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium channel.'
