caption: Mechanisms of FXR regulation of enterohepatic circulation of bile acid. Bile
  acids synthesized in the liver are excreted into bile via BSEP and stored in the
  gallbladder. After each meal, bile acids are excreted into the intestinal tract.
  In the ileum, bile acids are reabsorbed by ASBT in the brush border membrane. Bile
  acids activate FXR to induce IBABP in enterocytes. OSTα/β transporter in the basolateral
  membrane effluxes bile acids to portal circulation to hepatocytes where they are
  taken up by NTCP. In the liver, bile acids activate FXR, which induces SHP expression.
  SHP then inhibits LRH-1 (or human FTF) and HNF4α transactivation of CYP7A1 (FXR/SHP
  pathway 1). In the endocrine pathway, intestinal bile acids activate FXR, which
  induces FGF19 expression. FGF19 may be transported to the liver to activate a liver-specific
  receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR4 (FXR/FGF19/FGFR4 pathway 2). In the autocrine pathway
  (pathway 3), cholestatic bile acids may activate FXR and FGF19/FGFR4 signaling,
  which activates the MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway to inhibit CYP7A1 transcription. It is not
  clear how the FGF19/ERK1/2 pathway downregulates CYP7A1 transcription. The endocrine
  pathway may be a physiological pathway for bile acid inhibition of bile acid synthesis,
  while the autocrine pathway may be an adaptive response to protect liver from cholestatic
  injury. BARE-II contains 18 bp sequence of overlapping HNF4α and FTF (α-fetoprotein
  transcription factor, a human homolog of mouse LRH-1) binding site, which is completely
  conserved in all species.
