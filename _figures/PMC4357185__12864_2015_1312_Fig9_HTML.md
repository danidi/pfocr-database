caption: Pathways mapping of fussed network proteins. Cytoscape 3.0.2 with plugins
  (see  section) are used to generate functionally grouped network of pathways. Grouping
  of significant pathway terms (p ≤ 0.05) were based on kappa score threshold of 0.4,
  initial group size of 2 and sharing group percentage of 50. The pathway network
  consisted of 35 significantly and 7 non-significantly regulated proteins involved
  in distinct pathways which are colour-coded. Note, the two individual terms are
  grey-coloured. Up and down-regulated proteins are coded as orange and green small
  discs, respectively. Up- and down-regulated as well as non-significantly regulated
  proteins and connecting proteins of the network are given as orange, green, yellow
  and blue coloured discs, respectively. The network depicts protein-protein interactions
  in liver tumours of EGFR transgenic mice and their relation to various pathways
  under the influence of EGFR signalling. EGFR is highlighted as blue triangle in
  this network.
