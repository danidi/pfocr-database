caption: Diagram of metabolic interactions between neurons and glia. This diagram
  summarizes neuronal and glial metabolism as well as their interactions revealed
  by SIRM and consistent with the literature. Neurons and glia metabolize glucose
  via glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to generate the neurotransmitter Glu and energy
  (ATP). During brain activation, Glu is released by neurons into the synaptic cleft,
  which is then transported to the surrounding glial end processes via glutamate transport
  1 (GLT1). Once in the glia, Glu is converted to glutamine (Gln) by glutamine synthetase
  (GS). Gln is then released by the glia, transported into the neurons, and converted
  to Glu by phosphate-activated glutaminase (Glnase), which completes the Glu/Gln
  cycle (; ; ; ; ). Lithium stimulates glycolysis and lactate/Ala production as well
  as anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation (PC) in the glia. Both lactate and Ala are
  ultimately transferred to neurons where they are used as oxidative substrates for
  ATP production and/or precursor for Glu synthesis. The neuronal pathways from lactate
  to Glu involve conversion of lactate to pyruvate, followed by either the pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH) or the PC pathway in the Krebs cycle, the latter of which is
  enhanced by lithium. Red glucose depicts [U-13C]-glucose while green lactate and
  Ala represents 13C-3-lactate and 13C-2,3-Ala, respectively. Block arrows indicate
  transport processes. Italicized texts denote enzymes or pathways, red arrows in
  glia indicate glucose-associated pathways activated by lithium, and orange arrow
  in neurons represents activation of PC linked to both lactate and glucose metabolism.
  Black, red, and green dots depict Glu in neurons, synaptic cleft, and glia, respectively
