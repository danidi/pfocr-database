caption: Development of NEPC by the SRRM4-mediated RNA splicing network. The multifaceted
  roles of SRRM4 and SRRM4-mediated alternative RNA splicing of genes highly enriched
  in neuronal functions drives a CRPC-NE program via various aspects important for
  CRPC-NE progression. SRRM4-mediated spliced variants not only facilitate the NE-transdifferentiation
  of CRPC-Ad cells possibly through epigenetic alterations but also promotes cancer
  cell survival, proliferation, and tumorigenesis of CRPC-NE cells to establish CRPC-NE
  tumors. We propose that SRRM4 may function beyond its putative role in RNA splicing
  via mechanisms involving transcriptional factors (e.g., FOXA, REST, and AR), tumor
  suppressors (e.g., RB1 and p53), and microenvironment factors (e.g., therapeutics,
  hypoxia). Potential SRRM4-targeted therapeutic approaches for treating CRPC-NE or
  mitigating its development may be to inhibit the splicing or RNA-binding activity
  of SRRM4 via SMI or target the alternative splicing events via ASO. This multi-functional
  property of SRRM4 ultimately provides cancer cells the ability to develop therapy
  resistance and develop into CRPC-NE tumors. SMI, small molecule inhibitors; ASO,
  antisense oligonucleotides; SSO, splice-switching oligonucleotides; ARPI, androgen
  receptor pathway inhibition; CRPC-Ad, castration-resistant adenocarcinoma prostate
  cancer; NEPC, neuroendocrine prostate cancer; SRRM4, Ser/Arg repetitive matrix 4.
