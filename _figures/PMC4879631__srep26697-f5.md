caption: Normal cell signaling (such as by NF-κB) stimulates the generation of the
  primary microRNA-146a (miR-146a) transcript that is produced in the nucleus aspre-microRNA-146a
  (Pre-miR-146a), which is then shuttled into the cytoplasm and further processed.
  MiR-146a binds to complimentary sequences in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of
  its target mRNA transcript of ROCK1. This results in translational repression of
  ROCK1 protein. Tau phosphorylation (p-Tau) and dephosphorylation are maintained
  in a dynamic balance for normal cell functions. Protein kinases (such as GSK3 etc)
  phosphorylate tau, while phosphorylated PTEN (p-PTEN) dephosphorylates tau. The
  levels of p-PTEN are regulated by the levels of ROCK1 protein, indicating that ROCK1
  plays an important role in tau phosphorylation. In AD (red pathway at right) neuronal
  cells produce more miR-146a that decreases the levels of ROCK1 protein and reduces
  the levels of p-PTEN, impeding tau dephosphorylation. Thus, p-tau accumulates in
  neurons to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), finally leadingto neuronal death
  in AD. Treatment with antagomir neutralizes miR-146a (green box) restoring ROCK1
  protein levels and facilitating appropriate PTEN phosphorylation and tau dephosphorylation.
