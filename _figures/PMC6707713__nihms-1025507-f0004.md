caption: a) HPV infection of basal layer epithelial cells and DDR activation. The
  infection of basal epithelial cells by HPV leads to a constitutive ATM-dependent
  DDR. This may be due to the role of HPV E1 in promoting replication of integrated
  HPV genomes or perhaps promoting DNA damage at other sites through the host genome
  (left). Normally, in this layer, E2 protein suppresses the expression of E6 and
  E7. If E2 is abrogated due to integration, then E7 up-regulation could lead to increased
  S-phase entry promoting the DDR or through direct engagement and activation of ATM
  (bottom, right). b) During vegetative DNA replication upon differentiation of the
  basal keratinocyte layer the ATM pathway is activated and DDR factors co-localize
  with viral genomes (right). ATM and Chk2 activity are important for viral DNA replication
  in this phase of the HPV life cycle. The uppermost layer of keratinocytes in the
  figure indicates virion release (stars).
