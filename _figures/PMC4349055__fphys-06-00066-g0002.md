caption: MicroRNA signaling in TGFβ-induced apoptosis and fibrosis. Apoptosis induction
  after myocardial infarction has been shown to be mediated via TGFβ —microRNA—SMAD
  signaling. Influence of microRNAs on fibrosis has been shown via enhancement of
  collagen synthesis and EndMT. Red arrows indicate enhancement or reduction of the
  respective signaling molecule.  Indicates negative/reducing influence of this pathway.
