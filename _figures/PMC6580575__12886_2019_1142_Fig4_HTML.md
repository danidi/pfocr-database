caption: The mechanistic diagram of NGF and ILM-mediated proliferation promotion by
  regulating cell cycle of Müller cells. ILM co-culture enhanced the activity of Akt
  independent of Trk-A and the downstream p21-CyclinE-CDK2 and CyclinD1-CDK4 signaling
  pathways, leading to cell cycle and cell growth enhancement. NGF exposure mediated
  the activation of Trk-A and further promoted the upregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway
  followed by the increase of CyclinD1-CDK4, and by the decrease of p21 and CyclinE-CDK2
  kinase complex activities, which then induced cell cycle progression and cell growth
  promotion in Müller cells
