caption: PARP inhibitors cause DNA DSB (double strand break) by via inhibition of
  PARP enzyme activity and PARP trapping. In HR (homologous recombination) competent
  tumors, tumor cells with intact homologous recombination repair will be able to
  survive. However, in BRCA1/2 mutant and other HR deficient cancers that are reliant
  on base-excision repair based on the PARP pathway, blockade of this pathway by PARP
  inhibition leads to synthetic lethality and cell death. Multiple resistance mechanisms
  against PARP inhibitors have been elucidated, including somatic mutations in p53BP1
  (a); upregulation of drug efflux transporters such as PgP (b); and somatic mutations
  in BRCA gene leading to restoration of the open reading frame and thus BRCA function
  (c). Strategies to overcome resistance include intermittent dosing, combination
  strategies and drug modification to reduce drug efflux. Various combination strategies
  are currently underway to further exploit the role of PARP inhibitors, including
  combination with chemotherapy (i); radiation therapy (ii); targeted agents (iii)
  and immunotherapy (iv).
