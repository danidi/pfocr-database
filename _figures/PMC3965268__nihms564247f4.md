caption: 'Model of bile duct regeneration in different disease conditions. Stem cell
  niches are located in the canals of Hering and peribiliary glands. Different events
  and diseases lead the damage of different cell population. The Wnt signalling plays
  important role in stem cell expansion. Moreover, bipotent cells differentiate into
  cholangiocytes after the activation of Notch pathway. During cholangiopathies only
  large cholangiocytes are the target cells of the damage and they start to proliferate
  leading to the activation and proliferation of small cholangiocytes. During some
  conditions such as ‘ductopenic diseases’, the number of small and large bile ducts
  is reduced leading the activation of the hepatic progenitor cells. HPC: hepatic
  stem/progenitor cells; BTSC: biliary tree stem cells; PBC: primary biliary cirrhosis;
  PSC: primary sclerosing cholangitis. (A color version of this figure is available
  in the online journal)'
