caption: 'Proteins co-associated with hyaluronidase (HYAL)-2 have roles in actin organization
  and contraction function. A: Functional protein–protein association networks of
  proteins identified from HYAL2 co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Protein
  web was created using the STRING online database version 10.5. B: Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional pathway of actin cytoskeleton organization.
  Depth of green indicates strength of HYAL2–protein association, as determined by
  tandem mass spectrometry peptide identification (where darker green indicates stronger
  evidence of association). Previously demonstrated HYAL2 associations are highlighted
  by stars. Pathway map was generated using KEGG Mapper version 2.8 prior to adaption.
