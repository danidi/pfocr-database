caption: The proposed model for Cck1 function. In our model, Cck1 regulates multiple
  downstream pathways and is essential for fungal virulence. Cck1 is regulated by
  glucose. It may participate in the phosphorylation of Fbp1 substrates to regulate
  cell integrity and fungal virulence. In addition, Cck1 may also play a more direct
  role in regulating Mpk1 signaling, or it regulates Mpk1 function via its target
  protein(s) in the Fbp1 pathway. Meanwhile, Cck1 also responds to stress signals
  and plays a role in the HOG pathway by regulating the phosphorylation of Hog1 protein
  and thus controls the cell adaptation to osmotic shock. Cck1 also regulates fungal
  mating, but its potential target(s) remains to be identified.
