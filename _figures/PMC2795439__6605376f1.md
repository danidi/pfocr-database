caption: 'Androgen-receptor signalling in normal prostate and PCa. Free (unbound)
  testosterone crosses the plasma membrane phospholipid layer presumably by simple
  diffusion (reaction 1). Once inside the prostate cell, testosterone undergoes metabolism
  by the 5α-reductase enzyme to produce the more potent androgen 5α-DHT (reaction
  2). 5α-DHT binds to the androgen receptor (AR) and causes the AR to undergo activation
  and transformation, which involves dissociation from heat-shock proteins and conformational
  (dimerisation) and biochemical changes such as phosphorylation (reaction 3 and 4).
  The activated and transformed 5α-DHT.AR complex translocates into the nucleus (reaction
  5) and interacts with the androgen response element. The 5α-DHT.AR complex binds
  to the specific DNA response elements (reaction 6) leading to recruitment of coactivators
  or corepressors to regulate gene expression (reaction 7). We postulate that in the
  normal prostate, the activation of AR results in downregulation of the expression
  of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mRNA (reaction 7), resulting in reduced
  EGFR protein synthesis (reaction 8) and the ultimate reduction of the active functional
  protein (reaction 9). In PCa, we propose that either a molecular switch is turned
  off along this pathway, probably in regulating gene expression (reaction 7; denoted
  by +blue colour), resulting in increased mRNA synthesis and increased protein synthesis
  and increased density of the functional EGFR (reactions 8 and 9). Further, in PCa,
  activation of EGFR by EGF results in signalling through a host of biochemical pathways
  (reactions 10–13), which result in activation of AR even in the absence of 5α-DHT.
  Such a switch in EGFR expression and functional activity results in tumour androgen
  independence. The loss of androgen regulation concomitant with increased EGFR expression
  or signalling in PCa through the PI3K and MAPK pathways results in androgen independence
  of tumour growth. These signalling pathways may activate the AR without ligand,
  culminating in androgen-receptor signalling, leading to cellular proliferation,
  migration, and survival. The references for the reactions cited in  are as follows:
