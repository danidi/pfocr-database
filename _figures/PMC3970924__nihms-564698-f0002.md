caption: 'Molecular pathology of FLS in RA. Upward and downward arrows indicate changed
  functional levels of the corresponding protein in RA FLS (cultured FLS derived from
  patients with RA) versus osteoarthritis and/or normal FLS. a | Enhanced MAPK signalling
  increases production of MMPs and cytokines in RA. The JNK pathway is shown; analogous
  cascades in the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways are not shown. Ligation of surface receptors
  activates the MAPK pathway, leading to phosphorylation of JNKs and increased expression
  of genes such as MMP genes. JNKs are hyperactive in RA FLS, whereas GADD45β expression
  is reduced; SRC and RAF activity are increased, which further contributes to JNK
  activation. b | Activation of the NFκB pathway is increased in RA FLS. Stimulation
  of surface receptors increases IKKβ activation, leading to degradation of IκB. Nuclear
  translocation of NFκB leads to transcription of proinflammatory genes. Increased
  activation of NFκB activity in RA is promoted, in part, by overexpression of PI3K
  and/or decreased expression of PTEN in the RA synovium. c | Damage to key regulators
  including mitochondrial genes and p53 underlies the reduced tendency of RA FLS to
  undergo apoptosis. Increased activation and/or expression of c-FLIP and Bcl-2 and
  altered sumoylation contribute to enhanced survival of RA FLS. Abbreviations: Bcl-2,
  apoptosis regulator Bcl-2; c-FLIP, cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein; ERK,
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FASL, FAS ligand; FLS, fibroblast-like synoviocytes;
  GADD45β, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GADD45β; IκB, inhibitor
  of NFκB; IKKβ, IκB kinase β; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; MKK7, MAPK kinase 7; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; NFκB, nuclear
  factor κB; p53, cellular tumour antigen p53; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN,
  phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase and dual-specificity protein
  phosphatase; PUMA, p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis; RAF, RAF proto-oncogene
  serine/threonine-protein kinase; SRC, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src;
  TAK1, transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1; TLR, Toll-like receptor.'
