caption: Up-regulation of the cAMP pathway in LC as a mechanism of opiate tolerance
  and dependence. Top panel, Opiates acutely inhibit the functional activity of the
  cAMP pathway (indicated by cellular levels of cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation).
  With continued opiate exposure, functional activity of the cAMP pathway gradually
  recovers, and increases far above control levels following removal of the opiate
  (e.g., by administration of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone). These changes
  in the functional state of the cAMP pathway are mediated via induction of adenylyl
  cyclases (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA) in response to chronic administration of
  opiates. Induction of these enzymes accounts for the gradual recovery in the functional
  activity of the cAMP pathway that occurs during chronic opiate exposure (tolerance
  and dependence) and activation of the cAMP pathway observed on removal of opiate
  (withdrawal). Bottom panel, Opiates acutely inhibit LC neurons by increasing the
  conductance of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel via coupling with subtypes of Gi/o
  and, possibly, by decreasing a Na+-dependent inward current via coupling with Gi/o
  and the consequent inhibition of AC, reduced levels of PKA activity, and reduced
  phosphorylation of the channel or pump responsible. Inhibition of the cAMP pathway
  also decreases the phosphorylation of many other proteins and, thereby, affects
  numerous other neuronal processes. For example, it reduces the phosphorylation state
  of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which initiates some of the longer-term
  changes in LC function. Chronic administration of morphine increases the levels
  of ACI, ACVIII, PKA catalytic (cat.) and regulatory subunits, and several phosphoproteins,
  including CREB and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (indicated by red arrows). These changes
  contribute to the altered phenotype of the drug-addicted state. For example, the
  intrinsic excitability of LC neurons is increased by enhanced activity of the cAMP
  pathway and Na+-dependent inward current, which contributes to the tolerance, dependence,
  and withdrawal showed by these neurons. Up-regulation of ACVIII and TH is mediated
  via CREB, whereas up-regulation of ACI and of the PKA subunits appears to occur
  via an unidentified, CREB-independent mechanism.
