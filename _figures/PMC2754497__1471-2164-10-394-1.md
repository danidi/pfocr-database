caption: Model of Fe(II) oxidation in A. ferrooxidans ATCC 23270. The flow of electrons
  is shown from the oxidation of Fe+2 by Cyc2 to reduce oxygen via the aa3 complex
  (downhill pathway) or to reduce NAD+ via bc1/quinone pool/NADH complex (uphill pathway).
  The downhill pathway can consume protons entering via the ATPase complex helping
  to drive ATP synthesis or via the bc1/quinone pool/NADH complex that drives the
  flow of electrons in the uphill pathway. The switch point between the downhill and
  uphill flow is suggested to be at the level of rusticyanin (Rus). Abbreviations
  used can be found in the text.
