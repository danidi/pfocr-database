caption: Schematic of the base excision repair pathways present in mitochondria. The
  damaged base is excised by a glycosylase to create an abasic site. APE1 endonuclease
  generates a strand break leaving a 5′ deoxyribose phosphate (5′ dRP) downstream
  of the lesion. Pol γ participates in either the single-nucleotide (SN-BER) or the
  long patch (LP-BER) base excision repair pathway. In SN-BER, Pol γ fills the nucleotide
  gap and removes the 5′ dRP, allowing for ligation by Ligase III. In LP-BER, Pol
  γ performs strand-displacement synthesis producing a 5′ flap that is excised by
  DNA2 and FEN1. The resulting substrate is ligated by Ligase III
