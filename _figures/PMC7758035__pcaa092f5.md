caption: Regulation of GA biosynthesis and inactivation, highlighting the GA signal
  transduction pathway that enables GA homeostasis. The figure summarizes the data
  for Arabidopsis. GA signaling promotes the degradation of the DELLA transcriptional
  regulator, which in association with the transcription factor GAF1 upregulates the
  expression of genes encoding GA20ox and GA3ox, as well as the GA receptor GID1.
  Some pathways for the regulation of GA metabolism in response to environmental signals
  are also indicated.
