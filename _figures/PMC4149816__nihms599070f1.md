caption: (A) In the absence of BMP binding (top panel), BMP receptors type I and II
  do not associate, and the Smad transcription factors remain in the cytoplasm. (B)
  BMP typically binds to the type II receptor (bottom panel), which allows type I
  and II receptors dimerize and the type II receptor to phosphorylate the type I receptor.
  However, in some cases, the BMP ligand has a higher affinity for the type I receptor,
  and this binding will then induce dimerization and subsequent phosphorylation. This
  phosphorylation of the type I receptor leads to the phosphorylation of downstream
  Smads, canonically Smads 1/5/8, which then associate with the co-Smad, Smad4, and
  translocate into the nucleus. The Smad complex will bind to BMP response elements
  and induce the transcription of downstream targets. (C) The recently discovered
  type III receptors can compete with the type II receptors and form a complex with
  the type I receptors. This association leads to endocytosis-mediated recycling of
  the ligand-receptor complex to the membrane, which amplifies the BMP signaling pathway.
  (D–F) Although the canonical pathway is seemingly straightforward, a single ligand
  can have numerous effects and outcomes in endothelial cells. Depicted here are the
  effects of BMP2 (D), BMP4 (E), and BMP9 (F) specifically via BMPRII. Each ligand
  can signal through the canonical Smad1 or through a different intracellular cascade.
  Further, even a single ligand can have opposing effects on a single behavior (e.g.,
  BMP9 and proliferation) via the intracellular signaling cascade that is activated.
  For simplicity, type I and type III receptors, if identified, as well as downstream
  targets have been omitted.
