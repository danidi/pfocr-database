caption: 'The current model for glucose-responsive system (GRS). The indicated pathways
  were previously identified: in vivo association of CshA with RNAP (), glucose-stimulated
  CshA acetylation and sigX regulation (; ), CshA-dependent PylxS regulation driving
  YlxR expression, which regulates metabolic genes (), and transcriptional regulation
  of tsaEBD through the functional YlxR-binding to the promoter of tsaEBD, whose products
  are assembled and regulate pyruvate dehydrogenase translation (). Pyruvate dehydrogenase
  provides acetyl-CoA, which would be the acetyl moiety source for CshA acetylation.
  In the tsaD disruptant grown with glucose cellular acetyl-CoA pool was reduced ().
  Each pathway is supported by experimental evidence, however, considering the whole
  regulatory cascade there is a room for further verification. Arrows indicate transcription,
  translation, acetylation, enzymatic reaction, transcriptional activation or metabolic
  reaction. T-bars indicate transcriptional repression. Ac, acetyl moiety; RNAP, RNA
  polymerase.'
