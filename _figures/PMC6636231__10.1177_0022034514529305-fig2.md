caption: A proposed working model of RGS proteins in the regulation of the Ca2+ oscillation-NFATc1
  signal pathway for osteoclast (OC) differentiation. We propose that RGS10 and RGS12
  play different functions in the regulation of Ca2+ oscillations and OC differentiation.
  RGS10 competitively binds with Ca2+/CaM and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate
  (PIP3) in a Ca2+-dependent manner to internally regulate calcium release from the
  ER; conversely, RGS12 might interact with Ca2+ channels and CaR at the cell membrane
  to regulate calcium influx during OC differentiation (Yang and Li, 2007a). Thus,
  RGS10 and RGS12 respectively regulate periodic Ca2+ influx and the ER internal release
  of Ca2+ and contribute to the generation and maintenance of Ca2+ oscillations and
  OC differentiation. RGS, regulator of G protein signaling; OC, osteoclast; CaM,
  calmodulin; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
  CaR, calcium-sensing receptor.
