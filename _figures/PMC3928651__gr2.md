caption: N-Linked Glycosylation Pathway Showing Activation of Precursor Molecules
  and Synthesis of Dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc2Man9Glc3 and Transfer to ProteinEarly steps
  in the N-linked pathway require conversion of the lipid molecule polyprenol to the
  oligosaccharide carrier molecule dolichol, which serves as a scaffold for LLO. Monosaccharides
  activated in the cytoplasm are used as substrates for several glycosyltransferases
  that extend the growing chain. Once dolichol-P-P-GlcNAc2Man5 is formed, it flips
  into the ER lumen and is further extended to the final product with Dol-P-Man and
  Dol-P-Glc as donors for different mannosyl- and glucosyl-transferases, respectively.
  The oligosaccharyltransferase complex then transfers the completed structure onto
  nascent polypeptides. The processing of N-glycans is not shown. Genetic defects
  within this pathway are shown by an X. This figure was adapted from Figure 42.1
