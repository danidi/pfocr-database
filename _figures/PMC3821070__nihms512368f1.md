caption: Diagram representing evolutionary time (large arrow) together with host death
  pathways targeted by known virus-encoded cell death suppressors. Intrinsic apoptosis
  is a primordial property of multicellular organisms to eliminate excess cells during
  development that contributes to host defense. Herpesviruses, poxviruses and adenoviruses
  encode mitochondrial cell death suppressors that limit the impact of pro-apoptotic
  BCL2 family member signaling in host defense [–,]. Extrinsic apoptosis represents
  an adaptation to avoid virus-encoded inhibitors of mitochondrial apoptosis, by employing
  Casp8 as a self-activating protease that can directly target executioner caspases,
  Casp3 and Casp7. Herpesviruses, poxviruses and adenoviruses acquired suppressors
  of Casp8 that limit the contribution of extrinsic apoptosis to elimination of virus-infected
  cells. Programmed necrosis represents an adaptation to take advantage of Casp8 inhibition,
  by opening a trap door via any of three signaling platforms, RIP1-RIP3, DAIRIP3
  and TRIF-RIP3. Some viruses, such as vaccinia, remain susceptible to programmed
  necrosis; whereas, other viruses, such as murine CMV, encode suppressors that limit
  the impact of this pathway.
