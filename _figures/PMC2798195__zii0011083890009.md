caption: Proposed mechanism for pathogenesis due to H. pylori LPS. H. pylori LPS upregulates
  TLR4 and augments cell proliferation via TLR2 and the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway
  in gastric epithelial cells. These activities likely enhance the inflammatory response
  by increasing the activity of LPS from strains with high endotoxic activity, as
  well as tumorigenesis.
