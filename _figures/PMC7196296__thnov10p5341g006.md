caption: Regulation of smooth muscle myosin activity in the precapillary smooth muscle
  cells. SMM is the final effector of small vessel constriction. Actomyosin contraction
  is regulated through dynamic phosphorylation pattern of myosin light-chains mediated
  by myosin light-chain kinases (MLCK) and phosphatases (MLCP). Both MLCK and MLCP
  are under the complex control of several upstream regulators (e.g. Rho-associated
  kinase (ROCK) and norepinephrine (NE)). However, ROCK is a central hub protein,
  which modulates essential cellular processes such as protein synthesis, cell growth
  and cytoskeleton regulation, thus, ROCK inhibition to achieve SMC relaxation would
  lead to wide range of side effects. By contrast, direct inhibition of myosin by
  AmBleb (yellow triangles) can relax SMC contraction independently from upstream
  signaling pathways as we demonstrated in Figure  that AmBleb induced actomyosin
  relaxation could not be overcome by vasoconstriction signaling from NE pathway.
