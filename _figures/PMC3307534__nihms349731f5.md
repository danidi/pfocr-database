caption: Time course of the effect of VCD on the KIT signaling pathway. mRNA and protein
  samples were examined from neonatal rat ovaries ± VCD (30 μM) on days 2, 4, 6, and
  8 of culture. Relative to controls, two days of VCD exposure decreased post-translational
  events (phosphorylation of KIT and AKT). Relative to controls, four days of VCD
  exposure decreased in mRNA encoding KIT, along with a decrease in AKT mRNA (post-transcriptional
  effects). Relative to controls, six days of VCD exposure increased in mRNA encoding
  KITLG and caused small follicle loss.
