caption: Yeast cell cycle KEGG pathway and reconstructed network by three different
  algorithms. a) is the yeast cell cycle KEGG pathway; b) is the TNSI inferred graph;
  c) is the TimeDelay-ARACNE inferred graph; d) is the Banjo inferred graph. TSNI
  and Banjo are used with default settings reported in their manuals. TimeDelay-ARACNE
  better recover this yeast network topology than other algorithms. Here we represent
  true positives as straight connections, dotted lines are false positives, false
  negatives are not reported and considered in the tables of PPV and recall. Missing
  verse on the connection means that the algorithm recovers the wrong verse.
