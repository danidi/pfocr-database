caption: Regulation of yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator
  with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) activity goes well beyond the core kinases in the Hippo
  pathway. a | The liver kinase B1 (LKB1)–microtubule affinity-regulating kinase (MARK)
  pathway inhibits YAP and TAZ through scribble homologue (SCRIB)-mediated activation
  of mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1), MST2, large tumour suppressor 1
  (LATS1) and LATS2. LKB1 tumour suppressor directly phosphorylates and activates
  substrates of the MARK family kinases to induce membrane localization of the basolateral
  polarity complex containing SCRIB. This relocalization of SCRIB activates the MST–LATS
  canonical Hippo kinase cascade to induce phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of
  YAP and TAZ. LKB1 also regulates the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)–mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to confer its tumour suppressor function. In
  addition, YAP and TAZ inhibition mediated by the LKB1–MARK pathway can suppress
  mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) function by restricting the transcription of micro-RNA 29
  (miR-29), which inhibits the translation of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN),
  an upstream negative regulator of mTOR. b | Gαq- and Gα11-coupled receptor signals
  activate YAP and TAZ through RHO and/or RAC-regulated signalling circuitry. Cancer-associated
  Gαq and Gα11 mutants activate RHO to inhibit LATS through actin cytoskeleton reorganization,
  resulting in dephosphorylation and activation of YAP. Gαq also stimulates triple
  functional domain protein (TRIO)–RHO and TRIO–RAC signalling to promote actin polymerization,
  which causes the dissociation of angiomotin (AMOT)–YAP complexes through AMOT binding
  to filamentous actin (F-actin), thereby contributing to YAP nuclear translocation.
  Phosphorylation of AMOT by LATS prevents AMOT binding to F-actin, which potentiates
  its inhibitory effects on YAP and TAZ activity. c | YAP and TAZ are transcriptionally
  inactivated by the tumour suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). WNT stimulation
  or loss of APC causes YAP and TAZ nuclear localization and activation of YAP–TEA
  domain family member (TEAD)-dependent and TAZ–TEAD-dependent transcription. d |
  Inhibitors that suppress YAP and TAZ function. Verteporfin abrogates the interaction
  between YAP and TEAD, thus inhibiting YAP-induced transcription. Vestigial-like
  family member 4 (VGLL4) directly competes with YAP in binding to TEAD, and a peptide
  mimicking this function of VGLL4 is capable of functioning as a YAP antagonist.
  The mevalonate cholesterol biosynthesis pathway provides a source of geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate, which is required for membrane localization and activation of RHO
  GTPases. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA
  reductase) by statins reduces the geranylgeranylation and membrane localization
  of RHO GTPases, restricting YAP and TAZ nuclear accumulation and thus activity.
