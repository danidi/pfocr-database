caption: Canonical nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. In the canonical pathway,
  phosphorylation of IκB kinase α/β by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is
  followed by phosphorylation of IκB-α that occurs in an inactive complex with p50/p65.
  Phosphorylated IκB-α is released and degraded in the cytoplasm. The active heterodimer
  of p50/p65 enters the nucleus to regulate expression of multiple genes. IκB, inhibitory
  kappa B; IKK, inhibitory kappa B kinase; P, phosphorylation.
