caption: 'Co-expression of AML1-ETO and mutant RAS is incompatible with hematopoietic
  stem cell (HSC) maintenance. (A) In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, HSC express
  AML1-ETO, but this is not sufficient to cause overt disease. AML leukemic blasts
  represent myeloid progenitors harboring the translocation that have undergone secondary
  oncogenic events, including mutations in signaling pathway genes such as the K-RASG12D/+.
  However, prior to Di Genua et al., the molecular explanation for the lack of mutations
  in signaling pathway genes in the pre-leukemic stem cells was unknown. HSC (purple
  cells), myeloid progenitors (purple cells with pink dots). (B) Di Genua et al. generated
  conditional murine knock-in models expressing human AML1-ETO and K-RAS(G12D) individually
  or in combination: Aml1ETO/+ (purple nuclei), K-RasG12D/+ (pink nuclei), and Aml1ETO/+
  K-RasG12D/+(pink and dotted nuclei), respectively, and performed competitive transplantation
  assays to compare wild-type and transgenic stem cell activity and measure global
  gene expression as indicated. (C) Model of step-wise oncogenesis in t(8;21) patients:
  the presence of t(8;21) in HSC results in a quiescent phenotype. Acquisition of
  K-RAS(G12D) occurs at later stages and results in increased proliferation. However,
  the double oncogenic event is not sufficient to develop overt AML, and the nature
  and order of acquisition of additional oncogenic events remains unknown.'
