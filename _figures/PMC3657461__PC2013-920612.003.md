caption: The PI3K/AKT signaling in prostate cancer. PI3K/AKT can induce enhanced activation
  of cancer cells by direct downstream effects. At the same time, this pathway (and
  downstream target genes) might affect the action of ERKs, which could lead to inhibition
  of AR-dependent activation, thus favoring an AR-independent growth. Conversely,
  AR pathway target genes can limit the PI3K/AKT pathway, favoring an AR-dependent
  tumor growth. A deregulated PI3K pathway (usually due to mutated or null PTEN) can
  also inhibit the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway, through enhanced activation of AKT. PI3K/AKT
  can also enhance the presence of stable metalloproteinase receptors (MT1-MMP), which
  favors invasive and metastatic phenotypes for these tumor cells. TGFβ signaling
  (through TGFβ3 ligation) can have a dual role in PI3K/AKT in PCa cells; for instance,
  benign cell lines enhance the expression of AKT and subsequent activation of this
  pathway following TGFβ3 engagement; malignant cell lines enhance PTEN expression
  in response to TGFβ3 engagement. Finally, N-cadherin enhanced expression in PCa
  cells leads to enhanced production of CCL2, which avoids autophagy in part through
  PI3K/AKT pathway.
