caption: The FbiA, B and C are Mycobacterial proteins whereas the CofA, B, C, D, E,
  G and H are Archaeal proteins involved in the biosynthetic reactions. The pathway
  to formation of the activated phospholactate moiety (LPPG) is yet to be experimentally
  established in Mycobacteria. In some Archaeal species an α–linked terminal glutamate
  residue caps the γ–linked poly–glutamate tail, the addition of which is catalyzed
  by CofF.
