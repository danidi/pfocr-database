caption: Schematic of patient cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 infections based on the severity
  of COVID-19 and underlying IFN responses. The effective or dysregulated interferon
  (IFN) response underlies the development of severe and life-threatening COVID-19.
  The dysregulation of IFN response can progressively result from the viral antagonism/virulence,
  preexisting comorbidities, gender/age inclination, and exacerbated hyper inflammation,
  with the extremal genetic flaws impairing the IFN signaling pathway. Hence, the
  prophylactic or therapeutic effect of IFN therapies should be designed and more
  dependent on the spatiotemporal kinetics of IFN responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection
  and the disease progression. In addition to its evolving antagonism to divert the
  host IFN response, the high contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 also comes from the efficient
  virus infection and spreading by the non-hospitalized individuals who are asymptomatic
  or only have mild signs.
