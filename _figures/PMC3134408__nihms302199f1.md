caption: A model for the proposed molecular pathways in arterial, venous and lymphatic
  specification in a developing embryo. Schematics on the left portion of the figure
  illustrate anatomic correlates of the molecular pathways described in the central
  flow diagram. The bars on the right portion of the figure highlight developmental
  correlates to the molecular pathways. Shh expression in the notchochord triggers
  VEGF expression by the somites and creation of a VEGF gradient. High levels of VEGF
  activate PLCγ and induce arterial specification by activating the MEK/ERK pathway
  through the VEGFR1-NRP1 receptor complex, and the PI3K/AKT pathway in cells residing
  further ventral. Arterial specification proceeds with activation of Foxc1/2 and
  Notch signaling, inducing ephrinB2 and Nrp-1expression. Nrp-1 creates a positive
  feedback loop by acting as co-receptor for VEGF. Venous specification occurs when
  ERK is suppressed, and COUP-TFII induced, by AKT. COUP-TFII inhibits arterial specification
  by down-regulating Notch and Nrp-1, allowing expression of venous-specific markers
  including Nrp-2. A subpopulation of venous EC subsequently express Sox18 and Prox1,
  resulting in lymphatic EC specification. The upper schematic highlights the migration
  of angioblasts and subsequent development, directed by VEGF concentrations, of the
  DA and PCV; the middle schematic the importance of activation of the Notch pathway
  by cleavage and nuclear translocation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor;
  and the lower schematic the requirement of cell-to-cell communication via ephrin-Eph
  receptor kinases in maintaining arterial/venous discrimination. T, neural tube;
  M, lateral mesoderm; S, somite; N, notochord; ICM, inner cell mass. Full details
  are found in the text.
