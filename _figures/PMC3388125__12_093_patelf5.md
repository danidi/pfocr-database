caption: Antiinflammatory mechanisms of tissue-protective molecules. The antiinflammatory
  mechanism of EPOR-βcR activation is associated with (a) the activation of the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, which leads to the inhibition of the activation
  of GSK-3β, which subsequently suppresses NF-κB activity leading to reduced expression
  of the NF-κB–driven gene transcription of proinflammatory mediators; (b) in parallel
  inhibition of the MAPK-p38 signaling pathway, which subsequently suppresses the
  production of proinflammatory mediators; and (c) the activation of the PI3K-Akt
  signaling pathway, which leads to increased activation of eNOS, resulting in an
  enhanced formation of NO.
