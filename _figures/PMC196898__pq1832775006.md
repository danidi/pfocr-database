caption: A model depicting NF-κB-mediated innate antiviral response independent of
  IFN. Rapid activation of NF-κB by viruses like HPIV-3 via the MyD88 pathway early
  during infection in a replication-independent manner confers an intracellular antiviral
  state in the infected cells (Left). Similarly, viruses like RSV that induce NF-κB
  late after infection in a replication-dependent manner, produce TNF-α and/or IL-1β,
  which, by means of the paracrine mechanism, may prime uninfected cells (Right) after
  binding to its cognate receptors to establish an NF-κB-dependent antiviral state.
  In addition, exogenously added TNF-α or IL-1β, and the production of these cytokines
  after secondary adaptive response by immune cells, could prime uninfected cells
  to activate NF-κB-mediated antiviral response against viruses like VSV that do not
  induce NF-κB. TNFR, TNF-α receptor; IL-1βR, IL-1β receptor.
