caption: (A) Upon entry into the mammalian hosts, Leishmania parasites first come
  in contact with the complement system. Once the complement pathway is activated,
  C3b facilitates C5b-C9 membrane attack complex (MAC) on the Leishmania surface and
  lyses the parasite. Conversely, Leishmania virulence factor LPG inhibits MAC complex
  formation on the surface, while GP63 inactivates C3b (iC3b) and inhibits MAC complex.
  Opsonization of Leishmania by C3b and iC3b facilitates its uptake by CD11b and FcγR
  receptor on neutrophils and macrophages. (B) TLR2 and TLR4 on macrophage recognize
  Leishmania outside, whereas TLR3 and TLR9 recognizes Leishmania in the vacuole.
  Activation of TLRs activates the NFκB and MAP kinase signaling through MyD88 which
  is important for Leishmania clearance. In the cytoplasm, NLRP3 inflammasome senses
  Leishmania to produce IL-1β and IL-18, which can have diverse cellular functions
  depending on the genetic background of the host.
