caption: Metabolic pathways involved in lactate-based or ethanol-based chain elongation
  and production of acetate, n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, and n-caproate as predicted
  from the genome annotation of strains BL-3, BL-4, and BL-6. Enzyme abbreviations
  (see  for full names) are provided in red letters next to the pathways (solid lines).
  The numbers below the enzyme names indicate the strains that were predicted to harbor
  the corresponding CDSs, i.e., “3” refers to strain BL-3, “4” refers to strain BL-4
  and “6” refers to strain BL-6. The dashed line represents multi-enzyme reactions
  between the two indicated molecules, and “cycle” refers to the reverse β-oxidation.
  The conversion of the terminal acyl-CoA to the corresponding fatty acid can be catalyzed
  by CoAT or alternatively by ACT as shown at the example of butyrate. A third way
  of butyrate formation from butyryl-CoA proceeds via phosphate butyryltransferase
  (PTB) and butyrate kinase (BUK). The predicted pathway of iso-butyrate formation
  via isomerization of n-butyryl-CoA by butyryl-CoA:isobutyryl-CoA mutase (BM) is
  shown; an alternative hypothetical pathway for iso-butyrate formation from lactate
  is depicted in .
