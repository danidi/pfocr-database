caption: HERPUD1 Ingenuity Pathway Analysis illustrates interactions between indicated
  proteins. The shaded symbols indicate proteins encoded by transcripts that are more
  abundant in KB embryos. The unshaded symbols were not identified as differentially
  expressed but were integrated into the computationally generated networks on the
  basis of evidence stored in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis knowledge memory indicating
  relevance to this network. The symbol shapes denote enzymes (diamond), kinases (triangle),
  transcription factors (ellipse), transporters (trapezoid), and other (circle).
