caption: TLR4 in the pathophysiology of AKI. Activation of TLR4 signaling pathway
  has been observed in different types of AKI. On the one hand, models that reduce
  renal blood flow generate an increase of TLR4 expression in endothelial, tubular
  and leukocyte cells. Endothelial dysfunction is a common mechanism in all types
  of AKI. This dysfunction leads to an increase in the expression of cell-adhesion
  molecules, activation of the innate immune response (neutrophils and macrophages)
  and the concomitant maintenance of oxidative stress. On the other hand, the presence
  and/or release of endo/exotoxins in some AKI, allows the development of endothelial
  dysfunction as well as activation of platelets and complement cascade, which obstruct
  glomerular blood flow, decreasing glomerular filtration rate. Other pathological
  changes detected in different types of AKI are largely observed in the tubulointerstitial
  space, mainly related to accumulation of toxins. The maintenance of a partial and/or
  total obstruction in the urinary tract, either by an exogenous (e.g., prostatic
  hyperplasia) or endogenous mechanism (e.g., detritus overload), produces an increase
  in luminal pressure, dilation of the collecting ducts, loss of functional units
  and development of tubulointerstial fibrosis. The pre-renal, intrarenal and post-renal
  manifestations are closely linked and the affection of one compartment has a direct
  impact on the others, enhancing the severity of AKI. Created with BioRender.com.
