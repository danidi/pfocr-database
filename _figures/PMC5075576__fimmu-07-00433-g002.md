caption: Complement-dependent cytotoxicity and inflammation. (A) High titers of antidonor
  HLA antibodies, particularly of the efficient complement-fixing subclasses IgG1
  and IgG3, may promote terminal classical complement pathway activation. Complement
  activation must overcome the regulatory factors and push complement activation to
  terminal MAC formation and cell damage. (B) Lower titers of antibody or less efficient
  complement-fixing subclasses, such as IgG2, may result in truncated complement activation,
  with upstream anaphylatoxin release and opsonin deposition. The initiator C1 complex,
  composed of globular C1q, embedded with catalytically active C1r and C1s, recognizes
  the Fc portion of IgM and most of the IgG subclasses, triggering a conformational
  change in the hexameric shape of the C1 complex. This activates the autocatalytic
  cleavage of C1r, which then activates C1s. C4 and C2 are cleaved by C1s, forming
  C4a and C2a split products that generate the C3 convertase. C3 convertase cleaves
  C3 protein into C3a, a soluble inflammatory protein, and C3b, which is covalently
  bound to the cell surface. C3b may be further cleaved to C3d or form the C5 convertase.
  Terminal activation of the C5 convertase cleaves C5 protein, generating the potent
  anaphylatoxin C5a and the membrane-bound C5b. C5b recruits C6–9 proteins to form
  the membrane attack complex (MAC), disrupting membrane integrity. Complement regulatory
  proteins DAF and CD59 at the host cell surface restrain activation of the complement
  cascade at the two key amplification steps, C3 cleavage and C5 cleavage. (C) Many
  cells express receptors for the soluble and membrane-bound complement split products.
  Endothelial cells respond to C5a by upregulating P-selectin, and to sublytic concentrations
  of MAC by activation of non-canonical NFκB pathways, adhesion molecule, and cytokine
  upregulation. Monocytes and neutrophils express C3a and C5a receptors, which participate
  in chemotaxis of myeloid cells. Complement receptor 2 (CR2) is a component of the
  BCR that binds to opsonized, C3d-coated antigen. CR2 signaling enhances the BCR
  signal and lowers the threshold for B cell activation.
