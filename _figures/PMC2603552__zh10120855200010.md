caption: Role of oxysterol sulfation in lipid metabolism. Oxysterols such as 25HC
  activate LXRα and -β. The activated LXRα and -β bind to LXR response elements in
  promoter regions and activate transcription of their targeting genes, including
  SREBP-1 expression, which increases the biosynthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol.
  Thus, the activation of LXRα and -β increases lipids in the circulation by increasing
  lipid synthesis and efflux. 25HC3S, the product of 25HC sulfation, inhibits SREBP-1
  expression, and its activation subsequently inhibits lipid synthesis. LXRx and retinoid
  X receptor-x (RXRx) represent isomers (α and β). STS, steroid sulfatase.
