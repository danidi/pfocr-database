caption: 'Pathways underlying absorption of cholesterol from the intestinal lumen
  and its delivery to the liver. High dietary cholesterol through the chylomicron
  pathway could provide an important source of excess cholesterol molecules for secretion
  into bile, thereby inducing cholesterol-supersaturated bile and enhancing cholesterol
  gallstone formation (;). Ezetimibe (EZT) significantly suppresses cholesterol absorption
  from the small intestine via the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) pathway (). This
  effect should diminish the cholesterol content of the liver, which in turn decreases
  bioavailability of cholesterol for biliary secretion. Abbreviations: ABCG5/G8, ATP-binding
  cassette (transporter); ACAT2, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase isoform 2; APO-B48,
  apolipoprotein B48; MTTP, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. See text for
  details.'
