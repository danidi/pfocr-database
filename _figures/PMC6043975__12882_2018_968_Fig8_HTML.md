caption: Mechanism by which Ang II induces apoptosis in podocytes. AT1R signaling
  induces ER stress through increased GRP 78 and p-elf2α expression and PKC-δ phosphorylation.
  p38 MAPK and PKC-δ activation lead to increased Bax expression and enhanced NHE1
  activity, triggering cellular apoptosis. Cariporide, NHE1 inhibitor; Losartan, AT1R
  antagonist; SB203580, p38 MAPK inhibitor; GBM, glomerular basement membrane
pmcid: PMC6043975
papertitle: Angiotensin II-induced podocyte apoptosis is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum
  stress/PKC-δ/p38 MAPK pathway activation and trough increased Na+/H+ exchanger isoform
  1 activity.
