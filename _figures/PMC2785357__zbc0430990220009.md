caption: Schematic model depicting the putative mechanisms involved in the hypoxic
  regulation of CD36. In the proposed model, generation of ROS by hypoxia stimulates
  the PI3K/mTOR pathway, leading to accumulation of the CD36 protein with consequent
  increases in CD36 scavenging and anti-angiogenic activities. Involvement of HIF-1
  is proposed via direct or indirect activation by hypoxia, ROS, or the PI3K/mTOR
  cascade. Once activated, HIF-1 binds to the CD36 promoter to induce CD36 transcription
  and ultimately protein synthesis. Hypoxia-related lipid peroxidation further generates
  ligands, such as oxidized lipids, which serve to enhance receptor activation and
  function.
