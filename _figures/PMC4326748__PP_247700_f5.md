caption: A model of the interference of GA signaling with  signaling and  fungal colonization.
  I, An  signaling molecule (possibly a Myc factor) induces SbtM1, Vpy1, RAM1, RAM2,
  GA3ox, GA20ox, and GA2ox through  in the common symbiosis pathway. II, The up-regulated
  enzymes of GA biosynthesis and metabolism alter the GA concentration. Active GA
  concentration increases in the whole root, and GA accumulation enhances GA signaling.
  III, GA signaling promotes or maintains the expression of arbuscular mycorrhiza-induced
  genes (such as SbtM1), resulting in the promotion of hyphal branching. IV, GA signaling
  also inhibits the expression of RAM1 and RAM2, resulting in the inhibition of hyphal
  entry into the host root. V, Arbuscule formation requires SbtM1, Vpy1, and RAM2
  expression; therefore, it is affected both positively and negatively by GA signaling.
