caption: 'Targeting angiogenesis in tumor endothelial cells with a combination of
  metformin and 2DG: The schematic illustrates the possible cellular sites of action
  when using a combination of metformin and 2DG in tumor endothelial cells. It is
  possible that metformin accumulates in the tumor endothelial cells via OCT2 and
  requires futher thorough investigation. A combination of 2DG (5 mM) and metformin
  (2 mM) causes a robust increase in the levels of anti-angiogenic TSP1, which then
  binds to its receptor CD36 and negatively regulates the phosphorylation of VEGFR2
  at Y1175. A decrease in the levels of pVEGFR2 (Y1175), in turn, reduces the levels
  of phospho-Akt (S473). The combination treatment (DG and metformin) also increases
  the levels of phospho-Rap (S792). The increase in the levels of inhibitory pRap
  (S792) and decrease in pAkt (S473) subsequently decreases the levels of phospho-mTOR
  (S2448), resulting in the decrease in the levels of downstream phospho-4E-BP1 (T37/46)
  and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (S235/236 and S240/244). The combination treatment
  also reduces the levels of cell-cycle-associated phospho-CycB1 (S147), CycD1 and
  CycD2. These molecular events associated with the combination therapy (2DG + metformin)
  result in translational repression, inhibition of cell migration and angiogenesis
  and the inhibition of cell cycle and proliferation. Further investigations are warranted
  to ascertain or rule out the possible role of AMPK in the effect that we have seen
  on the levels of phospho-Rap and inhibition of the mTOR pathway when using a combination
  of 2DG and metformin.'
