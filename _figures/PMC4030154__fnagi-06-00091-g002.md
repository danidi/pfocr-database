caption: Metals and cholesterol implicated in Aβ processing and neurotoxicity. (A)
  Upon cleavage from APP, both metal and cholesterol bind to Aβ monomers promoting
  oligomerization of the peptide into multiple types of Aβ aggregates. These aggregates
  are either present within the extracellular space or bound to the surface of the
  plasma membrane (red arrows). Select Aβ aggregates are neurotoxic through multiple
  mechanisms such as their ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and may
  have implications in AD associated neuropathology. The ability of copper, iron,
  and cholesterol to promote redox cycling are acutely involved in the cytotoxicity
  caused by aggregated Aβ. (B) As with APP processing enzymes (Figure ), proteases
  that degrade Aβ, such as neprilysin (NEP) and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) are
  dependent on metals for their catalytic activity. These proteases are also lipid
  raft associated and modulated by cholesterol levels in these domains. (C) Lipidated
  ApoE, produced mainly by astrocytes and microglia, binds soluble Aβ and facilitates
  its degradation through receptor-mediated endocytosis within neurons and microglial
  or clearance from the brain through the blood–brain barrier (BBB; blue arrows).
  Lipidated ApoE regulation is modulated by nuclear transcription factors LXRs. LXR
  heterodimerizes with RXR to transcriptionally regulate ABCA1 and ApoE. ABCA1 exports
  cellular cholesterol and phospholipids that in turn lipidate ApoE to form HDL-like
  particles (green arrows). These HDL-like particles are required for the clearance
  of Aβ. Intriguingly, the LXR agonist, oxysterols is elevated in the AD brain and
  may result from cholesterol oxidation by metals and 24S-hydroxylase. Evidence implies
  that the involvement of metal and cholesterol in the Aβ processing pathway is not
  just deleterious (as in A) but may also have importance in degradation and clearance
  of this potentially harmful peptide (B,C).
