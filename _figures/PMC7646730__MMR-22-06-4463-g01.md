caption: ROS regulates endometrial breakdown through the NF-κB-Cox-2 signaling. Progesterone
  withdrawal may lead to increased ROS, which will activate the NF-B-Cox-2 signal
  through the classic IKK-dependent pathway and increase Cox-2. At the same time,
  the NF-κB signaling also regulates chemokinens, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases,
  thereby promoting the breakdown of the endometrium and the formation of menstruation.
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; Cox-2, cyclooxygenase 2.
