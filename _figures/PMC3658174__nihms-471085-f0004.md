caption: Under normal conditions, these chromatin-mediated interactions facilitate
  synapsis and repair of two different broken switch regions. These CSR joins mediated
  by the C-NHEJ pathway show little evidence of resected DSB ends and constitute the
  majority of successful CSR. In the absence of C-NHEJ, A-EJ mediates some level of
  CSR but also mediates aberrant joining in the form of chromosomal translocations.
  In the absence of either H2AX or 53BP1, extensive resection occurs on unrepaired
  DSBs, thereby inhibiting NHEJ pathways, and ultimately leading to repair of the
  DSB by HR without class-switching. Orange arrows indicate 5' to 3' DNA end resection
  of a DSB incurred within an Igh switch region.
