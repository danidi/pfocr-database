caption: In macrophages, P. gingivalis interacts with the CD14/TLR2/TLR1 receptor
  complex (). Moreover, P. gingivalis uses its gingipains to attack C5 and release
  biologically C5a (, ). Upon C5aR binding, C5a stimulates Gαi-dependent intracellular
  Ca2+signaling which synergistically enhances the otherwise weak cAMP responses induced
  by TLR2/TLR1 activation alone. Maximal cAMP induction is achieved by the participation
  of another G protein-coupled receptor, the CXCR4, which interacts directly with
  P. gingivalis and coassociates with both TLR2 and C5aR in lipid rafts (, ). The
  ensuing activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) pathway inactivates
  glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) and impairs the inducible nitrogen synthase
  (iNOS)-dependent killing of the pathogen in macrophages in vitro and in vivo ().
  The interaction of P. gingivalis with TLR2/TLR1 also activates inside-out signaling,
  propagated by Rac1, PI3K, and cytohesin-1 (Cyt-1), which induces the high-affinity
  conformation of CR3 (, ). CR3 then binds and internalizes P. gingivalis; this is
  a relatively safe portal of entry since CR3 is not linked to vigorous microbicidal
  mechanisms (, ). The CR3-P. gingivalis interaction also leads to induction of ERK1/2
  signaling. This in turn downregulates IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA expression (), possibly
  through suppression of a critical transcription factor (the interferon regulatory
  factor 1 [IRF1]) that is required for IL-12 expression (). This inhibitory ERK1/2
  pathway is also activated downstream of the C5aR. The suppressive effects of CR3
  and C5aR on TLR2-induced cytokine production are selective for IL-12 and do not
  affect induction of other proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α)
  in vitro or in vivo. Inhibition of bioactive IL-12 by these mechanisms results in
  impaired immune clearance of P. gingivalis in vivo (, ). P. gingivalis interacts
  with at least one more TLR, the TLR4, which, however, is proactively antagonized
  by an atypical lipopolysaccharide lipid A moiety ().
