caption: Bid can be activated by multiple proteases in response to a variety of pathophysiological
  signals. Cleaved Bid is recruited to the mitochondria with the participation of
  MTCH2, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein that interacts with Bid. Bid can interact
  with the multi-domain anti-death Bcl-2 family members, Bax and Bak, to induce their
  oligomerization, leading to the formation of a membrane pore and the release of
  molecules residing at the intermembrane space. Bid can also interact with cardiolipin,
  located at the contact site of the outer membranes, to promote cristae reorganization,
  which is also facilitated by ROS that could be resulted from the activation of the
  permeability transition pore under the influence of Bid. Cristae reorganization
  can cause the mobilization of cytochrome c residing at the inner membranes to maximize
  their release into the cytosol through the Bax/Bak pore. Although released cytochrome
  c is important for the activation of caspase-9 through the apoptosome, Smac is needed
  to reverse the suppression of caspase-9 and effector caspases by XIAP. This mitochondrial
  pathway is particularly critical in death receptor-initiated apoptosis in type II
  cells, such as hepatocytes, but would also have an important roles in amplifying
  apoptosis in other scenarios.
