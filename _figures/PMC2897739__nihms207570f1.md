caption: 'Nucleic acid-sensing TLRs, which include TLR-3, -7, -8 and -9, are localized
  to endosomal compartments. SLE immune complexes that contain nucleic acids are bound
  by FCGR2A on the surface of dendritic cells and are subsequently internalized where
  they gain access to the endosome and activate TLRs. TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 signal through
  the adaptor protein MyD88, the kinases IRAK1 and IRAK4, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase
  TRAF6. Upon stimulation, the IRF family members IRF5 and IRF7 are phosphorylated,
  dimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they induce transcription of IFN-I.
  IRF5 is also critical for the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in response
  to TLR stimulation. TLR signaling activates the NF-κB transcription factor, which
  promotes the induction of many proinflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory
  genes. TNFAIP3 is a negative regulator of TRAF6 and inhibits the activation of NFκB.
  IFN-Is, which include many subtypes of IFN-α and a single subtype of IFN-β, bind
  to their receptor, which is composed of two chains, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Signaling
  through the receptor results in the activation of receptor-associated Janus kinases,
  JAK1 and TYK2, which in turn promote the phosphorylation of the STAT family members
  STAT1, STAT2 and STAT4. Upon activation, STAT proteins dimerize, translocate to
  the nucleus and induce the expression of IFN-I-inducible genes. In many cases, the
  evidence supporting certain functions is preliminary or inconclusive, as indicated
  by the ‘?’and as described in the main text.ATG: Autophagy-specific gene; BDCA:
