caption: β-Oxidation pathway of fatty acids (with permission of Biocarta). The β-oxidation
  cycle itself is catalyzed by a series of four enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix.
  Each turn of the cycle shortens the fatty acid chain by two carbon atoms and generates
  one molecule of acetyl CoA. We only consider even-chain saturated fatty acids.
