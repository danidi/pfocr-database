caption: The unique interaction of the 16 C-terminal amino acids of LMP1 (LTB) with
  TRADD prevents apoptosis induction through TRADD, which is an intrinsic and transferable
  function of LTB. Additional LMP1 sequences are not required for masking TRADD's
  apoptotic activity. TRADD mediates the recruitment of IKKβ to the LMP1 signaling
  complex through a yet unidentified factor. Activation of IKKβ requires a parallel
  pathway that is dependent on TRAF6. TRAF6 activation of IKKβ most likely involves
  TAK1 and TAB1 (not depicted). The JNK pathway is TRADD-independent and works through
  TRAF6 and, probably, BS69. To keep this model concise, only key molecules of CTAR2
  signaling are shown. Refer to the text for more details.
