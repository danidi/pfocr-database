caption: 'Molecular signaling altered in Fragile X syndrome. In the absence of FMRP
  protein translation is enhanced and several proteins encoded by FMRP targets such
  as APP, STEP, MAP1B, ARC, CaMKIIα, and others are up-regulated. In addition, many
  receptors are deregulated in FXS. Therefore, to normalize the observed behavioral
  phenotypes, several drugs have been used—in fly, animal models, and affected patients—to
  correct or revert some of the abnormalities. Among them: mGluR5 antagonists (MPEP,
  Fenobam, AFQ056, STX107, Acamprosate, RO491752, CTEP, LY341495, MPPG, and MTPG),
  agonists of the GABAergic pathway (Asbaclofen, Ganaxolene, and Acamprosate) and
  AMPAR signaling (CX516), antagonist of the cholinergic pathway (Donepezil), among
  others. Studies using fly and animal models have shown that targeting specific molecules/pathways
  corrected some defects and this information may be used to develop nontoxic drugs
  (denoted by the dashed line), such as ERK, PAK, and PKC inhibitors.'
