caption: The model depicted is based on the genetic evidence and has not been confirmed
  by binding or electrophysiological data. Volatile anesthetics (VAs) are shown inhibiting
  UNC-13 as previously proposed . The direct target of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate
  (cAMP)-activated protein kinase A catalytic subunit KIN-1 is unknown but is unlikely
  to be UNC-13.
