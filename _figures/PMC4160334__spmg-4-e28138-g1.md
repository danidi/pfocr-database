caption: 'Figure 1. The proposed mechanism for the role of estrogen receptors on Sertoli
  cell proliferation and differentiation. E2 (or the selective ligand) interacts with
  ESR1 and induces activation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways, and translocation of
  the transcription factor NFKB to the nucleus, to activate expression of CCND1 (cyclin
  D1) and cell proliferation. Interaction of ESR2 with E2 (or the selective ligand)
  induces activation of PI3K/AKT pathway and phosphorylation of the transcription
  factor CREB, which induces expression of factors involved in inhibition of cell
  proliferation and/or start of cell differentiation: CDKN1B (p27kip1), GATA-1, and
  DMRT1. E2 (or the selective ligand) interacts with GPER and induces transactivation
  of EGFR via activation of SRC by G-protein βγ subunits that promotes a metalloprotease-dependent
  release of EGFR ligands, with a consequent activation of ERK1/2 and PIK3 pathways,
  which in turn triggers an increase in the expression of BCL2 and a decrease in the
  expression of BAX (for a review, see ref. ). See text for more details.'
