caption: Role of Nrf2 in HCC. P62 and FGF19 were reported to activate Nrf2 and promote
  HCC by competing with Keap1 or through FGFR4–GSK3β signal pathway. MiR-340, miR-144,
  camptothecin, valproic acid, and indazolo[3,2-b]quinazolinones, which were revealed
  in suppressing Nrf2-dependent pathway and sensitizing HCC cells to anticancer treatments.
