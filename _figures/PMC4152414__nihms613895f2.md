caption: Coactivator dependent signaling regulates various biological functions, and
  deregulation causes diseases. Several extracellular stimuli such as growth factors-
  EGF (epidermal growth factor) and IGF (insulin-like growth factors); cytokines-
  IL-6 (interlukein-6) and TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α) and steroid hormones trigger
  downstream signaling pathway activating coactivator-dependent complex assembly.
  In addition, alterations in the energy status (ATP/ADP ratio), nutrient signaling,
  and cellular stress can also promote coactivator recruitment on target gene promoters.
  Coactivators such as steroid receptor activators (SRCs) then bind to nuclear receptors
  (NRs) or several other transcription factors to stimulate gene transcription. This
  coactivator dependent gene activation is highly selective, and intricately regulated
  by several mechanisms (described in the text) stimulating specific cellular functions.
  In contrast, deregulated expression and activation of coactivators lead to perturbed
  signaling pathway resulting in disease pathology.
