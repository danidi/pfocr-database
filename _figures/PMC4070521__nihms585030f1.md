caption: Biosynthetic pathway of n3 and n6 PUFAs highlighting a set of genes known
  to play key roles in the biosynthesis and metabolism of LC-PUFAs in two parallel
  and competing pathways. Enzymatic products from these genes convert 18-carbon (18C)
  n-6 or n-3 essential PUFAs (abundant in the modern western diet [MWD]) into LC-PUFA.
