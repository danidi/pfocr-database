caption: (A) Glucose (Glc) and glutamine (Gln) enter the cell via dedicated transporters.
  In the cytosol, Glc is converted in the glycolysis pathway into pyruvate (Pyr),
  which is transported to the mitochondrial matrix by the mitochondrial Pyr carrier
  (MPC). Alternatively, Pyr can be converted into lactate (Lac) by the action of lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH). Inside the mitochondrial matrix, Pyr is converted in to acetyl
  coenzyme A (acetyl‐CoA; not shown) by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to enter the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The latter supplies the oxidative phosphorylation
  system (OXPHOS) with substrates in the form of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NADH) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH 2). In addition, Gln can enter
  the mitochondrial matrix where it is converted by glutaminase into glutamate (not
  shown), a TCA cycle substrate. Also fatty acids can enter the mitochondrial matrix
  and enter the TCA cycle following their conversion into acetyl‐CoA (not shown).
  In healthy cells, the conversion of Glc into Pyr and its further metabolic conversion
  by the TCA and OXPHOS system constitute the major pathway for ATP generation (marked
  in red). (B) The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) consists of 4 multisubunit
  protein complexes (complex I to IV) that are embedded in the mitochondrial inner
  membrane (MIM). Electrons are donated by NADH (at complex I) and FADH 2 (at complex
  II) to coenzyme Q10 (Q), which transports them to complex III. From thereon, electrons
  are transported to complex IV by cytochrome c (c) where they are donated to molecular
  oxygen (O2). Although not discussed here, in addition to the ETC complexes also
  other proteins can provide coenzyme Q10 and cytochrome c with electrons (red boxes)
  in a tissue‐dependent manner. During electron transport, energy is liberated and
  used expel protons (H+) from the mitochondrial matrix intro the inter‐membrane space
  (IMS) between the MIM and mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). As a consequence,
  the mitochondrial matrix displays an increased pH and the MIM has a highly negative‐inside
  membrane potential (Δψ). (C) Together, the pH (ΔpH) and potential difference (Δψ)
  across the MIM determine the magnitude of the proton‐motive force (PMF), which is
  used by the FoF1‐ATPase (complex V) to drive mitochondrial ATP production from inorganic
  phosphate (Pi) and ADP. In addition to ATP generation, virtually all other mitochondrial
  processes including ion exchange and pre‐protein import require a proper ΔpH and/or
  Δψ. The magnitude of the PMF not only depends on the combined action of the ETC
  and complex V (i.e., the oxidative phosphorylation system; OXPHOS) but also is affected
  by other electrogenic systems. These include uncoupling proteins (UCPs), the Pi
  transporter (PiT), and the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT). This figure was
  compiled based on (Koopman et al, ; Valsecchi et al, ; Liemburg‐Apers et al, ; Koopman
  et al, ,  and Liemburg‐Apers et al, ).
