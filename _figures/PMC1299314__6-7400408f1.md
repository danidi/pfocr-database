caption: Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs late in tumour progression,
  but also in normal embryonic development (for example, during gastrulation). Epithelial
  cells lose the expression of epithelial-specific genes, such as E-cadherin (E-cad),
  that encode cell–cell-adhesion molecules, and acquire the expression of mesenchymal
  genes (see text for examples). Carcinomas represent ∼85% of human tumours—particularly
  the 'big killers' such as colon, breast and lung cancers—and all originate from
  epithelial cells. EMT causes cells to lose apical-basal polarity (shown on the left)
  and gain a fibroblast-like morphology, high motility and invasive properties (shown
  on the right). When cells are cultured on gels of extracellular matrix proteins,
  such as collagen (cross-hatched), the fibroblastoid cells can invade the matrix;
  this process resembles the invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells. (A) In recent
  years, transcription factors (such as Snail and Slug) have been identified that
  control the expression of E-cadherin by binding directly to E-boxes in the gene
  promoter. Other factors, such as growth factors and their receptors (for example,
  hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-β)), the tyrosine kinase src and cytoplasmic G-proteins (such
  as rac) can also promote EMT indirectly (for a general review on EMT, see ). (B)
  β-catenin was found to exert a dual role as an essential cytoplasmic-interaction
  partner of cadherins, which is essential for cell–cell-adhesion, and as a nuclear
  partner of the T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphocyte-enhancer factor (Lef) family of transcription
  factors that regulate genes of the canonical Wnt signalling pathway. The switch
  of β-catenin from its action in cell adhesion to transcriptional control in the
  nucleus is controlled by binding to BCL9-2, which is the homologue of a human B-cell
  oncogene product, and is promoted by tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin ().
