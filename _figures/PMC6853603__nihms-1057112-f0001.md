caption: Major metabolic pathways. Glycolysis is a 10-step reaction that converts
  glucose into pyruvate; pyruvate is then converted into lactate or enters the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle as acetyl-CoA to yield NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 are used
  by the electron transport chain (ETC) to generate ATP. Metabolic intermediates derived
  from glycolysis can also be diverted to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to generate
  NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. Fatty acid synthesis occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum
  and requires both NADPH and ATP from other metabolic pathways. During periods of
  energy deprivation, fatty acids are metabolized in mitochondria via β-oxidation,
  yielding large amounts of NADH and FADH2 for ATP synthesis in the ETC.
