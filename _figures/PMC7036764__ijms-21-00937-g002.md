caption: 'Graphical view of the metabolic and molecular effects of the combined treatment
  with PPP inhibitors and cisplatin (CDDP). The symbol ――| indicates inhibition of
  the enzymes G6PD and 6PGD. The inhibition of the enzyme leads to increased ROS accumulation
  and resensitization of CDDP-resistant cells. G6PD: glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  6PGL: phosphogluconolactonase; 6PGD: 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.'
