caption: Mechanism of the NF-κB Signaling Pathway Mediated by LINC01093Overexpression
  of LINC01093 can target ICAM-1 negatively and then inhibit apoptosis and enhance
  proliferation by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby attenuating AH.
  NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; ICAM-1, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1; AH, alcoholic
  hepatitis.
