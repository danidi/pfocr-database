caption: 'Pathway analysis of proteins upregulated during time course analysis in
  lung or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) following intra tracheal instillation
  of 20 μg carbon nanopaticles (CNP). At day 7, when complete resolution of neutrophilic
  influx has taken place all of these markers were detected at significantly elevated
  concentration compared to their base line levels following their initial upregulation
  during the acute response phase (day 1). The predicted molecular network suggest
  a central role of IL1B (IL: Interleukin) and IL18 in the process. Regulation of
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) through the endothelin1 (EDN1) and basic
  fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) network as the end product in the cascade to restore
  homeostasis. Elevated levels of several systemic factors suggest their role locally
  for maintaining/restoring homeostasis. Gene symbols are used as shown in Additional
  file ; Table S1.'
