caption: Cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Tenascin C and X influence fibrosis.
  Tenascin C participates in maintaining a proinflammatory environment and increases
  migration of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. Due to their effects on TGF-β signaling
  pathway, tenascin C and X influence fibroblast and epithelial cells differentiation
  into myofibroblasts. Tenascin X modulates mechanical properties of collagen.
