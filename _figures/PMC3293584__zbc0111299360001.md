caption: Schematic of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism in the cytoplasm and nucleus.
  One-carbon metabolism is required for the de novo synthesis of purines and thymidylate
  and for the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Folate-activated one-carbon
  units are shown in boldface type. The de novo thymidylate pathway is sumoylated
  and translocates to the nucleus during S phase. MTHFD1, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase; MTR, methionine synthase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase;
  DHF, dihydrofolate.
