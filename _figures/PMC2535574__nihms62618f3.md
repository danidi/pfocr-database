caption: We determined that glycosyl donor 4 can be glycosidated with glycosyl acceptor
  25 in the presence of 0.11 mol equiv. of TfOH in 1,2-DCE. Similarly to the previous
  experiment, it was anticipated that the UV active species that could be detected
  along with the disaccharide 26 by TLC analysis of the reaction mixture derived from
  the departed aglycone. Our goal was to verify whether 2-benzoxazolethione (32a,
  thioamide, thione, “NSBox”) or 2-mercaptobenzoxazole (32b, thioimide, thiol, HSBox)
  had been formed (). The departed aglycone was isolated by column chromatography
  followed by crystallization of the crude reaction mixture and its structure was
  determined to be HNBox (32a). This conclusion was based on the n.m.r. data and the
  X-ray crystal structure of the isolated UV active compound. Also, by comparing the
  n.m.r. and X-ray crystallography data of the commercial and the isolated samples
  we noted that 32a isolated from the reaction mixture was essentially the same compound
  as the commercial 2-mercaptobenzoxazole. Again, regardless of the species isolated
  herein, it is not possible to unambiguously prove the activation pathway due to
  the probability for the departed species to tautomerize (HSBox ⇌ NSBox).
