caption: Signaling connections involved in TRPC5-initiated autophagy pathways in response
  to chemotherapy in breast cancer cells. Chemotherapy up-regulates TRPC5 expression
  and then increases the basal [Ca2+]i. The increased [Ca2+]i actives CaMKKβ by phosphorylation,
  which in turn activates AMPKα by phosphorylation. Activation of AMPKα negatively
  regulates mTOR by suppressing its phosphorylation, leading to autophagy. Autophagy
  induced by TRPC5 during chemotherapy promotes the survival of human breast cancer
  cell. Arrows represent promotion events, blunt arrows indicate suppression events.
