caption: Wnts bind to their frizzled receptors (FZ) and coreceptors LRP in the membrane.
  This binding can be blocked by dickkopf (Dkk) or soluble frizzled related proteins
  (sFRP). Activation of FZ by wnt results in phosphorylation of disheveled (Dvl),
  which induces the disruption of the axin/APC/GSK-3β complex and recruitment of axin
  to the membrane. This complex when active phosphorylates β-catenin, leading to its
  proteosomal degradation. However, following wnt stimulation β-catenin is no longer
  degraded and can enter the nucleus where in combination with members of the LEF/TCF
  family can induce expression of its target genes such as cyclin D1. β-catenin also
  binds to the E-cadherin complex in the plasma membrane, binding which promotes differentiation.
  1,25(OH)2D/VDR interact with wnt signaling at multiple points. 1,25(OH)2D/VDR binds
  β-catenin reducing its transcriptional activity. 1,25(OH)2D/VDR promotes the formation
  of the E-cadherin/catenin complex in the membrane also serving to reduce translocation
  of β-catenin into the nucleus.
