caption: 'The function of CETP in RCT.Notes: CETP mediates the equimolar transfer
  of CE and TG between atherogenic VLDL, LDL, and anti-atherogenic HDL. The majority
  of CE originates in HDL-C via a reaction carried out by LCAT, whereas the bulk of
  TG stems from the liver and intestine as VLDL or chylomicrons, respectively. LPL
  and HL hydrolyze a portion of TG from VLDL, which converts VLDL to LDL. Cells within
  the liver and peripheral tissue that express the LDL receptor take up excess LDL.
  In addition, macrophages also take up LDL and are converted to foam cells. Esterified
  and free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) is then taken up by HDL via the SR-B1 (Pathway
  1) and by LDL via the LDL-R (pathway 2). Reprinted from the Journal of the American
