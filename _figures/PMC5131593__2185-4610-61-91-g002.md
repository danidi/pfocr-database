caption: Therapeutic targeting RAGE/MT1-MMP/Rac1 axis in redox-sensitive signaling
  pathway in diabetic vascular complications. The schematic diagram shows that MT1-MMP
  is involved in AGEs/RAGE-dependent, redox-sensitive signaling pathways in cultured
  SMCs. The MT1-MMP/RAGE complex modifies this pathway and the blockade of RAGE/MT1-MMP
  axis are candidates for therapeutic strategy. These findings identify the attractive
  therapeutic targeting for RAGE/MT1-MMP/Rac1 in diabetic vascular complications47).
