caption: 'Working models of cellular pathways giving rise to phrenic motor facilitation
  following AIH. A:The “Q pathway” is initiated by activation of the Gq-protein coupled
  5-HT2 receptor, leading to protein kinase C (PKC) activation and new synthesis of
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF then activates its high affinity
  receptor, TrkB. TrkB activation phosphorylates extracellular signal-related kinase
  (ERK) MAP kinase, which facilitates inputs to phrenic motor neurons by an unknown
  mechanism (possibly glutamate receptor trafficking). The Q pathway is regulated
  by protein phosphatases 2A and/or 5, which can inhibit PKC activation. NADPH oxidase-induced
  ROS formation inhibits these phosphatases, enabling pLTF expression. Thus, NADPH
  oxidase and PP2A/5 constitute a "regulatory cassette" for pLTF. B: The “S pathway”
  is induced by the Gs-protein coupled adenosine 2A (A2A) receptor, subsequently activating
  protein kinase A (PKA). PKA stimulates new synthesis of an immature TrkB isoform,
  which auto-activates and phosphorylates and activates Akt. Subsequent to Akt activation,
  synaptic inputs to phrenic motor neurons are facilitated by an unknown mechanism.'
