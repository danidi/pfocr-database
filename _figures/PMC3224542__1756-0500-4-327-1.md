caption: Genes related with the tau protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A) pathway. PP2A dephosphorylates
  tau and is composed of an structural subunit A, a catalytic subunit alpha (PPP2CA)
  and a regulatory subunit B alpha (PPP2R2A). The peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase
  PIN1 binds to tau and facilitates PP2A activity, whereas ANP32A inhibits PP2A activity.
  Methylation by the leucine carboxyl methyltransferase-1 (LCMT1) increases PP2A activity,
  and demethylation by protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PPME1) reduces PP2A activity.
