caption: PFKFB3-driven glycolysis and the central role of FAO via CPT1a function in
  ECs (a) Schematic of PFKFB3 as a key regulator of the glycolytic activity in ECs
  and the angiogenic switch. F2,6P2, produced from F6P by PFKFB3, allosterically activates
  PFK1 in order to further increase glycolytic flux and quickly generate high amounts
  of ATP necessary for ECs to sprout. (b) Illustration of FAO metabolic pathway through
  the rate-controlling enzyme CPT1a in vessel sprouting. FAO and CPT1a are necessary
  during vessel sprout elongation to replenish the TCA cycle and to produce aspartate
  as a precursor of dNTPs for cell replication. (c) FAO and CPT1a are pivotal for
  lymphangiogenesis by promoting DNA synthesis, and thus proliferation, but also for
  venous-to-lymphatic EC differentiation through histone acetylation and epigenetic
  mechanisms.
