caption: 'Metabolic cross-talk between the purine and nicotinate utilization pathways.
  PHI is a conventional XDH able to catalyse the conversion of hypoxanthine to xanthine
  and xanthine to uric acid. XanA is an α-ketoglutarate-dependent xanthine dioxygenase,
  accepting xanthine but not hypoxanthine as a substrate. From there uric acid is
  converted into ammonium () by the well-established purine utilization pathway ([]
  for review). PHII is an unconventional MOCO carrying enzyme hydroxylating hypoxanthine
  to xanthine and nicotinic acid to presumably 6-OH nicotinic acid. As this latter
  compound is a nitrogen source, it is presumably converted into ammonium, which is
  indicated by a dashed blue connector. Note that unlike PHI, PHII cannot use xanthine
  as a substrate. In black: steps induced by uric acid, under the control of the UaY
  transcription factor. In blue: steps actually (hxnS, PHII) or presumably induced
  by nicotinic acid, 6-OH nicotinic acid or a further metabolite in the nicotinate
  utilization pathway and under the control of the HxnR/AplA transcription factor(s).
  Full references are given in the text.'
