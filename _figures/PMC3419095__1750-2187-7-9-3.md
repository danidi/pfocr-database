caption: MK5 is implicated in VEGF-mediated angiogenesis. VEGF produced by tumour
  cells will bind to the VEGF receptor VEGFR2 on endothelial cells. This will trigger
  a cascade involving the MAP kinases p38 and MK5. MK5 can in turn activate FAK, and
  this will result in changes in the cytoskeletal architecture and migration of endothelial
  cells towards the tumour. A blood vessel with endothelial cells aligning the vessel
  is shown. The pathway induced by VEGF and which involves MK5 is depicted in detail.
