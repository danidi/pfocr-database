caption: 'Repair of a DNA double-strand break (DSB) is usually accomplished by either
  homologous recombination (HR) when a homologous chromosome is available in the form
  of a sister chromatid, or by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) throughout the cell
  cycle. Following formation of a DSB, the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex is recruited
  to the break where it binds to the DNA ends through MRE11. A coiled-coil region
  of RAD50 reaches across the break and through coordination of a central Zn2+ ion,
  tethers the two broken DNA ends together. The serine/threonine protein kinase ATM
  is usually present as an inactive dimer but is recruited to the break site by NBS1.
  This causes ATM to autophosphorylate (P) and monomerize, activating the kinase.
  The activated ATM phosphorylates NBS1 and a multitude of other proteins that participates
  in the DNA DSB response, including BRCA1 and phosphorylation of nearby histone H2AX
  to generate γH2AX. The γH2AX at repair foci acts as a signal to recruit other repair
  proteins in order to assemble DSBR complexes. One such protein, MDC1, binds to γH2AX
  which recruits RNF8to the break site where it initiates an ubiquitylation cascade
  of histones H2A and H2AX causing chromatin restructuring and generation of binding
  sites for further protein factors. The HR pathway proceeds via the end processing
  of damaged DNA termini with initial nucleolytic 5′ resection performed by CtIP,
  a function dependent on CtIP recruitment of BRCA1. Further resection by EXO1 generates
  single DNA strands with 3′ overhangs upon which RAD51 monomers attach to form nucleoprotein
  filaments. A RAD51 recombinase complex is then assembled containing the accessory
  proteins BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD52 and the RAD51 paralogs: RAD51B/C/D and XRCC2/3. This
  recombinase complex, with the aid of an additional factor, RAD54, facilitates homology
  search and strand invasion of the homologous chromosome to form displacement loops
  (D-loops). DNA repair synthesis by DNA polymerase using the homologous strand as
  template extends the 3′ invading strand allowing branch migration of the Holliday
  junction, a cruciform intermediate. The repair synthesis allows capture of the other
  DNA end to create a double Holliday junction intermediate. DNA ligation by LIG1
  seals the remaining nicks and resolution of the double Holliday junction by structure-specific
  endonucleases generate either non-crossover or crossover products depending on where
  the junctions are cut by the resolvase. The BLM RecQ helicase can cooperate with
  TOPO3α and BLAP75 to resolve DHJs with generation of exclusively non-crossover products.The
  NHEJ pathway first involves binding of Ku70-80 heterodimer to the two DNA termini.
  This then recruits DNA-PKCS to form the DNA-PK complex bringing the two DNA termini
  close together. Because of associated lesions not all DNA termini are readily ligatable
  and must be processed to generate the 5′-P and 3′-OH termini that are necessary
  for ligation. Autophosphorylation of DNA-PKCS can make the obstructive termini accessible
  to end processing enzymes such as TDP1. DNA-PKCS also mediates a regulatory phosphorylation
  of the WRN RecQ helicase. End processing and resection, while not fully understood,
  may involve the exonuclease activity of FEN1, WRN and Artemis. DNA polymerases then
  perform any necessary DNA repair synthesis. Finally, the DNA-PK complex, in a Ku70-80
  mediated fashion, recruits the LIG4-XRCC4-XLF complex to perform the ligation of
  the DNA termini via the ligase activity of LIG4.'
