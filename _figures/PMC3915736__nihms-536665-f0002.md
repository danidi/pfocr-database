caption: (A) Interleukin-2 (IL-2) serves to couple CD8+ T-cell expansion and differentiation
  by activation of several signaling pathways including the Janus kinase (JAK)–signal
  transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, the phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  (PI3K)–AKT pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Effector
  differentiation is driven by activation of AKT and nuclear exclusion of Forkhead
  box 01 (FOXO1), thereby inhibiting Eomesodermin (EOMES), B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6 (BCL6),
  and Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and resulting in expression of T-BET (encoded by
  T-box 21 (TBX21). STAT5 activation drives expression of pro-differentiation molecules
  B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (BLIMP1, encoded by PR domain containing
  1, with ZNF domain (PRDM1) and inhibitor of DNA-binding 2 (ID2). IL-2 signaling
  drives cell expansion through the RAS/RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway and expression of cMYC which drives proliferation by upregulating cyclins
  and downregulation of p21 and pro-apoptotic molecule B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2).
  Pharmacologic inhibition of select pathways by agents such as Akt inhibitor or rapamycin
  may uncouple cell proliferation and effector differentiation in a cell-intrinsic
  manner. p70S6K, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin.
  (B) The establishment of a self-renewing subset of CD8+ T cells within a polyclonal
  response by a CD27-CD70-dependent pathway is depicted here. Upon activation with
  cognate antigen, the progeny of a naive CD8+ T cell progressively downregulates
  CD27 while reciprocally upregulating CD70 in the context of IL-2 signaling. Physiologic
  inhibition of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway results in reacquisition of CD27 amidst a population
  of highly differentiated CD70-expressing cells, thereby triggering the CD27-dependent
  expansion of T cells that occurs with minimal effector differentiation. Antigen-induced
  cell death (AICD) further favors the outgrowth of CD-27-dependent pathway. Availability
  of CD70 negatively regulates CD-27-dependent cell expansion; constitutive CD70 results
  in autoimmune pathology.
