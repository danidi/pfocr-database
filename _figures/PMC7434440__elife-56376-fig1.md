caption: (A) In aerobic metabolism, ubiquinone (UQ) shuttles electrons in the ETC
  from Complex I (CI; yellow box) and quinone-coupled dehydrogenases (QDHs), such
  as Complex II. These electrons are ultimately transferred to oxygen. In anaerobic
  metabolism, rhodoquinone (RQ) reverses electron flow in QDHs and facilitates an
  early exit of electrons from the ETC onto anaerobic electron acceptors (Ae-A), such
  as fumarate. (B) The RQ biosynthetic pathway in C. elegans requires L-tryptophan,
  a precursor in the kynurenine pathway. L-Trptophan is transformed into 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid (3HA) in four steps. It is proposed that 3HA is a substrate for COQ-2, producing
  3-hydroxy-5-nonaprenylanthranilic acid (NHA), where n=9. The transformation of NHA
  to RQ requires several shared proteins from the UQ biosynthetic pathway. (C) Eukaryotes
  can use either p-aminobenzoic acid (pABA) or 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HB) as precursors
  to UQ. Prenylation is facilitated by Coq2 to form 3-hexaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic
  acid (HHB) or 3-hexaprenyl-4-aminobenzoic acid (HAB), where n = varies between species.
  Further functionalization of these intermediates occurs through a Coq synthome (Coq3–Coq9
  and Coq11) to yield UQ.
