caption: A kinase cascade regulating pIgR transcytosis. (a) A Yes–EGFR–ERK–FIP5 signalling
  cascade controls pIgA–pIgR transcytosis in epithelial cells. pIgA stimulates pIgR
  activation, which associates with Yes, and directs phosphorylation of EGFR. Active
  phosphorylated EGFR, presumably through Ras/Raf, activates MEK/ERK, which in turn
  phosphorylates FIP5 on Ser 188 (pFIP5). FIP5, phosphorylated on Ser 188, functions
  with Rab11a to regulate transcytosis of pIgA–pIgR complexes. (b) FIP5 phosphorylation
  controls polarized distribution of Rab11a and pIgA transcytosis. A schematic representation
  of how pIgR–Yes–EGFR complexes are internalized and passaged through basolateral
  early endosomes (BEEs) to sub-apical endosomes, presumably the common recycling
  endosome (CREs). pIgA causes the disruption of the pIgR–Yes–EGFR complex in endosomes.
  The EGFR–MEK/ERK cassette phosphorylates FIP5 on Ser 188 (pS188), which controls
  re-distribution of Rab11a/FIP5 vesicles from the periphery to the centre of the
  apical region of cells. This may represent the transition from the CRE to the apical
  recycling endosome (ARE). From here EGFR may be recycled to the basolateral plasma
  membrane. pIgA–pIgR complexes are delivered to the ARE, from where they are delivered
  to the apical plasma membrane. Thus the EGFR–MEK/ERK cassette represents an unappreciated
  regulator of transport through the transcytotic pathway. TJ; tight junctions.
