caption: Model for the pharmacological effects of FGF21. Acute pharmacological administration
  of FGF21 to models of metabolic disease increases insulin sensitivity whereas chronic
  administration increases energy expenditure, weight loss and insulin sensitivity.
  The acute insulin sensitizing effects of FGF21 requires functional adipose tissue(s).
  FGF21 enhances insulin action to increase peripheral glucose disposal, and functions
  to promote the secretion of adipokines including adiponectin and leptin. Extended
  administration of FGF21 increases energy expenditure through actions on the central
  nervous system (CNS) and adipose tissues. FGF21 increases sympathetic nerve activity
  (SNA) which stimulates brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and “browning” of white
  adipose tissue. Leptin also increases sympathetic nerve activity and leptin may
  be important for the effects of FGF21 on energy expenditure. FGF21 may also affect
  energy expenditure through a yet unidentified pathway. FGF21-mediated increases
  in energy expenditure increases weight loss and disposes of excess nutrients to
  improve metabolic profiles.
