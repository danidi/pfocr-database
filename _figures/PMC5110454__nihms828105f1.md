caption: (a) Bacterial toxins, such as TcdB, C3, VopS and IbpA or intracellular cAMP
  cause inactivation of RhoA and consequently disrupt PKN-mediated phosphorylation
  of Pyrin, which releases the 14-3-3 protein guards from Pyrin to promote assembly
  of the Pyrin inflammasome and release IL-1β and IL-18 to support host defense against
  these bacterial pathogens. (b), Deficiency in the mevalonate kinase (MVK) as in
  MKD/HIDS patients impairs Kras geranylgeranylation, Kras binding and activation
  of Akt1 and subsequently causes elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine release and MEFV
  expression. In parallel, geranylgeranylation-dependent RhoA activation is impaired,
  which releases the 14-3-3 guard from Pyrin and causes constitutive and chronic Pyrin
  inflammasome assembly and activation and excessive release of IL-1β. Similarly,
  hereditary mutations in Pyrin, as observed in FMF patients, prevent interaction
  with PKNs and 14-3-3 proteins or directly destroy the serine 242 phosphorylation
  site, as observed in PAAND patients, resulting in excessive Pyrin inflammasome activation.
  Hence, temporary disruption of any part of this guard pathway causes Pyrin-dependent
  host defense responses, while constant disruption by genetic mutations causes IL-1β-depended
  auto-inflammatory disease. (c) During homeostasis, sufficient geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
  is generated through the metabolic mevalonate pathway through the activities of
  MVK and the geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTase I) to appropriately geranylgeranylate
  small GTPases, including Kras and RhoA to tether them to the plasma membrane. Active,
  geranylgeranylated Kras regulates TLR-mediated PI3K/Akt1activation to balance transcription
  of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators and downregulates MEFV expression.
  At the same time activation of the RhoA effector kinases PKN1 and PKN2 results in
  phosphorylation of Pyrin on serine 208 and 242 and enables interaction with members
  of the 14-3-3 family, which guard activation of Pyrin.
