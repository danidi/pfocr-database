caption: The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in vertebrates utilizes the cilium as a signaling
  compartment. In the absence of the Hh ligand (A), the receptor Ptch resides in the
  cilium and through an unknown mechanism inhibits the transmembrane protein Smo.
  In the absence of ligand, the repressor forms of the Gli transcription factors inhibit
  Hh responsive gene transcription, while Gli activator is maintained in the cilia
  via Sufu binding.(B) Upon Hh binding, Ptch translocates out of the cilia membrane
  and its inhibition of Smo is alleviated. Activated Smo translocates into the cilia
  membrane and through unknown mechanisms the Gli activators translocate to the nucleus
  and activate Hh responsive gene expression.
