caption: Tetherin mediated restriction of HIV-1 assembly and release. (A) Tetherin
  resides in the plasma membrane and is constitutively recycled from the plasma membrane
  via endosomes and the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The antiviral activity of tetherin
  is counteracted by the Vpu and Nef proteins. During HIV-1 infection, Vpu binds to
  the transmembrane domain of tetherin in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi network
  and sequesters it in endosomal regions in a clathrin-dependent manner. This rerouting
  of tetherin from the plasma membrane leads to its degradation in lysosomes via the
  ESCRT pathway. SIV Nef, too, is able to antagonise tetherin activity by sequestering
  tetherin from the sites of virus assembly, leading to lysosomal degradation of the
  entrapped molecules. (B) In the absence of Vpu and Nef activity, tetherin accumulates
  at virus assembly sites and blocks virus release from the plasma membrane. This
  clustering of retained virions triggers a signalling cascade mediated by tetherin’s
  cytoplasmic tail that leads to NF-κB activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines.
  This sensing of retention is reliant on tetherin association with the actin cytoskeleton
  via the adaptor protein RICH2. (C) Signalling that ultimately leads to NF-κB activation
  triggered by the phosphorylation of tetherin monomers and recruitment of the Syk
  kinase. This in turn leads to recruitment of the E3 ligases TRAF2 and TRAF6, that
  with the E2 enzyme UBC13, and K63-ubiquitin-mediated activation of the kinase TAK1
  to activate NF-κB (D) Virions tethered at the cell surface are also exposed to anti-Env
  antibodies that thereby sensitise the infected cell to anti-HIV antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) responses from Fc-receptor expressing myeloid
  and NK cells. (E) Tetherin is able to further modulate the cell’s innate immunity
  through activation of the plasmacytoid dendritic cell specific leukocyte inhibitory
  receptor ILT7. Interaction with this ligand results in dampened TLR signals that
  thereby decrease type I interferon (IFN-I) production and enhancement of immune
  responses.
