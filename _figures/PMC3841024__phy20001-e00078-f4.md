caption: Representative ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of relationship between significant
  genes involved in the response to mechanical stretch and/or BIRB796 treatment in
  engineered cardiac tissues. IPA biological/gene network analysis indicates the interactions
  between groups of genes and how expression decreases (in green) or increases (in
  red). (A) Transcripts after 48 h of cyclic stretch. (B) Transcripts after to 48
  h of BIRB796. (C) Transcripts after 48 h of cyclic stretch and BIRB796. These transcripts
  appear to interact via the Akt complex and AKT1 kinase.
