caption: Complex, compartmentalized pathways of NADPH production. Metabolic tracing
  experiments have provided tools to follow the cytosolic production of NADPH through
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), as well as the contribution of serine/glycine
  metabolism to NADPH generation in the mitochondria. Given that mutant forms of isocitrate
  dehydrogenase (mtIDH1/2), localized to the cytosol (C) or mitochondria (M), respectively,
  give rise to increased 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) levels, this reporter system was
  used to trace the production of NADPH in the mitochondria from serine/glycine through
  methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (like) (MTHFD2/MTHFD2L) enzymes. p53 regulates
  NADPH production by inducing the expression of TIGAR, a fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase,
  which reduces the levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-P2), resulting in reduced
  activation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). This reduction in the rate of glycolysis,
  allows for shunting of glycolytic intermediates into the PPP and the concomitant
  generation of NADPH. HIF1α and Myc regulate the expression of serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT1/2) enzymes, thereby regulating serine/glycine metabolism. Tumor suppressors
  and oncogenes are shown in red and green, respectively. Important metabolic enzymes
  involved in these pathways are shown in blue. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; 6PG, 6-phosphogluconate;
  Ribulose-5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; Ribose-5P, ribose-5-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; α-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate.
