caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for huperzine A in fungal cells. Enzymes that
  were annotated in the transcriptome of fungal cells are presented in red, and those
  that could not be annotated are presented in black. Two arrows used for reversible
  reaction, and an arrow used for irreversible reaction
