caption: 'Clustered genes (A) and the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway (B). The generally
  accepted pathway for aflatoxin and ST biosynthesis is presented in panel B. The
  corresponding genes and their enzymes involved in each bioconversion step are shown
  in panel A. The vertical line represents the 82-kb aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway
  gene cluster and sugar utilization gene cluster in A. parasiticus and A. flavus.
  The new gene names are given on the left of the vertical line and the old gene names
  are given on the right. Arrows along the vertical line indicate the direction of
  gene transcription. The ruler at far left indicates the relative sizes of these
  genes in kilobases. The ST biosynthetic pathway genes in A. nidulans are indicated
  at the right of panel B. Arrows in panel B indicate the connections from the genes
  to the enzymes they encode, from the enzymes to the bioconversion steps they are
  involved in, and from the intermediates to the products in the aflatoxin bioconversion
  steps. Abbreviations: NOR, norsolorinic acid; AVN, averantin; HAVN, 5′-hydroxyaverantin;
