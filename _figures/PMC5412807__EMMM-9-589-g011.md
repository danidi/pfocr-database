caption: In genetically predisposed individuals, the virus infection causes the activation
  of TLR‐7/8 and/or RIG‐I, and subsequently triggers IL‐23 release by CD11c+ DCs via
  the NF‐κB pathway. Genetic mutations in NF‐κB‐related genes result in an impaired
  negative regulation of its proinflammatory activity accompanied by uncontrolled
  IL‐23 release, thus leading to psoriasis.
