caption: A CHOP-calcium pathway of ER stress-induced apoptosis in macrophages. A diverse
  array of ER stress-provoking events, many of which exist in advanced atheromata,
  trigger the UPR and lead to induction of the downstream effector CHOP. CHOP induces
  ERO1α, which in turn oxidatively activates IP3R calcium release channels in the
  ER. IP3R-mediated calcium release begins a pro-apoptotic cascade involving activation
  of CaMKII by cytosolic calcium and subsequent downstream apoptotic processes, as
  listed in the figure and as described in the text. In addition, the resulting low
  level of calcium in the ER lumen likely causes dysfunction of calcium-dependent
  protein chaperones, which amplifies UPR activation. The central concept is that
  pro-apoptotic CHOP functions, at least in part, by promoting calcium-induced death
  as part of a positive feedback cycle (see inset).
