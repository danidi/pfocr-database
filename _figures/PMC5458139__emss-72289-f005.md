caption: Based on the predominant cytosine mutagenesis at a TpC sequence context,
  the APOBEC family of enzymes has been implicated in causing both localised kataegis
  and genome-wide Signatures 2 and 13. (A) APOBECs cause DNA damage particularly on
  ssDNA, by deaminating cytosine into uracil. Uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) first removes
  uracil before other components of the Base Excision Repair pathway restore the damaged
  DNA to its original state. If DNA is uncorrected and enters replication as uracil
  or an abasic site, then the possibilities are of generating C>T transition or C>G
  and C>A transversion mutations. (B) Although APOBECs are involved in both localised
  and genome-wide mutagenesis, there is mounting experimental and analytical evidence
  to support the hypotheses that these signatures arise by different mechanisms. Kataegis
  is believed to require a double-strand break (DSB) to arise first, before end-resection
  of the DSB leaves ssDNA exposed for APOBEC deamination (left-side panel). By contrast,
  APOBEC deamination that gives rise to Signatures 2 and 13 requires long stretches
  of ssDNA that could occur during uncoupling of the leading and lagging replication
  strands (right-side panel).
