caption: Model of RKIP function. The activation of MEK by Raf-1 requires physical
  interaction between Raf-1 and MEK. RKIP binding to either Raf-1 or MEK dissociates
  Raf-MEK complexes and thereby interrupts MEK activation and downstream signaling.
  The binding of RKIP to Raf-1 is negatively regulated by mitogens.
