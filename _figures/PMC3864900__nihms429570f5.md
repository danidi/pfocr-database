caption: MARCH1 (membrane-associated RING-CH 1)-mediated ubiquitylation of MHC class
  II molecules promotes their endolysosomal degradation, thus controlling the level
  of cell-surface expression of MHC class II molecules. MHC class I expression is
  regulated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation pathway and by
  endolysosomal degradation, both of which are controlled by ubiquitylation. MHC class
  I ubiquitylation can be mediated by viral E3 ligases, such as modulator of immune
  response (MIR) proteins, or by cellular E3 enzymes, such as HMG-CoA reductase degradation
  1 (HRD1). Other cellular E3 ligases can be exploited by viral proteins; for example,
  the TRC8-mediated ubiquitylation of MHC class I molecules is induced by the human
  cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein US2.
