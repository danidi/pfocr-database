caption: Proposed model for an underlying P2XR-channel purinergic signaling loop within
  the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion coupling pathway. An increase in the extracellular
  glucose concentration leads to a series of events that result in the secretion of
  ATP and zinc into the islet microenvironment. Extracellular ATP and zinc bind to
  and activate a specific subtype of P2XR channels expressed by β-cells. The stimulation
  of these ATP-gated and zinc-modulated P2XR channels activates calcium influx from
  extracellular stores that synergizes with voltage-dependent calcium channel-driven
  calcium influx to enhance glucose-stimulated insulin secretion

  P2X purinergic receptor channels expressed by islet beta-cells to potentiate insulin
  secretion.
