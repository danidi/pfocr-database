caption: mTOR activation promotes pathological hypertrophy during pressure overload.
  However, mTOR kinase is also required for physiological mechanisms that are necessary
  for cardiac adaptation to cardiac overload. The pharmacological modulators of mTOR
  and the animal models with genetic modifications of the components of the mTOR signaling
  pathway that have been used in the studies focused on the role of mTOR in cardiac
  hypertrophy are displayed.
