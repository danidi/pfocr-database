caption: A. Regulatory network model of fruA expression. Expression of fruA is a key
  step in the induction of developmental gene expression and the achievement of multicellular
  fruiting body formation and sporulation. During vegetative growth, mrpC is transcribed
  at low levels, using its own product (MrpC) as a transcription factor (positive
  feedback). When starvation signals trigger the expression of genes in a two component
  system (TCS) the newly synthesized MrpC is not phosphorylated, but is instead processed
  to MrpC2, which has a higher affinity for the mrpC and fruA promoter regions . A
  PSTK network inhibits development by phosphorylating MrpC. B. The Protein Serine-Threonine
  Kinase (PSTK) network model. PSTK network is thought to consist of at least five
  kinases (squares) as well as three multikinase associated proteins (Mkaps). Double-headed
  arrows indicate interactions identified by yeast-two hybrid screens, while gray
  arrows are characterized phosphorylation pathways . PskA5, a protein kinase activated
  by PktC2, phosphorylates MrpC, reducing its affinity for both mrpC and fruA promoter
  regions, and preventing untimely initiation of development. In this paper, PktA2,
  C2, D1 and D9 were deletion targets. The pskA5 locus is closely linked to that of
  mrpC/mrpC2 and therefore was not a candidate for in-frame deletion.
