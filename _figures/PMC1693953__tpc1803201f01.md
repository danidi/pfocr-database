caption: The Metabolic Fate of Fatty Acid Hydroperoxides.Fatty acid hydroperoxides
  [only the 13(S)-hydroperoxy derivative of linolenic acid is shown] are channeled
  into seven distinct pathways for oxylipin biosynthesis. The committed steps are
  catalyzed by AOS for JA biosynthesis, divinylether synthase for the formation of
  divinyl ethers, lipoxygenase for the formation of keto polyunsaturated fatty acids
  (PUFAs), hydroperoxide reductase in the formation of hydroxy PUFAs, epoxyalcohol
  synthase and peroxygenase resulting in epoxy hydroxy PUFAs, and hydroperoxide lyase
  for the production of leaf aldehydes (green leaf volatiles). In the AOS branch,
  the Vick and Zimmerman pathway for JA biosynthesis is shown. 13-LOX, 13-lipoxygenase;
  OPR3, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 3. Figure adapted from  and .
