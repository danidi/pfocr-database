caption: Schematic diagram of the role of IL-33 in the regulation of the biological
  behavior of glioma cells. IL-33 stimulates MMP2/MMP9 expression via the NF-κB signaling
  pathway, and enhances cell migration and invasion.
pmcid: PMC5652951
papertitle: IL-33 enhances glioma cell migration and invasion by upregulation of MMP2
  and MMP9 via the ST2-NF-κB pathway.
