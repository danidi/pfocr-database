caption: Upon activation by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), PI3 Kinase which is comprised
  of a p85 regulatory and p110 catalytic domain converts PIP2 to PIP3. PIP3 subsequently
  interacts with proteins containing PH domains, such as PDK1 and AKT, allowing for
  membrane recruitment (dark arrows). PDK1 phosphorylates AKT and other downstream
  targets including PKA, PKC isoforms, PAK, SGK, and other targets to regulate cell
  behavior. In the case of AKT, an additional phosphorylation by a PDK2 activity mediated
  by one of several kinases (see text) is required for full activation. PI3K signaling
  is inhibited by the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN which converts PIP3 to PIP2.
  RTKs also activate the RAS/RAF/MEK signaling cascade which has important biological
  effects as well. RAS is also a site of cross-talk between these pathways through
  its ability to activate PI3K. Genetic alterations that result in constitutive signaling
  occur in thyroid cancer; the location of these alterations in these pathways are
  underlined and notified with an asterisk.
