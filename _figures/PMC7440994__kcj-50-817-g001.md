caption: Factor Xa and thrombin contribute to atherothrombotic events through various
  mechanisms. Factor Xa (via PAR-1 and PAR-2) and thrombin (via PAR-1 and PAR-4) regulate
  the activation of endothelial cells, leukocytes, platelets, and vascular SMCs. PAR-mediated
  signaling are involved in endothelial cell activation and dysfunction, inflammatory
  process by production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and proliferation
  and apoptosis of vascular SMCs. Sustained inflammation in the lesion induces plaque
  instability and promotes plaque rupture. Thrombin is critical for platelet activation
  (via PAR-1 and PAR-4) and fibrin formation, which contribute to platelet-fibrin
  clot formation after plaque rupture. This experimental study showed that dabigatran
  has a potential to decrease progression of atherosclerotic plaque through reducing
  PFCS, and increasing spontaneous thrombolytic activity and eNOS.eNOS = endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; PAI-1 = plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; PAR = protease-activated
  receptor; PFCS = platelet-fibrin clot strength; SMC = smooth muscle cell; TAFI =
  thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor; TEG = thromboelastography.
