caption: Hh signaling pathway and RUSKI Hhat inhibitors. (a) Canonical Hh signaling
  requires production of dually lipidated Shh signaling protein. Shh is C-terminally
  autocholesterylated and N-terminally palmitoylated by Hhat. Modified Shh is secreted
  and recognized by its receptor Ptch, which releases inhibition of Smo, thereby triggering
  downstream target expression under Gli promoter control. (b) Hhat inhibitors used
  in the current study and their reported IC50 values against recombinant Hhat.
