caption: Model for PAR2signaling from apical and basolateral surfaces. Apical and
  basolateral PAR2 would be accessible to different proteolytic agonists, leading
  to distinct responses. Activation of both PAR2 pools leads to activation of traditional
  Gαq (which leads to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis into inositol
  triphosphate and diacylglycerol), mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and activation
  of PKC. ERK1/2 activation by basolateral PAR2 is mediated by both the Gαq-dependent
  pathway and a β-arrestin-dependent pathway but is independent of PKC; the majority
  of ERK1/2 activated by this pathway does not translocate to the nucleus. PAR2 activated
  at the apical surface activates ERK1/2 and requires typical Gαq-dependent signals
  such as Ca2+ and PKC, but it does not require β-arrestins. Basolateral but not apical
  PAR2 is capable of promoting AP-1 activation, which may occur indirectly via phosphorylation
  of a cytoplasmic protein kinase, such as p90Rsk. Transcriptional targets of apical
  PAR2 have not yet been identified but likely involve nuclear ERK1/2. Basolateral
  but not apical PAR2 stimulated short-circuit current changes, which have been reported
  to involve Ca2+, ERK1/2, and transactivation of EGF receptor. Basolateral but not
  apical PAR2 also activates cofilin via a β-arrestin-dependent-pathway, leading to
  generation of free actin barbed ends at tight junctions (TJ).
