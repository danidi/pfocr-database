caption: 'Tissue alcohol metabolism contributes to tissue and organ injury through
  altered redox potential, generation of ROS, and generation of metabolites, such
  as acetaldehyde, that form DNA and protein adducts. Alcohol (ethanol) is metabolized
  to acetaldehyde primarily by ADH in the cytosol and CYP2E1 in the endoplasmic reticulum.
  Acetaldehyde is converted to acetate in the mitochondria by the enzyme ALDH. Acetaldehyde
  can form adducts with DNA and proteins that can produce injury through activation
  of immune responses. During the oxidative process, both ADH and ALDH reactions reduce
  NAD+ to NADH, shifting the cellular redox ratio. In addition, the cytochrome P450
  enzymes, particularly CYP2E1, contribute to the oxidation of alcohol to acetaldehyde,
  particularly at increasing alcohol concentrations, as well as following their induction
  by chronic alcohol misuse. The pathway of alcohol oxidation results in the production
  of large amounts of ROS, including H2O2, and is thought to be an important mechanism
  contributing to alcoholic liver injury. ROS are eliminated by antioxidants like
  GSH under normal conditions. Alcohol depletes cellular GSH stores, thereby exacerbating
  ROS-mediated injury. ROS can interact with lipids, producing lipid peroxidation,
  which leads to formation of reactive molecules such as MDA and HNE, which can then
  form protein adducts. Note: Acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase;
