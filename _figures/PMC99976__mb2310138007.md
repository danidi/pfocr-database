caption: Model of C. elegans EGL-15/FGFR signaling. EGL-15 activation leads to the
  phosphorylation of SOC-1 on tyrosine 408; this event triggers PTP-2 recruitment
  and/or activation. In addition, EGL-15 activates the canonical SEM-5/SOS-1/RAS/MAPK
  pathway. Potential targets of the SOC-1/PTP-2 cassette and/or its role in modulating
  activity of the RAS/MAPK cascade are indicated by dashed lines. Precisely how activation
  of EGL-15 triggers SOC-1 and SEM-5 to participate in EGL-15 signal transduction
  remains unresolved (indicated by dashed lines from the receptor).
