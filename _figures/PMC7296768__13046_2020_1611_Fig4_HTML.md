caption: A non-Smad TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in tissue fibrosis by promoting
  endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Following ligand-initiated activation
  of the Smad-independent TGF-β pathway, GSK-3β is phosphorylated by c-Abl and PKC-δ
  non-receptor kinases. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β at serine 9 (Ser9) causes its inhibition,
  which allows Snail1 to enter the nucleus. Nuclear accumulation of Snail1 leads to
  acquisition of the myofibroblast phenotype characterized by stimulation of α-SMA
  and type I collagen instead of VE-cadherin. The specific inhibition of c-Abl activity
  with imatinib allows GSK-3β to phosphorylate Snail1, which targets it for proteasomal
  degradation, thereby abolishing the acquisition of the myofibroblastic phenotype
  and the fibrotic response. Rottlerin and imatinib inhibit PKC-δ and c-Abl, respectively,
  which is why both agents abrogate EndoMT []. Note that ‘p’ indicates phosphorylation.
  Black arrows indicate induction or promotion, whereas blue arrows indicate inhibition
