caption: 'Model: the Wnt/β-catenin asymmetry pathway patterns LIN-32 expression during
  ray development to diversify ray cell fates. Shading of nuclei indicates LIN-32
  expression; “SYS/POP” refers to the SYS-1/POP-1 ratio that determines the output
  of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In addition to regulation by lin-17 and
  lin-44, our findings also indicate a possible role for cell-intrinsic polarity-generating
  mechanisms. For details, see Discussion.'
