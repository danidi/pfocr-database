caption: Phylogenetic relationships of algae thiorredoxin-like ferredoxin domains.
  Detailed rooted circular phylogram representation of the non Nuo24 clades of the
  tree generated by the maximum likelihood (ML) method (500 bootstraps) on the conserved
  regions of thiorredoxin-like ferredoxin domains of the species detailed in Table 
  and Additional file . Gray circles represent ML bootstrap values > 50. IDs correspond
  to Uniprot IDs. Labels in bold are algal sequences. Other sequences from species
  not included in Additional file  were also added to the analysis and are shown by
  their Uniprot IDs. The scale bar represents 0.1 amino acid substitution per site.
  The inset is an unrooted radial phylogram representation of the whole tree, which
  includes the Nuo24 clades, with the ML bootstrap values for the four main subgroups.
  To view the trimmed MSA used to reconstruct the tree in Phylip format and the raw
  consensus tree in Newick format, see Additional file . Suc-Fer, ferredoxin-like
  sucrases
