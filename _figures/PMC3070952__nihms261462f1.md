caption: Essential features of the PERK signaling temporal delay circuit. UPR-induced
  dimerization and transautophosphorylation of PERK in the ER results in phosphorylation
  of eIF2α, which inhibits global translation in the cell by suppressing ribosome
  assembly, induces the specific translation of the ATF4 transcription factor. ATF4
  activates expression of other transcription factors including ATF3 and CHOP. CHOP
  induces expression of GADD34, which is a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase,
  PP1, and targets this complex to effect the dephosphorylation of phospho-eIF2α.
  The time taken to express this set of proteins constitutes the time delay, during
  which the cell reduces protein accumulation in the ER by dislocation of the misfolded
  nascent chains and proteolysis through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
