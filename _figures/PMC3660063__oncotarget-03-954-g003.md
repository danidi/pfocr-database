caption: ERK and Akt can phosphorylate many targets which serve to regulate cell proliferation.
  In Panel A, some of the effects of ERK and Akt on the translation of highly structured
  mRNAs are indicated. Kinases are indicated in green ovals or rectangles (mTORC1
  and mTORC2 complexes). TSC1 and TSC2 are indicated in black squares. Rheb is indicated
  in a dark blue oval. mTOR interacting proteins which positively regulate mTOR activity
  are indicated in yellow ovals. mTOR interactiving proteins which negatively regulate
  mTOR activity are indicated in black ovals. mRNA initiation factors and proteins
  associated with the ribosome are indicated in purple ovals. In Panel B, some of
  the effects on the regulation of gene expression by ERK and Akt phosphorylation
  are indicated. Transcription factors activated by either ERK or Akt phosphorylation
  are indicated in yellow diamonds. The Foxo transcription factor that is inactivated
  by Akt phosphorylation is indicated by a black diamond. Beta-catenin is indicated
  in an orange rectangle. In Panel C, some of the effects of ERK and Akt phosphorylation
  on apoptotic regulatory molecules are indicated. Molecules such as Mcl-1 which are
  anti-apoptotic and phosphorylated by ERK and Akt are indicated by blue ovals, other
  anti-apoptotic molecule are also indicated by blue ovals. Pro-apoptotic molecules
  are indicated by black ovals. Red arrows indicate activating events in pathways.
  Black arrows indicate inactivating events in pathway. Activating phosphorylation
  events are depicted in red circles with Ps with a black outlined circle. Inactivating
  phosphorylation events are depicted in black circles with Ps with a red outlined
  circle.
