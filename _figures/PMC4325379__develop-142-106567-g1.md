caption: An overview of melanocyte development. (A) In mammals, melanoblasts are specified
  from neural crest cells (NCCs) via a SOX10-positive melanoblast/glial bipotent progenitor.
  SOX10 expression remains switched on in both of these lineages. Melanoblasts subsequently
  are specified and acquire MITF, DCT and KIT expression. After colonising the developing
  embryonic hair follicles, some melanoblasts differentiate into melanocytes and produce
  the pigment (melanin) that colours the first hair cycle. A subset of melanoblasts
  dedifferentiate (losing MITF and KIT expression but not DCT) to form melanocyte
  stem cells in the hair follicle bulge that replenish the differentiated melanocytes
  via a rapidly proliferating transit-amplifying cell in the subsequent hair cycles.
  The image on the far right is of a transgenic mouse embryo expressing lacZ under
  control of the melanoblast promoter Dct. X-Gal staining reveals blue-stained melanoblasts,
  in particular those migrating from the cervical neural crest and in the head. Also
  stained are the telencephalon, the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the retinal pigmented
  epithelium of the eye. (B) In zebrafish, there are distinct embryonic and adult
  pigmentation patterns, as illustrated in the images on the far right. The melanoblasts
  that form both these patterns originate from a SOX10-positive neural crest-derived
  progenitor. The embryonic pattern is formed by melanocytes that develop directly
  from this progenitor via an MITF+ melanoblast. The melanoblasts that form the adult
  pattern are derived from a melanocyte stem cell population that resides at the dorsal
  route ganglia (DRG) and is specified by an ERB- and KIT-dependent pathway in the
  embryo.
