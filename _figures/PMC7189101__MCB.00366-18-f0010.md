caption: Proposed model showing the connecting link between AKT and MASTL signaling
  during mitosis. Activation of the PI3K pathway leads to the phosphorylation and
  activation of AKT. Activated AKT, in turn, leads to the phosphorylation of MASTL
  at residue T299, thereby leading to MASTL activation. Once activated, MASTL leads
  to the phosphorylation of ENSA, resulting in the inactivation of PP2A-B55δ, a regulatory
  B subunit of PP2A. As a result, the CDK1-cyclin B complex remains activated, leading
  to the phosphorylation of numerous substrates, including MASTL, which plays an important
  role in the entry and progression of the cells into mitosis through PP2A inhibition.
