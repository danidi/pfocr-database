caption: Nutrient deprivation leads to an increase in NAD+ and a decrease in nicotinamide
  (NAM), which in turn leads to activation of SIRT1 and 35kDa peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-gamma co-activator-1□ (PGC1-α) in the mitochondrion resulting in an increase
  in oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism. NAM and NADH act as inhibitors
  of SIRT1. NAM phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) catalyzes conversion of NAM to NAD+.
  Exercise has been shown to increase Nampt activity in human muscle and also circulates
  to increase insulin sensitivity. In turn, Nampt decreases NAM and increases NAD+
  resulting in further activation of the SIRT1- PGC1-α pathway and increasing mitochondrial
  function. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) likely regulates SIRT1 by acting as
  an energy sensor and activates Nampt. Thus, the net effect of nutritional restriction
  and exercise is to increase NAD+ and drive the SIRT1- PGC1-α pathway towards improved
  mitochondrial function.
