caption: 'The reaction crossed out in red is dysfunctional in this particular transgenic
  strain. Two rows of colored boxes are placed either above horizontally plotted fluxes,
  or to the left of vertically plotted fluxes. The first row represents wild-type
  plants, whereas the second row refers to transgenic line (here a CCoAOMT-deficient
  plant). Each row contains seven colored boxes, which represent the seven stem internodes
  (with internodes 1 and 2 merged). In FBA and MOMA, all fluxes are normalized to
  the initial step in the pathway, namely the conversion of phenylalanine to cinnamic
  acid. Therefore, the color of each box shows the normalized steady-state value of
  the corresponding flux in one specific internode: low values are dark blue, intermediate
  values are white, and high values are dark red. Because all the reactions along
  a linear pathway have the same flux values at steady state, only the first one is
  shown.'
