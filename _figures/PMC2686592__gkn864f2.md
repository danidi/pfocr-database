caption: Example of information retrieval using the Bionemo web site. A standard case
  of use could start by browsing a pathway and its regulatory elements. From there,
  the user can navigate to different views. Then, by clicking on a reaction name,
  the user will be taken to a new page showing all the enzymatic complexes able to
  perform that reaction, and from there to one describing proteins, their coding genes,
  their transcriptional organization and the transcription factors involved.
