caption: Proposed disruption of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) pathway
  in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) aortopathy. (A) Typically, eNOS produces NO in endothelial
  cells. NO increases activation of guanylyl cyclase (GC) in smooth muscle cells,
  leading to phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). (B)
  Under pathologic conditions such as bicuspid aortic valve, eNOS function may become
  uncoupled from NO synthesis. Production of superoxide anion predominates and NO
  levels decline. Uncoupled eNOS function can lead to oxidative stress and altered
  vascular wall remodeling. (BH4 = tetrahydrobiopterin; cGMP = cyclic guanosine monophosphate;
  GTP = guanosine 5’-triphosphate.)
