caption: Under hypoxic conditions the expression of prolyl hydroxylase domain proteins
  (PHDs) is reduced leading to an induction of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)
  expression, which becomes stable and active as a transcription factor, together
  with hypoxia inducible factor 1β (HIF1β). HIF1 activation regulates the expression
  of several target genes whose products address the needs of oxygen starved cells,
  such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A), BCL-2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa-interacting
  protein 3 (BNIP3), glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and glycolytic enzymes such as
  carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). Hypoxia also influences mechanistic/mammalian target
  of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signalling mainly mediated through hypoxic activation
  of the TSC1-TSC2 complex by REDD1. First, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI(3)K)
  and protein kinase B (AKT) have been implicated in the activation of the mTOR protein
  kinase. One critical target of AKT that regulates mTOR is the tumour suppressor
  protein, tuberin (TSC2). Tuberin negatively regulates mTOR signalling, and AKT activation
  circumvents this inhibition. Constitutive mTOR signalling positively stimulates
  S6 kinase (S6K), a downstream effector of mTOR pathway, which mainly drives cell
  growth and proliferation. Also, mTOR enhances the protein levels of HIF and consequently
  enhances the expression of HIF target genes. Second, under conditions of hypoxia,
  intracellular ATP levels drop and AMP levels rise. AMP directly binds to a subunit
  of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is then phosphorylated by serine/threonine
  protein kinase 11 (STK11/LKB1). Elevated concentrations of AMPK can cause a complete
  inhibition of mTOR (mTORC1) activity without affecting PI(3)K-AKT signalling.
