caption: 'The two pathways via which binding of cardiotonic steroids to the Na+/K+-ATPase
  exerts genomic and non-genomic effects. In the classic ‘ionic’ pathway (left), inhibition
  of the pump function of the Na+/K+-ATPase by CTS results in an increase in cytosolic
  sodium concentration and a decrease in cytosolic potassium concentration. These
  changes induce an increase in cytosolic calcium level, which in turn activates a
  variety of pathways with genomic and non-genomic effects. The pump function of the
  caveolar Na+/K+-ATPase might be more sensitive to CTS than that of the noncaveolar
  Na+/K+-ATPase. The ‘signaling’ pathway (right) involves the association of Src with
  the Na+/K+-ATPase in a caveolar domain. Binding of CTS to the Na+/K+-ATPase activates
  Src, which in turn transactivates the EGFR and PLC, leading to a cascade that involves
  generation of ROS, activation of ERK through activation of MEK, activation of Akt
  (protein kinase B) via PI(3)K, stimulation of endocytosis and activation of PKC.
  These steps induce the genomic and non-genomic effects of CTS. Note that both the
  classic and signaling pathways allow intervention at the level of the binding of
  CTS to the Na+/K+-ATPase, by immunoneutralization or pharmacological antagonism;
  however, the signaling pathway presents several additional targets for interference,
  such as Src activation and transactivation of the EGFR, PLC activation, activation
  of MEK, generation of ROS and activation of PI(3)K. Modulation of the signaling
  pathway at the level of PKC, ERK and Akt might also be possible. Abbreviations:
  CTS, cardiotonic steroids; EGFR; epidermal growth factor receptor; ERK, extracellular
  regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Na+/K+-ATPase, sodium/potassium-transporting
  ATPase; PI(3)K, phosphoinositide-3 kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase
  C; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
