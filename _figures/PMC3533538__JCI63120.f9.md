caption: Upon infection of target cells, the presence of CHIKV RNA in the cytoplasm
  can be detected by pathogen receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5 to trigger the innate
  immune response. Consequentially, this leads to the activation of signaling pathways
  that regulate IRF3 and IRF7 to induce type I IFN expression. Secretion of type I
  IFNs to their receptors then induces the JAK/STAT pathway for the regulation of
  a positive feedback loop for type I IFN production via IRF7. In parallel, induction
  of type I IFN signaling leads to the expression of various ISGs regulated by ISGF3
  to control CHIKV infection. Viperin is induced and targeted to the ER via the N-terminal
  amphipathic α-helical domain. This triggers an ER stress response that activates
  PKR to interfere with the synthesis of viral proteins essential for CHIKV replication.
  Synthesis of CHIKV nsP2, a helicase/protease, acts to contravene the type I IFN–mediated
  JAK/STAT signaling pathway. However, viperin induction could circumvent CHIKV nsP2
  and control CHIKV replication, emphasizing its role as a multifunctional protein.
