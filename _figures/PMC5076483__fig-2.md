caption: The scheme of the SUMOylation pathway and regulation of PKCζ to increase
  EC dysfunction by atheroprone flow. (A) Protein SUMOylation is achieved by a recycle
  system consisting of conjugation and deconjugation pathways (, , , ). SUMO proteins
  covalently modify certain residues of specific target substrates and change the
  function of these substrates. Both conjugation and deconjugation enzymes mediate
  a dynamic and reversible process of SUMOylation. First, the E1-activating enzymes,
  SAE1-SAE2 heterodimers, activate the mature form of SUMO (). SUMO is then transferred
  to Ubc9, an E2 conjugase, forming a thioester bond between Ubc9 and SUMO (). Last,
  SUMO E3 ligases, including a family of protein inhibitors such as activated STAT
  (PIAS1-4), regulate SUMO transfer to the target substrate containing the free ɛ-amino
  group of a lysine residue mediated by Ubc9 (). DeSUMOylation enzymes are also involved
  in the process of SUMOylation. SENPs (SENP1–7) catalyze the deconjugation of SUMOylated
  substrates or edit the SUMO precursor into a matured form, which terminates with
  a pair of glycine residues (, ). Reprinted and modified from Woo et al. (). (B)
  Atheroprone flow (d-flow) uniquely activates PKCζ, which increases PKCζ-PIAS4 binding
  at the SP-RING domain and PIAS4 SUMO E3 ligase activity, subsequently increasing
  p53 SUMOylation. PIAS, protein inhibitor of activated STAT; SAP, scaffold attachment
  factor-A/B, acinus, and PIAS domain; PINIT, Pro-Ile-Asn-Ile-Thr motif; SP-RING,
  Siz/PIAS-RING domain. Reprinted and modified from Abe and Berk (). EC, endothelial
  cell; SENPs, Sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases. To see this illustration in color,
