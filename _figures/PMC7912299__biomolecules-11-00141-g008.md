caption: 'Mitochondrial and cytosolic pathways leading to D2-L2 hydroxyglutaric acid
  (D-L-2HG) accumulation (see text for explanation). The proposed model envisions
  that as a consequence of disruption of CIC-mediated citrate export activity, cytosolic
  citrate is reduced, leading to loss of the feedback loop on PFK. This leads to enhanced
  glycolysis and production of pyruvate, which, on one side, is converted to lactate,
  resulting in lactic acidosis. Excess pyruvate also enters mitochondria, where it
  is converted to citrate/isocitrate. Due to a lack of the export activity of CIC,
  this excess citrate is converted to TCA cycle intermediates downstream of citrate,
  leading to accumulation of α-KG and also of succinate, fumarate and malate (not
  shown in the figure), which are then secreted in urine. In red are the potential
  steps for conversion of α-KG to L-2HG or D-2HG, by either IDH1 or IDH2; in blue
  are the enzymes involved in the degradation pathway. IDH1/IDH2m or wt: mutant or
  wild-type forms of these enzymes. See text for additional abbreviations.'
