caption: Diagrammatic representation of constitutively activated TGF-β-signaling-mediated
  tissue fibrosis. Schematic diagram representing signaling pathway initiated by constitutive
  activation of signaling through the TBRI. The constitutively active TBRI mediates
  the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 that along with Smad4 then translocates to the nucleus
  where it binds to gene promoters and mediates the increased expression of TGF-β-regulated
  transcription factors such as Snai1, Snai2 and Twist as well as the TGF-β receptors
  I and II. This induces an autocrine loop resulting in increased TGF-β expression
  and signaling. One consequence of this is the induction of endothelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EndoMT), resulting in increased numbers of activated myofibroblasts.
  Activated myofibroblasts are responsible for increased expression and production
  of the fibrillar type I and III collagens and other extracellular matrix components
  such as Fn-1 and Fn-Eda that contribute to progressive tissue fibrosis.
