caption: (A) Non-ligand mediated signaling (mutational activation). Mutations in PTCH1,
  SMO, SUFU or amplification of GLI1 have all been reported in human cacners. i. Loss
  of PTCH1 activity may increase Hh pathway activity. ii. Overexpression or activating
  mutations in SMO are also depicted. (B) Ligand mediated autocrine signaling. Tumor
  cells produce Hh ligand that stimulates Hh pathway activity in tumor cells. (C)
  Ligand mediated paracrine signaling. Non-malignant stromal cells produces Hh ligand
  required by tumor cells for growth and survival. (D) Ligand mediated paracrine signaling.
  Tumor cells produce Hh ligand that activates Hh signaling in non-malignant stromal
  and endothelial cells. This results in the production of unknown factors within
  the microenvironment that ultimately supports tumor cell growth and survival as
  well as angiogenesis.
