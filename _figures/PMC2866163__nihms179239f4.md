caption: The SIRT1-AMPK metabolic control network. Conditions of perceived energy
  deprivation, such as fasting, calorie restriction (CR), and exercise, increase the
  AMP/ATP ratio and activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Energy deprivation
  also increases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels and activates the
  NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity of SIRT1. Activated AMPK and SIRT1 converge
  by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha
  (PGC-1α) via phosphorylation and deacetylation, respectively, to induce mitochondrial
  biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Cross talk in this pathway occurs because AMPK
  activity increases NAD+, and SIRT1 also activates AMPK.
