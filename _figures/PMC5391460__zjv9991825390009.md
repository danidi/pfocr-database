caption: NEAT1 exerts antihantaviral effects by acting as positive feedback for RIG-I
  signaling. Innate immunity is the first line of defense against microbe invasion.
  Host PRRs such as RIG-I can recognize the PAMPs of viruses and induce robust innate
  immune responses against viral infection. Known signaling is shown in boxes outlined
  in red. Our research indicated that RIG-I and DDX60 might interact with each other
  to recognize HTNV, which, on the one hand, promotes IFN and cytokine production,
  and, on the other hand, induces NEAT1 transcription through the RIG-I–IRF7 pathway.
  As positive feedback, NEAT1 promoted RIG-I and DDX60 expression and enhanced HTNV-induced
  IFN responses. The specific molecular mechanism might be that NEAT1 relocates SFPQ
  from the potential promoter region to paraspeckles in the nucleus, thereby facilitating
  the expression of multiple antiviral genes. Taken together, the lncRNA NEAT1 can
  exert antihantaviral effects by modulating host innate immune responses.
