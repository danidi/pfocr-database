caption: Model of the signaling cascade in response to the release of dsRNA from LRV
  particles, production of IFNβ and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
  The main pathway involved in this process is highlighted in bold. (1) Phagocytosis
  of LRV infected promastigotes by phagocytes (macrophages); (2) promastigotes differentiate
  into amatigotes, which reside in phagolysosomes; (3) death of some parasites (promastigotes
  and amastigotes), release of LRV and of dsRNA, which binds to TLR3; (4) activation
  of TLR3 via TRIF and signal transmission via the transcription factors IRF3 and
  NFκB; (5) activation and secretion of IFNβ; (6) binding of IFNβ to its receptor
  and activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines genes (autocrine loop);
  (7) synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as
  TNFα, IL-6, CCL and CXCL10 leading to increased parasitemia and pathology.
