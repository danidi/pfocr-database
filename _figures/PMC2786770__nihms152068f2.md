caption: The model depicts the multiple pathways used by biosynthetic cargo proteins
  to reach their final destinations from the TGN. Arrows indicate the paths from one
  organelle to the next. Specific cargo proteins that are thought to utilize each
  route are noted on the right. Direct routes to the apical and basolateral surface
  as well as a pathway via the basolateral early endosomes (BEE; pathways 1 and 2)
  are predicted but have not been experimentally verified. AEE, apical early endosome;
  ARE, apical recycling endosome; CRE, common recycling endosome. Trafficking pathways
  to the primary cilium are not well defined and are omitted in this model, as are
  the trafficking routes used by proteins not destined for the plasma membrane. Refer
  the text for additional details.
