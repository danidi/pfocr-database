caption: 'Mechanism of action of various vaccine candidates: I) Recombinant Virus
  Vector act as an endogenous antigen, thus after processing in the proteasome, they
  are presented by MHC I to the CD8+ Tc cells leading to Cell Mediated Immune (CMI)
  response; II) DNA Vaccine are transcribed and translated in the host cell, the protein
  synthesized then moves to MHC class I pathway or the protein would be released outside
  the host cell where it act as an exogenous antigen and are presented by MHC II to
  the CD4+ TH cells leading to humoral immune response, also release of some cytokines
  by TH cells leads to CMI response as well; III) mRNA vaccines exposed PAMP (Pathogen
  Associated Molecular Pattern)are recognized by the soluble PRR (Pathogen Recognition
  Receptor) endocytosed and lead to MHC class II pathway, Thus eliciting the humoral
  immune response.'
