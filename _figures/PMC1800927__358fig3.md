caption: A model of the yeast response to osmotic and calcium stress. The model contains
  (left to right) the calcineurin pathway, PKA signaling pathway, the HOG MAPK pathway,
  including its Sln1–Ssk1 and Sho1–Ste11 upstream branches, and the mating/pseudohyphal
  growth pathways. The network, constructed based on literature reports, contains
  environmental conditions (dark gray), signaling components (light gray ovals), transcription
  factors (double ovals) and their transcriptional targets (white ovals). Targets
  sharing the same regulatory logics (i.e., in the same module) are indicated by black
  diamonds. Arrows are well-established relations (solid lines) or relations predicted
  by the refinement procedure (dashed lines). The logic by which each component is
  governed by its regulators is described in Supplement A. The dual role of the MAPKKK
  Ste11 in the HOG and mating pathways is formalized by refining two different model
  variables called Ste11 and Ste11M, respectively.
