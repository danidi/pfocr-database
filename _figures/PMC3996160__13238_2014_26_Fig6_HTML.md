caption: A hypothetical model depicting the mechanisms used by SARS-CoV PLpro-TM to
  disrupt the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex required for activation of the IFN-β production
  pathway. (A) Viral infections are sensed by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs),
  which in turn recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and trigger
  antiviral responses. RIG-I identifies the 5′-3p RNA, and then interacts with MAVS
  to activate the IFN responses factor 3 (IRF3). In MAMs (mitochondrial-associated
  membranes), MAVS also interacts with STING that locates at the ER (endoplasmic reticulum),
  and induces the ubiquitination and dimerization of STING. The activated STING recruits
  TBK1 and IRF3 and contributes to the phosphorylation of IRF3 mediated by TBK1. STING
  recruits TBK1 and IKKε and forms the TBK1-IKKε complex via the association with
  TRAF3. The TBK1 complex induces the phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation
  of IRF3. (B) When SARS-CoV invades the host, these processes are disrupted by SARS-CoV
  PLpro-TM. PLpro-TM disrupts activation of the IRF3 pathway induced by STING-TRAF3-TBK1
  by blocking the assembly of the complex, and it deubiquitinates the signaling molecules
  RIG-I, TRAF3, STING, TBK1, and IRF3
