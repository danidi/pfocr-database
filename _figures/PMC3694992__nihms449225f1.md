caption: 'TLRs signal as dimers and heterodimers that recruit adaptor proteins such
  as CD14 and MD2. Depending on the adaptors recruited by the activated TLR, different
  pathways can be triggered, all of which culminate in activation of the pro-inflammatory
  transcription factor NF-κB. One pathway involves MyD88 and TIRAP and results in
  activation of NF-κB via IκB kinase. Another pathway uses NADPH oxidase that can
  activate NF-κB through ROS. TRIF and TRAM signaling proteins also initiate signal
  cascades, culminating in the activation of NF-κB and other pro-inflammatory transcription
  factors. RAGE is another transmembrane receptor operating in innate immune cells
  that is known to respond to HMGB1, and this pathway also induces pro-inflammatory
  gene transcription via NF-κB activation. The release of cytokines such as TNF-α,
  HMGB1, IL-1β, chemokines, proteases, and ROS activate adjacent cells. These cytokines
  affect the brain and are thought to contribute to the etiology, progression, and
  persistence of alcohol addiction. “Off-the-shelf” FDA-approved drugs (shown here
  in boxes along with their site of action) are anti-inflammatory and interfere with
  the TLR4 signaling cascade. These examples are discussed in the text and represented
  here because they have been shown to decrease alcohol consumption and modify other
  alcohol behaviors. Bold red font indicates a gene that has been manipulated and
  shown to affect ethanol-related behavior.NF-κB: Nuclear factor κ light-chain-enhancer
