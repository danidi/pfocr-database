caption: 'Hydrogen enhances the expression of a wide variety of fatty acid metabolism-related
  genes. Differentially expressed genes identified in the KEGG pathway database related
  to the fatty acid metabolic pathway are shown. Genes for which the expression was
  significantly increased by H2-water in the pathway are indicated in yellow: (1)
  carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, liver (Cpt1a); (2) acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1,
  palmitoyl (Acox1); (3) acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase (Acaa1a, Acaa1b); (4) dodecenoyl-coenzyme
  A delta isomerase (3, 2-trans-enoyl-coenyme A isomerase) (Dci), peroxisomal delta3,
  delta2-enoyl-coenzyme A isomerase (Peci); (5) aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh1a1, Aldh3a2,
  Aldh1l1); (6) cytochrome P450, family 4, subfamily a, polypeptide (Cyp4a32, Cyp4a31,
  Cyp4a10).'
