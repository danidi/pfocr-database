caption: Red hollow blocks represent the enzymes, the black circles are the metabolites,
  and the blue number is the flux value of cluster center of each category. The width
  of the brown edges is proportional to the passed flux. The abbreviations of enzymes
  and metabolites are as shown in  and . The reactions in black color provide the
  initial carbon skeleton for a cyclization pathway. The reactions in red color are
  part carrying out oxidative decarboxylation and NADPH generation. The purple pathway
  is the gluconeogenesis pathway, and the yellow arrow represents the reaction not
  in the target cycle. In Fig 4a, the cluster is the ath cluster in , containing the
  PP-EMP cycle. In Fig 4b, the cluster is the eth cluster in , containing PP-ED-EMP
  cycle 1, PP-ED-EMP cycle 2 and ME-TCA cycle. In Fig 4c, the cluster is the jth cluster
  in , containing ME-PPC cycle. In Fig. 4d, the cluster is the jth cluster in , containing
  ME-GLX cycle.
