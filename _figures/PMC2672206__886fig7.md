caption: Model for regulation of osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells by substrate
  rigidity. In this model, changes in substrate compliance are transduced by integrins
  (such as α2β1, which binds to type I collagen) that cluster in plane of the plasma
  membrane, in turn stimulating downstream protein tyrosine kinases such as FAK to
  catalyze the activations of RhoA. On stiffer matrices, FAK activation is enhanced,
  leading to higher RhoA activity, thereby promoting increased cellular contractility
  through ROCK. Cross-talk between RhoA-ROCK and the ERK-MAPK pathway stimulates phosphorylation
  of ERK 1/2 (p44/42 MAPK) through MEK (MAPK kinase), which regulates the activity
  of the osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2 to control the expression of osteogenic
  genes (e.g., OCN and BSP) and ultimately drive differentiation toward a mature osteoblastic
  phenotype. On softer matrices in the presence of identical soluble cues, however,
  the diminished activity of FAK, RhoA, and ERK1/2 reduces the levels of RUNX2, inhibiting
  or at least delaying the subsequent steps of osteogenesis.
