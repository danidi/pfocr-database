caption: Summary of the speculative roles of UNC5C in AD pathogenesis. (A) Aberrant
  UNC5C would activate the expression of DAPK1 then activated DAPK1 would sequential
  activate its downstream of PKD, ASK1, JNK, NADPH oxidase, caspases and ultimately
  led to a common caspases-dependent neuronal apoptosis. DAPK1-induced Vps34 pathways
  also may be a possible pathway to trigger neuronal autophagy. In addition, activated
  DAPK1 could phosphorylate APP at Thr668, which would lead to neuronal death by Aβ-independent
  GO protein pathway. On the other hand, the UNC5C also may be possible to be related
  to NRAGE-associated pathway. The aberrant NRAGE may activate its downstream of JNK,
  which would ultimately lead to caspases-dependent neuronal death. What’s more, the
  NRAGE may also degrade the caspase inhibitor XIAP, which would trigger the increase
  of caspases and result in promoting to neuronal apoptosis; (B) Aβ is generated via
  cleaving fragment of APP via β-secretase and γ-secretase. Firstly, APP is cleaved
  by β-secretase at the corresponding site and then releases APPsβ ectodomain. Secondly,
  the remaining carboxy-terminal fragment is cleaved by γ-secretase and then Aβ is
  released; (C) aberrant UNC5C over activate DAPK1, overexpression of DAPK1 will lead
  to tau protein hyper phosphorylation and ultimately promote to the form of NFT.
