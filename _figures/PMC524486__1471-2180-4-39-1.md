caption: The formation of Met from KMTB. The pathway of polyamine synthesis and subsequent
  Met regeneration from MTA, as known from K. pneumoniae [11] and B. subtilis [12],
  is shown. Solid arrows represent steps that have been characterised in M. tuberculosis
  (present study and [21]). The conversion of KMTB to Met is shown at the top in bold.
  KIC = ketoisocaproate, KIV = ketoisovalerate, and KMV = ketomethylvalerate.
