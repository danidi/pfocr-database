caption: 'Structure of cisplatin and nephrotoxic haloalkenes and proposed metabolism
  of cisplatin to a nephrotoxin. A, the structure of cisplatin and two nephrotoxic
  haloalkenes: trichloroethene and hexachloro-1,3-butadiene. B, the proposed pathway
  for the metabolism of cisplatin to a nephrotoxin. The pathway is based on the metabolic
  pathway through which the haloalkenes are activated to nephrotoxins. The first step
  is the conjugation to glutathione, followed by the cleavage by GGT to a cysteinyl-glycine
  conjugate, the cleavage by aminopeptidase to a cysteine S-conjugate, and the β-elimination
  by cysteine S-conjugate β-lyase to an unstable thiol that yields a highly reactive
  electrophile.'
