caption: Proposed mechanisms of PRRSV-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in MARC-145 cells.
  One the one hand, PRRSV infection activates Chk1, leading to cytoplasmic accumulation
  of Cdc25C and increasing of Cdc25C phosphorylation(Ser216) which is an inhibitory
  site of Cdc25C, therefore results in inhibition of Cdc25C activity. Inactivated
  Cdc25C and increased Wee1 and Myt1 expression promote downstream Cdc2 inhibitory
  phosphorylation(Tyr15) in the nucleus and consequently reduces the activity Cdc2-cyclinB1
  complex. On the other hand, PRRSV infection activates p53/p21 signaling pathway
  which also inhibits the activity of Cdc2-cyclinB1 complex. The activity inhibition
  of Cdc2-cyclinB1 complex leads to G2/M cell cycle arrest in MARC-145 cells
