caption: Schematic representation of ErbB-2 signaling and androgen sensitivity regulated
  by cPAcP in prostate cancer cells. The solid red arrow indicates the classical ligand
  dependent activation of androgen receptor (AR) pathway. Unbound AR resides in the
  cytosol in association with heat shock proteins (hsps). Androgen (DHT) enters into
  the cytoplasm and binds to the AR by displacing associated hsps, which allows the
  AR to enter into the nucleus, where it dimerizes, recruits various co-regulatory
  proteins and binds to the androgen response element (ARE), leading to the transcriptional
  regulation of the target gene. Solid black arrows indicate one of the major cPAcP-regulated
  pathways in prostate cancer cells with clinical significance. Progression of androgen-sensitive
  PCa cells towards androgen independence is accompanied by an early decrease/loss
  of cPAcP expression in PCa cells, results in hyperphosphorylation of HER-2 at tyrosine
  residues (1221/2 and/or 1248), leading to androgen-independent cell proliferation.
  Activated HER-2 can transduce its signals via p52Shc (blocked by dominant-negative
  (DN) HER-2 cDNA transfection or an HER-2 inhibitor, AG879) to activate the downstream
  ERK/MAPK pathway (blocked by p52Shc Y317F mutant cDNA transfection or an MEK inhibitor,
  PD 98059 and U0126) through Ras/Raf mediation. These events could also lead to AR
  phosphorylation and activation, resulting in an increase in androgen-independent
  cell proliferation. Activated HER-2, via Akt, may also phosphorylate AR. Alternatively,
  the loss of cPAcP expression results in the accumulation of PI3P, which may lead
  to activation of the Akt pathway.
