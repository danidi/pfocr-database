caption: Model for the pathway of a-factor biogenesis. The a-factor biosynthetic intermediates
  and the components of the a-factor biogenesis machinery are shown (see the text
  for more information). Several of the a-factor intermediates can be directly visualized
  by SDS-PAGE and are designated P0, P1, P2, and M (). The a-factor precursor contains
  an NH2-terminal extension, a mature portion, and a COOH-terminal CAAX motif, as
  indicated at top. During a-factor biogenesis, the unmodified a-factor precursor
  (P0) undergoes COOH-terminal modification (prenylation, proteolytic cleavage of
  AAX, and carboxylmethylation) to yield the fully COOH-terminally modified species
  P1. Next, NH2-terminal proteolytic processing occurs in two distinct steps, the
  first (P1→ P2) cleavage removing seven residues from the NH2-terminal extension
  to yield the P2 species, and the second (P2→ M) cleavage generating mature a-factor,
  which is exported from the cell. Question marks indicate that the corresponding
  component has not yet been genetically identified.
