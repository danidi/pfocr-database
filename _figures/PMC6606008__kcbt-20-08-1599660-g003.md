caption: Wnt signaling pathway with and without ligand binding and APC mutations.
  β-catenin is a protein kept under low cytoplasmic concentration by the destruction
  complex mainly regulating the Wnt pathway. The destruction complex consists of the
  tumor suppressor protein adenomatous polyposis coli (APC); casein kinase 1 (CK1)
  and glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3-b); and Axin2, which scaffold the complex
  together. The membrane receptor complex is formed by frizzled (Fzd) and low-density
  lipoprotein receptor–related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6). In the absence of Wnt ligands,
  this membrane receptor complex is not engaged. Thereafter, CK1 and GSK3-b phosphorylate
  β-catenin at specific serine and threonine residues and leads to priming of its
  recognition by the U3 ubiquitin ligase β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TRCP).
  As a consequence, β-catenin is ubiquitinated and targeted for proteosomal degradation.
  Gene transcription is actively repressed in the nucleus as TCF transcription factors
  are bound to corepressor (Groucho). In the presence of Wnt ligands, they bind to
  Fzd and LRP5/6 coreceptors and trigger the formation of Dvl-Fzd complex. Also, it
  leads to phosphorylation of LRP by GSK3-b. The destruction complex is dissolved
  as this phosphorylation recruits the scaffolding protein Axin2 to the coreceptors.
  As a result, β-catenin stabilization occurs and can therefore accumulate in the
  cytosol. Subsequently, β-catenin translocates in the nucleus where it converts TCF
  into a transcriptional activator. This step is mediated by the displacement of the
  Groucho protein and recruitment of coactivators that include CBP, BCL9, and PYG.
  This recruitment ensures efficient transcription of genes that are important regulators
  of stem cell fate (LGR5, ASCL2), cell proliferation (C-MYC), and also, negative
  regulators of the pathway (Axin2). In CRC, truncating mutations in APC are frequently
  observed. In such mutations, there is inefficient targeting of β-catenin for degradation
  as the destruction complex is not properly formed. Therefore, even in the absence
  of external signal, β-catenin can accumulate and form active transcription factor
  complexes with TCF proteins in the nucleus.
