caption: The classical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways. The classical pathway (left)
  is activated by many stimuli including the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF,
  antigen receptor (TCR, BCR) ligation and signaling from the TLRs. This pathway requires
  NEMO, and for most stimuli IKKβ is the critical kinase that phosphorylates the IκB
  proteins, leading to their ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation. The free
  classical NF-κB complexes (typified by p50 :p65) then migrate to the nucleus to
  regulate the expression of genes involved in responses including immunity, inflammation
  and cell survival. The non-canonical pathway (right) is activated by a subset of
  signals including ligation of LTβR, CD40 and BAFF-R, and requires NIK-dependent
  IKKα activation. It has not yet been formally established whether the IKKα that
  functions in the non-canonical pathway exists in a separate complex containing only
  IKKα (as depicted here and in most models), or if it is the IKKα within the IKKα-IKKβ-NEMO
  holocomplex that is the effector kinase of non-canonical signaling. Activated IKKα
  phosphorylates the COOH-terminus of p100 complexed with RelB leading to its processing
  to p52 to generate p52:RelB complexes. This pathway regulates the expression of
  chemokine and cytokine genes involved in lymphoid organogenesis and B cell maturation.
  The molecular interactions and the many signaling events that occur up- and downstream
  of classical and non-canonical NF-κB activation are discussed in detail in several
  recent reviews [,  – ]. In addition, the website maintained by Dr. Thomas Gilmore’s
  group (www.nf-kb.org) is an excellent resource for all aspects of NF-κB biology.
