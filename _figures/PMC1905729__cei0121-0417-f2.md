caption: A schematic representation of the IFN-γ receptor-mediated intracellular signalling
  pathways (modified from [,]). Two IFN-γR1 chains dimerize on binding the IFN-γ homodimer
  and subsequently associate with two IFN-γR2 chains. Receptor subunit assembly leads
  to the trans-phosphorylation and activation of Jak1 and Jak2 kinases, which associate
  with the IFN-γR1 and IFN-γR2 chains, respectively. These phosphorylate a tyrosine
  residue on the intracytoplasmic domain of IFN-γR1, forming a paired set of docking
  sites for STAT1. Two STAT1 molecules then bind to these docking sites and subsequently
  become phosphorylated. Tyrosine phosphorylated STAT1 molecules then lose their affinity
  for IFN-γR1 chain docking sites, dissociate from the receptor and form homodimeric
  complexes. Phosphorylated STAT1 homodimers translocate to the nucleus and bind to
  specific sequences in the promoter region of early IFN-γ inducible genes, switching
  on gene transcription. Reprinted, with permission, from the Annual Review of Immunology,
