  Blue boxes indicate enzymes and transporters that may be useful therapeutic targets
  in cancer. Green boxes represent transcription factors that alter metabolic pathways.
  Glycolysis is the ten-step metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate.
  The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy compounds
  ATP and NADH. The pentose phosphate pathway is a process that generates NADPH and
  5-carbon sugars as alternative to glycolysis. Nucleotide synthesis provides molecules
  that make up the individual structural units of the nucleic acids RNA and DNA. In
  addition, nucleotides participate in cell signaling (cGMP and cAMP), are cofactors
  of enzymatic reactions, and nucleoside triphosphates are sources of chemical energy.
  Fatty acid synthesis is the synthesis of fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA
  precursors via fatty acid synthases. Anaplerotic reactions are those that replenish
  and maintain intermediates of a metabolic pathway. The abbreviations are: CAIX,
  Carbonic anhydrase IX; NHE1, Na+/H+ exchanger; Glut1, glucose transporter 1; Glut3,
