caption: The Wnt signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of Wnt ligands and R-spondins,
  β-catenin is kept under low cytosolic levels by the destruction complex. This complex
  contains Axin2, Adenomatousis Polyposis Coli (APC), and the kinases Casein kinase
  1 (CK1) and GSK3-β, which altogether primes β-catenin for proteasomal degradation;
  (B) R-spondins bind to Lgrs and RNF43, which results in the stabilization of Fzd
  receptors. Wnt ligands bound to Fzd and LRP5/6 co-receptors trigger formation of
  Dvl-Fzd complex and subsequent destabilization of the destruction complex. β-catenin
  is therefore stabilized, can accumulate in the cytosol, and subsequently translocates
  in the nucleus where it converts T cell-factor (TCF) into a transcriptional activator.
  In intestinal stem cells, this nuclear β-catenin bound to TCF enables the efficient
  transcription of genes that are important regulators of stem cell fate (e.g., Leucine-Rich
  Repeat Containing G Protein-Coupled Receptor 5 (LGR5), Achaete-scute complex homolog
  2 (ASCL2)); (C) Truncating mutations in APC are frequently observed in colorectal
  cancer (CRC). As a result, the destruction complex cannot properly form, which results
  in inefficient targeting of β-catenin for degradation. Therefore, β-catenin can
  accumulate and form active transcription factor complexes with TCF proteins in the
  nucleus, even in the absence of external signals. Additional reported mutations
  of various pathway components lead to constitutive activation of the pathway (mutations
  and truncations are depicted by a * or orange lining).
