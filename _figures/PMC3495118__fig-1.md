caption: Transcriptional regulation of the cytoprotective phase 2 genes under control
  of the transcriptional factor nuclear factor-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Inducers
  such as sulforaphane (SF) modify specific reactive cysteine residues of the repressor
  of the Nrf2 transcription factor Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1).– Keap1
  functions to sequester Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and to target Nrf2 for degradation
  via the 26S proteasome by association with the ubiquitin ligase Cullin 3-based E3
  ligase (Cul3). Once Keap1 is modified by SF, Nrf2 is able to bypass the proteasomal
  degradation pathway and translocate to the nucleus, where it binds in conjunction
  with small Maf (sMaf) proteins to the antioxidant response elements (ARE) in the
  upstream regulatory regions of cytoprotective gene promoters. These genes encode
  proteins and enzymes that protect against oxidants, electrophiles, and radiation.
  The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) proinflammatory pathway can also be disrupted by SF
  through inhibition of IκB phosphorylation, thus blocking NF-κB translocation to
  the nucleus,, or by directly interacting with cysteine residues in the DNA-binding
  region of the NF-κB transcription factor.
