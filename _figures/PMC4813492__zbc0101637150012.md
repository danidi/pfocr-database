caption: Summary of the effects of light on retinal metabolism. A, in darkness 3′:5′
  cGMP is not rapidly hydrolyzed to 5′-GMP. Low 5′-GMP activities allow maximal activity
  of enzymes in the purine synthesis pathway. It also is possible that darkness favors
  breakdown of mRNA, which would also increase the concentrations of pyrimidines and
  purines (not shown). B, light stimulates hydrolysis of cGMP to 5′-GMP, which then
  inhibits multiple steps in purine synthesis to cause accumulation of ribose 5-phosphate
  (R5P) and depletion of downstream purines. Some of the increase in ribose 5-P may
  also reflect stimulation of pentose phosphate pathway activity. C, cytosolic [Ca2+]f
  is greater in the dark than in light. Ca2+ stimulates AGC1 to exchange aspartate
  out of mitochondria. Ca2+ also enters mitochondria where it lowers the Km of dehydrogenases
  to stimulate flux through the TCA cycle. D, light lowers [Ca2+]f. Both AGC1 and
  matrix dehydrogenase activities decrease. Pyr, pyruvate; Cit, citrate; PRPP, phosphoribosyl
  pyrophosphate; 5PRA, phosphoribosyl amine.
