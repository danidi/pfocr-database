caption: 'Schematic representation of cuticular wax biosynthesis and export. Cuticle
  biosynthesis pathway, which are composed of three stages: In the first stage, C16
  and C18 fatty acids are generated by de novo synthesis. The second stage involves
  the elongation of C16 and C18 fatty acids into VLCFAs composed of C20 to C36. In
  the third stage, VLCFAs are modified into the major wax products according to two
  distinct biosynthetic pathways: the alcohol-forming pathway and the alkane-forming
  pathway. Wax products are mobilized from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the
  plasma membrane (PM) to the outside of the cell wall (CW) by ABC transporters and
  lipid transfer proteins (LTPs). Genes in red displayed significant variation of
  expression. Genes in blue were only detected in CK samples, and gene in black was
  not detected in both samples'
