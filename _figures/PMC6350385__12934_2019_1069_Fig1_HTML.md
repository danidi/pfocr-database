caption: 'Sensor-based pathway optimization for improving salicylate production. a
  Synthetic pathway for producing salicylate from glycerol. Six genes highlighted
  in blue encode the key enzymes involved in salicylate biosynthesis: ppsA encodes
  PEP synthetase, which converts pyruvate to PEP. tktA encodes a transketolase that
  increases supply of E4P. DAHP synthase encoded by aroGfbr catalyzes the aldol condensation
  to generate DAHP. Shikimate kinase encoded by aroL produces chorismate. Isochorismate
  synthase (encoded by entC) and isochorismate pyruvate lyase (encoded by pchB) enable
  the synthesis of salicylate form chorismate. b AraC-based salicylate biosensor was
  used to screen for clones showing enhanced salicylate production'
