caption: Proposed role of TgACS and acetyl-CoA in the lipid biosynthetic pathway of
  T. gondii tachyzoite. Acetyl-CoA can be generated by the cytosolic ACS using acetate
  as a substrate. This pool of acetyl-CoA is used as a substrate for the parasite
  elongases (ELO1, 2, 3) in the ER to form C18:0, C18:1, C20:0, C20:1, C22:0, and
  C24:0. These elongated FAs are used to generate phospholipids for the bulk lipid
  biosynthetic pathways along with the FASII-derived FA and lipid precursor (LPA)
  made in the apicoplast and the FAs and lipids scavenged from the host. The origin
  of acetate used by ACS partially derives from metabolized glucose, while another
  fraction is likely scavenged from the host environment. Acetyl-CoA can also be generated
  via cytosolic ACL, which uses citrate made by the mitochondrial TCA cycle, and that
  is exported into the cytosol. This pool of acetyl-CoA can most likely be used by
  the elongation pathway as a possible redundant route to ACS function in elongation.
  FAs generated by the apicoplast FASII are the major substrates for the ER elongases.
  Acetyl-CoA is also made from glycolitic intermediates phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP)
  and pyruvate by the apicoplast PDH and the mitochondrial BCKDH for the FASII pathway
  and the mitochondrial TCA cycle, respectively. Theoretically, acetyl-CoA generated
  by ACS and ACL could fuel the cytosolic FASI pathway but our current results suggest
  that this is not the case during tachyzoite life stages. APT, apicoplast phosphate
