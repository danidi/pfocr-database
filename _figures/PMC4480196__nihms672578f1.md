caption: Schematic diagram of mTOR-mediated T cell activation and lineage specification.
  mTOR is a sensor of metabolic stress and integrator of environmental cues. Activation
  of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is triggered by oxidative stress, sufficiency of amino
  acids, and growth factors, which, in turn, promote proinflammatory skewing of T
  cell development. Mitochondrial oxidative stress and activation of mTORC1 inhibit
  the expression of FoxP3 and contract Treg cells., Downstream of mTORC1,, HIF1α-dependent
  activation of glycolytic enzymes drives the proinflammatory metabolic changes, stimulating
  the expression of RORγt and the expansion of TH17 cells.,, This is consistent on
  the reliance of TH17 and Treg cells on glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism,
  respectively.
