caption: A) Gold standard validation. In the drug repurposing network, we could confirm
  Etanercept as standard treatment for Rheumatoid arthritis. B) Drug repurposing.
  Our approach was able to predict Verapamil as a new potential treatment for gout,
  for which a retrospective study reports lower incidence of gout.
