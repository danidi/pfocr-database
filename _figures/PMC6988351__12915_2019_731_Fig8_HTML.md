caption: The inflammasome pathway. Pathogen-associated patterns are recognized by
  pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors at the cell surface (TLRs),
  or NACHT domain and Leucine-rich Repeat containing receptor (NLRs) in the cytoplasm.
  This interaction triggers the transcription of cytokine precursors via NFkB, and
  the activation and assembly of inflammasome components (NLRs, Pro-Caspase-1, and
  ASC). Inflammasome-activated Caspase 1 then initiates the maturation of cytokines
  and an acute phase inflammatory response (CRP, APCS proteins), and/or pyroptosis
  through gasdermin. Several components of the pathway are expanded in the round goby
  (gene numbers in round goby, or novel groups for NLRs, are indicated in orange)
