caption: Here, we summarize key signaling mediators and receptors in common and distinct
  pathways. (A) IL-4-stimulated Stat6 activation is mediated by Jak1, which is required
  for M2-like polarization. (B) IL-6-treated macrophage polarization is induced by
  the activation of Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathway. (C) Jak2 and Tyk2 are required for
  Stat3 activation in IL-10-dependent M2-like polarization. (D) Jak2 controls Stat4
  activation in IL-12-treated monocytes, which could induce M1-like polarization.
  (E) Jak2 and Tyk2 are the upstream regulators of Stat3 and Stat6 activation in IL-13-stimulated
  monocytes, which eventually induce the M2-like polarization.
