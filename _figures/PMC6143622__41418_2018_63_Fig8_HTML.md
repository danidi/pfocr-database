caption: A model of mamiRs and JNK/MAPK signaling forming a double-negative feedback
  regulatory network in skeletal muscle development. a In undifferentiated myoblasts,
  when JNK/MAPK signaling is activated, it phosphorylates its downstream effector
  c-Jun. P-c-Jun enters into the nucleus, and together with Fos or ATF family proteins
  forms a demeric compound that called AP-1 that can could inhibit MyoD transcription,
  therefore, blocking differentiation. b In differentiated muscle, the activity of
  JNK/MAPK signaling is attenuated because its key factors are targeted by mamiRs
  (miR-1a-3p, 133a-3p, 133b-3p, 206-3p, 128-3p, and 351-5p), c-Jun is rarely phosphorylated,
  so forms less AP-1 compound in nucleus and turns on MyoD transcription, activating
  the transcription of mamiR genes. In turn, mature mamiRs further repress the JNK/MAPK
  signaling, forming a double-negative feedback regulatory network in skeletal muscle
  development
