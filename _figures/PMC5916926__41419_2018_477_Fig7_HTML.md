caption: Activation of hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells often followed the
  HBV/HCV infection or other hepatic inflammatory diseases and was characterized by
  the overwhelming release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, and
  IL into in peripheral circulating blood. IFN-γ was the sharpest upward one. Primary
  colorectal cancer cells firstly required EMT to gain mesenchymal phenotype for the
  invasive ability and prompt intravasion. The IRF-1 product of those circulating
  colorectal cancer cells was upregulated by the stimulation of IFN-γ and then dramatically
  depleted the expression of the let-7a cluster. The suppression of the let-7a cluster
  caused significantly overexpression of N-cadherin which was associated with acquiring
  the mesenchymal phenotype. As we all know, MET, a reverse process of EMT, is necessary
  for facilitating the extravasation and subsequent settlement of circulating colorectal
  cancer cells at secondary locations. So it is not difficult to understand that maintaining
  the mesenchymal phenotype of circulating CRC cells might result in low incidence
  of CRLM
