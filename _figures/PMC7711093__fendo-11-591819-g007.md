caption: Biosynthetic pathways of oxidized phospholipids. (1) The classical pathway
  involves the action of PLA2 on membrane phospholipids, releasing sn-2 PUFA which
  are oxygenated by cyclooxygenases (COXs), lipoxygenases (LOXs), and cytochrome P450s
  (CYPs) then re-esterified. *Oxygenated PUFA can be also be esterified with plasmalogen
  lysophospholipids (2) Direct oxygenation of membrane phospholipids by 15-LOXs. (3)
  15-LOX-mediated oxygenation of PUFA in cholesteryl esters followed by hydrolysis
  of oxygenated PUFA provides substrates for the classical pathway. (4) An alternative
  pathway involves the action of PLA1, forming 2-PUFA-lysophospholipids which are
  oxygenated by COX-2, 12S-LOX, and 15-LOXs then re-esterified with FA. (5) Cytochrome
  c releases 2-PUFA-lysophospholipids by cleaving the vinyl ether bond in plasmalogen
  phospholipids, providing substrates for the alternative pathway. PLA, Phospholipase
  A; oxPUFA, oxygenated PUFA; ACS, acyl-CoA synthase; CE, cholesteryl ester; CEH,
  neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase; FA, fatty acid/acyl; lysoPL, lysophospholipid.
