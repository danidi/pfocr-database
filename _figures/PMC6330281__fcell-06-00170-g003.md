caption: Role of Wnt signaling in osteoblasts. (A) Upon binding to its receptor (Frizzled)
  and co-receptors (LRP5 and LRP6), Wnt activates their signaling pathway, leading
  to gene expression (and ultimately protein synthesis and the formation of bone).
  (B) Wnt antagonists sclerostin and Dkk-1 bind LRP5 and LRP6, preventing their interaction
  with Frizzled and resulting in inhibition of gene expression. (C) Loss-of-function
  mutation in a gene that encodes for a Wnt antagonist orpharmacological engagement
  of the antagonist with an inhibitory molecule such as an antibody can lead to inhibition
  of Wnt antagonism and promote gene expression.
