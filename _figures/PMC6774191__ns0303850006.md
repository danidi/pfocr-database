caption: ERKI/II (MAPK) can serve as a convergence site for multiple extracellular
  signals known to induce plasticity in mature neurons. The best documented activation
  of the MAPK cascade occurs via ligand binding to RTK. Mature neurons express high
  levels of different RTKs, demonstrated in this work by the insulin receptor (Fig.A).
  Activation of RTK recruits the Shc–Grb2–SOS1 complex, which in turn activates Ras.
  Ras induces MAPK activation via an evolutionarily conserved pathway, which includes
  Raf, MEK (MAPKK), and ERKI/II (MAPK) (all included here within MAPK cascade). ERKI/II
  is known to have both cytoplasmic (e.g., glycogene synthase kinase) and nuclear
  (e.g., Elk-1) targets and can translocate to the nucleus to modulate transcription
  in neurons. The block of LTP induction by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig.A) suggests
  that MAPK plays a role in the early phase of LTP, which is dependent on modulation
  of membranal or cytosolic proteins. Another documented pathway by which MAPK is
  activated in neurons is via glutamate receptors, represented here by the NMDA receptor,
  activation of which lead to increased levels of intracellular Ca2+ (Fig. ). Increased
  intracellular Ca2+ may modulate the MAPK cascade via activation of a Ca2+-dependent
  tyrosine kinase (PYK2) or calmodulin (CaM). The main pathway studied here is one
  mediated by mAChRs. Different mAChR subtypes can activate different signaling cascades,
  which depends on the dissociated α and βγ subunits. All four (M1–M4) mAChRs can
  induce MAPK activation when expressed in the COS-7 cell line (Fig. ). The signal
  transduction in neurons shows Src-dependence and PKC-independence, whereas both
  PI3K and Ca2+ can modulate mAChR-mediated MAPK activation (Fig. ). In neurons, the
  major pathway by which mAChRs induce MAPK activation is via βγ, using a Src- and
  PI3K-dependent mechanism. Cross-talk between the different signal transduction cascades
  may occur at multiple levels. The prolonged duration of MAPK activation suggests
  that convergence from different extracellular stimulus may take place in a time
  domain of minutes to hours.
