caption: Complement pathway altered in disease. Expression of components of the complement
  pathway in nephritis compared with asymptomatic tissue. Green colour indicated increased
  expression and red colour indicates a decreased expression in nephritis tissue.
  Grey colour indicates that the fold change and FDR p < 0.05 or the sigPathway FDR
  p < 0.05 filters were not met. The names of the genes are in "nodes". The shape
  of the nodes is related to gene function/family membership. The lines between the
  nodes represent the connectivity between genes. Solid lines indicate direct protein-protein
  interactions. Dotted lines represent indirect interactions.
