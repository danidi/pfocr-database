caption: 'Schematic representation of the functions of GAS5, DSCAM-AS1, and Eleanors
  in the tamoxifen resistance of breast cancer. GAS5 sponges miR-222 and upregulates
  PTEN expression to enhance tamoxifen resistance. DSCAM-AS1 also sponges miR-137
  to increase EPS8, which contributes to tamoxifen resistance. On the other hand,
  Eleanors promotes tamoxifen resistance by upregulating ESR1 expression. GAS5: growth-arrest
  specific 5; DSCAM-AS1: Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule antisense RNA 1; Eleanors:
  ESR1 locus enhancing and activating noncoding RNAs; PTEN: phosphatase and tensin
  homolog; EPS8: epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8.'
