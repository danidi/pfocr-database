number: Figure 4
caption: Promoter hypomethylation of genes involved in myogenesis, structural dynamics
  of muscles and CDC42 signaling. Shown in black are gene products with significant
  and >30% hypomethylated promoters in the physically active men compared with inactive
  men. A grey box indicates the pathway position of CDC42. Pathway steps are indicated
  with black arrows. Pathway end products and inducers are show in red text. The model
  is based on map 04810, http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html.
