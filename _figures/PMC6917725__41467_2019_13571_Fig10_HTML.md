caption: Shown is a diagrammatic representation of postulated mechanisms that may
  be underlying the observed estrogen-mediated regulation of an immunosuppressive
  TIME in the liver. The ER/E2 signaling pathway can promote metastatic expansion
  in the liver by inducing TNFR2 transcription. In turn, TNFR2 may rescue immune cells
  from TNFR1-mediated death signals triggered by the TNF-α-rich microenvironment of
  LM and/or initiate signal transduction, leading to transcriptional activation of
  immunosuppressive gene products. This favors MDSC survival and suppressive activity,
  and reduces CD8+T-cell-mediated antitumor responses. ER signaling (possibly in conjunction
  with, or independently of TNFR2) also regulates transcription of immunosuppressive
  proteins in the liver to enhance immune evasion. Tamoxifen treatment blocks the
  ER/E2 axis and reduces immune tolerance to improve tumor cell clearance (dashed
  lines indicate postulated molecular pathways).
