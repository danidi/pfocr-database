caption: DEGs in RPE cells of the circadian rhythm pathway. Genes that are differentially
  expressed over time are indicated by various colors, with an intensity scale of
  the standardized expression values ranging from low expression (dark blue) to high
  expression (dark red). ZT points are ranked from left to right for each differentially
  expressed gene, the most left color corresponding to ZT0 and the most right color
  corresponding to ZT19.
