caption: 'Schematic overview of hepatic lipid biosynthetic pathways. There are multiple
  inter-related pathways for the formation of the major liver phospholipids. The diet
  is a principal source for Cho and Etn, as well as the fatty acids that are assembled
  into DAG. Fatty acids may also be derived from de novo fatty acid biosynthesis or
  transported to the liver from adipose tissue. The major route to PtdCho is the CDP-Cho
  pathway: Cho kinase (ChoK), CCT, and Cho phosphotransferase (CPT). A major route
  to PtdEtn is the CDP-Etn pathway: Etn kinase (EtnK), ECT, and Etn phosphotransferase
  (EPT). Also, PtdCho is converted to PtdEtn by base-exchange with serine to form
  PtdSer, followed by its conversion to PtdEtn by decarboxylation (PSD) or potentially
  by another base-exchange enzyme (PSS2) that exchanges Etn for serine. PtdCho is
  produced from PtdEtn through sequential methylation by PEMT. TG is formed by DAG
  acyltransferases (DGAT) from the DAG that is not devoted to the synthesis of phospholipids.'
