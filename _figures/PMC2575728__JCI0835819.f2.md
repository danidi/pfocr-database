caption: The TCR activates cytoplasmic kinases (including Lck, ZAP-70, and PLCγ),
  which signal via intermediates to induce the activation of members of three distinct
  families of transcription factors, Rel, activator protein–1 (AP1), and nuclear factor
  of activated T cells (NFAT). These transcription factors then coordinate the expression
  of the genes encoding IL-2 and the subunits of IL-2R, thereby rendering the cell
  competent to progress through the cell cycle. Heteromeric cytokine receptors, here
  represented by IL-2R, are composed of two or three distinct transmembrane chains.
  Binding of the cytokine to the external receptor chain domains brings the cytoplasmic
  domains into close enough proximity for their respective receptor-associated JAK
  molecules to initiate signaling. Subsequently, the activated STAT dimers translocate
  to the nucleus and initiate transcription of genes encoding proteins such as cyclin
  D2 (Cyc D) to promote progression beyond the R-point and also genes encoding cell-survival
  proteins, such as Bcl-XL. By comparison, homomeric receptors already have the same
  bound JAK molecules in close proximity, and ligand binding readily initiates signaling
  by promoting transphosphorylation of JAK2, the receptor chains, and eventually STAT5.
  G-CSFR, G-CSF receptor; EpoR, erythropoietin receptor; TpoR, thrombopoietin receptor.
