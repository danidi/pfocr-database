caption: 'EGF decreases free fatty acid (FFA) biosynthesis transcripts. A: FFA synthesis
  and elongation. This pathway is an abbreviated form of the KEGG pathway for FFA
  synthesis combined with 1 cycle through the 4 enzymes that catalyze the 4 consecutive
  reactions of fatty acid elongation (). The pathway was drawn using ChemBioDraw Ultra
  12.0 (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA). Initial fatty acid synthesis, catalyzed by
  FASN occurs in the cytosol; elongation occurs in the ER. The initial step of elongation
  is catalyzed by the ELOVL family of enzymes and is also the rate-limiting step ().
  The majority of the fatty acids present in the epidermal barrier are elongated by
  ELOVL3 and 6. ELOVL1 and ELOVL4 catalyze the elongation of the very long chain fatty
  acid present in the ceramides of the epidermal barrier (). Additionally, FA2H (not
  shown in this figure) hydroxylates FFA to form 2-OH FFA. These 2-OH FFA are part
  of the pool of FFA that are acylated to sphingoid bases to form ceramides as discussed
  in . Ceramides containing 2-OH FFA include Cer7(AH), Cer6(AP), and Cer5(AS) and
  are critical for proper formation of the epidermal barrier (). KS, keto acylsynthase,
  and ACP, acyl carrier protein, are domains of fatty acid synthase. EGF relative
