caption: Expression of suicide genes in T lymphocytes. The figure illustrates the
  two suicide systems that have been tested in clinical trials. (A) HSV-tk is an enzyme
  that phosphorylates specific nucleoside analogs (gancyclovir) to nucleoside monophosphate.
  A second cellular kinase phosphorylates this product into nucleoside triphosphate,
  a molecule that inhibits DNA synthesis and therefore leads to death of dividing
  cells. (B) Caspase-9 is a key player in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. This
  molecule dimerizes upon binding with apaf1 and leads to cleavage of the effector
  caspases 3, 6 and 7. (C) The inducible caspase-9 (iC9) is a fusion protein in which
  the native CARD domain has been replaced by an FKBP12 domain that dimerizes in the
  presence of a specific chemical inducer of dimerization (CID).
