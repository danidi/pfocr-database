  expressed genes.(a), (b) Hormone related Gene Ontology (GO) terms for (a) differentially
  expressed genes after 2 h induction (T0–2) and (b) differentially expressed genes
  after 8 h induction (T2–8). The colour bar in (a) and (b) indicates significance
  levels for the GO categories (FDR < 0.05), The circle size represents the number
  of genes present for a particular GO term. In the case of, for example, response
  to ethylene biosynthesis, the size corresponds to 12 and 17 genes, respectively.(c)
  Differentially expressed genes in the ethylene biosynthesis and signalling pathway
  in either the first time point (T0–2) or the second (T2–8); lines indicate that,
  for example, ACS2 is a 1‐amino‐cyclopropane‐1‐carboxylate (ACC) synthase and link
  the different gene classes to individual genes in that class showing differential
  expression. SAM, S′‐adenosyl‐l‐methionine; MET, methionine.
