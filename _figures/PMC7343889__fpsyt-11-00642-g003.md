caption: The modulatory effect of Cannabis on signaling pathways mediated by gp130.
  Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a central player in both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
  immune responses. It can modulate cellular responses in two ways. In classical signaling,
  it binds to its cell membrane-bound receptor (IL-6R) and triggers a heterodimeric
  association with two membrane-bound gp130 molecules. This signaling complex initiates
  downstream pro- and anti-inflammatory responses through the activation of three
  signaling cascades, most prominently the JAK-STAT pathway. In trans-signaling, IL-6
  binds to the soluble form of its receptor (sIL-6R) before it forms a complex with
  membrane-bound gp130. This complex then activates downstream pathways leading to
  pro-inflammatory responses. Soluble gp130 (sgp130) has an inhibitory effect on trans-signaling
  by blocking the association of the IL-6/sIL-6R complex with membrane-bound gp130
  molecules. Cannabis use, which was found to increase the levels of sgp130 in schizophrenia
  patients, is thus believed to have a suppressing effect on inflammation by inhibiting
  the initiation of trans-signaling cascades.
