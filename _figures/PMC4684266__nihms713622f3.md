caption: The mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway. Sulfide quinone oxidoreductase
  (SQR) constitutes the first enzyme in this pathway and oxidizes H2S, generating
  a protein-bound persulfide. Two routes for the transfer of the persulfide to sulfite
  ( path 1) or to an alternative acceptor (Ac in path 2) are shown. In path 1, the
  thiosulfate formed in the SQR-catalyzed reaction has to be converted to glutathione
  disulfide (GSSH) for further oxidation by ethylmalonic encephalopathy 1 (ETHE1).
  In path 2, if glutathione (GSH) is the acceptor, then the resulting GSSH product
  can directly serve as the substrate for ETHE1. However, if some other molecule serves
  as the proximal persulfide acceptor from SQR, then a sulfurtransferase (ST) such
  as rhodanese (Rhd) would likely be necessary to transfer the persulfide group to
  GSH for further oxidation. CSA and SO denote cysteine sulfinic acid and sulfite
  oxidase, respectively.
