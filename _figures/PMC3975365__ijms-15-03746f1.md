caption: 'Apoptosis induction and signaling. Apoptosis can be initiated via three
  distinct routes: (A) Extrinsic pathway: Ligands bind to death receptors leading
  to formation of the DISC complex and activation of caspase 8 (depicted as scissors).
  Caspase 8 either directly activates, via cleavage, caspases 3 and 7, or needs to
  enhance the “death signal” via Bid cleavage which thus initiates a mitochondrial
  feedback loop. Whether cells depend on this mitochondrial enhancement is traditionally
  determined experimentally and dying cells are either referred to as type I (no mitochondrial
  amplification necessary) or type II (mitochondrial amplification necessary) cells;
  (B) Intrinsic pathway: Chemotherapy and radiation, among others, cause DNA damage
  either directly or by producing oxygen radicals (ROS), which can either further
  impair the nuclear DNA integrity or compromise the mitochondria. This leads to the
  activation of mitochondrial death signaling, via the release of cytochrome c and
  other factors into the cytosol. Here, cytochrome c combines with caspase 9, Apaf-1
  and ATP to form the Apoptosome which activates caspases 3 and 7. Of note, there
  is also a caspase-independent form of apoptosis (B′), whereby AIF, which can also
  function as a ROS scavenger, gets released from the mitochondria and triggers chromatin
  condensation and DNA fragmentation; (C) CTL (Cytotoxic T lymphocytes), or NK (natural
  killer) cell-mediated apoptosis: A specialized form of apoptosis whereby the immune
  system triggers apoptosis by inserting a perforin “tunnel” in its target cell. This
  leads to granzymes entering the cell and activating caspase 3 and 7. All forms of
  caspase-dependent apoptosis converge at the level of caspase 3 and 7, the executioner
  caspases, which then proceed to cause the structural alterations to the cell, either
  directly or via activation of CAD DNase. Typical cellular responses to apoptosis
  are depicted in red, while in yellow effects of pathway activation are shown, which
  are undesirable during cancer therapy.'
