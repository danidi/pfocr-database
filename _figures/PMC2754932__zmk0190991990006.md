caption: Model of Udu function in DNA damage response. Udu may be required for DNA
  replication by interacting with MCM3 and MCM4. Without Udu, particularly its PAH-L
  and SANT-L domains, replication cannot proceed properly and DNA damage response
  is activated via Atm-Chk2-p53 pathway. However, the molecular mechanism leading
  to DNA damage response is not clear. Furthermore, it is unknown whether Udu has
  a more direct role in regulating p53 transcriptionally. The cell cycle defects found
  in udu mutants could be replication-linked, in addition to the effect of p53.
