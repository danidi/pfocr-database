caption: Immediate immune responses of pulmonary resident cells to RSV infection in
  neonates. Servier Medical Art has provided images. Neonatal RSV exposure leads to
  an early IL-33 secretion by respiratory epithelial cells []. IL-33 signals through
  its receptor ST2 localized at the membrane of ILC2. This alarmin supports the increase
  in the ILC2 number and IL-13 production in the lungs of RSV-infected neonatal mice
  []. ILC2 can promote a switch towards a type 2 phenotype for AMs or lung DCs at
  a steady state or in a house dust mite-induced asthma model [, ]. Concerning the
  IFN-I pathway, neonatal pDCs display a poor pulmonary mobilization and a weak activation
  of the IFN-I pathway following RSV infection []. AMs are the main source of IFN-I
  in RSV-infected adult lungs, but the question remains open during the neonatal period
  []. Therefore, it is strongly suspected that ILC2 cells are indirectly responsible
  for the inability of neonatal mice to mount an effective IFN-I response to counteract
  RSV infection. In addition, IL-10-secreting nBregs may constitute another cellular
  subset contributing to the type 2 immunity induced by RSV infection in neonates
  [, ].
