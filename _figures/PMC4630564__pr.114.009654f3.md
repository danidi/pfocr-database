caption: Modulation of L-type channels by drugs, toxins, and signaling pathways. (Pathway
  1) The major pharmacologically relevant classes of LTCC active drugs are shown.
  DHPs (prototype nifedipine) are the most selective LTCC blockers. Verapamil and
  diltiazem also block non- LTCCs at higher concentrations (; ). Tetrandrine is a
  bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid. It was isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb
  Stephania tetrandra used in China to treat hypertension and angina (). In addition
  to LTCCs, it also blocks non–L-type current components (). Note that the apparent
  potency of classic L-type channel blockers strongly depends on membrane potential
  and/or stimulation frequency and action potential length. (Pathway 2) L-type channels
  are modulated by a variety of different signaling pathways either through membrane-delimited
  actions of activated G proteins (pathway 2a) or enzymes activated by GPCR (pathway
  2b) or receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) (pathway 2c) signaling (for details, see text).
  The FS2 structure (very similar to calciseptine) was drawn according to PDB ID 1TFS
  (chain trace, disulfide bonds not shown).
