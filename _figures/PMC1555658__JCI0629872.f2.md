caption: When cholesterol levels are sufficient, Insig proteins regulate cholesterol
  synthesis by preventing the activation of SREBPs and promoting the degradation of
  HMG-CoA reductase (left). Cholesterol synthesis becomes dysregulated in Insig-DKO
  embryos (right). Even when cholesterol levels are elevated, activated SREBPs continue
  to promote the transcription of cholesterol synthetic genes, and HMG-CoA reductase
  activity remains high. This results in an accumulation of sterol precursors. The
  Shh signaling pathway is sensitive to perturbation of cholesterol homeostasis. In
  the signaling cell (left), Shh protein is modified by the addition of cholesterol.
  In the responding cell (right), Ptch maintains Smo in an inactive state (SmoI),
  perhaps by preventing sterol binding. Shh binding to Ptch relieves this inhibition.
  Activation of Smo (SmoA) promotes transcription of Shh-responsive genes through
  the Gli family of transcription factors. Adequate cholesterol or oxysterol levels
  appear to be necessary for Smo activation. Accumulating sterol precursors in the
  Insig-DKO embryos could, perhaps via a direct interaction with Smo, alter Shh signaling
  and underlie the genesis of facial clefting reported by Engelking et al. in Insig-DKO
  mice (). GliI, inactive Gli; GliA, activated Gli.
