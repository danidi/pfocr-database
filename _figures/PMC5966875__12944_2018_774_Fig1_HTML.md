caption: Synthesis and metabolism of common bile acids in human. Two major biosynthetic
  pathways of bile acids are shown. The classic pathway accounts for over 90% of total
  bile acids in human. Cholesterol is converted to 7α-hydroxycholesterol by rate-limiting
  enzyme CYP7A1. Then 7α-hydroxycholesterol is converted to 7a-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one
  (C4) by HSD3B7. Under CYP8B1 and CYP27A1, C4 is converted to CA, and without CYP8B1,
  C4 is eventually converted to CDCA. In the alternative pathway, cholesterol is first
  converted to 27-hydroxycholesterol by CYP27A1, and then converted to 3β, 7α-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic
  acid by CYP7B1. 3β, 7α-dihydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid is eventually converted to
  CDCA through a series of reactions. In intestine, CA and CDCA are converted to DCA
  and LCA through microbiota. About 95% of bile acids are reabsorbed in the intestine
  and transported back to the liver. This is called the enterohepatic circulation
  of bile acids. About 5% of the BAs pool is excreted with feces in a day
