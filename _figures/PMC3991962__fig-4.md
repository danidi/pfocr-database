caption: Collaboration between integrins, growth factors, and GFRs. (A) Integrins
  and GFRs can activate the same signaling pathways independent of each other. The
  Ras-MAPK pathway is illustrated as an example of a GFR pathway that can be amplified
  by independent integrin signaling. (B) Integrins and unoccupied GFRs can physically
  interact with each other via bridges formed by cytoplasmic adaptor proteins that
  cluster the 2 types of receptors together. The clustering of GFRs leads to receptor
  transactivation and phosphorylation (green stars) of key residues in the GFR cytoplasmic
  domains followed by induction of the GF signaling pathway. Examples of this scenario
  include EGFR, PDGFR, VEGFR2, or IGFR interacting with αvβ3 integrins. (C) Soluble
  GFs, for example, FGF-1 or IGF-1, can bind both integrins and their cognate receptors,
  thus coupling the 2 receptor types. As discussed above, this clustering leads to
  transactivation and induction of GF signaling pathways. (D) Certain GFs, such as
  VEGF-A and angiopoietins 1 and 2, are able to bind integrins independent of their
  cognate receptors and activate specific signaling pathways.
