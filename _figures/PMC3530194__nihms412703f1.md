caption: (A) The lead compound Bu4ManNAc is used for illustrative purposes; if extracellular
  esterase/lipase degradation is relatively slow (left) then the intact molecule will
  enter the cell; alternately if ester hydrolysis is relatively fast (right) a partially
  degraded metabolite such as 3,4,6-O-Bu3ManNAc will enter the cell (B). In either
  case, the butanoylated analog is subject to further esterase processing to ultimately
  produce fully deprotected ManNAc (B), which can also be derived from 1,3,4-O-Bu3ManNAc
  (or other partially deprotected intermediates, not shown) (C) and used by the sialic
  acid biosynthetic pathway (as described in detail elsewhere,) to produced sialic
  acid and sialylated glycans. (D) Similar esterase processing occurs for peracetylated
  ManNAc (illustrated) and its hydrolysis products as well as to N-acyl, R-modified
  analogs (such as the azido analogs shown in ).
