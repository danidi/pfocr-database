caption: Molecular events occurring in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) following locus coeruleus
  (LC) norepinephrine (NE) loss and autophagy impairment. At LC pre-synaptic terminal.
  Decreased expression of β2-adrenergic receptors in the pre-synaptic terminal leads
  to autophagy suppression. Oxidative stress, NE decrease and IP3 all contribute to
  endoplasmic reticulum stress and impairment of proteins processing, folding and
  trafficking in the trans-Golgi network. Aβ oligomers seeds, deriving from an amyloidogenic
  cleavage of APP, as well as Tau protein, are engulfed into vesicles and released
  into the axo-somatic synaptic cleft. At post-synaptic cortical neuron. (1) Aβ and
  Tau seeds are spread into the synaptic cleft and internalized into the cell body
  of the cortical neuron. (2) The loss of β2-adrenergic receptors (β2R) stimulation
  decreases autophagy. Thus the lack of NE, cannot exert its protective effect in
  the cell, it drives a cascade of detrimental intracellular effects instead. (3,4)
  Ca2+ entry into the cell, increase of cAMP levels, activation of PKA and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
  pathway lead to a further inhibition of autophagy. (A–G) PKA hyper-phosphorylates
  Tau protein (A) which leads to microtubules disgregation (B) and to the formation
  of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). (C) These effects translate into mitochondrial
  damage (D), Golgi fragmentation due to the inactivation of associated binding proteins
  (E) and ER stress (F). These events disrupt the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)
  which does not provide for a proper intracellular trafficking, processing and sorting
  of misfolded Aβ, leading to further increase of harmful oligomers into the cell
  (G). Misfolded proteins are internalized into the endosomal compartment but autophagy
  impairment does not allow their removal and fosters trans-synaptic propagations.
