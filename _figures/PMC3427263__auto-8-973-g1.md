caption: 'Figure 1. CVB3 and autophagy: Proposed interactions, and their pathogenic
  effects. CVB3 infection upregulates autophagy (lower yellow arrow), increasing the
  abundance of small autophagy-like vesicles (ALVs) which may provide a replication
  platform for the virus, allowing it to replicate to high titers, causing extensive
  disease (lower red arrow). Some of the viral RNA is captured by the autophagy pathway
  (conveyor belt) and ultimately encounters and activates TLRs in the autolysosome.
  This causes further upregulation of autophagy, thereby increasing the delivery of
  viral RNA to the TLRs; i.e., we propose that a positive feedback loop may exist
  (top yellow arrow). Viral proteins substantially, but incompletely, block autophagy
  flux (cross-hatched red T). These blocking effects may delay, but cannot prevent,
  the explosive innate response, which causes immunopathological damage, exacerbating
  disease (upper red arrow). In the absence of an intact autophagy pathway (Atg5f/f/Cre+
  mice) both viral replication and TLR activation are reduced, thereby limiting disease.'
