caption: High levels of p53 caused by severe stress such as irreversible DNA damage
  increase oxidative stress to promote the elimination of damaged cells and prevent
  tumorigenesis. p53 can transactivate genes capable of generating ROS during apoptosis.
  In contrast to the antioxidant effects of p53 shown in , the inhibition of both
  mitochondrial metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway may also contribute to
  increase cellular oxidative stress.
