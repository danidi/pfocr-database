caption: Mechanisms underlying DAC-paracetamol interaction. Arachidonic acid (AA)
  is metabolized to eicosanoids through COX, LOX, and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase
  pathways. In addition to DAC limiting cancer cell growth through either activation
  of tumour suppressor genes (TSGs) or viral mimicry (1), it inadvertently activates
  COX-2 PGE2pathway (2), which is contradicted by paracetamol. DAC also upregulates
  CYP2E1 which, in the presence of paracetamol, leads to glutathione depletion and
  ROS accumulation, both enhanced by combined treatment (3). Our preliminary data
  also indicate that DAC potentially downregulates transcription of genes involved
  in antioxidant and thioredoxin responses, preventing cancer cells from developing
  adaptation to oxidative stress and protection from oxidative damage. In addition,
  GSH depletion has the potential to limit the production of LOX pathway metabolites
  dependent on GSH transferases.
