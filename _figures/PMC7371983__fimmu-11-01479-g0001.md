caption: The tumor microenvironment in EGFR-addicted NSCLC. EGFR-mutated NSCLC is
  typically characterized by an “uninflamed” tumor microenvironment, immunological
  tolerance, and weak immunogenicity. Recently, it was suggested that the over-expression
  of CD39/CD73—adenosine signaling also induces an immunosuppressive TME. Indeed,
  CD39/CD73 ectonucleotidases are widely expressed by lung cancer cells and induce
  the high extracellular production and release of immunosuppressive adenosine that
  shapes the activity of innate and adaptive immune system cells and endothelial cells
  in TME. Specifically, the activation of CD39 induces the de-phosphorylation of ATP
  to ADP and, subsequently, to AMP, while CD73 catalyzes the hydrolysis of AMP into
  adenosine and phosphate. By binding the A2A adenosine receptor A2AR, the most common
  receptor subtype expressed by both adaptive and innate immunity, extracellular adenosine
  induces inhibitory signals in TME that restrain the activity of immune system cells,
  promoting growth and survival of EGFR-mutated lung cancer cells. In addition, exosomes
  derived by tumor cells also contribute to modulate immunosuppression by influencing
  PD-L1+/CD73+ expression and extracellular adenosine release. EGFR, Epidermal growth
