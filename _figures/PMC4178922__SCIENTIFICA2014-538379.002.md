caption: Fgf7 and Fgf10 signaling via Fgfr2b controls proliferation versus chemotaxis,
  respectively. (a)–(c) Mesenchyme-free epithelium from E11.5 lungs was grown for
  48 hours in Matrigel in absence (a) or presence of Fgf7 (b) or Fgf10 (c). Note the
  formation of a cyst-like structure with Fgf7 versus distinct primary and secondary
  bud formation with Fgf10. (d), (e) Proposed model for Fgf7 versus Fgf10 action via
  Fgfr2b according to []. (d) Fgf7 induces transient signaling and Fgfr2b degradation
  leading to proliferation. (e) Fgf10 leads to sustained signaling which is associated
  with Fgfr2b recycling, phosphorylation of Y734 of Fgfr2b, and recruitment of p85/p110/SH3bp4
  complex leading to chemotaxis.
