caption: 'Defects in ribosomal biogenesis activate p53 and other stress-response mechanisms.
  A schematic showing pre-rRNA transcription, and assembly of accessory factors and
  RPs on the nascent pre-rRNA. (A) Recent studies have suggested that problems with
  pre-rRNA processing can affect DNA transcription, leading to the activation of ATR-ATM-Chk1/2
  signaling (which is responsible for the replication-stress and DNA-damage checkpoints)
  and p53 upregulation. In addition, deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) imbalance
  caused by RP deficiency might interfere with transcription and replication and contribute
  to ATR-ATM activation. (B) Problems with pre-RNA processing compromise ribosome
  biogenesis and lead to nucleolar disruption. The nucleolus is involved in maintaining
  low p53 levels by exporting it for degradation. Various stressors disrupt nucleolar
  organization, compromising p53 export and leading to p53 accumulation in the nucleus.
  Nucleolar disruption might also lead to the release of factors that activate p53
  or cause cell cycle arrest by p53-independent mechanisms. (C) An alternative pathway
  of p53 activation is through free RPs that, in complex with 5S RNA, bind the p53
  negative regulator MDM2, releasing p53 from its control. (D) Upregulation of MYC
  and RAS pro-survival factors in DBA patients and in animal models suggests that
  they might activate p14ARF, which, in complex with 5S RNA, also negatively regulates
  MDM2. Hypothetically, additional not-yet-identified nucleolar factors might also
  negatively interact with MDM2 and contribute to p53 upregulation. (E) p53 might
  also be activated by secondary changes in RP-deficient cells, such as increased
  levels of ROS or decreased levels of ATP, which activates AMPK, which, in turn,
  activates p53. p53 then translocates to the nucleus. (F) p53 activation leads to
  cell cycle arrest and to the induction of downstream pathways ranging from cellular
  repair to apoptotic mechanisms. (G) A p53-independent response might also originate
  from the cytoplasm owing to a decreased number and altered activity of ribosomes,
  which also can lead to cell cycle arrest. For example, decreased levels of cyclins
  or PIM1 caused by RP deficiency might inhibit cell cycle progression. Abbreviations:
