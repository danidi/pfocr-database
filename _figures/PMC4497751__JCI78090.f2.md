caption: PI3K inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for acute and advanced leukemia
  (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01756118 and NCT01396499), B and T cell lymphoma
  (NCT02049541, NCT02017613, NCT01693614, NCT01282424, NCT01796470, NCT02367040, NCT01306643,
  NCT01719250, NCT01088048, NCT02258555, NCT01300026, and NCT01705847), asthma (NCT01653756),
  and allergic rhinitis (NCT01066611 and NCT00836914), and preclinical data support
  their therapeutic potential in autoimmune diseases, as well (). The immune system
  is highly sensitive to manipulation of PI3K signaling, and this pathway is subject
  to several layers of regulation that permit fine-tuning of signal output. Just a
  two-fold change in PI3K signal activity through Akt is sufficient to alter lymphocyte
  homeostasis and induce autoimmunity in mice (). This degree of fine-tuning falls
  well within the range of regulation mediated by miRNAs. The PI3K pathway is strictly
  regulated by the phosphatases PTEN and SHIP, which dephosphorylate PI3K products
  and/or limit substrate availability. PTEN is a prominent target of many miRNAs (miR-17~92
  and miR-181 family members) in many different immune cell types (Th1, Th2, Th17,
  Tfh, CD8 T cells, and B cells). SHIP is a prominent target of miR-155 and appears
  to play an important role in its proinflammatory functions in several cell lineages.
  miRNAs also modulate PI3K signaling by targeting downstream signaling mediators
  and inhibitors. Understanding which miRNAs are expressed in specific cell types,
  as well as understanding the varying limiting roles played by their targets, will
  lead to a more comprehensive understanding of miRNA regulation of cell fates and
  behaviors.
