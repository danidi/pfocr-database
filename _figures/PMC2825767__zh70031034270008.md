caption: Model of global metabolic changes in the Chga knockout mouse. An integrated
  model to explain how ablation of the Chga gene in the mouse leads to global metabolic
  changes and dissociation of metabolic syndrome phenotypes is presented. The loss
  of Chga protein also causes a loss of its bioactive peptides—catestatin and pancreastatin
  are shown here. Catestatin and pancreastatin are likely to have both genomic (through
  the PAINT-identified transcriptional networks) and nongenomic effects on metabolism.
  The effects of lack of catestatin on adrenal catecholamine release, plasma catecholamine
  levels, and blood pressure were previously demonstrated by Mahapatra et al. ().
