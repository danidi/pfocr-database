caption: Conceptual model of circadian clock in Drosophila. The model depicts multiple
  interlocked loops, which are centrally governed by the heterodimer CLK-CYC. For
  simplicity, we do not differ genes from regulatory sequences and proteins, in each
  case (e.g., PER) these are represented by their names and colored boxes. Arrows
  indicate positive/enhanced regulation, while blunted ends indicate negative/inhibitory
  regulation. Gray solid lines depict transcription regulation, while deep blue lines
  depict protein-protein interactions. Yellow lines show direction of light entrainment
  pathway, while brown lines depict temperature entrainment pathway. Dashed lines
  represent pathways that are plausible, but not fully described. While IR25a within
  the ChO is required for pacemaker synchronization, the roles of TRPA1 and PYX channels
  in temperature sensing remain to be elucidated. Temperature and light entrainment
  is also modulated by PLC encoded by norpA.
