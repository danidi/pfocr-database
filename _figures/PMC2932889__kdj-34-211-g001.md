caption: Interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and protein phosphorylation. (A) O-GlcNAc
  modification is strongly dependent on the concentration of UDP-GlcNAc produced by
  the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). OGT uses UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate for
  GlcNAcylation on protein serine and threonine residues. O-GlcNAcase (OGA) removes
  the O-GlcNAc moiety from O-GlcNAc-modified proteins. PUGNAC inhibits the activity
  of O-GlcNAcase. (B) O-GlcNAc modification is analogous to protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.
  Interplay between GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation can affect the activities or
  stabilities of the proteins, and both processes can occur on the same protein at
  proximal sites.
