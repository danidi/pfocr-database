caption: Proposed mechanism by which type-2 diabetes (T2DM) can affect the brain and
  leads to insulin resistance with subsequent effects on synaptic plasticity and mental
  health. It also suggests a mechanistic pathway by which insulin signaling and BDNF
  signaling can act on metabolic pathways that regulate brain plasticity and function.
  T2DM leads to the disruption of insulin and BDNF receptor signaling, thereby affecting
  the co-transcriptional regulator PGC-1α signaling. Impairment in PGC-1α function
  decreases mitochondrial biogenesis by suppressing mitochondrial DNA transcription,
  and mitochondrial proliferation through mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM).
  Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a byproduct of mitochondrial electron transport chain,
  leads to generation of 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) via lipid peroxidation. In turn,
  4HNE disrupts mitochondrial function and overall neuronal functions. The treatment
  with liraglutide (LIR), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist, prevents the
  detrimental influence of T2DM on synaptic plasticity by enhancing insulin receptor
  signaling in brain, and possibly by reducing oxidative stress (ROS). Dietary energy
  restriction (RES) mainly increases mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby helping to
  preserve brain plasticity and mental health under diabetic condition. Overall, these
  events are important to understand how T2DM influences brain functions and synaptic
  plasticity. The insulin and mitochondrial interventions appear crucial for the maintenance
  of neuronal function and promote mental health.
