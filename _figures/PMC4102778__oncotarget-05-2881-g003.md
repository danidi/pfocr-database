caption: Some of the regulatory interactions between GSK-3 and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways are indicated. An activated growth factor receptor
  is indicated in blue. Ras and Rheb are indicated in dark blue ovals. IRS1, Shc,
  Grb2, Sos and beta-catenin are indicated in orange ovals. Kinases are indicated
  in green ovals with the exception of GSK-3beta which is indicated in a red oval.
  The p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K is indicated in a green oval. The phosphatases
  which inhibit steps in this pathway are indicated in black octagons. The phosphatases
  PP2A and PP1 which may activate GSK-3 are indicated in yellow octagons. NF1, TSC1
  and TSC2 are indicated in black squares. PIP2 and PIP3 are indicated in yellow ovals.
  The mTORC1 inhibitor is indicated in a red octagon. The AMPK activator Metformin
  is indicated in a green octagon. mTOR interacting proteins which positively regulate
  mTOR activity are indicated in yellow ovals. mTOR interacting proteins which negatively
  regulate mTOR activity are indicated in black ovals. Transcription factors activated
  by either ERK or Akt phosphorylation are indicated in yellow diamonds. The FKHR
  transcription factor that is inactivated by Akt phosphorylation is indicated by
  a black diamond and a white P in a black circle. FKHR is also activated by GSK-3beta
  phosphorylation which is indicated by a white P in a red circle. beta-catenin is
  indicated in an orange oval. mRNA initiation factors and proteins associated with
  the ribosome are indicated in magenta ovals. mTORC1 phosphorylates the unc-51-like
  kinase 1 (ULK1) which results in the suppression of autophagy. ULK1 is indicated
  in a black oval. In contrast, AMPK activates both ULK1 and autophagy as well as
  TSC activity. Proteins involved in the regulation of translation are indicated in
  purple ovals. Red arrows indicate activating events in pathways. Black arrows indicate
  inactivating events in pathway. Activating phosphorylation events are depicted in
  red circles with Ps with a black outlined circle. Inactivating phosphorylation events
  are depicted in black circles with Ps with a red outlined circle. This figure is
  provided to give the reader an idea of the complex interactions of GSK-3 with various
  signaling molecules in the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways which
  are key in regulating cellular proliferation survival and often become dysregulated
  in cancer.
