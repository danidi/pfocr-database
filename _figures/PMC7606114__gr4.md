caption: 'Lysosome and pyroptosis. In pyroptosis, lysosomal rupture can be initiated
  by various crystalline materials, nano-particles, chemical compounds, rare earth
  oxide, and maybe ROS. Subsequent CatB release and K+ efflux activate NLRP3 inflammasome.
  But in pyroptosis induced by the endocytosis of HMGB1, lysosome destabilization
  and CatB release are necessary for pyroptosome formation. Activated NLRP3 inflammasome
  or pyroptosome stimulates caspase-1. CatB can be inhibited by Ca074Me, endogenous
  cystatin C, or genetic knockout of CatB. Lysosome destabilization caused by HMGB1
  is also indispensable for LPS-induced activation of non-canonical inflammasome and
  caspase-11, since it allows LPS internalized through HMGB1–RAGE signaling pathway
  to escape from lysosomal degradation. Activated caspase-1 and -11 drive the cleavage
  of pro-IL-1β/18 and GSDMD, coordinating membrane lysis, mature IL-1β/18 release
  and ultimate pyroptosis. CatB: cathepsin B.'
