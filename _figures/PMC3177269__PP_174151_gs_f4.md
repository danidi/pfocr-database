caption: Proposed model for a common symbiotic signaling pathway between actinorhizal
  plants and legumes. The common genes identified in A. glutinosa and/or C. glauca
  were assigned to infection and organogenesis pathways. Black boxes indicate legume
  genes not yet identified in A. glutinosa or C. glauca. The common pathway between
  RNS and AM is indicated by the gray box. Adapted from .
