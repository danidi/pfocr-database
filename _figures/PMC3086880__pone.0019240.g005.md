caption: This figure displays a subset of the C. elegans Notch pathway with selected
  predicted pathway member proteins and their properties. This image includes multiple
  snapshots taken from the interactive ortholog viewer available at http://signalink.org.
  Links representing interactions with direct and indirect evidence are displayed
  as normal and dashed line styles, respectively. Activations (and inhibitions) are
  represented with normal (and blunted) arrows.
