caption: Certain transcription factors, Nrf2 and Bach1, appear to play an important
  role in regulating HO-1 expression in cardiovascular conditions. Specifically, Nrf2
  and Bach1 form heterodimers with Maf proteins and bind to consensus antioxidant
  response element (ARE) sequences in the HO-1 promoter. Nrf2 transactivates the HO-1
  promoter and may provide protection against diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
  Bach-1 competes with Nrf2/Maf dimers and represses HO-1 transcription. Accordingly,
  deficiency of Bach1 has been shown to be protective in animal models of atherosclerosis,
  myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury, and vascular injury.
