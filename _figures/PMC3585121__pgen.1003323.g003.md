caption: Arrows indicate one or more steps catalyzed by products of the genes indicated,
  where each idt/ltm gene is designated by its final letter (G = idtG/ltmG, etc.).
  Arrows and genes in blue indicate steps in synthesis of the first fully cyclized
  intermediate (paspaline). Arrows and genes in red indicate steps in decoration of
  paspaline to give the variety of indole-diterpenes in the Clavicipitaceae. Structures
  shown in gray are not yet verified.
