caption: 'Sex differentiation during embryonic and foetal life in mammals: the mesonephros
  and the coelomic epithelium are stabilized and their cells proliferate, in response
  to the action of GATA4, EMX2, CBX2, LHX9 and WT1 -which upregulate SF1-, SIX1 and
  SIX4, TCF21 and members of the IGF family, to form the undifferentiated gonad. In
  XY foetuses, SRY expression is triggered by MAP3K4, GATA4, JMJDA1, WT1 and SF1;
  SRY upregulates SOX9 and other SOX family members. SOX9, PGD2 and FGF9 establish
  a positive feed-forward loop, which increases SOX9 expression, which prevails over
  DAX1, FOXL2, WNT4 and RSPO1, thus promoting testicular differentiation. The developing
  testis secretes testosterone and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), responsible for male
  differentiation of internal and external genitalia; testosterone can be transformed
  into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a more potent androgen, through the action of the
  enzyme 5α-reductase (5α-Red); both testosterone and DHT act on the same androgen
  receptor (AR). In the XX foetuses, due to the absence of SRY, SOX9 expression remains
  low and is overcome by DAX1, FOXL2, WNT4 and RSPO1, which upregulate β-catenin;
  a feed-forward loop between these pro-ovarian factors is established, resulting
  in the differentiation of the female gonad. Since the ovary does not secrete androgens
  and AMH, internal and external genitalia develop through the female pathway. Modified
