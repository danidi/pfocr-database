caption: 'Pathogenetic mechanisms in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL). (a) LMP-1,
  a member of the TNF receptor family, is constitutively activated and leads to ligand-independent
  activation of NF-kB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). LMP1/EBNA2 viral
  proteins transcriptionally target c-myc and activate NF-kB, which translocates into
  the nucleus and regulates MYC to induce proliferation and activate survivin. They
  also increase the sensitivity of the infected cell to IL-2, which promotes growth.
  LMP-1 upregulates PD-L1, which is postulated to occur through the MAPK/NF-kB pathway.
  (b) LCK/ZAP70: the kinase LCK is activated after major histocompatibility complex
  (MHC)-peptide binding, or presumably by genetic alteration, and can then phosphorylate
  immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), leading to the recruitment
  of the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP70. Lymphocyte-cell-specific protein-tyrosine
  kinase (LCK) activation can also lead to autophosphorylation of ZAP70, which in
  turn activates the LAT and SLP-76 and the PLC-γ and MEK/extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK) pathways. The recruitment and activation of LAT and its subsequent
  recruitment of several molecules such as GRAP2 and ITK, modulate T-cell transcriptional
  regulation and gene expression related to survival, apoptosis, proliferation, and
  migration of T-cells. Docking protein 2 (DOK2) can impart negative feedback on NK-cell
  activation with presumed inhibition of ZAP-70. LCK activation also leads to the
  phosphorylation and activation of ITK. (c) JAK/STAT and EZH2: JAK/STAT represents
  a pro-proliferative signaling pathway, mutations in which can cause constitutive
  activation in ENKTL. JAK3 and STAT3 phosphorylation have been reported to occur
  in a majority of tested ENKTL cases and can also cause presumed activation of this
  pathway. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase and part
  of the PRC2 complex and is involved in epigenetic regulation. Phosphorylation of
  EZH2 by JAK3 can initiate dissociation of PRC2 which leads to decreased H3K27me3
  levels and confers EZH2 independent activity as a transcriptional coactivator for
  genes involved in DNA replication and tumor invasion. Abbreviations: LMP-1: latent
