caption: Design of probe AFG-1 inspired by the characteristic of the autophagic pathway.
  In the initial stage of autophagy, the up-regulated ONOO- oxidizes the electron-rich
  aryl group (blue) into a quinone which is then cleaved following hydrolysis, yielding
  the daughter probe accompanied by a fluorescent switch-on response. As autophagy
  proceeds and autolysosomes form, the increased acidity in the microenvironment protonates
  the daughter probe, causing a further fluorescence enhancement.
