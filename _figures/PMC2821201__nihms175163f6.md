caption: 'A diagrammatic model to summarize the role and subcellular localization
  of survivin and its splice variants in the regulation of apoptosis and control of
  mitosis in cancer cells. (1) The dynamic Cdc2-phosphorylated survivin localizes
  on the mitotic spindle and centrosome to inhibit a “default” apoptotic pathway during
  mitosis, and to facilitate microtubule polymerization and spindle formation. (2)
  The dynamic Aurora B-phosphorylated/K63-ubiquitin survivin complexes with Aurora
  B and INCENP, and plays a leading role in the binding of the chromosomal passenger
  protein complex to the centromere/kinetochore of chromosomes to control the precise
  completion of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. (3) Survivin also localizes
  in mitochondria and is released into the cytoplasm upon apoptotic insult. The released
  survivin and/or other cytoplasmic survivin may interact with many other proteins
  to exert its role in apoptosis inhibition, G1/S transition/cell-cycle progression
  and possible other functions. Some of the survivin-associated proteins identified
  include HBXIP, HSP90, XIAP, and cIAP-1. Additionally, mitochondrial-associated survivin
  may block apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) release and nuclear translocation as a
  mechanism for caspase-independent apoptosis control. (4) Survivin-2B localizes in
  mitochondria. One potential way for survivin-2B to induce cell death is that increased
  survivin-2B may be able to physically interact with and block the release of survivin
  from mitochondria for caspase inhibition. Alternatively, survivin-2B may also promote
  the AIF release and nuclear translocation. (5) It has been shown that survivin-ΔEx3
  is localized in mitochondria and nuclei in interphase cells, and translocated to
  the mitotic spindle during mitosis. However, whether survivin-ΔEx3 plays a role
  in the spindle checkpoint and apoptosis control remains to be determined. It was
  shown that survivin-ΔEx3 is degraded in the nucleolus through the ubiquitination
  pathway although the significance of this phenomenon remains to be explored. (6)
  Survivin-ΔptEx2/3 and survivin-2 α were shown to be associated with the chromosomal
  DNA during mitosis in certain conditions. However, whether survivin-ΔptEx2/3 and
  survivin-2 α play a role during mitosis or whether the function of centromere-associated
  survivin can be modulated by survivin-ΔptEx2/3 and/or survivin-2 α remains to be
  determined in the future study. Note: The subcellular localization of survivin-3B
  is not clear currently and remains to be determined as well.'
