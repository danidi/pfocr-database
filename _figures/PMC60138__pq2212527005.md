caption: A simplified scheme of the tetrapyrrole biosynthesis pathway of higher plants.
  It predicts two metabolic feedback loops, one that is controlled by free heme and
  a second that depends on FLU. Enzymes that may be subject to control have been indicated.
  As shown by question marks, there are several possibilities of how FLU could regulate
  ALA synthesis.
