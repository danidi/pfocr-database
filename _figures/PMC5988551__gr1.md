caption: Schematic depicting how PC1/3 knockdown impacts macrophage activation. PC1/3
  knockdown promotes the formation of endosomes and MVB release of inflammatory chemokines
  and cytokines via the non-canonical secretion pathway (1). Danger signal molecules
  (DAMs) can activate TLR4 and TLR9 (2) and induce the MyD88-dependent pathway with
  increased NF-κB (3) nuclear translocation (4) linked to Ca2+ mobilization in PC1/3
  KD macrophages (5). Both of these phenomena are also implicated in cytokines, chemokines,
  DAMs and tumor viability inhibitor release as well as cytoskeletal rearrangements
  leading to the formation of filopodia (6). We then noticed that during LPS challenge,
  the loop was amplified and driven toward the induction of increased Ca2+ release
  from the ER, greater numbers of filopodia and MVBs, the release of additional immune
  factors and a greater number of anti-tumor factors. Under ODN-CpG challenge, we
  observed that PC1/3 moved rapidly to CpG-ODN-containing endosomes and lysosomes
  and subsequently co-localized with TLR9. In PC1/3 knockdown macrophages, compartmentalization
  of TLR9 was altered, and formed clusters at the cell periphery. Under CpG-ODN treatment,
  PC1/3-KD macrophages secreted more pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, CXCL2, and
  IL1α) and less CCL5 and CXCL10. We have thus established that PC1/3 inhibition clearly
  affects TLR9 trafficking and signaling and not its activation. All experimental
  procedures have been published in .

    PC1/3 knockdown promotes the formation of endosomes and MVB release of inflammatory
