caption: 'Monocytes in sickle cell disease. Interaction of sickle red blood cells
  (RBC) with endothelial cells enhances cellular oxidant stress, resulting in increased
  transendothelial migration of blood monocytes. Suspected mechanisms of monocyte
  activation in sickle cell disease (SCD) involve hypoxemia, platelet-monocyte aggregates
  mediated by P-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 interaction, RBC/reticulocyte-monocyte
  interactions, placental growth factor released from RBC and co-stimulation of toll-like
  receptor 4 by heme and lipopolysaccharide. SCD activated monocytes display increased
  expression of CD1, CD11b and tissue factor on their surfaces, as well as increased
  production of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α. In turn, activated monocytes
  activate endothelial cells through the nuclear factor-κB pathway, resulting in enhanced
  expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule
  1 and E-selectin. Patrolling monocytes uptake cellular debris derived from heme-exposed
  endothelial cells, thus leading to high expression of heme oxygenase-1. Patrolling
  monocytes also scavenge endothelium-adherent sickle RBC. HO-1: heme oxygenase-1;
  ICAM-1: intercellular adhesion molecule 1: IL1-β: interleukin 1 beta; LPS: lipopolysaccharide;
  Lu/BCAM: Lutheran/basal cell adhesion molecule; NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; PlGF:
  placental growth factor; PSGL-1: P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1; TF: tissue factor;
  TLR4: toll-like receptor 4; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha; VCAM-1: vascular
