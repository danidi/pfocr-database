caption: Model for negative regulation of Wnt signaling pathway by corepressors  SMRT
  and NCoR. In cells with a low level of corepressors SMRT and NCoR or  aberrant cytoplasmic
  localization (left), Wnt signals enable the  accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus,
  where it binds to TCF4,  displaces the corepressor complexes containing HDACs, and
  enhances  transcriptional activation of Wnt-responsive target genes by recruiting  additional
  coactivators, such as the histone acetylase CBP/p300. In cells with  high level
  of SMRT and NCoR (right), SMRT and NCoR can form complexes  with both β-catenin
  and TCF4. In response to Wnt signals, TCF4 and  β-catenin can still be recruited
  to the promoter region of Wnt signaling  target genes. However, SMRT and NCoR are
  also indirectly recruited by both  β-catenin and TCF4 to the same binding sites.
  Because SMRT and NCoR can  associate with HDACs and form a corepressor complex with
  additional proteins,  the transcriptional activity of Wnt signaling target genes
  is inhibited.
