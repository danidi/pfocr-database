caption: In the pre-diabetic state, WAT and skeletal muscle produce more activator
  (WNT3a) and less inhibitor (WNT4) of canonical Wnt signaling pathway, leading to
  the upregulation of Wnt signaling in pancreatic β-cells in an endocrine-dependent
  manner. Activated Wnt pathway triggers the adaptation of β-cells to systemic insulin
  resistance by increasing insulin secretion and β-cell proliferation. In the diabetic
  state (induced by 16-week HF diet), insulin-resistant tissues produce less WNT3a
  and more WNT4, which downregulates Wnt signaling in pancreatic β-cells. The reduction
  of Wnt pathway activation downregulates β-cell proliferation rate and insulin secretion,
  thereby negatively affecting β-cell adaptation to systemic insulin resistance and
  leading to pancreatic islet dysfunction.
