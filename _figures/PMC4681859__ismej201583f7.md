caption: 'The 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate CO2 fixation cycle that is potentially
  operative in Calditenuis aerorheumensis (modified from ). mRNA reads from OS mapped
  to this pathway are reported as RPKM to take into account varying transcript lengths
  of the corresponding genes. Enzymes in the cycle: 1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; 2,
  malonyl-CoA reductase; 3, malonate semialdehyde reductase; 4, 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA
  synthetase; 5, 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase; 6, acryloyl-CoA reductase; 7,
  propionyl-CoA carboxylase; 8, methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase; 9, methylmalonyl-CoA
  mutase; 10, succinyl-CoA reductase; 11, succinate semialdehyde reductase; 12, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
  synthetase; 13, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase; 14, crotonyl-CoA hydratase; 15,
  3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase; 16, acetoacetyl-CoA β-ketothiolase. Note: 1,
  missing the biotin carboxylase subunit of bifunctional acetyl/propionyl-CoA carboxylase.
  Genes and corresponding RPKM values are presented in .'
