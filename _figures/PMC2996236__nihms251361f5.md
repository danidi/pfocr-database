caption: Pathogenesis of the complement-mediated autoinflammatory disease atypical
  hemolytic uremic syndrome. Activating gain-of-function mutations in CFB increase
  C3bBb convertase stability and lead to permanent activation of the alternative pathway
  of complement. Autoantibodies against, and inactivating mutations within negative
  regulators of this process have also been described, such as for complement factor
  H (CFH) and membrane cofactor protein (MCP), which are cofactors for the inactivation
  of C3b by complement factor I (CFI). Asterisks denote proteins that carry mutations
  with known disease associations.
