caption: Scheme for the catabolism of l-arginine to l -ornithine/urea or l-citrulline/NO,
  production of polyamines and anabolism and catabolism of proline. Also shown are
  the pathway for synthesis of l-arginine from l-glutamine, the reversible pathway
  between l-ornithine and l-glutamine, and the recycling of l-citrulline into l-arginine.
  ASL, argininosuccinate lyase; ASS, argininosuccinate synthase; NOS, nitric oxide
  synthase; OAT; ornithine aminotransferase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; OTC, ornithine
  transcarbamylase. Arginase (top left) is the final enzyme in the urea cycle within
  the liver, which restarts the cycle through the synthesis of l-citrulline from carbamoyl-phosphate
  (1) and l-ornithine (2) by OTC (middle). It should be noted that not all of these
  reactions occur within a given cell. In particular, the urea cycle is independent
  of the other reactions, i.e., l-arginine produced in the urea cycle is not a substrate
  for NOS and l-ornithine produced in the urea cycle is not a substrate for OAT or
  ODC.
