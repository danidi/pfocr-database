caption: The two-phase model of parasite clearance in An. gambiae. In the first wave,
  or early phase of parasite killing, complement-like components (including TEP1)
  circulating in the mosquito hemolymph bind to ookinetes in a response ultimately
  leading to parasite killing. Surviving parasites are later subjected to a second
  wave, or late phase, of immune responses that act on the developing oocyst and are
  triggered by epithelial damage produced by ookinete invasion of the midgut. Central
  to this response, mosquito blood cells (hemocytes) undergo differentiation, a process
  that requires LL3 and genes of the STAT pathway. Additional cellular and humoral
  responses are likely to influence oocyst survival. Gr, granulocyte; Oe, oenocytoid;
  Pr, prohemocyte.
