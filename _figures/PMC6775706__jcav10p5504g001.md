caption: The role of cyclin D-CDK4/6-INK4-Rb pathway in breast cancer. CDK4 and CDK6
  play a very important role in cell cycle entry, including cross talk with other
  oncogenic signal pathways. When the cell prepares to initiate DNA synthesis, upstream
  mitogenic pathways increase cyclin D1 levels, which may activate CDK4/6. Active
  complex of CDK4/6 and cyclin D1 phosphorylates and inactivates RB protein, which
  is then phosphorylated by other complexes such as cyclin E-CDK2 in the late G1 phase.
  Phosphorylated RB releases transcription factor E2F, permitting the up-regulation
  of E2F activation and transcription of client genes required for cell cycle G1/S
  transition. Cyclin A2-CDK2 complex increases and phosphorylates proteins involved
  in DNA synthesis, thereby driving S phase progression. The kinase activity of CDK4/6
  is tightly suppressed by endogenous inhibitors, such as Cip/Kip family members (p21Cip1,
  nonphosphorylated p27Kip1 and p57Kip2) and INK4 family proteins (p16INK4a, p15INK4b,
  p18INK4c and p19INK4d), and pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibitors. And nonphosphorylated
  p27 suppress the CDK2 and has an oncogenic function to maintain cyclin D-CDK4 activity.
