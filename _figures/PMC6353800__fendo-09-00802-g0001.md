caption: Schematic overview of major enzymes and metabolites involved in the regulation
  of gluconeogenesis. Pyruvate derived from lactate and alanine enters the mitochondrion,
  where it is carboxylated to oxaloacetate (OAA) by pyruvate carboxylase (PC). OAA
  is then reduced to malate to be shuttled to the cytoplasm where it is reoxidized
  to OAA, which is decarboxylated and then phosphorylated to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
  by PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK). PEP then enters the gluconeogenic cycle. After several
  steps of reverse glycolysis, the yield fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP) is dephosphorylated
  by fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) to form fructose 6-phosphate, which is then
  converted to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by phosphoglucoisomerase. G6P is finally
  converted to glucose via dephosphorylation by glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). Other
  gluconeogenic amino acids (Asp/Asn and Glu/Gln) are converted into alanine or specific
  intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for gluconeogenesis. Glycerol
  is converted to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is then converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (Glyceral-3-P) or F1,6BP entering the gluconeogenic pathway. ALT, alanine aminotransaminase;
  AST, aspartate aminotransaminase; GK, glucokinase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MDH,
  malate dehydrogenase. Gluconeogenic and glycolytic enzymes are highlighted in red
  and green, respectively.
