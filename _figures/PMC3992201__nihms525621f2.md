caption: The role of genes identified in GWAS of Phase 1+2 AA subjects using a case-control
  model in the canonical pathway “calcium signaling.” The gene or gene families with
  a significant association result are shown in orange. The calcineurin family was
  identified by an association in PPP3CA, the CREB family by CREB5, the HDAC family
  by HDAC9, and the CAMK2 family by CAMK2B (see table “pathway SNPs”). For a full
  description of the functional relationships represented by the various lines and
  arrows, see:http://www.biolreprod.org/content/suppl/2010/09/29/biolreprod.110.085910.DC1/biolreprod.110.085910-3.pdf.
