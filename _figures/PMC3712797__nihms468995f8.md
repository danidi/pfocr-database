caption: 'Model of the involvement of BAFF, IL-17A and T cells during immature B-cell
  differentiation and plasma cell generation. WT mice (upper left quadrant): Immature
  B-cell (IMB) survival and differentiation is under the control of Act1 ( ) negatively
  affecting BAFF and CD40L and positively affecting IL-17A induced signaling (reviewed
  in []). TCRβ/δ−/− mice (lower left panel) express increased levels of BAFF by a
  yet unknown mechanism, resulting in elevated IMB survival and differentiation into
  marginal zone (MZ) and follicular mature (FM) B cells. Due to the lack of T cells
  (CD40L), however, no Ig class switching takes place and antibodies present are IgM
  only. B6.Act1−/− mice (upper right quadrant) have normal levels of BAFF, but increased
  responsiveness due to the lack of Act1 []. This drives IMB survival and differentiation
  into MZ and FM B cells []. Furthermore, as Act1-mediated negative regulation of
  CD40 signaling is lacking, the formation of IgG-secreting autoreactive plasma cells
  (PC) is increased. Combined deficiency of T cells and Act1 (lower right quadrant)
  results in both high levels of BAFF and BAFF hyperresponsiveness [] driving the
  accumulation of MZ and FM B cells, but due to the lack of CD40L-expressing T cells,
  still inhibited Ig class switching. IL-17 is induced during inflammatory conditions
  and further enhances B-cell survival, proliferation and differentiation in WT mice
  []. Lack of T cells or Act1 will each separately abrogate this pathway.'
