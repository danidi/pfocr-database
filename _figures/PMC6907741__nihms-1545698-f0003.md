caption: (A) Factors in the tumor microenvironment drive the expression of B7x in
  tumor cells and macrophages. TGFβ1 and hypoxia drive B7x expression in tumor cells
  through Smad and HIF1α signaling, respectively. Smad3/4 signaling in tumor cells
  downregulates the miRNA-mediated inhibition of B7x mRNA translation. Further, tumor
  cells secrete IL-6 and IL-10 to drive B7x expression in macrophages through the
  Jak-STAT3 pathway. The NFκB (RelA) pathway also promotes transcription of B7x in
  tumor-associated macrophages. (B) B7x is expressed on pancreatic beta cells and
  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in pancreatic islets. Loss of B7x in these cells
  is associated with immune-mediated killing of beta cells, and subsequent development
  of autoimmune diabetes. In pancreatic islet cells and islet-APCs, B7x is lost through
  proteolytic cleavage of the B7x protein. The metalloprotease Nardilysin (NRD1) cleaves
  the membrane-bound B7x, releasing it as a less-functional, soluble form.
