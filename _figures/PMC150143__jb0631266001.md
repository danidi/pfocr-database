caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway for the assembly of ECA. (A) Structure of trisaccharide
  repeat unit of ECA. Amino sugars A, B, and C are N-acetyl-α-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc),
  N-acetyl-β-d-mannosaminuronic acid (ManNAcA), and 4-acetamido-4,6-dideoxy-α-d-galactose
  (Fuc4NAc), respectively. (B) Enzymatic reactions and genetic loci involved in the
  biosynthesis of ECA. The structural genes of the enzymes that catalyze individual
  reactions are indicated in italics. Abbreviations: Und-P, undecaprenyl-monophosphate;
  Und-PP, undecaprenylpyrophosphate; TTP, thymidine triphosphate; PPi, inorganic pyrophosphate;
  α-KG, α-ketoglutaric acid; acetyl-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; CoASH, coenzyme A; TDP,
  dTDP. The individual amino sugars are abbreviated as described above.'
