caption: TLR3/TLR4-mediated signaling pathways. Engagement of TLR3 or TLR4 with poly(I:C)
  or LPS induces the interaction between TRIF and RIP3 through their RHIM domains.
  In the presence of caspase inhibitor, z-VAD, TRIF/RIP3 elicits downstream ROS accumulation
  and subsequently executes necrotic death independent of NF-κB activation and IRF3-dependent
  type I IFNs. TLR3/TLR4-mediated necrosis further triggers the induction of inflammatory
  cytokines.
