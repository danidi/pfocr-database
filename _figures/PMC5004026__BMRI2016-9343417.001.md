caption: Life cycle and functions of the peroxisomes in M. oryzae. (a) Model of life
  cycle of the peroxisomes. The peroxisomes are synthesized from the ER and then mature
  through peroxisome biogenesis process. During the fission inducing condition, the
  matured peroxisomes can be elongated, and then the daughter peroxisomes can be produced
  by the fission process, the newly formed peroxisomes will mature through the biogenesis
  process, and the matured peroxisomes can be elongated again for another fission
  cycle. When the fission inducing condition is removed, the redundant peroxisomes
  can be eliminated through pexophagy process. (b) Function of the peroxisomes during
  fungal infection. When the conidia attach the host surface, the cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway is activated, leading to mobilization of the lipid stores by lipolysis,
  and produces the fatty acids and glycerol. The glycerol will be used to generate
  turgor. The fatty acids will be taken by the peroxisomes for β-oxidation, which
  can produce mass of acetyl CoA. Acetyl CoA can be used by the glyoxylate cycle and
  gluconeogenesis to produce glucose for infection or be used to synthesize melanin
  and cell wall components. Together with the glycerol generated turgor, these products
  can help the fungus to penetrate the cuticle and colonize in the host cells.
