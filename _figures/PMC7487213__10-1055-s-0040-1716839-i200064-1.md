caption: Schematic representation of the potential role of FXI and FXII in the thrombotic
  and inflammation complications induced by SARsS-CoV-2 infection. The antithrombotic
  and anti-inflammatory capacity of the inhibition of contact pathway and FXI and
  FXII deficiency could be a therapeutic option in this disease with low risk of bleeding.
  Whether SARS-CoV-2 infection could produce antiphospholipid antibodies able to cause
  an acquired FXI deficiency with protective role remains to be clarified. F, factor;
  SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2.
