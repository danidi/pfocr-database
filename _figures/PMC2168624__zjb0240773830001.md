caption: MEP pathway. The reaction catalyzed by CDP-ME synthase (IspD) is highlighted.
  In M. tuberculosis, IPP and DMAPP are synthesized through the activities of a cascade
  of enzymes (DXS through IspH). DXS, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase; IspC,
  1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase; IspD, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  synthase; IspE, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase; IspF, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; IspG, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate
  synthase; IspH, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase. Identification
  numbers have been included for M. tuberculosis enzymes for which there is experimental
  evidence of activity.
