caption: Example of disease curation and visualization in Reactome. The normal process
  of glucose export from the liver under fasting conditions (A) is disrupted by mutations
  that block glucose-6-phosphate hydrolysis within the endoplasmic reticulum (B) or
  the transport of glucose 6-phosphate and orthophosphate (Pi) between the endoplasmic
  reticulum and the cytosol (C).
