caption: Catabolic pathways support metabolism during nutrient stress. Under conditions
  of nutrient deprivation and other stresses, tumorigenic mutations also reprogram
  metabolism to support cell survival. In particular, KRas stimulates autophagy and
  macropinocytosis and facilitates fatty acid uptake. Mutations in BRaf also lead
  to enhanced autophagy. p53 promotes NADPH production through the pentose phosphate
  pathway to maintain redox homeostasis. Acetate and branched-chain amino acids serve
  as alternative substrates to support metabolism. Oncogenic drivers are highlighted
  in green, while tumour suppressors are shown in red. Important metabolic enzymes
  are highlighted in blue. Classic cancer metabolic pathways are shown in orange,
  while emerging pathways and activities supporting cell proliferation are shown in
  purple. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; ribose-5P, ribose-5-phosphate;
