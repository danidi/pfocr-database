caption: Dotted line, inhibit; solid line, activate. EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid; DHA,
  docosahexaenoic acid; GPR120, G protein-coupled receptor 120; JNK, JUN NH2-terminal
  kinase; TLR-4, toll-like-receptor 4; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-β; PPARγ, peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor γ; AA, arachidonic acid; PGE2, prostaglandins E2.
  Anti-inflammatory mechanisms of EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA inhibit NF-κB and JNK through
  binding with GPR120. Incorporation of these n-3 PUFA disrupts the translocation
  of TLR-4 into lipid raft, thus inactivates NF-κB pathway. Besides, EPA and DHA interfere
  with the TLR-4 signaling pathway via the downregulation of NADPH oxidase production,
  which results in the inhibition of NF-κB pathway. These fatty acids also activate
  PPARγ and, result in the upregulation of adiponectin and leptin secretion. In addition,
  the intake of EPA and DHA leads to antagonism of n-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid
  (AA).
