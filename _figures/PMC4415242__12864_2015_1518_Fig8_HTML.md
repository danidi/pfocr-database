caption: The three axes of the UPR in Drosophila brains activated by HTorAΔE. HTorAWT
  may not induce activation of the UPR in ER. However, HTorAΔE may induce activation
  of the three axes of the UPR signalling pathway by directly binding to HSC3 or by
  impairing protein trafficking and secretion from the ER that results in ER overload.
  The amounts of transcripts of the IRE1-dependent spliced Xbp1, AFT4, and ATF6 are
  consequently increased and initiate transcriptional up-regulation of ER-stress and
  UPR target genes, including HSC3, Xbp1, components of ERAD, ER chaperone, disulfide
  bond proteins, oxidative stress response proteins, and ATG8b in Drosophila brains.
  Consequently, the HTorAΔE flies showed an increased susceptibility to oxidative
  and ER stress and a prolonged UPR activation compared with the HTorAWT flies.
