caption: A simplified scheme of the correlation between Notch signaling components
  and CDX2 amounts determined in the study with and without inhibition by DCA and
  DAPT. Left, γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT decreases the amounts of Notch1C, inhibits
  Hrt/Hes, increases the amounts of Hath1 and CDX2 and probably leads to goblet cells
  production. Right, inhibition of the pathway by DCA (an unknown mechanism) decreases
  the total amounts of Notch receptors, thereby reducing the amounts of Notch1C, inhibits
  production of Hes/Hrt, increases amounts of Hath1 and CDX2, and may lead to goblet
  cells. An arrow indicates activation and a blocked arrow indicates inhibition. Broken
  arrow, suggested processes.
