caption: Dhurrin and 13R-manoyl oxide biosynthetic pathways and the genetic constructs
  for their expression in Synechocystis. a The precursors tyrosine and geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate are derived from the shikimate and the methylerythritol pathway respectively.
  The final glycosylation step in dhurrin biosynthesis connects the cyanogenic glucoside
  formation with the sugar metabolism. b The genes encoding enzymes of the dhurrin
  and the manoyl oxide biosynthetic pathways, respectively, were arranged in operons,
  under the control of the trc promoter (TRC). The ribosome binding site (RBS) ribo*
  [] is incorporated before the 5′ of each gene, and each operon concludes with the
  rrnB terminator (rrnB T1). Both linear constructs were inserted in the pDF-trc expression
  vector
