caption: Generation and metabolism of H2S. (a) Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent
  enzymes of the transsulfuration pathway, cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine
  γ-lyase (CSE) catalyze H2S production from homocysteine, cystathionine, and cysteine.
  Additionally, the combined activity of cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) and 3-mercaptopyruvate
  sulfurtransferase (3MST) in the cytoplasm and mitochondria can generate H2S. (b)
  Oxidative metabolism of H2S in the mitochondrial matrix is catalyzed by a series
  of enzymes to generate persulfide, sulfite (SO3–), thiosulfate (S2O32—), and sulfate
  (SO42—). The first step is catalyzed by SQR, which forms a protein-bound persulfide
  intermediate and funnels electrons from H2S oxidation directly into the ETC. The
  subsequent action of sulfur dioxygenase, sulfite oxidase and sulfur transferase
  are proposed to convert SQR persulfide into SO3–, SO42–, and S2O32–, respectively.
