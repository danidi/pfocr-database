caption: Drugs that regulate hepatic bile acid and other organic solute uptake, synthesis,
  detoxification and secretion. The figure illustrates their action as nuclear receptor
  ligands that inhibit or stimulate transcription of key transporters and enzymes
  in this pathway. UDCA = ursodeoxycholic acid; Rif = Rifampicin; PB = phenobarbital
