caption: 'Interplay between Wnt signaling and other anti-ageing pathways. In this
  scheme we show the integration and interaction of multiple signaling pathways: the
  first line (top) shows a Wnt ligand, binding Frizzled receptor and activated canonical
  and non-canonical Wnt signaling. The canonical pathway (left) leads to GSK3β inhibition.
  AMPK activation is known to inhibit by GSK3β. The non-canonical pathway (right)
  increases intracellular Ca2+ levels. Nitric oxide (NO), a second messenger, is known
  to directly activate AMPK. AMPK is also activated by Ca2+ through CaMKK2. Therefore,
  AMPK activation by the Wnt pathway represents a hypothetical concept (“theoretical
  model” in transparent gray box). In the second line, AMPK leads to activation of
  Sirt1 (right). Sirt1 de-acetylates PGC-1α, and this transcription factor translocates
  to the nucleus and interacts with PPARγ heterodimerization to enhance the expression
  of mitochondrial biogenesis genes. As well, AMPK inhibits mTOR complex (right) resulting
  in autophagy stimulation. Additionally, we show the established target of several
  compounds (Li+, Metformin, Rapamicin, Resveratrol and Thiazolidinediones) on these
  intricate inter-linking signaling pathways to neuronal energy availability and cellular
  life span. Abbreviations: G, G-protein-coupled receptor; Dvl, Segment polarity protein
  disheveled homolog DVL-1; APC, adenomatous polyposis coli protein; Ca2+, calcium;
  Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ); AMPK, 5'' adenosine monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin, Sirt1, silent mating-type
  information regulator 2 homolog 1; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
  gamma co-activator 1-α; GSK-3β, Glycogen synthase kinase 3; P,PPARα, phosphorylation;
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha; Li+; lithium.'
