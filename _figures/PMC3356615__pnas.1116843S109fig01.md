caption: Model of the putative singlet oxygen signaling events in C. reinhardtii.
  On high light exposure, singlet oxygen (1O2) production in the chloroplast increases,
  stimulating the oxidation of lipids (LH) to form lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) either
  directly or by activating lipoxygenases (LOX). These LOOHs also convert to reactive
  electrophile species (RESs) like α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which as more stable
  intermediates, might be involved in transmitting the signal from the chloroplast
  to the nucleus. As a result, activation of SOR1 might induce the expression of oxidative
  stress and detoxification genes, including GSTS1, involving the function of ERE
  in their promoters. In contrast, modification of other targets (X) by singlet oxygen
  might lead to the stimulated expression of more specific singlet oxygen response
  genes like GPXH through an alternative signaling pathway (Y).
