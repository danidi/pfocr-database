caption: A) The proposed polyribitol-phosphate WTA biosynthetic pathway. The S. aureus
  NCTC8325 gene encoding each putative protein is shown by its locus tag number in
  the block arrow next to the enzyme name. B) The revised polyribitol-phosphate WTA
  pathway in S. aureus based on in vitro reconstitution. R=undecaprenyl (1a-5a) for
  the natural lipid carrier or farnesyl (1b-5b) for the alternative lipid used in
  the in vitro experiments. Differences between the proposed and reconstituted pathways
  are highlighted by larger bold text.
