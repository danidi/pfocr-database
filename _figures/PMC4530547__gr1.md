caption: 'Overview of cholangiocyte role in biliary functions. (A) Intrahepatic bile
  ducts are lined by both large and small cholangiocytes. Under physiologic conditions,
  cholangiocytes (large cholangiocytes preferentially) modify ductal bile by a sequence
  of secretory and absorptive processes mediated by membrane exchangers. This modification
  mainly leads to the formation of bicarbonate rich bile. Cholangiocytes also secrete
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF), which are
  regulated by microRNA 125b and let-7a, respectively. (B) The formation of bicarbonate
  rich bile is enhanced by stimulation with secretin and adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate
  (cAMP), which increase in response to liver insult. The liver behaves as a neuroendocrine
  compartment in response to injury and starts to respond to hormones and peptides
  in an autocrine as well as paracrine manner. Liver injury is subsequently followed
  by large cholangiocyte proliferation under the influence of these factors (neurotransmitters,
  gastrointestinal peptides, steroids). The large, but not the small, bile ducts express
  secretin receptor (SR) and somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) and respond to secretin
  and somatostatin. Biliary hyperplasia results in cholestasis, which further results
  in human biliary disorders such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and primary
  biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Occasionally, in response to specific events injury or
  drug administration, small cholangiocytes proliferate by a d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate
  (IP3)-mediated signaling pathway, often to compensate for the lack of large cholangiocyte
  proliferation and thus maintain the biliary mass. Bottom: Isolation of small (right),
  approximately 9-μm diameter, and large (left), approximately 13-μm diameter, cholangiocytes
  from human SV-40 transformed cholangiocytes (H69 cells). Small and large human cholangiocytes
  were purified by counterflow elutriation followed by immunoaffinity purification.
