caption: ER stress leads to several redundant pathways for caspase activation that
  involve mitochondrial- dependent and independent pathways. Activated IRE1 recruits
  TRAF2 to elicit JNK phosphorylation and activation. Caspase 12 is a murine ER-associated
  proximal effector in the caspase activation cascade that activates procaspase 9
  to cleave procaspase 3, the primary executioner of cell death. A second cell death
  signaling pathway activated by ER stress is mediated by transcriptional induction
  of genes encoding proapoptotic functions. Activation of PERK, ATF6 and possibly
  IRE1 lead to transcriptional induction of CHOP that induces apoptosis possibly through
  up-regulatng expression of the genes Gadd34, Dr5 and Trb3 or by inhibiting expression
  of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2. Mitochondrial ROS can be generated as a result
  of ER stress-induced Ca+2 release and depolarization of the inner mitochondrial
  membrane. Thus, oxidative stress in association of unresolved ER stress contributes
  to multiple pathways of cell death.
