caption: 'A. A highly active crosstalk process between certain metabotypic features,
  elite metabolites (e.g., oncometabolites), and epigenetics could allow the causal
  integration of the metabolism with genetic programs to generate CSC functions via
  pathological nuclear reprogramming [, ]. The acquisition of stemness in cancer tissues
  might not only be hard-wired by the mutational landscape but also by the pivotal
  regulatory role of the cellular metabotype. This relationship, in turn, can remove,
  diminish, or modify the nature of the molecular barriers present in Waddington''s
  epigenetic landscapes, thus allowing cells to more easily (re-)enter into CSC cellular
  macrostates. In this metabostemness framework, even modest changes in the “protected”
  versus “permissive” nature of the cellular metabotype are expected to produce a
  considerable change in the global kinetic efficiency of the CSC reprogramming process.
  The cellular metabotype can be described by means of variability criteria, such
  as the presence or absence of particular metabolites (e.g., oncometabolites such
  as 2HG), the concentration levels of certain metabolites, the relative levels or
  ratios between specific metabolites, metabolic profiles or even spatio-temporal
  flux distributions of metabolites (e.g., N-acetylglucosamine [GlcNAc] for histone
  GlcNAcylation, the NAD+/NADH ratio for sirtuin histone deacetylase activities, acetyl-CoA
  as a donor for histone acetylation, alpha-ketoglutarate as a cofactor for histone
  and DNA demethylation reactions, S-adenosylmethionine [SAM] as a donor for DNA methylation,
  or ATP/AMP-regulated chromatin translocation of AMPK for histone phosphorylation).
  B. The cellular metabotype may act as “starter dough” that renders any type of cell-of-origin
  susceptible to the epigenetic rewiring required for the acquisition of refractoriness
  to differentiation []. This modification can significantly alter the efficiency
  and speed of CSC reprogramming in cancers with (top) and without (bottom) a stem
  cell origin by lowering the barriers of the epigenetic landscape and increasing
  the size of the basins of attraction, which are necessarily located in the developmentally
  immature, stem-like regions of the “higher mountains” of the landscape. From a therapeutic
  perspective, small perturbations in a particular metabolic pathway or metabolite
  might have drastic consequences on the formation, maintenance, and evolution of
  CSC cellular states. Indeed, the unexpected applications for biguanides in oncology
  might closely relate to their metabolic effects during the induction of CSCs [-].
