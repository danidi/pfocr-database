caption: 'Role of cGMP-dependent signaling and potential for cGMP-modulation therapies
  in SCD. Nitric oxide (NO) is generated from the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline
  by nitric oxide synthases (NOS), particularly endothelial NOS (eNOS). Once diffused
  across the endothelium, NO binds to the heme moiety of soluble guanylate cyclase
  (sGC) in smooth muscle cells and other cell types, promoting the conversion of guanosine
  triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which in turn activates
  cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG). The cascade of reactions triggered by this
  pathway plays a pivotal role in vascular homeostasis. Calcium removal from smooth
  muscle cells promotes relaxation of blood vessels and increases the blood flow.
  Besides promoting vasodilation, the cGMP-signaling pathway inhibits platelet activation
  and aggregation, endothelial activation, and adhesion molecule expression, decreasing
  adhesive interactions between platelets, erythrocytes, leukocytes and the endothelium.
  Additionally, sGC activation upregulates the expression of the gene encoding γ-globin
  (HBG) in erythroid cells, increasing fetal hemoglobin (HbF) levels in the erythrocytes
  and preventing HbS polymerization and hemolysis in sickle cell diseases (SCD). Since
  NO bioavailability is decreased in SCD due to hemolysis, NO inhalation, nitrite
  administration, or hydroxyurea are therapies that directly restore intravascular
  NO levels in varying efficacies, while supplementation with L-arginine provides
  the substrate for NO synthesis. sGC stimulators (heme-dependent) and activators
  (heme-independent) are a class of drugs that modulate sGC activity independently
  of NO. sGC activators increase the activity of sGC only in its oxidized Fe3+heme
  or heme-free (apo) state and are particularly efficient for activating sGC under
  oxidative stress conditions. Additionally, the inhibition of phosphodiesterases
  (PDEs), a group of enzymes that regulate cGMP by catalyzing its hydrolysis and degradation,
  has been investigated as therapy for SCD. Sildenafil is a selective inhibitor of
  PDE5, expressed in smooth muscle cells, platelets and corpus cavernosum, whereas
  IMR-687, BAY 73–6691 and PF04447943 inhibit PDE9, an isoform highly expressed in
  hematopoietic cells. HbS: hemoglobin S; VCAM: vascular cell adhesion molecule-1;
  ICAM: intercellular adhesion molecule-1. (A color version of this figure is available
  in the online journal.)'
