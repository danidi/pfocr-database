caption: 'Schematic representation of the main enzyme pathways involved in mitochondrial
  pyrimidine dNTPs metabolism. Proteins involved in the de novo synthesis pathway
  are depicted in blue. Kinases involved in the deoxynucleoside salvage pathway are
  depicted in red. Enzymes participating in catabolism of dNs are depicted in purple.
  Nucleoside transporters from cytosol to mitochondria are represented in green. Abbreviations:
  CDA, cytidine deaminase; cdN, cytosolic deoxyribonucleotidase; dCTD, dCMP deaminase;
  dCK, deoxycytidine kinase; ENT1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1; mdN, mitochondrial
  deoxyribonucleotidase; NDPK, nucleotide diphosphate kinase; NMPK, nucleotide monophosphate
  kinase; TK1, thymidine kinase 1; TK2, thymidine kinase 2; TP, thymidine phosphorylase;
  TS, thymidylate synthase; RNR, ribonucleotide reductase. (For interpretation of
  the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web
  version of this article.)'
