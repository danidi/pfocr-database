caption: Proposed pathways for salicylic acid biosynthesis and signaling in ozone-exposed
  plants. There are two pathways for salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis in plants. Arabidopsis
  mutant sid2, that have a defect in ICS, does not accumulate salicylic acid (SA)
  in response to ozone, implying that SA is synthesized from isochorismate pathway
  (down from Chorismate) in Arabidopsis. However, another evidences support synthesis
  of SA from phenylalanine (PAL) pathway (right from Chorismate) in plants except
  for Arabidopsis. Final product (SA) of this pathway inhibits ICS expression and/or
  ICS activity. NPR; nonexpressor of PR-1.
