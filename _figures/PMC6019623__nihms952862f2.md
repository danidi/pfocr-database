caption: FLS and monocyte derived macrophages are heavily reliant upon glucose metabolism
  and regulate glucose transporter member 1 (Glut1) in response to inflammatory and
  stress stimuli. This fuels adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in conditions
  of high energetic demand. Glucose is utilized in the pentose phosphate pathway to
  synthesize building blocks for nucleic acids, and to generate NADPH to control redox
  status and support lipid synthesis. Alternatively glucose is metabolized via glycolysis
  to pyruvate which is either transported into the mitochondria to contribute to tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle flux or is converted to lactate in the cytoplasm and removed from
  the cell via monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4). TCA cycle flux contributes to
  ATP production via oxidative and substrate level phosphorylation. When matrix citrate
  levels rise, citrate is transported to the cytoplasm and yields acetyl-CoA, the
  starting material for synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol and lipids. Some such
  lipids are exported from the cell as bioactive metabolites such as sphingosine 1
  phosphate (S1P), free fatty acids (FFA), phospholipids and eicosanoids. Acetyl-CoA
  as well as succinate generated from the TCA cycle can be utilized in production
  chromatin modifying enzymes (CME) and cofactors. Choline is taken up via choline
  transporter-like (CTL) 1/2 is an important substrate in FLS biology. Choline can
  be converted to betaine which is used in production CME and cofactors or converted
  to glycine for use in protein synthesis. Alternatively, choline is phosphorylated
  to phosphocholine and utilized in membrane phospholipid and bioactive lipid synthesis.
  A number of signalling molecules have been identified which control the described
  metabolic pathways but have sparsely been explored in FLS. AKT, protein kinase B;
  AMPK, 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; Myc, Myc proto-oncogene protein; p53, cellular
  tumor antigen p53; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate;
  S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding protein;
  mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB pathway; uPFK, 2phosphofructokinase 2.
