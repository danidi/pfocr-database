caption: Proposed extracellular ATP involvement in corneal epithelial wound healing
  that summarizes the pathway from ATP release caused by cell injury to wound closure,
  including P2Y activation, intracellular Ca2+ release and EGFR signaling. Wounding
  results in the release of ATP from damaged cells, and the released ATP –through
  its P2 receptors – triggers intracellular Ca2+ waves leading to activation of ADAM
  protein(s) in a neighboring cell that is not injured (△). ADAM protein(s) cleaves
  pro-HB-EGF at the cell surface and HB-EGF in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion
  binds EGFR, which transduces the signals into the intracellular signaling network.
  After EGFR activation, HCE cell migration, proliferation and wound healing are induced
  via PI3K, ERK and other intracellular signaling pathways.
