caption: Temporal changes in the transcriptome related to the central metabolic pathway
  in a synchronized C. merolae culture. Cells were cultured in an inorganic photoautotrophic
  medium and subjected to an LD cycle. The transcriptome was examined by microarray
  analysis at the indicated time points (the onset of the second light period was
  defined as h 0). The respective amounts of mRNA relative to the total amount of
  mRNA were determined through quantile normalization. Microarray data representative
  of all the genes and certain selected genes are shown in . The results of two independent
  replicate cultures (Rep. 1 and Rep. 2; cultured at different times) are shown. Relative
  mRNA levels (y axis) at the indicated time points (x axis) are shown. The average
  concentration from h 0 to h 20 was normalized as 1.0 for the respective mRNAs. The
  determinations of the subcellular localization of the enzymes were based on previous
  analyses (). The red and blue arrows indicate that mRNA was upregulated ([sum of
  the levels measured at h 16 and h 20/sum of the levels measured at h 4 and h 8]
  > 2.5) and downregulated ([sum of the levels measured at h 16 and h 20/sum of the
  levels measured at h 4 and h 8] < 0.4) during the night, respectively. The gray
  arrow indicates that the magnitude of change in the mRNA level was lower than that
  determined as described above.
