caption: '(a) Cartoon of the signaling pathway with both transmembrane units in a
  lipid bilayer. (I) The general concept shows the designed release of thiopyridine
  from the precursor 12. (II) Docking of the primary messenger followed by the induced
  SN2‐type displacement of thiopyridine results in disulfide‐bridged TM unit 13. (b)
  External reduction of oppositely orientated disulfide 11 by a water‐soluble phoshine.
  (c) Background‐, signal‐, and reduction‐dependence on the composition of the lipid.
  (d) Key experiments in which both TM units are embedded in the mixed DMPC/DPPC vesicles:
  the double absorption increase is a result of the consecutive addition of the primary
  messenger and the reducing agent. (e) Messenger‐filled liposomes are exposed to
  ninhydrin (no messenger penetration for 45 min) and to Triton X (lysis of the vesicle).
  (f) Conceivable inter‐vesicle reaction by DET crosslink.'
