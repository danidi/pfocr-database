caption: Manipulations in the serotonin synthesis pathway. Serotonin (5-HT) synthesis
  takes place within neurons in the brain and cells in the periphery. Tryptophan (Trp)
  is the amino acid precursor of 5-HT, which is transported by the large amino acid
  transporter (LAT) over the blood–brain barrier. Within the neuron, Trp is hydroxylated
  by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis pathway,
  to 5-HTP. In turn, 5-HTP is decarboxylated to 5-HT by AADC. 5-HT is transported
  into vesicles by the vesicular monoamine transporter. When these vesicles fuse with
  the synaptic membrane, 5-HT is released in the synaptic cleft and can be taken up
  by the serotonin transporter. Finally, 5-HT is metabolized to 5-HIAA by monoamine
  oxidase and transported out of the brain. [11C]5-HTP follows the same pathway as
  endogenous 5-HTP. Different treatments can be used to manipulate different aspects
  of the 5-HT synthesis pathway. In this study, we used a Trp low diet (Trp−diet)
  to deplete rats from the 5-HT precursor. Carbidopa was used to inhibit peripheral
  AADC, and NSD 1015 was used to inhibit both peripheral and central AADC. Para-chlorophenylalanine
  (PCPA) was used to inhibit TPH. The different kinetic modeling rates are represented
  in purple. Adjusted from Visser et al.
