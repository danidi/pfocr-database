caption: Role of the citrate pathway in Down syndrome (DS). In the nuclei, peroxisome‐proliferator‐activated
  receptor α (PPAR α) down‐regulates SLC25A20 and carnitine palmitoyl‐transferase
  1 (CPT1) genes blocking mitochondrial β‐oxidation. At the same time, sterol regulatory
  element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) binds to SRE‐responsive elements and activates
  SLC25A1 and ATP‐citrate lyase (ACLY citrate pathway genes. As a consequence, cytosolic
  citrate increases, leading to an increase of ROS, NO and lipid peroxidation levels.
  When ACLY is inhibited by hydroxycitric acid (HCA) or SB‐204990, a partial reduction
  of the oxidative stress is observed.
