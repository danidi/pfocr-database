caption: 'Core sets of metabolic fluxes in the four modes of photosynthesis modeled:
  (A) C3, (B) CAM, (C) CAM cycling, and (D) CAM idling. The width of the arrows represents
  the magnitude of the reaction flux according to the scale on the bottom of the figure
  in μmol m–2 s–1. The photorespiratory pathway is shown in chloroplast for simplicity,
  which in reality spans multiple compartments. Flux from 3-phosphoglycerate to PEP
  was taken as the flux for glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Flux for succinate dehydrogenase
  was taken as the TCA cycle flux. Note that only cyclic mode of the TCA cycle was
  shown. RuBisCO carboxylase flux was taken as the flux through the Calvin-Benson
  cycle.'
