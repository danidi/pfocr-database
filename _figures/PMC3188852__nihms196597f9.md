caption: In the case of the copper-mediated process for the above mentioned cross-coupling
  (), a working mechanistic hypothesis is illustrated in . It is believed that 1,2-cis-cyclohexanediol
  ligated with CuI and solvent in a tetrahedral fashion. The deiodination of the iodide
  ligand by a base and a subsequent oxidative addition to vinyl iodide 24 with copper
  may lead to Cu(III) with a negative charge on the overall complex. Enolate generation
  and subsequent ligand displacement by the enolate would furnish the square planar
  complex (). It is believed that the final step involved reductive elimination to
  provide the desired ketone 25 in the usual fashion. It is important to point out
  that neither 1,2-trans-cyclohexanediol (See ) nor ethylene glycol worked as well
  as the 1,2-cis-cyclohexanediol in this procedure.
