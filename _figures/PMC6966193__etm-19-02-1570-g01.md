caption: S1PC induces the degradation of MyD88 and Pax5 by activating autophagy. S1PC
  directly denatures MyD88 and then induces the formation of protein aggregates by
  the lysine acetylation and ubiquitination. S1PC triggers the degradation of MyD88
  by inducing AMPK-mediated autophagy activation. Consequently, the degradation of
  MyD88 inhibits TLR signaling pathway (left part of diagram). S1PC induces the phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2 and triggers AMPK-induced autophagy activation. Pax5 is phosphorylated
  by ERK1/2 and then is degraded by autophagy. Therefore, the degradation of Pax5
  induces the expression of Xbp1 mRNA and triggered the differentiation of B cells
  into IgA-producing cells (right part of diagram). S1PC, S−1-propenylcysteine; MyD88,
