caption: Role of NaPiII family of sodium–phosphate cotransporters in the intestines
  and in the kidney []. a Intestinal phosphate uptake occurs by active transport via
  sodium–phosphate cotransporters (NaPi-IIb) and is positively regulated (dotted green
  arrow) by active vitamin D. Phosphate is subsequently transported into the circulation
  by an as yet unknown mechanism (represented in the figure as ‘???’). Electrogenic
  balance is accounted for by the sodium–potassium exchanger in the basolateral membrane.
  Additionally, passive phosphate transport takes place through a paracellular pathway,
  which is diffusion-driven and is mostly regulated by dietary phosphate intake. b
  In the kidney, an active transport process takes place that is highly similar to
  that seen in the intestine. Upon free glomerular filtration, phosphate is reabsorbed
  by NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc transporters, with PiT-2 transporters also contributing
  to this process. Phosphate is subsequently transported back into the circulation.
  NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc are negatively regulated by PTH and FGF-23, either directly
  or by enhancing the effect of PTH (dotted red arrow). Reproduced with permission
