caption: 'Parallel visual pathways in humans. There are two major parallel streams:
  ventral and dorsal pathways in humans. Detailed functions of the two streams are
  provided in the text (see section Neural Basis of OF Perception in Healthy Humans).
  A recent study has revealed the importance of interconnection between IPL and SPL
  for OF processing () so that we modified this figure considering this point. d-d
