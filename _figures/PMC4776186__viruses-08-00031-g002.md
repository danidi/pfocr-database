number: Figure 2
caption: HTLV-1 Cell-to-Cell Transmission. Shown in the diagram is a host cell (bottom)
  that has anchored itself to a permissive target cell (top) using ICAM-1 and LFA1.
  The HTLV-1 accessory protein p8 has been shown to increase the expression of the
  LFA1 receptors as well as increase the number of cell-cell synapses, which p8 then
  traffics through to increase LFA1 in the target cell. Once ICAM-1 is bound, it triggers
  a signaling cascade that leads to the relocation of the MTOC. Additionally, HTLV-1
  Tax is found bound to Golgi bodies that are attached to the MTOC. This initiates
  a variety of cell signaling cascades. For example, one established pathway increases
  expression of Gem, a protein that increases cell motility and possibly MTOC relocation.
  As HTLV-1 Gag is produced, it is found concentrated at the MTOC. Subsequently, HTLV-1
  Gag is found at the sites of cell-cell contacts where the virus particles bud into
  the viral synapse formed by the cellular adhesion points. Virus particles produced
  can bind receptors for entry into the permissive target cell. The question marks
  along the lines with arrows indicate mechanisms of transport or activation that
  are not well understood.
