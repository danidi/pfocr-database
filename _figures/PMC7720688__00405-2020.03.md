caption: 'Biological mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2
  (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Once the SARS-CoV-2 approaches the cell membrane, basal
  S1 subunit of viral spike glycoprotein binds to a membrane-bound molecule of angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2). As more S1 subunits binds to membrane-bound molecules of ACE2,
  the membrane starts to form an envelope around the virus (an endosome). A cell membrane-bound
  serine protease, TMPRSS2, cleaves the S1 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 from its S2 subunits
  that mediated endosome entry into the cells (endocytosis). Inside the cell, viral
  genetic material is released by either acidification or by proteolysis (cathepsin).
  Viral replication and translation forms a new virion that cleaves out from cells
  by exocytosis. Of note, ACE2-mediated cardiovascular protection is lost following
  endocytosis of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. The endocytosis triggers ADAM-17-mediated
  ectodomain shedding of tissue ACE2 [, ], which through the integrin pathway induces
  pathologic intracellular signalling []. Lack of ACE2 availability increases angiotensin
  II levels that result in detrimental effects due to increased activity of angiotensin-II
  type 1 receptor (AT1R) at the expense of ACE2/angiotensin (Ang) 1–7 driven protective
  pathways []. Viral infection also results in activation of circulatory inflammatory
  cytokines, antibody response and immune cells; these may damage airways epithelia.
