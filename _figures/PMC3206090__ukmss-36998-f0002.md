caption: 'BDNF and NGF levels are reduced in both HD and AD. Presynaptically, Htt,
  APP and Tau influence trafficking mechanisms via interaction with HAP1, kinesin
  and dynein/dynactin, influencing their binding to microtubules. Pro-BDNF and pro-NGF
  are processed by unknown proteases to generate mature BDNF and NGF. Furthermore,
  TrkA and TrkB receptor levels are decreased in AD and HD, respectively. Signalling
  through Trk receptors is reduced, thereby increasing Gsk3ß activity and enhancing
  cell death pathways. Increased p75NTR levels and signalling mediated by pro-BDNF
  and pro-NGF also triggers cell death. Therapeutics examined to date include: Epothilone
  D, BDNF, NGF, glucocorticoids and Lithium. Therapeutic targets are highlighted in
  red; Drugs are highlighted in green.'
