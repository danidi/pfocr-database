caption: Metabolic indicator 1 was designed to intercept a physiological pathway and
  report selectively on the activity of HSDs of the AKR superfamily. In the human
  prostate, AKR1C2 is implicated in the deactivation of potent androgen DHT. Probe
  1 is a competitive substrate with a built-in mechanism for translating a redox chemical
  transformation to a measurable increase in fluorescent emission.
