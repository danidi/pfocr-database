caption: Kinomic profiling of IgA1-secreting cells from healthy control subjects (HC)
  and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients stimulated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) with or
  without the AZD1480 inhibitor. Direct interaction mapping using GeneGo MetaCore
  of phosphopeptides that were significantly inhibited by AZD1480-treated lysate from
  IgA1-secreting cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients
  with IgAN but not those from HCs, after IL-6 stimulation. In addition, a Build a
  Network modeling tool was used to generate likely interactions that link uploaded
  objects (significant phosphopeptides inhibited in the cell lysate from IgAN patients)
  similar to the known pathway models. Pathways representing vascular endothelial
  growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and STAT signaling axes were found and are displayed
  as the networks Signal transduction VEGF, STAT3 signaling (red circles).
