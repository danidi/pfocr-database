caption: Model of Tbx2 function for the EC formation in the AVC. The mTbx2 misexpression
  induces expression of Has2; thereby, driving the synthesis and deposition of HA
  and/or cardiac jelly through the heart. Misexpressed Tbx2 signals also promoted
  expression of Tgfβ2 gene that supports the induction of EMT in the ventricles and
  atria. In the normal heart development, Tbx2 works as one of the important factor
  to induce expansion of ECM and EMT under the Bmp2/4-Smad signaling pathway. Bmp
  signals also directly to the En through the Bmpr1a.
