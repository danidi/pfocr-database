caption: 'Shh+Ptch1− and Shh−Ptch1+ domains are colored by light red and light blue
  respectively. Broken line with triangular arrow indicates the diffusion of Shh.
  Solid line with triangular arrows represent up-regulation while circular arrows
  represent down-regulation. Two pathways of GLI regulating Gata3 may exist: direct
  regulation of Gata3 by Gli1/2 (pathway 1)was based on promoter analysis and indirect
  regulation of Gata3 by GLI through Nkx2.2 as proposed by Craven et al. .'
