caption: 'The ER-to-Golgi vesicular transport system serves as an organizing membrane-rich
  platform allowing the organization of RLR-dependent antiviral innate immunity. TFG
  is involved in optimizing COPII assembly at the ERES and disassembly at the ER/ERGIC
  interface (pink vesicles located between the RER and ERGIC). TFG thereby enables
  an efficient export of proteins from the ER to other organelles. Possibly through
  its ability to self-associate and to generate larger polymers, TFG also allows the
  proper positioning of essential effectors (TRAF3, TBK1) with MAVS onto an interface
  between mitochondria and ER-related membranes where they can functionally interact
  upon viral infection. These signaling events result in the phosphorylation of IRF3,
  its dimerization and nuclear translocation where it rapidly induces the transcription
  of type I IFN genes and a subset of ISGs. TFG also allows the positioning of mTOR
  with TRAF3-TBK1 complexes resulting in mTORC1 signaling pathway activation. The
  translation of a subset of ISGs mRNA is also under the control of mTORC1 pathway,
  which is regulated, at least in part, by TBK1. SER: smooth endoplasmic reticulum,
  RER: rough endoplasmic reticulum. The model was created using Servier Medical Art
