caption: Model for Hsk1 interaction with TLS pathway. The sliding clamp proteins PCNA
  (green) and 9-1-1 (pink) mediate the choice between repair mechanisms. Homologous
  recombination is inhibited by the Srs2 helicase and PCNA sumoylation. Polyubiquitination
  of PCNA by Rhp6/18 and then Mms2/Ubc13/Rad8 drives error free bypass repair. Error
  prone translesion synthesis by minor polymerases occurs in response to PCNA monoubiquitination.
  Hsk1 and Dfp1 appear to operate in this pathway independent of Swi1/3 and Rhp6/18.
