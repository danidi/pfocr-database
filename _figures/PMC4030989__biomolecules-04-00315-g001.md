caption: The sphingolipid pathway and basic structural units of sphingolipid biosynthesis.
  During de novo synthesis of sphingolipids in higher eukaryotes, the sphingoid base
  dihydrosphingosine (a.k.a. sphinganine) is formed by condensation of serine and
  palmitoyl-coenyzme A, catalysed by the serine palmitoyltransferase complex, followed
  by reduction of the resultant 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine. Transfer of a variable
  length fatty acid chain to the free amine group of dihydrosphingosine, a reaction
  catalysed by a family of six ceramide synthases (CERS1-6), forms dihydroceramide.
  Ceramides are subsequently formed by the desaturation of dihydroceramides, catalysed
  by dihydroceramide desaturases (DEGS1 and 2). Ceramides may then be transported
  to the Golgi, where functional headgroups are transferred to the primary hydroxyl,
  producing sphingomyelin, Cer1P, or glycolipids. Distinct sphingomyelinases and ceramidases
  catalyse the catabolism of SM and ceramide in distinct sub-cellular compartments.
  Catabolism of ceramides by ceramidases yields sphingosine, which can be recycled
  for new sphingolipid synthesis, or act as a substrate for phosphorylation by sphingosine
  kinases (SPHK1/2), yielding S1P. Irreversible cleavage of S1P by S1P lyase produces
  ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal, which can be recycled for new lipid biosynthesis.
  For more extensive reviews of sphingolipid metabolism and transport, the reader
  is referred to very comprehensive reviews [,].
