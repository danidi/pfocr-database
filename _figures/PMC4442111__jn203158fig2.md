caption: Pathways to HIV-associated anemia. A complex combination of interdependent
  factors including viral replication, microbial translocation, CD4 cell depletion,
  and chronic immune activation has been proposed as the driving force behind HIV
  disease progression (). The production of proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-6)
  appears to both contribute to and be dependent on factors driving disease progression
  and, in turn, stimulates hepcidin production and triggers the acute phase response.
  As a result, there is an increase in hepcidin-mediated ferroportin degradation and
  a characteristic shift in iron from the bloodstream to the macrophage that is characterized
  by decreased plasma iron, decreased hemoglobin, decreased transferrin, increased
  sTfR, and increased ferritin, ultimately resulting in HIV-associated anemia. Although
  ART is known to resolve some (but not all) HIV-associated anemia, its role in the
  proposed pathway is currently unknown. Alternatively, HIV-associated anemia may
  be the result of nutritional consequences of HIV and/or other (non–HIV-related)
  causes of anemia. Arrows indicate connected entities that are part of a pathway
  whereby solid arrows represent established pathways and dotted arrows remain hypothetical;
  lines ending without arrows indicate inhibition or blockage. ART, antiretroviral
  therapy; sTfR, soluble transferrin receptor.
