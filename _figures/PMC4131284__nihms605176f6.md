caption: In DNA damage-dependent pathway, Chk2 is activated by ATM kinase in response
  to ionizing radiation. Activated CHK2 phosphorylates a number of downstream target
  proteins, which results in the activation of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis.
  CHK2 can constitutively phosphorylate CDK11 and promotes pre-mRNA splicing in a
  DNA damage-independent and ATM-independent manner. During mitosis, CHK2 phosphorylates
  BRCA in absence of DNA damage and contributes chromosomal stability.
