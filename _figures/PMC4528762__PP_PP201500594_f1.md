caption: Pathways for de novo  synthesis and tocopherol biosynthesis in photosynthetic
  organisms. Tocopherol biosynthesis is initiated by the prenylation of homogentisate
  with  catalyzed by HPT.  is synthesized by the reduction of geranylgeranyl either
  in the diphosphate form or as the hydrophobic sidechain of chlorophyll by the activity
  of , and recent evidence has pointed to that at least 80% of  synthesis proceeds
  through the reduction of geranylgeranyl bound to chlorophyll in Arabidopsis (; ).
  This pathway for  synthesis requires an array of enzymes in addition to , including
  chlorophyll synthase to esterify geranylgeranyl to chlorophyll, chlorophyllase to
  release phytol from chlorophyll, and two phytol kinases, including VTE5, to convert
  released phytol to . The esterification of chlorophyllide with  catalyzed by chlorophyll
  synthase is the primary reaction for chlorophyll biosynthesis, and esterification
  of chlorophyllide with  is a secondary reaction for chlorophyll synthesis catalyzed
  by chlorophyll synthase using  derived from chlorophyll degradation. An alternative
  fate for  is condensation with homogentisate for biosynthesis of the tocotrienol
  form of vitamin E (; ). chlorophyllgg, Chlorophyll linked to a geranylgeranyl moiety;
  chlorophyllphy, chlorophyll linked to a phytyl moiety.
