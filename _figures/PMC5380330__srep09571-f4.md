caption: (A) Regulatory network of tumor cytotoxic genes and shared differentially
  expressed miRNAs; (B) Interaction network between tumor cytotoxicity promoting miRNAs
  and components of natural killer cells mediated cytotoxicity pathway; (C) Potential
  impact of tumor cytotoxicity promoting miRNAs in natural killer cells mediated cytotoxicity
  pathway. Components of signaling pathway which were regulated by miRNAs we identified
  were marked in red, and corresponding regulatory miRNAs were listed beside.
