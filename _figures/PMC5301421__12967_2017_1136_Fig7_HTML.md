caption: Metabolic reprograming in dermatomyositis. The scheme highlights the primary
  flux of energy provision pathways in the muscle of normal and DM patients. In normal
  muscle, most of the glucose taken up by the cell is oxidized in mitochondria to
  generate a high yield of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial activity
  also generates a little amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the respiratory
  chain. In contrast, in muscle cells of DM patients glucose is partially oxidized
  in the cytoplasm to generate metabolic intermediates by the blockage imposed on
  the glycolytic pathway by the overexpression of the less active PKM2 isoform. Moreover,
  the overexpression of IF1 in mitochondria also limits cellular ATP availability
  enforcing aerobic glycolysis and enhancing the production of reactive oxygen species
  (ROS). Diversion of the glycolytic flux by blockade of glycolysis and oxidative
  phosphorylation provides the metabolic intermediates that become precursors for
  the biosynthesis of the macromolecules required for cellular proliferation. In addition,
  PKM2 can translocate into the nucleus and activates the transcription of several
  genes involved in cancer development [–]. Likewise, the IF1-mediated inhibition
  of the H+-ATP synthase generates a ROS signal that activates in the nucleus programs
  involved in proliferation, cell death resistance and invasion [–]. Thus, the concurrent
  increase of PKM2 and IF1 expression in the muscle of DM patients leads to metabolic
  rewiring and ROS signaling that are hallmarks of the oncogenic phenotype
