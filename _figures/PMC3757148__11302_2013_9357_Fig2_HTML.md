caption: a Challenging macrophages with PAMPs such as LPS stimulates synthesis of
  pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. Secretion of the active cytokines requires a secondary
  signal that is provided by ATP through P2X7 ligation [–], yielding the conversion
  of pro-IL-1β into active IL-1β by NLRP3 inflammasome activated caspase-1 enzymatic
  cleavage []. The activation process of caspase-1 is initiated via P2X7-mediated
  cytosolic K+ outflow [, ], or alternatively via the activation of ROS [, , ]. Also
  the pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 can be released via a distinct caspase-1 independent
  pathway which is blocked by glycine []. Prolonged stimulation with ATP also leads
  to caspase-1 dependent, but IL-1β and IL-18 cytokine processing independent cell
  death in macrophages [, , ]. b P2X7 receptor activation has also been shown to signal
  caspase-1 and IL-1β/IL-18 independent release of cathepsins [, ], PGE2 [], phosphatidylserine
  [], and MMP-9 [], all of which are implicated in cellular processes that play a
  defined role in inflammation. ATP is also reported to act as a long-range “find
  me” signal (chemoattractant) to recruit monocytes and macrophages []. c The role
  of ATP as “real” direct chemoattractant for macrophages is however controversial;
  the purinergic system can also act as an indirect chemoattractant that navigates
  macrophages in a gradient of the “real” chemoattractant C5a via autocrine release
  of ATP induced by the C5a receptor (C5aR), yielding an amplification in the gradient
  sensing via an orientated generation of lamellipodial membrane protrusions involving
  P2Y2 and P2Y12 receptors to furthermore induce an indirect effect of chemotaxis
  and the promotion of phagocytosis [, ]. Enhanced phagocytic effect in macrophages
  by purinergic stimuli can also involve the ligation of P2X1 or P2X3 receptors [].
