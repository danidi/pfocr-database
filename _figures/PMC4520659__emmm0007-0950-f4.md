caption: Associations between components of the retinoid signaling pathway and the
  phenotype in breast cancer cell linesThe figure illustrates the associations between
  the indicated retinoid receptors/binding proteins and the Luminal versus Basal phenotype
  (left panels), ER positivity versus ER negativity (middle panels) as well as HER2
  positivity versus HER2 negativity (right panels). The gene-expression microarray
  and RNA-seq data refer to 42 and 40 breast cancer cell lines, respectively. The
  P-values of the indicated comparisons after Student's t-test are shown in red. L
  (red) = Luminal cell lines; B (blue) = Basal cell lines; ER+ (red) = ER-positive
  cell lines; ER− (red) = ER-negative cell lines; ER− (blue) = ER-negative Luminal
  cell lines; H+ (red) = HER2-positive cell lines; H− (red) = HER2-negative cell lines;
  H+ (blue) = HER2-positive Luminal cell lines; H− (blue) = HER2-negative Luminal
  cell lines. fpkm = fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped.
