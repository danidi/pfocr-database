caption: MTG16, and other MTG family members, may play a role in the constitutive
  repression of both Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. (a) Cell surface activation
  of Frizzled-family receptors attenuates the constitutive phosphorylation and degradation
  of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. An increase in β-catenin concentration and translocation
  to the nucleus convert TCF-family TFs to activators of transcription at Wnt target
  genes. MTG family members were shown to bind Tcf4 in vitro, and the association
  was abrogated in the presence of β-catenin, lending credence to the idea that MTG
  family members represent one of the many corepressors employed by TCF TFs in basal,
  inactivated states. The specific contribution of MTG16 to this pathway is controversial,
  and the most recent research suggests that MTGR1 carries most of the Wnt-modulatory
  roles in the MTG family. (b) MTG16 also interacts strongly with the intracellular
  domains of all four mammalian Notch receptors (N-ICD). Similar to Wnt signaling,
  Notch activation induces proteolytic cleavage of the intracellular portion of the
  receptor and translocation to the nucleus. It then converts the CSL repressor into
  an activator. MTG16 interacts with CSL but is displaced by N-ICD. N-ICD also directly
  binds MTG16, likely inducing a conformational change that inhibits MTG16:CSL interaction.
  Engel et al. [] demonstrated a role of endogenous MTG16 in Notch-directed T-cell
  differentiation from HSPCs.
