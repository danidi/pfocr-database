caption: JAK/STAT pathway at a glance. (A) Cytokines interact with their corresponding
  receptor, which, after oligomerization, activates JAK and initiates JAK-mediated
  phosphorylation of its own cytoplasmic domain. Receptor phosphorylation causes STAT
  binding in close proximity to JAK that in turn mediates tyrosine-phosphorylation
  (p-Tyr) of the latter. STAT phosphorylation results in dimerization, nuclear translocation,
  DNA binding, and modulation of gene transcription. (I) All STAT can bind to interferon-γ
  (IFN-γ)-activated sequence (GAS) DNA motifs while (II) only STAT2 after forming
  a trimeric complex of STAT1–STAT2–IRF9 engages Interferon-stimulated Response Element
  (ISRE) DNA binding. (B) Four domains of JAK facilitate interaction with upstream
  receptors and promotion of kinase function (FERM domain), interaction with upstream
  receptors (SH2-like domain), control of kinase activity (pseudokinase domain), and
  trans-activation and tyrosine-phosphorylation of receptors, JAKs and STATs (kinase
  domain). The seven domains of STAT facilitate protein-protein interactions (N-terminal
  domain), protein–protein interactions and nuclear-localization (coiled-coil domain),
  nuclear import, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity (DNA-binding domain),
  structural organization and transcriptional activity (linker domain), dimerization
  and interaction with upstream receptors (SH2 domain), canonical signaling (transactivation
  domain), canonical and non-canonical functions (C-terminal domain).
