caption: Potential mechanism for HKa-induced endothelial apoptosis and inhibition
  of angiogenesis. We speculate that HKa interrupts integrin-dependent signaling needed
  for maintenance of endothelial cell viability; although HKa antiangiogenic receptor
  has not been defined, our studies demonstrate that it is not uPAR. We propose that
  through binding to integrin or integrin-associated protein, HKa alters integrin
  structure, leading to conformational change in integrin cytoplasmic domain. Focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK) associates with integrin cytoplasmic tail, binds Csk and p56/Lck,
  and may function as scaffold to enhance interaction between these 2 SFKs in nonperturbed
  state, leading to inactivation of p56/Lck by Csk-mediated phosphorylation of p56/Lck
  Y416. After HKa binding, association of FAK with integrin may change, leading to
  Csk dissociation and degradation, possibly by ubiquitination. In turn, p56/Lck undergoes
  dephosphorylation on Y505 and phosphorylation on Y394, becoming activated and able
  to phosphorylate p53 and stimulate expression of Bax and Bak. Bax and Bak induce
  mitochondrial depolarization, release of cytochrome c, and mitochondrial pathway
  of apoptosis.
