caption: Schematic showing the signaling pathway of miR-125a-3p- Fyn–NRP1 interaction
  by TNF-α in DPSCs. As the rickets progress, the inflammatory stimuli increase, the
  expression of miR-125a-3p decreases, the expression of Fyn increases, and the interaction
  between NRP1 and FYN is promoted, resulting in the original differentiation-promoting
  effect being masked. Instead, NRP1-FYN is formed. Complex, interaction promotes
  downstream NF-κB signaling activation, further enlarges inflammatory response, inhibits
  dentin differentiation of DPSCs
