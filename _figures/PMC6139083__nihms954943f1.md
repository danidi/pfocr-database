caption: The endosteal bone surface is the principal component of the hematopoietic
  niche, and plays an influential role in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation
  and interaction with osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
  Osteoblasts and MSCs are closely coupled to HSC proliferation. Knockout of MSC severely
  impairs the maintenance of HSC progenitors and their ability to home to the bone
  marrow, further highlighting the critical role that MSCs play in HSC differentiation.
  Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway, targeted by most cancer treatment regimens,
  play a critical role in MSC differentiation. Hormones and transcription factors
  such as Pref 1, growth hormone, leptin, and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor
  γ (PPAR- γ) can influence MSC differentiation into either osteoblasts or adipocytes.
  Osteoclasts are multinucleated giant cells that arise from hematopoietic cells and
  are predominantly responsible for bone resorption. In addition to bone remodeling,
  osteoclasts are also involved in HSC mobilization within the bone marrow milieu
  through enzymatically cleaving soluable stromal-cell derived factor 1 or CXCL12.
  The receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) plays a critical role in osteoclast
  formation, and the biological activity of RANKL is moderated by osteoprogerin (OPG),
  a physiological decoy receptor. Thus, a competitive balance between osteoblasts
  and osteoclasts is necessary for the regulation of HSC in the bone marrow milieu.
