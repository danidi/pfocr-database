caption: Schematic model for the contribution of Them2 to hepatic insulin resistance
  due to GPAT1 overexpression. FFA are taken up from the plasma, produced by de novo
  lipogenesis, or released by lipolysis. These are converted to fatty acyl-CoAs by
  various ACSs within the hepatocyte. At the mitochondrial membrane, a fraction of
  acyl-CoA thioesters is hydrolyzed into FFA by the action of Them2. These FFA become
  substrates for the mitochondria-associated ACSL1, producing newly synthesized fatty
  acyl-CoAs that are available for fatty acid oxidation within the mitochondria upon
  CPT1-mediated uptake. Alternatively, acyl-CoAs may enter the glycerolipid synthetic
  pathways, which is determined by the activity of GPAT1. Following GPAT1 overexpression,
  as portrayed by red type, Them2 preferentially traffics a fraction of saturated
  FFA molecules derived from plasma into the glycerolipid synthetic pathway (red arrows),
  leading to the relative enrichment of DAG containing saturated fatty acids, which
  promote insulin resistance. Because hepatic steatosis is observed even in the absence
  of Them2, the majority of the fatty acid flux into the glycerolipid pathway occurs
  through a distinct metabolic pathway. LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein.
