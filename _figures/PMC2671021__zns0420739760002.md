caption: A, Potential mechanism of action of Aβ*56 at neuronal surface. Monomeric
  forms of Aβ assemble into progressively larger oligomers, and these are detected
  in both intracellular endosomes and the extracellular space. One of the larger oligomers
  (Aβ*56) has been shown to disrupt learning in healthy rats. It is thought to disrupt
  synaptic NMDA and AMPA receptor trafficking. B, Recent work suggests that Aβ may
  act as part of a negative feedback signaling pathway. Enhanced synaptic activity
  leads to increased APP processing to Aβ, which leads to synaptic AMPA receptor endocytosis
  and reduced synaptic activity. LMW, Low molecular weight; HMW, high molecular weight;
  α7nAChR, α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; AMPAR, AMPA receptor; NMDAR, NMDA
  receptor; mGluR, metabotropic glutamate receptor.
