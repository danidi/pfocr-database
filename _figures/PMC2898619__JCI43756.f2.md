caption: A subpopulation of non-nuclear ERs localize to EC plasma membrane invaginations
  called caveolae by direct binding to caveolar proteins, including the scaffold protein
  striatin, which is bound to the major caveolar structural protein, caveolin-1 (Cav-1).
  Upon estrogen binding, signaling complexes assemble that include ERs and the G protein
  Gαi and sequentially activate the tyrosine kinase src, the serine/threonine kinase
  PI3K that produces phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), and the kinase
  Akt. Akt then directly phosphorylates eNOS on serine 1,177, leading to its enzymatic
  activation and production of NO. Whether the ERs are apposed to the inner leaflet
  of the plasma membrane, or are somehow localized on the external face of the membrane,
  remains unclear. In the current issue of the JCI, Chambliss and coworkers demonstrate
  that in vivo activation of this non-nuclear ER-dependent pathway by EDC confers
  protection against vascular injury in the mouse ().
