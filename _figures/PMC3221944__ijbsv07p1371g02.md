caption: JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Cytokine binds with the target receptor; this
  causes dimerization of receptor chains and the juxtaposition of JAKs, and their
  reciprocal phosphorylation. Once activated, JAKs phosphorylate the intra-cytoplasmic
  regions of the cytokine receptor; creating a docking site for cytoplasmatic STATs
  that once joined with the receptor are activated by JAK phosphorylation in a tyrosine
  residue. STATs dimers act as transcriptional factors recognizing specific DNA sequences.
