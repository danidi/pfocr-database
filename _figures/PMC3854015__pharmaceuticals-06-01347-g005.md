caption: Effect of the SNP variant (Q141K) on the protein expression level and degradation
  of ABCG2. (A) The ABCG2 wild type (WT) protein has glutamine residue at amino acid
  position 141. To assess the effect of Q141K variant on the protein expression level,
  Flp-In-293 cells expressing WT and the Q141K variant were incubated in the absence
  or presence of MG132 (2 μM) for 24 h. ABCG2 WT and Q141 variant proteins were analyzed
  by immunoblotting with the ABCG2-specific monoclonal antibody (BXP-21) after PNGase
  F treatment. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) protein level
  was analyzed by GAPDH-specific antibody. The signal intensity ratio (ABCG2/GAPDH)
  was normalized to the control level. Data are expressed as means ± S.D. in triplicate
  experiments []. (B) Correctly processed ABCG2 WT protein is destined to reach the
  plasma membrane and is then degraded by the endosome-lysosome pathway after remaining
  in the plasma membrane domain for a certain period. In contrast, the ABCG2 Q141K
  variant protein is recognized as a misfolded form and then undergoes ubiquitination-mediated
  proteasomal degradation. Bafilomycin A1 (BMA) and MG132 inhibit lysosomal and proteasomal
  degradation, respectively.
