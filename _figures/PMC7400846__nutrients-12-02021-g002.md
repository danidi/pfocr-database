caption: Cholesterol and bile acid biosynthesis. (A) In conditions of cholesterol
  depletion, the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2)–SREBP cleavage
  activating protein (SCAP) complex in the ER is transported to the Golgi apparatus
  where it is sequentially cleaved by site 1 protease (SP1) and SP2 at different sites
  to become active. Active nuclear (n)SREBP2 enters into the nucleus and binds to
  sterol regulatory element (SRE) sequences of target genes to induce the expression
  of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis such as the rate-limiting cholesterol
  synthesis enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR). De
  novo synthetized cholesterol is stored or assembled in very low density lipoproteins
  (VLDL) in the Golgi apparatus for secretion into the circulation. (B) When ER membrane
  cholesterol exceeds 5% mol of the total lipids, sterol-sensing domains (SSD) in
  SCAP undergo a conformational change and the complex binds to insulin-induced gene
  1 (INSIG1) or INSIG2, remaining inactive. Meanwhile, HMG-CoAR also binds to INSIG1
  or INSIG2 for ubiquitilation and degradation, or it is inactivated by phosphorylation.
  (C) Cholesterol enters into the hepatocyte by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor
  (LDLr) or through scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRBI) by the delivery of high-density
  lipoprotein (HDL) reverse cholesterol transport. In the liver, it is stored as cholesterol
  ester after being esterified by acetyl coenzyme A (Ac-CoA) acetyltransferase 2 (ACAT2).
  It can also be used to synthetize bile acids in the biosynthetic metabolic pathway
  with the cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (CYP7A1) enzyme as a rate-limiting
  factor. Bile acids will be secreted into the gallbladder as bile salts by adenosine
  triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 11 (ABCB11) transporter. Cholesterol
  excess is also effluxed by adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter G5/G8
  (ABCG5/G8) into the gallbladder for secretion into the intestine.
