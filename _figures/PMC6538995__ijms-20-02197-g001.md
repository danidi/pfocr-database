caption: A schematic overview of the cell-clearing systems, with a focus on the interplay
  between autophagy and proteasome. The cartoon offers a rough schematization of the
  autophagy pathway, starting from the phagophore biogenesis staining for LC3 and
  Beclin1, which engulfs cytoplasmic portions containing insoluble aggregates, ubiquitinated
  substrates, and damaged organelles. The phagophore membrane seals to from the autophagosome,
  which then fuses with the late endosomes to generate the amphisome. This latter
  fuses with lysosomes to generate the autophagosome (staining for LC3, Beclin1, Rab24,
  VPS34, and p62) where cargo degradation occurs. At the same time, ubiquitinated
  substrates can be degraded by the 26S ubiquitin proteasome (UPS), which is formed
  by the regulatory subunits 19s and the catalytic subunits 20s. Signals such as p62
  contribute to sort ubiquitinated proteins for either UPS or autophagy degradation.
  At the same time, p62 may serve as a signal to promote the merging of UPS and autophagy
  into a single organelle, “autophagoproteasome”, where potentiated cell-clearance
  may take place. Alternatively, the autophagy-dependent degradation of inactive UPS
  subunits may occur within this compartment, a phenomenon that is named “proteophagy”.
  Dotted arrows indicate the formation of insoluble aggregates from misfolded proteins
  and their ubiquitination (red), the shuttling of substrates to the phagophore (blue),
  and the fusion of endosomes and lysosomes with autophagy vacuoles (blue). Solid
  blue arrows indicate the progression of the autophagy machinery, the shuttling of
  ubiquitinated substrates to the UPS, and the shuttling of the UPS within autophagosomes.
