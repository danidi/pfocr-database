caption: Proposed signaling pathway leading to sporulation. AcbA is released from
  prespore cells and proteolytically cleaved by TagC on prestalk cells to generate
  the SDF-2 peptide. SDF-2 binds to the histidine kinase receptor DhkA present on
  the surface of both prespore and prestalk cells and inhibits phosphorelay via RdeA
  to the cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA. The activity of RegA is reduced when its response
  regulator region is not phosphorylated, leading to an increased accumulation of
  cAMP generated by the late adenylyl cyclase ACR. Encapsulation is triggered by the
  resulting increase in PKA activity (, ). A similar pathway in prestalk cells results
  in extracellular TagC activity (, ).
