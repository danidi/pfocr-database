caption: (A) Schematic diagram of the ER stress response. Three sensors on the ER
  membrane, PERK, ATF6, and IRE1, are activated upon ER stress. Activated PERK phosphorylates
  eIF-2α to attenuate global protein translation but selectively enhance ATF4 translation.
  Activated ATF6 is cleaved and translocated to the nucleus, where it upregulates
  ER chaperone expression. Once activated, the endoribonuclease activity of IRE1 mediates
  splicing of Xbp-1, which encodes a transcriptional activator to induce transcription
  of ERAD components. The kinase activity of IRE1 phosphorylates JNK, which can ultimately
  lead to cell death. Viral protein pUL38 activates PERK-dependent ATF4 expression,
  suppresses persistent JNK phosphorylation, and inhibits ER stress-induced cell death.
  Modulation of other components of the ER stress response by HCMV is described in
  the text. (B) Schematic diagram of the mTOR pathway. Growth factors and metabolic
  stresses regulate mTORC1 activation by acting on the TSC1/2 complex. The TSC1/2
  complex functions as a GTPase-activating protein for Rheb, which activates mTORC1
  in its GTP-bound form. Once activated, mTORC1 phosphorylates 4E-BP1 and S6K, two
  well-characterized substrates regulating protein translation. Amino acids activate
  mTORC1 through a parallel pathway independent of TSC1/2 or Rheb. pUL38 binds to
  TSC2 and activates mTORC1. Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 by binding to mTOR as a rapamycin-FKBP12
  complex to interfere with its substrate binding capability. Torin 1 directly inactivates
  mTOR kinase activity by competing with ATP binding.
