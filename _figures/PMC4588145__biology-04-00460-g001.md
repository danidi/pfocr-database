caption: Fish nucleic acid PRR signaling pathways. The cell possesses a number of
  PRRs capable of sensing nucleic acids (DNA, dsRNA, ssRNA), which can be found on
  the cell surface, in endosomes, or the cytosol. On the cell surface, the fish-specific
  TLR22 can sense long extracellular dsRNA molecules and recruit and activate the
  adaptor protein TICAM-1. Surface SR-As bind nucleic acids (such as DNA and dsRNA)
  in the extracellular space and transport these nucleic acids into endosomes. Endosomal
  nucleic acid PRRs include TLR3, which recognizes dsRNA and recruits the adaptor
  protein TICAM-1. TLR7 and TLR8 are also located in the endosome, where they recognize
  ssRNA and recruit the adaptor protein MyD88. Lastly, TLR9 and TLR21, located in
  the endosome, recognize DNA and, like TLR7,8, recruit MyD88 for signaling. With
  respect to cytosolic nucleic acids, LGP2, RIG-I, and MDA5 (collectively referred
  to as RLRs) all recognize viral dsRNA in the cytosol and activate IPS-1 for downstream
  signaling. Endosomal dsRNA can escape (through a yet unknown mechanism), which may
  be recognized by cytosolic RLRs to activate the downstream signalling pathway via
  IPS-1 (indicated by a dashed arrow). Cytosolic DNA, on other hand, is recognized
  by the CDSs. In fish, DDX41 remains the only CDS described thus far. DDX41 activation
  leads to the recruitment and activation of the adaptor protein STING and subsequent
  activation of the kinase TBK1. Whether additional CDSs exist is fish is an area
  of ongoing research. Once the nucleic acid PRRs recognize their specific ligands,
  their associated adaptor proteins signal through a series of intracellular kinases
  (not shown) to phosphorylate one, or a combination of, transcription factors (IRF3,
  7, and NF-κB). Once activated, these transcription factors translocate to the nucleus
  and bind to their corresponding regulatory domains to induce the expression of type
  I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which together trigger antiviral functions
  within the host. CDS = cytosolic DNA sensor; CpG DNA = cytosine-phosphate-guanosine
