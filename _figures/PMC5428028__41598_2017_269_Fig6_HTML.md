caption: A proposed model for the B[a]P-mediated metabolic reprogramming and its role
  in cell fate determination in F258 rat hepatic epithelial cells. B[a]P metabolism,
  via the constitutively expressed CYP1B1, leads to the activation of NHE1 transporter
  and p53 pathway, both triggering apoptotic cell death. Note that AhR activation
  by B[a]P, along with the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production related to CYP
  metabolism, are involved in NHE1 activation via membrane remodeling. Beside promoting
  apoptosis, activation of NHE1 and p53 also appeared to be involved in the B[a]P-elicited
  metabolic reprogramming, thus inducing cell survival. B[a]P would also induce a
  β2-adrenergic receptor-dependent activation of IF1, the physiological inhibitor
  of the F1F0ATPase, which appears to be involved in the related glycolytic shift
  and cell survival. Activation of AhR by B[a]P might be involved in the upregulation
  of IF1 mRNA level, but without any incidence on the mitochondrial IF1 protein level.
  Along with its classical and well described transcription factor activity, a mitochondrial
  fraction of AhR might also participate to the overall metabolic reprogramming.
