caption: Scheme showing the involvement of AtD-LDH in the methylglyoxal pathway and
  of AtD-2HGDH in the respiration of substrates from proteolysis and/or lipid degradation.
  d-Lactate resulting from the glyoxalase system is converted to pyruvate by AtD-LDH.
  The electrons originated may be transferred to the respiratory chain through cytochrome
  c in the intermembrane space. d-2-HG produced in the peroxisomes (as shown in supplemental
  Fig. S3) is transported to the mitochondria and converted to 2-ketoglutarate by
  AtD-2HGDH. Electrons are donated to the electron transport chain through the ETF/ETFQO
  system. Dotted files represent possible transport processes. 2-KG, 2-ketoglutarate.
  CIII, complex III. CIV, complex IV. e−, electron. ETF, electron transfer protein.
  ETFQO, ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase. GSH, glutathione. Pyr, pyruvate. TCA cycle,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle; UQ, ubiquinone.
