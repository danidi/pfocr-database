caption: Hypothetical model of AD pathogenesis from the perspective of the astrocyte-neuron
  interaction. The hypothetical pathway by which Aβ affects both astrocytes and neurons,
  thereby activating GSK3β and leading to tau phosphorylation. Aβ, which is released
  from neurons, may induce astrocytes to release IGFBP-3 by activating calcineurin.
  Aβ may also directly activate GSK-3β, resulting in tau phosphorylation. IGF-1 can
  suppress GSK-3β and prevent tau phosphorylation, whereas IGFBP-3 impedes the protective
  effect of IGF-1
