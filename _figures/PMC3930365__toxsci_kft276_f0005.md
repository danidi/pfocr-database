caption: Top ranked network of genes altered in the newborn lung at 24h post-O3 exposure.
  The gene network was generated with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software using dataset
  of genes significantly altered by at least 1.5-fold (FDR, q < .05). This network
  had the highest enrichment score of 55 and contained 24 identified genes, all down-regulated
  by 24h after O3 exposure. The network is a graphical representation of knowledge-based
  functional relationships between molecules. Molecules are represented as nodes,
  and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a line. All
  relationships are supported by at least one reference from the literature stored
  in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base.
