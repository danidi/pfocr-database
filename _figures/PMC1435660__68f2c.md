caption: TGF-β signaling cascade. TGF-β binds to RII and the resulting complex recruits
  and phosphorylates RI. The receptor complex also contains the auxiliary receptor
  endoglin. Activated RI transmits the signal to the nucleus through the Smad family
  of co-activators. First, RI phosphorylates R-Smads which then associate with Co-Smads,
  namely Smad4. The R-Smad/Co-Smad complex translocates to the nucleus to regulate
  TGF-β responsive genes. R-Smad, receptor dependent Smad; I-Smad, inhibitory Smad;
  Co-Smad, collaborator Smad; ALK1, R-I mutated in HHT2; Endoglin, auxiliary TGF-β
  receptor mutated in HHT1.
