caption: Proposed mechanisms for crosstalk between AR and GDNF signaling and inhibition
  of prostate development by RET-mediated GDNF signaling. In androgen-induced prostate
  development, AR signaling in the UrM orchestrates prostate development by regulating
  expression of morphoregulatory proteins, such as GDNF and GFRα1. With regard to
  crosstalk between AR and GDNF signaling, we propose that reciprocal downregulation
  of AR and GDNF signaling may tune prostate development. AR-mediated transcriptional
  regulation of GDNF and GFRα1 in the UrM may serve to downregulate GDNF signaling
  in the developing prostate because RET-mediated GDNF signaling is a negative regulator
  of PrE proliferation and cytodifferentiation. In the UrM, GDNF binds and activates
  the GFRα1/RET co-receptor complex, and subsequent RET-mediated signaling activates
  the MEK-ERK pathway, which leads to increases in RET expression and proliferation
  of UrM cells, including inductive VMP cells. In addition, we propose that crosstalk
  between RET-mediated GDNF signaling and AR signaling in the inductive UrM may decrease
  AR signaling and alter expression of a putative paracrine signal, thus interfering
  with AR-induced proliferation and cytodifferentiation of PrE cells. In the PrE and
  UrE, which lack RET expression, GDNF may bind and activate another co-receptor complex
  consisting of GFRα1 and a putative co-receptor signaling component (coRSC). RET-independent
  signaling increases proliferation of UrE cells.
