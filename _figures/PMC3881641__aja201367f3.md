caption: A representative network of the CT genes in spermatogenesis and tumourigenesis.
  Drawn by Pathway Studio, this graph shows the relationship of 11 representative
  biological terms (including four disease terms and seven cell processes) and 64
  CT genes. Red, yellow and purple labels represent the CT genes, cell processes and
  disease terms, respectively. Grey, blue and green lines represent the relationships
  with the regulation, expression and promoter binding, respectively.
