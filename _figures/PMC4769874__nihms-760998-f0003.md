caption: (A) Heatmap showing the expression of 76 genes that change more than 2-fold
  in ΔrpaA strains. The columns indicate the expression of these genes at morning
  and evening circadian time points as well as in a ΔrpaA and ΔrpaA::rpaA(D53E) strain,
  which has a mutation that simulates constitutively active RpaA. The column on the
  left of the heatmap indicates if a gene has a normal circadian expression peak at
  dawn (red) or dusk (blue) based on data from Vijayan et al. (). The expression data
  indicate that genes controlled by RpaA are normally activated in the evening and
  repressed in the morning. Overexpression of the constitutively active form of RpaA
  shifts the genes to an evening-like expression state. Correlation with the circadian
  timing of genes indicates that RpaA acts most strongly on dusk-peaking transcripts,
  and primarily activates dusk transcripts while repressing dawn transcripts. (B)
  Metabolic pathway diagram summarizing reactions in Glycolysis, Glycogen Metabolism,
  and the Pentose Phosphate Pathway. Reactions driven by genes positively regulated
  by RpaA are indicated in green, whereas reactions driven by genes repressed by RpaA
  are indicated in red. Mapping RpaA transcriptional regulation to these pathways
  shows the positive effect of RpaA on the oxidative phase of the Pentose Phosphate
  Pathway. Expression data and RpaA target genes in panels A and B were adapted from
  Markson et al. ().
