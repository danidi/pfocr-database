caption: The canonical pathway of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis. After the transcription
  of a miRNA gene by RNA polymerase II, the produced primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) is
  cleaved by the microprocessor complex Drosha-DGCR8, generating the precursor miRNA
  (pre-miRNA). Following the export of pre-miRNA from the nucleus by Exportin-5-RanGTP,
  the Dicer ribonuclease, in complex with TRBP (TAR-binding protein), cleaves the
  pre-miRNA hairpins to generate the mature miRNA, a small non-coding RNA (nc-RNA)
  of ~22 nucleotides in length. The functional strand of the mature miRNA is loaded
  together with Argonaute proteins (AGOs) onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)
  and it can then direct post-transcriptional repression via mRNA complementarity.
  Downregulation of gene expression can occur through translational repression with
  or without mRNA cleavage, depending on whether the miRNA has full or partial complementarity
  to the target mRNA, respectively.
