caption: a Cell processes predicted to be influenced by the top up-regulated priority
  genes (164 genes showing a differential expression >1 log2) based on in silico analysis
  employing the ResNet database (PathwayStudio 5.0, Ariadne). P and expression values
  of all 1,145 probes can be found in SI_Table_1c. An online version of this figure
  with hyperlinks is provided as SI_Figure_3a. b The three disease conditions showing
  the strongest biological association with the group of top up-regulated priority
  genes which may serve as drivers of the disease process underlying PD. In silico
  analysis was performed employing the ResNet database of molecular interactions (Pathway-Studio
  5.0, Ariadne). An online version of this figure with hyperlinks is provided as SI_Figure_3b
