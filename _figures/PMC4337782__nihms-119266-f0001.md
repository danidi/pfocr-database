caption: 'Through various processes hESCs give rise to neural precursors. Defined
  media contain supplements such as F12, N2, B27, insulin, transferin, selenium and
  growth factors bFGF, EGF, and in one protocol LIF. NSCs may be directly isolated
  from hESCs by exposure to defined media supplemented with EGF, bFGF and LIF. Rosette,
  an intermediate structure in the neural-induction pathway towards definitive NSC
  state, is lost following exposure to the mitogenic growth factors bFGF and EGF.
  EBs, an early intermediate stage, may be derived with media containing retinoic
  acid, conditioned media, serum or serum-free media. In the default pathway, neural
  lineage may be induced in low-density cultures of hESCs in the presence of inhibitors
  of the TGF-β signaling molecules. The induction of neural lineage may also be initiated
  by co-culturing with a stromal cell line leading to rosette formation.1°Sph: Primary
  spheres; 2°Sph: Secondary spheres; CM: Conditioned media; Dll1: Notch ligand Delta-like1;
  EB: Embryoid body; hESC: Human embryonic stem cell; ITS: Insulin, transferin and
