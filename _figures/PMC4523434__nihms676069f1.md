caption: Upon sensing ER stress, IRE1α undergoes dimerization or oligomerization,
  and trans-autophosphorylation, activating its cytosolic endonuclease activity. Subsequently,
  IRE1αalternatively splices Xbp1 mRNA to generate Xbp1s which translocates into the
  nucleus and regulates different genes. Furthermore, activated IRE1α can selectively
  degrade particular mRNAs by a process called regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD).
  Unlike IRE1α-XBP1 pathway, physiological significance of other IRE1α pathways are
  not well established. (B) Misfolded proteins in the ER lumen are recognized, ubiquitinated
  and retrotranslocated by the HRD1-SEL1L ERAD complex to the cytosol for proteasomal
  degradation. Bip and OS9 may be involved in the recognition of misfolded substrates.
