caption: Hypothesized interaction of D2receptors and NMDA receptors in the striatum.
  Inhibition of D2 receptors or stimulation with forskolin increases cAMP levels and
  activates the PKA–second messenger pathway. The second messenger pathway increases
  NMDA receptor function, e.g., via897Ser-NR1 phosphorylation, such that the NMDA
  receptor activates a signal transduction pathway that translocates to the nucleus
  and causes phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB. Phosphorylation of
  CREB leads to an increase in mRNA synthesis of thec-fos and proenkephalin genes.
  Although CREB may be necessary for the transactivation of c-fosand the proenkephalin
  gene in the striatum, additional transcription factors may be involved and activated
  by the same signal transduction pathway. Inset, D2 receptor activity depresses PKA
  activity. Inhibition of D2 receptors with drugs such as haloperidol disinhibits
  PKA activity and leads to897Ser–NR1 phosphorylation. Activation of PKA with low
  levels of forskolin has a similar effect, whereas high levels of forskolin can mediate
  CREB phosphorylation in addition to NMDA receptor phosphorylation. Thus, high levels
  of forskolin can mediate gene expression independent of NMDA receptors ().
