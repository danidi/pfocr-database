caption: A. Under normal conditions in the developing brain, CGNPs are exposed to
  Shh and IGF. Normal levels of Shh signaling promote CGNP proliferation and cerebellar
  development, with appropriate levels of mTOR activity and p27 localization.B. When
  the TSC is inactivated, p27Kip1 moves to the cytoplasm where it can be phosphorylated.
  mTOR is released from inhibition, increasing mRNA translation. MTOR may also act
  through S6 kinase to further inhibit GSK-3α/β.C. In medulloblastomas, loss of Ptc
  function or aberrant activation of Smo drives oncogenic Shh activity which cooperates
  with enhanced signaling by growth factors such as PDGF or IGF, leading TSC inactivation.
  p27Kip1 moves to the cytoplasm where it may be inactivated or gain new oncogenic
  functions. mTOR activity is increased, contributing to the transformed phenotype.
  TSC inactivation by mutation/deletion also leads to mTOR activation, p27Kip1 misregulation
  and enhanced activity of Shh pathway effectors.
