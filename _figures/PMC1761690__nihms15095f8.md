caption: PAR-1 promotes p46/p52Shc phosphorylation at Tyr239/Tyr240 and Tyr317 via
  an EGFR transactivation pathway that leads to the activation of ERK and p66Shc-Ser36
  phosphorylation in cardiac fibroblasts. PAR-1 activates ERK through a pathway that
  does not involve EGFR transactivation or p46/p52Shc phosphorylation (at Tyr239/Tyr240
  or Tyr317) in cardiomyocytes. In cardiomyocytes, acute ERK activation by PAR-1 leads
  to p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation. Chronic Gαq activation (by PMT) leads to increased
  p66Shc-Ser 36 phosphorylation via a mechanism involving PKC and ERK. See “Discussion”
  for further details.
