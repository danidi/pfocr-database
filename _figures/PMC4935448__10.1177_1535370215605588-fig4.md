caption: 'Proposed model of miRNA regulation by simvastation and possible protective
  role of ubiquinol. (a, b) Possible targets of miRNAs regulated in the liver. (c)
  miRNAs regulated in macrophages and monocytes. Targets of miRNA were hypothesized
  by published literature as described in text.  denotes negative regulation resulting
  in target molecules which may be down-regulated (in green) and  denotes a positive
  regulation resulting in target molecules which may be up-regulated (red). (a) Patients
  treated with 20 mg simvastatin/day had increased circulating miR-15a, miR-21, and
  miR-33a. miR-15a was shown to target and inhibit CDC25A, a cell-cycle regulator
  known for G1 to S phase progression. miR-21 has been shown to potentiate expression
  of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein. The balance of miR-15a and miR-21 expression
  in the liver may determine deterimental effects on its proliferation. (b) In addition
  to miR-15a and miR-21, mir-192 and miR-30b were up-regulated in patients receiving
  ubiquinol supplementation and in HepG2 cell lines. Their roles in proliferation
  and anti-apoptosis might be one possible mechanism of hepatoprotection and observed
  by reduced ALP and ALT. (c) In the circulation, miR-146a, miR-15a, and miR-21 were
  up-regulated in patients treated with simvastatin supplementated with ubiquinol.
  Consistent with its anti-inflammatory function, miRNAs regulated with ubiquinol
  supplementation reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (NFKB) and increase anti-inflammatory
  cytokines (e.g., IL-10). miR-146a target molecules in the innate immune response
  (TLR4 signaling) pathway, directly targeting IRAK1 and TRAF6.IRAK1: interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase; TRAF6: tumor necrosis factor receptor-assicated family;
  GALNT7: GalNAc transferase 7; PDCD4: programmed cell death 4 protein'
