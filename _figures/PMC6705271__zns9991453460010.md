caption: Summary model. Model of GSK-3-SRF signaling pathway in regulation of axon
  growth. Phosphorylation by GSK-3 on serine 224 results in the activation of SRF
  and subsequent recruitment of MKL-family cofactors. The SRF-MKL transcriptional
  complex activates genes, such as VCL and MAP1B. MAP1B regulates microtubule dynamics,
  whereas VCL tethers F-actin to focal adhesion junctions to promote neurite growth
  downstream of the GSK-3-SRF pathway. Absence of SRF or GSK-3 activity results in
  inhibition or attenuation of neurite growth.
