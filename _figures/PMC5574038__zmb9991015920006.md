caption: Model of the role of the Dishevelled DEP domain in Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction.
  Signal transduction is initiated by the interaction of Wnt3a with the extracellular
  part of LRP6 and Frizzled. DVL is recruited to the membrane and interacts with FZD.
  The N-terminal part of the DVL DEP domain (dark blue) is necessary for dynamic DVL
  membrane recruitment to Frizzled after Wnt3a treatment. Other regions of the DEP
  domain (light blue) that are important for the stable interaction of DVL with FZD
  and/or the plasma membrane and that are required for the function of DVL in the
  Wnt/PCP pathway are indispensable in this process. Via its DIX domain, DVL interacts
  with axin, which brings axin to the membrane complex and leads to LRP6 phosphorylation
  and downstream Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This Wnt3a-induced β-catenin signal transduction
  is indicated by blue arrows. Overexpression of DVL, commonly used in the experiments
  in the Wnt field, can bypass the requirement for the DEP domain in the Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway by nucleating endogenous DVL and axin (via the DIX domain) and triggering
  Wnt ligand-independent β-catenin activation. This pathway is indicated by an orange
  arrow.
