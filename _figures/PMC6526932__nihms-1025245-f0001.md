caption: a | Ascorbate can be oxidized in the extracellular space by reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), producing ascorbate radical, which can be oxidized to dehydroascorbic
  acid (DHA). DHA can be taken up by cells or irreversibly converted to 2,3-l-diketoglutonate
  (2,3-DKG), which is degraded into oxalic acid and threonic acid, b | Pharmacological
  ascorbate can kill cancer cells by increasing oxidative stress via two possible
  mechanisms that complement each other. First, extracellular H2O2 may directly kill
  cancer cells by generating •OH via the Fenton reaction,,. Increased levels of labile
  ferric iron, Fe3+, in the tumour microenvironment can facilitate the oxidation of
  ascorbate, resulting in ascorbate radical, DHA and ferrous iron, Fe2+. Once Fe2+
  is formed, Fe2+ may be oxidized by oxygen, producing superoxide anions, O2•−. Superoxide
  dismutase (SOD) catalyses the conversion of O2•− to H2O2 and O2. Fe3+ can enter
  the cell when bound to transferrin (Tf), which binds to the Tf receptor (TfR) and
  is processed and oxidized in the endosome to then contribute to the intracellular
  Fe2+ pool. H2O2 can enter the cell through diffusion facilitated by aquaporins.
  H2O2 reacts with either extracellular or intracellular labile Fe2+ to generate highly
  reactive hydroxyl radicals (•OH) that are harmful to cells. These reactions are
  further perpetuated by the recycling of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by ascorbate and ascorbate
  radical, generating fully oxidized vitamin C, DHA. Second, H2O2 may contribute to
  the increased levels of extracellular DHA by creating a more oxidative tumour microenvironment.
  DHA can then efficiently enter cells through glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and consume
  the intracellular reducing potential of reduced glutathione (GSH) and NADPH, resulting
  in increased levels of intracellular ROS,. This leads to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
  (PARP) activation, a DNA repair enzyme, thereby depleting cellular NAD+ levels,
  a cofactor of PARP. NAD+ is required by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (GADPH) as a cofactor. Consequent inhibition of GAPDH activity inhibits glycolysis
  in cancer cells, leading to inhibition of ATP production and cell death,,. In addition,
  cellular ROS can also be released from cells, resulting in a positive feedback loop.
  Because high levels of labile Fe2+, GLUT1 overexpression and addiction to glycolysis
  frequently occur in many types of cancer cells, certain cancer cells may present
  all three of these characteristics and those populations might be more sensitive
  to ascorbate treatment. 1,3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid; G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; G6PD glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GSSG, glutathione disulfide;
