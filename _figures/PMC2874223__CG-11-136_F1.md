caption: The figure shows one of several top-scoring multigene network associated
  by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software to seventeen genes (gray shaded symbols)
  of the CS2_All data set which includes both duplicated and deleted genes. Several
  genes associated to the axon guidance signalling canonical pathway and to other
  nervous system functions and diseases map in this network (see also Supplementary
  Fig. 2). A score of 29 (- log (p-value)) was obtained for this specific network
  calculated by the right-tailed Fisher's Exact Test.
