caption: Metabolic map of central carbon metabolism of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv.
  viciae 3841. Interconnections between the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, Entner-Doudoroff
  pathway, Pentose Phosphate pathway, and Tri-Carboxylic Acid cycle were based on
  the proposed central carbon metabolism of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Agrobacterium
  tumefaciens (Fuhrer et al., ; Geddes and Oresnik, ). Amino acid precursors are indicated
  in bold text. The impact of mutations in each metabolic step on growth were determined
  by contrasting results from TY and VMM-mannitol INSeq experiments. Genes observed
  to be growth defective or essential exclusively on VMM-Mannitol were concluded to
  be involved in central carbon metabolism of mannitol. Genes observed to be GD or
  ES on TY and VMM-mannitol were grouped, and assumed to have roles in central carbon
  metabolism that were not mannitol dependent.
