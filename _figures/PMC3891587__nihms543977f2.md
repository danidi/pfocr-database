caption: In the adherence step, yeast-form cells adhere to the substrate. In the initiation
  step, the cells propagate to form microcolonies and germ tubes form to yield hyphae.
  In the maturation step, the biofilm biomass expands, the extracellular matrix accumulates
  and drug resistance increases. In the dispersal step, yeast-form cells are released
  to colonize the surrounding environment. The upper half of the diagram depicts several
  known pathway relationships. The bottom half includes additional genes that function
  in a specific step, but may not be connected to a known pathway. For simplicity,
  some known pathway relationships have been omitted. A few genes are presented more
  than once if they have roles in more then one step of biofilm formation. Arrows
  represent positive relationships; T-shaped bars represent negative relationships.
  A “+” indicates that the upstream gene/signal stimulates expression of the downstream
  target; a “−” indicates that the upstream gene/signal inhibits expression of the
  downstream target. Dashed lines indicate repression by an indirect mechanism.
