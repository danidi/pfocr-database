caption: 'Simplified reference TLR signaling pathway projected onto putative homologs
  in Trichoplax sp. H2. True Toll-like receptors are absent but many components of
  the downstream signaling cascade are present. Support for the presence and homologous
  function of pathway components is indicated by filled boxes and superscript letters,
  where 1: is supported by domain composition, 2: is supported by KEGG annotation,
  3: is supported by two of either EggNOG OG, OrthoMCL OG or best Swiss-Prot hit,
  4: is supported by phylogenetic validation. Uncertainty regarding homology because
  of missing domains is indicated by a red outline. For example, Trichoplax possesses
  several IRAK-like genes but all are lacking the DD of true IRAK genes. In the case
  of the identified NF-κB-like protein, an RHD and ANK repeats are present but a DD
  is absent. Question marks denote unknown down- or upstream signaling components:
  Since true Toll-like receptors are absent and a bipartite receptor (extracellular
  LRR, intracellular TIR/SEFIR) is hypothetical, the recognition part in TLR signaling
  remains speculative. Similarly, some of the identified TIR domain containing (TIR-DC)
  proteins may function in TLR signaling as alternative adaptor molecules, but their
  upstream input as well as their targets have yet to be identified. The function
  of the missing IκBα ortholog may be fulfilled by other placozoan ANK containing
  proteins. The MyD88-independent pathway has been omitted since it is assumed to
  have emerged in chordates. See also Additional files ,  and'
