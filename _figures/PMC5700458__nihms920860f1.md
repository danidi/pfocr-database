caption: The UPR mediators have versatile roles in different cell types either in
  the presence of balanced or unresolved ER stress. Under physiological conditions,
  the balanced UPR is crucial for the development of cells with secretory functions
  as pancreatic β islets, hepatocytes and B lymphocytes. Also, the maturation and
  the antigen presenting capability of CD8α DCs require moderated activation of UPR
  that is mediated though IRE1α-XBP-1 pathway. Furthermore, the effect of the balanced
  UPR in the T cell development and function is emerging. An exaggerated form of UPR
  can be triggered by different stress factors associated with pathological conditions
  as infections, autoimmunity and cancer. Tumors cells either survive or undergo ICD
  depending on the degree of UPR severity. Tumor infiltrating myeloid cells (t-DC,
  TAM, and MDSC) are characterized by sustained and amplified UPR activity which converts
  them into immunosuppressive cells that promote tumor growth and invasion.
