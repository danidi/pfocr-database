caption: 'The metabolic network. The core metabolism of cancer cells integrates glycolysis,
  the pentose phosphate pathway, the citric acid cycle, lipogenesis and amino acids
  metabolism. Biomass synthesis is described as the incorporation of amino acids,
  intermediate metabolites and palmitic acid. The metabolic therapy includes Diclofenac
  as hexokinase and lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor; alpha-Lipoic acid (ALA) as pyruvate
  dehydrogenase activator; Hydroxycitrate (HCA) as ATP citrate lyase inhibitor; Metformin
  as ATP synthase inhibitor and NAD leakage activator. Notations: ACCOA: Acetyl-CoenzymeA,
