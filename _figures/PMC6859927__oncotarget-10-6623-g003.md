caption: 'The presence of the BRAFV600e mutation in cancer cells leads to an increase
  in cell proliferation, metastasis and patients mortality. The administration of
  the BRAF-inhibitor PLX4720 exert both direct and indirect effect in cancer. Direct
  effect: PLX4720 inhibits the molecular pathway switched on by the BRAFV600e mutation,
  consequently cell proliferation, metastasis and patients mortality are reduced;
  Indirect effect: PLX4720 inhibits the secretion of pro-tumorigenic chemokines in
  normal surrounding and cancer cells, which in turn, leads to a reduction of cell
  proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, EMT and metastatic potential.'
