caption: Most of the data upon which this model is based have come from studies in
  LmnaH222P/H222P mice, a small animal model of ‘LMNA cardiomyopathy’ in humans. Drugs
  shown to inhibit each signaling pathway in LmnaH222P/H222P mice are shown in red.
  See the text for a more detailed explanation.
