caption: 'Interaction network analysis of the (A) visceral obesity pathway and (B)
  the cell cycle pathway, using the path designer of IPA. A simplified version of
  IPA pathway maps generated for genes that were commonly expressed in microarrays
  of human breast cells and breast tissue treated with BPA. Red and green nodes represent
  upregulated or downregulated genes. White nodes represent the genes in a pathway
  not available in the microarray for testing. Symbols represent the following: Concentric
  circle, complex/group; square, cytokine; rhombus, enzyme; dashed rectangle, ion
  channel; inverted triangle, kinase; rectangle, ligand-dependent nuclear receptor;
  circle, other; triangle, phosphatase; horizontal oval, transcription regulator;
  vertical oval, transmembrane receptor. BPA, bisphenol A; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis.'
