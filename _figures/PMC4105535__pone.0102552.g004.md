caption: The network analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software.
  a) Mechanistic network of β-catenin downstream regulators displaying predicted activation
  state and the regulatory relation (activation or inhibition) between the single
  regulators. β-catenin and a number of downstream regulators are predicted to be
  inactivated. b) The analysis shows a tight connection between the genes regulated
  in the pN1 samples (light grey nodes) and those regulated in the pN0 samples (dark
  grey nodes) linked by ERK1/2 and DKK1 embedded within the network.
