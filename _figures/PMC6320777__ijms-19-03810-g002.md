caption: DR up-regulates intestinal lipid metabolism. Dietary restriction or its mimetics
  promote the adaptation towards triglyceride usage, increase lipid accumulation and
  fat storage in the fly gut, and also increase lipid transport to other tissues from
  the gut. This process is mediated by a range of hormones and pathways including
  Akt/TOR pathway, microbes regulated IMD pathway, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
  related IRE1/XBP1 signaling module which ultimately induce the expression of lipid
  metabolism-related genes or transcription factors such as magro, sugarbabe, and
  FKH in nucleus. It should be noted that nuclear receptor DHR96 is activated in low
  cholesterol dietary conditions (cholesterol restriction) which then causes an increase
  in the transcription of the downstream bifunctional enzyme magro (with both Gastric
  lipase and cholesterol lipase activity), increasing the digestion of dietary TAG
  and cholesterol esters in lumen and lipogenesis in ECs. (Lines represent signaling
  pathways, arrows represent activation and blunt arrows represent inhibition. Light
  gray lines refer to path which is blocked or inhibited). EC, enterocyte; EE, enteroendocrine
  cell.
