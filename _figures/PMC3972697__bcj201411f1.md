caption: Biosynthetic pathway of HNPs. PreproHNPs are cleaved cotranslationally into
  proHNPs. In the promyelocyte, most proHNPs are processed by a yet unidentified protease
  into mature cationic HNPs. HNPs are able to associate with the anionic proteoglycan
  serglycin, which aides in translocation to azurophil granules. In myelocytes and
  metamyelocytes, the electrically neutral proHNPs are not processed. This hinders
  association with serglycin and most proHNP is secreted into the bone marrow plasma,
  although a minor part is retained in specific granules. HNP, human neutrophil peptides.
