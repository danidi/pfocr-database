caption: Solid lines indicate known pathways; dotted lines indicate pathways requiring
  further investigation. Following engagement of surface receptors (shown as green
  ovals), activation of phospholipase C (PLC) leads to production of IP3 and DAG.
  IP3 activates the IP3R in the ER, leading to calcium release from ER stores into
  the cytoplasm. The decrease in calcium concentration in the ER activates calcium
  sensors STIM1 and potentially STIM2. One or the other (or both; hence, the dotted-line
  connection) of these sensors couples to surface calcium channels to induce entry
  of calcium from the extracellular space. The relative contribution of ORAI1, ORAI2,
  ORAI3, or TRPC channels to calcium entry remains to be investigated. Nevertheless,
  sustained elevation in intracellular calcium works with DAG to activate PKC isoforms
  (shown is PKCα and PKCβ; however, PKCδ is also known to be involved []), which phosphorylates
  NADPH subunits and allows assembly of the NADPH oxidase in the plasma/phagosomal
  membrane for superoxide production. Extracellular calcium influx is also likely
  coupled to transcriptional changes in neutrophils (shown by the dotted line), probably
  through calcineurin, as in other immune cells.
