caption: (A) In pluripotent conditions or in the absence of RA, the canonical Wnt
  signaling pathway activation culminates with Tcf1 and β-catenin binding to selective
  Wnt response elements (WREs; white boxes) and induction of the transcription of
  genes necessary for pluripotency/stemness.(B) In presence of RA, the noncanonical
  Wnt signaling pathway is activated and its downstream effects cause a reduction
  in the expression of Tcf1 and in the binding of Tcf1 at specific Tcf1-specific WREs.
  This reduction in WRE promoter binding, along with increased expression of Tcf3,
  enhances the ability of Tcf3 to bind Tcf1-selective WREs, reducing the transcription
  of genes necessary for maintaining the pluripotent/stem cell state. RA allows the
  binding of Tcf3 to WREs that promote the transcription of specific genes that are
  expressed in a differentiated state (black box).
