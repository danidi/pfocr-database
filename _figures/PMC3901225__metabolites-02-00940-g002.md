caption: 'Protein complexes and their connection with metabolism. A number of central
  complexes are shown, giving the situation in E. coli, as well as implied and connected
  central metabolic pathways. In S. aureus, details of several complexes differ (E.
  coli-specific complexes not present in S. aureus are labeled with E (in green),
  S. aureus-specific complexes not present in E. coli are labeled with S in yellow,
  see text). For details see text. Abbreviations: Ac-Coa, acetyl-CoA; Fru-1,6, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate,
  Fru-6P, fructose 6-phosphate; Glu, glucose; Glu-6P, glucose 6-phosphate; Gnt-6P,
  6-phospho gluconate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PTS,
  phosphotransferase system; Pyr, pyruvate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; TriP, triose
  phosphate.'
