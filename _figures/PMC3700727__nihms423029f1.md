caption: The AHR is a cytosolic receptor that is bound to a chaperone protein. When
  a ligand goes across the cell membrane and binds to the AHR, it sheds its chaperone
  and goes to the nucleus, where it associates with ARNT and binds to the Dioxin Response
  Element (DRE), becoming a transcription factor. It induces transcription of the
  cytochrome P450 enzymes including cyp1a1, cyp1a2, cyp1b1 and other metabolizing
  enzymes including glutathione S-transferase Ya (GSTYa) and aldehyde-3-dehydrogenase
  (ALDH-3). Reprinted with permission from (). Copyright 2008 American Chemical Society.
