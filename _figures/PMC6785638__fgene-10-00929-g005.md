caption: The calcium signaling pathway is overrepresented in the specific differentially
  expressed genes altered by alfalfa intervention during the preweaning period. (A)
  Molecules involved in the increase and removal of the intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i).
  Cav1.3, L-type Ca2+ channel subunit alpha 1 D; Cav1.2, L-type Ca2+ channel subunit
  alpha 1 C; STAC, SH3 and cysteine-rich domain-containing protein; RyR, ryanodine
  receptor; HRC, histidine-rich calcium-binding protein; FAM20C, FAM20C Golgi associated
  secretory pathway kinase; KCHIP2, potassium voltage-gated channel-interacting protein
  2; Kv4, voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv4; DPLP, dipeptidyl peptidase–like
  protein. The arrow indicates the Ca2+ flux. (B) Gene network regulated by the increased
  [Ca2+]i. Red represents the upregulated genes or the proteins encoded by the upregulated
  genes; blue represents the downregulated genes or the proteins encoded by the downregulated
  genes.
