caption: 'Distinct roles of enzymes MTHFD1L and MTHFR in the folate-related one-carbon
  cycle. MTHFD1L: mitochondrial monofunctional C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase enzyme;
  MTHFD1: cytoplasmic trifunctional C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase enzyme; MTHFR: 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase enzyme; SAM: S-adenosylmethionine (a methyl donor in numerous reactions).
  The arrows represent different reactions or a flow between the mitochondrion and
  cytoplasm (as appropriate), and the most important enzymes (with bold) and substrates
  are represented.'
