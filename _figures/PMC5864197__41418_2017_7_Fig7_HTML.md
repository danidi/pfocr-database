caption: 'This scheme shows how Orai3 overexpression could contribute to the development
  of a resistant phenotype in ER+ BC cells to cytotoxic and chemo-induced apoptosis.
  The mechanism of action involves p53 protein degradation via the PI3K/Sgk-1 signaling
  pathway and its downtream ubiquitin ligases: Mdm2, on one hand, and Nedd4-2, most
  probably via Sek-1, on the other hand. A In ER+ BC empty vector (EV cells) cells,
  Orai3 mediates store-operated Ca2+ entry. PI3K/Sgk-1 survival signaling pathway
  is not fully activated, Sek-1 (a target of Sgk-1) is not phosphorylated by Sgk-1,
  and is thus activated. Sek-1 can thus phosphorylate the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2,
  inducing its inactivation via its sequestration with the 14-3-3 protein. The tumor
  suppressor protein p53 is expressed in EV cells, and can be activated upon stress
  signals inducing apoptotic death via its transcriptional activity. B In Orai3-overexpressing
  cells, Ca2+ entry is increased, activating PI3K/Sgk-1 survival signaling pathway.
  Sgk-1 (phosphorylated and activated by PI3K) phosphorylates and inactivates Sek-1.
  Sek-1 is therefore unable to phosphorylate Nedd4-2, which is thus able to interact
  with its target proteins (including either p53 regulators or p53 directly), ubiquitinylating
  them and inducing their degradation. p53 is largely downregulated in O3V cells.
  p53 is still regulated by the ubiquitin ligase Mdm2 (phosphorylated by Sgk-1 activation,
  but downregulated following p53 decreased levels)'
