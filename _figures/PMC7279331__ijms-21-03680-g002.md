caption: 'Model of key signalling events modulated by Ca2+/calmodulin and decisive
  for cell proliferation and survival. In this scheme, key signalling events regulated
  by calmodulin (CaM) and critical for cell proliferation (left) and cell survival
  (right) are highlighted. Left: Several protein–protein interactions of calmodulin
  enable a negative feedback regulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Erk1/2). This signalling cascade is initially
  activated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and other receptor tyrosine
  kinases not shown here, at the cell surface and prolonged on endosomes. The overall
  outcome of these interactions prevents a strong and sustained signal that promotes
  cell proliferation. Right: Calmodulin can activate phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)
  and through protein kinase B (Akt) and Rac1, ensure the generation of signals that
  stimulate cell survival. Key interactions and signalling events are numbered and
  underscore the following: (1) Growth factor (e.g., EGF) ¡-induced EGFR activation
  and autophosphorylation enables the recruitment of adaptors (Grb2) and guanine nucleotide
  exchange factors (Sos). This is followed by activation of the Ras/Raf1/MAPK signalling
  pathway. (2) Simultaneously, phospholipase C γ (PLCγ) is recruited to activated
  EGFR to produce the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) and elevate cytosolic
  Ca2+ levels. (3) The latter binds and activates calmodulin, which disables DAG-dependent
  and protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated activation of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs).
  This prevents the shedding and release of membrane-bound growth factor precursors,
  such as heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF). This regulatory circuit effectively prevents
  prolonged EGFR activation in an autocrine manner. (4) In addition, Ca2+/calmodulin
  binds EGFR and inhibits its tyrosine-kinase activity. (5) Moreover, Ca2+/calmodulin
  binds Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), which has the ability to phosphorylate
  and inactivate EGFR. These multiple interactions suggest a negative feedback mechanism
  that allows Ca2+-induced calmodulin activation to trigger downregulation of EGFR
  signalling. (6) Furthermore, Ca2+/calmodulin may preferentially interact with active
  KRas (KRas-GTP), which is particularly relevant in settings where KRas is the most
  prominent Ras family member contributing to MAPK activation, such as in NIH3T3 fibroblasts.
  In these cells, KRas/calmodulin interaction blocks downstream Raf1 activation. This
  could possibly be accompanied by the recruitment of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs)
  that further reduce KRas-GTP levels, thereby advancing to downregulate MAPK signalling
  and proliferation in these cells. (7) On the other hand, Ca2+/calmodulin together
  with activated EGFR can stimulate PI3K activity. (8) This increases the recruitment
  and activity of Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rac1 GEFs) that elevate
  Rac1-GTP (active) levels. (9) Together with Akt activation, these signalling events
  are linked to an anti-apoptotic response that triggers cell survival. The GTP/GDP
  cyles of KRas and Rac1, as well as the membrane location of phosphatidyl-4,5-biphosphate
  (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) are indicated. In summary,
  Ca2+/calmodulin modulates the MAPK pathway driving proliferation and on the other
  hand, stimulates PI3K activity to induce cell survival. The overall biological outcome
  probably depends on the signal diversity derived from the extracellular milieu as
  well as the cell-specific and differential repertoire of calmodulin-responsive players
  in each cell.'
