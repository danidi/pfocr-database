caption: Formation of 17S-hydro(peroxy)-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,15E,19Z-docosahexaenoic acid
  from DHA by 15-LOX type 1 initiates the PCTR biosynthetic pathway. This hydroperoxide
  is converted to 16S,17S-epoxy-7Z,10Z,13E,14E,19Z- docosahexaenoic acid, this allylic
  epoxide is precursor to PCTR1, that is transformed to PCTR2 that is in turn precursor
  to PCTR3.
