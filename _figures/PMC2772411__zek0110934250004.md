caption: Heat stress is a means of activating the CWI pathway in S. cerevisiae. Wsc1
  functions as the cell stress sensor to activate the CWI pathway in response to heat
  shock. There are several proteins within the CWI pathway that potentially participate
  in a lateral interaction to influence the CWI pathway response to heat shock. Further,
  there is indication of a cross talk event with the PKA pathway leading to Slt/Mpk1
  phosphorylation during heat shock. Broken lines indicate potential signal transduction
  events.
