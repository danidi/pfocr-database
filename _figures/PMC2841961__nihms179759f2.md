caption: In medium spiny neurons of the dorsal striatum, excitatory afferents from
  the cortex and dopamine fiber arising from the substantia nigra converge. If Gp1
  mGluRs and D2Rs are activated concomitantly endocannabinoids. most likely anandamide,
  are synthesized and released from the MSN. This retrograde messenger activates presynaptic
  CB1 receptors, and reduced release probability via inhibition of calcium channels,
  cAMP and PKA, such that Rab3a and Rim1a dependent exocytosis is reduced. In Parkinson’s
  disease dopamine afferents are absent, and mGluR-LTD as a consequence reduced. This
  leads to increased indirect pathway activity (i.e. more inhibitory output from the
  GABAergic MSNs) and a reduction of spontaneous movements.
