caption: 'NADHc generated by sorbitol oxidation is reoxidized to NAD+c largely by
  enzymes that promote the development of diabetic complications. (A) Under steady-state
  normoglycemic conditions, glucose is metabolized via glycolysis to synthesize ATP
  [in the cytoplasm via substrate phosphorylation (SP) and in mitochondria via oxidative
  phosphorylation (OP)] only after electrons and protons are transferred from GA3P
  to oxidized NAD+c (by GA3P-DH), reducing it to NADHc followed by downstream formation
  of pyruvate equimolar to NADHc. Electrons and protons carried by NADHc can be transferred
  into mitochondria via the malate-aspartate (Mal-Asp) and glycerol phosphate (G3P)
  electron shuttles (❸); pyruvate can be transferred into mitochondria via a mitochondrial
  pyruvate carrier. All cells generate NADHc and pyruvate via glycolysis faster than
  they are used for ATP synthesis in mitochondria. Excess NADHc is reoxidized to NAD+c
  largely by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), coupled to reduction of excess pyruvate
  to lactate (❶) that diffuses out of the cell (e.g., for retina: 30, 50; for nerve:
  OAS IV). Much smaller amounts of glucose are metabolized by the sorbitol pathway
  through which sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) catalyzes oxidation of sorbitol to fructose
  coupled to reduction of equimolar NAD+c to NADHc. However, SDH does not generate
  pyruvate required for reoxidation of NADHc to NAD+c by LDH. This NADHc is reoxidized
  to NAD+c largely via alternative pathways (❷): (1) NADH-driven oxidases that generate
  basal levels of superoxide (O2−) and (2) glycerol 3-phosphate-DH (G3P-DHc), which
  fuels synthesis of basal levels of diacylglycerol (DAG) and protein kinase C (PKC)
  activity. Both of these mechanisms of reoxidation of NADHc to NAD+c maintain normal
  steady-state ratios of NADH/NAD+c = (lactate/pyruvate) × KLDH ( in Methods). (B)
  Hyperglycemia augments glucose metabolism via glycolysis and via the sorbitol pathway.
  In normal rat retina and sciatic nerve endoneuria incubated in 30 vs. 5 mM glucose,
  glycolysis was increased ∼1.5 fold [manifested by increased lactate production]
  (, , current OAS-IV). Oxidation of sorbitol in the same endoneuria (manifested by
  production of fructose equimolar to NADHc) was increased ∼11-fold. Because oxidation
  of sorbitol does not form pyruvate, NADHc levels increase by 1.5- to twofold (manifested
  by increased ratios of NADH/NAD+c in ,  and ; refs., –, ), and much more NADHc is
  reoxidized to NAD+c via alternative pathways (❷) (i.e., by NADHc-driven oxidases
  that increase superoxide production and by G3P-DHc, which increases synthesis of
  diacylglycerol (DAG), activation of protein kinase C (PKC), and activation of NADPH-driven
  oxidases to augment superoxide production further. The 1.5- to twofold increases
  in NADHc also may contribute to product inhibition of GA3P-DH, which increases levels
  of GA3P and DHAP (i.e., triose phosphates-TP (, , , OAS IV) that are in equilibrium.
  Nonenzymatic degradation of TP (primarily DHAP) forms methylglyoxal (MG), a potent
  nonenzymatic glycation agent. (For interpretation of the references to color in
