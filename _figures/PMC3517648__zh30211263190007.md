caption: Cartoon describing differential O2 sensing in EC cells and signal pathway/5-HT
  secretion. Under hypoxic conditions (A), a significant increase in 5-HT secretion
  and production occurs via a direct HIF-1α-mediated mechanism. Activation of NF-κB
  may also occur via cross-activation of this pathway. Hyperoxic conditions resulted
  in an O2 dependent prolyl hydroxylase (PHD)-mediated degradation of HIF-1α, which
  lead to a decrease in TPH1 transcription and translation (B). With less TPH1, the
  rate-limiting enzyme in 5-HT production and 5-HT synthesis will decrease. Solid
  lines and + reflect activation. Dotted lines reflect a decreased effect and -, inhibition.
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
