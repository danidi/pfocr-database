caption: 'Recently Identified Functions for N-Terminal (Nt) Acetylation in Plants.
  (A) Under normal conditions NATA co-translationally Nt-acetylates (Ac) a large number
  of proteins following Nt-Met excision . Drought-induced abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation
  (green gradated triangle) depletes NATA transcript and protein abundance, which
  leads to a global reduction in the number of Nt-acetylated proteins, resulting in
  several adaptive responses that improve drought-tolerance and survival . Thus, NATA-mediated
  Nt-acetylation is proposed to act as an important switch coordinating metabolic,
  developmental and physiological responses downstream of ABA. (B) The Nod-like receptor
  protein SNC1 plays a key role in plant immunity. Two Nt-variants of SNC1 are present
  in plants, most likely arising as a result of alternative translation. Nt-Met-Met-Asp-SNC1
  (MMD-) is Nt-acetylated by NATA, whereas Nt-Met-Asp-SNC1 (MD-), which lacks the
  first Met residue, is Nt-acetylated by NATB . Remarkably, these Nt-acetylation events
  have contrasting consequences, destabilising or stabilising SNC1, which decreases
  or enhances the immune response, respectively. Xu et al. suggest that Nt-acetylation
  of these alternate Nt-isoforms contributes to overall SNC1 homeostasis. This study
  reveals that different NAT complexes can have antagonistic effects on the stability
  of a protein depending on the nature of its N-terminus, suggesting that: (i) control
  of protein half-life by Nt-acetylation is more complex than previously postulated
  , and; (ii) that the previously identified acetylation-dependent branch of the N-end
  rule pathway (the Ac/N-end rule) may be functional in plants .'
