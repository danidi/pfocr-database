caption: Speculative model of theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ)/Polθ activity as back-up
  repair of DSB in homologous recombination (HR) deficient cells. DSBs occurring at
  stalled/collapsed replication forks in S/G2 phases of the cell cycle can be resected
  leading to short segments of ssDNA which are quickly coated by RPA and can be exchanged
  for RAD51 when long end-resection occurs, then promoting strand invasion and copying
  from the sister chromatid in a proficient BRCA-dependent HR pathway. When HR is
  defective (BRCA mutated genes), or when alternative repair is preferred (choice
  poorly understood), TMEJ can act as a back-up repair pathway, involving the critical
  role of Polθ. Polθ-helicase can displace either RPA or RAD51, and Polθ polymerase
  promotes the synapsis of the opposing ends and performs a bidirectional scanning
  initiated from the 3′ termini to identify internal microhomologies which can be
  annealed, thus generating 3′ flaps. Polθ and/or FEN1 can remove the 3′ flaps, and
  Polθ can start the repair DNA synthesis with poor processivity and frequent aborted
  synthesis, resulting in a high rate of mutations.
