caption: TGFβ signalling pathway. Fibrillin-1 (FBN1), as a major component of the
  extracellular matrix, interacts with large latent TGFβ-binding protein (LTBP) which
  sequesters TGFβ1 and thus prevents excessive TGFβ1 signalling. Binding of TGFβ1
  to TGFBR2 leads to phosphorylation and activation of TGFBR1, resulting in activation
  of Smad2/3 transcription factors. After association with Smad4, these transcription
  factors enter the nucleus and increase the transcription of several target genes
  (canonical pathway). Additionally, TGFβ1 induces other (noncanonical) pathways,
  including for example the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), PP2A or RhoA
  cascades. Both defective FBN1 as well as heterozygous mutations in TGFBR1/TGFBR2
  were shown to result in increased TGFβ1 signalling, promoting aneurysm formation.
  Angiotensin II (AngII) regulates TGFβ activation and signalling through the angiotensin
  II type 1 receptor (AT1R). The AT1R blocker Losartan was found to down-regulate
  TGFβ signalling and is currently evaluated as a therapeutic option for MFS.
