caption: AS-IV down-regulated TGF-β1 expression in HG-induced tubular epithelial cells
  (TECs), which promoted the phosphorylation levels of Smad2 and Smad3. The phosphorylation
  of Smad2 and Smad3 further promoted the expressions of the epithelial makers and
  inhibited the expressions of the mesenchymal markers, leading to EMT inhibition.
