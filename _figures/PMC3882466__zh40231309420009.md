caption: 'Diagram of proposed model for the mechanism of PIP2signaling in cyclic mechanical
  strain that leads to cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Left: in unstrained spontaneously
  beating NRVMs, the production of PIP2 is at a basal level and the RhoA/ROCK pathway
  is minimally activated. Right: cyclic mechanical strain of NRVM activates the RhoA/ROCK
  pathway via focal adhesion kinase (FAK). RhoA/ROCK activates phosphatidylinositol
  4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate
  [PI(4)P] to produce PIP2 and increases the PIP2 level. Some of the increased PIP2
  colocalizes with α-actinin in the Z disc. More PIP2 binds to CapZ, resulting in
  an increase in the kinetics of CapZ and also increase in the kinetics of actin.
  This suggests that after many hours of cyclic strain a possible mechanism for cell
  hypertrophy is the accumulation of thin filament assembly triggered partially by
  the increased PIP2 level and its binding to CapZ.'
