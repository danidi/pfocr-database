caption: Sphingolipid metabolism pathway. Schematic demonstrating the key enzymes
  and substrates in sphingolipid metabolism. Increased levels of sphingosine-1 phosphate,
  glucosylceramide, and sphingomyelin enhance cell proliferation, while administration
  of jaspine B, a sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) inhibitor, results in ceramide accumulation
  and apoptosis. Inhibiting the sphingomyelin arm of ceramide metabolism can also
  result in ceramide being shunted to other sphingolipids such as sphingosine-1 phosphate
  and glucosylceramide.
