caption: Light information received by the eyes is transmitted to the pineal gland
  via the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Pineal melatonin secretion pattern reflects
  the length of nights and suppresses pars tuberalis-derived TSH expression. Long
  days increase production of pars tuberalis-derived TSH, which acts on ependymal
  cells in the hypothalamus to induce type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2) expression
  through the TSH receptor–Gsα–cAMP signaling pathway. DIO2-induced thyroid hormone
  activation, through the generation of T3 from T4, transmits the springtime signal,.
  Pars distalis-derived TSH stimulates the thyroid gland. Pars tuberalis-derived TSH
  has tissue-specific N-glycans and forms macro-TSH complexes with immunoglobulin
  (IgG) and albumin in the circulation. The macro-TSH complexes are unable to stimulate
  the thyroid gland, and this feature prevents functional crosstalk between the two
  TSHs, thus preventing the production of seasonal thyroid gland overactivity.
