caption: Model of embryonic liver development. Signals such as FGF-1, FGF-2 and BMP4
  emanating from the cardiac mesoderm specify the foregut endoderm to begin expressing
  liver-specific genes. The Foxa transcription factors are also required for foregut
  endoderm specification. The resulting hepatoblasts, which are albumin and a-fetoprotein
  positive, proliferate and expand. Hepatoblasts express transcription factors such
  as Hex, Hlx and Prox1, which are essential for liver proliferation and differentiation.
  HNF-6, HNF-1β and the Notch/Jagged signaling pathway induce differentiation toward
  a biliary epithelial lineage, while HNF-4α followed by C/EBPα produces mature hepatocytes.
