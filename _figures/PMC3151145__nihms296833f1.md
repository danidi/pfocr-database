caption: Cholesterol synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by HMG CoA reductase
  (HMGCR) or internalized via scavenger receptors (CD36, SR-A) or low density lipoprotein
  receptor (LDLR), is assembled into nascent rafts in the Golgi apparatus for caveolin-
  and Niemann Pick C1 protein (NPC1)-dependent transfer to the plasma membrane. NPC1
  together with NPC2 also regulates endosomal recycling of cholesterol to the plasma
  membrane. In turn, cholesterol is effluxed either by simple diffusion or via transporters
  (ATP Binding Cassette [ABC]A1, ABCG1, SR-BI) to extracellular acceptors (apolipoprotein
  [apo]A-I, high density lipoprotein [HDL]), and also likely equilibrates with non-raft
  regions. Cholesterol esterification is regulated in the cytosol by cholesterol ester
  hydrolase (CEH) and in the ER by acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1).
  Raft cholesterol/abundance and abundance of LPS recognition proteins (CD14, TLR4)
  are regulated by cholesterol flux through this pathway.
