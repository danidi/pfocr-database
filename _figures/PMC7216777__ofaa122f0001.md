caption: 'Metabolic processing of bioactive lipids and their role in host immune response
  to infection. Bioactive lipids are local signaling molecules produced from the metabolism
  of PUFA precursors (eg, AA, DHA, EPA, and LA) released from the phospholipid bilayer
  through the lipase activity of cPLA2. These biologically inert precursors can be
  rapidly further metabolized through several enzymatic pathways to produce hundreds
  of bioactive mediators with distinct biological activity depending on cell types
  and receptor expression patterns in the local environment. For example, AA can be
  metabolized by COX-1/2 and 5-LOX to produce inflammatory mediators including thomboxanes,
  prostaglandins, and leukotrienes, or it can be metabolized by cytochrome P450 and
  12/15-LOX enzymes to produce mediators with anti-inflammatory properties. Similar
  to AA, other PUFA precursors including EPA, DHA, and LA can also be metabolized
  via different enzymatic pathways including the 12/15-LOX pathway, which can lead
  to production of resolvins and protectins, a new class of bioactive lipids associated
  with disease resolution. Abbreviations: 11,12-EET, 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid;
