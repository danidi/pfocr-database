caption: Wiring diagrams of the NFκB signaling system to chart the interdependence
  and functional overlap of nfκb1 and nfκb2 gene products. (A) The NFκB signaling
  system in nfκb2−/− cells. Without its normal binding partner p52, RelB will bind
  p50 to form RelB:p50 dimers, which accumulate in the nucleus. As a result, constitutive
  RelB:p50 activity compensates for the loss of inducible RelB:p52 activity. (B) The
  NFκB signaling system in nfκb1−/− cells. Without its normal binding partner p50,
  RelA will bind p52 causing an increase in constitutive p100 processing and thus
  a depletion of the IκBδ and p100 pool, which is required for RelB:p52 activation.
  Though the canonical pathway is largely preserved in nfκb1−/− cells, compensation
  by p52 weakens the non-canonical pathway.
