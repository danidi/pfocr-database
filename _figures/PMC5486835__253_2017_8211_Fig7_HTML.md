caption: Main upper degradation pathways of ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, and benzoates
  in Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The six model compounds used in this study are indicated
  in bold; names of the enzymes involved in each step of the pathway are shown in
  boxes. Fcs feruloyl-CoA synthase, Ech enoyl-CoA hydratase/lyase, Vdh vanillin dehydrogenase,
  PobA 4-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, VanAB vanillate O-demethylase complex, BenABC
  benzoate dioxygenase complex, BenD 1,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,4-diene-1-carboxylate
  dehydrogenase. Metabolic nodes that can undergo ring cleavage are shown in dashed
  boxes
