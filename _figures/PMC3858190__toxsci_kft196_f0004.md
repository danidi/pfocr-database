caption: 'The pathways involved in sensing and responding to double-stranded RNA and
  other pathogen-associated molecular patterns were suppressed by SMD. Green symbols
  indicate genes the expression of which decreased in response to SMD. Interestingly,
  IFN-β was upregulated (indicated by red or pink color). The basis for this is not
  clear, but IFN-related genes were predominantly downgulated by SMD (). The following
  fold changes were observed comparing the LPS and the LPS + SMD at 300mg/kg groups:
  IFN-α2, −5.6-fold; IFN-α4, +6.4-fold; IFN-α5, no change; IFN-α9, −8.0-fold; IFN-β,
  +12.6-fold; IRF-3, −2.3-fold; IRF-7, −13-fold; STAT1, −8.8-fold; NF-κB (p50), −4.2-fold;
  IL-10, +2.2-fold; IL-6, +6.9-fold; IL-12 (p40), −2.2-fold; ISG-15, −5.4-fold; CD40,
  −3.6-fold; Lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA), no change. This diagram was produced by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software. Abbreviations: IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; IRF,
  interferon regulatory factor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; SMD, sodium methyldithiocarbamate.'
