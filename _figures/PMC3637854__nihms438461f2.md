caption: 'Overview of UPR signaling. Three distinct signaling pathways, originating
  from ER transmembrane proteins, exist in the mammalian UPR: IRE1, PERK, and ATF6.
  Activation of IRE1 results in the unconventional cytosolic splicing of XBP1 mRNA
  and subsequent generation of XBP1(S), an inducer of UPR target genes that include
  ER chaperones, ERAD components and vesicular trafficking genes. Activated PERK phosphorylates
  eIF2α, leading to a global down-regulation of de novo protein synthesis and, paradoxically,
  increased expression of the transcription factor ATF4. ATF4 activates expression
  of genes encoding protein chaperones, ERAD components, enzymes that reduce oxidative
  stress and proteins that function in amino acid biosynthesis and transport. Recently,
  each UPR pathway has been linked to expression of the pro-apoptotic transcription
  factor CHOP. ATF6 is transported to the Golgi apparatus upon activation, where it
  is cleaved by the site 1 and site 2 proteases (S1P and S2P) to generate the cytosolic
  fragment, ATF6(N). ATF6(N) translocates to the nucleus as a functional transcription
  factor that upregulates expression of a variety of genes involved in ER quality
  control processes.'
