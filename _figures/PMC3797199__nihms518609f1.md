caption: Th17/Th22 cells, γδT cells, and RORγt+ ILCs are major cell populations that
  co-express transcription factors Ahr and RORγt in the gut. Ahr ligands can be generated
  from diet (e.g., food containing Tryptophan), microflora (e.g., commensal or pathogenic
  bacteria), and/or host cells. In the gut, Ahr is important for the development of
  intraepithelial γδT cells, which have immune defensive function. Ahr is essential
  for the development and function of intestinal RORγt+ ILCs. Ahr also modulates IL-7/IL-7R
  expression, which confers the survival and maintenance of RORγt+ ILCs. Ahr regulates
  IL-22 expression by RORγt+ ILCs through cooperative interaction with RORγt, which
  directly binds at the Il22 promoter to induce transcription. Ahr controls the transcription
  of Kit that is crucial for RORγt+ ILC development by direct binding at the promoter
  region of the kit. Notch signaling pathway is also involved in the regulation of
  RORγt+ ILC development by Ahr. All the RORγt+ cell populations express IL-23R. An
  active interplay between RORγt+ ILCs and antigen presenting cells (i.e., dendritic
  cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mφ)) through various cytokines (e.g., IL-23, IL-1β,
  and TNFα) is crucial for the development and function of RORγt+ ILCs. RORγt+ cells
  produce large amounts of IL-22 and/or IL-17. Engagement of IL-22R that is expressed
  by intestinal epithelial cells and gut stem cells promotes anti-microbial peptide
  secretion and epithelial regeneration. A potential crosstalk between RORγt+ ILCs
  and Th17/Th22 cells mediated by Ahr may be important for the host to fight against
  bacterial infections, while keeping autoimmunity at bay.
