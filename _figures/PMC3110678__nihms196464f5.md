caption: 'Two different proposed T4HN biosynthetic pathways catalyzed by PKS1. a Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway using mal-CoA as a starter unit and metabolites isolated from

  produced by wild type and TE/CLC less PKS1 by LC-ESI-MS. c Alternative proposed
  mechanism of T4HN (11) formation using acetyl-CoA as a starter unit. *: 14C-labeled
  carbon form acetyl-CoA'
