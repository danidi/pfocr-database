caption: 'Pathways of riboflavin, FMN and FAD biosynthesis in Archaea and Bacteria.
  Alternative ‘archaeal’ and ‘bacterial’ enzymes are shown. Boxes in shades of grey
  show enzymes/transporters that were identified in at least one studied in this work
  archaeal species. White boxes denote bacterial enzymes that lack orthologs in any
  archaeal genome. Metabolic pathway intermediates: I, 2,5-diamino-6-(5-phospho-D-ribosylamino)pyrimidin-4(3H)-one;
  II, 2-amino-5-formylamino-6-(5-phospho-D-ribosylamino)pyrimidin-4(3H)-one; III,
  5-amino-6-(5-phosphoribosylamino)uracil; IV, 2,5-diamino-6-(5-phospho-D-ribosylamino)pyrimidin-4(3H)-one;
  V, 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil; V’, 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil; VI, 3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone
  4-phosphate; VII, 6,7-dimethyl-8-(D-ribityl)lumazine. Bacterial protein/gene names
  are provided as in Escherichia coli (note that in some other bacteria such as Bacillus
  subtilis some of these genes were historically named differently). Supescript ‘N’
  and ‘C’ letters denote N- and C-terminal domains in the bifunctional RibD and RibF
  enzymes. The standard Methanocaldococcus jannaschii protein/gene names are used
  for archaeal enzymes. Functional roles of riboflavin biosynthetic enzymes are listed
  in Table . The RibU transporter from the ECF family was previously characterized
  in a number of Gram-positive bacteria. The RibT transporter from the MFS family
  is predicted in this work as a part of RbkR regulons in Archaea.'
