caption: (A) Depiction of ciliary compartments where many Hh pathway components are
  localized. Ptch1 is found at the base of cilia, around the basal body and the pocket.
  Both Ptch1 and Smo are localized in the ciliary membrane. Smo interacts with the
  Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (EvC) membrane protein complex at the EvC Zone, located
  just distal to the Transition Zone and Transition Fibers. Gli and Sufu are localized
  at cilia tips. (B) A model for the regulation of Gli–Sufu complexes with (left)
  or without (right) KIF7 in the absence of Hh signal activation. Trafficking of Gli–Sufu
  complexes through the cilium licenses them for repressor (GliR) production, leading
  to inactivation of target genes in the nucleus. In the absence of KIF7, GliR production
  is impaired, and thus, its target genes are derepressed.
