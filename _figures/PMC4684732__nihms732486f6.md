caption: Regulatory mechanism of Src activation by HNE. HNE could activate EGFR directly
  through forming conjugate or indirectly through inhibiting PTP1B, which dephosphorylates/inhibits
  pEGFR845. Active pEGFR then activates Src. PTP1B is also involved in dephosphorylation
  of pTyr530Src. Whether HNE inhibits PTPs involved in dephosphorylation of pTyr419Src
  is unknown.
