caption: Simplified schemes of the depression, anxiety and apathy networks in PD.
  Generally, as PD pathology defined by dopaminergic deficiency progresses, the implicated
  neural areas that are associated with mood symptoms involve the prefrontal cortex
  including orbitofrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex and then extend to some
  regions in the anterior temporal and parietal lobes, and subcortical areas. Amongst
  the three mood symptoms, the shared brain regions are mainly within the frontostriatal
  pathway. Blocks in grey refer to the frontostriatal pathway; ACC, anterior cingulate
  cortex; AMG, amygdala; DA, dopamine; HIPP, hippocampus; PCC, posterior cingulate
  cortex; SMC, supplementary motor cortex; SNr, substantia nigra.
