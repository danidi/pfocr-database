caption: An overview of the cellular ageing defects that underlie premature ageing
  disorders, regular ageing and ageing-associated disease. These ageing defects are
  interconnected and include reduced DNA repair pathway efficiency, loss of genomic
  integrity, a global loss of heterochromatin, alterations in metabolic signalling,
  increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria, reduced activity
  of proteostasis-promoting proteolytic pathways and activation of senescence pathways.
  Post-translational processing of wild-type prelamin A by the zinc metalloproteinase
  ZMPSTE24 releases mature wild-type lamin A that is incorporated in the nuclear lamina
  (indicated in the left half of the cell nucleus). In the premature ageing disease
  Hutchinson–Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), the LMNAG608G mutation activates a
  cryptic splice site that results in the formation of a prelamin A isoform lacking
  50 amino acids, including the ZMPSTE24 cleavage site, and is named progerin (indicated
  in the right half of the cell nucleus). Incorporation of this mutant isoform into
  the nuclear lamina distorts the nuclear shape and further contributes to other ageing
  defects shown in the figure (thin arrows indicate dysregulated pathways and mechanisms).
