caption: Cross-talk between apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway, downstream
  of the type I TNFR, is active in aged skeletal muscle and consists of FADD, caspase-8,
  and caspase-3. Cleaved caspase-8 can activate BID, which can interact with Bax and
  promote further pro-apoptotic signaling arising from the mitochondria
