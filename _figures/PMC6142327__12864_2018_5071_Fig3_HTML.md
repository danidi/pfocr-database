caption: 'Plot of the biological network most significantly enriched by the list of
  genes differently expressed between animals subjected and not subjected to a feed
  restriction period: Carbohydrate Metabolism, Cardiovascular System Development and
  Function, Cellular Development. The shape of nodes indicates the functional classes
  of the gene products. The node color indicates the degree of expression: (red) up-regulated
  and (green) down-regulated in the RE group relative to the AL group'
