caption: Potential CRISPR/Cas Applications to Increase Pathogen Resistance(A–E) Depending
  on the repair mechanism the CRISPR/Cas-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) can lead
  to simple mutation of a certain sequence (via the error-prone non-homologous end
  joining [NHEJ] pathway), resulting often in small insertions or deletions (InDels)
  causing frameshift mutations and thereby loss of function (A). Alternatively, in
  the presence of a repair template, the DSB can be repaired via homology-directed
  repair (HDR) allowing the insertion of larger foreign DNA in a genomic locus of
  choice (B) or modification of a target region by introducing mutations of choice
  (C). Single-nucleotide mutations can further be induced by deploying cytosine base
  editors (CBEs) with cytidine deaminase or adenine base editors (ABEs) with adenine
  deaminase activity (D). Larger defined mutations can be induced by prime editing,
  which is based on nCas9 fused with reverse transcriptase depending on prime editing
  gRNA instead of normal sgRNAs (E). For details see text.
