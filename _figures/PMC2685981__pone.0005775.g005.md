caption: Briefly, SCARB1 is responsible for the uptake of cholesterol into cells while
  SRD5A1 converts testosterone to 5-α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a more potent form
  of the male hormone. We propose that increases in the expression of these genes
  may lead to an overall increase in the production of androgens. It is also of interest
  that bile acid synthesis is linked to this same pathway, thereby suggesting that
  altered expression of these genes in ASD may lead to disturbances of bile acid synthesis
  in some tissues as well.
