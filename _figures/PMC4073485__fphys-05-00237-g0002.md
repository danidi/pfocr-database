caption: Possible role of hemichannels in tumor growth and progression. Diagram showing
  the paracrine interactions mediated by the passage of nucleotides and Ca2+ through
  hemichannels between tumor cells (T), lymphocytes (L), and stromal cells (S). The
  image in the upper left corner depicts the tumor microenvironment components with
  intimate relationship between the tumor and non-tumor cells. The expanded inset
  on the right represents a magnification of one tumor area and indicates the signaling
  circuits associated with NAD+ (green text and arrows), ATP (red text and arrows),
  and Ca2+ (blue text and arrows). The image also shows the presence and possible
  interactions between connexin (Cx) and pannexin (Panx) hemichannels, ectonucleotidases,
  purinergic receptors, and adenosine receptors. Arrows with dashed lines indicate
  a positive/stimulatory effect, arrows with continuous lines indicate a negative/inhibitory
  effect; and curved lines indicate (enzymatic) metabolic activity. ADO, adenosine;
  AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; cADPR, cyclic adenosine
  diphosphate-ribose; [Ca2+]i, free intracellular Ca2+ concentration; NAD+, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; P2X7, P2X purinoreceptor 7. See text for detailed explanation
  of the biological consequences of each pathway.
