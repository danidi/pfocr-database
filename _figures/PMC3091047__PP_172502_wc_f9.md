caption: Order of signaling events in hormone-induced flavonol metabolism. A combination
  of auxin- and ethylene-specific and MYB-dependent transcriptional control may explain
  the observed data. TIR1- and ARF-dependent auxin signaling activates the auxin-responsive
  elements of the pathway genes shown, which include F3′H. In parallel, MYB12 is activated,
  leading to further up-regulation of the same pathway genes and PAP1 and TTG1 through
  their MYB-responsive elements. The line between MYB12 and PAP1 and TTG1 is dotted
  based on the complexity of interpreting these mutant data, as described in the text.
  EIN2- and ETR1-dependent ethylene signaling also increases the expression of a subset
  of pathway genes, excluding F3′H, through the activation of ethylene-responsive
  elements. This auxin-specific regulation of F3′H may explain the observed differences
  in the Q/K ratio after treatment with IAA and ACC. [See online article for color
  version of this figure.]
