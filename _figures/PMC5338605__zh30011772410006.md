caption: Modeling NPY-epithelial cross talk that favors cell survival and proliferation
  and inhibits apoptosis. NPY released from the enteric neurons can activate phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase
  (PI3-K) pathway and increase pAkt signals leading to cell survival, and proliferation
  via c-Myc and cyclin D1. In addition, NPY also downregulates miR-375, thereby reducing
  apoptosis. Furthermore, NPY also inhibits p21, which mediates cell cycle arrest
  (G1 to the synthetic S phase). Taken together, NPY-induced enhancement in cell survival
  and proliferation with a concomitant downregulation of apoptosis facilitates inflammation-induced
  tumorigenesis.
