caption: 'HDL biogenesis. Mitochondrial cholesterol transport is rate limiting in
  the (sterol 27-hydroxylase-) dependent generation of oxysterol ligands for LXR (liver
  X receptor) transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes encoding
  proteins in the cholesterol efflux pathway, such as ABC transporters (ATP-binding
  cassette transporters) ABCA1, and ABCG1. These transporters transfer cholesterol
  and/or phospholipids across the plasma membrane to (apo) lipoprotein acceptors,
  generating nascent HDLs (high-density lipoproteins), which can safely transport
  excess cholesterol through the bloodstream to the liver for excretion in bile. Ligand
  activation of nuclear LXRs (liver X receptors) (LXRα/β) is pivotal in cellular response
  to elevated sterol content, triggering cholesterol efflux mechanisms: both synthetic
  and oxysterol LXR agonists potently upregulate ABCA1 and ABCG1 gene expression.
  Consequently, elimination of excess cholesterol can be achieved, in vivo and in
  vitro, by cellular cholesterol efflux, orchestrated by ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG4, and
  passive diffusion along a concentration gradient, and also “acceptor” (apo) lipoproteins,
  such as apoA-I, and HDLs (high-density lipoproteins). Notably, LXRs form heterodimers
  with RXRs (retinoic acid receptors) and bound to the nuclear receptor.'
