caption: Model of translational repression of Nodal pathway components. (a) In early
  zebrafish embryos, Ybx1 represses squint/nodal translation by binding to the translation
  pre-initiation complex proteins and the squint DLE (solid blue box). Squint/Nodal
  translation is activated from late blastula stages by unknown factors. (b) In vegetal
  cells of frog embryos, Bic-C represses xCR1 translation by binding to the translation

  factors (?) to repress Nodal translation in the human placenta. In the absence of
  miRNA-378a-5p, nodal translation is activated.
