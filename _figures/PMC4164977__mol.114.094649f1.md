caption: 'Activation of CB2 receptors by natural or synthetic ligands favors a range
  of receptor conformations that can variably affect different signaling pathways
  in the following ways: 1) inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, decreased cAMP production,
  and less activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), culminating in inhibition
  of A-type potassium channels and inhibition of some gene expression; 2) activation
  of Akt/protein kinase B, stimulating cell survival, migration, and growth; 3) activation
  of the MAPK cascade, favoring cell survival and modulating gene expression; 4) inhibition
  of specific calcium channels and enhanced opening of G protein–gated inwardly rectifying
  potassium (GIRK) channels; 5) stimulation of de novo synthesis of ceramide and inhibition
  of the MAPK cascade, promoting apoptosis; 6) recruitment of β-arrestin to the activated
  CB2 receptor, resulting in desensitization and/or internalization of the receptor
  and potential activation of arrestin-specific signaling; and 7) decreased PKA activity,
  which increases Raf-1 to stimulate the MAPK cascade, positively regulating the expression
  of many genes. + indicates activation of pathway by CB2 receptor agonists; – indicates
  inhibition/downregulation of pathway by CB2 receptor agonists; +/− indicates a variable
  outcome.'
