caption: Proposed model for the interaction between Shh and IGF signaling. Shh binds
  to patched family receptors (PTCH) to releases smoothened (SMO) signal transducer
  from Patched-dependent suppression. Activated SMO, in turn, induces SKT36 serine/threonine
  kinase to stabilize GLI family members for nuclear translocation. Shh signaling
  activates GLI dependent transcription of target genes including N-myc, D-cyclins,
  BMI1, GLI1, Bcl-2, and IRS-1, all of which have been implicated in cell cycle progression,
  proliferation, and stemness. IRS-1, in turn, mediates IGF-IR/PI3K signaling activation,
  which inhibits GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation and consequent increased degradation
  of N-myc and D-cyclins. However, Shh may also activate IGF-IR/PI3K pathway via unknown
  intermediary molecules.
