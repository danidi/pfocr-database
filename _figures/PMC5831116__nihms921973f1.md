caption: The pathway to xenobiotic-induced autoimmunity. We propose that xenobiotic
  tissue damage can lead to the availability of nucleic acids and other damage associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), the
  release of self- and modified self-antigens, the presentation of self-antigens to
  non-tolerant lymphocytes, and the induction of inflammation. Such effects lead to
  the engagement of TLRs and other innate sensors, the production of inflammatory
  cytokines, the contraction of T regulatory cell populations, the expansion of autoreactive
  B and T effector-cell populations, and the production of autoantibodies. These events
  can occur at the site of exposure such as the lungs where they occur in ELS or in
  SLO. In either case the expansion of autoreactive cells and their migration to target
  tissues such as the kidney in SLE results in autoimmune disease. SLO, secondary
  lymphoid organ; ELS, ectopic lymphoid structures; IFN, interferons; TNF, tumor necrosis
  factor; IL, interleukin; Teff, effector T cell; TR, T regulatory cell; aT, autoreactive
  T cell; aB, autoreactive B cell; DC, dendritic cell.
