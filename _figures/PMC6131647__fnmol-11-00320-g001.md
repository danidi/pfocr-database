caption: Schematic illustration of biological process and signaling pathway of NLRP3
  inflammasome and association with CNS disorders. Under the exposure of PAMPs/DAMPs,
  NF-κB is activated, followed by the promotion of the NLRP3 protein as well as proIL-1β
  and proIL-18 production. The assembly and formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome through
  the combination of NLRP3, ASC, and procaspase-1 triggered by further stimulation
  leads to the production of caspase-1, which catalyzes the transformation from proIL-1β
  and proIL-18 into IL-1β and IL-18. The production and release of IL-1β and IL-18
  induces various forms of inflammatory reaction, thus contributing to the pathogenesis
  and progression of CNS diseases. The process of NLRP3 inflammasome activation can
  be blocked by several kinds of NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitors, which serve as potential
  therapeutic strategies against CNS disorders.
