caption: Known Hsp70 functions used to design the biological testing of the Hsp70
  inhibitors in cancer cells. Hsp90 in concert with Hsp70 maintains the transforming
  capacity of several oncoproteins whose aberrant activity leads to increased cell
  proliferation and survival. The function of the Hsp90 protein complex requires the
  HSP-organizing protein (HOP), involved in the formation of the active chaperone
  complex. Altering the formation of the Hsp90–HOP–Hsp70 complex leads to degradation
  of the oncoprotein via a proteasome-mediated pathway and is associated with cell
  growth inhibition and/or cell death. To confirm an Hsp70-mediated mechanism, it
  is expected that compounds will be active at similar concentrations in this battery
  of assays.
