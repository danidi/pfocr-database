caption: Schematic of the AcSDKP/FGFR1/MAP4K4 pathway suppression of TGFβ/smad signaling
  and EndMT. In endothelial cells, the close proximity between AcSDKP and FGFR1 increased
  FGFR1 and induced its phosphorylation levels. Interacting with co-factor FRS2, FGFR1
  recruited MAP4K4 and induced its phosphorylation. Subsequently, p-MAP4K4 suppressed
  integrinβ1 (integrinβ1 should be localized on the cell surface interacted with some
  of α integrins). Integrinβ1 was a potent activator of TGF-β signaling and also EndMT.
  Therefore, AcSDKP could inhibit EndMT through FGFR1-MAP4K4-dependent manner
