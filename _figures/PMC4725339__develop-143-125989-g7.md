caption: Model for the neurogenic pathways defined in this work. SoxC was previously
  identified as being dependent on Six3. SoxC expression is activated in isolated
  neural precursors by unidentified factors and cell signaling mechanisms (dotted
  arrow). Cells expressing SoxC are dividing (circular arrow) and at least some express
  Delta and are subject to lateral inhibition. SoxC is required for the development
  of neurons expressing serotonin and Tph (upper pathway) and also for all other neurons
  expressing SynB (lower pathway). SoxC is required for expression of Brn1/2/4 in
  both pathways; SoxC is transiently expressed and some cells are observed to contain
  both mRNAs. Brn1/2/4 also is transiently expressed, and in later embryos some Brn1/2/4-expressing
  cells also express the differentiated marker SynB. Z167 is expressed only in developing
  serotonergic neurons (upper pathway) and is essential for their development. Its
  position in the hierarchy relative to Brn1/2/4 remains to be defined, but Z167 is
  likely to function in parallel or downstream.
