caption: 'A model of Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex-mediated
  inside-out and outside-in signaling pathways. An enormous number of signaling pathways
  are integrated within cells. Outside-in signaling pathways, which originate within
  the cytoplasm or extracellular environment and terminate within the nucleus, can
  be roughly categorized into two groups. In the first pathway, mechanical stimuli
  are directly transferred to the nucleus via the LINC complex. The second pathway
  utilizes transcription factors such as Yes-associated protein (YAP) and megakaryoblastic
  leukemia 1 (MKL1) that shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus through the
  nuclear pore complex (NPC). More importantly, the nucleus also plays a role as an
  information submission source. Inside-out signaling results in the transfer of signals
  from the nucleoplasm to the cytoplasm across the nuclear envelope (NE). SUN domain:
  Sad1/UNC-84.'
