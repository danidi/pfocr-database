caption: Mitochondrial mediated immune functions and cell signaling. Mitochondria
  can release molecules such as N-formyl peptides, mtDNA, ROS, and cardiolipin that
  initiate an immune response and related signaling pathways. N-formyl peptides are
  released and act as chemoattractants for neutrophils, binding to the FPR-1 receptor
  and promoting their activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including
  TNFα, IL-1β, and IFNγ. MtDNA fragments (e.g. when the mtDNA is damaged by ROS) released
  from the organelle can also bind TLR9 receptors on neutrophils and likewise initiate
  the NF-κB pathway and release of TNFα and additional cytokines. Mitochondrial anti-viral
  signaling (MAVS) located on the outer membrane can be activated by viral RNA and/or.
  ROS, also triggering activation of the NF-κB pathway and the release of interferon
  regulating factors (IRFs). Additionally, MAVS can promote the oligomerization and
  activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome which triggers Caspase-1 cell death pathways
  and the activation of the pro-inflammatory forms of IL-1β and IL-18. In addition
  to being activated by MAVS, NLRP3 can also be activated by ROS, mtDNA, and cardiolipin.
