caption: Consequence of post-translational modification of viral and host proteins
  during geminiviral pathogenesis. Virus-encoded TrAP inhibits plant defense responses
  either by modulating the derubylation of CUL1 (removal of RUB, a ubiquitin-like
  protein, from CULLIN in the active E3 ubiquitin ligase complex inactivates its E3
  ligase activity) or by attenuating the degradation of the SAMDC1 enzyme. However,
  the βC1 protein impairs the ubiquitin degradation pathway and hormonal (jasmonic
  acid and giberellic acid) signaling by interacting with the E2 conjugating enzyme
  (UBC3) and SKP1, respectively. Also by inhibiting the kinase activity of MPK4 and
  MKK2, βC1 protein can possibly prevent the phosphorylation of the target proteins.
  Furthermore, the NSP is phosphorylated by PERK, which potentiates virus infection
  by an unknown mechanism. The C1 protein probably helps with virus replication by
  modulating the SUMOylation of PCNA. Additionally, the C1 protein interacts with
  histone mono-ubiquitination machinery (UBC2 and HUB1) to facilitate the transcription
  of viral genes.
