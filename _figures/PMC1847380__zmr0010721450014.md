caption: Signaling pathways leading to pseudohyphal growth. Nitrogen starvation is
  sensed by Ras2, which controls the expression of the cell surface flocculin Flo11
  via two distinct pathways, the cAMP-dependent PKA pathway (in blue) (AC, adenylyl
  cyclase) and the MAPK pathway (in green). PKA activates the transcriptional activator
  Flo8 and inactivates the transcriptional repressor Sfl1, both of which contribute
  to the increased expression of Flo11. Ras2 somehow activates Cdc42, which activates
  the MAPK cascade via its effector, Ste20. The MAP kinase Kss1 inactivates the repressors
  Dig1 and Dig2, thereby allowing Ste12 and Tec1 to activate the expression of Flo11
  as well as of other proteins involved in cell elongation. As in budding and mating,
  Cdc42 regulates polarized actin organization via its effectors (in red), thereby
  contributing to the elongated cell morphology. In response to the nitrogen starvation
  signal, Sok2 negatively regulates the expression of the transcription factors Phd1
  and Swi5, which activate Flo11 expression directly or via the daughter cell-specific
  transcription factor Ash1. The two transcription factors Swi5 and Ace2 activate
  the expression of the endoglucanase Egt2 and the endochitinase Cts1. Decreased expression
  of these key enzymes that are required for cell separation after cytokinesis causes
  cell attachment during filamentous growth.
