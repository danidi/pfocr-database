caption: mtDNA is more susceptible to damage than nuclear DNA; mtDNA mutations have
  been associated with aging and neurological disorders, as well as several cancers.
  The main role of the mitochondria is to produce cell ATP. This process is based
  on OXPHOS, and ROS generation is a by-product of this process. The cAMP/PKA signaling
  pathway can regulate the activity of OXPHOS through its interaction with AKAP proteins
  in the mitochondrial membrane, while SIRT proteins, sirtuins, play a fundamental
  role in restoring homeostasis during stress responses. In fact, sirtuins condition
  the activity of the NF-κB pathways and the failure of the recovery of homeostasis
  causes many chronic and acute inflammatory diseases that are connected to altered
  glycolysis and to the oxidation of fatty acids, at least in part, by the function
  which is dependent on the NAD + of the sirtuins. Oxidative stress and inflammation,
  which contribute to endothelial dysfunction in healthy elderly subjects, are the
  factors, which are absolutely important for the development of glaucoma. Aging is
  associated with endothelial dysfunction in humans, probably linked to an elevated
  expression of ET-1 and cyclooxygenase.
