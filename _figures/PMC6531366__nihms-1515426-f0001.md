caption: The gut microbiome and immune gene pleiotropy along the gut-brain axis in
  schizophrenia. The proposed model illustrates an overview of microbial dysbioses
  leading to systemic inflammation and permeabilized blood-gut and blood-brain barriers
  in HLA-susceptible individuals. As resident microbes translocate into circulation,
  the immune response, as initiated by the complement pathway, is activated. With
  access to the brain, gut-derived molecules can enter, signaling astrocytes (orange)
  and microglia (green) to respond to invaders. Subsequent complement expression in
  the vicinity of neurons (purple) may render susceptible synapses to inappropriate
  pruning.
