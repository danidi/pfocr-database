caption: A) Folate metabolism inthe methionine synthesis pathway. The gene trap discussed
  in this paper was inserted into an intron in the gene encoding for Methionine Synthase
  Reductase (MTRR shown in red), which activates Methionine synthase. B) Heterozygous
  Mtrr mice (shown in red) were crossed with wild-type mice (shown in black) and their
  progeny were examined for developmental delays and embryonic defects. A consistent
  percentage of embryos exhibited embryonic defects (shown in blue) for up to four
  generations, despite being genetically wildtype. Wild-type crosses yielded no defects
  (right).
