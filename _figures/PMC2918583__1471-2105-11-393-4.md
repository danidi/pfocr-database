caption: 'Isolated reaction-location relationship revision. Protein SLC27A2 is in
  both peroxisomes (X) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and it can catalyze two reactions:
  R03631 and R04580. R03631 is the only reaction in endoplasmic reticulum in the Phytanic
  acid peroxisomal oxidation pathway while there are other reactions connected with
  R04580 in endoplasmic reticulum in the Bile acid biosynthesis pathway. This strongly
  suggests that SLC27A2 may only catalyze R03631 in peroxisome but not in endoplasmic
  reticulum.'
