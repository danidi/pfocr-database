caption: '(A) DCs are located throughout the respiratory tract. They are most abundant
  in the nose, nasal turbinates, and trachea. As shown by the sliding scale at right,
  the density of lung DCs declines as one descends the respiratory tract. (B) Two
  subsets of cDCs are present: an intraepithelial web of CD103+ cDCs (blue) and CD11bhi
  cDCs (orange) in the lamina propria, together with pDCs (yellow). The alveoli are
  lined with type I and type II alveolar ECs (peach). AMs (purple) form the main population
  of resident alveolar cells, whereas neutrophils can be recruited in response to
  inflammatory stimulation. Both cDC subsets are present in the alveoli and migrate
  to the draining LNs (right), where they present antigens to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
  CD103+ cDCs are specialized in cross-priming as CD8α+ LNRDCs (red).'
