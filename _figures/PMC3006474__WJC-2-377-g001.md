caption: 'Etiology of mechanisms involved in coronary vascular dysfunction in diabetes.
  Increased oxidative stress is the unifying element common to all pathways through
  which the various mechanisms described interact to cause endothelial dysfunction
  and cardiomyopathy in diabetes. Hyperglycemia acts directly through the glycation
  of the scavenger enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and other antioxidant enzymes,
  and indirectly through the cross activation of advanced glycation end product (AGE)/advanced
  glycation end product receptor (RAGE) interaction and of the polyol pathway. The
  latter raises the NADH/NAD+ ratio, modifying the redox state of the cells and leading
  to the production of superoxide anions. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) has been
  shown to affect intracellular insulin signaling, promoting insulin resistance and
  consequently impairing the insulin-mediated endothelial function in coronary arterioles.
  The insulin-resistance mediated endothelial dysfunction can be restored by the activation
  of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ by thiazolidinediones and rosiglitazone.
  Then, if we consider diabetes as a chronic, subclinical inflammatory disease, it
  acts through TNF-α and Interleukin (IL)-6, increasing the cellular oxidative stress.
  AGE/RAGE interaction and hyperglycemia can in turn activate the diacylglycerol (DAG)-protein
  kinase C (PKC) pathway, thus promoting fibrosis, myofilament desensitization, and
  apoptosis, and finally leads to diabetic cardiomyopathy. TnI: Troponin I; TnT: Troponin
  T.'
