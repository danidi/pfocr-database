caption: Regulation of HIF pathway. Under normoxia, PHDs (PHD1, PHD2 and PHD3) and
  factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH) hydroxylate the HIF-1α and HIF-2α.
  This hydroxylation facilitates HIFα binding to the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex, leading to fast ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. During
  hypoxia, PHDs and FIH are inhibited by the absence of oxygen, in consequences, hypoxia
  reduces HIFα hydroxylation and leading to HIFα stabilization and activation. Once
  stabilized, HIFα subunit is translocated to the nucleus, where formed a complex
  with HIF-1β, then recruit coactivator p300/CBP, and upon binding to the consensus
  hypoxia response elements (HRE) within target genes, involved in a large type of
  processes, as cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, cell survival,
  migration, apoptosis or angiogenesis.
