caption: Structures of Slit/Robo, and the Slit-Robo signaling pathway. (A) The Robo
  receptor contains five immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig), three fibronectin type
  III domains (FN3), and four conserved cytoplasmic domains (CC). Slit is a secreted
  glycoprotein and a major ligand of the Robo receptor. Slit contains four domains
  consisting of leucine-rich repeats (LRR), several EGF-like sequences, a laminin-G
  domain (LamG), and a C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (CRD). The LRR2 domain of Slit
  interacts with the Ig1 and Ig2 domains of Robo, and the SH3 domain of srGAPs and
  Abl kinase interacts with the CC3 domain of Robo. (B) The extracellular interaction
  between Slit and Robo increases the binding of srGAP with Robo, resulting in the
  activation of srGAP. Activated srGAP induces GTP hydrolysis of Cdc42, and therefore
  inactivates Cdc42. Inactivated Cdc42 is unable to stimulate actin polymerization
  via the downstream effector of Cdc42 (N-WASP). This in turn leads to actin depolymerization
  and repulsion of the axon. (C) Binding of Slit to Robo results in the interaction
  between Abelson (Abl) and Cable, which leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin
  by Abl. This phosphorylation reduces the affinity between β-catenin and N-cadherin,
  and attenuates N-cadherin-mediated adhesion.
