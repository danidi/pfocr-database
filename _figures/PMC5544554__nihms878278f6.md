caption: In KRAS mutant NSCLC, acquired resistance to ganetespib is initiated by hyperactivation
  of ERK, which in turn augments the expression of master switch, p90RSK. p90RSK hyperactivation
  then leads to hyperactivation of the mTOR pathways as well as induces G2/M progression
  via overexpressing and activation of CDC25C and subsequently its targets – Cyclin
  B1 and cdc2. Targeted inhibition of p90RSK or CDC25C induced synthetic lethality
  in GR cells. Based on these results, this model illustration proposes that combination
  of HSP90i, ganetespib with inhibitors of p90RSK (BI-D1870), or CDC25C (NSC-663284
  or NSC-95397) may prevent ganetespib resistance and/or help overcome the resistance
  after single agent treatment.
