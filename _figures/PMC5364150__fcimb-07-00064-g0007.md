caption: Shigella modulates the innate immune response in epithelial cells. NFκB can
  be activated via many pathways during Shigella infection, including genotoxic stress
  during invasion and recognition of the lipopolysaccharide on the bacterial surface.
  This may explain the redundancy of Shigella effectors, many of which have the ability
  to interfere with these pathways, leading to efficient inhibition of NFκB. IpgD
  increases levels of PI5P, which activates PI3K and Akt and inhibits p53 and caspase
  3. OspC3 sequesters the p19 pre-cursor of caspase 4, which prevents its heterodimerization
  with p10 and inhibits capase 4 activation. OspI deamidates Ubc13, which inhibits
  ubiquitination of TRAF6 and prevents activation of the TRAF6-NFκB pathway. IpaH0722
  ubiquitylates TRAF2, leading to its proteasomal degradation and preventing recruitment
  of IKK and activation of NFκB. Polyubiquitination of NEMO/IKKγ is dependent on IpaH9.8
  binding to A20 binding inhibitor of NFκB (ABIN-1), leading to proteasomal degradation
  of NEMO/IKKγ, activation of IκBα, and inhibition of NFκB. IpaH9.8 also localizes
  to the nucleus where it catalyses ubiquitination of U2AF35, leading to its degradation
  and consequently reduced il-8 expression and decreased neutrophil recruitment. By
  an unknown mechanism, OspG prevents SCFβ−TrCP from ubiquitinating IκBα, preventing
  degradation of IκBα and activation of NFκB. OspZ blocks the nuclear translocation
  of p65, a subunit of NFκB, thereby inhibiting activation of NFκB. Threonine desphosphorylation
  of MAPKs by OspF leads to inactivation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways and inhibition
  of histone H3 phosphorylation (H3pS10). This produces an inaccessible chromatin
  conformation at the gene promoters of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, meaning
  NFκB cannot activate their transcription.
