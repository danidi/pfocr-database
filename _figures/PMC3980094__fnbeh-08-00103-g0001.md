caption: '(A) Simplified scheme of the organization of cortico-basal ganglia networks
  (cortical, striatal, pallidal and thalamic areas) showing the direct and indirect
  pathways in normal brains. (B) Specific degeneration of the indirect pathway (X)
  in HD leads to a decrease in inhibitory control over cortical functions. GPe: external
  globus pallidus; GPi: internal globus pallidus; STN: subthalamic nucleus. Red: inhibitory
  (GABA) pathways, Blue: excitatory (glutamate) pathways.'
