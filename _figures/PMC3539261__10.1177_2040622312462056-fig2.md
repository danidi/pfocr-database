caption: Initiation of the inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals (MSU)
  by the innate immune system. MSU are recognized as danger-associated molecular patterns
  (DAMPs) by innate immune receptors, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), on monocytes.
  A dual signaling process begins. One pathway, involving the adapter protein used
  by TLRs, MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88), leads to translocation
  of activated NFκ-β (nuclear factor κ-β) to the nucleus where it activates transcription
  of pro-IL-1β. Simultaneously, phagocytosis of MSU and processing by the phagosome
  and lysosome results in assembly and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a cathepsin-B
  and K+ flux dependent fashion. As a result, pro-caspase-1 is cleaved to active caspase-1,
  which in turn cleaves the nascent pro-IL-1β to its active form, which is secreted
  into the cellular milieu. (IL-18 is released in a similar fashion.) Binding of IL-1β
  to its receptors on local macrophages and synoviocytes activates a signaling pathway
  that includes MyD88 and IRAK-4 (ILR1-receptor associated kinase), resulting in NFκ-β
  activation and translocation to the nucleus. There, NFκ-β mediates transcription
  of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, thus greatly amplifying the original
  danger signal. Other cells are recruited to the area, including neutrophils, and
  a full blown attack of gout ensues. ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a CARD; CARD, caspase recruitment domain.
