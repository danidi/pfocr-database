caption: (A) The interaction network was generated with the Ingenuity software and
  shows that many genes from the NANOG pathway are up-regulated (red) in day 3 embryos.
  (B) Top-ranked functional networks in which are involved transcription factors (GATA2
  and GATA3), or genes that regulate steroidogenesis (including HSD1B3), DNA repair
  (TDG and BRCA1) or epigenetic modifications (including DNMT3L) and that are up-regulated
  in TE samples. The color intensity indicates their degree of up-regulation. Uncolored
  genes were identified as not differentially expressed by our analysis, but were,
  nevertheless, integrated into the computationally generated networks on the basis
  of the evidence stored in the IPA knowledge memory indicating a relevance to this
  network. In each network, nodes indicate genes, a plain line indicates direct interaction,
  a dashed line indicates indirect interaction; a line without arrowhead indicates
  binding only; a line with an arrowhead indicates “acts on”.
