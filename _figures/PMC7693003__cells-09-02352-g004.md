caption: The association between FDFT1 and cell death. FDFT1 is directly or indirectly
  associated with apoptotic signals. FDFT1 could directly activate NF-KB pathways
  or activate AKT through cholesterol synthesis. Activated NF-KB increases anti-apoptotic
  proteins, such as Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bax and decreases pro-apoptotic proteins such
  as caspase-3, thereby blocking apoptosis signalling. In cancer cells with deficient
  squalene epoxidase, high expression of FDFT1 increased intracellular squalene levels,
  which protects the cell membrane from lipid peroxidation by ROS and further prevents
  the cell from entering the ferroptosis pathway. Furthermore, FDFT1 inhibition upregulates
  endogenous geranylgeranoic acid (GGA) content, which has been demonstrated to cause
  incomplete autophagy, and a decrease in cholesterol level also activates autophagy.
