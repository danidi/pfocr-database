caption: Model for the participation of MCP-1, TNF-α, MMP-9, E-cadherin, and β-catenin
  in macrophage fusion. IL-4 induces activation of at least two pathways including
  the JAK/STAT pathway (JAK1/JAK3 and STAT6), leading to induction of E-cadherin,
  β-catenin, MCP-1, TNF-α, and MMP-9. Studies in DAP12-null macrophages suggest that
  DAP12 signaling is essential for programming macrophages into a fusion-competent
  state. MCP-1–null macrophages are deficient in cytoskeletal remodeling and have
  low levels of TNF-α and MMP-9 but induce E-cadherin and β-catenin normally. This
  implies that part of the JAK/STAT pathway is intact in MCP-1–null cells and that
  at least two divergent pathways are involved in fusion. Addition of TNF-α to MCP-1–null
  macrophages in a fusion experiment induces MMP-9 expression and restores the fusion
  defect. It is suggested that a link between the two pathways exists based on the
  effects of MCP-1 and MMP-9 deficiency on the subcellular localization of E-cadherin
  and β-catenin.
