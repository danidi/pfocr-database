caption: 'Post-Golgi sorting in conventional cell types and melanocytes: The role
  of HPS proteins as well as VPS33B in vesicle trafficking is demonstrated. These
  proteins affect the synthesis of lysosomes and LROs in the endocytic pathway. The
  different BLOC protein complexes cause the accumulation of melanosomes in different
  stages during melanosome biogenesis. Other proteins (e.g. Rab27a) can affect lysosome
  maturation at other subcellular sites (interaction with the cytoskeleton). ER =
  Endoplasmatic reticulum, TGN = trans-Golgi network, BLOC = biogenesis of lysosomerelated
  organelle complex. Adapted from Li et al. [].'
