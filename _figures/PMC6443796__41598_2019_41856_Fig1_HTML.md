caption: Schematic representation of the tna operon regulatory pathway in Escherichia
  coli. Rectangles represent chemical species, black incoming (outgoing) arrows represent
  production or intake (degradation or output), and blue lines represent regulatory
  interactions. Blue lines ending in arrows (hammer-heads) denote positive (negative)
  regulation. The regulatory pathway is as follows. tna mRNA is produced via transcription
  of the tna genes. tna mRNA is further translated to synthesize proteins TnaA and
  TnaB. Permease TnaB transports tryptophan (Trp) into the cell, while enzyme TnaA
  metabolises it. Furthermore, tryptophan inhibits protein Rho, which prematurely
  terminates transcription of the tna genes. Finally, glucose down-regulates transcription
  initiation via catabolite repression.
