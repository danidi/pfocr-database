caption: GSK3 is a key regulator of axon growth and branching. Axon growth is thought
  to be initiated by activation of cell surface receptors upon recognition of extrinsic
  cues, such as growth factors or other ligands. GSK3 has been suggested as a key
  molecule downstream of the PI3K pathway and the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)
  pathway to control axon growth and/or branching. Upon activation of PI3K, GSK3 becomes
  inactivated, leading to dephosphorylation of GSK3 substrates that control the stability
  and dynamics of axonal microtubules. Dephosphorylation and subsequent binding of
  adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) on microtubule plus ends at certain locations along
  the axon enhances axonal branching, whereas its enrichment at the growth cone leads
  to the promotion of axon growth. CLASP, another substrate of GSK3 that binds to
  microtubules in response to GSK3 inactivation, plays a role to regulate axon growth
  downstream of GSK3. CLASP can both promote and inhibit axon growth depending on
  its microtubule-binding activity, a property which is tightly controlled by GSK3
  activity. The cGMP pathway is another pathway that has been shown to control axonal
  branching. In response to elevation of cGMP by activation of guanylyl cyclase (GC),
  cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PrkG) becomes activated and functions to increase
  axon branching by inactivating its substrate GSK3. In addition to the direct regulation
  of the kinase activity, GSK3 activity can be controlled by other mechanisms, such
  as regulation of its expression level. JNK-interacting protein (JIP) 3 has been
  suggested to control the expression level of GSK3 at the transcription level and/or
  by regulating mRNA stability. Down-regulation of JIP3, which decreases GSK3 level,
  increases axonal branching by controlling the phosphorylation status of doublecortin
  (DCX), a substrate of GSK3. Coordinated regulation of multiple GSK3 substrates likely
  defines the extent of axon growth and the locations at which axonal branching occurs.
