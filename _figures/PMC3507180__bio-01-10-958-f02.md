caption: Focusing on mRNA microarray data, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used
  to identify the HNF-4α signaling network in spherical FLC-4. Gray arrows and gray
  lines indicate regulation of gene expression and protein interactions respectively.
  Gray and white colors depict upregulation and downregulation of gene expression,
  respectively. Circles delimitate molecular functions of genes that were classified
  manually. The gene expression of SREBF1 and HNF4A were measured by real-time RT-PCR.
