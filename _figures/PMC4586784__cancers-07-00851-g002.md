caption: 'Modes of signaling in Hh pathway-dependent cancer. (A) Type I: ligand-independent,
  tumour cell-intrinsic signaling tumours exhibit mutations in the Hh pathway components
  that promote cell-intrinsic growth and survival. Loss of function mutations in Ptch1
  (red cross), activating mutations of Smo and GliA amplifications (yellow stars),
  are common in these tumours. (B) Type II: ligand-dependent, autocrine stimulation
  is characterized by the response to the Hh ligand that is self-secreted. (C) Type
  III: ligand-dependent, paracrine signaling is defined by the secretion of the Hh
  ligand from the tumour cells that acts on adjacent stroma, in turn creating a favourable
  microenvironment for tumour growth. (D) In contrast, in Type IIIb ligand-dependent,
  reverse paracrine signaling, the Hh ligand is secreted by the adjacent stroma and
  acts on the tumour cells.'
