caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic pathway to lankacidin C. The gene cluster, which has
  been shown to be sufficient for lankacidin biosynthesis, encodes five assembly-line
  proteins, LkcA (a hybrid NRPS/PKS subunit), LkcB (a discrete DH), LkcC, LkcF, and
  LkcG, together containing a total of only four KS domains, although eight KS-mediated
  extension cycles are required. One possibility that agrees with phylogenetic analysis
  of KS substrate specificity is shown here, in which the assembly-line incorporates
  multiple copies of the proteins LkcB, LkcC and LkcF (see ref.  for an alternate
  view). The starter unit may be either pyruvoyl-ACP or lactoyl-ACP, both derived
  from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. However, we and others have found that in an LkcE-deleted
  mutant, only the lactoyl form of the first free intermediate LC-KA05 accumulates
  (Supplementary Fig. ), so we propose that lactoyl-ACP serves as the starter unit.
  The enzyme responsible for acetyl transfer at C-7 likewise remains to be determined,
  although a candidate is LkcH, which shows homology to isochorismatases. The object
  of this study, LkcE, catalyzes the critical macrocyclization reaction of LC-KA05
  (1), resulting in lankacidinol A (2). The carbons implicated in the ring closure
  are indicated in red. Domain abbreviations: C, condensation; A, adenylation; PCP,
  peptidyl carrier protein; KS, ketosynthase; DH, dehydratase; KR, ketoreductase;
  MT, C-methyltransferase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; TE, thioesterase'
