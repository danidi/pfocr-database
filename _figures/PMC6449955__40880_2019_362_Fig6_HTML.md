caption: Metabolic rewiring of FLT3/ITD-mutated cells resistant to sorafenib. The
  resistant cells exhibit an increase in glycolytic activity, accompanied by a perturbed
  TCA cycle and inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway, which may contribute
  to reduced proliferation of the resistant cells. GSH biosynthesis is increased in
  order to counteract the oxidative stress and to maintain a redox balance in a dynamic
  state. G6P glucose-6-phosphate, R5P ribose-5-phosphate, TCA tricarboxylic acid,
  GSH glutathione
