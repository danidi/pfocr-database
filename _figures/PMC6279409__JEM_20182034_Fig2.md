caption: Cnbp regulates IL-12β gene transcription, IL-12 production, and Th1 immunity.
  Cnbp resides in the cytosol of macrophages and translocates to the nucleus in response
  to diverse microbial pathogens and pathogen-derived products through the TLR–MyD88–IRAK–TAK1
  signaling pathway. Cnbp has a selective ability to control the activation of c-Rel,
  a key driver of IL-12β gene transcription. The nuclear translocation and DNA binding
  activity of c-Rel require Cnbp. Furthermore, Cnbp itself binds the IL-12β promoter.
  Principally through its IL-12–augmenting activity in APCs, Cnbp enhances the Th1-mediated
  IFN-γ response to acute toxoplasmosis to control parasite replication.
