caption: Schematic representation of Pi, Zn, and Fe homeostasis interactions in plants.
  The cross-talks between phosphate (Pi), zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) nutrients are shown
  at the physiological level by two-way arrows. For the molecular bases of the Pi–Zn–Fe
  cross-talks, the PHR1 acts as a potential integrator of Pi, Zn, and Fe nutrient
  signals in plants. Firstly, the PHR1 was defined as a key regulator of the expression
  of Pi transporters PHT1 and PHO1; H1 through the PHR1–miR399–PHO2 pathway (see ).
  Secondly, ZIP2 and ZIP4 genes, belonging to plant ZIP gene family, are transcriptionally
  induced via the activated PHR1 transcription factor binding to the P1BS (GNATATNC)
  sequences found in the promoter regions of their genes. Under Zn sufficiency, the
  bZIP19/23 transcription factors are inactivated, and bZIP19/23-mediated Zn regulatory
  pathways repress the plant ZIP gene family transporters in order to regulate Zn
  homeostasis. On the other hand, PHO1;H3, which is transcriptionally down-regulated
  by high Zn supply, and the PHR1 and PHO1 proteins contribute to the Pi–Zn nutrient
  homeostasis cross-talk. In addition, the transcriptional activation of some genes
  involved in maintaining Fe homeostasis is also shown to be PHR1-dependent manner,
  including the FER1 gene encoding the Fe storage protein ferritin, and the PHO1;1
  gene encoding Pi transporter. The arrows and flat-ended lines indicate the positive
  and negative interactions, respectively.
