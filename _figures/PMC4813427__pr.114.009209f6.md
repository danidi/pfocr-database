caption: Summary of NOP receptor signaling. Figure cartoons the basic NOP receptor
  signal transduction and trafficking pathways highlighted in this review, and those
  that have generally been shown by multiple studies. Figure shows NOP receptor canonical
  coupling to inhibition of calcium channels, and activation of inward rectifying
  potassium channels. Figure also highlights recent work showing NOP receptor activation
  of MAPKs, and desensitization pathways via GRK3 and GRK2, and recent data showing
  that NOP receptors can both positivity and negatively influence cytokine/inflammatory
  pathway signaling. Furthermore, the cartoon depicts recent papers showing that NOP
  receptor activation and arrestin signaling can initiate downstream signaling to
  JNK and ROCK pathways. Arrows refer to activation steps; T lines refer to blockade
  or inhibition of function.
