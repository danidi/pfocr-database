caption: Proposed pathway for biosynthesis of diazaquinomycin’s side rings. Proposed
  model to explain the molecular basis for the distinct DAQ derivatives produced by
  Micromonospora sp. B006 and Streptomyces sp. F001. We hypothesize that DaqNB006
  preferentially accepts malonyl-ACP (or malonyl-CoA) and a branched-chain fatty acyl-CoA
  or acetyl-CoA monomer as substrates, whereas DaqNF001 preferentially accepts malonyl-ACP
  (or malonyl-CoA) and a straight-chain fatty acyl-CoA monomer. DaqU, which is present
  only in strain F001 would preferentially accept methylmalonyl-ACP (or methylmalonyl-CoA).
  CoA, coenzyme A. ACP, acyl carrier protein.
