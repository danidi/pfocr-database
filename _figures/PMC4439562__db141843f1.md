caption: 'Cytokine and hormone signaling through JAK-STAT pathways. In the canonical
  JAK-STAT signaling cascade, there are four JAKs, 1–3 and TYK2, seven STATs, 1, 2,
  3, 4, 5a, 5b, and 6, as well as multiple inhibitors or SOCS1–7, CISH, as well as
  PIAS. In this complex multimember pathway, cell-type specificity is dictated by
  which family members are present, and which ones are preferred to others. A: Rodent
  β-cells. For example, as illustrated for prolactin in rodent β-cells on the left
  side of the figure showing canonical JAK-STAT signaling, prolactin or placental
  lactogens bind the dimeric PRLR. PRLR preferentially couples to JAK2, which phosphorylates/activates
  STAT5a/b. Phosphorylated STAT5a/b dimers then transit to the nucleus and bind to
  promoters of relevant genes such as cyclin D2 to drive proliferation. Rodent β-cells
  also contain the dimeric GHR and EPO receptor, which presumably acts via a similar
  mechanism(s). On the right half of the figure, examples of noncanonical signaling
  via the PRLR or GHR are illustrated. The major point here is that in addition to
  activating canonical pathways, cytokines and hormones can also engage MAPK and PI3K
  signaling pathways discussed in more detail in other figures. B: Human β-cells.
  Much less is known regarding human β-cell PRL and EPO signaling. PRL and PL fail
  to activate adult human β-cell proliferation, for reasons that remain unclear. JAK2
  and STATs 5a and b are present, as is menin. Several SOCS members, CISH, and PIAS1
  are present in human β-cells. Other components of the system present in rodent β-cells,
  including inhibitors of JAK-STAT signaling, such as SOCS, CISH, and PIAS1, have
  not been studied. Gray lines are molecules and pathways that are known to exist
  in rodents but are unknown in human β-cells.'
