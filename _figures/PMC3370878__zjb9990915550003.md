caption: Schematic view of the two different oxalate assimilation stategies. (A) Oxalate
  assimilation by a variant of the serine cycle, including operation of oxalyl-CoA
  synthetase and oxalyl-CoA reductase. (B) Oxalate assimilation via C1 units by the
  serine cycle and EMC pathway, without oxalyl-CoA synthetase and oxalyl-CoA reductase.
  Precursor metabolites are labeled in red; for abbreviations, see  legend.
