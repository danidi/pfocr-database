caption: 'Summary of flowering regulation by ambient temperature and e[CO2]. Solid
  black and red arrows represent definite positive and negative interaction, respectively
  whereas broken black and red arrows depict plausible positive and negative interactions,
  respectively. Ambient temperature regulates FT expression by different mechanisms
  including PIF4 dependent and independent pathways. Warmer night temperature could
  induce early morning flowering by accumulating PIF4, PIF5 which regulate CO mediated
  FT expression. Heat stress may affect flowering events by hampering carbon metabolism
  and sugar signaling or by inducing floral repressor HvODDSPC2. Conversely, e[CO2]
  may directly regulate FT expression through floral repressor FLC or alternatively,
  positive impact of e[CO2] on carbon metabolism and sugar signaling may induce flowering
  pathway genes by suppressing FLC expression. Major flowering pathways genes affected
  by temperature and e[CO2] are represented in the box in the center. Abbreviations:
