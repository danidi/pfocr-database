caption: 'Ferroptosis modulation in tumor. Small molecules such as erastin, sorafenib,
  glutamate, and sulfasalazine induce ferroptosis by inhibiting system Xc- and impeding
  cysteine uptake, which could result in a subsequent decline of glutathione and a
  decrease of cells’ anti-oxidative ability. mucin 1 C-terminal (MUC1-C) binds with
  CD44v to promote stability of the system Xc−. The cysteine level can also be supplemented
  by cellular methionine via the sulphur-transfer pathways. GPX4 can prevent ferroptosis
  by suppressing cellular lipid peroxides and the mevalonate (MVA) pathway is crucial
  for its maturation and the products of it (IPP and CoQ10) can promote synthesis
  of GPX4. Treatment FIN56 modulates squalene synthase (SQS) to reduce CoQ10. Ferroptosis
  inducer RSL3 can suppress GPX4 directly to regulate ferroptosis. The p62-Keap1-Nuclear
  factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway is able to regulate Nrf2-targeted
  genes such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), and NAD(P)H:
  quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) against ferroptosis. CISD1, PHKG2, and IREB2 are
  important in regulating iron metabolism and ferroptosis. Ironchelators can inhibit
  ferroptosis. The HSPB1 also impedes ferroptosis by inhibiting increase of intracellular
  iron. In addition, p53 also regulate ferroptosis through inhibiting SLC7A11 and
  promoting lipid peroxides production. BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; FTH1, ferritin
  heavy chain 1; HSP, heat-shock protein; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; MUC1-C, mucin 1
