caption: Engineering of P450s to Create Novel Reactions and their Potential Applications.The
  missing steps within the taxol metabolic pathway are indicated with a dotted line,
  and P450s are suggested to be involved in these steps. Two pathway P450s, T5αH and
  T10βH, which have substrates similar to those of the missing P450s (indicated with
  red backbone), are suitable for engineering to acquire new activities that can fill
  the pathway gap.
