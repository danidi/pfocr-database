caption: Key hallmarks of the ferroptotic pathway of cell death. Green and red indicate
  protectors and promoters of ferroptosis, respectively. Purple indicates chemical
  modulators of the ferroptosis pathway. Lipid peroxidation (LP) commonly occurs following
  the excessive production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS activate
  phospholipase (PLA) enzymes, which then assist in the cleavage of poly-unsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) from membrane phospholipids. Liberated PUFAs are catabolized
  via the enzymatic action of lipoxygenase proteins, such as arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase
  (ALOX15), non-enzymatic Fenton reactions, or autoxidation. Acyl-coenzyme A (Acyl-CoA)
  synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) assists in sensitizing cells to ferroptosis
  by virtue of its role in lipid biosynthesis. Together with lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), these lipid remodeling enzymes can generate and incorporate,
  respectively, long chain PUFAs in cell membranes, the key substrates for peroxidation.
  Transferrin transports iron into the cell, which promotes lipid peroxidation, while
  System Xc− imports/exports cystine and glutamate amino acids in and out of the cell,
  respectively. Once within the cell, cystine is converted to cysteine and together
  with nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) supports glutathione (GSH)
  synthesis. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity is regulated by GSH and offers
  a first line of protection against ferroptosis by virtue of its reduction of both
  ROS and lipid peroxides. Interactions between ferroptosis-suppressor-protein 1 (FSP1),
  ubiquinone (CoQ10), and nitrate reductase (NAD(P)H) provide additional protection
  against ferroptosis by reducing lipid peroxidation. However, in the event that lipid
  peroxidation exceeds that of the intrinsic cellular defenses, a ferroptotic cell
  death ensues. Ferroptosis can be experimentally induced by erastin, which interferes
  with mitochondrial function and accentuates ROS production, or by disrupting system
  Xc− function. Alternatively, ferroptosis can be promoted by RSL3, a selective GPX4
  inhibitor. Ferroptosis can also be inhibited with deferoxamine which disrupts iron
  activity. Image created using BioRender.com.
