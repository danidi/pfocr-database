caption: TGFβ-treated cells generate traction forces which are required to remodel
  the extracellular matrix and to disseminate in 2/3D environment. This requires the
  activation of the Rho/ROCK pathway and actomyosin function. The Ral pathway controls
  the dissemination of TGFβ-treated cells by modulating RhoA-dependent actomyosin
  contractility via the interaction between the Sec5 subunit of Exocyst and the RhoGEF
  GEF-H1.
