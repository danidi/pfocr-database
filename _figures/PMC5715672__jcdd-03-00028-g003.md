caption: Pathway of catecholamine biosynthesis. Synthesis of epinephrine and norepinephrine
  is regulated by catecholamine synthesizing enzymes. Synthesis of catecholamines
  starts with conversion of phenylalanine to l-tyrosine, which is converted to l-dopa
  by tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). l-dopa is processed to dopamine by l-aromatic amino
  acid decarboxylase (AAAD), from where norepinephrine is formed by dopamine-β-hydroxylase
  (DBH). Finally, epinephrine is synthesized by addition of a methyl group to norepinephrine
  by phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT). Norepinephrine and epinephrine
  both act as neurotransmitters for sympathetic innervation.
