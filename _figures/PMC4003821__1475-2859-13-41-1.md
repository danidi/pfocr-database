caption: Schematic diagram of metabolic pathways for S.spinosa. The NADH/NADPH generation
  and consumption are showed in red. The enhanced pathway is showed in blue (solid
  line represents gene overexpression, dotted line means possible enhanced pathways).
  The weakened pathway is showed in purple.
