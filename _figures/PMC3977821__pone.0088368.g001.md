caption: 'Flux is expressed as a molar percentage of the specific glucose uptake rate
  of 9.5−1 h−1. Open arrows indicate the flux toward biomass. For reversible reactions,
  the direction of the net flux is indicated by a dashed arrow. The errors given for
  each flux reflect the corresponding 90% confidence intervals. The full flux data
  set is presented in Supporting Information. Metabolic and isotopic steady states
  were ensured by constant stoichiometry, kinetics, and the constant 13C-labeling
  patterns of recruited metabolites during cultivation (see , ). The abbreviations
  are as follows: Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP), Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMPP),
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glyoxylate (Gly) shunt, tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, and pyruvate metabolism.'
