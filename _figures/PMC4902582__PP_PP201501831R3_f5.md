caption: 'Metabolic profiling of miR858OX and MIM858 transgenic lines. The schematic
  diagram shows the phenylpropanoid pathway. Heat maps indicate log2-transformed values
  of the concentrations of metabolites in rosette tissue of wild-type (WT), miR858OX,
  and MIM858 transgenic plants (for values, see ). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass
  spectrometry analysis was performed with the methanolic extracts of dried rosette
  tissues. Arrows indicate the order of steps in the pathway; dashed arrows represent
  multiple enzymatic steps. The main enzymes are as follows: PAL, Phe ammonia lyase;
  C4H cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′ hydroxylase;
  FLS, flavonol synthase; DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; UGT78D1, flavonol 3-O-rhamnosyltransferase;
  UGT78D2, flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase; 3GRT, flavonol-3-O-glucoside l-rhamnosyltransferase;
  HCT, p-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate shikimate p-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase; C3H,
  p-coumaroyl ester 3-hydroxylase; COMT I, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase of class
  I; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase;
  CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; F5H, ferulic acid 5-hydroxylase. MYB transcription
  factors are shown in green and red (green for activation and red for inhibition).
  Likewise, the green arrow is for activation and the red arrow is for inhibition.'
