caption: Signaling pathways triggered by TLR3, TLR4 and TLR1–TLR2. (A) The TLR4–MD-2
  complex engages with LPS on the cell surface via LBP and CD14 (data not shown) and
  then recruits a TIR domain-containing adapter complex including TIRAP and MyD88.
  The TLR4–MD-2–LPS complex is subsequently trafficked to the endosome, where it recruits
  TRAM and TRIF adapters. (B) TIRAP–MyD88 recruits IRAK family members and TRAF6 to
  activate TAK1. (C) The TAK1 complex activates the IKK complex composed of IKKα,
  IKKβ and NEMO (IKKγ), which catalyze phosphorylation of IκB proteins. Phosphorylated
  IκB proteins are degraded, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus. (D) TAK1
  simultaneously activates the MAPK pathway. The activation of NF-κB and MAPK results
  in induction of inflammatory cytokine genes (MyD88-dependent pathway). TRAM–TRIF
  recruits (E) TRAF6 and RIP-1 for activation of TAK1 as well as (F) TRAF3 for activation
  of TBK1–IKKi that phosphorylates and activates IRF3. Whereas NF-κB and MAPK regulate
  expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in both pathways, IRF3 regulates expression
  of type I IFN in the TRIF-dependent pathway only. (G) TLR3 resides in the endosome
  and recognizes dsRNA. It recruits TRIF to activate the TRIF-dependent pathway. (H)
  TLR1–TLR2 recognizes bacterial triacylated lipopeptide and recruits TIRAP and MyD88
  at the plasma membrane to activate the MyD88-dependent pathway.
