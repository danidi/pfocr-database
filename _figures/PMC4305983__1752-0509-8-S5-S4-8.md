caption: Qualitative predictions of consequences of gene knockdown. The simplified
  aspartate-family biosynthesis pathway enlarged from Figure 4. Metabolites (AdoMet,
  S-adenosyl-methionine; Ala, alanine; Arg, arginine; Asn, asparagine; Asp, aspartate;
  AspSA, aspartate-semialdehyde; Cit, citrate; CisAc, cis-aconitate; Cys, cysteine;
  CysTA, cystathionine; DHDP, dihydrodipicolinate; Fum, fumalate; Gln, glutamine;
  Glu, glutamate; Gly, glycine; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; Hcys, homocysteine; HSer,
  homoserine; His, histidine; Ile, iso-leucine; IsoCit, iso-citrate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
  Leu, leucine; Lys, lysine; Mal, malate; Met, methionine; OAc, oxaloacetate; OPH,
  O-phosphohomoserine; Orn, ornitine; Phe, phenylalanine; Pro, proline; Pyr, pyruvate;
  Ser, serine; Suc, succinate; SucCoA, succinyl CoA; Thr, threonine; Trp, tryptophan;
  Tyr, tyrosine; Val, valine) are represented in black letters whereas the knocked-down
  gene (mto2, MTO2 encoding threonine synthase) is represented in green letters. Two
  squares boxes indicate the comparisons between experimental results (the former)
  and in silico prediction (the latter).
