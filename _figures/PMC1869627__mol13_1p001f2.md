  description: 'A pathway diagram developed using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis
    and Knowledge Base in which all genes changed by more than 1.5 fold were queried.
    This diagram shows one of the relational networks in which all up-regulated genes
    (green) were those related to astrocyte structure or function. This network is
    very significant with a score of 40, which means that the association by chance
    alone is less than 99.99%. Those genes with a significant increase in fold change
    in our study are shaded green, while those with a decrease are shaded in red.
    In the diagram, the vertical diamond shape represents an enzyme, a horizontal
    diamond is a peptidase, downward pointing triangle is a kinase, horizontal rectangle
    is a nuclear receptor, the oval a transcription factor, and the round other genes.
