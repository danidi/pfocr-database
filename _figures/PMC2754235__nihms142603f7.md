caption: A model suggesting how NO and PKG might be utilized by Drosophila to sense
  and respond to hypoxia. Unknown upstream factors might sense oxygen levels and affect
  levels of NO. Alternatively, the pathway might be activated at different levels
  in response to hypoxia. Our data suggest that the NO/PKG pathway influences multiple
  responses (depicted at the bottom of the figure) to hypoxia in Drosophila. The responses
  were altered by genetically or pharmacologically activating or inhibiting the pathway
  (manipulations are shown boxed in gray). Note that the pathway shown (dashed line)
  is inferred from the pathway established in other systems.
