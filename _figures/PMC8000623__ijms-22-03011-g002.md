caption: Summary of survival tactics of MAH within phagocytes from host innate immune
  effectors MAH infection. Six representative survival strategy of MAH for a series
  of processes after macrophage phagocytosis was presented. I. Protection from oxidative
  stress. In the early stages of macrophage infection, MAH expresses genes resistant
  to oxidative stress. II. Inhibition of phagosome maturation. MAH proteins expressed
  in the early stages of infection hijack host trafficking proteins, and interfere
  with their actions, eventually delaying the maturation of the endosome. III. Blocking
  phagosome-lysosome fusion. MAH proteins regulate phagosome membrane or block phagosome-lysosome
  fusion. IV. Release of OMV for sustained infection. MAH releases infection maintenance
  substances such as TDM synthase, SOD, catalase, catalase peroxidase, ahpC, PE /
  PPE family protein, and eDNA through OMV. V. Induction of immune cell death. MAH-infected
  macrophages produce TNF, Fas, and TLR-dependent ROS, thereby activating caspase
  8 through ASK1/p38 MAPK signals, activating caspase 9 through mitochondrial death
  signaling, or ER stress-mediated IRE1α-RIDD pathway. And eventually undergo cell
  death. VI. Infection of bystander macrophage. When cell death is induced, the vacuole
  membrane loses its integrity, and MAH relies on Brownian motion to meet the macrophage
  cytoplasmic membrane and transfer to the cytoplasm. Eventually, highly invasive
  MAH can escape macrophages or bacteria remaining in the apoptic body can be taken
  up by bystander macrophages. ahpC, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase; AP3B1, subunit
