caption: Pathways for acetyl-CoA assimilation. (A) Glyoxylate cycle. The key enzymes
  are isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. (B) Ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway. The unique
  enzymes of the pathway are crotonyl-CoA carboxylase/reductase, ethylmalonyl-CoA/methylmalonyl-CoA
  epimerase, (2R)-ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase, (2S)-methylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase,
  mesaconyl-CoA hydratase, (3S)-malyl-CoA/β-methylmalonyl-CoA lyase, and (3S)-malyl-CoA
  thioesterase. The enzymes involved in the (apparent) malate synthase reaction(s)
  are boxed for each pathway.
