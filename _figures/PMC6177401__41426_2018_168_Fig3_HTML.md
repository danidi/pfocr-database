caption: 'a Type I IFN signaling (green): Binding of type I IFN to IFNα/β receptors
  (IFNARs) stimulates IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression that results in antiviral
  activity. These cytokines bind to on the surface of nearby or infected cells, activating
  the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway.
  JAK1 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) lead to phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT1
  and STAT2, which forms a complex with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). The
  complex will translocate to the nucleus where they induce transcription of ISGs
  by the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). b Complement pathway (blue): Recognition
  of DENV by the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) complex will induce complement activation.
  Cleavage of C4 and C2 by MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP-2) make the C3 convertase
  and initiates the classical complement cascade, including the formation of C5 convertase
  and the C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC) to induce lysis, recruitment of phagocytes,
  and inflammation. c NS1 binding to TLR4 will induce vascular damage (purple)'
