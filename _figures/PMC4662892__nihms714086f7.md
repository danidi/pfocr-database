caption: Proposed opposing modulation of the AMPK pathway for energy homeostasis by
  utilizing the AMPK pathway. All genes listed in the pathway were identified as being
  oppositely modulated in X. maculatus females and male skin following 16 kJ/m2 UVB
  irradiation. The modulated genes were not only located linearly within the ucp3
  to AMPK pathway, but in addition other genes were found to be oppositely modulated
  within pathways known to be linked to AMPK lending support to the data. Within these
  oppositely modulated genes the pfk-2 gene helps regulate the uptake and replenishment
  of glucose. Through glut4, ROS trigger mst1 and feed into the FoxO pathway ultimately
  leading to muscle atrophy.
