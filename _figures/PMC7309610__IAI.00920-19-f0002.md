caption: Innate immune pattern recognition of bacterial lipids on OMVs leads to inflammation
  and death. Lipid A and cardiolipin (CL) are constituents of OMVs that engage pattern
  recognition receptors on membranes and in the cytosol of host cells. The LPS molecules
  carried by OMVs interact with a variety of proteins and systems. Lipid A components
  of these LPS molecules activate proinflammatory cytokine production and trigger
  an inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis. Once released, OMVs (Step 1) can
  enter host cells through endocytosis (Step 2). In the bloodstream, OMVs interact
  with the circulating plasma protein, LPS-binding protein, or LBP (Step 3), which
  extracts a single LPS molecule from the micelle. LBP binds to soluble CD14 (sCD14)
  and membrane-anchored CD14 molecules. Interactions with LBP, CD14, and LPS result
  in the remodeling and presentation of the lipid A disaccharolipid component of LPS
  to MD-2 (Step 4). MD-2 interacts with lipid A by a sandwich-like mechanism, which
  influences TLR4 receptor dimerization and activation. CL can also interact with
  the TLR4/MD-2 complex on the surface (Step 5) and can act as an agonist or antagonist.
  Dimerization of TLR4/MD-2 (Step 6) recruits different adaptor proteins that will
  activate transcription factors such as nuclear factor κβ (NFκβ) and interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) (Step 7), which will ultimately result in production of proinflammatory
  cytokines (inactive pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18) and type I interferon (IFN-β) (Step
  8). Type-I IFN also induces the expression of caspase-11 (Step 9). The production
  of type I IFN after TLR4 activation enhances the expression of cytoplasmic proteins,
  such as Interferon-related GTPase-10 (IRGB10) and guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs),
  which bind pathogen vacuoles and LPS molecules on cytosolic bacteria and OMVs (Step
  10), and might facilitate endosome lysis or release of LPS molecules, and ultimately
  lipid A endotoxins, for detection by caspases-4/5/11. NOD receptors bind peptidoglycan
  fragments on OMVs and activate late inflammatory responses to pathogens (Step 11).
  Binding of the lipid A disaccharolipid by caspases-4/5/11 promotes autoprocessing
  and activation (Step 12). Activated caspase-4/5/11 cleaves gasdermin D, which causes
  gasdermin D to oligomerize and form large pores in the plasma membrane that alter
  ion homeostasis and cause cell lysis (Step 13). The NLRP3 noncanonical inflammasome
  is activated by an unknown signal that is downstream caspase-4/5/11 activation by
  lipid A molecules (Step 14). Signals received by NLRP3 activate autoprocessing of
  caspase-1 and activation of the canonical inflammasome. Active caspase-1 cleaves
  IL-1β and IL-18, as well as gasdermin D, which result in robust proinflammatory
  cell death, or pyroptosis (Step 15). The dual activation pathway combines the canonical
  and noncanonical inflammasomes and is specific to innate immune cells, which we
  have attempted to depict here.
