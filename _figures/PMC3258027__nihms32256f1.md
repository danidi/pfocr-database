caption: IPK and IPS metabolic pathways. Activation of phospholipase C triggers the
  conversion of phosphatidyinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PI(4,5)P2, to the second messenger
  I(1,4,5)P3. Originally discovered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, pathway I has been
  shown to exist in Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, and Rattus norvegicus.
  This pathway is initiated by the 6-/3-/5-kinase (Ipk2) that sequentially phosphorylates
  I(1,4,5)P3 to generate I(1,3,4,5,6)P5. Evidence supports the existence pathway II
  in Homo sapiens and Zea mays and occurs through a four step conversion of I(1,4,5)P3
  to I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 through the activities of and IP3 3-kinase (IP3K), IP4 5-phosphatase,
  a I(1,3,4)P3 5-/6-kinase, 5-kinase of Ipk2 respectively. In either pathway, a 2-kinase
  (Ipk1) converts I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to IP6 while also performing additional “branch”
  reactions. Inositol pyrophosphate synthase activities (IPS) generate high-energy
  pyrophosphate species PP-IP4 and PP-IP5.
