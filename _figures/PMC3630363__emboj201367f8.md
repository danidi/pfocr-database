caption: Temporal restriction of the Cdk1/Cdc5/Mus81 pathway outside S phase is important
  for genome integrity. Following genotoxic stress, SUMO- and ubiquitin-modification
  drive error-free DNA damage tolerance by potentiating the formation and resolution
  of damage-bypass sister chromatid junctions in the proximity of replication forks.
  In checkpoint-deficient cells, premature activation of the Cdk1/Cdc5/Mus81 pathway
  induces precocious processing of damage-bypass SCJs, thereby increasing the chances
  both for faulty template switching and for resolution with crossover outcome. While
  in physiological conditions the Cdk1/Cdc5/Mus81 pathway acts in G2/M on junctions
  that primarily involved the sister chromatid and whose processing with or without
  crossover is genetically silent, the premature activation of this pathway by oncogene
  activation or DDR/DDT mutations contributes to the crossover-associated genome rearrangements
  characteristic of cancer cells.
