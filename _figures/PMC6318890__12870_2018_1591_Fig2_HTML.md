caption: Schematic summary of the wheat heading stage regulatory network. Before vernalization,
  VRN2 competes with other CCT-domain proteins (like CO2) to interact with NF-Y transcription
  factors to inhibit the transcription of VRN3. Secondly, TaGRP2 can directly bind
  to this binding site of VRN1 to prevent transcript accumulation. Thirdly, TaVRT-2
  can directly bind to the CArG box of the TaVRN1 promoter in vivo to inhibit its
  activity, and this inhibition is enhanced by VRN2. Following vernalization, VRN1
  transcripts were enhanced by changing the ratio of H3K4me3 to active gene transcription.
  However, the expression level of VRN2 decreases after vernalization to release VRN3,
  then they can move from the leaves to the apices via the phloem. In the stem apical
  meristem, the VRN3 protein then forms a functional protein complex with TaFDL to
  bind the CArG box domain in the promoter of VRN1 in vitro, leading to transcriptional
  activation. Meanwhile, phosphorylated VER2 (VER2-P) transfers into the nucleus and
  then gathers in the shoot tips and young leaves, physically interacting with the
  RNA-binding protein TaGRP2, which is O-GlcNAc-modified,to decrease the inhibitory
  action on VRN1 expression. Furthermore, the expression levels of TaVRT2 and VRN2
  decrease, and VRN1 gradually accumulates. Finally, the expression level of VRN1
  is significantly enhanced to accelerate flowering. VRN-D4, as a duplicated copy
  of VRN1, expresses in the leaves and accumulates after prolonged exposure to low
  temperature, and can directly or indirectly influence VRN1 among the three vernalization
  genes the earliest, but has less effect than Vrn-A1. Long-day (LD) induces the accumulation
  of physiologically active Pfr (PHYB:PHYC heterodimers and PHYC:PHYC homodimers)
  and then activates the transcription of PPD1 and circadian clock output genes CO2/TaDH1,
  and the VRN3 transcript can be promoted by PPD1 and CO2. However, PPD1 is inhibited
  by WPCL1, which is a flowering negative regulator, but the interaction mechanism
  of these two genes is unknown. TaGI, which is controlled by the circadian clock
  under a light/dark cycle, works on the upstream of CO and produces a bulky protein
  complex with other suspected proteins, binding to the critical region in the CO
  gene promoter to induce its transcription. Eps genes work throughout wheat growth
  and development via an unknown pathway, Green arrows represent promotion, red arrows
  represent inhibition in the signal pathway
