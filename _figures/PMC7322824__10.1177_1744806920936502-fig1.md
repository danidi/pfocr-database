caption: 'STRING connectivity network analysis identified protein–protein interactions
  between cullin 2 (CUL2), egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (EGLN1), ring-box
  1 (RBX1), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), transferrin receptor (TFRC), and phosphofructokinase,
  liver type (PFKL). Nodes represent all proteins produced by a single protein coding
  gene locus. Edges represent specific or meaningful associations. Known or predicted
  3D structures are presented within the nodes. Color of the edges connecting the
  nodes represents the types of evidence supporting the connections: predicted gene
  neighborhood (green), predicted gene fusions (red), known interactions from experimental
  evidence (pink), co-expression (black), and text-mining (green).'
