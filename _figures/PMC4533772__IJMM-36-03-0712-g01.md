number: Figure 2
caption: 'Analyses of interactions among SHR-specific genes. Interactions among SHR-specific
  genes isolated when the rats were 3 and 6 weeks old were analyzed using IPA. The
  figure shows the gene-to-gene correlations identified. Genes were represented as
  nodes and the biological relationship between 2 nodes was represented as an edge
  (line). Edges signified different correlation''s: solid lines represent direct interactions
  or associations and dotted lines represent indirect interactions or associations.
  Nodes were displayed using various shapes that represented the functional class
  of the gene product (refer to IPA for detailed node information). The 15 nodes on
  the left represented SHR-specific genes isolated at 3 weeks of age and the 21 nodes
  on the right represented SHR-specific genes isolated at 6 weeks of age. Interactions
  among SHR-specific genes were represented as orange edges and direct interactions
  between G-1 and G-2 genes were indicated by (i–v). Interactions after proposing
  the presence of Jun were represented as green edges. Nodes colored light blue represented
  BP-regulating genes categorized into GO:0003013 (circulatory system process) by
  DAVID () and/or categorized into cardiovascular disease (hypertension) by IPA ()
  at 6 weeks of age. SHRs, spontaneously hypertensive rats; SHRSP, stroke-prone SHRs;
  IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; BP, blood pressure.'
