caption: Phytochemicals inhibit the NF-κB pathway. Chemopreventive compounds are able
  to suppress NF-κB activity by inhibiting its nuclear translocation. NF-κB is normally
  associated with its inhibitor IκB. The activation of IKK leads to IκB phosphorylation
  and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Thus, NF-κB is released and translocates
  to the nucleus, where it is able to bind consensus sequences that lead to the transcription
  of pro-survival, inflammatory, and angiogenic molecules. Widely used phytochemicals
  are able to interfere with NF-κB activation, mostly by targeting IKK activity and
  decreasing the phosphorylation of IκB.
