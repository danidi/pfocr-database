caption: The signaling pathway from the upstream protein-tyrosine kinases, Lyn/Syk/Btk,
  to cytokine gene expression through intermediate signaling proteins, PKCβI/JNK.
  For the sake of simplicity, potential contribution of PKCα and PKCβII to JNK activation
  is omitted here. Signaling proteins are depicted in bold letters and nonprotein
  messengers in plain letters. Direct signal transmission by catalytic function is
  indicated by solid lines and indirect transmission by dashed lines.
