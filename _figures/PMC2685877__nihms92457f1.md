caption: 'Briefly, the Phagocytosis Phase is characterized by the uptake of WGPs by
  gastrointestinal macrophages that are associated with M cells within the gut-associated
  lymphoid tissue (GALT) near the Peyer’s patches. The Processing and Priming Phase
  is characterized by the migration of macrophages from GALT to lymphoid organs, including
  spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. WGPs also stimulate DCs for IL-12 and TNF-α
  production. During this time, the particulate β-glucan WGPs are digested and small
  soluble β-glucan is released, which primes neutrophils in a CR3-dependent manner.
  The Innate Effector Phase is characterized by the egress of β-glucan-primed neutrophils
  to the tumor in the response to C5a within the tumor milieu. Anti-tumor mAbs or
  natural Ab binds to tumor-associated antigens (TAA) to initiate the classical pathway
  of complement activation, leading to iC3b deposition on tumors. β-Glucan-primed
  neutrophils can engage iC3b-opsonized tumor cells for cytotoxicity. The Adaptive
  Effector Phase is characterized by the activation and maturation of immature DCs
  by WGPs. The combined WGP with antitumor mAb therapy eradicates tumors and releases
  tumor antigens. Immature DCs that capture tumor antigens are activated by WGPs.
  WGPs also stimulate DCs for IL-12 production. Maturated DCs in turn activate antigen-specific
  CD4 and CD8 T cells to eradicate residual tumors. PMN: polymorphonuclear leukocytes'
