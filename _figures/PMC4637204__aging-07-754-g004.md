caption: The interactive developmentally and evolutionary conserved Notch, TGF-beta/BMP,
  Jak/Stat, p38, oxytocin/MAPK, and mTOR signaling pathways control function of tissue
  stem cells and change with age in ways that interfere with tissue maintenance and
  repair. Experimental modulation of these pathways enhanced the tissue regenerative
  capacity in old mammals. Beginning clockwise from top left. TGFβ and BMP pathway
  increase with age and activate pp38, transient inhibition of which is sufficient
  to restore myogenic potential in muscle stem cells. TGFβ and BMP also separately
  act through SMADs, inhibiting these SMADs was also found to rescue from some of
  the negative effects of these pathways pathogenic activation with age. JAK/STAT
  is a cytokine receptor pathway that increases with age. Many inflammatory cytokines
  act through this pathway. Inhibition of this pathway restores muscle satellite cell
  symmetric expansion. Delta/Notch signaling decreases with age, the activation of
  which in old muscle restores its regenerative potential. Oxytocin signaling decreases
  with age, restoring this signaling improves aged muscle satellite cell function.
  These intracellular signaling pathways are highly interactive. TGFβ acts through
  SMADs to influence downstream cytokine production which act on the Jak/Stat pathway,
  and SMAD3 and the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) interact directly to form a
  complex in the nucleus that binds to specific DNA sequences []. The MAPK/ERK pathway
  is activated by oxytocin, and the MAPK pathway is known to activate Notch signaling
  []. There is crosstalk between TGFβ signaling, Jak/Stat, and Erk1/2 mediated through
  mTOR.
