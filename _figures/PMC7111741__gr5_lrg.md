caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of proteins significantly altered in heat stressed
  pigs. Red, up-regulated proteins; green, down-regulated proteins significantly;
  white, proteins known to be in the network but were not identified in our study.
  The colour depth shows the magnitude of the change in protein expression level.
  The shapes are suggestive of the molecular class(i.e., protein family). Lines connecting
  the molecules indicate the relationship between molecules. Dashed lines demonstrate
  indirect interactions, and solid lines demonstrate direct interactions. The arrow
  styles demonstrate specific molecular relationships and the directionality of the
  interaction. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
  the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
