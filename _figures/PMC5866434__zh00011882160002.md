caption: Effect of CO on cellular inflammation pathways. CO has been implicated in
  the downregulation of inflammatory pathways. CO can inhibit the production of the
  proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α) and upregulate anti-inflammatory
  cytokine IL-10, through a mechanism dependent on activation of the MKK3/p38 MAPK
  pathway. Additionally, CO has been shown to modulate the trafficking and activation
  of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) at the plasma membrane. CO has been proposed as an
  inhibitor of NOD-, leucine rich region- and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome
  activation, through the stabilization of mitochondria, leading to modulation of
  mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and inhibition of mtDNA release, key
  triggers for inflammasome activation under proinflammatory conditions.
