caption: Schematic depiction of the major pathways involved in signaling through the
  ALK-MYCN axis in neuroblastoma (NB). ALK signals downstream mainly through the RAS-ERK1/2
  MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway, as well as through the PI3K/AKT and JAK/STAT pathways,
  resulting in increased MYCN transcription and cell growth (straight dashed lines).
  Signaling through Trk neurotrophin receptors is also shown. MYCN transcriptional
  activity positively feeds the pathway by promoting ALK transcription (curved blue
  dotted lines), whereas transcriptional activity mediated by the MAPK nuclear effectors
  negatively feed-back the MAPK pathways by promoting the transcription of MAPK phosphatases
  (MKP) genes (curved red dotted line). Straight solid lines indicate direct dephosphorylation
  of protein substrates by MKPs or by other dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs).
  Dephosphorylation of MAPKs by MKPs is well documented, whereas evidence on the dephosphorylation
  of STATs or Trks by other DUSPs is limited. See text for more details.
