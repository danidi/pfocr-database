caption: Many receptors modulate Wnt signalling. Frizzled proteins are considered
  the main Wnt receptors. The outcome of the Wnt-Frizzled interaction is determined
  by co-receptors. Thus, Wnt/Frizzled/LRP activates the canonical β-catenin/TCF signalling
  pathway, which itself can be modulated by other cell surface proteins (e.g., binding
  of R-spondins to LGR receptors enhances canonical Wnt signalling). The presence
  of PTK7 or ROR inhibits β-catenin/TCF signalling. It has been suggested that, in
  addition, these co-receptors promote PCP signalling. However, the underlying mechanism
  remains unknown. Some receptors such as Ryk are thought to function independently
  of Frizzled.
