caption: Swi6 promotes the stable association of nascent heterochromatic transcripts
  to sites of RNA synthesis by its ability to bind to H3K9me and RNA. The association
  of Swi6 with the nascent transcript is required for the subsequent assembly of RNAi
  complexes (RITS and RDRC/Dcr1) on the RNA, probably by helping to tether the RNA
  to chromatin. Swi6-mediated tethering may also be required for targeting of heterochromatic
  transcripts for degradation by the TRAMP/exosome pathway. SHREC2 binds to H3K9me
  via its Chp2 component, targeting the H3K14 deacetylase Clr3 and CHD ATPase Mit1
  to heterochromatin, which are required for limiting Pol II access to heterochromatin.
