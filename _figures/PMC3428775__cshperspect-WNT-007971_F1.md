number: Figure 1
caption: Feed-forward network of stem cell transcription factors. Three transcription
  factors—Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog—bind to one another’s gene regulatory regions and
  control expression of one another’s gene products. Downstream targets (genes X,
  Y, Z) stimulate pluripotent cell self-renewal through the functions of X, Y, and
  Z gene products. (The figure is modeled after those by  and .)
