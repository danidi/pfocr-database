caption: HH ligands (SHH, DHH or IHH) bind to the PTCH receptors (PTCH1 and PTCH2)
  and relieve the inhibition of SMO. HHIP, a negative inhibitor of HH signaling, can
  compete with PTCH receptors to bind HH ligand, resulting in the attenuation of HH
  signaling. SMO then transduces signals through the cytoplasmic SUFU-GLI complex,
  resulting in the activation and nuclear translocation of the downstream GLI transcription
  factors (GLI1-3). STK36 further promotes activation and nuclear accumulation of
  GLI by antagonizing SUFU. KIF7 regulates GLI-mediated transcription both positively
  and negatively through physical interaction with GLI and regulating the stability
  and degradation of GLI proteins.
