caption: Biotin de novo biosynthesis pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Biotin is
  composed of an ureido and a tetrahydrothiophene ring (shown in cyan) fused to a
  valeric acid chain (shown in yellow). The five final steps of de novo biotin synthesis
  are carried out by Bio1, Bio6, Bio3, Bio4, and Bio2. Origin of pimelic acid remains
  elusive in S. cerevisiae (indicated by question mark(?)). Pimeloyl‐CoA formed by
  Bio1 is converted via 8‐amino‐7‐oxonanoate (KAPA) to 7,8‐diaminopelargonate (DAPA)
  by Bio6 and Bio3. DAPA is subsequently converted by Bio4 to dethiobiotin and finally
  to biotin by Bio2. The intermediate KAPA and biotin can be imported via the membrane
  transporters Bio5 and Vht1, respectively. In the absence of biotin, the regulator
  Vhr1 upregulates expression of genes encoding the transporters Vht1 and Bio5 as
  well as Bio2. In iron and amino acid rich conditions the transcriptional regulator
  genes AFT1 and GCN4 are transcriptionally repressed, which under iron and amino‐acid
  scarce conditions would not activate transcription of BIO3, BIO4, and BIO2 and relieve
  BIO5 expression. Metabolites, proteins, positive, and negative regulators are shown
  in bold, blue, green, and red, respectively [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com]
