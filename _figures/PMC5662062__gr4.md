  that can slow or halt DNA replication leading to replication stress. These include
  dNTP depletion, DNA lesions (such as thymidine dimers), DNA secondary structures,
  and DNA:RNA hybrids. In all of these circumstances, the replicative helicase uncouples
  from the DNA polymerases, causing the accumulation of ssDNA and triggering replication
  stress-response. (B) The mammalian (top panel) and trypanosomatid (bottom panel)
  models for the replication stress response. Top panel. In this model, ATR kinase
  is recruited to RPA-coated ssDNA through its binding partner ATRIP. As an independent
  event, the 9-1-1 clamp is loaded at the ssDNA–dsDNA junction. TopBP1 is also recruited
  to RPA–ssDNA at the ssDNA–dsDNA junctions, interacts with the C-terminal tail of
  Rad9, and stabilizes the ATR kinase localization at the site of stress. ATR phosphorylates
  downstream factors, including H2A(X) and Chk1, which mediates cell cycle arrest
  and controls origin firing. Bottom panel. Most of the data for this pathway were
  observed in Leishmania. These parasites express a functional 9-1-1 homolog; the
  Rad9 subunit is found in alternative complexes, and Hus1 also exists as a monomer,
  suggesting a functional flexibility and compartmentalization of the trypanosomatid
  9-1-1 clamp. Homologs of key elements of this pathway have not yet been characterized,
