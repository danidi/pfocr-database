caption: A graphical representation of the canonical pathway of miRNA biogenesis in
  animals. The MIR gene encodes pri-miRNA. Modification of the pri-miRNA hairpin with
  two free ends takes place in the cell nucleus. The DGCR8 (DiGeorge critical region
  8) and Drosha enzymes cut off the free strands from the hairpin giving pre-miRNA.
  Then, pre-miRNA is transported into the cytoplasm by Exportin 5 (Exp5), where the
  Dicer and TRBP (TAR double-stranded RNA binding protein) complex removes the hairpin’s
  loop and cleaves the molecule into the miRNA duplex. One of the duplex strands,
  along with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), is involved in mRNA targeting.
  The second one is degraded.
