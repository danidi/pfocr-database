caption: To promote a myogenic gene program, miR-30 family miRNAs repress the expression
  of SNAI2 and SMARCD2, both negative regulators of myogenesis. Additionally, miR-30
  family miRNAs provide negative feedback on the miRNA pathway by targeting TNRC6A,
  leading to derepressed miRNA targets and increased protein synthesis.
