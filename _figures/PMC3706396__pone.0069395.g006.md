caption: S100A8/A9 expression increases p-Chk1 (Ser345) activating phosphorylation
  and PP2A phosphatase activity, which is hypothesized to target and dephosphorylate
  p-Cdc25C (Thr48), allowing Cdc25C to be phosphorylated by p-Chk1 (Ser345) at inhibitory
  residue Ser216 . Phosphorylated p-Cdc25C (Ser216) is targeted and bound by 14-3-3β,
  leading to inactivation and cytosolic accumulation of Cdc25C. As a result, cyclin
  B1/p-Cdc2 (Thr14/Tyr15) complex is inactivated, arresting cell cycle at the G2/M
  checkpoint. Solid line represents direct regulation; dashed line represents unknown
  mechanism.
