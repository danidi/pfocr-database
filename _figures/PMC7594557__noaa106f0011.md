caption: A simplified overview of signaling from common types of DNA damage to the
  DDR and cell cycle checkpoint pathways. Initial damage is sensed by proteins including
  the histone γ -H2AX, which is rapidly phosphorylated by ATM at a specific serine
  residue in response to chromatin structure alteration at DBS sites, activating recruitment
  of repair proteins including BRCA1 and the MRN complex (MRE11, Rad51, NBS1). DSB
  repair is undertaken by the end-joining pathway involving the kinase DNA-PK and
  Ku protein binding partners and the homologous recombination pathway involving Rad51
  and associated proteins. Single strand breaks (SSB) and replication stress leading
  to stalled replication forks activate PARP which in turn recruits repair factors
  including XRCC1 and promotes chromatin remodeling at the break site and base excision
  repair. ATR and ATM function both in the initial signaling cascade and as transducers
  to downstream activation of the cell cycle checkpoints inhibitors, Chk1 and Chk2
  producing cell cycle delay to facilitate repair. Points in the pathway at which
  specific inhibitors are available are indicated. As predicted from their roles in
  the DDR pathway, ATM and ATR inhibitors sensitize to a broad range of DNA damaging
  agents causing single or double strand breaks. PARPi and cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors
  including Wee1 inhibitors are specifically effective in cells undergoing rapid replication.
  DSB = Double Strand Break; SSB = Single Strand Break.
