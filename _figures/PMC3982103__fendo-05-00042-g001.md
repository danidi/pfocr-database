caption: The astrocytic part of the synapse provides net synthesis of glutamine (GLN),
  via the concerted action of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase
  (PDH), generating oxaloacetate (OAA) and acetyl-CoA, the combination of which leads
  to synthesis of citrate (CIT). This subsequently leads to a net synthesis of α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG) allowing synthesis of glutamate (GLU), catalyzed by either glutamate dehydrogenase
  (GDH) or an amino acid aminotransferase (AA). GLU is used for synthesis of GLN catalyzed
  by glutamine synthetase (GS). GLN is transferred to the glutamatergic neuron to
  be used for synthesis of GLU catalyzed by phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG).
  Released GLU is taken up into the astrocyte and transformed into GLN completing
  the GLU–GLN cycle. Alternatively, the GLU taken up may be oxidatively metabolized,
  which subsequently requires de novo synthesis of GLN via the anaplerotic processes
  indicated in bold arrows. Reproduced from Ref. (), which together with other contributions
  discusses metabolic interactions in detail, even in the brain in vivo. However,
  the Figure also shows that NH4+ is required in astrocytes and released in neurons,
  and mechanisms transferring NH4+/NH3 between the two cell types are discussed in
  other articles. So are the transporters releasing glutamine from astrocytes and
  accumulating it in neurons and the powerful transporters accumulating glutamate
  in astrocytes, as well as associations between glutamate uptake and metabolism.
