caption: Hypothetical proto-anabolic network consisting of the AcCoA pathway (CO2
  to AcCoA) and the rTCA cycle, including the epicycle for oxaloacetate synthesis,
  showing the role of its intermediates as universal biosynthetic precursors (ref.
  , ). Variants with an incomplete rTCA cycle that stops after step F have also been
  proposed (refs. , ).
