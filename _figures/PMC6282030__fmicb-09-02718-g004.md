caption: Nitrogen metabolic pathways identified in the metatranscriptomes based on
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway maps. Enzyme classification (EC)
  numbers for each step are included in boxes. The box color indicates relative abundance
  of reads in total mapped reads for each enzyme. The color scheme is the same as
  in Figure . Gray represents absence.
