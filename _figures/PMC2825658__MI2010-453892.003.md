caption: Role of ROS in the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.
  The JNK pathway is activated by various factors such as ROS, ER stress, free fatty
  acids (FFAs), and inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and is involved in the development
  of insulin resistance found in type 2 diabetes. It has been also shown that the
  IkappaB kinase β (IKK) pathway is also activated by such factors and is involved
  in the development of insulin resistance. Therefore, it is likely that activation
  of stress signaling is involved in the development of insulin resistance.
