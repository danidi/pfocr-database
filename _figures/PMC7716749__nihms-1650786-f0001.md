caption: (A) Schematic diagram showing chondrocyte stages in the growth plate during
  development and selected signals that regulate these processes, including PTHrP,
  IHH, WNTs, FGFs, BMP and TGFβ, IGF1 and IGF2. Wnts have pleiotropic effects on chondrocyte
  development and are not illustrated here. PTHrP, parathyroid hormone-related peptide;
  IHH, Indian hedgehog; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; BMP2, bone morphogenetic
  protein 2; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β. (B) Pathways of glucose metabolism.
  Glucose is transported into the cells by GLUTs and converted to G6P. G6P can be
  utilized by multiple pathways, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation,
  the pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen synthesis, and GAG synthesis. Two shuttles
  are typically used to transfer electrons associated with NADH from the cytosol to
  the mitochondria for the ETC to produce ATP. One is the malate-aspartate shuttle,
  and the other is the glycerol phosphate shuttle, although a key enzyme in the glycerol
  phosphate shuttle, G3PDH, is not present in chondrocytes (indicated by *). G1P,
  glucose 1-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde
