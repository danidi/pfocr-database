caption: Blue lines represent the non-enzymatic reactions proposed to connect Pro
  and Δ1-Pyr by •OH scavenging. In the non-enzymatic reactions two •OH are captured
  and the CO2 released could enter the C3 cycle. Red and green lines represent catabolic
  and anabolic pathways respectively. SSA stands for succinic semialdehyde, and AT
  stands for amino transferases.
