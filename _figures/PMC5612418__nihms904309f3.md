caption: Choline is used as a precursor of phosphatidylcholine, acetylcholine [in
  a reaction catalyzed by choline acetyltransferase (CHAT)], or betaine [in a reaction
  catalyzed by choline dehydrogenase (CHDH)]. The methyl groups of betaine are used
  by betaine:homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT) to regenerate methionine from
  homocysteine. In an alternative pathway, catalyzed by vit. B12-requiring 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
  S-methyltransferase (MTR), methyltetrahydrofolate (5-CH3THF) is used as a methyl
  donor. Methionine is used as a precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) in a reaction
  catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase(s) (MAT1A). SAM is used by multiple
  methylating enzymes including DNA and histone methyltransferases that use SAM as
  a donor of methyl groups to methylate DNA at the 5-position of cytosine residues
  within the CpG sequences and histones at specific lysine and arginine residues.
  The DNA methylation state and pattern exerts a modulatory influence on expression
  of multiple genes (e.g. Igf2). The second product of this, and all other SAM-requiring
  methylation reactions, S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is hydrolyzed to free homocysteine
  by SAH hydrolase (AHCY). The metabolic pathway linking choline to DNA and histone
  methylations is indicated by thick arrows.
