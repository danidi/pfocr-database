caption: A scheme of DNA damage directly and indirectly caused by UV and network of
  mechanisms involved in their repair. UV irradiation causes formation of pyrimidine
  dimers (a) that can be repaired either by photoreactivation under UV-A/blue light
  (b) or NER (nucleotide excision repair) (c). Alternatively, pyrimidine dimers can
  be bypassed during replication by TLS (translesion synthesis) (d), which leads to
  production of mismatched bases (e). Mismatches are repaired by MMR (mismatch repair)
  (f). UV-induced oxidative stress may lead to formation of 8-oxo-dG (g) that are
  repaired via BER (base excision repair) (h). UV may also indirectly cause formation
  of single strand breaks (i) repaired by proteins involved in BER pathway (j) and
  double strand breaks (k), that may be repaired by HR (homologous recombination)
  (l) or NHEJ (non-homologous end joining) (m). Black arrows represent the mechanisms
  of dark repair, while photoreactivation is marked in blue.
