caption: 'Acetyl-CoA oxidization and leucine biosynthesis. The first and second carbons
  of leucine originate from the first and second carbons of acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA
  can be reversibly oxidized via an alternative pathway. C1 is 5,10-Me-THF. Annotated
  enzymes involved in acetyl-CoA oxidization are as follows: for reaction 1, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase and methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase; for reaction 2, formate
  dehydrogenase; for reaction 3, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. *C represents the
  first carbon in lactate and is the labeled 13C in our experiment. #C represents
  the second C of lactate and is the one incorporated into the leucine COOH group
  via acetyl-CoA. [13C]acetyl-CoA is likely present via reversible reactions 3 and
  4 from the 13CO2 and leads to some percentage of the labeled COOH in leucine.'
