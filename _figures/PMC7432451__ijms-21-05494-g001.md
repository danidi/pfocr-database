caption: The ITAM- and ITIM-signaling receptors sense the microenvironment and determine
  the response of microglia. Inhibitory SIGLEC receptors such as SIGLEC-2/-3/-11 (human)
  and SIGLEC-E/-F (mouse) as well as other immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition
  motif (ITIM)-signaling receptors (e.g., SIRPα) recruit and activate SHP1/2, which
  can in turn terminate intracellular signals emanating from immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
  activation motif (ITAM)-signaling receptors via their intrinsic phosphatase activity.
  The ITIM signaling pathway inhibits SYK activation (dotted ‘-‘ arrow) and thus prevents
  several responses of microglia (‘+’ arrows) including phagocytosis, oxidative burst,
  migration, proliferation, and inflammation. The exact signaling cascade of the counterbalanced
  ITAM- and ITIM-mediated response is not fully understood, but several cell membrane
  receptors converge on the ITAM/ITIM-response to elicit diverging signals via several
  intracellular second messenger pathways (‘+’ arrows). Interestingly, ITIM signaling
  via inhibition of SYK also down-regulates inflammasome activation, since both SYK-
  and JNK-dependent pathways are required for inflammasome activation. CR3, complement
  receptor 3 as heterodimer of CD11b/ITGAM and CD18/ITGB2; HSCT/DAP10, hematopoietic
  cell signal transducer; IL, interleukin; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif; JNK, C-Jun NH2-terminal
  protein kinase; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NLRP3, nucleotide-binding
  oligomerization domain-leucine-rich repeats containing pyrin domain 3; P, phosphate;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; SHP1/2, Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1/2,
  also named PTPN6/PTPN11 gene; SIGLEC, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin type lectin;
  SIRP, signal regulatory protein; SYK, spleen tyrosine kinase; TREM2, triggering
  receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; TYROBP/DAP12, TYRO protein tyrosine kinase
  binding protein/DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa.
