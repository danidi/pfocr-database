caption: Mammalian autophagy proceeds through a series of steps, including initiation
  at the PAS (phagophore assembly site), elongation and expansion of the phagophore,
  closure and completion of the autophagosome, autophagosome maturation via docking
  and fusion with an endosome and/or lysosome, breakdown and degradation of the autophagosome
  inner membrane and cargo, and recycling of the resulting macromolecules. Regulatory
  components for autophagy induction include the ULK1 and ULK2 complexes that contain
  various Atg proteins (light blue box at left) that are required for autophagy. The
  association of mTORC1 with this complex and the activity of mTORC1 depend on the
  nutrient status. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 is associated with the ULK1
  and ULK2 complexes, and phosphorylates ULK1, ULK2, and mAtg13; upon inactivation
  of mTORC1 by nutrient starvation, mTORC1 disassociates, mAtg13, ULK1 and ULK2 are
  partially dephosphorylated, and activation of ULK1 and ULK2 promotes phosphosphorylation
  of FIP200. There are at least three class III PtdIns3K complexes (light red box
  at right), that are involved in autophagosome formation or clearance. The Atg14L
  (Atg14L-Beclin 1-hVps34-p150) and UVRAG (UVRAG-Beclin 1-hVps34-p150) complexes are
  required for autophagy, whereas the Rubicon complex (Rubicon-UVRAG-Beclin 1-hVps34-p150)
  negatively regulates autophagy. Ambra1 and Bif-1 are essential for induction of
  autophagy, through direct interaction with Beclin 1 and UVRAG, respectively, whereas
  Bcl-2 binds to Beclin 1 and disrupts the Beclin 1-associated hVps34 complex, thereby
  inhibiting autophagy.
