caption: Changes in protein levels are illustrated with green (decreased level) and
  red (increased level) colors. Induction of DIO1 expression in renal cancer cells
  results in robust downregulation of oncoproteins that are well known inhibitors
  of apoptosis and promoters of ccRCC proliferation, migration and invasion (left
  side of the drawing). Simultaneously, restoration of DIO1 in ccRCC cells leads to
  enhanced expression of proteins that contribute to metabolic reprogramming of renal
  tumors and affect PPP, TCA cycle, metabolism of amino acids and lipids. This may
  be associated with prominent induction of ROS that in turn trigger antioxidative
  response and results in enhanced levels of proteins of Nrf2 pathway (right side
  of the drawing). On the other hand, induced DIO1 expression can also possibly result
  in attenuation of ROS-scavenging system by decreasing GLUD1 and inducing FAH (middle
  part of the drawing). Altogether, this may possibly result in ROS levels that exceed
  the compensatory buffering systems of ccRCC cells and trigger mechanisms leading
  to apoptosis or autophagy.
