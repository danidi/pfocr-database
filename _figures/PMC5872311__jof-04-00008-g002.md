caption: Epithelial responses to A. fumigatus. Epithelial responses to A. fumigatus
  vary dramatically according to fungal morphotype and host cell origin, the latter
  denoted in red for alveolar epithelial cells and blue for bronchial epithelial cells.
  Contact with A. fumigatus spores prompts rapid cytoskeletal reorganisation and loss
  of focal adherence, possibly via spore-associated toxins []. In bronchial epithelial
  cells recognition of germinating conidia and hyphae leads to upregulation of Dectin-1
  expression at the host cell membrane and phosphorylation-mediated activation of
  phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38
  and ERK1/2 signalling, leading to TNFα, IL-8, and β-defensin expression (HBD-2 and
  -9) [,,]. In AECs, challenge with A. fumigatus culture filtrate prompts MAPK ERK1/2,
  p38, and c-Jun N-terminal protein kinases (JNK) phosphorylation, in a partially
  fungal protease-dependent manner, leading to lytic death of the host cell [,]. JNK
  or p38 inhibitors protect against host damage []. The secreted products of cultured
  A. fumigatus also elicit remodelling of the respiratory epithelium involving heightened
  expression of classical Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), serum IgE, collagen deposition,
  and neutrophil (N) and eosinophil (E) recruitment []. Gliotoxin exposure induces
  cytoskeletal collapse, cell peeling, and apoptosis. Gt activates the JNK pathway
  leading to apoptosis. JNK triple-phosphorylates the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, leading
  to pro-apoptotic Bak and Bax activation, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization,
  and apoptosis [,,,]. Italicised text indicates responses observed in whole animals
  or humans.
