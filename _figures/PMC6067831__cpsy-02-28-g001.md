caption: Schematic of the HPA axis. A) Stress is processed in the central nervous
  system and a signal is relayed to the PVN in the hypothalamus to activate CRH secretion
  into the hypophyseal portal system. B) CRH diffuses to the pituitary gland and activates
  ACTH secretion. ACTH travels down to the adrenal cortex to activate cortisol (CORT)
  release. Cortisol inhibits both CRH and ACTH secretion to downregulate its own production,
  forming a closed loop. C) Negative feedback of cortisol suppresses CRH synthesis
  in the PVN, ultimately reducing the amount of stored CRH and its subsequent release.
  External inputs, such as stressors and circadian inputs, directly affect the release
  rate of CRH at the axonal terminal. D) CRH released by the PVN stimulates the protein
  kinase A (PKA) pathway to activate release of CRH by the anterior pituitary, contributing
  to ACTH secretion in an auto/paracrine fashion.
