caption: Schematic of IL-4 and IL-13 mediated signal transduction. (a) Illustration
  of overlapping as well as non-redundant signaling mechanisms employed by IL-4 and
  IL-13, respectively. For details, see text. (b–d) Same as in (a) with highlighted
  drugs targeting specific molecules, respectively. Drug-mediated inactivation of
  pathway components is illustrated by grey-shading of respective boxes. STAT = signal
  transducer and activator of transcription. JAK = Janus kinase. TYK = tyrosine kinase.
