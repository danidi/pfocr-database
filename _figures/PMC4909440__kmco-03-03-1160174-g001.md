caption: Mechanistic consequences of PREX2 truncating mutations. In wild-type cells
  PREX2 is bound to PTEN and its GEF domain is kept in an inactive state through association
  with its C-terminus (C-term), with resultant basal levels of downstream signaling
  events such as GDP-loaded RAC1. In cells and tumors with truncating PREX2 mutations,
  PREX2 is unable to bind to PTEN and its intramolecular inhibitory conformation is
  lost, resulting in activation of its GEF activity. This results in GTP loading of
  RAC1, which in turn leads to direct activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. These alterations
  (through a still unknown link) perturb DNA methylation at a critical genomic imprint
  control region leading to downregulation of a key cell cycle regulator CDKN1C (also
  known as p57) and upregulation of IGF2, which favors accelerated cell growth and
  proliferation. GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor;
  GTP, guanosine triphosphate; IGF2, insulin like growth factor 2; PREX2, phosphatidylinositol-3,
  4, 5-triphosphate-dependent Rac exchange factor 2; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin
  homolog; RAC1, ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1.
