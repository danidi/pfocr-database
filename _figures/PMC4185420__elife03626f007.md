caption: 'Bip1, RpS8, and Nup98 are independently required for the expression of Pvr
  (direct arrows). Rescue of endogenous Pvr expression by misexpression of bip1 in
  the Nup98 RNAi background indicates that bip1 functions genetically downstream of
  Nup98 (dashed arrow) in the control of Pvr expression. Bip1 and RpS8 may work together
  in a complex (dashed line) to control Pvr expression in vivo. These components collectively
  comprise the known equilibrium signaling pathway working within the lymph gland
  to promote progenitor cell maintenance, along with the previously known Hh niche
  signaling mechanism.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03626.017'
