caption: There are two main phases in type I IFN (IFNα/β) gene expression and regulation
  by viral infection. In phase I of an infection with viruses, a small amount of IFNβ
  is induced by the virus. Then, the expressed IFNβ activates the JAK-STAT pathway
  in phase II, inducing the generation of a large number of IFNα/β and AVPs which
  inhibits viral replication.
