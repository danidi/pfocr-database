caption: (A) Ribbon diagram of an IL-7Rα homodimer structure viewed as looking down
  onto the cell membrane (3up1.pdb) (). (B) Side view of the IL-7Rα homodimer structure
  modeled on a lipid bilayer showing that there is plenty of room for the C-termini
  of both chains to reach the top of the cell membrane. (C) Proposed signaling mechanism(s)
  of the IL-7 and γc pathways of preassembly of the receptors before interleukin binding.
  The IL-7Rα/γc is a model generated by superimposing the γc structure onto chain
  B of the IL-7Rα homodimer structure. Mutagenesis data indicate that the elbow loop
  residues of IL-7Rα are important to its interaction with γc independent of IL-7
  (unpublished results from my laboratory). The IL-7 ternary complex is also a structural
  model made by docking the γc structure close to the IL-7/IL-7Rα binary complex ().
