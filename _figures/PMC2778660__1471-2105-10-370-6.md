caption: Network representation of p53, NF-κB and cell cycle interactions. (A) Network
  topology of the combined networks of the p53 (red), NF-κB (yellow) and the cell
  cycle {CDN1B_HUMAN (orange), CCND1_HUMAN (magenta), RB_HUMAN (green), E2F1_HUMAN
  (blue)}. Connector nodes linking cell cycle proteins to either NF-κB or p53; or
  to both have been denoted according to the colour of the cell cycle protein counterpart.
  For example, since E2F1_HUMAN is denoted in blue, connector proteins linking it
  to the p53 or NF-κB, or to both will be highlighted in blue (B) Condensed view of
  the p53 and NF-κB networks, and their connections with cell cycle proteins. The
  connectors have been labelled according to (A).
