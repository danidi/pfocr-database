caption: Role of TNAP in the extracellular pyrophosphate metabolism. ATP is released
  by cells via exocytotic mechanisms and through multiple types of membrane channels.
  Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase (eNPP) hydrolyzes ATP, releasing
  pyrophosphate (PPi) and adenosine-5’-monophosphate (AMP). PPi is degraded to phosphate
  (Pi) by tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). AMP is degraded to adenosine
  (Ado) and Pi via ecto-5´nucleotidase (5NT). Ado and Pi are recovered from the extracellular
  space by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and sodium phosphate transporter
  (NaPi), respectively. ATP is generated in the mitochondria or through another metabolic
  pathway.
