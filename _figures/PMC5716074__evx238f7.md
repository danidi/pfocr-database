caption: '—Comparison of lipid biosynthetic pathways in plastids (top) and cyanobacteria
  (bottom). All enzymes are color-coded: blue, cyanobacterial or prokaryotic enzymes;
  green, plastid-localized enzymes; red, ER-localized enzymes. The latter two categories
  of enzymes are eukaryotic enzymes (of eukaryotic origin), except the TGD complex
  components that are of cyanobacterial origin (see, e.g., ). In plants and green
  algae, stearoyl-ACP desaturase (FAB2) catalyzes the conversion of 18:0 to 18:1 within
  the plastid, whereas in red algae, this enzyme is not present, and the final product
  of fatty acid synthesis within the plastid is 18:0. The C18 acids are transported
  out of the plastids and used to synthesize the 1-C18-2-C18 lipids in the ER. Desaturation
  occurs on these lipids, but this is not shown explicitly. The PA or DAG portion
  of phosphatidylcholine comes back to the plastids and used for the synthesis of
  the galactolipids. The pathway via ER is a very simplified sketch, because it is
  not the main topic of this study. Within the plastids (plastid pathway), the 1-C18-2-C16
  lipids (sometimes called “prokaryotic lipids”) are synthesized by ATS1 and ATS2,
  which are not of cyanobacterial origin. MGDG is synthesized by galactosylation of
  DAG catalyzed by MGD1, and DGDG by galactosylation of MGDG catalyzed by DGD1. In
  the red algae, C. merolae and Galdieria sulphuraria, the last step is catalyzed
  by DgdA (or Ycf82), a cyanobacterial enzyme encoded by the plastid genome. Other
  red algae possess DGD1 but not DgdA. In cyanobacteria, MGDG is synthesized by the
  epimerization (catalyzed by MgdE) of GlcDG, which is synthesized by the glucosylation
  of DAG catalyzed by MgdA. DgdA is the sole enzyme catalyzing the production of DGDG
  in cyanobacteria. ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme A; FAS, fatty acid synthase;
  GlcDG, monoglucosyl diacylglycerol; UDP-glc, uridine diphosphate glucose; UDP-gal,
  uridine diphosphate galactose.'
