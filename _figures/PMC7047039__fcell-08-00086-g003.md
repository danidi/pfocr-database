caption: Proposed pathway for sorting α-syn into exosomes. Exosomes participate in
  the secretion of α-syn in an endosome-dependent mechanism. First, α-syn is packaged
  into early endosomes. Next, α-syn containing exosomes can be secreted by two pathways.
  With the assistance of VPS4 and SUMO, it can be secreted as exosomal cargoes upon
  fusion of MVBs with the cytoplasmic membrane. Alternatively, α-syn containing exosomes
  can be sorted into recycling endosomes and be exocytosed as secretory granules in
  a Rab11a-dependent way.
