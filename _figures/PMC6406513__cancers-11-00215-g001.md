caption: 'A schematic, non-mechanistic, diagram of the role of bortezomib (BTZ) and
  onocolytic viruses (OVs) in the regulation of cell death pathways and the effects
  of fluctuating BTZ and OVs [,]. OV activities determine cell apoptosis or necroptosis
  in response to BTZ (yellow triangle-bar on the left). (A) A low BTZ level promotes
  proteasome activities and leads to upregulation of NFB/Bcl-2 and downregulation
  of Bax, thereby suppressing apoptosis. (B) A high BTZ level in the absence of OVs
  suppresses proteasome activities by activating IB, which in turn inhibits the NFB/Bcl-2
  complex and up-regulates Bax, leading to apoptosis. (C) In the presence of OVs,
  the BTZ-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway is modified: the NFB/Bcl-2
  complex is upregulated and the Bax level is downregulated. This also results in
  upregulation of RIP1, leading to necroptosis. Red arrows on the right indicate the
  switching behavior between an anti-apoptosis mode in (A) and the apoptosis state
  in (B) in response to fluctuating BTZ. Blue arrows on the right indicate the switching
  behavior between a apoptosis mode in (B) and the necroptosis state in (C) in response
  to fluctuating OVs.'
