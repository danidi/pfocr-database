caption: 13C isotopomer profiles of amino acids in intracellular M. leprae versus
  M. tuberculosis (Mtb). (A) Amino acid profiles are plotted on a metabolic map showing
  the reactions for the TCA cycle, glycolysis, PPP, and anaplerotic pathway (ANA).
  M+1, M+2, M+3, M+4, M+5, M+6, M+7, M+8, and M+9 are the mass isotopomer families.
  Proportional increases or decreases in the 13C abundance of mass isotopomers of
  a metabolite are indicated by a single gradient. The isotopomer family occupying
  the highest proportion of 13C is shown with the highest color intensity. The metabolites
  are malate oxaloacetate (MALOAA), fumarate (FUM), succinate (SUC), succinyl coenzyme
  A (SUCCOA), 2-oxoglutarate (OXG), isocitrate (ICIT), citrate (CIT), acetyl coenzyme
  A (ACCOA), pyruvate (PYR), phosphoglyceric acid (PGA), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  (GAP), fructose-6-bisphosphate (FBP), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P), pentose-5-phosphate (P5P), erythrose-4-phsophate (E4P), sedoheptulose-7-phosphate
  (S7P), ketoisovalerate (KIV), chorismate (CHOR), histidine (HIS), glutamine (GLN),
  glutamic acid (GLU), lysine (LYS), methionine (MET), and arginine (ARG). Measurements
  for M. leprae and M. tuberculosis are averages ± SD from three independent infection
  experiments ( and ). Statistically significant changes (P < 0.05) between the quantitative
  proportions of M. leprae and M. tuberculosis obtained by Student’s t test are indicated
  by an asterisk.
