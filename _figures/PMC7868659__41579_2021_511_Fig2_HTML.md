caption: 'The monoclonal antibody 18B7 binds to glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), a key capsular
  polysaccharide that modulates anti-cryptococcal immune responses. Glucuronoxylomannogalactan
  (GXMGal) is another major capsular polysaccharide in Cryptococcus spp. Benzothioureas
  (BTUs) affect the integrity of the cell wall by inhibiting the late post-Golgi secretory
  pathway. APX001 (also known as fosmanogepix) targets Gwt1, an inositol acyltransferase
  required for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor biosynthesis, and thereby
  blocks the cell wall localization of GPI-anchored mannoproteins. Clofazimine is
  a broad-spectrum antifungal compound that induces cell membrane stress, potentiating
  the activity with clinically used antifungals. The hydrazycin N′-(3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-methylbenzohydrazide
  (BHBM) and its derivative 3-bromo-N′-(3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzylidene)benzohydrazide
  (B0) target the synthesis of the sphingolipid glucosylceramide (GlcCer). APX879
  and Compound 112 (CMPD#112) are stress response inhibitors that target the phosphatase
  calcineurin and the chaperone protein Hsp90, respectively,. The natural product
  ibomycin perturbs the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway, and thereby disrupts membrane
  function. The extent to which these compounds have been investigated varies: the
  mechanism of action has been predicted using an indirect assay (red), the proximal
  target has been verified using a direct assay (orange) or the molecule has been
  tested for safety and/or efficacy in clinical trials (green). The chemical structure
  of the highlighted molecules is depicted. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.'
