caption: 'An integrated view of the metabolic pathway comparison between L. monocytogenes
  EGD-e, L. innocua, and L. welshimeri. The map illustrates biochemical pathways for
  main energy productions, such as glycolysis, starch metabolism, pentose phosphate
  pathway, and tricarboxylic acid cycle, which are necessary to maintain the survival
  of the strains. Several amino acid pathways and nucleic acid metabolism are involved
  as well (pathway names are colored blue). The lipid and fatty acid pathways are
  omitted since they are incompletely present. Closed red arrowheads describe the
  corresponding enzymes/reactions absent in L. welshimeri; however, they exist in
  both L. monocytogenes and L. innocua, whereas open red arrowheads show the enzymes/functions
  specifically present in L. monocytogenes. Closed blue arrowheads indicate the reactions
  present in only L. welshimeri, not L. monocytogenes or L. innocua. The gray line
  means the reaction is believed to occur spontaneously. Each gene product with a
  predicted function in ion or solute transport is illustrated in the figure. Proteins
  are grouped by substrate specificity, with transporters for cations (green), anions
  (pink), carbohydrates and organic acids (orange), and amino acids and peptides (blue).
  Ion-coupled permeases are represented by ovals, while ABC transport systems are
  shown as ovals. This construction is concluded from the latest annotation data (NCBI)
  (C. Liang, unpublished data). The functional orthologs in silico are defined using
  a threshold of 50% identity and 75 to 125% alignment coverage rate. The resulting
  strain-specific genes were inspected using InterPro and ExPASy protein domain analysis
  platforms. AICAR, 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-d-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate;
  DHF, dihydrofolate; G-1-P, glucose-1-phosphate; Dahp, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate;
  F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate; G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; 6PGluco, 6-phosphogluconate; PRPP, 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate;
  R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; S7P, sedaheptulose-7-phosphate;
  TCA, tricarboxylic acid; TCOylcine, 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oylglycine;
  X5P, xylulose-5-phosphate; The enzymes encoded by the indicated genes are as follows:
