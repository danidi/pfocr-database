caption: 'Activation of the MAPK pathway through a BRAFV600E mutation.Notes: (A) Normal
  signaling of the BRAF pathway. The BRAF pathway initiates signaling through extracellular
  growth factor domains. RAS family members are subsequently activated through receptor
  tyrosine kinases domains, and activation of RAS proteins bind RAF isoforms leading
  to activation of RAF, followed by MEK, and the final step of phosphorylation of
  ERK. The net effect leads toward increased cell survival and decreased apoptosis.
  (B) BRAF mutant pathway. In the presence of an activating BRAFV600E mutation, BRAF
  no longer requires dimerization with RAS, and therefore remains constitutively active.
  (C) Inhibition of BRAF mutant pathway. The addition of vemurafenib inhibits mutant
  BRAF, thereby stopping downstream activation of the MAPK pathway, and thereby decreasing
  cellular proliferation and inducing apoptosis.Abbreviations: ERK, extracellular
  signal regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RAF, rapidly accelerated
  fibrosarcoma; RAS, rat sarcoma virus monologue; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinases.'
