caption: Models for EGFR- and HPPY-regulation of ethanol sensitivity. The EGFR pathway
  promotes resistance to ethanol-induced sedation and HPPY functions to counteract
  this effect by inhibiting the EGFR pathway. Ethanol may act on the EGFR directlyorondownstream
  signaling molecules, including ERK. (A) Amodelinwhich HPPY is directly inhibitedby
  EGFR activation, (B) amodelinwhich HPPY function as a constitutive inhibitor of
  the pathway. Red intersecting lines represent inhibitory interactions, green arrows
  represent activating interactions. EGFR = Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, ERK
  = Extracellular signal-Regulated Protein Kinase, HPPY = Happyhour protein (For interpretation
  of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
  web version of the article.).
