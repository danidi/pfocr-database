caption: The proposed regulatory pathway for FGF2 mediated mesenchymal transition
  in human corneal endothelial cells. Stimulation by FGF2 leads to increased expression
  of SP1 and SP3. SP1 expression is regulated through ZEB1 whereas SP3 expression
  is not. SP1 plays a greater role in expression of COL1, FN1 and VIM than SP3.
