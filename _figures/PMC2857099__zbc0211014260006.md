caption: Proposed model for NFκB repression by TRAF3 in LTBR activation. TRAF3 inhibits
  activation of the classical NFκB pathway by interfering with the formation of productive
  signaling complexes at LTBR. A high level of TRAF3 interferes with the recruitment
  of TRAF2 to the receptor. In parallel, TRAF3 induces NIK degradation and consequently
  inhibits the activation of the alternative arm of NFκB. During LTBR signaling, the
  alternative arm is activated as a result of TRAF3 degradation and NIK derepression.
  The sustained activation of the alternative arm in the absence of TRAF3 is maintained
  by an autoactivation loop. Alternative arm activation up-regulates NIK, NFκB2/p100,
  and RelB transcription by p52 and RelB, and the continued processing of NFκB2/p100
  into p52 is induced by derepressed NIK. Additionally, persistent alternative arm
  activation up-regulates NFκB1 inhibitors such as IκBα and A20, keeping the classical
  NFκB pathway inactive in the absence of activation signals.
