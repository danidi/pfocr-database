caption: The master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls the timing
  of the sleep–wake cycle as well as promotes arousal, REM sleep, and sleep consolidation.
  Light resets the oscillations in the SCN through a mechanism involving melanopsin-containing
  retinal ganglion cells that project directly to the SCN via the retino-hypothalamic
  tract. Through an indirect pathway, circadian information reaches the pineal gland
  where the hormone melatonin is produced, which also can shift the phase of oscillations
  in the SCN. Both melatonin and neural information from retinal ganglion cells can
  also directly act on the sleep–wake system itself. Thus, light input and the circadian
  system work together to modulate properties of the sleep–wake cycle. The thin, dotted
  arrows represent the input pathways directly connected to the oscillatory central
  pacemaker in the SCN (denoted by rotating arrows). Bold-dashed arrows represent
  the different output pathways affecting the sleep–wake cycle. Both light and melatonin
  comprise aspects of the central circadian input pathway as well as the output signal
  controlling sleep–wake behavior.
