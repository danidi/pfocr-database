caption: Stimulation of both, microvascular and macrovascular EC, with LTA/PepG triggers
  Rho, p38 MAPK and NFκB signaling leading to cytoskeletal remodeling, stress fiber
  formation and endothelial barrier dysfunction. In HPAEC, LTA/PepG-induced p38 MAPK
  activation is attenuated by inhibition of Rho kinase, while activation of Rho kinase
  is not affected by inhibition of p38 MAPK. In contrast, the Rho - p38 MAPK crosstalk
  in microvascular EC is bi-directional, as inhibition of either pathway affected
  its counterpart. Finally, both Rho and p38 MAPK pathways modulate LTA/PepG-induced
  activation of NFκB pathway.
