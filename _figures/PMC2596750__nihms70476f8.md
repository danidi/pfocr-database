caption: Model of TNFR1 and LTβR ligation-induced signaling in vascular EC. This model
  depicts the relative strengths of activation of classical and noncanonical NF-κB
  signaling and the JNK pathway following TNF and LTβR ligation in vascular EC. Strong
  activation is indicated by the thick arrow, weaker induction by the thin arrow,
  and minor activation by the dotted arrow, respectively.
