caption: CSCs can be separated from differentiated cancer cells and typically express
  CD47 at a 2–4-fold higher level. CSC are typically less adherent. Studies in breast,
  liver, and pancreatic cancers have shown that decreasing CD47 expression in CSC
  or exposure to CD47 ligands including TSP1 and the antibody B6H12 convert CSC to
  differentiated cancer cells with a resulting decrease in expression of stem cell
  markers (e.g. cKit, Klf4, CD133, SSEA1), loss of asymmetric division, increased
  NFκB activation, and in some cases increased cell death. The Hif pathway has been
  implicated in the elevated expression of CD47 in CSC.
