caption: 'Main signaling pathways involved for 12 miRNAs differentially expressed
  after exercise from EVs purified from rat’s serum. Prediction for regulatory pathways.
  (A) 12 differentially expressed miRNAs after acute aerobic exercise regulate 8 signaling
  pathways. (B) MAPK signaling pathway was the pathway with more miRNAs regulating
  their genes. Genes regulated by one miRNA are highlighted in yellow, and genes regulated
  by two miRNAs are highlighted in brown. The most regulated genes from MAPK pathway
  were: platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRA), a target for miR-93-5p,
  410-3p and 128-3p; MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (MKNK2), a target
  for miR-93-5p and 128-3p; Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 3 (NFATE3), a target
  for miR-128-3p and 103-3p; transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1),
  a target for miR-128-3p and 142-3p; and nemo like kinase (NLK), a target for miR-3068-3p
  and 410-3p.'
