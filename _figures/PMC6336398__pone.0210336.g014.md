caption: A graphical representation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in APCs by phagocytosis
  [] of metal implant debris, which promotes IL-1β signaling and the induction of
  a Th17-cell phenotype. And the possible biological targets that indirectly (via
  the inflammasome pathway) and directly (anti-IL-17A) target the IL-17 signaling
  pathway to decrease the severity of metal-DTH immune reactivity given our findings.
  IFN-γ is a signature cytokine of Th1 cells and is an important Th1 inducer, that
  can suppress Th17, Th2 and Treg cell differentiation []. While IL-1 and IL-17 are
  important for Th17 cell differentiation and can repress Th1 cell differentiation.
  Under metal-DTH responses, IL-1 and IL-17 are highly secreted, indicating more of
  a Th17 cells phenotype for metal-DTH immune reactivity.
