caption: USE1 is a critical ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in lung cancer cells. Nascent
  proteins synthesized at ribosomes undergo folding and maturation with the assistance
  of chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp90. Correctly folded proteins are translocated
  to other parts of the cell and perform their physiological functions, eg, activated
  transmembrane GPCRs stimulate signaling by promoting the exchange of GDP with GTP
  on Gα, while regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins inhibit Gα signaling
  by promoting hydrolysis of the bound GTP. These proteins are subsequently marked,
  such as by phosphorylation, for degradation. Incorrectly folded, or correctly folded
  but damaged (such as by oxidation), proteins are also degraded to maintain proteostasis.
  The major protein degradation pathway, ubiquitination, starts with charging the
  ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 (eg, Uba6) with a ubiquitin moiety. The ubiquitin
  is in turn transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (eg, USE1) and subsequently
  to proteins targeted for degradation via association of the E2 with a ubiquitin-ligase
  E3. Ubiquitinated proteins are eventually degraded by the proteasome, and the free
  ubiquitin molecules are recycled. Perturbation of the ubiquitination pathway (eg,
  knockdown of USE1) disrupts proteostasis and results in accumulation of misfolded
  and/or damaged proteins, ultimately leading to cell death via apoptosis. In addition
  to these general effects, functional disruption of a specific component of the pathway,
  such as USE1, would also cause accumulation of its substrates (eg, RGS4), thus enhancing
  or prolonging their physiological function (eg, RGS4 as a tumor suppressor).
