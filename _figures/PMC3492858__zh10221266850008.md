caption: 'A schematic presentation of the role of Wnt signaling and TCF7L2 in hepatic
  gluconeogenesis. Feeding upregulates plasma insulin levels, which leads to β-cat
  Ser675 phosphorylation and TCF7L2 expression. A: increased levels of TCF7L2 may
  repress gluconeogenesis via competing with forkhead box O (FoxO) for β-cat. B: in
  addition, cat/TCF7L2, as the effector of the Wnt signaling pathway, may possess
  an intrinsic repressive effect on gluconeogenesis. P, Ser675 phosphorylation.'
