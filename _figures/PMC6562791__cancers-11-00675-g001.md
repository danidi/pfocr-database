caption: 'The interconnected pathways of non-essential amino acids (NEAA) metabolism.
  Glutamine and glutamate have a central role in non-essential amino acid metabolism,
  and can each be used for the synthesis of other NEAAs. Glutamate can be utilized
  to generate alanine, aspartate, serine and proline. Aspartate is further utilized
  to generate asparagine (with nitrogen from glutamine) and can be used in the urea
  cycle to make arginine. Serine donates methyl groups for one-carbon metabolism and
  makes glycine in the process. Serine can also be used in the transsulfuration pathway
  to generate cysteine. Tyrosine is the only NEAA not directly connected to the others,
  as it is separately synthesized from phenylalanine. Green circles indicate non-essential
  amino acids. Abbreviations: Gln = glutamine; Glu = glutamate; Phe = phenylalanine;
