caption: Agonistic ligand binding to the GPCR leads to the activation of heterotrimeric
  G-proteins, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and a cyclin-dependent
  kinase inhibitor Far1p. Phosphorylated Far1p induces G1 cell-cycle arrest. The STE20
  or STE11 gene located upstream of the MAPK cascade was disrupted in the NMY51 strain.
  In the split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid system, NubG will only efficiently interact
  with Cub when the proteins to which the two split tags are attached interact with
  each other, resulting in the formation of a NubG/Cub complex. This complex is recognized
  by ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBPs), which release the artificial transcription
  factor (LexA-VP16) from the Cub-containing construct. LexA-VP16 then enters the
  nucleus via diffusion and binds to the LexA-binding sites upstream of the reporter
  genes. In this study, the GPCRs are fused to the split-ubiquitin and are expressed
  in MAPK-defective mutant yeast strain of NMY51 to allow the monitoring of GPCR dimerizations
  and conformational changes responding to binding of ligand.
