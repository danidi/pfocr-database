caption: Under non-stressed conditions, apoptotic PACS-2 is phosphorylated on Ser437
  and held inactive in the cytosol through binding to 14-3-3 isoforms. Loss of Akt
  signalling or apoptotic activation of PP2A leads to dephosphorylation of PACS-2
  and release from 14-3-3. ‘Activated’ PACS-2 binds and facilitates translocation
  of full-length Bid to mitochondria, inducing cytochrome c release. This pathway
  parallels the previously described 14-3-3-regulated translocation of the pro-apoptotic
  protein Bad [,].
