caption: Diagram of KATPHI β-cell glucose and amino acid metabolism. In KATPHI, inactivating
  mutations of the β-cell KATP channels result in chronic β-cell depolarization and
  elevation of [Ca2+]i, which leads to alterations in fuel sensing and dramatic changes
  in fuel metabolism. Glycolysis is markedly increased, and the serine/glycine biosynthesis
  pathway is activated. The activation of a serine/glycine biosynthesis pathway may
  lead to increased nucleotide biosynthesis, β-cell nucleomegaly, and increased β-cell
  proliferation. KATPHI islets also have impaired GABA shunt and increased glutamine
  biosynthesis. Increased mitochondrial mass, oxygen consumption, and ATP synthase
  expression lead to high production of ATP. High rate of insulin release and increased
  expression of ATPases result in high ATP consumption. 3-PG, 3-phospoglycerate; α-KG,
  α-ketoglutarate; ALT, alanine transaminase; GDH, glutamate dehydrogenase; Glu, glutamate;
  GS, glutamine synthetase; OAA, oxaloacetate; PAST1, phosphoserine aminotransferase
  1; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; TAs, transaminases; TCA
  cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
