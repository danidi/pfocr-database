caption: Complement pathways. Three pathways are known to activate the complement
  cascade. The classical pathway is initiated through binding of C1q protein to Fc
  receptor on the antibody–antigen complex. Activation of the lectin pathway is mediated
  through mannose-binding lectin that binds mannose (carbohydrates) on pathogens’
  surface. Alternative pathway act as an amplification loop by spontaneously hydrolyzing
  C3 to initiate complement activation. All three pathways converge to form C3 convertase,
  which downstream leads to assembly of C5 converatase, thus forming membrane attack
  complex (MAC), which results in cell death. The complement pathways can be regulated
  at the level of C3 and C5 convertases or at MAC.
