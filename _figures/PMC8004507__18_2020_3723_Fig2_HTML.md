caption: SUMO can modulate Transcription Factor functions by directly influencing
  the DNA binding properties of the transcription factor. a SUMO conjugation can either
  (i) inhibit or (ii) facilitate the binding of the transcription factor to its target
  DNA. b SUMO conjugation can promote the clearance of some TFs from DNA if these
  TFs are SUMOylated when bound to their target DNA c SUMO conjugation can alter the
  degree of association of a TF to its target site on chromatin and either alter a
  strong association to a weaker one (upper panel) or vice versa (lower panel) potentially
  by modulating the interaction of the TF with other chromatin associated co-interacting
  proteins. Through these mechanisms, depending on the role played by the transcription
  factor as an activator or repressor in the context of the cellular signalling pathway
  in which it is implicated, modulation of the functions of the TF by SUMO impacts
  the outcome of cellular signalling pathway at the level of gene expression of the
  downstream targets of the TF
