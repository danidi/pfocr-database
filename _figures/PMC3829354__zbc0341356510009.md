caption: Schematic diagram of proposed EGCG-stimulated signaling pathway to activate
  lipophagy. EGCG-induced oscillation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels by stimulating Ca2+
  store in ER that activates CaMKKβ/AMPK pathways and facilitation of autophagic flux.
  Saturated fatty acid (palmitate) causes impairment of autophagic flux, which leads
  to accumulation of ectopic lipid accumulation. The facilitated autophagic flux by
  EGCG affects degradation of accumulated lipid droplets in vascular endothelial cells,
  which may contribute to improvement of cardiovascular function and prevention of
  cardiovascular disease. This EGCG-stimulated lipophagy may explain the beneficial
  health effect of green tea consumption.
