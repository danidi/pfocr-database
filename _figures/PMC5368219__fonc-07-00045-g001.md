caption: Alterations in histone methylation in pediatric and adult high-grade glioma.
  In children, two single-point mutations in the regulatory histone, H3F3A, occur
  in the histone tail at H3.3 K27M and G34R/V, affecting key regulatory posttranscriptional
  modifications. H3.3 K27M mutated glioblastoma displays reprogramming of H3K27 methylation.
  K27M alters the enzymatic activity of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2, which
  establishes H3K27 methylation. This leads to a global reduction in H3K27 methylation
  and the CHOP, priming for increased gene expression, cell differentiation, and alternative
  lengthening of telomeres. Within a globally hypomethylated phenotype, K27M mutated
  glioma may allow increased H3K27 methylation at specific gene loci. An increased
  H3K27 methylation silences tumor suppressor gene expression, such as p16INKA. In
  H3.3 G34R/V mutated glioma, mutations in SETD2 lead to decreased H3K36 methylation,
  which results in increased gene expression and alternative lengthening of telomeres.
  MYCN is upregulated through differential genomic binding of methylated H3K36 in
  G34R/V mutated glioblastoma. In adults, mutated IDH1 and induction of the G-CIMP
  phenotype lead to the overproduction of 2-HG. 2-HG inhibits histone demethylases
  leading to increased H3K27 methylation, which leads to a block in cell differentiation,
  and aberrant DNA and histone methylation. Over production of 2-HG also inhibits
  ten-eleven translocation (TET) activation, leading to a decrease in the 5hmC/CHTOP/methylosome
  complex, which is normally present in wild-type IDH1 glioma. This results in decreased
  transactivation of cancer-related genes such as EGFR, AKT, CDK, and BRAF and may
  provide an explanation for increased survival in patients with IDH1 mutated glioblastoma.
