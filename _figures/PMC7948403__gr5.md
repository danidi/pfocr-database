caption: Ferroptosis in Alzheimer's disease. In health, selenium (Se) in the brain
  can inhibit Aβ generation and tau hyperphosphorylation by modulating PP2A activity.
  Selenocysteine promotes the synthesis of GPx4, where it forms the active site. Accumulation
  of iron (e.g., from aging or from BACE1 processing of APP) increases the reaction
  of cytoplasmic Fe2+ with H2O2 to generate the hydroxyl radical (HO, Fenton chemistry),
  which then reacts with PUFA-containing membrane phospholipids, generating lipid
  peroxides and initiating lipid radical propagation, which then disrupts the plasma
  membrane and causes ferroptosis. This mechanism is initiated by autoxidation, but
  arachidonate lipoxygenase 15-mediated peroxidation of phospholipids can also initiate
  ferroptosis in an iron-dependent manner (). Se, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), α-tocopherol
  (Vit E), and deferiprone act on different components of the pathway to prevent ferroptosis,
  potentially accounting for their putative clinical benefits for AD. AD, Alzheimer's
  disease; Aβ, amyloid β; APP, amyloid precursor protein; BACE1, β-site amyloid precursor
  protein cleaving enzyme 1; GPx4, glutathione peroxidase 4; PP2A, protein phosphatase
  2A; PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids.
