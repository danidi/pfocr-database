caption: 'Direct and indirect effects of FGF21 on skeletal muscle and bone. By regulating
  fiber type distribution and fiber size, skeletal muscle mass might be impacted by
  FGF21. Under certain pathological conditions, FGF21 is a causative factor of muscle
  atrophy. The direct effects of FGF21 on skeletal muscle are enhancing glucose uptake
  and insulin sensitization. FGF21’s action on muscle glucose metabolism might also
  be indirectly mediated by adiponectin secreted from adipose tissue. By stimulation
  of adipogenesis in BMSCs by FGF21, bone formation is decreased. FGF21 may stimulate
  bone absorption directly by increasing osteoclastogenesis and indirectly via induction
  of IGFBP-1. In addition, by blunting the GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway in liver, bone
  growth is indirectly inhibited by FGF21. BMSCs: bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
  stem cells; GH/IGF-1: growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1; IGFBP-1: IGF-1
  binding protein 1.'
