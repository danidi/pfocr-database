caption: '(A) Integrin α3β1 activates a MEK/ERK signaling pathway that promotes selection
  of the proximal polyadenylation site (polyA #1) within the MMP-9 gene, thereby generating
  the short, more stable mRNA transcript and subsequent synthesis of MMP-9 protein.
  (B) In the absence of α3β1, MEK/ERK signaling is diminished and polyadenylation
  defaults to the distal polyadenylation site (polyA #2), thereby generating the long,
  ARE-containing transcript that is subject to mRNA degradation. Positions of the
  stop codon, AREs (yellow boxes), poly(A) signals, and poly(A+) tails are indicated.'
