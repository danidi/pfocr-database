caption: According to the humoral hypothesis of fever induction, the pyrogenic cytokines
  IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α gain access to the hypothalamus via fenestrations in the BBB
  in the circumventricular organs or via active transport mechanisms mediated by the
  cells surrounding the hypothalamus. A key feature of the humoral hypothesis is that
  the pyrogenic cytokines activate the febrile response indirectly, by inducing local
  endothelial cells or microglial cells to secrete PGE2. The PGE2 then acts via prostaglandin
  E receptor 3 to initiate a neuronal response that regulates the body temperature.
  According to the neuronal hypothesis, C5a stimulates PGE2 production in the liver,
  and signaling to the hypothalamus occurs via a neural pathway mediated by the vagus
  nerve and the nucleus tractus solitarius.
