caption: The microRNA biogenesis pathway. The canonical biogenesis pathway starts
  in the nucleus by cleavage of the pri-miRNA transcript by the Drosha-DGCR8 microprocessor
  complex []. After nuclear processing, the resulting precursor hairpin (pre-miRNA)
  is transported into the cytoplasm by Exportin-5 in complex with Ran-GTP []. In the
  cytoplasm, cleavage into an approximately 22-nucleotide duplex is achieved by the
  RNase III Dicer [] and its interactors TRBP and PACT [,]. To form the active RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC) that performs gene silencing, the functional guide strand
  has to be separated from the passenger strand, which is degraded subsequently [].
  miRNA, microRNA.
