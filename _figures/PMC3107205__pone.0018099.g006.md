caption: 'Reactions with open arrows occur in bacteria and reactions with filled arrow
  occur in eukaryotes while dotted arrow reactions are common in both bacteria and
  animals. Enzymes involved are as follows; 1: N-acetylglucosamine kinase; 2: N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate
  deacetylase; 3: Glucosamine kinase; 4: Phosphoglucosamine mutase; 5: Glucosamine-6-phosphate
  N-acetyltransferees; 6: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase; 7: Phosphoacetylglucosamine
  mutase.'
