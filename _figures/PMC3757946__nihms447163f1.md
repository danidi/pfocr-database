caption: 'The schematic representation of our working model. Several cardiovascular
  risk factors induce pro-inflammatory signaling pathway inducing T cells activation.
  T effector cell activation promotes pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to break-down
  of immune tolerance and finally autoimmune disease. In contrast, enhance Tregs expansion
  and function inhibit Atherosclerosis by maintaining immune tolerance. Suppression
  of Teff and others immune cells by Treg is proposed in 5 mechanisms: Cell-Cell contact,
  Granzytmes, Suppressive Cytokines, Adenosine and micro RNA. Vitamin D3, Statins
  and IL-2 are new therapeutic targets that promote Treg survival and homeostasis
  in order to maintain the balance in the immune system.'
