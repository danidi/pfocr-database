caption: Cancer cells undergo the Warburg effect to support their rapid proliferation.
  Normal cells that are not transformed usually metabolize glucose by undergoing oxidative
  metabolism in the mitochondria (TCA cycle and OXPHOS), which yields 36 ATPs per
  glucose molecule. In contrast, cancer cells undergo aerobic glycolysis and generate
  lactate as an end product, which yields 4 ATPs per glucose molecule (only 2 ATPs
  if oxygen is limited in a hypoxic environment). The cancer cell makes up for this
  inefficient energy production mechanism by upregulating glucose transporters (GLUTs)
  and increasing glucose uptake, and this is the basis for tumor imaging in the clinic
  (via FDG-PET). Because glucose is not metabolized completely to CO2, the pentose
  phosphate pathway and salvage pathways scavenge carbons and nitrogens from glycolytic
  intermediates to replenish the pools of dNTPs, amino acids (AAs), and fatty acids
  (FAs). This serves a conduit for biosynthetic pathways to replicate DNA in the nucleus,
  all of the proteins in the proteome, and lipids. The rationale behind this strategy
  is that acquiring the raw materials to double cellular biomass is a more important
  challenge for rapidly dividing cancer cells than generating sufficient ATP levels.
