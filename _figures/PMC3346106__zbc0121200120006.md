caption: Model of the molecular mechanism of bilirubin-induced growth arrest in hVSMC.
  Bilirubin treatment decreases the cellular protein content of cyclin D1 and Raf.
  It also inhibits phosphorylation and activation of members of the Raf/ERK/MAPK pathway,
  resulting in the accumulation of hypophosphorylated at Ser-608 and Ser-780 Rb that
  is a key suppressor of cell cycle transition from G0/G1 into S phase. The hypophosphorylation
  profile of Rb facilitates Rb-YY1 binding, retention in the cytosol, and consequent
  nuclear YY1 depletion. Bilirubin also activates intracellular Ca2+influx, Ca2+-calpain
  protease circuit activation, and YY1 cleavage, further altering the nuclear YY1
  availability for transcription. The reduced level of nuclear YY1 results in altered
  mRNA content of pol I, pol II, and pol III transcribed genes with important functions
  in the VSMC cell cycle control.
