caption: NPRL2+ cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) [CDDP]) treatment effector
  caspase, caspase-3, is activated and PARP is cleaved. Therefore, our result that
  the combination treatment of NPRL2 and CDDP activates a caspase cascade and hyperphosphorylates
  H2AX suggests that this combination treatment can strongly enhance the apoptotic
  pathway. Adding NPRL2 treatment to CDDP significantly enhanced Chk2 and Chk1 kinase
  activity, and NPRL2+ CDDP treatment remarkably degraded the interaction of Cdc2
  and cyclin B1, leading to the inactivation of the Cdc2/cyclin B1 complex and arrest
  in G2/M. The cells arrested at the G2/M phase ultimately promote apoptosis with
  characteristic nuclear fragmentation. This combination treatment strongly inactivates
  Cdc25A and Cdc25C, and phospho-Cdc2 (Tyr-15), an inactivated type of Cdc2, is clearly
  increased in NPRL2+ CDDP treatment.
