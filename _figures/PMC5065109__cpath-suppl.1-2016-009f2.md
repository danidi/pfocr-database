caption: 'Current hypotheses for IFNγ-mediated effect on NSPC activity.Notes: IFNγ
  binds to the IFNγ receptor (IFNGR1 and 2) and activates Janus-activated kinases
  1 and 2 and signal transducers and activators of transcription-1 (JAK-STAT1) pathway.
  In neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs), STAT1 activation blocks NSPC proliferation
  through decreased expression of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes.
  In fetal NSPCs, IFNγ-mediated STAT1 activation decreases NSPC differentiation in
  the neuronal lineage (A. Kulkarni, unpublished data). However, studies with adult
  NSPCs report that IFNγ-mediated STAT1 activation results in increased neuronal differentiation.
  STAT1 activation leads to increased expression and secretion of the sonic hedgehog
  (Shh) protein, which in turn causes anomalous and concurrent expression of both
  glial and neuronal markers in the same cell. Moreover, IFNγ-mediated STAT1 activation
  and Shh expression in granule precursor cells leads to increased NSPC proliferation.
  In Paju cells, IFNγ-induced activation of the extracellular-signal regulated kinase-1/2
  (ERK-1/2) increases neuronal differentiation, which may be independent of STAT1
  activation. In C17.2 cells, IFNγ-mediated activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase
  (JNK) pathway causes neuronal differentiation, without the activation of ERK1/2
  pathway. Developmental cytokines such as the leukemia inhibitory factor and ciliary
  neurotropic factor mediate glial differentiation through STAT3. IFNγ-mediated activation
  of STAT3 is observed in fetal NSPCs; however, the role of this pathway in NSPC differentiation
  is yet unclear.'
