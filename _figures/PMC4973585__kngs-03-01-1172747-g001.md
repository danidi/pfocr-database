caption: 'Schematic representation of Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas role in radial glial
  cells fate commitment decisions. (A) Radial glial cells under physiological conditions
  have the ability to perform self-renewal divisions at early developmental stages,
  while at later stages they differentiate toward neuronal and glial cells. In addition,
  radial glial cells generate the adult SEZ niche cells, the multiciliated ependymal
  cells and the type-B1 adult neural stem cells. Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas control
  the molecular pathway responsible for the generation of multiciliated ependymal
  cells, acting antagonistically to Notch signaling, which maintains radial glial
  cells in undifferentiated state and acting upstream of c-Myb and Foxj1, known for
  their role in multiciliated cell differentiation. (B) Upon Mcidas and GemC1/Lynkeas
  overexpression there is a shift of radial glial cells fate decisions toward the
  multiciliated ependymal cell lineage, as the molecular pathway, involving c-Myb
  and Foxj1 is initiated earlier. (C) Upon Mcidas or GemC1/Lynkeas depletion, the
  commitment of radial glial cell toward the ependymal cell lineage is blocked, resulting
  in decrease of c-Myb and Foxj1 expressing cells and leads consequently to a decrease
  of the multiciliated ependymal cells generated in the wall of the lateral ventricles.
  In addition, their depletion leads to increased number of GFAP+ astroglial or astroglial-like
  cells suggesting a change in the fate commitment decisions of radial glial cells.
