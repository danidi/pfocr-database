caption: Peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation are dysregulated in both
  early and late CKD(A) Diagram depicting dysregulation of fatty acid oxidation in
  both peroxisomes and mitochondria. Genes in purple are those downregulated in early
  CKD (day 32) in the β-oxidation pathway in both peroxisome and mitochondria. Genes
  in blue are those downregulated at both stages of CKD in the TCA cycle and β-oxidation
  pathways in mitochondria.(B) Diagram showing the average predicted flux ratio for
  the metabolic pathways on days 32 and 100 compared with control (baseline); positive
  and negative flux ratios indicate increased and decreased flux at both stages of
  CKD, respectively.
