caption: E2 might modulate PTEN and MDH2 in endometrial carcinoma via GPR30-dependent
  mechanisms. Our previous data in 2009 has demonstrated that E2 stimulated the proliferation
  of endometrial carcinoma cells via MEK/ERK/MAPK pathway. In the present study, we
  revealed that E2 might promote the proliferation, migration and invasion but inhibited
  apoptosis in endometrial carcinoma through upregulating the expression of MDH2 and
  downregulating the expression of PTEN via GPR30-dependent pathway. There might be
  a complicated regulation network between MDH2 and PTEN.
