caption: The FERM domain proteins Merlin and Expanded/FMD6 have been proposed to function
  upstream of the core kinase signaling cassette together with the WW domain protein
  Kibra. The sterile 20 kinase Tao-1 directly phosphorylates Hippo and MST kinases
  in vitro and promotes pathway activation in vivo. The scaffolding proteins Salvador/WW45
  and Mats/Mob promote Hippo/MST and Warts/Lats kinase activity, respectively. Hippo/MST
  phosphorylates Warts/Lats, which in turn phosphorylates Yorkie/Yap to promote 14-3-3
  binding. 14-3-3 sequesters Yorkie/Yap in the cytoplasm, preventing the transcription
  of target genes that promote tissue growth. In addition, Fat signaling (not shown)
  has been shown to regulate Warts stability and Yorkie activation in parallel to
  Hippo.
