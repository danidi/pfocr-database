caption: 'Transforming growth factor-p (TGFβ) signalling can be inhibited by: sequestering
  ligands using soluble receptor ectodomain constructs (ligand traps) derived from
  TGFβ receptortype II (TpRII) or TpRIII; using TGFβ-neutralizing antibodies; or with
  TpRII or TpRI kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, translation of TGFβ mRNA can be blocked
  by targeting TGFβ mRNA with antisense oligonucleotides, thus preventing the production
  of the ligand. Different small-molecule kinase inhibitors against TpRI have been
  developed to block its kinase activity. Peptide inhibitors against specific TGFβ
  ligands are also used. Other approaches block the transformation of TGFβ from the
  latent to the active form. Three molecules are shown that either affect TGFβ signalling
  indirectly (losartan) or that have an as-yet-unidentified target (tranilast and
  pirfenidone). All of these approaches decrease the initiation of intracellular receptor
  signalling pathways, such as phosphorylation of downstream receptor-specific SMADs
  (R-SMADs), and thereby blunt the transcriptional regulation of target genes. ATI,
  angiotensin II type 1 receptor; co-TFs, co-transcription factors; FOXH1B, forkhead
  box protein H1B; LEF, lymphoid enhancer-binding factor; LSKL, Leu-Ser-Lys-Leu peptide;
  TRX, thioredoxin.'
