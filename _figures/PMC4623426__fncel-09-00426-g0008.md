caption: Model for TGFβ1-Smad3 pathway regulation in aged microglia. Diverse stimuli,
  including inflammatory stimulation and hypoxia, induce astrocytes to secrete TGFβ1.
  Binding of TGFβ1 to its receptor results in the activation of the Smad3 pathway,
  as well as MAPKs and PI3K signaling in microglia. Thus, TGFβ1 regulates the inflammatory
  activation of microglia in addition to modifying the SRs profile expressed by the
  cell. SRs appear to be involved both in the uptake of Aβ and in the activation of
  glial cells. Several of the effects of TGFβ1 on cell viability, reduction of inflammatory
  cytokines and reactive species, and expression of SRs depend on the activation of
  Smad3. In aging or after exposure to chronic inflammatory conditions, canonical
  activation of Smad3 is greatly reduced, whereas MAPKs remains activatible. As result
  of this change on TGFβ1 signaling, microglia show increased cytotoxicity, undergo
  changes on their expression of SRs and decrease their Aβ clearance. Thus, reduced
  TGFβ1-Smad3 activity on aged microglia appears to impair the beneficial effect of
  TGFβ1.
