caption: Diverse signalling pathways initiated by maturation initiation hormones (MIHs)
  lead to a universal biochemical core, activating maturation promoting factor (MPF).
  Due to the diversity of molecular pathways controlling the resumption of meiosis,
  this scheme is not exhaustive but is based on a few examples among those studied.
  MIHs are released from somatic cells near the oocyte (follicle cells, ectoderm cells
  or others) in response to hormonal (luteinizing hormone (LH) in vertebrates or gonad-stimulating
  substance (GSS) in starfish) and environmental inputs (dark/light transition, temperature,
  sea water, etc.). MIH molecules have different identities between species, and the
  types of receptors mediating the MIH action are also diverse; see text for details.
  In amphibian and fish oocytes, steroids recruit canonical nuclear receptors unusually
  associated with membranes in oocytes, but also progestin-specific membrane receptors
  most probably acting through Gαi and Gβγ. MIH receptor activation leads either to
  the downregulation of adenylate cyclase, a decrease in cAMP level and PKA activity
  in vertebrates, or the opposite regulation in various species of hydrozoans or nemerteans.
  In vertebrates, PKA substrates dephosphorylated following the drop in PKA activity
  include Arpp19 in Xenopus, Cdc25 in Xenopus and mouse, and Wee1B in mouse. PKA substrates
  remain to be identified in species where PKA activity increases. In starfish, the
  dissociation of Gαi from Gβγ activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) which leads
  to serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) activation, independently of
  cAMP and PKA. In other species, cytoplasmic calcium release is critical in the pathway.
  In many vertebrate oocytes, the drop in PKA activity indirectly activates the synthesis
  of new proteins required for MPF activation, such as Cyclin B1 and, in Xenopus,
  the kinase Mos. In many other species, MPF is activated without the need for new
  synthesized proteins. The final step of MPF activation (orange box) is common to
  all animals. Cyclin B-Cdk1 is activated by Cdk1 dephosphorylation at T14 and Y15
  due to the reverse of the balance of activities between its regulators, the phosphatase
  Cdc25 and the kinases Wee1/Myt1. This activation is accelerated by an auto-amplification
  loop. In parallel, the Cdk1 opposing enzyme, the PP2A phosphatase, is inhibited
  by Arpp19 phosphorylated by the kinase Greatwall (Gwl).
