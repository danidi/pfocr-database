caption: 'Three proteolytic cleavage steps are required for canonical Notch receptor
  signalling. The first proteolytic cleavage step (S1 cleavage) is mediated by Furin,
  occurs in the trans-Golgi and produces a heterodimer composed of a ligand-binding
  Notch extracellular domain (NECD) and a single-pass transmembrane signalling domain
  referred to as the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). The functional importance
  of this cleavage is still somewhat unclear,. The association of NECD and the transmembrane
  portion of the receptor heterodimer is dependent on non-covalent interactions. Pathway
  activation occurs when the NECD binds to Delta– Serrate–LAG2 (DSL) ligands that
  are expressed on the membrane of neighbouring cells. This trans interaction results
  in the second proteolytic event (S2 cleavage) of the Notch receptor, which clears
  most of the NECD from the outer portion of the membrane, a process mediated by the
  TACE (also known as ADAM17) metalloproteinase. The NECD is subsequently released
  and internalized through endocytosis by the ligand-expressing cell, where it undergoes
  lysosomal degradation. Subsequently, γ-secretase cleaves the tethered receptor near
  the inner leaflet of the membrane (S3 cleavage) in the Notch-expressing cell, producing
  the transcriptionally active NICD, which translocates to the nucleus through a poorly
  understood process. In the nucleus, the NICD interacts with Drosophila melanogaster
  Suppressor of Hairless (SU(H)) and the transcriptional co-activator, Mastermind
  (MAM) — the mammalian orthologues of which are CBF1–SU(H)–LAG1 (CSL) and Mastermind-like
  (MAML) proteins, respectively — thereby inducing transcription of target genes,
  by converting CSL into a transcription activator through the exchange of co-repressors
  for co-activators. Many Notch target genes encode transcriptional regulators, which
  influence cell-fate decisions through the regulation of basic helix–loop–helix hairy
  and enhancer of split (HES) proteins: Hairy and Enhancer of split (E(SPL)) in D.
  melanogaster and their mammalian orthologues HES1 and HES5. The HES proteins subsequently
  regulate the expression of genes involved in Notch-dependent cell-fate determination,
  such as apoptosis, proliferation or differentiation. By contrast, expression of
  ligands and the Notch receptor on the same cells results in cis inhibition of Notch
  signals and receptor degradation. Recycling the receptor through the endocytic pathway
  has been shown to be important for receptor and ligand maturation, non-canonical
  signalling and degradation (). Notch activity is regulated by ubiquitylation of
  nuclear NICD by the E3 ubiquitin ligases, SEL-10 in Caenorhabditis elegans and Suppressor
  of Deltex (SU(DX)) in D. melanogaster, leading to NICD degradation, thus allowing
  the cell to become ligand-competent once again. The ubiquitylation status of the
  receptor (by Kurtz, Deltex and Shrub) in the multi-vesicular bodies can also determine
  whether Notch continues to signal or undergoes proteasomal degradation. Additionally,
  signal attenuation is achieved through lysosomal degradation of the NICD.'
