caption: Model of cellular intoxication by LT. The 83 kDa PA protein secreted by B.
  anthracis binds to the host cell surface receptor (ANTXR1/TEM8, ANTXR2/CMG2 or the
  integrins α4β1 and α5β1), and is proteolytically cleaved by host furin, releasing
  a 20 kDa fragment from the N-terminal of the protein. The remaining 63 kDa PA fragment
  heptamerises and binds to LF to form LT. The toxins are then internalised in endosomal
  vesicles which are subsequently acidified, triggering the translocation of LT into
  the host cytosol. LT inactivates the MKKs, the central step in the MAPK signaling
  pathway, and induces the Nlrp1 activation of the inflammasome.
