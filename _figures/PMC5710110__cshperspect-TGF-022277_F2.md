caption: The transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-induced Smad signaling pathway.
  TGF-β binds to the type II receptor and recruits the type I receptor, whereby the
  type II receptor phosphorylates and activates type I receptor. The type I receptor,
  in turn, phosphorylates receptor-activated Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) at the carboxy-terminal
  SXS motif, which results in release of these Smads from the receptor complex in
  the cytoplasm and triggers their translocation into the nucleus. Smad4 acts as a
  common partner of activated Smads to help execute their function. Smad proteins
  continuously undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and interact with nuclear pore
  complexes. Once in the nucleus, activated Smad proteins form complexes that regulate
  target gene transcription, generating hundreds of early gene responses. Mechanisms
  of phosphorylation and polyubiquitylation account for the signal termination of
  the activated Smads. On the right, TGF-β target genes in epithelial cells are grouped
  on the basis of their biological responses. Highlighted in red are gene responses
  repressed by TGF-β, and in green are gene responses induced by TGF-β. These are
  central for the cytostatic program induced by TGF-β.
