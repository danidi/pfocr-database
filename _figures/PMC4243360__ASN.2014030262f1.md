caption: Pathways of apoptosis. In the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, cellular stress
  leads to the oligomerization of Bax and Bak, an event that permeabilizes the mitochondrial
  outer membrane, resulting in the release of apoptogenic factors, including cytochrome
  c (Cyt.c). In the cytosol, Cyt.c binds Apaf-1 to recruit and activate caspase 9,
  which further cleaves and activates executioner caspases, such as caspase 3. In
  the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, ligation of death receptors leads to the recruitment
  of adapter proteins and subsequent activation of caspase 8, which further activate
  executioner caspases and prevent necroptosis (). Active caspase 8 also cleaves Bid
  to its truncated form tBid, which translocates to mitochondria to activate the intrinsic
  pathway to amplify the apoptotic cascade. In the ER stress pathway, caspase 12 mediates
  the activation of executioner caspases. ER stress may activate the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway through Ca2+signaling and the induction of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins,
  such as PUMA. IP3R, inositol trisphosphate receptor.
