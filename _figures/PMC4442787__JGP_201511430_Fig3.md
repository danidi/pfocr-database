caption: In the conventional model of α-MSH/AgRP signaling at PVN MC4R neurons, AgRP
  acts as a competitive inhibitor to block α-MSH stimulation of Gαs and as an inverse
  agonist to block constitutive signaling through this pathway (central orange box).  propose
  that AgRP also acts as an agonist at MC4R to activate Kir7.1, and thereby hyperpolarize
  the cell independently of α-MSH and the Gαs pathway (left circle). At some sites,
  α-MSH may act independently of AgRP to stimulate Gαs signaling and also to close
  Kir7.1 (right circle). In the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), α-MSH activates
  KATP channels through a Gαs pathway (lower right). (Reprinted by permission from
