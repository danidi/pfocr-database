caption: TGFβ canonical signal transduction pathway and transcriptional responses
  mediating TGFβ growth inhibitory effects. At the cell surface, TGFβ assembles a
  complex of transmembrane receptor serine/threonine kinases (types I and II) and
  induces transphosphorylation and activation of the type I receptor (TβR-I, ALK5)
  by the type II receptor kinase (TβR-II). Activated TβR-I phosphorylates the main
  TGFβ downstream effectors, Smad2 and Smad3, at C-terminal serines. Activated Smad2
  and Smad3 then associate with Smad4 and the complexes translocate into the nucleus
  and regulate transcription of target genes, involved in TGFβ-induced growth inhibition.
  Downregulation of c-myc, CDC25A and Id family members and upregulation of p15 and
  p21 CDK inhibitors are key events in this response.
