caption: Co-translational translocation in eukaryotes relies on SRP for targeting
  to the Sec61 translocon. Ribosomal protein synthesis is coupled to translocation,
  which protects the peptide and effectively uses the energy from chain elongation
  as a driving force. The channel also facilitates membrane integration of hydrophobic
  transmembrane domains (TMDs, dark blue box) through a lateral gate. Multiple accessory
  factors reside in the local membrane environment and are dynamically recruited to
  assist the function of the translocon. The lumenal signal peptidase complex (SPC)
  cleaves signal peptides (orange box) from the mature protein, while uncleaved signal
  anchors (yellow box) function as transmembrane domains in integral membrane proteins.
  Inhibitors of co-translational translocation are indicated in blue text and the
  targets are explained in more detail in Table
