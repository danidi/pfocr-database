caption: The extrinsic pathway is initiated by biding of death ligands such as TNF-α
  and Fas ligand to their cell-surface death receptors such as TNFR and Fas. The death
  domains of these receptors recruit adaptor molecules like FADD and caspase-8, which
  leads to the activation of caspase-8. Activated caspase-8 cleaves the effector caspases
  such as caspase-3, thereby activating them and inducing apoptosis. The extrinsic
  pathway interacts with the intrinsic pathway via caspse-8-mediated cleavage of Bid.
  The intrinsic pathway is initiated by release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins
  such as cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo into the cytosol. Released cytochrome c forms
  an apoptosome with Apaf-1 and caspase-9, which leads to caspase-9 activation. Smac/Diablo
  enhances caspase activation through the neutralization of IAP proteins.
