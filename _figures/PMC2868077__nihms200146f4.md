caption: 'Schematic representation of fatty acid oxidation pathway. Fatty acyl-CoAs
  are transported into the mitochondrial matrix by the carnitine transport system,
  with CPT1 being a key and rate-limiting component (Reaction A). Once inside the
  mitochondrial matrix, fatty acyl-CoAs are oxidized in a series of repeated steps
  that each release acetyl-CoA. The basic outlines of this pathway includes the following:
  transfer to carnitine to acyl-CoAs by CPT-1; transport of acyl-carnitines through
  inner mitochondrial membranes; regeneration of acyl-CoA by carnitine acyltransferase
  II (CPT-2); successive rounds of β-oxidation of fatty acids. Acetyl-CoA then enters
  the citric acid cycle, where it is oxidized in the same fashion as the acetyl-CoA
  derived from glycolysis. As acetyl-CoA levels rise, acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACCs,
  Reaction B) convert it into malonyl-CoA, first committed intermediated in fatty
  acid biosynthesis and a potent inhibitor of CPT-1. Key regulators of malonyl-CoA
  levels include malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD, Reaction C) and fatty acid synthase
  (FAS, Reaction D).'
