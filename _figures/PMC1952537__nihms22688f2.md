caption: 1. The proteasomal degradative pathway and ER quality control mechanisms
  are closely coupled. When misfolded upon synthesis, 7TMRs such as the delta opioid
  receptor (δOR), calcium sensing receptor (CaR) and thyrotropin releasing hormone
  receptor (TRHR) are ubiquitinated, retrotranslocated in a Sec61 dependent manner
  and degraded by the 26S proteasomal complex. 2. The metabotropic glutamate receptor
  (mGluR5) and Follitropin receptor (FSHR) are reported to be ubiquitinated and degraded
  by the proteasomal pathway. 3. Agonist stimulation of the β2AR leads to rapid polyubiquitination
  of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). This GRK2 regulation involves β-arrestin
  and Mdm2-dependent ubiquitination (not shown). Polyubiquitination of the Gαs subunit
  is also induced upon activation of the β2AR. Whether 7TMR stimulation plays a role
  in other examples of G protein subunit ubiquitination is currently unknown. These
  examples are discussed in the text. 4. Stimulation of Gαq-coupled receptors (e.g.
  muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) leads to the polyubiquitination and proteasome
  dependent degradation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors located in the ER membrane resulting
  in a suppression of Ins(1,4,5)P3 induced Ca2+ mobilization. 5. Recent studies indicate
  that USP4, a deubiquitinating enzyme, can remove the polyubiquitin chains on ubiquitinated
  A2A adenosine receptors, thereby preventing receptor degradation and promoting 7TMR
  expression on the cell surface.
