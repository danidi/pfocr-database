caption: Wortmannin sensitivity of deletion strains in the DNA replication and damage
  checkpoint pathway. DNA replication block and DNA damage both trigger the MEC1-RAD53-DUN1
  kinase cascade, leading to transcriptional activation of the RNR essential for DNA
  synthesis. The checkpoint proteins also signal effectors to slow cell cycle progression
  and allow time necessary for DNA repair. Green, wortmannin-resistant deletions;
  red, wortmannin-hypersensitive deletions.
