caption: Signaling networks control chemotaxis. Depicted is a network of signaling
  events triggered by cAMP to control front projection and back contraction in Dictyostelium.
  At the front, binding of cAMP to GPCR leads to the activation of RasG and RasC,
  which in turn stimulate the activities of PI3K and TORC2, respectively. PI3K produces
  PIP3, which recruits PH-domain containing proteins including PKBA, CRAC and PhdA.
  PDK [] and TORC2, composed of PiaA, Rip3, Lst8, and the Tor kinase, mediate the
  phosphorylation and activation of PKBA and PKBR1. PLA2 acts in parallel with the
  PIP3 pathway to regulate actin polymerization. Front signals also inhibit myosin
  II activity through the activation of the myosin heavy chain kinase (MHCKA) [, ].
  At the back, PTEN is responsible for the degradation of PIP3. Myosin II is assembled
  into contractile filaments that suppress pseudopod formation and promote back retraction.
  The cGMP binding protein GbpC promotes the assembly and activity of myosin II. Positive
  links between components are indicated by (→) or dotted arrows (less defined steps)
  and inhibitory links are indicted by (⊥).
