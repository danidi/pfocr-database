caption: WDFY1, a new player in the TLR-TRIF pathwayTLR3-stimulated signaling is fully
  dependent on TRIF, and TLR4 stimulates two signaling pathways, one of which is dependent
  on TRIF. In both cases, TRIF-dependent signaling occurs from an endosomal platform.
  WDFY1 is present on the membrane of early endosomes and interacts with TLR3 and
  TLR4 upon ligand engagement. This stimulates TRIF recruitment and initiates signal
  transduction, ultimately leading to the induction of gene expression. The recruitment
  of WDFY1 to TLR3 occurs through interaction with the TIR domain and is dependent
  on the presence of specific tyrosine phosphorylations.
