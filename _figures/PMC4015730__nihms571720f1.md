caption: 'Wnt cloning scheme using WNT1 as an example. WNT1 cDNA was amplified by
  PCR using WNT1-specific “STOP” and “Non-STOP” primers. The PCR product was then
  transferred, using TOPO cloning, into the pENTR/D-TOPO Gateway Entry vector, and
  subsequently shuttled, using recombination, into the pcDNA3.2/V5-DEST Gateway Destination
  vector. The outcome of the cloning process is 4 WNT1 plasmids: 2 Entry vectors (WNT1
  STOP and WNT1 Non-STOP) and 2 Destination vectors (WNT1 and WNT1-V5).'
