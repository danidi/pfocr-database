caption: Ghrelin-induced effector pathways and unavowed signaling hotspots. Ghrelin
  activates the cascade via GHSR1a/CaMKKβ/AMPK to suppress endoplasmic reticulum stress.
  LEAP2 has been suggested to inhibit GHSR1a. Ghrelin-activated AMPK inhibits mTOR
  via activation of TSC and inactivation of Raptor, leading to reduced phosphorylation
  of ULK1 and therefore enhanced ULK1 kinase activity which triggers autophagy ().
  Ghrelin’s pro-autophagic effect has been shown to improve hepatosteatosis by increasing
  abundance of mtDNA and inducing mitochondrial free fatty acid β-oxidation. Not only
  CaMKKβ but also SIRT1-p53 modulates AMPK in the setting of autophagy (e.g., in hypothalamic
  ghrelin signaling). Ghrelin can act pro-autophagically via the growth hormone (GH)
  under fat-depleted famine conditions by activating GH receptor-mediated JKA2-pStat
  cascades. Furthermore, ghrelin has been shown to upregulate antifibrotic (miR-30a)
  microRNA and downregulate profibrotic (miR-21) microRNA, thus affecting the TGF-β1-Smad
  pathway and ameliorating skeletal muscle fibrosis upon injury. Plasma membrane-associated
  GOAT has been proposed to locally convert desacylghrelin to ghrelin. Also desacylghrelin
  can stimulate the AMPK activity in order to induce autophagy by decreasing reactive
  oxygen species accumulation and apoptosis, thereby protecting e.g., cardiomyocytes
  from ischemic injury. Furthermore, desacylghrelin has been shown to stimulate SOD-2
  which leads to increased expression of miR-221 and miR-222. In turn, these miRs
  suppress p57kip2 expression in satellite cells of skeletal muscle, thereby accelerating
  cell cycle re-entry and proliferation. These events facilitate muscle regeneration.
  Desacylghrelin-mediated SOD-2 upregulation also increases myogenesis and decreases
  reactive oxygen species generation, thus promoting tissue regeneration after injury
  (). It has remained unclear whether desacylghrelin/ghrelin can be internalized by
  the target cells and may act in the cytoplasm, e.g., on AKT or ERK1,2 or by far,
  whether ghrelin can translocate to the nucleus and affect gene expression. Does
  ghrelin also associate with cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) or other binding partners
  at the plasma membrane and/or undergo recycling? It is possible that the desacylghrelin/ghrelin-mediated
  signaling cascades might be highly intertwined with the signaling cascades mediated
  by the CAMs. CAMs, such as cadherins, form signaling units with TGF-β1. The interplay
  between CAMs with their binding partners leads to recruitment of catenins and junction
  plakoglobin to the nucleus and regulate transcription [e.g., α-catenin can regulate
  actin bundling (AKT)]. CAMs convey also signals to kinases (for example, SRC family
  kinases and the Tyr-protein kinase) and phosphatases (PLCγ). Given that the CAM-mediated
  cascades govern morphogenic events such as cytoskeletal reorganization, process
  formation, neurite outgrowth and dynamic events like proliferation and migration
  (), it is conceivable that one possible action of ghrelin to stimulate regeneration
  could be via affecting these CAM-cascades. AKT (actin); AMPK (5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated
