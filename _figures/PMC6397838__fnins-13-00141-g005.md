caption: The mevalonate biosynthetic pathway. It operates in all eukaryotes, thus
  mammals and humans inclusive, but with some “branch-specific “variability that is
  mainly linked to the presence or absence of the gene coding for the enzyme squalene
  synthase that is needed for the synthesis of squalene. This is the precursor of
  cholesterol, with its many functions, e.g., in the synthesis of sterols and “vertebrate-type
  steroid hormones”. Insects, nematodes and some other species cannot synthesize squalene.
  Hence, cholesterol is a vitamin for them. They 1215 1216 convert farnesol into esters
  () whose juvenile hormone activity (in bioassays) is much 1217 higher than the mild
  one of farnesol itself. Adapted from , ). Copyright permission not required.
