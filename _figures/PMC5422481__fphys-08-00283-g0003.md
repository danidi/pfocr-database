caption: Conversion of nitrogen in waste products. Log scale expression of transcripts
  for enzymes involved in the synthesis of nitrogen waste products in A. aegypti MTs.
  In general, in the classical urea cycle, transcripts are lower in larvae compared
  to adults, with the exception of argininosuccinate lyase. In the alternative urea
  pathway, transcripts are higher in larvae compared to adults with the exception
  of allantoicase. Shown is the log scale transcript expression of each transporter
  we found to be expressed, larvae in red, adults in blue.
