caption: The importance of ICOS+ Th1 cells in ICI therapy. Genetic absence of CTLA-4
  or blocking with anti–CTLA-4 antibody induces the differentiation of ICOS+ Th1-like
  cells. Additionally, concomitant PD-1 blockade may promote the proliferation of
  these ICOS+ T cells, which have the ability to migrate to tumors. In the tumor microenvironment,
  ICOS pathway activation by APCs or tumor cells induces positive co-stimulation,
  while CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 blockade prevents negative co-stimulatory signals. The
  result is a population of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells with high expression of
  IFN-γ and TNF-α, which can recognize tumor antigens and boost the antitumor immune
  response. APC, Antigen presenting cell; CTLA-4, Cytotoxic T cell antigen 4; ICOS,
  Inducible co-stimulator; IFN, Interferon; PD-1, Programmed death 1; TNF, Tumor necrosis
  factor.
