caption: AKT reduces the growth-inhibitory function of TGF-β1. (A) Ingenuity pathway
  analysis of genes that are differentially expressed in estrogen-treated MCF-7p and
  MCF-7AKT cells. Genes indicated in green are repressed by estrogen, and those indicated
  in red are induced by estrogen in either or both cell types. (B) The effect of TGF-β1
  on proliferation. Cells were treated with TGF-β (25 ng/ml) with or without estrogen
  (10−10 M) for 3 days, and the cell proliferation was measured by bromodeoxyuridine-enzyme-linked
  immunosorbent assay. Averages and standard deviations from four independent experiments
  are shown (TGF-β-treated MCF-7p cells versus TGF-β-treated MCF-7AKT cells [*, P
  = 0.01]).
