caption: Hematopoietic cell lineage signaling pathway in the male and female groups.
  (A) Hematopoietic cell lineage signaling pathway map in the male group. Genes indicated
  in red were upregulated in the male group and those in gray were not differentially
  expressed. (B) Hematopoietic cell lineage signaling pathway map in the female group.
  Genes in red were upregulated in females and those in gray were not significantly
  differentially expressed. NK, natural killer; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; CFU,
  colony-forming units; CFU-GM, CFU-granulocyte, macrophage; BFU, burst-forming unit;
  IL, interleukin; Ig, immunoglobulin, GEMM, granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte and
  megakaryocyte; CFU-MK, CFU-megakaryocyte.
