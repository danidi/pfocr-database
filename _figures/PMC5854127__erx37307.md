caption: Schematic representation of the proposed model for the GhMKK6–miR5272a feedback
  loop. After F. oxysporum infects cotton, the GhMKK6-mediated signal transduction
  pathway is activated, which enhances F. oxysporum resistance via inducing SA- and/or
  JA-mediated defence responses. miR5272a regulates the expression of GhMKK6 via a
  negative-feedback loop mechanism. (This figure is available in colour at JXB online.)
