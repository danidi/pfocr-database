caption: Mitophagy pathways. Mitophagy can be divided into Parkin-dependent or independent
  pathways. Under normal conditions, PINK1 localizes to mitochondria and is translocated
  to the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM), where it is cleaved and subsequently
  degraded by an N-end rule pathway. However, when mitochondria become depolarized,
  PINK1 accumulates at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and recruits Parkin.
  Activated Parkin leads to the ubiquitination of substrates and the recruitment of
  autophagy receptors to initiate mitophagy. In addition, Parkin-independent mitophagy
  includes receptor-mediated and ubiquitin ligase-mediated mitophagy. BNIP3, BCL2/adenovirus
  E1B 19 kDa interacting protein 3; FUNDC1, FUN14 domain-containing protein 1; NDP52,
  nuclear dot protein 52 kDa; NIX, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa interacting protein
  3 like; OPTN, optineurin; Ub, ubiquitin.
