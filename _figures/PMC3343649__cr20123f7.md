caption: Working model for Nbs1 function and regulation in neocortex. Endogenous DNA
  damage during rapid development of neocortical neurons activates ATM-Chk2 and ATR-Chk1
  signaling. However, defective Nbs1 impairs ATR-Chk1 pathway rather than ATM-Chk2
  signaling. ATM-Chk2 signaling in Nbs1-deficient neocortex activates p53-Hzf pathway
  and induces defective proliferation rather than apoptosis of neuroprogenitors, leading
  to microcephaly.
