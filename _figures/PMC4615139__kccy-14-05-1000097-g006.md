caption: Schematic representation of proposed mechanism of cordycepin-induced apoptosis
  and cell cycle arrest in NB-4 and U937 cells. In response to cordycepin induced
  DNA damage, Chk2 is phosphorylated independent of ATM/ATR. The activated Chk2 can
  then induce ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Cdc25A by phosphorylating Cdc25A on
  S124. The degradation of Cdc25A leads to the accumulation of CDK2 in its inactive
  form, and results in the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Cordycepin increases the levels
  of p53 which repress the expression of cyclin A2, cyclin E, and CDK2, which then
  cause S-phase arrest. Cordycepin leads to activation of caspase-8 and caspase-9,
  which then cleave executioner caspase-3. Once activated, caspase-3 cleaves its substrates,
  such as PARP, and triggers cell apoptosis. The increased levels of p53 can also
  induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol promoting the activation
  of caspase-9. In addition, the expression of anti-apoptotic protein XIAP was inhibited
  by the upregulation of p53 in NB-4 cells, while the levels of XIAP were not affected
  in U937 cells. Cordycepin also inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, and blocks
  the activation of MAPK pathway. The blockage of MAPK signaling therefore sensitizes
  cordycepin-induced cell apoptosis.
