caption: The role of the bitter taste receptor T2R38 in human sinonasal epithelial
  innate immunity. Reading from left to right, gram-negative bacteria secrete acyl-homoserine
  lactone (AHL) molecules to regulate quorum sensing. AHLs activate T2R38 in sinonasal
  cilia [], initiating a calcium (Ca2+) signal that activates nitric oxide synthase
  (NOS)-dependent nitric oxide (NO) production [, ]. NO production has two distinct
  effects. The first is an increase in mucociliary transport [, ] caused by activation
  of the protein kinase G (PKG) pathway [] to increase ciliary beating. NO additionally
  diffuses directly into the airway surface liquid, where it directly permeabilizes
  and kills bacteria []
