caption: 'Biosynthesis of carotenoids and Folates in plants. (A) Carotenoids biosynthesis
  and subsequent influential of phytohormones and provitamins. Footnotes: The first
  committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis is the condensation of two molecules of
  Geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) by phytoene synthase (PSY) to form phytoene (C40).
  The colorless phytoene is subsequently desaturated to give zeta-carotene and lycopene.
  Desaturation of phytoene occurs by two enzymes, phytoene desaturase (PDS) and zeta-carotene
  desaturase (ZDS), which are required to form lycopene. A major branch point occurs
  after lycopene synthesis when cyclization mediated by the enzymes lycopene-b-cyclase
  (LCYB) and lycopene-3-cyclase (LCYE) gives rise to α-carotene and β-carotene. α-carotene
  is acted upon by a β-ring hydroxylase to form zeinoxanthin, which is then hydroxylated
  by a ε-ring hydroxylase to produce lutein. β-carotene can be hydroxylated β-carotene
  hydroxylase (CRTRB) in a two-step reaction to zeaxanthin, with β-cryptoxanthin as
  an intermediate product. Zeaxanthin can be epoxidized to violaxanthin, and a set
  of light- and dark-controlled reactions, known as the xanthophyll cycle, rapidly
  optimize the concentration of violaxanthin and zeaxanthin in the cell through the
  action of zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) and violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE), respectively,
  via antheraxanthin. Violaxanthin undergoes synthesis by the enzyme neoxanthin synthase
  to form neoxanthin and as precursor of the plant hormone abscisic acid. (B) Biosynthetic
