caption: (A) MEG3 promotes β-catenin degradation through a PTEN-dependent ubiquitin–proteasome
  system. Thus, MEG3 inhibits β-catenin activity through PKM2 reduction and PTEN increase.
  (B) LincRNA-p21 is a negative regulator of PKM2. The regulatory mechanism of PKM2
  mediated by LincRNA-p21 depends on the PTEN/AKT/mTOR cascade. (C) When HULC is overexpressed,
  HULC increases autophagy by increasing the expression of LC3I and LC3II. At the
  same time, HULC enhances the interaction between LC3 and ATG3. Thus, HULC inhibits
  PTEN through enhancing the cellular autophagy by increasing ubiquitin–proteasome
  dependent LC3II. The result is activation of the AKT-PI3K-mTOR pathway to inhibit
  tumor cell growth and metabolism when PTEN is reduced, based on inhibition of PTEN
  in liver cancer cells. Strikingly, HULC reduced the expression of PTEN, β-catenin
  and increased the expression of PKM2 in hematoma cells.
