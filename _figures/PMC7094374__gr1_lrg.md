caption: 'Synthesis of triacylglycerols in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. (A) The
  Kennedy Pathway. Fatty acyl moieties from fatty-acyl-Coenzyme A (R1–3-CO-SCoA) precursors
  are esterified to the sn-1, sn-2, and sn-3 positions of glycerol-3-phosphate with
  the removal of the sn-3 phosphate group (PO2−4) The enzymes for each step are indicated
  as follows: GPAT = glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase; AGPAT = acylglycerol-3-phosphate
  acyltransferase; PAP = lipin phosphatidic acid phosphatase; DGAT = diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase. (B) Triacylglycerols (TG) form as a lens-like structure between
  the bilayer halves of the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane (1), bud out into
  the cytoplasm (arrow, 2), and are released from the membrane (3).'
