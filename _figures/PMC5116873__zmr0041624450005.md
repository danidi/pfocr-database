caption: YopJ effectors produced by plant pathogens manipulate diverse cellular processes
  through acetylation. YopJ effectors from plant pathogens target a diverse group
  of substrates in Arabidopsis to promote bacterial infection. The Pseudomonas syringae
  effector HopZ3 suppresses effector-triggered immunity by acetylating multiple components
  in the RPM1 immune complex, including RIPK. The Xanthomonas campestris effector
  AvrBsT and the Pseudomonas syringae effector HopZ1a interfere with the plant microtubule
  network by acetylating ACIP1 and tubulin, respectively. HopZ1a also acetylates JAZs
  and induces their proteasome-dependent degradation; the consequent activation of
  the jasmonate signaling pathway suppresses salicylic acid-dependent plant defenses.
  The Ralstonia solanacearum effector PopP2 acetylates the WRKY transcription factors
  and impairs their DNA-binding activity; as a result, activation of defense genes
  is suppressed.
