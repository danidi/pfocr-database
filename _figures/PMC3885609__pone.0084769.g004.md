caption: The retrosynthesis trees correspond to the pathways shown in . (a) Proposed
  route for 3-methylbutanal to 3-methylbutanoic acid. (b) Proposed oxidative decarboxylation
  route converting alpha-keto isocaproate (KICA) into 3-methylbutanoic acid. (c) Proposed
  route converting KICA into 3-methylbutanoic acid via alpha-hydroxy-isocaproate (HICA).
  A novel reaction converting HICA into 3-methylbutanoic acid by lactate 2-monooxygenase
  was proposed (step 2).
