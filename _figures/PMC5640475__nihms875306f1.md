caption: Organization of glucose metabolism into reaction blocks for 13C metabolic
  flux analysis. Measured fluxes (red) include glucose uptake and phosphorylation
  (J0), lactate production and export (J4), and mitochondrial respiration rate (JRR).
  Metabolism of [1,2-13C2]glucose yields lactate (Lac) whose enrichment with one (M1),
  two (M2), or three (M3) 13C atoms depends on fluxes through the oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP; J1), the forward non-oxidative PPP (J3f,J3af,J3bf) that
  consumes ribulose-5-phosphate (Ri5P) and produces hexose phosphates (HxP; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  F6P, fructose-6-phosphate) and triose phosphates (TrP; dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate), the reverse non-oxidative PPP (J3r,J3ar,J3br),
  glycolysis (J2a, J2b, which produce and consume TrP, respectively), mitochondrial
  pyruvate (Pyr) oxidation (J5), and oxidation of mitochondrial malate (Mal; J7) by
  malic enzyme. All fluxes can be inferred from 13C enrichment in lactate by predicting
  the relative yield of 13C-enriched products from each reaction. Accurately predicting
  M-M3 lactate is achieved by optimizing J3af/(J0+ J3af), J7/(J2b + J7). J3af/J3ar,
  and J5. Consumption of NADPH (J8), Ri5P for nucleotides (J9), and glycolytic NADH
  by mitochondria (J6) are ‘balance’ fluxes calculated from the inferred and measured
  fluxes that do not directly influence 13C enrichment in lactate.
