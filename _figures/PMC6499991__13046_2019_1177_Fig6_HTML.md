caption: 'A proposed model of participation of SNHG1 in the regulation of signaling
  pathways that contribute sorafenib resistance in HCC cells. “→” indicates positive
  regulation or activation; “⊥”, negative regulation or blockade. “+P” indicates the
  enhancement of protein phosphorylation, while “-P”, the reduction of protein phosphorylation.
  A dotted line indicates the mechanisms investigated in previous studies, while a
  solid line, the mechanisms investigated in the present study. Abbreviations: 4EBP1,
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; GSK-3β, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3β; LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; S6K, ribosomal protein
  S6 kinase; miR-21, microRNA-21; SLC3A2, solute carrier family 3 member 2; SNHG1,
  small nucleolar RNA host gene 1'
