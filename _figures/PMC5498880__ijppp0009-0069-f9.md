caption: Potential mechanisms by which 8-pCPT-cGMP improves the outcome of fatty partial
  liver transplantation. Fatty liver transplantation causes onset of mitochondrial
  permeability transition (MPT), which decreases ATP formation and causes release
  of cytochrome c, leading to necrosis and apoptosis. Mitochondrial injury and cell
  death in turn cause release of mitochondrial and other cellular damage-associated
  molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), leading to inflammation which further amplifies
  liver injury. ATP acts both as an energy source supporting liver regeneration and
  also a modulator of liver regeneration signaling. For example, mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) and its downstream p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), the pathway that regulates
  protein synthesis necessary for cell proliferation and growth, are highly sensitive
  to perturbations of nutrient/energy supply. Moreover, activation of a number of
  growth factor receptors and kinases that are involved in cell proliferation (e.g.,
  extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK], c-Jun-N-terminal kinase [JNK], etc.)
  also requires high energy molecules. Formation of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase
  (CDK) complexes is a convergent point of multiple upstream signaling to control
  cell proliferation. Therefore, ATP depletion from the MPT occurring in FPG suppresses
  liver regeneration. Previous studies show that both cGMP and cAMP analogs protect
  against the MPT in cultured hepatocytes after ischemia/reperfusion through activation
  of protein kinase A (PKA). 8-pCPT-cGMP, a cell permeable cGMP analog, activates
  PKA in hepatocytes and possibly PKG in other cell types to block MPT onset, thus
  attenuating cell death and improving liver regeneration. 8-pCPT-cGMP also enhances
  cell proliferation through activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB).
