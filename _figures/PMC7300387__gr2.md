caption: NAD+metabolism connects cellular sub-compartments. Most cellular NAD+ is
  regenerated through the salvage pathway from NAM and to a smaller extent through
  de novo biosynthesis from dietary sources such as NR (nutrient). The rate-limiting
  reaction from NAM to NMN is catalyzed by NAMPT enzyme in the nucleocytosol. Three
  different NMNAT enzymes catalyze the compartmentalized regeneration of NAD+ from
  the same pool of NMN. The NAD+/NADH pair has key redox functions in the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle and the electron transport chain to drive ATP generation.
