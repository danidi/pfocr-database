caption: 'Simplified scheme of liver architecture and Wnt/ β-catenin signalling. a:
  The human liver is composed of two lobes of unequal size. It is supplied with blood
  from two sources, the hepatic portal vein and the hepatic arteries. The blood is
  distributed into capillaries that enter the liver lobules, which are hexagonal substructures
  that form the functional units of the liver. The blood flows through the sinusoids
  of the lobules from the portal vein (PV) to the central vein (CV). Hepatocytes surround
  the sinusoids separated by space of Disse. Typically, 15 to 25 hepatocytes align
  along the porto-central axis. b: The central component of the Wnt/ β-catenin signalling
  pathway is β-catenin (purple). β-Catenin is constantly produced and degraded and
  maintains a low expression level. The degradation is predominantly mediated by a
  destruction complex comprising APC (grey), Axin and the kinase GSK. Upon stimulation
  by Wnt ligands (grey), the Wnt receptor complex activates intracellular proteins
  including Dishevelled (Dsh) that induce a partial inactivation of the destruction
  complex. In consequence, β-catenin degradation is impaired and more β-catenin can
  translocate into the nucleus. There, it binds to transcriptional regulators of the
  TCF family and co-regulates the expression of target genes. In particular, β-catenin/TCF
  complexes induce the expression of Dkk (green). Dkk is secreted by the cells and
  acts as an inhibitor of the pathway by competing with Wnt for receptor binding.
  The colours highlighting Wnt, APC, β-catenin, target genes and Dkk correspond to
  the colour code used throughout the manuscript'
