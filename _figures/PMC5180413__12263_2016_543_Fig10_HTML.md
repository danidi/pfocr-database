caption: a In tumor cells expressing ERβ (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7), γ- and δ-T3 bind to
  and activate the ERβ receptor, inducing the expression of pro-apoptotic genes such
  as MIC-1, EGR-1, and cathepsin-D, finally triggering apoptosis. More details about
  this mechanism are described in (6). Also in these cell types, a contribution by
  pro-apoptotic signals originating from EndoR is not to be excluded. b In tumor cells
  not expressing any of the canonical forms of ERs (ERα and ERβ), γ- and δ-T3 induce
  EndoR stress activating Ca2+ release in the cytoplasm. Overall, the treatment with
  specific forms of T3, but not α-TOC, is associated with specific Ca-dependent signals
  involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), the core pathway to cope with EndoR
  stress in eukaryotic cells. In particular, Ca2+ release is followed by the activation
  of IRE-1, which in turn activates XBP-1 splicing, the binding of this latter to
  DNA, and the subsequent induction of the expression of pro-apoptotic genes. The
  expression of other genes associated with EndoR stress (PERK and ATF-6) is not significantly
  affected by T3. Our data also provide ground to speculate about the presence of
  a putative (orphan) receptor, possibly located at the level of the cellular membrane
  able to bind T3 and other estrogen mimetics such as ICI-182,730. This mechanism
  could be active in several cell types, independently of the presence of functional
  ERs
