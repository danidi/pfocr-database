caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanisms impairing VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 angiogenic
  signal in SSc. Angiogenesis tightly depends on the balance of proangiogenic VEGF165
  and antiangiogenic VEGF165b isoforms. In angiogenic conditions, VEGF165 predominates,
  whereas in SSc the balance shifts to favor the expression of the VEGF165b splice
  variant in different cell types, such as ECs, platelets, fibroblasts, and mononuclear
  inflammatory cells. In ECs, binding of VEGF165 to both VEGFR-2 and NRP1 coreceptor
  activates VEGFR-2 phosphorylation and multiple downstream signaling pathways that
  are necessary for angiogenesis. Moreover, uPAR interacts with VEGFR-2 and recruits
  LRP-1 to VEGFR-2, which induces internalization of VEGF165-bound VEGFR-2, a key
  step in the proangiogenic signal. In SSc, both a switch from proangiogenic VEGF165
  to antiangiogenic VEGF165b, which is unable to bind NRP1, and concomitant NRP1 downregulation
  due to Fli1 transcription factor deficiency result in an insufficient tyrosine phosphorylation/activation
  of VEGFR-2 and incomplete or transient downstream signaling along with a differential
  intracellular trafficking of VEGFR-2 toward the degradative pathway, ultimately
  leading to impaired angiogenesis. In SSc ECs, MMP-12-mediated cleavage/inactivation
  of uPAR may further impair the VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 system. EC endothelial cell, Fli1
