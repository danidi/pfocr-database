caption: Fatty acid mobilization and utilization in skeletal muscle during endurance
  exercise. (a) Epinephrine (as well as norepinephrine) and glucagon stimulate FA
  release from TG stored in adipocyte lipid droplets, with insulin countering their
  actions. Epinephrine and glucagon bind their specific receptor in the adipocyte
  membrane, thus stimulating adenylyl cyclase to produce cyclic AMP (cAMP). cAMP activates
  the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which phosphorylates both HSL and perilipin
  present on the surface of the lipid droplet. The phosphorylation of perilipin increases
  ATGL activity, thereby providing more diacylglycerol (DAG) substrates to hormone-sensitive
  lipase (HSL). Hormone-sensitive lipase then hydrolyzes DAG to a free fatty acid
  (FFA) and MAG, which is further hydrolyzed by a monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL). FFAs
  are transported to the plasma membrane bound to adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein
  (aFABP), leave the adipocyte, and bind serum albumin in the blood. (b) Exercise
  induces lipoprotein lipase (LPL) on the surface of endothelial cells of skeletal
  muscle. The increased LPL activity increases TG hydrolysis from TG-rich lipoproteins
  (such as chylomicrons (CM) and very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL)), thus releasing
  FFA, glycerol, free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipids (PL). The esterified cholesterol
  is packaged into the core of HDL particles, increasing plasma HDL-C levels. (c)
  FFA derived from lipoproteins and adipocyte lipolysis are released from the albumin
  and enter myocytes via specific fatty acid transporters, such as fatty acid translocase
  (FAT/CD36), plasma membrane-associated fatty acid binding proteins (FABPpm) and
  fatty acid transport proteins (FATP). Long-chain FAs bind directly to FATP closely
  associated with sarcolemmal acyl-Coenzyme A synthethase (ACS). Alternatively, FAs
  may first bind to FAT/CD36 and then be delivered either to FATP or to cytosolic
  fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) and activated into acyl-Coenzyme A (acyl-CoA)
  by intracellular ACS. Acyl-CoA esters enter the mitochondrion via carnitine palmitoyl
  transferase 1 (CPT1) and are cleaved in the β-oxidation pathway. The acetyl-Coenzyme
  A molecules produced are oxidized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), and
  the energy of oxidation is conserved in ATP, which fuels muscle contraction and
  other energy requiring metabolism in the myocyte. FA released from intramyocellular
  triacylglycerol store (IMTG) through local HSL activity also contribute to lipid
  utilization in the myofibers during this exercise type.
