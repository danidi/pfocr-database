caption: The Nrf2-Keap1-HO-1 pathway. The transcription factor, Nrf2, is sequestered
  in the cytoplasm by the cysteine- (Cis-) rich Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
  1 (Keap1). The binding of Nrf2 with Keap1 is also the basis for its degradation
  through the ubiquitin- (Ub-) based proteosomal pathway. Under OS or induction by
  ROS and drugs, the Keap1 response through Cis could lead to the release and stabilization
  of Nrf2 []. The phosphorylation of Nrf2 also leads to its release and translocation
  into the nucleus. Nrf2 as a conjugate with the Maf proteins binds to the antioxidant
  response element (ARE) to induce the transcription of target genes including HO-1.
  The degradation of heme to an antioxidant bilirubin via the biliverdin intermediate
  is also shown. Other products of the system induce carbon monoxide (CO) and Fe2+
  which further induce ferritin production.
