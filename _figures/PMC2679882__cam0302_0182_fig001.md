caption: Model for SLK activation and recruitment at the leading edge. A proportion
  of SLK is microtubule-associated, likely through a microtubule-binding protein (X).
  Following activation of the FAK/c-Src complex, signaling through the MAPK pathway
  can activate and recruit the microtubule-SLK complex, inducing adhesion turnover
  by destabilization of the actin network or focal contacts/adhesions through an unknown
  mechanism. (C) denotes a cargo protein coupling the microtubule to polymerized actin.
  Nocodazole treatment fails to recruit SLK resulting in stable adhesions.
