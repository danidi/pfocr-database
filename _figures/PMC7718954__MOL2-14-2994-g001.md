caption: Overview of necroptosis, apoptosis, and pyroptosis signaling pathways. Binding
  of death ligands such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to their cognate receptor (TNFR)
  leads to pleiotropic signaling including inflammation and cell survival, apoptosis,
  and necroptosis, determined by the key signaling molecule, the receptor‐interacting
  serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). Upon inhibition of caspase‐8, RIPK1 activates
  RIPK3 leading to the formation of the necrosome. The necrosome then phosphorylates
  and activates mixed‐lineage kinase‐like (MLKL) that causes rapid membrane permeabilization
  and necroptosis. Activation of caspase‐8 leads to activation of caspase‐3 and caspase‐7
  and cell death (extrinsic apoptosis). The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is initiated
  by perturbation in the internal environment including DNA damage that causes mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). MOMP is regulated by the interaction between
  pro‐apoptotic and anti‐apoptotic B‐cell lymphoma 2 (BCL‐2) family proteins. The
  pro‐apoptotic proteins BCL‐2 associated X (BAX) and BCL‐2 homologous antagonist
  killer (BAK) form pores at the mitochondrial outer membrane leading to the subsequent
  release of cytochrome c and the formation of the APAF‐1 apoptosome. The apoptosome
  activates caspase‐9, which subsequently activates caspase‐3 and caspase‐7 resulting
  in apoptosis. Caspase‐8 mediates the crosstalk between the intrinsic and extrinsic
  apoptosis pathways by cleaving the pro‐apoptotic BH3‐interacting domain death (BID)
  to truncated BID (tBID) that activates BAX and BAK. Damage‐associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs) released from dying cells activate pattern recognition receptors
  such as Toll‐like receptors (TLR). This leads to the activation of canonical inflammasomes
  that activate caspase‐1. Active caspase‐1 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) liberating
  an N‐terminal (GSDMDNT) pore‐forming fragment from the C‐terminal (GSDMDC) inhibitory
  fragment. GSDMDNT form pores leading to membrane permeabilization and pyroptosis.
  Active caspase‐1 also cleaves the pro‐inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL‐1β)
  and IL‐18 into their mature form that are released by GSDMD pores.

  description: Overview of necroptosis, apoptosis, and pyroptosis signaling pathways.
    Binding of death ligands such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to their cognate
    receptor (TNFR) leads to pleiotropic signaling including inflammation and cell
    survival, apoptosis, and necroptosis, determined by the key signaling molecule,
    the receptor‐interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). Upon inhibition

    The necrosome then phosphorylates and activates mixed‐lineage kinase‐like (MLKL)
    that causes rapid membrane permeabilization and necroptosis. Activation of caspase‐8
    leads to activation of caspase‐3 and caspase‐7 and cell death (extrinsic apoptosis).
    The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is initiated by perturbation in the internal environment
    including DNA damage that causes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
    (MOMP). MOMP is regulated by the interaction between pro‐apoptotic and anti‐apoptotic
    B‐cell lymphoma 2 (BCL‐2) family proteins. The pro‐apoptotic proteins BCL‐2 associated

    Active caspase‐1 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) liberating an N‐terminal (GSDMDNT)
