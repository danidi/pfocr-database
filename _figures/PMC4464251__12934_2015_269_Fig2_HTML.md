caption: Theoretical net ATP yields from various pathways of succinate synthesis.
  Theoretical net ATP yield (mol ATP gained per mol of succinate produced) is estimated
  in all pathways when two moles of succinate are generated from one mole of glucose.
  (a) Pathway A, in which succinate is synthesized via glucose-PTS and PYC-dependent
  carboxylation reactions, (b) pathway B, which uses glucose-PTS and PYC+PCK co-dependent
  carboxylation reactions, (c) pathway C, which uses non-PTS and PCK-dependent carboxylation
  reactions.
