caption: A Schematic model of the biological function of tumor-induced MDSCs during
  the tumor invasion-metastasis cascade in NPC. COX-2 is highly expressed in NPC cells,
  which promote the expansion of MDSCs with a suppressive function on T cells through
  inducing the cytokine secretion including IL-6 and GM-CSF, whereas the MDSCs home
  to tumor tissues and promote the EMT of tumor cells via cell-to-cell contact to
  produce TGFβ and NO through upregulation of the expression of COX-2 and activation
  of the β-catenin/TCF4 pathway in NPC cells.
