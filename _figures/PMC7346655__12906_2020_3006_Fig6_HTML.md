caption: Cartoon diagram of the mechanisms for growth suppression of NKTCL cells by
  matrine. Matrine inhibits the transcription of c-Myc through the downregulated LMP1
  protein. Matrine downregulates c-Myc phosphorylation at Ser62 through CaMKIIγ inhibition,
  and then promotes the destabilization and degradation of c-Myc protein in a proteasome-dependent
  manner

  modulating CaMKIIγ-c-Myc signaling pathway.
