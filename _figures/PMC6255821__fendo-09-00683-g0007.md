caption: The dissected regulatory network of PRL signaling in the slc12a10.2- and
  slc12a3-deficient fish, respectively. (A,B) The generations of the model with increased
  endogenous PRL in zebrafish. Either depletion of slc12a10.2 or slc12a3 could result
  in increased endogenous PRL effectively. (A) Although pituitary prl is upregulated
  in the slc12a10.2-deficient fish, the responses of PRL downstream targets in pronephric
  duct to upregulated prl is not observed, as this pathway could only be conditionally
  activated under the hypo-Na+ stress. The Na+ absorption maintenance by upregulated
  atp1a1a.5 in the gills/skin of the slc12a10.2-deficient larvae is evidently observed,
  which probably compensate to maintain the systemic Na+ concentration. However, the
  PRL downstream targets in the pronephric duct failed to respond to the increased
  pituitary PRL. (B) The overall responses of Na+ and Cl− absorption both in the gills/skin
  and reabsorption in the pronephric duct compensate to maintain normal levels of
  Na+ and Cl− in the slc12a3-deficient fish. The upregulated expressions of the nominated
  genes are highlighted in red.
