caption: A. Chemokines likely regulate immune cell trafficking in the inflammatory
  bowel diseases. Increased expression and production of chemokines by epithelial
  cells in the damaged or intact mucosal barrier direct the elevated trafficking of
  leukocytes and lymphocytes of the innate and adaptive immune response to the gastrointestinal
  mucosa. B. Potential roles for chemokines in repair of the epithelial barrier. The
  homeostatic chemokine CXCL12 is constitutively expressed in the cells of the human
  intestinal epithelium. In culture model systems CXCL12 activates the canonical restitutive
  epithelial migration signaling pathway and aids in increased closure of wounded
  epithelial monolayers. C. Chemokines differentially participate in the progression
  from dysplastic epithelium to frank tumor and metastasis. Epigenetic silencing of
  CXCL12 in the colonic carcinoma cells confers metastasis-proficient phenotype to
  those cells, allowing them to respond to endocrine chemokine gradients (green circles).
