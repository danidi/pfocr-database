caption: Feedback loop on BMP4 pathway mediated by miR-125a/b and miR-23a-24-27a during
  both the exit of mESCs from naïve state and their neuroectodermal differentiation.
  Briefly, miR-125a and miR-125b control the exit from the naïve state by targeting
  the BMP4 co-receptor Dies1, causing BMP4 pathway downregulation. In parallel, the
  mir-23a-24-27a cluster blocks the apoptotic response of mESCs to BMP4 signaling
  by targeting Smad5 and allowing the proper differentiation of the neuroectodermal
  precursors.
