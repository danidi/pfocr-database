caption: A simplified scheme of MAMP-responsive signaling cascades and phytoalexin
  biosynthesis pathways. (A) Signaling cascades regulate phytoalexin biosynthesis.
  Solid arrows indicate direct regulation and dashed lines indicate signal flow. (B)
  Diterpenoids and Trp-derived metabolites synthesis pathway. Key compounds in these
  metabolic pathways have a blue background. Genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes are
  in italic face. Characteristic pathways are shaded in red (rice) or in purple (Arabidopsis).
  Enzymes whose genes were shown to be upregulated by OsMPK3/OsMPK6 (red) or AtMPK3/AtMPK6
  (purple) are indicated.
