caption: RRM2B induced by hypoxia drives continued DNA replication. Severe levels
  of hypoxia lead to replication stress, which through the activation of the DNA damage
  response pathway, leads to accumulation of RRM2B. Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)
  favors the RRM2B subunit in hypoxia, because it retains activity in these conditions
  providing the cell with a basal level of deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs). As a result,
  replication fork integrity is preserved, DNA replication continues albeit at a compromised
  rate and the cell avoids apoptosis and eventually loss of viability. The fact that
  RRM2B is unable to provide the appropriate amount of dNTPs for replication to continue
  at the same rates as in normoxia, results in the hypoxic-specific replication stress
  observed in cells that survive in these conditions. NDPs (ribonucleotide diphosphates),
  dNDPs (deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates), RPA (replication protein A), ssDNA (single-stranded
  DNA).
