caption: Camouflage response pathway and regulation of crf expression by altering
  light exposure and ethanol. A, Schematic showing the involvement of CRF-POMC pathway
  in promoting melanosome dispersal in melanocytes by raising the cAMP levels through
  action of α-MSH. Light-induced aggregation involves the action of NA and MCH. Ethanol
  targets the CRF-POMC pathway to promote melanosome dispersal. B, Both dark and ethanol
  require the cAMP and ERK pathways to induce crf expression.
