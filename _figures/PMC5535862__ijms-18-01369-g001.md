caption: 'Schematic model proposing a differentiated cell as the cell of origin of
  skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Cancer growth of Grhl3-deficient cells is dependent
  on the miR-21/GRHL3/PTEN/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway in skin SCC. Middle and right
  panels: GRHL3 (highlighted by a red circle is a key tumour suppressor preventing
  the onset of skin SCC arising from differentiated epithelial cells. Normally GRHL3
  (highlighted in red circle) stands at the apex of a tumour suppressor pathway encompassing
  PTEN. When miR-21 is upregulated in response to ultraviolet radiation, HPV infection
  or inflammatory responses, it inhibits expression of GRHL3 and PTEN, both directly
  and indirectly. Normally PTEN itself inhibits AKT activation driven by the PI3K
  pathway. Loss of PTEN leads to dysregulated activation of AKT and mTOR complex to
  activate S6 kinase, which stimulates ribosome biogenesis to facilitate the increased
  metabolic needs of cancer cells. The RAS oncogene is presumed to activate both AKT
  and MAPK pathways, leading to direct and indirect (via mTOR) increase in ribosome
  biogenesis; Left Panel: Loss of GRHL3 is thought to lead to a cancer-initiating
  cell (CIC) with self-renewing potential as indicated by the curved arrows. Further
  oncogenic “hits” induces a cancer stem cell (CSC) with self-renewing potential,
  which is ultimately the source cell for SCC.'
