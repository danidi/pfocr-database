caption: Schematic of Nodal and Shh Signaling. (a) Simplified schematic of Nodal signaling.
  Nodal binds a receptor complex that includes ActRII, Alk4, and Cripto, leading to
  Smad2/3 phosphorylation. P-Smad2/3 binds Smad4 and, with FoxH1, activates pathway
  target genes. (b) Simplified schematic of Shh signaling. In the absence of Shh (far
  right cell), Ptch1 inhibits Smo activity, leading to proteolysis of Gli2 and Gli3
  (Gli2/3) to transcriptional repressor forms (GliR), which inhibit pathway target
  gene expression. Shh is produced as a precursor product (Shh(pre); far left cell).
  Upon autoproteolysis, cholesterol adduction, and palmitoylation by Skn, mature Shh
  ligand is produced. Shh is released from producing cells in a Disp1-dependent manner.
  Upon binding of Shh to a complex of Ptch1 and at least one coreceptor (Cdon, Boc,
  or Gas1) (center cell), Smo inhibition by Ptch1 is relieved. Smo signals to block
  Gli2/3 proteolysis, allowing formation of transcriptional activator forms (GliA),
  which induce pathway target gene expression. Factors indicated in color have been
  identified as targets of mutation in HPE.
