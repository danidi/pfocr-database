caption: 'Simplified metabolism of Lupinus albus nodules and cluster roots under P
  and N deficiencies. In summary, sucrose is transported from the shoot via the phloem,
  and glycolysis is activated in both the symbiotic cells and the cluster root cells
  to increase the amount of malate and OAA, which are integrated into the TCA cycles
  running in both mitochondria and symbiosomes. In cluster root cells, malate is also
  secreted to the soil through a specific transporter and may be transported via xylem
  to fuel the symbiotic cell and to the aerial organs. In nodules, there is an upregulation
  of MDH, while in cluster roots PEPC is the principal upregulated glycolysis enzyme.
  In cluster roots, formate is produced by an upregulation of FORM, which leads to
  activation of the THF pathway, which produces ethylene. Formate is also used to
  synthesize malate by MS. Phospholipid degradation occurs to provide Pi and Ac-CoA,
  which in turn combines with OAA to yield citrate catalyzed by CS, or with glyoxylate
  to form malate by MS. Malate and citrate keep a balance mediated by the TCA cycles
  and several enzymes, inducing ACL, MDH, MS, and CS. Citrate is mainly produced in
  the mitochondrion and secreted to the soil through permeable channels. This process
  is associated with a membrane H+ ATPase, and protons are also released, leading
  to soil acidification. Additionally, APases are secreted to the soil. The combined
  action of carboxylates, the acidification of the medium, and the secreted APases
  is capable of mobilizing unavailable P in the soil and generate Pi, which is co-transported
  with protons into the root cell. Pi can reach the symbiotic cell by absorption through
  the nodule surface or, mainly, be transported via xylem. Pi is needed in the first
  place for the synthesis of nitrogenase RNA, which has a very high turnover. Carboxylates
  also chelate cations that bind to P, mainly Fe3+, which is reduced to Fe2+ by a
  plasma membrane Fe(III)R and enters the cell via a Fe2+ transporter. Other micronutrients
  are also mobilized and enter the root cell together with Fe2+. The nutrients are
  transported to the symbiotic cell and the rest of the plant via xylem. In the nodule,
  O2 permeates the cortex to bind leghemoglobin, controlling the right levels for
  nitrogenase functioning in the symbiosome, which produces NH3 that exits the symbiosome
  and is protonated in the symbiotic cell and then converted to Asn and Gln in a process
  catalized by several enzymes GS, GOGAT, AAT, and AS. Asn and Gln are transported
  to the plant, including the cluster root cells, where, among other functions, they
  are converted to Asp that enters the mitochondrion to fuel the TCA cycle through
  OAA, and to Glu that is converted to 2-OG and also enters the TCA cycle. Lupin cluster
  roots are also capable of secreting proteases that degrade organic N to amino acids
  and small di- and tri-peptides that enter the root cell through membrane transporters.
