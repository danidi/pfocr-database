caption: SMARCA4 may be necessary for the expression of a key component of the centrosome-dependent
  pathway for mitotic spindle formation and repress the centrosome-independent pathway
  of spindle formation. When SMARCA4 is lost, lung cancer cells upregulate HURP and
  become sensitive to its depletion. As HURP is a unique component of the centrosome-independent
  pathway normally dispensible for somatic cells, we speculate that hypersensitivity
  to Aurora kinase inhibitors is linked to a switch in the mechanisms for mitotic
  spindle formation.
