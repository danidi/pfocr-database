caption: 'Influence of SDM on the proton transfer mechanism during H2-uptake in CpI.
  Effects of SDM on the proposed proton transfer mechanism for selected CpI variants:
  C299A (a), E279A (b), E282A (c), and E282Q (d). H2-binding induces a shift in the
  H-bond pattern (from mode 1 to mode 2) and initiates the catalytic mechanism during
  which the H-bond pattern repeatedly shifts between modes 1 (blue) and 2 (green)
  while promoting a stepwise proton release via the PT pathway (for details see Supplementary
  Fig. ). The pKa values of adt-ligand at different redox states are derived from
  previous studies,. The mutated residues and hydrogen atoms from substrate were highlighted
  as red. The green double arrow indicates a putative salt bridge contact. In c (E282A),
  the pink shading area indicates a slowed-down but still functioning proton transfer.
  Protons presented in blue close to the [4Fe]H sub-cluster originate from the recently
  described regulatory PT pathway,,, which is independent of substrate/product transfer'
