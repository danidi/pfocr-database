caption: circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network uncovers the circRNA_021412-miR-1972-LPIN1
  signaling underlying circRNAs' effects. (a) The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network related
  to transcriptional regulation. Red cycles, violet squares, and blue cycles represent
  circRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs, respectively. The size of each symbol reflects its
  degree, which is scored by the number of downstream targets. (b) circRNA_021412-miR-1972-LPIN1
  signaling within the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network is recognized to underlie the actions
  of circRNAs. (c) The circRNA_021412-miR-1972-LPIN1 signaling controls the pathway
  of lipid degradation via PPARα-induced ACSLs expression.
