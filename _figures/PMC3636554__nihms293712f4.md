caption: Panel A. There are several likely mechanism(s) by which components of cigarette
  smoke induce C. pneumoniae persistence []. ATPe released from smoke-exposed cells
  could induce chlamydial persistence by activating purinergic receptor-linked signaling
  pathways []. Nitrogen radicals present in cigarette smoke could also react with
  intracellular tryptophan [], inducing persistence via tryptophan depravation [].
  As nitrogen radicals also activate intracellular sphingomyelinase (SMase) activity
  [; ], subsequent reduction in intracellular sphingomyelin would be predicted to
  restrict recovery from persistence [] and/or productive chlamydial development.
  Finally, because smoke components are concentrated in host lipid droplets [], these
  compounds may directly alter chlamydial development when lipid droplets are brought
  within close proximity to the developing inclusion []. Panel B. Herpes Simplex Virus
  (HSV) co-infection [] andHSV glycoprotein D (gD)/host nectin-1 interaction [; ]
  activate a currently unidentified host cellular signaling pathway that induces chlamydial
  persistence. Since nectin-1 also interacts with other host ligands on adjacent epithelial
  cells, remodeling of nectin-1 containing adherens junctions may also regulate chlamydial
  development in the absence of HSV infection. Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV)
  co-infection also induces persistence [] and may do so directly by interacting with
  a host cell receptor (aminopeptidase N), in a manner analogous to that stimulated
  by HSVgD/nectin-1 interaction. Alternatively, PEDV infection may activate IDO expression
  and tryptophan limitation through an IFN-γ- or -α-dependent mechanism. Red lines
  represent those pathways that restrict chlamydial development; green lines those
  that promote chlamydial productive replication; arrowheads represent activation
  events and “T”s indicate inhibition.
