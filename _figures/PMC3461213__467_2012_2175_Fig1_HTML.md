caption: 'Regulatory mechanisms of phosphate homeostasis. A–H Intestine–bone–kidney–parathyroid
  axis. In the intestine, phosphate is actively absorbed through the cells or passively
  through the paracellular pathway. Its serum concentration is tightly regulated by
  parathyroid hormone (PTH), bone, and kidney. PTH stimulates phosphate excretion
  and calcitriol synthesis in the kidney; in turn, low phosphate and calcitriol directly
  inhibit PTH production. In the bone, PTH may stimulate fibroblast growth factor-23
  (FGF-23) production and increase phosphate release following an increase in bone
  resorption. In the kidney, FGF-23 suppresses phosphate reabsorption and the synthesis
  of 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D3], and in the parathyroid glands FGF23
  suppresses the production and secretion of PTH. FGF23 is negatively regulated by
  bone signaling mechanisms (DMP1 and PHEX) and is positively regulated by systemic
  factors [serum inorganic phosphate (Pi), 1,25(OH)2D3, PTH (?)]. (Diagram is modified
