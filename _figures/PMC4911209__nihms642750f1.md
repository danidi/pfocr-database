caption: Complete vs. partial EMT/EndoMT. Epithelial and endothelial cells comprise
  the quiescent epithelium and endothelium respectively and utilize junctional proteins
  to maintain connections. Once transcriptional reprogramming is initiated, an event
  led by the EMT/EndoMT-transcription factors Slug, Snail, Twist and Zeb1/2, the epithelial/endothelial
  cells lose apical-basal polarity, sever intercellular junctions and become motile
  cells. However, the regulatory signal(s) that determine whether these cells undergo
  a complete EMT/EndoMT or partial EMT/EndoMT remains unclear. In the case of sprouting
  angiogenesis, the contact-dependent Notch signaling pathway may have a major role
  to play in this process.
