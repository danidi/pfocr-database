caption: DEPTOR [Dishevelled, Egl-10, and Pleckstrin (DEP) domain-containing mTOR-interacting
  protein] in metabolism. In adipose tissue, overexpression of DEPTOR promotes adipogenesis
  by partially reducing mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity.
  Mechanistically, this relieves the negative feedback loop toward growth factors
  signaling and increases the pro-adipogenic functions of protein kinase B (AKT).
  As such, DEPTOR ensures an optimal balance between AKT and mTORC1 signaling in adipocytes.
  This balance is critical for the activation of the master regulator of adipogenesis,
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ). In skeletal muscle, Baf60c
  [also known as SMARCD3 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator
  of chromatin, subfamily D, member 3)] stimulates a metabolic switch from oxidation
  to glycolysis by promoting DEPTOR expression and AKT activation. Forcing this pathway
  improves insulin sensitivity and promotes glucose uptake and glycolysis. In the
  liver, DEPTOR is key for an appropriate feeding-to-fasting transition. Fasting increases
  DEPTOR expression in order to potentiate the inhibition of mTORC1 during a state
  of low energy. This prevents the activation of oxidative metabolism. The deletion
  of DEPTOR in hepatocytes reduces blood glucose and increases liver oxidative metabolism
  by preventing an optimal inhibition of mTORC1 during fasting. In the mediobasal
  hypothalamus, overexpression of DEPTOR reduces the ability of mTORC1 to reduce insulin
  signaling, resulting in higher insulin sensitivity, through an AKT-FoxO1 (Forkhead
  box protein O1)-dependent mechanism. As such, hypothalamic DEPTOR regulates energy
  balance, and forcing its expression prevents the development of obesity. Although
  the identity of the neurons mediating the effects of DEPTOR on metabolism is still
  unknown, overexpressing DEPTOR in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons affects liver
  lipid and glucose metabolism. TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
