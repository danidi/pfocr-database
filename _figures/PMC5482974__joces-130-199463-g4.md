caption: 'The PACS-2 Akt site and NLS together modulate membrane traffic, TRAIL-induced
  apoptosis, MAM integrity and the response to DNA damage. (A) Protein trafficking.
  Akt-phosphorylated pSer437-PACS-2 (pPACS-2) interacts with ADAM17 on early endosomes
  (EE) and mediates delivery of the protease to the cell surface where it sheds EGF
  ligands to stimulate EGFR signaling. In the absence of PACS-2, ADAM17 is degraded
  in lysosomes (Lys.). (B) TRAIL-induced MOMP. TRAIL triggers dephosphorylation of
  PACS-2 Ser437, which mediates two trafficking steps required for MOMP. In one trafficking
  step, PACS-2 binds full-length Bid and translocates Bid to mitochondria. In the
  other trafficking step, PACS-2 forms a complex with Bim and Bax on lysosomes called
  the PIXosome, which is required for lysosome membrane permeabilization to release
  cathepsin B (cath. B). (C) MAMS. Top panel: insulin or growth factors trigger activation
  of mTORC2 on mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs; green shading at the ER–mitochondria
  contact site), which activates Akt to phosphorylate PACS-2. In turn, pPACS-2 increases
  MAM contacts, which may modulate ER–mitochondria exchange and support increased
  lipogenesis. The ? denotes signaling pathways that may lead to Akt-dependent phosphorylation
  of PACS-2 independent of MAM-localized TORC2. Bottom panel: in starved cells or
  cells treated with TRAIL, Akt is inhibited and PACS-2 Ser437 is dephosphorylated
  by a protein phosphatase (PPase). Dephosphorylated PACS-2 in turn remodels MAMs
  (red shading at the ER–mitochondria contact site), which may reduce lipogenesis
  but increase ER–mitochondrial Ca2+ exchange as well as induction of autophagy. (D)
  DNA damage response. Top panel: to support induction of the NF-κB and Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic
  pathway, cytoplasmic PACS-2 interacts with a pool of ATM released from the nucleus
  and maintains the DNA damage kinase in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic ATM then triggers
  activation of the canonical IκBα–NF-κB pathway that leads to induction of anti-apoptotic
  Bcl-xL. Bottom panel: to support induction of the p53–p21 cell cycle arrest pathway,
  pPACS-2 traffics to the nucleus where it binds and inhibits SIRT1 to protect acetylation
  of p53 bound to the p21 promoter, promoting p21 induction and cell cycle arrest.
  Green arrows, pro-survival-anabolic pathways mediated by pPACS-2. Red arrows, apoptotic
  or catabolic pathways mediated by dephosphorylated PACS-2. Ac, acetylation; DDR,
  DNA-damage response.'
