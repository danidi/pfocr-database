caption: The proposed working model. IBV infection activates MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling,
  which protects cells from death by reducing the level of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2, thereby
  supporting efficient IBV replication. The activation of ERK1/2 pathway induces the
  phosphatase DUSP6 expression. DUSP6 forms a negative regulation loop by dephosphorylating
  ERK1/2, to restrict this prosurvival signal. The upregulation of DUSP6 promotes
  cell death and impairs IBV replication, representing one of the host antiviral responses.
  U0126 inhibits the activation of ERK1/2 and promotes cell death, thereby suppressing
  IBV replication, while BCI inhibits DUSP6 and promotes ERK1/2 signaling/cell survival,
  thereby promoting IBV replication.
