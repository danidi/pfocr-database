caption: 'The map of central carbon metabolic pathways under the free-living and/or
  symbiotic conditions. The map of central carbon metabolic pathways involving gluconeogenesis
  and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway,
  the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and the TCA cycle are shown. Symbols represent
  the following: fully-filled box (■), enzymes that were commonly identified under
  each condition; boxes filled in the bottom-right corner (◪), enzymes identified
  only under the free-living condition; boxes filled in the upper-left corner (◩),
  enzymes that were identified only under the symbiotic condition; open box (□), enzymes
  not identified in this study but proposed in M. loti by KEGG pathway analysis. Abbreviations
  are as follows: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; KDPG, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate; ACP, acyl carrier
  protein; PHB, polyhydroxybutyrate.'
