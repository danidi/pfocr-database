caption: Folate, one-carbon metabolism, methionine cycle and polyamine biosynthesis
  overview. Dietary folate (left) is necessary for de novo synthesis of deoxythymidine
  monophosphate (dTMP) and adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which are necessary for DNA
  synthesis and intracellular methylation reactions, respectively. AdoMet is also
  used for polyamine (spermidine and spermine) biosynthesis (top). dTMP can also be
  scavenged by DNA degradation as thymidine, while AdoMet can be synthesized independently
  of folate by recycling methylthioadenosine (MTA) into methionine through the methionine
  salvage pathway.
