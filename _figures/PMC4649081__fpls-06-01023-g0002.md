caption: Molecular components of nitrate signaling networks and their involvement
  in root development. There is a transport-mediated “reflux” of auxin from the lateral
  root cap through the epidermis to the basal meristem and then back toward the root
  tip (). (A) Nitrate is reduced to nitrite by root nitrate reductase (NR). NO biosynthesis,
  mediated by NIA/NR- and AtNOA1 (Nitric Oxide-Associated1), is active and responsible
  for most of the NO production in Arabidopsis (). NO inhibits IAA oxidase, so reducing
  auxin degradation (). However, increased NO levels have an interfering effect on
  acropetal auxin transport through PIN1 auxin efflux carrier, which shows a good
  correlation with a reduction in auxin response (; ). NO also has a positive effect
  on auxin signaling by S-nitrosylation of the auxin receptor F-box protein TIR1 ().

  pathway and are related to NO sensing, regulating the expression of ABI5 (). (B)
  Under low nitrate conditions, because of reduced NO levels, the auxin that is generated
  in the root n contributes to keep the gradients and maxima that are required to
  enhance root development (; ; ). GLR1.1 is a molecular player and could regulate
  ABA biosynthesis and signaling to control root growth. Arrows and bars mean positive
  and negative effects, respectively.
