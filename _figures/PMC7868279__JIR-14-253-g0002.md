caption: Cyclooxygenase pathway showing the formation of PGE2 and other metabolites.
  Inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2 non-selectively by NSAIDs (green triangles) and
  selective inhibition of COX-2 by COXIBs (red triangles) is also shown. The potential
  targets in the COX pathway at various levels – Synthesis (1), Catabolism (2) and
  Signaling (3) are also indicated.
