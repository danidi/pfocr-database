caption: 'Role of COX in human disease. In our proposed model the activities of COX
  and Cytc are regulated by cell signaling pathways under healthy conditions. Both
  proteins are phosphorylated in vivo leading to controlled respiration. This generates
  healthy mitochondrial membrane potentials (Δψm), allowing efficient energy production
  but preventing the production of ROS, which are only generated at pathologically
  high Δψm levels. During pathological conditions the phosphorylation patterns change,
  leading to an imbalance of ROS and ATP production. A) Ischemic stroke and myocardial
  infarction are common human pathologies and the only current treatment is rapid
  resumption of blood flow, i.e., reperfusion. Reperfusion causes the major part of
  ischemia/reperfusion-related injury through the following sequence of events. During
  episodes of ischemia nutrients and oxygen become depleted causing excessive calcium
  release and alterations of PKC signaling. This results in changes of phosphorylation
  and/or dephosphorylation of COX and/or Cytc (Cytc is not shown). In the ischemic
  phase COX does not turn over due to lack of substrates. In the reperfusion phase,
  oxygen and nutrients are reintroduced leading to a rapid reestablishment of Δψm.
  Because COX is still in a hyperactive state, Δψm increases further, leading to a
  Δψm hyperpolarization and the production of excessive ROS. ROS in turn serve as
  a signal for triggering apoptosis leading to cell death. B) Many cancers are characterized
  by hyperactive receptor tyrosine kinase signaling including EGFR signaling. Here,
  activation of the pathway leads to an internalization of the receptor and translocation
  to the mitochondria where EGFR directly interacts with and phosphorylates COX subunit
  II, leading to a partial inhibition of COX activity. This step allows shifting of
  aerobic energy metabolism to Warburg metabolism: increased glycolytic and pentose
  phosphate pathway activity now provide essential building blocks for the cell, enabling
  rapid proliferation. C) Acute inflammation as in sepsis leads to the release of
  cytokines including TNFα resulting in phosphorylation of Tyr304 on catalytic subunit
  I. COX is strongly inhibited leading to decreased Δψm levels, and eventually depletion
  of ATP. In septic patients this model would explain organ failure and death through
  energetic failure.'
