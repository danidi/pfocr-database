caption: CDDP induces DNA damage by forming DNA cross-links, thereby inducing the
  activation of ATM/ATR. The latter are able to activate p53 by phosphorylation and
  the formation of a p53 tetramer, which acts as a transcription factor for among
  others MDM2 (negative regulation), BAX and PUMA (apoptosis) and p21 (cell cycle
  arrest). The inhibition of MDM2 by Nutlin-3 results in a high increase in p53 levels
  in response to CDDP treatment resulting in a synergistic cytotoxic effect.
