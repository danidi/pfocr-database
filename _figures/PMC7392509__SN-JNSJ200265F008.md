caption: NPY/NPF-related FLP-34 neuropeptides and serotonin act in the same genetic
  pathway to regulate diacetyl learning. A, Both npr-11 and tph-1 mutants display
  learning defects compared with WT animals, the defect of tph-1 being more severe.
  An npr-11;tph-1 double mutant does not display an additive learning defect compared
  with the single mutants, suggesting that npr-11 and serotonin signaling act in the
  same pathway to mediate diacetyl learning. Two-way ANOVA revealed a significant
  effect of genotypes (F(3,47) = 5.888, p = 0.0017), of behavioral treatments (F(1,47)
  = 140.2, p < 0.0001), and of interaction between genotypes and behavioral treatments
  (F(3,47) = 8.950, p < 0.0001). Data were analyzed by Sidak's and Tukey's post hoc
  test (n ≥ 5). Boxplots represent 25th (lower boundary) and 75th (upper boundary)
  percentiles. The 50th percentile (line) indicates the median. Whiskers represent
  the minimum and maximum values. Black dots represent individual CIs. *p < 0.5, **p
  < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001. ns, not significant. B, Model for NPR-11-mediated
  diacetyl learning based on data from this paper (black) and previously reported
  findings (gray; see Discussion). Diacetyl is sensed by the ODR-10 receptor in AWA
  sensory neurons (). AWA activation is transmitted via electrical synapses to the
  AIA interneurons that express NPR-11 (). The absence of food leads to a food-deprived
  state that is perceived by a three-neuron-type circuit consisting of dopaminergic
  (dop), RIC, and SIA neurons (). The absence of food leads to dopamine signaling
  inhibition and, in turn, to CREB-regulated gene expression in SIA neurons (). By
  unknown mechanisms, food deprivation may trigger the release of serotonin and FLP-34
  neuropeptides from one or more serotonergic neurons. The NPY/NPF-like FLP-34 neuropeptides
  signal to AIA by activating NPR-11 in these neurons, which are required for diacetyl
  learning. Serotonin (5HT) may activate the MOD-1 serotonin-gated chloride channel
  (). Red shading represents the part of the circuit activated by diacetyl perception.
  Blue shading represents the part activated by food deprivation. The two circuits
  converge on AIA, where diacetyl aversive memory is probably formed.
