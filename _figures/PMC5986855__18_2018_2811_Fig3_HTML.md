caption: 'Downregulation of VRK1 by DRAM1 in the autophagic pathway induced by p53
  and deactivation of p53 by phosphatases and ubiquitin ligases the proteasome in
  DNA damage response. Solid black lines represent the activation route. Dashed lines
  represent the downregulatory routes and each color represents a different route.
  Kinases: VRK1 and ATM. Phosphatases: WIP1 (wild-type P53-induced phosphatase 1)
  and DUSP4 (dual specificity phosphatase 4). DRAM1: damage-regulated autophagy modulator
