caption: Glucose is transported into the cardiomyocyte by glucose transporters (GLUT).
  Following phosphorylation by hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is fed into
  the glycogen synthetic pathway, glycolysis, or the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  Phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK 1) is the first commitment enzyme of glycolysis. The
  glycolytic product pyruvate is transported into mitochondria or converted to lactate
  by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a pivotal enzyme
  to catabolize pyruvate to acetyl CoA, which ultimately enters the citrate acid cycle.
  PDH enzymatic activity is inhibited by PDK4-dependent phosphorylation and stimulated
  by dephosphorylation via PDH phosphatase. Free fatty acids (FFAs) are transported
  into cardiomyocytes by diffusion or via a fatty acid translocase, such as CD36.
  Once inside the cell, FFAs are esterified to fatty acyl CoA by fatty acyl CoA synthase
  (FACS). The carnitine shuttle, composed of CPT-I, CPT-II, and CAT, is responsible
  for the transport of FFA from the cytosol to mitochondria for beta-oxidation, which
  generates acetyl CoA for the citric acid cycle. Glucose and FFA metabolic pathways
  are subject to complex reciprocal regulation. Citrate can be transported to the
  cytosol, where it undergoes lysis to acetyl CoA. Cytosolic acetyl CoA is converted
  to malonyl CoA by acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Malonyl CoA is a potent inhibitor
  of CPT-1 and FFA metabolism.
