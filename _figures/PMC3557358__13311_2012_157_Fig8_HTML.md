caption: Proposed mechanism of neuroprotection of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDI)
  Scriptaid against traumatic brain injury (TBI). (A) Mechanistic relationships between
  phosphorylated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (p-PTEN),
  PTEN, and phospho-AKT (p-AKT), as well as the impact of Scriptaid on these pathways.
  A decrease in p-PTEN results in the concomitant increase in active PTEN, which converts
  PIP3 to PIP2, preventing the phosphorylation of PDK1 and the activation of AKT.
  Scriptaid treatment increases p-PTEN, leading to a concomitant decrease in active
  PTEN. This loss of PTEN function by phosphorylation results in the downstream activation
  of the AKT pathway. As a consequence of enhanced phospho-AKT (p-AKT) signaling,
  cell survival is promoted and neurite integrity is preserved. (B) The loss of histone
  acetyltransferase (HAT) function or increased HDAC activity leads to a decrease
  in histone/transcription factor acetylation and transcriptional repression. This
  may partly underlie neurological damage associated with TBI. HDAC inhibition by
  Scriptaid may be protective by shifting the HAT-HDAC balance in favor of HAT activity,
  so that the histones remain acetylated and gene expression is activated. We also
  propose that the accumulation of acetylated histones in nucleosomes leads to expression
  of specific genes, which, in turn, are responsible for the protection elicited by
  Scriptaid
