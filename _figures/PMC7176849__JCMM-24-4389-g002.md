caption: As one of inflammatory mediators, S1P serves as a mediator for inflammatory
  osteolysis. Excessive osteoclast proliferation and destruction of bone homeostasis
  are the main characteristics of inflammatory osteolysis, and macrophages are found
  to participate in this process. Macrophages can be recruited into inflamed sites
  of bone marrow, and S1P acts as a promoter for the polarization of M0‐MΦs into M1‐MΦs
  via S1PR3 signal pathway. Besides, the release of TNF‐α, IL‐1β and IL‐6 from M1‐MΦs
  can interact with S1P to participate in the regulation of bone turnover. TNF‐α and
  IL‐1β exert direct promotional effect on osteoclast differentiation, while IL‐6
  elevates RANKL expression to boost osteoclastogenesis. In addition, the polarization
  of M2‐MΦs can be stimulated by S1PR1 signal pathway, which exerts osteogenic effect
  by secreting TGF‐β
