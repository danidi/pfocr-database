caption: 'Model of platelet antistaphylococcal response mechanisms. As supported by
  current data, the model illustrates how platelets may be activated to respond in
  parallel pathways that promote staphylocidal efficacy. (A) At the cellular level,
  the interaction with S. aureus evokes distinct responses in resting platelets: the
  liberation (and putative processing) of PMPs and PKs, which exert direct microbicidal
  effects on the organism, and the secretion of adenosine nucleotides (ADP/ATP), triggering
  a recursive cascade for the activation of adjacent platelets. Note that inhibitors
  of the ADP/ATP platelet activation pathway preclude the platelet staphylocidal response.
  (B) Detailed aspects of the model at the molecular level are illustrated. The degradation
  of extracellular ADP by APY or the inhibition of P2X or P2Y12 adenosine nucleotide
  receptors by SUR (a general P2 inhibitor), PND (a high-affinity P2X1 inhibitor),
  or CNG (a high-affinity P2Y12 inhibitor) specifically prevents platelet (PLT) staphylocidal
  efficacy. In contrast, the antagonism of P2Y1, phospholipase C (PLC), TXA2, or COX
  pathways or the CD41, CD42b, or CD62P platelet adhesin receptor did not impede the
  staphylocidal responses of platelets. Thus, the antistaphylococcal efficacy of platelets
  involves a self-amplifying and recursive sense/response mechanism: (1) direct or
  indirect interactions of platelets and S. aureus (SA); (2) platelet activation,
  with autocrine or intercrine P2X1 or P2Y12 receptor-mediated signal transduction
  prompting granule mobilization; (3) the degranulation and liberation of ADP/ATP
  from δ-granules; (4) the deployment of direct antimicrobial effector molecules (PMPs
  and PKs) from α-granules; and (5) the adenosine nucleotide-mediated activation of
  adjacent platelets, with the ensuing amplification of antimicrobial responses. The
  observed pattern of relationships between platelet-to-S. aureus exposure ratios
  and staphylocidal efficacy is suggestive of a threshold platelet ratio necessary
  to sustain an intercrine platelet cascade required to achieve PMP/PK concentrations
  sufficient for staphylocidal efficacy.'
