caption: 'Overview of the microbial, sugar-based, solvent production pathways for
  alcohols, terpenoids, and aromatic compounds. (1) Aromatics (yellow) are predominantly
  based on Tyr(osine) and synthesized through the shikimate (Shik.) pathway [,]. (2)
  Alcohols (blue) are derived from metabolic routes such as glycolysis, fatty acid
  biosynthesis (FAB), and the branched amino acids pathway (such as Val(ine)) [,].
  (3) Terpenoids (orange) are derived from the isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) or
  dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) precursors which emerge from the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose
  5-phosphate (DXP) or mevalonate (MEV) isoprenoid pathways [,,]. Abbreviations: PP,
  pentose-phosphate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxy-acetone phosphate;
  G3P, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; PYR, pyruvate; Ac-coA, acetyl-coenzyme A; AcAc-coA,
  acetoacetyl-coenzyme A; EtOH, ethanol; (i-)BuOH, (iso-)butanol; LCFA, long-chain
  fatty alcohols; α-Pin, α-pinene; Far, farnesene; PhOH, phenol and OH-styr, hydroxy-styrene.'
