caption: Postulated mechanistic pathways. a The control experiments (Eqs. (1) and
  (2)) show that the desymmetrization process is the main contributor to the observed
  ee of the product and the second acylation is a effective KR process that could
  improve the ee of (−)-3a. b The postulated mechanistic pathway to generate product
  (−)-3a
