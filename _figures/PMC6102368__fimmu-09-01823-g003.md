caption: Crosstalk between Notch and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in the tumor
  environment. TNF-α induces Notch activation through NF-κB pathway in tumor cells.
  1. TNF-α activates Ikkβ inducing the expression of the Notch target gene HES1. HES1,
  in turn, inhibits the expression of the anti-inflammatory receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ (PPARγ) with a consequent increased production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β,
  that recruit macrophages and neutrophils in the tumor site (). 2. TNF-α promotes
  Notch signaling by activating Ikkα, that in turn phosphorylates and inhibits FOXA2,
  thereby reducing the transcription of the target gene Numb, a Notch repressor ().
  3. In tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), NF-κB-p65, a
  key mediator of TNF-α/TNFR signaling, transactivates Jagged1 and 2 promoters and
  induces their expression stimulating the tolerogenic activity of tumor-associated
  MDSCs ().
