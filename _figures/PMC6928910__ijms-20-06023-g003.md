caption: A model for the regulation of cellular senescence and ageing by Δ40p53. Δ40p53
  directly regulates the IGF-1 signaling pathway to modulate cell growth and survival
  factors. On the other hand, the binding of Δ40p53 to full-length p53 regulates the
  transcriptional activity of full-length p53 on target genes and its capacity to
  bind Mdm2 for proteasomal degradation. Regulation of the IGF-1 signaling pathway
  and full-length p53 by Δ40p53 affects not only cellular senescence and ageing but
  also the pluripotency of ESCs and neurodegeneration.
