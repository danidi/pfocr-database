caption: Pathway for protein modification by UFM1. Matured UFM1 generated from its
  precursor by UFSP2 is activated by UBA5 (E1), transferred to UFC1 (E2), and then
  conjugated to target substrates by UFL1 (E3) with the aid of UFBP1. This ufmylation
  pathway can be reversed by USFP2. “S ~” indicates the thioester bond.
