caption: The O-mannosyl linked glycans on α dystroglycan are comprised of linear chain
  of four carbohydrates. There are six genes known to cause congenital muscular dystrophy
  that alter the glycosylation of dystroglycan on its O-linked chains. POMT1 and POMT2
  (defective in Walker Warburg syndrome) are both required to synthesize the O-mannosyl
  linkage and POMGnT1 (defective in muscle-eye-brain disease) synthesizes the β1,2GlcNAc
  linkage. Three other genes also likely affect this pathway; fukutin (defective in
  Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, fukutin-related protein (FKRP, defective
  in congenital muscular dystrophy 1C, Limb Girdle muscular dystrophy 2I, and WWS),
  and LARGE (defective in congenital muscular dystrophy 1D). The function of these
  three genes is not currently known.
