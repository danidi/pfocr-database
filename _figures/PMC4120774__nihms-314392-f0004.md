caption: This pathway has been shown to be inhibited by DIM; these kinases transduce
  the signal by phosphorylating downstream protein kinases. Some of the phosphorylated
  signaling molecules translocate to the nucleus to activate transcription factors
  (such as AP-1) which regulate the expression of select set of genes.
