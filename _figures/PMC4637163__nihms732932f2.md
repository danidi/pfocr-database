caption: 'This figure shows how the microenvironment can transform the phenotype of
  MDSCs into pro-tumor cells. Pro-tumor neutrophils have been shown to release factors
  such as HNPs 1–3, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, G+CSF, IL-8 and IL-6, all of which promote bladder
  carcinogenesis. Pro-tumor monocyte/macrophages release several factors that result
  in bladder tumor angiogenesis as well as tumor cell protection against apoptosis.
  Several reactive oxygen species are released resulting in DNA, RNA, protein, and
  lipid damage. MDSC: Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells; HNP: Human Neutrophil Protein'
