caption: Schematic representation of C5b-9-induced lysosomal dysfunction that inactivates
  autophagy in podocytes. The sublytic C5b-9 membrane attack complex assembled via
  activation the alternative complement pathway increases autophagic induction, and
  also likely triggers intracellular signaling mediators to induce lysosomal dysfunction
  caused by lysosomal membrane permeabilization, resulting in the accumulation of
  autophagosomes and autophagic inactivation, which leads to podocyte injuries.
