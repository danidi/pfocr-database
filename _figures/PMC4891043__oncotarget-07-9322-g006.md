caption: A. Schematic illustration of “FABP5 (fatty acids)-PPARγ-VEGF” transduction
  axis. Through this pathway, fatty acids transported by FABP5 can activate PPARγ
  which ultimately upregulate VEGF. VEGF is a potent antigenic factor which can bind
  to its receptor VEGFR1 to promote formation of vessel networks that are essential
  for growth and expansion of the cancer cells. VEGF can also promote directly malignancy
  of the cancer cells through an autocrine mechanism to simulate the receptor that
  is highly expressed on the surface of the prostate cancer cells (VEGFR-2) (Gonzalez-Moreno
  et al, 2010). B. Schematic illustration of inter-relationship between androgen-Sp1/Sp3
  (sugars) and FABP5 (fatty acids)- PPARγ signaling routes in up-regulating VEGF in
  androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells. The results in
  this study suggested that in the early stage of prostate cancer, when the cancer
  cells are still responsive to androgen stimulation, the androgen-Sp1 pathway plays
  a dominant role in promoting VEGF expression. As the cancer cells gradually reduce
  their dependency on androgen supply and ultimately lose their responsive to androgen,
  the role of androgen-Sp1 pathway is gradually reduced and ultimately disappeared
  in AR-negative or androgen independent cancer cells. Opposite to this androgen-Sp1
  pathway, the activity of FABP5-PPARγ-VEGF pathway in low malignant and androgen
  dependent cells (with low level of FABP5) is very low. But its activity is increased
  steadily as the increasing level of FABP5 and the malignancy of the cells and becomes
  dominant in CRPC cells.
