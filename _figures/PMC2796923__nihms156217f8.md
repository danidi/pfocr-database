caption: The natural pathway for the biosynthesis of TDP-d-desosamine (43) and the
  glycosylated methymycin/pikromycin derivatives (187, 219–221) produced by S. venezuelae
  are shown in the boxed pathway. Disruption of individual des genes (highlighted
  in blue), combined with heterologus expression of foreign genes (highlighted in
  red) was used to engineer a variety of novel, glycosylated macrolide derivatives
  (222–232).
