caption: Decidual nutrient sensing. A model linking decreased nutrient and oxygen
  availability in the decidua in early pregnancy to the development of IUGR. Both
  insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and IGF-II are key regulators of placental
  function, and both growth factors are abundantly present in the maternal circulation
  and at the maternal–fetal interface. However, because phosphorylation of IGFBP-1
  increases the affinity for binding IGF-I but not IGF-II only IGF-I is depicted in
  the figure (see the text). AAR, amino acid response pathway; CK2, casein kinase
  2; IGFBP-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1; IGF-I, insulin-like growth
  factor I; IUGR, intrauterine growth restriction; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin.
