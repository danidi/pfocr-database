caption: 'The three routes in phenylpropanoid metabolism (labelled 1, 2 and 3) proposed
  for the chlorogenic acid synthesis in plants. Enzymes involved in the pathway are:
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl
  CoA ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase;
  C3H, p-coumarate 3''-hydroxylase; HQT, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA quinate hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; UGCT, UDP glucose: cinnamate glucosyl transferase; HCGQT, hydroxycinnamoyl
  D-glucose: quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (adapted from [25]).'
