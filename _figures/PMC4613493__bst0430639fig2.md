caption: 'Nrf2 induces genes that encode enzymes of the PPP and other NADPH generating
  enzymes (Me1). Pparγ induction by Nrf2 can potentially lead indirectly to elevated
  Srebp-1c expression and increased lipogenesis. On the other hand, activation of
  Nrf2 pathway leads to reduced expression of the lipogenic enzymes Acl, Acc and Fasn.
  The molecular mechanisms of this repressed expression are not fully known yet. Abbreviations:
  ACL, ATP citrate lyase; MDH1, malate dehydrogenase 1. → Denotes induction; ┤ Denotes
  repression.'
