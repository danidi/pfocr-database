caption: 'Proinsulin and its biosynthetic pathway. A, pathway of insulin biosynthesis
  beginning with preproinsulin (upper): signal peptide (gray), B-domain (blue), dibasic
  BC junction (green), C-domain (red), dibasic CA junction (green), and A-domain (red).
  In the ER, the unfolded prohormone undergoes specific disulfide pairing to yield
  native proinsulin (center). Cleavage of BC and CA junctions by prohormone convertases
  (PC1 and PC2) and carboxypeptidase E leads to mature insulin and the C-peptide (lower).
  SRP/SRP-R, signal recognition particle/signal recognition particle receptor. B,
  structural model of insulin-like moiety and disordered connecting peptide (dashed
  black line). The A- and B-domains are shown in red and blue, respectively; the disordered
  connecting domain is shown by the dashed black line. Cystines are labeled in yellow
  boxes. C, cellular pathway of insulin biosynthesis. Nascent proinsulin folds as
  a monomer in the rough ER (rER; left), wherein zinc ion concentration is low; in
  post-Golgi granules, proinsulin is processed by cleavage of the connecting peptide
  to yield mature insulin, and zinc-stabilized hexamers begin to assemble. Zinc-insulin
  crystals are observed in secretory granules. Upon secretion into the portal circulation
  (right), hexamers dissociate to yield bioactive insulin monomers. Although the structure
  of an isolated monomer resembles that of a crystallographic protomer, marked changes
  in conformation may be required for receptor binding. Native hexamer assembly and
  induced fit of the insulin monomer may provide complementary structural adaptations
  to the threat of toxic protein misfolding (, , ).'
