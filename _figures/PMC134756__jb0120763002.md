caption: 'Bioreaction network of E. coli central carbon metabolism. Arrows indicate
  the assumed reaction reversibility or irreversibility. Fluxes to biomass building
  blocks are indicated by solid arrows. The isotopomer distribution in bold metabolites
  is directly accessible by [13C,1H]-COSY NMR of amino acids. Abbreviations: G6P,
  glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; P5P, pentose phosphates; PP pathway,
  pentose phosphate pathway; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; S7P, seduheptulose-7-phosphate;
  T3P, triose-3-phosphate; PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate; ACA, acetyl-coenzyme A; ACE, acetate;
  OGA, 2-oxoglutarate; PYR. pyruvate; FUM, fumarate; MAL, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  and PTS system, PEP:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system for glucose uptake.'
