caption: Schematic of the possible role of ZmPTF1 in the crosstalk network of the
  abiotic stress response and root system development. This is a suggested working
  model of ZmPTF1 based on the morphological, physiological, promoter binding, and
  downstream gene expression analyses in this study and the literature. The expression
  of ZmPTF1 is induced by abiotic stresses such as drought and low-phosphate stress.
  ZmPTF1 could then bind to the G-box cis-element in the promoter of NCEDs to increase
  the synthesis of ABA and activate the ABA signalling pathway. Based on the promoter
  binding assay, ZmPTF1 could bind to the G-box cis-element in the promoter of CBF4,
  ATAF2/NAC81, NAC30, IAA3, WRKY, and MYB15 and dramatically increase the expression
  of these transcription factors. The stress response processes mediated by these
  genes were more active in the ZmPTF1 overexpression line compared with the WT. These
  transcription factors were shown to be positive regulators of the stress response
  and/or root growth and development. ZmPTF1 contributes to drought tolerance mainly
  by promoting root system development and activating the stress response pathways.
