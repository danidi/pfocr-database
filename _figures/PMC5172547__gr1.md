caption: Software architecture of the comprehensive software suite. The software suite
  includes tools for the detection of translation initiation and termination signals,
  statistical analysis of codon usage, comparative study of amino acid composition,
  comparative modeling of the structures of product proteins, prediction of alternative
  splice forms, and comparative systems biology by metabolic pathway reconstruction.
  It therefore covers the levels of nucleotide sequence, codons, mRNA variants, amino
  acid sequence, protein structure, and metabolic pathway. Rectangular boxes indicate
  external software and databases used in the package.
