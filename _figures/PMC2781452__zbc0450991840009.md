caption: Proposed model. Manipulation of the HIF pathway is proposed to result in
  induction of gene products that are neuroprotective against MPTP toxicity. Under
  conditions of non-stress and substrate availability, PHD hydroxylates proline residues
  on HIFα transcription factors to be targeted for proteasomal degradation. Stabilized
  HIFα arise from the inhibition of PHD brought about by either pharmacological sequestration
  of PHD substrates by DHB or chelation of iron as co-factor by CQ. Consequently,
  induction of genes containing HIF-responsive elements result in elevated expression
  of proteins responsible for maintaining catecholamine biosynthesis (TH), mitochondrial
  and/or respiratory function (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator,
  PGC-1α; MnSOD, PDH), intracellular iron homeostasis and oxidative stress (HO-1 and
  ferroportin (FPT)), cellular functions that are compromised in Parkinson disease
  and recapitulated in MPTP models of DA neurotoxicity.
