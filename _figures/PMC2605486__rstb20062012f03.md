caption: Progressive changes in progenitor cells during motor neuron development.
  (i) Neural progenitors expressing Sox1–3 are held in an undifferentiated and unpatterned
  state through the actions of FGFs. (ii) The combined actions of Shh and RA signalling
  ventralizes neural progenitors through the induction of progenitor transcription
  factors, such as Nkx6. (iii) Continued exposure to Shh and RA leads to the induction
  of Olig2 in bipotential motor neuron/oligodendrocyte progenitors. (iv) In the presence
  of RA and absence of Notch signalling, Olig2+ cells express Ngn2 and Sox21 and begin
  to exit the cell cycle and differentiate into motor neurons. (v) The further differentiation
  of motor neurons requires the ongoing RA signalling, as well as the downregulation
  of Olig2. (vi) Activation of the Notch signalling pathway prevents the expression
  of Ngn2 in Olig2+ motor neuron/oligodendrocyte progenitors and maintains these cells
  in an undifferentiated state until additional temporal cues direct the formation
  of oligodendrocytes from these cells. Notch signalling may also positively promote
  oligodendrocyte development (dashed line). See text for more details.
