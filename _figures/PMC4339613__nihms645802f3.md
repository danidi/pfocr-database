caption: Hypoxia inhibits prolyl hydroxylation of HIFα, which leads to its stabilization
  and activation as a heterodimer transcription factor with HIFβ. Free radicals produced
  by oxidative stresses are also known to activate the HIF-pathway. NRF2, a main regulator
  of the antioxidative responses, has been recently recognized as a tumorigenic factor,
  which plays a role under hypoxia. In human colorectal cancer cells, when NRF2 is
  deficient, the HIF-VEGF pathway and tumor angiogenesis are inhibited, indicating
  that these two proteins may cooperate for tumor progression [].
