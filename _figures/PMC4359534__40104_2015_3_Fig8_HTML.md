caption: Cell-cell signaling and interaction, molecular transport, small molecular
  biochemistry. Pathway analysis of gene functions in broiler hypothalamus transcriptome
  in response to acute heat stress. Red color shows up-regulation and green color
  shows down-regulation (IPA). The intensity of green and red molecule colors indicates
  the degree of down or upregulation, respectively. White molecules are not differential
  expression, but are included to illustrate association with significantly up-regulated
  and down-regulated genes.
