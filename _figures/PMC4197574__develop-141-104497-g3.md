caption: Studying ultradian oscillations using optogenetic tools. (A) The LightOn
  system has been used to study the functional roles of Ascl1 in neural progenitors
  (). In this system, GAVPO proteins form dimers upon blue light illumination, leading
  to the transcription of Ascl1 fused downstream of the UAS promoter. Using this approach,
  it has been shown that sustained versus oscillating Ascl1 expression gives rise
  to different outcomes. (B) The CRY2-Raf system has been used to study the role of
  ERK pulses in proliferating cells (). Upon blue light stimulation, CRY2-cRaf rapidly
  associates with CIBN-KrasCT, which is anchored to the cell membrane. This association
  triggers activation of the MEK-ERK pathway. In the absence of light, CRY2-cRaf dissociates
  from CIBN-KrasCT, thereby inactivating the pathway. Using this method, it was shown
  that different schedules of ERK activation control the activation of different sets
  of genes. (C) The Opto-SOS system has also been used to study the MEK-ERK signaling
  cascade and confirmed that the dynamics of ERK activation indeed determine the downstream
  response (). This system consists of the Phy-PIF system, which can be activated
  and inactivated by red and by near-infrared light illumination, respectively. When
  activated, PIF-SOS associates with the membrane-anchored Phy-B, resulting in activation
  of the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway. It is worth noting that the Opto-SOS system activates
  Ras, which is upstream of Raf, whereas the CRY2-Raf system directly controls Raf.
