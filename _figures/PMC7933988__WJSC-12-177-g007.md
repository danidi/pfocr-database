caption: 'Proposed mechanism of action of mesenchymal stem cells in the vestibular
  microenvironment. Mice were first prophylactically infused with mesenchymal stem
  cells (MSCs). After that, the motion sickness (MS) model was established at specified
  time points. At this time, pro-inflammatory cytokines in the vestibular environment
  of mice were released. MSCs were stimulated by these cytokines to secrete interleukin-10
  (IL-10). Then, IL-10 receptors on fibrocytes in the cochlear lateral wall were triggered
  to activate the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Finally, the sensitivity of the vestibular
  cortex was reduced. IL: Interleukin; TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha; MSCs: Mesenchymal
  stem cells; SOCS: Suppressor of cytokine signalling; Myc: Myelocytomatosis oncogene;
  CTFs: C-terminal fragments.'
