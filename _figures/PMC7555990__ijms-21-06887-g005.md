caption: Potential pathway of the gut–skeletal muscle axis in sarcopenic obesity.
  Gut dysbiosis seems to negatively influence skeletal muscle health. AMPK, PGC-1α,
  NF-κB, PI3k-mTOR, and FoxO signaling are considered as potential signaling pathways
  in the gut–skeletal muscle axis. Gut dysbiosis can be triggered by aging, diet,
  lifestyle, and disease. The intestinal gut could lose the tight junction barrier
  and increase intestinal permeability with a less beneficial microbiome and higher
  pathologic microbiome. Toxic bacterial metabolites such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
  or single chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are disclosed through a leaky gut, which can
  trigger a pro-inflammatory response via inflammatory cytokines. Skeletal muscle
  could lose function by gut dysbiosis-induced inflammation and dysfunctional mitochondria.
  Additionally, ROS would increase and produce many DAMPs in skeletal muscle cells,
  aggravating SOB. Arrow (↓, ↑) indicates decreased or increased status, respectively.
