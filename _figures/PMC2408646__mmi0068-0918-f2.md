caption: A. Schematic representation of the moaABCDE operon of E. coli. Nucleotide
  numbers for the genome region upstream of the moaA ORF are established by defining
  the first transcription start site (S1) as +1 and a second transcription start site
  (S2) as −87. The approximate locations of the FNR and ModE binding sites are indicated
  with filled boxes, and the region designated as the Moco RNA motif begins and ends
  with the terminal nucleotides of P1 (). Numbering system and locations of various
  features are as reported previously (). B. Pathway for molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis
  in eubacteria (). Proteins with abbreviated designations are enzymes in the pathway
  except for ModABC, which is an ABC-type molybdate transporter. The precise function
  of MoaB is unknown, but structural studies (; ) indicate that it is similar to MogA
  and therefore is likely to be involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis. Question marks
  indicate that the biosynthetic enzymes for the conversion are not known. Other proteins
  listed are enzymes that use Moco derivatives as coenzymes. Proteins whose coding
  regions are located downstream and near a Moco RNA motif in at least one organism
  are highlighted with black shading.
