caption: 'Network for the genes included in mitochondrial functioning processes. The
  network was built using Pathway Studio. A yellow rectangle indicates cellular process,
  red ellipse indicates studied genes, purple rectangle indicates disease (PD), light
  blue indicates cell (neuron). Arrows indicates interaction between gene and object:
  grey – regulation, burgundy – Genetic change, dark blue - quantitative change, green
  - Promoter Binding, pink – Expression, aquamarine - Cell expression.'
