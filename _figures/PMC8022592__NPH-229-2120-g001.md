caption: Differential regulation of breast cancer cell growth by methyljasmonate (MeJA)
  or MeJA‐treated leaf disks. Treatments with MeJA (left) or MeJA‐treated leaf disks
  (right) on breast cancer cells alter proteinlevels of different core cell cycle
  regulators and the mechanistic target of rampamycin (mTOR) pathway, resulting in
  tumour growth inhibition. MeJA treatment induces changes in Cyclin‐dependent kinase
  inhibitor 1A (p21) and Cyclin E1 (CYCE1)levels, while inducing the accumulation
  of the components of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. By contrast, incubation with
  MeJA‐treated leaf disks not only affects cell division cycle 6 (CDC6), Cyclin‐dependent
  kinase 2 (CDK2), Cyclin E1 (CYCE1), CyclinD1, CyclinD3 and Cyclin‐dependent kinase
  inhibitor 1A (p21), but also inhibits the accumulation of the mTORC2 complex. Names
  and 2D structures (PubChem) of compounds discovered through MS/MS are indicated.
  Red and green shapes indicate accumulation or reduction in proteinlevels, respectively.
