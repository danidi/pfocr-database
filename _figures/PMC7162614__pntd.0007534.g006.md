caption: (A) Collectins (e.g. MBL) or ficolins (e.g. FCN-3) recognize pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs), composed of sugar/acetylated groups on M. leprae. MASP-2
  (not depicted in this image) and MASP-1 homodimers complexed with them activate
  the lectin pathway of complement, whereas MASP-3 may activate the alternative pathway.
  Both pathways lead to C3b-opsonization and CR1-mediated internalization of the pathogen.
  (B) Healthy individuals with rs1109452 and rs850314 CA or CG haplotypes express
  higher MASP-3 levels. Higher MASP-3 and MAp44 levels were also associated with resistance
  against the disease. (C) CpG methylation at the CG haplotype in exon 12 may impair
  mRNA transcription, spliceosome assembly and mRNA processing. Reduced MASP-3 levels
  may also result from the differential recognition of CA and CG haplotypes by miRNAs
  (miR-2861 and miR-3181, respectively). (D) Individuals with TG haplotypes present
  lower baseline MASP-3 levels. Lower MASP-3 and MAp44 levels seem to predispose to
  the infection, possibly by optimizing opsonin coverage of the parasite.
