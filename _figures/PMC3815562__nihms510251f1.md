caption: Outline of steps mediating androgen synthesis and metabolism in prostate
  cancer cells. Pathways that may contribute to androgen synthesis in prostate are
  outlined. Bold arrows and brackets outline what appears to be the major pathway
  for generation of testosterone and DHT in PCa cells after ADT when adrenal synthesis
  of weak androgens is intact and there are high levels of circulating DHEA-S. PCa
  cells can also synthesize at least trace amounts of testosterone directly from cholesterol
  through the sequential actions of CYP11A1, CYP17A1, HSD3B1 or 2, and AKR1C3 through
  the pathway that is normally active only in the adrenal glands and testes (also
  shown in brackets). It should be noted that testes uses 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  type 3 rather than AKR1C3 to generate testosterone (not shown). A possible alternative
  ‘backdoor’ pathway is also shown that may bypass testosterone and generate DHT from
  androsterone. In some cases more than one enzyme can carry out a particular step
  (HSD3B1 or HSD3B2; AKR1C2 or AKR1C3; and SRD5A1 or SRD5A2). Inhibitors of enzymes
  in the pathways are also indicated.
