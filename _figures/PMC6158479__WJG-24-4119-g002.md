caption: 'Protective function of the calcium-sensing receptor against inflammation
  and carcinogenesis in the colon. Left: The CaSR promotes intestinal barrier integrity,
  potentially by promoting claudin-2 expression, and inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, thus preventing inflammation. Right: The CaSR exerts an anti-tumourigenic
  effect by counteracting the mitogenic Wnt pathway, preventing β-catenin translocation
  into the nucleus, which is either sequestered by E-cadherin at the cell junctions
  or it is degraded by the non-canonical Wnt signalling (Ror2-Wnt5A) and inhibits
  the expression of mesenchymal and stem cells markers. IL: Interleukin; CaSR: Calcium-sensing
  receptor.'
