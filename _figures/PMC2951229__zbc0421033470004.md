caption: Carbon backbone rearrangement during the metabolism of glucose through the
  EMP and pentose phosphate (PP) pathways and its effect on the labeling pattern and
  fractions of intact versus broken fragments of pyruvate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and
  3-phosphoglycerate. For simplicity, only irreversible routes are depicted. A 12.5,
  25, and 62.5% mixture of uniformly labeled, C1-labeled, and unlabeled glucose, respectively,
  was used for this illustration. Labeled and unlabeled carbon atoms are illustrated
  by filled and open circles, respectively. Carbon atoms connected by − represent
  intact fragments arising from source glucose molecule and absence of – between two
  carbon atoms represents a broken bond. The numbers next to a molecule represent
  the total number of that species formed when 15 molecules of uniformly labeled,
  30 molecules of C1-labeled, and 75 molecules of unlabeled glucose were processed
  through the EMP or pentose phosphate pathways. As in the example shown, there is
  no direct carbon backbone rearrangement between glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (T3P),
  3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and pyruvate (PYR); the numbers
  will be the same for these four metabolites. The fi values shown in rectangular
  boxes depict the fraction of intact and broken carbon fragments relative to the
  central carbon atoms of the aforementioned metabolites (see text for definition
  of fi). Two sets of fi values are shown, one for the case when these metabolites
  are generated via the EMP pathway (left box) and the other one when they are generated
  through the PPP (right box). Also shown in a rounded box is the interconversion
  of serine, glycine, and one-carbon (1-C) units, which is the major source of glycine
  and 1-C units for cellular metabolism (). The reversible conversion of pyruvate
  to acetyl-CoA via PFL is included in the same box.
