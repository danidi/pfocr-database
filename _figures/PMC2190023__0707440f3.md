caption: Possible mechanism for endocannabinoid-mediated control of nociception. (A)
  Diagrammatical representation of some of the interactions between various brain
  regions of the descending pain pathway. The PAG receives critical input from various
  cortical areas as well as from the hypothalamus and amygdala. The net input of afferent
  neurons to the PAG determines the firing of the various PAG cell types. (B) Two
  possible outcomes of this net input. In resting conditions (no pain) the sum effect
  on the input of ON and OFF cells to the dorsal horn is neutral. Painful stimuli
  are proposed to selectively activate pathway (b), where these excitatory neurons
  from pathways upstream of the PAG project onto inhibitory projection neurons (possibly
  GABAergic) as well as inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. This activation of inhibitory
  interneurons in the PAG prevents firing of excitatory projection neurons (possibly
  glutamate) and negatively impacts on OFF cells in the RVM. Simultaneously, GABAergic
  projection neurons from the PAG synapse on GABAergic interneurons in the RVM and
  disinhibit their suppression of firing of ON neurons to result in nociception. The
  mediation of antinociception is achieved through pathway (a), when excitatory neurons
  from pathways upstream of the PAG activate excitatory neurons in the PAG. These
  excitatory neurons in turn activate the firing of OFF cells, and inhibit the firing
  of ON cells through GABAergic interneurons. It is also proposed that the activity
  of OFF cells negatively impacts on the firing of ON cells through an inhibitory
  mechanism and possibly impacts on OFF-cell duration (represented by an asterix).
  (C) The circled section of (B), illustrates the possible mechanism behind cannabinoid-mediated
  antinociception. The activation of various receptor subtypes leads to an increase
  in intracellular calcium by various pathways. This increase in calcium concentration
  initiates endocannabinoid synthesis and release. The released endocannabinoids can
  then prevent the presynaptic release of neurotransmitters possibly by inhibiting
  calcium influx or vesicular release of neurotransmitters. See abbreviations list.

  description: Possible mechanism for endocannabinoid-mediated control of nociception.
    (A) Diagrammatical representation of some of the interactions between various

    This activation of inhibitory interneurons in the PAG prevents firing of excitatory
