caption: Schematic of NF-kB signaling pathways. NF-kB transcription factors are activated
  in classical or alternative signaling pathways. Molecules that have preclinical
  and clinical inhibitors are highlighted in red. Much of the development for therapeutic
  targets has been focused on the classical signaling cascade. In the classical pathway,
  stimulation by TNF, for example, triggers IκB kinase (IKK)β to phosphorylate the
  inhibitory IκB proteins, leading to their rapid ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated
  degradation which culminates in the release of NF-κB complexes from their inhibitory
  interaction (, , ). As a result, NF-κB heterodimers p50/p65 translocate to the nucleus
  where they activate transcription of a plethora of genes involved in immune response,
  cell growth, and cell survival (, , ). The alternative NF-κB cascade is typically
  stimulated by Lymphotoxin β which triggers IKKα homodimers to phosphorylate p100/NF-κB2,
  resulting in proteasomal removal of an inhibitory C-terminal domain, and generating
  the NF-κB p52 subunit (). Consequently, p52/RelB heterodimers preferentially accumulate
  in the nucleus, and activate transcription, based on subtleties in DNA motif preference
  ().
