caption: 'The methyl cycle in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. AdoMet functions
  in three main metabolic pathways from the methyl cycle: transmethylation, transsulfuration,
  and aminopropylation. Transmethylation reactions are catalyzed by methyltransferases,
  which transfer the methyl group from AdoMet to a wide range of acceptor molecules.
  The transfer of the methyl group from AdoMet leaves S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy)
  as a byproduct. AdoHcy is converted to adenosine and homocysteine (Hcy) via the
  enzyme adenosylhomocysteinase. This reaction occurs only if adenosine and Hcy levels
  are low, which the cell must balance to prevent buildup of AdoHcy and therefore
  the prevention of AdoMet-dependent methylation reactions. Methionine can be regenerated
  by methylation of Hcy via methionine synthase (MS). Remethylation via MS requires
  products of the folate cycle, specifically 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), which
  is then converted to THF when it loses its methyl group. The folate cycle is required
  for dNTP production, specifically dTTPs, and therefore correct balance of dNTPs.
  Furthermore, dNTP pool size is monitored by dATP/ATP ratios. As AdoMet, produced
  from ATP and methionine, is the second most used enzyme substrate (behind ATP);
  deviations in its production could alter ATP ratios (if ATP is not converted to
  AdoMet due to lack of AdoMet synthetases) and further disrupt appropriate dNTP production.
  The conversion of Hcy to cysteine is a two-step reaction with the production of
  cystathionine as an intermediate. This requires two enzymes cystathionine β-synthase,
  and cystathionine γ-lyase. Cysteine is the rate-limiting precursor to glutathione
  (GSH) synthesis. GSH, used with glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), are a major oxidative
  species sink used by cells to prevent DNA and protein reaction with reactive oxygen
  species. AdoMet decarboxylase, decarboxylates AdoMet to then enter the polyamine
  synthesis pathway. Polyamines are low-molecular-weight, positively charged molecules
  that include spermidine and spermine, with known roles in growth and apoptosis.'
