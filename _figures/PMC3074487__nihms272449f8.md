caption: Binding of FGF7 to the FGFR2b (1) stimulates ADAM17 in a manner that can
  be blocked by inhibitors of Src kinases, p38 MAP-kinase and of phosphatidylinositol
  3 (PI3) kinase, which is responsible for the conversion of phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (2).
  Stimulation of ADAM17 by FGF7 requires its transmembrane domain, but not the cytoplasmic
  domain. Activation of ADAM17 triggers release of membrane proteins that include
  the EGFR-ligand HB-EGF (3), which activates the EGFR (4) and ERK1/2 (5), thereby
  promoting FGF7-stimulated cell migration in keratinocytes. Both the FGFR2b and the
  EGFR are known to have critical roles in skin repair and inflammation of the skin
  ,.
