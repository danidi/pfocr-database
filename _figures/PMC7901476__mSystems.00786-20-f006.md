caption: Exemplary metabolic sketch of BSC Rubrobacteraceae species based on the most
  abundant MAG. The sketch illustrates basic energy generation and C acquisition mechanisms,
  as well as some stress resistance and survival mechanisms. Rubrobacteraceae encode
  genetic potential for a mixotrophic lifestyle with rhodopsin and a high-affinity
  hydrogenase to generate proton motive force. The exact functions of CO dehydrogenase
  and propane monooxygenase homologs are yet to be determined. The C metabolism is
  optimized for efficient C utilization by using phosphotransferase sugar import systems
  (PTS) and glyoxylate bypass of the TCA cycle. It is important to note the absence
  of terminal cytochrome c oxidase in the respiratory chain and exclusive reliance
  on the manganese-based catalase for combating reactive oxygen species (ROS). DNA-binding
  rubrerythrin might also contribute to preventing ROS damage to DNA. Also note the
  presence of an additional homolog of PolA polymerase (COG0749), key in double-stranded
  DNA break repair. For pathway evaluation, RAST annotations were analyzed with Pathway
  Tools v.24 (), and missing enzymes, usually due to the absence of an EC number in
  the annotation or the use of an uncommon synonymous enzyme name, were searched manually
  in RAST and other annotations of the MAGs. The depicted pathways are simplified
  versions of pathway depictions in the MetaCyc database () used by Pathway Tools
  software.
