caption: Negative Regulation of PRR-induced signalling. (A) Dectin-1 binds β-glucan
  particles (such as yeasts) to form the “phagocytic synapse”. The physical interaction
  between particulate β-glucan and Dectin-1 results in exclusion of CD45 and CD148
  tyrosine phosphatases from the synapse. This facilitates Dectin-1 signalling via
  Src/Syk activation. Soluble β-glucans are unable to exclude the tyrosine phosphatases
  from the synapse therefore Dectin-1 signalling is blocked by the inhibitory activity
  of CD45 and CD148. (B) CLR activation results in their ubiquitination and degradation
  in a Syk-dependent manner. Cbl-b mediates ubiquitination of the activated CLRs through
  Syk. The ubiquitinated CLRs are then sorted into lysosomes for degradation by an
  endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system. Additionally, Cbl-b
  has been shown to target MyD88 and TRIF for degradation following phsophorylation
  by Syk. Lastly, Cbl-b potentially targets NLRP3 for degradation. (C) C. albicans
  is recognised by Dectin-1, leading to activation of NFAT and Jnk1. NFAT induces
  CD23 expression and production of nitric oxide. In the absence of Jnk1, NFAT activation,
  CD23 and nitric oxide levels are increased compared to WT cells. (D) β-glucans induce
  expression of miR-146a via a Dectin-1-Syk-NFκB pathway. MiR-146a negatively regulates
  Dectin-1 signalling by supressing NFκB activation.
