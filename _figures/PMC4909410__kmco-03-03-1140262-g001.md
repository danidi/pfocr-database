caption: Classical and non-classical functions of CHKA. The classical model involves
  ubiquitination and activation of AR-dependent transcription that results in upregulation
  of CHKA, a rate-limiting enzyme in the Kennedy pathway (production of phosphatidylcholine,
  required for plasma membrane biogenesis). In addition to its role in the Kennedy
  pathway, CHKA can also interact with the AR in the cytoplasm and promote its stability
  (non-classical model). This could lead to AR overexpression and increased AR signaling,
  which in turn may allow more CHKA production. AR,  androgen receptor; CHKA, choline
  kinase α; U, ubiquitin.
