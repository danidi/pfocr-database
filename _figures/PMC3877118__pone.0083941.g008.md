caption: 'Our data predict the following model: under conditions of basal neuronal
  activity, association of GluN2B and CaMKII links SynGAP to suppression of ERK signaling.
  ERK can activate Rheb, which, in turn, activates mTOR. Through suppression of mTOR
  function this mechanism inhibits protein synthesis and limits AMPAR contribution
  at developing cortical networks. Our data show that this signaling pathway is critical
  for developmental synaptic plasticity as translation-dependent homeostatic synaptic
  plasticity is disrupted in the absence of GluN2B or SynGAP.'
