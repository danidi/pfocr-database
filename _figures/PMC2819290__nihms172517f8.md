caption: Summary of potential mechanism by which altered OC nAChR activity may drive

  is cleaved first by ADAM10, a metaloprotease enzyme, to generate an N-term fragment
  of N-Cadherin. Following MMP cleavage, the γ-secretase/PS1 complex cleaves the C-terminal
  fragment (CTF) to release the CTF2 fragment into the cytoplasm. CTF2 has been shown
  to be proteolytically cleaved by calcium-activated calpain, but if intact can also
  bind CREB-binding protein, where the entire complex is then ubiquitinated and sent
  for proteosomal degradation. Loss of CBP via this pathway would alter CREB-associated
  transcriptional activity. In α9 nAChR subunit null mice, less calcium enters the
  hair cells as a result of loss of ACh-inducible activity (dashed lines below nAChR
  complex). This would result in a loss of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR)
  from the subsynaptic cistern, and a decrease in calpain activity. The result would
  be an accumulation of CTF2 upon the normal γ-secretase activity acting on the over
  expressed levels of N-Cadherin (thick solid arrow). Accumulated CTF2 in the null
  mice binds a greater proportion of CBP, sending it off for degradation and at the
  same time inhibiting translocation of normal levels of CBP into the nucleus. Hyperactivity
  of the α9KI channel may induce greater calpain activity as a result of excessive
  calcium signaling, resulting in a greater proportion of CTF2 degradation in adults
  before it binds to CBP. Thus, CBP levels may be higher in adults, reflecting the
  early stage innervation of the α9 nulls in which exuberant contacts were observed
  between the OC fibers and the OHCs, and potentially explaining the hyper-innervation
  demonstrated in . Dashed lines with arrows represents downregulated pathways; thin
  lines with arrows represents normally active pathways; thick lines with arrows represents
  upregulated overactive pathways; black elements represents downregulated or missing
  proteins (e.g. α9 nAChR subunit, CBP); gray elements represents upregulated proteins.

  description: Summary of potential mechanism by which altered OC nAChR activity may
    drive structural and functional changes observed in cochleae of α9 null mice.
    N-Cadherin is cleaved first by ADAM10, a metaloprotease enzyme, to generate an
    N-term fragment of N-Cadherin. Following MMP cleavage, the γ-secretase/PS1 complex
    cleaves the C-terminal fragment (CTF) to release the CTF2 fragment into the cytoplasm.
    CTF2 has been shown to be proteolytically cleaved by calcium-activated calpain,
    but if intact can also bind CREB-binding protein, where the entire complex is
    then ubiquitinated and sent for proteosomal degradation. Loss of CBP via this
    pathway would alter CREB-associated transcriptional activity. In α9 nAChR subunit
    null mice, less calcium enters the hair cells as a result of loss of ACh-inducible
    activity (dashed lines below nAChR complex). This would result in a loss of calcium-induced
    calcium release (CICR) from the subsynaptic cistern, and a decrease in calpain
    activity. The result would be an accumulation of CTF2 upon the normal γ-secretase

    Accumulated CTF2 in the null mice binds a greater proportion of CBP, sending it
