caption: Wiring diagrams of the NFκB signaling system to chart crosstalk between canonical
  and non-canonical signaling pathways. (A) Non-canonical control of RelA:p50. RelA:p50
  is inhibited by not only IκBα, -β, -ɛ, but also IκBδ. Whereas inflammatory canonical
  signals lead to degradation of IκBα, -β, -ɛ, developmental signals engage the non-canonical
  pathway to disrupt IκBδ activity; however, both result in the nuclear translocation
  of RelA:p50. Interestingly, prior canonical signaling history results in an enhancement
  of the non-canonical-RelA:p50 axis, due to inducible expression of p100. (B) Canonical
  control of RelB:p52 activation. Expression of p100 and RelB are dependent on RelA:p50
  activity and therefore canonical signals. The amount of basal RelB expression, controlled
  by constitutive canonical pathway activity, rather than the inducible p100 expression,
  is the main determinant of the strength of non-canonical signaling.

  description: Wiring diagrams of the NFκB signaling system to chart crosstalk between
    canonical and non-canonical signaling pathways. (A) Non-canonical control of RelA:p50.
    RelA:p50 is inhibited by not only IκBα, -β, -ɛ, but also IκBδ. Whereas inflammatory
    canonical signals lead to degradation of IκBα, -β, -ɛ, developmental signals engage
    the non-canonical pathway to disrupt IκBδ activity; however, both result in the
    nuclear translocation of RelA:p50. Interestingly, prior canonical signaling history
    results in an enhancement of the non-canonical-RelA:p50 axis, due to inducible
    expression of p100. (B) Canonical control of RelB:p52 activation. Expression of
    p100 and RelB are dependent on RelA:p50 activity and therefore canonical signals.
    The amount of basal RelB expression, controlled by constitutive canonical pathway
    activity, rather than the inducible p100 expression, is the main determinant of
    the strength of non-canonical signaling.
