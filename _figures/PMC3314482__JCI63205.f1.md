caption: (A) Checkpoint short circuit. Loss of control of both the G2-M and G1-S checkpoints
  through ATR/Chk1 pathway inhibition and p53 loss, respectively, leads to increased
  damage through reiterative cycles into S phase and through mitosis, ultimately resulting
  in cell death. (B) Oncogenic stress. Oncogenic stress produces an increased reliance
  on the ATR/Chk1 pathway to prevent replication fork collapse into DNA double-strand
  breaks. Synergistic increases in DNA damage following ATR/Chk1 inhibition in oncogene-transformed
  cells are generated within individual cell cycles (–).
