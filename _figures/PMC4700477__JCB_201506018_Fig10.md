caption: 'Selected potential Rho GTPase functional networks identified in the RNAi
  screen. Potential Rho GTPase signaling networks were identified using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis based on high-confidence protein–protein interactions or literature-based
  knowledge. Representative static phenotypes corresponding to the RNAi perturbations
  are shown. Each solid line represents a direct protein–protein interaction. A legend
  identifies the functions of the proteins in the network. (a) Multiple functions
  for distinct RhoA-specific GAPs. (b) Rac1-dependent effector pathway controlling
  the Arp2/3 complex. KD of these proteins all lead to a “short neurites” phenotype
  (group 1: clusters 1, 3, and 4). (c) Potential regulation of Rac1 by multiple Rac1-specific
  GEFs. (d) Potential Rho GTPase signaling networks regulating myosin light chain.
  All phenotypes correspond to a “long and unbranched neurites” phenotype (group 4
  clusters 11 or 12).'
