caption: Overview of Wnt signaling pathways. Wnts signal through Frizzled receptors
  that can form a complex with Lrp-5/6 receptors. With the exception of the FNI pathway,
  these signaling pathways activate the scaffolding protein Dishevelled (Dvl). The
  different pathways diverge downstream from Dvl. (A) In the canonical pathway, Dvl
  disrupts the “destruction complex” composed of Axin, Adenomatous Polyposis Coli
  (APC), and Gsk3β. This prevents the phosphorylation of β-catenin by Gsk3β, which
  leads to its stabilization and subsequent nuclear import. In the nucleus, β-catenin
  associates with the transcription factor T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor
  1 (TCF/Lef1) and regulates gene expression. The secreted proteins Dickkopf1 (Dkk1)
  and secreted Frizzled-related protein (Sfrp) inhibit this pathway. (B) Following
  Wnt activation of the divergent canonical pathway, Dvl inhibits Gsk3β, which leads
  to the decreased phosphorylation of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs), such
  as Tau, MAP-1B, MAP-2, or the related Drosophila protein Futsch. (C) In the planar
  cell polarity pathway, Dvl activates the small Rho GTPases RhoA and Rac1, and c-Jun–amino-terminal
  kinase (Jnk), which leads to the regulation of actin and microtubule cytoskeletons.
  (D) In the Wnt calcium pathway, Dvl activation leads to a rapid increase in intracellular
  calcium levels and subsequent activation of calcium-sensitive enzymes such as protein
  kinase C (PKC), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and the
  Ca2+-activated phosphatase calcineurin (Cn). Calcineurin directly binds to and dephosphorylates
  nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), which, in turn, allows their nuclear
  translocation where they regulate gene expression. (E) In the Frizzled nuclear import
  pathway (FNI), Wnt binding to Frizzled-2 (DFz2) leads to its endocytosis and Grip-dependent
  trafficking to the periphery of the nucleus. Here the carboxyl terminus of DFz2
  is cleaved and imported. In Drosophila, DFz2-C organizes ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
  particles containing specific transcripts, which then egress from the nucleus and
  are likely translated in the cytoplasm. A similar nuclear import pathway has also
  been described for the atypical Ryk receptor during cortical neurogenesis ().
