caption: The IL-18 signaling pathway. IL-18 is stored intracellularly as biologically
  inactive pro-IL-18 and is secreted extracellularly as the bioactive mature molecule
  after being cleaved by caspase-1. IL-18 is regulated by the endogenous inhibitor
  IL-18BP. Since IL-18BP has high affinity for IL-18, IL-18BP binds preferentially
  to IL-18 and inhibits binding to the IL-18R. IL-18 first binds to the IL-18Rα; however,
  this binding is low-affinity, and the IL-18Rβ chain is recruited to form a high-affinity
  heterodimeric complex. The activation of IL-18R recruits MyD88 to the TIR domain
  and anchors IRAK. Phosphorylated IRAK activates TRAF6, and which in turn phosphorylates
  NIK. This is followed by the activation of IKK and finally NF-κB, which initiates
  the transcription of target genes such as IFN-γ.
