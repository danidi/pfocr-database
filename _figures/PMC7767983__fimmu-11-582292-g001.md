caption: Antibody production by B cells and antibody-mediated immune response in CHB
  infection. B cells can produce antibodies, such as anti-HBs, anti-HBc and self-antibodies,
  and subsequently mediate an antiviral immune response or self-reaction via various
  potential mechanisms in CHB infection. (1) Anti-HBs antibodies bind to HBsAg to
  block viral entry and replication; (2) anti-HBs antibodies bind HBsAg and induce
  cellular phagocytosis of Kupffer cells to consume HBV (ADCP); (3) anti-HBs antibodies
  bind HBsAg and induce the release of perforin/granzyme in NK cells to eliminate
  HBV-infected hepatocytes (ADCC); (4) anti-HBs antibodies participate in forming
  immune complexes and bind to dendritic cells to induce a T cell response; (5) anti-HBc
  IgG binds HBcAg to induce hepatocyte lysis via the classical complement activation
  pathway initiating from C1 (CDC); (6) self-antibodies participate in an autoimmune
  reaction to aggravate liver inflammation. ADCC, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity;
  ADCP, antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis; CDC, compliment-dependent cytotoxicity.
