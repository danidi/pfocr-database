caption: 'Control of osteoclast differentiation by the RANK/RANKL/OPG signal pathway.
  RANKL is formed by osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells and binds to the RANK
  receptor on osteoclast precursor cells (CFU-M: colony forming unit-macrophage) and
  mature osteoclasts. This interaction promotes the differentiation and activation
  of osteoclasts. OPG is also formed by bone marrow stromal cells as well as osteoblasts
  and neutralises RANKL. OPG therefore has an inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation
  and activation. The ratio between RANKL and OPG determines whether bone-forming
  or bone-removing processes dominate (based on ).'
