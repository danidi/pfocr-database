caption: 'RasGRF2 as an effector of AnxA6-mediated TNBC cell growth and motility.
  AnxA6 is a predominantly cytosolic protein but upon an increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ levels, it translocates to the plasma membrane where it influences the stability
  of cell surface receptors, e.g., EGFR and the activity of certain Ca2+ channels
  presumably in membrane lipid rafts. In AnxA6 expressing TNBC cells (left panel),
  prolonged activation of EGFR leads to a sustained increase in store-operated Ca2+
  entry (SOCE) and activation, followed by subsequent degradation of RasGRF2. The
  resulting decrease in cellular RasGRF2 levels enhances the activation of Cdc42 which
  inhibits the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl and leads to the stabilization of activated
  EGFR on the cell surface. The activation of Cdc42 also sustains persistent cell
  motility. In AnxA6-low TNBC cells (right panel), activation of EGFR is not affected
  but the activated EGFR (pY-EGFR) is short-lived on the cell surface and therefore,
  the EGFR signal output is transient. This leads to reduced SOCE, stabilization of
  RasGRF2 levels and its interaction of Cdc42 GEFs, thereby inhibiting the activity
  of Cdc42. Reduced activity of Cdc42 enhances the activity of c-Cbl, subsequent ubiquitination
  of activated EGFR, internalization and degradation by proteasomes. The stabilization
  of RasGRF2 promotes the activation of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway and enhances cell
  growth. Abbreviations: AnxA6, annexin A6; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; pY-EGFR, activated EGFR (Tyr-1068); Ras
  guanine nucleotide releasing factor 2, RasGRF2, SOCE, store-operated Ca2+ entry;
  TNBC, triple-negative breast cancer; Ras/MAP, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase.'
