caption: Schema of signaling pathway involved in HSP60-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation and subsequent IL-1β production. IL-1β induces its own production by
  the activated microglia in a HSP60-dependent manner. HSP60, after being upregulated
  by IL-1β, gets secreted outside and binds with TLR4 of the microglia to activate
  p38 MAPK []. Binding of HSP60 with TLR4 facilitates NF-κB phosphorylation, mitochondrial
  damage, and ROS generation and finally activates NLRP3 inflammasome leading to IL-1β
  production. JEV also augments HSP60 production and thus influences inflammasome
  complex to induce a consecutive expression of IL-1β and, in turn, induces an exaggerated
  immune response
