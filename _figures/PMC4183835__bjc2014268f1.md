caption: 'Conversion from DHEA to DHT requires 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3βHSD),
  steroid-5α-reductase (SRD5A), and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17βHSD) isoenzymes.
  The initial rate-limiting reaction converts the 3β-hydroxyl group to a 3-keto moiety
  and isomerises the Δ5 to a Δ4 structure, which is catalysed by 3βHSD and produces
  AD as an intermediate metabolite. In the conversion of AD to DHT, metabolic flux
  can occur either through AD→T→DHT (the conventional pathway, shown in red) or AD→5α-dione→DHT
  (the 5α-dione pathway, shown in blue). The 5α-dione pathway is the major pathway
  utilised for DHT synthesis from adrenal precursors in CRPC. Abbreviations: 3αHSD,
  3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; AD, Δ4-androstenedione; A5diol, Δ5-androstene-3β,17β-diol.'
