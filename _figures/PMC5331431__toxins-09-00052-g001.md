caption: 'Conversion pathway of tyrosine and phenylalanine into p-cresyl sulfate.
  Full arrows: process through bacterial fermentation; dotted arrows: process through
  enzymatic reactions of the host; EC: enzyme commission number. l-tyrosine, derived
  from diet and endogenous proteins and peptides, can be converted to phenol and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.
  Tyrosine phenol-lyase (EC 4.1.99.2.), previously named β–tyrosinase, is responsible
  for the reversible deamination of l-tyrosine, requiring pyridoxyl phosphate as a
  cofactor, into phenol ammonia and pyruvate [,,]. This reaction is also reversible
  by the same enzyme using l-serine and phenol as substrates []. In addition, the
  reversible reaction of l-tyrosine with 2-oxoglutarate in 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate
  and L-glutamate is catalysed by tyrosine transaminase (EC 2.6.1.5.) or by aromatic-amino-acid
  transaminase (EC 2.6.1.57.) [,,]. To a small extent, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and
  ammonia can also be formed by the enzyme phenylalanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.20.)
  from l-tyrosine []. 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate is the precursor of 4-hydroxyphenylacetate,
  catalysed by p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate oxidase (EC 1.2.3.13.) [,], and can subsequently
  lead to the formation of p-cresol by p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.83.)
  [,]. In the gut mucosa and in the liver, the majority of p-cresol will be conjugated
  into the uremic toxin p-cresyl sulfate by aryl sulfotransferases (EC 2.8.2.1.) []
  and a small fraction will be metabolized to p-cresyl glucuronide by UDP-glucuronyltransferases
  (EC 2.4.1.17.) []. Another aromatic amino acid, phenylalanine, also plays a role
  in the production of p-cresyl sulfate through the hydroxylation reaction to tyrosine
  by phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, also referred as phenylalanine hydroxylase (EC
  1.14.16.1.) []. This metabolic process is carried out by bacteria as well by liver
  cells, transforming excess diet phenylalanine to tyrosine []. In addition, phenylalanine
  is converted into 3-phenylpyruvate by either phenylalanine dehydrogenase (EC 1.4.1.20.)
  [,], branched-chain-amino-acid transaminase (EC 2.6.1.42.) [] or by aromatic-amino-acid
  transaminase (EC 2.6.1.57.) []. Then 3-phenylpyruvate can be transformed in 3-phenylacetaldehyde
  by phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.43.) [] or in 3-phenyllactate by l-lactate
  dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27.) []. Finally, 3-phenylacetaldehyde can be converted
  to 3-phenylacetate by phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.39.) [,]. All of
  these reactions of the phenylalanine metabolic pathway are reversible, which can
  lead, in the end, to p-cresyl sulfate generation.'
