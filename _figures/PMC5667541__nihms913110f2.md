caption: a | O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) may achieve some level of substrate specificity
  through its amino-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. Individually or
  in combination, TPRs could facilitate substrate recognition by generating unique
  binding sites that, when occupied, induce a conformational change that permits substrate
  access to the active site. TPRs 1–6 are required for OGT binding to Sin3a and TPRs
  5–6 are required for OGT binding to ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2), though TPRs
  9–12 may also be involved. CDI and II, catalytic domains I and II; PPO, phosphoinositide-binding
  domain; UDP-GlcNAc, uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine. b | OGT substrate recognition
  may be additionally mediated by a hierarchy of highly conserved adaptor proteins,
  each responsible for recognizing and recruiting specific substrates to OGT in a
  context-dependent manner. For instance, in each of three different nutrient conditions
  (glucose deprivation, fasting, high glucose), OGT is recruited by a specific adaptor
  protein (p38, HCF-1, OGA) to O-GlcNAcylate a specific substrate (NF-H, PGC-1α, PKM2),
  leading to regulation of key downstream cellular pathways (NF-H solubility, gluconeogenic
  gene expression, aerobic glycolysis). HCF-1, host cell factor C1; OGA, O-GlcNAcase;
  NF-H, heavy neurofilament polypeptide; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha; PKM2, pyruvate kinase isoform M2. c | Accumulation
  of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum during cellular stress activates
  the unfolded protein response, which upregulates hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  (HBP) gene expression via the transcription factor spliced X-box binding protein
  1 (Xbp1s). Increased production of UDP-GlcNAc by the HBP may lead to non-specific
  O-GlcNAcylation of unfolded proteins in the cytoplasm. O-GlcNAcylation of unfolded
  proteins may block their aggregation and proteasomal degradation as well as facilitate
  their re-folding by chaperones with O-GlcNAc-directed lectin activity (e.g. 70 kDa
  heat shock protein, Hsp70).
