caption: 'GENSOR units. (A) The general GENSOR unit concept includes four components:
  (i) signal, (ii) signal transduction (shown in blue), (iii) a genetic switch (shown
  in yellow), and (iv) the response (shown in green). The concept can be applied to
  any regulator that produces a genetic switch. (B) The BetI GENSOR unit. This is
  an example of a GENSOR unit based on a bacterial TF; color coding for components
  is as depicted for panel (A). Signal transduction involves transport of choline
  through the membrane, a genetic switch causes the repression of two transcription
  units, betT and betIBA, and the response involves the transformation of choline
  into glycine betaine. From the higher perspective provided, it is possible to infer
  that mechanistically in presence of choline, BetI will cease to repress the necessary
  enzymes for its transport and transformation into glycine betaine. Physiologically,
  BetI negatively regulates the expression of genes involved in the response to osmotic
  stress in the absence of choline. The presence of choline induces the expression
  of the genes required for transport and conversion of choline to glycine betaine,
  an osmoprotectant. (C) Pathways involved in production of L-tryptophan from D-erythrose-4P.
  The 3-dehydroquinate biosynthesis I pathway is shown in red; the chorismate biosynthesis
  from 3-dehydroquinate pathway is shown in purple; the L-tryptophan biosynthesis
  pathway is shown in orange. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are shown beside the
  reactions. Enzymes regulated by TrpR are shown in green. (D) In the TrpR GENSOR
  unit, the three reactions catalyzed by AroB, AroD, and AroE are summarized in one
  secondary reaction without indication of the involved enzymes or intermediate metabolites.
  Another secondary reaction includes reactions catalyzed by AroA and AroC.'
