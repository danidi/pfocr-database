caption: Possible dual role of actin cytoskeleton in plant response to pathogens.
  (a) The widely-published scenario in which depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton
  by treatment with latrunculin B or cytochalasin E leads to increased plant vulnerability
  to pathogens. Studies showing this phenomenon co-inoculated plants with a drug and
  pathogen. (b) The new alternative scenario for the role of the actin cytoskeleton
  proposed in this manuscript. Plants pretreated with latrunculin B or cytochalasin
  E before inoculation with a pathogen have time to activate the salicylic acid signalling
  pathway, resulting in increased resistance to the subsequently inoculated pathogens.
  latB = latrunculin B; cytE = cytochalasin E; SA = salicylic acid; ICS1 = isochorismate
  synthase 1; = fungi;  = bacteria.
