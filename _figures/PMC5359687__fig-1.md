caption: Core metabolic pathways and enzymes in cancer cells. Here are schematically
  represented the main metabolic pathways altered in cancers, including the glycolysis,
  the PPP, the serine pathway, the fatty acid synthesis, and the TCA cycle. In cancer
  cells, the canonical energy metabolism pathways are often truncated (glycolysis,
  TCA cycle) or redirected (glutaminolysis or serine and lipid biosynthesis). Briefly,
  glucose enters into cancer cells through glucose transporters and is phosphorylated
  to G6P by an irreversible reaction catalyzed by the hexokinase. G6P either proceeds
  through glycolysis to produce pyruvate or through the PPP to generate ribose-5-phosphate
  and NADPH. The PPP is connected at the first step of glycolysis starting with G6P
  dehydrogenase (G6PD) and has both an oxidative and nonoxidative arm. G6P oxidation
  produces the reducing equivalents, in the form of NADPH, important cellular antioxidant,
  and cofactor for fatty acid biosynthesis. Moreover, the PPP provides cancer cells
  with pentose sugars for the biosynthesis of nucleic acids. The first enzymes involved
  in the nonoxidative arm of the PPP are TKT and TA. Ribose-5-phosphate and xylulose-5-phosphate,
  generated by the oxidative PPP, can be further metabolized into F6P and G3P to reenter
  into glycolysis for ATP production, depending on the cell requirement. Thus, the
  PPP plays a key role in cancer cells to supply their anabolic demands and to counteract
  oxidative stress. The serine pathway is branched to glycolysis via 3-phosphoglycerate
  (3PG), which is converted by PHGDH into phosphohydroxypyruvate (P-PYR). This pathway
  produces serine and glycine, essential precursors for synthesis of proteins and
  nucleic acids through the folate cycle. Following glycolysis, pyruvate is either
  converted into lactate by LDHA and released through monocarboxylate transporters,
  MCT4 and MCT1, further causing extra cellular acidification, or converted into acetyl-CoA,
  through the PDH complex. Acetyl-CoA enters into TCA cycle and produces ATP, NADH,
  and FADH2 molecules. Reduced cofactors are then oxidized by the ETC complexes for
  ATP production. Glutamine and other amino acids can also replenish the TCA cycle.
  Indeed, the first step of glutaminolysis is the conversion of glutamine into glutamate
  by the GLS. Glutamate is subsequently converted into alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG) that
  fuels back the TCA cycle. Fatty acid degradation can also supply the TCA cycle through
  beta-oxidation, which produces acetyl-CoA. Reciprocally, citrate, a TCA cycle intermediate,
  can be used as a precursor for fatty acid synthesis and for NADPH production through
  the ACL. Citrate is subsequently converted to acetyl-CoA and OAA into the cytoplasm.
  Acetyl-CoA is used for fatty acid synthesis through its conversion to malonyl-CoA
  by ACC and to palmitic acid by the FASN. OAA is converted to malate, which is then
  decarboxylated into pyruvate, by the ME1 and produces NADPH. Mitochondria are represented
