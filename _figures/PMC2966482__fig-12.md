caption: Schematic signal transduction pathways underlying the interfunctional role
  of CO, NO, and H2S in the modulation of cell survival. NO exerts neuroprotection
  through stimulation of the sGC/cGMP/PKG system as well as through S-nitrosylation.
  As a consequence of S-nitrosylating reactions, inhibition of NFκB and caspase-3
  activity and a decrease in cell death occur. NO-mediated transcriptional activation
  of the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway, associated with activation of KCa++ channel and inhibition
  of mitochondrial energy transductions at level of complex IV (Cox), activates mitochondrial-dependent
  H2O2-mediated redox signaling, leading to upregulation of pro-survival mechanisms,
  such as vitagenes HO-1 and heat shock protein 70, Bcl2, and mitochondrial biogenesis.
  The latter results from activation of coactivator PGC-1α and mtTFA. CO-mediated
  activation of mitochondrial redox signaling results in antiinflammatory, antiproliferative,
  and antiapoptotic effects, which confer neuroprotection. This occurs through activation
  of multiple pathways, including PPARγ, PGC-1α, and mtTFA, which induce mitochondrial
  biogenesis; P38 MAPK, HIF1α, KCa++ channel, PI3K-Akt, and Nrf2, as well as inhibition
  of ERK-1/2. H2S is a highly reactive, strong reducing molecule that easily reacts
  with ROS and RNS, thus providing antioxidant activity and, in addition, activates
  ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Known cellular targets of H2S include cytochrome
  c oxidase (complex IV, Cox) and carbonic anhydrase (CA). This gas H2S has also been
  demonstrated to regulate cellular signal transduction pathways, including thioredoxin
  reductase, HO-1, and glutamyl-cysteine synthetase, resulting in cytoprotection.
  KATP, ATP-dependent K+; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase.
