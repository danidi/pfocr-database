caption: Sex determination within individual XY supporting cells depends on the level
  of Sox9 expression.A. The complexity of Sox9 regulation points to its importance
  as the conserved regulatory hub of the male differentiation pathway. Sox9 is expressed
  at basal levels early in both XY and XX gonads. 1) A pulse of Sry expression activates
  the initial upregulation of Sox9 in XY somatic supporting cell precursors. Sox9
  may or may not be involved in extinguishing Sry expression. 2) Following the initial
  activation by SRY, SOX9 is able to bind its own promoter with higher affinity than
  SRY and act in an autoregulatory feedforward loop. 3) Intercellular Prostaglandin
  D2 (PGD2) and FGF9 signaling pathways act as independent feedforward loops to amplify
  Sox9 expression downstream of Sry-mediated activation. 4) Many other genes are likely
  to directly or indirectly regulate Sox9 expression or function, including unidentified
  genes underlying expression QTLs on mouse Chromosomes 1, 5, 6, and 11. 5) Multiple
  genes associated with the female differentiation pathway, including Wnt4/Rspo1/β-catenin,
  Foxl2 (forkhead box L2), and the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ, are likely to repress
  Sox9 expression to canalize the female pathway. It is important to note that one
  or more of the genes underlying the Sox9 eQTLs could influence Sox9 expression indirectly
  by activating or repressing female pathway genes.B. Within individual gonad supporting
  cells, sexual fate is likely to be a binary decision. The intracellular concentration
  of SOX9 most likely must reach a critical threshold (denoted by a red dotted line)
  relative to the underlying setpoint of the network before E11.5 to impose a male-specific
  state on the transcription network. Cells that fail to express SOX9 above this threshold
  adopt the alternative female-specific network state.
