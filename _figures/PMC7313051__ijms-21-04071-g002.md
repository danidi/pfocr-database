caption: 'The graphical summary of biological factors influencing anti-tumor immune
  response constituting three categories depending on anatomical level: tumor cell,
  tumor microenvironment, and the whole body. Melanoma cells influence anti-tumor
  response passively (through the number of mutations and neoantigens) and actively
  (by regulating some key signaling pathways). The unresponsive cell (right part of
  the schematic cell) is characterized by a low tumor mutational burden (TMB), low
  expression of neoantigens, HLA molecules, and PD-L1 ligand (indicated with downward
  arrows) as well as activated β-catenin and PI3K/AKT pathways and a suppressed IFNγ
  pathway (indicated with upward and downward arrows, respectively). Deregulation
  of these pathways results in the secretion of specific cytokines (e.g., VEGF, IL-10,
  TGF-β). They induce immunosuppressive topography of the immune cells within the
  tumor, which is characterized by a low density of the cytotoxic immune cells and
  the predominance of the immunosuppressive cells (Tregs, MDSC) (the right part of
  the schematic tumor). On the whole body level, the response of melanoma to immunotherapy
  is modulated by the specific gut microflora, constellation of peripheral immune
  cells, and inherent genetic variants of some important proteins e.g., HLA. The response
  of the tumor to the immune checkpoints inhibitors as well as the success of the
  immunotherapy depends on all those biological factors.'
