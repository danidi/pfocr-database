caption: A. Hotair promoted angiogenesis through directly activating the transcription
  of angiogenic factor VEGFA as well as through GRP78-mediated upregulation of VEGFA
  and Ang2 expression. B. AFAP1-AS1 inhibits AFAP1 protein expression and affected
  the expression of several small GTPase family members and molecules in the actin
  cytokeratin signaling pathway. promoted cancer cell metastasis via regulation of
  actin filament integrity. C. XIST functioned as an oncogene in NPC through up-regulating
  E2F3 in part through ‘spongeing’ miR-34a-5p. D. H19 Inhibits E-cadherin expression
  and promoted invasion via the mir-630/EZH2 pathway. E. MALAT1 regulates CSC activity
  and radioresistance by modulating mir-1/slug axis. F. NEAT1 regulates EMT phenotype
  and radioresistance by modulatin themir-204/ZEB1 axis.
