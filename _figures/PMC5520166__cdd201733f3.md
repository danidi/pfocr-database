caption: The regulatory role of ubiquitin on RIP1 and RIP3-dependent cell death. Inhibition
  of transcription or translation can divert TNF-mediated signaling to the formation
  of an intracellular complex II consisting of TRADD, FADD and caspase-8 in a RIP1-independent
  apoptotic cell death. This cell death pathway can be promoted by A20 and CYLD that
  deubiquitinate complex I components and thereby support the switch to complex II.
  A TNF-induced RIP1-dependent apoptotic cell death occurs in IAP-depleted (by IAP
  antagonist or KO) or LUBAC-deficient conditions leading to the assembly complex
  II consisting of RIP1, FADD and caspase-8. Activation of RIP1-dependent cell death
  under caspase-8 inhibited or deficient conditions can lead to a necroptotic form
  of cell death that is mediated by RIP1 and RIP3 and results in the activation of
  MLKL. Recent studies showed various polyubiquitin chains on components of necrosome
  that are potentially needed for proper formation and function of necrosome

  description: The regulatory role of ubiquitin on RIP1 and RIP3-dependent cell death.
    Inhibition of transcription or translation can divert TNF-mediated signaling to
    the formation of an intracellular complex II consisting of TRADD, FADD and caspase-8
    in a RIP1-independent apoptotic cell death. This cell death pathway can be promoted
    by A20 and CYLD that deubiquitinate complex I components and thereby support the

    in IAP-depleted (by IAP antagonist or KO) or LUBAC-deficient conditions leading
    to the assembly complex II consisting of RIP1, FADD and caspase-8. Activation
    of RIP1-dependent cell death under caspase-8 inhibited or deficient conditions
    can lead to a necroptotic form of cell death that is mediated by RIP1 and RIP3
    and results in the activation of MLKL. Recent studies showed various polyubiquitin
