caption: 'Schematic representation of the outlined hypothesis. High-glucose PDS upregulated
  the expression of α-SMA and collagen I, and rapamycin significantly inhibited high-glucose
  PDS-induced ECM accumulation in the peritoneum, which manifested as decreased expression
  levels of α-SMA and collagen I. These effects correlated with a decrease in the
  LDLr-mediated lipid influx mechanism, which was mediated through downregulation
  of SREBP-2 and SCAP expression levels, as well as an increase in the ABCA1-mediated
  lipid efflux pathway, which was mediated through the upregulation of LXRα and PPARα
  expression levels. Overall, rapamycin showed an obvious protective effect against
  high-glucose PDS-induced PF, which was partly due to restoration of lipid homeostasis
  in PMCs. Abbreviations: α-SMA, alpha-smooth muscle actin; LDLr, low density lipoprotein
  receptor; SREBP-2, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2; SCAP, SREBP cleavage
  activating protein; ABCA1, adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter A1;
  LXRα, liver X receptor alpha; PPARα, peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor
  alpha.'
