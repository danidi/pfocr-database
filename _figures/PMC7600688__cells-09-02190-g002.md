caption: JNK’s scaffold protein JIP-1. JIP-1 is a crucial regulator of the JNK signaling
  pathway. It links multiple MAPK members, tethering them together and accelerating
  the reaction cascade. JIP-1 regulates signal transduction and helps localize pathway
  in components of the cell such as the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm, the nucleus,
  the Golgi and in neurons in the pre- and post-synaptic elements.
