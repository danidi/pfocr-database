caption: This model is based largely on findings in zebrafish, plus Foxc1/2 and COUP-TFII
  results in mice (noted by dashed arrows). Shh, expressed in the notochord and hypochord
  (on top), induces VEGF expression in nearby somites. By a process yet to be fully
  determined, VEGF activates the PLCγ-ERK/MAPK pathway only in the dorsal angioblasts
  (pink circle), which will develop into aortic endothelial cells. ERK activation
  results in Notch activation (indicated by Notch and Dll4 expression) via the transcriptional
  factors Foxc1/2. Notch signaling induces arterial differentiation (indicated by
  the arterial marker EphrinB2 expression). In the arterial progenitor cells, Grl,
  induced by Foxc1/2, blocks venous differentiation (indicated by the venous marker
  EphB4 expression. In the ventral angioblasts (blue circle), VEGF activates the PI3K/AKT
  pathway, which inhibits the PLCγ-ERK/MAPK pathway, possibly by a direct inhibition
  of Raf by AKT. AKT signaling is hypothesized to induce expression of COUP-TFII,
  which blocks arterial differentiation (also EphrinB2 expression). In this model,
  a gradient of VEGF along the dorsal-ventral axis is postulated to govern whether
  VEGF receptor activates PI3K or ERK signaling. For simplicity, the artery-vein specification
  is depicted here as occurring following the midline convergence of endothelial progenitors,
  but evidence suggests that this occurs earlier in zebrafish embryos. Schematic figure
  is based on discussions presented in Lamont and Childs.
