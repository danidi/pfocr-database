caption: A model for regulatory control of stem cells at the shoot meristem is shown.
  We propose WUS and PHB/PHV/CNA antagonistically control meristem development. Speculation
  that either REV or an unknown factor (X) drives meristem development in the absence
  of WUS and PHB/PHV/CNA is also shown.
