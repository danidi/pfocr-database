caption: 'Schematic representation of mutp53 aggregation and reactivation by mutp53
  reactivators. The amyloidogenic property of p53 not only demonstrates its significant
  role in cancer but also provides the basis for a prevention/reversal strategy. Mutp53
  are more easily unfolded and misfolded than wild‐type (WT) p53 due to their highly
  unstable nature, promoting self‐aggregation or aggregation with other proteins.
  Unfolded and misfolded p53 lack tumour suppressor activity. The aggregation process
  is involved in the mechanisms of GOF. Two strategies that interfere with this process
  are described: (a) inhibition of mutp53 unfolding/misfolding and (b) inhibition
  of misfolded p53 aggregation. Reactivators of p53 guided by these strategies can
  restore mutp53 function or block the gain of function (GOF) pathway that tumour
  cells are adapted to, causing cell death and proliferation arrest, thus leading
  to tumour regression'
