caption: The corrinoid methyl transferases are labeled in red. Red arrows indicate
  pathways, not shown in detail, that also involve corrinoid proteins. The boxed reactions
  are not part of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway but are unique to methanogens. R′ is
  tetrahydrofolate or a tetrahydropterin analogue of tetrahydrofolate. The charge
  on the nickel that serves as the methyl acceptor on acylCoA synthase/decarbonylase
  is shown as +1, but whether it is Ni+1 or Ni0 rremains a matter for debate , .
