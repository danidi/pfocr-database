caption: Major components of the PI3K pathway in B cells discussed in this review.
  PI3K pathway activation via B cell antigen receptor is depicted schematically. Lyn
  and Syk are recruited to the engaged BCR where they are activated by phosphorylation
  and initiate the downstream signaling cascade. Class I PI3K such as p110δ or p110α
  binds phosphorylated CD19 and catalyzes the production of PIP3. Alternative PI3K
  recruitment mechanisms not shown include binding to BCAP, TC21, or IRS-2/IL-4R.
  Several PH domain-containing signaling proteins bind to PIP3 including enzymes such
  as Btk and Akt and adaptor proteins such as Bam32. PIP3 levels are down-regulated
  by phosphatases PTEN and SHIP. PTEN directly opposes the PI3K reaction while SHIP,
  classically activated downstream of FcγRIIB co-aggregation with the BCR, produces
  a novel second messenger PI(3,4)P2 which can recruit its own set of PH domain proteins.
  Recruited PI-binding proteins are enzymatically activated and/or serve to form membrane-associated
  protein complexes that regulate downstream signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangement.
