caption: Mechanism of GPCR agonism bias towards insulin receptor activation. Bradykinin
  and angiotensin II are complexed with the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR), IRβ, and
  Neu-1. Bradykinin and angiotensin II preferentially lead to insulin receptor signaling
  by first forming a complex with NMBR (1). This heterodimerization leads Gα, β, and
  γ (2) to activate MMP-9 (3). Upon activation, MMP-9 removes EBP (4), which in turn
  activates Neu-1 (5). Crosstalk between these activated components leads to the phosphorylation
  and subsequent activation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) (6), initiating
  the phosphoinositide 3-kinase - protein kinase B (PI3K-AKT) pathway, in addition
  to others, without the presence of insulin. Taken in part from Haxho et al [] ©
