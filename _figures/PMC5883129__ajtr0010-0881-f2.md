caption: Ubiquitination plays a central role in the activation of NEMO and IκB by
  multiple signaling pathways, including those emanating from Toll-like receptors
  (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). In TLRs-mediated
  signaling, TLR4 promotes the gathering of MyD88, leading to activation of NF-κB
  and the production of pro-inflammation cytokines. In NOD2-mediated signaling, NALP3
  protein promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP2, thus allowing the degradation
  of the IκB and NEMO to enable translocation of NF-κB proteins p50 and RelA to the
  nucleus, whose kinase activation stimulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines.
  RIG-I signaling pathways are regulated by TRAF6, which promote K63-linked polyubiquitination
  on TRAF6 and RIG-I to stimulate NEMO gathering.
