caption: Protein Sorting as a Key Mechanism in Alzheimer's Cell Biology, (A) Aβ (red
  bar) is liberated from its parent protein, APP (multicolor bar), in two enzymatic
  steps. In the first β-cleavage step, BACE (blue bar) splits full-length APP into
  an sAPPβ fragment (brown bar) and a C-terminal fragment (CTFβ, red/green bar). Then,
  in the γ-cleavage step, the γ-secretase (star) splits CTFβ into Aβ (red bar) and
  amyloid intracellular domain (AICD, green bar). β-cleavage is the committed step
  in APP processing and may be upregulated in late-onset Alzheimer's disease.(B) Both
  APP (red bar) and BACE (blue bar) are type-I transmembrane proteins that are sorted
  through multiple membranous compartments of the cell. The sorting triangle that
  interconnects the trans-Golgi network (TGN), cell surface, and the endosome is critically
  important for APP and BACE sorting. As indicated, clathrin is the coat complex that
  regulates transport from the cell surface and the TGN to the endosome, while the
  retromer is the coat complex that regulates transport from the endosome back to
  the TGN. A convergence of findings suggests that APP and BACE are most likely to
  interact within the membranes of the endosomal system, initiating the potentially
  amyloidogenic pathway.
