caption: Demonstrate the overview of ethylene biosynthesis and role of ACC deaminase-producing
  bacteria in the stress condiction. The enzyme SAM-synthetase (SAMS) convert amino
  acid methionine to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM). Then ACC synthase (ACS) convert
  SAM into ACC, in this reaction 5′methylthioadenosine (MTA) is also produced, which
  is recycled back to methionine, this multi-step pathway is also known as the Yang
  cycle. ACC oxidase convert ACC to ethylene in the presence of oxygen. Besides, ACC
  can be conjugated to M-ACC, JA-ACC, G-ACC by the action of their respective enzymes.
  Plant response to waterlogged condition and produce excess amount of ACC. ACC deaminase–producing
  bacteria catabolize the exuded ACC into ammonia and alpha-ketobutyrate and mitigate
  the adverse effects of waterlogging stress on the plant.
