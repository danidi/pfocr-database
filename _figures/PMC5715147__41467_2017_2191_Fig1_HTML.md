caption: 'Schematic of albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes for efficient vaccine delivery
  and combination cancer immunotherapy. a Upper: structure of HSA (PDB ID: 2BXH) and
  chemical structure of MEB; lower: schematic structure of albumin/MEB nanocomplexes
  (left) and 3D molecular structure predicted by molecular docking (right). Sticks
  represent MEB and the amino acid residues in the binding site I of HSA. Green dashed
  lines represent hydrogen bonds between MEB and amino acids. b Working mechanism
  of albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes as potent T cell vaccines. Left box: modular structures
  of AlbiCpG and albumin-binding Ag (AlbiAg). AlbiCpG were engineered by site specifically
  conjugating MEB and thiol-modified CpG, with hexaethyloxy-glycol (HEG) as tunable
  linkers; AlbiAg was synthesized by conjugating MEB and cysteine-modified Ags, including
  TAA and tumor-specific neoantigen discovered via exome sequencing. Left lower: locally
  administered AlbiVax binds to endogenous albumin and assembles into albumin/AlbiVax
  nanocomplexes, which were efficiently delivered to LNs due to lymphatic drainage
  and prolonged retention in LNs. Right: harnessing the endocytosis pathway of albumin,
  albumin/AlbiCpG and albumin/AlbiAg nanocomplexes were co-delivered into APCs and
  activated APCs for antigen cross presentation and clonal expansion of antigen-specific
  CD8+ CTLs, thereby eliciting robust and durable antitumor immunity. While albumin/AlbiVax
  nanocomplexes upregulated the expression of PD-1 on these CD8+ CTLs, combination
  of albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes with anti-PD-1 dramatically enhanced immunotherapeutic
  efficacy in established primary and metastatic tumors. The pharmacological behaviors
  of albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes were studied by quantitative PET imaging, light
  sheet fluorescence microscopy in whole cleared tissue, and super-resolution imaging
  in single APCs'
