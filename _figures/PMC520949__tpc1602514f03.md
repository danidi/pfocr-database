caption: Differentially Expressed Genes Modeled onto the Biosynthetic Pathway Leading
  to the Production of Phytoalexins and Lignins.Genes identified differentially expressed
  in the comparison of compatible and incompatible interactions are designated in
  boxes. Seven highly significant genes are putatively involved in the last steps
  of shikimate pathway leading to the synthesis of defense-related compounds.
