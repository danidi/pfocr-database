caption: During cerebellar development, Purkinje cells secrete Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)
  and other mitogens that stimulate the granule cells to proliferate. RORα is a transcription
  factor that upregulates Shh gene expression. Shh binds to the Patched receptor (Ptch1)
  on the surface of granule cells. This relieves Ptch1-mediated inhibition of Smoothened
  (Smo). Smo signaling leads to activation of Gli2 as a transcription factor and thus
  expression of genes encoding transcription factors (such as Gli1) and proteins needed
  for cell proliferation (such as Cyclin D1), among others. Atoh1 is a transcription
  factor expressed in immature granule cells that regulates basal gene expression
  of Gli2. This contributes to the sensitivity to proliferative signals coming from
  Purkinje cells.
