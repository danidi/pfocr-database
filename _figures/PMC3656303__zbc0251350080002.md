caption: Isotopomers of the glycerol moiety of acylglycerols from [U-13C3]pyruvate
  metabolized through the citric acid cycle. A, the entry of [U-13C3]pyruvate through
  pyruvate carboxylase (PC) results in [1,2,3-13C3]oxaloacetate (OAA), which equilibrates
  in the symmetric fumarate (Fum) pool, producing both [1,2,3-13C3]oxaloacetate and
  [2,3,4-13C3]oxaloacetate. These two isotopomers can be converted to the [U-13C3]glycerol,
  [1,2-13C2]glycerol, and [2,3-13C2]glycerol moieties of acylglycerols in liver through
  the glyceroneogenic process. When the oxaloacetate isotopomers pass through citrate
  synthase, doubly labeled oxaloacetate isotopomers (i.e. [1,2,-13C2]oxaloacetate
  and [3,4-13C2]oxaloacetate) are formed and subsequently produce [1,2-13C2]glycerol,
  [2,3-13C2]glycerol, [1-13C1]glycerol, and [3-13C1]glycerol moieties. Metabolism
  of labeled pyruvate through the alternative pathway is shown in B. The entry of
  [U-13C3]pyruvate through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) produces [4,5-13C2]citrate
  after condensation with oxaloacetate, resulting in [1,2,-13C2]oxaloacetate and [3,4-13C2]oxaloacetate
  and consequently [1,2-13C2]glycerol, [2,3-13C2]glycerol, [1-13C1]glycerol, and [3-13C1]glycerol
  moieties. The appearance of [1,2,3-13C3]succinate and [2,3,4-13C3]succinate (quartets
  in the C2 and C3 resonance in ) and [2,3-13C2]glutamate and [1,2,3-13C3]glutamate
  (or glutamine; doublets in the C3 resonance in ) are evidence of [U-13C3]pyruvate
  entry through the pyruvate carboxylase pathway. In contrast, the appearance of [4,5-13C2]glutamate
  (doublets in the C4 resonance in ) is evidence of [U-13C3]pyruvate entry through
  the pyruvate dehydrogenase pathway. The metabolites underlined (i.e. the glycerol
  moiety of acylglycerols, succinate (Suc), glutamate and glutamine) were detected
  using 13C NMR. ○, 12C; ●, 13C. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; CAC, citric acid cycle;
  α-kG, α-ketoglutarate.
