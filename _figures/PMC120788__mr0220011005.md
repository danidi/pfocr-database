caption: Model for localization of the SIN proteins in fission yeast. (A) The SPB
  is a regulatory headquarters for the organization and activation of the SIN pathway.
  (Panel 1) In interphase Clp1p is in the nucleolus, CDK activity is low, and Sid4p-Cdc11p,
  Cdc16p-Byr4p, and Spg1-GDP localize to the SPB. (Panel 2) Upon entry into mitosis,
  CDK activity becomes high, Clp1p leaves the nucleolus, Cdc16p-Byr4p leave both SPBs,
  and Spg1p converts to the GTP-bound form, which recruits Cdc7p to the SPB. Note
  that Clp1p also localizes to the SPB, spindle, and actomyosin ring; however, this
  has been omitted for simplicity. Upon anaphase onset, CDK activity begins to drop
  (panel 3), and then Cdc16-Byr4p return to one SPB, which results in conversion of
  Spg1-GTP to Spg1-GDP and loss of Cdc7p from that SPB (panel 4). In addition, Sid1p-Cdc14p
  are recruited to the Cdc7p-containing SPB. (Panel 5) Just prior to initiation of
  cytokinesis, the Sid2p-Mob1p complex localizes to the division site and is thought
  to deliver the signal to divide to the actomyosin ring. (Panel 6) Once the septum
  has fully formed, the cell returns to the interphase state. (See text for references.)
  (B and C) SIN proteins and the cytokinesis checkpoint. (B) In cells that have defects
  in actomyosin ring formation, SIN pathway activation proceeds normally; however,
  cells undergo a prolonged delay with the SIN “on,” Clp1p out of the nucleus, and
  CDK activity low, which blocks further nuclear division cycles until cytokinesis
  is complete. (See text for references.) (C) Sid2p-green fluorescent protein (green)
  localization in early anaphase (above) and in telophase (below). DNA (blue) and
  tubulin (red) are also shown.
