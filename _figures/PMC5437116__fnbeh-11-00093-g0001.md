caption: 'Schematic representation of simplified diagram demonstrating the connections
  within the basal circuitry, and changes in the activity of basal ganglia nuclei
  associated with the mechanism of symptomatic anti-Parkinsonian activity of A2A receptor
  antagonists. The striatum is connected to the thalamus through two pathways: indirect
  (striatum/globus pallidus pars externa-GPe/subthalamic-STN/nigral) and direct (globus
  pallidus pars interna complex-GPi/substantia nigra pars reticulate-SNr) pathways.
  In the normal state (A), dopamine of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) acts
  on inhibitory D2 receptors of the indirect pathway and on stimulatory D1 receptors
  of the direct pathway. In (B), altered pathways are seen in Parkinson''s disease
  caused by depletion of dopamine. In (C), the A2A receptors modulate the indirect
  basal ganglia pathway due the co-localization with the dopaminergic D2 receptors
  (A2A–D2).'
