caption: GRP78 mediates hypoxia-induced EMT through smad2/3 and SRC/MAPK signaling.
  Hypoxia induced the high expression of GRP78. High expressed GRP78 activated the
  smad2/3 and Src/MAPK pathway. The pathway activated the expression of EMT transcription
  factor (snail, Twist and ZEB) and collaborated with them to induce the expression
  of Fibronectin, Vimentin and inhibit the expression of E-cadherin.
