caption: (a) 3 miRNAs (miR-3473a, miR-1224-5p, and miR-5128) up-regulated significantly
  down-regulate AQP8 and ABCG2 expressions upon colitis. Reduction in AQP8 possibly
  in turn decreases secretion of mucus to alter its fluidity, resulting eventually
  in barrier function of large-IECs upon inflammation. Reduced ABCG2 allows cells
  to inhibit efflux of xenobiotics and is causative of IEC apoptosis via forming reactive
  oxygen species (ROS). (b) Reduction in let-7b/c/f/g-5p and miR-141-3p increases
  expression of putative chemokine targets, CXCL9 or CXCL16, in inflamed large-IECs.
  This augmentation activates intracellular signaling pathway to release pro-inflammatory
  mediators, causing further promotion of inflammatory cascades.
