caption: N-linked glycosylation pathway. Biosynthesis of the N-linked precursor glycan
  begins on the cytoplasmic face of the ER where a GlcNAc residue is added in a pyrophosphate
  linkage to dolichol, an isoprenoid lipid. The GlcNAc-P-P-Dol is extended to form
  Man5GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol which is then flipped so that the glycan moiety is within the
  lumen of the ER. Further extension produces a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol that is a
  substrate for the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which transfers the precursor
  glycan en bloc to a nascent polypeptide. This figure depicts the glycosylation of
  a glycoprotein (brown) with 3 N-linked glycosylation sites (labeled 1, 2, and 3).
  Once transfered to protein, the glycan precursor is trimmed of its Glc residues
  during folding as part of the calnexin/calreticulin quality control cycle. CDG Type
  I mutations affect the biosynthesis of the precursor glycan, its transfer to protein,
  and early trimming steps. Once successfully folded, glycoproteins bearing high-Man
  glycans are transported to the Golgi apparatus where Man trimming occurs. In the
  early cis Golgi, high-Man glycans can be trimmed to Man5GlcNAc2 by complete removal
  of Man residues on the α3 arm and partial removal of Man residues on the α6 arm.
  In the medial Golgi, the first committed step toward production of a complex glycan
  is taken; GlcNAcT1 adds a GlcNAc to the α3 Man residue to form a hybrid type glycan
  (site 1 retains this structure). The GlcNAc-extended Man5GlcNAc2 glycan can be core
  fucosylated by the addition of a Fuc residue to the internal GlcNAc (site 2). In
  Drosophila and other arthropods, a second Fuc residue can be added (site 3). Additional
  Man trimming by Golgi mannosidases provide substrates for branching in the medial
  and trans Golgi (site 2). Subsequent extention with Gal and capping with sialic
  acid (shown here, as N-acetylneuraminic acid, NeuAc) completes the maturation of
  complex N-linked glycans. Hybrid glycans can also be extended on the α3 arm (site
  1). The abundance of hybrid and complex glycans is reduced in Drosophila compared
  to vertebrate species due to the presence of an hexosaminidase that removes the
  GlcNAc added by GlcNAcT1, thereby blocking additional branching/extension and producing
  a paucimanose glycan (site 3). CDG Type II mutations impact the availability of
  substrates and the activity of enzymes that process N-glycans in the Golgi apparatus.
  Graphical representation of monosaccharide residues and glycan structures is consistent
  with the Symbol Nomenclature For Glycans (SNFG), which has been broadly adopted
  by the glycobiology community ().
