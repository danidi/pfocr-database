caption: Cholesterol biosynthesis theme analysis. (A) Cholesterol biosynthesis theme
  from enrichment map. (B) Cholesterol biosynthesis-associated heatmap. (C) Network
  of interactions among moxLDL-SMC cholesterol metabolism related genes, as retrieved
  by the GeneMANIA website, colored by gene expression at 3h (node center) and 21h
  (node border). Red indicates up-regulation, blue indicates down-regulation and white
  indicates no differential expression or no expression data available. Circles represent
  genes and connecting lines represent interactions between genes. The network was
  generated using a GeneMANIA query of 43 cholesterol synthesis related genes (large
  circles) differentially expressed at either 3h or 21h. GeneMANIA retrieved known
  and predicted interactions between these genes and added extra genes (smaller white
  circles) that are strongly connected to query genes (we used the default setting
  of 20 additional connecting genes). Light blue lines indicate pathway interactions
  from the Reactome pathway database, dark blue lines indicate experimentally determine
  physical interactions, from various protein interaction databases included in GeneMANIA,
  and brown lines indicate predicted interactions, mostly from the I2D database of
  protein interactions predicted from experimentally determined physical interactions
  in other species. GeneMANIA advanced settings were used to search only physical,
  pathway and the default set of predicted networks. We excluded co-expression, co-localization
  and genetic interaction networks from the search to focus the analysis on higher
  confidence physical and pathway interactions.
