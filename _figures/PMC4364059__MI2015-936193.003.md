caption: The inflammasome pathway. Depending on the type of stimulus and the type
  of cell or tissue, signaling through NLR proteins can activate different inflammasomes.
  Inflammasome is a multiprotein complex composed of NACHT LRR protein (NLRP) and
  apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC), which cleaves procaspase-1
  (pro-casp-1) in caspase-1. Once activated, caspase-1 catalyzes the cleavage of pro-IL-18
  and pro-IL-1β into IL-18 and IL-1β, respectively, promoting the inflammatory response.
