caption: Scheme of mammalian tryptophan catabolism. Briefly, in mammalian cells, tryptophan
  is used mostly for protein synthesis. In a second quantitatively important pathway
  (driven by IDO in most cell types and by TDO more specifically in liver cells),
  it is the starting point of the kynurenine pathway. The kynurenine pathway gives
  birth to several metabolites, providing the appropriate enzymes that metabolize
  the various kynurenine intermediates are expressed. The main route of the kynurenine
  pathway leads to the formation of N-formyl kynurenine, l-kynurenine, 3-hydroxykynurenine,
  3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, quinolinic acid, nicotinic acid, and in fine nicotinamine
  adenine dinucleotides. Additional lateral branches of the kynurenine pathway lead
  to the formation of other terminal kynurenines, such as KA, xanthurenic acid, and
  anthranilic acid. Kynurenines indicated in boldface type (i.e. l-kynurenine and
  KA) correspond to the most abundant kynurenines found in caput epididymal tissue.
  Outside the kynurenine pathway, tryptophan is also the precursor of serotonin and
  melatonin. A very small proportion of tryptophan is also transformed into indol
  derivatives, such as indoxyl acetic acid. Conversion of Trp to N-formyl kynurenine
  is achieved via IDO and/or TDO. Kynurenine intermediates and terminal kynurenines
  are produced through the action of several distinct enzymes, including formaminase
  (arylformamidase; AFMID), kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT; also known as AADAT),
  kynureninase (KYNU), kynurenine 3-hydroxylase (K3H; also known as KMO), and 3-hydroxyamino
  oxidase (3HAO).
