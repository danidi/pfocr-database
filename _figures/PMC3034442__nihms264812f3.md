number: Figure 3
caption: Glycine synthesis and degradation. The figure shows a schematic representation
  of glycine synthesis and degradation. SHMTs are the two serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  isoforms that catalyze the synthesis of glycine from serine, a reaction coupled
  with the conversion of tetrahydrofolate (THF) to 5,10-methylene THF. AMT, aminomethyltransferase;
  DLD, dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase; GCSH, glycine cleavage system protein H and
  GLDC, glycine dehydrogenase, are components of the multiple-enzyme glycine cleavage
  system, the major pathway for glycine degradation.
