caption: C3a generated by glomerular complement activation via AP in response to Stx
  causes podocyte dysfunction. The scheme summarizes the possible sequence of events
  through which C3a, by binding C3aR on podocyte surface can stimulate, via phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K), ILK activity that, in turn, can inhibit glycogen synthase kinase
  (GSK)-3β. The inhibition of the GSK-3β leads to increased Snail expression and nuclear
  localization and the consequent downregulation of nephrin expression.
