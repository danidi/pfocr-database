caption: Mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway. The malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase mtFabD
  converts malonyl-CoA into malonyl-ACP, providing the elongation building blocks
  for the FAS-II. Cycles of elongation are initiated by the condensation of the FAS-I
  acyl-CoA products with malonyl-ACP, a reaction catalyzed by the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase
  mtFabH. The second step in the elongation cycle is performed by the NADPH-dependent
  β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase MabA, generating a β-hydroxyacyl-ACP intermediate, which
  is subsequently dehydrated by the β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase HadABC to form a
  trans-Δ2-enoyl-ACP. The final step in the elongation is carried out by the NADH-dependent
  enoyl-ACP reductase InhA. Subsequent rounds of elongation are initiated by the elongation
  condensing enzymes KasA and KasB, giving raise to meromycolic acids, which are condensed
  with C26 acyl-CoAs by the termination condensing enzyme Pks13 to form mycolic acids.
