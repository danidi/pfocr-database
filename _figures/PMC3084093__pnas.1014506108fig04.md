caption: Proteins encoding the CAF and tumor stroma-associated genes from seven different
  epithelial tumors share common involvement in the MAPK signaling pathway and focal
  adhesion. CAF/tumor stroma characteristic gene signatures from seven studies were
  mapped to PPIs. In the resulting PPI network, 55 proteins interacting with multiple
  NSCLC stroma and CAF proteins identified in this study (NSCLC; top) and additional
  tumor stroma/CAF studies from breast cancer, cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), and basal
  cell carcinoma (BCC) show significant enrichment in focal adhesion and the MAPK
  pathway (P = 1.7 × 10−4 and P = 7.7 × 10−4, respectively). Shapes (nodes) represent
  proteins, and lines (edges) indicate physical PPIs, colored based on annotation
  to KEGG focal adhesion (hsa04510; yellow). PPI network was visualized with NAViGaTOR
  2.1.14; indirectly linked proteins and interactions are faded-out to reduce image
  complexity.
