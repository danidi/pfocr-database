caption: The formation of the double membrane of the autophagosome is benefited by
  the presence of phospholipids, such as PA, which confer negative curvature and vesicularization,
  and as such, PA is a proautophagy signal. How PA would come about this is the subject
  of this predictive model. Likewise, PKC is also proautophagy, as PKC phosphorylates
  and is a positive regulator of PLD. mTOR is a known inhibitor of autophagy, and
  it also specifically represses expression of PLD2, a major contributor of the intracellular
  PA pool. β-Catenin has a dual role when it comes to the involvement of PLD. First,
  β-catenin initially up-regulates PLD2 expression. Second, if there is excessive
  autophagy or an aberrant signal leading to it, then PLD would provide the means
  to degrade the phagosomal center, one of which is the Dvl, and thus, the Wnt pathway.
  Taking all this into consideration, we propose the existence of a PLD-PA-PKC-β-catenin-Wnt
  pathway that regulates autophagy and cell survival in leukocytes and that disruptions
  in this pathway can lead to inadequate leukocyte functionality.
