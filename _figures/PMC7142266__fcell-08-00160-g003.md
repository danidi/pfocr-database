caption: Functional domains of BRCA1/2 protein with pathogenic mutations. (A) The
  functional domains of the BRCA1 protein, mainly containing the RING-finger, SQ-cluster,
  and BRCT (middle) domains, functionally interacted with BARD1, RAD51C, and ATM (beneath),
  to orchestrate homologous recombination. The selected reported pathogenic mutations
  are indicated with black arrows, as shown. (B) BRCA2 was represented by a similar
  schematic figure with different functional domains (middle) and binding partners
  (beneath); confirmed pathogenic mutations are also shown above.
