caption: (Left) An intact rod photoreceptor cell. IS, inner segment; N, nucleus; OS,
  outer segment; T, terminal. (Right) A portion of the inner segment. In retinal disease,
  opsin, which normally is sequestered in the outer segment, appears on inner segment
  membranes. If bound by retinal and in the presence of light, opsin activates an
  abnormal signaling pathway involving adenylyl cyclase (AC) and leading to increased
  cAMP, neuritic sprouting, and cell death. Modified from (), Copyright Association
