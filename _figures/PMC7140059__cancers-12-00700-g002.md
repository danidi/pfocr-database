caption: Pathway reconstruction. Inferred dynamic networks of the (a) focal adhesion,
  (b) mTOR signaling, and (c) TGF-beta signaling pathways. Blue circles are the nodes
  of the network and represent genes. The lines depict which genes’ mRNA expression
  level at the current time point, denoted by Yt, affect the genes’ mRNA expression
  level at a future time point, denoted Yt + 1. Solid and dashed lines indicate whether
  this relation is of a stimulating (positive) or suppressing (negative) nature, respectively.
  For plotting purposes, genes with a total edge strength (sum of all absolute in
  and out connections of the respective gene) <0.25 (or <1 for TGF-beta signaling)
  were excluded.
