caption: The AD APP is a single-pass transmembrane protein that includes the 42-amino-acid
  Aβ (red). Aβ is liberated upon sequential cleavages of APP by β-secretase (bs) at
  the N-terminus of Aβ and γ-secretase at the C-terminus of Aβ; the latter cleavage
  is executed by presenilin-1 (PS1; an integral membrane protein that is the enzymatic
  component of the γ-secretase protein complex). An alternative cleavage of APP within
  the Aβ sequence by the α-secretase enzyme produces a secreted form of APP that is
  believed to play important roles in developmental and synaptic plasticity, and neuron
  survival. Whereas Aβ is normally cleared from the brain, in AD it self-aggregates
  to form oligomers and during this process ROS are generated and propagated to the
  cell membrane, resulting in lipid peroxidation, impairment of membrane ion (Na+
  and Ca2+) transporters and excessive Ca2+ influx through glutamate receptor (NMDA)
  channels. In addition to increasing Aβ production, mutations in PS1 that cause AD
  perturb endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+, resulting in excessive Ca2+ release. Mitochondrial
  Ca2+ homoeostasis and energy production may be impaired in neurons in AD as the
  result of cellular Ca2+ overload and increased oxidative stress possibly involving
  direct actions of Aβ on mitochondrial membranes. The pathological scenario just
  described involves perturbations in signalling pathways normally involved in adaptive
  neuroplasticity, with glutamate signalling being a well-established example. Glutamate-induced
  Ca2+ is normally transient with the Ca2+ activating kinases such as CaMK and MAPK.
  The kinases in turn activate transcription factors (TF) that induce the expression
  of nuclear genes that encode proteins involved in effecting adaptive morphological
  and functional responses of the neurons. CREB is one such synaptic activity-responsive
  transcription factor that induces the expression of BDNF, a protein critically involved
  in synaptic plasticity and neuronal survival. The successive discoveries of genes-linked
  inherited forms of PD placed mitochondrial alterations at centre stage in the pathogenesis
  of PD, and also revealed novel proteins that regulate mitochondrial functional and
  structural plasticity. A feature of all cases of PD is the intracellular accumulation
  of α-synuclein, apparently as the result of impaired degradation by the proteasome.
  Parkin (an E3 ubiquitin ligase), DJ-1, PINK1 and LRRK2 have each been shown to modify
  mitochondrial function (ATP and ROS production), and some findings suggest that
  Parkin, PINK1 and LRRK2 also influence mitochondrial fission and fusion. PINK1 and
  DJ-1 may suppress intramitochondrial oxidative stress, whereas Parkin and DJ-1 inhibit
  the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, thereby protecting neurons
  against apoptotic cell death that can be triggered by release of cytochrome c (CytC)
  from the mitochondria. Finally, in HD, mutant huntingtin (Htt) self-aggregates and
  impairs CREB-mediated transcription of BDNF, thereby compromising a pathway critical
  for neuronal plasticity and survival. See the text of this paper and the following
  references for additional information and discussion (; ; ; ; ; ).
