caption: Novel agents targeting inflammation and NO bioavailability. Hemolysis in
  SCD and the resultant cell-free Hb leads to NO scavenging. Increased bioavailability
  of NO and its downstream target cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) lead to salutary
  effects in the endothelium, smooth muscles, leukocytes, platelets, and increased
  γ-globin. Therapeutic agents enhancing NO bioavailability by various mechanisms
  are depicted here. Of note, PDE9 has restricted tissue expression in the hematopoietic
  cells and brain with the potential for reduced off-target effects as opposed to
  PDE5, which is more widely expressed. Glutamine increases NADH within RBCs, thus
  reducing effects of oxidative stress. Dietary glutamine also serves as a precursor
  for the de novo production of arginine through the citrulline-arginine pathway,
  contributing to increased NO production. PDE, phosphodiesterase; sGC, soluble guanylate
  cyclase. Adapted from Morrone et al with permission.
