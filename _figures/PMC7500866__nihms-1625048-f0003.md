caption: 'Hereditary tyrosinaemia type I (HT-I) is a lethal inborn error of metabolism
  caused by a deficiency in fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), which catalyzes the
  fifth and final step of tyrosine catabolism. (A) Normal catabolism and disorders
  associated with tyrosine catabolism. (B) Untreated HT-I: Accumulation of toxic catabolites
  with deleted or non-functional FAH enzyme. Fah−/− mice die as neonates due to hepatotoxicity.
  (C) Treated HT-I: The lethal phenotype of HT-1 is rescued by the small molecule
  inhibitor nitisinone (NTBC), which blocks hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD),
  an upstream enzyme in the tyrosine pathway. (D) Metabolic pathway reprogramming:
  Rescue of HT-1 by CRISPR-mediated deletion of HPD. (E) Somatic liver knockout (SLiK):
  Using CRISPR to excise critical exons of the HPD gene confers resistance to hepatotoxicity
  in Fah−/− mice, resulting in a positive selection advantage for HPD-edited cells.
  By simultaneously targeting HPD and a separate GOI, edited cells are able to repopulate
  the whole liver after only a few weeks.'
