caption: Figure 1. Simplified overview of TLR4 signaling in primary lung cells. Within
  the alveolus LPS is recognized by the TLR4 receptor complex that is constitutively
  expressed by primary alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. Upon receptor binding
  TLR4 sequentially activates the MyD88-dependent pathway from the plasma membrane
  resulting in NF-kB activation and the TRAM/TRIF-dependent pathway from the endosomal
  compartment leading to activation of IRF3. Cell type-specific regulation of LPS-induced
  TLR4 signaling in the lung is modified by microenvironmental factors, including
  the pulmonary surfactant lipids and proteins that partly regulate signaling through
  modulation of subcellular TLR4 localization. AECI, type I alveolar epithelial cells;
