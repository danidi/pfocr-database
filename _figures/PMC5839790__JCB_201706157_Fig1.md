caption: 'Classic autophagy compared with related trafficking pathways. (A) Classic
  autophagy: Diverse stimuli elicit the hierarchical recruitment and activity of multiple
  ATGs (yellow) and other regulatory proteins (blue) to construct the double membrane
  autophagosome. The lipidation of LC3 (LC3-II) is crucial for the capture of autophagic
  cargo and to stabilize of the inner autophagosomal membrane. The autophagosome subsequently
  fuses with the lysosome in a STX17-dependent manner, resulting in degradation of
  the vesicle contents by lysosomal enzymes. (B) Secretory autophagy: ATGs mediate
  the unconventional secretion of multiple proteins (e.g., Acb1 in yeast, and IL-1β,
  IL-18, and HMGB1 in mammalian cells) that lack an N-terminal signal sequence. These
  targets are postulated to be released via several putative mechanisms. First, the
  ATG conjugation machinery promotes the formation of an LC3+ autophagosome-like intermediate,
  and the contents enwrapped within the inner membrane of autophagosome are released
  extracellularly instead of degraded in lysosomes. Second, targets of secretory autophagy,
  such as IL-1β, are translocated into the intramembrane space of an LC3+ double membrane
  vesicular intermediate that fuses directly with the plasma membrane or fuses with
  a MVB intermediate that is secreted. Last, although formal experimental evidence
  is lacking, secretory autophagy may involve an MVB/amphisome intermediate and the
  exocytic release of small extracellular microvesicles. Regardless of the exact pathway,
  recent work indicates that secretory autophagy proceeds through a dedicated SNARE
  machinery, which diverts secreted targets away from the lysosome and toward the
  plasma membrane (PM). (C) LAP: the phagocytosis of pathogens and other prey in certain
  cell types (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells) recruits UVRAG and Rubicon (RUBCN),
  thereby activating the Beclin-1–VPS34 complex to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate
  and NOX2, an NADPH oxidase that generates ROS inside the phagosome. This subsequently
  triggers the recruitment and activation of the ATG conjugation machinery, which
  mediates LC3-II at the single membrane phagosome. LC3-II expedites fusion to lysosomes
  and degradation of the offending pathogen.'
