caption: Induction of SSBs activates ATR-CHK1 pathway. ATM is activated to mediate
  ATM-CHK2 response. ATM could phosphorylate ITCH that mediates WWOX ubiquitination
  and stabilization which together with p-ATM maintains efficient DDR and guard stability
  of the genome. Inhibition of ATM renders WWOX less active (not shown). Activation
  of WWOX acts in a feed-forward loop to maintain ATM efficient DDR (16) and possibly
  ATR checkpoint activation.
