caption: '(A) Shown are the set of metabolic reactions in S. cerevisise associating
  purine biosynthesis and salvage and amino acid metabolism with carbon metabolism,
  and two key transcriptional regulators (left). Mitochondrial genes link respiration
  to purine metabolism. Glycolysis is linked to purine salvage by the metabolic intermediate
  3-P-glycerate. De novo purine metabolism is linked to the pentose shunt through
  ribulose-5-phosphate. The genes in red are induced post-shift in S. cerevisiae and
  other post-WGD species, but their orthologs are repressed in pre-WGD species. Both
  Schizosaccharomyces species have three copies of ZWF1 (purple) that are strongly
  induced. (B) Shown are the major carbon pathways involved in the fermentation or
  respiration of glucose and their interconnectivity. Both WGD and other duplicate
  genes in each pathway are indicated. The genes in red are induced post-shift in
  S. cerevisiae and most of the other post-WGD species while those in green are repressed
  similar to their pre-duplication orthologs. Differences in trans regulators may
  further contribute to the reassignment of their targets between modules. While many
  of the regulators of glucose repression in S. cerevisiae are present across the
  phylogeny (), the regulation of some has changed at the WGD and at the ancestor
  of the Schizosaccharomyces, consistent with the reassignment of their targets. For
  example, the glucose repressing MIG genes and the TUP1-CYC8 complex are strongly
  repressed following glucose depletion in most post-WGD species, whereas some respiration
  activators are strongly induced (CAT8 and HAP2,4,5 and SIP2 post-WGD, HAP2, MOT3,
  and SIP2 in S. pombe, data not shown). We observed no such changes in the expression
  of known regulators of amino acid and purine metabolism (data not shown). In some
  cases, duplication of key regulators followed by reassignment to a new module may
  have further contributed to new regulatory functions. For example, TPK1 and TPK3
  are two WGD-derived paralogs encoding catalytic subunits of PKA, a major regulator
  of carbohydrate metabolism and stress responses (). TPK1 in strongly induced in
  the sensu stricto species, as is the single TPK gene in the Schizosaccharomyces.
  TPK3 is repressed in those species, conserving the expression pattern of its ortholog
  in all the respiratory pre-duplication species (data not shown).DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00603.017'
