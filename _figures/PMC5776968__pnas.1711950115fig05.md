caption: Summary of pathway analysis. I. Unique signaling pathway responding to CpG-C/GpC-C
  ODNs. B cells responded to unmethylated CpG-C and GpC-C oligodeoxynucleotides, but
  not to CpG-A and CpG-B, by releasing mtDNA webs. The release/signal transduction
  was inhibited by hypothermia and ZnCl2 (). Cyclosporin A act as an inhibitor of
  mitochondria pore opening and prevents the release of mtDNA fragments. However,
  the release of mtDNA webs was not inhibited by cyclosporin A (). Endocytosis of
  CpG-C or GpC-C is apparently not required for B-cell mtDNA web development as two
  different inhibitors of endocytosis, cytochalasin D and dansylcadaverine, were unable
  to prevent mtDNA ejection (). II. Evidence for B-cell receptor (BCR) independent
  pathway. BCR signaling is activated by ligation with anti-IgM F(ab′)2. However,
  treatment of B cells with anti-IgM F(ab′)2 did not induce mtDNA release (). Inhibition
  of BCR downstream signaling molecules, using the inhibitors PP2, Syk inihibitor
  II, and wortmannin did not hamper mtDNA web release. The targets of these inhibitors,
  kinases Lyn, Syk, and PI3K, are crucial for BCR signaling acting as transmitters
  of the activation signal into cytoplasmic signaling pathways (). III. Evidence for
  TLR9-independent pathway. The most convincing evidence for a TLR9-independent mechanism
  of mtDNA web release is (i) lack of CpG-motif requirement (i.e., also non-CpG-C
  can stimulate web release) and (ii) insensitivity to endosomal inhibitor chloroquine
  and the fact that cells with low levels of TLR9 can also produce mtDNA webs ().
  See  and connected text for more comprehensive explanation of TLR9 redundancy in
  web release. IV. Evidence for STING-independent pathway. Stimulation of STING (followed
  by translocation to perinuclear vesicles) induces type I IFN release. We found no
  (or weak) type I IFN release from B cells treated with GpC-C, although GpC-C generated
  mtDNA web release (). Moreover, STING agonist 2′3′-cGAMP did not induce mtDNA web
  release. Also, quinacrine, a nonspecific inhibitor of STING signaling, did not prevent
  CpG-C–induced mtDNA web release. We also showed that CLL B cells, despite expressing
  low levels of STING, could release mtDNA webs (). V. Evidence for AIM2-inflammasome–independent
  pathway. Inhibition of key enzymes, AIM2 and caspase-1, in inflammasome signaling
  did not affect mtDNA web release. In addition, IL-1β secretion, normally high upon
  AIM2 stimulation, was absent or very low in three different donor B-cell samples
  (). VI. Evidence for ROS-independent mechanism. ROS has a fundamental role in NET
  release. Inhibitors of ROS formation (i.e., DPI and apocynin) and ROS scavengers
  (i.e., SOD, catalase, NAC, MitoQ, and ferrostatin-1) did, however, not affect mtDNA
  web release (). Neither did treatment with inhibitors of mitochondrial electron
  transport chain and Fenton chemistry (i.e., rotenone and deferoxamine mesylate).
