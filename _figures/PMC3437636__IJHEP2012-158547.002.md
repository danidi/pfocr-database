caption: Formation of the NFκB-stimulating TNFR1 signaling complex. The classical
  NFκB pathway is activated by a broad range of stimuli, including TNF-α. Binding
  of TNF-α to TNFR1 triggers recruitment of the death domain-containing proteins RIP1
  and TRADD. Next, complex TRAF2-cIAP1/2 is recruited to TNFR1-bound TRADD. Recruitment
  of IKK2 subunit to TRADD-bound TRAF2 stimulates kinase activity of the IKK complex,
  following by proteolytic degradation of IκB proteins. p65/p50 complex (NFκB) is
  translocated to the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes. Alternative
  NFκB pathway (not shown) is activated by a limited subgroup of TNF ligands and involves
  activation of NIK-mediated stimulation of IKK1 and conversion of p100-containing
  NFκB complexes into p52-containing NFκB complexes by proteolytic processing of p100
  to p52. In addition, in TNF-mediated apoptosis, receptor aggregation results in
  recruitment of the adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD/MORT1) and
  caspase-8. Caspase-8 becomes activated and initiates apoptosis by direct cleavage
  of downstream effector caspases. The mitochondrial pathway is initiated by the release
  of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c, or Smac from mitochondria into the
  cytosol, which trigger caspase-3 activation through the formation of the cytochrome
  c/Apaf-1/caspase-9-containing apoptosome complex.
