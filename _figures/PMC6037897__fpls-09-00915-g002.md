caption: The chloroplast and mitochondrion are involved in the response to heat stress
  in plants. Except the PM, the other key sites of ROS generation are PSII in chloroplasts
  and complex I/III in mitochondria. Heat affects the fluidity of the thylakoid membrane,
  and unsaturated lipids near the QB site are particularly vulnerable to peroxidation.
  The lipid peroxidation products affect the stability of photosystem proteins; the
  electron transport chain is restrained, and 1O2 forms on the electron acceptor side
  and •OH on the electron donor side. High temperatures trigger the chloroplast UPR
  and retrograde signaling pathway. Similarly, heat stress causes CL lipid peroxidation
  in the mitochondrion membrane, which inhibits the activity of CCO; but membrane
  depolarization via CCCP can inhibit ROS generation. The electron transport suppressed
  in the respiratory chain induces the production of ROS, which triggers both the
  mitochondrial UPR and retrograde signaling pathway.
