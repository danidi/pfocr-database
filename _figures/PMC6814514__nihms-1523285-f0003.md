caption: In vitro models can be used to investigate how chemical exposures influence
  various facets of exosome biology, and the cellular pharmacology of exosome-based
  therapeutics. Cells exposed to chemicals (including pharmacological drugs) can undergo
  many physiological changes. Exposure-mediated changes in gene expression can modify
  nucleic acids and proteins available for exosome export. Chemical exposure can also
  alter various aspects of the endocytic pathway, such as the type of exosome biogenesis
  (ESCRT dependent versus independent), the selection of cargo, the fate of MVBs,
  and the rate of exosome secretion. The extent of these alterations may exhibit dose-dependence.
  Once released, exosomes from exposed cells can interact with a variety of cell and
  tissue types, but fusion or uptake may be dictated by certain factors (e.g. surface
  proteins). Exposure-associated exosomes may elicit cell-type specific changes in
  recipient cells. The biochemical factors that determine the interactions between
  exposure-associated exosomes and recipient cells may determine the distribution
  of exposure-mediated effects. These principles also likely apply to exosome-mediated
  drug delivery. In vitro models can be used to determine how exosome-bound drugs
  may have different pharmacological profiles from their free-forms.
