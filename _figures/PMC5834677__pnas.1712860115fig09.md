caption: 'A draft of an electronic circuit conceptualized by the design principles
  of the AIM2-ASC pathway. HPFs represent the preference for larger dsDNA in each
  signaling step (i.e., dsDNA length dependence in 1: dsDNA mediated assembly, 2:
  trans-activation of AIM2, and 3: ASC polymerization). AIM2, AIM2⋅ASC, and ASC filaments
  are described as amplifiers given their persistence. LPFs represent the enhanced
  assembly on shorter dsDNA in the presence preassembled 1: AIM2 and 2: ASC filaments.
  Pathways without any filter indicate dsDNA-free assembly. All of the feedback loops
  are connected to the same forward direction (polarity) to generate positive feedback.'
