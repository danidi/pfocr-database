caption: Intracellular signaling cascades activated by interaction of BDNF isoforms
  with its receptors. proBDNF and mBDNF bind to different receptors, respectively.
  The mBDNF isoform exhibits highest affinity for the tyrosine kinase B receptor (TrkB)
  receptor, which when stimulated undergoes homodimerization and autophosphorylation,
  but also binds the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. The interaction between
  the TrkB receptor and the p75NTR receptor in a complex increases the ligand binding
  affinity to BDNF. Sortilin is considered a co-receptor for p75NTR. The proBDNF isoform,
  consisting of two sequences (pro-domain and mature domain), interacts with specific
  receptors, sortilin and p75NTR, respectively. The binding of proBDNF to a p75NTR/sortilin-complex
  induces signaling pathways that are specific for proBDNF. The binding of proBDNF
  in combination with sortilin causes the involvement of neurotrophin receptor-interacting
  factor (NRIF), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and neurotrophin
  receptor-interacting MAGE homologue (NRAGE) proteins. This pathway activates the
  JNK-associated pathway that promotes programmed cell death, or the receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIP2) /TRAF6-mediated pathway is initiated. Multi-subunit
  IκB kinase (IKK) phosphorylates (orange dot) the inhibitor of kB (IkB) protein,
  which results in dissociation of IkB from NF-κB. The activated nuclear factor kappa
  B (NF-kB) is then translocated into the nucleus where it binds to specific sequences
  of DNA and promotes neuronal survival and maintenance. In addition, p75NTR interacts
  with the Rho family of proteins, whose activation mediates the activity of Rho-associated
  protein kinase (ROCK), which subsequently leads to activation of the AKT pathway,
  involved in cytoskeletal remodeling. The mBDNF/TrkB receptor complex triggers signaling
  pathways associated with activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase
  C gamma (PLC-γ), and GTP-ases of the Rho family, involved in survival, plasticity
  and neurite outgrowth, transcription regulation, and synaptic plasticity.
