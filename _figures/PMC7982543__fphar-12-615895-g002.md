caption: The relationship between hypoxia and inflammation. Under normal oxygen (A),
  the proline residues on the α subunit of HIF are hydroxylated by HIF prolyl hydroxylase,
  so that HIF is recognized and ubiquitinated by VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase. It is then
  rapidly degraded by the proteasome. Asparagine hydroxylation inhibits the interaction
  of HIFα with the co-activator cAMP response element binding (CREB)-binding protein
  (CBP) and histone acetyltransferase p300 (p300). During hypoxia (B), the enzyme
  activities of PHD and FIH are inhibited, resulting in the stabilization of HIFα
  subunit. After being transported to the nucleus, HIFα complexes with the β subunit,
  recruits p300 and CBP, and then binds to the hypoxia response element (HRE) in the
  target gene promoter to initiate transcription. Hypoxia and inflammation (C). On
  the one hand, inflammation is usually characterized by tissue hypoxia or the stabilization
  of hypoxia-dependent transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF).
  On the other hand, hypoxia is characterized by secondary inflammatory changes. In
  order to meet the challenge of hypoxia and ensure cell survival, the regulation
  of HIF and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) occurs through oxygen-sensitive prolyl hydroxylase
  (PHD). Hypoxia activates NF-κB through a pathway involving IκB kinase-β (IKKβ) activation,
  which leads to phosphorylation-dependent degradation of IκBα and the release of
  NF-κB. PHD and FIH regulate the activation of NF-κB by regulating the activity of
  IKKβ.
