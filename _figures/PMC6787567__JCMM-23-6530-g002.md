caption: 'Involvement of lncRNAs in monocyte/macrophage development and M1/M2 switch.
  Circulating monocytes originated from haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs)
  are considered as the precursors of macrophages. Induced by phorbol‐12‐myristate‐13‐acetate
  (PMA), lnc‐MC up‐regulated in THP‐1, HL‐60 cells and CD34+ HSPCs. It could act as
  a ceRNA to soak up miR‐199a‐5p, and eventually facilitate the differentiation process
  through activating the transforming growth factor β (TGF‐β) signalling pathway.
  ,  In response to various stimuli, macrophages mainly polarized into two types:
  classical M1 and alternative M2 type, and dynamically switched its function to adapt
  to the specific environmental changes. LPS induced up‐regulation of lncRNA Mirt2
  in the cytoplasm, but the increase in Mirt2 was restricted by sustained and excessive
  activation of inflammatory responses at the late stage. Restoring Mirt2 expression
  in later stage promoted the IL‐4 induced M2 polarization with a remarkable increased
  level of M2 markers. HOTTIP expression was associated with TLR tolerance, and has
  been speculated to skew macrophage polarization to a “M2‐like” phenotype. KCNQ1OT1
  could function as a miR‐21a‐5p decoy to up‐regulate IL‐10, induced polarization
  of macrophages into M2 type.,  LncRNA TCONS_00019715 was expressed at a higher level
  when M2 macrophage was converted to M1, but decreased when M1 type was converted
  to M2'
