caption: Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) fight-or-flight stress responses deliver
  epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE) into the tumor microenvironment via circulating
  blood and NE release from local sympathetic nerve fibers. Both catecholamines bind
  to β-adrenergic receptors, resulting in Gαs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase,
  and subsequent conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into cyclic 3′–5′ adenosine
  monophosphate (cAMP). Transient flux of interacellular cAMP activates two major
  biochemical effector systems. (1) cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) to phosphorylate
  multiple target proteins including transcription factors of the CREB/ATF and GATA
  families, as well as the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK). BARK recruitment of
  β-arrestin inhibits β-adrenergic receptor signaling and activates Src kinase, resulting
  in activation of transcription factors such as STAT3 and downstream kinases such
  as focal adhesion kinase (FAK). FAK activation modulates cell trafficking and motility
  via cytoskeletal dynamics, as well as cellular resistance to apoptosis (e.g., anoikis).
  PKA-dependent activation of Bcl-2 family member BAD can also render cancer cells
  resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. (2) In the second major effector pathway,
  cAMP activation of the Exchange Protein activated by Adenylyl Cyclase (EPAC) leads
  to Rap1A-mediated activation of the B-Raf/MAP kinase signaling pathway and downstream
  effects on diverse cellular processes including gene transcription mediated by AP-1
  and Ets family transcription factors. The general pattern of transcriptional responses
  induced by β-adrenergic signaling includes up-regulated expression of metastasis-associated
  genes involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, tissue invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition, and down-regulated expression of genes facilitating anti-tumor immune
  responses. In addition to direct effects on β-receptor-bearing tumor cells, SNS
  activation also modulates cancer biology by regulating the bone marrow generation
  and tumor recruitment and transcriptional activation of β-receptor-bearing monocyte/macrophages,
  as well as the growth and differentiation of vascular endothelial cells and pericytes.
  β-adrenergic effects on stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment generally synergize
  with direct effects on tumor cells in promoting cancer survival, growth, and metastatic
  dissemination.
