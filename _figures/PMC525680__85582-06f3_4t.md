caption: 'Comparative metabolic reconstruction in H. marismortui and Halobacterium
  sp. NRC-1. An example of metabolic reconstruction using the Web intermediary software
  and KEGG: arginine metabolism and the urea cycle in H. marismortui compared with
  Halobacterium sp. NRC-1. Enzymes identified in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 are shaded
  in green, and those identified in H. marismortui are shown with a red border and
  red font. The ADI pathway of arginine fermentation in Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 is
  indicated with solid blue arrows. Each enzyme identified in H. marismortui is hyperlinked
  to its corresponding entry in the SBEAMS annotation database. This view of KEGG
  metabolic pathways for the two halophiles is available on .'
