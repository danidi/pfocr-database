caption: A manually chosen section of the network capturing source regulators, Hog
  pathway components, and Rck2 shown, as described in  and the key. The figure also
  shows three constituent proteins that are predicted targets of our method and whose
  physical interaction with source regulators we validated by co-immunoprecipitation
  (dashed lines).
