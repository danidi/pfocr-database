caption: 'A) In the presence or absence of serum, tumor cell growth is dictated by
  cellular autophagy and growth/survival signals that are tightly controlled by PI3K/AKT
  and AMPK pathways convergent on mTOR by way of PRAS40. Physiological Ca2+ stores
  are absolutely required to maintain basal activation of the PI3K/AKT-PRAS40-mTOR
  signaling and cell growth. B) In a tumor microenvironment with pericellular ATP
  likely to be at high levels, activation of P2X7 on tumor cells leads to concurrent
  blockade of the mTOR signaling by way of AMPK-PRAS40 axis and the PI3K/AKT pathway.
  These are the two critical control nexuses for autophagy induction and growth inhibition
  that ultimately lead to tumor cell death. Ectonucleotidase CD39 protects tumor cells
  from antitumor activity of high levels of extracellular ATP , . Pathway key: →:
  Stimulation; –ı: Inhibition.'
