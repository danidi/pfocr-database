caption: The choreography of Ca2+signaling and examples of virus-induced perturbations
  on Ca2+ homeostasis. Upon extracellular stimulation, the free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]CYT
  ) rapidly increases by the entry of extracellular Ca2+ across the plasma membrane
  via Ca2+ channels, such as voltage-operated channels (VOC), receptor-operated channels
  (ROC), transient receptor potential ion-channel (TRP) and store-operated channels
  (SOC), or by the release of Ca2+ from internal stores (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), Golgi complex, and lysosomes) through inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors
  (IP3 R) and ryanodine receptors (RyR) due to activation of membrane receptors (G
  protein coupled receptor [GPCR] and receptor tyrosine kinase [RTK]) and the subsequent
  synthesis of IP3. At the resting state, [Ca2+ ]CYT is maintained at submicromolar
  range by extruding Ca2+ outside of the plasma membrane via plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase
  (PMCA) and Na2+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), or by pumping Ca2+ back into internal stores
  through sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) or secretory pathway
  Ca2+-ATPase (SPCA). In mitochondria, Ca2+ can easily pass through outer mitochondrial
  membrane pores and cross the inner mitochondrial membrane through the membrane-embedded
  Ca2+ uniporter. Ca2+ exits mitochondria through the opening of a non-selective high-conductance
  channel permeability transition pore (PTP) in the inner mitochondrial membrane and
  the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). The Ca2+ signals are delivered by affecting the activity
  of Ca2+ buffers (e.g., calreticulin), Ca2+ effectors (e.g., CaM and S100A10) and
  Ca2+-regulated enzymes. The signals can also have “long-term” effects by modulating
  the activity of transcriptional factors including nuclear factor of activated T
  cells (NFAT) or Ca2+-dependent transcriptional cotransactivators (e.g., p300). Viral
  proteins are capable of perturbing the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by (1) modulating
  Ca2+ pumps and/or channels on the plasma membrane (e.g., Tat and gp120 of HIV-1,
  HBx of HBV; blue boxes); (2) triggering Ca2+ release from internal stores via IP3
  R (e.g., NSP4 of rotavirus and Nef of HIV; purple boxes) or altering membrane permeability
  and pump activity of internal stores (e.g., 2B of coxsakievirus, p7 of HCV, and
  core protein of HCV; purple boxes,); (3) disrupting mitochondrial membrane permeabilization
  or potential (e.g., Vpr of HIV-1, p13II of HTLV-1, core protein of HCV and HBx of
  HBV; lemon boxes); (4) activating Ca2+-responsive transcriptional factors or coactivators,
  such as p300 (e.g., p12I of HTLV-1 and Vpr of HIV-1; yellow box) in the nucleus.
  Moreover, a variety of viral proteins interact with important cellular CaBPs, such
  as CaM, S100A10 and calreticulin, to remodel the Ca2+signaling network. The gradient
  color bar on the left indicates free Ca2+ concentration in subcellular compartments.
  Calcium ions are shown as cyan dots.
