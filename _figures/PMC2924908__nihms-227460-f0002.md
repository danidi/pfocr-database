caption: (a) An intricate network of soluble and cell-surface- bound proteins enables
  the recognition, tagging, and elimination of microbial intruders and foreign cells
  and stimulates downstream immune responses. In the classical pathway (CP), C1q recognizes
  pathogen- or damage-associated patterns (such as IgG, IgM, or CRP) on foreign or
  apoptotic cells, inducing the formation of the CP C3 convertase (C4b2b) via cleavage
  of C2 and C4 by C1s. Detection of carbohydrate patches by MBL or ficolins associated
  with MASP via the lectin pathway enables the formation of the same convertase, which
  subsequently activates the abundant plasma protein C3, generating its active fragments
  C3a and C3b. Covalent deposition of C3b on nearby surfaces (i.e. opsonization) leads
  to the binding of factor B and conversion into the alternative pathway (AP) C3 convertase
  (C3bBb), which cleaves more C3 into C3b and thereby amplifies the complement response.
  In addition, a low level of complement activation is maintained in solution (i.e.,
  tick-over), and resulting C3b or C3 convertases can be recruited to foreign surfaces
  and stabilized by properdin (P). Increasing densities of C3b on the surface lead
  to a gradual substrate shift of the convertases from C3 to C5. Cleavage of C5 into
  C5a and C5b initiates the assembly of the lytic terminal complement complex (TCC)
  on susceptible cells. Opsonization by C1q, C3b, and its degradation products iC3b,
  C3c, and C3d induces phagocytosis via a panel of complement receptors. In addition,
  the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a cause strong proinflammatory signaling via their
  respective GPCR. C5a also co-regulates immunoglobulin (Ig)-mediated phagocytosis
  of immune complexes (IC) by modulating the differential expression of activating
  (FcγRI/III) and deactivating (FcγRIIB) Fc-gamma receptors. On B cells, binding of
  C3dg to the CR2/CD19 co-receptor complex lowers the threshold of activation by several
  orders of magnitude and plays an important role in their maturation. Close crosstalk
  between Toll-like receptors (TLR), complement receptors, and regulators modulates
  IL-12 in antigen-presenting cells (APC) and thereby influences activation and differentiation
  of T cells. (b) On healthy human cells, any complement activation or amplification
  is immediately attenuated by a panel of surface-bound regulators that either accelerate
  decay of the convertases (CR1, DAF), act as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated
  degradation of C3b and C4b (CR1, MCP), or prevent the formation of the TCC (CD59).
  In addition, solution-based regulators such as C4BP, FH, or FHL-1 recognize self-surface
  pattern-like glycosaminoglycans and further impair activation. Finally, a diverse
  set of regulators enables control at the level of initiation (C1-INH, MAP-1, sMAP,
  CRIT, FHR-4), the C5 convertases (FHR-1, CRIg) or TCC (FHR-1, VTN, clusterin).
