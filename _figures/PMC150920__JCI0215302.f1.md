caption: Formation of ceramide in mammalian cells. Many stress stimuli, including
  anticancer drugs, γ-radiation, ultraviolet, cytokines, and growth factor withdrawal,
  activate sphingomyelinases, which remove the head group from the membrane phospholipid
  sphingomyelin, forming ceramide. An opposing reaction, catalyzed by sphingomyelin
  synthase, occurs when phosphocholine is transferred from phosphatidylcholine to
  the primary hydroxyl of ceramide, producing sphingomyelin and diacylglycerol. In
  addition, ceramide can be produced through a de novo biosynthetic pathway, described
  in the text. Sphingosine is not produced by the de novo pathway and can only be
  formed by deacylation of ceramide catalyzed by ceramidases.
