caption: The mechanism of action of statins on the mevalonate pathway. Statins are
  competitive inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase
  (HMG CoA reductase). This is a critical enzyme in the production of mevalonate and
  inhibition consequently reduces its derivatives, cholesterol, steroids and isoprenoids.
  Importantly in cancer, inhibition of this pathway reduces specific prenylated proteins,
  such as RAS.
