caption: The potential mechanism of HBO treatment on intestinal barrier after SCI.
  The intestinal mechanical barrier mainly consisted of intact intestinal epithelial
  cells and their close connections. The connections between adjacent epithelial cells
  include tight junctions (TJs), adherent junctions (AJs), and desmosomes. TJs are
  mainly composed of claudins, occludin, and ZO. TJs are regulated by Rho/ROCK signaling
  pathway. HBO treatment increased the expression of occludin and ZO-1 following SCI
  and improved intestinal barrier integrity. Furthermore, HBO treatment significantly
  inhibited Rho/ROCK signaling pathway, which may be the mechanism of HBO treatment
  on regulating TJ proteins. Arrows indicate activation and lines with bars inhibition.
  For details, see text. HBO, hyperbaric oxygen; SCI, spinal cord injury.
