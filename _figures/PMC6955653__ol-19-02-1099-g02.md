caption: 'Role of lncRNAs and circRNAs in osteosarcoma. In general, lncRNAs and circRNAs
  act as sponges for miRNAs, causing its inactivation and favoring tumor development.
  Therefore, MAULTI acts by suppressing miR-129-5p which leads to activation of the
  RET-AKT signaling pathway; HOXD-AS1 suppresses the tumor suppressing action of p57
  protein; TAG1 suppresses miR-212-3p, whereas SNHG1 suppresses miR-101-3p, which
  results in activation of ROCK1 gene expression. All these events favor the development
  of osteosarcoma. However, lncRNA SRA1 acts by suppressing miR-208a, inhibiting its
  tumorigenic action. Additionally, has-circRNA-101801 circRNA acts by suppressing
  miRNAs: has-miR-338-3p, has-miR-370-3p and has-miR-877-3p resulting in increased
  expression of HIF-1 and VEGF, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway activation, thus favoring
  angiogenesis. Furthermore, circRNA TAD2A suppresses miR-203a-3p, which leads to
  increased CREB expression. This favors tumor development in both cases. circRNA,
  circular RNA; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA.'
