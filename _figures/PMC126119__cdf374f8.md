caption: Fig. 8. RA-induced degradation of RARγ2 by the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.
  Upon ligand binding, RARγ2/RXR heterodimers bound to a RAR response element (step 1)
  recruit coactivators that decompact chromatin and allow the recruitment of the general
  transcription machinery at the promoter. Then RARγ2 becomes phosphorylated at Ser66
  or Ser68 by the cdk7 subunit of TFIIH (step 2). Assembly of the transcription initiation
  complex leads to transcription initiation. After 24 h of RA treatment, p38MAPK is
  activated (step 3), resulting in the increase of the phosphorylation of both serine
  residues located in the AF-1 domain (step 4). This acts as a signal for ubiquitylation
  (step 5) and subsequent recognition and degradation (step 6) by proteasomal SUG-1
  bound to the AF-2 domain.
