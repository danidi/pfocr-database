caption: Proposed protective mechanism of XG on IL-1β-stimulated temporomandibular
  chondrocytes. IL-1β increased the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6, as well as the expression
  of MCP-1, iNOS and MMPs, but reduced the expression of collagens. XG may reduce
  the IL-1β-induced effects by inhibiting the Pin1/NF-κB signaling pathway. XG, xanthan
  gum; IL, interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; MCP-1, monocyte chemoattractive
  protein-1; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases;
  Pin1, peptidyl-prolyl isomerase 1; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB.
