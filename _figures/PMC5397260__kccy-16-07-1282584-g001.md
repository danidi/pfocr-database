caption: 'Mechanism of action of GEMs. Schematic comparing and contrasting key features
  of canonical (GPCR-triggered, left) and non-canonical (GEM-triggered, right) heterotrimeric
  G protein signaling. Left: Canonical activation of heterotrimeric G proteins is
  spatially and temporally restricted, i.e., triggered exclusively by agonist activated
  G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (signal input), may either lead to inhibition
  or stimulation of adenylate cyclase and cAMP production (signal output) depending
  on whether inhibitory Giαβγ or stimulatory Gsαβγ heterotrimers are activated, respectively.
  Such activation is triggered primarily at the plasma membrane (PM) via a finite
  process that is rapid and completes within a few hundred milliseconds, and may continue
  on PM-contiguous endocytic compartments. Right: Non-canonical G protein signaling
  that is triggered by GEMs are characterized by 4 key differences (from top to bottom)
  – (A) GEMs can coordinately modulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling downstream
  of diverse classes of receptors (signal input). (B) GEMs can activate monomeric
  Giα (as a GEF) or inhibit stimulatory Gsα (as a GDI) using the same short motif,
  thereby coordinately reducing cellular cAMP. The monomeric Gα substrate could either
  be a byproduct of GPCR signaling or actively released from Gi/sαβγ trimers by displacement
  of Gβγ heterodimers or GoLoco/GPR motif containing GDIs. (C) Being cytosolic in
  localization, GEMs can act upon heterotrimeric G proteins on both PM and internal
  membranes that are non-contiguous with the PM, e.g., Golgi and autophagosomes. (D)
  Signaling that is triggered by GEMs appears to be delayed (initiated after several
  minutes) and prolonged, lasting several minutes to hours (reviewed in). Note: The
  spatiotemporal features listed here exclusively refer to the nature of heterotrimeric
  G protein activation within each paradigm, and do not refer to other downstream
  signals initiated within each pathway (like MAPK or Akt), or downstream gene transcription/translation
  responses that are typically delayed, or effects on the cytoskeleton or organelles
  that are brought about directly or indirectly via downstream intermediates within
  the signaling cascades.'
