caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the dual role of PP2A complex. PP2A complex
  attenuates the proliferative signals transduced via the AKT/mTOR pathway. Activation
  of PP2A is dependent on ER-induced BRCA1 expression. Attenuation mechanism following
  (A) haploinsufficiency or loss of function of ER or BRCA1 or (B) increased expression
  of the inhibitory regulatory subunit, alpha4. Alpha4 sequestrated the PP2A complex,
  maintaining AKT/mTOR signals and shifts the specificity of the PP2A-alpha4 complex
  towards pro-survival signals, via dephosphorylation of p53.
