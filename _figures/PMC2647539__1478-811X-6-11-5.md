caption: FasL proteolytic processing. Recent data suggest that FasL is processed by
  ADAM10 and RIPped by SPPL2a generating a free intracellular ICD. This ICD is assumed
  to translocate to the nucleus and to regulate gene expression, a process resembling
  the well characterised Notch signalling pathway. Since FasL is known to associate
  with SH3 domain proteins and since these interactions significantly affect FasL
  biology, including sorting, activation-induced release and reverse signalling, further
  studies have to determine how the processing of FasL affects interactions with SH3
  domain proteins. Furthermore, it is unclear to date, which interactions regulate
  the trafficking of processed FasL fragments.
