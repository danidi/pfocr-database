caption: Figure 1. Most immune therapies of cancer increase the number of tumor specific
  CD8+ T cells by ex vivo amplification or stimulate the amplification of tumor specific
  CD8+ T cells in lymphoid organs through vaccine strategies (blue pathways). In contrast,
  treatment with pegylated interleukin-10 (IL-10) induces simultaneously the amplification
  of autochthonous tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and their cytotoxic activation within
  the tumor, in the absence of trafficking to and from lymphoid organ (red pathway).
  To achieve tumor rejection, IL-10 signals are required only within CD8+ T cells
  and not in other cells of the immune system.
