caption: 'Effects of growth hormone (GH) on the vascular endothelium. The interaction
  GH–GHR (growth hormone receptor) produces the activation of the associated Janus
  kinase 2 (JAK2), which induces the phosphorylation (red circles) of tyrosine located
  in the cytoplasmic receptor domain, leading to the phosphorylation of GH-signaling
  pathways, such as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATS). Among
  STATS (STATS 1 and 3 not shown in the Figure), STAT5 homodimerizes and is translocated
  to the nucleus, where it induces the transcription of a series of genes. Activated
  JAK2, acting on the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) induces the phosphorylation
  of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) which, in turn, activates the cell survival
  factor serine-threonine kinase (Akt). This inhibits the proapoptotic enzyme Caspase
  3 (red arrow), but it also activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (blue
  arrow). Activated eNOS promotes the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) (from L-Arginine
  and O2) and the formation of L-Citrulline. The formed NO flows from the cytoplasm
  to the muscle cell layer of the blood vessels, producing its relaxation and consequent
  vasodilation. The interaction GH–GHR also induces the activation of the Shc adapter
  proteins, which leads to the activation of the Grb2–SOS–Ras–Raf–MEK–ERK (extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase) pathway (Raf is not shown in the figure). Activated ERK
  translocates into the nucleus of the endothelial cells (ECs) and regulates the expression
  of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, but it also
  regulates cell motility and migration (key for the formation of new vessels). The
  GH–GHR interaction also activates focal adhesion kinase (FAK). SHP: protein tyrosine
  phosphatase. Blue arrows: stimulation. Red arrow: inhibition. Black arrows: Translocation
  to the nucleus. 1: endocrine GH. 2: endothelial GH: plays and auto/paracrine role
  and in situations of the absence of endocrine GH perhaps plays the role of the former
  (black line).'
