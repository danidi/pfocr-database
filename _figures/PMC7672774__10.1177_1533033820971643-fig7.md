caption: The schematic cartoon of the mechanism of miR-103a as a tumor suppressor
  by modulating the OTUB1/Hippo signaling pathway in CSCs in NSCLC. After YAP phosphorylation,
  Hippo signaling pathway is blunted to promote proliferation, migration, invasion
  and sphere formation of CSCs and to inhibit their apoptosis in NSCLC. Overexpression
  of miR-103a inhibits the expression of OTUB1 and induces the Hippo signaling pathway,
  thereby inhibiting the stemness of CSCs in NSCLC.
