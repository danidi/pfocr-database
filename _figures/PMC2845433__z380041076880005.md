caption: Model of food intake and body weight regulation in KOR-KO mice. KOR signaling
  pathway is permissive to fat storage when a calorically dense, high-fat diet is
  consumed. It is likely that changes in energy expenditure and fatty acid metabolism
  in KOR-KO mice are mediated by the CNS since KOR was absent from key peripheral
  tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue. Documented
  changes in the dopamine signaling pathway in KOR-KO mice  provide a potential common
  mechanism by which dietary intake, locomotor activity, and energy expenditure may
  be simultaneously altered. Loss of KORs in the adrenal glands may contribute to
  the compensatory up-regulation of lipogenic genes observed in KOR-deficient mice.
