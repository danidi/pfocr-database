caption: Phosphatidic acid is synthesized in multiple steps from glycerol-3-phosphate
  (obtained from glycolysis or the phosphorylation of glycerol) and fatty acyl-CoA.
  It is the precursor of diacylglycerol and the liponucleotide CDP-diacylglycerol,
  both of which are used for phospholipid biosynthesis. Phospholipids are synthesized
  by pathways that use a CDP-alcohol as an activated precursor. The activated lipid
  tail CDP-diacylglycerol is used, for example, in the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol
  (PI) in eukaryotes and PI-phosphates in prokaryotes. Alternatively, a water-soluble
  CDP-alcohol, e.g. CDP-choline or CDP-ethanolamine, is combined with diacylglycerol
  to generate phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Diacylglycerol
  is also used for the synthesis of the neutral lipid triacylglycerol. CDS, cytidine-diphosphate
  diacylglycerol synthase; CPT, cholinephosphotransferase; CEPT, choline/ethanolamine
  phosphotransferase; DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase; EPT, ethanolamine phosphotransferase;
  PIS, phosphatidylinositol synthase.
