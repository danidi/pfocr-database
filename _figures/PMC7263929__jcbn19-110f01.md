caption: A schematic diagram explains glucose metabolism of normal differentiated
  cells vs cancer cells. Normal differentiated cells can either catabolize glucose
  to CO2 and water via oxidative phosphorylation under oxygen sufficient conditions
  or to lactic acid mainly under hypoxic conditions. This generates up to 36 ATP vs
  2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule respectively. However, cancerous cells catabolize
  glucose to lactic acid regardless of oxygen availability, a phenomenon titled as
  “Warburg effect” or “Aerobic glycolysis”. Multiple consecutive arrows indicate different
  metabolic steps and thick arrows depict the main metabolic pathway used in the cell.
