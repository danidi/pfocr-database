caption: 'Cytokine-induced differentiation of human B cells in vitro: requirement
  for IL-21 signaling in vivo. In vitro studies demonstrated that human B cells could
  undergo events such as Ig class switching and differentiation to become Ig-secreting
  cells following stimulation with a diverse range of cytokines. However, analysis
  of individuals with hypomorphic mutations in genes encoding STAT3, γc (IL2RG), JAK3,
  or IL-21R have revealed that this pathway – activated by IL-21 – is critical for
  the generation of memory B cells and the establishment of Ag-specific Abs in vivo.
  Thus, although cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, and BAFF/APRIL are strong B-cell
  growth and differentiation factors, their function is insufficient to compensate
  for impaired IL-21/IL-21R signaling in vivo in the setting of generating robust,
  long-lived Ag-specific Ab, and memory responses. Consequently, IL-21-mediated B-cell
  activation is a necessary and sufficient step in the generation of protective long-lived
  humoral immune responses in humans.'
