caption: '5-HT stored in platelets or loaded into nerve fibres/cells within the circulation,
  skin, primary/secondary lymphoid tissues and even possibly the CNS is released on
  appropriate immune/inflammatory (stress/emotional?) activation. Immune cells exposed
  to 5-HT flow respond via receptors (up to 14 potentially, majority of which are
  7-transmembrane domain (TMD) G-coupled proteins; 5-HT3 is a 4TMD cation ion channel)
  and/or the serotonin transporter, serotonin transporter (SERT; also a target for
  the SSRI antidepressants that block 5-HT uptake). Novel SERT-mediated signalling
  pathway recently described by Walther and colleagues in platelets (15) may also
  operate in immune cells where direct SERT-driven change has been shown (11, 13):
  transported 5-HT via transglutaminase (TGase) used to ‘serotonylate’ small GTPases
  such as RhoA and Rab4, both of which impact lymphocyte (and other immune cell) effector
  function.'
