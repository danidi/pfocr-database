caption: Molecular pathways leading to cross-presentation in DCs. DCs take up Ag by
  three general mechanisms, receptor-mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis, or macropinocytosis.
  Once the Ag reaches the endolysosomal pathway, depending of the specific routing,
  it may be degraded by the concourse of the mild pH and different types of cathepsins
  and other proteases. At this point, properly degraded Ag can be directly loaded
  into recycling MHC-I in the phagosome (Vacuolar pathway). Ag that still needs further
  processing must be transported to the cytosol (Cytosolic pathway) where it is degraded,
  together with endogenous proteins and DRiPs, by the proteasome. The peptides generated
  by the proteasome are transported by TAP or a yet uncharacterized transporter into
  the ER where they are loaded into MHC-I with the help of the peptide-loading complex.
  Further trimming in the ER prior to loading, it is possible by the presence of ER-localized
  endopeptidases (ERAP1 and 2). R, ribosome; CNX, calnexin; CRT, calreticulin; b2m,
  b2microglobulin; UGT1, UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1; ERAP1/2,
  ER-aminopeptidases 1/2; PLC, peptide-loading complex; ERp57, protein disulfide isomerase
  3; TAP1/2, transporter associated with antigen-presenting 1/2; DRiPs, defective
  ribosomal products; ROS, reactive oxygen species; NOX2, NADPH oxidase 2; CLR, C-type
  lectins; FcR, Fc receptors; SR, scavenger receptors.
