caption: Schematic representation of molecular events associated with the repressive
  effect induced by PTCH1 receptor on the SMO activity and the activation of the Hh
  signaling pathway mediated by the SHH protein in the primary cilium. a, in the absence
  of the SHH ligand, PTCH1 is localized at the base of the ciliary structure and inhibits
  SMO protein translocation to the primary cilium and its activation. In the absence
  of activated SMO protein, the negative modulator of Hh cascade SUFU sequesters full-length
  GLI proteins in the cytoplasm and prevents their nuclear translocation, Hh target
  gene expression, and induction of a cellular response. Moreover, the cytoplasmic
  GLI proteins also may be degraded through the proteasomal pathway, and the GLI3
  protein cleaved into a C-terminal fragment (GLI3R) that acts as a nuclear transcriptional
  repressor of Hh gene expression. b, the binding of the mature and lipid-modified
  SHH protein to the PTCH1 receptor in the primary cilium leads to its translocation
  out of the ciliary structure and retrieves its repressive effect on the SMO protein
  localized in intracellular vesicles or plasma membrane out of the primary cilium.
  These molecular events culminate in SMO translocation into the primary cilium and
  activation of downstream signaling elements, GLI proteins localized in the primary
  cilium. The negative modulator of GLI proteins, SUFU protein, is then degraded by
  the proteasomal pathway, and the activated GLI zinc-finger transcriptional activators,
  GLI1 or GLI2 molecules, are translocated to nucleus and participate to the up-regulation
  of Hh target gene expression, including GLI1 and PTCH1, and induction of a cellular
  response.
