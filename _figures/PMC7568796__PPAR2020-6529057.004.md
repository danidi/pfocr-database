caption: Model of downregulated PPARγ signaling in psoriasis. PPARγ which expression
  is downregulated in psoriasis is colored blue. Regulators that may inhibit the expression
  of PPARγ (data based on PPI and pathway functional analysis) are colored in violet.
  Targets which may be overexpressed in psoriasis due to the decrease of the negative
  impact of PPARγ are colored in bright red. FOXP3, STAT3, IL17A, RORC, and FOSL1
  are highlighted according to own experiments (read section “Preliminary analysis
  of PPARγ signaling in human psoriatic skin”). Downexpressed genes (PPARγ and FOXP3)
  are highlighted in blue, and overexpressed genes are highlighted in red.
