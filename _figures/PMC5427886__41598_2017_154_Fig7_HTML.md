caption: Nitric Oxide generated through microwave plasma penetrates inside the cell
  through the cell membrane that activates the myogenic specific gene as well as protein
  via a oxidative related signaling pathway, which leads to cell proliferation and
  differentiation in L6 skeletal muscle cells.
