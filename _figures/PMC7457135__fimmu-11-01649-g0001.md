caption: Protective and detrimental roles of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
  (mtROS) during infection. (A) Majority of mtROS are generated by oxidative phosphorylation
  (OXPHOS) complexes I and III in macrophages activated through TLR signaling, interferon
  (IFN)-γ, and microbial infection. Both Mst1 and Mst2 promoted Toll-like receptor
  (TLR)-mediated assembly of the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor
  6–evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathway (TRAF6-ECSIT)
  complex, to enhance antibacterial killing effects through mtROS. IFN-γ signaling
  activates estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) to enhance antimicrobial clearance
  through mtROS generation. mtROS are closely related to the pathways of autophagy
  and inflammasome, both essential in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and
  activation of innate host defense. 5′ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibits,
  but hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α enhances, the generation of mtROS, thereby
  influencing innate defense against several pathogenic bacteria. HIF-1α/mTOR signaling
  drives aerobic glycolysis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation; mTOR inhibition
  leads to the enhancement of mtROS to promote host defense against Trypanosoma cruzi
  infection. AMPK activation by metformin is beneficial in the clearance of intracellular
  bacterial infection through phosphorylation of AMPK and mtROS generation. In addition,
  AMPK is the upstream kinase for ERRα-mediated antimicrobial responses during Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. During oxidative stress, NRF2 translocates to the
  nucleus after dissociation from Keap1 to induce the expression of protective antioxidant
  genes. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) activation results in the expression
  of COX5B, which inhibit the mtROS to block the MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling.
  mtROS involvement in antiviral responses is described in the text in details. (B)
  Uncontrolled mtROS production leads to excessive inflammatory responses, tissue
  damage, and necrosis, thus detrimental to host defense. Dysregulated activation
  of NLRP3 inflammasome results in tissue damage and pathological inflammation through
  mitochondrial dysfunction and mtROS generation. Several host factors [sirtuin 3
  (SIRT3), miR-23a, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ)]
  are negative regulators for controlling excessive mtROS generation, thereby coordinating
  antimicrobial host defense. Excessive ROS production blocks the nuclear translocation
  and activity of NRF2. The accumulation of mtROS, which is also mediated by sustained
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, is detrimental to host defense.
