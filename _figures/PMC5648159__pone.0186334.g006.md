caption: We provide novel data that demonstrate that activation of FFAR2 can activate
  LATS1 (repressor of YAP1), which results in an increase in E-cadherin levels. In
  contrast, FFAR3 activity inhibits the MAP/ERK pathway. These processes are likely
  to underlie the repressive effect of short chain fatty acid receptors on breast
  cancer cell invasion.
