caption: Hypothesised model of the hydrosensation signalling pathway, i.e., a transmembrane
  hydrosensory information transduction pathway. The receptor-like guanylate cyclase
  DAF-11 may be activated directly or indirectly via G proteins through GPCR signalling,
  resulting in an increase in cytosolic cGMP levels that opens the CNG channels.
