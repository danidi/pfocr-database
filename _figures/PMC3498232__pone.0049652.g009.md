caption: 'The catalysis by Prx, SOD and NADPH oxidase (also called Rboh) lead to ROS
  accumulation (1, 2A,), and Rboh activity is controlled by the small GTPase (2B)
  that were positively regulated with PLD-derived PA (2C) and GAP proteins (2D), and
  negatively regulated by GDI2 (2E). PLD is a component of ABA signaling pathway to
  activate SAPK (3) and is the key point at which ethylene and ABA showed negative
  interplay (4). ABA can be diffused through ABC transporters (5). In ethylene signaling
  pathway, EIN3 activates ERF genes (6), and was degraded by the UPS (7). The UPS
  reglated plant growth and stress tolerance (8). ROS could be abolished by PrxR,
  AOX (9), CAT, APX (10) and P450 (11). The CAT and APX genes were trans-activated
  by ERF (12) and HSF (13). ROS activate calcium influx channel (14A), and stimulates
  Ca2+ release from internal Ca2+ stores (14B). Ca2+ stimulates CaM (14C), which activates
  HSF activity (14D). ROS stimulate HSF (15) and NAC (16). ROS exert negative regulation
  on auxin signaling pathway that is suppressed by SAUR and stimulated by nitrilase,
  respectively (17). Furthermore, ROS could be diffused through aquaporin (18). The
  HR genes in the present study were mapped on this model. The color bar represents
  the log2 transformed relative expression level on the time course of heat treatment
  (from left to right: 20 min, 60 min, 2 h, 4 h, and 8 h in sequence). The color scale
  is shown at the right. Blue: down-regulation, red: up-regulation.'
