caption: Cartoon depiction of a neuronal post-synapse. Previously reported Homer2-interacting
  proteins that were significantly enriched in WT samples are colored green and novel
  proteins are colored orange. The majority of Homer2-interacting proteins are NMDAR
  subunits or part of the NMDAR signaling pathway (gray area). Homer2 is not included
  as an interacting protein because our co-IP experiments cannot differentiate Homer2
  proteins directly bound by the antibody from Homer2 homomultimers. Literature references
  for the involvement of these proteins in the NMDAR signaling pathway are included
  in .
