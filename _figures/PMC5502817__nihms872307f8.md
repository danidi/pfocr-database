caption: Proposed mechanism for the action of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) on enhancing
  the outcome of exercise post-TBI. The flavone derivative 7,8-DHF acts on the BDNF
  receptor TrkB to increase levels of GAP-43 and Syn I. TrkB phosphorylation upregulates
  molecular systems involved in cellular energy and metabolic pathways such as PGC-1α
  and COII -- key component involved in the final step of oxidative metabolism thereby
  controlling ATP production. The activation of transcriptional machinery can increase
  mitochondrial function by involving the energy sensor, AMPK. Intervention with 7,8-DHF
  and exercise increased hippocampal functional connectivity following TBI. The fact
  that 7,8-DHF affects the BDNF-TrkB pathway is critical for regulation of synaptic
  plasticity and energy metabolism. The effects of 7,8-DHF and exercise were significant
  to influence functional connectivity, which provides a reading of functionality
  of neural circuits. Collectively, the mechanism illustrated can provide basis for
  using 7,8-DHF to support physical rehabilitation to accelerate functional recovery
  and heightening cognitive ability after TBI.
