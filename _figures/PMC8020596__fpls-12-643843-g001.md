caption: Sugar signaling in regulating plant fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis. High
  levels of cellular sugars (carbon) are associated with the accumulation of trehalose
  6-phosphate (T6P), which binds to KIN10 (shown as small molecule superimposed on
  KIN10), the catalytic subunit of SnRK1, weakening its affinity for GRIK. This results
  in decreased phosphorylation of the KIN10 activation loop, thereby reducing the
  proportion of activated KIN10. Under low KIN10 activity, WRI1 is more stable and
  activates the transcription of genes involved in glycolysis and fatty acid (FA)
  synthesis such as BCCP, KAS (3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase), and PKP1β
  (plastidial pyruvate kinase 1 beta), promoting FA biosynthesis. DGAT1 is also more
  active and catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA to triacylglycerol
  (TAG). Conversely, when the cellular sugar levels are low, levels of T6P decrease,
  and GRIK binds tightly to KIN10, phosphorylating its activation loop and increasing
  SnRK1 activity. Activated KIN10 phosphorylates WRI1 and causes its degradation via
  the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway (UPP) to amino acids (AA), thereby reducing FA
  synthesis. Activated KIN10 also phosphorylates DGAT1, inhibiting its enzyme activity,
  reducing TAG synthesis. High levels of cellular sugars are also associated with
  the accumulation of TCA cycle intermediates including 2-OG, which binds to PII protein
  (shown as small molecule superimposed on PII), disrupting its interaction with BCCP.
  This blocks the ability of PII to inhibit ACCase activity, thereby promoting FA
  biosynthesis. Conversely, when the cellular carbon level is low, the level of 2-OG
  decreases, and PII binds tightly to BCCP inhibiting ACCase activity and consequently
  FA biosynthesis.

  description: Sugar signaling in regulating plant fatty acid and TAG biosynthesis.
    High levels of cellular sugars (carbon) are associated with the accumulation of
