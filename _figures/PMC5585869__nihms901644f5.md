caption: BCR–ABL pathway drives signaling in H929 cells and phosphorylation is inhibited
  by imatinib. Additionally, short incubation with imatinib regulates transcription
  through increased phosphorylation of RNA splicing factors, causing abrogation of
  nascent RNA production and inhibition of RNA degradation. Inhibition of newly formed
  RNA results in RNA mononucleotide accumulation and inhibition of the glucose-driven
  metabolic pathways (glycolysis and PPP) through acetyl-CoA. This results in a decrease
  in fatty acid and lipid biosynthesis.
