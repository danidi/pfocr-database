caption: (A) The nuclear receptor co‐activator AIB1 and the Hippo pathway co‐activator
  YAP converge upon TEAD‐binding sites for transcription activation and repression.
  A subset of AIB1/YAP co‐repressed genes at the 1q21.3 locus is regulated by AIB1
  recruitment of the tumor suppressor ANCO1. (B) YAP‐TEAD complexes are recruited
  to a subset of estrogen response elements (EREs) via an interaction with the ER
  and are required for estrogen‐induced transcription and breast cancer progression.
  The right panel (bounded by a dotted line) provides a hypothetical model of AIB1‐ER
  and YAP‐TEAD interactions within an enhancer with adjacent ERE and Hippo response
  elements (HRE).
