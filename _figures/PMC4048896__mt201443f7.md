caption: Model for TLR9 signaling in primary B cells in response to plasmid nucleofection.
  Plasmid molecules are sensed by the endosomal DNA receptor TLR9. The resulting conformational
  change in TLR9 recruits the cytoplasmic adapter MyD88, resulting in induction of
  proinflammatory cytokine gene expression via the NF-κB pathway. The AP-3 complex
  interacts with activated TLR9 and facilitates its trafficking to the IRF7 endosome,
  whereby TLR9/MyD88 is able to activate interferon response factors that induce transcription
  of type I IFN genes. AP, adaptor protein; IRF, interferon regulatory factor; TLR,
  toll-like receptor.
