caption: MVA Pathway in Plant Cells and Putative Roles for HMGR in Nodulation.(A)
  The steps of the cytoplasmic isoprenoid synthesis with indication of the relevant
  intermediates and important end products (in italics and underlined). The enzymatic
  reaction catalyzed by HMGR (boxed) is shown as well as inhibition of HMGR by lovastatin.(B)
  Model for potential implications of HMGR1 via NORK in nodule development. See text
  for details.
