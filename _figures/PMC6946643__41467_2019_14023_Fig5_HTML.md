caption: The elevated gene expression is marked with a pink arrow, whereas the gene
  with decreased expression is labeled with a purple arrow. Solid lines represent
  direct or indirect connections. Not all details of pathway are shown in this diagram
  in order to simplify the model; more details are in the text. SS starch synthesis,
  PPDK pyruvate phosphate dikinase, ENO cytosolic enolase, FRK fructokinase, PGLS
  6-phosphogluconolactonase, UPR unfolded protein response, ER endoplasmic reticulum,
  PFP phosphoenolpyruvate, HSPs heat shock proteins, ERDJ3A DnaJ protein.
