caption: Graphical illustration of selected biological processes and canonical pathways
  altered in the coconut oil group when compared to the rapeseed oil (UPR, sirtuin
  signaling pathway) and beef tallow groups (LXR/RXR activation, cholesterol metabolism,
  bile secretion). Coconut oil contains antibacterial and anti-inflammatory ingredients
  (lauric acids, polyphenols), and cholesterol metabolism and bile acid secretion
  are not reduced as a result of increased inflammation, which is observed in the
  beef tallow group.
