caption: The Isoleucine Biosynthesis pathway diagram. The pathway layout is retrieved
  from the MetaCyc database. For each reaction we list the genes that can catalyze
  the reaction. A plus or minus sign indicates if the gene was assigned to the pathway
  in SGD. The expression profiles and their similarity score are shown for selected
  pairs of genes. Mapping between gene names and Biozon identifiers is given in Table
  6.
