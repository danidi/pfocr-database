caption: Known host targets of phleboviral NSs proteins in retinoic acid-inducible
  gene 1 (RIG-I) signaling and type I IFN induction. Incoming phleboviral RNPs are
  sensed by RIG-I, potentially leading to interferon induction via mitochondrial antiviral
  signaling (MAVS)-mediated activation of the transcription factors interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells
  (NF-κB). NSs proteins, however, mediate the escape from the induction and the antiviral
  effects of the IFN system. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) NSs acts in the nucleus,
  where it blocks both the transcription and the export of host mRNAs. Toscana virus
  (TOSV) NSs localizes to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with and induces proteasomal
  degradation of RIG-I. Characteristic cytoplasmic structures are formed by severe
  fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) NSs and serve as site of sequestration
  for several signaling factors of the RIG-I pathway. Punta Toro virus (PTV) NSs also
  inhibits host transcription.
