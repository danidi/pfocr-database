caption: Model of calcium-mediated induction of myocardin expression in VSMCs. This
  is based on the work presented in this report and previously published observations.
  MEF2-dependent myocardin expression is regulated by p38 MAPK and RhoA-induced derepression
  of PP1α by CPI-17. Myocardin activates SRF-dependent VSMC gene expression directly
  and by dimerizing with myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs) that translocate
  to the nucleus when G- actin polymerizes to form F-actin.
