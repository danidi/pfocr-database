caption: 'Schematic representation of different ratios of STAT3α/STAT3β and their
  functions in therapy sensitivity. (a) The STAT3 signaling pathway confers therapy
  resistance to cells, mainly by mediating its target genes for cell survival, proliferation
  and inhibition of apoptosis. It promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, restores
  cancer stem cell properties, enhances DNA repair and attenuates ROS levels. RTK
  inhibitors can augment cell survival and proliferation via feedback activation of
  STAT3. Thus, in combination with RTK inhibitors, STAT3 inhibitors can be an effective
  strategy for therapy resistance. (b) STAT3β activation is better for cell growth
  inhibition and apoptosis, in contrast with STAT3α functions. Switch regulation for
  STAT3α to STAT3β is a challenging approach for resensitization to chemotherapy.
  In the context of a high expression level of STAT3β, RTK inhibitors that activate
  STAT3 via a feedback loop may be of benefit for cell apoptosis. Abbreviations: AKT,
  protein kinase B; CSCs, cancer stem cells; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor;
  EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; JAK, Janus kinase; P, phosphorylation; PCBP1,
  poly-C binding protein-1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RTKi, receptor tyrosine
  kinase inhibitor; RTKs, receptor tyrosine kinases; STAT3, signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3.'
