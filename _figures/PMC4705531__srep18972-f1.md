caption: RvD4 is formed via a proposed 4,5-epoxide intermediate in a stereo-controlled
  manner confirmed by matching with synthetic compound. Enzymatic hydrolysis at the
  C-5 position to open the epoxide produces the 4S,5R hydroxy-containing RvD3, or
  enzymatic attack at the C-11 position affords the 4S,11R hydroxy-containing RvD4.
