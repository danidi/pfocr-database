caption: The modulatory effects of leptin and adiponectin on glucose metabolism in
  cancer cells. Glucose metabolism is profoundly remodeled in tumor cells, characterized
  by upregulation of glucose uptake and glycolytic pathway. Leptin promotes glycolysis
  by elevating expression and membrane translocation of glucose transporters (GLUTs),
  as well as increased expression of key enzymes in this pathway, including hexokinase,
  the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). In
  addition, leptin increases expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH),
  leading to upregulation of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for generating nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), pentose, and ribose-5-phosphate. In contrast,
  adiponectin appears to counteract the Warburg effect. Through activation of AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK), it is assumed that adiponectin downregulates LDHA to inhibit
  the production of lactate from pyruvate but also reduces expression of pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), a suppressor of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC),
  to increase the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Enlarged arrows denote the
  metabolic pathways activated by leptin/adiponectin.
