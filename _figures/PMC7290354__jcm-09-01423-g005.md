caption: The PI3K/Akt pathway can be activated in different ways, as for example by
  G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), integrin or cytokine receptors and it represents
  a mediator between ECM and fibroblasts’ cell cycle. In this figure, PI3K-dependent
  phosphorylation and activation of Akt is represented, which in turn leads to enhanced
  proliferation and cell survival. Furthermore, apoptosis is regulated, and vasodilatation
  is promoted.
