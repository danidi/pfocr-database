caption: 'Suggested model for the interactions of soluble urate– and monosodium urate
  crystal–driven inflammation in gout and comorbidities. Soluble urate primes circulating
  monocytes acting through upregulation of the Pras40‐Akt‐mTOR pathway with upregulation
  of IL‐1β and specific downregulation of IL‐1Ra. Supra‐saturated serum urate leads
  to crystallization of urate into MSU and deposition of crystals in tissues which
  drives resident macrophage activation, tissue damage, and release of DAMPs and more
  urate. During a gout attack, circulating monocytes arrive at the site of tissue
  inflammation where, upon contact with MSU crystals, they become activated. Monocytes
  already primed by serum urate can readily secrete IL‐1β after encountering DAMPs
  and MSU crystals, which activate the inflammasome and processing of pro‐IL‐1β. This
  leads to enhanced IL‐1β secretion and pyroptosis in the context of low IL‐1Ra antagonism.
  Non‐primed circulating monocytes could potentially also become primed upon MSU crystal
  encounter. Upon tissue damage and pyroptosis, more urate is released which can further
  prime new monocytes, perpetuating inflammation and tissue damage during a gout flare.
  In the circulation, primed monocytes can readily secrete IL‐1β in response to second
  activation by stimuli, shifting the immune response toward pro‐inflammation with
  long‐term predisposition for comorbidities. Akt: protein kinase B; mTOR: mammalian
  target of rapamycin; IL: interleukin; MSU: monosodium urate; DAMPs: damage‐associated
  molecular patterns'
