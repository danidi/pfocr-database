caption: Schematic diagrams of Wingless and Arm structure, and pathway relationships.
  (A) Wingless structure based on the crystal structure for XWnt8 (). Wingless has
  a longer N-terminal region and an 85 amino acid insert (red lines) relative to vertebrate
  Wnt molecules; the 85 amino acid region can be deleted without disrupting Wg activity
  (). Approximate positions of wg mutations (; ; ) are indicated in red. Cylinders
  represent alpha helices, block arrows indicate beta-sheets and dotted lines indicate
  positions of disulfide bonds (after ). (B) Schematic diagram of Armadillo/beta-catenin.
  The N-terminal region contains phosphorylation sites for CK1 and Zw3/GSK3beta kinase
  (dark starbursts), which target it for degradation. The central Arm repeats provide
  protein interaction domains for a variety of binding partners. Regions of Arm/beta-catenin
  where binding partners interact are shown as lines, with partners that favor signaling
  shown above and those that oppose it shown below. Phosphorylation sites that correlate
  with activation of Arm/beta-catenin, rather than destruction, are depicted as light
  starbursts. The C-terminal region is dispensable for Arm/beta-catenin’s adhesion
  function but is essential for its Wg/Wnt signaling activity. (C) Schematic diagram
  of the Wingless signaling pathway. Wg structure is based on a space-filling model
  (from ), showing glycosylation modifications (light gray) and palmitate group (white)
  projecting into Frizzed CRD. Wg binding to Fz and Arrow brings them together and
  this recruits Dsh to the membrane. The PDZ and DIX domains are protein-interaction
  motifs that are essential for Wg signaling. Dsh somehow inactivates the destruction
  complex, perhaps by bringing Axin to the membrane where it is degraded. The destruction
  complex is composed of the Axin and Apc scaffolding molecules, which bring CK1 and
  Zw3/GSK3beta kinase together with Arm/beta-catenin. Apc has multiple protein interaction
  motifs including Arm repeats (light green) and Arm/beta-catenin binding domain repeats
  (dark green), as well as an oligomerization domain at the N-terminus and domains
  that allow microtubule association at the C-terminus. Phosphorylation of Arm/beta-catenin’s
  N-terminal domain (P) targets it for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome.
  When the destruction complex is inactivated by receptor/Dsh activity, Arm/beta-catenin
  is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus where it binds the N-terminus of Tcf,
  displacing the Groucho co-repressor and recruiting activators to drive target gene
  expression.
