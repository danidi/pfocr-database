caption: A model summarizing the role of the HH signalling pathway and its primary
  transducer, GLI2, during mES cell cardiomyogenesis. a In this study, GLI2 expression
  was observed to positively regulate cardiac progenitor-enriched genes in mES cells
  (highlighted in green). The solid black arrows indicate HH/GLI2’s proposed direct
  regulation. The hollow green arrow marks the transition that is enhanced by GLI2.
  b GLI2-regulated enrichment of cardiac progenitor transcripts may be explained in
  part by the ability of the transcriptional activator form of GLI2 (GLI2A) (light
  green ellipses, B) - mediated via a functional HH signalling pathway (light blue
  ellipses) - to enrich BRG1 association at GLI2-specific Mef2c site C. This enrichment
  site is proximal to known SHF enhancer regions (I,II). Other cofactors (dash-outlined
  ellipses), including the remaining BAF complex members and other unidentified SHF-related
  transcription factors (?) may support this GLI2-mediated association. c When KAAD-cyclopamine
  inhibits HH signalling, GLI2 is likely degraded, which leads to a reduction of BRG1
  association on Mef2c site C. Although we have not observed the formation of GLI2R
  in our system (data not shown), it is possible that GLI2 may be processed into GLI2R
  (orange truncated ellipses, C) when HH signalling is blocked []. Also, GLI3R (included
  in the orange truncated ellipses, C) may contribute to the repression of Mef2c expression.
  The downstream binding of either GLI2R or GLI3R to Mef2c has yet to be assessed
