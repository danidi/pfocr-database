number: Figure 5
caption: 'Top: Schematic diagram of mouse embryonic development on the indicated days.
  Bottom: The mevalonate pathway produces farnesyl diphosphate for cholesterol synthesis,
  protein geranylgeranylation and protein farnesylation. The farnesylation of various
  proteins, including small G proteins and the nuclear protein Lamin B1, triggers
  primitive streak formation. Statins inhibit the induction of primitive streak genes
  by suppressing protein farnesylation. Consistent with our observations, Hmgcr KO
  mice and FTase KO mice are embryonic lethal at E8.5 and E7.5, respectively.'
