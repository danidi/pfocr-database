caption: Through glycolysis, glucose is converted into 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate, and
  shuttled into the serine synthesis pathway, as the demand for serine is great. Serine
  is then converted into glycine, where, p53 is elevated and activates p21 to promote
  cell cycle arrest and replenish GSH, glutathione. Conversion to inosine monophosphate
  (IMP) and resultant purine biosynthesis is suppressed. GSH pools suppress reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) generated from the TCA cycle. Cells lacking p53 or p21 generate
  IMP instead of replenishing GMP pools and succumb to excessive ROS.
