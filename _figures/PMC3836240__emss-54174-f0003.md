caption: Classical model of basal ganglia pathophysiology in healthy, Parkinsonian,
  and dyskinetic states. The input to BG is from most cortical areas. Output is via
  GPi/SNr, which provides inhibitory input to the thalamus. The direct pathway expresses
  D1 receptors while the indirect pathway expresses D2 receptors. In health, GPi output
  is modulated by competing influences from both direct and indirect pathways. In
  Parkinson’s Disease, death of SNc neurons results in overactivity in the indirect
  pathway and underactivity in the direct pathway leading to heightened GPi output.
  The converse pattern is thought to account for dyskinesia induced by l-dopa therapy.
