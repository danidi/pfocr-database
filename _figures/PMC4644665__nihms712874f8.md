caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of Cthrc1 suppression
  of TGF-β signaling. Cthrc1 is induced by the TGF-β1/phospho-Smad3 signaling pathway,
  and thence accelerates degradation of phospho-Smad3 via proteasome pathway, thus
  forming a negative feedback loop, which inhibits synthesis of pro-fibrotic genes.
