caption: Epithelial cancer cell inflammatory response. Treatment of cells expressing
  ER-Src with tamoxifen (see text) activates Src and elicits a transcriptional response,
  mediated by the transcription factor NF-κB, to drive the expression of Lin28, a
  miRNA binding protein. Lin28 binds to and attenuates the function of let-7 miRNAs,
  which normally control, among others, the translation of the cytokine IL-6. IL-6
  is a potent activator of NF-κB, thereby providing a positive feedback that further
  amplifies the pathway []. In parallel, IL-6 activates another transcription factor,
  signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), to promote the expression
  of miR-21 and miR-181b-1, which inhibit the translation of the tumor suppressors
  PTEN and CYLD, respectively, further enhancing NF-κB activity []. Because NF-κB,
  STAT3 and IL-6 are also players in bona fide inflammatory responses elicited by
  immune cells, this signaling cascade is known as the inflammatory response or inflammatory
  feedback loop, alluding to the self-amplifying nature of the pathway.
