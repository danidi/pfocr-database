caption: Figure 1. The proposed T4SS-dependent activation of miR-155 expression in
  macrophages during H. pylori infection. The T4SS, specific to virulent H. pylori
  strains, induced NFκB dependent miR-155 expression, in addition to the known activation
  by H. pylori MAMPs via TLR and NOD1/-2 pattern recognition receptor signaling. T4SS-dependent
  miR-155 expression, represented by (?), may be directly dependent on an unidentified
  cellular receptor, or on an indirect activation pathway. miR-155 was found to target
  a number of pro-apoptotic genes in macrophages, and conferred an anti-apoptotic
  effect upon infection in the presence of a DNA damage inducing reagent. It is speculated
  that miR-155 expression could prolong macrophage survival in the inflammatory microenvironment,
  which could contribute ultimately to the deregulation of pro-inflammatory responses,
  increased expression of proinflammatory mediators e.g., IL-8 and IL-6 and pathology
  progression observed during H. pylori infection. MAMP, microbe-associated molecular
  pattern; NOD, nucleotide oligomerization domain; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS,
  reactive nitrogen species; T4SS, type IV secretion system; TLR, Toll-like receptor.
