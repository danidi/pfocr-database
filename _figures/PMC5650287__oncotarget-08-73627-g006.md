caption: Energy depletion caused by electro transport chain complexes I and IV defects
  in MELAS syndrome activates the AMPK/PGC-1α/Sirt3 signaling pathway, which turns
  on the catabolic pathway and switches off anabolic metabolism, whereas Complex I
  deficiency and NAD+/NADH imbalance reduces efficiency of fatty acid oxidation. Thus,
  an increase in PDH leads to an increased flux of acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle,
  while a decrease in ACC1 and CPT1 leads to inhibition of fatty acid synthesis and
  reduction of fatty acid oxidation, respectively.
