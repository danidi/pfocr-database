caption: Regulation of macrophage function by polyamine synthesis. In general, once
  activated, M1 macrophages metabolize L-arginine by NOS2 to produce NO while M2 macrophages
  (Mregs, TAMs, MDSCs, M2a) upregulate the ARG1/2-ODC pathway to produce polyamines,
  however, both retain the ability to change activation states. Putrescine downregulates
  transcription of M1 genes including Nos2 and spermine inhibits the translation of
  NOS2, thus hindering an M1 response. Spermine also supports autophagy via ATG5,
  which inhibits M1 polarization while promoting M2 polarization. In contrast, spermidine
  upregulates transcription of Nos2 and can both directly and indirectly inhibit tumor
  growth. TAM survival is mediated by upregulation of ABHD5, which suppresses spermidine
  by inhibiting translation of spermidine synthase (SRM)
