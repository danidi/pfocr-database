caption: Molecular relationship between phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase (PTEN/Akt)
  activation, DNA damage and decreased ovarian reserve. Breast cancer susceptibility
  gene 1 (BRCA1) mutation may lead to compromised DNA repair pathway and eventually
  primordial follicle apoptosis leading to follicle loss and decreased ovarian reserve.
  In addition, mitochondria can be one of the major sources of DNA damage. Excessive
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may harm macromolecules in the cells including
  DNA leading to single-stand breaks (SSBs) or double-strand breaks (DSBs). High ROS
  expression in mitochondria may lead to PTEN inhibition and increase Akt activation.
  This may eventually further increase ROS production due to inactivation of forkhead
  box O3 (FOXO3).
