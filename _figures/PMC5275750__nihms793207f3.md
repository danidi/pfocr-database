caption: Many cancers have increased glycolysis for ATP production and amino acid
  synthesis, and elevated metabolic flux to pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for NADPH
  production and nucleotide synthesis. Pyruvate is converted to lactate for NAD+ regeneration
  to maintain glycolytic flux. Many cancers also rely on glutamine metabolism which
  replenishes the TCA cycle intermediates and further leads to NADPH production and
  fatty acid synthesis. Reductive carboxylation allows the use of glutamine for fatty
  acid synthesis and other metabolic needs even in the presence of hypoxia or mitochondrial
  dysfunction.
