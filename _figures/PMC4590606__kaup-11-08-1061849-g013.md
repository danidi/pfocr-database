caption: Model of T3-induced hepatic mitophagy. T3 increases mitochondrial activity
  by either increasing mitochondrial fuel delivery via transcription of genes like
  CPT1A and PDK4 and by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis via PPARGC1A. Increased
  mitochondrial function leads to increased respiration which in turn causes ROS generation.
  ROS increases activation of PRKAA1/AMPK via Ca2+-CAMKK2 signaling. PRKAA1/AMPK activation
  leads to 2 distinct bifurcated pathways with one increasing mitophagy through ULK1
  and the other increasing general autophagy such as lipophagy via MTOR suppression.
  T3 also augment the transcription of key autophagy genes via a still uncharacterized
  nuclear pathway which may include THR's or other transcription factors. A concurrent
  increase in both mitophagy and lipophagy may help sustain mitochondrial respiration
  with lipophagy providing fuel for oxidation and mitophagy helping to maintain homeostatic
  mitochondrial turnover.
