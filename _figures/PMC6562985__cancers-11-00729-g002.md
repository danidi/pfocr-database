caption: Matrix stiffness induces expression of LOX enzymes and promotes tumor progression.
  On the left, regulation of LOX expression. Interaction of α2β1 integrin to collagen
  type I promotes LOX expression in stromal cells. ECM stiffness induces LOXL2 upregulation
  via activation of integrin β1/α5/JNK/c-JUN signaling pathway in HCC cells. On the
  right, effects of stiff ECM on cancer cells. LOX mediates collagen crosslinking
  and ECM stiffness, resulting in stabilization of integrin complexes and increased
  cancer cell proliferation and invasion.
