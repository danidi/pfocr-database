caption: 'Pathophysiology of autism based on our findings showing the impact of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) at different levels of intermediary metabolism and the consequences
  of brain 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methyl THF) deficiency due to FRα autoimmunity.
  ROS inhibits B12-methionine synthase (B12-MS) activity and stimulates cystathionine
  beta synthase (CBS) activity, shifting the homocysteine accumulation from the methionine
  cycle into the transsulfuration pathway with increased production of the natural
  antioxidant glutathione. Superoxide anions also react with NO at the level of NO-synthase
  (NOS1) to form peroxynitrite instead of NO, which predisposes to apoptosis and nitrosylation
  of tyrosine and cysteine. Nitrosative stress affects activity of tryptophan (TPH2)
  and tyrosine hydroxylases (TH), the rate-limiting enzymes for serotonin, and dopamine
  synthesis. In addition, ROS catabolize 5-methyl-THF and impair folate uptake and
  transcellular transport across the choroid plexus and placental barriers due to
  interaction with FRα and RFC1 folate transporters. FRα autoantibodies also impair
  folate transport to the fetus and brain. The resulting brain folate deficiency predisposes
  to reduce SAM production and SAM-dependent methyl-transfer reactions and reduces
  purine and thymidine synthesis with diminished GTP and BH4 production. The diminished
  BH4 availability as the shared cofactor of the enzymes TH, TPH2, and NOS1 will therefore
  reduce their enzyme activity. Reduction of the activated methyl group donor SAM
  downregulates DNA methylation and affects posttranslational modifications of histones
  (methylation and trimethylation of histones), thereby impeding the homeostatic balance
  between gene transcription and silencing. In addition, folate deficiency is accompanied
  by overexpression of histone deacetylases, which further leads to abnormal gene
  silencing. The shutdown in expression of specific sets of genes will affect neuronal
  growth, pruning, and differentiation. Abbreviations: GTPCH: GTP-cyclohydrolase I;
