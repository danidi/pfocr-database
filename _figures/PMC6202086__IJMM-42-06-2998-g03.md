caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of
  b[Ca2+]i. Membranal Ca2+ channels, such as L-VDCC, T-VDCC and TRPC3, appear to be
  constitutively active under basal conditions through different signaling pathways.
  The two types of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel may be modulated by phosphorylation
  processes mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 signaling. This signaling
  pathway can be activated by GPCRs through the αq subunit when the endogenous ligand
  is present under basal conditions (i.e., acetylcholine, histamine, leukotrienes,
  etc.). It may also be stimulated when RTKs are occupied by the appropriate ligand
  (cytokines, growth factors, etc.). ERK1/2 phosphorylates L-VDCC on Ser496 of the
  β2 subunit and Ser1928 of the α1 subunit, decreasing or increasing the channel activity,
  respectively, enabling it to switch between an open and closed state. T-VDCC is
  probably also phosphorylated by ERK1/2, but further research is needed to identify
  the phosphorylation sites (see ). TRPC3 is directly activated by DAG and IP3 arising
  from PLCβ or PLCγ, the first coupled to the αq subunit of GPCR, and the second to
  RTKs. Constitutive IP3 production induces SR-Ca2+ release through ITPR1. This Ca2+
  induces Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release through the RyR2 (designated as Ca2+ ‘sparks’).
  Finally, [Ca2+]i is efficiently regulated by the SERCA2b and PMCA1 or PMCA4. L-VDCC,
  L-type voltage-dependent channel; T-VDCC, T-type voltage dependent Ca2+ channel;
