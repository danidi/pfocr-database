caption: The development of immunothrombosis.Platelets activated by thrombin and or
  PICs initiate (PAR)–mediated signalling further increasing levels of PICs VWF and
  TF coupled with suppression of suppression of thrombomodulin. Platelet activation
  also results in increased expression of P-selectin, CD40 PF4 and a range of surface
  adhesion receptors ultimately recruiting neutrophils to form platelet neutrophil
  complexes. NET secretion by neutrophils contributes to an increased coagulation
  stimulate increased levels of platelet activation, aggregation and TF mediated activation
  of thrombin. In addition, histones play an important role in promoting thrombin
  generation and inhibiting protein C-mediated anticoagulant responses. PICs also
  play a role in the development of coagulopathy by inhibiting the protein C-protein
  S-thrombomodulin pathway and increasing the production of PAI-1. The combination
  of a hyperactivated coagulation cascade and the inhibition of anti-coagulant pathways,
  such as the protein C-protein S-thrombomodulin pathway and inhibition of the fibrinolytic
  system is characteristic of DIC. This state is also the source of micro emboli and
  excessive alveolar fibrin deposition in ARDS.
