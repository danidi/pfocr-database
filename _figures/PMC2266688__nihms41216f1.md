caption: 'As described in the text, neuroprotective (in blue) and preconditioning
  (in green) mechanisms currently being explored for inhalational anesthetics in ischemic
  brain injury are depicted within the neurovascular unit. Mechanisms under investigation
  for both neuroprotection and preconditioning (in red) are also shown. Inhalational
  anesthetics administered before (preconditioning) or during (neuroprotection) perioperative
  brain ischemia are thought to promote and stabilize peri-ischemic rCBF as well as
  reduce CMR, thus increasing cerebral energy stores in ischemic brain. Neuroprotective
  effects of inhalational anesthetics in ischemic brain could also occur through inhibition
  of ROS formation from mitochondrial, nuclear, or cytoplasmic sources; scavenging
  of free radicals; and inhibition of membrane degeneration and lipid peroxidation.
  In addition, inhalational anesthetics could modulate ischemic excitotoxicity through
  attenuation of ischemia-induced catecholamine release, potentiation of GABAergic
  neurotransmission, and inhibition of glutamergic neurotransmission. Antagonism of
  AMPA and NMDA receptors for glutamate can subsequently lead to attenuation of ischemia-induced
  increases in [Ca2+]i and decreases in glutamate-receptor-linked cyclic guanosine
  monophosphate production. Paradoxically, inhalational anesthetic-induced [Ca2+]i
  increases may be involved with preconditioning effects in ischemic brain. Such changes
  in [Ca2+]i can modulate calcium-dependent protective processes in ischemic brain
  involving calmodulin, CCPDKII, and the MAPK–ERK pathway. Inhalational anesthetics
  are thought to reduce or delay apoptosis through activation of Akt (protein kinase
  B), an antiapoptic factor downstream of the MAPK–ERK pathway, and through decreased
  expression of Bax, an apoptosis-inducing protein. Adenosine A1 receptor activation
  may also be involved with the preconditioning effects of inhalational anesthetics
  in ischemic brain. Furthermore, adenosine A1 receptor activation may possibly be
  a trigger for mitochondrial KATP channel opening and activation, which has been
  linked to the development of cerebral tolerance. It is speculated that KATP channel
  activation may alter ROS production, blunt intraischemic mitochondrial calcium accumulation,
  and improve postischemic mitochondrial energy production. Inducible nitric oxide
  synthase and the subsequent generation of NO may be important for inhalational anesthetic
  preconditioning in ischemic brain as well. Lastly, tolerance induced by inhalational
  anesthetic preconditioning may be mediated through p38 MAPK activation. Abbreviations:
