caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway for hyaluronic acid (HA) production in Ogataea (Hansenula)
  polymorpha. The black and blue arrows indicate the endogenous glycolysis and HA
  precursor pathways, respectively. The green arrows indicate the exogenous pathway
  inserted in O. polymorpha for HA production. The red arrows represent methanol metabolism.
  Genes encoding enzymes of the pathways are shown: aox: alcohol oxidase; cat: catalase;
  dhas: dihydroxyacetone synthase; dak: dihydroxyacetone kinase; hxk: hexokinase;
  pgi: glucose-6-phosphate isomerase; pfk: phosphofructokinase; fbp: fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase;
  fba: fructose-bisphosphate aldolase; pgmA: phosphoglucomutase; hasC: UDP-glucose
  pyrophosphorylase; hasB: UDP-glucose dehydrogenase; glmS: amidotransferase; glmM:
  phosphoglucosamine mutase; hasD: acetyltransferase and UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine
  pyrophosphorylase; hasA: hyaluronic acid synthase. Molecules: DHA: dihydroxyacetone;
  DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GAP: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; Xu-5P: xylulose-5-phosphate;
  FBP: fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate; Glucose-6P: glucose-6-phosphate; Fructose-6P: fructose-6-phosphate;
  Glucose-1P: glucose-1-phosphate; UDP-glcUA: UDP-glucuronic acid; GlcN-6P: glucosamine-6-phosphate;
  GlcN-1P: glucosamine-1-phosphate; GlcNAc-1P: N-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate; UDP-GlcNAc:
  UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine; HA: hyaluronic acid.The methylotrophic yeast O. polymorpha
  (formerly known as Hansenula polymorpha or Pichia angusta) is used as an expression
  platform because of its features, which include fermentation at high cell densities,
  low-cost substrate utilization, defined synthetic medium, secretion of heterologous
  proteins in high levels, established strategies for bioreactor cultivation, and
  availability of synthetic biology tools for genetic manipulation []. O. polymorpha
  is widely used to produce biopharmaceuticals, including Insulin (Wosulin®), α-Interferon
  (Reiferon®), and others [], and therefore it is an attractive host platform to produce
  HA. Furthermore, this non-conventional yeast is thermotolerant, and this can be
  explored for HA production, as it was recently reported that temperature changes
  affect the chain length of HA as well as the titers []. In B. subtilis, an increase
  in the cultivation temperature led to an increase in HA’s molecular weight but a
  decrease in its concentration in the culture broth.'
