caption: 'Pathophysiology of autism based on our findings showing the impact of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) at different levels of intermediary metabolism and the consequences
  of brain 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-methyl THF) deficiency due to FRα autoimmunity.
  ROS inhibits B12-methionine synthase (B12-MS) activity and stimulates cystathionine-beta-synthase
  (CBS) activity, shifting the homocysteine accumulation from the methionine cycle
  into the transsulfuration pathway with increased production of the natural antioxidant
  glutathione. Superoxide anions also react with NO at the level of NO-synthase (NOS1)
  to form peroxynitrite instead of NO, which predisposes to apoptosis and nitrosylation
  of tyrosine and cysteine. Nitrosative stress affects activity of tryptophan- (TPH2)
  and tyrosine hydroxylases (TH), the rate-limiting enzymes for serotonin and dopamine
  synthesis. In addition ROS catabolize 5-methyl-THF and impair folate uptake and
  transcellular transport across the choroid plexus and placental barriers due to
  interaction with FRα and RFC1 folate transporters. FRα autoantibodies also impair
  folate transport to the fetus and brain and predispose to brain folate deficiency
  with reduction of SAM production and SAM-dependent methyl-transfer reactions, reduced
  purine and thymidine synthesis with diminished GTP and BH4 production, which is
  the common cofactor of the enzymes TH, TPH2 and NOS1. Reduction of the activated
  methyl-group donor SAM down regulates DNA methylation and affects posttranslational
  modifications of histones (methylation and trimethylation of histones), thereby
  impeding the homeostatic balance between gene transcription and silencing. In addition
  folate deficiency is accompanied by overexpression of histone deacetylases, which
  further leads to abnormal gene silencing. The shutdown in expression of specific
  sets of genes will affect neuronal growth, pruning and differentiation. Abbreviations:
  GTPCH: GTP-cyclohydrolase I; cyst: cysteine; tyr: tyrosine; MTHFR: methylene-tetrahydrofolate
  reductase; RFC1: reduced folate carrier-1.'
