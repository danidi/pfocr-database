caption: A model of thymic differentiation. In this model, DPint TCRloc-Kit+ cells
  begin the process of self-MHC recognition; successful recognition propels these
  cells along c-Kit+ maturation path to CD4 and CD8 SP cells maintaining IL-7R and
  Bcl-2 () (along the lines depicted on the top). Curved arrows indicate cells in
  the mitotic cycle. DPintTCRloc-Kit+ cells that fail positive selection (and also
  DPloTCR−/lo blasts) can enter the c-Kit−pathway by down-regulating c-Kit, IL-7R,
  and Bcl-2, and up-regulating CD4 and CD8 to become DPhi blast cells. Within the
  DPhiTCRloc-Kit− blast cell population, alternative TCRα rearrangement can occur.
  The majority of such cells again fail positive selection, become small DPhiTCRloc-Kit−IL-7R−
  (Bcl-2−) cells that die by neglect (). A subset of DPhiTCRloc-Kit− cells that have
  gained TCRα/β receptor that are self-MHC-restricted enter the c-Kit−IL-7R+ maturation
  pathway up-regulating Bcl-2 (), and differentiate mainly to CD4 SP cells (the middle
  horizontal sequences). IL-7R principally signals survival of cells on both pathways
  through up-regulating (at least) Bcl-2 ().
