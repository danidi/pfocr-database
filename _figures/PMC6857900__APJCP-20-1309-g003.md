caption: The Links between FTO and Colon Cancer. Over-expression of FTO protein could
  increase incidence of colon cancer through both obesity dependent and independent
  pathways. FTO increases food intake through satiety hormone leptin, causing obesity.
  In independent obesity associated pathway, FTO can initiate cellular signalling
  molecules STAT3, cyclin D1 and MMPs to increase cancer incidence. FTO, Fat mass
  and obesity associated; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; MMPs, matrix metalloproteinase; NPY, neuropeptide Y. (Adapted from Chen et al.,
  2013)
