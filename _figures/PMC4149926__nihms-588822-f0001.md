caption: (A) miR-UL112-1 targets viral factors UL114 (uracil DNA glycosylase) and
  IE1. Both proteins are thought to play a role in the establishment of latency and
  reactivation processes in hematopoietic lineage cells such as CD34+ HPCs, monocytes
  and macrophages. (B) miR-US25-1 targets cellular genes involved in cell cycle control
  including cyclin E2, BRCC3, EID1, MAPRE2, CD147 and histones. (C) HCMV miRNAs target
  genes involved in immune evasion. miR-UL148D-1 directly targets RANTES, a chemokine
  that recruits immune cells to the site of infection, while miR-UL112 targets the
  NK cell ligand MICB to prevent NK cell killing of infected cells. (D) HCMV miRNAs
  target the secretory pathway. miR-US25-1 targets the endosomal acidification complex
  component ATP6V0C while miRUL112, miR-US5-1 and miR-US5-2 coordinately target multiple
  secretory pathway genes including VAMP3, RAB5C, RAB11A, CDC42 and SNAP23, regulating
  the release of inflammatory cytokines and formation of the virion assembly compartment.
