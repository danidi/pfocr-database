caption: A “triple-switch” (transcription of PCK1, acetylation of Pck1p and allosteric
  modification of PC) in the gluconeogenesis pathway controls prompt adaptation of
  a metabolic flux to energy status in yeast (A) and humans (B). The change of metabolic
  flux also mediates extension of chronological longevity under water starvation in
  yeast cells. ACS, acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase. AceCS1, acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase
  1. PC, pyruvate carboxylase. Solid lines indicate the paths that have been proved
  by previous and the present study; dashed lines indicate those paths that were hypothesized
  as part of the present study.
