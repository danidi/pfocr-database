caption: We previously showed in caspase-inhibited macrophages that exclusive stimulation
  of TNFR2 results in depletion of TRAF-cIAP1/2 complexes (1), activation of the alternative
  NFκB pathway (2) and necroptosis (8). In this study, we show that TNFR2 in caspase-inhibited
  (5) macrophages in addition upregulates A20, TRAF1, IL-6, and IL-1β (6, 9) via TNF
  induction (2), and subsequent TNFR1 stimulation (3). Notably, although RIPK1 kinase
  activation is required for upregulation of all four targets (4), there are different
  requirements of the necroptotic signaling components RIPK3 and MLKL. Although A20
  and TRAF1 are upregulated in the absence of RIPK3, MLKL and necroptosis (6), induction
  of IL-6 and IL-1β (9) is linked to necroptosis (8)
