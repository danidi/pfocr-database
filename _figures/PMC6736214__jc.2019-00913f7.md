caption: Schematic model depicting the proposed signaling pathway in SREBP-mediated
  LHR mRNA downregulation. Inhibition of HMG-CoA by atorvastatin activates SREBP,
  resulting in the activation of transcription of gene-encoding enzymes in sterol
  metabolism, including LRBP. LRBP binds LHR mRNA and accelerates LHR mRNA degradation
  by a previously described mechanism from our laboratory (). Reduced levels of LHR
  mRNA cause decreased levels of LHR expression on the cell surface, which diminishes
  the responsiveness of the ovary for progesterone production in response to LH.
