caption: Resistance to the p53-coactivator Zac1 and DNA damage in chicken horizontal
  progenitor cells. Overexpression of mZac1 in the embryonic chicken retina induce
  p53-dependent upregulation of p21 which leads to arrest of the cell cycle and/or
  apoptosis in a majority of the retinal progenitor cells. The horizontal progenitor
  cells resist the overexpression of Zac1 and progress through the cell cycle. This
  deviating behaviour during their terminal mitosis may be another piece of the puzzle
  for understanding why certain retinal cells have a propensity for neoplastic transformation
  and form retinoblastoma. DDR, DNA damage response pathway; HPCs, horizontal progenitor
  cells; p53, tumour suppressor gene p53; p21, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1
  (CIP1/warf1); RPCs, retinal progenitor cells. Apical (ventricular) and basal (vitreal)
  side of the retinal neuroepithelium
