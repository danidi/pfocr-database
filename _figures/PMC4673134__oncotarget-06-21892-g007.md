caption: Here, we used FACS analysis to begin to dissect metabolic heterogeneity in
  tumor cells. More specifically, we showed that anabolic stem-like cancer cells can
  be purified using hTERT-eGFP as a surrogate marker of telomerase activity. These
  eGFP-high cells showed increased stem cell activity (mammosphere formation), as
  well as functional increases in mitochondrial mass and activity. Further studies
  with unbiased label-free proteomics revealed the upregulation of mitochondrial proteins,
  glycolytic enzymes and EMT markers, as well as ribosome subunits and other components
  of the proteins synthesis machinery. These proteomic studies are consistent with,
  and support an anabolic stem-like cancer cell phenotype. Quantitatively similar
  results were obtained using large cell size to purify anabolic stem-like cancer
  cells. We speculate that high telomerase activity drives an increase in mitochondrial
  power, via positive regulation by PGC1-α/β. Moreover, we suggest that increased
  mTOR signaling may contribute to larger cell size, via increased protein synthesis.
  The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is known to i) control cell size by positively regulating
  protein synthesis and ii) telomerase (hTERT) forms a physical complex with mTOR
  and can therefore regulate its activity. In summary, our results metabolically define
  a sub-population of stem-like, mitochondrial-rich, cancer cells, allowing us to
  understand the possible origins of metabolic heterogeneity in human tumors.
