caption: Metabolic interventions suggested by OptForce for increasing production of
  octanoic acid (C8) in E. coli. The figure on left shows the reaction-level manipulations
  in E. coli central and fatty acid metabolism as suggested by OptForce for overproduction
  of octanoic acid. Reactions in green are suggested up-regulations (in fatty acid
  synthesis), while those in red are suggested removals (i.e., in β-oxidation degradation,
  fumarase, and in the acetate formation pathway). The mapping between reaction-level
  manipulations to their targeted genes is shown on right. Specifically, 3OAS80, 3-oxy-acyl-ACP
  synthase encoded by fabB or fabF; 3OAR80, 3-oxo-acyl-ACP reductase encoded by fabG;
  3HOAD80, 3-hydroxy-acyl dehydratase encoded by fabZ; ACOAD3, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
  encoded by fadE; ECOAH3, enoyl-CoA hydratase encoded by fadB; HACD3, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
  dehydrogenase encoded by fadB; KAT3, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase encoded by fadA; FUM,
  fumarase encoded by fumA and fumC; ACK, acetate kinase encoded by ackA; PTA, phosphate
  acetyltransferase encoded by pta
