caption: p53 plays a dual role in the regulation of ferroptosis through transcriptional
  or posttranslational mechanisms in different contexts. On one hand, p53 induces
  ferroptosis through inhibition of SLC7A11 or upregulation of GSL2 and SAT1–ALOX
  pathway. On the other hand, p53 also inhibits ferroptosis through inhibition of
  DPP4 activity or by the transcriptional activation of CDKN1A/p21. ALOX arachidonate
  lipoxygenase, CDKN1A cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A, DPP4 dipeptidyl-peptidase-4,
  GLS2 glutaminase 2, GSH glutathione, NOX1 NADPH oxidase 1, ROS reactive oxygen species,
  SAT1 spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1, SLC7A11 solute carrier family 7
