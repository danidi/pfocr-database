caption: Lignin biosynthetic pathway. During early development, the hull of the pw
  mutant accumulates lignin earlier than that of the WT. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia
  lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; C3H, 4-coumarate 3-hydroxylase;
  HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; CCoAOMT,
  caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; F5H,
  ferulate-5-hydroxylase. Gene expression was scaled using the Z-score of FPKM (mean
  value of three biological replicates) in the heatmap. For each heatmap, the key
  is located at right side with FPKM values increasing from blue to red.
