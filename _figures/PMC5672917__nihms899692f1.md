caption: Iron enters the endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier as a low molecular
  weight complex, or via transferrin receptor-1 mediated endocytosis of transferrin,
  or independently as non-transferrin-bound iron.– Transferrin receptors line the
  lumen of the brain and bind circulating differic–transferrin facilitating iron uptake
  into brain vascular endothelial cells via receptor–mediated endocytosis. Whether
  there is a DMT1–ferroportin-independent pathway to release ferric iron or differic-transferrin
  by exocytosis of recycling endosomes is unclear (vesicular export pathway, left
  side in brain vascular endothelial cells). Transferrin is synthesised by the choroid
  plexus or oligodentrocytes so that any ferric iron released from the abluminal side
  of the endothelial cells can form complexes with transferrin or alternatively low
  molecular weight molecules (eg, ascorbate, citrate, or ATP) to form non-transferrin-bound
  iron. Citrate and ATP can be released from the astrocytes. Whether there is a DMT1–ferroportin-dependent
  (non-vesicular export, right side in brain vascular endothelial cells) pathway to
  release ferrous iron, which would be rapidly converted to ferric iron via ceruloplasmin
  in the abluminal membranes, is also unknown. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
  form of ceruloplasmin is highly expressed by astrocytes in the mammalian CNS and
  is physically associated with ferroportin. Astrocytes are ideally positioned to
  take up iron from the circulation and distribute it to other cells in the CNS. Astrocytes
  have the iron influx and efflux mechanisms needed for cell-to-cell transport of
  iron. DMT1 is expressed by astrocytes and probably mediates iron influx into these
  glial cells. Iron can be stored as ferritin in astrocytes and exported by a mechanism
  that involves ferroportin and ceruloplasmin. Oligodentrocytes might take up iron
  via the ferritin receptor Tim-2, or non-transferrin-bound iron via DMT1, or other
  non-vesicular iron import mechanisms. Neurons and microglia can influx iron via
  transferrin–transferrin receptor mediated uptake and efflux iron via ferroportin.
  IRPs (1 and 2), DMT1, and −IRE DMT1 (non-IRE form of DMT1 protein) are expressed
  mostly by astrocytes. Increased iron regulatory proteins expression might lead to
  increased expression of the +IRE form of DMT1. The role of hepcidin in orchestrating
  the regulation of egress from cells via ferroportin in different brain cells remains
  unclear. Neuron axons are wrapped with the myelin sheath, which is made of oligodendrocytes
  in an iron-dependent manner. Microglia form an association with neurons via CD200/CD200R
  to maintain the quiescent state. Microglia might take up iron via transferrin receptor
  and release iron via ferroportin. Dashed lines represent unknown regulation of iron.
