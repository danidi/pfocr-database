caption: 'Lipid biosynthesis. Schematic overview of the pathways involved in the synthesis
  of fatty acids (FAs), sphingolipids and glycosphingolipids. For FA biosynthesis
  (green box), acetyl-CoA is converted into malonyl-CoA by ACC. The repeated condensation
  of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA by the multifunctional enzyme FASN leads to the generation
  of palmitic acid, a fully saturated 16-carbon FA. The synthesis of ceramides (blue
  box) can occur via 2 distinct pathways: the de novo pathway (white arrow), that
  begins with the transamination of palmitoyl-CoA by SPT via a condensation reaction
  with serine and the hydrolysis pathway (yellow arrow), that synthesizes ceramide
  utilizing sphingomyelins as substrates through the action of SMase. Furthermore,
  ceramides can be obtained from sphingosine, through the action of CerS, and from
  GalCer, through GalC. Ceramides serve as precursor for the biosynthesis of the glycosphingolipids
  (light blu box), sphingomyelin and sphingosine. Enzyme abbreviations: ACC, acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; ASA, arylsulfatase A; CGT, UDP–galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase;
  CST, cerebroside sulfotransferase; CerS, ceramide synthase; CerDase, ceramidase;
  FASN, fatty acid synthase; GalC, galactosylceramidase; S1Pp, S1P phosphatase; SMase,
  sphingomyelinase; SMS, sphingomyelin synthase; Sphk, sphingosine kinase; SPT, serine
  palmitoyl transferase; UGCG, UDP-glucose ceramide glycosyltransferase. Metabolite
  abbreviations: GalCer, galactosylceramide; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate.'
