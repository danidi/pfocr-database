caption: Innate immunity and antiretroviral activities. Upon HIV infection, virus
  dissemination occurs rapidly from viral sanctuary sites such as memory CD4+ T cells
  and macrophages. Early innate host immune response dictates viral load at the acute
  phase. While inflammation contributes critically to innate control of infection,
  it also recruits HIV target cells during the acute phase, impairs CD4+ T cell recovery,
  and promotes disease progression and viral latency. The latency can be reversed
  by several LRAs leading to activation of quiescent cells and exposure of the viral
  antigens by APCs rending the subsequent removal of infected cells by CTL mediated
  immunity (A). To combat HIV, the immune system has evolved complex and diverse transcriptional
  signatures, driving differential cellular and humoral responses. These signatures
  are induced by immune receptors, in this case Toll like receptors (e.g. TLR2) sensing
  the pathogen (HIV-1) and by the production of cytokines at the earliest onset of
  infection. The virus-mediated release of molecules in contact with TLR7 activate
  the MyD88 pathway, blocking the function of IRF7 and NF-κB response generally induced
  by viral signaling and ultimately secretion of cytokines like interferons leading
  to a restoration of immune function and viral clearance. This specific nature of
  immune activation is as critical to HIV-1 clearance as the induction of an adaptive
  immune response (B).
