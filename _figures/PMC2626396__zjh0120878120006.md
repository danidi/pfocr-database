caption: Ras signaling pathway influences the outcome of oncolytic virus G207 insult
  in MPNST cells. This diagram explains the influence of Ras signaling via its downstream
  effector pathways on permissiveness of MPNST cells to G207. In cells with low levels
  of Ras signaling, viral protein synthesis does not occur at an efficient level.
  However, exposure to virus does induce certain levels of apoptosis in these cells
  in part because of an inactive PI3K pathway failing to exert its anti-apoptotic
  effects. In cells with elevated levels of Ras signaling, however, efficient viral
  protein synthesis and activation of the PI3K pathway reduces the capability of cells
  to undergo apoptosis. The expected outcome of this scenario would be robust G207
  replication and death of cells via lytic infection (necrosis).
