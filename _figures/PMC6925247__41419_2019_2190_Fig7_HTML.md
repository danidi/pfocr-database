caption: When TIPRL overexpressing lung cancer cells were exposed to metabolic stress,
  TIPRL binds to and phosphorylates eIF2α, inducing autophagy by upregulating stress-induced
  transcription factors, such as CHOP and ATF4, and then accelerating growth and progression
  of lung cancer cells. Conversely, when TIPRL is depleted, the stressed cells undergo
  apoptosis because of non-interaction between TIPRL and eIF2α, which in turn downregulates
  stress-induced transcription factors, eventually inhibiting autophagy.
