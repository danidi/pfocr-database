caption: Zrf1 controls the temporal expression of the genes related to cardiomyogenesis.
  (A) Schematic illustration of cardiomyogenesis. Cardiomyogenesis begins with mesoderm
  induction which is triggered by Nodal signaling in the proximal epiblast. Nodal
  signaling maintains BMP4 expression in the extraembryonic ectoderm. BMP4 acts by
  inducing Wnt3 expression in the proximal epiblast. Nodal and Wnt signaling are restricted
  to the posterior epiblast by specific antagonists (Lefty1 and Cer1; Dkk1, respectively).
  Wnt induces the expression of mesoendodermal markers Brachyury and Eomes. Then Brachyury
  and Eomes together induce the expression of Mesp1. Downstream of Mesp1, a complex
  network of transcription factors, which belong to first and second heart fields,
  tightly control the proper development of cardiac tissues. (B) Real-time qPCR of
  signaling pathway, mesoendoderm, Mesp1, first and second heart field related genes
  at days 0, 4 and 6 of EB differentiation. Expression was normalized to the housekeeping
  gene S18. Data represent the average of 5 experiments, +/− SEM *p < 0.5, **p < 0.01,
  ***p < 0.001 as calculated by 2-tailed unpaired t test.
