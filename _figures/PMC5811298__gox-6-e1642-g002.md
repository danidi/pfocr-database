caption: 'Skin pigmentation in response to UV light. When UV light causes damage to
  the DNA within keratinocytes, tumor protein 53 (p53) transcription is increased
  within the cell. p53 then acts as a transcription factor for the gene proopiomelanocortin
  (POMC) within keratinocytes, increasing its transcription and hence, protein expression.
  POMC is then proteolytically cleaved to its products: adrenocorticotropic hormone
  (ACTH) or α-MSH, and these molecules get secreted from the keratinocytes. These
  signaling molecules bind to the g-protein coupled receptor on melanocyte membranes
  called the MC1R. The binding of ACTH or α-MSH to MC1R then activates the secondary
  messengers of MC1R, specifically adenylcyclase, which converts adenosine triphosphate
  to cyclic adenosine monophosphate. cAMP can then activate protein kinase A (PKA)
  by binding to its catalytic region. PKA goes on to phosphorylate cAMP response element
  binding protein (CREB). Phosphorylated CREB can then bind to the promoter region
  in the microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF) gene and increase its transcription.
  Damaged keratinocytes also signal to melanocytes through a secondary mechanism.
  Stem cell factor gets secreted and binds to a receptor tyrosine kinase on melanocyte
  membranes, the stem cell growth factor receptor. The binding of the ligand to the
  receptor dimerizes and activates the receptor, and this dimerization activates the
  mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway within melanocytes. These MAP kinases
  ultimately go on to phosphorylate the MiTF that was transcribed in the initial mechanism.
  p-MiTF can then bind to the M-Box promoter region of the 3 genes that are essential
  to produce eu-melanin, specifically, tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein
  1 (TYRP1), and TYRP2, also referred to as dopachrome tautomerase. Tyrosinase is
  the rate-limiting enzyme for melanogenesis during the conversion of tyrosine to
  eu-melanin. Once eu-melanin is produced, it is then packaged into lysosome-like
  organelles called melanosomes, and melanosomes are transferred back to keratinocytes
  through the protease-activated receptor. The newly synthesized melanin then acts
  as protection for DNA within keratinocytes by absorbing the UV light that would
  otherwise cause damage to the DNA.'
