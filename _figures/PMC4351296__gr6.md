caption: 'Mechanism of dynamics of the EGFR-NHERF1-NHE1 signaling axis and its role
  in PDAC growth and invasion.In control cells EGFR, NHERF1, and NHE1 are separate.
  Short-term EGF stimulation (0-30 min) induces a transient, trimeric, EGFR-NHERF1-NHE1
  complex, which segregates into two dimeric complexes (EGFR-NHE1 and NHERF1-NHE1)
  after prolonged EGF-stimulation. Upon EGF stimulation, NHERF1 expression decreases
  via proteosomal degradation, and EGFR is internalized and trafficked to intracellular
  vesicles by associating with the remaining NHERF1. From endosomes, a minor part
  of EGFR (≈ 40%), bound to NHERF1, is rapidly recycled back to the cell surface (30
  minutes of EGF stimulation) where EGFR, NHERF1, and NHE1 are recruited together
  in a EGFR-NHERF1-NHE1 complex, whereas the remaining endosomal EGFR (≈ 60%) is destined
  to lysosomal degradation at longer EGF stimulation. This process avoids new cycles
  of plasma membrane (PM) receptor stimulation; permits an increase in the PM abundance
  of NHERF1, whose cellular expression is balanced by EGFR expression levels; and,
  importantly, favors the segregation of the trimer complex in two subcomplexes residing
  in specific regions of the PM where polarized NHE1 signaling occurs: the EGFR-NHE1
  subcomplex is retained in caveolae and the NHERF1-NHE1 subcomplex in a different
  subset of PM invaginations. In this scenario, this branch point in the EGFR signaling
  pathway leading to NHE1 signal diversification and specificity may account for PDAC’s
  partial response to erlotinib and could explain why NHE1 inhibition with cariporide
  is important for combination therapy with erlotinib but also an important independent
  therapeutic approach in PDAC. Indeed, panels (A), (B), and (C) show the hypothetical
  effect of treatment with erlotinib (erl), 1 μM cariporide (Car), and both inhibitors,
  respectively, on long-term signaling and metastatic function. The size of the signal
  indicates the amplitude of the “residual” signaling from the different NHE1-containing
  subcomplexes.'
