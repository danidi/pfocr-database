caption: The inflammatory cytokine Interleukin 6 (IL-6) plays an important role in
  hepatocarcinogenesis through the modulation of STAT3 pathway, MAPK route and cell
  cycle progression. Growing evidence suggests a role for miRNAs in the regulation
  of IL-6. miR-26 was shown to be inversely related to IL-6 expression in a cohort
  of Chinese HBV-related HCC where low expression of miR-26 correlated with dismal
  outcome. Liver expression of miR-26 is higher in women than men. Consistently, estrogen-dependent
  IL-6 over-expression in female rats was shown to be responsible for the lower incidence
  of HCC in female. The oncogenic miR-21 was shown to be induced by IL-6 in a STAT-3-dependent
  mechanism, suggesting an auto-stimulatoruy loop.
