caption: Gene networks identified in both recEbo-VP35/WT- and recEbo-VP35/R312A-infected
  cells compared to mock-infected and irradiated controls. The networks of genes related
  to RNA posttranscriptional modification (A) and hematological system development
  and function (B) are shown. The networks were generated from Ingenuity Pathways
  analysis. The lines in between genes represent known interactions, with solid lines
  representing direct interactions and dashed lines representing indirect interactions.
  Red shading indicates an increase in gene expression, and green indicates a decrease
  in gene expression compared to uninfected controls. The intensity of shading is
  proportional to the fold difference in gene expression. An explanation of gene names
  and synonyms can be found in Table S2 in the supplemental material. Network pathway
  images were created by using Ingenuity Systems software.
