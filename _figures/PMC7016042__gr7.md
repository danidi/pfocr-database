caption: The mechanisms by which TMEM16A promotes the pathogenesis of AP by activating
  the IP3R/Ca2+/NFκB signaling pathways. TMEM16A is upregulated by IL-6 via the IL-6R/STAT3
  signaling pathway. Increased TMEM16A expression promotes intracellular Ca2+ release
  from the ER via direct interaction with IP3R. Intracellular Ca2+ elevation subsequently
  activates NFκB signaling, resulting in an increase in IL-6 secretion from acinar
  cells. IL-6 further promotes TMEM16A expression via the IL-6R/STAT3 signaling pathway.
  Therefore, a positive activation loop between TMEM16A and the IP3R/ Ca2+/NFκB/IL-6
  pathway is important for Ca2+ elevation, NFκB activation and IL-6 release, and thus
  cooperatively promotes the pathogenesis of AP.
