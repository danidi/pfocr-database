caption: Inflammation and oxidative stress are thought to promote tissue damage and
  MS, and recent data point to a protective role for antioxidant pathways, including
  the transcription factor NRF2, in MS. The drug dimethylfumarate, which targets the
  NRF2 pathway, is approved for treatment of RRMS and is under investigation in clinical
  trials for progressive forms of MS. Dimethylfumarate has pleiotropic mechanisms
  of action, but activation of NRF2 accounts for some of its antiinflammatory activity.
  (A) KEAP1, which is part of a cullin family E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, normally
  mediates ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NRF2. (B) When KEAP1 undergoes
  sulfhydration of cysteine 151 via binding of fumarate, it becomes unable to interact
  with NRF2, which accumulates in the nucleus and induces the expression of NRF2-dependent
  antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. Activation of NRF2 leads to increased production
  of a spectrum of antioxidants, including glutathione and cystathionine.
