caption: Tumour cells can secrete vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), which,
  when it binds to the VEGF receptor (VEGFR), can signal to halt antigen–presenting-cell
  (APC) maturation. Both bevacizumab — a monoclonal antibody against VEGF-A — and
  sunitinib — a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor — can block signalling through
  this pathway and, therefore, promote maturation of APCs. Both regulatory T (Treg)
  cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inhibit immune activation. VEGF-blockade
  with sunitinib or sorafenib can inhibit Treg cell function and treatment with sunitinib
  or axitinib has been found to inhibit function of MDSCs in preclinical and clinical
  models.
