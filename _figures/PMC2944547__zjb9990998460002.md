caption: 'Schemes for genetic organization and proposed mechanism of StyA/StyB from
  Pseudomonas sp. VLB120 and StyA1/StyA2B from R. opacus 1CP. For simplicity, only
  monomers are shown. (a) For Pseudomonas sp. VLB120, gene cluster encoding the upper
  styrene degradation pathway: stySc and styR regulatory genes; styA and styB encoding
  a styrene monooxygenase, styC encoding a styrene oxide isomerase, and styD encoding
  phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (). For R. opacus 1CP, organization of investigated
  styrene-catabolic genes: styA1 for putative oxygenase component of a two-component
  SMO and styA2B for single-component SMO (). (b) From left to right, cooperative
  mechanism of a typical two-component SMO of Pseudomonas (), mechanism of the self-sufficient
  monooxygenase StyA2B of R. opacus 1CP (), and hypothetical cooperation between StyA2B
  and StyA1. The FADH2 surplus of StyA2B is utilized by StyA1, yielding an increase
  of styrene-oxygenating activity. Dashed arrows indicate uncoupling-based FADH2 autooxidation
  leading to the formation of hydrogen peroxide.'
