caption: 'The Ca2+/calcineurin, Rim101, and Pkc1/Mpk1 MAPK signaling pathways in C.
  neoformans. The Ca2+/calcineurin, Rim101, and Pkc1/Mpk1 MAPK signaling pathways
  are mainly involved in the maintenance of cell wall integrity. Besides these pathways,
  the HOG, Ras, and UPR pathways are also involved in cell wall integrity. The Ca2+/calcineurin
  and Rim101 pathways are two main pH-sensing pathways, although the HOG pathway is
  also involved in pH sensing because it affects the expression of two cation transporters,
  ENA1 and NHA1. In the Rim101 pathway, Rim21- and Rim8-like orthologs have not been
  discovered, and the presence of functional orthologs is unknown. Therefore, pH changes
  and ion stress may be sensed and delivered by other unknown sensors. Although both
  Gpr5 and Rim101 are known to be involved in titan cell formation, the role of Gpr5
  in pH sensing is unknown. Calmodulin has both Ca2+-dependent and -independent functions.
  Besides Crz1/Sp1, transcription factors targeted by calcineurin remain to be discovered.
  Pkc1 appears to be a central hub for multiple environmental signals that deliver
  diverse upstream signals to multibranched downstream signaling pathways, including
  the Mpk1 MAPK module. Please refer to the main text for more details on the regulatory
  mechanisms of the Ca2+/calcineurin, Rim101, and Pkc1/Mpk1 MAPK signaling pathways.
  Solid arrows indicate separate, positive regulation or activation, whereas red lines
  ending in circles indicate negative regulation or repression. Broken arrows or lines
  indicate potential but unclear regulation. Abbreviations: PI, phosphatidylinositol,
  DAG, diacylglycerol; IPC, inositol phosphoryl ceramide; ESCRT, endosomal sorting
  complexes required for transport.'
