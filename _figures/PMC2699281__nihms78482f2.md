caption: 'The transcription factor p53 regulates the induction of apoptosis by regulating
  BAX, PUMA and APAF-1 expression. The permeability of the mitochondria and subsequent
  release of cytochrome C is regulated by a balance between antiapoptotic (i.e., BCL-2)
  and proapoptotic (i.e., BAX) factors. The increase of the proapoptotic BAX and its
  effector molecule, PUMA, in response to p53, interacts with and overcomes the antiapoptotic
  BCL-2, resulting in the release of mitochondrial cytochrome C. Cytochrome C, together
  with ATP and APAF-1, acts to activate caspase 9 in the activation of apoptosis through
  the intrinsic pathway. APAF: Apoptotic protease-activating factor; BAX: BCL-2-associated
  X protein; BCL-2: B-cell lymphoma-2 protein; CHIP: Carboxyl terminus of Hsp70-interacting
  protein; MDM: Murine double minute; PUMA: p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis.'
