caption: A) Ligation of T-cell PD-1 by tumor B7-H1 results in the downregulation of
  T-cell effector functions that destroy tumor tissue. B) Blockade of this pathway
  by anti-PD-1 antibodies prevents this downregulation, and allows T cells to maintain
  their antitumor functionality and ability to mediate tumor cell death.
