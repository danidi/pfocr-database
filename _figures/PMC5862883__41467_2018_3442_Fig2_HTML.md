caption: Calculated catalytic cycle and energetics of AsqJ. a The first part of the
  reaction cycle, comprising oxygen activation, decarboxylation of αKG, and two subsequent
  PCET reaction steps. b The second part of the reaction involving epoxidation of
  the substrate. All energies refer to free energies calculated in the quintet state
  at B3LYP-D3/def2-TZVP/ε = 4 level of theory with vibrational and entropic corrections
  at the B3LYP-D3/def2-SV(P)/ε = 4 level. Barriers are obtained from reaction pathway
  optimizations (Methods). See also Supplementary Movies  and , and Supplementary
  Figs.  and  for the optimized intermediate structures. Free energy profiles along
  the triplet surface are shown in Supplementary Figs.  and
