caption: 'Model for cell-adhesion–mediated cell-cycle arrest. Hypothetically ordered
  series of signaling events: cell-adhesion–dependent activation of APC/Cdh1 ubiquitin
  ligase complex, increased ubiquitination and degradation of Skp2, subsequent decreased
  ubiquitination and degradation of p27Kip1, and ultimately p27Kip1 accumulation,
  resulting in cell-cycle arrest.'
