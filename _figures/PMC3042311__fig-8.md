caption: Proposed model of ROS-mediated insulin signaling in mosquitoes. (1) Human
  insulin signals in the mosquito midgut, (2) inducing the phosphorylation of MEK
  and Akt. (3) Activated MEK and Akt phosphorylate downstream effectors such as ERK
  and FOXO. (4) This signaling leads to increased ROS, which can positively feed back
  into the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway, increasing the phosphorylation of downstream
  effectors such as ERK and FOXO. (5) Ultimately, insulin/IGF-1 signaling, acting
  in part through increased ROS levels, leads to a decrease in the mosquito immune
  response and (6) a subsequent increase in parasite development in the mosquito midgut
  epithelium.
