caption: Partially through stabilization of HIF-1α, hypoxia in inflamed and cancerous
  tissues drives the intracellular accumulation of adenosine by causing decreased
  ATP and adenosine kinase (AK) activity as well as increasing intracellular AMP and
  5′-nucleotidase activity (5′N). Additionally, HIF-1α activity drives increased expression
  of the 5′-ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, which are transmembrane proteins that
  catalyze the enzymatic breakdown of ATP to adenosine. Both of these mechanisms lead
  to significant elevation of extracellular adenosine concentrations in the microenvironment.
  Signaling through two Gs-protein-coupled adenosine receptors (A2aR and A2bR), adenosine
  triggers an increase in the intracellular signaling molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP).
  Within immune effector cells such as cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, cAMP causes
  a buildup of a range of immunosuppressive factors (TGF-β, IL-10, CTLA-4, PD-1, Galectin-1,
  FoxP3), as well as the down-regulation of key effector molecules (IL-2, INF-γ, TNF-α,
  perforin, IL-12, MIP1α) involved in an active immune response. A2aR, adenosine A2a
  receptor; A2bR, adenosine A2b receptor; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
  protein 4; FoxP3, forkhead box P3; HIF1-α, hypoxia inducible factor-1α; INFγ, interferon-γ;
  IL-2, interleukin-2; IL-10, interleukin-10; IL-12, interleukin-12; MIP1α, macrophage
  inflammatory protein 1α; PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; TGF-β, transforming
  growth factor-β; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α.
