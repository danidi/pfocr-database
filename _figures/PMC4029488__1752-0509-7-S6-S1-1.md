caption: Basic regulation mechanisms required in the process of a cell utilizing glucose
  and glycogen. A molecular interaction map [] of basic regulators that control glucose
  and glycogen utilization. B hierarchical map of A. Edge labels are shared in A and
  B. Px marked edges (x means number, e.g. P1) denote regulations only belong to HPr
  phosphorylation regulatory pathway; Lx marked regulations (e.g. L1) are only belong
  to HPr localization regulatory pathway; Gx marked regulations (e.g. G1.1) are only
  of gene expression regulatory pathway; and Sx marked regulations (e.g. S3) are of
  shared regulatory pathway, which is shared by aforementioned 3 pathways.
