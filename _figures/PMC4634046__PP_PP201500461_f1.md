caption: Proposed Arabidopsis  catabolism pathway. Enzyme names are abbreviated in
  rectangles with  catabolic enzymes highlighted in gray. Validated  catabolic enzyme
  activities are surrounded by solid lines, and putative  catabolic enzyme activities
  by dashed lines. Metabolic processes directly or indirectly connected to  catabolism
  in the mitochondrion are represented in ellipses. Reactions with one step are shown
  with solid arrows, and those with multiple steps with dashed arrows. Enzyme activities
  specific to Leu, Ile, and Val degradation are highlighted in orange, blue, and pink,
  respectively. Hypothesized isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD) enzyme activity toward
  non- catabolic intermediates is indicated with a green arrow. BCAT, Branched-chain
  aminotransferase; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; , branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase;
  mtLPD, mitochondrial lipoamide dehydrogenase; ETF, electron transfer flavoprotein;
  ETFQO, electron transfer flavoprotein ubiquinone oxidoreductase; ETC, electron transport
  chain; MCC, 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase; E-CoAH, enoyl-CoA hydratase; HMG-CoA,
  3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA; HML, 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase; , tricarboxylic
  acid.
