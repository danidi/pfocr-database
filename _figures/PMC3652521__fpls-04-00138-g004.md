caption: ABA regulation of stomatal closure during drought stress. An increased level
  of endogenous ABA in response to drought activates a signal transduction pathway
  that involves a sequence of events such as the elevation of the cytosolic Ca2+ level,
  which consequently activates the anion channels (S-type and R-type), which leads
  to membrane depolarization. The latter activate GORK, which is responsible for extruding
  K+ from the guard cells. Simultaneous with the efflux of K+, an efflux of water
  is observed. Together, these events lead to a decrease in the turgor of the guard
  cells and to stomatal closure under drought conditions. The sequence of events,
  which is explained in detail in the main text and presented in green in the figure,
  is the core of the reactions that are induced or inhibited by different proteins
  that are activated by ABA. Blue arrows indicate activation, while red blunt ended
  lines indicate inhibition.
