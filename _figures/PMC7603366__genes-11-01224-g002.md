caption: Dysregulated DNA damage response genes involved in pro-proliferative and
  apoptosis resistance characteristics of PAH-PAECs. Increased inflammation, ROS,
  oxidative stress, and susceptibility to genotoxic compounds are associated with
  increased DNA damage in PAH-PAECs. Reduced expression of PPARγ and BMPR2 in PAH-PAECs
  downregulates the downstream HR DNA repair genes, ATM and RAD51, respectively. The
  BMPR2-BRCA1-RAD51 pathway is also dysregulated in presence of MMC, a genotoxin.
  MMC is also proposed to trigger pulmonary vascular dysfunction associated with DNA
  damage signaling via reduced GCN2 expression, leading to PVOD. A similar mechanism
  may contribute to familial PVOD/PCH, where GCN2 is inactivated by biallelic EIF2AK4
  mutations. Similarly, reduced expression of TOPBP1, a DNA repair gene, in PAH-PAECs
  is reported to associate with PAH pathogenesis. These factors cause increased DNA
  damage, leading to endothelial cell dysfunction/injury in PAH and PVOD/PCH. The
  question mark symbol represents that the exact mechanism of this pathway in inducing
  the disease is still uncertain. DNA, Deoxyribonucleic acid; ROS, Reactive oxygen
