caption: '. Schematic depiction of Salmonellae-mediated cancer therapy. Attenuated
  S. typhimurium could be used as a delivery vector to achieve local expression of
  cargo molecules for cancer therapy. When bacteria are administrated to tumor-bearing
  animals, the bacterial components recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
  or endogenous danger signals activate the inflammasome pathway, resulting in the
  secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and inducing cancer cell death. DAMPs: damage-associated
  molecular patterns, PAMPs: pathogen-associated molecular patterns, TLRs: toll-like
  receptors.'
