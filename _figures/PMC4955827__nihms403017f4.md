caption: Upon Type I IFNs binding with its corresponding receptor, hPNPaseold-35 transcription
  is promoted through activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Once transcribed, hPNPaseold-35
  is either imported into the mitochondria IMS or mobilized into the cytosol by unknown
  mechanism(s). In the cytoplasm, by executing exoribonuclease activity it specifically
  targets mRNA/miRNAs thereby significantly affecting various biological functions,
  e.g., induction of cell cycle arrest by targeting c-myc. In addition to maintaining
  mitochondrial homeostasis, hPNPaseold-35 actively participates to block the translation
  of oxidative stress-mediated damaged RNA by sequestering it. In addition, although
  not evident, hPNPaseold-35 might also be involved in removal of truncated mtRNA
  from mitochondria.
