number: Figure 4
caption: Diagram of the DNA Damage and Repair Response Pathway. DNA breaks or collapsed
  replication forks are detected by sensors that mark the site of damage. Three kinase
  signaling cascades (ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK) regulate and transduce the response to
  damage. With the help of mediator proteins, transducer and effector proteins transmit
  and greatly amplify the signal throughout the cell, resulting in a huge influx of
  factors to repair damage and remodel chromatin. Two major repair pathways, HR and
  NHEJ, are regulated by the ATM/ATR and DNA-PK pathways, respectively. The nucleus
  on the left contains an HPV replication focus that mimics a DDR focus. Adapted from
  [].
