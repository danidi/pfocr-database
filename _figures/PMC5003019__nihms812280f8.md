caption: Tat treatment resulted in activation of NF-κB/YY1 with subsequent decreased
  expression of CX3CR1. Tat protein suppresses CX3CR1 expression in microglia via
  NF-κB-YY1, which attenuates CX3CL1-induced functional response of microglia such
  as calcium transients, activation of MAPK s and migration of microglia.
