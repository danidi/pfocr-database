caption: Schematic illustration of Wnt1/β-catenin signaling as a key player in glia–neuron
  cross-talk. A simplified scheme linking reactive astrocytes, mcroglia, and Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling to mDAergic neuron survival/death is summarized according to our published
  findings [,,,,,,,,]. Upon injury, a number of conditons, including astrocyte activation,
  the genetic and hormonal background (i.e., gender and estrogens), and endogenous
  and exogenous activators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling components (i.e., GSK-3β-antagonists),
  can promote astrocyte beneficial effects via the expression of a panel of growth/neurotrophic
  factors, particularly Wnt1, contributing to the survival, repair, and neurorescue
  of DA neurons, via direct neuronal effects (see ) and through the inhibition of
  the microglia-M1 activated phenotype. Astrocytes of the ventral midbrain, via activation
  of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, can also promote neurogenesis and DAergic neurogenesis
  from adult neural stem/progenitor cells. By contrast, aging, MPTP exposure, and
  genetic mutations exacerbate microglia activation, with upregulation of a wide panel
  of pro-inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin
  1β (IL-1β), Wnt5a, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS-derived) nitric oxide (NO)
  and reactive oxygen (ROS) and reactive nitrogen (RNS) species. Neurotoxic injury
  or increased oxidative load as a result of gene–environment interactions may antagonize
  Wnt/β-catenin signaling in DA neurons by upregulating active GSK-3β, leading to
  β-catenin degradation and increased DA neuron vulnerability.
