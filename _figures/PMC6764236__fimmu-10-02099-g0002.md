caption: Regulation of neutrophil metabolism. Neutrophil utilizes distinct metabolic
  pathways including glucose oxidation, glycogen breakdown and β-oxidation of fatty
  acids. After transport of glucose in the cytosol, hexokinase converts it to G6P
  that participate in different pathways like glycolysis, PPP, glycogen synthesis,
  or ER cycling. Glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate that can further utilize
  in TCA cycle or forms lactate. G6PT and G6Pase regulate recycling of G6P in ER and
  disruption of glucose/G6P balance and ER stress due to G6PT or G6Pase-β deficiencies
  result in impaired energy homeostasis, functions, and survivals of neutrophils.
  While FFA gets transport to the cytosol and autophagy also release FFA that undergoes
  β-oxidation and provides a high level of ATPs through mitochondrial OxPHOS pathway
  and regulates neutrophil differentiation. On the other hand, in neutrophils FAS
  and PexRAP produce peroxisomal lipids that get incorporated into the plasma membrane
  and thus maintaining membrane integrity and viability. Mitochondrial OxPHOS provides
  ATPs that also drives purinergic signaling in neutrophils. Transcriptional regulator
  HIF-1α regulates glucose transport as well as enzymes involved in the glycolysis.
  HIF-1α regulates PPARy, that also increases glucose uptake and regulates fatty acid
  metabolism. Interestingly, over-activation of PPARy in diverse diseases leads to
  defective energetics and functions of neutrophils. mTOR functions as a master regulator
  of mitochondrial metabolism and also regulates purinergic signaling. AMPK that senses
  AMP-ATP levels also controls neutrophil metabolism and functions.
