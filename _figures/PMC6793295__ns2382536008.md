caption: Proposed roles of semaphorin III–neuropilin-1 signaling during regeneration
  of the primary olfactory pathway. Scheme showing the intact (right) and lesioned
  (left, bulbectomy) olfactory system. The results show a complementary localization
  of sema III and its receptor neuropilin-1 in both the intact and regenerating adult
  olfactory system. We propose that sema III secreted by pial cells and second-order
  olfactory neurons of the intact olfactory system helps to confine continuously ingrowing
  neuropilin-1-positive olfactory axons to the olfactory nerve and glomerular layers,
  thereby determining the gross pattern of innervation of the olfactory bulb. After
  injury to the primary olfactory pathway, sema III-positive non-neuronal cells in
  the lesion site are present in close proximity to neuropilin-1-positive regenerating
  axons. Interestingly, the differential spatiotemporal expression of sema III after
  bulbectomy compared with axotomy appears to correlate to the regenerative potential
  displayed after these two types of lesions. The robust expression of sema III in
  scar tissue after bulbectomy and the failure of olfactory axons expressing the sema
  III receptor neuropilin-1 to regenerate across this scar suggests that the presence
  of semaphorins, i.e., sema III, in CNS scar tissue contributes to the regenerative
  failure of the injured CNS.
