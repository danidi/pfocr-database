caption: 'Mitochondrial metabolic pathways involving dihydrolipomide dehydrogenase
  (DLDH), which include the pyruvate to acetyl-CoA pathway, the α-ketoglutarate to
  succinyl-CoA pathway, and the branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and
  valine) to acyl-CoA pathway. The glycine cleavage pathway that also involves DLDH
  is not shown here. DLDH-involved complexes are indicated by dotted red arrows on
  the figure. BCAA: branched chain amino acids; NAD+: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;
  NADH: reduced form of NAD+; AAs: amino acids; α-KGDC: alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
  complex; TCA: tricarboxylic acid; BCKA: branched chain keto acid; BCKACD: branched
  chain alpha keto acid dehydrogenase complex; PDC: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.'
