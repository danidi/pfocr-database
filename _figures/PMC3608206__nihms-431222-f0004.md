caption: (A) Sox2 activates self-renewal genes and represses differentiation genes
  in a cell type-specific manner by (i) interpreting tissue-specific signals and (ii)
  interacting with other cell type-specific cofactors. For example, in ESCs Sox2 occupies
  many targets containing Oct4-Sox2 consensus sequences and partners with downstream
  effectors of ESC-specific signaling pathways including Stat3 (LIF pathway). In NPCs,
  Sox2 occupies target genes that also contain binding sites for the brain-specific
  factors Brn2 and Chd7, thus activating different sets of genes. In addition, Sox2
  activates its own transcription and regulates components of the signaling pathways
  that control self-renewal, thereby promoting maintenance of the undifferentiated
  state. (B) In addition to activating self-renewal genes and suppressing lineage-specific
  genes, Sox2 acts as a pioneer factor to prime stem cells for subsequent gene activation.
  Sox2 occupies silent NPC genes in ESCs, which carry bivalent domains poised for
  gene activation. Upon differentiation into NPCs, Sox2 and Sox3 cooperate to activate
  self-renewal genes while keeping neuronal differentiation genes in a silent but
  bivalent state. When NPCs undergo terminal differentiation, Sox2 and Sox3 disengage
  from neuronal-specific enhancers and are replaced by Sox11.
