caption: Immune signals from the TCR, co-stimulatory molecules and cytokine receptors
  activate PI3K and thus the tyrosine kinase AKT. Active AKT phosphorylates and inhibits
  the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), stimulating the activity of mTORC1. mTORC1
  stimulates aerobic glycolysis and lipid synthesis indirectly through supporting
  the activity of transcription factors like MYC, HIF1 and SREBP that promote the
  expression of key enzymes in these processes. The AMP-activated-protein kinase (AMPK)
  is activated by high AMP and ADP (signalling metabolic stress) and antagonizes mTORC1
  activity by stabilization of the repressor TSC and inhibition of the mTORC1 subunit
  Raptor. AMPK also indirectly promotes mitochondrial biogenesis through the activity
  of the transcriptional coactivator PGC1α. Moreover, AMPK can inhibit the synthesis
  of fatty acids and stimulate the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) by blocking
  the production of malonyl-CoA by the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC½), and thus also
  relieving the inhibition on carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) by malonyl-CoA.
  CPT1 is the rate-controlling enzyme for the transport of LCFAs into the mitochondrial
  matrix, where they can be metabolized into acetyl-CoA and reduced molecules through
  fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Short- and medium-chain fatty acids (SCFAs and MCFAs)
  enter FAO independently of CPT activity. In CD8+ T cells, glucose enters the cell
  through the Glut1 and Glut3 glucose transporters and is converted into pyruvate
  through glycolysis. In resting cells, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in the mitochondria
  converts this pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which is further oxidized in the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle, together with acetyl-CoA obtained from FAO. The TCA cycle generates
  reduced NADH and FADH2, whose oxidation by members of the electron transport chain
  (ETC) consumes molecular oxygen (O2) and supports the generation of ATP by oxidative
  phosphorylation (OxPhos). In activated cells, a mayor part of the pyruvate produced
  after glycolysis is reduced to lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDHA),
  and much of the acetyl-CoA obtained in the mitochondria is shuttled to the cytoplasm
  to sustain lipid synthesis. PDK1, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; HMGCR hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase; FASN, fatty acid
  synthase; CACT, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase; (V)LCAD, (very) long-chain
  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; RHEB, RAS homolog enriched in brain; FABP, fatty acid binding
  protein; PL, phospholipid; TAG, triacylglycerol; TRAF6, TNF-associated factor 6.
