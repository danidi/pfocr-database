caption: Signals involved in early granuloma formation. Studies in zebrafish suggest
  that mycobacteria (red) inside infected macrophages (blue) secrete the ESAT6 virulence
  factor, which, in turn, induces nearby epithelial cells (brown) to secrete the matrix
  metalloproteinase Mmp9 that is thought to facilitate the migration of macrophages
  []. This matrix degradation pathway could act cooperatively with Cxcr3-Cxcl11 signaling
  between infected and uninfected macrophages promoting the chemoattraction of macrophages
  and their aggregation into initial granulomas []
