caption: Overview of proteasome-dependent protein degradation via the muscle-specific
  E3 ligase MuRF1 as induced in various wasting illness, with recognized pharmacological
  inhibitors also presented. The most important proteolytic pathway to mediate muscle
  atrophy is the ATP-dependent ubiquitin-proteasome system, whereby structural and
  regulatory proteins are degraded by the 26S proteasome following polyubiquitination
  that involves activation of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. MuRF1 (an E3 ligase) plays a
  fundamental role in tagging proteins with ubiquitin during catabolic conditions,
  which is activated by various stimuli and signaling pathways that include NFκB and
  FoxO. A selection of reported pharmacological inhibitors of MuRF1-dependent muscle
  atrophy are presented along with the study reference. Solid lines indicate a direct
  effect on the target, while dotted lines indicate a secondary indirect effect. See
  the main text for full details.
