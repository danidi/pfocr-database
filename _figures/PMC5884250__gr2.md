caption: Proposed molecular mechanism for maintenance of MSC stemness by cell–cell
  adhesion through cadherin. The expression of CD106 in MSCs is dependent on cell
  density and increases via activation of the NF-κB pathway by cell–cell adhesion
  with N-cadherin in cultures with high cell densities. The phosphorylation of Src
  kinase through the intracellular domain of N-cadherin plays an important role in
  the upregulation of CD106. In the MSC intracellular signaling pathway, Src tyrosine
  kinase and PDGFRβ are ligand-independently activated by N-cadherin through cell–cell
  adhesion.
