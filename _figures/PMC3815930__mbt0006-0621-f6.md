caption: 'Extended metabolic pathways for production of the 2-hydroxyacid containing
  PHAs. Lactate-containing copolymers can be produced by engineered Pct and PhaC using
  lactate and glycolate (C2), lactate (C3) or 2-hydroxybutyrate (C4) as substrates.
  Although lactate feeding is shown in this figure, it is also possible to produce
  it in vivo as shown in . Metabolic pathways for production of PHAs containing 2HB
  monomers using glucose as the sole carbon source (Park et al., ). Cross represents
  the competitive pathway blocked. Abbreviations are: CimA, citramalate synthase;
  LeuBCD, 3-isopropylmalate dehydratase; PanE, D-2-hydroxyacid dehydrogenase. This
  figure is redrawn from a previous report (Park et al., ).'
