caption: A diagram of the canonical Notch signaling pathway. This schematic shows
  a simplified overview of the main components of Notch signaling. Upon Notch ligand
  binding, a two-step proteolysis cleavage process (small arrows) within the juxtamembrane
  region and transmembrane domain of the Notch receptor is catalyzed by a member of
  the disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMS) family and the γ-secretase containing
  complex, respectively, then the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) is released from
  the membrane and translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a transcriptional activation
  complex with CSL and coactivators (CoA), thereby inducing the transcription of target
  genes.
