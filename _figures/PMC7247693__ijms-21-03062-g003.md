caption: 'The involvement of cytokine-related signaling pathway, gut microbiome in
  CAC. This paper has been an overview of CAC carcinogenesis and cytokine-related
  signaling pathways and the gut microbiome. Various signaling pathways contribute
  to the development of CAC. Gut microbiota can contribute to both promotion (via
  activation of toll-like receptors) and suppression of the NF-κB pathway, depending
  on the bacterial species. Fatty acid metabolism contributions to CAC are also known.
  Short-chain fatty acids have a protective role in CAC carcinogenesis. In contrast,
  long chain fatty acids can lead to cancer development and progression. TLR4: toll-like
  receptor 4, IL-6R: interleukin-6 receptor.'
