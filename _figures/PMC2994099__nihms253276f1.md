caption: The Mre11 complex and Chk2 in apoptosis and tumor suppression. (A) The Mre11
  complex (MRN) functions at multiple stages in apoptotic signaling; the activation
  of ATM, which is impaired by the Mre11ATLD1 allele, and the promotion of ATM activity
  by the C-terminal domain of Nbs1 that is deleted in the Nbs1ΔC allele. ATM phosphorylates
  Chk2 and this requires the Mre11 complex, but Chk2 promotes apoptosis in the absence
  of ATM, defining a parallel pathway. , (B) The influence of the Mre11 complex and
  Chk2 on tumorigenesis. Alleles that impair the metabolism of DNA replication associated
  breaks in S and G2 (Mre11ATLD1, Nbs1ΔB or Brca1Δ or Δ11) predispose tumors in the
  absence of Chk2.,, DSBs arising from the deficient repair of programmed breaks,
  as in DNA-PKcs deficient mice (Prkdcscid), are not sufficient to promote tumorigenesis
  in the absence of Chk2. The G1/S and G2/M checkpoints are indicated in red.
