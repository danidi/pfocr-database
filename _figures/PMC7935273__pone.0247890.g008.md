caption: 'In CNS, 5-HT is synthesized from tryptophan via 5-HTP by serotonergic neurons.
  5-HT is transported inside the cell by 5-HTT receptors. An elevated level of 5-HT
  positively triggers the gene expression of MAO-A transcription factors. Exogenous
  GABA is recognized by GABAergic receptors located in the cell membrane of neurons
  and promotes the binding of cytoplasmic transcription factors (KLF11 and R1) at
  the operator region of the MAO-A gene. GABA and 5-HT together trigger the early
  synthesis of MAO-A transcription factors via a positive feedback loop, resulting
  in the synthesis of MAO-A protein. 5-HT is then catabolized into 5-HIAA by MAO-A,
  and stored either in the vesicles or transported back to the peripheral blood by
  5-HT1B/1D transporters. CNS: Central nervous system; 5-HT: 5-hydroxytryptamine;
  5-HTTP: 5-hydroxytryptophan; 5-HTT: 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter; MAO-A: Monoamine
  oxidase-A; GABA: γ-aminobutyric acid; KLF11: Kruppel-like factor 11; R1: Repressor
  transcription factor of MAO-A; FOXO1: Forkhead box protein O1; 5-HIAA: 5-hydroxy
  indole acetic acid; 5-HT1B/1D: 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter 1B/1D; Ub: Ubiquitin.'
