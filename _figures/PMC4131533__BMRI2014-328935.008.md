caption: '(a) Interaction network of differentially expressed miRNAs and their targets:
  network construction can be divided into two components: miRNA-target and target-target
  interaction, and candidate miRNA targets were predicted by mRDB. Target-target pairs
  interaction were searched from STRING database. In the network yellow nodes represented
  miRNAs and pink nodes represented targets, red lines denote miRNA-target interaction,
  and blue line denotes target-target interaction. These differentially expressed
  miRNAs predicted to be involved in TGFbeta signaling pathway. (b) MSTN signaling
  in skeletal muscle and miRNAs involved in the pathway: TGFb legend binds to the
  activin receptor two beta which interact with the TGFBR1 and they form a receptor
  complex, and mature myostatin inhibited by follistatin binds to the receptor complex
  which in turn phosphorylates regulatory SMADs, such as SMAD2 or 3. Phosphorylated
  regulatory SMADs are recognized by and associated with mediator co-SMADs, such as
  SMAD4, and translocated into the nucleus to interact with target gene promoter cis-elements
  and to regulate myostatin-specific gene expression. miRNAs were predicted to regulate
  the genes in TGFb signaling.'
