caption: Schematic representation of how mitochondrial metabolites accumulated upon
  mutation of the indicated TCA cycle enzymes activate the EMT. A common pathway affected
  by these metabolites is the epigenetic suppression of a family of antimetastatic
  microRNAs, miR200, via the inhibition of histone demethylases (KDMs) and DNA demethylases
  (TETs). Of note, in the case of 2HG, the suppression of miR200 is indirect, and
  occurs via activation of Zeb1/2. See the text for more details. FH=fumarate hydratase;
  SDH=succinate dehydrogenase; IDH=isocitrate dehydrogenase.
