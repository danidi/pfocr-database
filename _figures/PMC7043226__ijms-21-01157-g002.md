caption: 'Proposed metabolic pathway of AAI and AAII which leads to their activation.
  AAI and AAII are reduced by NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and cytochrome
  P450 1A1/1A2 (CYP1A1/2) into N-hydroxyaristolactams, which can further bind to DNA
  to form AA-DNA adducts, including7-(deoxyadenosin-N6-yl) aristolactam I and II (dA-AAI
  and dA-AAII), and 7-(deoxyguanosin-N2-yl) aristolactam I and II (dG-AAI and d G-AAII).
  N-hydroxyaristolactams can also react with sulfotransferases (SULTs) to form N-sulfoxyaristolactam,
  which can be transformed into aristolactam nitrenium ions? (There is still a matter
  of debate on the conversion of N-sulfoxyaristolactam into aristolactam nitrenium
  ions, hence the question mark in .) These DNA adducts lead to tumor suppressor Tp53
  gene mutations.'
