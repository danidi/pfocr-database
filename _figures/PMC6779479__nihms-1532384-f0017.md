caption: We recruited a large family cohort with DCM and generated patient-specific
  induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from several patients (n=5) and healthy individuals
  (n=2). We next utilized gene-edited isogenic iPSC lines (n=4) and patient heart
  tissues to address the intriguing question why patients with LMNA-DCM have increased
  manifestation of cardiac arrhythmias. The electrophysiological studies of mutant
  iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) demonstrated that LMNA mutation was the cause
  of increased arrhythmogenicity in LMNA-mutant iPSC-CMs. We also found that the LMNA
  mutation caused haploinsufficiency in LMNA, which led to abnormal calcium homeostasis
  in mutant iPSC-CMs through up-regulation of calcium handling genes. Whole transcriptome
  profiling (RNA-seq) further demonstrated an abnormal activation of PDGF pathway
  in mutant iPSC-CMs. The inhibition of PDGF signal pathway by treatment of siRNA
  or FDA-approved drugs such as sunitinib and crenolanib could rescue the arrhythmic
  phenotype of LMNA-mutant iPSC-CMs. Cross-analysis of various ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq,
  and RNA-seq revealed a possible underlying mechanism that haploinsufficiency of
  LMNA could disrupt global chromatin conformation, resulting in abnormal gene expression
  of mutant iPSC-CMs. These findings were further corroborated by studies in cardiac
  tissues from healthy and LMNA-DCM patients, thus validating a novel mechanism of
  LMNA-DCM pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.
