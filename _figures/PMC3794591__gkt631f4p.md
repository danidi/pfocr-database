caption: The diauxic shift and its subprocesses. On depletion of glucose, yeast switches
  from fermentation to respiratory growth on non-fermentable carbon sources such as
  glycerol, lactate, ethanol and fatty acids. Resulting pyruvate and acetyl-CoA is
  used to restore glucose and produce energy via gluconeogenesis and the TCA cycle,
  respectively. As described in the main text, we created pathway maps for each involved
  subprocess using CellDesigner (). The maps are organized as exemplarily depicted
  in , and each regulation is clickable and connected to the corresponding annotations
  designed in our annotation system (), enabling a seamless tracing of the evidence
  from the schematic representation of a regulation in one of the maps down to the
  exact place in the curated literature.
