caption: The illustration of the present work. PXR translocates from the cytoplasm
  to the nucleus of the cells when bound to and activated by ligands, then activated
  PXR binds to target genes’ DNA xenobiotic response elements (XREs) as a heterodimer
  or heterotetramer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Then induce the transcription
  of the target genes. PXR could be activated by SGD, and then bind to XREs of CYP3A4
  and MDR1, induce the transcription of them, finally affect the metabolism of other
  drugs

papertitle: Gancao (Glycyrrhizae Radix) provides the main contribution to Shaoyao-Gancao
  decoction on enhancements of CYP3A4 and MDR1 expression via pregnane X receptor
  pathway in vitro.
