caption: Postulated targets of action of β2-adrenergic agonists in DOK7 patients.
  DOK7 is part of the AChR clustering pathway. Simplified, DOK7 forms a dimer that
  interacts with and activates MUSK, and induces rapsyn-dependent AChR clustering,
  in cooperation with nerve-derived agrin (AGRN). This pathway is crucial for post-synaptic
  assembly. In DOK7 patients, the AChR clustering pathway and thereby post-synaptic
  assembly is impaired. The marked response of DOK7 patients to β2-adrenergic agonists
  suggests that β2-adrenergic agonists can compensate in some way for the impaired
  AChR clustering pathway (due to loss of DOK7 function). Thus, we hypothesize that
  β2-adrenergic agonists improve neurotransmission by stabilizing post-synaptic NMJ
  structure in DOK7 patients.
