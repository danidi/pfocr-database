caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was utilized to generate network connections of
  the EHE secretome. In the depicted network NF-κB was identified as a central node.
  Nodes are depicted as molecule names over shapes. Shaded shapes represent focus
  molecules and open shapes represent molecules were not present in our dataset but
  placed by IPA due to their connections to the focus molecules. Single lines represent
  protein—protein interactions and arrows indicate regulatory relationship(s) between
  connected molecules. Solid lines denote a direct relationship between gene products
  while dotted lines indicate an indirect relationship. TGFβ (circle) and NF-κB (square)
  connectivity nodes are marked.
