caption: Proposed model for the mechanism by which Dectin-3 induces Mincle expression.
  Step 1, Dectin-3 functions as an initial sensor for detecting low level of TDM and
  triggers an intracellular signaling pathway leading to activation of NF-κB in a
  CARD9-Bcl10-Malt1-dependent manner. Step 2, The activated NF-κB induces the expression
  of Mincle gene, which results in significantly higher amount of Mincle expressed
  on the cell surface. Step 3, The high amount of Mincle further activates by TDM
  to induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.
