caption: ERK- and JNK-mediated phosphorylation of PKM2 is at the crossroad between
  proliferation and apoptosis. PKM2 acts as master regulator of the Warburg effect.
  Of the many posttranslational modifications, phosphorylation of PKM2 by either ERK
  or JNK1 dictates distinct outcomes. In quiescent cells, PKM2 is present as a tetrameric
  protein associated with elevated enzymatic activity. When cells receive a growth
  stimulus, activation of ERK drives phosphorylation of tetrameric PKM2. Phosphorylated
  PKM2 is then cis-trans isomerized by PIN1 allowing dissociation of tetrameric PKM2
  to monomers. Monomeric PKM2 enters the nucleus where it acts as histone-binding
  protein allowing gene expression regulation of both glycolytic enzymes and cell
  cycle regulators (i.e., c-Myc, cyclin D1). Besides, accumulation of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) in the cytoplasm promotes activation of JNK1, which can phosphorylate
  and enhance PKM2 activation, allowing cells to reduce their antioxidant capacity
  and induce apoptosis. Notably, enhanced expression of PARP14 in cancer cells suppresses
  JNK1-mediated phosphorylation and activation of PKM2, providing therefore survival
  advantages to cancer cells. PARP14 by suppressing JNK1 activity contributes to maintain
  low PKM2 activity and, combined with a robust glycolysis, leads to an accumulation
  of glycolytic intermediates, including precursors of nucleic acids, lipids, and
  amino acids. This accumulation provides a metabolic bottleneck allowing glycolytic
  intermediates to be redirected toward biosynthesis, fueling through the pentose
  phosphate pathway for DNA synthesis and thereby contributing to the rapid cell proliferation
  seen in tumors
