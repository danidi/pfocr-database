caption: Model for PIKfyve enzymatic activities, their regulation by hVac14, and intracellular
  roles of phosphorylated products. PIKfyve is a dual-specificity enzyme that synthesizes
  PtdIns(3,5)P2 or PtdIns(5)P in a cellular context (, ) and phosphorylates protein
  substrates in vitro, including itself (, ). PIKfyve-phosphorylated products likely
  control distinct intracellular functions. PIKfyve-catalyzed synthesis of PtdIns(3,5)P2,
  positively regulated by physically associated hVac14, controls MVB size, MVB morphology,
  and traffic of fluid-phase markers at later stages of the endocytic pathway ( and
  this study). hVac14's regulatory role in PIKfyve-catalyzed synthesis of PtdIns(5)P
  is confirmed only in vitro (this study). A possible role for PIKfyve-directed PtdIns(5)P
  synthesis in actin remodeling and GLUT4 dynamics has been suggested (). PIKfyve-directed
  phosphorylation of the kelch β-propeller transport factor p40, a Rab9 effector that
  controls late endosome-to-TGN transport, is documented in vitro (), and no direct
  evidence is presently available for the role of PIKfyve activity in this transport
  step. Possible activation of PIKfyve protein kinase by hVac14 has not been examined.
