caption: Coupling of toxic and pro-inflammatory lipids and innate immune response.
  Accumulation of toxic lipid classes causes deterioration of metabolic regulation,
  and the effects of such lipids converge on inflammatory and stress pathways. Saturated
  fatty acids such as palmitate have been extensively studied for their effects in
  increasing inflammation and inhibiting insulin action. Palmitate is taken up by
  the cells via FATPs, and is involved in upregulation of cytosolic snoRNAs, which
  are implicated in ER stress. PKR is a potential kinase that links palmitate-mediated
  snoRNA upregulation to ER stress induction. PKR also activates inflammasomes and
  JNK, and promotes AP-1-mediated inflammatory gene expression. Lipotoxicity can also
  lead to ROS production from mitochondria, which is linked to inflammasome activation.
  Palmitate directly contributes to the synthesis of DAGs and ceramides. DAGs activate
  stress kinases, PKCs, and the NFκB pathway; ceramides activate JNK signaling; and
  both DAGs and ceramides cause insulin resistance via inhibition of IRS1 and AKT,
  respectively, downstream of insulin receptor (IR). Palmitate can also activate TLR4
  signaling, which leads to activation of inflammasomes and induction of inflammatory
  gene transcription factors interferon regulatory factor (IRF), NFκB, and AP-1. Cholesterol
  is taken up by the cells via scavenger receptors (e.g., CD36). Accumulation of oxidized
  cholesterol or cholesterol crystals also leads to induction of TLR4, PKR, and stress
  kinase (JNK and p38) signaling or inflammasome activation and pro-inflammatory gene
  expression, which are central players in atherosclerosis progression.
