caption: Proposed formyl-THF synthesis pathway in the presence and absence of formate.
  Formyl-THF may be synthesized directly from formate via formate-THF ligase (Fhs).
  In the absence of formate, we propose that serine is a precursor for formyl-THF
  synthesis. While no annotated phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH) or serine-pyruvate
  aminotransferase (SPT) is annotated in C.thermocellum, alanine-glyoxylate transaminase
  (AGAT) may function as a SPT. Annotated gene numbers (Clo1313) are indicated in
  brackets. Enzyme E.C. numbers are provided for enzymes which are not annotated in
  C. thermocellum. THF tetrahydrofolate; GK glycerate kinase; GDH glycerate dehydrogenase;
  PGDH 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT phosphoserine aminotransferase); SGAT
  serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase; GlyA serine hydroxymethyltransferase; MetF methylene-THF
  reductase; FolD bifunctional methylene-THF dehydrogenase/methylene-THF cyclohydrolase;
  Pfl pyruvate:formate lyase
