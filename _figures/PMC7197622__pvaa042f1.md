caption: Molecular mechanism of actions and proposed advantages of statins in COVID-19.
  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of
  coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), enters the cell through angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2). Once in the cell, SARS-CoV-2 causes ACE2 down-regulation, thus
  reducing its protective effects on various tissues. Coronaviruses are known to induce
  a proinflammatory host response via the activation of the Toll-like receptor (TLR)–MYD88–NF-κB
  pathway. Statins are available worldwide, and are low-cost, safe drugs with lipid-lowering
  and immunomodulatory effects. In experimental models, statins inhibit the MYD88–NF-κB
  proinflammatory pathway and promote ACE2 up-regulation. Through these mechanisms,
  statins may prove beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Statins may also counteract hyperlipidaemia
  caused by some antiviral and immunosuppressive treatments currently used for COVID-19.
