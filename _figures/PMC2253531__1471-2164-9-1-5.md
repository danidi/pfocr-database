caption: Induction of immune response to Wolbachia infection in S2 cells. Activation
  of both Toll and Imd pathways result in up-regulation of Dorsal and Relish, which
  might lead to a specific antimicrobial expression profile against Wolbachia. Negative
  cross talk between Imd and JNK pathway is also observed [48].
