caption: Process and mechanisms of blood vessel formation. (A) Vascular quiescence
  is maintained by the Ang1-Tie2 signalling pathway. Ang1 is expressed in perivascular
  SC and binds to the Tie2 receptor on EC in a paracrine fashion to stabilise the
  vasculature. EC in turn store Ang2. (B) Vascular activation is induced by multiple
  factors, such as hypoxia, VEGF and shear stress of blood flow on the vascular wall,
  and Ang2 is released from EC and competes with Ang1 to bind the Tie2 receptor. The
  autocrine antagonising effect of Ang2 on Ang1-Tie2 signalling activates the ECs
  by enabling them to react to growth factors, such as VEGF and FGF. EC that lack
  Ang2 production are likely to fail to respond to exogenous growth factors. (C) Angiogenesis
  is a crucial mechanism and process for neovascularisation where vascular sprouting
  and elongation take place. The angiogenesis process relies on the EC-SC interaction
  and it is fine-tuned through growth factor signalling pathways and remodelling of
  the ECM. Activated EC express cytokine receptors which respond to exogenous VEGF,
  FGF, IGF and TGF-α signalling to promote cell survival, cell migration, cell proliferation
  and vascular permeability. Simultaneously, activated EC produce PDGF which binds
  to PDGFR-β on SC to promote their proliferation via the Erk1/2 signalling pathway.
  SC play a critical role in ECM remodelling during angiogenesis besides the secretion
  of angiogenic growth factors. Proteinases such as MMP, PA and collagenase are released
  from the SC to cleave ECM proteins to facilitate cell migration and vascular elongation.
  The process can be interrupted by TIMPs and PAIs, which target and antagonise MMP
  and PA. (D) Vascular maturation is seen as the neovasculature start sustaining a
  regular blood flow. The tissue reperfusion enables the overexpression of Ang1, and
  the restored Ang1-Tie2 signalling in turn suppresses Ang2 production and encourages
  Ang2 storage, stabilising the vascular cells while increasing the vascular diameter.
  (E) Vasculogenesis is another mechanism of neovascularisation. The mobilised progenitor
  cells from bone marrow penetrate the ischaemic tissue and incorporate with the newly
  formed local vascular network. Ang1, angiopoietin1; Ang2, angiopoietin 2; EC, endothelial
