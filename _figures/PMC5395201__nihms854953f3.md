caption: 'Overexpression of cyclin D may disrupt the Rb pathway at several points:
  (a) it competes with p16 for interaction with cdk4/6, which then becomes activated
  to phosphorylate Rb (top); (b) cyclin D-cdk4/6 complexes sequester the cdk inhibitors
  p21 and p27 so that they are unavailable to block cdk2 (bottom). Cyclin E-cdk2 can
  then act downstream of Rb to initiate cell cycle progression into S phase. See text
  for details.'
