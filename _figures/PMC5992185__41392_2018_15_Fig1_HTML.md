caption: Regulation of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway by Ski and SnoN. In the absence
  of TGF-β, the Ski and SnoN proteins interact with Smad4 to inhibit the expression
  of TGF-β target genes, such as Smad7 and Skil, by recruiting other corepressors
  and HDACs to their promoters. Then, TGF-β induces the phosphorylation of Smad2/3
  proteins to form the R-Smad/Smad4 complex, which associates with specific transcription
  factors and cofactors to modulate the expression of its target genes

papertitle: Transcriptional cofactors Ski and SnoN are major regulators of the TGF-β/Smad
  signaling pathway in health and disease.
