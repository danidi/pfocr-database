caption: Figure 1. FcRn-mediated antitumor immunosurveillance relies on the cross-priming
  of CD8+ T cells in the presence of DC-derived IL-12. Normal intestinal epithelial
  cells (IEC) undergo neoplastic transformation in response to a variety of cues (1,2).
  The death of neoplastic cells results in the release of tumor-associated antigens
  (TAAs), either alone (during necrosis) or as part of apoptotic bodies (during apoptosis)
  (3). Cross-reactive natural IgGs form immune complexes (ICs) with TAAs or tumor-derived
  apoptotic bodies (4). These ICs are taken up by tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells
  (DCs), bind to the neonatal Fc receptor for IgG (FcRn) and are routed to an antigen-processing
  pathway that culminates in the presentation of tumor-derived epitopes onto MHC class
  I molecules at the cell surface (5). The interaction of naïve CD8+ T cells with
  the TAA/MHCI molecules results in the activation of tumor-targeting cytotoxic T
  cells (6a). The cross-linking of FcRn by ICs also leads to the secretion of interleukin-12
  (IL-12) by DCs, which promotes the complete activation of CD8+ T cells (6b). IL-12
  also stimulates local plasma cells to secrete additional tumor-reactive IgGs (7).
  The killing of cancer cells by cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes increases the release
  of TAAs, thereby creating a positive feedback loop enabling potent FcRn-mediated
  antitumor immunity (8).
