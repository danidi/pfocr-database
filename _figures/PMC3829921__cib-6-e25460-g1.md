caption: 'Figure 1. A schematic diagram illustrating the pathways and Rabs involved
  the exocytic/endocytic boundary in a cytokinesis cell: Modes of transport from early
  or recycling endosomes to the intracellular bridge (midbody), may involve different
  pathways regulated by Rab21, Rab11 or Rab35. Moreover, arrive to midbody transport
  vesicles from the exocutic pathway (labeled with Rab8). We also include in the scheme
  other Rabs protein (such as Rab4, Rab5 and Rab6) that regulate cell cycle as mentioned
  in the text.'
