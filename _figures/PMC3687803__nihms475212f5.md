caption: The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway. In the absence of Shh, Ptch 1
  suppresses signaling by smoothened (Smoh). Binding of Shh to Ptch 1 relieves this
  inhibition. Activation of Smoh leads to the activation and translocation of transcription
  factors of the Gli family into the nucleus, with subsequent changes in gene expression
