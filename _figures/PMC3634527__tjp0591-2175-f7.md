caption: Upper panel, a model of basal gastric acid secretion in wild-type mice. Circulating
  gastrin (from antral G-cells, not shown) is thought to stimulate basal acid secretion
  largely by releasing histamine from ECL cells. Somatostatin from D-cells appears
  to exert tonic inhibition on acid secretion primarily by inhibiting histamine from
  ECL cells. Acetylcholine released from the intrinsic neurons in response to tonic
  vagus activity is thought to promote acid secretion via M3 receptors (M3R) on parietal
  cells but also by inhibiting tonic somatostatin release from D-cells. Lower panel,
  lack of cholinergic innervation in the gastric mucosa of GFRα2-KO mice does not
  impair basal acid secretion presumably partly because of compensatory upregulation
  of muscarinic receptor constitutive activity. The gastrin–histamine pathway may
  also be altered in the KO mice (as indicated by question marks; see Discussion for
  details). The role of neuropeptides (VIP, PACAP and GRP that are coexpressed in
  the mucosal cholinergic nerve fibres) in basal acid secretion is not clear. CCK2R,
  gastrin receptor; H2R, histamine H2 receptor, M3R, muscarinic M3 receptor; SSTR2,
  somatostatin receptor.
