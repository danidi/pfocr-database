caption: General microbial metabolic pathways in the oil reservoirs. The pathways
  in the oil reservoirs were reconstructed by functional genes annotation. Briefly,
  hydrocarbons were oxidized aerobically in the shallow subsurface oil reservoirs
  or anaerobically in the deep subsurface oil reservoirs. The metabolites such as
  acetate and H2 and were linked to methanogenesis from CO2 reduction, acetoclastic
  methanogenesis, or syntrophic acetate oxidation (SAO). The genes involved in the
  pathways were similar with sequences from different taxa, the abundances of which
  were listed aside the pathway.
