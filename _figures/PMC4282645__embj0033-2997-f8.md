caption: The Hippo pathway is activated by upstream signals such as high cell density
  and actin cytoskeleton remodelling. βPix, which exists as a dimer or a trimer in
  the cytoplasm, forms a multiprotein complex with both Lats and Yap, acting as a
  scaffold to promote phosphorylation of Yap/Taz by Lats and resulting in cytoplasmic
  accumulation of Yap/Taz.
