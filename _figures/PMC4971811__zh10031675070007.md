caption: Proposed model for increased IL-6 and leptin production caused by global
  Zip14 deletion. Increased cytosolic zinc due to ZIP14 inhibits cytokine signaling.
  Systemic endotoxemia and/or LPS administration leads to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  activation and induction of the NF-κB pathway. Without surface expression of ZIP14,
  zinc is trapped in intracellular compartments, where it is unable to inhibit activities
  of the NF-κB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways, thereby increasing IL-6 and leptin production.
