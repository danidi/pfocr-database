caption: A, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) of plasma membrane proteins such as
  the transferrin receptor (TfR) occurs at a rapid rate (≈10 % min−1) due to interactions
  between specific sequence motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of the internalized
  proteins and clathrin adaptor proteins such as AP-2. Following internalization into
  clathrin-coated vesicles, the TfR is delivered to the early endosome, located at
  the periphery of the cell and characterized by the presence of rab5a and EEA1. The
  TfR leaves the early endosome with a short half-time, and accumulates in the endosomal
  recycling compartment (ERC), located in the pericentriolar region of the cell, due
  to the longer time for exit from this compartment. Proteins destined for degradation
  in lysosomes are sorted away from recycling proteins in the early endosome. B, suggested
  models for regulation of neurotransmitter receptors by endocytosis. Plasma membrane
  receptors exist in two states, free receptor and immobilized receptor concentrated
  at synaptic sites. The relative proportions of free and immobilized receptor may
  vary for different receptor types. The amount of free receptor in the plasma membrane
  is regulated by the rate of delivery from the biosynthetic pathway, and the rate
  of recycling through the endosomal pathway. Downregulation of free receptor can
  be achieved by stimuli that lead to enhanced endocytosis (CME). Different stimuli
  may cause distinct modifications that determine whether the receptor can be rapidly
  recycled to the cell surface through the ERC (green diamond) or is destined to be
  degraded in the lysosome (red diamond). An acute increase in synaptic receptor may
  be achieved in the absence of new protein synthesis by varying combinations of lateral
  recruitment of free receptor to the synaptic pool and an increase in the level of
  free receptors by changes in kend or kexo.
