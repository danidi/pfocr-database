caption: Following Jang et al. regarding the neural differentiation mechanism of cold
  plasma. Plasma treatment directly induced an increase in extracellular NO and targeted
  mitochondria. NO contends with O2 for binding to the active site of the cytochrome
  c oxidase, mitochondrial electron transport chain complex IV, and reversibly impeding
  its activity. Mitochondrial •O2− is generated by virtue of an electron reduction
  of O2 by means of obstructing electron transfer in the electron transport chain.
  Then, mitochondrial •O2− further leads to the production of intracellular H2O2,
  which could activate the Trk/Ras/ERK signaling pathway in specific by playing the
  role of an intracellular messenger, and finally resulted in neural differentiation
