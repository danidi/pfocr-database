caption: 'Biochemical markers of bone turnover. Blue boxes/arrows represent bone formation
  markers: bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP); osteocalcin (OC); propeptides
  of type I procollagen (P1NP and P1CP). Orange boxes/arrows represent bone resorption
  markers: pyridinoline (PYD); deoxypyridoline (DPD); carboxy-terminal crosslinked
  telopeptide of collagen type I (CTX-I); amino-terminal crosslinked telopeptide of
  type I collagen (NTX-I); Hydroxyproline (Hyp); hydroxylysine (Hyl); bone sialoprotein
  (BSP); osteopontin (OP); tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b); cathepsin
  K. Green boxes represent regulators of bone turnover: receptor activator of NF-κB
  ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), dickkopf-1 (DDK-1) and sclerostin. During
  the process of bone remodeling, osteoblasts produce RANKL and OPG that regulate
  the differentiation and maturation of osteoclasts. Osteoclastic activity is measured
  by the quantification of its lysosomal enzymes: cathepsin K and TRAP5b. The degradation
  of bone collagen type-I releases CTX-I and NTX-I (following degradation by cathepsin
  K), PYD, DPD and Hyp/Hyl. During the bone resorption process, calcium and enzymes
  from the bone matrix such as BSP and OP are released. Bone formation is a process
  associated with the release of BALP and OC-specific osteoblast enzymes. Osteoblasts
  secrete to the extracellular space collagen type I as a procollagen type-I molecule;
  afterward, its terminals are cleaved releasing P1NP and P1CP. In the presence of
  DDK-1 and sclerostin, the Wnt pathway is downregulated and consequently osteoblastic
  differentiation is inhibited. In bone metastasis (BM), matrix metalloptoteinases
  (MMPs) are produced by bone stromal cells and bone metastatic cells. These proteases
  are able to degrade collagen type-I originating carboxy-terminal crosslinked telopeptide
  of type I collagen (ICTP).'
