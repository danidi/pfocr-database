caption: 'Shown are key pathways involved in lipid import (e.g. de novo lipogenesis)
  and lipid export (e.g. phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis pathways: cytidine 5′-diphospho
  (CDP)-choline pathway, and phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathway).
  De novo lipogenesis induction includes the induction of stearoyl-CoA desaturase
  (SCD), the enzyme that desaturates 16:0 and 18:0 at the Δ9 position in the acyl
  chain to produce 16:1n7 and 18:1n9 respectively. 16:1n7 and 18:1n9, in turn, are
  incorporated into cholesterol esters (CE), triacylglycerols (TG), and phospholipids.
  The PEMT pathway involves the sequential methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE) to phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME), phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine
  (PDME), and finally to PC by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) which is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) in the process. The CDP-choline pathway involves the conversion of diacylglycerol
  (DG) to PC by incorporation of CDP-choline, which is converted to cytidine 5′-monophospho
  (CMP)-choline in the process. The fatty acids 18:0, 20:4n6, 20:5n3, and 22:6n3 are
  preferentially incorporated into PC synthesized via the PEMT pathway, and a relative
  increase in these fatty acids indicates a relative increase in flux through the
  PEMT pathway. The fatty acids 16:0, 18:2n6, and 18:1n9 are preferentially incorporated
  into PC synthesized via the CDP-choline pathway, and a relative increase in these
  fatty acids indicates a relative increase in flux through the CDP-choline pathway.'
