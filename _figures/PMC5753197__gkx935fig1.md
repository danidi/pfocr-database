number: Figure 1
caption: A typical MetaCyc pathway. A short pathway was selected for this figure;
  the average number of metabolites in a MetaCyc pathway is 12.8, with the largest
  pathway containing 204 metabolites. The enzymes in this pathway have not yet been
  classified by the Enzyme Commission and were assigned M-numbers (see text). The
  green captions are links to the upstream pathways that produce the inputs for this
  pathway.
