caption: Key components of the Rho/ Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein
  kinase (ROCK) signalling pathway. Various extracellular stimuli (growth factors
  and hormones) bind to cell membrane receptors, which subsequently act upon guanine-nucleotide-exchange
  factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) to regulate activation of Rho
  GTPase proteins. Once in its GTP-bound ‘active’ state, Rho GTPase binds to ROCK
  (ROCK1/2) to stimulate key downstream effectors (Refs , , ). ROCK-mediated phosphorylation
  of myosin light-chain (MLC) promotes phosphorylation of myosin and increased actomyosin
  contraction. Activation of LIMK by ROCK leads to phosphorylation and inactivation
  of the actin-depolymerising protein cofilin, altering actin filament organisation.
  Collectively, activation of key downstream effectors of Rho causes changes in motility,
  proliferation and other essential cellular processes.
