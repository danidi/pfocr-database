caption: TRIM37 represses gene expression through a non-canonical PRC1/2-mediated
  silencing pathway. (Left) The canonical model for PRC1/2-mediated gene silencing.
  PRC2 first interacts with the promoter and catalyzes H3K27 trimethylation using
  the PRC2 subunit and histone methyltransferase EZH2. The H3K27 trimethylation mark
  is then recognized by PRC1 followed by RNF2-catalyzed H2A mono-ubiquitination. (Right)
  TRIM37-mediated target gene silencing. TRIM37 associates with PRC2 and promotes
  extensive changes in gene expression that include the silencing of multiple tumor
  suppressors. TRIM37 is also required for PRC1 occupancy, which presumably is mediated
  by PRC2 as in the canonical pathway.
