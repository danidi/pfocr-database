caption: The figure depicts sphingolipid metabolites that participate in the early
  steps of sphingolipid biosynthesis. The pathway maps are overlaid by the fold changes
  in subclasses of sphingolipid metabolites between the control group and other groups
  by asterisks indicating the statistical significance on the right side (* = P<0.05,
  ** = P<0.01; n = 8). The content of each sphingolipid metabolite was determined
  as the mean of eight independent parallel samples.
