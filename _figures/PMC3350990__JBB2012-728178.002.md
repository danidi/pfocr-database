caption: 'Bioinformatic analysis of the differentially expressed proteins.The list
  of the MS-identified protein spots from 2D-DIGE was subjected to String (v. 8.3)
  analysis to reveal functional interactions between the deregulated proteins. Interacting
  proteins are connected by lines of different colors, according to the color code
  shown at the bottom of the figure. The reported values close to the lines indicate
  the confidence scores, as revealed by the functional interaction analysis. The original
  graphic output was modified to fit the proteins in the blue and green boxes, according
  to their classification under the gene ontology descriptors “Molecular function:
  nucleoside triphosphatase activity” and “KEGG pathway: MAPK signaling pathway,”
  as revealed by the DAVID (v. 6.7) annotation system.'
