caption: Colorectal carcinogenesis follows a stepwise sequence where normal colonic
  epithelium transforms into adenomatous polyps followed by progression to malignant
  carcinoma. Specific miRNAs such as miR-143 involve in the initiation of colorectal
  cancer. Neoplastic cells may acquire the ability to invade or spread to distant
  through complex processes including directional activation of proteolytic enzymes,
  epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and translocation of cancer cells. miR-146
  promote invasion via targeting MMP proteins and miR-200 family contributed to epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition. As a part of metastatic process, colorectal cancer cells must enter
  the bloodstream. miR-21, miR-29c and miR-22, among others, modulate colorectal cancer
  cell intravasation. Once tumor cells enter the bloodstream, they utilize specific
  mechanisms to avoid immune system attack. Tumor-derived exosomes containing miR-146a,
  miR-29a and miR-21 affect lymphocyte development and function. Metastatic colonization
  is the final step during cancer progression. It was demonstrated miR-126, miR-26b
  and miR-146 promote tumor growth at the metastatic sites. Furthermore, angiogenesis,
  which represents the growth of new blood vessels, is also an essential component
  for colorectal cancer growth and distant metastasis. miR-27b, miR-143, miR-126 and
  miR-145 were shown as a critical role in the regulation of angiogenesis and the
  VEGF pathway.
