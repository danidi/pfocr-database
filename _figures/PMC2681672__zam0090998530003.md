caption: (A) Proposed pathway for the biosynthesis of the 4-ethylidene-tetrahydropyrrole-2-carboxylic
  acid moiety in tomaymycin, which is the suggested substrate for the NRPS enzymes
  catalyzing diazepine ring formation. The branching points for the anthramycin, sibiromycin,
  and lincomycin A biosyntheses are indicated. (B) Proposed pathway for the biosynthesis
  of the 4-hydroxy-5-methoxyanthranilic acid moiety in tomaymycin, which is the suggested
  substrate for the NRPS enzymes catalyzing diazepine ring formation.
