caption: Overview of RNAi pathways in aedine mosquitoes. (Left) miRNA pathway. Primary
  miRNA transcripts are processed by Drosha in the nucleus to pre-miRNAs. After their
  transport to the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs undergo further cleavage by Dicer-1 to mature
  miRNAs. miRISC complexes containing Ago-1 regulate cellular gene expression by translation
  inhibition after hybridization to mRNA targets. (Middle) siRNA pathway. Long dsRNA
  precursors that have endogenous (transposable elements, viral DNA forms) or exogenous
  (viral replication intermediates) origin are cleaved by Dicer-2 and its co-factor
  R2D2 to siRNAs and vsiRNAs. siRISC complexes containing Ago-2 subsequently scan
  parasitic RNA populations (transposon transcripts, viral transcripts and genomic
  RNAs, RNAs derived from viral integrations in genome) to trigger their destruction.
  (Right) piRNA pathway. In aedine mosquitoes, an expansion of PIWI-class Argonaute
  genes is observed which are expressed in somatic tissues and are involved in transposon
  control but possibly also in antiviral defense and cellular gene regulation. ssRNA
  precursors from various origins (transposable elements, viral mRNAs and genomic
  RNAs, transcripts from viral DNA forms, cellular gene transcripts) are processed
  to primary piRNAs by a Dicer-independent mechanism. While Piwi-4 does not directly
  interact with piRNAs, it was proposed that it acts as an important factor to activate
  the production of secondary piRNAs by the ping-pong mechanism. In the ping-pong
  cycle, piRNAs of antisense orientation (U1 bias) are mostly associated with Piwi-5
  and possibly also with Piwi-6. On the other hand, piRNAs of sense orientation (A10
  logo) are loaded by Ago-3. The piRNA ping-pong cycle is considered an important
  amplification mechanism to regulate the abundance of transcripts of transposon,
  viral or cellular origin. pri-miRNA, primary miRNA; pre-miRNA, precursor miRNA;

  description: Overview of RNAi pathways in aedine mosquitoes. (Left) miRNA pathway.
    Primary miRNA transcripts are processed by Drosha in the nucleus to pre-miRNAs.
