caption: The liver responds to iron signals to regulate hepcidin production. Hepatic
  iron accumulation leads to increased BMP6 production, which is an important ligand
  for the HJV/BMP receptor complex on the surface of hepatocytes. The activation of
  the BMP signaling pathway leads to nuclear translocation of SMAD1/5/8 with SMAD4
  and subsequent activation of hepcidin transcription. Circulating iron–bound transferrin
  (Fe3+-Tf) also stimulates hepcidin production by activating the BMP/HJV/SMAD signaling
  pathway. However, the exact details of the necessary and sufficient interactions
  of iron-bound transferrin with transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), transferrin receptor
  2 (TFR2), and HFE at the surface of hepatocytes to stimulate hepcidin expression
  are still unknown. Other modulators such as matriptase-2 are important for regulating
  iron-induced signals that affect hepcidin production.
