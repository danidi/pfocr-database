caption: Retinoid cycle of retina. The visual chromophore 11-cis-retinal forms a covalent
  Schiff base with lysine 296 (Lys 296) of opsin. Vision is initiated when a photon
  is captured by 11-cis-retinal; as a result, the chromophore is isomerized to all-trans-retinal.
  With all-trans-retinal still covalently bound to opsin, the activated pigment transitions
  to the metarhodopsin II conformation, the Schiff base is hydrolyzed, and all-trans-retinal
  is reduced to all-trans-retinol by RDHs. Alternatively, some all-trans-retinal reacts
  with PE in the lipid bilayer of photoreceptor outer segments to form NRPE, which
  is transported by ABCA4 and then hydrolyzes to release PE and all-trans-retinal.
  The latter is subsequently reduced to all-trans-retinol. Within the RPE cell, all-trans-retinol
  is esterified by the enzyme lecithin retinol acyl transferase (LRAT) and is isomerized
  from the all-trans configuration to the 11-cis-retinol by RPE65. The alcohol is
  then oxidized by 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (11cRDH) to 11-cis-retinal. The bisretinoid
  synthesis pathway (orange) is initiated when NRPE, rather than hydrolyzing to all-trans-retinal
  and PE, reacts with a second molecule of retinaldehyde. A multi-step pathway leads
  to formation of the intermediate dihydropyridinium-A2PE. Automatic oxidation of
  dihydropyridinium-A2PE with loss of two hydrogens generates A2PE, the immediate
  precursor of A2E and loss of one hydrogen generates A2-DHP-PE; phosphate hydrolysis
  of the latter produces A2-DHP-E. A2E, lysoA2PE, and A2-GPE are produced from A2PE.
  Via an alternative pathway, all-trans-retinal dimer forms from the condensation
  of two all-trans-retinals. Reaction of the all-trans-retinal dimer with PE with
  formation of a protonated Schiff base linkage generates all-trans-retinal dimer-PE
  (atRALdi-PE), and phosphate hydrolysis of the latter yields all-trans-retinal dimer-ethanolamine
  (atRALdi-E).
