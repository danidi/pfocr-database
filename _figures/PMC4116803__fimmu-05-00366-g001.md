caption: Improving γδ T cell functions by TLRs in combinatorial therapy. (A) TLR agonists
  induce effector function of γδ T cells through IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6 secretion, and
  increased expression of CD107a. (B) IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6 secreted by γδ T cells
  and TLR agonists promote the maturation of dendritic cell. (C) γδ T cells upregulate
  CD86 and MHC I expression on DCs and are themselves activated through up-regulation
  of CD25, CD69, and cytokine production thereby modulating each other’s function.
  (D) Co-stimulation of γδ T cells with TLR agonists and IL-1β secreted by dendritic
  cells promote their polarization toward IL17 producing cells. (E) γδ TCR also recognizes
  the specific molecular patterns such as IPP, which are induced upon inhibition of
  mevalonate pathway by bisphosphonates. Moreover, NKG2D receptor on γδ T cells recognizes
  MICA/B or ULBP expressed on tumor cells. This binding enhances release of perforins
  and granzymes by the γδ T cells leading to tumor cell lysis. (F) TLR agonists act
  as adjuvants and can induce CD54 expression and downregulation of MHC class 1 on
  tumor cells. Interaction between CD54 and its ligand CD11a/CD18 trigger effector
  functions in γδ T cells. Downregulation of MHC class 1 molecule on tumor cells result
  in reduced signaling through the inhibitory receptor NKG2A on γδ T cells, which
  enhances the cytotoxic potential of γδ T cell.
