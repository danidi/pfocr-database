caption: Schematic representation of S100A7-mediated signaling that inhibits proliferation
  and motility in ERα+ breast cancer. S100A7 overexpression in ERα+ cells may down-regulate
  the β-catenin/TCF4 pathway by regulating the expression and phosphorylation of GSK3β.
  The β-catenin/TCF4 pathway may in turn down-regulate the expression of downstream
  targets such as cyclin D1 and c-myc in S100A7-overexpressing ERα+ cells. Therefore,
  the β-catenin/TCF4 pathway may be responsible for decreased proliferation and tumor
  growth in S100A7-overexpressing cells. In addition, S100A7 may modulate migration
  through enhanced co-localization and interaction of β-catenin and E-cadherin in
  the membranes of ERα+ cells.
