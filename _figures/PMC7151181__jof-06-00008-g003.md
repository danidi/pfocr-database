caption: Signal transduction pathways activated by GlcNAc. GlcNAc induces a pathway
  that acts through the Ngs1 and Rep1 transcription factors to induce the GlcNAc catabolic
  genes. It also induces a cAMP-independent pathway to stimulate hyphal growth (dashed
  line). These pathways do not require metabolism of GlcNAc. However, if GlcNAc is
  catabolized it makes the extracellular environment more alkaline, which activates
  signaling through the Rim101 pathway that synergizes with GlcNAc to stimulate hyphal
  morphogenesis and gene induction. The wavy green line in the plasma membrane indicates
  the pH sensing complex. Lines with an arrowhead indicate activation and lines with
  a blunt tip indicate negative regulation.
