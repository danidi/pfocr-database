caption: Negative regulators act at multiple points along the RLR signaling pathway
  to inhibit activation of RIG-I and MDA5, or to prevent their interaction with MAVS.
  ARL16, ARL5B, and possibly LGP2 prevent RIG-I and MDA5 from recognizing and binding
  RNA ligands. A20, NOD2, and LGP2 may inhibit initial activation of RIG-I, whereas
  TRIM13 and TRIM59 may inhibit MDA5 activation. FAT10 stops activated RIG-I from
  translocating to MAVS, and Atg5-Atg12, SEC14L1, and USP15 all prevent proper CARD-CARD
  interaction between RIG-I and MAVS. De-ubiquitinating enzymes, such as USP15, USP3,
  USP25, and USP21, remove the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains required for RIG-I
  and MDA5 activation, thus de-activating the RLRs. In contrast, E3 ubiquitin ligases,
  such as RNF125, RNF122, and c-Cbl K48-ubiquitinate RIG-I and MDA5, targeting them
  for degradation by the proteasome.
