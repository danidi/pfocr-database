caption: 'A working model: N-Myc differentially regulating miR-421/ATM pathway contributes
  to ADT resistance and Enzalutamide resistance development of prostate cancer. N-Myc
  overexpression, if occurs in androgen-responsive stage (PCA cells), can overcome
  the ADT-induced senescence by downregulating ATM expression via miR-421 and promotes
  the outgrowth of ADT-resistant cancer cells. In contrast, N-Myc overexpression,
  if occurs in androgen-independent CRPC stage, up-regulates ATM expression by cooperating
  with EZH2 to suppress miR-421 expression and then de-repress its suppression on
  ATM. The N-Myc-induced upregulation of ATM contributes to the Enzalutamide resistance
  development and promotes the migration ability of CRPC cells'
