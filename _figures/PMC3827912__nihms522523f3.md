caption: Purine metabolism and the formation of ITP and XTP. IMP is the first purine
  nucleotide formed in the de novo synthesis pathway. IMP is converted to either AMP
  or GMP, the latter through XMP as an intermediate. IMP and GMP can also be made
  from the free bases hypoxanthine and guanine by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
  (HGPRT) in the salvage pathway. Similarly, AMP can be synthesized from adenine by
  adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT). AMP and GMP are sequentially phosphorylated
  to ATP and GTP by nucleoside monophosphate kinases and nucleoside diphosphate kinase.
  These enzymes may also work on IMP and XMP, providing one means of generating ITP
  and XTP. Highlighted in green are the functional groups that differ between ATP
  and ITP and between GTP and XTP. ATP and GTP contain amino groups, while ITP and
  XTP contain keto groups. The amino groups can undergo deamination to keto groups.
  Hence, this deamination of ATP and GTP is another mechanism that can produce ITP
  and XTP.
