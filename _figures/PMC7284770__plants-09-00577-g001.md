caption: Putative biosynthetic pathway of phenylpropene (PP)-type oils in perilla.
  In the text, the oil types of each strain of perilla are represented as PP-em, PP-m,
  PP-md, PP-emd, and PP-mdn, meaning that each strain mainly contains elemicin + myristicin,
  myristicin, myristicin + dillapiole, elemicin + myristicin + dillapiole, and myristicin
  + dillapiole + nothoapiole, respectively.
