caption: Abnormalities in the tumour vasculature result in hypoxia and acidosis of
  the tumour microenvironment (TME), which in turn contribute to immunosuppression
  via several mechanisms. These mechanisms include increased accumulation, activation,
  and expansion of immunosuppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells; recruitment of inflammatory
  monocytes and tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and reprogramming of TAMs from
  an anticancer M1-like phenotype towards the pro-tumour M2 phenotype; suppression
  of dendritic cell (DC) maturation, which results in impaired antigen presentation
  and activation of tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs); and expansion
  of abnormal endothelial cells (ECs) with immunosuppressive phenotypes. Importantly,
  the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)–programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1)
  pathway is often activated in the TME as a mechanism to evade anticancer immune
  responses, with upregulation of PD-L1 expression on TAMs, DCs, and ECs, as well
  as on tumour cells. In addition, tumour-infiltrating CTLs typically upregulate PD-1,
  marking them as dysfunctional or ‘exhausted’ and limiting their cytotoxic potential
  against tumour cells. Overall, the consequence of aberrant tumour angiogenesis and
  vascular abnormality is an immunosuppressive TME. ANG2, angiopoietin 2; CCL, C-C-motif
  chemokine ligand; CXCL12, C-X-C-motif chemokine ligand 12; CSF1, macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor 1; FASL, FAS antigen ligand; GM-CSF, granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; TGFβ, transforming growth factor β.
