caption: Schematic model of regulatory pathways involved in Mycn stabilization. In
  proliferating cells, Mycn is initially phosphorylated at serine 62 by cyclin-dependent
  kinase 1/CyclinB. The S62-phosphorylated protein is stabilized and competent to
  enter the nucleus. Nuclear Mycn binds to its partner, the helix-loop-helix transcription
  factor Max and stimulates the transcription of a target genes important in cell
  cycle, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. This priming phosphorylation
  at S62 allows the binding of Gsk3β, as well as Pin1 and PP2A in a complex also containing
  Axin. Active Gsk3β phosphorylates Mycn at threonine 58, producing doubly phosphorylated,
  stabilized and transcriptionally active Mycn. In a Pin1-mediated process, PP2A dephosphorylates
  the S62 phosphate, enabling binding of ubiquitin ligase Fbw7. Fbw7 subsequently
  drives poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Mycn. Aurora A kinase
  can bind to and stabilize polyubiquitinated/phosphorylated Mycn, potentially leaving
  it competent to bind to Max and activate transcription. In this model, upstream
  signaling starts at the membrane with receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are
  either activated by ligand or by constitutively activating mutations (in Alk, for
  example). RTKs activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which catalyzes the
  conversion of phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate
  (PIP3). PIP3 then binds to Akt, localizing it to the membrane and allowing the phosphorylation
  and activation of Akt by membrane bound Pdk1 at threonine 308. Active Akt then phosphorylates
  Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (Gsk3β) and inactivates it, blocking Gsk3β-mediated
  phosphorylation of Mycn T58 and thereby stabilizing Mycn. Akt also activates mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) through several indirect signaling mechanisms including
  through Tsc2/Tsc1 and Rheb. mTOR exists in two distinct complexes. mTORC1 complex,
  the rapamycin sensitive form, consists of mTOR bound to multiple effector proteins,
  including Raptor and Lst8, and is important for the promotion of global translation
  through S6K and 4EBP. mTORC1 also directly phosphorylates and inhibits PP2A, enabling
  the accumulation of doubly phosphorylated, active Mycn and contributing to the general
  proliferation-promoting downstream effects of the PI3K/Akt/Mycn pathway (). The
  mTORC2 complex, also known as Pdk2, contains mTOR, rictor, Lst8 and mSin1. mTORC2
  phosphorylates Akt at serine 473 further activating this kinase. Inhibitors of this
  pathway could potentially destabilize Mycn. These inhibitors are currently in clinical
  trials or in clinical development and are denoted by red octagons. The Aurora A
  Kinase inhibitor is denoted by an orange octagon, which represents targeted kinase
  inhibition, but no anticipated activity against Mycn itself. Relevant references
  are contained within the corresponding text.

  description: Schematic model of regulatory pathways involved in Mycn stabilization.
    In proliferating cells, Mycn is initially phosphorylated at serine 62 by cyclin-dependent
    kinase 1/CyclinB. The S62-phosphorylated protein is stabilized and competent to
    enter the nucleus. Nuclear Mycn binds to its partner, the helix-loop-helix transcription

    of Mycn. Aurora A kinase can bind to and stabilize polyubiquitinated/phosphorylated
    Mycn, potentially leaving it competent to bind to Max and activate transcription.
    In this model, upstream signaling starts at the membrane with receptor tyrosine
    kinases (RTKs), which are either activated by ligand or by constitutively activating
    mutations (in Alk, for example). RTKs activate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),

    (). The mTORC2 complex, also known as Pdk2, contains mTOR, rictor, Lst8 and mSin1.
    mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt at serine 473 further activating this kinase. Inhibitors
    of this pathway could potentially destabilize Mycn. These inhibitors are currently
    in clinical trials or in clinical development and are denoted by red octagons.
    The Aurora A Kinase inhibitor is denoted by an orange octagon, which represents
