caption: Schematic model in which FGF2 stimulation of osteoblast differentiation is
  partially through modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Loss of endogenous FGF2
  results in reduced Wnt10b mRNA expression, reduced Lrp5/Lrp6 mRNA expression, reduced
  β-catenin mRNA and protein expression, and reduced inactive phosphorylated GSK3β
  protein expression, all of which lead to reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling directly regulates osteoblast transcription factors, including Runx2 and
  probably ATF4. The reduced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and reduction of Dkk2 mRNA expression
  (important for terminal osteoblast differentiation) probably contribute to decreased
  osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in Fgf2−/− mice. However, exogenous
  FGF2 promoted β-catenin nuclear accumulation and induced inhibited kinase GSK3β,
  which could increase Wnt signaling in Fgf2−/− BMSCs and probably contributes to
  rescue the decreased osteoblast differentiation in Fgf2−/− BMSCs. LEF/TCF, lymphoid
  enhancer-binding factor 1/T cell-specific transcription factor.
