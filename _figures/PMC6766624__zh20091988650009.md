caption: Schematic of the proposed mechanisms for 6-shogaol-mediated protection against
  renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Renal IR injury induces proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokine synthesis via the NF-κB pathway and necrotic and apoptotic
  renal tubular cell death, leading to kidney tissue damage. 6-Shogaol protects against
  renal IR injury by inhibition of the canonical NF-κB pathway and activation of heme
  oxygenase (HO)-1 synthesis via p38 MAPK activation. Our previous study of oxidant
  preconditioning (500 µM H2O2 followed by 16 h of recovery) also protected against
  subsequent necrotic insult by lethal dose of H2O2 via the p38 MAPK → HO-1 pathway
  (). However, unlike 6-shogaol-mediated attenuation in proinflammatory cytokine generation
  in renal proximal tubule cells, oxidant preconditioning → p38 MAPK activation failed
  to attenuate proinflammatory cytokine induction in human renal proximal tubule cells.
  This discrepancy in protection against proinflammatory cytokine generation further
  highlights gaps in our mechanistic understanding of stress-activated p38 MAPK signaling
  in renal protection.
