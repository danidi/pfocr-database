caption: Baicalein treatment in neurons activates class I PI3K/Akt to induce HIF1α-mediated
  Epo/VEGF expression with a minimal effective concentration at 35 nM. Its direct
  inhibition of 12/15-LOX additionally contributes to the induction of neuronal VEGF,
  but not Epo. In astrocytes where PHD2 is in low abundance and 12/15-LOX is lacking,
  high concentration of baicalein (35 μM in minimum) is required to activate class
  I PI3K/Akt. However, baicalein-induced upregulation of astrocytic Epo/VEGF is sensitive
  to LY294002 (LY) but not the selective class I PI3K inhibitors, suggesting that
  other LY294002-inhibitable protein kinases (PKs) mediate the effect. Furthermore,
  baicalein-induced astrocytic Epo expression is HIF1α-independent and possibly by
  HIF2α that reportedly mediates astrocytic Epo gene transcription and can also be
  stabilized when PHD2 is inhibited. Since brain neurons and astrocytes may access
  nanomolar and micromolar concentration of baicalein respectively when the compound
  is applied peripherally, the increased production of Epo and VEGF from both cell
  types may thus be converged to provide neuroprotection against excitotoxic or other
  neurotoxic insults.
