caption: 'Biotin synthesis pathway in E. coli and B. subtilis. Question marks indicate
  unknown or undefined steps in the pathway. In E. coli, two molecules of acetyl-CoA
  are condensed to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (1). To enable the entrance
  into the fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) pathway that is catalyzed by FabH (2), BioC
  (3) adds a methyl-moiety to malonyl-CoA. After two cycles of elongation, BioH (4)
  removes the methyl moiety, and pimeloyl-ACP is formed. BioF (5) condenses l-alanine
  with pimeloyl-ACP to form 7-keto-8-amino pelargonic acid (KAPA). KAPA is converted
  to 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid by BioA (6), and BioD (7) forms the ureido ring by
  addition of CO2. In the last step, BioB (8) catalyzes the conversion of dethiobiotin
  (DTB) to biotin. In B. subtilis, biotin is synthesized from pimelate as a substrate
  and not directly from pimeloyl-ACP. The source of pimelate is still unknown. It
  is predicted that BioI (9) cleaves intermediates of the FAS to form pimeloyl-ACP.
  As BioF of B. subtilis cannot convert ACP ester, a thioesterase (10) cleaves pimeloyl-ACP
  to generate pimelate. Pimelate is then activated by BioW (11) with CoA to pimeloyl-CoA.
  BioF of B. subtilis (12) adds l-alanine to pimeloyl-CoA and KAPA is formed. The
  following steps for biotin synthesis are the same as in E. coli. Additional abbreviations:
  ACP, acyl carrier protein; CoA, coenzyme A; SAM, S-adenosyl-l-methionine; SAH, S-adenosyl-l-homocystein;
  AMTOB, S-adenosyl-2-oxo-4-thiomethylbutyrate; 5′-DOA, 5′-deoxyadenosine.'
