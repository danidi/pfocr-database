caption: TGFβ antagonists and inhibitors. Blocking the TGFβ signaling pathway provides
  for a unique therapeutic opportunity against tumor metastasis. As such, several
  approaches to develop new therapeutic tools that would interfere with TGFβ signaling
  have been undertaken in recent years. Blocking antibodies, peptide inhibitors, kinase
  inhibitors, soluble receptors, and antisense oligonucleotides are all being tested,
  some of which are at different phases of clinical trials. In future, more specific
  approaches may involve targeting specific microRNAs or making use of RNA interference
  approaches to block expression of specific downstream TGFβ pro-metastatic targets
  (e.g., p21).
