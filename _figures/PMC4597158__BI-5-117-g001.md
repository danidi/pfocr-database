caption: The biogenesis of bioactive EXOs commences with the fusion of multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) with the plasma membrane and release of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs)
  as EXOs. This phenomenon, which was initially observed as a mechanism for the removal
  of transferrin receptor during maturation of reticulocytes, is now considered as
  an alternative secretory pathway of the endocytic network; readers are directed
  to see a previously published book chapter on "Biological membranes and barriers"
  for the vesicular trafficking. In fact, the MVBs are intermediate cellular compartments
  originated from endosomes through invagination of the limiting endosomal membrane.
  The ILVs, which are not yet released to the extracellular space, can drive the formation
  of EXOs (50-100 nm in diameter) that are released on the exocytosis of MVBs. Unlike
  EXOs, the ECTOs (50-350 nm in diameter) are ubiquitous vesicles assembled at and
  released from the plasma membrane. The fusion of liberated EVs with target cells
  is initiated through interaction of the external faces of cell membranes, which
  is mediated by fusogens such as syncytin-1. Both EXOs and ECTOs show rolling and
  membrane fusion potential with rapid dissolution and specific markers such as CD63
  and CD61 for EXOs, and TyA and C1q for ECTOs.  represents schematic illustration
  of various extracellular vesicles in communication with other cells such as B and
  T lymphocytes and the biogenesis of such vesicular machineries.
