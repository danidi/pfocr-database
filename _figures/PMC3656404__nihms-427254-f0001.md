caption: Signaling pathways involving PKR-mediated inflammation and immune regulation.
  (A) PKR is required for inflammasome activation. PAMPs and DAMPs promote the autophosphorylation
  and activation of PKR. Active PKR physically interacts with NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4,
  and AIM2 and promotes the release of inflammasome-dependent cytokines, including
  IL-1β, IL-18, and HMGB1. LPS, lipopolysaccharide. (B) The activation of PKR is induced
  by many different stimuli, such as cytokines, bacterial and viral infection, and
  DNA damage. Activation of PKR results in its dimerization and autophosphorylation.
  The activation of PKR in turn triggers the production of IFN and proinflammatory
  cytokines through transcriptional regulatory signals. In addition, the FADD–caspase-8
  pathway mediates the proapoptotic activity of PKR, whereas the eIF2α-LC3 pathway
  mediates the proautophagic activity of PKR. Both apoptosis and autophagy are important
  in the regulation of inflammation and immunity.
