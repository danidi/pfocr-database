caption: 'RNA interference (RNAi) pathway members in malacostracans. a Exogenous viral
  dsRNA is imported into the cytoplasm and is cleaved by the endoribonuclease from
  the RNase III family, Dicer. Cleaved fragments of dsRNA are known as small interfering
  RNAs (siRNAs). Dicer contains both Piwi/Argonaute/Zwille (PAZ) and helicase domains.
  Dicer activates the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is comprised of
  Argonaute-2 and the transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP). Single-stranded
  siRNAs are incorporated into a RISC complex, upon which the siRNAs form complementary
  base-pairing to target mRNA and mRNA cleavage ensues. Other RISC-associated proteins
  include R2D2 and Loquacious in D. melanogaster. Dicer is also involved in microRNA
  (miRNA) biogenesis. Encoded by the genome, miRNAs are involved in the regulation
  of gene expression in the RNAi pathway. Transcribed by RNA polymerase II, Pri-miRNA
  is a long primary transcript of miRNAs and is processed into a stem-loop containing
  pre-miRNA by the microprocessor complex consisting of a ribonuclease III enzyme
  Drosha and Pasha, which is also known as DGCR8, protein. Pre-miRNA enters the cytoplasm
  and is cleaved by Dicer to generate a mature miRNA that is then integrated into
  the RISC complex. The miRNA-targeted transcript is either degraded or silenced.
  Phylogenetic trees of b Dicer, c Drosha, d TRBP and e Pasha are constructed using
  the maximum-likelihood method from an amino acid multiple sequence alignment. Taxa
  labels are depicted as their respective colour codes. Bootstrap support values (n = 1000)
  for all trees can be found in Additional file : Figure S14. Scale bar represents
  substitution per site'
