caption: Conversion of pancreatic α-cells into β-like cells upon GABA or arthemether
  administration. (Left) The GABAA receptor, expressed in all α-cells, interacts via
  its cytoplasmic portion with the scaffold protein gephyrin. In the α-cell nucleus,
  the transcription factor Arx represses the expression of Pax4 to maintain the α-cell
  identity. (Right) The GABA signaling pathway can be activated either by way of GABA's
  interaction with its receptor, or by arthemether's fixation on gephyrin. Both compounds
  eventually induce Arx inactivation (by down-regulation or translocation outside
  the nucleus), and thus the loss Pax4 repression, which triggers the conversion of
  α-cells into insulin-expressing β-like cells.
