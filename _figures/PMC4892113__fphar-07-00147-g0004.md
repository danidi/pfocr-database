caption: Role of Spermidine-TCPTP in the complex dynamics of pro- and anti-autophagic
  factors. Autophagy requires the coordinated activation of multiple factors. Several
  Atg proteins are recruited within the ULK1 complex during vesicle nucleation and
  within the ubiquitin-like conjugation systems Atg12-UBL and LC3-UBL during phagophore
  elongation, and completion. The main autophagy repressor, mTORC1, exerts its inhibitory
  action by phosphorylating ULK1. mTOR interacts with the proline-rich Akt, newly
  synthesized in the PI3K/PI3P/Akt pathway, downstream of EGFR, and TGF-βR signaling,
  which in turns responds (inter-alia) to cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6, and
  IL-1β/TGF-β. A mTORC1 antagonist and autophagy promoter is AMPK. Upon activation
  from non-immune stress factors including starvation, hypoxia, ROS (e.g., , H2O2,
  OH.), and RNS (e.g., peroxynitrite) via ATM/LKB1, AMPK prompts autophagy. AMPK is
  directly involved in the formation of ULK1 complex and cooperates with Becl 1-VPS34
  complexes, pro-autophagy adapters involved in nucleation of autophagosome membrane.
  While ROS simulate EGFR activation, other environmental stressors (e.g., MP2.5)
  have an opposite effect, by inhibiting PI3K/PI3P/Akt. Agonistic activity of spermidine
  on TCPTP would down-regulate both EGFR and TGF-βR and their downstream effectors.
  Yet, the prevalent, established mode of action of spermidine in autophagy entails
  the inhibition of EP300, leading to reduced histone acetylation (particularly histone-3),
  and, consequently, to Atg (particularly Atg7) expression and autophagosome elongation
  and closure. Spermidine activity on EP300 is similar to that exerted by low cytoplasmatic
  levels of Ac-CoA due to scarce nutrient availability, a situation that also activates
  AMPK. Ac-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; ROS, reactive oxygen species; RNS, reactive nitrogen
