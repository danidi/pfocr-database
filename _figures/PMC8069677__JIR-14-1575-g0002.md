caption: Mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  requires two signals to mediate both IL-1β and IL-18 production, including the priming
  and the activation signals. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by a variety of
  the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular
  patterns (DAMPs). The first signal activates the NF-κB pathway, leading to upregulation
  of pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and NLRP3 protein levels. The second signal is activated
  in response to various stimuli (eg, K+ efflux, ROS and cathepsin B) and promotes
  the assembly of ASC and pro-caspase-1, leading to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome
  complex. The activation drives NLRP3 inflammasome to mediate active caspase-1 production,
  followed by the maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. Active caspase-1 also
  cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD), which allows the N-terminal domain of GSDMD to form
  pores in the plasma membrane. This facilitates IL-1β and-18 release and causes a
  lytic form of cell death (pyroptosis), which supports inflammation.
