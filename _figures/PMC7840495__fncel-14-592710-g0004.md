caption: Endocannabinoid signaling in striatal neurons. DGLα synthesizes 2-AG in the
  postsynaptic neuron. Postsynaptic 2-AG activates presynaptic cannabinoid-1 receptor
  (CB1R). The activated CB1 receptor via feedback inhibition leads to suppression
  of glutamate release at MSN synapses, thereby relieving repetitive behavior. However,
  mice with knockout of DGLα exhibit decreased striatal 2-AG levels, resulting in
  unrestricted synaptic glutamate release via an absence of feedback inhibition, thereby
  leading to elevated grooming behavior in mice. Impaired endocannabinoid signaling
  is involved in the alteration of striatal activity, contributing to the development
  of repetitive behavior. CB1R, cannabinoid type 1 receptor; DGLα, diacylglycerol
  lipase alpha; 2-AG, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol; dMSN, direct pathway medium spiny neurons.
