caption: Key signaling nodes in prostate cancer that regulate epithelial plasticity.
  This is a simplified and broad schematic describing the interplay of EP signaling
  and transcription with AR in aggressive PC. Signaling through multiple and interacting
  pathways leads to EMT through a variety of mechanisms. Signaling by EGFs, IL6, GAS6,
  chemokines, and TGF-β, through their respective receptors, can lead to increased
  expression of EMT transcription factors (TFs). EMT TFs, including but not limited
  to TWIST, SNAIL, Slug, and ZEB1/2, can then upregulate mesenchymal biomarker expression
  (e.g., N-cadherin, vimentin, OB-cadherin) and downregulate E-cadherin expression.
  TWIST also inhibits FGFR2 expression. These TFs can interact with AR in varying
  ways. For example, TWIST and Slug can activate AR, while ZEB 1 and AR are reciprocal
  inhibitors of each other. AR also upregulates NKX3-1, which in turn represses TWIST.
  When Wnt ligands are present, β-catenin moves to the nucleus and activates target
  genes linked to EMT and survival. β-Catenin can also act as a cofactor with AR.
  DAB2IP negatively regulates Ras and NF-κB signaling and, when epigenetically silenced
  by EZH2, leads to EMT and PC metastasis through activation of the Ras and NF-κB
  pathways. Loss of DAB2IP also activates AR through phosphorylation by Src kinase
  and β-catenin pathways. AR activation can lead to increased TMPRSS2-ERG fusion,
  which in turn can activate EMT through ZEB1/2 and increase β-catenin signaling.
  FGFs signal through the PI3K/Akt pathway to promote tumor proliferation, and the
  PI3K/Akt pathway also negatively regulates AR. DHT is the AR ligand, and when available
  to tumor cells, also promotes growth. Note that not all pathways discussed in the
  manuscript are shown in this figure
