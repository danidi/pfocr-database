caption: Application of anti-TLR for the analysis of molecular mechanisms of TLR.
  Expressed TLRs are transported from ER to plasma membrane or endolysosome (1 and
  2). In endolysosome, nucleic acid-sensing TLRs are cleaved and the N-terminal fragment
  binds to the C-terminal fragment (3). After the modification, TLR recognize ligand
  and signaling pathway is activated (5). TLRs on cell surface recognize ligand and
  activates signaling pathway. Some of them are internalized by the recognition of
  ligand or spontaneous trafficking (4). For the analysis of these molecular behaviors
  of TLR, monoclonal anti-TLR is well exploited. Amount and expression pattern among
  cell types are analyzed by flowcytometry. Subcellular distribution is observed by
  immunofluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, flowcytometry following the immunostaining
  with or without detergent is able to discriminate the distribution between cell
  surface and intracellular particle. Proteolytic cleavage and binding of nucleic
  acid-sensing TLR are detected by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. In addition
  to these application for detection, several antibodies have inhibitory effect on
  the response of TLRs. Words in black frames, blue frames, and orange frames are
  the name of organelle, the molecular behavior of TLR, and the application of anti-TLR,
  respectively
