caption: Efferocytosis can mediate host defence against pathogens in some settings
  but, in other settings, efferocytosis can be usurped by pathogens to promote their
  spread. Several examples are illustrated. a | Engulfment of infected apoptotic cells
  by macrophages leads to bacterial killing and prevents secondary necrosis of the
  infected cells, thereby preventing bacterial release. b | A similar pathway occurs
  when certain bacteria induce pyroptosis in infected cells, in which pore-induced
  intracellular traps (PITs) in these cells are recognized by efferocytosis receptors.
  c | Other types of bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
  (MRSA), can evade efferocytic uptake and killing by inducing expression of the don’t-eat-me
  signal CD47 on the cells they infect. Efferocytosis of infected cells by dendritic
  cells can also participate in host defence (not shown). d | Recognition and internalization
  of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)-infected apoptotic cells by a protein complex
  comprising AXL, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and RAN-binding
  protein 9 (RANBP9) leads to cross-presentation of viral antigen on MHC class I molecules
  and subsequent generation of antiviral CD8+ T cells. Other types of effector T cells
  are activated by dendritic cells engulfing bacteria-infected apoptotic cells. e
  | Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) expressed on infected apoptotic
  cells activate the production of IL-6 and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) via
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which promotes the differentiation of CD4+ T cells to
  IL-17-producing T helper cells (TH17 cells) and suppresses the generation of regulatory
  T cells (Treg cells). f | TH17 cells are also activated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
  resulting from the engulfment of apoptotic cells. COX2, cyclooxygenase 2; GAS6,
  growth arrest-specific protein 6; Mtb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; SIRPα, signal-regulatory
  protein-α; TCR, T cell receptor.
