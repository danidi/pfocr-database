caption: Illustration of a simplified metabolic pathway and control of the by-product
  (threonine) synthesis for increased lysine production in bacteria. A non-natural
  allosteric regulation of homoserine dehydrogenase in response to lysine was constructed
  to reduce the flux to by-product threonine. (Online version in colour.)
