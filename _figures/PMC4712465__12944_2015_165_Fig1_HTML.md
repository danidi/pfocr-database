caption: 'Scheme showing role of pro and anti-inflammatory bioactive lipids in IBD.
  For easy understanding only LXA4 has been depicted in the figure. It is to be noted
  that resolvins, protectins, maresins and nitrolipids may follow the same pathway
  as that of LXA4 from the respective precursors (EPA and DHA: eicosapentaneoic acid
  and docosahexaenoic acid respectively). Possible interaction among cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  pathway (Ach), serotonin, dopamine and LXA4 is also depicted in the figure. There
  are three classes of phospholipases that control the release of AA and other PUFAs:
  calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2), secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), and cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2).
  Each class of PLA2 is further divided into isoenzymes for which there are 10 for
  mammalian sPLA2, at least 3 for cPLA2, and 2 for iPLA2. During the early phase of
  inflammation, COX-derived PGs and lipoxygenase-derived LTs initiate exudate formation
  and inflammatory cell influx. TNF-α causes an immediate influx of neutrophils concomitant
  with PGE2 and LTB4 production, whereas during the phase of resolution of inflammation
  an increase in LXA4 (lipoxin A4), PGD2 and its product 15deoxyΔ12-14PGJ2 formation
  occurs that induces resolution of inflammation with a simultaneous decrease in PGE2synthesis
  that stops neutrophil influx and enhances phagocytosis of debris. Thus, there appears
  to be two waves of release of AA and other PUFAs: one at the onset of inflammation
  that causes the synthesis and release of PGE2 and a second at resolution for the
  synthesis of anti-inflammatory PGD2, 15deoxyΔ12-14PGJ2, and lipoxins that are necessary
  for the suppression of inflammation. Thus, COX-2 enzyme has both harmful and useful
  actions by virtue of its ability to give rise to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory
  PGs and LXs. Increased type VI iPLA2 protein expression was found to be the principal
  isoform expressed from the onset of inflammation up to 24 h, whereas type IIa and
  V sPLA2 was expressed from the beginning of 48 h till 72 h while type IV cPLA2 was
  not detectable during the early phase of acute inflammation but increased progressively
  during resolution peaking at 72 h. This increase in type IV cPLA2 was mirrored by
  a parallel increase in COX-2 expression. The increase in cPLA2 and COX-2 occurred
  in parallel, suggesting a close enzymatic coupling between these two. Thus, there
  is a clear-cut role for different types of PLA2 in distinct and different phases
  of inflammation. Selective inhibition of cPLA2 resulted in the reduction of pro-inflammatory
  molecules PGE2, LTB4, IL-1β, and platelet-activating factor (PAF). Furthermore,
  inhibition of types IIa and V sPLA2 not only decreased PAF and LXA4 (lipoxin A4)
  but also resulted in a reduction in cPLA2 and COX-2 activities. These results suggest
  that sPLA2-derived PAF and LXA4 induce COX-2 and type IV cPLA2. IL-1β induced cPLA2
  expression. This suggests that one of the functions of IL-1 is not only to induce
  inflammation but also to induce cPLA2 expression to initiate resolution of inflammation.
  Synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone inhibited both cPLA2 and sPLA2 expression,
  whereas type IV iPLA2 expression is refractory to its suppressive actions. Activated
  iPLA2 contributes to the conversion of inactive proIL-1β to active IL-1β, which
  in turn induces cPLA2 expression that is necessary for resolution of inflammation.
  LXs, especially LXA4 inhibit TNF-α-induced production of ILs; promote TNF-α mRNA
  decay, TNF-α secretion, and leukocyte trafficking and thus attenuated inflammation.
  Though the proposal presented has focused mainly on LXA4, it may be mentioned here
  that there could be a significant role for other anti-inflammatory bioactive lipids
  such as resolvins, protectins, maresins and nitrolipids in IBD. Thus, in all the
  places wherever LXA4 is mentioned, it may be assumed that resolvins, protectins,
  maresins and nitrolipids also have an important role to play along with LXA4'
