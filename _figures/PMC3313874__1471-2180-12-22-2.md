caption: Networks built using differentially expressed genes in uninfected macrophages
  from C57BL/6 and CBA mice. C57BL/6 and CBA macrophages were cultured separately
  and then processed for microarray analysis as described in Materials and Methods.
  The cell death and lipid metabolism network (A) and the cell-cell signaling and
  interaction network (B) were modeled using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software v8.8
  (IPA-Ingenuity Systems®). The above networks are displayed as a series of nodes
  (genes or gene products) and edges (or lines, corresponding to biological relationships
  between nodes). Nodes are displayed using shapes that represent the functional class
  of the gene product as indicated in the key. Nodes marked in green were found to
  be highly expressed in C57BL/6 macrophages in comparison to CBA. Nodes marked in
  red were found to be highly expressed in CBA macrophages compared to C57BL/6. The
  unmarked nodes were not identified in our samples; however, IPA® added them to the
  networks due to their high probability of involvement in a given network. The node
  color intensity is an indication of the degree of up-(green) or down-(red) regulation
  of genes observed in the biological network analysis from uninfected C57BL/6 macrophages
  compared to CBA cells. Solid lines denote direct interactions, whereas dotted lines
  represent indirect interactions between the genes represented in this network.
