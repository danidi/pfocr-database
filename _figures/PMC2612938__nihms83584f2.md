caption: Pathways by which Mgrn1-mediated ubiquitination could modulate melanocortin
  receptor regulation of pigment production and energy metabolism. A. Mc1r signaling
  in hair follicle melanocytes regulates coat color. Activation of Mc1r by the ligand
  α-MSH results in production of the black pigment eumelanin, while suppression of
  Mc1r by the inverse agonist Agouti promotes the production of the yellow pigment
  pheomelanin. Mgrn1 may ubiquitinate either Mc1r or a downstream target, complementing
  Agouti signaling in non-mutant mice. Reduction or loss of Mgrn1-mediated ubiquitination
  in Mgrn1md-nc mice would then stimulate production of eumelanin, producing a darker
  coat. B. Mc3r and Mc4r signaling in hypothalamic neurons modulates insulin sensitivity,
  regulating energy homeostasis and body mass. Receptor activation by α-MSH increases
  insulin sensitivity, promoting leaner body mass, and receptor inhibition by AgRP
  decreases insulin sensitivity, promoting obesity. In wild-type mice, Mgrn1-mediated
  ubiquitination of possibly either the receptors or a downstream target could modulate
  melanocortin signaling in hypothalamic neurons, while in Mgrn1 null mice, a reduction
  or loss of Mgrn1 activity could then alter energy homeostasis. The role, if any,
  of Atrn in hypothalamic melanocortin signaling is unclear, although Atrn may regulate
  neuronal survival via an unknown pathway, which could be modulated by Mgrn1-mediated
  ubiquitination.
