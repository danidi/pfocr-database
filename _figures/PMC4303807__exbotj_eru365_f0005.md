caption: 'Integration between plasmodesmal regulation and various cellular signalling
  pathways. SA (top right): Activation of the SA-dependent defence pathway mediated
  by signalling components, including EDS1, ICS1, and NPR1, induces plasmodesmal closure
  through induction of PDLP5. PDLP5 localizes to plasmodesmata and stimulates specific
  callose synthases by a yet-unknown mechanism to enhance callose deposition, which
  in turn restricts plasmodesmal permeability. This response regulates SA biosynthesis
  through positive feedback, further boosting innate immunity of the plant. GA (bottom
  right): GA3 induced by dormancy-releasing chilling triggers lipid bodies containing
  a specific set of GH17 β-1,3-glucanases (BGLs) to be targeted to PD in the vasculature,
  where they degrade the dormancy callose in the sieve pores. Chilling also up-regulates
  the expression of the mobile protein FT, which moves through the newly opened sieve
  pores and into the SAM, priming it for full dormancy-breakage and bud burst. Warming
  temperatures lead to GA4 accumulation, which in combination with newly opened SAM
  plasmodesmata may facilitate movement of CENL1 from the rib meristem, further establishing
  bud burst and stem elongation; the intercellular spread of CENL1 has not yet been
  confirmed. ROS (top left): Changes in the redox status of mitochondria and chloroplasts
  leads to plasmodesmal modulation. Up- or down-regulation of ROS accumulation in
  the mitochondria (ise1) or chloroplasts (ise2), respectively, increases the plasmodesmal
  SEL (black dashed cell wall outline), whereas ROS accumulation in the chloroplasts
  (gat1) restricts plasmodesmata through callose hyperaccumulation (grey dashed cell
  wall outline). A rise in ROS level may also affect plasmodesmal complexity through
  activation of cell wall hydrolysing (CWH) enzymes. Peroxidase associated with plasmodesmata
  may alter local redox state, which in turn may also increase plasmodesmal complexity,
  or activate callose accumulation. Trx-h9 moving cell to cell may counteract ROS
  production in the neighbouring cells through antioxidant activity. Potential crosstalk
  between SA- and ROS-induced plasmodesmal closure is indicated by a dashed double
  headed arrow. Ca2+ (bottom left): Calcium influx rapidly alters plasmodesmal permeability
  in a callose-independent manner. Calcium-responsive proteins associated with plasmodesmata,
  including centrin and acto-myosin, are speculated to play a role in rapid plasmodesmal
  closure, whereas the calcium-sequestering calreticulin may offset the plasmodesmal
  response (dashed arrows).'
