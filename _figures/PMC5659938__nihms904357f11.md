caption: Alcohol exposure increases miR-21. Smad7 protein expression is then suppressed
  by miR-21. Inhibition of Smad7 leads to an increase in TGFβ1 signaling and augmentation
  of TGFβ1 gene and protein expression. TGFβ1 then amplifies miR-21 gene expression
  via positive feedback and inhibits Nrf2 (as previously shown by our group). MiR-21
  and Smad7 expression can be normalized by the Nrf2 activator, SFP, which diminishes
  TGFβ1 and TGFβ1-mediated amplification of miR-21.
