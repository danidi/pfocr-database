caption: Proposed model of Pofut1 involvement in commitment of myogenically differentiated
  cells through activation of the Notch signaling pathway. (A) In wild-type C2C12
  cells, myoblasts express Pofut1 at a basal level to correctly O-fucosylate the Notch
  extracellular domain. During differentiation, Pofut1 is differentially expressed
  with a high level in RC, leading to high activation of the signaling pathway responsible
  for proliferation and progenitor self-renewal. In parallel, a lower level of Pofut1
  could affect NICD cleavage, resulting in cell fusion at the origin of MT. The cleaved
  NICD quantity impacts the Pax7/MyoD expression balance, resulting in a cell fate
  decision between RC and MT. (B) In the Pofut1 knockdown context, the lower Pofut1
  basal level in myoblasts would alter the correct O-fucosylation of Notch receptor
  and prevent the correct cleavage of NICD. The limited signaling pathway activation
  prematurely disrupts the Pax7/MyoD expression balance, resulting in depletion of
  progenitors and earlier myoblast fusion, causing later myotube defects.
