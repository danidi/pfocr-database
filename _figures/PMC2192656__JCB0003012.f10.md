caption: PDGF-PI3K–derived pathways that affect cytoskeletal organization and cell
  migration. Model illustrating the signaling pathways initiated by the PDGF-R that
  affect actin cytoskeleton and cell migration, including the previously described
  p110/PI3K activity–dependent Rac pathway, which promotes lamellipodial extensions
  and the novel p85-PI3K regulatory subunit-triggered Cdc42 pathway. Activation of
  the Rac pathway triggers a number of effectors, of which Por 1, inducing lamellipodium
  formation, and Pak, mediating inhibition of actin stress fibers in v-Rac and v-Cdc42–expressing
  cells, are indicated (; ). Activation of the Cdc42 pathway also triggers a number
  of effectors of which, N-WASP promotes filopodia formation, and contributes to mediate
  the decrease in actin stress fibers and adhesion complexes induced by PDGF. Induction
  of both pathways control PDGF-induced cell migration on collagen.
