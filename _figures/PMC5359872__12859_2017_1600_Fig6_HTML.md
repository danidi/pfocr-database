caption: Visualization for enrichment analysis. The top 30 enriched GO terms from
  MAPK pathway proteins visualized in the GO hierarchy. Enriched GO terms are enlarged
  and colored by their p-value. The analysis is for 20 annotated proteins that are
  associated with MAPK signalling pathway. See text for the details
