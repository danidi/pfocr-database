caption: 'The effects of statin on NLRP3 inflammasome and TLRs pathways. It appears
  that the effects of statins on NLRP3 complex are related to chemistry and pharmacokinetics
  features. Lipophilic statins have more pleiotropic effects on NLRP3 complex compare
  than hydrophilic statins. In the other hand, statins with inhibition of the mevalonate
  pathway, the protein prenylation or lipidation, and decreases cholesterol production
  caused reduce TLR agonists and suppressing TLR4/MyD88/NF-ĸB pathway. Also, statins
  inhibit NF-ĸB through reduce MAPKs phosphorylation and stabilized IKB-α as an NF-ĸB
  inhibitor. Statins inhibit expression of LOX-1 receptor; therefore, they could inhibit
  the inflammation of NLRP3 through LOX-1/NF-ĸB pathway. The diabetes basic risk,
  metabolic syndrome, genetic, and lifestyle could promote NLRP3 inflammasome in presence
  statins. The statin could decrease the expression of TLRs 2 and 4, so suppressed
  NF-ĸB activity. At the genetic and molecular level, the TLR4 D299G polymorphism
  contributes in less susceptibility to cardiovascular disorders and increase response
  to statin therapy; also, statin therapy has a positive effect on miRNAs levels which
  affected on TLRs and negatively regulated TLR4 (abbreviations: LDL: low-density
  lipoprotein. OXLDL: oxidized LDL. NLRP3: Is a NLRs. CCs: cholesterol crystals. NF-ĸB:
