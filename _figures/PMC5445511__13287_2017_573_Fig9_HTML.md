caption: Diagram depicting the proposed mechanism of action of sorafenib in mesothelioma
  TICs. Sorafenib treatment causes the inhibition of MEK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
  and the downregulation of Mcl-1 expression, leading to cell cycle arrest and activation
  of the apoptotic program. Sorafenib antitumor effects are mainly ascribed to a direct
  inhibition of FGFR1 activity rather than downstream effectors, such as Raf/Ras/MEK/ERK
  pathway. Thus TIC cultures autocrinally activating FGFR1 via the release of high
  amount of bFGF are likely to be more sensitive to the drug. bFGF basic fibroblast
