caption: 'We extracted the signaling interactions between the proteomic entities that
  fell into each cluster. The signaling interactions within each proteomic cluster
  are extracted from the Pathway Commons 2 database using the PERA algorithm. Here,
  we simplified the pathway diagrams by removing the post-translational modifications
  and merging the nodes associated with identical genes (e.g., AKTpT308, AKTpS473,
  and AKT are merged to AKT node). The resulting diagrams display the known pathways
  associated with proteomic response clusters. The cluster-guided pathway analysis
  suggests that functionally related proteins (i.e., proteins on the same or related
  pathways) are enriched in distinct clusters. The phospho-proteomic entities on MAPK
  and PI3K/AKT pathways are enriched in cluster 1 (C1) of the response map. The total
  protein measurements related to MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways are enriched in a related
  but distinct cluster (C2). The level of various apoptotic proteins increase in response
  to most targeted drugs and form another distinct cluster (C4). Interestingly, EGFR
  (Both phospho and total level) and a set of EGFR related docking proteins (e.g.,
  SHC, 14-3-3-β) are also enriched in C4 possibly due to the increase in the expression
  of those entities in response to targeted drugs such as MEKi and PI3Ki. The observed
  increase in EGFR level suggests a potential feedback loop that emerges from downstream
  elements of MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are targeted by multiple agents in
  this study.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04640.010'
