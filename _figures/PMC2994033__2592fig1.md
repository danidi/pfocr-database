caption: The signaling complexes are induced by TNFα to mediate NF-κB activation,
  apoptosis, and necroptosis. Stimulation of TNFR1 by TNFα leads to the formation
  of an intracellular complex at the cytoplasmic membrane (complex I) that includes
  TRADD, TRAF2, RIP1, and cIAP1. Ubiquitination of RIP1 at K377 by cIAP1 leads to
  the recruitment of NEMO, a regulatory subunit of the IKK complex that in turn activates
  the NF-κB pathway. RIP1 is also involved in the formation of complex IIa, including
  FADD and caspase-8, to activate a caspase cascade to mediate apoptosis. Under apoptosis-deficient
  conditions, or when cells are infected by certain viruses, RIP1 interacts with RIP3
  to form complex IIb, which is involved in mediating necroptosis. The formation complex
  IIb requires the kinase activity of RIP1 that is inhibited by Nec-1. (Reproduced
