caption: Summary of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The dataset representing the
  32 genes with significantly altered expression upon NBPF1 induction in DLD1Tr21
  cells was imported into the IPA tool. (A) The top two networks obtained from the
  IPA analysis and their scores. (B) Network presentation of the most highly rated
  network. Solid lines represent a direct interaction between two gene products and
  dotted lines represent indirect interactions. Red symbols indicate input molecules
  that are downregulated upon NBPF1 expression, and green symbols represent input
  molecules that are upregulated upon NBPF1 expression
