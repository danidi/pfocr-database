caption: All four Notch receptors have been reported to play a role in multiple hematological
  malignancies. The mechanism of receptor activation and subsequent aberrant activity
  relies in some case on genetic mutations, often affecting the receptor itself (as
  in the case of Notch1 in T-ALL), but also targeting signaling negative regulators
  such as FBXW7, an ubiquitin ligase that is implicated in NICD turnover. In some
  instances, increased pathway activation is due to receptor up-regulation or increased
  expression of specific ligands, the latter occurring in tumor cells and/or stromal
  cells (see text for more details).
