caption: The Nrf2-ARE and Wnt/β-catenin/GSK-3β intertwined signaling cascades. A.
  In normal conditions, Nrf2 is inactive (Nrf2-Off”) and resides in the cytoplasm
  bound to Keap1. In response to oxidative stress and inflammation, the modification
  of Keap1 cysteine residues leads to inhibition of Nrf2 ubiquitylation and stabilization
  of Nrf2, allowing Nrf2 to accumulate in the cytosol and then to translocate into
  the nucleus where it binds to a small Maf protein and activates transcription of
  genes containing antioxidant response elements (AREs) in their regulatory regions
  (Nrf2-On”) [, , ]. In addition to its interaction with Nrf2, Keap1 also binds Cullin
  3 (Cul3), which forms a core E3 ubiquitin ligase complex through an association
  with Ring-box1 protein (Rbx1, also called Roc1) [, , ]. Besides Keap1-mediated regulation,
  two other E3 ubiquitin ligases have been found to regulate the protein level of
  Nrf2. Nrf2 is controlled by two distinct β-TrCP recognition motifs in its Neh6 domain,
  one of which can be modulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) activity phosphorylating
  a group of Ser residues in the Neh6 domain of Nrf2 [81, 82, see text]. B. In Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway, Wnt signal activation is tightly controlled by a dynamic signaling complex,
  constituted by class Frizzled (Fzd) of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) superfamily,
  the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6 coreceptors and Dishevelled (Dvl) and
  Axin adapters []. In the absence of a Wnt ligand, (Wnt-off) the signaling cascade
  is inhibited. Cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated and degraded via proteasome
  mediated destruction, which is controlled by the “destruction complex”, consisting
  of GSK3β, casein kinase 1α (CK1α), the scaffold protein AXIN, and the tumor suppressor
  adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) []. As a result, the translocation into nucleus
  is inhibited. Interruption of Wnt/β-catenin signaling also occurs in the presence
  of the Dkk’ and secreted FZD-related proteins (sFRPs) families of Wnt-antagonists,
  or Wnt inhibitory protein, WIF. Conversely, Wnt ligand binding to Fzd receptors
  at the surface of target cells (Wnt-on) triggers a chain of events aimed at disrupting
  the degradation complex via Dvl phosphorylation []. Then β-catenin is separated
  from the destruction complex, resulting in its accumulation and stabilization in
  the cytoplasm. Subsequently, β-catenin is imported into the nucleus where it can
  interact with the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and recruit transcriptional
  co-activators, p300 and/or CBP (CREB-binding protein), as well as other components
  to transcribe a panel of downstream target genes. Conditions that can direct to
  Nrf2/Wnt-On (Nrf2-activators, GSK-3-antagonists, Wnt1-agonists.) or to Nrf2/Wnt-/Off
  (PD gene mutations, ageing, inflammation, environmental toxins.) are indicated.
  Because GSK-3β crosstalk with both Nrf-ARE and canonical Wnt-signaling, inhibition
  of GSK-3β activity by molecular compounds and various enzymes represents a potential
  means to activate the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, prosurvial, neuroprotective
  and neurogenic downstream Nrf2/Wnt gene cascades (for details, see the text).
