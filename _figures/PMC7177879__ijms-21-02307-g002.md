caption: The regulatory network controlling SE induction in which the auxin-related
  epigenetic processes play a central role. A number of auxin-related miRNAs orchestrate
  the explant cell transcriptome towards embryogenic transition through regulation
  of auxin perception (miR393), biosynthesis (miR396 and miR165/166), and signaling
  (miR160, mi167, and miR390). The SE-involved miRNAs control embryogenic induction
  by targeting the TF genes with a key regulatory function in embryonic development
  including the LEC1, LEC2, and FUS3 of the LEC group; BBM (PLTs); AGL15 and WOXs
  (WOX5) genes; and a number of ARFs involved in the auxin-signaling pathway. The
  miRNAs controlling auxin perception, biosynthesis, and signaling are indicated by
  the grey, green and yellow boxes, respectively. The key TFs are marked in red including
  the genes of the LEC group, which are distinguished by red-framed boxes. Arrows
  and circle-shaped ends show the activation or repression of gene expression, respectively.
  Solid vs. dashed lines refer to the experimentally validated and suggested regulatory
  interactions that operate during SE, respectively [,,,,,,]. (2,4-D) 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
