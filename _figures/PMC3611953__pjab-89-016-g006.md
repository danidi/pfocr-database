caption: 'The proposed mechanism of activation and catalysis by [NiFe]-hydrogenase.
  The activation/inactivation pathway and the proposed catalytic cycle are shown in
  the upper 2 rows and in the lower circuits, respectively. For Dg enzyme, the EPR
  signal and FTIR wave number are correlated to the structure (3 diatomic ligands
  to Fe, omitted for clarity) in each shaded box: e.g., the top left box illustrates
  that the unready enzyme has an EPR signal Ni-A, and the FTIR wave number of its
  CO ligand is 1947 cm−1. Ni-SI, Ni-SU and Ni-R are EPR silent (−). The blank circle
  between Ni and Fe indicates the vacant bridging site. Cys* is the Cys residue substituted
  with Sec residue in the [NiFeSe]-hydrogenase, and is Cys546 for DvM enzyme, Cys530
  for Dg enzyme, or Sec493 for D. baculatum enzyme. The plain box at the top right
  shows the Ni-Fe center of DvM enzyme with sulfur species as a bridging ligand to
  Ni and Fe.) Ni(III)-S-Cys* of Ni-C1952 form is isoelectronic with Ni(II)-S+-Cys*,
  both of which contribute to the EPR signal of Ni-C1952.) The absence of the bridging
  ligand in Ni-SI form was confirmed by X-ray crystallography,) and the presence of

  studies. The potentiometric titration of the enzyme suggested the one-electron Nernstian
