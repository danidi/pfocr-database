caption: 'A simplified working model of the c-di-GMP signaling pathway in B. burgdorferi.
  Hk1 and Rrp1 are present in the same operon and are thought to comprise a TCS. The
  diguanylate cyclase activity of Rrp1 is dependent upon its phosphorylation state,
  which presumably occurs in the cell by its cognate sensor kinase, Hk1. PlzA, a c-di-GMP-binding
  protein, is hypothesized to affect multiple virulence characteristics in B. burgdorferi.
  PlzA has been shown to positively regulate BosR protein levels, which regulates
  rpoS expression. RpoS, in turn, induces expression of genes, such as ospC, which
  are known to be important for mammalian infection as well as for genes involved
  in chitobiose utilization, which was shown to be important for colonization in the
  tick. rpoS expression is also governed by the Hk2-Rrp2 TCS; thus, PlzA serves as
  the connector between both TCS in B. burgdorferi. There is also a possibility that
  the PlzA-c-di-GMP complex interacts with another target(s), mediating glycerol utilization,
  colony morphology, and chemotaxis. The levels of c-di-GMP are controlled by the
  opposing activities of Rrp1 and PdeA and PdeB, the phosphodiesterases in B. burgdorferi.
  PdeA is an EAL-domain PDE, which hydrolyzes c-di-GMP to pGpG as its major product,
  which is then subsequently hydrolyzed to GMP by nonspecific PDEs. PdeB contains
  a HD-GYP domain, which hydrolyzes c-di-GMP into pGpG transiently en route to 2 GMPs
  as the predominant end product. It is unknown if pGpG plays a role in regulating
  motility or any cellular function in B. burgdorferi. Abbreviations: AcP, acetyl
  phosphate. Thicker arrow next to PdeA indicates pGpG is the major hydrolysis product;
  thicker arrow next to PdeB indicates the major product of PdeB hydrolysis is 2 GMPs.'
