caption: The molecular mechanism of DAPK1 in AD. The activation of DAPK1 triggers
  the phosphorylation of APP at Thr668, shifting APP processing toward the amyloidogenic
  pathway and Aβ production. Moreover, DAPK1 considerably inactivates Pin1 activity
  through its phosphorylation at Ser71. The inactivation of Pin1 increases cis p-tau
  and induces the hyperphosphorylation of tau. Furthermore, DAPK1 regulates NDRG2
  phosphorylation at Ser350, which may lead to AD through significant cell death.
