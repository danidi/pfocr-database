caption: Network model of community structure and function in the HS and LS bioreactors
  during the glucose perturbation. The dotted lines and open circles indicate gas
  products. The thickness of each line represents the relative contribution of the
  pathway. The stars indicate in situ activities whose assignments to specific organisms
  are highly questionable due to the metabolic diversity of the most similar cultured
  organisms.
