caption: 'Production of bioactive sphingolipids ceramide, sphingosine, and S1P occurs
  through de novo synthesis or the salvage pathway. De novo synthesis involves the
  condensation of serine and palmitoyl CoA by serine palmitoyl transferase for form
  3-keto-sphinganine, which is rapidly reduced to dihydrosphingosine by an NADPH-dependent
  reductase. Dihydrosphingosine is converted to dihydroceramide with the addition
  of fatty acyl CoA by dihydroceramide synthase which is desaturated to form ceramide.
  Ceramide can be converted to glycosphingolipids by glucosylceramide synthase and
  back to ceramide by glucosylceramidase. Ceramide can also be formed by the salvage
  pathway through the action of sphinogmyelinases. Ceramide can be phosphorylated
  to ceramide-1-phosphate or deacylated by ceramidase to form sphingosine. Sphingosine
  is quickly phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to form S1P. S1P can be dephosphorylated
  by S1P phosphatases, forming sphingosine, which can be converted back to ceramide
  with the addition of free fatty acid by ceramide synthases. S1P can be terminally
  degraded by S1P lyase to form hexadecanal and phosphoethanolamine. FFA: free fatty
  acid, Glu-Cer Synthase: glucosylceramide synthase, Glu-CDase: Glucosylceramidase.'
