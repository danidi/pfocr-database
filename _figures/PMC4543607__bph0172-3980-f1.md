caption: Major EDCF-mediated signalling pathways in hypertension and diabetes. When
  intracellular Ca2+ levels are increased via the activation of GPCR by, for example,
  ACh, ADP or Ca2+ ionophore (A23187), AA is produced from membrane phospholipids
  by PLA2. AA is metabolized to endoperoxides [PGG2 and PGH2] through activation of
  COXs (COX-1 and COX-2). PGH2 is further metabolized into PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2
  and TxA2 by specific synthases including PGDS, PGES, PGFS, PGIS and TxS. All these
  prostanoids and endoperoxides can activate TP receptors in vascular SMC leading
  to contraction via multiple pathways. Although PGI2 usually leads to vasodilatation
  through activation of the IP receptor/adenylate cyclase (AC)/cAMP pathway, PGI2
  responses are impaired in some conditions, including hypertension and diabetes.
  Instead of abnormalities in the IP receptor/AC/cAMP pathway, other prostanoids such
  as PGE2, PGF2α and TxA2, and endoperoxides may be increased and then stimulate TP
  receptors. In hypertensive arteries, mainly PGI2, TxA2 and PGH2 mediate EDCF responses
  (in red). In addition to these prostanoids, PGE2 and PGF2α can also behave as EDCF
  in arteries from diabetic subjects (in blue). PGD2 another EDCF has less significant
  effects compared with other PGs. COX generates ROS. ROS are considered EDCFs themselves
  as well as enhancers/modulators of EDCF responses, since ROS (1) further activate
  endothelial and smooth muscle COX and (2) increase production of isoprostanes via
  AA, leading to TP receptor activation. COX activity is regulated and further enhanced
  by several amplifier/inducers in hypertension and diabetes. Details are described
  in the text.
