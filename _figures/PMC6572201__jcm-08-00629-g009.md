caption: A proposed molecular mechanism of EP that protects the kidney against renal
  IR injury. EP inhibits the active secretion of HMGB1 from proximal tubular cells
  during IR injury through HO-1 induction. HO-1 is a cytoprotective enzyme that reduces
  plasma HMGB-1 followed by tubular inflammation and cell death. EP activates PI3K/Akt
  and Nrf2 pathway to induce HO-1 expression; LY294002, Nrf2 or HO-1 siRNA, and ZnPP
  were used to block each signaling molecule/pathway as indicated, to study the mechanism
  of EP in this study.
