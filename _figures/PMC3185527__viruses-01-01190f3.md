caption: Illustration of the type I IFN signaling pathway and its inhibition by the
  henipavirus P, V and W proteins. IFN-α/β binds to the IFN-α/β receptor (composed
  of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits). The receptor-ligand interaction activates the Janus
  protein tyrosine kinases, TYK2 and JAK1, which in turn activate the STAT1 and STAT2
  transcription factors via tyrosine phosphorylation. The phosphorylated STATs form
  a heterodimer and translocate to the nucleus where together with IRF9, they form
  the ISGF3 (IFN stimulated gene factor 3) complex. This transcription factor complex
  binds to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and activates transcription of
  IFN-stimulated genes (ISG). The P and V proteins bind to STAT1 (and STAT2 for V)
  in the cytoplasm and prevent its activation in response to IFN. The W protein acts
  via the same mechanism but it sequesters STAT1 in the nucleus in an inactive form.
