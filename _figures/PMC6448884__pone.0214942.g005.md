caption: 'Top panel: GTS-21 was unable to suppress TNF-induced secreted alkaline phosphatase
  in a α7 nAChR and NFκB-SEAP expressing GH4C1 cell system. Bottom panel: GTS-21 reduced
  LPS-induced TNF and IL6 levels through both an α7 nAChR-dependent and an α7 nAChR-independent
  mechanism in primary mouse macrophages. In both cases, activation of the NFkB pathway
  leads to phosphorylation of IkB, and dimerization and translocation of two subunits
  of cytoplasmic NFκB (usually p50 and p65) to the nucleus to act as a transcription
  factor (Lawrence et al., 2009). In spite of the common NFkB pathway, the immediate
  effects of TNF and LPS differ in terms of the receptors and linkage to NFkB signaling,
  where GTS-21 non-nicotinic receptor actions may be taking place.'
