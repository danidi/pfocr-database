caption: Schematic model of sequential hippocampal aging changes. EARLY ADULT, Early
  age-related alterations in hippocampal gene expression suggest an aging-related
  metabolic shift from glucose to FFAs/AAs/KBs as predominant fuel source. This shift
  appears orchestrated primarily in astrocytes with upregulation of genes in pathways
  for lipid and protein catabolism and upregulation of the lysosomal pathway. INTERMEDIATE,
  Astrocytes generate increased FFAs and AAs by releasing cytokines and complement
  components that trigger microglial inflammatory degradation of the lipid- and protein-rich
  myelin sheath, generating excess cholesterol as a byproduct. MIDLIFE/LATE, Increased
  excess cholesterol triggers upregulation of astrocytic ApoE, cholesterol trafficking,
  and myelinogenic programs that enable incorporation of excess cholesterol from ApoE-containing
  lipoproteins into remyelinating oligodendrocytes for storage/disposal. Elevated
  proteolysis activates antigen-presenting pathways in microglia. Together, the increased
  inflammation and energy-expensive glial activation induce damage in neurons (dashed
  outline) and compete for energy with neuronal signaling pathways, resulting in cognitive
  impairment.
