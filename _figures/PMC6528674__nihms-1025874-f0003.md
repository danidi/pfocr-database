caption: Lymphocyte specific functions via non-canonical pathways involving MST1/2
  are shown. (a) Successful T cell migration requires the transport of Rab13 positive,
  LFA-1 containing vesicles to the leading edge, which is dependent on the phosphorylation
  of Rab13-GEF DENND1C by MST1 []. (b) The balance between Treg cells and TH17 cells
  is controlled by TAZ. Activation of SMAD3 and STAT3 induces TAZ expression, which
  favours TH17 cell development by preventing the binding of Foxp3 to RORγt promoting
  RORγt dependent gene transcription. In the absence of STAT3 activation, MST1 and
  TEAD prevent TAZ-mediated inhibition of Foxp3, favouring Treg cell development []
