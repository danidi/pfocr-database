caption: 'A schematic representation of the proposed PXR–p53 protein–protein interaction
  and its effects on the PXR-mediated xenobiotic responses and the p53 proapoptotic
  signaling pathway. A. Exogenous xenobiotics can act as agonists of pregnane X receptor
  (PXR). PXR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), binds to the
  PXR response element (PXRE) within the promoters of its target genes, and activates
  the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP3A4, to induce the xenobiotic
  responses. B. Cellular stresses can induce DNA damage, resulting in the activation
  of the tumor suppressor p53. Once activated, p53 binds to the p53 response element
  (p53RE) within the promoters of its target genes to induce the expression of genes
  involved in cell cycle arrest, such as CDKN1A, or proapoptotic genes that are involved
  in apoptosis to induce cell death. The protein–protein interaction of PXR and p53
  is mutually repressive: p53 physically binds to PXR and reduces CYP3A4 expression
  by decreasing the binding of PXR to the PXRE within the CYP3A4 gene promoter, whereas
  PXR reduces p53-mediated transcription activity by physically binding to p53 and
  decreasing the binding of p53 to p53RE within p53 target genes'
