caption: Ethanol signaling pathway that initiates neural crest apoptosis. Shown is
  a summary of published studies (; , 2006) and results herein. Ethanol interacts
  with a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) of unknown identity to activate Gαi2/3
  and Gβγ. Within seconds, the latter stimulates Phospholipase Cβ-mediated synthesis
  of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and calcium release predominantly
  from intracellular stores. As shown here, the mobilized calcium interacts with calmodulin
  to activate pCaMKII and thereby initiate the cell death of neural crest and neuronal
  precursors. We found no evidence for PKC activation or contributions to this ethanol-induced
  cell death. “?” indicates that the contribution of this signal to ethanol-mediated
  cell death is unknown at this time.
