caption: Illustration of eukaryotic MMR system. MutSα (heterodimer MSH2-MSH6 predominant
  in human cells) or MutSβ (heterodimer starts DNA repair by recognizing and binding
  to mismatches). Other molecules are recruited to the complex, primarily MutLα (heterodimer
  MLH1-PMS2) but also proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication factor
  C (RFC). The assembly will initiate endonuclease activity of PMS2 which makes single-strand
  breaks near the mismatch and opens exonuclease 1 (EXO1) entry sites leading to the
  final dissociation of the DNA lesion.
