caption: A Schematic Model Describing How the WIND1-ESR1 Pathway Promotes Shoot Regeneration
  in Arabidopsis.Local wound stress induces WIND1 expression at wound sites. WIND1
  directly binds the ESR1 promoter and activates its expression. WIND1 also activates
  ESR1 indirectly through enhancing the B-type ARR-mediated cytokinin signaling. ESR1
  expression is synergistically enhanced by exogenously supplied auxin and cytokinin
  to further boost shoot regeneration in vitro. ESR1 is required for the upregulation
  of key shoot regulators such as CUC1, RAP2.6L, ESR2, WUS, and STM to promote shoot
  regeneration.
