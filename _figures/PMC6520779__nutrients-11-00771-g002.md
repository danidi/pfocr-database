number: Figure 2
caption: Schematic reconstruction of the events triggered in the retina by hyperglycemia
  and reinforced by oxidative stress in a vicious cycle. Formation of advanced glycation
  end-products (AGE) as well as the activation of protein kinase C (PKC), of the polyol
  pathway, and of the hexosamine pathway, are the main diabetes-induced abnormalities
  related to diabetic retinopathy.
