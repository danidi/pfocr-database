caption: Hepatic bile acid metabolism. a Bile acids are synthesized in the liver from
  cholesterol by two metabolic pathways known as the classical (or neutral) and the
  alternative (acidic) pathway. In the classical pathway, cholesterol is metabolized
  to 7α-hydroxycholesterol by CYP7A1 and then to CA by CYP8A1 or to CDCA by CYP27A1.
  On the other hand, in the acid pathway, CYP27A1 converts cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol
  which is then metabolized by CYP7B1 into CDCA. The entero-hepatic circulation of
  bile acids is mediated by several bile acid transporters in the liver and intestine
  and regulated by the FXR/SHP and FGF19/FGFR4 pathways. After their synthesis, primary
  bile acids are excreted into bile through the bile salt export pump (BSEP). b After
  secretion in the duodenum majority of BA are transported back to the liver through
  the portal blood. BAs are reabsorbed in the liver by NTCP. In the hepatocyte, other
  transporters including MRP2 on the canalicular membrane and MRP3/MRP4, OSTα/OSTβ
  on the basolateral membrane are also capable of BA transport into systemic circulation.
  c Finally, BAs are also filtered by the glomeruli and then reabsorbed in renal tubules,
  again limiting their renal loss. ASBT sodium-dependent bile acid transporter, BSEP
  bile salt export pump, FGF15 fibroblast growth factor 15, FGF-R4 FGF receptor 4,
