caption: 'Proposed model for the novel dual functions of toll-like receptor (TLR)-10
  in regulating IFN signaling. (A) Sensing of dsRNA by TLR10 in endosomes. If TLR10
  forms homodimer/heterodimer or co-factors needed for signaling is not clear. (B)
  Activation of TLR10 recruits myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88),
  subsequently leading to decrease in interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-7 phosphorylation
  and suppress IFNβ expression. (C) Ligand sequestration: TLR10 competes with TLR3
  for dsRNA, attenuates TLR3 mediated IFNβ expression. (D) Signaling of TLR10 negatively
  regulates TLR3 expression and promotes expression of negative regulator of the signaling,
  sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1) to further suppress TLR3
  signaling and the subsequent IFNβ expression.'
