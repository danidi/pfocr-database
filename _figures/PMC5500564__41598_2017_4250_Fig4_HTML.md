caption: Differential gene expression in xenobiotics metabolism pathway between Asian
  American and Caucasian American. Up or down regulation means increase or decrease
  of gene expression in Asian American BRCA patient tumor tissues. The pathway diagram
  with differential gene expression was made using Pathview package, where pathway
  diagrams were originally obtained from KEGG database–.
