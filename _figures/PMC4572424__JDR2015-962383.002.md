caption: Effect of purple corn anthocyanins (PCA) on CCN2 expression. Anthocyanin-rich
  purple corn butanol fraction (PCB) concentration dependently mitigated HG-inflamed
  induction of CCN2. PCB also greatly inhibited HG-induced IL-8 secretion and the
  activation of Tyk2 and STAT1 and STAT3 in mesangial cells. Therefore, HG-provoked
  glomerular injury of fibrosis caused by mesangial inflammation of IL-8 was activated
  by Tyk2-STAT signaling pathway []. In addition, HG-stimulated CCN2 induction in
  human mesangial renal cells (HRMC) correlated with TGF-β-SMAD-responsive pathways
  which were blunted by PCA, evidenced by dampening HG-promoted SMAD2 phosphorylation
  and SMAD4 expression and reversing HG-inhibited SMAD7 expression in HRMCs. Moreover,
  PCA attenuated TGF-β-triggered inflammatory ICAM-1 expression and MCP-1 production
  in the mesangium, leading to the reduction of CCN2 expression [].
