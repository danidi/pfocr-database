caption: '(a) Western blot anaylsis showing SIK2 and phosphorylation of ACC and AMPKα
  in MIN6 cells cultured for 15 h in 0, 5 or 25 mM glucose. Data is representative
  of three independent experiments. (b) Integrated model for AMPK-family mediated
  control of beta cell function. Left: the AMPK-mTOR signalling: In response to glucose,
  AMPK catalytic activity (left) is inhibited due to increase in ATP: AMP ratio. This
  in turn leads to depression of TORC1 and insulin biosynthesis. Right: the SIK2-p35-CDK5-PJA2
  pathway: unlike AMPK, SIK2 protein, and in turn net activity, is increased in high
  glucose. SIK2 phosphorylates p35 at Ser91 which triggers its ubiquitination by the
  E3 ligase PJA2, resulting in activation of calcium signalling and insulin secretion.'
