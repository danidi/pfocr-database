caption: A) Major connections of the basal ganglia. Arrows denote excitatory connections
  and lines ending with circles denote inhibitory connections. The pathway which denotes
  cortical feedback via the hyperdirect pathway is highlighted with dashed lines.
  B) Summary of selected results of Tachibana et al. [], who recorded activity of
  STN and GPe neurons in intact monkey model of Parkinson’s disease, and after blocking
  various inputs to the neurons in the vicinity of the recording electrode. Red lines
  indicate inputs that when blocked caused suppression of beta oscillations while
  the blue line indicates the striatal input to the GPe that when blocked did not
  reduce significantly the power of beta oscillations in the activity of recorded
  GPe neurons. C) A resonance model which includes time delays between the excitatory
  and inhibitory populations of the cortex, time delays between STN and GPe populations,
  time delays in the inhibitory GPe-GPe connections and further time delays connecting
  the cortex to the STN. This model also includes sigmoid activation functions for
  the STN, GPe, E and I populations which describe the input-output relationships
  of neurons in the populations. w ij and T ij denote the strength and delay of synaptic
  connections between neural populations i and j, where i and j can be equal to C
  for cortex, S for STN or G for GPe. Parameters shown in green are being fitted to
  the data. D) A feedback model that is identical to the model in panel C apart from
  including the time delayed connection between the STN and cortex, which forms a
  feedback loop between STN-GPe circuit and cortex. E) A linear model with time delay
  only in the cortical feedback.
