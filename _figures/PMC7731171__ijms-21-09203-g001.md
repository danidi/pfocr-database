caption: Discoveries in the field of NLK signalling using mouse models. NLK is an
  evolutionary conserved MAP kinase known to be a negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin
  signalling pathway. Over recent years, mouse models targeting NLK have been established
  that have led to the discovery of NLK playing an important role in the function
  of organs including heart, lung, and skeleton. Additionally, multiple breakthroughs
  have been made showing that NLK regulates the function and differentiation of various
  immune cells. Finally, evidence has shown that NLK can regulate the phenotype seen
  in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Representative summaries are given of major
  findings regarding the use of mouse models to study the function of NLK signalling.
