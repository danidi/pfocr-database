caption: Overview of the ferroptosis pathway and potential targets for pharmacological
  inhibition. Lipoxygenases (LOX) and iron catalyze the peroxidation of phospholipids
  (PL). Peroxidized lipids are reduced by glutathion peroxidase 4 (GPX4), upon simultaneous
  oxidation of glutathion (GSH). However, excessive lipid peroxidation of membrane
  phospholipids induces ferroptosis. This may occur when GPX4 is inhibited, e.g.,
  by 1S,3R-RSL3 or altretamin, or when glutathion is absent. The latter can result
  from inhibition of glutathion synthesis by L-buthionine sulfoximine or from a lack
  of cystein inside the cells through inhibition of the xc-antiporter system, e.g.,
  by erastin or analogs, sorafenib, glutamate, or S-4-carboxyphenylglycine (S-4-CPG).
  Ferrostatin, liproxstatin, vitamin E, and deferoxamine are antioxidant compounds
  known to inhibit ferroptosis. Another way of inhibiting ferroptosis is provided
  by inhibition of lipid peroxidation itself by blocking LOX enzymes with loxblock-1,
  -2, -3, or baicalein.
