caption: Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) metabolism. Methionine (Met) is an essential
  sulfur-containing amino acid that is converted to SAMe by the enzyme methionine
  adenosyltransferase (MAT) using ATP as co-substrate. Two main MAT isoforms, MATI
  and MATIII, are expressed in the liver. MATIII is activated by methionine. SAMe’s
  methyl group is transferred to a large variety of substrates, such as DNA, RNA,
  proteins, phosphatidylethanolamine, glycine (Gly), and guanidinoacetate. These reactions
  receive the general name of transmethylation reactions, and are catalyzed by specific
  methyltransferases (MTs). S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), the byproduct of att transmethylation
  reactions, is an inhibitor of MTs. SAH is hydrolyzed to form homocysteine (Hcy)
  and adenosine by a reversible enzyme known as SAH hydrolase (AHCY). Hcy may be remethylated
  to regenerate Met, or enter the transsulfuration pathway to be converted first to
  cystathionine, by a condensation reaction with homoserine, and then to cysteine
  (Cys) and α-ketobutyrate. Whereas Cys is transformed into a variety of sulfur containing
  molecules, such as glutathione (GSH), taurine, sulfate (SO,4 and hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S), α-ketobutyrate is transformed to succinyl-CoA and metabolized in the mitochondria.
  Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), the enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of cystathionine,
  is activated by SAMe. Methionine is regenerated from Hcy via two routes; the methionine
  synthase (MS) pathway, which uses 5-methyttetrahydrofolate (MTHF) as methyl donor,
  and the BHMT route, that uses betaine (trimethylglycine) as methyl donor. The synthesis
  of MTHF is catalyzed by the enzyme MTHF reductase (MTHFR), which is inhibited by
  SAMe. In its turn, MTHF inhibits GNMT, the enzyme that converts Gly to sarcosine
  (methylglycine, Me-Gly). GNMT is activated by SAMe. The regeneration of Gly from
  sarcosine is catalyzed by the enzyme sarcosine dehydrogenase (SDH).Another major
  role of SAMe is to donate its propylamino group for polyamine synthesis. Here, SAMe
  is first decarboxylated by the enzyme SAMe decarboxylase (SAMDC) to form decarboxylated
  SAMe (dcSAMe). Then, this compound donates its propylamine group to putrescine to
  form spermidine (SPD), and to SPD to form spermine (SPM). This pathway is regulated
  by putrescine, which activates SAMDC. Methytthioadenosine (MTA), a byproduct of
  SPD and SPM synthesis, is used to regenerate methionine (not shown). Ser, serine;

  description: Hepatic S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) metabolism. Methionine (Met) is
    an essential sulfur-containing amino acid that is converted to SAMe by the enzyme
    methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) using ATP as co-substrate. Two main MAT isoforms,

    SAMe’s methyl group is transferred to a large variety of substrates, such as DNA,

    the byproduct of att transmethylation reactions, is an inhibitor of MTs. SAH is
