caption: 'IGFBP-3 was a predicted target of SAN by bioinformatics analysis. (A) Of
  290 potential target genes of SAN, 63 were highly correlated with clinical disease,
  while 2 genes were related to HCC: TP53 and IGFBP-3. (B) KEGG clustering with an
  adjusted P value cutoff=0.05 showed that SAN may regulate apoptosis through the
  TP53/IGFBP-3 signaling pathway.'
