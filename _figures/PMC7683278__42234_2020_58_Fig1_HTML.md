caption: The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and its impairment in the
  case of SARS-2-CoV infection. Cellular virus invasion leads despite local liberation
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL 1β, IL 6, IL 8, TNF α) to afferent vagal
  signaling. In central vagal structures (solitary nucleus (NTS), dorsal motor nucleus
  of the vagus (DMV)) this signal is after receiving (NTS) and interactional communication
  to different central instances via a M1 agonist responsive cholinergic brain network
  transformed into an appropriate efferent vagal impulse (DMV), which is liberating
  acetylcholine (ACh) at the spot of injury. Thus, cytokine distribution is controlled
  by somatotopically vagal secreted acetylcholine (ACh) coupling to α7-nicotinergic-acetylcholine
  receptors (α7AChR´s), this way blocking the cytokine transcriptional factor nuclear
  factor kappa B (nf-κB). This mechanism is dependent on appropriate parasympathetic
  (vagal) representation within the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Depressed vagal
  tone leads to functional impairment of CAP with subsequent excessive cytokine distribution
  (cytokine storm) followed by tissue injury, pulmonal dysfunction, ARDS and immune
  paralysis, whereas in the case of ANS balance, controlled cytokine distribution
  is generating tissue repair and virus elimination
