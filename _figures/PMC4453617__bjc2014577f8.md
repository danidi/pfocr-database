caption: p53 transcription-dependent and -independent activation of apoptotic pathway.
  (A) p53 is activated in response to DNA damage and induces the apoptotic pathway
  through two alternative mechanisms, one dependent on transcriptional activity of
  p53 and one independent from transcriptional activity of p53. Indeed, activated
  p53 can move towards nucleus to activate the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes
  or move towards mitochondria to induce the release of cytochrome c. (B) Under basal
  conditions, MDM2 binds p53, thus leading to the degradation of the protein. SM13
  inhibits MDM2/p53 binding by competing with p53 for binding to MDM2. SM13 therefore
  leads to the inhibition of MDM2-dependent degradation of p53 and to the increase
  of p53 levels. p53 binds and inhibits antiapoptotic proteins (BclXL); thus, inducing
  Bax levels on mitochondrial membrane, which leads to the release of citochrome c
  from mitochondria that on turn activates apoptotic events.
