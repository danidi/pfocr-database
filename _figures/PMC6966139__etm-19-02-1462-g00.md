caption: Effect of AGE on plaque formation. AGE inhibits the TLR signaling pathway
  by activating AMPK and consequently suppresses the production of TNF-α and CRP in
  the liver. The reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines decreases the infiltration
  of immune cells into the artery wall, which in turn suppresses plaque formation.
  AGE, aged garlic extract; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; CRP, C-reactive protein;
  DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; oxLDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein;
  TLRs, Toll-like receptors; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; VSMCs, vascular smooth
  muscle cells.
