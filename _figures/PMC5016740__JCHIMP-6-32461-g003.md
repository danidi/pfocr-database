caption: Coagulation cascade. Factor VIII inhibitor blocking intrinsic pathway (shown
  by black box); mechanism of action of recombinant activated factor VII (shown by
  yellow blocks), which binds with activated platelets to activate factor X and generate
  factor Xa; activated prothrombin complex concentrate contains activated factor VII
  and inactivated factors II, IX, and X (shown by the symbol ★).
