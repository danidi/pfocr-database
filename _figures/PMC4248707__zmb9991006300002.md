caption: mRNA decay pathways in the cytoplasm. There are two major cytoplasmic pathways
  to degrade mRNA that both start with the shortening of the poly(A) tail by one of
  the deadenylase complexes (Ccr4-Not or Pan2/3). The exosome can degrade the deadenylated
  mRNA in the 3′-to-5′ direction, and the scavenger decapping enzyme, Dcs1, degrades
  the remaining cap. The most prominent pathway involves decapping by Dcp1 and Dcp2
  and subsequent degradation by the 5′-to-3′ exonuclease, Xrn1.
