caption: A GM-CSF–IRF4–CCL17 pathway in inflammation and pain. During an inflammatory
  reaction, GM-CSF, generated following TNF-dependent and -independent stimulation,
  induces in monocytes and macrophages the formation of CCL17 through a signaling
  pathway involving the induction of the transcription factor, IRF4, via the activity
  of the demethylase, JMJD3 (). By unknown mechanisms, secreted CCL17 can result in
  inflammation and tissue remodeling, for example, in arthritic joints, as well as
  drive the development of pain; the latter response appears to require a contribution
  from an eicosanoid (for example, PGE2). GM-CSF–IRF4 signaling can in addition control
  expression in monocytes and macrophages of other potential proinflammatory effectors,
  such as surface-bound MHC class II. GM-CSF and TNF, potentially produced by numerous
  cell types (not shown) in response to various stimuli, including damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), can engage in a cytokine loop, thus potentially linking
  TNF biology to the GM-CSF–CCL17 pathway ().
