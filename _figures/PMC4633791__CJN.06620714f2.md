caption: 'Induction of soldiers into functionally distinct cell lines. On contact
  with antigen on APCs, Th0 cells can be activated to different Th subsets cells.
  The pathway of differentiation is driven by the nature of the antigen to which they
  are making an effector response. The most primitive is driven by inflammatory cytokines
  IL-6 and IL-1β to induce the transcription factor RORγt that produces Th17 cells
  producing a unique set of cytokines (top pathway). Th1 cells are initially activated
  by IL-2 to induce T-bet and a Th1 phenotype of cytokine expression (middle pathway).
  Th2 cells are induced by IL-4 to express GATA3 and Th2 cytokines (bottom pathway).
  The maturation of all cell lines is augmented by other cytokines: IL-22 for Th17
  and IL-12 and IFN-γ for Th1. There are other lineages, such as Tfh and Th9 cells
  (not illustrated), that are induced by different cytokines, have a different transcription
  factor, and produce different cytokines.'
