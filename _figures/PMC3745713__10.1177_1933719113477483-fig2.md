caption: Methionine–homocysteine and aromatase pathways and their involvement in 2-ME
  synthesis. A, The THF obtained through diet, produces methionine through the remethylation
  pathway (where MTHFR, MTRR, and MTR are involved) which when added to the diet-supplemented
  methionine, generates SAM, the main methyl group donor in the methylation reaction.
  The COMT is a SAM-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2-hydroxyestradiol
  into 2-ME. B, Androstenedione and testosterone are converted into estrone and 17β-estradiol,
  respectively, through the action of aromatase. 17β-Estradiol is converted by CyP450
  into 2-hydroxyestradiol, the substrate used by COMT for the synthesis of 2-ME. Low
  levels of 2-ME observed in patients with PE could be explained, among others, by
  (1) the decreased expression/activity of the COMT enzyme; (2) a decrease in the
  bioavailability of SAM, likely due to alterations in the methionine–homocysteine
  pathway that reduce the availability of methionine and SAM, or increase levels of
  homocysteine and SAH; (3) a decrease in the bioavailability of 17β-estradiol likely
  due to an alteration in the aromatase pathway. THF indicates tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR,
  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; MTR, methionine synthase; MTRR, methionine
  synthase reductase; Vit B12, vitamin B12; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosythomocysteine;
  2-ME, 2-methoxyestradiol; PE, preeclampsia; CyP450, cytochromeP450.
