caption: MiRNA and host targets are involved in common pathways. (A) DNMT3A-hsa-miR-1301-3p
  cancer promoting coherent regulatory circuit. DNMT3A activates the transcription
  of MDM2 proto-oncogene, which represses p53 and thus prevents apoptosis. hsa-miR-1301-3p
  synergistically supports DNMT3A by repressing CREBBP, a cofactor of p53. A number
  of other pathways were also found to be statistically significantly enriched in
  targets of the host DNMT3A and targets of its hosted miRNA, hsa-miR-1301-3p ().
  (B) In the FOXO signaling pathway, DNMT3A activates MDM2, which leads to the ubiquitination
  and eventual proteolysis of the FOXO protein (). hsa-miR-1301-3p collaborates with
  its host function by repressing CREBBP, a cofactor of FOXO ().
