caption: Bax/Bak proteins are activated by the action of BH3 only proteins Bid/Bim.
  Activated Bax/Bak oligomerize to form pores on mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM)
  as a result of which apoptotic factors such as cyto-c are released, a process known
  as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), and lead the cell towards
  death. Anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl2, BclXL and Mcl1 bind with both BH3 only
  proteins as well as pro-apoptotic Bax/Bak to inhibit their function.
