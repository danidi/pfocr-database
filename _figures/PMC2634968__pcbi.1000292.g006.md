caption: There were three critical network reactions that controlled the IL-1 induced
  activation of NF-kappa-B. Uninhibited IL-1 signaling induced formation of a TRAF6/Ajuba/PKCz/SQST1
  complex followed by autophosphorylation at the Thr-560 residue of PKCz. This activated
  complex then signaled downstream to NF-kappa-B via IKK phosphorylation. The three
  critical network reactions inhibited IL-1 induced NF-kappa-B activation by preventing
  the formation and subsequent autophosphorylation of the TRAF6/Ajuba/PKCz/SQST1 complex.
  Unlike inhibitors such as IL-1R2 and soluble IL-1R, which mediate IL-1 signaling
  by preventing the activation of the IL-1 receptors, the three critical network reactions
  worked by disrupting other components of the IL-1 DIOS pathway and did not affect
  the activation of IL-1 receptors.
