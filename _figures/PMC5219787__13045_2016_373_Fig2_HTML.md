caption: 'Notch signaling pathway. Ligand from the presenting cell binds to the notch
  receptor on the receiving cell. Notch extracellular truncated (NEXT) domain is cleaved
  by ADAM metalloprotease and γ-secretase yielding the notch intracellular domain
  (NICD). NICD is translocated to the nucleus where it complexes with transcription
  factor CSL 9 CBF1/suppressor of hairless/Lag 1 and transcriptional coactivator of
  the mastermind-like proteins (MAML). The complex can then activate target gene transcription.
  Diallyl trisulfide (DATS) treatment increases expression of tumor suppressor microRNAs:
  miR-143 and miR-145. MicroRNAs bind to Notch1 mRNA and results in mRNA degradation
  with no translation of Notch1 protein. Curcumin downregulates transcription and
  translation Notch1 and downstream genes Hes-1, Hey-1, and Hey-2 of the nucleus'
