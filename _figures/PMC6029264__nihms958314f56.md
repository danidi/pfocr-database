caption: aPathway A, which predominates when nitrite is in excess over H2S, represents
  a classical oxygen atom transfer; nitrite coordination to ferric heme leads to HSOH
  and [Fe2+(NO)] ↔ [Fe3+(NO−)], which releases HNO slowly. Pathway B predominates
  when H2S is in excess over nitrite; reduction of ferric heme by H2S is followed
  by nitrite reduction to [Fe3+(NO)] ↔ [Fe2+(NO+)] species, which is scavenged by
  HS− giving HSNO. Either free or coordinated HSNO causes transnitrosation of protein
  thiols or, in the reaction with H2S, generates HNO.
