caption: 'The S. clavuligerus clavulanic acid and 5S clavam biosynthetic pathways.
  The pathway is depicted in three parts: the central green box represents the steps
  shared between CA and 5S clavam biosynthesis, whereas the pink (left) and yellow
  (right) boxes indicate the late steps specific for CA or 5S clavam production, respectively.
  The solid arrows represent known reactions and broken arrows indicate uncharacterized
  steps, which could potentially involve more than one unknown gene product/enzyme.
  The names of core biosynthetic enzymes (blue) catalyzing known reactions and the
  respective gene(s) encoding them (red) are included where applicable. The stereochemistries
  (R/S) of the intermediates/products are also included along with their names. The
  identities of the gene clusters involved in each stage of biosynthesis is indicated
  at the bottom of the figure. Note that the shared part of the pathway (green) involves
  substitutable isozymes (CeaS, Bls, Cas, and Pah), which are encoded by two sets
  of genes (1 and 2) residing in three separate gene clusters. Additional genes from
  the respective clusters for which exact biosynthetic functions have not been assigned
  are not shown to simply interpretation.'
