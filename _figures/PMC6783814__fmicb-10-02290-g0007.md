caption: 'Reconstruction of the selected metabolic and structural features of “Ca.
  Magnetaquicoccus inordinatus” based on genome analysis and TEM micrographs. The
  following metabolic pathways are emphasized: (1) glycolysis and glyconeogenesis;
  (2) tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA); (3) autotrophic CO2 fixation through reverse
  TCA (rTCA); (4) sulfide oxidation trough reverse Dsr (dissimilatory sulfite reductase)
  pathway. Sulfite which is formed via Dsr operation is further oxidized to sulfate
  through the intermediate 5''-adenylyl sulfate (APS) by APS reductase (AprAB) and
  sulfate adenylyltransferase (Sat). (5) Dissimilatory nitrate reduction is possible
  through the periplasmic nitrate reductase (NapAB) and putative membrane-bound nitrate
  reductase complex (NarGHI). Nitrite reduction is further possible by nitrite reductase
  NirS. Since norBC genes were not found (crossed out), might be not capable of nitric
  oxide reduction, whereas nitrous oxide can be reduced to nitrogen by nitrous oxide
  reductase (NosZ). (6) Assimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction in the cytoplasm
  through nitrate reductase (NasA) and nitrite reductase NirBD, respectively. (7)
  Chemotaxis complex is represented by methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP)
  and Che proteins. (8) The species presumably synthesizes multiple flagella due to
  the presence of high number of flagellin genes. Since two bunches of flagella are
  common among magnetotactic cocci, similar organization is assumed in “Ca. Magnetaquicoccus
  inordinatus”.'
