caption: Overall summary. Data from this study show that targeting organic anion transporting
  polypeptide (Oatp) transporters during pathophysiologic stress may modify central
  nervous system (CNS) drug delivery. We propose that organic anion transporting polypeptide
  1a4 (Oatp1a4) facilitates brain delivery of drugs that may exhibit efficacy in treatment
  of peripheral inflammatory pain or cerebral hypoxia such as statins and opioid peptide
  analgesics. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway regulates
  Oatp1a4 functional expression via signaling mediated by TGF-β receptors (i.e., activin
  receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5)). Targeting TGF-β receptors with small molecules (i.e.,
  SB431542) may offer an opportunity to ‘control' Oatp1a4 expression/activity for
  optimization of CNS drug delivery.
