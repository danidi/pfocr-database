caption: Involvement of AKR1B1 in pathophysiology. AKR1B1 catalyzes the first step
  in the polyol pathway transforming glucose into sorbitol using NADPH as cofactor.
  Under hyperglycemic conditions increased sorbitol and NADPH consumption lead to
  osmotic and oxidative stress, respectively, that can contribute to diabetic complications.
  AKR1B1 metabolizes drugs leading to inactivation and chemoresistance and/or to the
  generation of toxic metabolites. In addition, AKR1B1 can metabolize PGH2 yielding
  PGF2α, which may regulate PGE2 production. Transformation of reactive aldehydes
  or their GSH-conjugates by AKR1B1 can generate species that perpetuate inflammation
  and may be involved in allergic responses. The interactions of AKR1B1 with drug
  metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation an allergic reactions support its consideration
  in studies of drug hypersensitivity.
