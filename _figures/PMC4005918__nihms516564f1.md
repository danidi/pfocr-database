caption: Synthesis and catabolism of dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine and serotonin
  are formed from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively. Their synthesis
  also requires 2 cofactors. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is formed in a 3-step pathway
  from guanine triphosphate (GTP) and is the cofactor for tyrosine hydroxylase and
  tryptophan hydroxylase. It is also required for the activity of PAH. The second
  cofactor is pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, which is required for aromatic L–amino acid
  decarboxylase activity. Following release of dopamine and serotonin, they are rapidly
  metabolized to form HVA and 5HIAA, respectively, and these metabolites are measured
  in spinal fluid and provide an indication of the overall turnover of these neurotransmitters.
