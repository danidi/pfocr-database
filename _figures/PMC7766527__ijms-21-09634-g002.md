caption: Activation of innate immune receptors by bacterial membrane vesicles and
  their RNA content. When bacterial EVs released by extracellular or intracellular
  bacteria reach the target cells, the sensing of these vesicles and/or its RNA content
  could occur at different intracellular locations. The pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMP) on the outside of these vesicles can induce the host innate immune
  response by activating the toll-like receptor and MAP-kinase (TLR/MAPK) signaling
  pathway, leading to the activation of transcription factors that induce the production
  of inflammatory mediators. The RNA cargo of EVs internalized by endocytosis can
  also be released and sensed by endosomal receptors. These receptors signal through
  the adaptor molecules MyD88 or TRIF, resulting in the activation and nuclear translocation
  of transcription factors that will induce production of inflammatory mediators and
  type I interferons. RNAs delivered into the cytoplasm after fusion of EVs with the
  host cell plasma membrane might be sensed by cytoplasmic RNA sensors such as RIG-I
  and MDA-5. Engagement of these receptors triggers signaling through the adaptor
  protein MAVS, which signals to induce the production of inflammatory mediators and
  type I interferon. On the other hand, some bacterial sRNAs delivered into receptor
  cells can target mRNAs from components of the mentioned signaling pathways, leading
  to the reduction of the inflammatory mediators, showing how complex the infection
  process can be.
