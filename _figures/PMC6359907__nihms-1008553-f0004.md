  compounds (ie, sirolimus or trehalose) or through genetic manipulations (ie, overexpression
  of TFEB or Beclin-1) has successfully reinstated autophagy function, in cell cultures
  and in animal models of disease.,,– Interventions targeting the other steps in macroautophagy
  to either enhance their activity or prevent the inhibitory effect of pathogenic
  proteins have not been attempted yet. (B) Chaperone-mediated autophagy: chemical
  activation of the transcriptional programme of chaperone-mediated autophagy through
  inhibition of the retinoic acid receptor-α signaling has been proven effective in
  reducing α-synuclein toxicity in vitro. Drugs such as inhibitors of Akt, inhibitors
  of mTORC2, or activators of PHLPP1 (proteins that modulate LAMP-2A dynamics of assembly
  and disassembly at the lysosomal membrane) are also available, but are not selective
  to this autophagic pathway and their effect on proteotoxicity has not been tested
  in contexts with defective chaperone-mediated autophagy. Genetic upregulation of
  LAMP-2A expression to enhance chaperone-mediated autophagy has proven effective
  in preventing α-synuclein-mediated toxicity. Interventions at the level of substrate
  targeting that could prevent delivery of pathogenic proteins to lysosomes to avoid
  their toxic effect on chaperone-mediated autophagy have also not been attempted.
  (C) Lysosome: restoration of lysosomal acidification with acidic nanoparticles has
  been successful in restoring autophagy function in animal models., Interventions
  to modulate protease or lipid content have not been attempted yet. (D) Endosomal
  microautophagy: although no interventions to modulate this form of degradation have
  been attempted, the existence of this degradation pathway at the neuronal synapsis
  provides a good opportunity to enhance delivery of pathogenic proteins to alleviate
  their toxicity. m=mutant. TFEB=transcription factor EB. LC3=microtubule-associated
