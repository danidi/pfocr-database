caption: Proposed mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  transmission, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated thrombosis. SARS-CoV-2
  gains entry to host lung epithelial cells by the binding of the transmembrane spike
  (S) glycoprotein to ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2). The S1 subunit of the
  S protein binds to ACE-2 and mediates viral attachment. Proteolytic cleavage of
  the S protein at the S1/2 junction by the proteases, furin, and TMPRSS-2 (transmembrane
  protease serine 2), facilitates viral entry. SARS-CoV-2 can also directly invade
  endothelial expressed ACE-2. Infected cells undergo pyroptosis leading to the release
  of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and triggering the release of proinflammatory
  cytokines and chemokines. The activated endothelium upregulates the expression of
  VWF (von Willebrand factor) and adhesion molecules including ICAM (intercellular
  adhesion molecule)-1, αvβ3, P-selectin and E-selectin leading to recruitment of
  platelets and leukocytes and complement activation. Neutrophils release neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NETS), causing direct activation of the contact pathway. Complement
  activation potentiates these mechanisms by increasing endothelial and monocyte tissue
  factor (TF), further platelet activation and amplifies endothelial inflammation,
  which increases production of proinflammatory cytokines from the endothelium including
  IL (interleukin)-1, IL-8, RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed
  and secreted), IL-6, and MCP (monocyte chemoattractant protein)-1. The hypoxic environment
  can induce HIFs (hypoxia-inducible factors) which upregulates endothelial TF expression.
  These mechanisms ultimately lead to the unchecked generation of thrombin, resulting
  in thrombus formation. The fibrin degradation product, D-dimer, which is a marker
  of coagulation activation, appears to be a strong prognostic marker associated with
  high mortality in patients with COVID-19.
