caption: The scheme shows the workflow of the different steps followed to identify
  potential transcriptional regulators for a given gene under LPS exposure. The upstream
  network was initially constructed using the PWMs from TRANSFAC® and the prediction
  algorithm MATCH™. The literature network downstream of LPS was inferred using the
  Pathway Studio knowledge database. These networks were merged and the merged network
  was contextualised using the booleanised genome-wide expression data. Finally, the
  ranking scheme with simple paths and essentiality metric resulted in a set of potential
  transcriptional regulators which were tested using siRNA mediated gene silencing
  experiments.
