caption: Pathways for the biosynthesis and recycling of sphingolipids. De novo synthesis
  of dihydroceramide and ceramide take place in pathway 1, which is inhibited by β-chloroalanine.
  In pathway 2, sphingosine and sphinganine produced by hydrolysis of sphingolipids
  are reutilized for synthesis of sphingolipids. Fumonisin B1 inhibits pathways 1
  and 2. In pathway 3, native or partially hydrolyzed glycosphingolipids recycle through
  the Golgi apparatus.
