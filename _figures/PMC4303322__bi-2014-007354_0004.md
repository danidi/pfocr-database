caption: Model for the mammalian DNA damage checkpoint pathways and/or systems. Two
  main DNA damage checkpoint pathways and/or systems have been defined on the basis
  of the PIKK family member damage sensor (ATR or ATM) that initiates the signal transduction
  cascade. DNA damage by ionizing radiation (IR) and other agents that induce double-strand
  breaks activates the ATM pathway, while DNA damage by UV and UV-mimetic agents that
  produce bulky base adducts activates the ATR pathway, although there is overlap
  and crosstalk between the two pathways.
