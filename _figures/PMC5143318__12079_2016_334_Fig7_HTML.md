caption: In silico analysis of Noggin interactions with other proteins. Noggin has
  been known to inhibit BMP signaling through binding to several BMPs. The protein-protein
  interactions of Noggin were searched in STRING database (http://string-db.org/).
  The results obtained from STRING predicted the interaction of Noggin with proteins
  BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-5, BMP-6 and BMP-7
