caption: Integration of the Role of the ASK1-Signalosome in ROS-Mediated Regulation
  of the p38 MAPK Pathway and Physiological Characteristics of Aging. [] ROS generated
  by mitochondrial dysfunction; [] the ASK1-signalosome responds to changes in levels
  of oxidative stress (ROS); [] (SH)2Trx complexes with ASK1 to form (SH)2Trx-ASK1
  complex, a component of the inASK1-signalosome; [] the (SH)2Trx-ASK1 complex (inASK1-siganlosome)
  inhibits p38 MAPK activity; (5 → 7) inhibition of p38 MAPK activity attenuates stress
  response gene expression and favors expression of longevity assurance genes. This
  is the predominating pathway of the long-lived Klotho overexpressing, Snell and
  Ames mice that favors resistance to oxidative stress. [] Klotho ablation causes
  increased endogenous ROS, dissociation of the (SH)2Trx-ASK1 complex to form the
  actASK1-signalosome. [] ASK1 activates the p38 MAPK pathway and [] p38 targeted
  genes that promote aging. (8 → 12) This is the predominant pathway of Klotho (-/-)
  that promotes accelerated aging and sensitivity to oxidative stress; [] The activation
  and nuclear localization of Nrf2 in the Klotho overexpressing mice and decreased
  Nrf2 activity in Klotho(-/-).
