caption: Model of cold stress and ethylene signaling pathway in soybean seedlings.
  Dashed lines indicated predicted interactions based on Arabidopsis models, solid
  lines indicate parameters measured in this study. Changes indicated by cold are
  solid blue arrows, additional changes in the cold due to ethylene pathway stimulation
  are open green arrows, and ethylene pathway inhibition in solid orange arrows.
