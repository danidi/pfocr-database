caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for legiobactin. The biosynthetic pathway is
  divided into three steps—the production of citrate (A), the production of putrescine
  (B), and the conjoining of citrate and putrescine to form legiobactin (C). For each
  enzymatic reaction, the enzyme and gene (open reading frame [ORF]) involved are
  indicated to the left and right of the vertical arrows, respectively.
