caption: 'The connection between glutamine and tricarboxylic acid cycle: glutamine
  is metabolized to glutamate and next to α-ketoglutarate. Quick energy pathway from
  glutamine is open if glutamate dehydrogenase is activated by the low ATP and high
  ADP levels (as in majority of cancers). In the opposite, ATP and NAD(P)H2 are necessary
  for the synthesis of glutamine which takes place especially in muscles. Reactions
  20, 21, and 22 are the source of ammonia and ammonia induced autophagy. (Indices
  at enzyme abbreviations point to reaction numbers in Figures    and  .)'
