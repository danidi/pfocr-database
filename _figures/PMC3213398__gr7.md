caption: A Working Model for the Late-Acting Function of NFU1 in Mitochondrial Fe-S
  Protein BiogenesisThe findings of this work suggest a late-acting function of NFU1
  in the pathway of Fe-S (red and yellow circles) protein maturation. NFU1 is preferentially
  needed for Fe-S cluster assembly of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and lipoic acid
  synthase (LAS), but not of other proteins such as aconitase. An NFU1 functional
  defect due to a point mutation in the fatal mitochondrial disease described in this
  work results in defective SDH and LAS and hence in decreased synthesis of lipoic
  acid (LA) and a lack of lipoylation of the E2 subunits of PDH, α-KGDH, and BCDH
  and the H protein of GCS. In contrast to depletion of NFU1, depletion of the major
  Fe-S scaffold ISCU affects maturation of virtually all cellular Fe-S proteins, including
  cytosolic ones, which additionally need the CIA machinery for maturation. ISCU,
  together with the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1-Isd11 and frataxin, which is depleted
  in Friedreich ataxia, is also required for de novo synthesis of a transiently bound
  Fe-S cluster on NFU1. Chaperones and GRX5 may be involved in Fe-S cluster release
  from ISCU and transfer to both NFU1 and target apoproteins. Finally, NFU1 is needed
  for maturation of specific targets such as LAS and SDH. In this late step, NFU1
  may cooperate with IBA57-ISCA1, yet these latter proteins appear to address most
  or all mitochondrial target proteins with a [4Fe-4S] cluster.
