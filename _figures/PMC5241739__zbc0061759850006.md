caption: Negative regulation of TLR4 signaling by BCAP and PLCγ2. A, MD2/LPS binding
  to the TLR4 ectodomain enables the recruitment of a cytosolic signalosome comprising
  the PIP2-linked adaptor MAL/TIRAP and the Myddosome (MyD88 and interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase (IRAK) kinases), which interact with the receptor TIR domains. The flux,
  F, through this pathway stimulates the production of NFκB. B, PLCγ2-linked BCAP
  cleaves PIP2 to DAG and IP3, which deprives MAL/TIRAP of its membrane anchor. Additionally,
  PI3K further depletes PIP2 by converting it to PIP3. MAL/TIRAP is still capable
  of interacting with PIP3, but it is inactive presumably because it can no longer
  recruit the Myddosome. The net result is a reduction in flux, (F − m), and thus
  negative regulation, of the MD2/LPS-induced stimulation of TLR4. IP3 produced by
  PLCγ2 cleavage of PIP2 stimulates calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER), which in turn drives the internalization of TLR4 into endosomal compartments,
  leading to the production of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs).
