caption: 'A model of leptospire-induced apoptosis in macrophages through bid-induced
  release of AIF/ Endog signaling pathway. Upon contact with leptospires and during
  phagocytosis, macrophages generate ROS. ROS triggers the dephosphorylation of Akt.
  The decrease of p-Akt activated Bid to be cleaved into tBid, which reduced the mitochondrial
  membrane permeabilization, leading to release of AIF and EndoG. AIF and EdnoG translocated
  into the nuclear and caused the DNA fragmentation and apoptosis. In parallel, infection
  induced the activation of caspase-8 through Fas/FasL-FADD pathway. Caspase-8 also
  cleaved the Bid into tBid, which caused the release and nuclear translocation of
  AIF and EndoG, and induced the apoptosis. The green solid line: stimulatory or inhibitory
  modification; the green dotted line: translocation.'
