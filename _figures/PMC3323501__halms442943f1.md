caption: Through regulation of the expression of Kir6.2, E2F1 facilitates insulin
  secretion. Insulin will signal to peripheral insulin sensitive tissues, such as
  liver, muscle, or white adipose tissue (WAT). The effects of insulin are described
  under the cartoon of the tissues. On the other hand, the cdk4/pRB/E2F1 pathway has
  direct effects on the described metabolic processes in the same tissues.
