caption: Flow diagram illustrating the molecular methodology and frequency results
  of CRC cases diagnosed between 2011–2012. MSI CRC was found in 12% of CRC cases,
  with predominant MLH1 loss, however only 23% of deficient MLH1 cases harboured BRAFV600E
  mutations. These findings suggest a large proportion of SA MSI CRC patients could
  develop through a hereditary pathway.
