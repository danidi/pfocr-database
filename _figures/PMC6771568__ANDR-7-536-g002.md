caption: IGF signalling pathway alterations occurring in cisplatin‐resistant TGCT.
  Several alterations in the IGF signalling pathway have been documented in cisplatin‐resistant
  TGCT. PIK3CA and AKT1 activating mutations have been found exclusively in resistant
  tumours. PTEN loss is a frequent event occurring early in TGCT evolution. Cisplatin‐resistant
  cells demonstrate overexpression of AKT and phospho‐AKT levels in comparison with
  their sensitive counterparts, which results in increased translocation of p21 to
  the cytoplasm where it can inhibit apoptosis. IGF1R overexpression was seen in an
  acquired model of resistance. Interestingly, PDGFRβ has also been shown to contribute
  to cisplatin resistance via PI3K/AKT signalling with overexpression of PDGF‐β.
