caption: P53 is the most important regulator in DNA damage. P53 is a substrate for
  both the ATM and ATR kinases, as well as for CHK1 and CHK2. Phosphorylation of p53
  allows its interaction with transcriptional cofactors, transcribes and activates
  its target genes for extensive cell responses, such as cell cycle arrest, DNA repair,
  apoptosis and senescence. When DNA damage is difficult to be repaired, it will induce
  cell apoptosis, senescence, or mitotic catastrophe. The final death pathway depends
  on the function of checkpoints and the status of p53
