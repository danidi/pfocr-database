caption: Mechanisms of PR activation. Unliganded PR is present as an inactive complex
  associated with heat shock proteins (HSP) and chaperone proteins (p29, p56) in the
  cytoplasm. In the classical ligand dependent pathway of activation (LDA), progesterone
  and other progestins bind to the PR to induce conformational change, dissociation
  of HSPs and chaperone proteins. PRs undergo dimerization and bind to the hormone
  response element (HRE) in the target DNA. Ligand-induced conformational change facilitates
  the recruitment of cofactors and other general transcription factors (GTFs) to the
  promoter, producing a transcriptionally active complex that can direct gene transcription.
  Compounds such as cyclic nucleotides, neurotransmitters (NTs), growth factors (GFs)
  and neurosteroids can activate second messengers and protein kinase pathways to
  activate PR and/or coactivators in a ligand-independent manner.
