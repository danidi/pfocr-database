caption: Current model for replication-independent ICL repair. If an ICL occurs in
  nonreplicating cells, it may be recognized by interfering with transcription or
  because it induces helix distortion, which is recognized by the nucleotide excision
  repair pathway. This could trigger recruitment of downstream NER factors including
  XPF-ERCC1. Incisions around the lesion on one strand of DNA unhook the lesion from
  that strand. Translesion polymerases can bypass the ICL and fill the gap with new
  DNA synthesis. This is sufficient to restore double-strand DNA that is free of interstrand
  cross-links.
