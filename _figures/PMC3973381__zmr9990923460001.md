caption: HDTs within the macrophage. Upon infection of a macrophage by M. tuberculosis,
  several pathways that may serve as targets for host-directed therapeutics are activated.
  1. After binding and uptake of M. tuberculosis (MTB) by macrophages through innate
  immune receptors (e.g., C-type lectin receptors [CLRs] and Toll-like receptors [TLRs]),
  the bacilli are taken into a macrophage and contained in phagosomes. Several signaling
  pathways and molecules, including Rab proteins, IRGM1, and phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K), promote maturation of phagosomes and fusion with lysosomes. 2.
  M. tuberculosis arrests the development of phagolysosomes, preventing their acidification
  and enabling intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis. 3. Autophagy pathways can
  be stimulated by M. tuberculosis or other conditions, which leads to autophagosome
  formation and control of M. tuberculosis growth. 4. Several pathways mediate activation
  of signaling molecules. TLRs activate key elements of the signaling processes, including
  AKT, NF-κB, and components of the vitamin D pathway. The lipid-sensing nuclear receptors,
  LXR, TR4, and PPARγ, bind with RXR to modulate gene expression. HDT targets described
  in the text are marked in boxes with red shading.
