caption: (Left) Position of individual GBPs or the Gbpchr3−/− deletion encoding 5
  clustered family members (GBP1, GBP2, GBP3, GBP5, GBP7) within the canonical NLRP3
  and AIM2 inflammasome pathways after type I and II IFN signaling. The other major
  inflammasome subtypes, NLRP1 and NLRC4-NAIP, are also depicted. (Right) Position
  of individual GBPs plus unassigned members of the Gbpchr3−/− deletion within the
  non-canonical caspase-11-dependent inflammasome pathway in response to IFN signaling.
  GBP2 and GBP3 are arbitrarily placed upstream of GsdmD for pyroptosis because their
  precise positions are currently unknown.
