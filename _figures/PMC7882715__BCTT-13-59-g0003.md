caption: 'Possible mechanism of polymorphism influences related with MAPK and PI3K/AKT
  cell signaling. Drug resistance from some of the genes are resolved around MAPK
  and PI3K/AKT cell signaling. Polymorphisms in some genes mentioned may induce chemoresistance
  by disrupting the normal cell proliferation signaling and increase the aggressiveness
  of the tumor. The MAPK pathway are activated after Ras was phosphorylated and may
  induce cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. Ras may also activate
  PI3K, which further phosphorylating AKT that leads to activation of various signaling
  pathway leading to increase tumor growth rate. Genes that are hypothesized to disrupt
  these signaling are HER2, HER3, VEGFR2, and FGFR4. Polymorphism of HER2 and HER3
  may increase receptor expression and this upregulation may further leads to increased
  MAPK/AKT signaling. In HER3 rs2229046 carrier, Src expression is increased and leads
  to increase MAPK/AKT signaling, and those with rs77123 had heightened concentration
  of GSK-3β, that may inhibit c-myc as tumor growth suppressor and is suggested as
  chemoresistance mechanism. In FGFR4 arg388 carrier, uPAR expression is increased
  and further inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis that leads to tumor cells resisting
  the induction of apoptosis.Notes: Indicates phosphorylation process. Activates/transactivates/upregulates/expresses.
