caption: 'The biochemical process networks of the differentially expressed proteins
  generated by MetaCore™ software using a transcription regulation algorithm. The
  biochemical process regulation networks were ranked by a value and interpreted in
  terms of GO. Gene network illustrates proteins and interactions of the differentially
  expressed proteins. MetaCore™ pathway analysis predicting androgen receptor as the
  major regulator and pathways involved were; (a) chaperone-mediated stress response;
  (b) sperm function; (c) proteosomal pathway; and (d) predicted impaired androgen
  receptor signaling in spermatozoa of infertile patients. GO: gene ontology; F1:
  least mature stage having the lowest density; F2, F3: intermediate stages; F4: includes
  the most dense and morphologically mature motile spermatozoa. Full names of abbreviated
  proteins are presented in Supplementary Information.'
