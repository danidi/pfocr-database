caption: Metabolic pathway of intravenously administered choline and its methyl groups
  using deuterium-labeled methyl-D9-choline. Methyl groups labeled with deuterium
  are represented by the black dots; the unlabeled methyl groups are represented by
  the white dots. The methyl-D9-choline can enter the CDP-choline pathway (*) to produce
  D9-PC. Alternatively, it can be oxidized to D9-betaine, which then donates a single
  methyl group to homocysteine, producing D6-DMG and D3-methionine. D3-methionine
  serves as a precursor for D3-SAMe, which can be used by PEMT (‡) to sequentially
  methylate PE, forming D3-PC as well as smaller amounts of D6-PC. A fraction of D3-choline
  or D6-choline is released by hydrolysis of PEMT-derived D3-PC or D6-PC in the liver
  and recycled back to D3-PC or D6-PC by the CDP-choline pathway. CDP-choline, cytidine
  diphosphocholine; DMG, dimethylglycine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase; S-AdHo, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  SAMe, S-adenosylmethionine.
