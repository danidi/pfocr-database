caption: (A/B) SHP1 and SHP2 have been implicated in regulating proximal signaling
  events downstream of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-containing
  collagen receptor complex GPVI-FcRγ, and the hemi-ITAM-containing podoplanin receptor
  CLEC-2. (C) SHP2 has also been implicated as a negative regulator of the integrin
  αIIbβ3 in mice. It should be noted that the ITAM-containing low affinity immunoglobulin
  receptor FcγRIIA acts as a docking site for Syk downsream of αIIbβ3 in human platelets,
  but not in mouse platelets, which do not express FcγRIIA. (D) The best-characterized
  function of SHP2 in the megakaryocyte lineage is its positive regulatory role of
  the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway, downstream of the thrombopoietin (Tpo) receptor MPL. However,
  the exact mechanism remains ambiguous. Functions illustrated in this figure are
  mainly based on findings from SHP1 and SHP2 conditional knockout mice and need to
  be validated in mouse and human platelets through the use of SHP1- and SHP2-specific
  inhibitors.
