caption: Proposed molecular mechanism of Thsd7a on tip and stalk. Our data suggest
  that Thsd7a could down-regulate notch expression to affect tip and stalk cell communication.
  Moreover, the down-regulation of vegfr2/3 on tip cell results in the loss of guidance
  cues and growth path disorientation and the down-regulation of nrarp leads to decreased
  endothelial cell proliferation and irregular vessel patterning. Taken together,
  this model might explain why Thsd7a knockdown results in the hyper-branching of
  angiogenic sprout
