caption: 'NF-κB activation occurs through two different pathways: canonical and noncanonical.
  In the canonical pathway, the IKK complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ, and the regulatory
  subunit NEMO, phosphorylates IκB, leading to its ubiquitination and proteosomal
  degradation. A NF-κB dimer, which is comprised of p50, p65, or c-Rel, is released
  from IκB and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to a κB-binding site
  for regulation of gene expression. In the noncanonical pathway, IKKα phosphorylates
  p100 resulting in its ubiquitination and partial processing into p52. A heterodimer
  of p52 and RelB translocates into the nucleus and binds to it binding sites. P,
  phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitination.'
