caption: Abbreviated biosynthetic pathway for 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol and the structures
  of the common trichothecene myocotoxins. T-2 toxin is an A-type trichothecene with
  an ester-linked isovaleryl group at C8, whereas DON and nivalenol (NIV) are both
  B-type trichothecenes with a ketone moiety at C8 and are further differentiated
  by their substitution patterns at C4. [Color figure can be viewed in the online
  issue, which is available at www.interscience.wiley.com.]
