caption: 'Pathway mapping of PPARγ-related redox processes. A network consisting of
  the top 500 nodes was constructed with MetaCore pathway analysis. The network was
  filtered for genes in heart and lung tissue and the following gene ontology processes:
  oxidation/reduction, cellular responses to oxidative stress, response to superoxide,
  response to hydrogen peroxide. Dark edges represent the tracing of the resulting
  subnetwork. The identity of central hubs was determined by visual inspection and
  annotation. Signaling nodes designated by * are downregulated by PPARγ, whereas
  those without * are upregulated by PPARγ. Each edge represents one regulatory connection.
  Bcl-2, B cell lymphoma-2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.'
