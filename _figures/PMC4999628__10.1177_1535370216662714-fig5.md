caption: A model for a role for αIISp in the repair of DNA ICLs. After DNA replication
  is stalled at the site of an ICL, FANCD2 and FANCI are monoubiquitinated (FANCD2-Ub
  and FANCI-Ub) by the FA core complex and bind to the damaged DNA. αIISp binds to
  the DNA at the site of the ICL, downstream from FANCD2-Ub. FANCG is recruited and
  binds to αIISp. XPF-ERCC1 is then recruited and ERCC1 binds to FANCG. XPF, which
  is bound to ERCC1, incises the DNA unhooking the cross-linked DNA in conjunction
  with other nucleases, such as SLX4, which are not shown. Translesion DNA synthesis
  occurs by a translesion synthesis DNA polymerase (TLS pol) and the adducted base
  is removed and repair continues by a combination of nucleotide excision repair (NER)
  and homologous recombination (HR). This model does not show other proteins involved
  in this pathway, since it is emphasizing the role of αIISp in the ICL repair process
