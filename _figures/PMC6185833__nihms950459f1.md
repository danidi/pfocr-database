caption: 'The pathway involves multiple (>30) steps, beginning with the condensation
  of acetyl-CoA molecules that serve as initial building blocks, and proceeds to squalene,
  which then forms epoxide and cyclizes into the triterpene sterol skeleton (cycloartenol
  or lanosterol). These precursors are further modified to produce cholesterol, ergosterol,
  or sitosterol, which are the major membrane sterols in humans, fungi/protozoa, and
  plants, respectively. The CYP51 reaction occurs either immediately or soon after
  squalene cyclization. The 14α-methyl group of the substrate (lanosterol, 24,25-dihydrolanosterol,
  eburicol, obtusifoliol, and/or C4-norlanosterol) is converted into the alcohol,
  then into the aldehyde derivative and finally is removed as formic acid with the
  introduction of the Δ14–15 double bond into the sterol core. The CYP51 reaction
  includes three consecutive cytochrome P450 catalytic cycles, consuming three molecules
  of oxygen, 6 electrons and 6 protons. Detailed description of other reactions of
  the pathway can be found in . Inset: Sterol molecules are incorporated into membranes
  with the 3β-OH facing the water interface and the side chain extending into the
  hydrophobic core to interact with fatty acyl chains of phospholipids and proteins.'
