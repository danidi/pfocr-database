caption: Several mendelian autoinflammatory diseases are caused by mutations in genes
  encoding proteins that directly or indirectly regulate interleukin -1β (IL-1β),
  an important mediator of fever and inflammation. The NLRP3 inflammasome is one of
  the macromolecular complexes by which IL-1β is activated in monocytes, and is comprised
  of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1. Several endogenous “danger signals,” such as monosodium
  urate or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals, asbestos, silica, amyloid β,
  and ATP, as well as bacterial toxins, activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through pathways
  that have not been well-defined but may involve reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
  cathepsin B. With inflammasome activation, caspase-1 (IL-1β converting enzyme) cleaves
  pro-IL-1β into its biologically active form. Secreted IL-1β can act in an autocrine
  or paracrine fashion through the IL-1 receptor. The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra)
  is a naturally occurring antagonist of the binding of IL-1β to its receptor. Through
  mechanisms that have not been thoroughly elucidated, PSTPIP1 and pyrin may influence
  inflammasome activity (; ; ). Mevalonate kinase may also modulate inflammasome activity
  through the Rac1/PI3K/PKB pathway (). Muckle-Wells syndrome is caused by activating
  mutations in NLRP3 itself, and manifests a hives-like skin rash. The deficiency
  of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) is caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations
  in IL-1Ra, and presents in infancy with diffuse pustular skin lesions. Image from  Copyright

  arthritis with pyoderma gangrenosum and acne (PAPA) is caused by missense mutations
  in PSTPIP1. A typical lesion of pyoderma gangrenosum is shown. The hyperimmunoglobulinemia
  D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) is caused by inactivating mutations in mevalonate
  kinase. Patients with HIDS have episodes of fever and a diffuse macular papular
  rash.
