caption: Notch signaling in cell-cell communication between endothelial cells (ECs)
  and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In the process of direct cell-cell interaction
  between ECs and VSMCs, EC membrane ligand Jagged-1 is recognized by Notch-2, -3
  in VSMCs; reciprocally, VSMCs Jagged-1 binds with EC Notch-1 receptor and activates
  the Notch downstream pathway in ECs (also see A). In addition, activation of Notch
  signaling induces nitric oxide (NO), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other factors’ production from ECs via autocrine
  and paracrine process; these factors can regulate EC and VSMC proliferation, migration,
  differentiation and play different roles in neointimal hyperplasia (see B).
