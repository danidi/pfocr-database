caption: 'Schematic representation of the ABA-induced [cAMP]i increase and ATP release.
  In the microcirculation, paracrine ABA produced by inflammatory cells enters into
  RBC across Band 3. Intracellular ABA binds and activates the LANCL2 receptor with
  consequent activation of AC and overproduction of cAMP. Downstream of the cAMP increase,
  ATP is released from erythrocytes. Specific inhibitors of the ABA signaling pathway
  are indicated by dashed arrows. DIDS, a Band 3 inhibitor; #10, a synthetic ABA antagonist
  of the LANCL2 receptor; ddA, a adenylate cyclase inhibitor; I-PKA, a PKA-specific
  myristoylated peptide inhibitor.'
