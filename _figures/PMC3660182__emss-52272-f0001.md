caption: A schematic representation of glia-mediated detrimental and beneficial inflammatory
  pathways in PD. Injury to nigrostriatal DAergic neurons, as a result of specific
  chemical insults (e.g. MPTP), and/or a combination of genetic and environmental
  factors, leads to astrocyte and microglia activation. MPTP is metabolized by astrocytes
  to MPP+, which is concentrated in DAergic neurons. Microglia-derived cytotoxic mediators
  further exacerbate inflammation and oxidative stress. Astrocytes and microglia can
  protect neurons by scavenging radicals and glutamate, by harboring receptors for
  endogenous anti-inflammatory molecules, by providing energy support, trophic factors,
  and ‘protective’ cytokines, and by stimulating repair/neurogenesis by expressing
  neurogenic factors, including Wnt1. Under conditions of chronic inflammatory stress,
  activated astrocytes and microglia may become dysfunctional and over-express a variety
  of cytoyoxic mediators, eventually resulting in DAergic neuron demise via a synergistic
  action of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), with
  generation of the potent cytotoxic peroxynitrite (ONOO−). GF, Growth factor; MPO,
  myeloperoxidase-producing reactive species; NOX, nitric oxide-producing reactive
  species. Modified from .
