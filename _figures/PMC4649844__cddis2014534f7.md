caption: 'Central role of XIAP in TRAIL-resistant PIK3CA-mut CRC cells. In HCT116
  PIK3CA-mut cells, XIAP critically controls TRAIL resistance by proteasomal degradation
  of the active p17 fragment of caspase-3. Consequently, proteasome inhibition allows
  complete caspase-3 activation upon TRAIL stimulation. The effect is twofold: first,
  robust caspase-3 activation allows execution of apoptotic cell death. Second, active
  caspase-3 reduces cellular XIAP levels through proteolytic cleavage in a positive
  feedback loop, thereby amplifying TRAIL-induced cell death. Notably, the decisive
  role of XIAP in this context is independent from the mitochondrial cell death pathway.
