caption: a | TWEAK is initially synthesized as a type II transmembrane protein (denoted
  here as membrane (m) TWEAK) but this protein can undergo intracellular proteolysis
  to generate a smaller, biologically active form that is released into the extracellular
  mileau (denoted here as soluble (s) TWEAK). As mTWEAK proteolytic processing does
  not occur with 100% efficiency, TWEAK can be detected on the surface of most cell
  types by fluorescence-activated cell-sorter analysis. It is established that sTWEAK
  can bind the Fn14 receptor and induce cellular responses, but it has not yet been
  reported that mTWEAK can act in a cell contact-dependent, juxtacrine manner to activate
  Fn14-positive cells. TWEAK is a trimeric cytokine, and it is likely that TWEAK binding
  promotes Fn14 trimerization, TNFR-associated factor (TRAF) association, signal pathway
  activation, changes in gene expression and thus, cellular responses. b | Ectopic
  Fn14 overexpression studies conducted in vitro have indicated that when cellular
  Fn14 levels are elevated to a certain threshold value, TWEAK-independent Fn14 signalling
  can occur. It is likely that Fn14 overexpression on the cell surface induces monomer
  trimerization and trimer multimerization, which then triggers TRAF association and
  the subsequent molecular and cellular events. It is not presently known if TWEAK-independent
  Fn14 signalling occurs in cells that naturally express high levels of Fn14 in vivo
  (for example, certain tumour cells).
