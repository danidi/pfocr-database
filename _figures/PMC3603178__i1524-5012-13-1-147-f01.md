caption: NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. Agonists such as acetylcholine, bradykinin, and serotonin
  encourage the production of nitric oxide (NO) though activation of nitric oxide
  synthase (NOS). Organic nitrate therapy and inhaled NO can stimulate soluble guanylyl
  cyclase (sGC) when the heme moiety on sGC is in a reduced (ferrous) state. Novel
  non-NO-dependent sGC stimulators can increase the activity of sGC. Activated sGC
  stimulates production of cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) that through
  downstream mechanisms elicit relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, inhibition of
  platelet aggregation, modulation of inflammation, and control of vascular permeability.
  Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) break down cGMP. Oxidation of the heme moiety in sGC from
  stress, aging, injury, and the development of tolerance from organic nitrates reduces
  sGC activation. PDEs break down cGMP, whereas PDE5 inhibitors prevent the breakdown
  of cGMP. (Adapted with permission from Boerrigter G, Burnett JC Jr. Nitric oxide-independent
