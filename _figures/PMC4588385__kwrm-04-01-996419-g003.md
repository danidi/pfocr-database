caption: EGL-18 mediates seam cell fate specification in the embryo and larva downstream
  of different inputs. (A) During embryogenesis, cells in the AB lineage that are
  fated to become seam cells are first specified to adopt an epidermal fate (‘epi’)
  via action of the GATA factor ELT-1. Later, expression of CEH-16 in these cells
  leads to expression of the GATA factor EGL-18 (these cells also express the related
  GATA factor ELT-6, not shown), leading them to adopt the lateral hypodermal or seam
  cell fate (‘SC’). These cells do not divide until larval life begins. (B) In larval
  life, some seam cells divide asymmetrically to generate a posterior daughter that
  retains the seam cell fate and the ability to divide further. Maintenance of this
  progenitor cell fate requires activation of the Wnt signaling pathway to maintain
  expression of egl-18 in only that daughter cell of the division. Thus an embryonic
  fate specification factor is reutilized to maintain a progenitor cell population
  in larval life, and egl-18 specifies the seam cell fate both embryonically and post-embryonically,
  but in response to different input signals.
