caption: '(A) The de novo transcriptome assembly of G. bimaculatus newly identifies
  most members of the hedgehog pathway (red), from which only the hedgehog ligand
  (blue) was previously known (GenBank accession AB044709). (B) The transcriptome
  also adds significant sequence data to the fragments of many genes in the Hippo
  signaling pathway that had been previously identified (green). Seven genes of the
  known pathway were not identified in the transcriptome (yellow, white), two of which
  lack any sequence data in GenBank (white). GenBank accessions for previously identified
  sequences are as follows: discs overgrown (dco): AB443442; expanded (ex): AB378099;
  warts (wts): AB300574; cyclin E (cycE): AB378067; hippo (hpo): AB378070; inhibitor
  of apoptosis protein (diap1): AB378071; mob as tumor suppressor (mats): AB378072;
  yorkie (yki): AB378076; scaffold protein salvador (sav): AB378074; Merlin (Mer):
  AB378073; Kibra: DC445461.'
