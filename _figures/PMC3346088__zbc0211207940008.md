caption: Schematic model for ER stress-induced autophagy in hepatocellular liver carcinoma
  cells following AS-6 treatment. AS-6 leads to up-regulation of CHOP and induced
  expression of the ER stress-related proteins, GRP78, PDI, p97, and Lon protease.
  ER stress decreases the amount of Grp78 available to inhibit the sensor proteins,
  PERK and IRE1, thus activating PI3K to phosphorylate beclin 1 and initiating an
  autophagic response. ER stress accompanied by an unfolded protein response also
  activates autophagosome formation via a pathway dependent on eIF2a and the c-Jun
  kinase. Both 3-MA and wortmannin inhibit PI3K and block beclin 1 activation () but
  only 3-MA blocks up-regulation of CHOP during AS-6-mediated ER stress, further evidence
  that the ER stress is accompanied by an unfolded protein response. Because 3-MA
  also prevented up-regulation of Grp78, it must inhibit the stress response at a
  stage upstream of the sensor kinases. Our results suggest that AS-6, a putative
  agonist of PPARγ, dysregulates protein homeostasis generating ER stress and triggering
  autophagy.
