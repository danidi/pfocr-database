caption: This model illustrates how transcription factor EB (TFEB) is induced by starvation
  and mediates the starvation response by regulating lipid catabolism. In the presence
  of adequate nutrition TFEB interacts with the lysosome nutrient sensing (LYNUS)
  machinery, which senses lysosomal nutrient levels via the vATPase complex, and is
  phosphorylated by mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface (1). This keeps TFEB inactive
  by cytosolic sequestration. During starvation mTORC1 is released from the LYNUS
  machinery and becomes inactive. Thus, TFEB can no longer be phosphorylated by mTORC1
  and it translocates to the nucleus where it induces its own transcription (2). Therefore,
  starvation regulates TFEB activity through a dual mechanism that involves a post-translational
  modification (that is, phosphorylation) and a transcriptional autoregulatory loop.
  Once in the nucleus, TFEB regulates the expression of genes involved in the lysosomal–autophagy
  pathway (3). and of PGC1α–PPARα target genes (4). In this way TFEB controls the
  starvation response by activating both macrolipophagy (5) and fatty-acid oxidation
  (6).The insert shows the main components of the LYNUS machinery. The mTORC1 complex,
  which includes regulatory proteins associated with mTOR, such as RAPTOR, LST8, and
  DEPTOR, physically interacts with the RAG GTPases on the lysosomal surface and it
  is activated by them. A complex known as the Ragulator mediates the activation and
  docking of RAGS to the lysosomal membrane,  and the small GTPase RHEB is also involved
  in the growth factor-mediated activation of mTORC1, . The vATPase complex is involved
  in amino acid sensing and it mediates amino acid-sensitive interactions between
  Rags and Ragulator, which is the initial step in lysosomal signaling. The ATP-sensitive
  Na+ channel lysoNaATP, which is comprised of the subunits TPC1 and TPC2, is located
  on the lysosomal membrane and it has recently been shown to interact with mTORC1
  and participates in nutrient sensing The nature of interaction between lysoNaATP
  and mTORC1 is unknown but seems to be independent form other components of the LYNUS
  machinery and the transcription factor EB (TFEB) and its interacting proteins (see
  text).
