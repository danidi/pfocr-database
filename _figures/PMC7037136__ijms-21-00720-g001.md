caption: A simplified representation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. SMO is the
  key signal transducer of the Hh pathway. (A) In the absence of Hedgehog (Shh, Dhh,
  Ihh) ligands, PTCH1 inhibits SMO signaling. Gli molecules are processed with the
  help of SuFu molecules into repressor forms, which disable the Hh signaling pathway.
  The binding of Hh promotes SMO conformational change, leading to activation of the
  GLI transcription factors (the activators Gli1 and -2 and the repressor Gli3). Activated
  GLI accumulates in the nucleus and controls the transcription of hedgehog target
  genes. (B) Mutated PTCH1 does not inhibit SMO and the pathway results activated,
  as in the presence of ligands.
