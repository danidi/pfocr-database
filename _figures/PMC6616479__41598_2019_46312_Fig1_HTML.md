caption: 'The structures of fairy chemicals and their derivatives, and the novel purine
  metabolic pathway in rice. The routes indicated by black arrows were adapted from
  the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and those indicated by dash arrows
  were not clear in the plant. The blue straight arrows and structures show the pathway
  and metabolites found in the previous study,. The novel pathway found in this study
  and the compounds whose endogenous existence have proven in this study are described
  in red. AHX: 2-azahypoxanthine, AICA: 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide, AICAR: AICA
