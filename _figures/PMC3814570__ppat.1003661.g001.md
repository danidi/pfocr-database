caption: (A) Schematic representation of how C. albicans morphology and biofilm formation
  is regulated by quorum sensing and signaling with other microbial species. (B) Farnesol
  and 3-oxo-C(12)-homoserine lactone both act on the Ras1 pathway to inhibit the yeast-to-hyphal
  transition by inhibiting Cyr1 and cAMP signaling.
