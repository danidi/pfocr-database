caption: Overview of the molecular control of stomatal development. (A) In Arabidopsis
  thaliana the stomatal lineage is initiated when an undifferentiated protodermal
  cell is specified to become a meristemoid mother cell (MMC) via the actions of a
  heterodimeric protein complex consisting of bHLH transcription factors SPEECHLESS
  (SPCH) and either SCREAM (SCRM) or SCRM2 (also referred to as ICE1 and ICE2). The
  MMC then undergoes an asymmetric entry division again promoted by SPCH and SCRM/2
  activity. SPCH is phospho-regulated via the activity of a mitogen activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway that facilitates signals being relayed from the plasma membrane
  to the nuclear-residing transcription factors. TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) and ERECTA
  family proteins act to regulate external signals that trigger the MAPK pathway from
  outside the cell. Binding of EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF) 2 signaling peptide
  to ERECTA family proteins particularly ERECTA (ER) increases MAPK activity and SPCH
  is phosphorylated thereby preventing stomatal lineage progression. Conversely, if
  EPF-like 9 (EPFL 9, also known as STOMAGEN) outcompetes EPF2, then the MAPK pathway
  is not activated and SPCH activity is preserved. The heterodimeric unit of SPCH
  and SCRM/2 is self-regulatory as SPCH drives the expression of EPF2. Additional
  meristemoids can be generated via spacing divisions where an SLGC divides away from
  an already formed meristemoid, and via self-renewing amplifying divisions of an
  existing meristemoid. Both of these divisions are solicited by SPCH and SCRM/2 activity.
  For meristemoids to advance to guard mother cell (GMC) state, the bHLH MUTE is required
  in combination with SCRM/2. This is again under the control of the MAPK pathway.
  Instead of EPF2, EPF1 competes with EPFL9 for the binding of ERECTA proteins particularly
  ER-like 1 (ERL1) with moderation again via TMM. EPF1 bound ERL1 leads to increased
  MAPK activity and prevents stomatal lineage advancement. For a GMC to symmetrically
  divide and form a pair of guard cells (GCs) both MUTE, and then FAMA, again in combination
  with SCRM/2 are required. FAMA, like SPCH and MUTE, is also regulated via MAPK activity,
  although how this occurs is not well understood. (B) A suggested model for Physcomitrium
  patens stomatal development. Mosses and hornworts initiate stomatal development
  module when a protodermal cell expands and becomes an ovoid GMC. For P. patens,
  the GMC then undergoes an incomplete symmetric division leading to the formation
  of a single ovoid shaped GC. Where the previously described PpSMF1, PpSCRM1, PpTMM,
  PpEPF1, and PpERECTA1 gene products function during the developmental module remain
  to be determined.
