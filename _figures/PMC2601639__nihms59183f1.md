caption: '[Reviewed by (–)]. The pathway is triggered by Ras activation of membrane-bound
  phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) at the surface of the plasma membrane. In turn,
  PI3K phosphorylates the substrate lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2),
  yielding the product signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).
  Both Akt/protein kinase B (Akt) and phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) possess
  pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that specifically bind PIP3, thereby recruiting
  these kinases to the plasma membrane where PDK1 phosphorylates Akt at one or more
  specific sites required for activation of Akt kinase. Ultimately, the PIP3 signal
  is degraded by the membrane-bound phosphatase PTEN, yielding PIP2. The E17K mutation
  in the PIP3 binding pocket of Akt PH domain enhances membrane recruitment (), and
  leads to higher than native levels of phospho-activated Akt. Both PI3K and PTEN
  possess C2 domains believed to be involved in the plasma membrane recruitment of
  these enzymes (, ). Such C2 domains often bind lipids in a Ca2+-dependent or -independent
  manner and serve as membrane targeting modules (, ). Although the PI3K and PTEN
  C2 domains have both been reported to dock to phospholipid vesicles (, ), high affinity
  target lipids have not yet been identified for these domains.'
