caption: A role for PLD in bypass of the essential Sec14p requirement for yeast Golgi
  membrane secretory function. The gene products identified by ‘bypass Sec14p’ mutations
  are highlighted (black boxes), and their known (or inferred) physiological functions
  are indicated. CKIase (choline kinase; CKI1 gene product), CCTase (cholinephosphate
  cytidylyltransferase; PCT1 gene product), and CPTase (cholinephosphotransferase;
  CPT1 gene product) represent structural genes of the CDP-choline pathway for PtdCho
  biosynthesis. Loss-of-function mutations in each of these genes effect genetically
  recessive ‘bypass Sec14p’ phenotypes (). Likewise, loss-of-function for SacIp (SAC1
  gene product) or Kes1p (KES1 gene product) represent recessive ‘bypass Sec14p’ mutations
  (, , ). Genetically dominant ‘bypass Sec14p’ mutations define the BSD1 and BSD2
  genes (encode Bsd1p and Bsd2p, respectively). While kes1 and BSD1 mutations are
  suggested to act downstream of the DAG requirement for Golgi function (, ) and perhaps
  act to reduce the DAG requirement for Golgi secretory function, the remaining suppressors
  are proposed to act via Sec14p-independent maintenance of a Golgi DAG pool that
  is critical for Golgi-derived secretory vesicle biogenesis. DAG maintenance is promoted
  by decreased consumption via PtdCho biosynthesis (cki1, pct1, and cpt1) or by increased
  production via accelerated inositol phospholipid metabolism (sac1 and BSD2). These
  effects are proposed to fulfill the respective functions of PtdCho- and PtdIns-bound
  Sec14p (Sec14p∼PC and Sec14p∼PI) (, , ). None of these ‘bypass Sec14p’ modes is
  sufficient for Sec14p-independent Golgi secretory function in the absence of PLD.
  We propose that PLD may make sufficient PtdOH available to PAPs to provide the additional
  metabolic DAG input to support the ‘bypass Sec14p’ condition. Cho, choline; Cho∼P,
  choline-phosphate; CDP-choline, CDP-Cho.
