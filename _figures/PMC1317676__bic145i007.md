caption: Haem exerts regulatory effects on both ALAS-1 and HO-1 to control both its
  synthesis and degradation. ALAS-1 catalyses the formation of ALA from glycine and
  succinyl-CoA. Haem is synthesized from ALA through a series of intermediary steps
  catalysed by the enzymes of the haem biosynthetic pathway. Several steps in the
  production of functional mature ALAS-1 protein are down-regulated by exogenous or
  endogenous haem, as indicated by the minus signs, or by the plus sign indicating
  increased degradation of ALAS-1 mRNA. Haem is also incorporated into apo-haemoproteins
  [such as CYP (cytochrome P450) proteins and mitochondrial cytochromes] as the prosthetic
  group to form functional holo-haemoproteins.
