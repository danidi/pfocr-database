caption: The Processing of Glucose as a Metabolic versus Signalling Pathways. (A)
  The metabolic pathway is understood as a solely cytosolic process, were hexokinase
  II (HKII) is set as first enzyme and initiates the gradual degradation of the carbon
  backbone of glucose to pyruvate (pyr−). The extrapolation of so-called “aerobic
  glycolysis” to include lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) and proton-linked monocarboxylate
  transporters (MCTs) encounters two pitfalls. First, the reactions are illustrated
  with arrows indicating an equilibrium reaction catalyzed by single enzyme and not
  as two independent and sterically separated metabolic pathways. Second, following
  a sequential pathway, i.e., that the product of enzyme A is substrate of enzyme
  B, results in MCT catalyzed transfer of l-lactate (l-lac−), instead of monocarboxylic
  acids. (B, C) Glucose metabolism as signalling pathways can be divided in a “sending”
  pathway and a “receiving” pathway. The transferred signalling molecules are glucose,
  pyruvic acid (pyrH) and lactic acid (l-lacH). In the “sending” pathway, the MCT4·phosphoglycerate
  kinase (PGK) complex exports l-lacH and pyrH depending on the glycolysis rate or
  PGK activity. The “receiving” pathway utilizes the MCT1·carbonic anhydrase II (CAII)
  complex, which import monocarboxylic acids depending on cellular carbonic acid (H2CO3)
  flow. The imported l-lacH and pyrH are detected by heart lactate dehydrogenase (LDH-h)
  and muscle LDH (LDH-m) complexes, respectively. Here, LDH-m acts as a proton acceptor
  (PA) protein, whereas the LDH-h acts as proton donor (PD) protein and catalyzes
  the oxidation of l-lac− forming the proton carrier, NADH-H+. The LDH-m complexes
  are considered part of the glycolytic pathway, detecting the metabolism of glucose.
  The separation of unidirectionally catalyzed reactions into distinct pathways provides
  an explanation for why pancreatic β-cells release insulin in response to imported
  pyrH, similar to glucose .

  description: The Processing of Glucose as a Metabolic versus Signalling Pathways.
    (A) The metabolic pathway is understood as a solely cytosolic process, were hexokinase
    II (HKII) is set as first enzyme and initiates the gradual degradation of the
    carbon backbone of glucose to pyruvate (pyr−). The extrapolation of so-called

    are illustrated with arrows indicating an equilibrium reaction catalyzed by single

    Second, following a sequential pathway, i.e., that the product of enzyme A is
    substrate of enzyme B, results in MCT catalyzed transfer of l-lactate (l-lac−),
    instead of monocarboxylic acids. (B, C) Glucose metabolism as signalling pathways
    can be divided in a “sending” pathway and a “receiving” pathway. The transferred

    In the “sending” pathway, the MCT4·phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) complex exports
