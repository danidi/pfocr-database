caption: 'Overview of the Hedgehog signaling pathway: a simplified model for Hh signaling
  in mammalian cells. SMO is the key transducer of the Hh pathway. (a) In the absence
  of the Hh ligands, the putative Hh receptor PTC is localized in the cilium and inhibits
  SMO signaling. Gli molecules are processed with the help of Su(Fu)/KIF7 molecules
  into repressor forms, which deactivate the Hh signaling pathway. (b) In the presence
  of Hh, PTC is displaced out of the cilium and unable to inhibit SMO. Hh reception
  facilitates conformational changes in SMO, promoting Gli activation (GliA) and stimulation
  of Hh target gene expression. Su(Fu) and KIF7 can inhibit this process.'
