caption: Simplified representation of exponential and post-exponential phase-dependent
  utilization of serine, glucose and glycerol by L. pneumophila. In vitro isotopologue
  labeling experiments using 13C-serine, 13C-glucose and 13C-glycerol revealed a bipartite
  metabolism in which serine (in red) is mainly used during the exponential phase
  of growth and enters primarily the TCA cycle, whereas glucose (in blue) and glycerol
  (in green) are shuffled into anabolic processes during the post-exponential growth
  phase of L. pneumophila. Relative carbon fluxes are depicted by the thickness of
  the arrows. For more detail, see the text. ED, Entner–Doudoroff pathway; PPP, pentose
  phosphate pathway; EMP, Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (glycolysis); TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (adapted from Eisenreich and Heuner, ).
