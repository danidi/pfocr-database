caption: Multiple modes of inhibiting HER3 pathway activation. Inhibitors are depicted
  in red. A. Targeted therapy against HER2 prevents HER2-dependent activation of HER3.
  Pertuzumab, a HER2 monoclonal antibody, binds domain II of the HER2 ECD and prevents
  ligand-dependent dimerization between HER2 and HER3. Trastuzumab binds domain IV
  of the HER2 ECD and prevents ligand-independent dimerization between HER2 and HER3
  in the context of HER2-amplified breast cancer. HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors,
  including lapatinib, afatinib and neratinib, bind the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD),
  compete with ATP-binding and prevent phosphorylation (P) of the HER3 C-terminal
  tail. B. The monoclonal HER3 antibody, MM-121 prevents ligand binding while LJM716
  specifically binds an epitope created by ECD domains II and IV in the HER3 closed
  conformation. U3-1287 is another HER3 monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular
  domain. C. HSP90, a chaperone protein, inhibits the proteosome-mediated degradation
  of phosphorylated HER2 and HER3. Inhibitors of HSP90, therefore, promote RTK degradation.
