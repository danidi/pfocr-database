caption: VEGF blockade induces endothelial dysfunction because autocrine VEGF is required
  for endothelial cell health. This results in the inhibition of VEGF-dependent vasodilatory
  pathways such as NO and PGI2, as well as the possible upregulation of vasoconstrictive
  pathways such as endothelin-1 (ET-1). Together with the loss of microvascular capillary
  density through capillary rarefaction, these mechanisms cause systemic vasoconstriction,
  resulting in increased afterload and hypertension. Endothelial dysfunction and VEGF
  blockade also resets the pressure-natriuresis relationship resulting in inadequate
  renal sodium excretion in the face of elevated blood pressure. Finally, VEGF blockade
  may also block VEGFR-3 expressed on endothelial cells, decreasing lymphangiogenesis
  and reducing the capacity of the lymphatic network to buffer sodium and extracellular
  fluid (ECF) volume. Both of these latter two mechanisms will contribute to volume
  overload and exacerbate blood pressure rise.
