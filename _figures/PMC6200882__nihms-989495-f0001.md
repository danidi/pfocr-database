caption: Rapid EGFR testing approach. We implemented rapid EGFR testing in parallel
  to genotyping using next-generation sequencing (NGS; compare pathway A v B). As
  a result of differences in reporting times, detection of an actionable EGFR mutation
  with rapid testing might lead to a treatment decision before NGS results are obtained.
  Note that there is a (variable) delay from reporting to treatment decision and initiation
  of therapy because of cost-coverage determination, preauthorization requirements,
  etc. The ultra-rapid EGFR testing pathway (pathway C) is a multidisciplinary workflow
  designed to improve turnaround time using fresh tissue (frozen sections) to extract
  nucleic acids. Note that ultra-rapid testing combines preanalytical improvements
  with the optimized rapid workflow and allows coupling with NGS (). Dx, diagnosis;
  FNA, fine-needle aspiration; Neg, negative; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Pos,
  positive QC, quality control; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
