caption: A collective invasion pack shows phenotypic heterogeneity consisting of at
  least two subpopulations, a highly invasive leader cell (red) at the front of the
  pack and follower cells (green) immediately attached to and following the leader
  cell. The leader cell has increased VEGFA secretion, which promotes the motility
  and invasion of the follower cells. Other vasculogenesis signalling molecules are
  also utilized in the cell:cell communication between leader and follower cells,
  including VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VE-cadherin and Notch1 (not shown in the model for brevity);
  This atypical VEGF-based signalling allows for successful chain formation during
  invasion. Concomitantly, leader cells secrete excess fibronectin, which activates
  the canonical integrin/FAK pathway. This pathway allows for leader cells to create
  force to move the invasive pack forward into the microenvironment. Conversely, follower
  cells are a highly proliferative population that promote leader cell growth via
  a secreted factor, whereas leader cells secrete a factor that hinders follower cell
  growth. These data support a symbiotic relationship in the collective invasion pack
  in which the follower cells promote leader cell survival and leader cells promote
  follower cell escape.
