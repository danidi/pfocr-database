number: Figure 4
caption: Gene–gene network category and pharmacological category. (A) Co-expressed
  protein interaction network using the top 20 co-expressed genes for IDH1. By gene
  set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the 20 genes with the cancer/tissue type-specific
  information in this category, user can infer differentially activated pathways.
  The target gene is colored in red and other cmGenes in orange. (B) Enriched KEGG
  pathway information using all interacting genes from PathwayCommons. (C) Pharmacological
  information for SLC2A1. Gene-centric network, drug-centric networks and detailed
  information for each drug including the two-dimensional structure information are
  provided.
