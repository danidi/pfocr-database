  fatty acids provide energy through the production of acetyl coenzyme A under the
  combined catalysis of several enzymes. (B) Pathway of fatty acids provide energy
  in cardiomyocytes of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with cardiovascular disease.
  Accumulation of free long-chain fatty acids inhibits complete oxidation of medium
  and short-chain fatty acids leading to increased medium and short-chain acyl-COA.
  Medium and short-chain acylcarnitine increases due to the combination of these acyl-COA
  and carnitine. FA, fatty acid; COA, Coenzyme A; CPT 1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase

    Chain fatty acids provide energy through the production of acetyl coenzyme A under
    the combined catalysis of several enzymes. (B) Pathway of fatty acids provide
    energy in cardiomyocytes of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with cardiovascular
    disease. Accumulation of free long-chain fatty acids inhibits complete oxidation
    of medium and short-chain fatty acids leading to increased medium and short-chain
    acyl-COA. Medium and short-chain acylcarnitine increases due to the combination
