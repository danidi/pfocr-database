caption: Lycopene Production Pathway in Triple KOE. coli. By isolating the upstream
  metabolites from lycopene with a yield >1%, NetFlow isolated the main carbon flow
  between glucose and lycopene (top). The net reaction for the production of lycopene
  from pyruvate and G3P was then generated from this subnetwork (bot). The full descriptions
  for all metabolites and reactions contained in this subnetwork are given in  and
  , respectively.
