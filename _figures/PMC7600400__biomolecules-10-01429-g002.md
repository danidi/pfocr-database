caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) removal and effects. NADPH levels are crucial
  in ROS removal mechanisms and is produced through the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), malic enzyme (ME), nicotinamide nucleotide
  transhydrogenase (NNT), and one-carbon reactions (e.g., tetrahydrofolate metabolism).
  NADPH reduces oxidized forms of thioredoxin (TRX) and glutathione (GSSG), and these
  reduced forms (shown in red) then activate peroxiredoxin (PRX) and glutathione peroxidase
  (GPX) so that they can reduce H2O2 to water (H2O). ROS (mainly H2O2) and RNS (e.g.,
  nitric oxide) can cause the oxidative modification of protein cysteine thiol residues,
  most of which are reversible, and serve to protect them from oxidative damage, and
  to modify protein activity. Refer to text for details.
