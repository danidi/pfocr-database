caption: Schematic diagram of MR1 trafficking and presentation. MR1 is synthesized
  and accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in an unfolded state. In the presence
  of ligands derived from extracellular bacteria or tumor cells, MR1 binds to exogenous
  ligands and presents them on to the plasma membrane through the ER and Golgi (black
  dashed arrow). However, vitamin B metabolites, such as 6-FP, derived from an intracellular
  infection, utilize an alternative pathway to present the MR1-ligand complex at the
  cell surface. The MR1-ligand binding complex either passes to the plasma membrane
  or translocates into endosomes. In a low pH environment, the intracellular ligands
  are exchanged with exogenous ligands, such as 5-OP-RU or 5-OE-RU, and the MR1-ligand
  complex then translocates to the plasma membrane to be recognized by the TCR (green
  dashed arrow). β2M, β2-microglobulin; 6-FP, 6-formylpterin.
