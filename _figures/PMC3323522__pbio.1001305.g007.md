caption: (A) A revised model of the dafachronic acid biosynthetic pathway from dietary
  cholesterol, with newly identified activities shown in red. Although dhs-16 is required
  for lathosterone production, mutant animals still produce low levels of Δ7-DA. An
  alternative pathway for Δ7-DA synthesis is therefore likely. In addition, hsd-1
  is not required for 4-cholesten-3-one production as previously proposed, but may
  be involved in producing alternative dafachronic acids. These ligands may have complex
  regulation and influence the synthesis of one another. Comparison to mammalian bile
  acid synthesis (right) reveals conserved aspects of bile acid biochemistry. Nematode
  and mammalian bile acid synthesis involves modification at the 7-position (shown
  in pink), which speculatively may partition cholesterol towards bile acid synthesis,
  and in both pathways oxidation of the 3-alchohol and oxidation of the sidechain
  at the 27-position occurs (shown in orange). (B) Model of hormonal feedback on hypodermal
  daf-9::gfp expression. (i) Stressful environmental conditions result in downregulation
  of IIS and TGF-β signaling, suppression of DA synthesis, and hypodermal daf-9 expression
  by the DAF-12/DIN-1 repressor complex, resulting in dauer formation. (ii) Moderately
  stressful environments result in modest downregulation of dauer signaling pathways
  and DA synthesis, with compensatory upregulation of hypodermal daf-9, allowing for
  reproductive development. (iii) In favorable environments with low levels of stress,
  active IIS and TGF-β signaling results in ample DA production, with low expression
  of hypodermal daf-9. Note it is unknown whether DAF-12 regulates daf-9 directly
  or indirectly.
