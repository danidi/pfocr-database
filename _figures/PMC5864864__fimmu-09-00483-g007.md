caption: Proposed model of the temporal contributions of Wnt ligands and β-catenin
  to α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer)-induced interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-4 responses
  by liver natural killer T (NKT) cells. (A) Wnt production by myeloid cells and Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling negatively regulate early IFN-γ expression by NKT cells during α-GalCer
  challenge. Within hours after α-GalCer exposure, Wnt ligand expression in the liver
  environment is largely suppressed. This is accompanied by increased expression of
  endogenous Wnt signaling inhibitors such as Dkk1 and Sfrp1, as well as suppression
  of Tcf/Lef-driven transcriptional activity. Suppression of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  favors IFN-γ expression by NKT cells, which is partially supported by β-catenin-independent
  signaling events driven by Wnt ligands originating largely from non-myeloid cells.
  (B) β-catenin activity contributes to IL-4 expression by liver NKT cells independent
  of Wnt ligand production, at least during the first 6 h analyzed in the mouse model
  utilized here. While NKT cells are, in principle, equipped with the signaling machinery
  required to relay Wnt signaling via β-catenin-dependent and -independent pathways
  as depicted in this model, direct experimental evidence for contributions of these
  molecular networks in NKT cells is pending. Moreover, it is important to emphasize
  that the effects of Wnt pathway perturbation on NKT cell cytokine responses may
  also result from indirect effects of Wnt ligands on other cells, such as antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs), NK cells, and hepatocytes.
