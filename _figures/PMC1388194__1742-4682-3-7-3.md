caption: 'Diagram of the cell cycle model. In this discrete model, cells progress
  through a cell cycle comprising three phases: G1, S, and G2M. At the end of the
  G2M phase, cells divide and new cells begin their cycle in G1. At the last stage
  of phase G1, we modelled the restriction point R, where DNA integrity and external
  conditions (overpopulation and hypoxia) are checked. If overpopulation occurs, APC
  is activated; if hypoxia occurs, SMAD is activated. Both these conditions lead cells
  to G0 (quiescence). Cells remain in the quiescent phase in the absence of external
  changes, otherwise they may return to the proliferative cycle (at the first step
  of S phase). DNA damage can also activate the p53 pathway, which leads cells to
  the apoptotic phase. Cells at the end of the apoptotic phase die and disappear from
  the computational domain.'
