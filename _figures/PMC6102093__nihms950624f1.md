caption: Schematic illustration showing mechanisms of smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic
  switching. In response to vascular disease, SMC phenotypically switch from contractile
  cells to proliferative and migratory SMC characterized by downregulation of SMC
  contractile proteins (ex. smooth muscle α actin (ACTA2), smooth muscle myosin heavy
  chain 11 (MYH11)). SMC mitogen platelet derived growth factor beta (PDGF-BB) is
  known to induce SMC phenotypic switching. PDGF-BB can change cell bioenergetics,
  including shifting SMC metabolism to fatty-acid oxidation, increasing reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production, and inducing mitochondrial fission, via increasing phosphorylation
  of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and decreasing mitofusin 2 (MFN2) levels. Vascular
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (NOX) NOX1 and NOX4
  generate superoxide (O2−) and are known to drive SMC switching. The soluble guanylate
  cyclase (sGC)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-protein kinase G (PKG) pathway
  signaling maintains SMC quiescence and mediates physiological vessel dilation. Excessive
  ROS generation results in oxidation of the sGC heme iron (Fe2+ to Fe3+) inhibiting
  binding of nitric oxide (NO) to sGC. Restoration of the sGC heme iron back to its
  NO-sensitive Fe2+ state is done endogenously by NADH cytochrome B5 reductase 3 (Cyb5R3)
