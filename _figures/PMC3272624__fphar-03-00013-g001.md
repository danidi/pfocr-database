caption: Schematic depicting mTORC1 signaling in a NAC a medium spiny neuron with
  anterogradely transported BDNF being released from a VTA dopamine neuron terminal
  and glutamate released from a prefrontal cortex projection neuron. [Note however
  that BDNF can also be released from PFC projection neurons]. A number of addiction-relevant
  receptor systems including mGluRs and BDNF (but also dopamine and ionotropic glutamate
  receptors), can signal via the phosphoinositide-3′ (PI3K) – AKT pathway to regulate
  mTOR activity. The recruitment of PI3K and the production of phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) elicits 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1
  (PDK1) activity which in turn phosphorylates AKT. AKT activation is then thought
  to lead to the phosphorylation of tuberin (TSC2). Phosphorylation of TSC2 by AKT
  reduces TSC1/2 activity and consequently increases mTOR activity; a process that
  is thought to involve a Rheb-mediated inhibition of FKBP38 (or FKBP12 in the brain,
  Hoeffer and Klann, ) – the latter being an inhibitory binding protein that prevents
  mTOR complex 1 formation. FKBP12 prevents the binding of the mTOR complex protein
  regulatory-associated protein with TOR (Raptor) with the FRB binding domain through
  a process facilitated by rapamycin (FKBP12-rapamycin). mTORC1 phosphorylates 4E-BPs,
  a family of translational repressor proteins, which leads to their dissociation
  from eIF4E, enabling it to form the eIF4F complex for cap binding and participation
  in the initiation of translation of a range of mRNAs. Thus, mTOR-mediated phosphorylation
  of 4E-BPs and S6Ks leads to increased translation of mRNA – including transcripts
  that encode proteins required for synaptic plasticity such as GluR1 AMPARs. Akt,
