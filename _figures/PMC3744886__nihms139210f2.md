caption: The metabolic pathways controlled by lysine and glycine riboswitches. (A)
  Diaminopimelate pathway of lysine biosynthesis and lysine import pathways in various
  bacteria. Gene names are indicated in accordance to E. coli nomenclature. B. subtlis
  gene names are underlined. Putative lysine transport genes are boxed. Lysine riboswitches
  that repress expression of single genes or are located upstream of the first gene
  of the operon in any bacteria are shown with red lines. Most bacterial species,
  including E. coli, convert tetrahydrodipicolinate to diaminopimelate via succinylated
  DAP derivatives. Some species, including B. subtilis, use acetylated intermediates.
  Bacillus sphaericus perform conversion in one step using a unique DAP dehydrogenase
  encoded by the ddh gene. The figure is modified from refs. [, ]. (B) Simplified
  schematic of glycine metabolism and TCA of Cand. P. ubique. The glycine riboswitches
  that activate gene expression are shown by green arrows. The figure is adapted from
  ref. [].
