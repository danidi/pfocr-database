caption: '(A) A network of hits highly enriched in cell cycle-related genes. Solid
  lines, physical interactions; dashed lines, indirect interactions. (B) A network
  of physically interacting (solid lines) hits clustered around protein kinase A and
  calmodulin. ER K1/2 is drawn as a central component based on numerous indirect links
  between constituents of these pathways and ER K activation. (C) An example of a
  cluster identifying a new target candidate, the transcription factor HNF4A, a known
  master regulator of multiple targets relevant to tumor aggressiveness, as a hub
  connected to numerous resistance genes. Although this gene has not itself been found
  among the hits in any analyzed screens, it can directly transcriptionally regulate
  multiple sensitizing hits from different screens, and may be worth exploration as
  a possible therapeutic target. Pathway-centered network modules clustered around
  subsets of hits pooled from different screens were assembled using Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis Software, then redrawn for image clarity. Protein complexes retrieved by
  Ingenuity are colored according to the status of the constituents: sensitizing hits
  are shown in red and antagonistic hits in green. Functionally related non-hit proteins
  have been provided to connect the hit network, and are indicated in white.'
