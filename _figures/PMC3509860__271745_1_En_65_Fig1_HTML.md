caption: Pathway for synthesis and catabolism of dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine
  and serotonin are formed from tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp) respectively.
  The rate limiting enzymes are tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase
  (TPH) and these enzymes require the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). In brain,
  BH4 is synthesized from GTP in a three step pathway with the final step being catalyzed
  by sepiapterin reductase (SR). SR deficiency leads to conversion of 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin
  (6PTP) to sepiapterin which is in turn converted to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) (dashed
  line). SR deficiency causes decreased levels of BH4, and consequently low levels
  of dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic
  acid (HVA). GTP GTP cyclohydrolase; NH2TP dihydroneopterin triphosphate; PTPS 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin
  synthase; DHPR dihydropteridine reductase; 5-HTP 5-hydroxytryptophan; AADC aromatic
  l-amino acid decarboxylase; MAO monoamine oxidase; COMT catechol-O-methyltransferase
