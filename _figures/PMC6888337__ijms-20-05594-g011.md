caption: 'Canonical pathway explaining the NASH progression from steatosis to hepatocellular
  carcinoma. Inside the box the genes identified by text-mining are represented. The
  toothed wheels represent the connections between the genes working together to accumulate
  toxic lipids that will lead to insulin-resistance and then inflammation and hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC). Thus, the steatosis due to an imbalance of lipid metabolism and
  accumulation of toxic lipids will progress to NASH due to the inflammatory processes
  and insulin resistance leading to expression of genes involved in tumor progression
  such as YWHAZ and YWHAH. Outside the box, other genes with specific polymorphisms
  (e.g., FADS1: fatty acid desaturase 1) or other factors such as cytokines/chemokines
  (e.g., increase of leptin and/or decrease of adiponectin) will accelerate and/or
  exacerbate the progression of the disease leading faster to cirrhosis and then HCC.
  This representation is not frozen but dynamic and can change depending on the future
  new data.'
