caption: Model for the trafficking of NMDA receptors at the corticostriatal synapse.
  Illustrated is a dendritic spine of a striatal projection neuron receiving input
  from a cortical axon, using glutamate as a transmitter (Glu) at the head of the
  spine, and from a nigrostriatal axon, using dopamine (DA) as a transmitter and forming
  a synapse on the shaft of the spine. The effects of glutamate are mediated by NMDA,
  AMPA, and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). These are linked to each other
  and to additional signaling molecules via the proteins of the postsynaptic density
  (PSD). Dopaminergic inputs are mediated by the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. These
  receptors have reciprocal effects on the formation of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase (AC),
  but most striatal neurons express a preponderance of a single dopamine receptor
  type, depending on whether they contribute to the direct or indirect pathways. In
  addition to the NMDA receptors that are present at the excitatory synapse, our data
  suggest that there is a pool of assembled receptors within intracellular vesicular
  compartments. The vesicle-associated receptors are characterized by the absence
  of tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation of the NR2A and NR2B subunits. Activation of dopamine
  D1 receptors leads (via mechanisms that are not well defined) to tyrosine phosphorylation
  of the vesicular NMDA receptor subunits by a tyrosine kinase [perhaps a member of
  the src family reported to phosphorylate NMDA subunits at tyrosine residues ()]
  and insertion of the receptors into the synaptic membrane. There is also a tonically
  active tyrosine phosphatase, which may be a member of the STEP family. The diagram
  also illustrates the serine (S) phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit, which is regulated
  both by the direct action of cAMP on protein kinase A (PKA) as well as by the DARPP-32
  pathway; phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by PKA inhibits the dephosphorylation of NR1
  by protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1; ). Although protein kinase C has been reported to
  modulate the trafficking of NMDA receptors (), the precise role of cAMP in the phosphorylation
  of NMDA subunits at tyrosine residues is not known. At present it is also uncertain
  whether serine phosphorylation plays a role in the trafficking of NMDA receptors
  at the corticostriatal synapse.
