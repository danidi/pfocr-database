caption: The regulation of metabolism by gain-of-function mutant p53. Tumor- associated
  mutant p53 binds and activates SREBPs, which induce the expression of many genes
  in the mevalonate pathway, a pathway that regulates lipid metabolism. Furthermore,
  mutant p53 activates the RhoA/ROCK signaling, which in turn stimulates the translocation
  of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane, and thereby promotes glycolysis and the Warburg
  effect in tumor cells. The activation of the mevalonate pathway and glycolysis by
  mutant p53 contributes to the role of mutant p53 in tumorigenesis.
