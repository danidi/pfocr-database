caption: 'Many potential signaling pathways for adiponectin in endothelial cells.
  Both isoforms of the adiponectin receptor (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) are expressed in
  endothelial cells, but mRNA for the AdipoR1 receptor, with a higher affinity for
  Globular Adiponectin (gAd), is more abundant. As in metabolically responsive tissues,
  one of the major signaling effects of adiponectin in endothelial cells is activation
  of AMP kinase. AMP kinase, in turn, activates Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase
  (eNOS) via a pathway that also appears to be dependent on Akt activation, which
  is linked upstream to phosphatidylinositol 3_-kinase (PI-3K) signaling. Both eNOS
  activation and Akt activation contribute to the effects of adiponectin on angiogenesis.
  Adiponectin also inhibits oxidized Low Density Lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced superoxide
  production, possibly through inhibition of cellular NAD(P)H oxidase activity. Reduced
  ROS generation may enhance (Nitric Oxide) NO production and diminish cell proliferation
  by adiponectin by ameliorating the suppression of eNOS activity and NO quenching
  by Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and by blocking oxLDLinduced MAPK activation, respectively.
  Adiponectin can also lead to endothelial apoptosis via upstream caspase activation.
  The solid arrows and dotted lines reflect stimulatory and inhibitory effects, respectively.
