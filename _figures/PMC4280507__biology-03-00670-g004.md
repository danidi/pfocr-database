caption: 'One carbon metabolism and the effects of alcohol (EtOH) and nutrition throughout
  the metabolical pathway. Ethanol is known to increase histone 3 (H3) acetylation,
  increase and decrease H3 methylation levels, and alter mitogen-activated protein
  (MAP) kinases. Ethanol can also have an effect on S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) biosynthesis,
  which is a methyl donor for DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases
  (HMTs), thereby having an effect on DNA methylation (generally hypomethylation).
  It also plays roles in other metabolic pathways (e.g., polyamine synthesis, transsulfuration,
  transmethylation, DNA synthesis) []. Overall, the biochemical cycle is complex and
  involves many metabolites and compounds. Green boxes and arrows demonstrate the
  resulting cellular functions. Symbols—Inhibits  ; Stimulates/Activates  ; Enzyme
