caption: Molecular scaffolds regulate the subcellular distribution of components of
  the MAPK pathway. Both IQGAP1 and KSR bind to Raf, MEK and ERK and are thought to
  localise the kinases to the plasma membrane, while MP-1 (through it interaction
  with p14) localises active MEK and ERK to endosomes. Following activation, ERK is
  free to phosphorylate cytosolic targets, or translocate to the nucleus and activate
  nuclear targets. KSR binds to ERK dimers and restricts them to cytosolic targets.
  Like MP-1, β-arrestins localise Raf, MEK and ERK to endosomes. However, once activated
  ERK is prevented from translocating to the nucleus and is restricted to cytosolic
  targets by an unknown mechanism. Sef restricts MEK and ERK to the Golgi and, like
  β-arrestin, prevents translocation of ERK to the nucleus, limiting it to cytosolic
  substrates. GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase.
