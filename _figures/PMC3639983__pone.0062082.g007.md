caption: Rapid cell cycle progression is one of the features of the proliferated cancer
  cell. Inhibition of microtubule polymerization by Ching001 arrests M-phase cell
  cycle progression and leads to DNA damage. In addition, Ching001 treatment triggered
  activation of ER stress signaling pathway through the activation of PERK and caspase-4
  signaling cascade. Prolonged M-phase arrest and activated ER stress signaling subsequently
  induce apoptosis in the cancer cell treated with Ching001.
