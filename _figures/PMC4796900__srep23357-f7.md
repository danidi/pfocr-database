caption: Most of the proteins and amino acids that were quantified by proteomics,
  immunoblotting and physiological experiments were integrated as blue histograms
  (CMS line) and red histograms (maintainer line) in the pathway. The protein names
  are indicated in bold type. As shown in this figure, from the tapetal layer stage
  on, the amino acid synthesis pathway is severely impeded in the CMS line.
