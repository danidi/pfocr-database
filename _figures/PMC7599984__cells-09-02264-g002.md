caption: Notch signaling pathway. Schematic representation of the Notch signaling
  pathway. Notch signaling is activated by Delta-like ligand or Jagged ligand expression
  on a neighboring cell which binds to the Notch receptor. γ-secretase cleaves off
  the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor (NICD), which then translocates to
  the nucleus to form a transcriptional activation complex. NICD and co-activator
  Mastermind (MAML-1) binds to the DNA binding protein Centromere Binding Factor1
  (CBF-1) to initiate Notch target gene expression. (Left side nucleus) After Notch
  signaling has occurred, the NICD and MAML-1 detaches from CBF-1, to which NICD is
  recycled into the cytosol. The Notch receptor is replenished by fusion of the newly
  formed extracellular Notch receptor domain and the NICD on the cell membrane for
  ligand binding.
