caption: Cognate interactions between antigen presenting cells (APC) and T cells yield
  immune cell-derived complement production, which activates through the alternative
  pathway to yield C3a and C5a. The anaphylatoxins bind to their respective receptors
  (C3aR1 and C5aR1 respectively) on the interacting partners to induce APC maturation
  and effector T cell proliferation/expansion, survival, and differentiation. The
  same signals simultaneously inhibit the generation, stability, and function of regulatory
  T cells (Treg) in part by inhibiting Foxp3 expression. As C5aR2 binds C5a but lacks
  a GPCR signaling motif, C5aR2 expression on T cells limits the ability of free C5a
  to bind to C5aR1 and thus facilitates Treg induction by limiting C5a/C5aR1 ligations.
