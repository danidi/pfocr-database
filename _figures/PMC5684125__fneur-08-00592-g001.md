caption: 'Direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways. The cerebral cortex sends input
  to the striatum. Dopaminergic projections from the SNc (violet connectors) target
  striatal neurons expressing D1 or D2 receptors. Direct pathway (orange connectors):
  D1 neurons send direct inhibitory projections to the SNr/GPi. Indirect pathway (blue
  connectors): D2 neurons connect indirectly to the GPi/SNr through the GPe and STN.
  The SNr inhibits the SC. In Parkinson’s disease, dopaminergic depletion leads to
  reduced inhibitory direct pathway output (thin lines) and increased excitatory indirect
  pathway output (thick lines) onto the GPi/SNr and, consequently, increased SNr inhibition
  onto the SC as net effect. SNc, substantia nigra pars compacta; GPe, external globus
  pallidus; STN, subthalamic nucleus; GPi, internal globus pallidus; SNr, substantia
  nigra pars reticulata; SC, superior colliculus.'
