caption: 'Estrogen, HER2 signalling, and the PI3K/Akt pathway in drug-resistant breast
  cancer.Notes: ER can activate gene transcription by nuclear translocatin following
  ligand binding (1) or as a result of receptor phosphorylation in the absence of
  ligand (2). ERs may also be found associated with the plasma membrane in the presence
  of SRC and other adaptor proteins. Here, ligand binding triggers nongenomic effects
  via activation of signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and the Ras/MAPK pathways
  (not shown) (3). These pathways are also activated by ligand binding to the GPR30
  (4) and by growth factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases, including HER2, inducing
  autophosphorylation and downstream signalling (5). The PI3K/Akt pathway (6) as indicated
  is a covergence point in the mechanisms implicated in drug resistance in the three
  types of breast cancer discussed here, as pathway hyperactivity frequently occurs
  with multiple downstream effects (7). Data from–,,,,,,,,Abbreviations: BAD, Bcl-2-associated
