caption: Schematic representation of the engineered biosynthetic pathway for geraniol
  in S. cerevisiae. Geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) is produced in wildtype S. cerevisiae
  via the mevalonate pathway (dark gray box). One copy of the genes encoding the blue
  enzymes were introduced into the yeast genome. The genes for the green enzymes were
  introduced on a high-copy plasmid. For peroxisomal localization of the green enzymes,
  the peroxisomal target sequence 1 (PTS1), consisting of the amino acids SKL, was
  attached to the C-terminus. All genes were expressed under constitutive promoters.
  The genes encoding the red, crossed enzymes have been deleted from the genome.
