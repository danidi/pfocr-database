caption: When coronatine enters a plant cell, two branches of signaling occur. One
  is the hormone system. Coronatine and Jasmonate share the same receptor, COI1. The
  receptors of IAA, JA and Gibberellins are components of the SCF complex that consists
  of ASK, CUL and RBX, so coronatine can affect IAA, JA and Gibberellins pathways
  by receptor COI1. Coronatine also promotes stomata reopening through the E3 ligase
  subunit COI1. The pathway for stomatal closure involves triggering of the salicylic
  acid (SA) and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways. The precursor of the ethylene
  ACC is similar to CMA, which is the precursor of coronatine. Thus coronatine improves
  plant production of ethylene. In brief, coronatine can manipulate almost every hormone
  signaling pathway. The other is physiological metabolism, coronatine mainly affects
  nitrogenous metabolism first. High concentration coronatine can lead to leaf chlorosis,
  but low concentration coronatine makes wheat leaves show a greener phenotype under
  heat stress. This function works by regulating protein processed and chloroplast
  ultrastructure to maintain photosynthetic performance in plants.
