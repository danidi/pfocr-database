caption: Model of the Farnesiferol B-mediated protection against ischemia/reperfusion-induced
  AKI. I/R induces ROS generation that causes tubular cell damage (shown in purple-blue).
  In parallel, inflammatory cell infiltration (shown in red) also promotes oxidative
  stress and post-hypoxic kidney damage after I/R. Farnesiferol B-mediated TGR5 activation
  induces the antioxidant Nrf2 pathway and inhibits the proinflammatory NF-κB signaling
  pathway, which in turn protects the kidney from tubular damage and inflammation.
