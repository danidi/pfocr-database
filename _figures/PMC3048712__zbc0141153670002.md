caption: Lipoic acid biosynthetic and salvage pathways. A, mode of attachment of lipoic
  acid and the structure of the innermost LD of the E. coli PDH E2 protein (AceF).
  In this depiction, the lipoylated lysine is at the top of the structure (the protruding
  β-turn) and the N and C termini of the domain are at the bottom of the structure.
  B, biosynthetic pathway is at the top of the figure, and the LplA-dependent salvage
  pathway is at the bottom. Lipoic acid is synthesized as an offshoot of fatty acid
  biosynthesis by the consecutive activities of LipB and LipA. LipB transfers an octanoyl
  moiety from octanoyl-ACP to the ϵ-amino group of a specific lysine residue of the
  highly conserved lipoyl domains of the PDH, OGDH, and Gcv complexes. LipA then inserts
  two sulfur atoms at positions 6 and 8 of the octanoyl moiety of the LipB product
  to form the functional enzyme complexes. The curved arrow is the putative pathway
  that would proceed by sulfur insertion into octanoyl-ACP (see Introduction). Carbons
  6 and 8 of the octanoyl moiety are labeled.
