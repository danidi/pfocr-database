caption: Syntenin-mediated signaling in the regulation of membrane structure and cell
  motility. (A) Syntenin facilitates the motility and metastasis of tumor cells. Syntenin
  activates the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-c-Src kinase complex and induces the degradation
  of Inhibitor kappa B Iκ-B, resulting in the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB) into the nucleus. Consequently, NF-κB induces the gene expression of matrix-metalloprotease
  (MMP)-2, ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), and cell division control protein
  (Cdc)42, inducing the degradation of the extracellular matrix and increasing cell
  motility by F-actin regulation. (B) Schematic illustration of representative cell
  shapes and F-actin rearrangement in breast cancer cells upon syntenin RNA interference
  (RNAi) treatment. The images refer to Menezes et al. []. (C) Syntenin binds to the
  cytoplasmic tail of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) and strengthens
  the binding by coupling ALCAM to the actin cortex. Ezrin also connects some of the
  ALCAM molecules to actin at juxtamembrane sites. Upon binding of ALCAM to its ligand
  cluster of differentiation (CD)6, the complex is strengthened, and syntenin as well
  as ezrin can be phosphorylated, leading to outside-in signaling and ultimately to
  cellular responses, most likely adhesion strengthening. (D) Model of the CD63-syntenin-ALIX-dependent
  trafficking of human papillomaviruses (HPV). Its endocytosis occurs at the CD63-enriched
  microdomains of plasma membrane. Virus uptake starts with recruitment of syntenin
  and ALG-2 interacting protein X (ALIX) at early endosomes. The CD63-syntenin-ALIX
  complex promotes post-endocytic trafficking of HPV to multivesicular bodies. (E)
  Syntenin-ALIX complex is involved in exosome biogenesis and release. Syntenin associates
  with syndecan and CD63 in exosomes, and promotes their releases. Biogenesis is enhanced
  by interaction between ALIX and Src, which phosphorylates syndecan and syntenin.
  (F) Syntenin works as an adaptor protein for Unc51.1, SynGAP, and Rab5. Unc51.1
  activates SynGAP and downregulates Rab5 activity, resulting in inhibition of the
  early endosome pathway and the promotion of neurite extension. (G) Syntenin-mediates
  anoikis-resistance. Syntenin can activate PKCα in an FAK-dependent manner, and induce
  Bcl-2 phosphorylation. This signaling promotes anti-apoptotic protective autophagy
  instead of toxic autophagy.
