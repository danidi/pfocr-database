caption: Hypothetical early pathway (thick black arrows) to MTM (1) and shunt pathways
  (open and dotted arrows) to 4 and 5 with the concluded hypothetical new roles of
  oxygenases MtmOI, MtmOII, and MtmOIII, as well as ketoreductase MtmTII. The structural
  formula of 4 shows the carbon enrichments after feeding MtmOII−-mutant S. argillaceus
  M7OII with [1,2-13C2]acetate.

papertitle: Premithramycinone G, an Early Shunt Product of the Mithramycin Biosynthetic
  Pathway Accumulated upon Inactivation of Oxygenase MtmOII.
