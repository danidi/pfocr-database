caption: The sensitivity of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) carriers
  to COVID‐19 inflammatory response. The absence of functional CFTR on the surface
  of the airway cells mediates the inflammatory response in CF that initiates a chronic
  pro‐inflammatory response through NFκB (A). In the presence of ΔF508‐CFTR on the
  cell surface of CF heterozygotes is a critical mediator of this hyper‐inflammatory
  immune response. Furthermore, in the presence of misfolded CFTR protein may also
  trigger the NFκB inflammation signalling pathway (B). The endocytosis of the ACE‐2
  receptor after COVID‐19 binding leads to the accumulation of Angiotensin II and,
  therefore, respiratory distress and lung injuries through NF‐kB signalling (C).
  Consequently, heterozygotes of CFTR are more sensitive to cytokine storms mediated
  by NF‐kB, and the severity of SARS‐CoV‐2 is higher on this population
