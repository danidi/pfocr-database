caption: 'Canonical microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis pathway. Canonically, the miRNAs are
  transcribed in the nucleus via their own promoters or their host gene promoters
  by RNA polymerase II or III. This results in the formation of a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA)
  transcript, which can range from hundreds to thousands of nucleotides long. After
  a polyadenylation and capping event, pri-miRNAs undergo a microprocessing cleavage
  event by a ribonuclease (RNase) III type enzyme, Drosha, and its binding partner
  DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8) resulting in a ~60–120 nucleotide-long
  precursor miRNA transcript (pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNAs are then exported out of the
  nucleus by the karyopherin exportin-5 to the cytoplasm, where the RNase II enzyme,
  Dicer, processes the transcripts to form a miRNA duplex. The unwinding of the miRNA
  duplex occurs and one strand is usually degraded (miRNA* (star) strand), while the
  other (mature miRNA) is loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The
  RISC probes for targets of the miRNA in the genome. Once bound to a target mRNA,
  the RISC may induce a negative expression of the mRNA in three ways: (1) mRNA destabilization
  and degradation, (2) mRNA translational inhibition, or (3) mRNA cleavage. The path
  at which the mRNA is regulated depends upon multiple factors of the mature miRNA.'
