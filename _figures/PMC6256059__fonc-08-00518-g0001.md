caption: Notch receptor maturation, ligand dependent and independent activation pathway
  and targetable steps. Representation of Notch receptor maturation, ligand dependent
  and independent activation and the key enzymes involved. Text in red represents
  steps that can be targeted. The red star in Notch extracellular domain represents
  Notch activating mutations leading to ligand independent signaling. (CBF1, Su(H),
  Lag1), CSL; NICD, Notch intracellular domain and MAML, Mastermind-Like.
