caption: '(A) In cancer cells, DSG3 is overexpressed and captures more molecules of
  plakoglobins in the membrane. Loss of the antagonist function of plakoglobin results
  in more molecules of β-catenin entering the nucleus, which subsequently activates
  the expression of TCF/LEF downstream target genes c-myc, cyclin D1, and MMP-7 resulting
  in malignant cells. (B) Silencing DSG3 by shRNA treatment reverses the effects of
  DSG3, resulting in translocation of plakoglobin to the nucleus thus rendering the
  negative regulatory effect of plakoglobin on TCF/LEF transcription. (Pg: plakoglobin;
  B: β-catenin).'
