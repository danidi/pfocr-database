caption: Vpr induces G2/M arrest through activation of the SLX4 complex. (1) Under
  physiological conditions, inactive MUS81-EME1 interact with the SLX4 scaffold. (2)
  Upon Vpr expression, PLK1 and VPRBP are recruited to SLX4. (3) PLK1 phosphorylates
  EME1 while VPRBP causes ubiquitination of MUS81. (4) These posttranslational modifications
  contribute to activation of SLX4-bound MUS81-EME1 that can process healthy replication
  forks (RF) in cycling cells. (5) This leads to activation of the ATR signaling pathway
  and subsequent activation of CHK1. Activated CHK1 provokes inhibitory phosphorylation
  of CDC25C, leading to inhibition of CCNB1:CDK1 and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M
  transition. (4′) In addition, ubiquitinated MUS81 molecules are degraded by the
  proteasome machinery, leading to decreased steady-state levels of MUS81. (5′) Consequently,
  UFBs are not processed and persist in Mitosis. This possibly contributes to overall
  G2/M arrest in Vpr expressing cells.
