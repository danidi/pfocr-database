caption: Iron is elevated in the peritoneal cavity of women with endometriosis, in
  endometriotic cysts, and in fallopian tube fimbriae. Iron engages in Fenton reactions
  resulting in ROS such as hydroxyl radicals. An excess of ROS can promote cell death
  such as ferroptosis. However, sublethal levels of ROS may lead to increased proliferative
  capacity (if balanced with an increase in anti-oxidant response) thereby promoting
  tumorigenesis. ROS can lead to increased c-Myc transcripts, directly reduce PTEN
  activity, and cause DNA mutations leading to inactivation of p53 and activation
  of K-Ras. Tumor cells are characterized by increased iron dependence. Therefore,
  therapeutic strategies targeting components of the iron pathway may prove useful
  in treating ovarian cancer patients.
