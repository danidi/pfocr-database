caption: Genetic model of the insect melanin biosynthesis pathway (). Tyrosine is
  the initial precursor for all insect melanins. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, encoded
  by pale) and DDC (encoded by Ddc) convert tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)
  and dopamine (dihydroxyphenylethylamine), which are the precursors for black melanin
  synthesis, respectively. yellow is required for synthesizing DOPA and dopamine melanins,
  which are eumelanins. Laccase 2 is a phenoloxidase gene required for cuticular pigmentation.
  Yellowish–tan hues are produced by N-β-alanyl dopamine (NBAD) sclerotin, which requires
  the function of ebony, black, and tan. N-acetyl dopamine (NADA), which is catalyzed
  by aaNAT, is a major constituent of colorless or transparent cuticle.
