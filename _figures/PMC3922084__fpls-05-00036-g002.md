caption: 'Integrated cell death pathway model linking drought stress and ER stress.
  Model showing pathways thought to be associated with activating cell death. Dotted
  lines represent proposed pathways. The triangles indicate possible drought-induced
  senescence inhibition points. The bent arrow indicates an antagonistic relationship.
  The lightning bolt indicates protein degradation. The model is based on the results
  of  from Glycine max and also incorporates information from Arabidopsis studies.
  The ABA attenuation loop is based on AtERD15 () which does not appear to activate
  NRP-B expression. The involvement of GmERD15, which contains a PAM2 domain, in the
  regulation of ABA signaling is yet to be demonstrated. AGB1, a heterotrimeric G
  protein thought to have a role in triggering the cell death signal; ATF6, activating
  transcription factor 6 related homologs (e.g., bZIP28 and 60); BiP, ER chaperone
  binding protein; Ire1p, inositol-requiring protein-1 homolog; NL, nuclear localization;
  NRP, N-rich proteins; PERK, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; SA, salicylic acid;
  eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (related references: ; ; ; ; ).'
