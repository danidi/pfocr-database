caption: Caspase activation by extrinsic apoptosis requires binding of the trimeric
  TNF family of death receptors by their cognate ligands such as TRAIL and FasL. Binding
  results in a conformational change within the cytoplasmic tails of these receptors
  and exposes DD sequences. FADD is then bound via similar DD sequences, which permit
  the recruitment of initiator procaspase 8 and several isoforms of the c-FLIP. Collectively,
  these proteins form the DISC, which facilitates the autocatalytic cleavage of procaspase
  8 into the active form of caspase 8. Depending on the cell type, caspase 8 can then
  cleave and activate procaspase 3 that targets several proteins including ICAD, which
  in turn liberates CAD to trigger DNA degradation and apoptosis. Conversely, caspase
  8 can also initiate MOMP by a pathway that overlaps intrinsic apoptosis and requires
  the BCL-2 family of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins as well as the BH3-only subgroup.
  Active caspase 8 can then cleave BID into tBID and skew the balance of pro- and
  anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. In doing so, anti-apoptotic proteins including BCL-2
  and BCL-XL are sequestered away from the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX and BAK, which
  together form pores in the mitochondria resulting in MOMP and apoptosis. Similarly,
  during intrinsic apoptosis, induction of an internal/external cellular stress results
  in the transcriptional up-regulation of BH3-only proteins that function like tBID.
  Following the BAX/BAK-induced MOMP, apoptotic molecules are released from the mitochondria
  including AIF, ENDOG, SMAC and cytochrome-c. AIF and ENDOG relocate to the nucleus
  and cause DNA fragmentation, whereas SMAC and cytochrome-c inhibit the family of
  pro-survival ubiquitin ligases known as cIAP. Finally, cytochrome-c, APAF1 and homodimers
  of procaspase 9 form the apoptosome. The apoptosome cleaves and activates several
  executioner caspases to commit the cell to apoptosis. It also induces surface expression
  of “eat me” signals such as PtdSer to initiate phagocytic clearance. TNF, tumor
