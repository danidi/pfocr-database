caption: Comparison of the levels of conservation of the 'terpenoid biosynthesis'
  pathway according to different sources (Swiss-Prot, KEGG and FUNGIpath). The level
  of conservation of each EC number involved in the 'terpenoid biosynthesis' pathway
  was computed in FUNGIpath (rectangle) and two public sources. The coloured triangles
  represent the Swiss-Prot data for the 17 species shared with FUNGIpath. The coloured
  circles stand for the KEGG data for the 12 species shared with FUNGIpath.
