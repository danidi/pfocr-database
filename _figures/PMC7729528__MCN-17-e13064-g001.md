caption: The one‐carbon metabolic pathway. Folate, as 5‐methyl‐THF, serves as the
  substrate for metabolic transformation of homocysteine to methionine via MTR. Methionine
  is converted to S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM), which serves as the principal methyl
  donor for methylation. Vitamin B12 acts as an intermediate methyl carrier during
  the MTR‐catalysed re‐methylation of Hcy to methionine, cycling between two states,
  cobalamin (I) and methylcobalamin (III) via TCN II. Cobalamin (I) is a strong reductant
  that can be oxidised to produce inactive cobalamin (II), which undergoes reductive
  methylation to methylcobalamin (III) via the MTRR enzyme using SAM as the methyl
  donor. Choline derived betaine can also serve as a methyl donor for the conversion
  of Hcy to methionine. B6, vitamin B6; B12, vitamin B12 (cobalamin, in various oxidative
