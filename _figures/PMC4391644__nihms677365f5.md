caption: In human melanoma A375 cells, where B-RAF is constitutively active, IGF1R
  signals mainly through the IRS1/2-PKB axis, inducing cellular survival and proliferation.
  NT157 binds to an allosteric site on IGF1R and induces a conformational change,
  leading to the dissociation of IRS1/2 from the receptor (I). This allows the receptor
  to interact more strongly with the adaptor protein Shc, and leads to the activation
  of C-RAF and to enhanced signaling to ERKMAPK. In the next step, cytoplasmic IRS1/2
  undergoes extensive Ser-phosphorylation, which is mediated by the ERKMAPKpathway
  (II). Ser-phosphorylated IRS1/2 is targeted for degradation by the proteasome (III),
  and IGF1R signaling becomes severely impaired. Thus, NT157 leads to long-lasting
  IGF1R inhibition, cancer cell apoptosis, and potent anti-tumor effects.
