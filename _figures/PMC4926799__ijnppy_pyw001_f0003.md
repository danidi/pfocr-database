caption: Summary of the mechanisms by which stress-related immune alterations may
  precipitate depression. Stress, psychological, physical, or combinational, is thought
  to be a major risk factor for depression. Chronic stress is thought to impact negatively
  on the inflammatory response system (IRS), potentially culminating in the manifestation
  of depressive symptoms. Specifically, a chronic inflammatory state, as a consequence
  of stress, may lead to activation and further dysregulation of both the innate and
  adaptive immune response, further promoting an inflammatory environment. The synthesis
  of serotonin in the CNS is dependent upon the availability of the essential dietary
  amino acid tryptophan (). In this regard, the kynurenine pathway is the major metabolic
  pathway for tryptophan in the body, resulting in the production of kynurenine and
  many downstream metabolites. Indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) is the rate-limiting,
  tryptophan-degrading enzyme of the kynurenine pathway and is upregulated in response
  to immune activation. Specifically, IFN-γ is the most potent inducer of IDO activation.
  However, IFN-γ-independent mechanisms such as prostaglandin E2 or interleukin (IL)-6
  in combination with TNF-α or IL-1β are also known inducers of IDO activity (; ;
  ). In addition to IDO, activation of the hepatic tryptophan-degrading enzyme tryptophan,
  2,3 dioxygenase (TDO) in response to psychological stress, glucocorticoids, or tryptophan
  itself, also results in kynurenine pathway activation in the liver (). Therefore,
  IDO/TDO induction has been proposed as a mechanism by which stress and inflammation
  can precipitate depression via kynurenine pathway activation and tryptophan depletion.
  A chronic inflammatory state may alter serotonergic neurotransmission via the depletion
  of tryptophan and increased production of neurotoxic and excitotoxic mediators,
  which in association with chronic stress and inflammation itself, may have a negative
  impact on the neurotrophin system and BDNF concentrations in the brain. Stress-induced
  immune activation is also thought to contribute to the induction of HPA-axis hyperactivity
  and glucocorticoid resistance (GR), thereby inhibiting the potent antiinflammatory
  effects of cortisol, which, in turn, contributes further to a dysregulated inflammatory
  response. Stress-related immune dysregulation and subsequent alterations in monoaminergic
  neurotransmission, the stress response system and the neurotrophic system, alone
  or in combination, have a detrimental impact on normal brain functioning, potentially
  culminating in the manifestation of the behavioral and physiological alterations
  that currently characterise the depressive condition. GR mechanisms adapted from
  , see for review). AP, Activator protein-1; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; GRE, glucocorticoid
  response elements; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase; NO, nitric oxide; NFκB,
