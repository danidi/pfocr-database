caption: 'Numerous arrestin functions play a role in apoptosis and cell survival.
  The activation of the death receptor TNFR1 by TNFα results in the assembly of the
  multi-protein complex I that activates the NFκB pathway along with JNK and p38 pathways.
  The NFκB signaling is antiapoptotic, mostly via transcriptional activation of FLIP
  that inhibits caspase-8 activation. Activation of JNK and p38 promotes apoptosis
  via transcriptional as well as posttranscriptional mechanisms (see text). Signaling
  complex II formed following internalization and reshuffling of signaling proteins
  directly activates caspase-8 that cleaves and activates effector caspase-3, caspase-6,
  and caspase-7 initiating apoptosis. Apoptotic pathway induced via death receptor
  is known as the extrinsic pathway. Caspase-8 also cleaves BID, generating tBID that
  translocates to the mitochondria inducing BAX-BAK oligomerization and cytochrome
  C release. Cytochrome C organizes apoptosome, activating caspase-9, which then activates
  massive amounts of caspase-3. Apoptosis can also be initiated by a variety of stress
  stimuli that engage the mitochondria-based apoptotic pathway termed the intrinsic
  pathway. Specifically, genotoxic drugs and other stimuli causing DNA damage initiate
  the intrinsic pathway via transcription factor p53 that upregulates pro-apoptotic
  genes BAX, PUMA, and NOXA. Arrestins have been shown to promote activation of MAP
  kinases by scaffolding (Chapters 12–14). GPCR-dependent activation of ERK1/2 by
  both nonvisual arrestins has been shown to provide protection against apoptosis
  induced by various agents in many cell types. Arrestin-3, but not arrestin-2, is
  able to activate neuron-specific JNK3 isoform. Although JNK3 has been shown to play
  an important role in neuronal apoptosis, the evidence of the role of arrestin-3-dependent
  JNK3 activation in neuronal death is so far lacking. Both arrestin isoforms interact
  with IκBα, an inhibitory protein that binds NFκB and holds it in the cytosol, preventing
  NFκB-dependent antiapoptotic transcription. Arrestins have been demonstrated to
  regulate the activity of the pro-survival Akt pathway. Arrestin-3 is able to reduce
  the Akt activity via scaffolding Akt together with PP2A that dephosphorylates Akt
  in response to D2 dopamine receptor stimulation. Arrestins have been shown to stabilize
  Mdm2 and promote its activation, as well as affect p53 degradation and level (see
  text for details). Arrestin-2 also interacts with p53 in the nucleus, acting as
  important adaptor for Mdm2 required for Mdm2-dependent p53 degradation. Interestingly,
  caspase-8 that cleaves BID also cleaves arrestin-2 at the C-terminus generating
  Arr2-(1-380) fragment. Arr2-(1-380) translocates to the mitochondria, directly binds
  tBID, and greatly enhances its ability to induce cytochrome C release from mitochondria,
  thereby promoting apoptosis. Black arrows indicate direct or indirect posttranslational
