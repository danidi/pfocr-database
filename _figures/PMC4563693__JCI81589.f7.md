caption: Our data collectively suggest that CTGF-treated CD146+ TSCs undergo a robust
  proliferation phase in 2–7 days of CTGF-initiated healing via the FAK/ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway. Then, the CD146+ TSCs differentiated into tenocyte-like cells starting
  at 7 days, which presumably is stimulated by secreted CTGF from CD146– tendon cells.
  The CD146+ TSCs differentiated by CTGF consequently led to the tendon regeneration
  featured by reorganized collagen matrix, normal level of cellularity, and functional
  restoration.
