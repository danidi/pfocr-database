caption: Esterases remove n-butyrate from Bu4ManNAc (1a, top) producing tributanoylated
  derivatives that include 3,4,6-O-Bu3ManNAc (1b) and 1,3,4-O-Bu3ManNAc (1c), two
  isomers that have significantly different biological activities. Subsequent hydrolysis
  of the remaining three n-butyrate groups ultimately generates ManNAc, which is the
  dedicated precursor for sialic acid biosynthesis in mammalian cells, and three additional
  equivalents of n-butyrate. The net effect of the metabolism of this exemplar SCFA-hexosamine
  is to produce (i) n-butyrate that modulates gene expression through HDACi activity
  and (ii) ManNAc that impacts transcription through glycosylation-related mechanisms.
  In concert, providing a primary motivation of this study, (iii) a recently discovered
  third mechanism suggests that ‘anti-cancer’ analogs with intact ester-linked SCFA
  (such as 1b) modulate gene expression by engaging the NF-κB pathway while high flux,
  non-toxic analogs (such as 1c) do not.
