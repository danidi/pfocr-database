caption: Working model of the innate immune sensing of tumors leading to spontaneous
  T cell responses in vivo. In the tumor microenvironment, tumor-derived DNA (likely
  released by dead cells, or via acquisition of DNA-containing vesicles) can gain
  access to the cytosol of intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs). Recognition of cytosolic
  DNA by cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), and generation of cGAMP, leads to
  the activation of STING (stimulator of interferon genes). This results in the phosphorylation
  of tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and subsequent activation, which in turn phosphorylates
  the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). This activates the
  transcription of type I interferon (IFN) genes. The STING pathway can be also deliberately
  stimulated by the use of direct STING agonists, when the compounds are therapeutically
  administered into the tumor microenvironment. In vivo studies using gene-targeted
  mice demonstrated a crucial role of STING pathway activation, type I IFN production,
  and its signaling on the BATF3 (basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like
  3) lineage of DCs for spontaneous antitumor T cell responses in vivo and recruitment
  of effector T cells into the tumor microenvironment. dsDNA, double-stranded DNA.
