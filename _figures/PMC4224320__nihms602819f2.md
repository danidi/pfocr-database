caption: A schematic representation of the PdfR signaling pathway. PdfR signals through
  Gαs and activates distinct adenylyl cyclases (ACs) in different classes of PdfR-expressing
  clock neurons. The action of PdfR is opposed by the phosphodiesterase Dunce (DNC),
  the abundance of which is regulated by GW182, a protein essential for microRNA-mediated
  gene silencing. Increases of cAMP levels stimulate protein kinase A (PKA), which
  leads to the stabilization of PERIOD (PER) protein, thereby adjusting the molecular
  clock. Please see section 1.6 for a full description.
