caption: With a few exceptions expression of CD137 is activation dependent. There
  is a variability in anti-CD137-mediated signaling. While in vitro anti-CD137 stimulation
  supports activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in vivo effects mediated by anti-CD137
  is complex. Administration of agonistic anti-CD137 mAbs supports robust CD8+ T cell
  expansion and constricts CD4+ T and B cell numbers and function. This latter in
  vivo effect of anti-CD137 is believed to result from over expression of IFN-γ, IL-10,
  TGF-β, granzymeB, perforin, and CTLA-4 and expansion of a novel immunoregulatory
  CD11c+CD8+ T cell subset. The increased IFN-g due to anti-mediated CD11c+CD8+ T
  cells upregulates indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in competent cells which when
  interact with partnering CD4+ T cells causes their deletion. This can be reversed
  by neutralizing IDO activity by 1-mehtyltryptophan.
