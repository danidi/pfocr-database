caption: mRNA-miRNA-pathway regulatory network. The square, circle and rhombus shapes
  represent miRNA, mRNA, and pathway respectively. The variation of node colors from
  green to red indicates change from down-regulated to up-regulated in gene expression.
  The red 'T' shape represents a negative connection between miRNA and mRNA. The black
  arrow represents a connection between mRNA and the participating pathway. miRNA/miR,
  microRNA.
