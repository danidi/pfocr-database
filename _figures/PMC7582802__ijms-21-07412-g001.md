number: Figure 1
caption: p38 in cardiovascular regeneration. (A) p38α blocks cardiovascular regeneration
  by inhibiting the expression of genes involved in cardiomyocyte proliferation and
  regeneration, such as Ect2, Crp1, ki67, cdc2, cyclin A, and p27, and reducing Rb
  phosphorylation to block cell-cycle progression. FGF1 stimulation has the opposite
  effect. (B) p38γ activates differentiation and myogenesis in satellite cells by
  phosphorylating MyoD and activating proliferation. p38α prevents p38γ activation
  in satellite cells, blocking regeneration. ↑ increase, ↓ decrease.
