caption: Schematic representation of the SMC1 participating in DNA damage repair signaling
  pathway. After DSB induced, BRCA1, cohesin (SMC1, SMC3 and RAD21) and MRN complex
  (MRE11, Rad50 and NBS1) are recruited to the damage site. Intermolecular autophosphorylation
  of ATM dimmers leads to release of active ATM monomers. Active ATM monomers can
  phosphorylate substrates such as BRCA1, NBS1 and SMC1. Both BRCA1 and NBS1 are required
  for the phosphorylation of SMC1, fully assembled as part of cohesin, by activated
  ATM, thus inducing S phase arrest. PTIP, MDC1 and RAD18 are involved in regulating
  SMC1 phosphorylation. Green Arrows represent activating events and red perpendicular
  ends represent inhibitory events.
