caption: A signal transduction pathway leading to the phosphorylation and activation
  of mTOR in response to insulin. Binding of insulin to its receptor activates the
  receptor tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1
  and/or –2 (). Phosphotyrosyl residues in these proteins serve as docking sites for
  PI 3-kinase, whose activation leads to activation of PKB. As described in the text,
  activation of PKB results in phosphorylation and activation of mTOR, although we
  stress that other kinases may be involved. Once activated, mTOR phosphorylates the
  translational repressor, PHAS-I, which dissociates from eIF-4E, thereby increasing
  the amount of eIF-4E available to mediate translation initiation ().
