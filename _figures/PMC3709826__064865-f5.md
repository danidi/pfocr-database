caption: Current model for the interaction between central metabolism, TolC and virulence
  gene expression in V. cholerae. ToxT is a direct activator for the CT gene and TCP
  genes (). The lack of respiration activity (NQR) and the outer-membrane protein
  TolC diminish TCA cycle activities. Diminished TCA cycle activities and addition
  of certain amino acids (NRES) increase acetyl-CoA flux through the PTA-ACK pathway.
  Such a change in metabolic flux results in the excretion of acetate into the external
  medium, which positively corresponds to increased toxT transcription. We propose
  that increased levels of acetyl-CoA (acCoA) activate toxT transcription either directly
  or indirectly. A recent study also showed the indirect repression of TCA cycle gene
  expression by ToxT (), suggesting the existence of a feedback loop between central
  metabolism and ToxT. The structure of TolC was adopted from . AcP, acetyl phosphate.
