caption: 'Transcription of the HXT2 gene is repressed by the Rgt1/Ssn6-Tup1 complex
  in the absence of glucose and under non-fermentable growth conditions (A). Rgt1
  recruits Ssn6-Tup1 in a Mth1-dependent manner to form the repressor complex. Mth1
  protein prevents Rgt1 phosphorylation by PKA kinase. Snf1 kinase is activated under
  these conditions []. Snf1 kinase phosphorylates and regulates the Mig1 interaction
  with DNA and Ssn6-Tup1. See the text for further details. LEGEND: Fps1- glycerol
  transporter/exporter, Stl1 –glycerol transporter [], Gut1- glycerol kinase converts
  glycerol to glycerol-3-phophate. (B) Under high-glucose conditions, the HXT2 gene
  is repressed by the Snf1-Mig1 pathway. Mig1 is dephosphorylated and recruits Ssn6-Tup1
  to mediate the repression. Snf1 induces the repression of MTH1 gene expression.
  Glucose binding generates a signal that leads to proteasomal degradation of Mth1
  via the Snf3/Rgt2-Rgt1 (SRR) pathway, which causes Rgt1 phosphorylation by PKA.
