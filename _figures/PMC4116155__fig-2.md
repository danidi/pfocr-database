caption: Schematic representation of P2X7R-mediated ROS production by NADPH oxidase.
  Activation of the P2X7R can promote ROS production by NADPH oxidases, a cell membrane
  complex consisting of several subunits. On assembly of these subunits in the membrane,
  this enzyme via its NOX2 (gp91phox) catalytic subunit generates a burst of ROS and
  activation of ASK1-p38 pathway. Activated P2X7Rs trigger NADPH oxidase activity
  by the translocation of NOX2 to plasma membrane, which is a critical step in the
  activation of the NADPH oxidase. This represents the major pathway for P2X7R-induced
  ROS formation. Calcium influx through P2X7R pore and mitochondrial overload could
  also mediate ROS production. Calcium can also stimulate NO synthase to generate
  NO, which enhances ROS production by mitochondria. It also appears that P2X7R activates
  ERK1/2/JNK1 pathways. These pathways trigger activation of various caspases, leading
  to changes in cellular functions. The best-characterized signaling downstream event
  of P2X7R activation is mediating the processing and release of IL-1β and IL-18.
  The P2X7R-induced and caspase-mediated cell apoptosis is also well established.
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; IL, interleukin.
