caption: Withdrawal of cytokines results in activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  due to imbalance between Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein family members and BH3 only
  pro-apoptotic proteins. Intrinsic apoptotic pathway in mast cells is upregulated
  by PGE2 via EP3 receptor and Ca2+-CaMII-ERK1/2 pathway. While Erk 1/2 mediated phosphorylation
  of BimEL and Bim L immediately after PGE2 stimulation and this leads to ubiquination
  and degradation of these isoforms, Erk also induces expression of c-Jun, a potent
  upregulator of Bim expression. Final outcome of Erk regulation of Bim is a balance
  between Bim degradation after its phosphorylation and increase in its expression
  due to c-Jun. Data presented here support view that increase expression of Bim and
  proapoptotic action of EP3-Ca2+-CamKII –Erk1/2 pathway is prevalent in mast cells
  in presence of PGE2 and during cytokine withdrawal.
