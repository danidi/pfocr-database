caption: 'Eukaryotic Phospholipid Synthesis and Editing.G3P produced by GPDH is converted
  to PA by sequential acylation reactions regulated by GPAT and LPAAT. PA is converted
  to CDP-DAG, from which PI is produced by PIS. Alternatively, the PA is hydrolyzed
  to DAG by PP. DAGs are combined with CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine to produce
  PC and PE, respectively; the enzyme responsible for these reactions (AAPTs) may
  have dual substrate specificity. Phosphoethanolamine produced by EK is an important
  intermediate for PE and PC biosyntheses. Cytosolic CKs also provide phosphocholine
  for PC biosynthesis from free choline, which may be recovered from PC by PLDs or
  derived from other tissues by phloem translocation. Phosphoethanlamine is converted
  to PE via CDP-ethanolamine, whereas the same substrate is methylated to phosphocholine
  by PEAMT and then converted to PC via CDP-choline. PE is a substrate for PS biosynthesis
  by BE-PSS, whereas PS is converted to PE by PSD. PC is the major substrate for desaturation
  and acyl editing. Acyl editing involves a dynamic exchange of fatty acids predominatly
  between the sn-2 (but also sn-1) position of PC and acyl-CoA pools, which may be
  regulated by PLA2 and LPCAT. PLMT catalyzes a putative pathway to PC via methylation
  of methyl-PE. In addition to the above pathways, the conversion of PGP to PG by
  PGP phosphatase (PGPP) is not shown.Abbreviations: AAPT, aminoalchoholphosphotransferase;
