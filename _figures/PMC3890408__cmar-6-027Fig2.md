caption: 'Cooperating mutational events in MYC-driven lymphomagenesis and novel therapeutic
  opportunities.Notes: Continuous MYC expression is required for BL cell survival,
  as demonstrated by the apoptotic effect of the MYC inhibitor 10058-F4 on BL cell
  lines. (Inhibitors of various pathway components are indicated in red lettering
  throughout, and appropriate references citing potential therapeutic approaches are
  indicated.) As a defense against continuous, high-level MYC expression and lymphoma
  development, the induction of rate-limiting apoptosis is most efficient when both
  the p53 and the BIM-induced apoptosis pathways are activated simultaneously. BLs
  undergo mutational and epigenetic changes during tumorigenesis to inactivate either
  one of these tumor suppressor pathways. Mutational events include loss of the p53
  activator p14ARF, mutation of p53, or an increase in expression of its upstream
  regulators MDM2 or MDM4, which target p53 for proteasomal degradation. The effect
  of MDM2 can be inhibited by nutlin in cells carrying wild type p53 resulting in
  p53 activation and apoptosis. Induction of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein BIM
  by MYC can be lost selectively in BL cells carrying mutant MYC protein. For example,
  MYC proteins mutated at Thr58 lose the ability to induce transcription of BIM. Transcription
  of BIM, or the p53 and TGF-β pro-apoptotic target gene PUMA, may also be suppressed
  through methylation of their promoters. BH3-mimetic compounds (ABT-737) are functionally
  similar to BIM and PUMA and have been shown to induce apoptosis of BL cell lines.
  Recent evidence has implicated signaling via PI3K/AKT/mTOR as being a critical cooperating
  oncogenic pathway in the development of BL. BL tumors display mutations in TCF3
  (E2A), ID3, and the inhibitory phosphatase, PTEN, that function to increase “tonic”
  B-cell receptor signaling through PI3K. Tonic BCR signaling is used to describe
  low-level antigen-independent signaling by the B-cell receptor. TCF3 is a transcription
  factor normally regulated by ID3. Mutations in ID3 relieve repression of TCF3, resulting
  in TCF3-mediated expression of heavy and light immunoglobulin chains components
  of the BCR and increased BCR signaling. Cyclin D3 mutations are also recurrent,
  and BL cells are dependent on cyclin D/CDK6 activity for proliferation. The stability
  of MYC itself is regulated by proteolysis through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.
  Targeting MYC for degradation is dependent on GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of
  Thr58. MYC may be stabilized in BL either through a Thr58–alanine mutational substitution,
  or through GSK3β inactivation by the cooperating PI3K pathway. Selectively blocking
  of PI3K, AKT, and/or mTOR signaling using various inhibitors (shown in red) correlates
  with induction of BL cell apoptosis. In addition, mTORC1/2 signaling through 4E-BP1
  and eIF4E (not shown) is required for 5’ cap-dependent protein translation. Blocking
  4EBP-1 activity using selective inhibitors (PP242 or BEZ235) decreases the expression
  of the prosurvival factor MCL-1 and MYC (short-lived proteins requiring continuous
  5’ cap-dependent protein translation for maintenance of expression), or induces
  BMF as a cellular stress response.Abbreviations: CDK6, cyclin-dependent kinase 6;
