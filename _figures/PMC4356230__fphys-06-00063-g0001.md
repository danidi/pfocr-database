caption: Pathways regulating skeletal muscle size. The balance between protein synthesis
  and protein degradation determines muscle size. Muscle protein synthesis is regulated
  through the Akt/mTOR pathway. There are four pathways of protein degradation to
  degrade cellular components, caspase-3 removes nuclei (apoptosis) and along with
  the calpain family of proteins can breakdown the contractile proteins (myofilaments)
  in muscle into smaller polypeptides. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) breaks
  down the small peptides and any other protein targeted by ubiquitination for degradation.
  Finally, autophagy breaks down organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic
  reticulum, and large protein aggregates.
