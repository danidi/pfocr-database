caption: Schematic of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5)–5-hydroxytryptamine
  (5-HT)–osteoblast pathway observed by Yadav et al. []. LRP5 was inhibitory of tryptophan
  hydroxylase 1 (Tph1) expression and resultant 5-HT synthesis in enterochromaffin
  cells in the gut, but had no direct effect on osteoblasts. A reduction in gut LRP5
  increased Tph1 expression and 5-HT synthesis resulting in an increase in circulating
  5-HT levels. Binding of 5-HT to osteoblastic 5-HT1B receptors resulted in a reduction
  in cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein expression contributing to a reduction
  in osteoblast proliferation and bone formation.
