caption: 'A model for Grk1-mediated photoreceptor cell death. Phototransduction pathways
  in dark, low, and intense light in model WT and Grk1+ photoreceptors are illustrated.
  In the absence of light, the light-dependent pathways including transducin-dependent
  visual signaling and Grk1-mediated deactivation are both quiescent, regardless of
  the levels of Grk1. In low light, both light-dependent pathways become stimulated
  with increased rhodopsin flow through both activation and deactivation channels.
  In this state, biased flow toward the deactivation pathway has little impact on
  photoreceptor integrity and may actually be protective. In intense light, the differential
  flow of signal through the Grk1-mediated deactivation pathway becomes a liability
  acting as a transducin-independent cell death pathway. Dashed arrows: subnormal
  flux through a pathway below that expected of the WT levels. Progressively bolder
  solid arrows: increased flux over those in the WT state.'
