caption: After photolysis, all-trans RAL is reduced to all-trans ROL by RDH in cone
  outer segment. All-trans ROL can be either transported to the RPE cells and recycled
  to 11-cis RAL via the canonical visual cycle (refer to text and ), or transported
  to Müller cells where it is enzymatically converted to 11-cis ROL. 11-cis ROL is
  transferred back to cone inner segment, and then moves along the inner segment to
  the outer segment, where it is oxidized by an unidentified RDH to 11-cis RAL for
  pigment regeneration. The key enzymes, such as RDH and Isomerase II, in this pathway
  have not been identified. The role of the retinoid binding proteins CRALBP, CRBP,
  and IRBP in the retina visual cycle still needs to be determined.
