caption: Depiction of senescence-associated alterations reported within A) hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSC) in bone marrow and peripheral blood, B) naive CD4+ T-cells in peripheral
  blood, C) senescent (CD28-) CD4+ T-cells in peripheral blood and D) senescent (CD28-)
  CD4+ T-cells in the inflamed joint of RA patients. A) In RA, bone marrow-derived
  hematopoietic stem cells (defined as CD34+) show impaired proliferative capacity
  and increased expression of Fas, rendering them apoptosis-sensitive. Consequently,
  RA patients show reduced HSC numbers at the level of the bone marrow. Peripheral
  blood-derived CD34+ HSC show similar defects in proliferation and increased susceptibility
  to apoptosis. Increased apoptosis sensitivity is via impaired ERK pathway signaling
  and/or age-inappropriate telomere erosion of CD34+ HSC in peripheral blood. B) Reduced
  thymic output in RA was evidenced by reductions of circulating recent thymic emigrants
  (defined as CD31+ or T-cell receptor excision circle (TREC)+ T-cells). This is explained
  by inadequate supply of HSC from the bone marrow and/or age-inappropriate enhanced
  thymic atrophy. Peripheral blood naive T-cells (defined as CD31+CD28+) are characterized
  by telomere shortening, increased levels of oxidized lesions and double-strand DNA
  breaks, decreased telomerase activity, deficiency of proteins involved in the DNA
  damage response (phosphorylated forms of ATM and downstream p53), overactivation
  of DNA-PKCs-JNK pathway, overexpression of proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bmf and downregulation
  of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Defects of naive CD4+ T-cells may facilitate their
  accelerated differentiation towards the senescent state, when subjected to proliferative
  stress and enhance apoptosis. C) Compensatory hyperproliferation of the naive CD4+
  T-cell pool leads to the expansion of senescent cells (characterized by the loss
  of CD28, de novo expression of NK receptors [KIR/KAR, CD56, NKG2D], upregulation
  of CD57, CD70, CX3CR1, expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α and cytotoxic molecules). Senescent
  CD4+ T-cells show further increase of DNA damage (double-strand breaks, oxidized
  DNA lesions and diminished levels of ATM and p53 phosphorylation) relative to naive
  CD4+ T-cells. Diminished activity of JNK and ERK pathways is associated with the
  increased expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and concomitant resistance
  to apoptosis of senescent CD4+ T-cells. D) Expression of CX3CR1 facilitates migration
  of senescent CD4+ T-cells towards soluble Fractalkine (FKN) abundant at the level
  of synovium. Interaction with FKN expressed on the surface of fibroblast-like synoviocytes
  (FLS) augments expression of IFN-γ, TNF-α and stimulates release of cytotoxic granules
  by senescent T-cells and enhances proliferation and FKN expression by FLS. IFN-γ
  production is also promoted by the interaction of NKG2D with FLS-expressed MIC.
  IL-12 increased at the level of inflamed joints, may restore CD28 expression by
  senescent T-cells.
