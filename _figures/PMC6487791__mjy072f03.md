caption: Therapeutic strategies targeting mutant p53. (A) Ablation of mutant p53 in
  cancer is one of the most effective strategies for developing cancer therapy. HSP90
  is highly expressed in cancer and crucial to mutant p53 stabilization. HSP90 inhibitors
  block HSP90 function and lead to MDM2- or CHIP-mediated proteasomal degradation
  of mutant p53 proteins. In addition, both Spautin-1 and MCB-613 can induce lysosomal
  degradation of mutant p53 through HSPA8/LAMP2A-mediated CMA pathway and inhibition
  of the deubiquitinase USP15, respectively. Moreover, HDAC inhibitors can suppress
  mutant p53 gene transcription. (B) Another attractive strategy is to restore the
  mutant p53 to a wild-type-resembling conformation. APR-246, COTI-2, and PK11007
  can reactivate mutant p53 and trigger the expression of wild-type p53 target genes.
  Also, APR-246 and PK11007 can kill cancer cells by elevating the ROS level and inducing
  oxidative stress. (C) The TP53 gene mutations also impose vulnerability on cancer
  cells. In response to DNA damage stress, wild-type p53-mediated G1/S arrest and
  WEE1-mediated G2/M arrest are essential for cells to repair damaged DNA. Nevertheless,
  the WEE1-mediated G2/M checkpoint renders crucial survival dependency in the mutant
  p53-sustaining cancer cells with defective G1/S checkpoint. Thus, the WEE1 inhibitor
  can cause synthetic lethality to these cancer cells by abrogating the remaining
  G2/M checkpoint. mtp53 indicates mutant p53.
