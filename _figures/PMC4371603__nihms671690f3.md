caption: 'VLDL, IDL, and LDL metabolism in plasma. Percentages indicate the percentage
  of flux of a lipoprotein species converted to another lipoprotein or cleared from
  the circulation. Width of arrows represents the amount of flux of apoB in a metabolic
  pathway. Arrows pointing up or down show flux pathways that are increased or decreased
  by dietary carbohydrate compared with unsaturated fat. +: flux pathways that are
  increased in hypertriglyceridemia −: flux pathways that are decreased in hypertriglyceridemia.'
