caption: Schematic representation of alleviation prostate cancer progression via overexpresion
  of RIP3. We have initially confirmed that RIP3 plays an important tumor suppressive
  role in prostate cancer. Overexpression of RIP3 increases phosphorylation of MLKL,
  which resulting in oligomerization of MLKL. Then MLKL oligomers insert into cell
  membranes to disrupt the intracellular membrane integrity to lead necroptotic death.
  Furthermore, RIP3 reduces the expression of cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and CDK1/CDC2,
  which regulate the conversion of G2 to M phage to lead cell cycle arrest. Thus,
  RIP3 controls the progression of prostate cancer by blocking cell cycle and promoting
  necroptosis.
