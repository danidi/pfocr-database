caption: 'Mycinamicin biosynthetic pathway (A) and organization of mycinamicin biosynthetic
  gene cluster (B). The pathway from M-I to M-II is absent in M. griseorubida because
  there is no P450 enzyme which catalyzes hydroxylation at C-14 on M-I. Oxidative
  functionalities set up by cytochrome P450 enzymes are highlighted. Color codes in
  the myc gene cluster are as follows: black, cytochrome P450 genes; gray, mycinamicin
  biosynthetic genes shown in the biosynthetic pathway; and white, deoxysugar biosynthetic
  genes and the self-resistance gene. Me, methyl.'
