caption: An overview of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway is depicted. In the
  de novo biosynthesis of ceramide, serine and palmitoyl-CoA are initially condensed
  by serine-palmitoyl transferase followed by three additional enzymatic steps involving
  a reductase, synthase, and desaturase respectively. Ceramide, thus produced, can
  be further metabolized to ceramide-1-phosphate via ceramide kinase, sphingomyelin
  via sphingomyelin synthases, and sphingosine via ceramidases. Sphingosine can be
  further converted to sphingosine-1-phosphate by the action of sphingosine kinases.
