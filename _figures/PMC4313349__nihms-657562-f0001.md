caption: A. Fatty Acid (FA) detection mechanisms by GPR40 and 120 (left) and CD36
  (right). These GPR family members are expressed in several cell types including
  entero-endocrine cells, taste buds and white adipocytes. In the enteroendocrine
  cells, binding to FAs occurs in the luminal side, and the signal is transduced via
  G protein, leading to the release of incretins into the circulation. In taste buds,
  they trigger the release of neurotransmitters; in white adipocytes, activation of
  GPR120 indirectly promotes glucose uptake. Binding of CD36 to free FAs in the oral
  taste buds triggers Ca++ release and neurotransmission; in enterocytes, it directly
  promotes FA uptake. B. Cholesterol sensing by SCAP. In the presence of cholesterol,
  the SCAP/SREBP complex binds the INSIG proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  membrane and remains anchored in the ER. When cholesterol is absent and SCAP/SREBP
  do not bind INSIG, the complex traffics to the Golgi where the cytoplasmic tail
  of SREBP gets released by proteolytic cleavage, and triggers a cholesterol synthesis
  transcriptional program at the nucleus, including the synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase
  (HMGCR). C. The enzyme HMGCR catalyzes a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis,
  and is synthesized when cholesterol levels are low. HMGCR is embedded in the ER
  membrane and also has cytoplasmic domains, which include its catalytic activity.
  In the presence of abundant intermediate species in the cholesterol biosynthetic
  pathway, HMGCR interacts with the INSIG proteins, constitutively bound to an ubiquitination
  complex. This leads to HMGCR ubiquitination and degradation and halts the synthesis
  of cholesterol in a rapid regulatory mechanism, key to the anticipation of an imminent
  increase in cholesterol levels.
