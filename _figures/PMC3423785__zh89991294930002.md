caption: 'Functional analysis of the top-scoring network of AE9a dysregulated genes.
  AE9a dysregulated genes with at least a 2-fold change (823 genes) were analyzed
  using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. A top-scoring network is shown here. The network
  consists of 35 genes, whose functions involve the regulation of hematopoiesis, cell-cycle,
  cancer, and cell death. These genes are represented as nodes with their shape indicating
  the functional class of the gene product (shown at bottom right). The biologic relationship
  between 2 nodes is represented as a line, solid being direct and dashed being indirect
  relationship (see legends at bottom left). The intensity of the node color indicates
  the degree of up (red) or down (green) regulation. Genes marked with circles are
  also target genes of ChIP-chip assays. Blue: HA only targets. Red: AML1 only targets.
  Purple: HA and AML1 common targets.'
