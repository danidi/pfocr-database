caption: 'A) The classical pathway of complement is activated when C1q binds to IgG
  clustered on endothelial HLA. Each C1q deposits multiple C4 molecules on target
  surfaces. Efficient complement regulation stops the reaction before C3 molecules
  are deposited. In contrast, complete complement activation results in covalent fixation
  of multiple C3 fragments to the target tissue. This process is augmented by the
  alternative pathway amplification loop, although several regulatory proteins control
  the alternative pathway. Complement regulatory proteins metabolize the C3b to iC3b
  and then to C3dg. B) Complete complement activation generates several biologically
  active products, including C3a, C3b, C5a, and C5b-9. Abbreviations: C4bp, C4 binding
  protein; CR1, complement receptor 1; fI, Factor I; fH, Factor H; MCP, membrane cofactor
  protein; DAF, decay accelerating factor.'
