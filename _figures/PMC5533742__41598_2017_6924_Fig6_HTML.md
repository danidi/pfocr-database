caption: Schematic image shows possible pathophysiology of FECD. High sensitivity
  to TGF-β and activation of TGF-β signaling pathway induce excessive production of
  ECM components. ECM components form clinically phenotypic features, namely Descemet’s
  membrane thickening and guttae formation. At the same time, the overload of ECM
  proteins will form unfolded protein and trigger the UPR, and the cells will undergo
  apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway. We also showed that TGF-β signaling pathway
  might be a possible therapeutic target for treatment of FECD.
