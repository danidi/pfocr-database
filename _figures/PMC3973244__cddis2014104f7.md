caption: Role of RNase L and TLR3 activation during inflammation in insulin response
  of obese people's myotubes. During obesity, chronic lipid overload triggers the
  development of global inflammation and oxidative stress, which are particularly
  deleterious for metabolic tissues such as skeletal muscle. RNase L, which is activated
  by the 2-5A synthesized by the OAS, cleaves mRNA, which in turn could activate TLR3
  pathway. This activation allows the expression of MnSOD and of numerous ISG among
  which the OAS genes. The secondary activation of the OAS induced by cleaved mRNA
  leads to increased 2-5A production that all the more activates RNase L. It then
  creates an amplification loop that induces high levels of OAS and MnSOD expression
  in myotubes from insulin-sensitive obese people. By controlling H2O2 levels, high
  expression of MnSOD allows for maintaining Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake,
  even when excessive ROS are produced. At the contrary, myotubes from obese insulin-resistant
  people express very low level of TLR3 that prevents this amplification loop to setting
  up. The consecutive underexpression of OAS and MnSOD is thus responsible for oxidative
  stress development and inhibition of insulin response. IR, insulin receptor; MyD88,
  myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88
