caption: The Wnt/β-Catenin pathway is important in development and in the maintenance
  and proliferation of epithelial stem cells. In this review, we propose a model wherein
  Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), most likely through the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
  modulates the expression of MPC1 and MPC2 to alter the cellular metabolic program.
  This metabolic program then profoundly impacts cell fate, perhaps through feedback
  regulation on the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway itself. Targets of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway
  are also up-regulated in response to fatty acids, possibly through PPARδ-driven
  gene expression.Potential mechanisms underlying the effects of metabolic program
  on gene expression and stemness are depicted. Differential redox balance in the
  cytosol and mitochondria is influenced by the flux of glycolysis, lactate production,
  pyruvate oxidation and fatty acid oxidation. Redox balance could act through various
  pathways to modulate gene expression related to stem cell homeostasis. Finally,
  MPC inhibition also could impair differentiation through epigenetic modifications
  as MPC deletion decreased H3K4, H3K9 and H3K27 histone acetylation marks. This observation
  could be explained by a depleted cytosolic acetyl-CoA pool through the reduction
  of its precursor, citrate, as a result of limited mitochondrial pyruvate. Transporters
  and enzymes are shown in rounded boxes; transcriptional regulation is depicted by
  blue arrows; possible relationships are shown in dashed lines; metabolites and histone
  modifications are shown in regular type.
