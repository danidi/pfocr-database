caption: After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), membrane proteins are
  sorted into vesicles by the coatomer protein complex-II (COPII) machinery and delivered
  to the Golgi complex by vesicle-tethering and SNARE machineries. Intra-Golgi transport
  and retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER are regulated by the COPI machinery.
  At the trans-Golgi network (TGN), proteins are sorted into vesicles by intrinsic
  sorting motifs and cytoplasmic adaptor complexes, and are transported along cytoskeletal
  elements to the plasma membrane. Protein delivery to the plasma membrane is mediated
  by vesicle-tethering and SNARE machineries. Some proteins (for example, ligand–receptor
  complexes) are internalized through another set of adaptors and delivered to an
  endosome (E), from which they might be recycled back to the plasma membrane.
