caption: Different DNA repair mechanisms. A) Inter-strand cross links during replication
  is repaired by Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway. Cross links induced stalled forks are
  recognized by FANCM-FAAP23-MHF ½ complex which then recruits FA core complex with
  E3 ligase activity that mono-ubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI. Mono-ubiquitination
  of FANCD2 and FANCI facilitates their localization to the damaged site, which in
  turn recruits nucleases (XPF, MUS81, and SLX1) to remove the cross link that results
  in DSB. DSB is then finally fixed by homologues repair. B) Unrepaired damages are
  sometimes bypassed by translesion synthesis during replication to avoid stalled
  forks. Upon experiencing adducts during replication, RAD6/RAD18 ubiquitin complex
  is recruited to the stalled fork site, which mono-ubiquitinates PCNA. Mono-ubiquitinated
  PCNA then undergoes confirmation change that facilitates the recruitment of low
  fidelity polymerase eta, which bypasses the damaged DNA. After bypassing, normal
  high fidelity DNA polymerase replaces the polymerase eta to continue replication.
