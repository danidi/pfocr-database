caption: On the left part of the figure, the activated JAK2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation
  of STAT5a is also depicted. Constitutive signaling by JAK2V617F promotes phosphorylation
  of STAT5 at the key Y694 residues; activated STAT5 monomers dimerize and translocate
  to the nucleus functioning as transcription factor for target genes. Ruxolitinib
  causes de-phosphorylation of Y694 on STAT5a, but leaves untouched the S731 and S193
  residues of STAT5b that are essential for full activity of STAT5. STAT5b serine
  residues are targeted by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. Cells with the JAK2V617F mutation
  express abnormally increased levels of the phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor CIP2A,
  that resulted down-regulated by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors via a microcircuit that includes
  SNAI1 and miR375. The JAK2/PI3K-pathway cross-talk described in this work, converging
  on unique phosphorylation targets on STAT5, contributes to the understanding of
  the pathophysiology of MPN and offers the rationale for combination therapies centered
  on a more effective inhibition of activated STAT5.
