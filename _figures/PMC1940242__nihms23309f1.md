caption: 'Alterations in intermediary metabolism during the high-fat, low-carbohydrate
  ketogenic diet that lead to the formation of ketone bodies. The ketogenic diet provides
  high levels of long chain fatty acids and is deficient in carbohydrates so that
  glucose availability is severely limited. The demand to maintain serum glucose causes
  oxaloacetate to be shunted from the Krebs cycle to the pathway for gluconeogenesis,
  a multistep process that is the reverse of glycolysis. As a result of diminished
  oxaloacetate, the Krebs cycle has reduced capacity to handle the high levels of
  acetyl-CoA generated from fat. Instead, acetyl-CoA is converted to the ketone body
  acetoacetate which spontaneously degrades to acetone. Acetoacetate also is converted
  enzymatically to β-hydroxybutyrate in a reversible reaction catalyzed by the NADH-dependent
  mitochondrial enzyme β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. Ketone bodies represent alternative
  energy substrates for the brain. Not all Krebs cycle intermediates are shown in
  the schematic. Abbreviations: CAT, carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase; LCFA, long
  chain fatty acids; MCT, monocarboxylic acid transporter.'
