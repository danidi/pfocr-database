caption: Bi-modular scheme for the biosynthesis of polybrominated marine natural products
  by the bmp pathway []. (A) Chorismate (4) converted to (5) by chorismate lyase (CL)
  Bmp6 and further to (6) and (7) by flavin-dependent halogenase Bmp5. The CYP coupling
  (C) enzyme Bmp7 generates different polybrominated biphenyls via the proposed steps
  in (B*), such as (8)–(11). Bromopyrroles are derived from L-proline, its acylation
  to the ACP domain (TE-ACP) of Bmp1 by proline adenyltransferase. (A) Bmp4 initiates
  its oxidation by the flavin-dependent dehydrogenase (DH) Bmp3. Followed by tribromination
  by the flavin-dependent halogenase (Hal) Bmp2. The TE domain of Bmp1 catalyzes the
  offloading of a carboxylic acid intermediate, which is decarboxylated (D) by carboxymuconolactone
  decarboxylase homolog Bmp8 to (14). (14) can be dimerized by Bmp7 to generate (15)
  and (18), or with (6) to generate heterodimers such as (16) and (17). (B*) Proposed
  steps for radical generation, rearrangement and coupling of (6) by Bmp7 to generate
  biphenyls and OH-BDEs. Adapted and modified from [].
