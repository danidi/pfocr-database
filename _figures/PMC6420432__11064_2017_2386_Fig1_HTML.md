caption: Adenine nucleotide metabolism and synthesis via the purine salvage pathway.
  ATP breakdown results in the production of adenosine (ADO) and other metabolites
  that can be lost from the brain via equilibrative nucleoside transporters (light
  grey spheres) into the blood. The purine salvage pathway restores adenine nucleotide
  levels via HPRT (hypoxanthine to IMP) and APRT (adenine to AMP). These reactions
  require PRPP, a product of the pentose phosphate pathway from which ribose-5-phosphate
  emerges. Ribose-5-phosphate can be formed directly from d-ribose by ribokinase (10),
  or via isomerisation of inosine (INO)-derived ribose-1-phosphate (14), thereby increasing
  PRPP levels. Adenine and d-ribose feed into the salvage pathway and increase tissue
  ATP levels via adenylate kinase-mediated phosphorylation of AMP and thence to ATP
  (3). AMP can also be formed from adenosine via adenosine kinase (5). Allopurinol
  (Allo), following its conversion to oxypurinol (8), prevents the breakdown of hypoxanthine
  (HX) to xanthine (X), and from xanthine to uric acid (U). Uric acid has its own
  bidirectional transporter (dark grey sphere). Creatine can buffer the decline in
  ATP levels via creatine kinase-catalysed substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP

  description: Adenine nucleotide metabolism and synthesis via the purine salvage
    pathway. ATP breakdown results in the production of adenosine (ADO) and other
