caption: Summary diagram showing the role of TLR4 signaling pathway in the microglia
  activation induced by maternal LPS exposure leading to ASD-like behavior of offspring.
  TLR4-deficient mice can protect against ASD-like behavior of offspring by maternal
  LPS exposure through inhibiting the M1 type polarization and abnormal synaptic pruning
  of microglia.
