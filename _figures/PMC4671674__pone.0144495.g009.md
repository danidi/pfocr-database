caption: High glucose was used to simulate hyperglycemia in vivo. Hyperglycemia obviously
  upregulates phosphorylation of JNK and ERK, and the activated forms of these two
  MAPKs cause accumulation of intracellular ROS, resulting in impairment of cell migration.
  bFGF treatment of cells incubated in high-glucose media indirectly inhibits the
  abnormal activation of MAPKs via its signaling pathway, reducing the accumulation
  of ROS and preventing the delay in cell migration.
