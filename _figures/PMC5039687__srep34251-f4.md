caption: Glutamine (Gln) is a major N and C source from which N is removed via hydrolysis
  (glutaminase ❶) and the urea cycle (❷). These reactions are both fractionating against
  15N thereby yielding 15N-depleted urea and arginine (Arg). Therefore, build-up and
  recycling rather than excretion of Arg (dotted arrow) tend to deplete cancer cells
  of 15N. Cells are also 13C-enriched due to the fixation of bicarbonate by carbamoyl-phosphate
  (CP) synthesis (to feed the urea cycle ❸) and the anaplerotic pathway (❹), as well
  as a lower 13C content in non-structural lipids (dotted arrow). Lipids that are
  13C-depleted come from the natural 13C-depletion in acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) (inherited
  from naturally 13C-depleted C-atom positions in glucose) and the isotope effect
  of pyruvate dehydrogenase (❺). Amine acceptors are denoted as ‘A’ and oxaloacetate
  (OAA) converted to aspartate (Asp) is provided as an example. 2OG, 2-oxoglutarate;
  Pyr, pyruvate; Lact, lactate. The potential contribution of respiration (CO2 loss)
  and lactate excretion to the natural 13C-abundance is described in .
