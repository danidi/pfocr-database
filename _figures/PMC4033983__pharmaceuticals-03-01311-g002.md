caption: ATM and ATR signaling pathways. DNA DSBs generally activate ATM, which along
  with the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 complex, can facilitate DNA repair or phosphorylate the
  Chk2 kinase leading to activation of p53 followed by G1 arrest or apoptosis. Alternatively,
  extensive regions of single-stranded DNA that result from the continued activity
  of helicases after replication forks are stalled (see ) activate the ATR pathway.
  ATR, together with the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 complex can activate Chk1. Chk1 in turn phosphorylates
  Cdc25A and Cdc25C, which targets the former for degradation and the latter for sequestration,
  causing the cells to arrest in S or G2. Chk1 activation can also facilitate DNA
  repair.
