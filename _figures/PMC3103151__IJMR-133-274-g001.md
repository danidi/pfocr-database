caption: Intracellular pathway of folate metabolism with highlighted critical pathways
  of methotrexate (MTX) entry, effect and efflux. Folate enters cell as methyl tetrahydrofolate
  (MTHF) through a folate carrier receptor system and is converted into tetrahydrofolate
  (THF). MTHF is the co-substrate for production of methionine (from homocysteine)
  and polyamines. Inside cell, folates as polyglutamates (PG) create an inter-convertible
  pool (ICP) which promotes several reactions with 1-carbon fragments wherein methyl
  and formyl groups are donated (primarily by serine to glycine) and this leads to
  various nucleic acid/nucleotide biosynthesis. All 1-carbon transfer reactions regenerate
  THF. The exception to the latter is production of dihdrofolate (DHF) from folate
  substrate while converting deoxyuridylate (dUMP) to dTMP. An important enzyme dihydrofolate
  reductase (DHFR) converts DHF to THF which is the essential active form of folate
  in the ICP. Several drugs, including MTX block DHFR to produce a relative state
  of intracellular folate deficiency while the tissues are rich in folates. MTX is
  a competitive inhibitor of DHFR and enters the cell through reduced folate carrier
  (RFC) active transport system. MTX forms PG intracellularly by the enzyme folylpolygluatamate
  synthase (FPGS); another enzyme gamma glutamyl hydrolase (GGH) reverses this process
  to cause MTX efflux from the cell. The PG forms retain MTX inside the cell as MTXPG
  and is responsible for its several effects besides inhibiting DHFR, (i) it inhibits
  thymidylate synthetase (TS) which converts deoxyuridylate (dUMP) to dTMP in the
  de novo pyrimidine pathway, (ii) though not a direct target of MTX, methylenetetrahydrofoate
  reductase (MTHFR) to an important enzyme in the folic acid pathway which is influenced
  by the MTX effects on the intracellular folate pool, (iii) it affects purine synthesis
  pathways by inhibiting 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltranferase
  (ATIC) to cause intracellular accumulation of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide
  (AICAR). AICAR inhibits adenosine deaminase (ADA) and AMP deaminase to cause intracellular
  accumulation of adenosine and related nucleotides which then get dephosphorylated
  to finally result in increased extracellular adenosine. Adenosine is a potent anti-inflammatory
  agent. Methionine synthase (MS) converts homocysteine (if excess can confer cardiac
  risk) to methionine required for several cellular DNA/RNA metabolism pathways. Serine
  hydroxymethyltransferase1 (SHMT1) operates on the DHF-THF pathway. ATP-binding cassette
  (ABC) family (7 distinct families A-G) of transporter proteins are responsible for
  MTX efflux from the cell. Multidrug resistant protein1 (MDR1), an active transporter
  system, is related to the ABC system in expelling several organic anions including
  MTX from the cell.
