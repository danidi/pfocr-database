caption: 'Oxidative stress-induced JNK1/2 activation and ER stress. Maternal diabetes-induced
  oxidative stress causes ER stress by aggravating UPR events in ER. ER stress activates
  UPR sensors IRE1α and PERK by phosphorylation. Activated IRE1α leads to XBP1 splicing
  and ASK1-JNK1/2 signaling pathway, whereas phospho-PERK activates eIF2α and CHOP,
  which both finally induce apoptosis and diabetic embryopathy. Activated JNK1/2 can
  reversely intensify ER stress. 4-PBA blocks ER stress and ER stress-induced apoptosis
  and NTD formation. *p-: phosphorylated-;  : phosphorylation.'
