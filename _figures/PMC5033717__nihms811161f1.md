caption: Notch signaling is initiated by physical ligand receptor interaction, which
  induces a cleavage at site S2 mediated by ADAM family proteinases followed by a
  cleavage at S3 within the transmembrane domain mediated by the γ-secretase complex.
  These proteolytic cleavages allow the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) to translocate
  into the nucleus. In the nucleus, NICD associates with a transcription factor, RBP-Jκ,
  and activates transcription from the RBP-Jκ DNA binding site. Among five mammalian
  Notch ligands, the function of Dll3 remains relatively unclear. Co-A, co-activator;
  Co-R, co-repressor; MAML, Mastermind-like 1.
