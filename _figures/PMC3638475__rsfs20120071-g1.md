caption: Diagram of model 2. (1) refers to compartment 1, the extra cellular body
  water compartment of 15 l. (2) is the neuronal intracellular compartment (0.001
  l). Detailed descriptions of parameters and values used are given in the electronic
  supplementary material. I refers to a Mg.ATP non-competitive inhibitor of TrkA kinase
  and is assumed to be in rapid equilibrium between the compartments. The grey box
  labelled model 1 indicates that the components of model 1 are included in compartment
  2.
