caption: Illustration of the possibilities to target and alter the expression level
  of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). a Nuclear localised lncRNAs can be targeted by
  chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) resulting in RNAseH-dependent
  degradation. b Antisense oligonucleotides or small-molecule inhibitors can be used
  to inhibit the lncRNA-RNA-binding protein interactions. c Long non-coding RNA expression
  can be modulated via steric blocking of the promoter or by using genome-editing
  techniques such as CRISPR/Cas9 [–]. d Up-regulation of lncRNA expression can be
  mediated by knock-down of the relevant corresponding natural antisense transcripts
  (NATs). e Long non-coding RNAs present in the cytoplasm can be degraded with small
  interfering RNA (siRNA)-based strategies involving the multiprotein complex RISC,
  RNAse dicer and endonuclease Argonaut2-dependent degradation pathway
