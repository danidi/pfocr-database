caption: NRs and cytokines signaling. Various stimulus, such as LPS, TNF-α, and IL-1β,
  activate NF-κB signaling pathway and p65-p50 binds to the promoter of downstream
  genes in immune cells or IECs, leading to proinflammatory cytokines production,
  barrier damage, and IEC apoptosis. NRs blocked the binding of the p65-p50 complex
  to the promoter and improved the damage effects induced by various stimulus.
