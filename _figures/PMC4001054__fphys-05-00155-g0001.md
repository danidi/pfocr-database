caption: Proposed schematic models for the role of different lncRNAs (green) in neural
  development. (A) LncRNA Dlx1AS consists of two exons that are spliced and the mature
  transcript is polyadenylated. During neuronal differentiation of adult SVZ NSCs,
  Dlx1AS is required for the induction of Dlx1 and Dlx2 (red) gene expression (Gonzales-Roybal
  and Lim, ; Ramos et al., ). (B) During neocortical neurogenesis, utNgn1 receive
  Wnt signals (i.e., Wnt3a) to induce the expression of Neurog1 (red). PcG protein-mediated
  mechanisms (i.e., Ring1B, H3K27me3, H3K4me3, H3K9/K14ac) lead to the suppression
  of utNgn1 (Onoguchi et al., ). (C) The overlapping regions of Nkx2.2AS and Nkx2.2
  isoforms (I and II-red) are necessary to promote Nkx2.2 mRNA levels and the subsequent
  oligodendrocytic differentiation of NSCs (Tochitani and Hayashizaki, ). (D) Mechanistic
  pathway for Evf2-dependent interactions crucial for forebrain development. Secreted
  Shh (Sonic hedgehog) promotes expression of Dlx1 and Dlx2 (red), which sequentially
  suppress Neuropilin2 and Notch signaling. Activation of Evf2 leads to the formation
  of a regulatory network together with Dlx's (red) and MECP2 (methyl CpG binding
  protein 2) that controls GAD67 and GABAergic-interneuron formation (Bond et al.,
  ). NSC, neural stem cell; Evf1 (lncRNA) (blue), Embryonic ventral forebrain-1, Dlx6
  antisense RNA 1 (Dlx6AS1).
