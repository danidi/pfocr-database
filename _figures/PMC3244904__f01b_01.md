  fatty acids produced by the pathways shown in  can enter three possible reactions.
  First, they can be elongated by an additional cycle of fatty acid synthesis. In
  these cases, KAS Il is used during the conversion of 16:0 to 18:0. Alternatively,
  C16:0 can enter the prokaryotic glycerolipid pathway as shown in . Finally, 16:0-ACP
  can be hydrolyzed by FATB thioesterase to release free fatty acids that are exported
  from the plastid. Most 18:0-ACP produced by elongation is desaturated by the stearoyl-ACP
  desaturase. The resulting 18:1-ACP can either enter the prokaryotic glycerolipid
  pathway () or be hydrolyzed by FATA for export from the plastid.Abbreviations: ABCAT,
