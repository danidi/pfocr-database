caption: Several signaling pathways converge to drive actin polarization. Rho1 and
  -2, the regulators of the CWI signaling pathway, influence actin through the Bni1
  (and probably Bnr1) formin protein as well as through the Pkc1-activated MAP kinase
  cascade. Rho3 and -4 and Cdc42 drive actin polarization through Bni1 and Bnr1. The
  Pkh1/2 protein kinases are activated by phytosphingosine (PHS) and contribute to
  actin polarization in at least two ways—activation of Pkc1 and of Ypk1/2. Ypk2 (and
  presumably Ypk1) also require phosphorylation by Tor2 to be active. The action of
  the PI4P 5-kinase Mss4 at the plasma membrane generates PI4,5P2, which recruits
  both the Rho1 GEF Rom2 and the Slm1/2 proteins to the plasma membrane through their
  PH domains. Slm1 and -2 must also be phosphorylated by Tor2 plasma membrane association.
  Their role in actin polarization is not understood, but they may represent a node
  for the integration of signals from Mss4 and Tor2.
