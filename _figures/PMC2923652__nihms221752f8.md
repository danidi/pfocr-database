caption: DNA damage and possibly cell cycle stimulatory signals trigger the translocation
  of Casein Kinase I from the cytoplasm, where it resides in non-stressed conditions,
  into the nucleus. This results in enhanced interaction between CKIδ and Mdm2, and
  subsequently multisite phosphorylation of Mdm2 by CKIδ. Phosphorylation of these
  multiple suboptimal degron sequences function combinatorially to facilitate Mdm2
  recognition and destruction by the SCFβ-TRCPpathway, thereby setting up a switch
  for Mdm2 destruction in response to DNA damage and during the cell cycle. Inactivation
  of either β-TRCP or CKI results in accumulation of Mdm2 and decreased p53 activity,
  thus perturbing the proper establishment of the p53 stress response and subsequently
  facilitates tumor progression.
