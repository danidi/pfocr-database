caption: Proposed schematic depicting the different outcomes of NHEJ factors in β-cells
  after DNA damage. We propose that pancreatic β-cells incur DNA damage from endogenous
  stress. However, strong DNA repair machineries, including NHEJ, actively repair
  this damage. In the absence of NHEJ, DNA damage accumulates, and in p53R172P mice,
  the unrepaired DNA damage activates p53-p21 and drives cells into senescence. This
  is demonstrated in the Lig4−/−p53P/P mice. The Ku70−/−p53P/P mice, however, are
  different because Ku70 has a function in addition to its role in NHEJ. We propose
  that Ku70 inhibits cell proliferation possibly through limiting the β-catenin/Wnt
  signaling pathway in the presence of DNA damage. Therefore, Ku70 deficiency leads
  to a complicated phenotype. It resembles Lig4 deficiency in the accumulation of
  DNA damage, but it lacks an important cell cycle break in some cells that leads
  to proliferation, which rescues the diabetes phenotype.
