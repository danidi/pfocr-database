caption: 'DSB end resection and repair pathway. After DSB formation, Ku binds to the
  DSBs and promotes the classic NHEJ pathway. NHEJ generally cause small deletions.
  The MRX-Sae2 complex initiates the resection and Exo1 extends the resection to expose
  longer 3′ ssDNA that is bound by RPA to prevent degradation. MMEJ and SSA are two
  alternative end-joining pathways, both of them can result in deletion or translocation.
  In the homologous recombination pathway, the 3′ ssDNA is coated with Rad51 and invades
  the homologous template to form a D-Loop. DNA synthesis is represented by an arrow
  and newly synthesized DNA by a broken line. Homologous recombination leads to multiple
  outcomes (non-crossover, crossover, gene conversion, and translocation) depending
  on what templates were used and in which way the D-Loop was processed. Abbreviations:
  NHEJ, Nonhomologous end joining; MRX, Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex; RPA, replication
  protein A; MMEJ, microhomology-mediated end joining; SSA, single strand annealing;
  SDSA, synthesis-dependent strand annealing; DSBR, double-strand break repair; BIR,
  break-induced replication; MIR, multi-invasion-induced rearrangement.'
