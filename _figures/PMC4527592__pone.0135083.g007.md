caption: Cisplatin induced mitochondrial dysfunction through mitochondrial reactive
  oxygen species (mROS) that also interfered with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  and mitochondrial stability by inhibiting the expression of enzymes and proteins
  essential for energy-producing pathways and the viability of mitochondria, respectively.
  Furthermore, the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) due to mROS
  led to blockade of the electron-transport chain (ETC). On the other hand, mROS increased
  the transcription and activation of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which suppressed
  glycolysis and, ultimately, reduced the pyruvate level. Activated p53 also stimulated
  the generation of mROS, which had a synergistic effect on the functions of both,
  p53 and mROS. Reduction of pyruvate decreased TCA cycle functionality, which was
  already impaired by mROS. Therefore, cellular energy needs would not be met. Altogether,
  these changes result in the activation of apoptotic and necrotic pathways.
