caption: Regulation of aldosterone biosynthesis in normal and pathological conditions.
  (A) Under resting conditions, zona glomerulosa cells exhibit a strongly negative
  membrane potential (−80 mV) due to the expression of a large number of potassium
  channels. (B) Stimulation of aldosterone biosynthesis by AngII. The binding of AngII
  to the AngII type I receptor (AT1R) induces a cascade of events leading to the zona
  glomerulosa cell depolarization and the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration.
  The inhibition of potassium channels and Na+, K+-ATPase by AngII results in zona
  glomerulosa cell depolarization, opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and increase
  of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Furthermore, activation of AT1R leads also
  to the increase of inositol triphosphate formation and consequently to the release
  of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum. Activation of the calcium signaling pathway
  triggers a phosphorylation cascade, involving calmodulin and calmodulin-dependent
  kinase I/IV, leading to the activation of specific transcription factors that bind
  to the promoter region and positively regulate the transcription of CYP11B2 leading
  to an increase in aldosterone biosynthesis. (C) Genetic alterations in KCNJ5 (coding
  for the potassium channel GIRK4) and ATP1A1 (encoding the α1 subunit of the Na+,
  K+-ATPase) genes lead to cell membrane depolarization triggering opening of voltage-gated
  Ca2+ channels and consequently positive regulation of CYP11B2. (D) Genetic alterations
  in ATP2B3 (coding for the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase, PMCA3) and CACNA1D (encoding
  the Cav1.3 subunit of the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel) genes lead directly
  to the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration by affecting calcium recycling
  and influx, resulting in positive regulation of CYP11B2.
