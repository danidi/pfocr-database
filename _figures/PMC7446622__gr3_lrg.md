caption: 'Mechanism of hypercoagulation in COVID-19 patients following SARS-CoV-2
  infection.During systemic inflammation, circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines can
  activate and triggers the expression of tissue factor (TF) on the circulating monocytes
  and endothelial cells. Exposed TF form complex with circulating factor VII (TF-VII
  complex) and initiate the coagulation pathways by triggering the downstream process.
  TF-VII complex also activates the platelets via the PAR signalling pathway and helps
  in binding on the endothelial cells via von Willebrand factor-aIIb/b3receptors interaction,
  resulting in platelets aggregation. Neutrophils also bind with the activated endothelial
  and release the neutrophil extracellular trap, which activates the coagulation cascade,
  binds with the platelets, and further enhances the coagulation pathway. Activated
  endothelial cells also synthesize and express monocyte chemoattractant and cell
  adhesion molecules. Activated monocyte recruited on the endothelial, release pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and monocyte–derived microvesicles, which further provoke the coagulation
  process.DAMPs: Death- associated molecular pattern; PAMPs: Pathogen-associated molecular
  pattern; TLR4: Toll like receptor 4; Nf-κB: Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells; IL-6: Interleukin 6; PAR: Protease-activated receptor; PSGL:
