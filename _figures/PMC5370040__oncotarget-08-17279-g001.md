caption: Exosomes are derived from the endocytic pathway and are released by exocytosis.
  Thus, exosomes encapsulate a unique, cell-specific ‘signature’ of the cellular environment.
  In cancer, exosomes facilitate the development of a metastatic niche by compromising
  the cellular matrix of the target tissue and making it more susceptible to invasion
  by tumour cells.
