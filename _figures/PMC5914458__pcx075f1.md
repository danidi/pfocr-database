caption: 'The Arabidopsis flavonoid pathway for the synthesis of anthocyanins and
  oxidized tannins, or proanthocyanidins (PAs). The large brackets indicate the late
  biosynthetic genes (LBGs) directly regulated by the MBW complex: on the left is
  the anthocyanin-specific MBW complex; on the right is the PA-specific MBW complex.
  The small bracket on the right indicates the narrow subset of LBGs encoding the
  transport steps regulated by TTG2. Dashed lines indicate multiple steps. Depicted
  on the left is a wild-type seedling expressing purplish red anthocyanins in the
  hypocotyl and parts of the cotyledons early in Arabidopsis development. Depicted
  on the right are Arabidopsis wild-type dry seed showing the brownish orange PA pigments
  expressed in the seed coat.'
