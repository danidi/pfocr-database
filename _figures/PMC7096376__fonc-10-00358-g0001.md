caption: Intra/extra NAD interconnections and NAD-metabolizing enzymes. Schematic
  representation of the network of NAD-metabolizing cell surface and intracellular
  enzymes and their products. Several NAD precursors derived from diet can be internalized
  to generate iNAD, via NBE activities, to support energy metabolism, signaling, and
  other biological processes through the activities of intracellular NAD-consuming
  enzymes (PARPs and Sirtuins). These enzymes release Nam that, in turn, via NAMPT-dependent
  salvage pathway, support NAD production. Once in the extracellular space because
  of secretion/leakage, via Cx43, or because of direct extracellular synthesis from
  precursors (not confirmed), eNAD can function by binding purinergic receptors (P2Y,
  P2X), an event that leads to intracellular signaling and inflammatory conditions.
  Alternatively, eNAD can also be metabolized by a series of ecto-enzymes of the cell
  surface (CD38/CD157, ARTs, CD73, ENPP1) generating different metabolites (cADPR,
  ADPR, and NAADP) involved mainly in Ca2+-signaling. The end product of the reaction,
  adenosine, can modify signal transduction by acting on P1 purinergic receptors,
  generally leading to immunosuppression. In the square brackets are indicated the
  range of iNAD [200–500 μM] or eNAD [100–500 nM]. Trp, tryptophan; Nam, nicotinamide;
  NR, nicotinamide riboside; Na, nicotinic acid; NBEs, NAD-biosynthetic enzymes; NAMPT,
  nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; ARTs, mono adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose
  transferases; PARPs, poly ADP-ribose polymerases; Cx43, connexin 43; ADPR, ADP ribose;
  cADPR, cyclic ADP ribose; NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; ADO, adenosine; ENPP1, ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases.
