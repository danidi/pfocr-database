caption: At the maternal-fetal interface, DSC-derived RANKL enhances the accumulation
  of dγδ T cells by upregulating cell-adhesion molecule expression on DSCs and γδ
  T cells, and promotes the polarization of dγδ T cells into Foxp3+regulatory cells
  possibly by activating NF-κB pathway and inducing TGF-β1 production in early pregnancy.
  Also, TGF-β1 may directly inhibit the cytotoxicity and activity of effector cells,
  including promotes the conversion of CD16+ NK cells into CD16− NK cells, downregulates
  the expression level of CD80/CD86 on macrophages, and limits IL-17 production in
  helper T (Th)17 cells as well as T-bet expression and IFN-γ production in Th1 cells,
  which further contributes to maternal-fetal immune tolerance for the establishment
  and militainment of normal pregnancy
