caption: Model for the AKAP-Lbc·p38α activation complex. AKAP-Lbc assembles a signaling
  complex that includes the scaffolding protein PKNα as well as MLTK, MKK3, and p38α.
  The AKAP-Lbc signaling complex is activated in response to α1-AR stimulation through
  a Gα12-mediated signaling pathway (). Activated AKAP-Lbc promotes the formation
  of RhoA-GTP, which, in turn, induces the activation of a signaling cascade that
  includes PKNα, MLTK, MKK3, and p38α. The recruitment of 14-3-3 inhibits AKAP-Lbc
  Rho-GEF activity (), impairs the interaction between PKNα and AKAP-Lbc, and reduces
  p38 activation.
