caption: Genes in red are significantly overexpressed and in blue underexpressed by
  Lb17 attacked flies in at least one of three treatment comparisons (Lb17 versus
  control, Lb17 + Lh14 versus control, or Lb17 versus Lh14) at one of the two early
  time points post infection (2–5 or 9–12 h). Dashed arrows represent presumed pathway
  interactions. Horizontal lines represent cell and nuclear membranes; genes inside
  the nucleus are targets of the upstream pathway. The main Toll pathway AMP Drosomycin
  was more than 4-fold up-regulated after Lb17 attack, but this change was not significant
  due to high variance among control replicates. Of the 33 overexpressed genes represented
  in this figure, only two, PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD, were also overexpressed in the Lh14
  versus control comparison (relative to 21 in the Lb17 versus control comparison).
