caption: CAFs secrete IL-6, which binds to IL-6 receptors (IL-6R) expressed on cancer
  cells. IL-6 binding to its receptor leads to activation of JAK kinase and STAT3,
  respectively. STAT3 is activated by phosphorylation at Tyr705, which induces dimerization,
  nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. This stimulates Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination
  and p53 degradation in the proteasome, thereby inhibiting upregulation of the p53
  target Bax upon treatment with doxorubicin. As a result, prostate cancer cell survival
  is enhanced.
