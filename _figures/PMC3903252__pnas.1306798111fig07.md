caption: Schematic illustration of the TGF-β/ENaC pathway in a generalized alveolar
  epithelial cell monolayer, described in this study. In healthy lungs, latent TGF-β
  is inactive, and the Na+/K+-ATPase and ENaC drive Na+ absorption, maintaining fluid
  influx and reabsorption in equilibrium, and epithelial lining fluid volume at an
  appropriate level. Activation of latent TGF-β by elastase- (), integrin- (), or
  protease-activated receptor (PAR)-dependent mechanisms () in acute lung injury has
  been described. TGF-β is implicated in chronic (gene regulatory) effects (green
  arrows), including loss of cell–cell junctions (), down-regulation of SCNN1A (),
  and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (), leading to barrier failure. TGF-β–neutralizing
  antibodies (nAb) or soluble type II receptors (sTgfbr2) reduce the deleterious effects
  of TGF-β (). We report here an acute effect of TGF-β on alveolar fluid reabsorption.
  In the unique signaling pathway delineated (dark gray arrows), TGF-β, acting through
  the type I TGF-β receptor, induces Smad2/3 phosphorylation, which activates PLD1,
  which generates PA from phosphatidylcholine (PC). PA activates PIP5K1α, which drives
  NOX4 activation, perhaps by PtdIns(4,5)P2 formation from phosphatidylinositol 4′-monophosphate
  (PI4P). Activated NOX4 generates ROS, which promote βENaC internalization that is
  dependent on Cys43, which leads to loss of Na+-absorbing capacity of the epithelial
  cell and alveolar flooding, promoting persistence of alveolar edema. The targets
  of reagents used in this study are also illustrated.
