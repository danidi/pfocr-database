caption: The thiamine-dependent enzyme transketolase is an important enzyme in the
  breakdown of glucose through a biochemical pathway called the pentose phosphate
  pathway. Glucose is first converted to a molecule called glucose-6-phosphate, which
  enters the pentose phosphate pathway where it is further modified by transketolase.
  During that reaction, two products are formed—the sugar ribose-5-phosphate and a
  molecule called reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). Ribose-5-phosphate
  is needed for the synthesis of nucleic acids, complex sugar molecules, and other
  compounds called coenzymes that are essential for the functioning of various enzymes.
  NADPH provides hydrogen atoms for chemical reactions that result in the production
  of coenzymes, steroids, fatty acids, amino acids, and neurotransmitters. In addition,
  NADPH plays an important role in the synthesis of glutathione, a compound that is
  essential to the body’s defense against damage from oxidative stress. Reduced transketolase
  activity interferes with all these essential biochemical processes.
