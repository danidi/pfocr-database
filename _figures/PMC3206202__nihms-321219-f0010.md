caption: Differential participation of GABA receptor signaling molecules in BIPM and
  MIPM.Canonical pathway diagram representing GABA receptor signaling pathways matched
  to the bicuculline induced network eligible genes (A) and mating induced network
  eligible genes (B). GABA receptor A (GABAR-A) and ubiquitin (Ub) show significant
  association with this pathway in the BIPM dataset. Glutamic decarboxylase (GAD),
  ubiquitin (Ub) and dynamin 1 (DNM1) show significant association with this pathway
  in MIPM dataset. Red color nodes represent genes that appear in the bicuculline
  or mating dataset. The intensity of red node color indicates the degree of expression.
  Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of
  the genes or gene product (diamond=enzymes, ovals=transcription factors, triangle=kinases,
  circles=others). A solid line indicates a direct interaction while a dashed line
  indicates an indirect interaction. A line without an arrowhead indicates binding.
