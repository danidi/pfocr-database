caption: Pathway Tools visualization of mixed-acid fermentation flux during aerobic
  transition. Visualization of EcoCyc–18.0–GEM flux in mixed-acid fermentation during
  a transition from anaerobic to aerobic growth, created within the EcoCyc mixed-acid
  fermentation pathway page in Pathway Tools. The upper bound of glucose uptake is
  set to 10 mmol/gCDW/hr, while the upper bound of oxygen uptake is increased from
  0 to 20 mmol/gCDW/hr in 2.5 mmol/gCDW/hr steps. Omics Popups are used to illustrate
  changes in flux to the mixed-acid fermentation products formate, acetate, and ethanol
  as the cellular energy and redox balance evolves during the aerobic transition.
