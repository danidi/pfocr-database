caption: 'This figure illustrates consequences of these interactions in lymphoid organs
  and peripheral tissues. (A) PD-L1-expressing DCs stimulate PD-1 expression on naive
  T cells. PD-L1: PD-1 interactions limit T-effector cell expansion and survival.
  (B) In the presence of TGF-β, PD-L1-expressing DCs can promote the development of
  iTregs. (C) Tregs may restrain the magnitude of the immune response by inhibiting
  both DC and effector T-cell functions. (D) Activated T effector cells migrate to
  sites of inflammation where interaction with (i) PD-1-expressing Tregs or (ii) PD-L1
  expressing target cells can (a) directly inhibit T-effector responses or may( b)
  facilitate the ‘contra-conversion’ of T effectors toward iTregs within the target
  organ. Additional cell types expressing PD-L1 such as the vascular endothelium and
  stromal cells may also influence T-effector cells but are not depicted in this figure
  for simplicity.'
