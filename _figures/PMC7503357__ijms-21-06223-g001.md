caption: 'The nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (NO-cGMP) pathway, a regulator
  of sinusoidal tone (adapted from Schaffner []).(A):Regulation of sinusoidal tone
  in healthy livers: the activation of the NO-cGMP pathway takes place once NO is
  generated by eNOS in sinusoidal endothelial cells and diffuses into the neighboring
  hepatic stellate cells, where it binds to the enzyme sGC. The following activation
  of sGC, in turn, catalyzes the conversation of GTP to cGMP. cGMP, an intracellular
  second messenger, triggers distinct downstream signaling effects, which eventually
  exert vasodilation. As a negative feedback mechanism, rising cGMP concentrations
  initiate the activation of the enzyme PDE-5 which mediates cGMP inactivation. (B):
  Disturbed regulation of sinusoidal tone in liver cirrhosis: altered expression of
  key enzymes in the NO-cGMP pathway lead to reduced cGMP concentrations and thus
  sinusoidal constriction. (C): Effects of PDE-5 inhibitors in liver cirrhosis: application
  of PDE-5 inhibitors lead to a normalization of cGMP concentrations and thus sinusoidal
  dilation. (↑ increased expression; ↑↑ markedly increased expression; ↓ decreased
  concentration; ⊥ inhibition).'
