caption: Posttranslational redox regulation of starch biosynthesis in response to
  light and sugar signals. Light activation of starch synthesis involves posttranslational
  redox activation of AGPase in the chloroplast () and resembles the light activation
  of enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cycle and related photosynthetic processes. Photosynthetic
  electron transport leads to reduction of Fdx, and reducing equivalents are transferred
  by FTR to Trx f or m, which activate target enzymes by the reduction of regulatory
  disulfides. NTRC, containing both an NADP-Trx reductase and a Trx in a single polypeptide,
  serves as an alternate system for transferring reducing equivalents from NADPH to
  AGPase, thereby enhancing storage starch synthesis (). In the light, NTRC is mainly
  linked to photoreduced Fdx via Fdx-NADP reductase (identified with the dashed arrow)
  and complements the FTR/Trx system in activating AGPase. In the dark or under conditions
  in which light reactions are impaired, NTRC is primarily linked to sugar oxidation
  via the initial reactions of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPP) and in
  this way regulates AGPase independently of the Fdx/Trx system. Redox activation
  of AGPase is also induced by Suc, which operates in leaves in the light and in nonphotosynthetic
  tissues (; ). Tre-6-P acts an intracellular signal, linking Suc in the cytosol with
  AGPase in the plastid (; ). In the working model, an increase in Suc is sensed in
  the cytosol, leading to an increase in the level of Tre-6-P by modulating Tre-6-P
  synthase (TPS) and/or Tre-6-P phosphatase (TPP). Tre-6-P is taken up into the plastid
  and promotes NTRC- and/or FTR/Trx-dependent redox activation of AGPase by a yet
  unresolved mechanism. SnRK1 is also implicated in this Suc signaling pathway, although
  its specific role in signal transduction is not fully resolved yet (; ; ). How SnRK1
  and Tre-6-P interact in this signaling cascade is unclear and may depend on the
  tissue.
