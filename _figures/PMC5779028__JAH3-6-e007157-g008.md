caption: Local TRPV4 channel‐dependent Ca2+signaling regulates endothelium‐dependent
  vasodilation in resistance‐sized PAs. The diagram depicts TRPV4 channel‐dependent
  endothelial Ca2+signaling mechanisms in small PAs and small mesenteric arteries.,
  ,  In small PAs, TRPV4 sparklets promote eNOS activity and NO release. P2 purinergic
  receptor agonist ATP is an endogenous activator of the TRPV4‐eNOS signaling in PAs.
  Endothelium‐derived NO then causes vasodilation through the activation of SMC guanylyl
  cyclase (GC)‐protein kinase G (PKG) signaling and GC‐PKG‐independent mechanisms.
  Blue arrows indicate this pathway. NO also induces activation of endothelial GC‐PKG
  signaling, which lowers Ca2+‐dependent cooperative opening of TRPV4 channels and
  limits TRPV4‐mediated vasodilations. This pathway is indicated by red arrows. In
  small mesenteric arteries, TRPV4 Ca2+ sparklets selectively activate endothelial
  IK and SK channels, which hyperpolarize EC and SMC membranes. SMC membrane hyperpolarization
  deactivates voltage‐dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs), which results in vasodilation,
  as described earlier. EC indicates endothelial cells; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide
  synthase; NO, nitric oxide; PAs, pulmonary arteries; PKG, protein kinase G; SMC,
  smooth muscle cell; TRPV4, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4.
