caption: Activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway inhibits pro-inflammatory
  release by macrophage. (1) During ischemia, hypoxia-activating factors are released
  by injured cells and cause activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway
  to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Cardiac macrophages undergo phenotypic
  and metabolic reprogramming within a week of myocardial infarction (MI)—from high
  pro-inflammatory activity into a pro-reparative signature. (2) Acetylcholine released
  from the vagus nerve terminates in α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChR)
  expressed on macrophages, and these inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
