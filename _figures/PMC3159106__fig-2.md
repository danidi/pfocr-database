caption: TLR-mediated myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent
  and TIR domain containing adaptor inducing interferon (IFN)-β (TRIF)-dependent signaling
  pathways. Except for TLR3, other TLRs mediate cellular signaling through an MyD88-dependent
  pathway. MyD88 interacts with interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs),
  which then associates with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor
  6 (TRAF6), which activates a complex composed of transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1), TAB2, and TAB3. The complex leads
  to phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa B (IκB) kinases (IKK-α, IKK-β) and mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs). The IKK complex (IKK-α, IKK-β, and nuclear factor-kappaB
  [NF-κB] essential modulator [NEMO]) phosphorylates alpha IκB alpha (IκBα), which
  undergoes degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The released NF-κB translocates
  into the nucleus and activates expression of proinflammatory cytokine genes. Activation
  of the MAPK signaling pathway is responsible for activation of the transcription
  factor complex (AP-1), which stimulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokine
  genes. The TRIF-dependent pathway mediates the activation of both IFN regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB signaling pathways. Stimulation of TLR3 and TLR4 activates
  the transcription factor IRF3 and subsequent induction of IFN-β and IFN-inducible
  genes. TLR3 directly recruits TRIF. TRIF interacts with the IKK-related kinases,
  TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and
  IKK-i, which leads to IRF3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding.
  Stimulation of TLR4 requires TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM) adaptor protein
  for activating TRIF. TRIF-dependent signaling also activates the NF-κB pathway.
  TRIF recruits TRAF6 and activates TAK1, which in turn activates the NF-κB and MAPK
  pathways.
