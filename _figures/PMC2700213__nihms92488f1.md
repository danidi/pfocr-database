caption: Induction of POMC/α-MSH activates the MC1R, inducing cAMP production in melanocyte.
  This elevated signaling leads to eumelanin production, resulting in the maturation
  of the pheomelanosome to the eumelanosome. Attractin (ATRN) is a low-affinity receptor
  for agouti signaling protein (ASIP), an antagonist of MC1R. Some proteins, such
  as TYR, TYRP1, P-protein, SLC24A5, and MATP, are involved in inducing melanization
  of pheomelanosome or eumelanosome, as described in the text.
