caption: Under ER stress, ATF6 promotes the transcription of XBP1 gene, and the transcript
  XBP1u mRNA is spliced by IRE1α to produce XBP1s mRNA. PERK induces ATF4 translation,
  which induces IRE1α expression (in this paper). Increased IRE1α protein improves
  the efficiency of XBP1 mRNA splicing (in this paper). In other words, PERK increases
  the ratio of XBP1s to XBP1u, whereas ATF6 increases the sum of XBP1u and XBP1s.
