caption: T-cell polarisation in COVID-19IL-33 released from virus-damaged cells might
  induce dysregulated GATA3+Foxp3+ Tregs and promote IL-2 production by dendritic
  cells, resulting in further expansion of Tregs. IL-33 might also elicit differentiation
  of ILC2, with TGFβ enhancing ST2 expression on these cells and facilitating production
  of IL-9. IL-9 in turn stimulates expansion of effector memory Vγ9Vδ2+ T cells with
  mixed Th1 and Th17 profiles that express CXCR3 and are recruited to the lungs by
  CXCL9 and CXCL10. IL-9 possibly induces its own transcription factor PU.1 and thus
  act in an autocrine and paracrine manner (along with TGFβ) to drive proliferation
  and survival of ILC2 and γδ T cells. Additional positive loops might be fed by IFNγ,
  which triggers production of CXCL9 and CXCL10 by macrophages. In severe forms of
  COVID-19, IL-33, along with IL-2 and IL-7 released by dendritic cells, might further
  stimulate T-cell expansion through STAT5 and induce production of large amounts
  of GM-CSF by γδ and T helper cells. At advanced stages of disease, aberrant activation
  of the MyD88-related NF-κB pathway and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome might
  induce virus-exposed cells and infiltrating monocytes–macrophages to overproduce
  IL-1β, IL-23, and IL-6. IL-1β, IL-23, IL-6, and IL-7 act on STAT3 and RORC, thus
  promoting differentiation of CCR2+ T cells that are recruited to the lungs by CCL2
  and CCL8 into γδT17 and Th17 cells producing IL-17 and GM-CSF. In turn, GM-CSF might
  further recruit and activate proinflammatory monocytes–macrophages. CCR=C-C motif
