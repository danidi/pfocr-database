caption: The combination of β-ODAP and over-activating AMPA receptors triggers the
  signaling cascade of reactions with intracellular Ca2+ flow. Meanwhile, increased
  expression level of β1 integrin on the cell surface will substantially induce the
  phosphorylation level of FAK and overexpression of paxillin. This will cause massive
  aggregation of FA units on cell actin filaments, seriously interfere the assembly
  of cell microfilaments, and ultimately result in structural damage of the cells.
