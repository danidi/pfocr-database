caption: PN1 disrupts reduces SHH expression, leading to reduction of downstream Hh
  effectors and tumor growth. Treatment with Hh inhibitor (b) GDC-0449 blocks another
  avenue of Hh signaling leading to inhibition of SMO. The combined effect slows the
  growth of prostate metastatic cells, potentially through changes in angiogenesis.
  The PN1 arm of the pathway can be inhibited by MMP9 activity.
