caption: 'A schematic overview of the molecular network involved in VSV oncoselectivity.
  Binding of growth factors to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activates the receptor
  complex, which in turn recruits and activates PI3K. Activated PI3K converts PIP2
  to PIP3, which subsequently mediates the phosphorylation of AKT. Tumor suppressor
  PTEN negatively regulates the pathway by removing the 3-phosphate from PIP3, converting
  it back to PIP2. PTEN is crucial for the activation of IRF3, its import into the
  nucleus and production of IFN-β. Loss of PTEN leads to over-activation of AKT and
  subsequently mTOR, which is associated with uncontrolled cell growth, proliferation,
  and survival. PTEN loss leads also to the development of cancer stem cells (CSCs)
  and an impaired cellular responses to viral infection. Up-regulation of LDLR in
  ovarian carcinomas enables VSV to enter cells with altered PTEN function through
  LDLR. Abbreviations: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  (4,5)-bisphosphate); PIP3, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate); AKT, serine/threonine
  kinase; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor-3; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  LDLR, low-density lipoprotein receptor. See text for further details.'
