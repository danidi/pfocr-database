caption: Scheme of the flavonoid pathway leading to synthesis of anthocyanins and
  PA polymers. Leucocyanidin is a precursor to synthesis of anthocyanins such as cyanidin-3-glucoside
  but also contributes the extension subunits of the PA polymer. LAR catalyzes reduction
  of leucocyanidin to catechin and ANR (BANYULS) catalyzes reduction of cyanidin to
  epicatechin, both of which can form the terminal unit of the PA polymer. FLS, Flavonol
  synthase.
