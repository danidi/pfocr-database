caption: Reelin signaling pathway in the developing cortex. The Reelin protein binds
  to very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and apolipoprotein E receptor 2
  (ApoER2). Then, Dab1 is phosphorylated by the Src-family tyrosine kinases (SFKs).
  Phosphorylated Dab1 recruits downstream molecules such as Crk/CrkL, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) and Nckβ. CrkL binds to C3G, an effector protein. C3G promotes the
  formation of Rap1-GTP, which activates cell adhesion molecules, including α5β1 integrin
  and N-cadherin. There are also Dab1-PI3K-mTOR, Dab1-PI3K-cofilin and Dab1-Nckβ pathways,
  which regulate the actin cytoskeleton relevant to dendrite formation and neuronal
  migration in the developing cortex.
