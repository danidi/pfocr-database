caption: 'Summary of metabolic engineering performed to increase fatty alcohol production
  in S. cerevisiae. Heterologous genes expressed (shown in blue), native genes overexpressed

  in gray. Cofactors are noted in particularly salient positions but are omitted from
  others for clarity. Note: these enzyme combinations have not necessarily been combined
  into a single production strain. Abbreviation and gene names used are: G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
