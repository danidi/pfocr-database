caption: Oxidative and nitrative signals are derived from oxidative reactions with
  oxygen or nitrogen species, resulting in the generation of both radical and non-radical
  molecules. The radicals consist of superoxide (O2), hydroxyl radicals (OH), peroxyl
  (ROO), alkoxyl radicals (RO), and nitric oxide (NO); whereas, the non-radicals consist
  of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), ozone (O3), aldehydes (HCOR),
  peroxynitrite (ONOOH), and singlet oxygen (1O2). Superoxide (O2) is the main reactive
  oxygen species produced by xanthine oxidase, the mitochondrial respiratory chain,
  and nitric oxide enzymes. Superoxide can interact directly with nitric oxide (NO)
  to form peroxynitrite (ONOO) or with membrane fatty acids to form lipid peroxidation
  products (LOOH). Superoxide can also be reduced to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by superoxide
  dismutases 1–3 (SOD1-3) or by the SOD mimetic Mn(III)-tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin
  chloride (MnTBAP). Hydrogen peroxide, which is also produced by peroxisomes, or
  NADPH oxidases, can interact with ferric iron (Fe2+) to form the highly reactive
  hydroxyl radical (OH). The hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite can both interact
  with membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids to form lipid peroxidation products. Hydrogen
  peroxide can activate autophagy through a PI3K-mediated pathway, which is inhibited
  by catalase. The relationship between hydrogen peroxide and autophagy can be complex,
  in that hydrogen peroxide can also inhibit Atg4 activity, and catalase can be degraded
  by autophagy. Hydroxyl radicals can induce lysosomal dysfunction and inhibit autophagy.
  Peroxynitrite, as well as lipid peroxidation products, such as HNE, can activate
  autophagy, which can be inhibited by Ebselen (a glutathione peroxidase mimetic),
  reduced glutathione (GSH), or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Peroxynitrite-induced autophagy
  is implicated in disruption of tight junction and decreasing VEGFR2 in endothelial
  cells. The effects of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species on autophagy are
  also complex. Nitric oxide can inhibit autophagy by decreasing phosphorylation of
  Bcl-2, decreasing Beclin initiation of autophagy, and activating of mTOR. S-nitrosocysteine
  has also been shown to induce fission and mitochondrial depletion. Nitric oxide
  also activates autophagy independent of formation of peroxynitrite.
