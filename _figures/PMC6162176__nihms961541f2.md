caption: 'Donor MHC cross-dressing of recipient APCs in transplantation. After transplantation
  of skin or heart allografts in mice, recipient APCs (mainly cDCs) resident in graft-draining
  SLOs become cross-dressed with donor intact MHC molecules, which are acquired via
  capture of clusters of donor-derived EVs with characteristic of exosomes that carry
  donor intact MHC molecules on the vesicle surface. The donor-derived EVs are released
  directly by cells from the grafts or by the relatively few donor migrating DCs that
  reach the graft-draining SLOs. The 3-cell model predicts that individual recipient
  cDCs cross-dressed with donor-derived EVs present: (i) host MHC-II molecules loaded
  with donor allo-peptides to CD4 T cells, through the indirect pathway (i.e. canonical
  pathway of Ag-presentation); and (ii) donor intact MHC molecules on the surface
  of the attached EVs to directly alloreactive CD8 T cells, via the semi-direct pathway.
  The indirect pathway CD4 T cells promotes maturation of the MHC cross-dressed recipient
  cDCs, which then stimulate the direct pathway CD8 T cells.'
