caption: Cavin-3 forms a complex with cavin-1 and caveolin and helps stabilize caveolae
  at the plasma membrane by linking them to the actin cytoskeleton via the protein
  myosin-1c. Caveolae at the plasma membrane can promote cellular growth by recruiting
  components of the ERK MAP kinase pathway and facilitating its activation by growth
  factors. ERK signalling can suppress (dashed red line) the activity of Akt, a protein
  kinase that is involved in many processes inside the cell. The loss of cavin-3 leads
  to enhanced Akt activity, which promotes cell survival and aerobic glycolysis, which
  may help explain why cavin-3 has tumour suppressor activity.
