caption: The sensing of Dengue virus by the innate immune responses and multiple evasion
  strategies to hinder the production of type I interferons (IFN).The upper panel
  shows the sensing of viral infection by RIG-I and cGAS. DENV-derived PAMPs are recognized
  by various pathogen recognition receptors like RIG-I. Upon recognition of pathogenic
  RNA, RIG-I is translocated to the mitochondria-associated MAVS adaptor protein with
  the help of the 14-3-3 and TRIM25 proteins. This induces the formation of MAVS aggregates
  that serve as an immune signalosome to activate through phosphorylation transcription
  factors IRF3 and NF-κB. In turn, these transcription factors translocate to the
  nucleus and elicit the transactivation of type I IFN. Once produced, type I IFN
  is secreted into the extracellular space and activates, in paracrine and autocrine
  fashions, the JAK-STAT pathway, leading to the amplification of the antiviral response
  via the activation of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9, a transcription factor complex known
  as ISGF3. Infection also leads to mitochondrial stress and the release of mtDNA
  into the cytosol. mtDNA is recognized by cGAS, which activates STING, leading to
  the activation of IRF3/NF-κB and IFN production. DENV has developed various countermeasures
  to evade and/or engage the RLR and cGAS/STING pathways and to hinder innate immune
  signalling. These evasion mechanisms include (1) posttranscriptional modification
  of vRNA; (2) inhibition of 14-3-3ε or TRIM25 to hinder RIG-I activation; (3) MAVS
  aggregation; (4) alterations in endomembrane architecture to disrupt the MAVS signalosome;
  (5) the inhibition of TBK1 and IKBKE kinase activation, preventing the activation
  of transcription factors like IRF3; (6) the disruption of cGAS/STING signalling;
  and (7) the dampening of ISGF3 complex activation that is required for late innate
  antiviral responses.
