caption: Figure 1. Overview of one-carbon metabolism, transsulfuration pathway, and
  glutathione influx/efflux. Folate is delivered into the cell via a receptor-mediated
  [folate receptor alpha (FRα), beta (FRβ) or gamma (FRγ)] or carrier-mediated [solute
  carrier family 19, member 1 (SLC19A1), also known as RFC1] transport mechanism and
  is subsequently reduced to dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF), which
  then enters the one-carbon metabolic pathway. THF picks up a methyl group from serine
  and is converted to 5-methyl THF (5mTHF). The methyl group of 5mTHF can be transferred
  to Hcys via methionine synthetase (MTR), generating methionine (Met) and THF. Met
  is activated to form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which serves as the methyl donor
  for the methylation of CpG dinucleotides and many other substrates, yielding the
  methylated product and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is hydrolyzed to regenerate
  Hcys. Hcys can be used to regenerate Met or be directed through the transsulfuration
  pathway via cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS). Glutathione (GSH), a product of the
  transsulfuration pathway, is a tripeptide comprised of glutamate (Glu), cysteine
  (Cys) and glycine (Gly). As the primary endogenous antioxidant, GSH donates an electron
  to reactive oxygen species (e.g., H2O2) with the enzyme glutathione peroxidase (GPx)
  and quickly reacts with another free radical GSH to form glutathione disulfide (GSSG).
  GSH can be regenerated from GSSG in a reaction catalyzed by glutathione reductase
  (GR). Under conditions of oxidative stress, CBS activity is upregulated to direct
  Hcys flux through the transsulfuration pathway for GSH production. Excess intracellular
  Hcys can also be exported extracellularly. GSH can be exported out of the cell and
  catabolized via the cell membrane enzyme γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT). GGT transfers
  the γ-glutamyl group to an amino acid, producing cysteinylglycine (Cys-Gly), which
  can be broken down to Cys and Gly via dipeptidase (DP). Cys is unstable extracellularly
  and rapidly oxidizes to cystine (CySS). The xC− antiporter can import CySS using
  a transmembrane Glu gradient, and the b0+ system can directly import CySS, which
  can be converted back to Cys to maintain the intracellular Cys pool.
