caption: Carboxylation pathways potentially available for succinate production in
  E. coli. (A) PEP carboxylase (primary fermentative route). (B) NADH-linked malic
  enzyme (gluconeogenic). (C) NADPH-linked malic enzyme (gluconeogenic). (D) PEP carboxykinase
  (gluconeogenic). Genes encoding carboxylation activities are shown in bold. The
  energy in phosphoenolpyruvate is lost in the first pathway but conserved as ATP
  in the other three pathways. Pathway D is the dominant route for carboxylation in
  our succinate-producing strains of E. coli and in succinate-producing rumen bacteria.
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; OAA, oxaloacetic acid.
