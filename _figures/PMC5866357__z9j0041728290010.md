caption: Metabolic aberrations in ECs in atherosclerosis. In atherosclerosis, ECs
  display prominent eNOS uncoupling leading to elevated ROS levels and reduced NO-mediated
  vasodilation. Underlying eNOS uncoupling are decreases in the levels of necessary
  cofactors (NADPH, CoQ10, BH4) resulting from deregulated metabolic pathways or enzyme
  activities, and methylation of the eNOS substrate arginine (ADMA). Acetyl-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme
  A; ADMA, asymmetrical dimethyl arginine; BH2, 7,8-dihydrobiopterin; BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin;
  CoQ10, coenzyme Q10; DHF, dihydrofolate; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; eNOS, endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase; FPP, farnesylpyrophosphate; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate;
  GTPCH, GTP cyclohydrolase; hCYS, homocysteine; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme
  A; HMGR, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase; MET, methionine; meTHF, 5,10-methylene-methyltetrahydrofolate; mTHF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate;
  MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate; NO, nitric oxide; NOX, NADPH oxidase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
