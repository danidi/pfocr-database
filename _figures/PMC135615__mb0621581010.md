caption: Illustration of the regulation of hypoxia-inducible genes. Under hypoxic
  conditions, the accumulation of HIF-1a was accompanied by an elevation of intercellular
  calcium. HIF-1 directly transactivates hypoxia-inducible genes. Ca activates the
  JNK/AP-1 pathway, which contributes to transactivation, and potentially may participate
  in the stabilization of the mRNA of hypoxia-inducible genes.
