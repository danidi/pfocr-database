caption: 'Outline of metabolic pathway for homocysteine. (1) Transmethylation. Conversion
  of methionine to homocysteine, thereby transferring methyl group to other species
  (R). (2) Transsulfuration. Irreversible conversion of homocysteine to cysteine:
  via rate limiting enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase, with vitamin B6 as essential
  co-factor. (3) Remethylation. Regeneration of methionine from homocysteine: catabolised
  by methionine synthase, with 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (MTHF, a form of folic
  acid) and vitamin B12, as essential co-factors. (4) Regeneration of MTHF from tetrahydrofolate
  (THF), catabolised by enzyme 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).'
