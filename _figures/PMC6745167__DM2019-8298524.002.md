caption: 'Results of network analysis: differentially regulated proteins from the
  SILAC approach are indicated in green (TCam-2) or in red (NTERA-2). Blue proteins
  represent proteins that were added from the Metacore database as potentially linked
  to the proteins from the SILAC analysis which are involved e.g. in gastrulation,
  endoderm development or formation of primary germ layer (a) and which are involved,
  e.g., in mammary gland development or fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling
  pathway (b). TR: transcription regulation; +P: phosphorylation; B: binding.'
