caption: 'Pathways Leading to Activation of NFκB. A: In the canonical pathway of activation,
  the IKK kinase complex, consisting of kinases IKKα and IKKβ, and the regulatory
  subunit IKKγ, phosphorylate IκBα on serines 32 and 36. This results in the rapid
  ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα, which unmasks nuclear localization sequences
  present on the NFκB subunits, resulting in the rapid translocation of active NFκB
  complexes into the nucleus, where they bind to κB binding sites in the promoters
  of target genes and promote gene expression or repression. B: In the noncanonical
  pathway, IKKα is activated by the NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK), resulting in the processing
  of p100 to p52, and the nuclear translocation of RelBp52 dimers, which bind to unique
  κB elements. C: IKK-independent atypical activation of NFκB (observed in response
  to hypoxia/reoxygenation, or H2O2 stimulation) can occur by means of tyrosine kinase-mediated
  phosphorylation of IκBα on tyrosine 42, and subsequent dissociation or degradation
  of IκBα.'
