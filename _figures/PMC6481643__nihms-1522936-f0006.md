caption: In this manuscript we define a novel pathway of immune regulation in the
  small intestine. This pathway is continuously required and involves MyD88- and Nod2-dependent
  microbial sensing by macrophages, production of IL-1β and induction of ILC3-derived
  IL-2 to support the maintenance of peripherally-induced intestinal Tregs. Consequently,
  this is essential to maintain immunologic homeostasis and oral tolerance, and becomes
  dysregulated in human IBD.
