caption: Production and processing of TGF-β1 in cells expressing (Tregs) or not expressing
  (other cell types) GARP. Double curves represent cell membranes, with the secretory
  pathway shown as a circle. In latent TGF-β1, the LAP is represented as thick black
  lines, and the mature TGF-β1 as green lines. Thin black lines represent disulfide
  bonds. Although not shown in this figure, in Tregs, latent TGF-β1 can also be secreted
  as a soluble form, in which it is covalently associated with GARP ().
