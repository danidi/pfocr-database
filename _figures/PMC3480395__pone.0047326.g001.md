caption: We generated the drug–metabolic subpathway network (DRSN) based on the drug-affected
  genes and pathway structure data from KEGG. First, we selected the small molecules
  which were used as drugs and then found the affected genes for each drug from corresponding
  expression profiles in CMap. Second, for each drug, we applied the “k-clique” subpathway
  identification method to identify the statistically significantly enriched subpathways
  by setting k = 3 and P-value <0.01 to obtain associations between the drugs and
  metabolic subpathways. Finally, we combined these drug–metabolic subpathway associations
  to form the DRSN.
