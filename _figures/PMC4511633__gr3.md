caption: 'Hypothetical model of insulin resistance development in response to nutrition
  overload. (A) Postprandially, adipocytes serve as sink for excess fatty acids, most
  of which is thereby stored in form of triacylglycerols. Storage of lipids requires
  marked uptake, conversion and oxidation of glucose molecules to build up the ATP
  pool (via glycolysis and OXPHOS), intermediates for fatty acid and glycerol synthesis
  (via glycolysis and TCA cycle), as well as reducing equivalents for biosynthetic
  processes (via glycolysis, TCA cycle and PPP). An increased level of serum insulin
  after a meal stimulates glucose uptake by adipocytes via GLUT4, while simultaneously
  showing a great anti-lipolytic effect. Glucose uptake further leads to draining
  of electron-driven energy from the fuel, and subsequently, results in an increase
  of reductive pressure within the cell. Enhanced ‘push force’ (NADH and FADH2) for
  the OXPHOS speeds up flux through the respiratory chain, and thus, increases ROS
  production. Leakage of the electrons from the complexes I and III of OXPHOS onto
  O2, generates O2•−, which is promptly converted to H2O2. This freely diffusible
  and notably reactive molecule, when produced in a controlled manner, may oxidize
  and thus regulate the activities of numerous enzymes (mainly by oxidizing their
  Cys residues in catalytic or regulatory sites). Due to this, H2O2 has long been
  known as an insulin-mimicking molecule, which amplifies insulin-triggered signaling
  through the cell. Besides this casually-based mitochondrial production, H2O2 is
  also generated in a strictly-controlled, intentional way by NOX4. These pathways
  of H2O2-productions are mutually interrelated, thus providing an optimal range of
  H2O2 within the cell. Also, there are some other mechanisms that prevent excessive
  production of ROS, such as AD and uncoupling that decreases the electrochemical
  gradient on the two sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, in the case
  of nutritional overload (B), all of the above-described pathways are markedly up-regulated,
  leading to a significant increase in reductive pressure, and consequently, an increase
  in oxidative pressure as well. In these conditions, the cell protects itself from
  oxidative injures by increasing antioxidant mechanisms: antioxidants, antioxidant
  enzymes, uncoupling etc. (newly established oxidative-antioxidant balance). Up to
  here, no or few pathological events occur, and thus it is still legitimate to talk
  about cell function. However, this is ‘walking on a string’ and it is a question
  of when this up-regulated metabolism will cause slipping into pathology. (C) Namely,
  persistent nutritional overload, and consequent oxidative pressure, may easily and
  at any moment, exceed the antioxidant capacity of the cell. If this happen, oxidative
  injures begin to accumulate leading to irreversible damage of proteins and other
  biomolecules, and subsequently, signaling pathways (insulin resistance), organelles
  (mitochondria) and the cell in whole. Blockage of the insulin-signaling pathway
  in adipocytes removes the anti-lipolytic effect of insulin, leading to hydrolysis
  of triacylglycerols and enhanced outflow of fatty acids from WAT, which now have
  to deposit in the liver and muscle, and may induce insulin resistance on the systemic
  level. As for the arbitrary correlation between function and dysfunction, it is
  important to note that insulin resistance may be seen as function, not dysfunction,
  of adipocytes, because in this way the cells protect themselves from excessive uptake
  and metabolism of glucose, which drives ROS generation (the last line of defense
  in the cell).'
