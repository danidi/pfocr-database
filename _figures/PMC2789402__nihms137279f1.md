caption: 'Stem cell models in the colon. (a) Normal. During the normal state, each
  crypt has rare stem cells located near the base of the crypt. Constituents of the
  surrounding microenvironment include the endothelium, stromal fibroblasts and immune
  cells, including monocytes and lymphocytes. (b) The colon stem cell in familial
  adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In this genetic or cell autonomous state, the WNT pathway
  is activated owing to a functional abnormality in the adenomatous polyposis coli
  (APC) protein. The defect in this protein permits β-catenin to translocate to the
  nucleus to activate downstream transcription factors and growth-related targets.
  This results in the generation of a large number of ‘pre-neoplastic’ colon polyps.
  (c) The colon stem cell in inflammatory bowel disease. In this state, stem cell
  self-renewal is driven by extrinsic, or cell non-autonomous, production of cytokines
  and growth factors in response to injury and subsequent regeneration and repair.
  The microenvironment, including the monocytes, lymphocytes, fibroblasts and endothelium,
  all influence the stem cells, which normally participate in tissue repair. However,
  expanded stem cells also provide targets for further carcinogenic events. Abbreviations:
  HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; γIFN, gamma interferon; Tcf/Lef, T-cell factor/lymphocyte-enhancing
  factor; TGF, transforming growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.'
