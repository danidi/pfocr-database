caption: Mechanistic pathways underlying reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages
  to liver. HDL-mediated RCT involves the removal of cholesterol from lipid-laden
  macrophages, where it may then be transported back to the liver for biliary excretion.
  In healthy individuals, nascent and mature HDL particles accept cholesterol from
  lipid-laden macrophages within the vascular wall via an interaction of ApoA-I with
  ABCA1 and ABCG1 receptors. Following their esterification by the enzyme LCAT, these
  cholesterol particles may undergo selective uptake to the liver via the interaction
  of HDL and hepatic SR-BI, or may be transferred by CETP to VLDL/LDL for hepatic
  uptake via LDL-R. In conditions of chronic disease or inflammation, numerous changes
  in this pathway have been observed that may render it dysfunctional and potentially
  increase atherosclerotic risk. These changes include the oxidation or displacement
  of ApoA-I, alterations in the activity of enzymes such as LCAT or CETP, and reduced
  binding of HDL to receptors such as ABCG1 or SR-BI
