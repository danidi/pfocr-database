caption: 'Nuclear and cytosolic pathways controlling nuclear Ca2+ homeostasis in cardiomyocytes.
  Different pathways can lead to nuclear Ca2+ signals. Pathway 1: InsP3 is generated
  by PLC either in the plasma membrane or in peri/intra-nuclear compartments. Pathway
  2: InsP3 can diffuse in and out of the nucleus. Pathway 3: InsP3 from cytosolic
  or nuclear origin triggers Ca2+ release inside and/or outside the nucleus. Pathway
  4: Ca2+ triggers Ca2+ release from RyRs in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus of cardiomyocytes
  (nuclear RyR is present only in neonatal cardiac myocytes). Pathway 5: Ca2+ diffusion
  from the cytosol can also generate nuclear Ca2+ transients and vice versa.'
