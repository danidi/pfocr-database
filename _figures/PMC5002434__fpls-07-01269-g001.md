caption: (A) Domain organization of the CrRLK1L proteins. Domains are to scale and
  based on FER as given in the NCBI Conserved Domain Database. SP, signal peptide;
  MD, malectin domain; TM, transmembrane domain. (B) Overview of CrRLK1L protein kinase
  signaling pathway components as described in the main text. RALF, rapid alkalinization
  factor; LRE/LLG, LORELEI/LRE-like GPI-AP; ROPGEF, RAC/ROP guanine exchange factor;
  ROP/RAC, Rho of plants/RAC GTPase; SAM1, 2, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase 1, 2;
  NADPHox, NADPH oxidase; ROS, reactive oxygen species. Speculative steps are represented
  by dashed lines.
