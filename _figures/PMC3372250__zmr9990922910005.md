caption: The Hsp90 folding cycle. Yeast proteins participating in the Hsp90 folding
  cycle are indicated. The complexes depicted are from known yeast protein interactions
  or inferred from in vitro reconstitution experiments with metazoan counterparts,
  as described in the text. Unfolded client proteins are indicated by the wavy blue
  line, and the native folded state is labeled. Kinase clients are thought to mature
  through a Cdc37-specific pathway (kinases), while nearly all other clients proceed
  through the multichaperone pathway (nonkinases). The cyclophilin homolog Cpr7 (also
  Cpr6 [see the text]) is a TPR domain-containing protein that competes for binding
  with other TPR cofactors, including the phosphatase Ppt1, shown by the dashed line.
