caption: 'The scheme showed the probably metabolic pathways in patient with PH2 and
  AGXT2 deficiency. The red dots indicate deficient enzymes, red dashed arrows point
  to the deficiency of metabolic pathway, thick blue arrows represent the overproduction
  of enzymes and red ends of the blue arrows point to the overproduced metabolite.
  Abbreviations: DAO – D-aminoacid oxidase; AGXT1 – alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase1;
  GO – glycolate oxidase; LD – lactate dehydrogenase; HOGA - 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate
  aldolase; AGXT2 – alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2; ABAT – aminobutyrate-2-oxoglutarate;
  MMSADH – methylmalonyl semialdehyde dehydrogenase; MMM – methylmalonyl-CoA mutase;
  GRHPR - glyoxylate reductase-hydroxypyruvate reductase; PC – propionylcarboxylase'
