caption: 'Model of reciprocal regulation between ATM and the core spliceosome When
  an elongating RNAPII encounters certain DNA lesions in the transcribed strand (such
  as UV-induced CPDs), forward translocation is blocked and the polymerase needs to
  backtrack to allow lesion access by the TC-NER system. RNAPII pausing triggers disassembly
  of U2/U5/U6 snRNP-containing spliceosomes from the pre-mRNA, as to alleviate steric
  hindrance and allow for backtracking of RNAPII and damage repair. Negative supercoiling
  behind RNAPII, in combination with the presence of spliceosome-free, intron-containing
  pre-mRNA, facilitates R-loop formation which results in non-canonical ATM activation.
  ATM signals to activate its target DDR pathways and mobilize spliceosomes from RNAPII
  located distal to the DNA lesion. ATM signaling culminates in wide-spread alternative
  splicing and gene expression changes. Key steps of the pathway are indicated and
  are as follows: 1. RNAPII pausing when CPD enters its catalytic site; 2. Spliceosome
  displacement; 3. R-loop formation and ATM activation; 4. ATM-dependent spliceosome
  displacement in-trans 5. Activation of ATM-dependent DDR pathways. (U2, U5, U6:
