caption: Summary of potential beta adrenergic signaling pathways in canine hemangiosarcoma
  and human angiosarcoma. Although several other pathways and transcription factors
  are regulated through beta adrenergic signaling, pathways currently described or
  thought to be active in hemangiosarcoma and angiosarcoma cells are presented. Norepinephrine
  and epinephrine are delivered into the tumor microenvironment through the circulation
  and potentially from local sympathetic nerve fibers. The catecholamines bind to
  β-ARs, causing Gαs-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase and the generation of
  cAMP from ATP. Intracellular cAMP activates two major biochemical signaling pathways
  (1) protein kinase A (PKA) and (2) exchange protein activated by adenylyl cyclase
  (EPAC). Activation of PKA leads to the phosphorylation of multiple protein targets,
  such as transcription factors (e.g., CREB) and the beta adrenergic receptor kinase
  (BARK). BARK recruits β-arrestin, which inhibits beta adrenergic signaling and activates
  Src kinase. Although not shown, Src kinase is known to activate other transcription
  factors (e.g., STAT3) and the downstream focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in other cancers.
  The activation of EPAC leads to the activation of the B-Raf/ mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and affects the AP1 and Ets family of transcription
  factors. In general, the transcriptional responses potentially attributed to β-AR
  activation in angiosarcomas and hemangiosarcomas include the upregulation of genes
  involved in angiogenesis and inflammation. Adapted with permission from [].
