caption: MTA metabolism pathways for sulfur (methionine) salvage (, ) in R. rubrum
  (aerobic pathway in black, anaerobic in red) and B. subtilis (aerobic pathway in
  green, shared in black/green). Under anaerobic conditions, initially R. rubrum metabolizes
  MTA (4) to MTR-1P (6) using the bifunctional MTA phosphorylase (F), whereas B. subtilis
  employs two separate enzymes (D and E) with MTR (5) as an intermediate. Subsequently,
  after formation of MTRu-1P (7) by MTR-1P isomerase (G), the pathways diverge, wherein
  B. subtilis and R. rubrum RLP catalyze separate and distinct enolase (L) () and
  isomerase (H) () reactions, respectively. The R. rubrum RLP product, MTXu-5P (8a),
  is metabolized via a cupin-like MTXu-5P sulfhydrylase (I) into MT (9) and DXP, the
  latter of which proceeds to isoprenoid biosynthesis (). In R. rubrum, under anaerobic
  conditions, RubisCO (P) catalyzes an unknown but required reaction for MTA metabolism
  that subsequently leads to the production of S-methyl-cysteine (14) and S-methyl-mercaptolactate
  (15). Compounds and enzymes involved in the pathway are designated by numerals and
  letters, respectively.
