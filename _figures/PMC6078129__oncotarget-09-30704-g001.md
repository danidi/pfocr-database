caption: 'Apoptosis is initiated via two different routes: the mitochondrial pathway
  and death receptor pathway. The mitochondrial pathway is mainly regulated by bcl-2
  protein family members. Pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins are up- and downregulated,
  leading to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent cytochrome
  c release from mitochondria. The released cytochrome c can later activate caspase
  9, which in turn activates caspase-3. The extrinsic signals are initiated by cell
  death ligands (FasL, TNF and others) and activate FADD, which subsequently cleaves
  pro-caspase-8. Cleavage of pro-caspases-8 initiates the activation of caspase-8,
  which later can directly trigger effector caspases, including caspase-3 and caspase-7.
