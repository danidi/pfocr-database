caption: (A) mTOR signalling pathway in normal cells. Nutrient availability and intracellular
  concentration of ATP are important for activation/inactivation of mTOR. Active form
  of mTOR is localized on lysosome, inhibits TFEB, autophagosome-lysosome fusion,
  regulates mitochondrial metabolism and activates UPR pathway. During nutrient-depletion,
  pH in lysosomes decreased and mTOR translocates to cytoplasm in inactive phase.
  TFEB migrates to the nucleus and activates expression of lysosomal genes. Transcription
  factor 4E-BP activates mitochondrial genes. Rapamycin inhibits mTOR activity (without
  releasing it from the lysosomal surface) and activates autophagosome-lysosome fusion.
  (B). mTOR signaling pathway in GD cells. Chronic elevation of lysosomal pH in GD
  prevents mTOR translocation to lysosomal surface and activation of the mTOR pathway.
  Moreover, lysosomal acidification obstructs autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Inhibition
  of mitochondrial metabolism leads to an imbalance in energy metabolism. Also, we
  postulate that TFEB migrates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of lysosomal
  genes and nuclear encoded mitochondrial genes. (C) mTOR signaling pathway in FD.
  In FD, α-Gal A deficiency leads to accumulation of Gb3 in lysosomes, partial inhibition
  of mTOR activity and deregulation of autophagosome-lysosome function and intracellular
  ATP balance.
