caption: CORM-2 influences IBA-1- and GFAP-positive cells and many nociceptive factors
  and signaling pathways as measured on day 7 after CCI. Our data strongly support
  the hypothesis that P2X4 receptors play a significant role in neuropathy. In the
  nervous system, they are localized on microglia/macrophages (), and we have observed
  that the elevation of levels of IBA-1- and GFAP-positive cells in the spinal cord
  and DRG after chronic constriction injury (CCI) is prevented by preemptive repeated
  administration of the P2X4 antagonist – CORM-2. Additionally, pronociceptive factors
  released by those cells in neuropathy are regulated by CORM-2 in a similar manner
  (IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, MMP-9) in the spinal cord and/or DRG. Additionally, P2X4R blockade
  also has the ability to enhance production of spinal antinociceptive factor, IL-1Ra.
  We already know from experiments using minocycline that the microglial p38MAPK pathway
  is engaged in neuropathic pain (), and here, we have shown for the first time that
  P2X4R signaling also influences this pathway by preventing the upregulation of p38
  and enhancing ERK1/2 in the spinal cord and/or DRG. In contrast, we did not detect
  any change in the NLRP3/Casp-1 inflammasome complex, which is in agreement with
  the literature (). In summary, pharmacological blockade of P2X4 receptors diminished
  pain and increased the effectiveness of opioids in neuropathy by influencing a variety
  of cell signaling pathways that are implicated in nociception. The P2X4 receptor
  can be a potential target for a new and more successful treatment for neuropathic
  pain. CORM-2,CO releasing molecule 2; DRG, dorsal root ganglia; P2X4R, P2X4 receptor;
