caption: 'The classical cGMP-dependent pathway is illustrated on the left hand side
  (sGC: soluble guanylyl cyclase; cGMP: cyclic guanylyl monophosphate; PKG: protein
  kinase G; ERK 1/2: extracellular regulated kinase 1-2). The regulatory phosphodiesterases
  (PDE''s) and phosphatases (PPases) are also illustrated. The cGMP-indpendent S-nitrosation
  pathway is shown on the right side. The denitrosating agents thioredoxin (Trx),
  thioredoxin reductase (TrxR); glutathione (GSH) and S-Nitrosoglutathione Reductase
  (GSNOR) are depicted as control for the process. Both pathways are regulated through
  the exquisite mechanisms that control eNOS. Both pathways appear to converge at
  some point(s) that modulates the adherens junctional protein complex.'
