caption: p53 pathway- In a normal cell, p53 is inactivated by its negative regulator,
  mdm2. Upon DNA damage or other stresses, various pathways will lead to the dissociation
  of the p53 and mdm2 complex. Once activated, p53 will induce a cell cycle arrest
  to allow either repair - survival of the cell or apoptosis to discard the damaged
  cell.
