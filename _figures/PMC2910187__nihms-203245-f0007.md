caption: 'Simplified schema of metabolic pathways during acute hypoglycemia in the
  developing hippocampus. Substrates that support energy metabolism via the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle during neuroglycopenia are highlighted. The figure also includes
  information on the generation of ATP, NADH or FADH2. Once glycogen, lactate and
  β-hydroxybutyrate are significantly depleted, glutamine and glutamate become the
  major sources of carbon for supporting TCA cycle. In neurons, glutamine is readily
  converted by the phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG) to glutamate, which then
  enters the TCA cycle. Glutamate generates α-ketoglutarate from two pathways: via
  aspartate aminotransferase (ATT) pathway (blue) or glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH)
  pathway (black). The former pathway produces aspartate in a stoichiometric amount.
  The latter pathway allows complete oxidation of glutamate. However, this reaction
  requires a continuous supply of pyruvate. The conversion of malate into pyruvate
  through the malic enzyme (ME) is probably the primary pyruvate recycling pathway.
  Pyruvate recycling from oxaloacetate via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)
  reaction is less likely under the compromised energy status during hypoglycemia.
  Even though GABA can support energy production by producing succinate via GABA transaminase
  (GABA-T) and succinate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSDH) reactions, the contribution
  is likely to be minor.'
