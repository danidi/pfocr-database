caption: Schematic chart showing the molecular pathway for Mg2+‐regulated endothelial
  barrier function. Extracellular Mg ion enters cells through TRPM7 and MagT1 which
  may cross activate S1P1 which, in turn, activates Akt, ERK1/2, and Rac1. Intracellular
  Mg2+signaling may lead to the increased cAMP and PKA activity which is important
  for cell survival and growth. Activated Akt and ERK1/2 will also suppress inflammation
  and apoptosis. In addition, Mg2+ suppresses the production of ROS as a nature antioxidant.
  Akt, ERK1/2 and Rac1 signaling will eventually induce cytoskeletal reorganization,
  enhanced junction protein expression and polarized distribution, leading to tightened
  endothelial barrier.
