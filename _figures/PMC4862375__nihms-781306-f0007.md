caption: Main nucleophilic reactive atoms of DNA bases for electrophilic reactive
  metabolites in SN2 reactions. Dark arrows represent the most reactive sites; thinner
  arrows represent additional reactive sites that may still lead to major nucleobase
  adducts depending on the properties of the electrophile.
