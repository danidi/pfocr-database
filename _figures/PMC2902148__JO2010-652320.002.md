caption: Inhibition of VEGF signaling pathways. Several classes of drugs have been
  developed to combat VEGF-mediated tumor angiogenesis. Monoclonal anti-VEGF antibodies
  (e.g., bevacizumab) and soluble receptor constructs (e.g., VEGF-Trap) bind to the
  VEGF and PlGF preventing their interaction and signaling through VEGFR1 and VEGFR2.
  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) inhibit the intracellular tyrosine kinase activity
  of VEGF receptors, blocking downstream signaling.
