caption: Classic view on the pathogenesis of celiac disease. Dietary gluten peptides
  increase epithelial permeability by activating zonulin signaling pathway, allowing
  gluten peptides to cross the epithelial barrier. Tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2)
  deamidates gluten peptides, making them more attractive to HLA DQ2/DQ8 positive
  antigen presenting cells (APC). Activated APC turns on HLA DQ2/DQ8 restricted CD4+
  T cell, which in turn produces cytokines to attract CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes
  (IEL) to attack the intestinal mucosa, resulting in tissue inflammation, enterocyte
  apoptosis, and villous atrophy. B cells are activated by CD4+ T cells to produce
  auto-immunity antibodies, including TTG antibodies, endomysial antibodies and gliadin
  antibodies. The role of interleukin 15 (IL 15) is essential in celiac disease pathogenesis.
  IL 15 promotes pro-inflammatory T cell response, cytolysis, and prolongs IEL survival.
