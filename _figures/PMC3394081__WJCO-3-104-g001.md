caption: 'Hypoxia induced regulation of N-Myc down-regulated gene 1 in human brain
  cancer hypoxia-inducible factor-1α induced regulation of hypoxia induced N-Myc down-regulated
  gene 1 expression in human tumour cells. A: Under normoxic oxygenation conditions
  in the tumor cell microenvironment, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α is rapidly
  degraded via the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene product (pVHL)-mediated
  ubiquitin proteasome pathway; B: When the tumor environment aeration conditions
  shifts from normoxic to hypoxic aeration conditions, HIF-1α subunit becomes stable,
  translocates into the cellular nucleus and interacts with co-activators of which
  its transcription machinery is consisted such as p300/CBP to modulate the transcriptional
  activity of numerous hypoxia inducible genes, like N-Myc down-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1)
  in the case and about 61 other hypoxia induced genes[,]. HRE: Hypoxia response element.'
