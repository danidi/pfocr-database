caption: Scheme for the bacilysocin biosynthetic pathway. The biosynthetic steps represented
  by the circled numbers 1, 2, and 3 have been well elucidated in E. coli and B. subtilis
  (for a review, see reference ) and are catalyzed by the enzymes CDP diglyceride
  synthase, phosphatidylglycerol-phosphate synthase, and phosphatidylglycerol-phosphate
  phosphatase, respectively.
