caption: (a) KAPA synthesis in an extract lacking BioA with malonyl-CoA as substrate.
  The product was detected by bioassay on the ΔbioF strain STL115. When pimeloyl-ACP
  methyl ester was added both SAM and malonyl-CoA were omitted. (b) Requirement for
  the methyl ester moiety in conversion of glutaryl-ACP to DTB. The extract lacked
  BioC and the bioassay was performed on strain ER90 (ΔbioF bioC bioD). Glutaryl-ACP
  methyl ester was added to the reactions assayed in the two left hand quadrants whereas
  the reactions of the two right hand quadrants received glutaryl-ACP. (c) The requirement
  for active BioH in conversion of pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester to DTB. The extract lacked
  BioH with pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester as the substrate and the bioassay was performed
  using strain ER90. Either purified wild type BioH or the mutant BioH S82A protein
  (which lacks the active site nucleophile) was added to 20 µg/ml. The reaction of
  the lower right quadrant lacked extract, but contained both the wild type and mutant
  BioH proteins.
