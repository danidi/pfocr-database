caption: Lck is a central node in the T cell receptor signaling pathway. (A) Following
  T cell receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex ligation, Lck phosphorylation sites (inhibitory
  Tyr505 and activatory Tyr394) regulate Lck activity. The phosphorylation of immunotyrosine-based
  activating motifs (ITAMs) by Lck induces recruitment of other kinases and leads
  to T cell activation. Phosphorylation of Lck is regulated positively by CD45 and
  negatively by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk), itself regulated by phosphoprotein associated
  with GEMs (PAG), and Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine-phosphatase
  1 (SHP-1). The regulation of phosphatases such as SHP-1 is strongly influenced by
  oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species) and the Nrf2 pathway. (B) Nrf2 quantification
  in resting and activated (anti-CD3/CD28) T cell cytoplasm in young versus older
  individuals is shown (a representative blot is shown). In addition, there are other
  regulatory mechanisms that function rapidly as negative feedback loops from the
  TCR signalosome itself []. One of these involves phosphatases, especially SHP-1
  []. Reduction of SHP-1 activity upon stimulation lowers the threshold for TCR activation.
  It seems that under weak stimulation activated Lck associates with and phosphorylates
  SHP-1, the activity of which then becomes reduced, but not sufficiently to allow
  full signaling to occur. Thus, under strong stimulation, Lck activity would increase
  or become sufficient when SHP-1 activity is reduced very early in the signaling
  cascade. In turn, when the signal weakens, SHP-1 activity increases and consequently
  downregulates Lck activity []. Many other negative feedback mechanisms are in operation
  during the early and late phases of TCR signaling [].
