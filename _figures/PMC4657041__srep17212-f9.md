caption: The miR-17-92 cluster encodes for six distinct miRNAs. Drosha executes the
  initial step of miRNA processing in the nucleus, and the resultant pre-miRNAs are
  exported to the cytoplasm where they are cleaved by Dicer to generate the final
  mature miRNAs. Up-regulation of Drosha and Dicer causes miR-17-92 overexpression,
  which drives macrosomia by inhibiting multiple negative regulators of cell cycle
  pathway that mediated the pathology of macromosia.
