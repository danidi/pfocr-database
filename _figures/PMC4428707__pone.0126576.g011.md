caption: SP-R210L mediates macropinocytosis of LPS-CD14 through interaction with Rac1
  resulting in endosomal LPS delivery to TLR-4 and downstream activation of NFκB.
  Subsequent degradation of LPS results in decrease NFκB signaling. SP-R210L-mediated
  macropinocytosis and signaling are sensitive to both EIPA and NSC23766. TLR-4 signaling
  from the cell-surface is sensitive to dynasore. Inhibition of SP-R210L expression
  results in formation of the SP-R210S-CD14-SR-A complex. Binding of LPS results in
  macropinocytosis-like internalization of the SP-R210S-CD14-SR-A complex and activation
  of a feed-forward inflammatory pathway that depends on activation of Rac1 by SR-A.
  The SP-R210S-CD14-SR-A pathway is sensitive to NSC23766 but not EIPA.
