caption: Schematic representation of the pathway of TH-mediated cell motility. Schematic
  representation of the pathway of TH-mediated cell motility. Addition of T3 (10 nM)
  to HepG2-TR α cells activates BSSP4 expression via direct binding of TR proteins
  to TRE (-609 ~ -594) of the BSSP4 promoter. P-ERK and C/EBPβ were upregulated in
  the nucleus, and VEGF was highly secreted in the medium of the BSSP4-overexpressed
  and T3-treated hepatoma cells. EMT-related proteins, such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin,
  were also influenced by BSSP4. BSSP4 and T3 exerted similar effects to promote cell
  motility via the EMT process and ERK-C/EBP β-VEGF cascade in hepatoma cells.
