caption: Schematic pathway of lipid turnover induced by Pi stress. PLDZ2 degrades
  plasma membrane and/or endoplasmic reticle phospholipids PC and PE to produce PA,
  which in turn may be converted to DAG and Pi by a proposed PAP. DAG generated via
  PLDZ2 is the precursor for the synthesis of DGDG in a DGD1-independent pathway that
  is highly regulated by Pi availability. Newly produced DGDG is transported to extraplastidic
  root cell membranes.
