caption: Clinically validated resistance mechanisms to EGFR inhibitors. Treatment
  with EGFR-targeted therapy results in tumor responses, which are blunted by the
  selection or evolution of clones with resistant EGFR (T790M or S492R), oncogenic
  shift (activation, upregulation or amplification of a bypass pathway), inhibition
  of apoptosis or histologic transformation (figure adapted from ref. ).
