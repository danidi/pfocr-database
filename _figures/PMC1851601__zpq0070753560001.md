caption: GSL biosynthetic and catabolic pathways and Galα1–3 biosynthetic enzymatic
  pathways. (a) Synthetic pathway of GSLs from ceramide with the full structures of
  the globo- and isoglobo-series GSLs. (b) Catabolic pathways of the globo- and isoglobo-series
  GSLs with the catabolic enzymes and the relevant lysosomal storage disorders highlighted.
  (c) The three different enzymes responsible for the addition of galactose in an
  α1–3 linkage are shown. R, glycoprotein or GSL.
