caption: 'Diagram of a branch of the isoflavonoid biosynthesis pathway with its related
  DEGs and DAMs. DAMs are in bold black fonts. No significantly differentially accumulated
  metabolites are in black fonts, unidentified metabolites are in gray fonts, and
  the abbreviations of gene names are in italics. The log2Foldchange was colored using
  Cluster 3.0 (red for upregulated DEGs, green for downregulated DEGs, yellow for
  upregulated DAMs, blue for downregulated DAMs), and the vertical columns represent
  R12, R36, S12, S36, RS12 and RS36, from left to right. R12: R-12h-IN vs. R-12h-CK;
  R36: R-36h-IN vs. R-36h-CK; S12: S-12h-IN vs. S-12h-CK; S36: S-36h-IN vs. S-36h-CK;
  RS12: R-12h-CK vs. S-12h-CK; and RS36: R-36h-CK vs. S-36h-CK. IN, inoculated; CK,
  control check. A color bar is in the upper right corner. Abbreviations of gene names
  are listed in Supplementary Excel .'
