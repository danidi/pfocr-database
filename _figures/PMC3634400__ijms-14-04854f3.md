caption: Flotillins are novel scaffolding proteins for the ERK/MAPK pathway. Both
  flotillins associate with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and are necessary
  for a proper activation of the receptor and its downstream MAPK signaling pathway.
  Flotillin-1, which is found in hetero-oligomers with flotillin-2, is a scaffolding
  protein for C-Raf, MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  2 (ERK2) independently of kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR1). A nuclear target gene
  of the flotillin scaffolded MAPK cascade is cyclin D1, but flotillins can also influence
  cytosolic ERK activity.
