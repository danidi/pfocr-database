caption: Role of cFP as a virulence factor while in the host and also as a signal
  to induce expression of genes to protect the pathogen. cFP produced by V. vulnificus
  suppresses the immune response of human cells by inhibiting nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB (). It also suppresses regulators responsible for the expression of ROS
  scavengers, resulting in higher intracellular ROS levels in human cells and ultimately
  leading to apoptosis (). The enhanced ROS production in human cells could cause
  damage to the cognate pathogen. However, cFP also acts as a signal to trigger a
  signal transduction pathway in the pathogen composed of ToxR-LeuO-vHUαβ. This signaling
  cascade stabilizes the mRNA of the alternate sigma factor RpoS. RpoS induces transcription
  of katG, encoding a peroxidase that detoxifies ROS, thereby protecting the pathogen.
  cFP signaling also controls the ToxR, LeuO, vHUαβ, and RpoS regulons, leading to
  modified regulation of numerous genes, which could be responsible for V. vulnificus
  pathogenesis; i.m., inner membrane; o.m., outer membrane.
