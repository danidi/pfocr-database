number: Figure 1
caption: 'Physiologic JAK-STAT signaling. The classical JAK/STAT signaling pathway
  begins with (A) recognition and binding of an extracellular cytokine by its respective
  receptor leading to (B) receptor dimerization, docking of JAK protein, JAK autophosphorylation,
  and phosphorylation of the receptor’s cytoplasmic tail. STAT proteins are then able
  to (C) bind via their SH2 domains to these activated receptors, undergoing the critical
  activating step of tyrosine phosphorylation that allows them to dimerize with other
  STAT proteins and (D) translocate to the nucleus to effect transcription of target
  genes. Abbreviations: JAK—Janus kinase; STAT—signal transducer and activator of
  transcription.'
