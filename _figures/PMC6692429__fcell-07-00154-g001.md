caption: Pathways for Nuclear factor κ B (NF-κB) signaling in the cytoplasm and the
  mitochondrion. The NF-κB tri-subunt complex (e.g., p65, p50, IκB – one possible
  combination) exists in an inactive state in the cytoplasm. NF-κB activation is initiated
  when molecules such as TNFα bind to TNF receptors (different types exist). Other
  external or internal stimuli can also activate NF-κB. A complicated signal transduction
  process then begins once TNF receptors are activated; IκB kinase (IKK) is ultimately
  triggered and leads to the phosphorylation of IκB, which results in IκB ubiquitination
  and degradation. Once IκB is degraded, the remaining NF-κB dimer (e.g., p65/p50
  or p50/p50 subunit combinations are possible) translocates to the nucleus, where
  it binds to a DNA consensus sequence of target genes. By processes not well understood,
  the NF-κB complex or NF-κB subunits can also migrate into the mitochondrion, where
  evidence suggests it/they occupies the intermembrane space. Once inside the mitochondria,
  NF-κB is thought to interact with OXPHOS genes (mitochondrial mtDNA) that leads
  to the expression of proteins involved in various functions, including mitochondrial
  dynamics and COX III regulation (component of Complex IV). Evidence also suggests,
  NF-κB can function as a switch in the mitochondria and control the balance between
  the utilization of cytoplasmic glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration in normal
  cells and in cancer. Finally, data also point to intrinsic apoptotic pathway stimulation,
  where NF-κB activation in the mitochondria leads to cytochrome c release, thus triggering
  caspase cascades and programed cell death.
