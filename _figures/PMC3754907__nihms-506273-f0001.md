  released at the basolateral surface [,], it is also possible that different populations

  description: The endosomal network and the multivesicular bodies (MVBs) pathway.
    Non-polarized cells (a) have a simpler endosomal system than polarized cells (b).
    (a) Newly synthesized proteins are transported from the trans-Golgi (TGN) network
    to the plasma membrane (green and blue arrows). Clustering of proteins into lipid
    rafts (blue) or interaction of specific motifs in the proteins with clathrin adaptors

    membrane invaginations of the EE/SE. These intralumenal vesicle-containing regions
    of the EE/SE eventually mature into late endosomes, also known as multivesicular
    bodies (LE/MVBs). Ubiquitylation of proteins and the ESCRT machinery helps to
    sort cargo into LE/MVBs and might also participate in their biogenesis [,]. Not
    all ILVs are destined for lysosomal degradation. Fusion of ILVs with the late
    endosomal limiting membrane, a process called ‘back-fusion’, is essential for
    the cytoplasmic delivery of certain proteins and viruses []. In many cells, the
    limiting membrane of LE/MVBs fuses with the plasma membrane, releasing ILVs into

    Epithelial cells have distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains separated
