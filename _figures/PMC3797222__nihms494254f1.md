caption: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in the pentose phosphate pathway. In response
  to oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase (SOD) forms H2O2 from the superoxide anion
  (O2-). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyzes the first step of the
  pentose phosphate pathway using glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), formed as a result of
  phosphorylation of glucose by hexokinase (HK), and NADP+, to produce NADPH and 6-phosphogluconate
  (6PG). NADPH acts as an electron donor in the reduction of oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG) by glutathione reductase (GR) to produce reduced glutathione (GSH). H2O2
  is reduced to water by either glutathione peroxidase (GPx) or catalase, the latter
  of which also utilizes NADPH for its enzymatic function.
