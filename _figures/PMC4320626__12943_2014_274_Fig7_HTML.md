caption: Proposed working model for the role of the NF-kB signaling pathway in the
  regulation of ethanol-enhanced the progression of HCC. (1) ROS induced by alcohol
  mediated activation of the NF-kB pathway. This effect can be abolished by C3G or
  PDTC. (2) Nuclear translocation of NF-kB via phosphorylation by the IkB kinase,
  which then binds target DNA that regulates VEGF and MCP-1 gene expression. Ultimately,
  the changes stimulated by alcohol enhance angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis.
