caption: Upstream analysis focused on transcription factors after Foxa1 knockout in
  female bladders. For this analysis, focus was placed on identifying the transcriptional
  regulators of Krt14 and Krt10 because these keratins are implicated in human bladder
  cancer and associated with Foxa1/FOXA1 inactivation in murine and human tumors.
  Upstream analysis suggested Tp63 activation of Krt14. In addition, upstream pathway
  analysis suggested that the activation of MDM2 and RBL1 may be in part responsible
  for increased expression of Krt10.
