caption: Pevonedistat synergizes with TNF-α to induce cell death. (a) Stimulation
  of the TNFR activates NF-κB pro-survival signaling. NF-κB is regulated by the degradation
  of its inhibitor IκBα through the CRL-proteasome pathway. (b) Pevonedistat is an
  inhibitor of NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE). Inhibition of NAE and thus the CRL-proteasome
  prevents the degradation of many proteins, such as CDT1 that in turn leads to DNA
  re-replication and cell cycle arrest. (c) The combination of pevonedistat and TNF-α
  kills cells through apoptosis. A pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD) prevents apoptosis
  but cells then die by necroptosis through a RIP1-RIP3-MLKL mechanism. Combined with
  Z-VAD, the RIP1 inhibitor Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) prevents cell death. Pevonedistat
  blocks NF-κB signaling and has a putative effect on an unknown aspect of pathway
  that links the TNFR to caspase-8. Solid lines indicate a direct link, whereas dashed
  lines represent multiple intermediate steps
