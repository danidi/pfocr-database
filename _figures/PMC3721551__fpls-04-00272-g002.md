caption: 'Model of the plant’s responses to mineral nutrient deficiency. (A) Response
  to nitrate and phosphorus deficiency: deficiency in nitrogen and phosphorus leads
  to reduced photosynthesis, accumulation of sugars in source leaves, increased carbon
  allocation to the roots and a higher root/shoot ratio. Moreover, phosphorus limitation
  induces an adaptation of the root system architecture: root hairs initiate and elongate,
  which increases the root surface area. AtSUC2 (green circle) is a component of the
  sugar-signaling pathway in the response to phosphorus starvation. (B) Response to
  magnesium and potassium deficiency: Mg deficiency increases the concentration of
  soluble sugars and starch in leaves and reduces leaf growth. Mg deficiency impacts
  sugar metabolism, as well as sucrose export to the roots. Mg deficiency reduces
  the Mg-ATP availability and the activity of H+-ATPase, thus reducing the driving
  force for sucrose phloem loading. AKT2/3 potassium channels affect sugar loading
  and long-distance transport by regulating the H+/sucrose transporter. Conversely,
  K+-limitation rarely results in starch accumulation. MC, mesophyll cell; CC, companion
  cell; PP, parenchyma phloem; MC, mesophyll cell.'
