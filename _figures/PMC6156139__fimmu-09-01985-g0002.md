caption: Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways of TGF-β signaling associated
  with EndMT. Transforming growth fator-β (TGF-β) signaling activates the downstream
  signal transduction cascades, Smad and non-Smad pathways. TGF-β binds the TGF-β
  type II receptor (TGF-βRII), which recruits and activates the type I TGF-β receptor.
  TGF-βRI in turn phosphorylates Smad2/3, which forms a complex with Smad 4. In addition,
  TGF-β activates Smad-independent pathways. Activation of Smad-independent TGF-β
  pathway causes phosphorylation of GSK-3β mediated by PKC-δ and c-Abl. Phosphorylation
  of GSK-3β causes its own inhibition which then allows Snail-1 to enter the nucleus.
  TGF-β/Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways upregulate the transcription
  of TGF-β target genes such as α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin and type
  I collagen, as well as the transcription factor Snail-1 involved in EndMT. EndMT
  leads to the transdifferentation of ECs into mesenchymal cells, which subsequently
  transform into myofibroblasts, therefore contributing to the progression of fibrotic
  diseases. ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, jun N-terminal kinase;
  p38 MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases; PKC-δ, protein kinase C δ; c-Abl,
  c-Abl protein kinase; GSK-3β, Glycogen synthase kinase 3β.
