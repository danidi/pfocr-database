caption: a | In the nuclei of non-proliferating cells, RB remains hypophosphorylated
  and forms RB–E2F repressor complexes to inhibit the expression of genes that promote
  S phase entry. Hypophosphorylated RB also directly binds to and inhibits the activity
  of E2F activators (E2F1–E2F3). RB is inactivated in most types of human cancer and
  this occurs through the direct mutation of RB1, located on the long arm of chromosome
  13 (13q14.3), or through a disruption in the regulatory components of the RB–E2F
  pathway. For instance, CCND1 is overexpressed or amplified in cancer, an event that
  leads to deregulated E2F function by activating cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)
  and CDK6 and by stimulating RB hyperphosphorylation. CDK4 and CDK6 are also overexpressed,
  amplified and mutated in cancers,,, leading to the loss of RB function. Many types
  of tumours exhibit decreased expression or mutations of CDK inhibitors, such as
  INK4A, p21 and p27, which normally antagonize RB phosphorylation,,. In human cancer,
  it is the prevailing view that the inactivation of RB leads to the disassembly of
  RB–E2F co-repressor complexes, lifting the repression of genes that are necessary
  for progression through the cell cycle. Furthermore, the dissociation of hyperphosphorylated
  RB from E2F activators leads to the inappropriate accumulation of free E2F1, E2F2
  and E2F3 with unmasked transactivation domains, resulting in additional transactivation
  of these genes. b | Amplification of the genomic locus 6p22 harbouring E2F3 is detected
  in more than 50% of cases of retinoblastoma,,, as well as in bladder tumours that
  have complete loss of RB function–. RB1 is mutated in more than 90% of small-cell
  lung cancer cases, many of which also exhibit overexpression of E2F1 or E2F3 ().
  The inactivation of RB in these cancers leads to increased proliferation of tumour
  cells as a result of deregulated E2F function and increased expression of classic
  E2F target genes. The additional increase in the level of E2F activators might contribute
  to the activation of genes important for tumour initiation or progression that function
  independently of cell cycle control. CoA, co-activator; CoR, co-repressor.
