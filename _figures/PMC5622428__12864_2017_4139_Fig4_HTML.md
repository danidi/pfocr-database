caption: 'Network based on a restricted number of genes after selection of topological
  parameters. a Network based on 57 genes showing a node degree superior to 11 (median
  of node degree of 111 genes-based network). b Network based on 32 genes showing
  a node degree superior to 11 and a clustering coefficient superior to 0.55 (median
  of clustering coefficient of 111 genes-based network). Blue color of edges indicated
  a physical interaction between 2 nodes. The thickness of edges was correlated with
  the score confidence (large for a high score). The node shape illustrated the specific
  PCR array: Apoptosis: square, Cancer Pathway: hexagon, Lipoprotein signaling and
  cholesterol metabolism: circles, Drug metabolism: diamond and Wnt pathway: octagon.
  The color intensity of nodes was related to transcriptome deregulation (red for
  up-regulation and green for down-regulation in CRC as compared to NT). Genes showing
  a deregulation in more than 75% of CRC were characterized by bold line of shape
  node'
