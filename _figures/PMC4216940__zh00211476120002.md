caption: The majority of mitochondrial proteins/enzymes undergo reversible lysine
  acetylation. Each protein involved in β-oxidation, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, and the electron transport chain (ETC) contain multiple acetylation residues
  in rodent and human skeletal muscle. Each metabolite of the respective mitochondrial
  pathway is identified in colored boxes; acetylated protein/enzyme regulating substrate
  oxidation is highlighted in red. ACADVL, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very long chain;
  ECHS1, enoyl-CoA dehydrogenase, short chain 1; HADHA, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  ACAA2, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase 2; NDUFV, NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) flavoprotein;
  ETFDH, electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase; UQCRB, ubiquinol-cytochrome
  c reductase-binding protein; COX4, cytochrome oxidase 4; Cytc, cytochrome c; ATP5A,
  ATP synthase subunit α; ACO, aconitase; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; αKGDH, α-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase; SCS, succinyl-CoA synthase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; FH, fumarate
  hydratase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; CS, citrate synthase. [Modified from data
  reported by Lundby et al. ().]
