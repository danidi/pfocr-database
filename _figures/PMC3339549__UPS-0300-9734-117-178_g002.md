caption: Properties of VEGF, FGF, and PDGF receptors and their signaling. Schematic
  outline of receptors is shown. All three VEGF receptors are organized into an extracellular
  domain with seven Ig-like folds and a short kinase insert. Tyrosine phosphorylation
  sites have been identified at some positions. Key features of VEGFR2 signaling are
  the binding of the adaptor molecule TSAd to the kinase insert phosphorylation site
  Y951 and regulation of Src activation followed by opening of adherens junctions.
  A C-terminal phosphorylation site at Y1175 allows binding of PLCγ and signaling
  in the Erk pathway. FGF receptors are composed of three Ig-like loops extracellularly,
  a very short kinase insert, and signaling via FRS2, which associates to the FGFR
  without involvement of tyrosine phosphorylation sites. PLCγ is an important downstream
  signal transducer in FGF biology. PDGF receptors have five extracellular Ig-like
  loops and a long kinase insert. The PDGF receptors become phosphorylated at very
  many tyrosine residues in response to ligand binding and induce formation of several
  long signaling chains. Erk = extracellular regulated kinase; FRS2 = FGF receptor
  substrate 2; P = phosphate; PLCγ = phospholipase Cγ; TSAd = T cell specific adaptor.
