caption: 'Schematic view of the TNF signaling pathway. Two pathways are activated
  downstream of liganded TNF, each required for NF-κB dependent activation. IKK mediates
  RelA translocation by phosphorylation of the IκBα inhibitor; PKAc responds to ROS
  generation to induce Ser276 phosphorylation. Phospho-Ser276 RelA is competent for
  P-TEFb association, a complex that activates IL-8 and other cytokine genes. This
  process involves RNA Pol II recruitment. By contrast, unphosphorylated RelA activates
  IκBα expression. Abbreviations: IKK, IκB kinase; TNFRI, TNF receptor-I.'
