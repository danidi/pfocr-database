caption: Signaling pathways of IL-17A, pathological effect, and potential drug targets.
  (A) Signaling transduction of IL-17A at type I epithelial cells of the alveoli of
  the lung. IL-17A and IL-17F are secreted predominantly by Th-17 cells; they are
  structurally very similar, bind the IL-17RA–IL-17RC receptor combination, and can
  form heterodimers together, signaling via the adaptor protein nuclear factor (NF)-κ
  activator (Act1). Many IL-17 target genes contain a promoter region that binds with
  NF-κB. IL-17 is not a potent inducer of inflammation by itself. Its strong effects
  during inflammation are derived from its ability to recruit immune cells via chemokine
  expression such as CXCL1, CXCL5, and MCP1, as well as from its synergistic action
  with other cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, and TNFα. Thus, IL-17, acting in synergy
  with IL-6 and TNF, is a powerful inflammatory signal that results in the rapid recruitment
  and sustained presence of neutrophils and leads to a cytokine storm. (B) Schematic
  representation of IL-17A-mediated immunopathological effect of ARDS during SARS-CoV-2
  infection. Pulmonary fibrosis is one of the pathological changes due to the activation
  of fibroblasts mediated by IL-6 and results in abnormal deposition of collagen.
  Moreover, the stimulation of fibroblasts can produce IL-8 and leads to the attraction
  of neutrophils to the site of injury. MMP3/9 (which causes tissue destruction) and
  PGE2 (increases capillary permeability) are also responsible for neutrophil infiltration,
  alveolar edema, and protein-positive (exudative) pleural effusion. Altogether, the
  proposed pathological mechanism suggests that IL-17 can mediate numerous immunopathological
  effects in CRS secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
