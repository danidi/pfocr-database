caption: Schematic representation of the regulatory interactions between inflammation
  and dystrophic muscle cells that are influenced by Klotho. Direct action of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines on muscle cells reduces Klotho expression (present investigation) which
  contributes to loss of satellite cells in aging, dystrophic muscle.
pmcid: PMC5886268
papertitle: Macrophages escape Klotho gene silencing in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne
  muscular dystrophy and promote muscle growth and increase satellite cell numbers
  through a Klotho-mediated pathway.
