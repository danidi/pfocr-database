caption: '(a) The homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway involves multiple steps:
  (1) double strand breaks (DSB) recognition by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex
  and the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase; (2) the CtIP nuclease is recruited
  to the DSB to initiate DNA end resection; (3) the replication protein A (RPA) coats
  the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions and activates the ATM RAD3-related (ATR)
  kinase; (4) the breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2) protein mediates the
  replacement of RPA by the RAD51 recombinase, which will catalyze the homology search
  and the progression of HR; (b) RB is recruited to DSB through the TopBP1-E2F1-RB
  complex, which recruits the BRG1 ATPase. BRG1 stimulates DNA end resection and HR
  by reducing the nucleosome density at the break site. In the absence of RB, there
  is no decrease in nucleosome density at the break site, which impairs DNA end resection,
  HR, and promotes genomic instability.'
