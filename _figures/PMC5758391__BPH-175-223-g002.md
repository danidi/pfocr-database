caption: Proposed mechanisms for the cardioprotective actions of PDE5 inhibitors.
  PDE5 inhibitors activate PKG by preventing the breakdown of cGMP and increasing
  the generation of NO‐driven cGMP. The NO–cGMP–PKG signalling pathway has a direct
  cardioprotective effect on the myocardium by opening mitochondrial ATP‐dependent
  potassium channels (mitoKATP) and stimulating calcium activated potassium channels
  (KCa). In addition, PDE5 inhibition promotes anti‐apoptotic and anti‐inflammatory
  effects, decreases hypertrophy, ventricular arrhythmias and myocardial fibrosis
  and also reduces oxidative stress by activating SIRT1. The NO–cGMP–PKG pathway also
  leads to beneficial cardiac effects by inducing direct vasodilator responses. Hence,
  basic science data and clinical studies suggest PDE5 inhibitors have potential as
  a treatment for myocardial IR injury and chronic HF.
