caption: Three pathways for trehalose synthesis in C. glutamicum and Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis. The otsBA pathway leads to trehalose from glucose 6-phosphate through
  UDP-glucose and trehalose 6-phosphate as intermediates. In the treYZ pathway, isomerization
  and hydrolysis of a α(1-4)glucan leads to trehalose. The synthesis of such glucans
  proceeds in a way fairly similar to the otsBA pathway, with ADP-glucose as the glucosyl
  donor. Finally, the treS pathway leads to trehalose after isomerization of maltose,
  when this sugar is available as a carbon source.
