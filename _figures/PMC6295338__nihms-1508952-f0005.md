caption: (A) The portion of the TPS yeast osmotic stress response pathway model for
  which both proteins are in the osmotic stress reference pathway. TPS correctly recovers
  the core pathway structure from the Sho1 osmosensor to the primary kinases and transcription
  factors by ordering proteins based on the phosphorylation timing. Twelve of these
  pathway interactions are supported by the KEGG high-osmolarity pathway or other
  literature (). Node and edge visualizations are as in . Note that three interactions
  (Ste50 → Pbs2, Ste50 → Ssk2, and Rck2 → Pbs2), derived from references (; ), are
  not found in other curated versions of the yeast interaction network.(B) A zoomed
  view of the TPS pathway depicting Rck2 and the proteins it is predicted to interact
  with. All four proteins predicted to be activated by Rck2—Fpk1, Pik1, Rod1, and
  YLR257W—displayed decreased phosphorylation in the RCK2 mutant strain (), as did
  predicted targets Mlf3, Sla1, and YHR131C.See also  and  and .
