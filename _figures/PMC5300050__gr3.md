caption: Apoptotic Recognition and Clearance Signaling in the FlySeveral transmembrane
  proteins have been identified that allow detection of apoptotic corpses in the fly
  (A) including Croquemort (homolog of vertebrate CD36 scavenger receptor), the CED-1
  homolog Draper, Six-microns under (Simu), and βv/αPS3 integrin heterodimers. Draper
  and Simu have been shown to bind phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of apoptotic
  cells, but how activation of any of these receptors upon binding to their ligands
  leads to the activation of Rac and the subsequent actin rearrangements required
  for engulfment remains largely unknown. In the case of Draper, activation of Rac
  could be through the Syk kinase homolog shark and in other cases will likely involve
  ELMO/Ced12 and Myoblast city. Two signaling cascades have been identified in the
  fly macrophage downstream of apoptotic engagement. The first (B) involves a calcium
  signaling pathway driven by intracellular store operated calcium entry (SOCE) downstream
  of Draper. A junctophilin (undertaker), an ER calcium sensor (Dstim), a calcium
  release activated channel (DOrai), and a TRP channel (Pkd2) are all required for
  this calcium signaling event. Again, how this calcium signaling leads to the activation
  of Rac remains unknown. The second (C) involves an F-box protein that acts as an
  E3 ubiquitin ligase called Pallbearer. This interacts with phosphorylated ribosomal
  protein S6 (RpS6) to promote its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation, which
  leads to Rac activation and subsequent actin remodeling required for engulfment.
