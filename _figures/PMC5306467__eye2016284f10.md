caption: 'Summary of the pathogenesis of inflammation and scarring in ocular MMP.
  This illustrates the description in this section in the text, for which the evidence
  is summarised in . In brief a loss of tolerance to mucosal epithelial basement membrane
  proteins results in the development of pathogenic autoreactive T cells (aT) which
  help autoreactive B cells (aB) to proliferate in the regional lymph nodes, and differentiate
  into plasma cells. The latter produce circulating IgG and IgA autoantibodies to
  the mucosal basement membrane, which are detectable in the serum of some patients
  by indirect immunofluorescence (and other antibody specific assays). Plasma cells
  are also found in the conjunctival mucosal substantia propria where they may produce
  local antibody. In the mucosal epithelium direct immunofluorescence tests may show
  the presence of IgG and/or IgA fixed to the basement membrane where C3 (complement
  3) is also identified in some patients. Activation of C3 at the basement membrane
  precipitates the complement cascade and acute inflammation at the basement membrane.
  This is the injury and inflammation phase of the disease causing an accumulation
  of inflammatory effector cells (neutrophils, dendritic cells, mast cells, eosinophils,
  macrophages and T cells) and the associated cytokines interleukin (IL) IL-2, IL-5,
  IL-13 and growth factors: IFNγ (interferon gamma, TNFα (tumour necrosis factor alpha),
  resulting in, often severe, inflammation and expansion of both T helper subset 1
  and 2 cells into a chronic inflammatory response. An alternative effector pathway
  may be more important, in the absence of autoantibody, in some subsets of patients
  whereby autoreactive T cells to basement membrane components home in on the mucosa.
  Here they can create an inflammatory response, in the absence of antibody, through
  their cytokines and growth factors including IFNγ, TNFα, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. This
  inflammatory response results in fibrosis through the effects of profibrotic mediators
  released by macrophages, T cells, mast cells and eosinophils on fibroblasts, including
  PDGF (platelet derived growth factor), IL-13, TGFβ (transforming growth factor beta)
  and HSP47 (heat shock protein). Fibrosis also results from ALDH/RA (aldehyde dehydrogenase/retinoic
  acid) mediated paracrine effects of dendritic cells that activate a profibrotic
  phenotype in fibroblasts. During both active inflammation, and once inflammation
  has resolved, the activated MMP fibroblasts continue to scar as these remain profibrotic
  because of an ALDH/RA mediated autocrine effect. The latter probably results in
  RA dependent TGFβ activation and or induction, further driving fibrosis.'
