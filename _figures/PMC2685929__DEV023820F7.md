caption: Model for regulation of chondrocyte morphogenesis by Fzd signaling.  Maturation
  of chondrocytes involves conversion from progenitor (resting) cells  that divide
  in arbitrary planes (1, multiply oriented arrows) to proliferative  chondrocytes
  that display aligned planes of cell division (2, bidirectional  arrow). Cytokinesis
  in proliferative chondrocytes results in daughter cells  that are initially displaced
  laterally relative to the column axis (3).  Subsequently, these cells intercalate
  (4) to form a single column composed of  progeny from a single progenitor cell (5).
  The canonical Fzd signaling pathway  is important for cartilage growth and chondrogenesis,
  and might play a role in  regulating the resting chondrocytes. However, the morphogenetic
  properties of  proliferative chondrocytes are regulated via a noncanonical pathway.
  At a  minimum, this pathway regulates cell polarity that is required for the proper  alignment
  of cell divisions and orientation of the cell body. It remains to be  determined
  whether these effects result from Fzd-dependent regulation of the  extracellular
  matrix or cell-matrix adhesion molecules.
