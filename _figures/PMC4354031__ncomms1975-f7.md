caption: In response to specific stimuli p100 is processed to p52 through NIK-mediated
  phosphorylation. Increase in p100 levels as a result of Fbw7 inactivation leads
  to elevated p52 production, alterations in p52/NF-κB complex formation and activity
  on stimulation. In the absence of stimuli, p100 binds to and inhibits various NF-κB
  complexes. Consequently, Fbw7-mediated regulation of p100 levels controls downstream
  transcriptional targets of both the canonical (RelA:p50) and the non-canonical (RelB:p52)
  NF-κB pathways.
