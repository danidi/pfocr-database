caption: Conceptual comparison of querying with a gene sequence or its associated
  phenotypic description. Genes are shown as white ovals. Methods of searching for
  related genes are shown as light gray boxes. Gray dashed arrows indicate the path
  from the query gene to the set of genes that are returned from the search. Solid
  black arrows indicate relationships between genes in a biological pathway or gene
  regulatory network. Dashed black arrows indicate relationships between the pathway
  or network and the resulting phenotype.
