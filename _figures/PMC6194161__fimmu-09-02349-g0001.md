caption: Involvement of TLRs and CLRs during interaction with HDPs. TLRs and CLRs
  are widely targeted by HDPs during induction of immunomodulation and hyporesponsiveness
  in APCs. HDPs not only alter the expression of TLRs and CLRs in APCs but also masterfully
  manipulate their intracellular signaling. Some HDPs are able to redirect TLR4 signaling
  toward MAPK pathway and ERK1/2 activation supporting Treg/Th2 induction. In addition,
  co-engagement of DC-SIGN along with TLR4 enables HDPs to trigger unknown intracellular
  pathways which cross-inhibit MyD88 and NFκB activation. HDPs can further restrain
  NFκB activity via DC-SIGN-mediated RAF signaling along with upregulation of negative
  regulators of TLRs signaling, such as SOCSs and PI3K. Obviously, strict inhibition
  of NFκB as the main transcription factor supporting inflammation results in prevention
  of priming Th1 cells. Other CLRs have been reported to participate in priming Treg/Th2
  cells upon stimulation by HDPs. For example, some HDPs suppress phosphorylation
  of Dectin1/2-induced Syk molecule and through which inhibit deviation of immune
  response toward Th1. On the other hand, MR and MGL upon activation by HDPs through
  an unknown mechanism support Treg/Th2 differentiation. Degrading host key intracellular
  molecules is another strategy that HDPs exploit to reprogram host immunity. Omega-1,
  ES-62, and FheCL1 by degrading host mRNA, endosomal TLR4, and TLR3, respectively,
  not only strengthen Treg/Th2 responses but also forestall anti-parasite immunity.
  NLRP3 also has been revealed to be targeted by some HDPs to modulate inflammatory
  responses. However, there has been reported that some HDPs are able to fight anti-worm
  immunity by stimulation of NLRP3 leading to release of IL-1B and Th1 amplification.
