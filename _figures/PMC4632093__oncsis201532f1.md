caption: The nodes-and-connections strategy generating an interaction map of signaling
  molecule network required for the fulvestrant-induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis. (a)
  The in silico prediction and experimental validation of proteins functionally and/or
  physically interacting with the DAPK3 protein kinase (red). The Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA) and other bioinformatics tools predicted 13 proteins regulating DAPK3
  function or being regulated by it. Among them, requirement of three protein kinases
  (DAPK1, DAPK2 and ROCK1; orange) for the fulvestrant-induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis
  was confirmed by RNAi knockdown experiments. Although requirement of two other protein
  kinases (MYL2 and MYL9; open red) was unable to be confirmed by RNAi knockdown for
  technical limitations, requirement of MYLK3 (yellow), which regulates MYL2 and MYL9,
  was experimentally validated. RNAi knockdown of the other eight proteins (white)
  did not affect the fulvestrant-induced MCF-7 cell apoptosis. (b) An intermediate
  interaction map consisting of experimentally validated primary, second-generation
  and third-generation nodes. Two primary nodes (ERBB4 and MAPK2) are not yet connected
  to any other nodes. The four primary nodes have not been connected yet. (c) The
  interaction map of signaling molecules required for the fulvestrant-induced MCF-7
  cell apoptosis. Three nodes (Myosin light chains, STAT3 and STAT5A) in this map
  were predicted by in silico analyses but not experimentally validated. All primary
  nodes are connected to each other, directly or indirectly, and the entire map is
  roughly divided into three sections—namely, SFK (Src family protein tyrosine kinase)
  signaling, DAPK signaling and other signaling molecules including BIK, TP53, MAP2Ks
  and MAPKs. Requirement of MAP2K7 and CSK (*) was also identified in an independently
  performed kinome-wide RNAi knockdown screening.
