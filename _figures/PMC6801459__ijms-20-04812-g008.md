caption: Hypothesis model of ErbB family degradation pathways in response to proteasome
  inhibitor bortezomib. The unfolding proteins are commonly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome
  pathway. However, the reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, bortezomib, blocked
  the activity of proteasome, leading to HSP90 inhibition through chaperone stress
  response. The unfolding proteins remain ubiquitinated and were degraded through
  the lysosome instead of the proteasome.
