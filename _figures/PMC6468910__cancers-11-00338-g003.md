caption: 'ER stress and chemo-resistance: Role of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic
  reticulum kinase (PERK). The anti-neoplastic drugs, possess ERS-mediated apoptosis
  and exert their anticancer effect by entering the tumor cells, using influx transporters,
  including an organic anion transporter (OAT), organic anion-transporting polypeptide
  (OATP), organic cation transporter (OCT), and a copper transporter (Ctr). On the
  other hand, ATP-dependent multidrug transporters of the carrier-mediated, ubiquitous
  superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins actively efflux chemotherapeutic
  agents out of the cell. ABC proteins include the multidrug resistance protein (MDR),
  which confer resistance to many anticancer drugs in cancer cells. The ERS-mediated
  activated PERK, phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF2α)
  and nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Activation of PERK
  via agents that trigger the ERSR, promotes a dissociation of the cytoplasmic Nrf2/Keap1,
  and the Nrf2 possess its cyto-protective activity by activating detoxifying enzyme
  systems, including the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, glutathione-S-transferases
  (GSTs), thus, reducing ROS, leading to the prevention of apoptosis in cancer cells.
  The GSTs ensure a high GSH concentration and GSH-transporters inside cancer cells,
  which are associated with a high resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. The GSH
  exhibits cancer cell resistance to anti-neoplastic treatments, either by inhibition
  of apoptosis or chemotherapeutic drug detoxification, by the GSH-drug conjugation,
  followed by efflux through the GSH-pump of MRP transporters. The activated PERK-Nrf2
  signaling, upregulates the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1), by the activation
  of antioxidant enzymes (HO-1, SOD, catalase, etc.) that neutralize the reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) and increases the drug efflux, leading to a reduction in the
  ROS levels. Nrf2 stabilization by the exposure of antioxidant enzymes, leads to
  an increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio, subsequently reducing apoptosis and increasing cell
  survival, by regulation of Topo II, p53, and its target gene p21. The PERK activity
  can induce cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP1 and cIAP2) proteins, by the activation
  of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, leading to chemotherapy
  resistance.'
