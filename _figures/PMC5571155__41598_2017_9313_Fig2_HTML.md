caption: 'The identified transformation pathway of heroin (HER) and codeine (COE)
  drug biomarkers, including abiotic and biotic processes. Posterior distribution
  of estimated parameters (histograms) for proposed methodology – Method 1 (in red),
  Method 2 (dotted blue line, upper X axis) and Method 3 (solid black line) at 4 different
  calibration levels. For Method 2 and 3, distributions are shown with linear interpolations
  between pairs of distribution data points. Abbreviations: T.P. - unknown transformation
  product (TP); A - Abiotic model, B - Biotic model. Stoichiometry and process rates
  are according to transformation pathway of HER and COE drug biomarkers and are shown
  in the Supplementary Table . Solid arrows are pathways identified from literature
  and new identified pathways are shown with dashed arrows.'
