caption: 'LPS transferring pathway and modulation of TLR4 signaling cascade. (a) TLR4-MD2
  complex and LPS recognizing: TLR4 signaling cascade is activated following LPS sensing
  mediated by three different protein activities, causing both ligand recognizing
  and transferring to receptor. The LBP-LPS complex is recognized by CD14, TLR4 co-receptor,
  leading to TLR4 cascade activation. (b) TLR4 protein adaptors and negative regulators:
  TLR4 signaling necessitates recruiting two main adaptors, including MyD88 and TRIF.
  Activation of other mediators causes the phosphorylation of some proteins which
  leads to the translocation of inflammatory transcription factors into nucleus, inducing
  effective inflammatory genes upregulation. Modulating of TLR4 is mediated by the
  negative regulator proteins in different stages (TLR4 sensing ligand, CD14, adaptor
  recruitment, transcriptional factor activation, transcriptional factor translocation,
  gene transcription) to either control the excessive response of TLR4 or suppress
  its activities at an effective time following an inflammatory response.Abbreviations:
