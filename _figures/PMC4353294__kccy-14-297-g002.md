caption: DNA damage response pathways involved in the G2 exit program leading to senescence.
  Pro-senescence stimuli activate the ATM/ATR DNA damage-signaling pathway, leading
  to stable G2 arrest that entails mitotic bypass (see also Fig. 3) and permanent
  cell cycle arrest in a tetraploid G1 phase. The early response involves Chk1/2-mediated
  inhibition of Cdc25 phosphatases, which promote mitosis by activating cyclin B1-Cdk1
  complexes (cB1/K1). In p53-deficient cells, this pathway transiently blocks G2/M
  progression, but the p53/p21 pathway is required to stabilize G2 arrest. In addition
  to inhibiting cyclin B1-Cdk1 complexes, p21 mediates premature activation of APC/C-Cdh1,
  leading to degradation of cyclin B1 and other mitotic regulators. Like in G1 arrest,
  p21 also activates pRb by blocking Cdk-mediated pRb phosphorylation. Active pRb
  inhibits the expression of genes that control G2/M progression, leading to irreversible
  G2 arrest of the cell cycle. It is proposed that p53 might induce senescence independently
  of p21 through mechanisms that are not fully clear. Like in G1 arrest, p16 stabilizes
  senescence in G2 presumably by targeting pRb kinases. However, the pathways involved
  have not been elucidated.
