caption: A model for NO signaling in immunity after natural infection of Drosophila
  larvae. Receptors, the PRRs on the surface of sentinel tissues, recognize molecules
  peculiar to pathogens. We suggest that the gut serves such a sentinel function in
  the case of natural infection, but note that other tissues such as hemocytes might
  adopt this role upon systemic infection. We propose that host-pathogen interactions
  up-regulate NOS in sentinel tissues (Fig. ; ) and activate a signaling cascade that
  leads to the release of a cytokine-like activity that recruits additional tissues
  to defend against the pathogen. We propose that hemocytes function as an intermediary
  in the Imd pathway that culminates in fat body production of antimicrobial peptides.
  It should be noted that the classical genes of the Imd pathway might act in different
  tissues or might act repeatedly at more than one tier of the cascade. As the septic
  injury model circumvents the gut as a point of entry for pathogens, it is likely
  that other tissues will act as sentinels mediating the response or the fat body
  might respond directly under these circumstances.
