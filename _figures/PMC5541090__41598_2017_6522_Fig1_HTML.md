caption: NREP, HIPK2, PRDM16, SMAD3 and their roles in the canonical TGF-β signalling
  pathway. The region-dependent accumulation of rare variants dataset was significantly
  enriched in the genes connected to the TGF-β pathway. Highlighted are the four genes
  contained in the dataset. Interactions were drawn using Pathvisio 3.2.4.
