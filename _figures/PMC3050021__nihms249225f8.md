caption: In the context of HDM2-driven p53 suppression, HDM2 inhibition triggers a
  surge in p53 levels and induces cancer cell death (A). However, if HDMX is present,
  p53 can become sequestered in p53-HDMX complexes, limiting the cellular response
  to HDM2 inhibition (B). When p53-HDMX complex levels are elevated, HDMX inhibition
  reactivates the p53 pathway and induces cell death (C). However, if cellular levels
  of p53 are low, targeting HDMX has little to no effect on cell viability (D). When
  p53 levels are suppressed by HDM2, and HDMX is also expressed, maximal reactivation
  of the p53 pathway is achieved by combined blockade of HDM2 and HDMX, which elevates
  p53 levels and blocks formation of inhibitory p53-HDMX complexes, respectively (E).
  Thus, cancer cell susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition of HDM2, HDMX, or both
  targets is determined by the respective levels and interactions of p53, HDM2, and
  HDMX.
