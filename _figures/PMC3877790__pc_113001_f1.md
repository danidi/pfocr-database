caption: Isoprenoid Biosynthesis in Plastids.The  pathway produces the universal isoprenoid
  precursors isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP).
  The production of  from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) by the enzyme  can
  be blocked with , whereas the production of  from  catalyzed by  can be inhibited
  by fosmidomycin (FSM). Condensation of IPP and DMAPP units produces prenyl diphosphates
  of increasing size, such as geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  (GGPP), which are the starting points for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid end-products.
  Dashed open arrows represent multiple biosynthetic steps.
