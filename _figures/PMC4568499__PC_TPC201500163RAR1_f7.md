caption: Model Summarizing the Findings on the Regulation of bZIP1 Transcription in
  Salt Stress Response in Arabidopsis Roots and the Crosstalk of the -Independent
  SnRK1-bZIP1 Pathway and -Dependent SnRK2-AREB Pathway.Due to the mutant and -PCR
  analysis, putative bZIP1 target genes can be classified as dependent on the ABA/SnRK2/AREB
  pathway (class 1), the SnRK1/bZIP1 pathway (class 3), or both (class 2). Class 4
  genes depend on group C, and S1 bZIPs and are independent of AREB-like . A potential
  interaction between SnRK1 and SnRK2 kinases is proposed by  and .
