caption: 'Inhibition of prostate cancer cell proliferation through statin use, and
  its impact on the HMG-CoA pathway. Three possible mechanisms are indicated: cholesterol
  mediated pathways, farnesylated protein mediated pathways and, geranylgeranylated
  protein mediated pathways. Cholesterol is presumed to act through its assembly in
  lipid rafts, thereby activating PI3K/Akt, however, it also directly affects prostate
  cancer by mediating the production of testosterone, which in the prostate is converted
  to dihydrotestos-terone, a strong ligand for the androgen receptor (AR). At the
  same time, farnesyl pyrophosphosphates can regulate PCa progression by activating
  Ras GTPases, which need farnesylation for membrane binding and activation, whereas
  they also activate Rac and Rho GTPases, which require geranylgeranylation, and regulate
  cell motility, invasion and metastasis. Statins may reduce risk of advanced/aggressive
  PCa by inhibiting one or more of these pathways.'
