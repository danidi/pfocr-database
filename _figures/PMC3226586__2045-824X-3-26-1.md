caption: A pathway regulating tumour growth i.e. cancer stem cells trigger tumour
  growth in response to hypoxic condition and releases the signal VEGF. The VEGF initiates
  the endothelial cell to proliferate and form blood vessels to vascularize the growing
  tumour. As soon as the tumour gets oxygenated, the tumour grows further in size.
