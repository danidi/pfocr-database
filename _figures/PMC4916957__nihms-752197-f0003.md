caption: Tumor cells undergo a wave of cell death in response to chemotherapy, radiation
  or immunotherapy (e.g., T cell adoptive transfer, or other immunotherapy that activates
  cytotoxic T cells, CTLs). Some of the tumor cells may die via an immunogenic pathway
  that releases pro-inflammatory mediators such as HMGB1, ATP and STING. This immunogenic
  cell death has the potential to trigger inflammation, immunogenic cross-presentation
  of tumor antigens, and robust T cell activation. However, some fraction of the tumor
  cells also likely die by classical apoptosis, with consequent induction of immunosuppressive
  pathways such as TGFβ, IDO and IDO-induced pten-Treg activation. Unless the pro-inflammatory
  signals are very strong, these immunosuppressive signals (particularly activation
  of the potent pten-Tregs) are likely to be dominant. Thus, the net outcome of tumor
  cell death is often immune suppression and tolerance. Underneath, however, the immunogenic
  cell death may still be present, and available to drive anti-tumor immune responses
  if the dominant suppression is blocked.
