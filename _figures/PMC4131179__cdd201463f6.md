caption: The TORC1 inhibitors Nprl2/3 and Tsc1/2 prevent apoptosis during amino-acid
  starvation in young egg chambers. (a) In the presence of amino acids, the TORC1
  inhibitors Nprl2/3 are inactive while the insulin pathway inhibits the activity
  of Tsc1/2. Thus, TORC1 activity is high driving anabolic metabolism and growth.
  (b) In the absence of amino acids, Nprl2/3 functions to inhibit TORC1 activity.
  Amino-acid starvation also results in reduced insulin signaling, leading to activation
  of the Tsc1/2 complex due to the reduced activity of its inhibitor Akt1. Together
  Nprl2/3 and Tsc1/2 sufficiently inhibit TORC1 activity to induce an essential stress
  response (c) In nprl2 or nprl3 knockdowns, cells fail to adequately downregulate
  TORC1 activity in response to amino-acid starvation triggering apoptosis. (d) In
  Tsc1 knockdowns, TORC1 activity also remains inappropriately high during amino-acid
  starvation triggering apoptosis
