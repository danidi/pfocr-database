caption: Benzoate degradation pathway. As depicted in the map, after benzoate uptake,
  cytoplasmic benzoate is converted to 1,6-dihydroxy-cis-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylic.
  Since oxygen is one of the reactants, lowering the flux of oxygen uptake would in
  turn decrease the flux of this reaction, and the whole pathway would be less active,
  carrying lower flux values. This map shows only a part of metabolism.
