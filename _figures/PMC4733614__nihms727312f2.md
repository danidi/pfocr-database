caption: In the cellular immune response, IFN-γ serves as a measure of T-cell activation.
  Upon initial TCR ligation, T cells secrete IFN-γ which induces PD-L1 upregulation
  on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Activated T cells highly express PD-1. The activation
  of the PD-1 signaling pathway negatively regulates effector T (Teff) cells by limiting
  cytokine secretion and proliferation, and possibly affects the retention time on
  APCs to execute cytotoxic activity. PD-L1 also can competitively bind to CD80 and
  inhibit the costimulation effect of CD28. Moreover, although controversial, PD-1
  signaling is presumed to promote the maintenance and suppressive ability of regulatory
  T (Treg) cells and thus further strengthen the inhibition of effector function.
  Additionally, reverse signaling through PD-Ls may deliver negative signals to the
  APCs.
