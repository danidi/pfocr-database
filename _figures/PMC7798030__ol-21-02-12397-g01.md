caption: p21 is regulated by multiple pathways. It was found that p21 is a key factor
  in esophageal cancer cells. Through the control of p21, the regulation of cell proliferation,
  senescence and apoptosis may be achieved. The pathway indicated by the black line
  has not been confirmed in esophageal cancer cells. The main purpose was to highlight
  the double-sidedness of p21, and this double-sidedness is often associated with
  the localization of p21 in the cell.
