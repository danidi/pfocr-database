caption: Models of VSR Traffic.(A) Selective VSR transport to the PVC. VSR transport
  to the PVC is a selective process that depends on the conserved Tyr residue in a
  canonical YXXФ motif present in all VSRs (; ; ; ; ). Moreover, this step is likely
  to occur by clathrin-mediated vesicle budding for transport to the PVC (; ; ; ).
  CCV could either bud from the Golgi, the PCR/TGN, or both. The mechanism of Golgi-to-PCR/TGN
  transport is currently unknown but may occur by maturation (m). Selective recycling
  from the PVC is thought to be mediated by the VPS35/29/26 retromer core complex
  to prevent receptor degradation in the vacuole (; ; ; ; ). This retrieval step also
  depends on sorting signals on the VSR tail (; ), leading to gradual PVC maturation
  (m) to form the LPVC (). Changes in the delimiting membrane by microautophagy could
  contribute to this maturation step via the ESCRT pathway, as interference with one
  of its components causes reduced internalization of vesicles and induced secretion
  of vacuolar cargo (; ). Further transport of soluble cargo from the LPVC to the
  vacuole is dependent on the sequential action of Rab5 and Rab7 GTPases (, ), which
  are localized to the LPVC and vacuolar membrane, respectively. The destination organelle
  for the recycling routes from the PVC and the vacuole are unknown (indicated with
  a question mark).(B) Alternative model for VSR transport. This model represents
  alternative transport pathways suggested for VSR trafficking, and individual steps
  are not mutually dependent on each other and could be combined with aspects of the
  model in (A). ER export of VSRs by a COPII-independent mechanism has been proposed
  based on the ability of an ER-retained VSR-calnexin fusion to coretain soluble cargo
  (). Localization of retromer components at the TGN led to the hypothesis that VSRs
  could be retrieved from the PCR/TGN (), whereas arrival at the PVC would be by bulk
  flow and TGN maturation (). It has also been suggested that VSR trafficking may
  involve a recycling step to and from the PCR/TGN via the plasma membrane to mediate
  endocytosis of specific cargo molecules (). The destination organelle for the COPII-independent
  VSR export pathway and the retromer-mediated recycling are unknown (indicated with
  a question mark).
