caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms of ROS-ERK pathway in urinary
  protein-induced injury in TECs. Urinary protein-induced ROS production triggers
  a cascade of phosphorylation reactions in the ERK pathway, which is a common mediator
  of protective autophagy and injury in TECs. In the early phase, cytoplasm p-ERK
  induces autophagy-associated adaptive response. Once stimulation is sustained, cytoplasm
  p-ERK transfers into the nucleus and elicits cell death.
