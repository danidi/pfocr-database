caption: 'Structure of NFκB members.Notes: The NFκB family consists of three proteins
  with a transactivation domain (RelA [p65], cRel, and RelB) and two proteins lacking
  a transactivation domain (p105/p50 and p100/p52). Similarly, only p105/p50 and p100/p52
  have ankyrin repeats that function as p52 and p50 inhibitors. However, all these
  proteins share an Rel-homology domain, associated with DNA binding, dimerization,
  nuclear localization and IκB binding, and nuclear localization signal exposure,
  which is vital to the translocation of the dimer into the nucleus.Abbreviation:
  NIK, NFκB-inducing kinase.'
