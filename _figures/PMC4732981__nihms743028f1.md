caption: The nascent apoB100 polypeptide becomes associated with lipids transferred
  by MTP during its translocation across the ER membrane. When there is an insufficient
  level of either lipid synthesis or MTP activity, much of apoB100 gets shunted to
  the ERAD/proteasome pathway. The immature VLDL particles (pre-VLDL) are transported
  in vesicles to the Golgi, where they either 1) complete their maturation to fully
  lipidated VLDL particles, or 2) VLDL particles that fail to normally mature (because
  of metabolic circumstances, such as treatment with fish oils or insulin) get shunted
  from the Golgi to autophagosomes, which eventually fuse with lysosomes as part of
  autophagy. There is yet another opportunity to “intercept” VLDL particles before
  they enter the systemic circulation- namely at the cell surface through interactions
  with either LDL receptors or HSPGs, in a re-uptake process.MTP, microsomal triglyceride
  transfer protein; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PERPP, post-ER, pre-secretory
  proteolysis; TG, triglyceride; VLDL, very low density lipoproteins.
