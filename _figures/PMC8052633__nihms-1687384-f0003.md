caption: Oxidative stress triggers DNA damage in the nucleus and mitochondria. DNA
  fragments are then released into the cytoplasm, where they induce p62-mediated selective
  autophagy through different mechanisms and the cGAS-STING-mediated DNA sensing innate
  immune pathway. The kinases ULK1 and TBK1 play dual roles in these two pathways.
  ULK1 phosphorylates both mTOR and p62 for autophagy induction as well as STING for
  downstream IFN-I immune response. TBK1 phosphorylates both STING and IRF3, as well
  as p62. In turn, p62-mediated selective autophagy impairs cGAS-STING signaling by
  selectively promoting degradation of STING and p62 (p62 promotes production of DNA
  fragments by inhibiting DNA repair), and by interacting of Beclin1 with cGAS leading
  to blockage of cGAMP synthesis.
