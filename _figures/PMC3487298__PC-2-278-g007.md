  Shared functionality of multiple targets of a given miRNA. MiRNA are capable of
  sensitively controlling pathway function via the simultaneous regulation of multiple
  genes within its signaling cascade. (B) A network biology model to help elucidate
  the indirect involvement of microRNA in pulmonary hypertension. A bipartite map
  of the predicted associations by which multiple miRNA (blue triangles, inner circle)
  may regulate a network of gene targets (circles, outer circle colors represent distinct
  functional pathways) associated with pulmonary hypertension. Size of node is proportional
  to the number of miRNA groups (among those in the inner circle) predicted to target
  that particular gene
