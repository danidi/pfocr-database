caption: Proposed MasR signaling mechanisms. The MasR has constitutive activity toward
  reduction of cAMP levels. This effect is mediated by receptor coupling to Gαi adenylyl
  cyclase signaling pathway. MasR putative ligands [Ang-(1–7) and AVE 0991] amplify
  MasR activity. In addition to modulation of cAMP, the MasR attenuates Ang-(1–7)-induced
  ERK1/2 phosphorylation mediated by AT1R.
