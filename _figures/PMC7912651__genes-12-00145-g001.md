caption: Hypothetical relations between cell wall polymers and stress signaling mediated
  by the FLA4-FEI pathway. At the center of the pathway FLA4 and the FEIs might repress
  1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE 1-CARBOXYLIC ACID SYNTHASE (ACS), which could affect various
  other growth regulators, including abscisic acid (ABA), auxin, ethylene, jasmonic
  acid, and salicylic acid. ABA regulates osmotic and oxidative stress responses.
  ACC influences intracellular calcium by activating GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR HOMOLOGS (GLRs)
  and also affects transcription of cell wall peroxidases and extensins, which could
  crosslink cell wall polysaccharides. There appears to be a tight interaction between
  the FLA4-FEI pathway and THE1 as well as MCA1 in cell wall integrity (CWI) sensing.
  The physical interactions that connect cell wall polymers with the FLA4-FEI pathway
  are presently unknown (dashed arrows).
