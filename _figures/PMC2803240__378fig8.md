caption: 'Model of VA metabolism in neonatal rat lung. The four panels represent the
  observed and proposed pathways of retinoid uptake, esterification, and oxidative
  metabolism in the lungs of neonates treated with RA for 6 h (A) and 12 h (B), and
  with Am580 for 6 h (C) and 12 h (D). Changes in gene expression represent the effects
  of the acidic retinoids, with and without VA, while retinol uptake and RE formation
  represent the treatments that included VA. A: When RA is administered to neonatal
  rats with a supplement of VA, RA upregulates the expression of LRAT and CYP26B1
  to the same extent at 6 h, with the flow of retinol to RE formation or to polar
  metabolites kept in a balance. More dietary retinol is taken up by lung tissue due
  to upregulation of STRA6 and elevated plasma retinol at 6 h. B: At 12 h, RA is metabolized
  by CYP26B1. Although the biological activity of RA has declined, the pathway is
  still balanced as STRA6, LRAT, and CYP26B1 have all returned to basal levels. C:
  When Am580 is administered to neonatal rats with a supplement of VA, LRAT expression
  is induced to a higher level than CYP26B1 at 6 h, favoring RE formation. D: At 12
  h, Am580 continues to exert its regulatory activity due to its resistance to oxidative
  metabolism, and CYP26B1 is dramatically upregulated, to a higher extent than LRAT.
  Thus, the pathway is unbalanced and retinoid metabolism flows toward the oxidative
  direction. The decline in the size of the lung RE pool suggests that retinol, released
  from the RE pool, is either oxidized directly to polar metabolites such as 4-oxo-retinol
  (denoted as “?” in D) or first oxidized to RA and then to polar metabolites of RA
  for elimination.'
