caption: Levels of Trx1/sCD30 and Treg/Th1/Th17 cytokine in serum, tissue, or tumor
  microenvironment are prognostic and stratification biomarkers for clinical treatment.
  The CD30/Trx1 system is a potential target in tumor therapy aimed at the simultaneous
  optimization of the redox and immune system regulation. Normal levels of sCD30 and
  Trx1 are positive (benefit) biomarkers reflecting the normal functioning of extracellular
  pathways, while normal levels of Treg/Th1/Th17 cytokines are positive (benefit)
  biomarkers for the normal functioning of intracellular pathways. Abnormal levels
  (higher levels of sCD30, Trx1, and Th17 and lower levels of Treg and Th1) are negative
  (risk) biomarkers for the abnormal functioning of CD30/Trx1 target pathways and
  so for immunological deficit and a lack of response to therapy
