number: Figure 3
caption: Example of the network module. This figure shows the lysine biosynthesis
  pathway. Enzymes surrounded by the solid lines represent parts of particular modules.
  The other gray colored enzymes correspond to singleton modules, which are those
  that contain only one enzyme. Lysine biosynthesis includes multiple modules, which
  also spread to the other map categories.
