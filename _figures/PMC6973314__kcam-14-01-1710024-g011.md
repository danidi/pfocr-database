caption: Role of BST2, E-cadherin, and signaling pathways in IFN-γ-mediated decrease
  in invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Treatment of HTR-8/SVneo cells with IFN-γ leads
  to upregulation in the expression of BST2 and concomitantly activates JAK/STAT and
  AKT signaling pathways. Silencing or inhibition of BST2 and AKT signaling pathway
  abrogates the effect of IFN-γ on the decreased invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Further,
  silencing of STAT1 and inhibition of AKT signaling pathways also inhibit the expression
  of BST2. Interestingly, the expression of E-cadherin was regulated by STAT1 and
  AKT signaling pathways and also by levels of BST2, which suggest their role in IFN-γ-mediated
  decrease in invasion of HTR-8/SVneo cells.
