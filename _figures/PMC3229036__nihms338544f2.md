caption: 'E-cadherins, integrins or guanylyl-nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) activate SRC, which phosphorylates focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1).
  FAK1 promotes the formation of protrusive actin structures by activating RHO-family
  GTPases such as RAC1 and cell division cycle 42 (CDC42). The downstream effectors
  of RHO-family GTPases are: Wiscott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)–WASP-family verprolin-homologous
  protein (WAVE) proteins, Diaphanous-related formins (mDIA proteins; also known as
  DRF or DIAPH proteins) and kinases such as PAKs and RHO-associated protein kinases
  (ROCKs). WASP–WAVE proteins stimulate the activation of the ARP2/3 complex. PAKs
  and ROCKs contribute to the formation of actin filaments by inactivating cofilin
  via phosphorylation of LIM domain kinases (LIMKs). mDIA stimulates the nucleation
  and extension of parallel actin filaments. RHOA is initially inactivated by integrin
  signalling via paxillin. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is phosphorylated by SRC
  and then activates RHOA, leading to the formation of stress fibres. ABL tyrosine
  kinases negatively regulate the RHO–ROCK signalling pathway while activating RAC1
  and WASP–WAVE (for reviews, see REFS ,). ROCK proteins also stimulate the phosphorylation
  of myosin regulatory light chain (MLC), thus contributing to the contractility of
  actin–myosin. Several viral proteins interact with this signalling machinery at
  multiple levels (see main text for details). Black arrows indicate direct phosphorylation
  or stimulation of the downstream molecule. Inhibitory or indirect interactions are
  shown as red or dotted lines, respectively. Stimulatory or modulatory interactions
  of viral proteins are indicated by black lines. Ad, adenoviruses; E4ORF4, early
