caption: Proposed model for miR-146a-mediated activation of WAVE2 expression and enhancement
  of phagocytosis in endotoxin-stimulated macrophages. Under conditions of endotoxin
  stimulation, miR146a is rapidly induced by the TLR4-mediated signaling pathway in
  macrophages, leading to upregulation of WAVE2, which in turn promotes cytoskeletal
  reorganization/phagocytic cup formation and subsequent phagocytosis of pathogens.
