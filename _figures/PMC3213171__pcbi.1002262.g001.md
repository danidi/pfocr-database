  signaling pathways as described in . The pathway assignments are indicated by the
  color of the reaction vertex in the network. (NA: not assigned; SGTP: small guanosine
  triphosphatase mediated signaling; PIP: phosphatidylinositol polyphosphate signaling;
  REC: recycling; ENDO: endocytosis; DEG: degradation; CELLC: cell cycle; MAPK: mitogen-activated
  protein kinase cascade; TRANS: transcription; CAS: Ca2+signaling; GPCR: G-protein
  coupled receptor mediated signaling; ERBB: erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene
  homolog receptor signaling).'
