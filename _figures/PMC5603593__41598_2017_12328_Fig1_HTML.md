caption: The scheme describing the fabrication process of APS-loaded carbox-GelMA
  nanoparticles (APS/NPs) and their influence on EMT in breast cancer MCF-7 cells.
  ARA and GelMA were emulsively blending to form the water-in-oil (W/O) mixture, and
  then the mixture was catalyzed to form GelMA-based NPs by APS. Meanwhile, ARA was
  oxidized to produce malonic acid and glutaric acid by APS. The carboxyl groups in
  malonic acid and glutaric acid could react with the partial free amino group in
  GelMA to generate the negative charges. After the excessive oil layer was washed
  by diethyl ether, the carbox-GelMA NPs were produced. The negatively-charged carbox-GelMA
  NPs could carry the positively-charged APS through electrostatic interaction. The
  APS/NPs showed high effective induction for EMT in MCF-7 cells in vitro through
  lysosome pathway and endow MCF-7 cells the metastasic capability to liver in vivo.
