caption: 'Following vaginal administration of CpG ODN or α-GalCer, Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis identified “Inflammatory response” as the top bio-function network among
  significantly up-regulated (Q≤0.01) genes. A A network showing cellular localization
  and known relationships between genes involved in the inflammatory response. Genes
  are colored based on their induction by CpG (red), α-GalCer (blue) or both adjuvants
  (purple). B Key interactor genes are highlighted in A and were confirmed at the
  protein level by ELISA (IL-1β) and CBA (IL-6, TNF, IL-10 and IFN-γ). Results shown
  are pooled from two independent experiments. Bars show mean+SEM (*: p≤0.05, **:
  p≤0.01).'
