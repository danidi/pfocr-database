caption: CLV-WUS signaling pathways in model and crop plant meristems. (A) Arabidopsis
  SAM. (B) Tomato SAM. (C) Rice FM and SAM. (D) Maize SAM. Genes with characterized
  genetic and/or biochemical interactions are shown. Arrows depict positive regulation
  and bars depict negative regulation. Solid lines represent direct interactions and
  dashed lines represent indirect interactions. Solid lines with rounded ends depict
  direct peptide–receptor interactions. Unidentified receptors for peptides are denoted
  by question marks.
