caption: Involvement of Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA in vesicle trafficking, cellular transformation,
  invadopodia formation and metastasis. Cdc42 regulates vesicle trafficking and invadopodia
  formation through Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP)-mediated Arp2/3 signaling
  pathway. Rac1 has an effect on endocytosis and exocytosis via acting on its downstream
  effectors, including synaptojanin 2, IQGAP1, PIP5K and PLD1, and is involved in
  metastasis through its downstream molecule, WAVE2. RhoA activates its major downstream
  effector, Rho-associated coiled coil-containing protein kinases (ROCK), to modulate
  endocytosis and invadopodia formation through affecting actin dynamics. Hyperactivation
  of Cdc42, Rac1 or RhoA can result in cellular transformation.
