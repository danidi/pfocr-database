caption: 'Mechanosensing by the nucleus. (A and a) High nuclear tension can induce
  conformational changes in lamin A, C and B1/B2 coiled-coil dimers, which sterically
  inhibits access by kinases, Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk’s), protein kinase C (PKC),
  and protein kinase B, (Akt), which would otherwise increase lamin turnover. (B and
  b) Pulling on nesprin-1, (the LINC complex of Nesprin and sun domain-containing
  protein 2 (SUN2) which tethers the nucleus to the cytoskeleton), leads to phosphorylation
  of emerin by non-receptor tyrosine kinase (SRC) with stress stiffening of the nucleus
  influencing downstream mechanoresponses: e.g., formation of stress fibres, migration,
  localisation of YAP and TAZ, and serum response factor transcription. (C and c)
  Mechanosensitive transcription factors such as YAP and TAZ, which influence growth
  in the Hippo pathway, (see ), translocate into the nucleus under stress to modulate
  gene expression. (D and d) Mechanical stress leads to nuclear localisation of RARγ,
  (retinoic acid receptor γ) which directly regulates LMNA (lamins A and C gene) transcription.
  (E and e) Application of mechanical force may lead to changes in chromatin conformation
  (e.g., local stretching of genes), thereby altering transcriptional activity. (F)
  High tension can induce membrane dilation and may lead to transient ruptures, allowing
  for the exchange and mislocalisation of nucleoplasmic and cytoplasmic factors. Copied
