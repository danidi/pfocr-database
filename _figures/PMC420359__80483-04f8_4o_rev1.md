caption: RA regulation of reciprocal interactions between the visceral endoderm and
  mesoderm that control endothelial cell growth and vascular remodeling. (A) In the
  wild-type (WT) yolk sac, maternally derived retinol is taken up by the visceral
  endoderm from the trophoblast sinuses, where it is converted into active RA by Raldh2.
  RA targets endothelial cells within the mesoderm through RARα1 and RARα2 and promotes
  Fn transcription and production via the TGF-β1 pathway. ECM proteins dually regulate
  endothelial cell proliferation through different integrin receptors. Integrin αvβ3-Vn
  interactions induce proliferation by enhancing Flk-1 phosphorylation and activation
  of ERK1/2. Conversely, integrin α5β1-Fn interactions inhibit endothelial cell proliferation.
  Fn deposition between the visceral endoderm and mesoderm layers is also required
  for visceral endoderm maintenance and continued production of factors essential
  for vascular remodeling (qk, VEGF-A, IHH, bFGF) and barrier function (Cldn7). (B)
  In the Raldh2-/- yolk sac, RA can not be synthesized from retinol resulting in down-regulation
  of TGF-β and Fn. Furthermore, integrin α5 is specifically decreased leading to increased
  αv-Vn-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation.
  Reduced Fn deposition between mesoderm and visceral endoderm also results in increased
  apoptosis of extraembryonic visceral endoderm, which is concomitant with decreased
  production of soluble signals required for vascular remodeling.

  description: RA regulation of reciprocal interactions between the visceral endoderm
    and mesoderm that control endothelial cell growth and vascular remodeling. (A)
    In the wild-type (WT) yolk sac, maternally derived retinol is taken up by the
    visceral endoderm from the trophoblast sinuses, where it is converted into active
    RA by Raldh2. RA targets endothelial cells within the mesoderm through RARα1 and
    RARα2 and promotes Fn transcription and production via the TGF-β1 pathway. ECM
    proteins dually regulate endothelial cell proliferation through different integrin
    receptors. Integrin αvβ3-Vn interactions induce proliferation by enhancing Flk-1
    phosphorylation and activation of ERK1/2. Conversely, integrin α5β1-Fn interactions
    inhibit endothelial cell proliferation. Fn deposition between the visceral endoderm
    and mesoderm layers is also required for visceral endoderm maintenance and continued
    production of factors essential for vascular remodeling (qk, VEGF-A, IHH, bFGF)
    and barrier function (Cldn7). (B) In the Raldh2-/- yolk sac, RA can not be synthesized
    from retinol resulting in down-regulation of TGF-β and Fn. Furthermore, integrin
    α5 is specifically decreased leading to increased αv-Vn-mediated activation of

    between mesoderm and visceral endoderm also results in increased apoptosis of
