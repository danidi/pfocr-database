caption: The stimulatory pathway of CD28 and the antagonist effect of CTLA-4 on Th
  cell activation. T cell activation occurs via a two stage process. Stage 1 involves
  generation of a signal via the interaction of a presented antigen with the TCR-CD3
  complex. Stage 2 of T cell activation involves a costimulatory signal from CD28
  interaction with B7. Regulation of this second stage of T cell activation is provided
  by a down regulation of T cell activation by CTLA-4. Due to the negative control
  function of CTLA-4, functional mutations in this gene could increase susceptibility
  to autoimmune thyroid disease.
