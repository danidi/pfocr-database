caption: FGF2, TGF-β and inflammatory cytokine induced catabolic and pro-inflammatory
  signaling in human OA AC. The major components of inflammatory cytokine, FGF2 and
  TGF-β activated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), mitogen activated protein kinase
  (MAPK), and SMA- and MAD-related protein (SMAD) signaling as well as their transcriptional
  targets in human OA AC are depicted. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) upregulated in human OA
  AC are indicated in red, miRNAs downregulated in human OA AC are indicated in green.
  For miRNAs with contradictory regulation a black font is chosen. The small arrows
  beside the miRNAs pointing downwards indicate direct or indirect inhibition of the
  signaling component by the miRNA, whereas small upward arrows indicate direct or
  indirect activation of the signaling component by the miRNA. As illustrated, there
  is an intense crosstalk between the individual pathways. In human OA AC, expression
  of pro-catabolic target genes is mediated by NF-κB, MAPK and SMAD signaling, whereas
  pro-inflammatory targets are activated downstream of MAPK and NF-κB signaling. Advanced
  stages of OA are characterized by activation of inflammatory cytokine signaling.
  On miRNA level there is primarily a net upregulation of IL-6, whereas both positive
  and negative regulation of NF-κB signaling is reported. Moreover, in human OA AC
  upregulation of CCN2 and significantly enhanced activation of extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase (ERK), JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK pathways has been documented.
  Yet, evidence for ERK signaling regulation by miRNA is contradictory, whereas JNK
  and p38 activation is a common downstream event after inflammatory cytokine, FGF2
  and TGFβ pathway activation with no direct miRNA regulation reported in OA AC to
  date. TGF-β signaling is globally downregulated in OA AC with especially negative
  regulation of the anabolic SMAD3 mediated pathway which is both evident on protein
  and miRNA level. In addition, in particular at miRNA level, reversal of negative
  regulation of MMP-13 is obvious in OA AC.
