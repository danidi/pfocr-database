caption: 'Overall mechanisms of hepatitis B virus escape from host-related immunity
  with a focus on the role of class I alfa-mannosidases via the PPAR-alfa pathway.
  Hepatitis B virus infection increases the expression of class I alfa-mannosidases
  via the PPARα signaling pathway. The surface of HBV envelope proteins could be glycosylated
  by the class I alfa-mannosidases. In turn, DC-SIGN can no longer recognize the HBV
  glycoprotein coat, allowing the virus to escape from immune attack. NTCP: Sodium
  taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide; ER-Golgi: Endoplasmic reticulum and/or
  Golgi; GlcNAc: N-acetyl-d-glucosamine.'
