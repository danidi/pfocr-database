caption: The proposed pathway for protein catabolism-directed biofuel production in
  Clostridium sticklandii DSM 519. We proposed this pathway based on the metabolic
  reactions collected from the MetaCyc database for amino acid catabolism associated
  acetate, n-butanol, n-butyric acid, ethanol and hydrogen production. Enzyme commission
  was assigned according to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database entries.
  Pyruvate was considered as a main metabolic precursor for the synthesis of organic
  solvents and organic acids in the proposed pathway. Ethanol is simply produced from
  acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Butanoyl-coA is a key metabolic switch to
  synthesis either n-butanol or n-butyric acid. Stickland reactions are a great concern
  of interest for amino acid catabolism by C. sticklandii. It has a separate pathway
  for lysine catabolism that directs n-butanol and n-butyric acid production. Hydrogen
  production is coupled with formate metabolism which may be directed by accumulation
  of pyruvate in the cytoplasm.
