caption: RXFP3 in DNA damage response and repair. (A) With DNA damage in the form
  of a double strand break (DSB), the cell has several mechanisms to respond and thus
  repair itself. The damage is recognized by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex (MRN complex),
  which recruits and activates ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated), which is autophosphorylated.
  ATM, in turn phosphorylates multiple damage-associated proteins. H2AX (a variant
  of the histone H2A family) phosphorylation (generating γ-H2AX) allows for the recruitment
  of MDC1 (Mediator of Damage Checkpoint protein 1), also a phosphorylation substrate
  of ATM. Phosphorylated MDC1 serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of other proteins
  required for the activation of BRCA1 by ATM, thus promoting cell cycle arrest and
  DNA repair. BRCA1, in turn, then interacts with multiple proteins, i.e. p53, RAD50,
  RAD51, ATM, NSB1 and BRCA2, to modulate DNA repair, transcription, and the cell
  cycle. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 by ATM activates DNA repair through homologous recombination,
  in cooperation with BRCA2 and RAD51. Additionally, BRCA1 recruits the MRN-complex
  to the sites of DNA damage. ATM furthermore phosphorylates the aging keystone GIT2
  promotes the repair of DNA damage via the stabilization of repair factor BRCA1,
  in the repair complex. GIT2 then allows the formation of a nuclear DSB focus dependent
  on H2AX, ATM, and MRE11. Also GIT2 is a strong interactor of the cell cycle checkpoint
  protein p53 and PARP1. PARPs play a pivotal role in DNA damage detection and repair,
  by the formation of ADP-ribose ribosylation complexes, allowing the recruitment
  of DDR proteins to the damaged DNA. After the DNA has been repaired, γ-H2AX is dephosphorylated
  by PP2A, a phosphatase. (B) Cells exploit two major DSB repair pathways, i) ATM-dependent
  homologous recombination (HR), and ii) PRKDC-mediated Non-homologous end joining
  (NHEJ). In the absence of a functional ATM, it seems cells are able to rely on functional
  PRKDC signaling for their survival, thus using the NHEJ pathway as a backup pathway
  for DSB repair [].
