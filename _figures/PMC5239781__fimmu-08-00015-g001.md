caption: Complement activation. The classical pathway recognizes immunoglobulins (IgM/IgG)
  and pentraxins (such as C-reactive protein) and forms and activates a C1 complex,
  leading to the cleavage of C4 and C2. The cleavage products C4b and C2a form the
  C3 convertase C4b2a of the classical pathway, which in turn cleaves the central
  complement component C3 into the anaphylatoxin C3a and opsonin C3b. The C3 convertase
  can also be formed and activated by the lectin pathway, in which mannose-binding
  lectin (MBL) and ficolins recognize pathogenic patterns, leading to the activation
  of MBL-associated serine proteases MASP-1 and MASP-2. The alternative pathway, triggered
  by various danger- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS and PAMPS,
  respectively) on necrotic, apoptotic, and foreign surfaces, involves hydrolisation
  of C3 and cleavage by other complement factors. Binding of factor B (FB) to C3(H2O)
  results in the formation of an alternative fluid phase C3 convertase. C3 is cleaved,
  and C3b binds FB to form the surface-bound main C3 convertase of the alternative
  pathway, which is stabilized by properdin (P) and can in turn induce all functions
  of complement (C3bBbP). The alternative pathway also constitutes an amplification
  loop for the complement cascade, with C3b as a feedback effector. Besides enhancing
  the complement response, as an opsonin, C3b is also essential for the clearance
  of pathogens and tissue debris. Downstream of the converging activation pathways,
  the C3 convertases of both classical and alternative pathways bind C3b and form
  the respective C5 convertases. Those cleave C5, producing the potent anaphylatoxin
  C5a and C5b. The latter, together with several other complement factors (C6, C7,
  C8, and C9), forms the terminal complement complex (TCC), also known as membrane
  attack complex. This C5b–9 complex induces both pro- and anti-inflammatory cell
  signaling pathways and is also capable to form a lytic pore. Cleavage and activation
  of central complement components is also possible by proteases typically not associated
  with the complement system, such as trypsin—effectively constituting a fourth, non-canonical
  extrinsic protease pathway of complement activation (targets shown exemplarily).
  Important regulators of the complement cascade (CRegs) are C1 inhibitor (C1INH),
  factor H (FH), and membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (CD59). Several CRegs control
  the formation, activity, and degradation of C3 convertase, which can be classical,
  alternative, or both. CD35, C4bp, and FH, shown here acting on the convertases themselves,
  can also function as cofactors for FI-mediated cleavage of upstream components C3b
  or C4b. CD35 = complement receptor 1 (CR1); CD46 = membrane cofactor protein (MCP);
  CD55 = decay accelerating factor (DAF); FI, factor I; C4bp, C4-binding protein.
