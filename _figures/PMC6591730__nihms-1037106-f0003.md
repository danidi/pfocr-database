caption: (A) ssDNA exposed during replication fork progression is a substrate for
  cytosine deamination. Active replication forks expose ssDNA on the lagging strand.
  Stalled replication forks expose ssDNA on both the leading and lagging strand, which
  activates ATR to stop replication and stabilize the fork through controlled fork
  reversal. Endonuclease cleavage causes replication fork collapse into one-ended
  DNA DSBs, which must be resected before repair by HR.(B) ssDNA exposed during transcription
  is a substrate for cytosine deamination. RNA polymerase (RNAP) exposes ssDNA while
  synthesizing nascent RNA (red) at the transcription bubble and behind the RNAP as
  a result of negative supercoiling (left). Transcription stress induces the formation
  of R-loops (middle), which exposes long stretches of ssDNA on the non-template strand.
  R-loops may be resolved in DSBs through cleavage by TC-NER components XPF and XPG
  (right).(C) Mechanism of enzyme-induced somatic hypermutation (SHM). Cytosine deamination
  generates a U:G mismatch, which is recognized by uracil glycosylase UNG to generate
  an abasic site opposite the G. Apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease (APE)
  excises the abasic nucleotide which is repaired by POLb. If the abasic site is replicated
  over prior to repair, this can give rise to transition or transversion mutations
  (N). If the U:G mismatch is replicated prior to repair, C>T substitution occurs.
  Mutations at neighboring A:T base pairs can occur if the U:G pair is recognized
  by the MMR pathway and repaired by error prone polymerase eta (Polη).(D) Mechanisms
  of enzyme-induced rearrangements and class-switch recombination (CSR). If cytosine
  deamination occurs nearby on opposite strands, repair through BER or MMR will form
  DNA DSBs, leading to chromosomal rearrangements or CSR.
