caption: Core signaling pathways responsible for airway smooth muscle contraction.
  Airway smooth muscle contractile force is generated by cyclic cross-bridging of
  actin and smooth muscle myosin, which depends on myosin phosphorylation. Myosin
  phosphorylation is regulated by cyclic increases in cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) that
  activate calmodulin (CaM) to phosphorylate myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which
  directly phosphorylates myosin. In parallel, the small GTPase, RhoA, is activated
  by both calcium-dependent and -independent pathways. Rho directly activates Rho-associated
  coiled-coil protein kinase (ROCK) which, in turn, phosphorylates and thereby inactivates
  myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), which normally dephosphorylates myosin. The
  most important physiological pathway for increasing cytosolic calcium in airway
  smooth muscle involves activation of Gαq by G protein–coupled receptors that respond
  to extracellular contractile agonists, such as methacholine (Mch), serotonin (5-HT),
  and histamine. Gαq activates phospholipase C β (PLCβ), which generates IP3 to bind
  to IP3 receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum and release sequestered Ca2+.
