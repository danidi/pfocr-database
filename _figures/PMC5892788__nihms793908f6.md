caption: Based on our data, we hypothesized that in the initial stage, UMSCC cell
  proliferation (both in the primary, UMSCC38 and secondary tumor, UMSCC11B cell lines)
  is achieved by TGFβ1/Smads/ΔNp63/c-Myc pathway with higher proliferative attributes
  in UMSCC38. However, subsequently TGFβ1 switches it’s signaling via PI3K/AKT/ΔNp63
  pathway at the inception stage for EMT/invasive, primarily in the secondary tumor,
  as seen in the UMSCC11B cell lines (that resulted from relapse and recurrence at
  the primary site) from. We further conclude that while TGFβ1 has distinct functions
  in cancer progression, its downstream signaling partners and transcription factors
  regulate ultimate cancer cell fate and achieve switch from tumor growth to invasion.
