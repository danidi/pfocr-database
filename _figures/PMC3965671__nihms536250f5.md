caption: A role for the Th17 pathway in a subset of asthma patients? Accumulating
  evidence suggests that in addition to the well-accepted Th2 pathway of asthma pathogenesis
  (left panel), a subset of patients with steroid-refractory disease might have a
  prominent contribution by Th17 pathway inflammation. In the former, sensitization
  to respiratory allergens primes a dysregulated Th2 response, perhaps via dysregulated
  TSLP and IL-33 production by the repiratory epithelium, resulting in the production
  of IgE-producing antibodies that arm tissue resident or infiltrating mast cells
  and basophils for hypersensitivity responses to allergen re-exposure. In addition
  to actions on B cells, the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-13 act on respiratory epithelial
  cells to stimulate increased mucous production. IL-5 produced by Th2 cells stimulates
  the increased production and recruitment of eosinophils, which are a principal component
  of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid in patients with active disease. In a subset
  of patients with refractory disease, Th17 pathway features are found, including
  elevated neutrophils and IL-17 in BAL. It is therefore possible that many of the
  Th17 pathway responses stimulated in response to respiratory bacterial or fungal
  infection (right panel) could be dysregulated in this subset of asthma patients,
  thereby contributing to disease pathogenesis (reviewed in ref. ()).
