caption: After docking and priming (top center, purple arrows), synaptic vesicles
  are ready to fuse (either evoked or spontaneously) with the active zone membrane
  (bottom center, purple arrow). After fusion, vesicles can be rapidly retrieved without
  morphological or molecular changes by closure of the fusion pore (kiss-and-run,
  center, red arrow) or can fully collapse, irreversibly, intermixing its components
  with the plasma membrane (bottom left, light blue arrow). Synaptic vesicle proteins
  can be specifically retrieved from the plasma membrane via an ultra-fast mechanism
  (bottom right, blue arrow) or, during sustained stimulation, via a slower bulk endocytosis
  pathway (bottom left, blue arrow). Note that the endosomal-like intermediaries generated
  in both cases might not be the same (neither morphologically nor molecularly). Afterwards,
  synaptic vesicles are regenerated from the synaptic endosomes via a clathrin-dependent
  mechanism (left and right sides, green arrows). Finally, synaptic vesicle proteins
  can also be rapidly retrieved from pre-assembled clusters containing adaptor proteins
  and clathrin, which would be endocytosed upon stimulation in synchrony with neurotransmitter
  release (bottom right, orange arrow).
