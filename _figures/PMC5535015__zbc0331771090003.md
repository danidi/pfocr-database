caption: Transcriptional regulation of c-REL by NPD1. The activation of either the
  canonical/non-canonical NF-κB pathways or c-REL carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation
  by TBK1/IKKϵ results in accumulation of REL proteins in the nucleus. Depending on
  the conditions, homo- or heterodimers containing c-REL can form. (1) c-REL promoter
  ligation eventuates in c-REL protein synthesis, which reinforces the autoregulation
  loop, (2) by increasing the content of c-REL in the NF-κB dimers, and (3) c-REL-containing
  dimers bind to the BIRC3 promoter to increase its expression activity, which ensures
  cell survival. NPD1 augments this auto-regulation loop by shifting the balance toward
  c-REL homodimers to intensify the expression of both BIRC3 and c-REL genes with
  subsequent protein synthesis. This shift allows for the restoration of cell homeostasis
  and thus promotes survival. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is depicted for ease
  of understanding the protein synthesis step in the pathway.
