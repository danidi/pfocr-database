caption: 'Immunotherapy .drugs used in combination therapy in the studies. Red boxes
  denote targets and associated therapeutics. Drugs without FDA approved indications
  are denoted by italics. Also included in the studies: IDO-1 is an enzyme in the
  immune tolerance pathway (IDO-1 inhibitors: epacadostat, indoximod). Toll-like receptor
  9 is part of the innate immunity system (TLR-9 inhibitor: PF-3512576). Avelumab
  is an FDA-approved anti-PD-L1 agent but was not included in the figure because there
  were no combination studies during the time period analyzed.'
