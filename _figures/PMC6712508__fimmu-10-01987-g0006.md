caption: The proposed mechanism of TN-C release following RV infection of bronchial
  epithelial cells. Upon viral infection, RV is internalized to the early endosome
  and uncoats. The single stranded RNA exits the endosome (early or late endosome
  depending on the RV serotype) and forms a temporary double stranded RNA intermediate
  (recognized by TLR3 in the cytoplasm). It is not yet clear how the endosomal TLR
  recognizes the cytoplasmic RNA. Poly(I:C) enters the endosome upon addition to cells
  and stimulates the TLR3 pathway. The amount of RV/Poly(I:C)-dependent cell associated
  TN-C upregulation may depend on existing basal levels of expression in the cell,
  with PBECs expressing higher TN-C levels at baseline compared to BEAS-2B cells.
  Furthermore, RV-induced TN-C release occurs in response to major and minor serotypes
  of RV, and is not an indirect consequence of cell cytotoxicity, as poly(I:C) induces
  TN-C release despite no significant cell death. Activation of the TLR3 dependent
  pathway (and other pathways upon viral infection) induce the release of TNFα and
  TGFβ, known transcriptional regulators of TN-C through the MAPK/ERK and NF-κB/p65
  pathways. It is postulated that this triggers the signaling cascade required for
  the expression and release of TN-C in PBECs. Black lines denote events determined
  by experiments with both poly(I:C) and RV, the dashed line indicates events that
  occur in RV infection and the dotted line indicates events determined by experiments
  with poly(I:C) only.
