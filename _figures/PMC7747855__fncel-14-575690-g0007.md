caption: Astrocytic SHH signaling pathway regulates BBB integrity after ICH. SHH secreted
  by astrocytes binds to its receptor Ptch-1 in endothelial cells (ECs), leading to
  the activation of SMO and its downstream transcription factor Gli-1. Activated Gli-1
  upregulates TJs and enhances BBB integrity. Upon the binding of SMO to CYC, this
  pathway is repressed, resulting in decreased TJs expressions and exacerbated BBB
  permeability.

  description: Astrocytic SHH signaling pathway regulates BBB integrity after ICH.
    SHH secreted by astrocytes binds to its receptor Ptch-1 in endothelial cells (ECs),
    leading to the activation of SMO and its downstream transcription factor Gli-1.
    Activated Gli-1 upregulates TJs and enhances BBB integrity. Upon the binding of
    SMO to CYC, this pathway is repressed, resulting in decreased TJs expressions
    and exacerbated BBB permeability.
