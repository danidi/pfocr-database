caption: Gene expression analysis of thyroid hormone synthesis pathway. (A) Visualization
  of the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway. Rectangular nodes represent genes and
  circular nodes denote small molecules. Edges represent reactions derived from KEGG
  pathway rno04918. This graph is generated using the Cytoscape software. TSH, thyroid
  stimulating hormone; TSHR, thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. SLC5A5, solute
  carrier family 5 member 5; SLC26A4, solute carrier family 26 member 4; TG, thyroglobulin;
  TPO, thyroperoxidase; DUOXA2, dual oxidases A2; DUOX2, dual oxidases 2; (B) Bar
  plot showing fold change values based on RNA-seq data. None of these genes were
  differentially expressed according to the criteria of fold change > 2 and adjusted
  p-value < 0.01.
