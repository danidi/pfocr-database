caption: Computed reaction pathway for the desulfinilation reaction in C4-sulfinyl-1,2,3-triazolium
  salts. All values correspond to Gibbs energies in DCM (dichloromethane) (kcal mol–1).
  DFT calculations were carried out using the M06 density functional, with an ultrafine
  grid as implemented in Gaussian 09. Gaussian 09 performs well for main-group chemistry
  and noncovalent interactions. All intermediates and transition states were fully
  optimized in DCM solution (ε = 8.93) using the continuum method SMD. The 6-31G**
  basis set (BS1) was used. Final single-point calculations were performed with the
  6-311++G** basis set (BS2). Transition states were identified by having one imaginary
  frequency in the Hessian matrix. It was confirmed that transition states connect
  with the corresponding intermediates by means of application of the eigenvector
  of the imaginary frequency and subsequent optimization of the resulting structures.
