caption: Integration of metabolic pathways.Glucose is transported over a plasma membrane
  by a glucose transporter (GLUT) and is metabolized to pyruvate by glycolysis. Pyruvate
  is converted to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the mitochondria, where it is
  oxidized to CO2 through the citric acid cycle; redox energy is conserved as reduced
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The mitochondrial respiratory chain couples
  oxidation of NADH and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) to the formation
  of the electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane,
  which is used to generate adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP). ATP produced from oxidative
  phosphorylation is transported from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm by
  the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT).Glucose may be stored as glycogen. Fatty
  acids and amino acids can also be bioenergetics precursors; however, glucose is
  considered to be the only metabolic substrate in the brain. Glucose can also be
  metabolized via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a process that generates pentoses
  and that is the most important cytosolic source of reduced nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), a cofactor for biosynthetic reactions and the oxidation-reduction
  involved in protecting against the oxidative stress, e.g. for fatty acid biosynthesis
  or regeneration of reduced glutathione.During activation, the brain may transiently
  turn to aerobic glycolysis occurring in astrocytes, followed by the oxidation of
  lactate by neurons. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) carry lactate or pyruvate
  across biological membranes; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) catalyzes the interconversion
  of pyruvate and lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH to oxidized nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).
