caption: 'Pathways and genes involved in the conversion of hexoses into lactate and
  the conversion of these substrates into n-caproate via the reverse β-oxidation (rBOX)
  pathway. The first cycle of the rBOX pathway involves the conversion of the acetate
  produced by one acetyl-CoA molecule into n-butyrate. The second cycle involves the
  conversion of this n-butyrate into n-caproate via the butyryl-CoA produced in the
  first cycle and an acetyl-CoA molecule. The genes that code for the enzymes catalyzing
  the production of lactate and its conversion into pyruvate and each reaction of
  the rBOX pathway are shown for each reaction. rBOX genes: thl, thiolase (acetyl-CoA
  C-acetyltransferase); hbd, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase; crt, crotonase (3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA
  dehydratase); acdh, Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; etf, Electron transport flavoprotein;
  act, acetate-CoA transferase. Lactate production gene: ldh, L-ldh, L-lactate dehydrogenase.
  Lactate consumption genes: larA, lactate racemase; D-ldh: D-lactate dehydrogenase.'
