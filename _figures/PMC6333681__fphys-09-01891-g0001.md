caption: 'Environmental pollutant-induced obesity and metabolic diseases: involvement
  of BAT impairment. (A) Perinatal exposure to DDT in mice elicited reductions in
  mRNA expression of: (1) proteins involved in substrates transporters: glucose transporter
  type 4 (Glut4) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (Cpt2); (2) proteins involved
  in substrate utilization: adipose triglyceride lipase (Pnpla) and lipoprotein lipase
  (Lpl); (3) proteins involved in thermogenesis: iodothyronine type II deiodinase
  (Dio2, which encodes the enzyme that locally activates thyroid hormones through
  the deiodination of T4 to T3) and peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma
  coactivator 1 alpha (Ppargc1a, a master regulator in the thermogenesis), associated
  with an increase in the expression of twistrelated protein 1 (Twist1), a negative
  regulator of Ppargc1a. (La Merrill et al., ). Ppargc1a reduction may induce insulin
  resistance (Kleiner et al., ). No variation was found in Ucp1 mRNA expression (La
  Merrill et al., ). Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) deficiency induced increases
  in BAT thermogenic genes expressions: UCP1, PPARγ coactivator 1 α (PGC1α) and PR
  domain containing 16 (PRDM16) (Xu et al., ). DDT/DDE may have pro-inflammatory effect
  by inducing NF-κB activation and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) production (Kim
  et al., ) which in turn may activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway.
  (B) Long term exposure to PM2.5 has the following impact on BAT: (1) decreased BAT
  weight and mitochondrial size; (2) increased mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative
  stress; (3) decreased Ucp1 and Pgc-1α gene expression and Ucp1 protein content.
  The effects on WAT were: (1) decreased mitochondrial number; (2) decreased Ucp1,
  Prdm16, Pgc-1α, and Pparg2 gene expression and UCP1 protein content. (Xu et al.,
  ). PM2.5 is associated with BAT inflammation through the increased expression of
  interleukin-6 (IL6) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which negatively regulate
  BAT development by inducing apoptosis (Porras et al., ; Valladares et al., ; Liu
  et al., ). BAT inflammation was associated to decrease in ser437 phosphorylation
  of AKT and the impairment of insulin signaling in BAT (Xu et al., ). PM2.5 also
  induced low increase in hypothalamic TNFα concentration which lead to the activation
  only of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), which has opposite effect to TNFR2 by decreasing
  BAT function (Chen and Palmer, ).'
