caption: Regulation of cyclin C relocalization by the CWI pathway after H2O2 stress.
  H2O2-induced damage is recognized by the cell wall sensors (yellow), which transmit
  the stress signal via Rho1 to the CWI MAPK, pathway resulting in phosphorylation
  of Slt2p and Kdx1 (P). Activated Slt2p translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates
  cyclin C at serine 266. Activated Kdx1p is also imported into the nucleus, where
  it binds to Ask10p. This binding permits Ask10p to be phosphorylated by an unknown
  kinase. Thereafter, cyclin C translocates to the cytoplasm, where it is required
  for mitochondrial fission and cell death.
