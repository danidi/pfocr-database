caption: Schematic diagram of regulation of agonist-induced GPR109A internalization
  and trafficking in HEK-293 cells. Niacin (NA) binding to GPR109A activates the Gi
  family of heterotrimeric G proteins, leading to the dissociation of Gαi and Gβγ.
  Dissociated Gβγ subunit recruits GRK2 to catalyze the phosphorylation of GPR109A,
  followed by recruitment of arrestin3 to the receptor, which results in receptor
  internalization. PTX treatment not only blocks activation of the Gisignaling pathway
  but also inhibits agonist-induced GPR109A internalization.
