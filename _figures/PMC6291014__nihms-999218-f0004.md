caption: A model of EphB forward signaling regulating cell-ECM adhesion. EphB2 forward
  signaling phosphorylates R-Ras which results in a decrease in integrin binding to
  extracellular substrate. EphB also regulates integrin by locking it into an inactive
  confirmation mediated via the Abl/CrkII pathway and inhibiting Rap1. EphB receptors
  lead to a mesenchymal to epithelial transition by activating Abl which in turn inhibits
  Rac1 and MMP2, resulting in inhibition of EMT, migration and invasion.
