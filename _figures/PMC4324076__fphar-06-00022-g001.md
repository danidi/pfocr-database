caption: Transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels receptor-operated
  Ca2+ currents (ROCs). (A) Schematic representation of ROCs. Binding of an agonist
  to a Gq-protein-coupled receptor leads to phospholipase C (PLC) activation. The
  activated PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] to produce
  of diacylglycerol (DAG) and IP3. DAG and the reduction of PI(4,5)P2 levels directly
  contribute to TRPC channels activation, while IP3 triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular
  stores. (B) ROCs through TRPC7 channels. TRPC7 currents were induced using carbachol,
  a muscarinic receptor agonist (gray line, 100 μM). Left and right panels respectively
  display currents observed with low and high levels of muscarinic receptor expression
  (data from ). The vertical and horizontal gray scale bars indicate 200 pA and 15
  s, respectively.
