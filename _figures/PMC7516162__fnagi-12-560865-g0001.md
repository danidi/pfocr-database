caption: 'Purine degradation pathway induced by fructose. Fructose can come from the
  diet or be endogenously produced by the polyol pathway. In turn, the metabolism
  of fructose by fructokinase C (KHK-C) can lead to ATP consumption, with intracellular
  phosphate depletion, resulting in activation of AMP deaminase (AMPD) that eventually
  leads to the production of uric acid. Key: green color shows the sources of fructose,
  the blue color the caloric pathway of fructose metabolism, and the red color the
  pathway involving nucleotide degradation that activates the survival pathway.'
