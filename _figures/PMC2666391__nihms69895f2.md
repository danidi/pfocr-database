caption: TLRs such as TLR2, 4, and 5 at the cell surface of HCEC recognize PAMPs such
  as lipoproteins, LPS, and flagellin, respectively. Similarly nucleic acids released
  from damaged infected tissues or cells or captured from multiplying bacteria or
  viruses are recognized by TLRs such (TLR3, 7, 8, and 9) expressed in endosomes.
  The recognition of PAMPs by specific TLRs leads to the activation of cascade of
  intracellular signaling pathways in a MyD88 dependent or MyD88-independent manner.
  The MyD88-dependent pathway (all TLRs except TLR3) utilizes MyD88 which transduces
  signal through IRAK and TRAF6, leading to the activation of NF-κB pathways and production
  of proinflammatory cytokines and anti-microbial peptides. On the other hand, The
  MyD88-independent pathways, uses TRIF as an adaptor and transduces signal through
  TBK1 and IRF3/7, leading to the expression of IFNs and the IFN-induced genes. TLR2
  and TLR4 also utilize non-TLR receptors such as CD14 and MD2 for initial binding
  of their ligands.
