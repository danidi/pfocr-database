caption: In thiscartoon we graphically represent the relationship between critical
  oncogenic transcriptome networks and the miRNome. Target mRNAs for each major pathway
  are represented by circles with a unique color. MiRNAs are represented as hairpins
  structures in the center. The arrows connecting miRNAs and mRNAs indicate validated
  mRNA-miRNA interactions. The small arrow next to the circles indicate the biological
  effects on the pathway by the miRNA action on its target (i.e. miR-15a induces apoptosis
  by targeting BCL-2 or miR-29b suppresses cell proliferation by blocking CDK6. Some
  miRNAs like miR-29b, coordinately regulate multiple targets within different pathways.
  As shown in the cartoon, miR-29b modulates target mRNAs involved in apoptosis, cell
  proliferation, DNA methylation, histone acetylation and cell adhesion.
