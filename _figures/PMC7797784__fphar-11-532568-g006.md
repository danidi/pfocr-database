caption: The proposed mechanism of action of JC-5411 via activation of Nrf2 pathway
  against arteriosclerosis. Specifically, JC-5411 exerts anti-inflammatory effect
  by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling, thus reducing
  the release of IL-1β, and its anti-inflammatory effect was dependent on activating
  Nrf2. In addition, JC-5411 improves lipid metabolism by increasing the expression
  level of cholesterol transfer genes (ABCA1 and LDLR), decreasing the fatty acid
  synthesis genes (SCD1 and FAS), and increasing inactivation form of the rate-limiting
  enzyme of de novo fatty acid synthesis (p-ACC) and fatty acid β-oxidation genes
  (CPT1A) in ApoE−/− mice. Moreover, JC-5411 has antioxidant capacity by activating
  Nrf2 pathway and thus increasing the expression of various antioxidant genes including
  HO-1, NQO1, GCLC and GCLM in both ApoE−/− mice and HUVECs. Taken together, JC-5411
  as a Nrf2 activator protects against atherosclerosis through antiinflammation, regulating
  lipid metabolism and antioxidation.
