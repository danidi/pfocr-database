caption: Two potential mechanisms of honokiol regulation of Notch ligands. In the
  set of 30,347 candidate networks that fit the SW480 data, only 25 (0.08%) networks
  included honokiol activating Jagged, the node representing Notch ligands in our
  network. In contrast, 30,044 (99.00%) networks included honokiol inhibiting Jagged.
  In all networks, IR inhibited Jagged. (A) A representative Notch circuit from the
  set of candidate networks where honokiol is inhibiting Jagged and (B) a representative
  circuit from the set of candidate networks where honokiol is activating Jagged are
  presented. Logic regulations that differ between (A) and (B) are bolded. Black edges
  with arrows indicate activating regulations and red edges with blunt ends indicate
  inhibiting regulations.
