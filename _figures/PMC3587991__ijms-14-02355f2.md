caption: Chromatin-remodeling factors affect the cell cycle. On one hand, damage signals
  induce deacetylation of p53; in turn, the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein
  4 (CHD4) prevents entry into S phase. On the other hand, CHRAC (CHRomatin accessibility
  complex), ACF1 (ATP-dependent chromatin assembly and remodeling factor 1) and cohesin
  are affected by checkpoint kinases after the ATM signaling pathway is activated
  by DNA damage, which prevents the activation of CDC25 and the transition from G2
  to M.
