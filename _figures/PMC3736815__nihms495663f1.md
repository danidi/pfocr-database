caption: 'An unknown GPCR responds to the presence of a pathogen activating the G
  protein complex, which then activates phospholipase C proteins, stimulating the
  synthesis of the messenger signal DAG (purple phospholipids), which then activates
  TPA-1 and eventually the p38/PMK MAP kinase cascade. This composite figure summarizes
  data regarding signaling in different tissues, and it should be noted that a number
  of components are absent in some tissues; e.g., DKF-2 and TOL-1 are not required
  in the epidermis. Solid arrows represent hypothesized direct interactions between
  the proteins, whereas dashed arrows indicate a suspected pathway that may contain
  other unknown proteins. The families of proteins are color coded as follows: G protein
  subunits, purple; phospholipase C, orange; protein kinase C, dark green; protein
  kinase D, olive green; Tribbles-like kinase, light blue; TIR domain adaptor protein,
  light yellow; the p38/PMK-1 MAP kinase cascade, blue; other proteins involved in
  innate immunity, gray. GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor.'
