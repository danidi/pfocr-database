caption: (A) Changes in TCA cycle metabolism following LPS stimulation with or without
  DCA pretreatment in naïve THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were pretreated with vehicle
  or DCA (30 min) followed by stimulation with LPS (1 μg/ml) as described in . Biochemicals
  in the TCA cycle were measured, and box plots of the levels of selected metabolites
  of the TCA cycle pathway shown. Significant differences were indicated for LPS relative
  to untreated cells (LPS) or DCA pretreatment relative to LPS (DCA+LPS) for each
  corresponding time point. Green boxes indicate a significant difference (p≤0.05)
  between the groups shown. Light green boxes indicate narrowly missed the statistical
  cutoff for significance 0.05<p<0.10; metabolite ratio of <1.00. Red boxes indicate
  a significant difference (p≤0.05) between the groups shown; metabolite ratio of
  ≥1.00. Pink boxes indicate narrowly missed the statistical cutoff for significance
  0.05<p<0.10; metabolite ratio of ≥1.00. N=5. (B-C) Oxygen consumption rate (OCR)
  was measured in THP-1 cells using a MitoXpress-Xtra kit. Data was recorded using
  a SpectraMax M series plate reader for two hours at 380nm excitation and 650nm emission,
  respectively. Slopes were calculated from (B) as OCR based on the manufacturer’s
  instructions. Data (mean ± SEM) are from one experiment (n=4 per group) representative
  of two independent experiments. Values with different letters are statistically
  different (P<0.05). (D-E) Irg1 mRNA and protein expression in THP-1 cells treated
  with or without DCA plus 1μg/ml LPS for indicated time, measured by qPCR (D) and
  western blotting (E).
