caption: Immune responses elicited by Plasmodium infection. During malaria infection,
  different PAMPs secreted from merozoites can be sensed by PRRs and activate the
  innate immunity (left panel). cDCs, macrophages, and pDCs are the crucial innate
  immune cells to defend malaria infection. Within the cytosol of these cells, pathogenic
  RNA interacts with MDA5 and recruits the adaptor protein MAVS, and Plasmodium gDNA
  can be detected by cGAS or other DNA sensors to activate adaptor protein STING.
  Both MAVS and STING could recruit serine/threonine-protein kinase TBK1 to phosphorylate
  IRF3 which translocate to nucleus and induce the expression of IFN-I. Furthermore,
  parasitic nucleic acid gDNA can also be sensed by inflammasome sensors AIM2, whereas
  haemozoin and uric acid activates NLRP3, leading to activation of inflammasomes
  and Caspase-1, which cleave pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to form mature IL-1β and IL-18.
  Besides, parasite glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors to TLRs, including
  TLR2-TLR6 or TLR1-TLR2 heterodimers and TLR4 homodimers. TLRs signal transduces
  through MyD88, which finally causes the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs, and induces
  the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, as well as
  chemokines. Specifically, both CpG and hemozoin-combined gDNA can induce TLR9 translocation,
  and TLR7 can sense parasite RNA in the endosome of pDCs during the early infection
  stage, TLR9 as well as TLR7 recruit adaptor protein MyD88 and kinases TRAFs to phosphorylate
  IRF7 and induce the early robust production of IFN-I. After the innate immune responses,
  DC acts as a vital APC receiving stimulation via cytokines described upon, is activated
  and presents the antigens to naïve T cell through combination of MHC and TCR, which
  builds a bridge between innate and adaptive immunity. During adaptive immunity (right
  panel), naïve T cells differentiate into different subtypes with unique functions
  in anti-malaria immunity. Tfh, Th1, and Th17 could facilitate function of B cells,
  while Treg and IL-10+/IL-27+ CD4+ T cell can suppress B cell function; CD8+ T cells
  mainly express IFN-γ, and leaving function of Th2 is still uncertain. Activated
  DCs can also secrete IL-12 to promote the expression of IFN-γ from NK cell, which
  can enhance function of Th1 and macrophage thus help B cells to secrete antibody.
  Besides, IL-2 produced by Th1 can help NK cell to kill parasites. The diagram depicts
  a simplified version of indicated signaling pathway and immune cells involved in
  anti-malaria immunity. The abbreviations are defined in footnote.
