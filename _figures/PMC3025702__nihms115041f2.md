caption: 'Both PROG and VDH are pleiotropic and affect multiple pathways, which may
  account for their therapeutic effectiveness. Here we show a few of the major pathways
  involved in injury and discussed in this paper, with the general scheme of blue
  as beneficial or protective and red as detrimental. 1. Inflammatory pathways consisting
  of immune cell recruitment and infiltration (macrophages; MΦ), microglial activation
  and inflammatory cytokine release (TNFα and IL-1), and naive T cell (TH0) differentiation
  into pro-inflammatory type 1 (TH1) and anti-inflammatory type 2 (TH2). These processes
  can lead to cell death, edema, and secondary damage; 2. Maintenance of blood-brain
  barrier (BBB) integrity, including modulation of the expression of channels and
  transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) and antioxidant
  protection for both capillary endothelium and astrocytes. Failure of BBB function
  is a key component in the development of edema; 3. Glutamate excitotoxicity, mediated
  primarily by NMDA channels, can be toxic to the cell due to Na+ influx and severe
  depolarization. These effects can be counteracted by Cl- influx through GABAA channels,
  leading to repolarization; 4. The balance of cellular pro- and anti-death mechanisms,
  including release of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial (Bax, BAD, cytochrome c) and anti-apoptotic
  (Bcl-2) proteins, caspase-3 activation, maintenance of ionic and energy balance,
  as well as reduction of Ca2+ influx, which is the final common pathway of most mechanisms
  of cell death including glutamate toxicity. Since the activation of cellular reproductive
  machinery in terminally differentiated neurons can also lead to apoptosis, arrest
  of the cell cycle can also be protective; 5. Upregulation of trophic factors, especially
  NGF and BDNF, which contribute not only to the maintenance of neurons and astrocytes,
  but also oligodendrocytes and myelination; 6. Antioxidant defenses, which reduce
  the damage of immune and endogenously released reactive oxygen species (ROS) to
  cellular components and membranes. L-VSCC: L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channel;
  Na+,K+-ATPase: Na+/K+ active transport pump.'
