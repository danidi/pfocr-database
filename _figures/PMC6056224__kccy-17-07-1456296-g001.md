caption: Imbalanced expression/ activity of RAD18 and Y-family DNA polymerases dictates
  choice of TLS polymerases and can influence replication fidelity and genome stability.
  (A) In normal cells TLS polymerases are activated sparingly and used selectively
  to minimize error-prone DNA synthesis and ensure genome stability. (B) In XPV cells
  lacking functional Polh, compensatory bypass of Polh-cognate lesions by inappropriate
  DNA polymerases leads to mutagenesis. (C) In many cancer cells RAD18 is expressed
  at high levels (sometimes owing to stabilization by its binding partner MAGE-A4),
  leading to increased TLS pathway activation. It is not known whether all Y-family
  DNA polymerases are equally dependent on RAD18 for activation. Differential activation
  of Y-family TLS polymerases by over-active RAD18 would constitute a mechanism of
  imbalance and altered TLS. (D) Over-expression or reduced expression of individual
  TLS polymerases has been reported in many cancers and represents another mechanism
  of TLS pathway imbalance and mutagenesis.
