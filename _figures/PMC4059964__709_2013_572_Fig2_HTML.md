caption: Auxin and its role in protein sorting. a Auxin binding by extracellular ABP1
  (lilac) causes activation of ROP GTPases (purple) and downstream effectors RIC1
  and RIC4 (green). ROP2-RIC4 stimulates F-actin (yellow) accumulation at localized
  domains, which is suggested to antagonize clathrin-mediated endocytosis of plasma
  membrane proteins like PINs. This pathway is antagonized by ROP6-RIC1 activity promoting
  local formation of cortical MT arrays (pink), which interferes with activation of
  ROP2. ROP2 on the other hand sequesters RIC1, thereby blocking formation of ordered
  MT arrays. ICR1, another ROP-interacting protein (light blue) is essential for polarized
  distribution of PIN proteins at the plasma membrane. This involves interaction with
  exocyst vesicle-tethering complex subunit SEC3 (white). b Decisions about endocytic
  sorting and further targeting on PIN proteins into the lytic vacuole depend on putative
  retromer subunit SNX1 (light blue), which functions as a gating factor, promoting
  protein recycling to the plasma membrane and thereby antagonizing vacuolar sorting.
  CLASP-(yellow)-mediated tethering of SNX1 to MTs (pink), links PIN sorting to cytoskeleton
  components and possibly ABP1-mediated signaling. Variations in auxin homeostasis
  sensed by nuclear SCFTIR1/AFB auxin receptor induce vacuolar sorting of PIN proteins.
  Mechanisms and pathways involved are still elusive
