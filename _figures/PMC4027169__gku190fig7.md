caption: (A) Model for roles for the DNA damage checkpoint pathway in suppressing
  extensive LOH and chromosomal rearrangements associated with failed DSB repair.
  The DNA damage checkpoint pathway promotes efficient HR repair. Failed HR leads
  to extensive end processing and to chromosome loss or rearrangements. Rad17 and
  the 9-1-1 complex further suppress break-induced LOH by promoting extensive end
  processing through the centromere, resulting in loss of the broken chromosome. This
  is supported by the findings that Rad17 and the 9-1-1 complex are required for extensive
  resection, removal of the unrepaired broken minichromosome and suppression of extensive
  LOH. (B) Model for the roles of the DNA damage checkpoint proteins and Exo1 in facilitating
  extensive resection in S. pombe. Following DSB induction, the 9-1-1 complex (ring)
  is loaded by Rad17. The 9-1-1 complex facilitates processivity of Exo1 and nuclease
  X. Rad3ATR, together with other checkpoint proteins (not shown), promotes dNTP synthesis,
  promotes nuclease X and additionally inhibits Exo1. This model is supported by the
  findings that the rad3Δ exo1Δ double mutant phenocopies the DSB repair profile of
  rad17Δ, leading to high levels of extensive LOH and low levels of minichromosome
  loss, while rad3Δ or exo1Δ do not; as exo1Δ was not equivalent to rad17Δ or loss
  of the 9-1-1 complex, this suggests that the 9-1-1 complex additionally provides
  processivity to another nuclease (X), which requires Rad3 for activity. All checkpoint
  genes tested are required for transactivating Cdt2 expression, an initial step in
  damage-induced dNTP synthesis. See the text for details.
