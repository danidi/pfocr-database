caption: 'a) Cartoon depicting the FoxO1 network involved in the regulation of cell
  cycle progression and cellular senescence: FoxO1 arrests the cell cycle by repressing
  activators (cyclinD1, cyclinD2) and inducing inhibitors (cdkn1a/p21, cdkn1b/p27,
  cdkn2b/p15Ink4b, cdkn1c/p57) [PMID: 10102273; PMID: 17873901]. cdkn1a/p21 and cdkn2b/p15Ink4b
  activation, a sign of cellular senescence [PMID: 17667954], is regulated by FoxO1
  through direct interaction with Skp2 protein. In turn, Skp2 blocks FoxO1 and, together
  with CKS1b, CDK1 and CDK2, triggers the direct degradation of cdkn1a/p21 and cdkn1b/p27,
  thus promoting proliferation [PMID: 15668399]. FoxO proteins are inhibited mainly
  through PI3K/AKT-mediated phosphorylation [PMID: 10102273, PMID: 12621150, PMID:
  21708191, PMID: 10217147, PMID: 17604717]: PDK1, the master kinase of the pathway,
  stimulates cell proliferation and survival by directly activating AKT, which phosphorylates
  (inhibits) the FoxOs [PMID: 10698680, PMID: 19635472]. PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 circuit requires
  active TGFβ/SMAD signaling [PMID: 24238962, PMID: 15084259] in order to co-regulate
  cdkn1a/p21-dependent cell senescence. Active TGFβ signaling downregulates the BMP
  pathway downstream effectors ID1 and ID2, known to promote dedifferentiation and
  proliferation during embryogenesis and cancer progression, probably through cdkn2b/p15Ink4b
  regulation [PMID: 11840321, PMID: 16034366]. b) β-cell ablation in adults triggers
  FoxO1 upregulation and the subsequent cell cycle arrest in δ-cells.'
