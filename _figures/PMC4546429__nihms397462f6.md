caption: Induction and function of SigR regulon in comparison with mammalian anti-oxidative
  Nrf2-Keap1 system. SigR regulon is induced in response to thiol-reactive oxidants
  and electrophilic compounds, through inactivation of antisigma RsrA by forming intramolecular
  disulphide bond. Nrf2 regulon is induced by similar stressors, through inactivation
  of inhibitory factor Keap1 that facilitates degradation of Nrf2, by forming multiple
  intra- and inter-molecular disulphide bonds, and S-alkylation. Functions of SigR
  target genes overlap with those of Nrf2 targets to a large extent, which include
  thiol redox homeostasis, small thiol-mediated detoxification, protein quality control,
  and pentose phosphate pathway for generating NADPH. The scheme for Nrf2 activation
  mechanism is simplified to highlight analogy with SigR-RsrA (; ).
