caption: Our model predicts that topiramate is capable of stimulating GABA receptors
  in the palate to upregulate TGFβ1 expression. TGFβ1 expression is tightly regulated
  during craniofacial morphogenesis. Dysregulation of TGFβ1 signaling can lead to
  altered expression of genes associated with orofacial clefts. For example, we show
  that topiramate leads to upregulation of SOX9 expression, which is sufficient to
  result in cleft palate in mice. In order to gather corroborating evidence for the
  upregulation of TGFβ signaling from the 39 (excluding TGFβ) differentially expressed
  gene products, we performed a manual curation of the literature for connectivity
  to TGFβ1. Our analysis revealed that changes in an additional seven (18%) of the
  proteins are consistent with upregulation of TGFβ1 signaling. Moreover, these molecules
  affect TGFβ1 signaling both upstream and downstream of the TGFβ1 ligand, suggesting
  a concerted global upregulation of the pathway. The solid-colored molecules are
  from the antibody-array or western blot results, while the spotted molecules are
  changes in upstream effectors predicted from literature. Citation number (#) corresponds
  to listed references.
