caption: Model for regulation of trophectoderm (TE) lineage specification by mevalonate
  pathway. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGCR) converts
  HMG-CoA into mevalonic acid (MVA), which is transformed into farnesyl pyrophosphate
  (FPP) and then into geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Geranylgeranyl transferase
  (GGTase) attaches the geranylgeranyl (GG) moiety of GGPP onto RHO. Geranylgeranylated
  RHO becomes active by binding to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is essential
  for apical-basal cell polarization. Proper apical-basal cell polarity is required
  to suppress HIPPO signaling, which leads to nuclear localization of YAP. YAP forms
  a complex with TEAD4, and acts as a transcriptional activator, which directly or
  indirectly up-regulates transcription of trophectoderm-specific genes, Cdx2 and
  Gata3. See the text for further discussion on this model.
