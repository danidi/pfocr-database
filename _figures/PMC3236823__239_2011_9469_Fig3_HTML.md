caption: 'Evolutionary reconstruction of the ancestral TOR signaling pathway based
  on the evolutionary reconstruction of the AGC kinase ancestral genes of S6K, RSK1,
  PKB and SGK1. a Simplified representation of the phylogenetic tree of the AGC kinases
  (see Figure S3). Species indication: Hs Homo sapiens, Sc S. cerevisiae, Sp S. pombe,
  At A. thaliana. b Reconstruction of TOR signaling in the animal ancestor. An AGC
  kinase duplicated in the ancestor of animals and choanoflagellates to give rise
  to PKB and SGK. SGK lost the ability to inhibit TSC2. New signaling inputs were
  invented in the animal ancestor, among which is the insulin signaling. c TOR signaling
  in the ancestor of animals and fungi. An AGC kinase duplicated in the ancestor of
  animals and fungi (Opisthokont ancestor) that give rise to S6K and RSK. The duplication
  was followed by subsequent sub-functionalization of ancestral functions between
  the two paralogs. d TOR signaling in LECA. The duplication of the ancestral AGC
  kinase that give rise to the RSK-S6K and PKB-SGK ancestral precursor genes corresponds
  to the differential activation by either TORC1 or TORC2, respectively. e Reconstruction
  of pre-LECA TOR signaling. The shared subunits TOR and LST8 of both TOR complexes
  suggest that before LECA there was at one point only one proto-TOR complex. As the
  AGC kinases also share single ancestry we can reduce the complexity of the TOR pathway
  in pre-LECA even further'
