caption: A proposed schematic presentation of SiO2NP-induced stress response signalling
  pathway. SiO2NP enter the cells by endocytosis and activate the SAPK pathway. Activated
  JNK and p38 further trigger the nuclear translocation of transcription factor ATF-2
  with a consequent induction of stress response signalling pathways.
