caption: Schematic view of the role of lysosomes in the autophagy pathway. Cellular
  substrates that need to be degraded are engulfed by a double-membrane compartment,
  the autophagosome, whichis formed by integrating various signals. The autophagosome
  fuses with lysosome, forming an autolysosome allowing the degradation of cellular
  substrates by hydrolytic enzymes. Upon degradation step, recycling of lysosome membrane
  leads to formation of new proto-lysosomes that can maturate into functional lysosomes.
  The latter are at the crossroad of signaling pathways regulating the autophagy–lysosome
  pathway. The proteins indicated in red are encoded by genes mutated in rare neurodegenerative
  diseases, highlighting the critical role of this pathway for these disorders. AP4,
  adaptor complex 4 subunits; CaN, calcineurin; CTSD, cathepsin D; GBA1, glucocerebrosidase;
  GNPTAB, N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase; GLB1, β-galactosidase; GRN, granulin;
  HTT, huntingtin; OPTN, optineurin.
