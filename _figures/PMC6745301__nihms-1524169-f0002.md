caption: miR-155 inhibition results in the increased expression of miR-155 target
  proteins SMAD-1 and SMAD5 (components of BMP signaling pathway), Rictor (mTOR pathway),
  eNOS (NO pathway), Rheb (activates Akt/ZO-1 pathway), which support microvascular
  function and strengthen the BBB integrity. Upregulation of other miR-155 targets,
  such as SOCS-1 and SHIP-1 (which suppress JAK/STAT-mediated cytokine signaling),
  and C/EBP (which activates anti-inflammatory IL-10), regulate post-stroke neuroinflammation
  and thus, support vascular integrity and neuronal survival. As a result, miR-155
  inhibitor-induced support of BBB integrity leads to the reduction of brain edema,
  restoration blood flow in the peri-infarct area of stroke, and prevents delayed
  neuronal death in the peri-infarct area. This results in the reduced brain infarct,
  neuroprotection and improved functional recovery. Red font/arrow indicate upregulation/activation;
  blue - downregulation/inhibition.
