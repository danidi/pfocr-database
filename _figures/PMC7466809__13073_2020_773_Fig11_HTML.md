caption: Overview of the involvement of LINC00301 in NSCLC. Schematic representation
  of our proposed model of FOXC1 upregulates LINC00301 expression, the latter partially
  mediates oncogenic effects through its epigenetic silencing of EAF2 expression by
  directly binding with EZH2 to mediate HIF1α activation in the nucleus and by acting
  as ceRNA for miR-1276 to increase HIF1α expression in the cytoplasm in NSCLC

papertitle: FOXC1-mediated LINC00301 facilitates tumor progression and triggers an immune-suppressing
  microenvironment in non-small cell lung cancer by regulating the HIF1α pathway.
