caption: Hallmarks of DNA damage following heavy-ion irradiation. Schematic diagram
  for how heavy-ion irradiation induced complex DNA lesions and chromosome rearrangements
  led to cell death or senescence-like growth arrest (SLGA). (1) High-LET heavy-ion
  radiation causes clustered DSBs along the particle track. (2) In addition, high-LET
  heavy-ion radiation causes complex DNA lesions, which contain DSBs, SSBs and/or
  base damage within 1–2 helical turns. These types of damage are rarely observed
  in X-ray–irradiated cells. (3) We identified the formation of clustered DSBs at
  the chromosome boundaries along the particle track. The formation of clustered DSBs
  at the chromosome boundaries can be a critical risk for chromosomal rearrangements
  such as dicentrics, translocations and large deletions. The two major types of deletion
  (i.e. interstitial deletion and terminal deletion) are induced by IR. Small chromosome
  fragments are produced following interstitial deletion if multiple DSBs in close
  proximity occur in a single chromosome. Because these fragments can be recognized
  as DSBs and are not readily repaired, the persistent fragments activate cell cycle
  checkpoint arrest, apoptosis, or SLGA. High-LET radiation produces such interstitial
  deletion-derived fragments more frequently than X-ray irradiations, because clustered
  DSBs are generated along the particle track. In general, chromosome rearrangements
  including dicentrics, translocations and large deletions induce cell death or SLGA
  in the first mitosis or after the mitosis. In contrast, interstitial deletions,
  followed by the formation of fragments, cause cell death and/or SLGA in non-dividing
  cells. In future work, it will be important to elucidate the impact of complex DNA
  lesions on cell fate, i.e. whether a high level of resection or the existence of
  unrepairable damage due to complex DNA lesions affects chromosome rearrangement,
  cell death and SLGA.

  description: Hallmarks of DNA damage following heavy-ion irradiation. Schematic
    diagram for how heavy-ion irradiation induced complex DNA lesions and chromosome
