caption: The calcium channels in T cells. T cell receptor (TCR) engagement by a peptide-MHC
  on an antigen presenting cell (APC), induces protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) to
  activate phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) from plasma membrane phospholipids to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3). Elevated levels of IP3 in the cytosol leads to the release of Ca2+ from IP3R
  Ca2+ channels located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ca2+ depletion from the
  ER induces Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space through the plasma membrane
  channel, ORAI1. Several auxiliary channels also operate during TCR-mediated Ca2+signaling.
  These include plasma membrane IP3R activated by the ligand IP3, transient receptor
  potential (TRP) channels that can be operated by DAG and store-operated Ca2+ entry
  (SOCE), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) responsive purinergic P2 (P2X) receptors, glutamate
  mediated N-methyl-D-aspartate activated (NMDA) channels, and voltage-dependent Ca2+
  channels (CaV1) that may be regulated through TCR signaling events. The mitochondria
  also control cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels. Increase in intracellular Ca2+ results in
  activation of calmodulin-calcineurin pathway that induces nuclear factor of activated
  T cells (NFAT) nuclear translocation and transcription of target genes to direct
  T cell homeostasis, activation, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Within
  this complex network of Ca2+signaling, a model of the reciprocal regulation of CaV1
  and ORAI1 in T cells has been proposed. (A) Low-level TCR signaling through interactions
  with self-antigens (i.e., self-peptides/self-MHC molecules) may result in CaV1 (particularly
  CaV1.4) activation and Ca2+ influx from outside the cell. This allows for filling
  of intracellular stores and initiation of a signaling cascade to activate a pro-survival
  program within the naïve T cell. Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is not activated
  in this scenario and, consequently, ORAI1 remains closed. (B) Strong TCR signaling
  through engagement by a foreign peptide-MHC induces the downstream signaling events
  that result in ER Ca2+ store depletion and STIM1 accumulation in puncta in regions
  of the ER near the plasma membrane allowing interactions with Ca2+ channels. ORAI1
  enhances STIM1 recruitment to the vicinity of CaV1 channels. Here, STIM1 can activate
  ORAI1 while inhibiting CaV1. PKC, protein kinase C. AP-1, activating protein-1.
