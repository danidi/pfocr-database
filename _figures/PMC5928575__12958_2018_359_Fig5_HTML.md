caption: 'a PGE2 mediates early implantation. a Upon ovulation, PGE2 is secreted by
  the following reproductive organs: ovaries, endometrium and oviduct, as well as
  the embryo. EP2 induces LH receptor expression on the corpus luteum to secrete P4
  and stimulate its continuous release into the in utero-ovarian circulation. P4 exerts
  positive feedback to the ovaries, endometrium and oviduct to recognize and maintain
  the ongoing implantation and embryo development. Via EP4, PGE2 increases the activity
  of adenylate cyclase (AC) and nitric oxide synthase (OS) successivelyto increase
  synthesis and nitric oxide (NO) release. NO, a vasodilator, increases the utero-ovarian
  blood flow and the concentration of pro-pregnancy factors. Additionally, E2 secreted
  by the embryo and endometrium stimulates PGE2/EP2 to increase the secretion of P4
  and inhibits PGFS and CRB1, enzymes involved in the synthesis of PGF2α, an antagonist
  of PGE2. b In endometrial cells with EP2 receptors, PGE2 stimulates the expression
  of CXCR4 via the EGFR-PI3K/ERK1/2 pathway. CXCR4 is bound by the chemokine CXCL12,
  which is secreted by the embryo. PGE2 also stimulates the EGFR-PI3K/ERK1/2 pathway
  to induce the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation
  and uterine receptivity'
