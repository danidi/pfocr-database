caption: Proposed working model. In addition to activating P2X1 receptor on BSM, parasympathetically
  released ATP during micturition will also be converted to ADP quickly, which further
  activates P2Y12R, and inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity to decrease intracellular
  cAMP level. This will cause BSM contraction by an unknown mechanism and may also
  potentiate P2X-mediated BSM contraction force, possibly by inhibiting adenosine-mediated
  relaxation. ADP will be further converted by Entpd1 and Nt5e on BSM to adenosine,
  which binds to adenosine receptors and activates adenylyl cyclase to increase intracellular
  cAMP level, and eventually relaxes BSM after urinary voiding. Thus, adenylyl cyclase
  may function as a key protein and common pathway for the crosstalk between P2Y12R
  and adenosine receptors, and Entpd1 and Nt5e may serve as the temporal regulators
  for the crosstalk between P2Y12R and adenosine receptors. The dynamic interplay
  of these positive and negative signals may play a crucial role in modulating BSM
  purinergic contractility and could result in disordered bladder contractility when
  disrupted.
