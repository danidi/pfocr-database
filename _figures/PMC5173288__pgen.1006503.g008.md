caption: (A) A 48h NP assay was performed in bsk-overexpressing neurons. The green
  line indicates a stabilized dendrite. Statistical significance was determined by
  a Fisher’s exact test and the numbers above the bars indicate numbers of neurons
  analyzed. *** p<0.001. Control data is from . (B) Axon regeneration assays were
  performed in neurons overexpressing bsk paired with either mCD8-RFP or Nmnat RNAi.
  UAS-mCD8-RFP was expressed as a control for Nmnat RNAi to keep the number of UAS-controlled
  transgenes constant and rule out Gal4 dilution effects. Red arrows mark sites of
  axon injury. The green star indicates the tip of the converted dendrite. Statistical
  significance was determined by a Mann-Whitney test. Error bars represent SD. ***
  p<0.001. (C) A summary model of the results is shown. Axon injury activates the
  DLK/bsk/fos response pathway. The AP-1 transcription factor fos turns on early injury
  responses that include Nmnat-mediated NP (indicated by darker cell outline in middle
  image), microtubule dynamics (short green lines in middle image) and mitochondrial
  fission. NP is mediated by Nmnat, which, if unchecked dampens subsequent regeneration.
  Caspases and mitochondrial fission counteract NP. (D) Reduction of caspases, increased
  bsk or fos, or increased Nmnat result in excess or longer than normal NP. Unbalanced
  NP dampens regeneration.
