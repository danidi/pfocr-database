caption: A Scheme summarizing events of mango fruit response to storage at sub-optimal
  temperature. Upon storage at sub-optimal temperature, fruit sense the chilling stress
  and initiate cold stress signal transduction pathway. A cascade of signaling molecules
  (Ca2+, ROS) act as secondary messengers and activates several kinases (CDPK, MAPK),
  which activates transcription factors (WRKY) and further activate stress response.
  Ultimately, a wide range of stress responses were activated, such as phenylpropanoid
  pathway that produces phenols, which is transported from the resin-duct to the lenticel,
  and cell death that accumulate in the same lenticel lumen and is tightly correlated
  to the later increase in decay. Chilling stress response also activates sugar metabolism
  for osmolytes synthesis and phospholipid metabolism that leads to synthesis of PA,
  which is known to activate CDPK and MAPK signaling and stress response.
