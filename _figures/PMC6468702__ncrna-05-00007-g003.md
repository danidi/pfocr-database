caption: 'Sub-genomic flavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) impair cellular response to viral infection.
  (A) Biogenesis of sfRNAs. A pseudoknot-stabilized three junction helix is formed
  in the 3′ UTR of flaviviral genomes. This blocks the 5′ to 3′ processing and nucleolytic
  activity of the exonuclease XRN1, which triggers accumulation of sfRNAs in the cell.
  (B) Functions of sfRNAs. The accumulation of sfRNAs impacts several cellular pathways
  which can favor viral infection: in one mechanism, stalling at the sfRNA pseudoknots
  sequesters XRN1 away from its usual targets decreasing mRNA decay, including decay
  of transcripts involved in the antiviral response. This further could contribute
  to the cytokine storm observed upon infection. In another mechanism a high amount
  of sfRNAs saturates Dicer and consequently inhibits the RNAi/miRNA pathway. sfRNAs
  have also been reported to accumulate in stress granules and interact with CAPRIN1,
  G3BP2, and G3BP1 that are important for translation of ISG mRNAs. Finally, sfRNAs
  may interfere directly with the PRR mediated IFN-I activation pathway. RIG-I is
  a central component of PRR signaling and is activated by ubiquitination via TRIM25
  upon infection. sfRNAs have been shown to directly bind TRIM25 and by doing so preventing
  the ubiquitination of RIG-I. This in turn would lead to a dampened IFN response.'
