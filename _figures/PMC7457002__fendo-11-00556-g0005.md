caption: ATF3 plays a vital role in breast cancer. ATF3 expression is increased by
  TGFβ. Furthermore, ATF3 upregulates the expression of some genes involved in tumor
  metastasis, including MMP13, fibronectin, TWIST1, Slug and Snail in the MCF10CA1a
  cells. Overexpression of miR-590-3p decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis
  via downregulation of the expression of ATF3 and Runx2 in MDA-MB231 cells. In addition,
  ATF-3 inhibits miR-590-3p expression to regulate miR-590/GOLPH3 pathway, and thus
  modulates proliferation of breast cancer cells. ATF3 was shown to be involved in
  radioresistance of breast cancer via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. These observations
  show that ATF3 acts as an important regulator in breast cancer.
