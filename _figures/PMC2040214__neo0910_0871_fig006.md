caption: 'Hypothetical model of Noxa and Mcl-1 in the regulation of CPT-induced apoptosis.
  CPT activates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which, in turn, induces upregulation of
  both Noxa and Mcl-1. Although the upregulation of Noxa through transcriptional factor
  CREB has been elucidated in this study, the transcription factor responsible for
  CPT-induced Mcl-1 has not yet been identified. Nonetheless, based on the findings
  that Noxa can interact with Mcl-1 in the presence of CPT, Noxa/Mcl-1 balance model
  may be borrowed to explain the susceptibility of cells to CPT-induced apoptosis:
  when the concentration of proapoptotic protein Noxa exceeds that of antiapoptotic
  protein Mcl-1, CPT-induced apoptosis occurs (①); however, when Mcl-1 takes the upper
  hand, more free Mcl-1 will ultimately lead to CPT resistance (②).'
