caption: Paradigm shift in sepsis. In 1991, sepsis was defined as Systemic Inflammatory
  Response Syndrome (SIRS), which was caused by microbial infections. This definition
  emphasizes the concept that systemic inflammation is the key to sepsis. During the
  initial phases of sepsis, inflammation originating in the innate immune system is
  enhanced by multiple pathways as “cytokine storm”. Then, a new theory has since
  emerged positing that immunosuppression following initial hyperinflammation, eventually
  leading to prolonged and significant immunosuppression is the key pathophysiology.
  In terms of paired words, SIRS and compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome
  (CARS) symbolize this paradigm. In 2016, The Third International Consensus Definitions
  for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defined sepsis as life-threatening organ
  dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Both pro-inflammatory
  and anti-inflammatory genomic storms occur beginning in the earliest stages of infection,
  and the balance between the two determines whether clinically over-inflammation
  or immunosuppression then occurs. Persistent Inflammation, Immunosuppression, and
  Catabolism Syndrome (PICS) is an intriguing concept from the integrated point of
  view, which contends that SIRS and its counterpart CARS do not exist independently;
  rather, both are occurring simultaneously. As shown in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign
  guidelines, initial fluid resuscitation, earlier antibiotic administration and supportive
  care such as mechanical ventilation strategies, nutrition and PADIS (Pain, Agitation,
  Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep) management are key of sepsis management. With the
  development of these conventional basic treatment, there is an overall clinical
  outcome improvement, but mortality of sepsis still reaches high. Therefore, additional
  treatment method that targets the underlying essence of sepsis has been expected.
  At first, as sepsis was essentially understood as hyperinflammation, many anti-inflammation
  approaches were tried. However, none have demonstrated that those sepsis treatment
  strategies are effective. Then, focusing on the immunoparalytic aspect of sepsis,
  immune stimulation represents a new strategy for targeting sepsis. There are some
  promising molecules, among them PD-1/PD-L inhibitors, which can not only reverse
  immuostimulation but act as immunomodulation, are highly expected.
