caption: m6A is involved in viral replicationSchematic representation of the intersection
  between m6A pathway and viral replication. Blue lines represent methylation, red
  lines represent demethylation and green lines indicate m6A reader proteins. A. Writers,
  erasers, and readers in the m6A pathway influence HIV RNA transport, stability,
  and translation, in both nucleus and cytoplasm. B. m6A pathway regulates viruses
  that replicate in the cytoplasm. ALKBH5, alkB homolog 5; FTO, fat mass and obesity-associated
  protein; HCV, hepatitis C virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; METTL3, methyltransferase
  like 3; YTHDF, YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein; ZIKV, Zika virus.
