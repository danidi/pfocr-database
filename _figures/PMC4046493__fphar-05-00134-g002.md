caption: Model of the effect of the A2AAR/NO/VEGF signaling pathway in cell migration
  and proliferation during preeclampsia. Late-onset preeclampsia (A) is associated
  with elevated activation of A2A adenosine receptor, characterized by high (↑) eNOS
  activation, NO formation, and nitrotyrosine formation (Y-nitration), associated
  with enhancement of cell proliferation and migration. On the other hand, early-onset
  preeclampsia (B) is associated with a reduction (↓) in the abundance of A2A adenosine
  receptor, which in turn could be reduced with a decline in eNOS activation, NO formation,
  and Y-nitration and might explain the reduced HUVEC migration and proliferation
  observed in this disease. Despite this hypothesis, it is unclear (?) whether NO
  generated by A2A stimulation can modulate the expression or activation of VEGF or
  activate other signaling pathways involved in cell migration and proliferation in
  early-onset preeclampsia.
