caption: Role of the citrate pathway in Behçet's syndrome (BS). In BS cells, different
  triggers induce an increase of the SLC25A1 and ACLY transcription rate. The citrate
  carrier (CIC)—SLC25A1 encoded protein—exports citrate from mitochondria to the cytosol
  where it is cleaved by ACLY into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. Both the metabolites
  support the production of the inflammatory mediators.
