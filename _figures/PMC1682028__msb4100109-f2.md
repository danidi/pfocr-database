caption: (A) Schematic flow chart of 13C-based metabolic flux analysis. Exemplary
  results for flux ratios and absolute fluxes are given in the bottom boxes. (B) Example
  of inferring relative fluxes through the three initial pathways of glucose catabolism
  in E. coli from mass spectrometry data. A positional label is introduced by feeding
  [1-13C]glucose, and 13C-pattern are detected in alanine, which derives its carbon
  backbone directly from pyruvate. Although unique isotope pattern occurs in intact
  alanine molecules, the lack of positional information in the detected mass distribution
  cannot discriminate between glycolysis and the ED pathway. For discrimination of
  these two pathways, additionally the C2–C3 moiety of alanine must be analyzed, which
  occurs by fragmentation in some MS instruments. For flux ratios, the relative contribution
  of these pathways to the formation of alanine (pyruvate) is calculated directly
  from the detected abundance of the different mass isotope isomers by probabilistic
  equations. For absolute fluxes, a best-fit flux solution is obtained by extensive
  computations that seek to minimize the error between fitted intracellular fluxes
  not only to the six shown, but also to all other detected mass spectra and physiological
  uptake and production rates.
