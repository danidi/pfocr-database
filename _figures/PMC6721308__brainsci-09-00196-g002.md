caption: Distribution of the genes significantly modulated in the Alzheimer’s disease
  pathway. The red background represents proteins encoded by upregulated genes in
  SH-SY5Y-Aβ-αT. The blue background represents proteins encoded by downregulated
  genes in SH-SY5Y-Aβ-αT. The green background represents proteins encoded by both
  upregulated and downregulated genes in SH-SY5Y-Aβ-αT. The white background indicates
  that there was no statistical difference in the level of gene expression. APP, amyloid
  precursor protein; ADAM17, ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17; RTN4, Reticulon 4; PSEN2,
  presenilin 2; APH1B, aph-1 homolog B, gamma-secretase subunit; APAF1, apoptotic
  peptidase activating factor 1. BACE, beta-secretase 1; CytC, cytochrome C; Cx I,
  complex I; Cx II, complex II; Cx III, complex III; Cx IV, complex IV; Cx V, complex
  V.
