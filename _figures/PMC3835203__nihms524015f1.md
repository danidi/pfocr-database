caption: The activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by its typical stimuli such as ATP,
  toxin and crystalline reagents involve mitochondria-derived signals such as mROS,
  mtDNA and cadiolipin. The relocalization of NLRP3 form the cytosol to mitochondria
  is MAVS-dependent and is pivotal for optimal inflammasome activation. GBP5 promotes
  NLRP3 signaling to ASC. ER stress has been reported to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome
  through a mechanism that seems not to require the typical unfolded protein response
  pathway. Elevated intracellular Ca2+ and/or decreased intracellular K+ are required
  for NLRP3 inflammasome activation.
