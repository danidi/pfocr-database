caption: P. gingivalis exploits its fimbrial-mediated interaction with macrophage
  TLR2 to activate the high-affinity conformation of CR3. This pathway proceeds through
  Rac1/PI3K-mediated inside-out signaling and requires CD14 for facilitating the fimbria-TLR2
  interaction (; ). TLR2 stimulation by P. gingivalis also induces NF-κB activation
  and cytokine production (; ). Upon CR3 activation, fimbriated P. gingivalis can
  readily interact with CR3 leading to outside-in signaling, which via ERK1/2 downregulates
  IL-12 p35 and p40 and consequently inhibits production of bioactive (p70) IL-12
  (). This in turn undermines IL-12-mediated immune clearance, leading to persistence
  of the pathogen and enhanced virulence in the mouse periodontitis model (). Moreover,
  CR3 uptake of P. gingivalis promotes its intracellular persistence in macrophages
  ().
