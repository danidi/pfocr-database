caption: c-MET transactivation. The potency and endurance of c-MET-triggered pathways
  is secured by a network of upstream signaling co-receptors that physically associate
  with c-MET at the cell surface. c-MET membrane partners can then amplify and/or
  diversify c-MET-dependent biochemical inputs and translate them into meaningful
  (and specific) biological outcomes. The v6 splice variant of the hyaluronan receptor
  CD44 links c-MET signaling to the actin cytoskeleton via the growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2 (GRB2) and the ezrin, radixin, moesin (ERM) family of proteins in order
  to recruit son of sevenless (SOS), which then amplifies RAS-ERK signaling. Intercellular
  adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) can substitute for CD44v6 as a co-receptor for c-MET
  in CD44v6 knockout mice, resulting in similar c-MET pathway activation. c-MET binding
  to integrin α6β4 creates a supplementary docking platform for the binding of signaling
  adaptors, leading to specific enhancement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
  RAS and SRC activation. c-MET can also be activated by G-protein coupled receptors
  (GPCRs), although the functional outcome of this interaction is not well characterized.
  Crosstalk between c-MET and other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) has also been
  studied in great depth because of its potential importance in the development of
  resistance to cancer therapeutics. Examples of these RTKs include the semaphorin
  receptors, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptors, the
  recepteur d'origine nantais (RON), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)
  and Axl; the list continues to grow. Adapted from  and Corso et al. [2005] HGF,
