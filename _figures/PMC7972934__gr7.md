caption: Mechanistic illumination of the inhibitory role of VB in GBMVB promotes the
  expression of miR-7-5p in GBM cells and facilitates the delivery of miR-7-5p by
  exosomes to recipient GBM cells. Then miR-7-5p inhibits GBM cell proliferation,
  migration, invasion, and microtubule formation in vitro as well as retarding the
  tumorigenesis and metastasis of GBM in vivo by inhibiting the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway.
