caption: Arrows indicate the flow of association. A (exposure) is pre-percutaneous
  coronary intervention (PCI) fractional flow reserve (FFR), the origin of the association
  in which we are interested in. M (mediator), post-PCI FFR, is a variable that may
  modify the exposure-outcome association. Y (outcome) is target vessel failure (TVF),
  a primary end point of this study. L represents a set of confounders. Pathways a
  (effect of low pre-PCI FFR on TVF if effect of pre-PCI FFR on post-PCI FFR were
  blocked) and bc (low pre-PCI FFR on TVF when controlling pre-PCI FFR and changing
  post-PCI FFR status from the level it would have been at low pre-PCI FFR) indicate
  the direct and indirect pathway from the exposure to the outcome, respectively.
  CKD indicates chronic kidney disease; and MI, myocardial infarction.
