caption: Cellular pathways involved in the synthesis, folding, secretion, trafficking,
  clearance and neurotoxicity of the prion protein. During synthesis, immature PrP
  is proteolytically processed in the amino- and carboxy-terminus signal peptide sequence
  in the ER, and GPI membrane anchor is added. After its transit through the Golgi
  compartment, mature glycosylations are attached to the protein, and PrP is exported
  to the cell surface. During the normal cycle, PrP can be internalized by endocytosis
  and re-targeted to the plasma membrane or delivered to degradation in lysosomes.
  A fraction of PrPC is usually misfolded during this process, undergoing degradation
  through the proteasome pathway. Scrapie infection triggers PrPSC generation at the
  plasma membrane and in early endocytic vesicles. PrPSC may trigger ER stress due
  to intracellular accumulation or proteasomal dysfunction. Extensive ER stress activates
  specific cell death pathways, which are negatively regulated by different components
  of the UPR including Grp58 and many other chaperones, folding enzymes and formation
  of aggresomes.
