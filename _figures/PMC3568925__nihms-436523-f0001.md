caption: (A) Proposed biosynthetic pathway from prephenate to the dipeptide antibiotic
  bacilysin via a previously identified ex-H2HPP intermediate. Dashed arrow represents
  the unknown identity of the proposed expoxidase. (B) BacABGF action on prephenate
  yields two diastereomers of H4Tyr with differing stereochemistry at the C4 position.
  (Inset) Proposed bacilysin biosynthetic gene cluster present in B. subtilis PY79.
