caption: 'The role of gut microbiota in the development of T1D. Gut flora can affect
  islet autoimmunity through mechanisms: 1) expression of autoantigen mimicry to activate
  autoreactive T cells by antigen-presenting cells to destruct islet beta cells; 2)
  generating metabolites, such as acetate, butyrate etc, to induce the differentiation
  or migration of regulatory T cells to control autoreactivity through GPCR signaling
  pathway (such as Gpr43); 3) gut bacteria-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns
  (PAMP) activate TLR signaling pathway to initiate the inflammation, which activates
  autoreactive T cells and/or directly cause injury to beta cells through inflammatory
  cytokines; 4) gut bacteria can penetrate the leaky gut and cause inflammation to
  destruct beta cells.'
