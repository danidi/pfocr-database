caption: The end replication and protection problems. In somatic cells each round
  of cell division leads to telomere shortening due to the inability of the replication
  machinery to complete replication of the lagging strand (end replication problem).
  When telomeres become critically short they are unable to form the protective t-loop
  which triggers a DNA damage response due to the telomere uncapping (end protection
  problem). In normal cells this results in cell senescence or cell death. However,
  in p53 defective cells telomere uncapping leads to chromosome end-to-end fusions
  and genomic instability and ultimately cell crisis. Survivors that overcome crisis
  do so by up-regulating telomerase (90% of cancer cells) or by activating the alternative
  lengthening of telomeres pathway (ALT, 10% of cancer cells) to maintain telomere
  lengths.
