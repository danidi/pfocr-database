caption: Rho1-mediated actomyosin contractility during egg chamber elongation and
  model for Pak's role. Pak functions to both promote and restrict MLC phosphorylation.
  (A) During early oogenesis Pak acts as a positive contributor to MLC phosphorylation,
  probably functioning as an MLCK. This function is inhibited by the MLC phosphatase
  Flw. (B) During later stages of oogenesis, Pak restricts MLC phosphorylation, counteracting
  the Rho1 actomyosin contractility pathway. Consistent with the literature on mammalian
  Pak, this could be occurring through negative regulation of an MLCK (1). Another
  possibility is that Pak negatively regulates Rok (2). Pak likely also controls the
  distribution of MLC phosphorylation by regulating RhoGEF2 localization (3).
