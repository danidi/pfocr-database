caption: Modification of NK-92 with CD22 ligands through glycoengineering. Two methods
  have been developed. Method A is metabolic glycoengineering using a sialic acid
  derivative, e.g., MPB-sia 1, which could be metabolized onto the surface of NK-92
  cell through the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway. Method B uses a glyco-polymer
  containing MPB-sia, which could insert into the NK-92 cell membrane presumably because
  of its amphiphilicity. Both approaches could enhance the ability of targeting and
  binding of NK-92 cells toward CD22 positive cells resulting in more effective lysis
  of target cancer cells.
