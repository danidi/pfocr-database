caption: A model of functions of the checkpoint clamp and clamp loader in crossover
  formation.A model of functions of the checkpoint clamp and clamp loader in crossover
  formation. Four possible pathways of meiotic recombination are shown. Rad51 and
  Dmc1 cooperate in pathways that display interhomolog bias (three leftmost pathways).
  Together with Rad51–Dmc1, the 9-1-1 clamp and Mec1 suppress intersister and ectopic
  recombination (right pathway). ZMM proteins specifically promote the ‘crossover-only’
  pathway (third pathway from the left) by processing interhomolog joint molecules
  – this depends on Hop1–Red1–Mek1. The 9-1-1 clamp, but not Mec1, facilitates ZMM
  function on the crossover-only pathway. ZMM proteins might also promote intersister
  joint molecule formation. Non-crossover formation is independent of ZMM proteins
  (the leftmost pathway). Even in the absence of ZMM function, interhomolog joint
  molecules are formed (the second pathway from the left). In this pathway, joint
  molecules are resolved into either crossover or NCO.
