caption: Overview of human adenovirus induced cell signaling and downstream immune
  responses in human keratocytes, highlighting the centrality of Src kinase. Following
  engagement with the primary receptor (CD46 or GD1α) by the viral fiber protein and
  secondary engagement of the penton base with the αVβ1 or αVβ3 integrins, group D
  adenoviruses are internalized via Src-dependent, caveolin-mediated endocytosis.
  Following uncoating and fiber shedding, virions traffic along the microtubule network,
  through the microtubule organizing center (MTOC), and the viral genome enters the
  nucleus for replication. Adenovirus stimulates cell surface TLR2 and endosomal TLR9,
  which synergistically activate MyD88. MyD88 further activates Src, which then mediates
  multiple downstream kinases, leading to NFκB activation. This culminates in the
  inhibition of apoptosis and expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including IL-8
  and MCP-1. A similar signaling pathway in human corneal epithelial cells has yet
  to be elucidated.
