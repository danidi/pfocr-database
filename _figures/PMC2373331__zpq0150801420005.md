caption: Model for diapause regulation in the mosquito C. pipiens. Insulin signaling
  pathway during the nondiapausing stage, resulting in ovarian development (A), and
  during diapause, resulting in arrested ovarian development, fat hypertrophy, and
  resistance to overwintering stress (B) is shown. Arrows indicate stimulation and
  T-bars indicate suppression. Black and gray indicate the ON and OFF activity states
  of the genes, respectively.
