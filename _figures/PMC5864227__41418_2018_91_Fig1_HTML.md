caption: Mutp53 accumulation in tumours is sustained by mechanical inputs through
  a mevalonate-RhoA-HDAC axis. Normal epithelial cells tune their contractility in
  response to tensional homoeostasis, but tumours exhibit altered mechanotransduction.
  During transformation, tumour-associated fibrosis generates a mechanically rigid
  matrix leading to integrin clustering and activation in focal adhesions. These complexes
  activate RhoA-dependent remodelling of filamentous actin and actomyosin contractility,
  thereby triggering Hsp90-mutp53 physical interaction and mutp53 stabilisation. This
  event requires HDAC6 and leads to functional inactivation of the MDM2 ubiquitin
  ligase. RhoA requires geranylgeranylation for proper membrane localisation and activation,
  using intracellular GGPP produced via the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, thus linking
  this metabolic pathway to transduction of mechanical signals and mutp53 stability.
  Inhibition of MVA flux using either statins or zoledronic acid, reduces intracellular
  levels of GGPP and consequently RhoA localisation and activation. Similar effects
  can be obtained blocking RhoA geranylgeranylation by treatment with inhibitors of
  GGTI protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I, such as GGTI-298. Therefore, administration
  of these treatments to cells growing on a rigid matrix in vitro, or to highly stiff
  tumours, can effectively interfere with cell mechanotransduction and thereby block
  mutp53 stabilisation and oncogenic activity
