caption: Schematic model showing the catabolic process involved in macromolecule degradation
  leading to electron donation to the ETF-ETFQO pathway during dark-induced senescence
  in wild-type plants (A) and atg mutants (B). Carbon starvation conditions promoted
  by extended darkness are associated with macromolecule degradation via several catabolic
  pathways (e.g. autophagy), releasing amino acids to be oxidized. The electrons generated
  are transferred, via the ETF/ETFQO system, to the respiratory chain through the
  ubiquinol pool, promoting plant survival. In atg mutants, there is a compromised
  amino acid (aa) supply, particularly s and Lys, recognized previously to be able
  to feed electrons to the ETF/ETFQO system. Simultaneously, there is a higher induction
  of genes associated with the ETF/ETFQO pathways and autophagy independent of chloroplast
  degradation, CV, which leads to a hypersensitivity response to energetic limitations
  in atg mutants.
