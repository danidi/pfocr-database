caption: Putative molecular pathway through which deregulated GSK3β promotes tumor
  cell migration and invasion. The exact molecular pathway by which GSK3β mediates
  the activation of FAK (open arrow) remains to be determined. FAK, focal adhesion
  kinase; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GSK3β,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3β; GTP, guanosine triphosphate; JNK, c‐Jun N‐terminal
  kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MT1‐MMP, membrane type 1‐MMP; circled P,
  phosphorylation.
