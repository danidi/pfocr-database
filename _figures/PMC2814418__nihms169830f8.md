caption: Schematic representation of VDR-dependent and auxiliary pathways that lead
  to deltanoid-induced monocytic differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. Deltanoids
  entering the cell activate p50VDR, as indicated by an asterisk. This results in
  modulation of the activity of genes containing VDREs by the VDR/RXR heterodimers
  and by the activation of differentiation–auxiliary pathways that include the three
  principle MAPK signaling cascades. KSR-1 may amplify the mitogen-activated Raf–MEK–ERK
  pathway, the MAPK cascade upregulated in the initial phase of deltanoid-induced
  monocytic differentiation [,] and may result in phosphorylation of C/EBPβ. The source
  of the activation of JNK and p38 pathways is currently unclear, but it appears that
  the p38 pathway has a negative effect on differentiation. The suggested involvement
  of the transcription factor AP-1 [] and of the cell cycle controlling protein pRb
  [] have not been discussed in this paper. The C/EBPβ appears to be an effector of
  monocytic differentiation, perhaps through a C/EBP element in the promoter of the
  gene encoding CD14, a monocyte-specific protein []. Another monocyte-specific protein,
  MSE, is also upregulated by deltanoids, but the mechanism is still unknown.

    Deltanoids entering the cell activate p50VDR, as indicated by an asterisk. This
    results in modulation of the activity of genes containing VDREs by the VDR/RXR
