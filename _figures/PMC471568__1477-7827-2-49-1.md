caption: 'Schematic illustrating hormonal regulation of the endometrial luteolytic
  mechanism and antiluteolytic effects of the conceptus on the endometrium in the
  ovine uterus. During estrus and metestrus, oxytocin receptors (OTR) are present
  on the uterine lumenal epithelium (LE) and superficial ductal glandular epithelium
  (sGE), because estrogen (E) levels are high and increase expression of estrogen
  receptor alpha (ERα) and OTR. The progesterone receptor (PR) is present, but low
  systemic levels of progesterone result in insufficient numbers of activated PR to
  suppress ERα and OTR synthesis. During early diestrus, endometrial ERα and estrogen
  are low, but progesterone levels begin to increase with formation of the CL. Progesterone
  acts through the PR to suppress ERα and OTR synthesis for 8 to 10 days. Continuous
  exposure of the endometrium to progesterone eventually down-regulates PR gene expression
  in the endometrial luminal epithelium (LE) by Days 11 to 12 of the estrous cycle.
  The loss of PR terminates the progesterone block to ERα and OTR formation. Thus,
  ERα appears on Days 11 to 12 post-estrus, which is closely followed by OTR on Days
  13 and 14. The increase in OTR expression is facilitated by increasing secretion
  of estrogen by ovarian follicles. In both cyclic and pregnant sheep, oxytocin (OT)
  is released from the posterior pituitary and corpus luteum beginning on Day 9. In
  cyclic sheep, OT binds to OTR on the endometrial epithelium and increases release
  of luteolytic pulses of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) to regress the CL through a COX-2
  pathway. In pregnant sheep, inteferon tau (IFNτ) is synthesized and secreted by
  the elongating conceptus beginning on Day 10 of pregnancy. IFNτ binds to Type I
  IFN receptors (IFNAR) on the endometrial LE and inhibits transcription of the ERα
  gene through a signaling pathway involving IFN regulatory factor 2 (IRF-2). These
  actions of IFNτ on the ERα gene prevent OTR formation, thereby maintaining the CL
  and progesterone production. Legend: E, estrogen; ERα, estrogen receptor alpha;
