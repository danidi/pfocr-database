caption: U937 cells were treated with 25 μM haemin for 6 h. Cells were then incubated
  with 13C6-labelled glucose for 5 min. Data show amounts of 13C-labelled metabolites
  in glycolysis and PPP (open bar, control; closed bar, haemin-treated cells). ∑ glycolysis;
  total sum values of 13C6-G-6-P, 13C6-F-1,6-BP, 13C3-GA3P, 13C3-DHAP and 13C3-BPG.
  ∑ PPP indicates total sum values of 13C6-G-6-P, 13C6-6-PG, 13C5-R-5-P, 13C5-Ru-5-P
  and 13C3-GA3P. BPG is expressed as total sum values of 2,3-BPG and 1,3-BPG. Inset,
  HO-1 expression in haemin-treated cells. Data are expressed as mean+s.d. (nmol 10−8
  cells) of five separate experiments. *P<0.05 versus controls (unpaired Student’s
  t-test). ND; not detected; G-6-P, glucose 6-phosphate; F-6-P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  F-1,6-BP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; GA3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; BPG, bisphosphoglycerate; 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; 2-PG, 2-phosphoglycerate;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; 6-PG, 6-phosphogluconate; Ru-5-P, ribulose-5-phosphate;
  R-5-P, ribose-5-phosphate; Xu-5-P, xylulose-5-phosphate; Sed-7P, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate;
  Ery-4P, erythrose-4-phosphate.
