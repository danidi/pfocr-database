caption: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during steroidogenesis. The import
  of cholesterol from the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to the inner mitochondrial
  membrane (IMM) is activated by STAR and mediated by the translocator protein (TSPO)-associated
  multi-component complex. This is followed by cholesterol side-chain cleavage to
  pregnenolone by P450scc (CYP11A1). The other steps in the steroidogenic pathway
  are catalysed by cytochrome P450 isoforms in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The
  final step in cortisol synthesis is catalysed by P450c11β (CYP11B1) in the mitochondria,
  converting 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. Electron leakage during this process results
  in ROS production.
