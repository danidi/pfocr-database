caption: Biosynthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate in prokaryotes. A, biosynthetic enzymes
  and precursors of TPP in E. coli. B, proposed mechanism for formation of the thiazole
  moiety. The formation of 13 has been characterized using ThiG from B. subtilis (,
  , ) and is proposed to be, along with dehydroglycine, a common intermediate in the
  biosynthetic pathway in all prokaryotes. The generation of dehydroglycine varies
  between anaerobic and aerobic organisms. The thiazole moiety is coupled with 4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyprimidine
  (HMP) pyrophosphate and phosphorylated to TPP in the later steps of the biosynthesis
  of TPP.
