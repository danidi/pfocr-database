caption: NK cells interact with the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint axis. NK cells can
  increase the expression of PD-L1 on tumor cells through release of cytokines such
  as IFN-γ, promoting PD-1/PD-L1 driven stimulation of Treg production which in turn
  can inhibit NK cell function. 1) NK cells have also been shown to express both PD-L1
  and PD-1 themselves. PD-L1 expression can be induced in NK cells by direct interaction
  with tumor cells via the p38/NF-κB pathway and by stimulation with cytokines IL-12
  and IL-18 (). 2) PD-1 expression in NK cells has been shown to be upregulated in
  a variety of cancers (, , ) and to be inducible in response to IL-2 stimulation
  () and glucocorticoid signaling (). 3) Treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy
  can help prevent Treg inhibition of NK cells and counteract PD-1/PD-L1 driven NK
  cell dysfunction. 4) PD-L1 expression on tumors correlates with response to PD-1/PD-L1
  checkpoint blockade therapies, thus induction of PD-L1 by NK cells should improve
  outcomes of this treatment.
