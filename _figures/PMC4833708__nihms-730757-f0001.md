caption: Crosstalk between the different mechanisms underlying the modulation of NSPCs.
  The mechanisms by which morphine, cocaine and methamphetamine (METH) modulate adult
  NSPCs exemplify the crosstalk between the MAPK cascade, cell cycle regulation and
  miRNA expression induced by addictive drugs. Morphine up-regulates miR-181a by the
  ERK/TRBP/Dicer pathway. MiR-181a further controls Prox1/Notch1 signaling, which
  ultimately results in alterations of NSPC differentiation. Cocaine activates the
  miR-9/TLX loop, which in turn regulates p21 and further interferes with the effects
  of cell cycle regulatory molecules that alter proliferation and differentiation
  of NSPCs. On the other hand, cocaine up-regulates miR-124, which inhibits Notch1
  expression, which results in cell cycle arrest. Methamphetamine activates the p53/p21
  cascade, which blocks the effects of cell cycle regulatory molecules, resulting
  in the decreased proliferation and increased neuronal differentiation of NSPCs
