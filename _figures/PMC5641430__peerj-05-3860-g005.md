caption: In the Synecchocystis network, the production of Putrecine is assured by
  a pathway initiated in L-arginine at the expense of a direct alternative pathway
  from extra-cellular Putrecine. One interpretation is that the L-arginine pathway
  also allows the production of Ammonia. In this context, urea and agmathine are optimal-efficiency-PEMs
  but neither sustainability-PEMs nor producibility-PEMs.
