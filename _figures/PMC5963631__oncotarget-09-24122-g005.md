caption: 'Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Network map of the Reactome
  package in R [] on DEGs (p < 0.05). (A) Network of the enriched pathways. (B) Individual
  enriched pathways and their contributing DEGs. #1: Activation of the mRNA upon binding
  of the cap-binding complex and eIFs, and subsequent binding to 43S; #2: Translation;
  #3: Translation initiation complex formation; #4: GTP hydrolysis and joining of
  the 60S ribosomal subunit; #5: Formation of the ternary complex, and subsequently,
  the 43S complex; #6: Ribosomal scanning and start codon recognition; #7: Cap-dependent
  Translation Initiation; #8: Eukaryotic Translation Initiation; and #9: L13a-mediated
  translational silencing of Ceruloplasmin expression.'
