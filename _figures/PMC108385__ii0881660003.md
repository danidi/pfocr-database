caption: Biosynthetic pathway of GDP-l-fucose and GDP-perosamine with gene names.
  The pathway begins with fructose-6-phosphate, which is converted to d-mannose-6-phosphate
  by the phosphomannose isomerase encoded by manA. The manA gene is located outside
  the O antigen gene cluster (). The GDP-l-fucose pathway was described by Ginsburg
  (), and we have identified all the genes (reference  and unpublished data). The
  GDP-perosamine pathway is that proposed by Stroeher et al. (), and the genes assigned
  to each step are based on sequence similarity described in the text.
