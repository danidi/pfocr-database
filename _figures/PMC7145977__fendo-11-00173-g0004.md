caption: Hypothetical model showing the possible role of Sirtuins and circadian system
  in the pathogenesis of diabetic lung. Dotted line represents the pathway needed
  to be elucidated. Solid line represents the pathway which has been proved in former
  studies. Circadian disturbance decreases deacetylase activity of Sirtuins via impairing
  NAD+ oscillation. SIRT1 inhibits pulmonary inflammation through regulating circadian
  clock or through regulating transcriptional factors such as NF-κB and FOXO3. SIRT1
  and SIRT6 rescue pulmonary cells from premature aging via regulating the DNA damage
  response synergistically with circadian clock. In addition, SIRT6 prevents premature
  aging by attenuating the IGF-mTOR signaling pathway. Both SIRT3 and SIRT6 inhibit
  pulmonary fibrosis by inactivating the TGFβ1/Smad3 signaling pathway. SIRT3 inhibits
  pulmonary fibrosis by maintaining mtDNA stability. NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide;
  NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; FOXO3, forkhead protein box 3; mTOR, mechanistic target
  of rapamycin; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; TGFβ1, transforming growth factor
  β1; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA.
