caption: Signaling pathway of NO-induced SMC relaxation in mouse small airways. Agonists,
  such as 5-HT, stimulate airway contraction by binding to their specific G protein–coupled
  membrane receptors (5-HT2R) to stimulate the dissociation of their α subunit (Gqα).
  This Gqα activates phospholipase C β (PLCβ) to synthesize IP3 that, in turn, activates
  SR IP3Rs to release Ca2+ from the SR. The resulting high [Ca2+]i inactivates the
  IP3R, and the Ca2+ is pumped back into the SR by the SR/ER Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA),
  resulting in a decrease in [Ca2+]i and reactivation of IP3R. The cyclic release
  from and reuptake of Ca2+ into the SR results in Ca2+ oscillations. Ca2+ activates,
  via calmodulin, myosin light chain (MLC) kinase (MLCK) to phosphorylate myosin (MLC-P)
  and initiate SMC contraction. The simultaneous inactivation of MLC phosphatase (MLCP)
  by agonists, i.e., via Rho kinase (ROK), enhances MLC phosphorylation and SMC contraction.
  The relative activities of MLCK and MLCP determine the contractile state of the
  SMC. NO induces airway relaxation by the activation of sGC to synthesize cGMP from
  GTP. ODQ specifically inhibits sGC activity. The elevation of cGMP activates PKG,
  which inhibits the IP3R, resulting in a lowering of the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations,
  deactivation of MLCK, and airway relaxation. The cGMP analogue Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPS specifically
  inhibits PKG activity. In addition, cGMP activates PDE-5 to convert cGMP to inactive
  GMP. ZAP inhibits PDE-5 to maintain high cGMP concentrations.

  description: Signaling pathway of NO-induced SMC relaxation in mouse small airways.
    Agonists, such as 5-HT, stimulate airway contraction by binding to their specific
