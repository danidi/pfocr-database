caption: 'Structural view of S1P metabolism. Starting with sphingosine (magenta sticks)
  generated either de novo or from the salvage pathway, SK1 (shown as cartoon from
  ; PDB ID: 3VZB) can phosphorylate sphingosine to generate S1P. S1P can then be exported
  by certain members of the ABC transporter family or by Spns2 (grey box). Once S1P
  is outside the cell ApoM (grey cartoon from ; PDB ID: 2YG2) is one of the proteins
  which can mediate its transport throughout the blood stream. Upon its arrival to
  cells, S1P can diffuse into the membrane, move laterally and bind to S1PRs (represented
  by the rainbow cartoon; PDB ID: 3V2Y) from within the membrane. After the effect
  of S1P has been elicited by the receptors, S1P diffuses out of the receptor binding
  site into the membrane where it encounters SPL (magenta cartoon; PDB ID: 4Q6R).
  S1P is then broken down into PE and hexadecanal which are no longer able to be used
  in the sphingolipid metabolic cycle. (see color version of this figure at www.informahealthcare.com/bmg).'
