caption: Expected 13C labeling patterns in mitochondrial Krebs cycle intermediates
  and byproducts with [U-13C]-Glc as tracer. The cycle reactions are depicted without
  (panel A) or with (panel B) anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylase (PC) reaction and the
  13C positional isotopomer patterns illustrated are the result of one cycle turn.
  In the absence of pyruvate carboxylation, Glu is labeled at C4 and C5 positions
  via the forward cycle reactions while Glu is labeled at C2 and C3 when pyruvate
  carboxylation is active (panels A and B). The possibility that a separate pool of
  pyruvate derived from Ala for entry into the Krebs cycle via pyruvate carboxylation
  is depicted in panel B, along with the contribution of the non-oxidative branch
  of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to the pyruvate pool. Isotopic scrambling
  occurs at the symmetric succinate, leading to the redistribution of 13C labels into
  its four carbons, two each at a time (blue and green carbons). Red or blue and green
  letter C's represent 13C labeled carbons before or after scrambling, respectively;
  blue pyruvate denotes a separate pool of pyruvate; solid and dashed arrows denote
  favorable single and multi-step reactions, respectively; open arrows in panel A
  delineate 13C-labeled OAA after one turn from unlabeled pre-existing OAA.
