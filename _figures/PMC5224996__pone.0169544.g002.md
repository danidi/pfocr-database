caption: The box with dotted border indicates the p-cymene peripheral pathway, which
  converts p-cymene into 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate. The substrate is p-cymene and the
  products are p-cumic alcohol, p-cumic aldehyde, p-cumate, 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3dihydro-p-cumate
  and 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate. The enzymes are CymA (p-cymene monooxygenase), CymB
  (p-cumic alcohol dehydrogenase) CymC (p-cumic aldehyde dehydrogenase), CmtA (p-cumate
  dioxygenase) and CmtB (2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-p-cumate dehydrogenase). The reactions
  of the 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate central pathway are presented in a box with continuous
  border. The substrate is 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate and the final products are isobutyrate,
  pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. The enzymes are CmtC (2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate-3,4-dioxygenase),
  CmtD (2-hydroxy-3-carboxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate decarboxylase), CmtE (2-hydroxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate
  hydrolase), CmtF (2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase), CmtG (4-hydroxy-2-pentanoate
  aldolase) and CmtH (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase).
