caption: The manually curated version of RISN. The over- and under-expressed genes
  are colored green and yellow, respectively. The cellular membrane and nuclear membrane
  are depicted by gray solid and dashed lines, respectively. Proteins are depicted
  by rounded rectangles, and DNA and small metabolite molecules are shown by circle.
  The phosphorylated P protein activated by AKT is denoted by P*, however, for the
  sake of simplicity, its process is not shown in the signaling pathway. Viral components
  are depicted by red shapes but with different caps to delineate activatory and inhibitory
  effects of RABV on RISN.
