caption: An example of rat metabolic network and the corresponding inhibition of hydrazine
  (at hour 8) learned by abductive ILP. Information on up/down changes in metabolite
  concentrations (boxed nodes) from NMR spectra is combined with KEGG metabolic diagrams.
  The nodes without boxes are the metabolites whose concentrations are not observed/observable.
  The enzymes associated with a single reaction (solid line) or a linear pathway (dotted
  line) are shown as a single enzyme or a sequence of enzymes. Colored arrows show
  the found inhibition with directions.
