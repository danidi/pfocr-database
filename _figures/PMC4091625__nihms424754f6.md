caption: '(A) HER2 homodimerization in unstressed cancer cells inhibits PTEN and activates
  PI3K/AKT signaling, which in turn leads to the activation of NF-kB, which drives
  the upregulation of LCN2. (B) Trastuzumab disables HER2 homodimerization inhibiting
  PI3K docking and derepressing PTEN. The net effect of trastuzumab inhibition is
  to stop tumor cell growth. (C) Upon induction of the UPR several events occur: (1)
  the reactivation of the PI3K/AKT axis; (2) the inhibition of PTEN; and (3) the activation
  of NF-κB. Cumulatively, these three events result in LCN2 upregulation, and reactivation
  of tumor cell growth despite continuous HER2 inhibition. Notably, UPR-activated
  NF-κB can also independently contribute to AKT phosphorylation, hence further contributing
  to LCN2 expression.'
