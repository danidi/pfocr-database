caption: Schematic model of crosstalk between oxysterol and Wnt pathways on the expression
  of myelin genes MPZ and PMP22. A, At basal levels, the interplay between LXR and
  Wnt pathways induces the fine-tuning of myelin gene expression. Wnt ligands activate
  myelin genes by means of the canonical Wnt pathway. We have identified active TCF/LEF
  response elements (TCFE) on the level of MPZ and PMP22 promoters. These TCFEs bind
  TCF/LEF transcription factors that interact with β-catenin. Oxysterols are present
  in Schwann cells. They repress myelin gene expression by means of LXRs that bind
  to LXREs located near the TCFEs. Furthermore, oxysterols can decrease the amount
  of Wnt components in Schwann cells. Therefore, the amount of β-catenin recruited
  on the level of MPZ and PMP22 promoters is the result of a balance between Wnt and
  oxysterol pathways. B, When Wnt ligands are at high amounts, Wnt/β-catenin pathway
  becomes predominant provoking the increase of β-catenin recruitment on myelin gene
  promoters. This will allow the expression myelin genes at high levels. C, When oxysterols
  reach high concentrations, they repress myelin gene expression by means of LXRs
  and decrease the amounts of Wnt/β-catenin components in Schwann cells. In this case,
  the oxysterol/LXR pathway becomes predominant.

  description: Schematic model of crosstalk between oxysterol and Wnt pathways on
    the expression of myelin genes MPZ and PMP22. A, At basal levels, the interplay

    Wnt ligands activate myelin genes by means of the canonical Wnt pathway. We have
    identified active TCF/LEF response elements (TCFE) on the level of MPZ and PMP22
    promoters. These TCFEs bind TCF/LEF transcription factors that interact with β-catenin.
    Oxysterols are present in Schwann cells. They repress myelin gene expression by
    means of LXRs that bind to LXREs located near the TCFEs. Furthermore, oxysterols
    can decrease the amount of Wnt components in Schwann cells. Therefore, the amount

    a balance between Wnt and oxysterol pathways. B, When Wnt ligands are at high
