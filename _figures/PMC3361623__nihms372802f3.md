caption: Pictured above are five potential pathways for the initiation of protein
  synthesis, the pathway on the left being a simplified version of that seen in  for
  cap-dependent translation. The details featured are the sequence in which the mRNA
  and initiating tRNA are bound to the ribosome, when subunit joining occurs and whether
  the binding of the initiating tRNA might be through eIF2 (the most likely) or through
  some other protein (less likely). The complete set of initiation factors or elongation
  factors necessary for any of the particular events remains to be determined in the
  case of cellular IRES containing mRNAs and has only been worked out for a few viral
  mRNAs.
