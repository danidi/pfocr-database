caption: Biosynthesis and metabolic activation of the estrogens E1 and E2. One of
  the major metabolic pathways of E1 and E2 leads to 2- and 4-catechol derivatives,
  which further oxidize to yield the corresponding reactive quinones. The quinones
  can react with DNA to form depurinating DNA adducts. In the deactivation pathway,
  which operates in parallel, the catechol derivatives are methylated to form methoxy
  catechol estrogens; in addition, the quinones are reduced by quinone reductase,
  as well as being conjugated with GSH, and, are thus rendered harmless. A shift in
  the apparent balance between these activating and deactivating pathways towards
  formation of depurinating DNA adducts could lead to the initiation of breast cancer.
