caption: NF-κB in conventional T-cell activation. TCR-dependent activation of naïve
  CD4 and CD8 T cells by antigen presenting cells (APC) leads to T-cell activation,
  division, and effector T-cell differentiation. The various CD4 T helper cell subsets
  and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes that develop in response to different cytokine and
  costimulatory signals delivered by APC and T cells undergo rapid antigen-driven
  expansion during the course of an infection. Following pathogen elimination, most
  effector T cells undergo activation-induced cell death, with the few surviving antigen-specific
  T cells differentiating into long-lived memory cells. Highlighted are roles for
  NF-κB in APC function, T-cell activation, CD4 Th differentiation, and T-cell survival
  and proliferation.
