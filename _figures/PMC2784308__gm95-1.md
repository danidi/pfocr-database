caption: An illustration of the MC1R pigmentation pathway and the loci implicated
  in melanoma risk. The binding of melanocortin-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) to its
  transmembrane receptor, Melanocortin-1-receptor (MC1R), results in stimulation of
  adenylate cyclase (AC) to produce cAMP. An antagonist to α-MSH, called Agouti protein
  (encoded by ASIP loci), inhibits this interaction. The release of cAMP in the cytoplasm
  activates the melanosomal enzymes, including tyrosinase (TYR) and tyrosinase-related
  protein-1 (TYRP-1), on the cell membrane of the melanosomes, resulting in a shift
  of pigment synthesis from pheomelanin to eumelanin. The variants of the genes encoding
  these proteins are listed. The corresponding odds ratio represents the risk of developing
  melanoma in patients carrying these variants.
