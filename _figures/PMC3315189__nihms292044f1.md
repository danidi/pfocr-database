caption: Methionine is converted by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT1A) to S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM), which is subsequently metabolized to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) by donating
  its methyl moiety to DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) or to other methyltransferases
  that include glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT). SAH hydrolase (SAHH) regulates
  the bi-directional reaction that leads to the synthesis of homocysteine from SAH
  or vice versa. Completing the cycle, homocysteine is converted to methionine by
  methionine synthase (MS), but is also reduced through the transsulfuration pathway,
  which leads to the synthesis of glutathione (GSH). This pathway is regulated by
  the vitamin B6-dependent enzymes cystathionine β synthase (CβS) and γ-cystathionase.
  Alpha-aminobutyric acid (ABU) is the collateral product of the reaction catalyzed
  by cystathionase.
