caption: Proposed reaction scheme for AsMTs. The proposed reaction pathway is a general
  one for AsMTs, but the numbering of the cysteine residues follows the sequence of
  CmArsM. (1) In the first round of methylation AsMT binds arsenic(III) in a series
  of three thiol-transfer reactions. (2) The methyl group of SAM is attacked by the
  arsenic lone pair. (3) A positively charged pentavalent MAs(V) intermediate is formed
  and (4) reduced to an enzyme-bound MAs(III) intermediate by Cys44, with the formation
  of a Cys44–Cys72 disulfide. (5) The disulfide is reduced by Trx, regenerating the
  enzyme for the second round of methylation. (6) MAs(III), which is tightly bound
  to Cys174–Cys224, is methylated, producing an enzyme-bound positively charged pentavalent
  DMAs(V) intermediate (7) which is reduced to DMAs(III) by Cys72 with the formation
  of a Cys72–Cys174 disulfide. (8) DMAs(III), which is weakly bound to the single
  Cys224, dissociates from the enzyme and is oxidized nonenzymatically to DMAs(V).
  Finally, the Cys72–Cys174 disulfide is reduced by Trx, allowing the cycle to begin
  over.
