caption: A model for the role of RILP in the recruitment of the V1 domain onto late
  endosome and lysosomes. The pH along the endocytic pathway gradually decreases from
  endosomes to lysosomes. The recruitment of RILP on endosomes and lysosomes, mediated
  by GTP-bound Rab7, promotes the subsequent recruitment of the V1 domain inducing
  reassembly of the V-ATPase, through the interaction of RILP with the V1G1 subunit.
  Depletion of RILP prevents the recruitment of V1G1 on late endosomal and lysosomal
  membranes promoting mislocalization of the V1G1 subunit (and possibly of the V1
  domain) on Golgi membranes and affecting organelle's pH.
