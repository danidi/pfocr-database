caption: NOTCH signaling pathway. In the golgi apparatus the Notch receptor undergoes
  proteolytic processing, which is S1 cleavage mediated by Furin proteases. The receptor
  is transported to the cell surface membrane. The extracellular domain of the Notch
  receptor (Notch-ECD) in the signalling cell binds with the Notch ligands (Delta,
  Jagged, Serrate) expressed by the adjacent cell. This induces the second proteolytic
  step, S2 cleavage by ADAM metalloproteases, and leads to the endocytosis of the
  Notch-ECD into the ligand-expressing cell. This is followed by the release of the
  Notch intracellular domain (Notch-ICD) with a tethered membrane. This is now a substrate
  for the gamma secretase enzyme complex, which cleaves the Notch-ICD from the membrane
  by S3 and S4 cleavages. The resulting active Notch-ICD translocates to the nucleus
  and interacts with the CSL protein. In the absence of Notch-ICD, the CSL is bound
  to co-repressor. Binding of Notch-ICD with CSL results in the formation of an active
  complex with MAML and other co-activators and leads to the transcription of Notch
  targets HES and HEY
