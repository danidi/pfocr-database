caption: Deletion of both cytosolic superoxide dismutases impacts metabolite concentrations
  and enzyme abundance of TCA cycle (A), glycolysis (B), and pentose phosphate pathway
  (C). STM WT and STM ΔsodAB strains were grown aerobically in LB broth for 18.5 h
  at 37°C, harvested and proteomes or metabolomes were extracted for quantitative
  profiling using LC-MSE or GC-MS, respectively. Data represent means of at least
  three biological replicates for metabolomics or proteomics analyses. Data were adjusted
  for multiple hypothesis testing and only significant differences with p < 0.05 or
  lower are displayed color-encoded. Oval symbols indicate relative changes in enzyme
  amounts detected for STM ΔsodAB compared to WT, whereas squares reflect relative
  changes in amounts of metabolites. Gray symbols are indifferent in enzyme or metabolite
  amounts.
