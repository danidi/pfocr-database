caption: 'Signaling pathway: Glucose, the major stimulant, via glycolysis and mitochondrial
  ATP energy production increases the ATP/ADP ratio that leads to the closure of the
  ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. The subsequent cellular depolarization activates
  voltage dependent calcium channels resulting in extracellular Ca2+ influx and fusion
  of insulin granules with the plasma membrane. The incretin hormone GLP-1 acts on
  its receptor at β cell plasma membrane to activate adenylyl cyclase and increase
  intracellular cAMP levels. In turn, cAMP binds and activates protein kinase A and
  EPAC. EPAC then functions to increase intracellular calcium level from intracellular
  calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum and to increase the number of readily
  releasable pool of insulin granules at the plasma membrane. The combination of these
  two processes results in a potentiation of insulin secretion.'
