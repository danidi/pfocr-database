caption: Simplified metabolic pathway of thiopurines. Bold lines represent the purine
  salvage pathway in which the pharmacologically active metabolites [6-thioguanine
  nucleotides (6-TGN)] are formed, whereas dotted lines represent the competing pathways.
  Azathioprine (AZA) is converted into mercaptopurine (MP) by separating the imidazole
  group. Mercaptopurine is subsequently metabolized into 6-TGN through a multistep
  pathway, by the enzymes hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT),
  inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and guanosine monophosphate synthetase
  (GMPS). Through competing pathways, MP is converted by xanthine oxidase (XO) into
  6-thiouric acid (6-TUA) or by TPMT into 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) and 6-methylmercaptopurine
  ribonucleotides (6-MMPR). Thioguanine (TG) is converted into 6-TGN in 1 step through
  the purine salvage pathway for which only HGPRT is necessary. Thioguanine may also
  be transformed into 6-methylthioguanine (6-MTG) by TPMT or into 6-TUA by guanine
  deaminase (GD) and XO. 6-TGN consists of 6-thioguanine monophosphate (6-TGMP), 6-thioguanine
  diphosphate (6-TGDP), and 6-thioguanine triphosphate (6-TGTP). The 6-TGTP nucleotides
  target Rac1 and finally induce T-cell apoptosis.
