caption: Haemodynamic flow regulates the functions of SMCs. The balance between the
  function of SMCs governs vascular physiology/pathology and atherosclerotic progression
  under different shear stress stimulation. To be specific, LSS attenuates the bioavailability
  of NO by decreasing eNOS mRNA and protein expression, ultimately impairs the NO-dependent
  apoptosis signalling pathway, and destroys the balance of apoptosis and proliferation.
  In addition, LSS induces PDGF and TGF mRNA and protein expression, leading to SMC
  proliferation. Furthermore, atherogenic shear stress also causes ECM degradation
  by increasing enzymatic degradation, such as MMP2 and MMP9. Increased MMP-2 secretion
  in SMC in response to shear stress may promote SMC migration. PDGF signalling also
  directs SMC migration and invasion. SMC, possibly through direct or indirect contact
  with the blood flow, may affect ECM volume and composition in the neointima. HSS,
  high shear stress; LSS, low shear stress; NO, nitric oxide; ERK1/2, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase1/2; AKT, protein kinase B; PDGFR, platelet-derived growth
  factor receptor; TGF, transforming growth factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
