caption: General mechanism of Wnt induction. (a) Proposed mechanism of interaction
  between Usp16 and the Wnt pathway. Bmi-1 and Usp16 control the level of ubiquitination
  of histone H2A. The balance between these two antagonistic proteins determines the
  levels of activation of Cdkn2a. Cdkn2a acts as a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway.
  Other mechanisms linking Bmi1 and Usp16 to Wnt activation are also possible. (b)
  During aging, increased tissue senescence and increased expression levels of p16INK4a
  have been observed. At the same time, there is a concurrent decline in stem cell
  self renewal and Wnt activation. These events are correlated to a change in balance
  between Bmi1 - promoting self-renewal and Wnt activation - and Usp16 - promoting
  cellular senescence and Cdkn2a expression.
