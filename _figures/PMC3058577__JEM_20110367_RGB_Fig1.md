caption: Putative mechanisms of ROS-dependent proinflammatory cytokine production
  in normal, healthy cells. During inflammasome-independent proinflammatory cytokine
  production (left), mtROS modulates the equilibrium between positive and negative
  regulators, which results in an increase in the rate of transcription of cytokines
  such as IL-6. Several steps in this pathway require further investigation. Specifically,
  how does activation of TLR4 by LPS result in an increase in ROS production from
  an individual mitochondrion (A), and how does mtROS inhibit negative regulators
  (e.g., MAPK phosphatases) of cytokine gene transcription (B)? Inflammasome-dependent
  proinflammatory cytokine production (right) requires inhibition of autophagy and
  mitophagy to increase the net amount of mtROS within the cell. The mechanism of
  this inhibition is unknown (C). Once mtROS accumulates, it activates the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  but the mechanism of this activation remains undefined (D). Once activated, the
  NLRP3 inflammasome undergoes a conformational change and assembles into a homooligomeric
  complex (one subunit is depicted) that catalyzes the activation of pro–caspase-1.
  In the case of IL-β, the active p10-p20 caspase-1 heterodimer cleaves pro–IL-1β
  to produce a mature form that is subsequently exported from the cell. AP-1, activator
  protein 1; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein; CARD, caspase recruitment
  domain; DAMP, damage-associated molecular patterns; IRF, interferon response factor;
  LRR, leucine-rich repeat; PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PYD, pyrin
  domain.
