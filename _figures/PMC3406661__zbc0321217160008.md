caption: A model of the role of FoxO1 in oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in mouse
  granulosa cells. When ROS is generated either by endogenous sources like aerobic
  metabolism and ischemia or by environmental stress like ionizing radiation and UV
  light, the excessive ROS accumulation results in oxidative stress in the cells.
  As a pivotal sensor of intracellular ROS, FoxO1 function is enhanced by both FoxO1
  expression up-regulation and nuclear translocation, therefore activating the transcription
  of FoxO1 target genes, including either proapoptosis or stress-resistant genes.
  The proapoptotic genes transfer the stress signal through mitochondrial pathway
  and finally initiate caspase-3 activity and cell apoptosis. But the oxidative stress-resistant
  genes serve to reduce the cellular ROS level, which may provide negative feedback
  to balance the FoxO1 expression during oxidative stress. Independently, insulin
  signaling can reduce the FoxO1 function via the PKB/AKT pathway phosphorylating
  FoxO1 and prohibiting the FoxO1 nuclear localization, thereby protecting granulosa
  cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.
