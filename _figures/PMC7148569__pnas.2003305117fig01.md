caption: 'Fine-tuning the IPyA pathway in Arabidopsis. The two-step IPyA pathway is
  the predominant auxin biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis. Conversion of tryptophan
  to IAA (auxin) consists of two steps: TAA conversion of Trp to IPyA, followed by
  YUC conversion of IPyA to IAA. Fine-tuned IAA production in response to environmental
  stimuli, as seen in response to elevated temperature or light, is critical for developmental
  response to these stimuli. In the IPyA pathway for IAA biosynthesis, these environmental
  stimuli trigger PIF4-mediated transcriptional regulation of enzymes involved in
  modification or biosynthesis of IAA.'
