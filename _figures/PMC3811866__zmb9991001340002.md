caption: Overview of the p38 MAPK pathway. The four different members of the p38 MAPK
  group (p38α, p38β, p38γ, and p38δ) are activated by phosphorylation by MAPK kinases
  MKK3 and MKK6. These MKKs are phosphorylated by a large group of MKK kinases (MKKKs)
  that are activated in response to different stimuli, such as inflammatory mediators
  and environmental stress. p38 MAPKs mediated various cellular processes.
