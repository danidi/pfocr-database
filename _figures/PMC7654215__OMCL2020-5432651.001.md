caption: In silico strategy to identify putative genes/proteins modulated by Rsv and
  Doxo with therapeutic potential for breast cancer. This workflow shows the logical
  steps of the in silico analyses. On the top is shown an overview of the in vitro
  step, which involves a set of acute and long-term analyses after the treatment of
  MCF7 breast cancer cells with Rsv and Doxo (details are shown in ). A translational
  strategy was performed to predict the putative genes and mechanisms modulated by
  Rsv and Doxo. To this, constitutive gene expression of MCF7 and metadata of breast
  cancer were used to predict interactomic networks. Topological analyses were prospected
  to predict hub-bottleneck (H-B) nodes and biological function associated. Gene expression,
  KM survival, and additional pathway analyses of these H-B nodes were also performed.
  Black boxes correspond to databases, algorithms, or metasearch software used.
