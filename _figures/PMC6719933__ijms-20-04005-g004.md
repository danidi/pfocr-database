caption: Transcriptional regulation of GRINA and its role in cell survival. (1) Upon
  ER stress the unfolded protein response is triggered. (2) The activated PERK arm
  allows the synthesis of the transcription factor ATF4, (3) which now can enter the
  nucleus and promote the transcription of GRINA. (4) Also, the vitamin D-VDR complex
  has been shown to enhance the expression of GRINA. (5) As a result, GRINA is synthesized
  (6) and able to interact with TMBIM6 to synergistically inhibit the release of Ca2+
  by inositol triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) towards the cytosol, thus suppressing
  the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
