caption: 'Mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes anabolic processes, such as the
  biosynthesis of proteins, nucleotides and lipids, and inhibits catabolic processes
  such as autophagy. Aa | mTORC1 phosphorylates (P) the hydrophobic motif (Thr389)
  in ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), thereby activating it to subsequently phosphorylate
  ribosomal protein S6 at the sites indicated to promote ribosome biogenesis. mTORC1
  also phosphorylates eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) at multiple sites to inhibit it.
  Inhibition of 4E-BP stimulates translation initiation, especially of 5′ oligopyrimidine
  tract (termed a 5′ TOP) and pyrimidine-rich translational element (PRTE) containing
  mRNAs. Ab | mTORC1 stimulates nucleotide and lipid synthesis. mTORC1 promotes the
  gene expression of key enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), at least
  in part by activating sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). mTORC1
  also stimulates CAD (Gln-dependent carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, Asp carbamoyltransferase,
  dihydroorotase) by S6K-mediated phosphorylation at Ser1859, which leads to CAD activation
  and the stimulation of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Furthermore, mTORC1 promotes
  lipogenic gene expression by activating S6K or by inhibiting the nuclear translocation
  of LIPIN1, both of which activate the transcription factor SREBP. Ac | mTORC1 inhibits
  autophagy by phosphorylating UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) at Ser758 and ATG14 at
  multiple sites. During mTORC1 inhibition, AMPK phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser317, and
  thereby activates ULK1, which phosphorylates Beclin 1 in the vacuolar protein sorting
  34 (VPS34)–Beclin 1–ATG14 complex to initiate autophagy. mTORC1 also inhibits autophagy
  indirectly by blocking lysosome biogenesis, by phosphorylating and inhibiting the
  nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). B | mTORC2 co-translationally
  phosphorylates AKT at Thr450 to prevent its ubiquitylation and degradation. mTORC2
  also post-translationally phosphorylates ATK at Ser473 to promote lipogenic gene
  expression by activation of SREBP1c. Moreover, mTORC2 co-translationally phosphorylates
  IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IMP1) at Ser181, which stimulates insulin-like growth
  factor 2 (IGF2) production. The activity of proteins shown in green is promoted
  by mTOR. The activity of proteins shown in red is inhibited by mTOR. Phosphorylation
  depicted in yellow is an activation signal and phosphorylation depicted in red is
  an inhibitory signal. Dashed arrows represent translocation of the protein. mLST8,
