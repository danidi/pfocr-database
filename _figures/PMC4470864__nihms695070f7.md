caption: 'The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in neuronal energy metabolism. Schematic
  representation of glucose metabolism in neurons (left) and astrocytes (right). Metabolic
  regulators differentially expressed between neurons and astrocytes are highlighted.
  Summarized is evidence that astrocytes ferment glucose to lactate which is secreted
  aside GSH into the intracellular space. Neurons then uptake lactate and GSH; lactate
  is then converted to pyruvate and enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate
  ATP over the respiratory chain. Abbreviations: as in ; GSH, glutathione; GSSG, glutathione
  disulfide; GLUT, glucose transporters; GR, glutathione reductase; GPx, glutathione
  peroxidase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter.'
