caption: Proposed scheme for the glucose uptake-promoting effect of DIFs. Stimulation
  with a DIF induces glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) translocation from intracellular
  vesicles to the plasma membrane (PM) via a PI3K–Akt-independent pathway, resulting
  in the promotion of glucose uptake by confluent mammalian cells []; the DIFs activate
  PI3K and Akt but this is not related to the DIF glucose uptake-promoting activity
  []. The DIFs also function as mitochondrial uncouplers, promoting oxygen consumption
  [] and glucose metabolism (glycolysis and subsequent degradation in the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle) [] by mitochondria; this further increases GLUT1 translocation
  and promotes glucose uptake into the cells. Chemical structure-activity relationship
  analysis revealed that DIF-1 and DIF-1(3M) are promising lead compounds for the
  development of anti-diabetes and anti-obesity drugs [,,].
