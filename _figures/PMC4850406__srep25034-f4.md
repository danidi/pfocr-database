caption: Gn and Ugn, endogenous hormones of the gastrointestinal tract, activate GC-C,
  which is expressed on the surface of intestinal cells along the entire length of
  the intestines. Gn/Ugn binds to the GC-C receptor resulting in the stimulation of
  the intracellular production of cGMP. cGMP as a second messenger activates cGMP-dependent
  PKG II, cross-activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and inhibits a cAMP-specific
  phosphodiesterase (PDE III). Inhibition of PDE III regulates the action of the apical
  Na+/H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3), which causes the decreased absorption of Na+. Moreover,
  PKGII and PKA phosphorylate CFTR, increasing its chloride-secreting activity, exchanging
  Cl− for HCO3−, and inducing an increase of bicarbonate secretion. The high concentration
  of electrolytes in the intestinal lumen results in water influx into the intestine.
