caption: 'Mechanism of action of FDA-approved drugs and the role of JNK in AD. The
  Aβ monomers are generated by amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage, and subsequently
  released from neurons. The monomers sequentially assemble into Aβ oligomer aggregates,
  and ultimately into amyloid plaques. The Aβ oligomers can alter mitochondria function
  and induce ROS production, dissipation of ΔΨm, caspase-3 activation, and ATP reduction.
  Additionally, Aβ oligomers activate the JNK pathway, thereby aggravating synaptic
  dysfunction. As a result, phosphorylated JNK induces dissipation of ΔΨm, cytochrome
  c release, and the activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 or c-Jun, which
  leads to apoptosis. However, JNK directly phosphorylates Tau and induces the amyloidogenic
  pathway, contributing to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid
  plaques, respectively, causing the gradual loss of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD). The main pharmacological actions of donepezil, galantamine and memantine
  (acetylcholinesterase/cholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI)) are believed to occur as
  the result of acetylcholinesterase activity inhibition. By blocking breakdown of
  ACh, the cholinergic transmission is enhanced, and the symptoms of AD are relieved.
  Additionally, in response to Aβ aggregation, microglia release pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) that activate astrocytes and induce apoptotic signals in
  neurons via TLR-JNK activation. The excessive activation of the NMDA receptor by
  glutamate results in excitotoxicity and Ca2+-dependent cell death. Memantine (N-methyl-D-aspartic
  acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist) inhibits calcium influx into cells that is normally
  caused by chronic NMDA receptor activation by glutamate. This leads to the improvement
  of Alzheimer’s dementia symptoms, demonstrated by increased cognition and other
  beneficial central nervous system effects [,,]. ↓: represents decrease; ↑ represents
  increase.'
