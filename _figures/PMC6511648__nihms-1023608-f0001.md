caption: High levels of the LSD1 epigenetic regulator correlate with tumor growth
  in SCLC, a neuroendocrine cancer in which the NOTCH pathway is tumor-suppressive
  and the ASCL1 transcription factor is oncogenic. Upon inhibition of LSD1, the expression
  of genes coding for NOTCH receptors, especially NOTCH1, is derepressed by increased
  histone acetylation (Ac) in regulatory regions. Higher levels of NOTCH1 result in
  activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway after cleavage of the receptor to generate
  the intracellular form of NOTCH1 (N1ICD), which acts as a transcription factor.
  The subsequent induction of NOTCH target genes (e.g., HES1, REST) and repression
  of ASCL1 results in increased cell death and potent inhibition of SCLC growth.
