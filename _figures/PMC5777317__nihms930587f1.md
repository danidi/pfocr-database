caption: Inactive AhR is localized in the cytosol complexed to HSP90, AIP, p23 and
  c-SRC. Upon interaction with an agonist, conformational changes result in the translocation
  of the complex to the nucleus and the interaction of AhR with ARNT after the dissociation
  of the cytoplasmic complex. The AhR-ARNT heterodimer controls the transcription
  of DRE containing genes. AhR signaling also includes non-genomic pathways, for example
  AhR functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, while the release of the c-SRC kinase results
  in the phosphorylation of multiple targets. AhR activation is limited by regulatory
  mechanisms, some of which are actually triggered by AhR activation. AhR drives the
  expression of CYP enzymes, which degrade AhR ligands. AhR also induces the expression
  of its repressor AhRR, which inhibits the formation of AhR/ARNT complex required
  for AhR signaling.
