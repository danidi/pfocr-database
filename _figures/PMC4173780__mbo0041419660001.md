caption: 'Strategies for the production of linear, primary alcohols. (A) Production
  of 1-butanol and 1-hexanol through the native or reconstructed clostridial pathway.
  The dotted arrow adjacent to Bcd-EtfAB indicates the weak activity of the Bcd enzyme
  in microbes other than clostridia. (B) Production of long-chain primary alcohols.
  In contrast to short-chain alcohols, long-chain fatty alcohols can be produced via
  various routes. The blue box in the reverse β-oxidation indicates the essential
  genetic manipulation to activate this pathway in the presence of glucose. The crp*
  gene encodes the mutant catabolite repressor protein for catabolite derepression.
  Points to be considered for further engineering in enzymatic and cellular levels
  are indicated in cyan and green boxes, respectively. For each reaction, the names
  of the corresponding enzymes used in the metabolic engineering studies are shown.
  The source of the enzyme was noted together with the enzyme, except for E. coli.
  The abbreviations of the species are as follows: Ac, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus;
  Aca, Aeromonas caviae; Ca, Clostridium acetobutylicum; Ch, Cuphea hookeriana; Ma,
  Marinobacter aqualeolei; Mm, Mus musculus; Mma, Mycobacterium marinum; Re, Ralstonia
  eutropha; Se, S. elongatus; Sp, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803; Td, Treponema denticola;
  Uc, Umbellularia californica. See the main text for the abbreviations of the enzymes.'
