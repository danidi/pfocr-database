caption: 'Diagrammatic representation of the Ca2+ role in salt stress responses in
  plants. Prominent role of Ca2+ under salt has been proposed in this scheme. Na+
  influx to the cytosol is mediated by CNGC, HKT, GLR and AtNCl. Na+ efflux is derived
  by SOS. NHX and CAX are involved in Na+/H+ and Ca2+/H exchanges through vacuolar
  membrane, respectively. Ca2+ in the center implicates the Na+ current either by
  direct interaction with ion channels or indirectly through Ca2+ related modules
  (CBL-CIPK and CaM). FER activates Ca2+ channels via unknown pathway and bears a
  transient Ca2+signaling. AtNCL: Na+/Ca2+ exchanger-like protein, CAX: Vacuolar H+/Ca2+
  antiporter, CNGS: Cyclic nucleotide gated channels, FER: FERONIA, GLR: Glutamate-activated
  channels, HKT: Na+ transporter, NHX: Vacuolar located Na+/H+ antiporters, SOS: Salt
  overly sensitive, SS: Salt stress.'
