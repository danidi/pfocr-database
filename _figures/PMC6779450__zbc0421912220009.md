caption: 'Schematic model of cytoophidia regulation by TOR. TOR complex in fission
  yeast consists of TORC1 and TORC2 sub-complexes, shown in green and blue, respectively.
  Under physiological conditions, exponentially growing cells exhibit normal Cts1
  cytoophidia formation (depicted as yellow filaments). Proper cytoophidia formation
  is mediated by both TORC1 and TORC2 sub-complexes. Downstream effector proteins,
  such as the S6 kinases Gad8 (also an AGC kinase), Sck1, Sck2, and Psk1 mediate the
  proper formation of Cts1 cytoophidia, either by their immediate kinase action on
  CTPS or by their regulatory action on TORC1 and TORC2 targets. Crf1 transcriptional
  corepressor of ribosomal proteins also seems to play a key role in Cts1 filamentation
  via the TORC2 pathway. When TOR signaling is inhibited by drugs or does not function
  properly, such as in knockout mutants of TOR subunits or effector proteins, the
  Cts1 cytoophidia become significantly shorter and/or dissociate (bottom). RP, ribosomal
  protein; AGC, family of kinases named after three of its members: PKA, PKG, and
  PKC.'
