caption: Neurodegenerative diseases are among the most common diseases and yet probing
  the pathological mechanisms has remained a challenge. The diseases typically come
  in both sporadic and hereditary forms, and mutations in numerous genes in familial
  cases have been identified. To obtain insights into how these genes and their mutations
  are involved in specific diseases, one of our best strategies is to study these
  genes and the corresponding mutations in model organisms like Drosophila and mice.
  The Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is an especially amenable system
  to study the role of these genes in invertebrates[]. As shown in , the motor neuron’s
  terminals form close spherical connections with the muscle, called boutons[]. At
  each bouton, many synapses, the presynaptic regions of which are known as active
  zones, form between neuron and muscle. These zones have a T-shaped structure known
  as a T-Bar where synaptic vesicles (SVs, green) cluster, fuse and release glutamate
  (red lightning) into the extracellular space. The neurotransmitter is then bound
  by glutamate receptors (purple cylinders) on the muscle, that triggers calcium influx
  and subsequent muscle contraction[]. Given that Drosophila permits sophisticated
  genetic manipulations[,], numerous probing experiments can be performed. For example,
  in a mutant background, proteins can be expressed pre- or post-synaptically to determine
  where they are required. Electrophysiological experiments on individual nerves targeting
  specific muscles allow one to derive very valuable information about the ability
  to release vesicles, endocytose membranes, the function of postsynaptic receptors,
  etc[]. FM1–43 dye uptake experiments allow one to establish how much membrane is
  taken up during endocytosis and how much is released during exocytosis, thus providing
  real-time analysis of vesicle trafficking[]. Antibodies against numerous proteins
  that are present at the NMJ pre- and post-synaptically are available and allow one
  to assess which proteins may be implicated in the process or pathology that is being
  studied[]. These data, combined with Transmission Electron Microscopy and Immuno-EM
  studies provide very valuable information about the number, distribution and size
  of SV, and the number and size of active zones[,]. Finally, genetic interactions
  and epistasis with a vast number of mutants as well as the ability to overexpress
  specific proteins allow for a detailed analysis of genetic pathways[]. In summary,
  no synapses are currently more amenable to a diverse set of manipulations in vivo
  than the Drosophila NMJ, and by combining the information obtained from different
  experimental datasets, very valuable biological information can be derived.
