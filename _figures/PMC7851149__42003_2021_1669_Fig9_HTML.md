caption: Upon exposure to PQ2+, superoxide (O2.−) is produced that, in turn, can generate
  H2O2 (see text). Both ROS molecules disturb the mitochondrial activity (oxygen consumption
  rate and mitochondrial membrane potential, ΔΨ) and animal growth rate. Exogenously
  added glycolate (GA) is converted into glycine and serine. This triggers the NADPH/NADP+
  ratio that together with the generation of the building blocks for GSH synthesis,
  glycine and l-cysteine (the latter produced form l-serine), increase the GSH/GSSG
  ratio. The boosted GSH levels counteract the deleterious effects of H2O2 on mitochondrial
  function and growth but not those of superoxide itself.
