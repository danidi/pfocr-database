caption: A simplified model of ABA signaling in guard cells. Nitric oxide (NO) promotes
  and attenuates the ABA-induced and phospholipid-mediated stomatal closure. The positive
  ABA-stimulus inducing the stomatal closure and involving NO and phospholipid-derived
  signals are in green. The negative effects of NO linked to post-translational modifications
  of proteins and attenuating the ABA signaling are in red. The model shows that ABA
  binds to its receptor pyrabactin resistance/regulatory component and recruits the
  protein phosphatase 2C [ABA-PYL/PYR/RCAR-PP2C], resulting in the activation of the
  kinase open stomata 1 (OST1). Then, OST1 phosphorylates and activates NADPH oxidase
  (NADPHox), with the consequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and downstream,
  the formation of NO through the enzymatic activities nitrate reductase (NR) and
  NO synthase-like (NOS-like). NO induces the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA)
  via the activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) by a still
  unknown mechanism. PA in turn activates NADPHox and inhibits PP2C and inward-rectifying
  K+ (IK, in) channels. The activity of PLC also generates inositol phosphates (IP3∕6)
  contributing to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores through endomembranes
  Ca2+-channels (EM Ca2+ Ch). The increase of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt)
  activates slow -anion channels (SLAC) which also inhibits IK, in. The production
  of ROS also participates in the regulation of [Ca2+]cyt through the activation of
  plasma membrane Ca2+ channels (PM Ca2+ Ch). The model also shows a pathway proposing
  that ABA is able to induce the production of NO via the dephosphorylation and activation
  of NR through the activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) (Heidari et al., ).
  The attenuating effects of NO by breaking the ABA stimulus include the inhibition
  and degradation of the ABA receptor PYL/PYR/RCAR through the nitration of Tyr residues
  (Tyr-NO), and the inactivation of OST1 and NADPHox via S-nitrosylation (S-NO).
