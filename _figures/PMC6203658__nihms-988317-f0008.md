caption: A hypothetical mechanism for the fimasartan attenuation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation in response to ICH. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) induces the inflammatory
  response of microglia via activating 2 signals. The priming signal, that is the
  NF-κB pathway, releases the cytokines pro-IL-1β and TNFα. The second signal assembles
  the NLRP3 inflammasome and cleaves caspase-1 into the active form, which subsequently
  promotes the pro-IL-1β into the maturation IL-1β. Pretreatment with low-dose fimasartan
  reduces the secondary damage induced by acute ICH via downregulating the activation
  of the two signals.
