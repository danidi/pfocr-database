caption: 'Putative pathways of IAA biosynthesis in C. sorokiniana include (1.) the
  indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway: A tryptophan transaminase first converts Trp
  to IPyA and flavin monooxygenase (Yucca) converts IPyA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA);
  (2.) The indole-3-acetamide (IAM) pathway: Primarily a pathway in phytopathogenic
  bacteria, IAM has been detected in all plants tested; furthermore, plants encode
  an amidase that converts IAM to IAA; (3.) The indole-3-acetaldehyde (IAAld) pathway.
  In the IAAld pathway, IPyA is converted to IAAld by a decarboxylase, and indole-3-acetaldehyde
  oxidase converts IAAld to IAA. Efflux and import functions are associated with the
  presence of specific transporters and the ABP1 receptor and associated downstream
  signaling components are present, as specified in .'
