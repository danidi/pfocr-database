caption: 'Functional interaction network analysis of genes with enriched expression
  (EE) and differential splicing (DS) in the placenta. Shown is module 0 of the interaction
  network constructed for chorion. Circular node: a query gene. Diamond-shaped node:
  a linker gene. Node color was determined based on whether the query gene shows EE
  (green), DS (pink), or both (red). Two large circular clusters represent highlighted
  significantly enriched pathways in chorion: glypican, SMAD2/3, and TGF-beta receptor
  signaling pathways (left-hand side; red lines) and HIF-1 alpha transcription factor
  signaling pathway (right-hand side; blue lines). FOS and SERPINE1 are shared by
  both groups of enriched pathways, but only shown in the right cluster. Several linker
  hub genes with dense connections with the highlighted pathways are also shown in
  bigger nodes.'
