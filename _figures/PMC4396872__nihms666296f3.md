caption: NOD signaling pathways. The current model suggests that NOD proteins are
  kept in an inhibited state possibly through autoinhibition or through protein–protein
  interactions. The mechanisms of the release of inhibition (step 1) are not well
  understood, but may require the exchange of deoxyadenosine diphosphate for deoxyadenosine
  triphosphate and ligand binding (step 2). RIP2 is then recruited through homotypic
  CARD:CARD interactions to a large macromolecular complex termed the NODosome (step
  3). Ultimately, RIP2 autophosphorylates at tyrosine X. Active RIP2 is then K63-ubiquitinated
  on lysine 209 through the E3 ligases cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP. XIAP recruits the linear
  ubiquitin chain assembly complex LUBAC. The TAK1:TAB complex is recruited to the
  activated ubiquitinated RIP2 protein and undergoes autophosphorylation and K63-linked
  ubiquitination. This complex then promotes the activation of the IKK complex. IKKγ/NEMO
  is K63-linked ubiquitinated allowing for the phosphorylation of IKKα and IKKβ. The
  catalytic subunits of IKK then phosphorylate IĸBα, which leads to its degradation
  through K48-linked ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal degradation. The release of inhibition
  allows for NF-ĸB to translocate into the nucleus to activate gene transcription.
  NOD-dependent activation of RIP2 can also activate MKK through the TAK1:TAB protein
  complex. Activation of this pathway leads to the mobilization of the activator protein
  1 family of transcription factors. Additionally, the interferon regulatory factor
  pathway can be activated through TNF receptor associated factor 3. The interferon
  regulatory factor pathway is less well understood. NOD2 can also activate the autophagic
  response, which is dependent on RIP and the MAPK pathway.
