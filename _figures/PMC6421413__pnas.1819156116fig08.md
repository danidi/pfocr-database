caption: Schematic of protein associations and potential functions of SHARPIN in human
  megakaryocytes and platelets. (A) Normal SHARPIN expression. SHARPIN associates
  with αIIbβ3, likely predominantly in resting platelets. In addition, HOIP and HOIL-1
  are expressed in platelets and, together with SHARPIN, form LUBAC. Also expressed
  are OTULIN and SPATA2, involved in Met1 deubiquitination. Stimulation of platelets
  through receptors for thrombin, LPS, or sCD40L activates LUBAC to add Met1 linear
  ubiquitin chains (red circles) to NEMO, provoking transautophosphorylation of IKKβ
  and phosphorylation of IκBα. In nucleated cells, Lys-48-ubiquitination (blue circles)
  results in proteasomal degradation of IκBα, which frees NF-κB for nuclear translocation.
  Activation of LUBAC and NF-κB pathway components presumably induces nongenomic responses
  in anucleate platelets (, ). (B) Effects of SHARPIN knockdown. (Upper) Reduction
  of SHARPIN levels associated with αIIb may prime αIIbβ3 for talin-mediated activation
  and fibrinogen binding. (Middle) Reduction in SHARPIN levels may also destabilize
  LUBAC, thereby reducing Met1 linear ubiquitination and NF-κB activation. (Lower)
  SHARPIN reduction in the megakaryocyte/platelet lineage also leads to an increase
  in surface expression of MHC class I molecules and increased release of sCD40L,
  potentially contributing to platelet function in immunity and inflammation.
