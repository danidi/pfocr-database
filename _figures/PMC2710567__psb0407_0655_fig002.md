caption: 'Model for the role of GAT1/TRX-m3 in the regulation of PD transport in Arabidopsis
  meristems (based on Schurmann and Buchanan, 2008). Metabolites are transported through
  the phloem from source to sink tissues and are unloaded symplasmically into companion
  cells from the sieve elements. Sucrose, the main form in which photoassimilates
  are transported, is cleaved to UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), which is thereafter metabolized
  to glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6P). TRX reduction is induced by Glc-6P via NADPH-FNR-FTR
  pathway. Reduced TRX regulates the activity of target proteins (Pox: oxidized protein,
  Pred: reduced protein) involved in metabolic processes or in ROS detoxification
  (RED: reductants). The reduction of ROS (generated during metabolism) also takes
  place in other organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes (MIT/PER), which,
  together with the plastids, maintain cell redox homeostasis. Loss of TRX-m3, or
  oxidative stress, alters this redox equilibrium and affects metabolic balance, which
  induces a “defense” response that diverts UDP-Glc to the synthesis of callose by
  callose synthases (CALS). Alternatively, ROS or other signaling molecules produced
  in the plastid might modulate the activity of proteins, the synthesis of starting
  metabolites or the expression of genes that participate in callose metabolism. Callose
  deposition constricts the PD channel and blocks the unloading of essential molecules
  into the cell, which adversely affects meristem development.'
