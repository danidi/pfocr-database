caption: Putative molecular mechanisms involved in the development of sarcopenia during
  aging. Skeletal muscle protein homeostasis is regulated by balancing protein synthesis
  and degradation. Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1)-Akt pathway controls muscle
  growth via activating the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibiting
  the members of the class O of forkhead box transcription factors (FOXO) family.
  FOXO transcription factors are required for the transcriptional upregulation of
  atrophy-related genes (atrogenes), ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1, and muscle ring
  finger 1 (MuRF1), leading to the ubiquitylation of muscle proteins and their degradation
  by the proteasome. Atrogin-1 and MuRF1 are also induced by several other signaling
  cascades, including the inflammatory cytokine-NF-κB and the myostatin-SMAD signalings.
  During aging, protein homeostasis is disrupted, shifting the balance between protein
  synthesis and protein degradation, leading to increased protein degradation and
  resulting in muscle atrophy, or sarcopenia.
