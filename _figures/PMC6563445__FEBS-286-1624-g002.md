caption: A schematic representation of the proposed mechanisms of IRF5 activation.
  The stimulation of toll‐like receptors (TLRs) on cell membranes by pathogen‐derived
  products or RIG‐I‐like receptors (RLRs) in the cytosol by viral PAMPs trigger signalling
  cascades. IRAK4 regulates the TLR/MyD88 response via TAK1 and IKKβ. Interferon regulatory
  factor 5 (IRF5) is activated from its latent state by post‐translational modifications
  that include ubiquitination by the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and phosphorylation by
  IKKβ. These modifications trigger IRF5 homodimerization, translocation to the nucleus
  and binding to gene promoters along with coactivator proteins (p300). Alternatively,
  DNA damage agents (CPT) can induce IRF5 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation.
  Another model proposes that the Dectin‐1‐induced IFN‐B production is mediated by
  a Syk‐Card9‐IRF5‐dependent pathway. In another model, IRF5 interacts with the COP9
  signalosome (CSN). Upon stimulation with agonists such as TRAIL, an unknown kinase
  phosphorylates IRF5 which leads to its dissociation from CSN. Loss of the CSN–IRF5
  interaction leads to K48‐linked ubiquitination of IRF5 and degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome
  pathway. Some activated IRF5 migrates to the nucleus and activates target genes.
  An alternative model suggests that upon NOD2 stimulation IRF5 associates with RIP2,
  IRAK1, TRAF6 and IKKb to increase glycolysis through Akt2 activation.
