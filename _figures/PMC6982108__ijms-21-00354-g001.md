caption: Model of the BR perception, signaling initiation, and regulation of the signal
  transduction in rice and other monocots. The BR molecule is depicted as the white
  circle with the ‘BR’ letters in it. Double black line represents the plasma membrane.
  Transcription factors are shown as ovals, other proteins are depicted as rectangles.
  Green arrows indicate stimulation, whereas red lines with the bullet points represent
  suppression. Detailed description is given in the text. Some of the BR responses
  and interactions were described in barley (A) and sorghum (B).
