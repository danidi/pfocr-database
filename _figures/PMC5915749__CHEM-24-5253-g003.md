caption: Calculated Mechanism for Indoline Formation. a) DFT‐D3 calculated (Turbomole
  BP86, def2‐TZVP) free energies (ΔG 298K° in kcal mol−1) for the proposed reaction
  pathway. Energies of all intermediates are reported with respect to species A as
  the reference point (barriers for the transition states are reported in between
  brackets). b) Spin density plot of intermediate C showing maximum spin density at
  the carbene carbon. c) Spin density plot of intermediate D after the 1,5‐HAT step
  showing maximum spin density on the benzylic carbon and some delocalization over
  the adjacent phenyl ring.
