caption: Xu-5-P is the signal for the coordinated control of lipogenesis. Feeding
  carbohydrate causes levels of liver glucose, Glc-6-P, and Fru-6-P to rise. Elevation
  of [Fru-6-P] leads to elevation of [Xu-5-P] in reactions catalyzed by the near-equilibrium
  isomerases of the nonoxidative portion of the hexose monophosphate pathway. The
  elevation of [Xu-5-P] is the coordinating signal that both acutely activates PFK
  in glycolysis and promotes the action of the transcription factor ChREBP to increase
  transcription of the genes for the enzymes of lipogenesis, the hexose monophosphate
  shunt, and glycolysis, all of which are required for the de novo synthesis of fat.
  The figure depicts the increase in enzyme transcription caused by the carbohydrate
  response element binding protein, ChREBP, in green dashed lines. Stimulation of
  the Fru-2,6-kinase reaction by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and its stimulation
  by Xu-5-P are by indicated green dotted lines. Metabolic reactions are indicated
  by solid black lines. Those reactions that are reversible in vivo are indicated
  with double arrows, and those catalyzing unidirectional reactions have only a single
  arrowhead. [ATP]/[ADP][Pi] represents the free cytosolic phosphorylation potential
  catalyzed by the combined glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 3-phosphoglycerate
  kinase reactions, and [AMP] represents the free cytosolic value catalyzed by the
  myokinase reaction. The names and EC numbers of the enzymes in green are given in
  the text. Inhibitions by AMP-stimulated protein kinase and cAMP-stimulated protein
  kinase are indicted by red dotted lines.
