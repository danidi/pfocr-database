caption: Schematic representation of microRNAs in osteogenic transdifferentiation
  of VSMCs. Upon BMPs binding to the receptor complex, Smad proteins translocate into
  the nucleus and modulate gene expression transcriptionally by directly interacting
  with the promoter region of target genes (such as Runx2 and Osterix) or post‐transcriptionally
  through regulating miRs synthesis. Then, these osteoblast transcription factors
  regulate opulent bone matrix proteins expression and promote transdifferentiation
  of VSMCs to osteoblast‐like cells. MicroRNAs regulate osteogenic transdifferentiation
  of VSMCs through targeting key factors in the BMP/Smad/Runx2 signalling pathway
  and several inhibitors of osteoblastic differentiation. Besides, some miRs are able
  to regulate the expression of proteins involved in VSMCs differentiation, migration
  and contractility. ADAMTS‐7, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin
