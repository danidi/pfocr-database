caption: Regulation of Intrinsic pathway by E3 ligases and DUBs. Multiple signals
  such as DNA damage, unfolded protein response, cytokine deprivation, free radical
  generating compounds, removal of nutrients, oxygen or growth factors, and endoplasm
  reticulum stress etc. contributes in the activation of intrinsic or the mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway. Following stress, two proapoptotic Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2)
  proteins- Bax (Bcl-2 associated X protein) and Bak (Bcl-2 homologous antagonist
  killer) are activated upon structural changes. They move to the mitochondria, homodimerizes,
  and generate pores onto the mitochondrial surface, which enhances the membrane permeabilization
  and cytochrome c then starts to releases. In the presence of ATP, cytochrome c associates
  with Apaf-1, leading to self-oligomerization of Apaf-1 via CED-4 domains. This leads
  to the exposure of CARDs of Apaf-1. When these CARDs domain of Apaf-1 and caspase-9
  binds, an apoptosome is formed. Dimerization of procaspase-9 forms an active caspase-9,
  which further activates the caspase-3 and 7 to commit cell death. Bcl-2 family proteins
  are categorized as antiapoptotic [Bcl-2, Bcl-xl (Bcl-extra-large), Bcl-w, Mcl-1
  (Myeloid leukemia cell differentiation 1), Bcl-b and A1], proapoptotic (Bax, Bak,
  and Bok (Bcl-2 related ovarian killer)] and regulatory BH3-only proteins [Bad (Bcl-2
  antagonist of cell death), Bik (Bcl-2-interacting killer), Bid (BH3-interacting
  domain death agonist), Bim (Bcl-2 interactor mediator of cell death), Bmf (Bcl-2-modifying
  factor), Noxa, and Puma (p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis)], Antiapoptotic
  proteins suppress the apoptotic signals by limiting Bax and Bak thus blocking cytochrome-c
  release. In case of cellular stress, Bim and Noxa counteract the effect of antiapoptotic
  proteins. BH3-only proteins release Bax-Bak from inhibition thus promoting Momp
  (Mitochondrial outer membrane potential) and apoptosis. The IAPs (inhibitors of
  apoptosis) are the negative regulators of the intrinsic pathway. XIAP (X-linked
  Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) is one of the IAP to be seen upregulated in cancer
  and is an inhibitor of caspase. Activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway leads
  to the release of Smac/Diablo (Second mitochondrial activator of caspases or direct
  IAP binding protein with low pI), Omi/HtrA2 (Omi stress-regulated endoprotease or
  High-temperature requirement A2) and Arts (Apoptosis-related protein in the TGF-beta
  signaling pathway) into the cytosol. Smac/Diablo and Omi/HtrA2, when released into
  cytosol upon stimuli, use their IBM (IAP-binding motif) domain to bind to the BIR2
  and BIR3 domains of the IAPs. They prevent the XIAPs ability to inhibit caspases
  and thus mediate apoptosis. Arts interact with residues of the BIR3 domain of XIAP
  distinct from Smac/Diablo and Omi/HtrA2 suggesting it to antagonize XIAP in a different
  way. Several E3 ligase and DUBs involved at different stages of the pathway are
  shown as red ovals.
