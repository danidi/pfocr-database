caption: Fatty acid (FA) synthesis pathway in ruminants. Microbes ferment polysaccharide
  into volatile fatty acids such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the rumen.
  The acetate and propionate can contribute for FA synthesis. Acetate is converted
  to acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm of ruminant cells and is used to synthesize FA. Propionate
  is transported into mitochondria where it enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle via
  succinyl-CoA and can be utilized as a substrate for the production of glucose via
  gluconeogenesis. Glucose, which is synthesized from propionate or rumen-bypassed
  and absorbed in the small intestine, can generate citrate in the tricarboxylic acid
  cycle, where it can be transported into the cytosol. The citrate in the cytosol
  is degraded into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA by ATP-citrate lyase, and the acetyl-CoA
  can be used to synthesize FAs. Modified from Bauman et al [].
