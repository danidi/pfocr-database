caption: 'Effects of intracellular S100B on cell proliferation, differentiation, survival

  S100B that in turn blunts p53 inhibitory effects on proliferation and stimulatory
  effects on apoptosis. However, S100B interaction with the ubiquitin E3 ligases,
  HMD2 and HMD4, may inhibit HMD2/HMD4-dependent reduction of p53 levels; B: Expression

  of the PI3K/Akt pathway; C: Intracellular S100B protects myoblasts against oxidative
  stress-induced apoptosis and inhibits differentiation via activation of the IκB
  kinase β/ nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway. Also, early after the transfer of myoblasts
  from growth medium to differentiation medium S100B becomes downregulated by the
  decrease in serum mitogens and activation of the promyogenic p38 MAPK, that likely
  stimulates S100B proteasomal degradation. However, S100B becomes re-expressed in
  differentiated myoblasts under the action of myogenin; D: S100B is induced in chondroblasts
  by the SOX trio and inhibits differentiation; E: S100B, induced in astrocytic progenitors
  by an unidentified mechanism (X), interacts with and activates a Src/PI3K pathway
  that stimulates RhoA/ROCK thereby promoting stress fiber formation and cell migration
  and Akt thereby inhibiting GSK3β resulting in stimulation of proliferation and inhibition
  of differentiation. Interaction of S100B with IQGAP1 results in activation of Rac1
  responsible for lamellipodia formation during migration. The S100B/IQGAP1/Rac1 interaction
  may also results in an enhancement of cell-cell adhesion as observed in neurospheres
  (see text). EGF represses S100B expression during early phases of astrocyte differentiation,
  which appears to be permissive for astrocytic terminal differentiation. Whether
  such a mechanism also is operating in cerebellar granule cell progenitors remains
  to be determined; F: S100B, induced in breast cancer cells by HOXC6 and HOXC11,
  contributes to tumor invasiveness; G: S100B is induced in post-infarction cardiomyocytes
  by the norepinephrine/α1A-adrenergic receptor/PKC axis and inhibits hypertrophic
  response via inhibition of PKC'
