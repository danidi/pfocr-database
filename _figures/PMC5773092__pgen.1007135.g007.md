caption: Mouse mammary tumor types and human cancers and are ordered to reflect similarities
  in differentiation and pathway activation. The far left window depicts mouse mammary
  EMT tumor models that parallel human claudin low breast and melanoma. As illustrated,
  these tumors show Kras pathway activity and stem-cell like gene expression profiles
  (as marked by pink bars). The middle window highlights the murine models that feature
  squamous tumors; these tumors show similarities to human pan-cancer squamous tumors
  for basal cell like gene expression (as marked by red bars) and to both human squamous
  cancers and basal-like breast cancers for Hras pathway activity. As indicated by
  green bars, human basal tumors had luminal progenitor-like gene expression profiles.
  The far right window highlights murine solid tumor models and microacinar models,
  which show more luminal-like features (marked by blue bars). Like human luminal
  tumors, these murine models feature high expression of ER-target genes and tend
  to show gene expression patterns that suggest they are more differentiated than
  their other species-specific tumor types.
