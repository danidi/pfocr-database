caption: 'Schematic of Hh signal transduction in Drosophila and vertebrates. a and
  b In Drosophila, without Hh ligand, the phosphorylated transcription factor Ci undergoes
  proteolytic cleavage to produce a truncated form as a repressor for target gene
  transcription (a). With Hh, the pathway activator Smo is relieved from receptor
  Ptc inhibition to get phosphorylation and plasma membrane accumulation, which triggers
  a series of phosphorylation events on Cos2 and Fu. Eventually, full-length Ci is
  stabilized to enter nucleus activating target gene expression (b). c and d In vertebrates,
  the principal rule of Hh signal transduction is conserved. However, several differences
  are indeed existing: signaling activation takes place at the primary cilia instead
  of plasma membrane, Sufu plays a more critical role to transduce signal rather than
  Fu, and Cos2 homolog Kif7 obtains phosphorylation at basal condition but not during
  Hh signal activation'
