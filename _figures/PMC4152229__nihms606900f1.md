caption: There are two apoptosis pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic
  pathway is activated by cellular stress. When activated, the BH3-only proteins inhibit
  antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins and induce BAK/BAX oligomerization and permeabilization
  of the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c and SMAC/DIABLO. Cytochrome c forms
  a complex with caspase-9 and APAF-1, leading to activation of caspase-9. Caspase-9
  activates the executioner caspases (caspase-3, −6, and −7) and induces cell death.
  The extrinsic pathway is activated by death signals mediated by death ligands. The
  death ligand activates the death receptor, which forms a complex called the death-inducing
  signaling complex (DISC) and sends a signal to activate caspase-8 and −10. Caspase-8
  and −10 activate caspase-3. In some cells, the extrinsic pathway crosstalks with
  the intrinsic pathway through caspase-8–mediated truncation of BID to tBID. tBID
  activates BAK/BAX oligomerization and induces apoptosis through the mitochondrial
  pathway.

  description: There are two apoptosis pathways, intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic
    pathway is activated by cellular stress. When activated, the BH3-only proteins

    of the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c and SMAC/DIABLO. Cytochrome c
    forms a complex with caspase-9 and APAF-1, leading to activation of caspase-9.
    Caspase-9 activates the executioner caspases (caspase-3, −6, and −7) and induces
    cell death. The extrinsic pathway is activated by death signals mediated by death
    ligands. The death ligand activates the death receptor, which forms a complex

    pathway crosstalks with the intrinsic pathway through caspase-8–mediated truncation
    of BID to tBID. tBID activates BAK/BAX oligomerization and induces apoptosis through
    the mitochondrial pathway.
