caption: Increasing number of studies indicate that circulating EVs may play a critical
  role in modulating CLL tumor microenviroment. CLL MVs are shown to activate the
  bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) via transfer of bioactive molecules including
  Axl receptor tyrosine kinase. In turn, the activated BMSCs produce increased levels
  of VEGF, a survival factor for the leukemic B-cells. Interaction of CLL BMSCs with
  CLL MVs has also been shown to activate the β-catenin signaling pathway leading
  to increased expression of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, important regulators of cell cycle.
  On the other hand, CLL-derived exosomes are actively incorporated by endothelial
  cells and mesenchymal stem cells ex vivo and in vivo and that the transfer of exosomal
  protein and microRNA induces an inflammatory phenotype in the target cells, which
  resembles the phenotype of cancer-associated fibroblasts. CLL-EVs released by activated
  CLL B-cells are reported to augment immune synapse activity while downregulating
  CD69 expression levels on CD4+ T cells. In total it is likely that CLL EVs target
  diverse cell types in bone marrow or other lymphoid tissues to reprogram the function
  of CLL tumor microenvironment favoring the disease process.
