caption: Model illustrating possible functions of DGAT1 and DGAT2 in human skeletal
  muscle cells. DGAT1 is dominant in human skeletal muscle cells utilizing FAs derived
  from various sources (exogenously supplied, de novo FA synthesis or FA derived from
  lipolysis) to generate TAG, both through the monoacylglycerol pathway and the de
  novo pathway from glycerol-3-P. DGAT2 seems to be specialised only for the synthesis
  of TAG, involving de novo incorporation of the glycerol moiety into TAG. Moreover,
  DGAT1 seems to operate at higher substrate concentrations, whereas DGAT2 may esterify
  substrates at lower concentrations for storage in TAG. Fatty acid oxidation from
  exogenous FA is regulated by DGAT activities. DAG, diacylglycerol; DGAT, diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase; FA, fatty acid; Glycerol-3-P, glycerol-3-phosphate; MAG, monoacylglycerol;
  TAG, triacylglycerol; TAG′ and TAG″, heterogeneous pools of TAG.
