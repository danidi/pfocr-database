caption: The drawing represents a composite model derived from references–, although
  further studies will be necessary to fully understand the architecture of the Shieldin
  complex. The Shieldin complex links 53BP1–Rif1 recognition of nucleosomes flanking
  DSBs to single stranded DNA at the break site. Shieldin may limit end resection
  by preventing the action of nucleases that resect DNA with a 5’ to 3′ polarity.
  Additionally, Shieldin is required for localization of the CST complex, which interacts
  with DNA Polα -primase and could counteract end resecting nucleases by fill-in DNA
  synthesis on the resected 3′ end of single stranded DNA at break sites. This 53BP1–Rif1–Shieldin–CST
  pathway is necessary to promote NHEJ during class switch recombination at immunoglobulin
  loci and following PARP inhibitor treatment of BRCA1 mutant cells. Ub, ubiquitin
  on lysine 15 of histone H2A; Me2, dimethylation on lysine 20 of histone H4.
