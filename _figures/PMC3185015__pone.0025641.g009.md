caption: 'Male and female fetal germ cells have acquired independent mechanisms to
  regulate their differentiation. In the fetal testis, Mvh is required to promote
  germ cell proliferation. FGF9 secreted by Sertoli cells promotes germ cell survival
  and may inhibit entry into meiosis. Then Nanos2 promotes differentiation into gonocytes
  and meiosis inhibition. RSPO1 has been shown to be a secreted activator of β-catenin.
  In fetal ovary, RSPO1/β-catenin signalling pathway promotes germ cell proliferation.
  Then, in addition to the retinoic acid (RA) signaling pathway, RSPO1 contributes
  in meiosis entry as a parallel pathway (indicated by the presence of two parallel
  arrows). RSPO1 promotes Stra8 expression and subsequently meiosis initiation. Although
  we showed that RSPO1 is a direct activator of β-catenin in XX germ cells suggesting
  that RSPO1 is also acting via β-catenin in this developmental process, the direct
  inactivation of β-catenin in XX germ cells remains to be done. Yellow-filled circles:
  undifferentiated germ cells; blue-filled and pink-filled circles: respectively male
  and female germ cells at the differentiating stage. RA: Retinoic Acid.'
