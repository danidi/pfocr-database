caption: Effects of Hfe deficiency and the associated low hepcidin and intracellular
  iron levels on macrophage TLR4 signaling. Based on our analysis of TLR2-, TLR3-
  and TLR4-activated responses, the impaired LPS-induced production of TNFα, IL-6
  and IFNβ in the Hfe-deficient macrophages is likely to be caused by an abnormality
  in an early step of TLR4 signal transduction specific to the TRAM/TRIF pathway (indicated
  by the red bracket). Green arrows indicate activating responses, red lines designate
  inhibitory effects, and black lines represent protein-protein interactions.
