caption: Akt1 signaling and control of skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. Anabolic
  signals (e.g. testosterone) initiate phosphorylation (P) of Akt1, which activates
  protein synthesis via the mTOR pathway. At the same time, Akt1(P) inactivates FOXO3a
  by phosphorylation and facilitates translocation of FOXO3a out of the nucleus, resulting
  in inhibition of the atrophy-related genes (atrogens), and thereby decreasing protein
  degradation. On the other hand, catabolic stimuli (e.g. glucocorticoids) dephosphorylate
  and thereby inactivate the Akt1 protein. Inactivation of the Akt1 protein allows
  expression of FOXO3a in the nucleus and subsequent activation of the atrogens, resulting
  in protein degradation. (Figure adapted from G.A. Nader) [].
