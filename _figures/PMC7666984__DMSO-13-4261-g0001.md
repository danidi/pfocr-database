caption: 'TLR4 signaling pathway (schematic). After LBP- and CD14-mediated LPS binding
  or FetA-mediated FFA binding, the TLR4/MD-2 complex recruits MyD88 or TRIF via TIRAP
  and TRAM.27 This action, in turn, induces (1) the MyD88-dependent pathway.29 MyD88
  binds with the IRAK/TRAF6 complex (Complex I) and TAK1/TAB complex (Complex II),
  subsequently triggering the activation of IKK. IκBα is phosphorylated by activation
  of IKK and stimulates the translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, where NF-κB leads
  to the production of ROS and proinflammatory cytokines. Complex II can also trigger
  the MAPK pathway and lead to the activation of p38, JNK and ERK1/2. This activation
  stimulates the translocation of AP-1 into the nucleus, and proinflammatory cytokines
  are subsequently transcribed. (2) In the MyD88-independent pathway,34 TLR4 is stimulated
  by LPS and associates with translocating chain-associated membrane protein (TRAM)
  and TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β (TRIF). The dimerization
  of TRAM and TRIF activates the TRAF6-TAK1-IKK pathway. Alternatively, TBK1 kinase
  can activate interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 by phosphorylating it. Activated
  IRF3 can migrate to the nucleus and act as a transcription factor. Interferon (IFN)-1β
  binds to activated IRF3 and subsequently activates the production proinflammatory
  cytokines. Furthermore, two potential targeting points blocking TLR4 signal-pathway
  have been found according to the literature: (a) FP7 blocks the TLR4 signaling pathway
  by targeting MD2 and CD14; (b) dioscin inhibits the TLR4 signaling pathway by decreasing
  NF-κB expression.'
