caption: Biogenesis mechanism of (a) exosomes and (b) MV, and their release processes
  which are coordinated through two different intracellular pathways, such as exosomes
  generation pathway and lysosomal degradation pathway. The exosomes formation starts
  with an active process, called endocytosis, where the cells internalized the material
  in the extracellular fluid to form internal vesicles (early and late endosomes).
  Through the inward budding of the late endosomal membrane, multivesicular bodies
  (MVBs) are formed. Moreover, MVBs can fuse with the lysosomes where their content
  is degraded or can traffic and fuse with the plasma membrane to release the content
  into the extracellular matrix. The exosomes generation pathway can be regulated
  through ESCRT-dependent or via ESCRT-independent pathway. Both processes, (MVBs
  fusion with the plasma membrane and exosomes release) use for regulation Rab GTPases
  (Rab7A < Rab11, Rab27A, Rab27B, and Rab35) and SNARE protein complex.
