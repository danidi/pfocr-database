caption: 'Central Role of Mammalian Dendritic Cells (DCs) in Innate and Adaptive Immunity
  to Fungi.Innate immune responses to fungi are mainly orchestrated by phagocytes
  and the epithelium. Toxins secreted by fungi such as candidalysin can directly damage
  epithelial membranes and trigger a danger-response signaling pathway that activates
  epithelial immunity []. Paneth cells produce molecules with antimicrobial activity
  as well as cytokines that can recruit other immune cells to contribute to fungal
  clearance [, , ]. Phagocytes such as macrophages are activated by interferon (IFN)-γ
  produced by T helper (Th)1 cells, and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells (not
  shown) can also play a pivotal role during superficial systemic infections []. The
  chemokine receptor CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocytes express C-type lectin receptors
  (CLRs) that recognize the fungal component of the microbiota and promote antifungal
  immunity []. Neutrophils are activated by interleukin (IL)-17 produced by Th17 and
  γδ T cells (not shown), and are important at mucosal sites []. Th17 cells also produce
  IL-22 that promotes secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as β-defensins
  by epithelial cells []. CLR expression on DCs is important for sensing fungi and
  activating antigen-specific CD4+ T cell differentiation. Diverse subsets of DCs
  are present at different anatomical tissue sites and their CLR expression patterns
  as well as their roles during fungal infections are emerging. For instance, CD103+CD11b+RALDH+
  DCs regulate gut mycobiota by promoting Th17 immunity, Foxp3+ Treg induction, and
  IgA production []. By contrast, CD103+CD11b− DCs can support Th1 immunity via IL-12
  production [, , ]. Questions (?) remain regarding CLR expression in the nonhematopoietic
  component (i.e., epithelial and endothelial cells) of different tissues. This becomes
  relevant at mucosal sites where epithelial cells provide a crucial first line of
  defense against pathogens, whereas endothelial cells may play a pivotal role during
  systemic infections. Abbreviations: NET, neutrophil extracellular trap; RA, retinoic
  acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; Treg, regulatory
