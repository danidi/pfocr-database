caption: 'Cumulative pathological and experimental evidence indicates that cell type-specific
  characteristics modulate the vulnerability of specific neuronal populations to mutant
  huntingtin expression. Striatal medium spiny neurons (MSN) and cortical neurons
  affected in HD project axons to anatomically distant target structures outside the
  striatum and the cortex, respectively. In contrast, striatal and cortical interneurons
  (IN) that are largely spared in HD bear short axons that remain within the boundaries
  of these brain structures. Differences in biochemical content may also contribute
  to the differential vulnerability of these neuronal populations, but the underlying
  pathogenic mechanisms remain unknown. MSNs are GABA-ergic projection neurons (GABA,
  blue circles) and receive brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF, yellow circles)
  from cortical glutamatergic (Glutamate, red circles), as well as dopaminergic afferents
  (Dopamine, white circles) from the substantia nigra (SN). Interestingly, more vulnerable
  MSNs in the “indirect pathway” express enkephalin peptides (Enkephalin, green circles)
  and D2 dopamine receptors (white ovals, bottom), while less vulnerable MSNs in the
  “direct pathway” express substance P/dynorphin (purple circles) and D1 receptors
  (white ovals, top). Abbreviations: MSN: medium spiny neuron; IN: interneuron; BDNF:
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor; D1: dopamine receptor subtype 1; D2: dopamine
  receptor subtype 2; NMDAR: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor; GABA: γ-aminobutyric
  acid; GPe: external globus pallidus; GPi: internal globus pallidus; SN: substantia
  nigra; STN: subthalamic nucleus.'
