caption: Schematic representation of the suggested mechanisms of vasodilation in response
  to local applied pressure. Our results show that the local pressure stimulus leads
  to a release of CGRP and neuronal NO by the primary afferent nerves. CGRP then induces
  the release of NO by the endothelium and subsequent relaxation of vascular smooth
  muscle. The results suggest that prostaglandins are involved in PIV. They may act
  at different levels. Neuronal NO participates to this reflex probably through the
  release of endothelial NO due to CGRP. Neurokinins do not appear to have any role
  in this reflex. The level at which each antagonist functions is indicated. Antagonists
  are represented in oval, negative signs represent inhibitory effects and positive
  signs represent stimulatory effects on the pathway.
