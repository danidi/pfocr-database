caption: 'Regulation of cholesterol homeostasis by CYP46A1 is neuroprotective in Huntington’s
  disease. Left : Cholesterol homeostasis is dramatically dysregulated in Huntington’s
  disease (HD). Despite a decrease of lanosterol and 7-lathosterol, cholesterol is
  slightly increased, due to down regulation of CYP46A1 expression. Right : Restoration
  of CYP46A1 expression in Huntington’s disease increases cholesterol catabolism,
  thereby decreasing cholesterol content. It also increases levels of lanosterol and
  desmosterol, which protect striatal neurons from Exp-HTT-mediated toxicity. CYP46A1
  displays a potent neuroprotective effect in Huntington’s disease likely by increasing
  cholesterol turnover and Bloch pathway activity.'
