caption: Lignin biosynthesis pathway in plants. The monolignols (coniferyl alcohol,
  sinapyl alcohol, and p-coumaryl alcohol) synthesized from phenylalanine through
  the general phenylpropanoid pathway (A) and monolignol-specific pathway (B) are
  oxidized and incorporated into the G (guaiacyl), S (syringyl) and H (hydroxyphenyl)
  units, respectively, in the complex and three-dimensional polymer of lignin (C).
  Oligolignols, which are formed during lignin polymerization, are racemic radical
  coupling products of monolignols. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; C4H, cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; C3H, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; HCT,

  caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase;
  COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase
