caption: A framework for modeling bioelectrical signaling. A comprehensive model synthesizing
  bioelectrical and genetic pathway elements must integrate physiological descriptions
  of the ion channels and pumps expressed in cells into a quantitative picture of
  the voltage gradients, their effects on movement of small signaling molecules through
  gap junctions and membrane transporters, and ultimately effects on second messenger
  pathways and transcriptional responses. Here is shown a representative system (motivated
  by current models of early left-right patterning of frog embryos; the schematic
  was modified after Fig. 7B of [] drawn by Junji Morokuma). Differential expression
  and function of well-characterized channels and pumps (e.g. V-ATPase, KCNQ1, and
  Katp) form circuits that establish distinct Vmem levels in different cells; this
  process can be mathematically modeled (as has been done for kidney, lens, and inner
  ear tissues) based on the known physiological properties of the translocators involved.
  The resulting voltage gradients gate gap junction connectivity states between adjacent
  cells, as well as exert electromotive force that regulates the movement of small
  signaling molecules (e.g. 5HT serotonin). This movement can be simulated using particle-tracking
  or differential equations. The resulting morphogen gradients can activate transcriptional
  changes, setting up prepatterns of gene expression that mirror the earlier voltage
  gradients, regionalizing tissues and closing the link between bioelectric events
  and specification of anatomy.
