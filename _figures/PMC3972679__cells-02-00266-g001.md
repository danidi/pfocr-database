caption: The two pathways of apoptosis. There are two major pathways of apoptosis
  in mammalian cells, the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The intrinsic pathway
  is activated by cellular stresses (such as high glucose concentrations or growth
  factor deprivation) and results in activation of the BH3-only members of the Bcl-2
  family (such as Bim and Puma) that initiate apoptosis signaling by binding to the
  Bcl-2-like pro-survival proteins (including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and release of Bax
  and/or Bak to promote loss of mitochondrial outer membrane potential, cytochrome
  c release and activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway
  is initiated by activation of death receptors, such as Fas, that have an intracellular
  death domain. This results in formation of a death-inducing signaling complex in
  which the initiator caspase, caspase-8 is activated by its adaptor FAS-associated
  death domain (FADD). This results in activation of the caspase cascade and apoptosis.
  The BH3-only protein Bid is essential for death receptor-mediated apoptosis in beta
  cells, thereby providing cross-talk between the two apoptotic pathways.
