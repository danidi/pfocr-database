caption: Macrophages subtypes exist and can be broadly categorized as pro-inflammatory
  M1 or alternatively activated M2, although in vivo studies reveal that macrophage
  plasticity results in a spectrum of macrophage phenotypes. M1 macrophages are polarized
  from precursor M0 macrophages via the classical pathway, wherein components of bacteria
  such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and type 1 T-helper (Th1) inflammatory cytokines
  interferon γ (IFNγ) and TNFα drive expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such
  as TNFα. In contrast, M2 macrophages are activated by type 2 (Th2) cytokines IL-4
  and IL-13. M2 macrophages are resident in lean adipose and are thought to be involved
  in remodeling, tissue repair, and maintenance of insulin sensitivity through the
  production and expression of IL-10, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and arginase-1. Plasticity
  along the polarization spectrum is an intensely investigated topic. M1 macrophages
  tend to utilize the glycolytic pathway for energy and metabolite generation, while
  M2 macrophages are reliant upon β-oxidation of fatty acids. Regulating macrophage
  substrate metabolism is one potential means for manipulation of the inflammatory
  response.
