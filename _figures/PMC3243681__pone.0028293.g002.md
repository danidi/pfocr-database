caption: miR-451 levels determine cell migration or proliferation in response to glucose
  (blue triangle on the left). (A) Low glucose level reduces miR-451 and leads to
  upregulation of AMPK and enhanced cell motility. (B) Normal glucose level upregulates
  miR-451, which in turn leads to increased proliferation and decreased cell migration
  by inhibiting CAB39-LKB1-AMPK pathway. Schematic components of miR-451 and the CAB39/LKB1/AMPK
  complex is represented by modules ‘M’ (box with red dotted line) and ‘A’ (box with
  blue dotted line) in our theoretical framework. Blue arrows on the right indicate
  the switching behavior between a migratory mode in (A) and the proliferative state
  in (B) in response to fluctuating glucose.
