caption: 'KEAP1 glycosylation regulates the NRF2 pathway. O-GlcNAc is a single monosaccharide
  post-translational modification of intracellular proteins. O-GlcNAc is added to
  substrates by the glycosyltransferase OGT using the nucleotide-sugar donor UDP-GlcNAc,
  and is removed by the glycoside hydrolase OGA. UDP-GlcNAc is synthesized by the
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway from glucose, glutamine, acetyl-CoA and UTP, making
  O-GlcNAcylation a sentinel for several key metabolites. We found that O-GlcNAcylation
  of the adaptor protein KEAP1 is required for its optimal interaction with the ubiquitin
  E3 ligase CUL3, and for its ability to mediate the ubiquitination and destruction
  of the transcription factor NRF2, a master regulator of the cellular antioxidant
  stress response. The NRF2 pathway is inappropriately activated in many human tumors,
  conferring a growth advantage and treatment resistance. Our results suggest that
  it may be possible to suppress NRF2 signaling through the pharmacological enforcement
  of KEAP1 glycosylation, thereby sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapies or radiation.
