caption: Xc-Myc is required for the normal expression of the XSlug and XTwist transcription
  factors, either of which are sufficient to rescue the defects in vascular and lymphatic
  development provoked by knockdown of Xc-Myc. Knockdown of XSlug also disrupts normal
  patterns of Xc-Myc expression, indicating a positive feedback loop. Knockdown of
  both XSlug and XTwist in lateral plate mesoderm, but not neural crest, results in
  the vascular defects observed after knockdown of Xc-Myc indicating both genes operate
  in the same pathway and downstream of c-myc. Either ectopic Slug or Twist rescue
  defects in endogenous XSlug or XTwist expression induced by Xc-Myc knockdown, indicating
  that they also regulate each other’s expression.
