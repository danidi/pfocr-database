caption: Sonic hedgehog pathway. In the absence of ligand, the Sonic hedgehog (Shh)
  receptor, patched (PTCH) inhibits signaling through inhibition of the transmembrane
  protein Smoothened (SMO). Ligand occupation of PTCH inactivates the receptor and
  allows activation of SMO that, in turn, results in the induction of GLI transcription
  factors. Vismodegib, cyclopamine, and itraconazole are inhibitors of SMO whereas
  arsenic trioxide acts by inhibiting GLI.
