caption: A schematic illustration of unfolded protein response (UPR) and the effects
  of salicylic acid (SA) under stress condition in plants. The accumulation of unfolded
  proteins in the ER leads to the conformational changes and activated RNAse function
  of IRE1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), which mediates an unconventional splicing
  bZIP60 transcription factor mRNA. Spliced bZIP60 mRNA is translated to an active
  transcription factor and translocated to the nucleus and upregulates UPR genes containing
  unfolded protein response element (UPRE) and ER stress element (ERSE) in their promoters.
  bZIP28 and bZIP17 are activated by Golgi proteases (S2P and S1P). Then, the cleaved
  forms of bZIPs translocate into the nucleus and binds to ERSE to activate the UPR
  gene expression. NAC062 and NAC089 also undergo proteolytic cleavage and translocate
  to the nucleus to promote the transcription of UPR or cell death genes. SA has multifaceted
  roles in the regulation of defense or cell death processes in plants. SA is synthesized
  by phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) from L-phenylalanine (Phe) or in the isochorismate
  (IC) pathway by isochorismate synthase (ICS). Then through the activity of isochorismate
  pyruvate lyase (IPL) in the chloroplast, it is translocated to the cytosol by EDS5.
  SA induces high production of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) in
  chloroplast and mitochondria and activates NADPH oxidase, respectively. Simultaneously,
  SA activates various antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutases (SOD). SA
  induces cytochrome c (Cyt c) release from the mitochondrial inner membrane by the
  permeability transition pore (PTP), decreases the transcript levels of Bax inhibitor-1
  (BI-1), and increases the expression of vacuolar processing enzymes (VPEs) inducing
  cell death. Moreover, SA has a significant effect on polyamine levels (e.g. that
  of spermine), influencing ER stress in plants. SA changes the redox homeostasis
  and induces the reduction and monomerization of NPR1, which is translocated to the
  nucleus where it binds to specific TGA transcriptions factors, inducing the expression
  of SA-induced defensive response genes (PRs). SA can be inactivated and stored as
  SA O-β-glucoside (SAG) in the vacuole. Detailed description and references are in
  the text.
