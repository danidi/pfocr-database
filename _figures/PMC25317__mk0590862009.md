caption: A model of cooperation between the Ssp1 and Spc1 pathways during osmotic
  stress. Osmotic stress promotes recruitment of the Ssp1 kinase at the plasma membrane,
  which in turn stimulates actin reorganization. At the same time the stress signal
  activates the Spc1 MAP kinase pathway, resulting in increased expression of stress-response
  genes. One of the consequences is stimulation of the glycerol biosynthesis pathway.
  Both Spc1 and Ssp1 pathways contribute to the osmotic stress adaptation process.
  Once the balance is reestablished, Ssp1 is released from the plasma membrane.
