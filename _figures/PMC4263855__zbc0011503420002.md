caption: Molecular events giving rise to Aβ and tau pathologies. On the outside of
  the cell, the combined action of β- and γ-secretase cleavage of the transmembrane
  APP gives rise to soluble amyloid precursor protein β (sAPPβ) and secreted Aβ, which
  can then self-associate to form Aβ oligomers. These Aβ oligomers then combine to
  form higher order amyloid plaques. The APP intracellular domain (AICD) is also liberated
  by this secretase pathway. On the inside of the cell, phosphorylation of the tau
  protein promotes its dissociation from microtubules, enabling its aggregation to
  form competent nuclei or tau oligomers, which can then grow to form larger PHFs.
  These PHFs aggregate to form the higher order NFTs that are clinically observed
  in the AD brain.
