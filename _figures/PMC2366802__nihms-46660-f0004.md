caption: 'Possible role of GPCR oligomerization in arrestin-mediated signaling. Receptor-bound
  arrestins were shown to recruit >20 different trafficking and signaling proteins
  to the complex [,]. (a) A comparison of the size of the receptor, arrestin and arrestin
  interaction partners suggests that a unitary arrestin–receptor complex cannot bind
  more than four to six proteins at the same time []. Arrestin-mediated scaffolding
  of each MAP kinase pathway (c-Raf-1→MEK1→ERK1/2 or ASK1→MKK4→JNK3) requires simultaneous
  recruitment of three proteins, where members of the same cascade must be close enough
  and correctly oriented relative to each other to make these complexes productive.
  For example, ASK1 in the left complex and one JNK3 in the right complex cannot participate
  in signaling because their necessary additional partners are absent. (b) It is tempting
  to speculate that receptor oligomers (a dimer is shown for simplicity), with each
  receptor bound to its own arrestin [], increase the size of the scaffolding surface,
  thereby making the assembly of productive complexes more likely. For example, three
  complete MAP kinase cascades are assembled here, as opposed to only two on a pair
  of separate arrestin–receptor complexes shown in (a). Multi-arrestin scaffolds may
  also ensure ‘economies of scale’: for example, one molecule of E3 ubiquitin ligase
  Mdm2 might ubiquitinate both arrestins in the complex, saving room for additional
  partners. (c) Internalization can serve as an alternative mechanism yielding a similar
  increase in the scaffolding surface. Receptor binding induces the release of the
  arrestin C tail, which carries clathrin and AP-2-binding sites (shown as blue boxes
  on the arrestin C tail). Arrestin-mediated GPCR recruitment to the coated pit may
  create evenly spaced arrays of many arrestin–receptor complexes reproducing spatial
  organization of the clathrin coat. These multicomplex assemblies might be large
  enough to recruit the components of both MAP kinase cascades along with other signaling
  molecules. Finally, mechanisms illustrated in (b) and (c) are not mutually exclusive:
  arrestin-mediated receptor organization in the coated pit may work together with
  receptor oligomerization to enable efficient arrestin-mediated signaling. Abbreviations:
