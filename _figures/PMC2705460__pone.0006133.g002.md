caption: Gene model IDs for P. sojae are shown for each step on the pathway. The probable
  origin of each gene model based on PHYML analysis is listed as bacterial, metazoan,
  plant or unknown. The oomycete pathway closely mirrors the plant biosynthetic strategy,
  but has one fewer step and the majority of enzymes appear to be of bacterial origin.
