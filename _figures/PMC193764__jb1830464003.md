caption: 'Proposed metabolic pathways for PHA biosynthesis in recombinant E. coli
  strain from fatty acid through β-oxidation pathway. Enoyl-CoA hydratase, epimerase
  and 3-ketoacyl-CoA or ACP reductase have been employed to supply PHA precursors.
  The following letters in parentheses represent the indicated enzymes: A, enzymes
  that have not been elucidated in E. coli; B, amplified enzymes to supply PHA precursors
  FabG (, , ), RhlG (), and PhaJ (, , , ); C, enzymes that are activated when the
  FadB is inactivated − YfcX (), MaoC (this study); X, enzymes that should be inactivated
  to supply PHA precursors from fatty acid (, , , , , ).'
