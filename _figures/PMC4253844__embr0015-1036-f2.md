caption: Brain cells are cut off from blood supply as the blood–brain barrier prevents
  entry of lipoproteins. Cholesterol is synthesized by different types of glial cells
  as indicated by the zagged pathway symbol. Some neurons may import cholesterol from
  APOE-expressing astrocytes via lipoprotein uptake (LRP1) and hydroxylate surplus
  cholesterol to 24-OHC, which is excreted via ABCA1 and which enters the blood circulation.
  24-OHC is able to cross the blood–brain barrier where it may signal the level of
  plasma cholesterol levels to cells in the brain. Cholesterol-related proteins with
  cell-specific distribution are indicated.
