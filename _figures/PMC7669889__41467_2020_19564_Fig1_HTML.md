caption: a The GED cycle, the simplest carbon fixation pathway that can be generated
  from E. coli endogenous enzymes. The pathway is based on the reductive carboxylation
  of ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) to 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) by Gnd, followed by the
  activity of the Entner–Doudoroff pathway (enzymes Edd and Eda) to produce pyruvate
  and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP). Pyruvate is converted to GAP via gluconeogenesis
  and the intermediates phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG). To
  close the cycle, GAP is recycled to Ru5P via the pentose phosphate pathway. The
  GED cycle mirrors the ribulose bisphosphate cycle (i.e., Calvin–Benson cycle), which
  is shown in gray. b, c Two other general archetypes of carbon fixation pathways
  that were computationally uncovered. Both are based on integrated cycles, which
  together reduce CO2 to formate and then assimilate formate into pyruvate. AcCoA
  corresponds to acetyl-CoA and PrCoA corresponds to propionyl-CoA. CH2-THF corresponds
  to methylene-THF. d A phylogenetic tree of bacteria, showing the three phyla that
  harbor all key enzymes of the GED cycle (shown in color). Numbers in parentheses
  correspond to the number of species in which the key pathway enzymes were found.
