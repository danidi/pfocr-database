caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of YAP/TAZ activation in CMS4 CRC. YAP/TAZ activation
  in CRC may operate through inactivation of negative regulatory mechanisms (red arrows):
  inactivation of the core kinases of the Hippo pathway, MST1/2 and LATS1/2, or inactivation
  of the ß-catenin destruction complex composed of APC, Axin and GSK3ß. YAP/TAZ activation
  can also occur through positive mechanisms of the regulation (black arrows) such
  as downstream from Gp130 via the src kinase family (SFK). In CMS4 CRC, YAP/TAZ activation
  is promoted by the cellular prion protein PrPC. Candidate upstream regulators of
  YAP/TAZ in CMS4 CRC are VEGFR, prostaglandins (PGE2) acting through the G-protein
  receptor coupled (GPCR) EP4 receptor or matrix stiffness resulting from the tumour
  infiltration by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). Red and black arrows indicate
  negative and positive mechanisms of regulation, respectively.'
