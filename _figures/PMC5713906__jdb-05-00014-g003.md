caption: Hypothesis for what occurs during a pathogenic interaction with Hh signaling.
  Pathogens that cause damage to the host tissue promote activation of Hh signaling
  due to the key roles it plays in repair processes and immunity (green boxes). If
  not regulated properly, these cellular processes can cause fibrosis and an imbalanced
  immune response, respectively (red boxes). Pathogens, such as Influenza, EBV, HBC,
  HCV, HIV, and H.p., have been shown to directly modulate pathway activity once signaling
  is activated and may do so in order to exacerbate or restrain these detrimental
  outcomes.
