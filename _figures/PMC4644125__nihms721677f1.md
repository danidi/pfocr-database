caption: Signaling schematic depicting our hypothesis of how adenosine regulates HCASMC
  cell-cycle progression. Extracellular mitogens activate classical signal transduction
  pathways that ultimately phosphorylate (and thus activate) ERK1/2 and Akt. ERK1/2
  is well known to increase expression of cyclin D (G1 phase cyclin). Phosphorylated
  Akt activates a signal transduction pathway that stabilizes Skp2, which is the F-box
  protein of SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase that polyubiquitinates p27Kip1 and thus accelerates
  the degradation of p27Kip1. Removal of p27Kip1 de-inhibits cyclin D activity. Cyclin
  D activates cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 to hyper-phosphorylate retinoblastoma
  protein (Rb), thus releasing the transcription factor E2F and allowing increased
  expression of G1/S and S phase cyclins. G1/S and S phase cyclins then drive the
  cell cycle forward to complete mitogensis and cytokinesis (cell proliferation).
  Adenosine stimulates A2B receptors that are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase,
  which increases the formation cAMP and activates protein kinase A. Protein kinase
  A decreases expression of Skp2 and inhibits phosphorylation of Akt, resulting in
  increased levels of p27Kip1 which reduce cyclin D activity. Protein kinase A also
  inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2 which reduces cyclin D expression. This PKA-induced
  signaling converges at cyclin D. This results in inhibition of Rb hyper-phosphorylation,
  and hypophophorylated Rb can now bind E2F and prevent this transcription factor
  from increasing the expression of G1/S and S phase cyclins.
