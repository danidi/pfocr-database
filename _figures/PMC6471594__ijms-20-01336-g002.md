caption: 'Cilia-dependent regulation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Schematic
  representation of the Hedgehog pathway repression and activation, in the presence
  or absence of a ligand. In Panel “ON”, in the presence of ligand binding to PTCH1
  receptor, SMO moves into the cilium, and PTCH1 is displaced outside. In the cilium,
  SMO inhibits SUFU, and it activates GLI transcription factors (GLIA), which, in
  turn, activate the expression of target genes. In contrast, in Panel “OFF”, in the
  absence of a ligand, PTCH1 receptor localizes at the primary cilium, and the 7-transmembrane
  domain protein SMO is in vesicles outside the cilium. GLI transcription factors
  are sequestered and suppressed by SUFU, and processed into their repressive forms
  (GLIR), thus repressing the expression of target genes. If the pathway is misregulated,
  “HYPER ON” (i.e., SMO, PTCH1 mutations, in medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma),
  the activation of the pathway throughout the cilium can induce tumorigenesis, and
  targeting of the cilium can turn off the pathway and reduce cell proliferation.
  On the other hand, if the misregulation of the pathway arises downstream (i.e.,
  GLI2 mutations), the loss of the cilium can also boost medulloblastoma or basal
  cell carcinoma development, suggesting that the role of primary cilia in Hedgehog
  misregulation-driven cancers depends on the oncogenic alteration. GLI: GLI family
  zinc fingers; PTCH1: Patched-1; SMO: Smoothened; SUFU: Suppressor of Fused.'
