caption: (A) The MAPKKK Ste11 and MAPKK Ste7 function in both the mating and filamentation
  pathways in yeast. Ste7 must select the appropriate MAPK to phosphorylate in response
  to input (Fus3 for α-factor, and Kss1 in response starvation). (B) During mating,
  stimulation with α-factor leads primarily to phosphorylation of Fus3. This reaction
  requires the scaffold protein Ste5. Starvation input specifically induces the filamentation
  response through phosphorylation of Kss1. The Ste5 scaffold is not required for
  filamentation. (C) Expression of a constitutively active allele of MAPKKK Ste11
  in a strain lacking Ste5 results only in Kss1 phosphorylation (both Kss1 and Fus3
  phosphorylation are observed in strains with Ste5), further indicating that the
  Ste5 scaffold is required, in vivo, for Ste11➔Ste7➔Fus3 signaling ().
