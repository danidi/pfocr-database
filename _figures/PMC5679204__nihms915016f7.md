caption: Upon binding to CD47, TSP1 activates the Nox1 complex, which generates robust
  and sustained accumulation of ROS. In turn, this triggers committed senescence through
  a pathway involving p53-p21cip–induced DNA damage response and decreased Rb phosphorylation.
  This pathway can be disrupted using the selective Nox1 inhibitor NoxA1ds.
