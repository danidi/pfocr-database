caption: Signaling pathways involved in SSc pathogenesis that may also play a role
  in EndoMT. The diagram shows the TGF-β, ET-1, NOTCH, and Wnt pathways, as well as,
  other putative pathways such as cellular stress and hypoxia that may participate
  in the EndoMT process and may be involved in SSc pathogenesis. One central pathway
  is initiated following TGF-β-binding and subsequent activation of the ALK-1-mediated
  Smad-independent TGF-β pathway. Activation of this pathway causes phosphorylation
  of GSK-3β mediated by PKC-δ and the c-Abl non-receptor kinase. Phosphorylation of
  GSK-3β at serine 9 (ser9) causes its inhibition which then allows Snail-1 to enter
  the nucleus. Nuclear accumulation of Snail-1 results in marked stimulation of Snail-1
  expression which then leads to acquisition of the myofibroblast phenotype with stimulation
  of α-SMA expression. The inhibition of GSK-3β ser9 phosphorylation by specific inhibition
  of PKC-δ or c-Abl activity allows GSK-3β to phosphorylate Snail-1 targeting it for
  proteosomal degradation and thus, effectively abolishes the acquisition of the myofibroblastic
  phenotype and the fibrotic response. ET-1 effects appear to be mediated by a synergistic
  stimulation of TGF-β-induced EndoMT involving the canonical Smad pathways although
  the possibility of a direct stimulation of EndoMT by ET-1 has also been suggested.
  Other pathways such as those involving Wnt, NOTCH, and hypoxia may also participate.
  The molecular events involved have not been fully elucidated although it is likely
  that EndoMT stimulation is mediated by Snail-1 activation. Modified from Ref. .
