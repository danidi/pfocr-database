caption: Mechanism diagram. Inhibition of MELK could reduce BCa cell proliferation
  and migration. Specifically, the down‐regulation of MELK could restrain the repair
  of DSBs and then activate the ATM/CHK2/p53 pathway, further inducing G1/S cell cycle
  arrest and leading to the suppression of BCa cell proliferation. In addition, the
  down‐regulation of MELK could suppress the EMT pathway to reduce the migration of
  BCa cells
