caption: The putative molecular mechanism by which RSVL enhances tubule network formation
  and increases microvessel growth (A), leading to increased blood perfusion and drug
  delivery into tumor and thereby resulting in enhanced anticancer effect of GEM (B).
  The implications of our findings suggest the potential clinical applications of
  RSVL to enhance the anticancer efficacy of anticancer drugs against lung cancer.
