caption: Summary of the potential mechanisms which may be involved in sustaining epithelial
  barrier function via the p-Akt signaling pathway. Note loss of local growth factors,
  including EGF and GLP2, along with respective receptors results in loss of EBF.
  Restitution of EBF, along with epithelial cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis,
  occurs in TPN mice with supplementation of glutamine or glutamate, as well as with
  exogenous growth factors.
