caption: The potential mitochondrial derangements that may be present in pulmonary
  hypertension are many and varied. This cartoon illustrates some of the areas where
  molecular or targeted therapies are being explored. 1) HIF-1α pathway has been perhaps
  the most explored metabolic pathway in pulmonary hypertension, and has both upstream
  and downstream targets; 2) HIF-1α regulates expression of many genes. In this area,
  there have been multiple noncoding RNA molecules with potential to alter downstream
  gene expression; 3) upstream from HIF-1α, regulation of appropriate redox signaling
  through augmentation of redox enzyme SOD2 has proven effective in animal models;
  4) calcium homeostasis is necessary for preventing hyperpolarization of membrane
  potential, and subsequent glycolytic transition; and 5) small signaling molecules
  derived from injured mitochondrial may prevent propagation of maladaptive phenotypes
  by attenuating proangiogenic and antiapoptotic responses.
