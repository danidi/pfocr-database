caption: A schematic model of cancer-derived IgG to enhance cell growth and proliferation
  through inducing the production of a low level of ROS. Based on our findings, we
  propose the following mechanism. The interaction between IgG and RACK1, RAN and
  PRDX1 prompted us to explore the mechanism of action of cancer-derived IgG in cell
  growth and oxidative stress. Cancer-derived IgG decreased cellular total antioxidant
  capacity including activities of some antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GR and GPx),
  the expression level of PRDX1 and GSH content. The decreased total antioxidant capacity
  in turn induces production of a low level of intracellular ROS that activates MAPK/ERK
  signaling pathway to enhance growth and proliferation of cancer cells
