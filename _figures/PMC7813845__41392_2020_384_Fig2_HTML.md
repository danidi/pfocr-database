caption: 'The role BRD4 in regulating the NF-κB pathway in inflammation and immunity.
  BRD4 regulates the activation of the NF-κB pathway caused by TLR ligands through
  at least four pathways: (1) BRD4 directly acetylates RELA through its atypical histone
  acetyltransferase activity; (2) BRD4 directly promotes the phosphorylation of RELA;
  and (3–4) BRD4 promotes the phosphorylation of RELA through inhibiting the translation
  of NFKBIA and increasing the phosphorylation of NFKBIA and IKBKB. Abbreviations:
  CDK9, cyclin-dependent kinase 9; CHUK, component of inhibitor of nuclear factor
  kappa B kinase complex; CycT1, cyclin T1; IKBKB, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa
  B kinase regulatory subunit beta; IKBKG, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase
  regulatory subunit gamma; NFKBIA, NFKB inhibitor alpha; NFKB1, nuclear factor kappa
  B subunit 1; p-TEFb, positive transcription elongation factor b; RELA, RELA proto-oncogene;
  RNA pol II, RNA polymerase II; TLR, toll-like receptor (numbers 1–9)'
