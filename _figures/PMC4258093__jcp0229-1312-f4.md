caption: Ras/MAPK signaling. Upon growth factor stimulation, the adaptor protein,
  Grb2, binds to specific phospho-tyrosine residues on activated receptors via its
  SH2 domain. Grb2 also binds to SOS and activates it at the plasma membrane, which
  then catalyzes the removal of GDP. Ras then rapidly binds GTP and adopts an active
  conformation. Activated Ras recruits Raf to the membrane leading to Raf kinase activation
  and resulting in phosphorylation and activation of MEK. Activated MEK, in turn phosphorylates
  ERK, so that it can subsequently activate its nuclear and non-nuclear substrates.
