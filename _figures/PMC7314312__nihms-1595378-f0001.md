caption: 'A. Mechanisms of AKT activation. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation
  and tyrosine phosphorylation of its cytosolic domain or of scaffolding adaptors
  create binding sites that recruit the lipid kinase PI3K to the plasma membrane.
  PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which can be dephosphorylated back to PIP2 by the lipid
  phosphatase PTEN. PIP3 acts as a second messenger to recruit the serine/threonine
  protein kinase AKT to the plasma membrane, where it is fully activated through phosphorylation
  at T308 and S473 by the PDK1 and mTORC2 protein kinases, respectively. AKT signaling
  serves to promote cell survival, growth, and proliferation, in part, by inducing
  various changes to cellular metabolism. Coloured hexagons denote common points of
  activation and inactivation by cancer-associated mutations. “P” indicates protein
  phosphorylation events.B. AKT controls cellular metabolism, in part, through three
  key downstream substrates: TSC2, GSK3, and the FOXO transcription factors. AKT phosphorylates
  and inhibits TSC2, a component of the TSC complex, to activate mTORC1 by relieving
  TSC complex-mediated inhibition of Rheb. S6K1 and 4EBP1 are canonical downstream
  targets of mTORC1, which together with other targets, serve to stimulate the processing
  and activation of the SREBP family of transcription factors and the mRNA translation
  of the MYC, HIF1α, and ATF4 transcription factors. GSK3-mediated phosphorylation
  of the transcription factors SREBP, MYC, NRF2, and HIF1α targets them for ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation.PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase and
