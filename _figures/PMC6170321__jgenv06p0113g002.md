caption: Metabolic reactions involved in the breakdown of DMSP into either dimethyl
  sulfide and acrylate, or methanethiol and acetaldehyde, and the genes encoding the
  enzymes which perform these reactions. Green arrows indicate reactions unique to
  this pathway according to the MetaCyc database . Bold red text denotes reaction
  substrates and products and yellow text denotes the enzyme involved in this reaction
  in strain SMS3. The purple text denotes the locus tag of the gene encoding the enzyme,
  and blue text denotes the EC number of the enzyme(s) required to perform each reaction.
