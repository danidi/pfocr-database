caption: 'Generation and transport of LCACs under physiological and pathophysiological
  conditions. CPT1 facilitates transesterification of a cytosolic carnitine molecule
  to LCFA-CoA, yielding LCAC plus free cytosolic CoASH. LCACs are transported across
  the mitochondrial membranes via CAC, where CPT2 catalyzes re-esterification to generate
  LCFA-CoA plus free carnitine. LCFA-CoA undergoes β-oxidation to generate reducing
  equivalents (acetyl-CoA, NADH and FADH2) required for energy generation via the
  TCA cycle and the ETC. Upstream acyl-CoA intermediates accumulate if fuel delivery
  exceeds energy generation capacity. Under these conditions, intermediates are converted
  to ketones, acetyl-carnitine or acetate. LCFA-CoA is retroconverted to LCAC and
  transported out of mitochondria and ultimately, the cell. FAODs arising from defects
  in key enzymes (e.g. CPT2, TFP and VLCAD) are characterized by the accumulation
  of LCACs and reduced ketogenesis. Inset: Primary enzymes involved in long-chain
  fatty acid metabolism. Abbreviations: CAC, carnitine–acylcarnitine translocase;
  CoA, coenzyme A; CoASH, coenzyme A with sulfhydryl functional group; CPT, carnitine
  0-palmitoyltransferase; ETC, electron transport chain; FAOD, fatty acid oxidation
  disorder; LCAC, long-chain acylcarnitine; LCFA, long-chain fatty acid; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; TFP, trifunctional protein; VLCAD, very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.
