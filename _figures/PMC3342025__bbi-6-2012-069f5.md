caption: 'Bmh2 stress pathway is conserved in tardigrades.Notes: The bmh2 pathway
  was shown to exist not only in vertebrates but also in yeast. It is also conserved
  in Hypsibius dujardini and Milnesium tardigradum. Key regulators (bmh2, Sck1) as
  well as depending metabolic enzymes are indicated together with GenBank identifiers
  (top) comparing man, yeast and H. dujardini. There are sequence similar candidate
  sequences for Lcb1 and Lcb2 in H. dujardini, but it is not known which is regulated
  by bmh2 or Sck1. Trehalase has not been found (question mark). In Milnesium tardigradum
  only the two regulators, bmh2 and Sck1 have been identified.'
