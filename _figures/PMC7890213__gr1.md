caption: Physiology of Nrf2 activation in both normal and stress conditions. In normal
  conditions, Nrf2 is associated with Keap1 by its two motifs (ETGE and DLG) that
  leads to CUL3-mediated ubiquitination followed by proteasome degradation. In oxidative
  stress, Nrf2 dissociates from Keap1, translocates to the nucleus and activates the
  ARE-gene system. KEAP1 = Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1, CUL3 = Cullin 3, DLG
  = DLG motifs, ETGE = ETGE motifs, NRF2 = Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
  2, ARE = Antioxidant response element, HO1 = Haem oxygenase-1, GSH = Glutathione,
  SOD = Superoxide dismutase.
