caption: The signalling pathways that sense and respond to three basic nutrients,
  free fatty acids, glucose and amino acids, are depicted. Many pathways that monitor
  nutrient availability, such as those of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), insulin
  and nuclear transcription factors (not shown), and the unfolded-protein response
  (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), closely interact with each other. They
  also interact with inflammatory pathways, particularly those that are induced through
  the activation of IκB kinase-β (IKKβ) and JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK). Leptin resistance
  can be induced through ER stress and through the activation of the IKK pathway when
  overnutrition is detected by the hypothalamus,. In addition to these intracellular
  points of crosstalk, nutrients may directly induce inflammation through pathogen-sensing
  receptors, such as the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling by free
  fatty acids. Dysregulation of the crosstalk between the pathways that are shown
  here can culminate in altered metabolic responses, inflammation and leptin resistance.
  IκB, inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate 1; FABP, fatty-acid
  binding protein; TNF, tumour-necrosis factor.
