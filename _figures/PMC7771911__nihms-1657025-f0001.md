caption: Autophagy plays a pivotal role in the degradation and clearance of the parasite
  Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) following macrophage infection. This pathway is regulated
  by NLRP3 which is an innate immune sensor that initiates inflammasome activation
  in response to pathogen- and damage-associated triggers. Loss of NLRP3 in macrophages
  leads to smaller autophagosomes and an inability to form autolysosomes after T.
  cruzi infection. This leads to accumulation of the parasite within the cell and
  poor clearance.
