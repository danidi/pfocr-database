caption: Apoptotic Pathways in Glioblastoma. (A) The activation of PI3K ensues by
  the binding of a ligand to a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). The RTK activation
  by phosphorylation of its intracellular domain activates the catalytic subunit of
  PI3K; this results in the generation of PIP3 from PIP2. PIP3 activates PDK1 which
  in turn phosphorylates AKT. AKT phosphorylates many downstream targets, including
  IκB to induce NFκB activation and mTORC2 and MDM2 to induce cell survival. PTEN
  antagonizes the PI3K pathway by dephosphorylating the second messenger PIP3 to PIP2.
  (B) TNF-α is a potent activator of NFκB, which binds to its receptor (TNFR1) enabling
  the degradation of IκB, by the IKK complex. This allows the translocation of NFκB
  to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of its target genes such as IAPs,
  which can directly bind and inhibit caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9. (C) A variety
  of death stimuli can induce the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria and
  trigger the formation of the apoptosome with subsequent caspase cascade activation
  leading to apoptosis. BCL-2 controls the mitochondrial membrane permeability and
  can inhibit this process, whereas BAX stimulates it. BAX is activated by p53 but
  p53 is negatively regulated by MDM2. Smac is located within the mitochondrial intermembrane
  space and enters the cytosol when cells undergo apoptosis to inhibit IAPs. Blue
  arrows denote overexpression and red arrows denote loss of function.
