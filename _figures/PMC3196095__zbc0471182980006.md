caption: Proposed model. A, schematic model that explains the role of the JNK signaling
  pathway in the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and relevant gene expression that
  leads to cardiac dysfunction during sepsis. Binding of the complex that consists
  of LPS and lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) on the TLR4 and CD14 receptors
  activates the JNK signaling pathway. In addition, inflammatory pathways are activated
  via stimulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. The JNK signaling pathway leads
  to down-regulation of the expression of fatty acid oxidation-associated genes and
  eventually causes cardiac dysfunction. B, inhibition of JNK prevents sepsis-mediated
  down-regulation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation, thus it protects cardiac function
  in sepsis despite increased levels of inflammatory cytokines.
