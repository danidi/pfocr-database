caption: Molecular pathways associated with CPPs. Several genes in the TRAIL pathway,
  along with E-cadherin, are known to be methylated in CPPs, resulting in decreased
  tumor necrosis factor–induced apoptosis and increased cell migration, respectively.
  Aberrant signaling through PDGFR and Notch3 are associated with tumor formation
  and growth. Mutations of TP53 and hSNF5/INI1 (SMARCB1), which plays an integral
  role in chromatin remodeling, have been shown to promote CPP formation, while methylation
  of TWIST1, an inhibitor of p53, and stratifin, a regulator of the G2 checkpoint,
  are also associated with CPPs.
