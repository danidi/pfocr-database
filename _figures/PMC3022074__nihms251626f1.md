caption: 'A. Healthy liver. There is very little evidence of Hedgehog (Hh) pathway
  activity in healthy adult liver, although this tissue harbors a number of different
  cell types that are capable of producing and/or responding to Hedgehog ligands.
  Two mechanisms seem to account for these low basal levels of Hh activity: 1) relative
  lack of Hh ligand production and 2) high expression of the Hh ligand antagonist,
  Hhip, by sinusoidal lining cells, such as quiescent hepatic stellate cells (Q-HSC)
  and sinusoidal endothelial cells (SEC). B. Liver epithelial cell injury. Injury
  to liver epithelial cell unleashes a cascade that results in progressive activation
  of the Hh pathway and consequent expansion of cell populations that are involved
  in liver inflammation, regeneration, and fibrogenesis. 1) Injury stimulates mature
  hepatocytes and cholangiocytes to produce and release Hh ligands into the bile,
  space of Disse, and liver sinusoids. 2) Injury represses sinusoidal lining cell
  expression of Hhip. These two responses increase exposure of Hh-responsive cell
  types (e.g., HSC, SEC, liver progenitors, cholangiocytes, and liver lymphocytes)
  to Hh ligands. 3) Hh ligands stimulate Q-HSC to undergo transition to myofibroblastic
  (MF)-HSC; enhance MF-HSC proliferation and survival; and stimulate further production
  of Hh ligands by MF-HSC. 4) Hh ligands generated by injured liver epithelial cells
  and MF-HSC enhance the proliferation and survival of liver progenitors and cholangiocytes,
  both of which also produce Hh ligands. 5) Hh ligands stimulate cholangiocytes to
  undergo EMT, thereby providing another source of myofibroblasts in injured livers.
  6) Hh-activated cholangiocytes also produce various chemokines that recruit different
  types of bone marrow-derived cells and immune cells to liver, such as fibrocytes,
  monocytes, neutrophils, T and B lymphocytes, and NKT cells. 7) Hh ligands are viability
  factors for lymphocytes, including NKT cells. Thus, they promote the accumulation
  of NKT cells within a microenvironment that is enriched with CD1d-expressing cells
  that function as antigen-presenting cells for NKT cells. 8) Hh ligands also stimulate
  NKT cells to produce pro-fibrogenic cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-13. These NKT
  cell-derived factors, as well as Hh ligands that are produced by the NKT cells themselves,
  further stimulate expansion of liver myofibroblasts by promoting growth of MF-HSC
  and inducing transition of bone marrow derived monocytes into fibrocytes. 9) The
  cumulative effects of Hh ligands on SEC promote SEC capillarization and alter liver
  blood flow by up-regulating SEC expression of CD31, adhesion factors, and nitric
  oxide. 10) Thus, injury-related activation of the Hh pathway contributes to many
  of the repair responses that typify chronic liver injury, including inflammation,
  fibrogenesis, vascular remodeling, and accumulation of progenitor populations that
  might provide the seeds for subsequent liver cancers.'
