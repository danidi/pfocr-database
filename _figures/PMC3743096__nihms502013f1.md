caption: Many physiological and pathological signals affect the activation status
  of mTORC1, including cellular nutrients and energy, growth factors, oncogenes and
  tumor suppressors, and a variety of intracellular pathogens (i.e., infectious agents).
  When activated, mTORC1 regulates a number of cellular processes, with those affecting
  the metabolic state of the cell emphasized in this model. Through various downstream
  mechanisms, mTORC1 signaling inhibits autophagy, while stimulating mRNA translation,
  glycolysis, lipid synthesis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and de novo pyrimidine
  synthesis, thereby promoting the production of energy (ATP), reducing equivalents
  (NADPH), and the major macromolecules required for cell growth.
