caption: 'The canonical Notch signaling pathway. The interaction between Notch and
  its ligands from neighboring cells results in two successive cleavage event: cleavage
  at site S2 by ADAM protease and subsequent intramembranous cleavage at S3 by γ‐secretase
  complex. This ligand‐dependent activation process generates Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD). In the nucleus, NICD forms the transcription activation complex with
  transcription factor CSL and transcriptional coactivator such as MAML1, initiating
  the transcription of target genes.'
