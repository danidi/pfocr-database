caption: Processing and presentation of MHC class I and II restricted antigens for
  CD8+ and CD4+ T cell recognition, respectively. (A) Endogenously expressed proteins
  are degraded through proteasomal degradation pathways to generate protein fragments,
  which are further trimmed and processed in ER to generate short (8-10 amino acids)
  peptides for loading onto MHC class I molecules. MHC-I/peptide complexes are transported
  to the cell surface for CD8+ T cell recognition. Exogenous proteins or peptides
  can also be processed and cross-presented for T cell recognition. (B) MHC class
  II α and β chains form a complex with the invariant chain (Ii) with a targeting
  sequence to MHC class II compartments (MIIC). The α/β/Ii complexes are transported
  to the MIIC, where Ii is processed and replaced with an antigenic peptide. Antigenic
  peptides can be generated from some endogenously expressed proteins with targeting
  sequence to the MIIC, or proteins targeted to autophagosomes through an autophagy-mediated
  pathway for protein degradation. Exogenous proteins are generally captured into
  early endosomes via endocytosis, and then further processed in the MIIC for loading
  onto MHC class II molecules. MHC-II/peptide complexes are finally transported to
  the cell surface and presented for recognition by CD4+ T cells.
