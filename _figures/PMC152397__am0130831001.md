caption: Illustration of the 2,4-D degradation pathway in R. eutropha JMP134, the
  archetype 2,4-D degrader (). The catabolic genes tfdA, tfdB, and tfdC were originally
  discovered in strain JMP134 and encode a 2,4-D/2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase, a chlorophenol
  hydroxylase, and a chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase, respectively (, ). Other tfd
  genes are involved in the further transformation to products of the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle ().
