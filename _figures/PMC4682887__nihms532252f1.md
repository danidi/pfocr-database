caption: Gc can interact with various immune cells to elicit innate inflammatory responses
  and suppress Th1/Th2-mediated specific immune responses. (A) Phagocytosis by macrophages
  results in activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes, the production of IL-1 and activation
  of PMNs, and activation of cathepsin B, which leads to pyronecrosis of APC []. (B)
  Interactions with DCs lead to up-regulation of PDL-1 and PDL-2, which induce apoptosis
  of cells bearing PD1. This up-regulation also causes release of IL-10 [], which
  has immunoregulatory properties and stimulates type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1).
  (C) Interaction with CD4+ T helper cells (or B cells) induces secretion of IL-10,
  TGF-β, and IL-6 [, ]. IL-10 and TGF- suppress the activation of Th1 and Th2 cells
  both directly, and through the activation of Tr1 cells. TGF-β and IL-6 drive the
  development of Th17 cells which secrete IL-17 and IL-22, leading to the recruitment
  or induction of innate defenses such as PMNs and anti-microbial peptides. Gc is
  able to resist destruction by PMNs and anti-microbial peptides while concomitantly
  suppressing the development of adaptive immune responses such as Gc-specific antibodies
  that could enhance phagocytosis and intracellular killing by phagocytes and bacteriolysis
  through the classical complement pathway []. Not shown is the expansion of IgD(+),CD27(+)
  B cells in response to gonococcal infection, which may contribute to a localized
  non-specific antibody response without immunologic memory in response to N. gonorrhoeae
  [], or Opa-mediated B cell suppression[] or killing [], which are discussed in the
  text.
