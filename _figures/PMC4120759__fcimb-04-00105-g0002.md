caption: A model describing the reciprocal relationship between GAS and infected host
  cell. Upon adherence, GAS delivers the SLO and SLS toxins to the host cell. These
  toxins induce ER stress causing UPR, which in turn is responsible for the elevated
  transcription of asns gene through the PERK-eIF2-ATF4 pathway. The enhanced activity
  of ASNS leads to release of ASN to the culture medium which is sensed by GAS, resulting
  in reduced transcription of both SLO and SLS. In addition, GAS utilizes the released
  ASN to enhance its rate of proliferation. Both effects of host ASN on GAS can be
  inhibited by the addition of bacterial ASNase a widely used chemotherapeutic agent.
