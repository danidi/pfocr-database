caption: Mode pattern illustrating the possible mechanisms underlying LRRK2-mediated
  neurotoxicity after TBI. Briefly, TBI induces a rapid increase in the expression
  of endogenous LRRK2, which can activate the p38 pathway. Phosphorylated p38 then
  translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and disrupts the stability of Drosha,
  promoting its nuclear export and degradation. As a nuclear RNase III enzyme, Drosha
  deficiency in the nucleus can hinder miRNA maturation, which eventually sensitizes
  cells to stress and results in neurological injury after TBI.
