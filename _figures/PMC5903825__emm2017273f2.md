caption: Hepcidin regulation in cancer tissue. Hepcidin in cancer tissue is produced
  by local tumor cells and liver. Hepcidin overexpression in tumor tissue is related
  to different bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) molecules (such as BMP7) as well as
  to inflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). Studies suggest the existence
  of new regulators of hepcidin in cancer tissue such as sclerostin domain-containing
  protein 1 (SOSTDC1) (which is downregulated in cancer through epigenetic silencing)
  and the Wnt pathway (which is upregulated in cancer). Increased hepcidin in the
  tumor milieu induces iron sequestration in tumor cells through its actions on ferroportin
  (FPN). Hepcidin increase is accompanied by tumor transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) upregulation,
  which increases iron supply into tumor cells. Increased iron depots in tumor cells
  help them survive and proliferate.
