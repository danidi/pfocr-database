caption: Model for avoidance of APOBEC-induced lesions ahead of lagging strand DNA
  synthesis. (A) Single stranded DNA in the lagging strand template contain cytidines
  susceptible for APOBEC-induced deamination. These dU are excised by Ung1 ahead of
  the replicative polymerase, generating a fork-stalling abasic site (denoted as AP).
  The majority of these lesions are bypassed in an error-free manner by template switching,
  which is dependent on Ubc13, Mms2, Rad5 and Mph1. Some abasic sites are bypassed
  via the error-prone TLS pathway, dependent on Rev1 and polymerase ζ. Here, Ubc13
  and Rad5 influence polymerase choice by promoting Rev1-mediated dC insertion, resulting
  in G to C substitutions. Alternatively, A-rule insertion by a different polymerase
  results in G to A substitutions. (B) Following end resection, cytidines on the non-resected
  DNA strand are exposed to APOBEC activity. These dU are excised by Ung1, generating
  abasic sites. During gap-fill synthesis, the polymerase stalls at the abasic sites.
  At this point, the lesion is predominantly bypassed through Mph1-dependent error-free
  template switch, potentially using its sister chromatid as a template or through
  error-prone TLS, dependent on Rev1 and polymerase ζ. As with (A), Ubc13 promotes
  Rev1 cytidine transferase activity during TLS, however, Ubc13-mediated polyubiquitination
  of PCNA is unnecessary for initiating error-free template switching.
