caption: 'Reactions of the proposed reductive pathway for 3-hydroxypropionate assimilation
  by Rhodobacter sphaeroides 2.4.1. Acrylyl-CoA reductase (AcuI) is encoded by RSP_1434
  (shown in the box). The reactions indicated by the dotted arrows are hypothetical;
  however, at least part of these reactions should exist, based on the fact that the
  overall conversion of 3-hydroxypropionate or acrylate to propionyl-CoA can be measured
  in cell extracts as described previously (). In the case of R. sphaeroides, propionyl-CoA
  is assimilated via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway and enters the citric acid cycle
  at succinyl-CoA. The methylmalonyl-CoA pathway consists of the following enzymes:
  propionyl-CoA carboxylase (alpha and beta subunits encoded by RSP_2191 and RSP_2189,
  respectively), ethylmalonyl-CoA/methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (encoded by RSP_0812),
  and (2R)-methylmalonyl–CoA mutase (encoded by RSP_2192).'
