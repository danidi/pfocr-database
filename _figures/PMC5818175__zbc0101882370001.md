caption: 'The bacterial PTS. a, diagram of the E. coli PTS. The first two steps are
  common to all branches of the pathway. Thereafter, the pathway splits into four
  sugar-specific classes: glucose, mannitol, mannose, and lactose/chitobiose. Blue,
  EI; pink, HPr; red, enzyme IIA; orange, enzyme IIB; yellow, enzyme IIC/enzyme IID.
  EIIC/EIID enzymes are shown in a lipid bilayer. The phosphorylated site is indicated
  by P. b, schematic summary of the conformational equilibria of EI during its catalytic
  cycle. The EIN domain is colored blue, the EIC domain is colored red, and PEP is
  colored green. Equilibrium constants reported in previous research articles (, )
  are shown. KDFree and KDBound are the equilibrium dissociation constants for dimerization
  in the absence and in the presence of saturating concentrations of Mg2+ and PEP,
  respectively.'
