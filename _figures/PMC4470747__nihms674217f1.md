caption: 'Viral protein antagonists of three cytosolic signaling pathways are represented
  here: 1) TLR3 activation leads to signaling through TRIF, TRAF6/Rip, and IKKα/β
  to turn on NFκB. 2) RIG-I activation requires binding to dsRNA and subsequent ubiquitination
  by E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM25 and Riplet. RIG-I is also independently activated
  by interactions with PACT. This signals through mitochondrial-bound MAVS, leading
  to TBK1/IKKε activation to initiate transcription factors NFκB, IRF3/IRF7. Additionally,
  PKR is activated by PACT or dsRNA binding, which also turns on TBK1/IKKε independently
  of RIG-I activation. 3) The RNAi pathway involves Dicer conversion of dsRNA to siRNA.
  The siRNA recognizes its complementary sequence in the target mRNA molecule, which
  recruits the RISC comprised of Argonaute 2, PACT and TRBP. The resulting mRNA is
  proteolytically degraded. Viral proteins that inhibit host signaling molecules are
  indicated. TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β; TRAF6, TNF
  receptor associated factor; RIP, Receptor-interacting protein.'
