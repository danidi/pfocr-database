caption: Modes of action of environmental risk factors for autism at excitatory synapses
  in the CNS. Scaffold proteins within the PSD such as proteins of the Shank family
  build a dense meshwork of interacting protein complexes including Homer, mGluR,
  AMPAR, and GKAP further connecting to PSD95 and NMDAR. These synaptic components
  are regulated via signaling cascades such as the p38 MAPK and ERK pathway and altogether
  ultimately determine the immediate and long-term response to a synaptic stimulus.
  Environmental factors that have been discussed in autism may influence this signaling
  outcome on various levels. Zn2+-deficiency for instance might be able to alter the
  PSD scaffold via Shank2 and Shank3 and additionally influences NMDAR, TrkB receptor,
  and GPR39 receptor signaling. Moreover, Zn2+ that might be released from presynaptic
  vesicles or postsynaptic metallothioneins can affect IGF1 signaling and gene expression
  via MTF1. Immune system abnormalities, including the expression of cytokines such
  as TNF-α, Il-1β, IL-18, and IL-6 will affect mGluR, p38 MPAK, and ERK signaling,
  pathways that are also activated by the receptors mentioned above.
