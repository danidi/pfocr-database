caption: 'a ∣ Structural features of representative RAF inhibitors bound to a BRAF
  dimer. The three structural types of RAF inhibitor bound to BRAF are shown as ribbon
  representations: Vemurafenib (VEM), a type I1/2 inhibitor (αC-OUT/DFG-IN), AZ628
  (AZ), a type II inhibitor (αC-IN/DFG-OUT), and SB590885 (SB), a type I inhibitor
  (αC-IN/DFG-IN). Vemurafenib and other type I1/2 inhibitors stabilize the αC-helix
  (red) of the first BRAF protomer to the OUT position and the αC-helix (green) of
  the second BRAF protomer to the IN position (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 3OG7).
  AZ628 and other type II inhibitors stabilize the αC-helix of the first BRAF protomer
  (red) and the αC-helix of the second BRAF protomer (green) to the IN position (PDB
  ID: 4RZW). SB590885 and other type I inhibitors stabilize both the αC-helix of the
  first BRAF protomer (red) and the αC-helix of the second BRAF protomer (green) to
  the IN position (PDB ID: 2FB8). AZ628 and other type II inhibitors induce the DFG
  motif to an OUT conformation, while other inhibitors of the type I and I1/2 groups
  maintain the DFG in an IN conformation. b ∣ Schematic showing the αC-OUT RAF inhibitor-induced
  paradoxical RAF pathway activation and negative allostery. Most αC-OUT RAF inhibitors
  stabilize the αC-helix (indicated by the red wavy line in the kinase domain) in
  the overall OUT position (1). However, the C-terminal αC-helix residue R506 is displaced
  into the IN position, which promotes the interaction of RAF with RAS-GTP (2). Subsequently,
  RAF is primed through phosphorylation and dimerization. RAF inhibitor binding to
  one protomer and stabilization of the αC-helix in the OUT position sterically prevents
  inhibitor binding to the second monomer (negative allostery), leading to paradoxical
  pathway activity (3). c ∣ Schematic showing αC-IN RAF inhibitor-induced RAF activation
  and effective dimer inhibition. By stabilizing the αC-helix in the IN position (1),
  αC-IN RAF inhibitors promote the formation of the RAF–RAS–GTP complex (2). This
  is followed by RAF phosphorylation and dimerization. Due to low negative allostery,
  RAF inhibitors belonging to this group effectively bind and inhibit both protomers
  in the RAF dimer (3). INH, inhibitor; NTD, N-terminal domain.'
