caption: 'Vascular inflammation, NK cell/monocyte crosstalk and angiotensin II in
  cardiac ischemic injury. In cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury and remodeling after
  MI, vascular inflammation plays a central role. Monocytes transmigrate into the
  infarcted zone and transdifferentiate into macrophages, that can exert various functions
  in remodeling depending on the microenvironment provided by cytokines (e.g., IL-12,
  IL-18, IFN-γ), chemokines (e.g., RANTES/CCL5, MCP-1/CCR2), integrins (e.g., VCAM-1,
  ICAM-1) and soluble lipid factors like resolvins, lipoxins, and maresins. Signaling
  through angiotensin II and its downstream hormone aldosterone plays a central mechanistic
  role in this process. It leads to deployment of AT1R+ monocytes from the spleen
  to the infarcted area, increases (in red) or attenuates (in blue) chemokine and
  cytokine expression from the endothelium and from leukocytes, fosters monocyte transmigration
  and -differentiation and supports a reciprocal program of activation between NK
  cells and monocytes. While parts of this crosstalk have been partially investigated
  in this setting (e.g., the T-bet/IFN-γ/IL-12 pathway), most aspects of mutual NK
  cell/monocyte activation are not known in the setting of vascular inflammation and
  cardiac ischemic injury. This includes interaction between CD40 and CD154 (Bellora
  et al., ), CD48 and 2B4 (Nedvetzki et al., ) and NKG2D and retinoic acid inducible-1
  (RAI-1) or members of the MHC class-I related chain (MIC) family of proteins, like
  MICA (Hamerman et al., ; Kloss et al., ). All of these are known to increase IFN-γ
  production by NK cells and CD69 expression on NK cells in infection or lipopoplysaccharide-driven
  models. Abbreviations: CD, cluster of differentiation; IL, interleukin; ATII, angiotensin
  II; AT1R, ATII receptor type 1; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor. Red letters: induced/activated
  by ATII/Aldosterone. Blue letters: attenuated by ATII/Aldosterone.'
