caption: A. Highly similar regions of the curacin and jamaicamaide biosynthetic pathways.
  The HCS cassette proteins (green), triple-ACP (purple), halogenase (yellow), enoylreductase
  (red) and flanking regions (blue, brown) are shown for CurA-CurF and the homologous
  region in JamE-JamJ, with sequence identities below. KS, ketosynthase; AT, acyl
  transferase; Hal, halogenase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; HCS, HMG-ACP synthase;
  ECH1 and ECH2, enoyl-CoA hydratases; and ER, enoyl reductase.B. Divergence in the
  biosynthetic pathways of curacin A and jamaicamaide A. In both pathways, CurA (or
  JamE) Hal chlorinates S-HMG-ACP, and CurE (or JamI) ECH1 dehydrates the chlorinated
  product. The Cur and Jam pathways diverge at the β-branching ECH2 step, where the
  CurF ECH2 forms an α-β double bond and the Jam ECH2 a β-γ double bond. The CurF
  ER then catalyzes cyclopropane ring formation. JamJ ER is unreactive towards the
  JamJ ECH2 product, however it reduces the CurF ECH2 product. CurK ER is a canonical
  PKS ER in the curacin A biosynthetic pathway, catalyzing reduction of an α-β double
  bond.C. Canonical ER reductase reaction. Hydride transfer from the cofactor NADPH
  to the β carbon of the unsaturated substrate is followed by protonation at the α
  carbon atom.D. CurF ER cyclopropanation. The unique CurF ER catalyzes the NADPH-dependent
  nucleophilic displacement of chloride to form the strained cyclopropane ring, presumably
  by a mechanism analogous to the canonical enoyl reduction ().
