caption: 'The miR390 directed pha-siRNA regulatory pathway is shown as indicated.
  The blue arrows and lines show the regulatory pathway of pha-siRNA s produced from
  TAS3c, while the dark orange arrows and lines show the regulatory pathway of cis-cleavage
  by pha-siRNA, siR406. The colors in the boxes from left to right represent the Z-score
  of expression values of sRNAs in the leaf, flower and boll, respectively. LRR: Leucine-rich
  repeat family protein; GMT: DP-mannose transporter; NBS: NBS-LRR disease resistance
  protein; Lipase: Lipase; GO: Glycolate oxidase; ERDF: Early-responsive to dehydration
  family protein; MYB: MYB transcription factor; HT: hexose transporter; ZF: Zinc
  finger family protein; DRP: DNA-directed RNA polymerase family protein; MADS: MADS-box
  transcription factor; PRP: Phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase-like protein;
  APF: Amino acid permease family protein; DEAD: DEAD-box ATP-dependent RNA helicase;
  LRK: LysM type receptor kinase; TL: Temperature-induced lipocalin; ARF: Auxin response
  factor; PH: Pleckstrin homology domain-containing family protein; SS: Spermidine
  synthase; ED: Elongation defective 1 family protein; MATE: MATE efflux family protein.'
