caption: The antiviral response in the nematode C. elegans is mediated by the RNAi
  machinery. The double stranded RNA intermediates produced during viral replication
  are first sequestered and retained by the RDE-1/4 dsRNA binding complex. The DExD
  box RNA helicase DRH-1later unwinds RNA molecules and facilitates their acquisition
  by the Dicer complex. Small viral RNAs generated by the Dicer homolog DCR-1 are
  amplified by RNA-directed RNA polymerases (RdRP) generating large numbers of anti-sense
  viral siRNAs that in turn trigger degradation of the target mRNA in a manner dependent
  on Argonaut proteins and the Rnase MUT-7. A similar pathway is used for the transcriptional
  silencing of transposons and repetitive DNA elements in the germline. In this pathway
  dsRNA species produced through intramolecular hybridization of repetitive sequence
  regions are sequestered, unwound, and delivered to DCR-1 by the DExD box RNA helicase
  MUT-14 which acts in a manner similar to DRH-1. RISC - RNA induced silencing complex.
