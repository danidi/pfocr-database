caption: In normal cells MST1 and LATS1 activated by extracellular signals like cell-cell
  contact phosphorylate YAP at S127, retaining YAP in cytoplasm for sequestration
  and degradation. This suppresses YAP targeted gene expression, allowing the cell
  to maintain homeostasis. In liver cancer cells adhesion of α2β1 integrin to extracellular
  collagen inhibits the kinase activity of MST1 and subsequently LATS1, of which the
  molecular mechanism involves the interaction between MST1 and S1180 of integrin
  α2. YAP is released from the negative regulation of the Hippo core kinases, and
  is transported into the nucleus to activate gene transcriptions for cell proliferation
  and survival, helping cancer cells overcome the cell-cell contact inhibition.
