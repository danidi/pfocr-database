caption: 'The relationship between the genes in each module from the GBM dataset.
  (Left) Nodes represent genes in seven modules found by NBM from GBM dataset. Genes
  with "(A)" appended are amplification mutations, genes with "(D)" appended are deletion
  mutations, and genes with no annotation are SNVs. Edges connect genes which appear
  in the same gene set. Color of nodes indicates membership in different signaling
  pathways as important for GBM: p53, RB and RTK/RAS/PI(3)K signaling pathways. (Right)
  Known interactions between genes in each driver pathway: inhibit, activate and interact.
  And p-value of each driver pathway is given from DAVID functional annotation tool
  whose website is http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp.'
