caption: 'Line widths are directly proportional to fluxes. Black lines denote intracellular
  fluxes, and gray lines denote anabolic fluxes contributing to biomass formation.
  Intracellular metabolites are shown as gray circles. The F6P and T3P pools appear
  twice (once each in glycolysis and PPP) to avoid excessive intersections of lines.
  The canonical pathways glycolysis, PPP, and TCA cycle are shown in italics, and
  the reaction sequence in which GK participates is shown in bold. Some reactions
  in the pathways are lumped; however the lumping retained the net carbon skeleton
  rearrangements of the reactions, and therefore did not affect the results. Since
  individual anaplerotic fluxes were not distinguishable, only the net anaplerotic
  flux (OaA/Mal → PEP/Pyr) is shown. Triglyceride intake flux, glycerol exchange flux,
  and acetyl CoA intake/lipogenesis are not shown for clarity. A list of all evaluated
  net fluxes is available in . Abbreviations: GK, glycerol kinase; PPP, pentose phosphate
  pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; Glc, glucose; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
