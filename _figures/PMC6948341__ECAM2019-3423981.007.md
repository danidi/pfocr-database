caption: Schematic diagram of the effect of the YQHX formula on the renal tubular
  cell damage induced by adenine. Adenine feeding induced a series of injury factors,
  including oxidative stress, inflammation response, cellular hypoxia, and DNA damage,
  which further caused cell apoptosis by eventually activating caspase-3 and induced
  cell fibrosis by initiating the TGF-β signaling pathway. TGF-β signaling contributes
  to the phenotypic conversion program of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  by gaining mesenchymal features (including α-smooth muscle actin, interstitial matrix
  components type I collagen, and fibronectin). The effective components of the YQHX
  formula ameliorated the cell apoptosis by upregulating the Bcl-2 expression and
  sequentially reducing the caspase-3 expression. Meanwhile, the YQHX formula activated
  the autophagy pathway by increasing the levels of Beclin-1, ATG-5, and LC3-II, thereby
  degrading the substrate p62, misfolded proteins, and injured cell organelles. Mature
  TGF-β induced by injury factors was reduced by the autophagy pathway.
