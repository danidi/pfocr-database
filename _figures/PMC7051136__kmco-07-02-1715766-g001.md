caption: CD36 is induced by HER2-targeted therapy and is required for HER2+ breast
  cancer cells to acquire resistance to HER2 inhibitors. In general, HER2+ breast
  cancer cells generate fatty acids (FAs) endogenously through FA synthase (FASN)
  and exogenously via CD36. HER2 activates FASN by phosphorylation and also by transcriptional
  induction (left). Inhibition of HER2 by lapatinib or trastuzumab results in suppression
  of FASN activity. To compensate for the suppression of de novo FA synthesis, the
  CD36-mediated pathway is activated as the major source of FAs acquisition (right).
  Whether CD36 is also able to compensate for the loss of kinase signaling (e.g.,
  activation of AKT and ERK kinases) remains to be elucidated (right).
