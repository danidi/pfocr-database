caption: Proteins are shown as colored shapes, LPS as a cluster of open circles, and
  dsRNA as intertwined black lines. Entities and interactions for which there is not
  consistent evidence of conservation between species are shown as dotted outlines
  in the species for which there is no evidence for their function.
