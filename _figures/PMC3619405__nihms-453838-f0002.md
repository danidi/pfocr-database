caption: 'Modeling spatially restricted biochemical reactions. (a) Epidermal growth
  factor (EGF) activates the canonical Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway on the plasma membrane through Grb2/Sos. In addition, EGF can trigger an
  elevation in intracellular Ca2+ through phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). The exchange factor
  RasGRP1 translocates to the Golgi after Ca2+ binding, activating Golgi-bound Ras.
  Intracellular Ca2+ also activates the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) CAPRI, which
  translocates to the plasma membrane and deactivates plasma-membrane-bound Ras. A
  key question in this system is whether Ras molecules on the plasma membrane and
  those on the Golgi are activated for different durations by the EGF receptor (EGFR).
  (b) To answer this question, we need to build a model that includes spatial specifications.
  Hence, we use a set of partial differential equations (PDEs). The first two equations
  in this figure describe the activation in the cytoplasm, diffusion and capture of
  RasGRP1 on the Golgi membrane. The first equation describes the rate of change of
  activated RasGRP1 with respect to time. The rate of change of activated RasGRP1
  has three components. The first term describes the diffusion of RasGRP in the cytoplasm,
  which is proportional to the second derivative of the concentration, (1/r)∂/∂r(r∂[Ca_RasGRP*]/∂r),
  multiplied by the diffusion coefficient DRasGRP*. The second and third terms describe
  the activation of RasGRP by binding of Ca2+ and deactivation by release of bound
  Ca2+. The parameters k1 and k2 are the rate constants for these processes. The second
  equation is called a boundary condition; in this case, it states that the flux of
  activated RasGRP1 to the Golgi membrane, 2πR∂[Ca_RasGRP*]/∂r, is equal to the rate
  of binding of RasGRP to Ras, konCa_[RasGRP*]|r=R, where the Golgi is defined as
  a circle with a radius (r) of R. The last equation states that the rate of change
  of RasGTP on the Golgi is equal to the rate of activation of Ras by RasGRP minus
  the rate of inactivation by a GAP. Note that, for clarity, the diffusion of RasGTP
  in the plane of the Golgi membrane is ignored. Similar equations and boundary conditions
  must be specified for the rest of the components. Analytical solutions are not guaranteed
  for many systems of PDEs, and PDE models are typically solved numerically. Abbreviation:
