caption: Proposed HG-induced signaling leading to membrane translocation of Rho GTPase
  protein and down-regulation of CDK inhibitor p21. The schema is derived from the
  data included in Figs. , , , and . The results in Fig.  indicate that the HG milieu
  leads to the activation and translocation of Ras and Rho GTPases. The data in Figs.  and  suggest
  that HG induces proliferation of MCs via inhibition of p21. The results given in
  Fig.  indicate that MCs transfected with dominant-negative RhoA (N19RhoA mutant)
  show a significant increase in P21, suggesting a relationship between RhoA and p21
  in HG-induced MC proliferation.
