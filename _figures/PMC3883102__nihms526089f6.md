caption: Schematic showing the three types of antibacterial targets present in the
  S. aureus WTA pathway. Enzymes that are traditional, β-lactam potentiators, or antivirulence
  antimicrobial targets are boxed. The three chemical structures illustrated are small
  molecules that are known to inhibit the WTA enzymes, TarO, TarG, and DltA.
