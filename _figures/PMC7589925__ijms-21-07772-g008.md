caption: 'Durum miRNA–mRNA modules involved in (a) carotenoid biosynthesis and (b)
  the phenylpropanoid pathway. Green boxes represent miRNAs, while blue boxes represent
  target genes. “↓” indicates that miRNA expression was lower in the stress-tolerant
  genotype DBA Aurora when compared with L6; “↑” indicates that miRNA expression was
  higher in the stress-tolerant genotype DBA Aurora when compared with L6. The four
  arrows represent the miRNA/gene expression pattern under control, water deficit
  stress, heat stress, and water deficit plus heat stress. “-” indicates that the
  gene expression pattern was not available due to no expression. For genotypic differences
  in target gene expression pattern under the four treatment conditions, see . Abbreviations:
  11-HSD1 (11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1); GGPP (geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  reductase); PYROXD2 (pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase domain-containing
  protein 2). For genotypic differences in miRNA and target gene expression patterns
  under four treatment conditions, also see .'
