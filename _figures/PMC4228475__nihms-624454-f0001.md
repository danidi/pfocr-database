caption: 'Diagram showing the essential components of the mosquito exo-siRNA pathway
  that is the major anti-viral immune response: long virus-specific dsRNA, which serves
  as the PAMP; Dicer 2 (Dicer), which serves as the PRR; R2D2, the dsRNA-binding protein;
  Argonaute 2 (Ago2), which acts as effector in cleaving target viral mRNA.'
