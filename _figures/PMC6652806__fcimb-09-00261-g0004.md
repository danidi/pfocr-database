caption: The Hog1 SAPK pathway in Cryptococcus neoformans. Both the signaling proteins
  that regulate Hog1 and the downstream responses are shown. The polymorphism in Ssk2
  that drives Hog1 activation in the absence of stress is indicated with a star. See
  text for details. Those proteins circled in red are required for C. neoformans virulence.
