caption: The hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase enzyme (HPRT) processes
  6-MP to thio-IMP, which is then converted to thio-XMP and thio-GMP. Subsequent metabolism
  of thio-GMP by kinases and reductases yields thio-dGTP which is incorporated into
  replicating DNA strands and triggers the DNA mismatch-repair machinery, leading
  to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The anti-leukemic effects of 6-MP are in part
  also attributed to a second metabolic pathway whereby thiopurine S-methyl transferase
  (TPMT) methylates thio-IMP to form methylthio-IMP (MeTIMP), which is a potent inhibitor
  of amidophosphoribosyltransferase (ATase), an enzyme catalyzing the committed step
  of de novo purine biosynthesis.
