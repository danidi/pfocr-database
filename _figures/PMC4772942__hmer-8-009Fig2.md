caption: 'Molecular signaling pathway involved in autophagy.Notes: Autophagy responses
  are sensed by AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and mTOR1. The phosphorylation of ULK
  complex can be initiated by AMPK activation due to low ATP:AMP ratio or mTOR inhibition
  due to nutrient starvation. Activation of ULK complex initiates series of reactions
  that lead to the engulfment of the cellular constituents in a double-membrane structure
  called autophagosome. The autophagosome then fuses with lysosome to form autophagolysosome
  in which the contents are digested by lysosomal enzymes into basic nutrients (sugars,
  lipids, amino acids, and nucleosides), which are released into the cytoplasm for
  subsequent use.Abbreviation: HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.'
