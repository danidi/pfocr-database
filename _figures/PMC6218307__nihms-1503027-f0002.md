caption: A. In resting macrophages, glucose and fatty acids are broken down to acetyl
  CoA that enters the TCA cycle. As the TCA cycle progresses, NADH and FADH2 are regenerated
  as electron donors for the ETC. Most electrons in the ETC are used to generate ATP
  although some leak off and combine with oxygen to create ROS. B. Activated M1 macrophages
  have modifications in their metabolism that drives their pro-inflammatory characteristics.
  () M1 macrophages downregulate isocitrate dehydrogenase, resulting in a block in
  the cycle moving forward from citrate. () Citrate accumulates. () The metabolic
  products of citrate are converted to itaconate by IRG1 (immune response gene 1 protein),
  which is markedly upregulated in M1 macrophages () In addition to direct antimicrobial
  effects, itaconate also inhibits complex II (also known as succinate dehydrogenase),
  preventing forward progression of the ETC. () Reverse transfer of electrons to complex
  1 results in increased ROS generation. () increased ROS results in stabilization
  of the transcription factor HIF-1a with subsequent upregulation of inflammatory
  gene expression, including the potent inflammatory cytokine IL-1 β. C. The metabolic
  signature of activated M2 macrophages is necessary for their function. () M2 macrophages
  have enhanced fatty acid oxidation driving the TCA cycle to generate ATP. () M2
  macrophages also require glycolysis, hydrolyzing glucose and using glutamine through
  the hexosamine pathway to generate uridine diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetylglucosamine
  (UDP- GIcNAc). This production of UDP-GIcNAc is necessary for () glycosolation of
  immune receptors and () the upregulation of expression of specific M2 markers.
