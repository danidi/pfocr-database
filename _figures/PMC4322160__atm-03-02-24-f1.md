caption: Image displaying signaling pathways triggered by binding of growth factors
  to tyrosine kinase receptor that triggers RAS, RAF, MAPK and ERK pathways leading
  to cell growth and proliferation. Mutations in BRAF (V600E) which can lead to accelerated
  cell growth and cancer formation of melanoma cells. Inhibition of mutant BRAF by
  Vemurafenib (red cross) in the melanoma cells shuts down the signaling pathway causing
  tumor regression following cell apoptosis, tumor antigen expression and decreased
  release of cytokines and VEGF. MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular-signal
  regulated kinase; EGF, vascular endothelial growth factor.
