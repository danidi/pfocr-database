caption: 'NMDAR receptor signalling can be triggered by glutamate released from the
  presynaptic neuron or through the NMDAR agonist quinolinic acid (QA), a product
  of tryptophan metabolic pathways in microglia. While glutamate signalling through
  synaptic NMDARs promotes neuronal survival, QA leads to excessive NMDAR activation
  and synaptic dysfunction. The levels of QA generation can be altered through inhibition
  of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, an enzyme in the tryptophan metabolic pathway. An
  imbalance in synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs is seen in both HD and AD. Htt and
  Tau are both involved in regulating the trafficking of NR2B to the extrasynaptic
  membrane. NR2B-containing NMDARs are hyperphosphorylated as mHtt and Tau increase
  recruitment of kinases to NR2B-containing NMDARs. An increase in both the levels
  and phosphorylation of NR2B-containing NMDARs leads to an increased extrasynaptic
  NMDA current that triggers cell death through multiple pathways. Two major pathways
  leading to cell death in HD and AD are represented: 1) inhibition of CREB phosphorylation
  that inhibits pro-survival pathways and 2) increases in Ca2+ influx, leading to
  mitochondrial dysfunction. Therapeutic targets are highlighted in red; Drugs are
  highlighted in green.'
