caption: 'Possible mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects of anthocyanins
  in NAFLD and NASH: a Srebp1c working model based on available studies. Anthocyanins
  may prevent the progression of liver damage related to NAFLD by three independent
  mechanisms: inhibition of lipogenesis by reducing Srebp1c, promotion of lipolysis
  by induction of PPARα activity, and reduction of oxidative stress by induction of
  anti-oxidant enzymes. The effects of anthocyanins on lipid metabolism seem to be
  dependent on the activation of the AMPK pathway in hepatocytes.'
