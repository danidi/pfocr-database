caption: The miRNA biogenesis and function. miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase
  II (Pol II) to form long primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs). pri-miRNA is processed by
  RNase III Drosha and DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8), yielding a hairpin-shaped
  miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) with the length of roughly 70 nucleotides. The pre-miRNA
  is exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm by Exportin 5/Ran-GTP (GTP binding
  RAN, member RAS oncogene family). In cytoplasm, pre-miRNA is further processed by
  Dicer1, an RNase III enzyme, resulting in an imperfect miRNA:miRNA* (the star strand)
  duplex. The mature miRNA forms miRNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC) together
  with Argonaute (Ago). Mature miRNA then guides miRISC to find its complementary
  binding sites, usually within the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNA, where
  additional proteins, such as trinucleotide repeat containing 6 (Tnrc6) and deadenylation
  complexes, are recruited. This eventually leads to translational repression or deadenylation
  and mRNA degradation. PABP1, poly (A)–binding protein 1; TARBP2, TAR (HIV transactivation
  response element) RNA binding protein 2.
