caption: 'Proposed consequences of impaired insulin signaling in AD brain and in the
  STZ-injected rat brain. Insulin signaling impairment first leads to decreased PI3K-AKT
  signaling activity via decreased IR activation, resulting in overactivation of GSK-3β.
  Over-activation of GSK-3β not only leads to hyperphosphorylation of tau directly,
  but also causes cognitive impairments via other pathways. Insulin resistance also
  leads to decreased GLUT1/3 expression and thus glucose uptake/metabolism in the
  brain. Decreased intraneuronal glucose metabolism results in decreased level of
  UDP-GlcNAc via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and, consequently, decreased
  tau O-GlcNAcylation. Because the latter regulates tau phosphorylation inversely,
  decreased O-GlcNAcylation could facilitate hyperphosphorylation of tau, which, in
  turn, forms toxic tau oligomers and eventually leads to neurofibrillary degeneration.
  In this figure, G on tau protein represents the O-GlcNAc group, and P represents
  the phosphate group. Alterations observed in the STZ-injected rat brains in the
  present study are highlighted yellow color. Abbreviations used in this figure: ADP,
  adenosine diphosphate; AKT, protein kinase B; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; F-6-P,
