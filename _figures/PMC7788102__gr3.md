caption: COVID-19 reduced B cell signature, specification, and lineage commitment
  gene abundance regardless of symptom severity. (A) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)
  “Antigen Presentation Pathway” showing MHC-I and II antigen presentation pathways
  with the addition of genes represented in the data set which are also 1) upstream
  regulators of CIITA (STAT 1–3, BCL6, IRF1, PML, RELB, and PAX5), 2) upstream regulators
  of PAX5 (LEF1 and ETS1) and 3) a downstream target of PAX5 (CD19). (B–H) Zoomed
  square in (A) to show detail. Overlaid are Log2 fold-change differential expression
  (DE) values when compared to HC for each covariate group. All groups showed increases
  in STAT1 and decreases in PAX5, and CD19. Yellow and blue fill denote significantly
  (FDR<0.01) increased or decreased fold-regulation over HC, respectively. (B) In
  addition to DE in all groups, group 1 (case 1 d4-6 (severe)) showed increases in
  MHC-I signaling components, HLA-A, TAP1/2. Despite increased upstream regulators
  (STAT 1–3, BCL6, IRF1, PML), CIITA was not increased. MHC-II receptors (HLA-DMA/B/OB/PB1/RA/RB1/RB3),
  CLIP (CD74), LET1, and ETS1showed decreased DE. (C) Group 2 (case 2 d6, 7 (mild))
  showed increased HLA-C, STAT1/2, and PML and decreases in HLA-DOB/RB. (D) Group
  X (Case 3 (d9-12 mild-moderate)) displayed decreased HLA-DRA abundance. (E) Group
  3 showed decreased HLA-C, and HLA-DOB/RB1. (F) Group 4 showed decreased CLIP (CD74),
  LEF1, HLA-C, and HLA-DMB/OB/PB1/RA/RB1/DRB3. (G) The latest clinical samples for
  case 2 (mild) d12, 13, and 18 (group 5) showed decreased HLA-C and HLA-DOB/RA/RB1.
  (H) The latest clinical samples for case 1 (severe) (group 6) showed decreased RELB,
  LEF1, HLA-C and HLA-DMB/OB/PA1/DPB1/RA/RB1. Greyed molecules are in the dataset
  but do not meet the cutoff of more than 2-fold regulated with an FDR<0.01.
