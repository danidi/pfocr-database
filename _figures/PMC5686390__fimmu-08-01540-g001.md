caption: Mechanisms of mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cell activation. (A)
  MAIT cells are activated by microbes that utilize a riboflavin biosynthetic pathway
  in an MR1-dependent manner. This activation can be enhanced when infected cells
  produce IL-12 and IL-18. (B) MAIT cells are activated by cytokines (IL-12 and IL-18)
  in an MR1-independent manner. These cytokines can be produced by inflammatory cells
  in non-infectious diseases (B1) or infected cells in viral disease (B2). (C) MAIT
  cells are activated by superantigen (SAg) in a T cell receptor (TCR)β-dependent
  manner (1) and/or cytokine-mediated (2 and 5) pathway, then upregulate inhibitory
  receptors such as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), and then are anergized (3)
  to subsequent bacterial challenge (4).
