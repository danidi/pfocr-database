caption: Genes involved in adipose tissue TLR‐ and insulin receptor signaling correlated
  with changes in plasma concentration of fetuin‐A and FFAs. (A) Genes involved in
  adipose tissue TLR‐signaling correlated with plasma fetuin‐A levels. (B) Genes involved
  in adipose tissue insulin receptor signaling correlated with plasma fetuin‐A levels.
  (C) Genes involved in adipose tissue TLR‐signaling correlated with plasma FFAs levels.
  (D) Genes involved in adipose tissue insulin receptor signaling correlated with
  plasma FFAs levels. (E) Genes involved in adipose tissue TLR‐signaling correlated
  with the interaction between plasma fetuin‐A and FFAs levels. (F) Genes involved
  in adipose tissue insulin receptor signaling correlated with the interaction between
  plasma fetuin‐A and FFAs levels. The relationship between gene expression and plasma
  concentration of fetuin‐A and FFAs was modeled using linear regression. The genes
  predicted by the model were overlapped with KEGG, Reactome, and Biocarta pathways
  related to TLR‐ and insulin receptor signaling using a hypergeometric distribution,
  to test if the overlap was larger than expected by chance. The statistics and more
  details regarding the pathway analyses are presented in the legend to Table  and
  the method section. Thinner lines indicate the strongest significance. “:” is the
  Wilkinson‐Rogers symbolic description of factorial models for analyses of variance
  indicating an interaction.
