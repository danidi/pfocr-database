caption: General representation of the biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanins, specifically
  pelargonidin (18), cyanidin (5), and delphinidin (19), modified from []. The intermediate
  compounds consist of naringenin chalcone (11), naringenin (7), dihydrokaempferol
  (12), dihydroquercetin (13), dihydromyricetin (14), leucopelargonidin (15), leucocyanidin
  (16), and leucodelphinidin (17). Catalysts are acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase),
  phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate:CoA
  ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), calcone isornerase (CHE), flavanone 3-hydroxylase
  (F3H), flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H), flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H), dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase
  (3-GT), anthocyanin acyltransferase (AAT), and anthocyanin rnalonyltranferase (MAT).
