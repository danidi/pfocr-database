caption: 'A brief summary of lipid metabolism signaling including fatty acid synthesis
  and components of the mevalonate pathway thought to be important in the pathogenesis
  of cancer. Activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) such as EGFR or HER2/neu
  through ligand binding, receptor overexpression, or activating mutations are thought
  to promote a variety of intracellular signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT. AKT activation
  in turn stimulates mTOR, resulting in SREBP processing and activation through blockade
  of LIPIN1. SREBP is a potent transcription factor that recognizes and binds to sterol
  regulatory elements (SRE) within the genome, inducing transcription of these target
  genes that include numerous factors involved in lipid metabolism and fatty acid
  uptake. Tumor cells also may increase lipid bioavailability through increased Free
  Fatty Acid (FFA) uptake via upregulation of fatty acid transport receptors and chaperones
  such as CD36, Solute Carrier Family 27/Fatty Acid Transporter (SLC27A/FATP), and
  Fatty Acid Binding Proteins (FABP). In addition, metabolic reprograming that facilitates
  glycolysis, a common phenomenon in tumorigenesis known as the Warburg effect, can
  activate de novo lipogenesis. Acetyl-CoA derived from citrate can be further processed
  into a variety of lipid species via the activity of various enzymes. Cholesterol
  and free fatty acids are important for a variety of cellular functions including
  membrane synthesis, inflammation, fatty acid β-oxidation, energy storage, cholesterol
  synthesis, protection from cellular stress, post-translational modification of proteins
  through prenylation, and cellular communication. Lipid metabolism enzymes that are
  current therapeutic targets of interest for the treatment of cancer are bold-faced.
  Enzymes are italicized. Abbreviations: ACL- ATP Citrate Lyase ; ACC- Acetyl-CoA
