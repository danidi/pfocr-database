caption: Role of p66SHC-dependent autophagy/mitophagy in B cells. In the presence
  of p66SHC, B cells undergo oxidative stress with insufficient ATP production and
  metabolic imbalance. The increased ADP/ATP ratio activates AMPK and enhances the
  autophagic flux. p66SHC impairs ATP production not only by modulating the AMPK pathway
  but also by dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS generation.
  The loss of mitochondrial integrity activates the PINK1-PRKN/PARKIN-mediated mitophagy
  pathway and increases the ubiquitination of OMM proteins, such as the Voltage-Dependent
  Anion Channel (VDAC) protein. The ubiquitinated proteins are recognized by the autophagic
  adaptor SQSTM1/p62 that mediates the recruitment of phagophore membranes through
  LC3 interaction. p66SHC is also able to interact with membrane-associated LC3 through
  an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif and form a complex with active AMPK. Although
  the mitochondrial pool of p66SHC is localized in the intermembrane space, ubiquitination
  of OMM proteins causes OMM rupture, making mitochondrial p66SHC accessible for interaction
  with LC3-II to promote phagophore membrane recruitment to damaged mitochondria.
  Hence, p66SHC impacts cellular metabolism and mitochondrial function in B cells
  acting as an LC3 receptor to recruit autophagosomal membranes to dysfunctional mitochondria
  primed to be removed via mitophagy.
