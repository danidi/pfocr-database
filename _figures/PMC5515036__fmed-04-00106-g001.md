caption: Biosynthetic pathway of cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) and cross regulation
  of their receptors. Arachidonic acid (AA) is released from the plasma membrane by
  a cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). To form cysLTs, 5-lipoxygenase-activating
  protein (FLAP) presents AA to 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) leading to the formation of
  leukotriene (LT) A4. LTA4 is rapidly metabolized either to produce LTB4 by the act
  of LTA4 hydrolase (LTA4-H) or to generate LTC4 by the action of LTC4 synthase (LTC4-S).
  LTC4 is further enzymatically transformed to LTD4 and LTE4. CysLT2R or GPR17 and
  PKC-dependent phosphorylation by P2Y receptors inhibit CysLT1R function. P2Y12 receptor
  (P2Y12R) was primarily identified as a LTE4 ligand, but other studies have suggested
  that LTE4 does not activate intracellular signaling by acting through P2Y12R. More
  recently, GPR99 has been suggested as a new receptor sensitive to LTE4.
