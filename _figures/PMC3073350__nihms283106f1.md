caption: 'a | Cytoskeletal actin microfilament dynamics are affected by the activation
  of six classes of plasma membrane receptor: receptor Tyr kinases (RTKs), G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs; with α-subunits of Gα12/13, Gαq/11 or Gαi/0), integrins as structural
  mediators of focal adhesions, transforming growth factor-β receptors (TGFβRs), E-cadherins
  at adherens junctions and Frizzled, which mediates the non-canonical Wnt–planar
  cell polarity (PCP) pathway involving Dishevelled (DVL). These receptors modulate
  the activity of Rho GTPases through Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs).
  Effectors of Rho GTPases, including Rho-associated kinases (ROCKs), formins (such
  as Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs)), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP),
  WASP-family verprolin homologues (WAVEs) and the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3)
  complex and other actin-binding proteins (ABPs), orchestrate actin polymerization
  by incorporating globular actin (G-actin) into the filamentous actin (F-actin) polymer.
  High levels of cytoplasmic G-actin retain serum response factor (SRF) cofactor proteins,
  myocardin-related transcription factors (MRTFs), in the cytoplasm. Incorporation
  of G-actin into the F-actin filament liberates MRTFs to enter the nucleus and interact
  with the transcription factor SRF. This triggers expression of a subset of SRF target
  genes, namely cytoskeletal genes. b | Activation of SRF class II target genes. Nuclear
  MRTF can be complexed by nuclear G-actin, which inhibits MRTF-mediated stimulation
  of SRF-dependent transcription and facilitates MRTF nuclear export. SRF class II
  target genes that are transcribed as a result of MRTF–SRF activation include actin
  itself and many genes that modulate actin dynamics, such as gelsolin and vinculin.
  These newly made proteins, with increasing time and concentration, might stimulate
  cytoplasmic actin polymerization, complex cytoplasmic MRTF or elevate levels of
  nuclear G-actin to downregulate MRTF-mediated transcription and stimulate nuclear
  export of MRTF. FAK, focal adhesion kinase; ILK, integrin-linked protein kinase;
  LIMK, LIM domain kinase.'
