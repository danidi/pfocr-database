caption: The molecular network of  is densely interconnected, implicating many possible
  interactions between the core molecular processes (interferon activation, M2 macrophage
  activation, adaptive immunity, ECM remodeling, and cell proliferation). Stepping
  back from the granular detail of single genes, we see a system of distinct parts
  through which SSc could be initiated and maintained. Among these are paths of particular
  interest. The interferon subnetwork and the M2 macrophage subnetwork are connected
  by RAC2. The M2 macrophage subnetwork in turn is connected to the ECM subnetwork
  through paths through CD14 and THY1. Suggesting macrophages may influence or drive
  ECM abnormalities in skin. The interferon subnetwork and the ECM subnetwork are
  connected through paths containing the pleiotropic and polymorphic gene PLAUR. The
  M2 macrophage subnetwork is connected to the adaptive immunity subnetwork through
  several distinct sets of paths through the genes GRB10, LCP2, and CXCR4. The ECM
  subnetwork is connected to the cell proliferation cluster through TGFβ pathway genes
  and paths containing the polymorphic genes IRAK1 and PXK, which suggests that ECM
  remodeling modulates cell proliferation through the TGFβ pathway. The interferon
  node may negatively regulate proliferation via the ERK/MAPK pathway resulting in
  the general mutual exclusivity of the inflammatory and fibroproliferative subsets.
  Thus we see a set of interconnected, balancing feedback loops that can enforce subset
  homeostasis, but also allow for patients to transition between the subsets, possibly
  in response to therapy.
