caption: 'Activation of IL-8 and cyclin D1: proposed POP mixture pathway shared by
  inflammation and cancer. Thick red and green arrows emphasize primary POP binding
  targets with inhibiting and activating effects, respectively. Yellow highlight indicates
  paths that needed an additional node (CREB1) to further converge on the same downstream
  targets via the PXR, whereas the AR and the AHR directly connected to the common
  downstream targets. AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; PXR, pregnane X receptor. Symbols
  defined by MetaCore™ by Thomson Reuters http://lsresearch.thomsonreuters.com/static/uploads/files/2014-05/MetaCoreQuickReferenceGuide.pdf:
  green arrows, activating interactions; red arrows, inhibiting interactions; POPs
  (TCDD, PCB 153 and p,p´-DDE), purple hexagons, transcription factors, red symbols;
  cyclin D1, blue symbol; IL-8, green symbol.'
