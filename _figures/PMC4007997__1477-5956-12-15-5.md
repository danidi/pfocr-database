caption: Upstream regulator analysis of membrane protein changes in differently regulated
  proteins involved in cell-to-cell signaling and interaction. Transforming growth
  factor beta 1 and the transcriptional factor Slug were identified with significant
  predicted activation score respectively of −2,20 and −2,22. Symbols are indicated
  in the predicted legend.

  of liver stem/hepatocyte allows to candidate the inhibition of TGF-beta pathway
  as causal to differentiation.
