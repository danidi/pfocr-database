caption: Canonical, Noncanonical, and Endoglin/ALK-1 signaling pathways. Both Canonical
  and Endoglin/ALK-1 TGF-Beta signaling is mediated by the phosphorylation of distinct
  receptor Smad proteins. Nuclear translocation requires Co-Smad binding in both pathways.
  Inside the nucleus, R- and Co-Smads form a complex with transcription factors to
  either repress or activate TGF-Beta related gene expression. The noncanonical pathway
  is mediated by TGFBRI, TRAF6, and TAK1 and results in the phosphorylation of MAPKs
  such as Erk1/2, JNK, and p38. These MAPKs can re-enter the Smad-dependent pathway
  through phosphorylation or mediate downstream signaling through other Smad-independent
  pathways. The lightning bolts represent mutations to the indicated proteins causative
  of the syndromes listed in red.
