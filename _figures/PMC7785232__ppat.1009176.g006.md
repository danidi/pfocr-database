caption: The host type 2 immune response is elicited to clear parasitic helminth infections;
  however, the co-evolution of these parasites has promoted a variety of mechanisms
  to oppose and redirect immune responses by manipulating immune cell programming
  and function. Integrating our results with the current knowledge, we propose that
  gastrointestinal (1) helminths infections can enhance the regulatory axis of TAM
  receptors (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) in peripheral blood (2) CD11bhigh and CD1chigh
  cells, and their ligand GAS6 in CD4+ T cells of patients with MS. This negative
  regulatory pathway could be essential for dampening co-stimulatory signals (CD40,
  CD80, and CD86) of antigen-presenting cells and controlling the pathological Th17
  (pTh17) response at secondary lymphoid organs (3). The active chronic infection
  resets T helper response toward Th2/regulatory signals, limiting pathological Th17
  (pTh17) effector response. This reprogramming of CD4+ T cells and GAS6 signaling
  under a helminth-induced type 2 environment could be essential for maintaining the
  balance between CD4+ IL-10+ and Th17 cells and reducing inflammatory IL-17 and IFNγ
  signals in the central nervous system (4). In summary, GAS6 tempers not only the
  innate immune response but also regulates Th17 development in an autocrine/paracrine
  manner.
