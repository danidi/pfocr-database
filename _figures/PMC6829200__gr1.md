caption: 'Overview of the components and regulatory factors in the complement alternative
  pathway (CAP). Alternative pathway dysregulation in complement (C)3G is characterized
  by inappropriate and excessive C3 consumption, C3 fragment production, and the subsequent
  deposition in the glomerular basement membrane and mesangium, causing glomerular
  injury. Dysregulation can stem from overactivity of CAP promoters (green) or loss
  of function/inhibition of CAP regulators (red). Complement factor H (CFH) is a major
  negative regulator of CAP via limitation of the amplification of C3b. CFH-related
  protein 5 (FHR5) has several actions that together activate the CAP: FHR5 competes
  with CFH for ligand binding to C3b, thereby antagonizing the ability of factor H
  to limit the amplification of C3b (a process called factor H deregulation). FHR5
  also binds extracellular matrix components to support the assembly of the alternative
  pathway C3 convertase. CFI, complement factor I; FB, factor B; FD, factor D; FHR-1,
  complement factor H–related protein 1; FHR-2, complement factor H–related protein
  2; MAC, membrane attack complex.'
