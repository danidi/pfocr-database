caption: Imbalances in ROS and redox cycles lead to contrasting outcomes in normal
  and cancer cells. (A) ROS are intracellularly produced by NADPH oxidases and dual
  oxidases (NOX/DUOX) through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and in peroxisomes.
  Their interconversion (orange circle) occurs through enzyme catalyzed and non-catalyzed
  reactions. For instance, metal-catalyzed Fenton reactions produce HO• from  and
  H2O2. Under low ROS levels, these oxidants control important signaling reactions,
  activating transcription factors, regulating pathways and controlling cell growth
  and differentiation. Under high ROS levels, oxidation of lipids, nucleic acids,
  and proteins is toxic and may disturb pathways and lead to cell death. (B) Normal
  and cancer cells present important differences in their responses to oxidative stress.
  Under normal conditions, ROS production is low and antioxidant defenses are sufficient
  to prevent toxic damage. Under oxidative stress, the promoted production of ROS
  overcomes the cell's capacity for detoxification and results in increased toxic
  damage and pathway disruption, which may lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, mutagenesis
  and ultimately apoptosis. In turn, cancer cells are under constant oxidative stress,
  which through upregulation of antioxidant defenses, prevents apoptosis while maintaining
  ROS toxicity. Arrows indicate fluxes, increasing from dashed to continuous, in red.
