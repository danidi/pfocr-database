caption: Model of IGF2 effects on colonic epithelia. (A) With normal, monoallelic
  expression of IGF2, the IGF1R receptor acts to stimulate growth and inhibits apoptosis
  (through CARD11) and differentiation (through GSK3p). This is coupled to the Wnt
  pathway, as they both inhibit GSK3p. (B) In the case of LOI of Igf2, the biallelic
  expression of Igf2 leads to more IGF1R expression, as well as a reinforcement of
  the growth pathway while inhibiting the differentiation and apoptotic pathways.
  (C) However, when an inhibitor of IGF1R action is applied, these pathways are curtailed,
  leading to an increase in apoptotic pathways and reestablishment of the differentiation
  equilibrium.
