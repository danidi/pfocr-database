caption: Schematic model of the signaling networks involving auxin, H2, CO and NO
  during adventitious rooting. H2 triggers a transient NO and or CO accumulation.
  In turn, NO and CO induces adventitious root development. The above pathway might
  be mediated by the expression of CsDNAJ-1, CDPK1/5, CsC6 and AUX22B/D genes and
  the activity of POD, PPO and IAAO. T bars, inhibition.
