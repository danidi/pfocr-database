caption: Schematic representation of the ectoenzymes and transporters involved in
  the extracellular ATP metabolism. Extracellular pyrophosphate (PPi) is the major
  endogenous inhibitor of ectopic calcification, that is degraded by tissue non-specific
  alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) and produced during extracellular hydrolysis of adenosine-5’-triphosphate
  (ATP), via ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phos-phodiesterase 1 (eNPP1). A direct
  competitor of the substrate for eNPP1 is the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase
  (CD39) that hydrolyze ATP or ADP releasing inorganic phosphate (Pi) and adenosine-5’-diphosphate
  (ADP) or adenosine-5’-monophosphate (AMP) respectively. The last step in the degradation
  of extracellular ATP is the membrane-bound ecto-5`nucletotidase (CD73) that preferentially
  binds AMP and converts it to adenosine (Ado) and Pi. To generate ATP by mitochondria
  or another metabolic pathway, Ado and Pi are recovered from the extracellular space
  by equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and sodium-phosphate transporter
  (NPT), respectively. To close the cycle of extracellular ATP metabolism, ATP is
  released by cells via exocytotic mechanisms and via multiple types of membrane channels,
  including connexin hemichannels (Cx), pannexin (Panx), cystic fibrosis transmembrane
  conductance regulator (CFTR), and the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR). (*) Indicates
  the ectoenzymes and transporters involved in extracellular ATP metabolism that induce
  ectopic calcification by loss of its function.
