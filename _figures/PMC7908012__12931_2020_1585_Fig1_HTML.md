caption: Differences in the anatomy of the pharynx and larynx of an adult (left) and
  an infant (right) and their effect on the pathway of aerosol particles (represented
  by pink dots). Premature infants receive nebulization while lying in a cot or in
  an incubator (upper panel) whereas nebulization is normally administered to adults
  with the patient in a seated or erect position (lower panel). Thus, the anatomical
  differences between adult and neonate are compared for a lying down position in
  Fig. 1. This graphic highlights the main differences that make the pathway of aerosol
  particles more curvy in premature infants, potentially reducing the effective delivery
  of nebulized substance to the lungs.
