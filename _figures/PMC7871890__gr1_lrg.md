caption: Type I and III interferons response following SARS-CoV-2 sensing during controlled
  (left and central cell) and uncontrolled (right cell) infection. Schematic representing
  the canonical pathway of pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) sensing of intracellular
  pathogens. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) -such as viral RNA- are
  recognized by pathogen recognition receptors –PRRs- (RIG-1, MDA5, and LGP2) lead
  to activation and phosphorylation of IRF3/7 and IRF1, their nuclear traslocation,
  and drive the expression of both types I and III interferons. Both interferons are
  translated and secreted from the infected cell in an autocrine or paracrine manner.
  Upon engagement of IFN-I to the IFNAR and of IFN-III to the IFNLR receptor, signal
  transductions start, leading to the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG).
  These opposite scenarios compare the IFN-I/III optimal response controlling SARS-CoV-2
  infection (left and central cell), and the counteracted and/or deficient IFN-I/III
  response (right cell) associated with high virus replication, immune-mediated complications
  (including down-regulation of ISGs, together with exacerbated NF-κB activation),
  and lung immunopathology (“cytokine storm”, accumulation of monocytes, vascular
  damage, and abnormal T cell response).
