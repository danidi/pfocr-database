caption: Structural equation modeling for mediation effect. Dependent variable Ki-67
  is predicted with single-headed EGFR and p-AKT. Each single-headed arrow represents
  a regression weights. Age and gender are considered to be associated with all the
  three biomarkers and are also allowed to be correlated and represented with double-headed
  arrow. Circles of e1, e2 and d1 are error terms with mean at 0 and variance at 1.
