number: Figure 6
caption: Cell wall biosynthetic modules occur multiple times in plants. A, Contents
  of new gene pages in PlaNet. B, Arabidopsis gene modules similar to the primary
  cell wall module centered around At1g41830 (large node). Green edges indicate similarity
  strength between modules as the number of shared label co-occurrences. The figure
  was generated by right clicking on the network and selecting Toggle similarity within
  one species and setting the label co-occurrence cutoff to 10. Boxes indicate modules
  that are displayed in detail below. C, Contents of the analysis of modules page.
  D, Coexpression networks of selected cell wall-related modules. Nodes and edges
  represent genes and coexpression relationships between genes, respectively. Colored
  shapes of the nodes depict label co-occurrences found in the four networks, as seen
  in the legend at right. Large nodes represent genes serving as module centers. Expression
  profiles of module center genes were estimated from expression profiles generated
  by FamNet and are depicted by heat maps to the left of each module.
