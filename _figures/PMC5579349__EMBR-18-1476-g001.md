caption: (A) The E3 ubiquitin ligases ARIH1, LRSAM1, and HOIP cooperate to mediate
  ubiquitination (K48‐, K6‐/K27‐, and M1‐linked, respectively) of cytosolic Salmonella
  and restrict bacterial replication. (B) In the absence of ARIH1, LRSAM and HOIP
  mediate ubiquitination (K6‐/K27‐ and M1‐linked, respectively) of cytosolic Salmonella.
  HOIP‐mediated linear ubiquitination is increased, and the NF‐κB signaling pathway
  is activated. In this case, bacterial replication is not restricted. (C) In the
  absence of both ARIH1 and LRSAM1, HOIP‐mediated linear ubiquitination is increased
  and the NF‐κB signaling pathway is activated. In this case, bacterial replication
  is not restricted.
