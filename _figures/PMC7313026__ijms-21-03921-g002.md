caption: 'RNF186, RNF182, and RNF152 are involved in the regulation of the mTORC1
  pathway. RNF186 regulates positively by degrading Sestrin-2 ubiquitylated with K48-linked
  chain, whereas RNF182 and RNF152 are native regulators. RNF152 involves two pathways:
  the K63-linked ubiquitylation of RagA and the mono ubiquitylation of Rheb. The ubiquitylated
  RagA and Rheb enhance the binding performance with GATOR1 and TSC, respectively.
  Phosphorylated USP4, which is identified as a DUB for Rheb, deubiquitylates the
  ubiquitylated Rheb and cancels the negative regulation by mono ubiquitylation. USP4
  is phosphorylated by the EGF-Akt pathway. Shh-dependent FoxA2-transcriptional activity
  induces RNF152 expression. The expression of RNF182 is induced by ischemia-reperfusion
  injury; however, the mechanism of mTORC1 suppression by RNF182 remains unknown.
  The arrows indicate activation, and the T-bars indicate inhibition. The red arrows
  indicate the effects of ubiquitylation by RNF186 or RNF152. The red characters indicate
  the types of ubiquitylation by RNF186 or RNF152. The dotted arrow indicates that
  the detailed mechanism is unknown.'
