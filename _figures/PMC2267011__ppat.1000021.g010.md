caption: EBs bind to and activate PDGFRβ, possibly via heparan sulfate and/or PDGF.
  Abl kinase is recruited to and activated at the site of EB binding in a PDGFRβ-independent
  manner and phosphorylates TARP. The combined activation of PDGFRβ and Abl kinase
  leads to phosphorylation and activation of Vav2, WAVE2, and Cortactin. Rac and Arp
  2/3 are recruited to the site of entry, possibly through interaction with TARP or
  via PDGFRβ and/or Abl kinase signaling. Actin polymerization is stimulated through
  the WAVE2/Arp2/3 pathway, Cortactin/Arp2/3 pathway, and/or directly by TARP. Other
  receptors and pathways converge and/or synergize with these molecules to ensure
  efficient Rac and Arp2/3 activation for C. trachomatis uptake.
