caption: (A) The FARP2/R-Ras/talin pathway. When plexins are inactive, the Rac GEF
  FARP2 is bound to a KRK motif on their cytoplasmic region. After semaphorin binding,
  FARP2 is released from plexins and transiently activates Rac1. In turn, Rac1 activates
  plexins allowing the interaction with Rnd1. Rnd1 recruits R-Ras which is inhibited
  by the GAP activity of plexins. Also, free FARP2 binds and sequesters PIPKI (PIP
  Kinase Isoform) which is required in the final step of integrin activation by talin
  binding. These mechanisms result in a lack of integrin activation and stabilization
  in focal points. Note that this mechanism is thought to be common to all types of
  plexins. Thus neuropilin participation might be variable (not represented). (B)
  The Fes/CRMP2 pathway. When stimulated by a class-3 semaphorin, A-plexin interacting
  kinases Fes and Fyn phosphorylate CDK5, which subsequently phosphorylates CRMP2.
  CRMP2 priming phosphorylation enables an additional phosphorylation of CRMP2 by
  GSK3β. This results in the inability of CRMP2 to interact with tubulin and to promote
  microtubules assembly, suggesting a role in cell migration.
