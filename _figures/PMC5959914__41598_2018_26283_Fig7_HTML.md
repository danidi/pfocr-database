caption: Summarized pathway of C4 photosynthetic metabolism in dynamic response to
  recovery from sudden heat shock (SHS) in two maize lines grown under different CO2
  levels. Three C4 key photosynthetic enzyme were indicated in red color. In terms
  of each inserted panel, red and green lines represent recovery profiling of metabolites
  in B76 and B106, respectively, while solid and dotted line represent elevated and
  ambient CO2, respectively. The key metabolites identified by feature extraction
  approach that can greatly explain the photosynthetic rates in response to recovery
  from SHS were highlighted in bold fonts.
