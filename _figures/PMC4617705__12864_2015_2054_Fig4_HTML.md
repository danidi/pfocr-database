caption: Effects of CsA on the expression of genes involved in endoplasmic reticulum
  stress and FXR-regulated pathways in WT-PCLS and FXRKO-PCLS. Pathway analysis was
  performed in MetaCore using as input significant genes (FDR ≤ 0.05) regulated by
  CsA in WT-PCLS and FXRKO-PCLS. Pathways were considered as significant if FDR ≤0.005.
  Among the most significantly regulated pathways were “Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  stress response pathway” (a) and “Bile acids regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism
  via FXR “(b). Blue and red bars indicate down-and up-regulation respectively of
  significantly affected genes. Numbers 1 and 2 below the bars indicate WT-PCLS and
  FXRKO-PCLS, respectively. Each bar represents average fold change of gene expression
  (treatment vs. control) in liver slices from five mice. For an explanation of the
  other MetaCore symbols is referred to http://pathwaymaps.com/pdf/MC_legend.pdf

papertitle: Cyclosporin A induced toxicity in mouse liver slices is only slightly
  aggravated by Fxr-deficiency and co-occurs with upregulation of pro-inflammatory
  genes and downregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial functions.
