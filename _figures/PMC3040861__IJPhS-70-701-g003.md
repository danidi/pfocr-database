caption: Biosynthesis of lovastatin The lovastatin biosynthetic pathway starts from
  acetate units linked to each other in head- to-tail fashion to form two polyketide
  chains. Monacolin L is first produced from acetate and methionine and then hydroxylated
  to monacolin J by a monooxygenase. Monacolin J is further converted to monacolin
  X by an esterification reaction, followed by transformation into the end-product
  lovastatin.
