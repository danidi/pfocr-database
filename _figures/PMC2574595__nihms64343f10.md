caption: 'Zymosan activates TLR2 and perhaps another unidentified subclass of the
  TLR receptors. TLR2 activation stimulates cytosolic PKC via several additional steps
  (not shown). PKC phosphorylates regulatory cytosolic subunit p47phox (see NOX2 box
  on the right). Phosphorylation of p47phox prompts assembly of the enzymatically
  active NOX2 complex, which includes membrane proteins NOX2 (gp91phox) and p22phox,
  as well as cytosolic p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase rac. An active
  NOX2 complex resides in plasmalemmal and phagocytic membranes and produces O2−,
  which is released to the extracellular space or into phagosome. An alternative signaling
  pathway causes activation of NOX4 via unidentified enzymatic steps. NOX4 is likely
  localized in endoplasmic reticulum and/or endosomes and does not require cytosolic
  regulatory subunits for its activity (see NOX4 box on the right). NOX4 produces
  predominantly H2O2, rather than O2−. The difference in the location of the ROS production
  and/or the nature of generated ROS likely determines differential contribution of
  NOX4 and NOX2 to the activation of VRAC by zymosan. Abbreviations: ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; ES-SOD, extracellular superoxide dismutase; NOX, NAD(P)H oxidase, PKC,
  protein kinase C, TLR, Toll-like receptors. See text for additional details.'
