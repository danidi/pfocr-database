caption: Schematic diagram of the signalling pathways in vascular endothelial cells
  that contribute to the beneficial effects of oligonol on hyperglycaemia-induced
  eNOS dysfunction. BK activates eNOS by phosphorylation of Ser-1177 via the PI3-K/Akt
  pathway and by dephosphorylation of Thr-495 possibly due to the Ca2+/calmodulin
  (CaM)-dependent pathway. Hyperglycaemia reduces BK-stimulated phosphorylation of
  eNOS at Ser-1177 by inhibiting the PI3-K/Akt pathway. Oligonol reverses activation
  of the PI3-K/Akt pathway leading to the improved phosphorylation level of eNOS at
  Ser-1177. Hyperglycaemia also generates ROS with inactivation of SOD. ROS are upstream
  signalling molecules to PKCε which is involved in the hyperglycaemia-induced blockade
  of dephosphorylation of eNOS at Thr-495. Oligonol upregulates SOD and counteracts
  the action of PKCε. BK, bradykinin; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; PKC,
  protein kinase C; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
