caption: (A), In a two-state view of GPCR activity, where the receptor displays only
  a single active state, the decision of which G protein to couple to or whether to
  choose a G protein-independent pathway via arrestin binding must be determined by
  the number of receptor molecules that achieve the active state (i.e., strength of
  signal). (B), In a conformational substate view, since a single receptor can adopt
  several different active conformational substates (depicted by different colored
  receptors), the decision of which G protein to couple to or whether to choose a
  G protein-independent pathway via arrestin binding can be determined by which conformational
  substate is attained.
