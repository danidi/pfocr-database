caption: Chronic THC exposure during adolescence is associated with persistent behavioral
  disorders in adulthood including social interaction/cognition deficits, cognitive
  filtering disturbances, memory deficits and anxiety. These behavioral disorders
  were accompanied by alterations in signaling pathway and synaptic plasticity markers
  and hyperDAergic activity in the mesocorticolimbic pathway, resembling schizophrenia.
