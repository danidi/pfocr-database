caption: 'A fraction (2-5%) of the glucose entering a cell is directed into the hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway (HBP) pathway. GFAT (glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase)
  uses glutamine to convert fructose-6-phosphate into glucosamine-6-phosphate, which
  is then used for the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc in the cell. Activation of the HBP
  pathway acts through Sp1 sites to increase plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)
  and tumor growth factor-alpha expressions. At the same time, O-GlcNAc modification
  of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) decreases its activity and nitric oxide
  (NO) production.'
