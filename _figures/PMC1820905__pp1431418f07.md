caption: Model of cytokinin regulation by the shoot branching network. Similar models
  are presented by  and , and reviewed by  and . New data presented here are incorporated
  in this model together with the findings of . 1, Synthesis of a mobile branching
  inhibitor (SMS) in the rootstock and shoot is dependent on RMS1/MAX4 and RMS5/MAX3.
  2, SMS perception/transduction is dependent on RMS4/MAX2; phenotypic grafting evidence
  shows that this F-box protein acts predominantly in the shoot and is required for
  SMS action. 3, Outputs of the RMS4/MAX2 signal transduction pathway include separate
  inhibition of bud outgrowth and repression of RMS2; suppression of bud formation
  or branching does not prevent activation of the feedback signal (). 4, RMS2 affects
  long-distance feedback and exhibits graft-transmissible action (). 5, The long-distance
  feedback signal activates SMS synthesis in shoot and roots; RMS1 and RMS5 expression
  is minimal in rms2 mutants. 6, The feedback signal also represses xylem cytokinin
  from the roots; all rms mutants except rms2 have low xylem cytokinin. 7, It is possible
  that X-CK directly stimulates bud outgrowth (). 8, Shoot cytokinin stimulates bud
  outgrowth; direct addition of cytokinin to buds generally causes increased growth.
  9, Decapitation activates IPT and enhances local shoot cytokinin content. 10, Decapitation
  also reduces SMS by suppressing RMS1 and RMS5 gene expression and increases X-CK
  independently of RMS2 action (). 11, Total shoot cytokinin levels in intact plants
  are maintained by an unknown homeostatic system ( and ). Solid arrows are interpretations
  based on direct evidence; broken arrows are tentative or poorly understood relationships.
