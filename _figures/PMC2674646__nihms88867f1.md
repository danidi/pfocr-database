caption: Different modes of ADAM modulation of the Notch pathway. A, Ligand binding
  induces Notch cleavage by an ADAM protease at the S2 site, followed by γ-secretase
  cleavage at the S3/S4 site and release of the NICD from the membrane in a signal-receiving
  cell. B, Ligand shedding by an ADAM in a signal-sending cell down-regulates Notch
  signaling in a signal-receiving cell. C, Ligand shedding by an ADAM relieves cis-inhibition
  of Notch and makes Notch available for interactions with ligands in trans. D, After
  ADAM cleavage, the transmembrane fragment of the ligand is processed by γ-secretase,
  and the intracellular domain released from the membrane may act as a signaling molecule.
