caption: Stem-Cell-Triggered Immunity. Schematic diagram showing shoot apical meristem
  (A) protective and regulatory networks, driven by auxin and cytokinins (CKs). WUS
  and CLV3p mediated regulation play a pivotal role in maintaining a balance between
  proliferation and differentiation. CLV3p is perceived by the CLV-receptor complex
  and leads to maintenance of stem cell (left). There is an independent pathway where
  CLV3 also binds to FLS2 and activates innate immunity (right). This is analogous
  to typical bacterial flagellin perception mechanism, where flg22-FLS2 interaction
  triggers innate immunity in the leaf tissue (B) against infection with bacterial
  pathogens such as Pst DC3000 (C).
