caption: The pathway of arginine catabolism in urea and nitric oxide cycles. Arginine
  is a substrate for both nitric oxide synthases (NOS), yielding Nitric oxide (NO)
  and L-citrulline, and for arginase, to produce ornithine and urea. The urea cycle,
  also known as the ornithine cycle, consists of a series of reactions distributed
  between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytosol, responsible for the conversion
  of excess nitrogen into urea. NO is gaseous signaling molecule, which is formed
  from arginine by NOS. NOS = nitric oxide synthase; NO = nitric oxide; ATP = adenosine
  triphosphate.
