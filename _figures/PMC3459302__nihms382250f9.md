caption: The astrocytes in the brain metabolize PA to generate ceramides through the
  de novo ceramide synthesis pathway by SPT, which initiates the release of soluble
  molecules, i.e. TNFα and IL-1β, from the astrocytes. In turn, these soluble molecules
  activate the SMase-ceramide pathway in the neurons to increase ceramide levels.
  Upregulated ceramide increase BACE1 level and enhance Aβ production (; ). The increased
  extracellular Aβ level may act on both the astrocytes and the neurons to enhance
  the intracellular ceramide levels. This ceramide-Aβ-ceramide cascade creates a continuing
  cycle to further induce cell death (; ).
