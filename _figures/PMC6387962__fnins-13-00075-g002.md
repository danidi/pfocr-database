caption: In Friedreich ataxia patients, deposits of iron in NS have not been clearly
  reported and it remains a controversial topic, while some evidences point to a relocation
  of iron from neurons to glial cells. So far there are some hypotheses that explain
  the possible mechanisms of iron toxicity that lead to cellular dysfunction. The
  ROS-dependent hypothesis proposes the iron-mediated catalysis of ROS by Fenton reaction.
  Besides the impairment in ISC synthesis due to frataxin deficiency, the radical
  species can in turn damage the ISC of proteins generating new free iron that will
  participate in the Fenton reaction. Contributing to this cycle is the observation
  that the Nrf2 signaling is defective in some cells and models of the disease. Another
  recent hypothesis, independent of ROS production, was explored in Drosophila and
  mouse models. It suggests that the cellular dysfunction can be due to the activation
  of the PDK1/Mef2 (3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1/myocyte enhancer
  factor-2) pathway by means of an increase in sphingolipids synthesis. Both hypothesis
  as well as the relevance of ROS in the pathology of FRDA have partial support, since
  the evidence pointing to them vary depending on the study.
