caption: The reduced model encompasses all seven drug targets (yellow) and the two
  phenotypic outputs (red for Antisurvival and green for Prosurvival). In addition
  the ERK node (blue) had to be preserved to maintain dynamical consistency with the
  large model. Activating regulations are denoted by green arrows, while red T arrows
  denote inhibition. The blue arc with both arrow and T head (p38alpha to Antisurvival)
  indicates a dual regulation, i.e. activating and inhibiting, depending on context.
  In some contexts p38alpha inhibition will increase Antisurvival, while in others
  p38alpha inhibition will decrease Antisurvival (see ,  and  Tables). Note that after
  model reduction two members of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, β-catenin and GSK3, became
  non-regulated and fixed at either the on-state (β-catenin) or off-state (GSK3).
