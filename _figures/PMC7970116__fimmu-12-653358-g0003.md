caption: Genomic characteristics of ccRCC for manipulating the TIME. (A) VHL mutations
  result in reduced pVHL production and reduced HIF-1α/2α degradation. Excess HIF-1α/2α
  upregulates the expression of PD-L1 on MDSC, M2-like TAMs, and DCs by binding to
  the hypoxia response element (HRE). HIF-1α promotes MDSCs to produce iNOS and Arg-1
  and to differentiate into M2-like TAMs. HIF-1α promotes the recruitment of Tregs,
  and mediates the inhibitory effect of M2-like TAMs on the effector function of CD8+
  TILs. (B) PBRM1 mutation leads to PBAF complex dysfunction, which upregulates interferon-stimulated
  gene (ISG) expression, thereby enhancing the tumor killing effect mediated by IFN-γ
  signaling. PBAF inactivation also promotes the secretion of CXCL9 and CXCL10 by
  tumor cells. BAP1 mutations are associated with the immuno-exhausted tumor microenvironment.
  SETD2 mutations are associated with the immune-silenced tumor microenvironment.
  (C) PTEN mutations activate the P13K-Akt pathway, resulting in upregulation of VEGF,
  CCL2, and IL-23 expression, which contribute to the recruitment of Tregs, DCs, and
  MDSCs. (D) Frameshift INDELs and HERV expression can generate abundant neoantigens,
  which stimulate the production of neoantigen-specific T cells. Arm level SCNA can
  disrupt the antigen-presenting capacity of MHC on tumor cells, resulting in inactivation
  of tumor-specific immune responses.
