caption: Proposal for the AdpA-mediated regulation of Lcm and the landomycin A biosynthetic
  pathways in S. cyanogenus. Both biosynthetic pathways compete for PKS precursor
  supply. AdpA, presumably through direct binding to the lcmRIII promoter region,
  activates the expression of this lcm cluster-situated transcriptional regulator.
  Both LcmRII and LcmRIII are positive regulators of Lcm production. The role of LcmRI
  in the regulation of the Lcm biosynthesis is unclear and awaits further investigations.
