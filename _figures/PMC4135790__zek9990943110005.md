caption: 'Metabolic pathways leading to VOC production in Aspergillus fumigatus: lipid
  peroxidation products and pyrazines. Bold numbers in parentheses correspond to the
  entries in  and the GC peaks shown in . (A) Enzymatic or nonenzymatic oxidative
  breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids (here, linoleic acid) leads to volatile degradation
  products. A fungus-specific pathway leads to 1-octen-3-ol, whereas 2-pentylfuran
  is produced by plants and nonenzymatic oxidative lipid breakdown. (B) A. fumigatus
  produces several compounds containing pyrazine/piperazine heterocycles that may
  be the origin for the VOCs identified as pyrazines.'
