caption: Circadian oscillation in leptin signaling pathway in mouse brown fat. This
  is a fragment of the KEGG pathway with superimposed plots of circadian expression
  profiles for the essential components of the pathway. Every gene involved in leptin
  signaling demonstrates explicit circadian pattern in baseline oscillation. All except
  one oscillate in the same phase. Leptin itself is actively expressed in brown adipose
  tissue and its intensity oscillates with a phase shift, slightly behind leptin receptor
  (LEPR) and other components of leptin signaling. Remarkably, suppressor of cytokine
  signal (SOCS3) has two alternative transcripts oscillating in counter-phase.
