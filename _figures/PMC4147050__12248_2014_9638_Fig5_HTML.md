caption: 'Conditionally bispecific intoxication of cells by engineered anthrax toxin
  targeted at two ECM proteases: uPA and MMP. Shown is the implementation as reported
  by Phillips et al. (). (1) Anthrax protective antigen (PA) recognizes the two receptors
  ANTXR1 and ANTXR2. Wildtype PA undergoes proteolytic cleavage by furin to a 63-kDa
  truncated form (PA63) that self-associates in the receptor-bound state. Two variants
  of protective antigen (PA) were engineered to redirect wildtype PA’s specificity
  for furin to uPA (2) and MMP (3). (4) Oligomeric PA63 (pre-pore) binds lethal factor
  (LF) or engineered fusions of its N-terminal domain (LF N) with a cargo effector.
  (5) The complex is internalized into endosomes. (6) Acidification within the endosomes
  triggers a transition of the pre-pore to a pore that translocates LF or the LFN-based
  fusion into the cytosol. Wildtype LF leads to cell death by activating the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase (MAP2K) pathway. An alternative cytotoxin is a LFN conjugate
  with Pseudomonas exotoxin A (FP59) that induces apoptosis through inhibition of
  protein synthesis ()'
