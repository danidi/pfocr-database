caption: Model of the mechanism by which zebrafish PGE2 negatively regulates E-cadherin
  via a Snai1a-dependent mechanism. Following EP4 receptor engagement by PGE2, the
  Gβγ subunits bind Gsk3β, preventing it from inhibiting Snai1a by phosphorylation.
  Ubiquitylation of Snail is decreased, stabilizing Snai1a protein. Snai1a can then
  transcriptionally repress E-cadherin, altering the cell adhesion of signaling cells.
  Blue arrows, pathway mechanism following PGE2signaling activation.
