caption: 'The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade in the
  regulation of brain development[].Typically, ERK1/2 activation occurs downstream
  from the binding of a ligand (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor) to a tyrosine
  kinase receptor (e.g., TrkB), leading to receptor autophosphorylation. Subsequently,
  the Shc domain binds to phosphorylated TrkB and recruits the Grb2-Sos complex to
  activate the G-protein Ras. Ras activates Raf to phosphorylate MEK1/2. Activated
  MEK1/2 phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2, which subsequently activates multiple
  target proteins in the cell cytosol and nucleus by phosphorylation. Several of these
  proteins are involved in the regulation of cellular events central to brain development,
  including proliferation, differentiation, cell survival, and synaptic plasticity.MEK:
  Mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase; TrkB: tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B.'
