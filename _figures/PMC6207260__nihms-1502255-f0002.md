caption: 'In addition to increases in genomic instability that are associated with
  increases in DNA damage, an inadequate DNA damage response (DDR) and telomere dysfunction,
  dysregulation of signaling pathways, including the growth factor signaling pathway,
  klotho, and the nutrient sensing pathways, mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR),
  adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK), and sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1) will induce
  increases in cellular senescence and the dysregulation of autophagy that contribute
  to increased tissue oxidative stress and inflammation that ultimately result in
  the age-related arterial phenotype characterized by endothelial dysfunction and
  arterial stiffening. (Illustration Credit: Ben Smith).'
