  pathway, OONO- can be produced and attenuate the sensitivity of sGC, making the
  malfunctioning of VSMC vasodilation. NF-κB pathway is an important upstream mechanism
  of the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. ROS could also enhance MMP expression
  and activate RhoA/pMLC pathway through PTK or PI3K/Akt signaling and consequentially
  relocate or degrade TJs and AJs, resulting to high paracellular permeability of
