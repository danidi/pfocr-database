caption: A. In the presence of a sub-threshold mechanical signal, as seen in normal
  lung, TRPV4 does not influence the LPS/TLR4 signal, which results in limiting the
  phagocytic response to LPS, thereby maintaining lung homeostasis. B. In the presence
  of an above threshold mechanical signal, as seen with lung stiffening during injury,
  TRPV4 influences the LPS/TLR4 signal. We have previously published that TRPV4 regulates
  the stiffness-dependent responses of increased macrophage phagocytosis, and cytokine
  secretion in response to LPS (). We now show a molecular switch from JNK activation
  to predominantly p38 activation, which results in abrogation of enhanced DUSP1 expression.
  DUSP1 regulates the MAPK molecular switch by deactivating JNK resulting in enhanced
  bacterial clearance, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, and thereby
  ameliorating lung injury/ARDS. This defines a novel molecular mechanism linking
  inflammation-induced changes in the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix
  with innate immunity.
