caption: The prosurvival pathway converges on the mPTP. GSK3β is a negative regulator
  of the mPTP, and its activity is inhibited by phosphorylation by AKT and PKCs. GSK3β
  functions as a hub for different survival signals at the interface with mPTP. In
  addition, PKCε can stabilize the interaction with HKII by phosphorylating VDAC.
