caption: The HOG and CWI pathways. CWI signalling pathway is initiated at the plasma
  membrane through different sensing mechanisms and is activated by Pkc1 upon different
  cell wall stresses. The linear cascade consists in the Bck1 MAPKKK, which activates
  a pair of redundant MAPKK (Mkk1 and Mkk2) that in turn activates the Mpk1/Stl2 MAPK.
  In the HOG pathway, two independent upstream osmosensing mechanisms lead to the
  activation of the MAPKKK Ste11 and Ssk2/22. The Pbs2 MAPKK integrates both signals
  and activates the Hog1 MAPK. Both the HOG and CWI pathways are involved in the regulation
  of transcriptional elongation by specific types of stimuli to induce specific adaptive
  response.
