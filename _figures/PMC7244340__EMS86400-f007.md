caption: Primary metabolic pathways are shown in blue (fructose model is in cyan),
  cellular phenotypes are in gray, and the CtBP-p53 pathway in shown in orange. Solid
  lines show metabolic reactions, whereas dashed lines show regulatory relationships.
  Regeneration of NAD+ from GAPDH-generated NADH by the mitochondrial electron transport
  chain is reduced by decreased O2 concentrations and increased by ATP generation
  through glycolysis. The ability of LDH to regenerate NAD+ is linked to rates of
  lactate export, which are inhibited by high tumor lactate concentrations. Oncogenic
  mutations drive both cell proliferation and increased rates of glycolysis for the
  synthesis of anabolic metabolites. The biochemical limitation of glycolysis due
  to an increased NADH:NAD+ ratio may lead to an imbalance between metabolic demand
  and supply, resulting in cellular damage. Sensing of this ratio by CtBPs, and the
  subsequent regulation of p53, matches metabolic demand with supply and reduces cellular
  damage. In the absence of functional p53, cells continue to proliferate in adverse
  microenvironments despite metabolic imbalances, and surviving cells acquire further
  mutations resulting in tumor progression.
