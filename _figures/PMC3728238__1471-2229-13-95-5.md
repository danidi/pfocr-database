caption: Schematic representation of the metabolic pathway involved in cuticular wax
  biosynthesis. A significant effect over the two growing seasons was observed for
  genes in red. For genes in blue, a significant effect was found only in 2008, and
  genes in black displayed very little variation of expression.
