caption: Summary of the effects of leptin in the hypothalamus of control (A) and ob/ob
  mice (B), as revealed by Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MEMRI) and
  13C High-Resolution-Magic Angle Spinning (HR-MAS). In the Arcuate nucleus of control
  animals, leptin (gray triangles, red arrow up) binds to the leptin receptors (inverted
  Y) inhibiting (negative red circles) the orexigenic Agouti-related peptide/Neuropeptide
  Y (AgRP/NPY) neurons and stimulating (positive red circles) the anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin/cocaine-
  and amphetamine-regulated transcript (POMC/CART) neurons. In the genetically obese,
  leptin-null ob/ob mice (red arrow down), the physiological inhibition of the AgRP/NPY
  neurons in the Arcuate and downstream Paraventricular (PVN) connections is almost
  fully released (positive red circles), resulting in augmented neuronal oxidative
  capacity (darker TCAn), enhanced glutamatergic neurotransmission and neuroglial
  glutamate/glutamine cycling (darker transcellular arrows) without appreciable effects
  in the astrocytic oxidative capacity (TCAg). Together, these changes lead to relative
  increases in MEMRI signal intensities in the Arcuate (MEMRI red circles +) and 13C
  labelling from [1-13C]glucose in glutamate/glutamine in AgRP/NPY neurons and downstream
  paraventicular (PVN) connections and melanocortin (MC) pathway, resulting in an
  uncompensated orexigenic response and obesity. A, Astrocyte; ARC, Arcuate; GLU,
  glutamate; MC4, MC3, melanocortin receptors; N, neuron; TCA, tricarboxylic acid
  cycle; PVN, Paraventricular.
