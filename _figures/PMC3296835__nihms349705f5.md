caption: Model of the Sema3A-activated signaling pathway that triggers adhesion site
  disassembly. Via currently unknown steps (1) the Sema3A receptor (NP-1, neuropilin-1)
  activates GIVA PLA2. The released AA (2) is converted primarily to 12(S)-HETE by
  12/15-LO (3), which selectively activates PKCε (4). PKCε phosphorylation of adhesion-associated
  MARCKS (5) triggers its dissociation from the plasma membrane (6) and adhesion site
  disassembly, which causes growth cone detachment (7). If this response is localized
  it results in growth cone repulsion; if it is generalized, it triggers growth cone
  collapse. Steps that are known to be necessary and/or sufficient are indicated.
  This model is supported by the data presented here and by previous publications
  (see Discussion).
