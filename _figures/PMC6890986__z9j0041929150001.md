caption: 'Overview of apoptosis and necrosis pathways. Both apoptosis and necrosis
  can be mediated through pathways that involve death receptors or mitochondria, resulting
  in four distinct pathways: 1) death receptor-mediated apoptosis, 2) death receptor-mediated
  necrosis (necroptosis), 3) mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, and 4) mitochondrial-mediated
  necrosis. Regardless of upstream signaling, apoptosis in both pathways leads to
  activation of the cysteine-dependent proteases, called caspases. In death receptor-mediated
  apoptosis, binding of death ligands to their cognate receptors results in the formation
  of sequential protein complexes (complexes I and II). In the latter, caspase-8 (or
  -10, not shown) is activated. These caspases then cleave and activate downstream
  caspases, such as -3 and -7. In mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, caspases are activated
  in a cytosolic complex (not shown) whose formation is triggered by cytochrome c.
  Cytochrome c gains access to the cytosol following permeabilization of the outer
  mitochondrial membrane, which is mediated by B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2)-associated
  X protein (BAX) and BCL-2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK). In contrast to caspases in
  apoptosis, a single unifying mechanism has not yet been identified for downstream
  necrosis signaling that is common to both death receptor and mitochondrial pathways.
  In necroptosis, activation of the serine/threonine kinases receptor interacting
  protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3 is critical. RIPK3 then phosphorylates and activates
  a pseudokinase called mixed lineage kinase-like domain (MLKL), which oligomerizes
  and permeabilizes the plasma membrane to induce necroptosis. The critical event
  in the induction of mitochondrial necrosis is Ca2+-triggered opening of the mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore (mPTP) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This opening
  causes rapid dissipation of the proton gradient across the inner membrane that drives
  ATP synthesis leading to energetic deficits. However, the precise mechanism leading
  to plasma membrane dysfunction in this pathway is unclear (see text).'
