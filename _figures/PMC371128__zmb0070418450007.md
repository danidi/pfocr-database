caption: Model for the role of Mdt1 during normal cell cycles (grey lines) and in
  response to DNA damage (black lines). Mdt1 phosphorylation on T305 contributes to
  normal mitosis in unperturbed cell cycles, in a pathway parallel to that of Cdc5.
  Phosphorylated T305 also functions as a scaffold to link Mdt1 to the checkpoint
  machinery via the interaction of Mdt1 with the Rad53 FHA1 domain pThr-binding site.
  In response to DNA damage, Mdt1 is phosphorylated on multiple residues in a Mec1/Tel1-dependent
  manner, inhibiting its promitotic function. Together with checkpoint-dependent inactivation
  of parallel pathways, for example, Rad53-dependent phosphorylation of Cdc5, this
  event leads to G2/M delays while DNA damage persists.
