caption: 'Figure 1. Pathways of serine biosynthesis in plants and simplified scheme
  showing the main metabolites synthesized from serine. The metabolic link between
  plastidial glycolytic GAPCp and the Phosphorylated Pathway is also illustrated.
  The enzymes participating in each pathway are as follows. Photorespiratory pathway
  (Glycolate pathway): GDC, glycine decarboxylase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase.
  Glycerate pathway: PGAP, 3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase; GDH, glycerate dehydrogenase;
  AH-AT, alanine-hydroxypyruvate aminotransferase. Phosphorylated pathway: PGDH, 3-phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase; PSAT, 3-phosphoserine aminotransferase; PSP, 3-phosphoserine phosphatase.
  Plastidial glycolysis: GAPCp, plastidial glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  PGKp, plastidial phosphoglycerate kinase. Broken lines indicate several enzymatic
  reactions. Abbreviations used for metabolites: THF, tetrahydrofolate. 5,10-CH2-THF,
  5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate. 3-PGA, 3-phosphoglycerate. 3-PHP, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate.
  3-PS, 3-phosphoserine; GAP, glyceraldehyde phosphate; 1,3BisPGA, 1,3 Bisphosphoglycerate.'
