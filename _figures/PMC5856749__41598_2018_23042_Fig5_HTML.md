caption: NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response –signaling in the nucleus. Significant
  canonical pathways associated with differentially expressed genes in response to
  12 hours of mechanical stretch in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes are shown. Up-
  and down-regulated genes are displayed in red and green, respectively. The intensity
  of the color indicates the degree of up-regulation or downregulation. Genes are
  represented as various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene product.
  Full annotations for genes and molecules in this canonical pathway and whole figure
  of this canonical pathway are provided in Supplementary Datafile 1and Fig. , respectively.
