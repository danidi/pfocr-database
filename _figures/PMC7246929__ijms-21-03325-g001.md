caption: Extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. (a,b) Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
  receptor superfamily member 6/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing (Fas/TRAIL)
  mediated apoptotic pathway leads to the formation of Complex I/death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC) which consists of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD),
  procaspase 8/10 and cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1β-converting enzyme) inhibitory
  proteins (cFLIP). (c) Binding of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) to TNF-α receptor
  1 (TNFR1) receptor causes the formation of Complex I (TNFR1-associated protein with
  death domain (TRADD), TNFR1, TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TNFα-related
  receptor interacting protein (RIP), which in the next stage either activates the
  nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway or
  transforms into Complex II (TRADD, TNFR1, TRAF2, RIP, FADD, procaspase-8, procaspase-10).
