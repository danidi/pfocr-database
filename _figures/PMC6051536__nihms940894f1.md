caption: Stress-induced loss of glia leads to excess extracellular glutamate, as glia
  normally remove glutamate from the synapse after an action potential. Glutamate
  then binds to presynaptic mGluRs that inhibit further synaptic glutamate release,
  which would normally promote strengthening of synapses by binding postsynaptic AMPA
  receptors (AMPARs). Glutamate binding to extrasynaptic NMDARs leads to phosphorylation
  of eEF2, which inhibits synthesis of BDNF, a key promoter of synaptic growth. Stress
  also leads to induction of REDD1, which inhibits the mTORC1 pathway. mTORC1 promotes
  the translation of synaptic proteins necessary for new dendrite formation. Each
  of these pathways contributes to the loss of synapses and dendritic spines seen
  in depression.
