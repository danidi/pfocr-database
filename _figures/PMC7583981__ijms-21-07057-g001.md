caption: Pyroptosis canonical pathway and non-canonical pathway. Working as the molecular
  switch of pyroptosis, inflammasomes consist of a sensor PRRs, an adaptor ASC, and
  an effector pro-caspase-1. During pyroptosis canonical pathway, DAMPs and PAMPs
  are identified by PRRs, promoting the combination of PRR’s PYD with ASC, thus recruiting
  pro-caspase-1 and priming complete inflammasome. Activated inflammasome triggers
  caspase-1 and cleaves GSDMD into GSDMD-NT, which inserts into cell membrane and
  resulting pore formation, accompanied by the secretion of IL-1β, IL-18. Whereas
  in non-canonical pathway, it’s caspase-4/5/8/11 that are activated by intracellular
  LPS or toxins, leading to the same cascaded reactions. PRRs, pattern recognition
  receptors; ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein; DAMPs, damage-associated
  molecular patterns; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns; GSDMD, gasderminD;
  LPS, lipopolysaccharides; LRR, leucine rich repeat; PYD, pyrin domain; NACTH, NACTH
