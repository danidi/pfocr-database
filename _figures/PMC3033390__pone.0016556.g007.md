caption: BBR inhibits mitochondria function and decrease intracellular ATP. This leads
  to a reduction in gluconeogenic and lipogenic transcription factors (FoxO1, SREBP1,
  and ChREBP). As a result, expression of gluconeogenic genes (PEPCK and G6Pase) and
  lipogenic gene (FAS) are decreased. These molecular changes represent a signaling
  pathway for improvement of fasting glucose and liver steatosis in the BBR-treated
  diabetic rats.
