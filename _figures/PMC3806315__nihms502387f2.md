caption: 'The folate cycle and the methionine comprise of two metabolic pathways that
  exist independently and thus in modules.The folate cycle: Folate is imported in
  cells and reduced to tetrahydrofolate (THF). THF is converted to 5,10-methylene-THF
  (me-THF) by serine hydroxymethyl transferase (SHMT). Vitamin B6 appears to have
  an influence on this reaction but the interaction is likely indirect. This product
  is then either reduced to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (mTHF) by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR) or converted to 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate (F-THF) through a sequence
  of steps. mTHF is demethylated to complete the folate cycle. With the demethylation
  of mTHF, the carbon is donated into the methionine cycle through the methylation
  of homocysteine by methionine synthase and its cofactor Vitamin B12.The methionine
  cycle: The methionine cycle begins with homocysteine that accepts the carbon from
  the folate pool through mTHF to generate methionine. Methionine, through methionine
  adenyltransferase (MAT) is used to generate S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is
  demethylated to form S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). After deadenylation by S-adenosyl
  homocysteine hydrolase (SAHH), SAH is converted back to homocysteine resulting in
  a full turn of the methionine cycle.Another modular unit of one carbon metabolism
  is the transsulfuration pathway. This pathway is connected to the methionine cycle
  through the intermediate homocysteine. Serine can condense enzymatically with homocysteine
  to generate cystathione by cystathionine synthase (CBS). Cystathionine is then cleaved
  by cystathione lyase (CGL) to generate alpha-ketobutyrate (αKB) and cysteine, which
  can be shunted into glutathione production and taurine metabolism. The metabolism
  of cysteine can also lead to its desulfhydration and production of hydrogen sulfide
  through CBS and CGL.Abbreviations: SAM – S-adenosylmethionine, SAH – S-adenosylhomomocysteine,
  hCYS – homocysteine, THF – Tetrahydrofolate, mTHF – 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, Me-THF
