caption: Formation and release of malicious exosomes. Exosomes are formed in the endosomal
  pathway. Early exosomes’ maturation occurs while they migrate from the cell periphery
  towards the nucleus by the formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILV) in a process
  mediated by endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) and auxiliary
  proteins (left image) []. Late endosomes, or multivesicular bodies (MVB), migrate
  to the periphery and ultimately will fuse with the membrane releasing the intraluminal
  vesicles (ILVs), which are then called exosomes. The migration process of the endosomes
  is mediated by different proteins belonging to the Rab GTPases family.
