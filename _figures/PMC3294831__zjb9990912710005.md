caption: 'Metabolic scenario for Glc-6P partitioning in S. coelicolor, with emphasis
  on the involvement of ADP-Glc PPase, UDP-Glc PPase, and GSase activities and the
  differential regulation of the first enzyme. Green (with color degree directly proportional
  to stronger effect) and red boxes mark metabolites behaving as allosteric activators
  and inhibitors, respectively, of ADP-Glc PPase. Wide gray arrows symbolize metabolic
  fluxes involving several reactions. Abbreviations: EMPP, Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  pathway; OPPP, oxidative pentose-P pathway, ManB, P-mannose mutase; Pgm, P-glucomutase;
  Gmpp, GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase; Pgi, P-glucose isomerase.'
