caption: The synthesis began with a straightforward sequence that produced 56 from
  44 (), in turn available from glucose in 3 steps. Material 56 was then elaborated
  to vinyl ether 61 (), which underwent Claisen rearrangement to furnish 62. A series
  of transformations then led to 66. The latter underwent stereoselective (7:1) epoxidation
  of the vinyl ether, enabling the creation of the correct configuration of α-benzoyloxy
  ketone 67. The subsequent hydration of the ethynyl segment was complicated by loss
  of the TBS group and consequent formation of hemiketal 68. Fortunately, 68 smoothly
  progressed to 69 () upon enol silylation of the methyl ketone (TBSOTf/iPr2NEt) and
  protection of the primary OH group (TBSCl/imidazole). The crucial aldol-dehydration
  step was performed in two stages. Reaction of 69 with TBAF induced selective release
  of the enol silyl ether and consequent aldol addition of the transient enolate to
  the highly electrophilic α,α′-dioxygenated ketone. Dehydration of the resultant
  aldol with Cl3CCOCl in pyridine delivered 70. The installation of the nitrogen functionality
  followed a somewhat circuitous pathway. This was dictated by the instability of
  the bis-allylic alcohol produced upon reduction of 70 and its protected variants.
  After much experimenation, it transpired that BOM-protected compound 71 is amenable
  to conversion into 73, which, in principle, could undergo an Overman imidate rearrangement
  as a means to introduce the requisite nitrogen substituent. Unfortunately, all attempts
  in that sense met with failure. Consequently, 73 was advanced to carbamate 75, which
  smoothly cyclized under basic conditions to furnish 76. The subsequent conversion
  of 76 into 79 proceeded uneventfully.
