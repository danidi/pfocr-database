caption: 'Regulation of the C-type lectin receptor signalling pathway by curdlan and
  MacroGard®. DEG datasets were manually mapped on the pathway-map dre04625. The original
  reference pathway is indicated by white boxes, the organism-specific pathway is
  indicated by green boxes, confirming the presence of these genes in the zebrafish
  genome. Genes regulated after stimulation of carp macrophages with curdlan are indicated
  by red boxes, with MacroGard® by blue boxes, and by both curdlan and MacroGard®
  by orange boxes. The symbol O represents chemical compounds, DNA or other molecules.
  Black solid lines represent known molecular interaction or relation (▸: activating,
  |: inhibiting), dotted lines represent indirect links or unknown reactions, where
  +p, –p, +u, and –u represent phosphorylation, dephosphorylation, ubiquitination,
  and deubiquitination, respectively. Lines interrupted by e refer to gene expression
  interactions specifically.'
