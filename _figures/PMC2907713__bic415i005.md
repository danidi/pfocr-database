caption: Several major signalling pathways are modulated by changes in PQQ dietary
  status. Given the broad range of responses, PQQ is proposed to bind to a cell surface
  receptor that triggers responses from one or more transducers. The JAK/STAT3 pathway
  is highlighted, because STAT3 is up-regulated and influences the expression of a
  variety of genes that play key roles in cellular processes such as cell proliferation,
  differentiation and apoptosis. The link to AMPK is based in part on the down-regulation
  of NPY. Cross-talk between Raf-1 and STAT3 is inferred (broken arrow), because of
  the known inter-relationships between MAPK/ERK signalling and STAT3, and the up-regulation
  of c-Fos, Raf-1 and Ras following exposure to either dietary or pharmacological
  levels of PQQ. The MAPK p58 family (e.g., MAPKKK12 and MAPK14) is also involved.
  The combination of the two cell signalling pathways can lead to the up-regulation
  or activation of PGC-1α, PPARα (peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor α) and
  CREB as end products.
