caption: Schematic representation of NAE metabolic pathway in plants. The NAE metabolic
  pathway shown here is based on both in vivo (solid lines) and in vitro (dashed lines)
  evidence. Saturated and unsaturated NAEs generated by the hydrolysis of NAPEs by
  PLD are hydrolyzed by FAAH to free fatty acids (FFAs) and ethanolamine (EA). In
  addition, polyunsaturated (PU)-NAEs can also be oxidized by LOX to form NAE-oxylipins.
  Both PLD and LOX are inhibited by NAE 12:0. N-acylation of PEs, with FFA and/or
  acyl-CoA as an acyl donor mediated by NAPE synthase, generates the NAPE
