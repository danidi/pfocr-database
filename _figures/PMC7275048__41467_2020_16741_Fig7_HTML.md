caption: a Snapshots of the intron active site derived from the crystal structures
  and the MD simulations. In the pre-catalytic state, which corresponds to the pre-hydrolytic
  state of the first step of splicing, a water molecule (light blue sphere, W) or
  the 2′-OH of a bulged adenosine are poised for nucleophilic attack on the scissile
  phosphate (orange sphere, SP) (PDB id. 4FAQ). In this state, the intron established
  the K1–N7G288 interaction, and the nucleophile cleaves the intron-5en junction.
  Immediately after hydrolytic cleavage, the proton released by the nucleophile initially
  to the bulk solvent is shuttled to C358 in the catalytic triad. C358 protonation
  favors release of the metal ions cluster and toggling of J2/3 junction (PDB id.
  4FAX). This conformational rearrangement likely prompts the release of the products
  of the first step of splicing, subsequent rearrangement of D6, and reverse toggling
  of J2/3 to reconstitute the active site and align second step reactants. Finally,
  cleavage of intron-3e junction leads to the release of free linear intron (PDB id.
  4E8M) and spliced exons. The free intron is still an active ribozyme, which can
  retrotranspose into target genomic DNA and re-initiate a new splicing cycle (dashed
  gray arrow). Relevant intron motifs are shown as cartoon representations in green.
  The 5e is in blue, the 3e in brown. K1 is shown as a violet sphere, M1 and M2 as
  yellow spheres. K2 is not shown for clarity. Intron states described in this work
  are labeled red, and differences between consecutive panels are indicated as bold
  orange labels. b Sketches of the intron active sites corresponding to the precatalytic
  state (with K1–N7 interaction, left) and to the K1 release and toggling (right)
  drawn in the same style as in Fig. a. For clarity, only the 5′-splice site is represented.
  The red dotted arrow indicates the proton transfer pathway from the nucleophile
  (Nuc) to N3C358.
