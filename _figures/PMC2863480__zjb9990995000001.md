caption: DOXP pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis in M. tuberculosis. The metabolic
  pathway from Dxs to LytB is shown. Enzyme names are given with the corresponding
  H37Rv gene numbers in parentheses. IPP, isopentenyl phosphate; DMAPP, dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate HMB-PP, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate is boxed.
