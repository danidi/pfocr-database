caption: Schematic diagram of protein-protein interactions and downstream processes
  of a subset of kinases with differentially regulated probe labeling at 24 hours
  after BEZ-235 treatment. Proteins included had at least one peptide significantly
  increasing or decreasing (with an average fold-change > 1.6 or < −1.6 and p-values
  < 0.05 using student’s two tailed t-tests. Known BEZ-235 targets (ATM, MTOR, PI3K)
  are indicated with the red inhibition arrow. Proteins with red fill colors are increasing
  while those with blue fill colors are decreasing, and grey proteins are not detected
  in the dataset, but are included as known mediators of downstream signaling. The
  colored dots on the right of each protein indicate quantification results specific
  to each method, as indicated in the legend.
