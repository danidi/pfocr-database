caption: Hypoxic signaling connected to Siah. Under the hypoxia condition, hypoxia-activated
  p38 and Akt pathways positively regulate Siah2 activity through phosphorylation
  and induction, respectively. Siah2 is phosphorylated by p38 on its serine and threonine
  residues, which will enhance its activity. Akt pathway increases the abundance of
  Siah2 by induction of its mRNA through signaling pathways yet to be clarified. Induced
  and activated Siah2 modulates the hypoxic signaling through PHD3 degradation and
  HIF-1α stabilization on one hand. Although, it is not yet identified, other Siah2
  substrates would also play roles on hypoxic signaling by both HIF-1α-dependent and
  -independent mechanism.
