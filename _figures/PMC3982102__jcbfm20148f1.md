caption: Simplified presentation of 13C labeling patterns of metabolites after injection
  of [1,2-13C]glucose. (A) Overview of the principal metabolic pathways investigated
  in this study. (B) Labeling patterns in lactate, alanine, aspartate, glutamate,
  glutamine, and GABA after metabolism of [1,2-13C]glucose. Circles symbolize the
  carbon backbone of the molecules. Red crosses mark the position of the label resulting
  from glycolysis, followed by conversion to acetyl CoA by PDH where applicable. A
  purple cross indicates that the pyruvate (resulting from glycolytic metabolism)
  has instead undergone pyruvate carboxylation before being converted to the metabolite
  in question. Green circles mark labeling from the PPP, also followed by conversion
  to acetyl CoA by PDH where applicable. A blue oval indicates that the pyruvate (resulting
  from metabolism in the PPP) has instead entered the TCA cycle via PC. After PC,
  the metabolite can undergo backflux from oxaloacetate to succinate. If the glucose
  has been metabolized via PPP before being converted to pyruvate and subjected to
  pyruvate carboxylation, then this will lead to distinct labeling patterns. These
  are marked as ‘BF' in the figure. For simplicity, only condensation of oxaloacetate
  with unlabeled acetyl CoA is shown for the second turn. BF, backflux; GS, glutamine
  synthetase; P, phosphate; PAG, phosphate activated glutaminase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway.
