caption: Parallel communication routes between the immune system and brain. The neural
  pathway involves rapid communication of immune signals via primary afferent nerves.
  For instance, peripherally produced cytokines directly stimulate vagal afferents
  from the liver to elicit central responses. In the diffusion pathway, blood-derived
  cytokines passively traverse the blood-brain barrier at “leaky” brain regions, including
  the circumventricular organs. Transportation of peripheral cytokines occurs by an
  energy-dependent, saturable process involving transporters integral in the blood-brain
  barrier. A fourth route of communication currently being investigated involves endothelial
  cells composing the blood-brain barrier. It is believed that circulating cytokines
  bind to endothelial receptors to elicit the release of immune molecules (e.g., cytokines,
  NOS, etc.) directly into brain regions. Regardless of the pathway, inflammatory
  mediators released into the CNS activate brain microglial cells to release inflammatory
  cytokines, which subsequently bind neuronal receptors in specific brain regions
  (e.g., hippocampus) to initiate the sickness behavior syndrome.
