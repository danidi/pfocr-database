caption: Putative major cardioprotective signal transduction cascades downstream of
  cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG). This general schematic integrates, in simplified
  form, major strands of evidence from studies in which acute protection (enhanced
  cell survival or infarct size limitation) has been assessed. These mechanisms may
  not be relevant to protection against arrhythmia development and they have not been
  comprehensively explored in delayed protection. A major determinant of the mode
  and extent of cell death is proposed to be opening of the mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore (mPTP) in early reperfusion. Both classical preconditioning and
  postconditioning, and pharmacological interventions that mimic these protective
  interventions, are postulated to inhibit transition pore opening at reperfusion.
  The cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate/cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGMP/PKG)
  pathway may influence transition pore opening indirectly in several ways. Activated-PKG
  phosphorylates multiple proteins associated with intracellular Ca2+ handling, including
  phospholamban and the L-type Ca2+ channel, attenuating intracellular Ca2+ load.
  The decrease in Ca2+ overload may be further enhanced by reduced production of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) at reperfusion by unknown mechanisms in the protected myocardium.
  PKG also signals, via protein kinase C (PKC)-ɛ, to cause opening of the mitochondrial
  KATP channel (mKATP) leading to ROS generation. ROS act as signalling intermediates,
  activating distal kinases including p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  and PKC-ɛ. Other kinases may be phosphorylated downstream of p42/p44 MAPK and PKC.
  It is noteworthy that nitric oxide (NO) may also directly inhibit mPTP opening and
  may also inhibit the electron transport chain (ETC) by mechanisms that are independent
  of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) activation and cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate
  (cGMP) accumulation.
