caption: Working model for the effects of 15d-PGJ2 and thiazolidinediones on TNF-stimulated
  NFκB activation and COX2 expression. Depicted in this schematic diagram is the NFκB
  signaling pathway, through which TNF and other cytokines stimulate COX2 gene expression
  in WISH and amnion cells []. Upon binding to its cellular receptor, TNF invokes
  a signaling cascade whereby the IκB kinase (IKK) complex becomes activated. IKK
  acts to phosphorylate IκB, leading to the destruction of this protein by the 26
  S proteasome complex. Once this occurs, NFκB can migrate to the nucleus, bind to
  response elements within the 5′-promoter region of the COX2 gene, and activate transcription.
  Independently of PPARG, 15d-PGJ2 may act at multiple steps in this pathway to impede
  NFκB activation, either by inhibiting of IKK activity (1), or by attenuating destruction
  of IκB by the 26 S proteasome complex (2). The effects of 15d-PGJ2 through activation
  of the PPARG receptor are unclear (3); however, our current data indicate that pharmacological
  activation of PPARG by thiazolidinediones (TZDs) might lead to enhanced COX2 transcription.
