caption: Regulation of slingshot-cofilin pathway by reactive oxygen specious in SMCs.
  Cofilin is phosphorylated and inactivated by LIM kinase, and p-cofiln is dephosphorylated
  and activated by phosphatase slingshots-1L. SSHL is sequestered by a regulatory
  protein 14-3-3. Increasing level of ROS oxidizes 14-3-3, releasing SSH1L phosphatase,
  which, on the one hand, dephosphorylates other SSH1L molecules to increase SSH1L
  phosphatase activity. On the other hand, SSH1L dephosphorylates cofilin, which recycles
  actin monomers for cytoskeletal remodeling during smooth muscle cell migration.
