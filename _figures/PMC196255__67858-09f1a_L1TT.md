caption: (A) The insulin receptor signaling pathway is conserved in  mammals, C. elegans,
  and Drosophila. (B)  Identification of a Drosophila homolog of FOXO/DAF-16. Sequence  alignment
  showing the high degree of conservation displayed in the DNA-binding  domains of
  FOXO4 and dFOXO. The three conserved Akt phosphorylation motifs are  boxed, and
  the amino acids that can be phosphorylated are in boldface.  Asterisks mark identical
  amino acids; colons mark conserved amino acid  changes; dots indicate weakly conserved
  changes. (C) FOXO family  members have a 5-amino-acid insertion between helices
  2 and 3 in the  DNA-binding domain, which is lacking in the rest of forkhead-related
  proteins.  (D) Antibodies raised against recombinant C- and N-terminal regions  of
  dFOXO recognize a band with similar mobility in Drosophila S2 cell  extracts. A
  representation of dFOXO indicating the fragments used for antibody  production is
  shown below. (E) Insulin treatment produces a  slower-mobility form of dFOXO (marked
  with an asterisk) that is detected with  endogenous (lanes 1,2) or overexpressed
  (lanes 3,4) dFOXO.  (F) Overexpressed dFOXO is phosphorylated upon insulin treatment
  of  S2 cells (lane 2). Pretreatment of samples with LY294002 before  insulin treatment
  reduces the amount of dFOXO that is phosphorylated (lane  3). dFOXOA3 is not phosphorylated
  upon insulin treatment (lanes  4–6). The lower panel shows the same samples  after
  phosphatase treatment. A scheme representing wild-type and mutant dFOXO  is shown
  below.
