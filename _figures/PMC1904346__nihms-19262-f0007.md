caption: Glucose-dependent MafA expression involves the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway
  and O-GlcNAcylation. Flux through the HBP under high glucose conditions increases
  UDP-GlcNAc levels. UDP-GlcNAc is the substrate for OGT leading to the O-GlcNAcylation
  of an unknown protein(s) responsible for MafA up-regulation. DON and azaserine,
  inhibitors of GFAT, block the glucose-dependent expression of MafA, whereas GlcN
  treatment in the presence of low glucose stimulates MafA expression. PUGNAc, an
  inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, increases MafA expression on low glucose concentrations,
  whereas siRNA knockdown of OGT decreases MafA expression under high glucose conditions.
  Flux through the HBP under high glucose or glucosamine conditions also leads to
  an increase in insulin mRNA levels, probably by a mechanism involving increased
  MafA expression and MafA binding to the C1 element of the insulin promoter.
