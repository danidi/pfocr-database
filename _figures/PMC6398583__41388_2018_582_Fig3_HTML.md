caption: The control of aerobic glycolysis by ERK and JNK signaling pathways in proliferating
  cells. Glycolysis (red-dotted shape) starts when glucose enters the cells through
  GLUTs and is converted into glucose-6-phosphate by the first glycolytic enzyme hexokinase
  (HK). The final product of glycolysis is pyruvate. Its production is tightly regulated
  by the glycolytic enzyme PKM2, whose activation, conformational state, and cellular
  localization is tightly regulated by posttranslational modifications, which includes
  phosphorylation, cysteine oxidation, and acetylation. Pyruvate could be further
  oxidized in the mitochondrion through its conversion to acetyl-CoA for subsequent
  oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The shunting of pyruvate into the
  mitochondrion is regulated by the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which
  in turn is negatively regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) under hypoxia.
  In proliferating cells, a largest amount of pyruvate is converted to lactate contributing
  to the Warburg effect. The formation of lactate, catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH), is necessary for the rapid regeneration of NAD+ from NADH, which is then
  reused to maintain active the glycolytic flux. Aerobic glycolysis of cells in multicellular
  organisms is regulated by both extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways.
  Engagement of growth factors to their receptors signals activation of PI3K/AKT pathway
  and the phosphorylation cascade of RAS/BRAF/MEK/ERK (green-dotted shape). The BRAF/MEK/ERK
  signaling cascade can be also activated by oncogenic mutations and culminates with
  activation and translocation of ERK to the nucleus, which regulates the expression
  and activity of transcription factors that directly control the expression of glycolytic
  enzymes in cancer cells. This network of transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible
  factor-1α (HIF-1α) and c-Myc, drives the Warburg effect downstream of oncogenic
  BRAF(V600E) mutation in melanomas. Binding and activation of MEK by BRAF is further
  enhanced after accumulation in the cytoplasm of acetoacetate, a byproduct of ketogenesis—a
  biochemical process by which cells produce ketone bodies by the breakdown of fatty
  acids and ketogenic amino acids such as glutamine (gray-dotted shape). RAS-mediated
  oncogenesis and cellular stress also contribute to the activation of JNK cascade
  (blue-dotted shape). Once activated, upstream MAP3K kinases (e.g., TAK1 and MLK3)
  phosphorylate and activate MKK4 and MKK7, which in turn phosphorylate and stimulate
  the activity of distinct JNK isoforms. Upon activation, each JNK protein delivers
  different cellular activities. While JNK1 negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis
  via direct phosphorylation of PKM2 and PDH, JNK2 positively controls aerobic glycolysis
  via upregulation of PARP14, a direct inhibitor of JNK1-mediated phosphorylation
  of PKM2 in cancer cells. Notably, JNK1 activation depends also on the formation
  and accumulation of mitochondrial and cellular ROS
