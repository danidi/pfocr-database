caption: When challenged with stimuli such as the bacterial ligand LPS, IFN‐γ, the
  bacterium M. tuberculosis and the fungus C. albicans, macrophages remodel their
  metabolism so that glucose import and glycolysis are enhanced, and the TCA cycle
  is compromised. Increased levels of TCA intermediates citrate and succinate play
  direct roles in promoting antimicrobial responses. Citrate is a precursor of itaconate,
  an inhibitor of microbial glyoxylate cycle enzyme isocitrate lyase (ICL) and host
  succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), while succinate stabilises the transcriptional activator
  of glucose utilisation genes and antimicrobial cytokines, HIF‐1α. Similarly, microbes
  adapt their metabolism by transcriptionally upregulating the glyoxylate shunt pathway,
  glycolysis and gluconeogenesis at distinct stages of infection. Reprogramming of
  microbial metabolism depends on available nutrients, including host‐derived lactate
  and itaconate. Mitochondria and nucleus (labelled orange and blue, respectively)
  are present in fungi, but not in bacteria. In fungi, the glyoxylate cycle reactions
  are further compartmentalised in the peroxisome (indicated by yellow shading). Metabolites
  and enzymes up‐ and down‐regulated during macrophage–microbe interaction are shown
  in red and purple, respectively. HIF‐1α, hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1α; ICL, isocitrate
  lyase; ICT/CCL, succinyl‐CoA:itaconate CoA transferase/(S)‐citramalyl‐CoA lyase;
  IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; IRG1, immune‐responsive gene 1; MS, malate synthase;
  SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; TF, transcription factor.
