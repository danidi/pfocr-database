caption: 'Estrogen-related signaling in HPV+ cells. Circulating estrogen interacts
  with its receptors and multiple interactions can contribute to the growth and death
  of HPV-infected cells. (A): HPV and estrogen in carcinogenesis. Interactions between
  estrogen and GPER1 or ER have shown to activate the PI3K pathway. This enhances
  Bcl2 expression and inhibits apoptosis. The PI3K pathway also activates c-Myc and
  cyclin D1. This enhances cell cycle progression and the promotion of the G1 to S
  transition enhances viral replication. Moreover, mouse studies have shown that the
  expression of HPV E7 and ERα are necessary for cervical cancer development. (B):
  HPV and estrogen as a possible treatment paradigm. Estrogen activation of phosphodiesterase
  3A (PDE3A) stabilizes protein turnover of Schlafen 12 (SLFN12). SLFN12 binds to
  ribosomes and stops ER protein translation, including blocking Bcl2 and Mcl1. This
  induces cytochrome C release from the mitochondria and initiates apoptosis. Estrogen
  and ERα have also shown to interact with HPV 16 E6 and E7 to enhance HPV+ cell sensitivity
  to estrogen. Moreover, estrogen and ERα have been shown to interact with the HPV16
  LCR to inhibit HPV transcription. Finally, HPV has been shown to enhance the expression
  of ERα and this correlates with enhanced clinical outcomes.'
