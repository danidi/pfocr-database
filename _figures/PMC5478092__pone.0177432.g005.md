caption: (A) In times of no stress, ATF-7 is bound to the CRE-like sequence located
  in the promoter region of mtl-1 thus blocking transcriptional activation. Additionally,
  the AKT-1/-2 complex is inhibiting the ability of PMK-1 to translocate to the nucleus.
  (B) Upon the introduction of stress PDK-1 is phosphorylated which leads to the phosphorylation
  of the AKT-1/-2 complex. This activation causes the release and subsequent activation
  of PMK-1 allowing it to translocate to the nucleus. PMK-1 phosphorylated ATF-7 releasing
  it from the DNA which allows ELT-2 to bind the GATA sequence initiating transcription
  of mtl-1.
