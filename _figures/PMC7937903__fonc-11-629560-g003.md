caption: Effect of YTHDFs on tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) (A) Dendritic cells
  (DC) presents the antigen to the surface of T cells and initiates the adaptive immune
  response. Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
  is a negative immune checkpoint pathway that inhibit immune responses and promotes
  immune escape of tumor cells. This process can be blocked by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies.
  Macrophages can affect anti-tumor immunity by secreting inflammatory factors. (B)
  When YTHDF1 is deficient, the translation efficiency of lysosomal protease transcripts
  decreases, the degradation of antigens is reduced, more antigens are involved in
  antigen presentation, and the immune response of T cells is enhanced. This process
  may affect the efficacy of PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors. (C) In macrophages, YTHDF2
  knockdown promotes the translation and stability of MAP2K4 and MAP4K4 mRNA, which
  activates MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways and promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines. These inflammatory factors can participate in the regulation of immune
  response and affect the efficacy of anti-tumor immunity.
