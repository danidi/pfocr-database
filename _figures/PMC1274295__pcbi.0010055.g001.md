caption: The ammonification, denitrification, detoxification, nitrogen fixation, and
  nitrification pathways are shown by colored solid lines with genes names involved
  in the pathway. The dashed black line shows possible non-enzymatic interconversions
  of nitrogen oxides. The dotted line shows additional formation of NO and hydroxylamine
  during nitrite ammonification.
