caption: Figure 2.  PI3K coordinates metabolic control and inflammatory signaling.
  Our proposed model for PI3K mediated signaling in obesity postulates that increased
  expression of the class IA regulatory subunits, p50α and p55α, inhibits insulin-stimulated
  PI3K activity for glucose uptake and suppression of lipolysis causing adipocyte
  insulin resistance. Concomitantly, reduced PI3K activity enhances activation of
  nuclear factor κB (NFκB) to promote inflammatory cytokine secretion in adipocytes
  and increased secretion of adhesion molecules in the vascular endothelial cells.
  Combined, these signals promote adipose tissue recruitment and pro-inflammatory
  activation of macrophage causing a feed forward cycle that leads to infiltration
  of additional macrophages into adipose tissue. This results in the exacerbation
  of the inflammatory state and systemic insulin resistance.
