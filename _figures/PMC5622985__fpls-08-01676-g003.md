caption: Diverse roles of ethylene in regulating agronomic traits in rice. In rice,
  ethylene regulates a wide variety of major agronomic traits ranging from emerging
  from the soil to grain filling and senescence. Ethylene promotes growth of coleoptiles/mesocotyls
  by partially inhibiting JA biosynthesis. In contrast, JA promotes rice leaf senescence
  through a cascade of OsCOI1b-OsJAZ-OsEIN3-OsORE1. JA and ethylene synergistically
  accelerate rice leaf senescence by activating common and differential SAGs. Ethylene
  positively regulates rice grain size/weight, flowering, tillering and leaf angle
  but negatively affects rice grain filling and salt tolerance. The lower ratio of
  ethylene to ABA is beneficial for rice grain filling. Upon submergence, SUB1A negatively
  regulates GA response by inhibiting the degradation of SLR1/SLRL1 to restrict plant
  growth in submergence-tolerance species. On the contrary, ethylene promotes internode
  elongation through increasing transcription of SK1/2 and GA production to escape
  flooding in deepwater rice. OsGI1, OsGIGANTEA1; RCN1, TERMINAL FLOWER1/CENTRORADIALIS-like;
