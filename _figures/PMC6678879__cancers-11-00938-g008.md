caption: (A) miR526b and miR655 overexpressing cells showing significant down regulation
  of tumour suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mRNA expression.
  Data are represented as mean ± SD.; * (p < 0.05). (B) The proposed pathway of tumour
  associated angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis promotion by miR655 and miR526b. miRNA
  over expressing cells are high in COX-2 expression, resulting in production of PGE2
  and its subsequent release into the tumour microenvironment. PGE2 can signal through
  EP4 in both an autocrine and paracrine fashion. Signalling through EP4 on tumour
  cells stimulates ERK and PI3k/Akt signalling pathways, resulting in the upregulation
  of miR526b and miR655. Subsequently, miR526b and miR655 target tumour suppressor
  gene PTEN. Thus, the inhibitory effect of PTEN on hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1a),
  as well as the PI3K/Akt pathway, is prevented by upregulation of these miRNAs. Without
  regulation, transcription factor HIF-1a promotes VEGFA, C, D transcription, and
  thus an overproduction of VEGFs and their subsequent release into the tumour microenvironment
  for both autocrine and paracrine signalling. VEGF molecules will bind to various
  VEGF receptor (VEGFR1, VEGFR2) molecules present on vascular endothelial cells (VECs)
  and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) to promote angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis,
  respectively. In the absence PTEN’s regulation on PI3k/Akt pathway within the tumour
  cell, growth and proliferation is promoted.

  description: (A) miR526b and miR655 overexpressing cells showing significant down
    regulation of tumour suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mRNA

    PGE2 can signal through EP4 in both an autocrine and paracrine fashion. Signalling
