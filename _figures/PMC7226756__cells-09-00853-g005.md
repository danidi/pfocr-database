caption: Gut dysbiosis causes epithelial inflammation. When harmful, particularly
  E. coli, Gram-negative bacteria secrete lipopolysaccharides that activate the TLR4
  pathway and later on cause intestinal-wall and epithelial inflammation. This lipopolysaccharide
  not only activates the TLR4 signaling pathway, but also microglial and astrocyte
  cells in the gut, that then secrete proinflammatory cytokines. These proinflammatory
  cytokines later gain entry to the bloodstream via a leaky gut. This serum LPS then
  disrupts the blood–brain-barrier (BBB) and enters the brain, where it reactivates
  microglia, and various inflammatory and amyloid genic pathways.
