  infection induced inflammation mediating coagulation pathway- a SARS-CoV-2 infection
  has been reported to be associated with an increased activation of innate immune
  system which are known to activate NF-κB, a key transcription factor that activates
  numerous genes involved in the cellular immune response responsible for ‘cytokine
  storm’ (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-2 and MCP1) and inflammation. NF-κB signalling cascade in
  endothelial cells is capable of regulating both pro-inflammatory and coagulatory
  responses. b NF-κB triggers neutrophils which upon full activation expel their DNA
  in conjunction with histones and other associated proteins and lead to the formation
  of NETs via PAD4-mediated histone citrullination responsible for inducing a strong
  coagulatory response. c the target genes of NF-κB are cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)
  such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin which are expressed on the surface of endothelial
  cells and intervene the adherence  as well as transmigration of leukocytes including
  monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages and platelets to the vascular wall
  and this further triggers increasing their thrombogenic potential. d The infiltration
  of inflammatory cells and leukocyte–platelet conjugates to the endothelium activates
  VWF, an another important prothrombotic factor on the endothelium which allows the
  aggregation of platelets leading to the thrombus formation, e NF-κB is known to
  activate the transcription of various targeting genes significant to thrombosis
  including TF and FXII which ultimately converge at common pathway of the thrombus
  synthesis. f cytokine storm induced by NF-κB is also known to modulate both TF dependent
  and contact activation pathway. g cytokine storm also activates VWF, a prothrombotic
  factor for platelets aggregation responsible for the thrombus formation. The dashed
