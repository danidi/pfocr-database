caption: 'Metabolism of sulfur amino acids and H2S synthesis. The typical intake of
  the sum of methionine and Cys in adults ranges between 1.8 and 6.8 g·day−1 (Nimni
  et al., ). Methionine is converted by methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT I/III
  and MATII) to S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM), which donates the methyl group in numerous
  biologically important methylation reactions. S‐adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is cleaved
  to homocysteine (Hcy) and adenosine by S‐adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (SAHH).
  Hcy can be metabolized back to methionine by methionine synthase (MTR) with the
  help of methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) in a folate‐ and cobalamin‐dependent
  remethylation pathway, or by liver‐dependent betaine‐homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT) using betaine as a methyl‐group donor. Alternatively, the sulfur of Hcy can
  be irreversibly metabolized to sulfate by the transsulfuration pathway: Hcy is condensed
  with serine to form cystathionine (Cystat), which is subsequently cleaved to form
  Cys, ammonia and α‐ketobutyrate; these reactions are catalysed by CBS and γ‐cystathionase
  (CSE) respectively. These two cytosolic enzymes can also use Cys and/or Hcy to synthesize
  H2S. H2S can also be synthesized in mitochondria from Cys by aspartate amino transferase
  (AST) and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase and from methanethiol by methanethiol
  oxidase (MTO). Furthermore, cysteinyl t‐RNA synthetase enzymes (e.g. the mitochondrial
  CARS2 or other CPERS) use Cys to produce Cys‐persulfide (CysSSH) and polysulfide
  species in a PLP‐dependent manner. These polysulfides are reduced by the thioredoxin
  (TRx) and GSH systems using NADPH to give H2S and Cys as final products. Excess
  Cys can be further converted into taurine in a series of reactions – including cysteine
  dioxygenase (CDO). Mitochondrial oxidation of H2S involves several steps yielding
  thiosulfate, sulfite and finally sulfate; for details, see Figure . In this study,
  we determined H2S and additional metabolites (shown in bold double framed rectangles).
  Enzymes catalysing individual reactions are shown in shaded ovals.'
