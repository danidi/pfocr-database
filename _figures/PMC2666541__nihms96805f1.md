caption: '(panel A) ODC expression is regulated by a number of signaling pathways.
  The APC tumor suppressor gene influences the expression of the MYC oncogene and
  the MYC antagonist MAD1(). These E-box transcription factors, in turn, bind to consensus
  elements, including two E-boxes flanking a SNP which has functional consequences
  for transcription factor binding, to regulate ODC transcription (). ODC expression
  is also regulated by the K-RAS oncogene (). ODC converts ornithine to the diamine
  putrescine. This diamine is the precursor for the longer chain amines spermidine
  and spermine. Genetic and pharmacological evidence shows that this pathway is essential
  for normal growth, development, tissue repair and neoplasia (). (panel B) The relationship
  between polyamine metabolism and inflammatory pathways in the colonic mucosa are
  depicted in this panel. Abbreviations include: ROS (reactive oxygen species), NO
  (nitric oxide), Arg (arginine), Orn (ornithine), Put (putrescine), COX (cyclooygenease),
  NOS (nitric oxide synthase), ODC (ornithine decarboxylase), SAT1 (spermidine/spermine
  N1-acetyltransferase). Diamines, including putrescine, monoacetylspermidine and
  diacetylspermidine are exported by a common transporter (), which was recently identified
  by us to including the solute carrier protein SLC3A2 (). SLC3A2 partners with members
  of the Y+LAT family to form an arginine transporter. The roles of luminal factors,
  including polyamines and secondary bile acids, and stromal factors, such as prostaglandins,
  are shown. DFMO and sulindac lower polyamine contents in colonic epithelial cells
  by suppressing polyamine synthesis and activating polyamine catabolism and export.
  Sulindac also inhibits mucosal cyclooxygenases, which are predominately expressed
  in the colonic stroma prior to the formation of epithelial neoplasia.'
