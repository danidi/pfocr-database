number: Figure 1
caption: Expression of key genes of each pathway, CO, FLC, and MYB33 as well as FT
  and SOC1 of the floral integrator were tested. SPL3 and miR156, which can influence
  flowering by an endogenous pathway acting downstream of the floral integrator were
  also tested. ELF6 and EDM2 genes are known to delay and advance flowering, respectively.
  Mutants (knockout) lines of elf6 and edm2 were included as control lines. Genes
  (transcripts) tested in this work are shown in blue. Genes mutated in  Arabidopsis  lines
  tested in this work are shown in red. The work showed that PP2A-B55 was a negative
  regulator of flowering time possibly acting downstream of/at the floral integrator,
  whereas PP2A-B’γ was a positive component in flower induction acting through modulation
  of FLC expression.
