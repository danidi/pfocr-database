caption: High altitude headache can be due to at least two pathways. The first is
  the reduction of blood oxygen saturation (SO2), which triggers compensatory hyperventilation
  and excessive elimination of carbon dioxide (CO2) which, in turn, increases blood
  pH (alkalosis). The importance of alkalosis in high altitude headache is shown by
  the therapeutic effects of acetazolamide, that reduces blood pH. The second pathway
  is the activation of cyclooxygenase (COX) by hypoxia with an increase in prostaglandin
  (PG) synthesis which, in turn, induces cerebral vasodilation. High altitude headache
  can be treated with oxygen or COX inhibitors, like aspirin, and these treatments
  require two different therapeutic rituals. In the former, oxygen is breathed through
  a mask, in the latter, aspirin is a pill that is taken orally. This allows the study
  of the mechanisms of two different placebos associated to two different rituals.
