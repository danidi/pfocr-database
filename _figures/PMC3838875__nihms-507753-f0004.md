caption: The data gathered from isotopic tracing of d4-C16:0 FFA labeled cancer cells
  was compiled into a metabolic pathway map using the KEGG Pathway Database as a guide.
  d4-C16:0 FFA incorporation into the lipid structures is noted in red. The color
  of arrows and metabolites notes increased (in red), decreased (in blue), or unchanged
  (in grey) levels of d4-lipid in three out of five comparisons of aggressive (231MFP,
  M4, SKOV3, PC3, and C8161) versus non-aggressive (MCF7, MCF10A, OVCAR3, LNCaP, and
  MUM2C, respectively) cancer cells. Metabolites and arrows in black were not detected
  in either targeted or untargeted analysis. LPA, C1P, DAG, and PAF are oncogenic
  signaling lipids that act through LPA receptors, unknown receptor, protein kinase
  C, and PAF receptors, respectively.
