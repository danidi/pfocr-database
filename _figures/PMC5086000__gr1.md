caption: Inflammasome Activation Mechanisms during Bacterial Sexually Transmitted
  Infections (STIs). Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome occurs through the ligation
  of various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Chlamydia is taken up in a vacuole
  known as an inclusion, where activity of the Chlamydia type III secretion system
  triggers the NLRP3 inflammasome. Neisseria releases membrane lipooligosaccharide,
  which has been suggested to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through a cathepsin-B-dependent
  pathway. Treponema surface proteins TpF1 and Td92 activate the NLRP3 inflammasome
  dependent on K+ efflux. Since our understanding of inflammasomes and their activation
  mechanisms is incomplete in bacterial STIs, other mechanisms may also be involved.
  It is also unclear whether the same mechanisms are important in vivo.
