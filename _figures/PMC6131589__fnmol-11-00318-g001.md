caption: Sights and mechanisms of mHTT toxicity in yeast models of HD. Multiple sources
  and modulatory pathways of mHTT toxicity have been identified in different models
  of HD in yeast (dysfunctional mitochondria, aggregation, altered stress responses,
  kynurenine pathway, and more). The combination of toxic effects leads to increased
  cell death. The microscopy inset shows pictures of typical aggregation of GFP tagged
  exon 1-poly(Q) constructs in a widely used S. cerevisiae model of HD (), 24 h after
  galactose-induction of chronologically aged yeast cells. KMO, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
