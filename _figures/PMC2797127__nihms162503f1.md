caption: Overview of the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway. Latent TGF-β, bound to the
  ECM, undergoes an activation step (see text), releasing the TGF-β ligand which binds
  to the constitutively active Type II receptor at the cell surface. The Type I receptor
  is recruited into the complex where it is phosphorylated. The activated Type I receptor
  phosphorylates R-Smads (Smads 2 and 3) at the C-terminal serine residues and the
  R-Smads complex with the common mediator Smad4. This complex translocates to the
  nucleus where it regulates transcription of target genes and binds to a variety
  of transcription factors (TF).
