caption: Proposed scheme, illustrating the involvement of TRPV4 in mechanosensitivity
  in the distal nephron cells. PLA2 – phospholipase A2, AA – arachidonic acid, CYP450
  – cytochrome P450 epoxygenase, EETs – epoxyeicosatrienoic acids,   – proline rich
  domain, PC-1 – polycystin-1, PKC – protein kinase C, PLC- phospholipase C, P2Y2R
  – P2Y2 receptor, Cx30 – connexin 30 hemichannel. In the kidney TRPV4 forms a heteromeric
  channel with polycystin-2 (TRPP2), which is a part of a larger mechanosensitive
  complex also involving of PC-1. Mechanical stress stimulates PLA2 – CYP450 pathway,
  which metabolizes AA to EETs. EETs activate TRPV4 channel to elicit Ca2+ influx
  in response to hypotonicity or elevated flow. This activation can be prevented by
  interaction of TRPV4 N-terminal proline rich domain with PACSIN 3 protein. On the
  other hand, mechanical stimuli induce ATP release from distal nephron cells through
  Cx30 hemichannels. Locally released ATP binds to purinergic P2Y2 receptors on the
  apical membrane of renal epithelium. This leads to Gq/11 dependent activation of
  PLC and, likely, PKC and further augmenting TRPV4 activity.
