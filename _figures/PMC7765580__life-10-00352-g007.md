caption: Production of ribonucleotide precursors by γ-radiolysis of briny HCN solutions
  demonstrated by Fahrenbach and co-workers []. (A) Radiolysis of briny water produces
  the reducing and oxidising species required for the synthesis of glycolaldehyde
  4 and cyanamide 26 which come together in the first step of the Powner-Sutherland
  pathway to produce 2-aminooxazole 27. (B) Scheme for the experimental procedure
  that starts with gamma radiolysis followed by dry-down and heating. Schemes were
  redrawn based on  and  from reference [].
