caption: Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the second messenger signaling pathway
  proposed for Zn2+. Various external stimuli cause protein kinase CK2 to phosphorylate
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) located zinc transporter, ZIP7 which causes the gated
  release of Zn2+ stored within the ER through the ZIP7 channel to create a cytosolic
  ‘zinc wave’. After phosphorylating its target CK2 dissociates from ZIP7 and may
  move into the nucleus. We postulate that elevated Zn2+ within the cytosol may selectively
  inhibit tyrosine phosphatases leading to prolonged tyrosine kinase activation and
  an observed downstream increase in pERK and pAKT resulting in cell proliferation
  and migration. These events, representing a short-term second messenger activity
  for Zn, completing within a 20 min time period, are thus temporally separated from
  established transcriptional impact of zinc ions which is mediated by metal transcription
  factor-1 (MTF-1) and is known to regulate metallothionein (MT), glutamylcysteine
  synthetase (GCS) and ZnT1 (SLC30A1).
