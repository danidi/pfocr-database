caption: A Yes-associated protein (YAP)–glutaminase axis mediates hepatic stellate
  cell transdifferentiation and liver fibrosis. Du et al present findings demonstrating
  that Hedgehog signaling mediates the up-regulation of glutaminase via a downstream
  mediator YAP of the Hippo signaling pathway. Up-regulation of glutaminase, an anaplerotic
  reaction that replenishes metabolic intermediates, such as α-ketoglutarate, sustains
  increased bioenergetic and biomass requirements of proliferating cells. Glutaminolysis
  has a critical role in the transdifferentiation of hepatic stellate cells into myofibroblasts,
  demonstrating increased proliferative, migratory, and fibrogenic capacities in the
  manifestation of liver fibrosis. Novel therapeutic and diagnostic strategies could
  be envisioned based on these molecular findings. TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
