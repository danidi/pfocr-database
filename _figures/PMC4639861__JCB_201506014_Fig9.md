caption: Model for Grhl2 function in coordinating differentiation and morphogenesis
  of airway epithelium. Krt5+ Trp63+ BCs of the pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium
  both self-renew and give rise to both Foxj1+ ciliated and secretory cells. This
  differentiation involves notch signaling and is thought to proceed via Trp63+ progenitors
  committed to either lineage pathway (yellow or blue nuclei; ; ; ). As progenitors
  and their descendants integrate into the epithelium, they acquire apical–basal polarity
  and apical–junctional complexes mediating barrier function. We propose that Grhl2
  coordinates these changes by acting through multiple downstream effectors, including
  direct Grhl2 target genes indicated by asterisks.
