caption: Schematic representation of photosynthetic electron transport in cyanobacteria.
  Black arrows – Linear Electron Flow (LEF) from water to NADP+. Red arrows – Cyclic
  Electron Flow (CEF), both the pathway involving Pgr5 and the pathway involving NDH.
  Blue arrows – pseudo-Cyclic Electron Flow (pCET), mediated by the Flv proteins.
  The D-lactate dehydrogenase variant (LDHSRT) is included for reference, converting
  pyruvate derived from the Calvin cycle into D-lactate and utilizing NADPH as an
  electron source. PSI, photosystem I; PSII, photosystem II, Fd, ferredoxin; FNR,
  ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase; PC, plastocyanin; Cyt b6f, cytochrome b6f.
