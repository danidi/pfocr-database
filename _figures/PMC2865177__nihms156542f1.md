caption: ER stress-induced apoptotic pathways. Under ER stress, PERK is activated
  by homodimerization and autophosphorylation. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2α,
  which subsequently induces proapoptotic factors ATF4 and CHOP. CHOP induces expression
  of numerous genes encoding proapoptotic factors, including DR5, TRB3, CAVI, and
  BCL2 family proteins that promote mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. CHOP also induces
  expression of GADD34 and ERO1α, leading to apoptosis by promoting protein synthesis
  and oxidation in the stressed ER. On activation of the UPR, IRE1α recruits TRAF2
  and leads to activation of the JNK-mediated apoptotic pathway. ER stress induces
  BAX and BAK localization and oligomerization at the ER, which promotes calcium efflux
  into the cytoplasm. Calcium uptake into the mitochondrial matrix depolarizes the
  inner membrane and leads to transition of the outer membrane permeability pore.
  This causes cytochrome c release and Apaf-1-dependent activation of the apoptosome,
  leading to apoptosis. In addition, it has been proposed that ER stress induces dissociation
  of TRAF2 from procaspase-12 residing on the ER membrane, allowing caspase-12 activation
  to mediate apoptosis. Mito, mitochondria; Cyt-C, cytochrome c; pCP12, procaspase-12;
  CP12, caspase-12; CP9, caspase-9; CP-3, caspase-3.
