caption: Our statistical analysis has identified three potentially distinct lymphomagenic
  pathways in AITL. The classic pathway accounts for approximately 60% of AITL cases
  and is characterized by the RHOA G17V mutation in association with several other
  recurrent mutations. The alternative pathway accounts for approximately 25% of AITL
  cases and is characterized by mutations in VAV1 or potentially other members of
  the Rho family of GTPases or their regulatory proteins. The mutations that drive
  the remaining approximately 15% of AITL cases are unknown. It is possible that mutations
  in signaling pathways directly regulating TFH differentiation contribute to these
  cases
