caption: Schematic representation of a plant cell with the major components involved
  in symbiotic signaling and defense signaling. The central vacuole has been omitted
  for clarity. Solid arrows indicate transport fluxes whereas dashed arrows represent
  signaling pathways. Receptor complexes involving LysM proteins originate from different
  plant species. Perception of bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) is represented by CERK1,
  LYM1, and LYM3 of Arabidopsis. Chitin perception is represented by rice proteins
  CERK1 and CEBiP. The nod factor receptors (NFR1 and NFR5) are from L. japonicus,
  whereas the elusive nature of the myc factor receptors (MFR1 and MFR2) is shown
  with question marks. The common SYM pathway is represented by SYMRK, NENA, NUP85,
  NUP133, CASTOR, POLLUX, CCAMK, and CYCLOPS from L. japonicus. The remaining components
  (MCA8, SIP2, FLOT4, PUB1, SYMREM1, SINA4, and HMGR1) were described in M. truncatula
  or L. japonicus, except for PDR1 that was discovered in petunia. See Table  and
  the main text for more information on the respective genes and their function in
  symbiosis.
