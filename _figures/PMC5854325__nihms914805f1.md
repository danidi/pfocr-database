caption: (A) Schematic of death receptor-mediated apoptosis in response to TNF. This
  pathway is highlighted by the formation of a soluble complex II containing TRADD,
  FADD and caspase-8 and subsequent activation of procaspase-8 by autocleavage. Inhibitors
  of this pathway are shown in red. (B) Schematic of death receptor-mediated apoptosis
  in response to FasL/TRAIL. Apoptosis induced by FasL/TRAIL is accomplished by formation
  of a DISC directly at the receptor. Inhibitors of this pathway are shown in red.
