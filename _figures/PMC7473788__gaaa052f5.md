caption: Working model proposing how TFAP2C functions downstream of the Hippo signaling
  pathway to regulate Cdx2 expression in the outside polar cells. (A) Proximity ligation
  assay (PLA) in blastocysts demonstrating nuclear interactions between TFAP2C and
  YAP1. Embryos (n = 3 biological replicates, 5/embryos/group/replicate). Red fluorescence
  dots (white arrow heads) indicate interactions between TCFAP2C and YAP1 in the outside
  cells. (B) During the morula to blastocyst transition, Hippo signaling is position
  dependent. During this period, TFAP2C is enriched in the polar outside cells and
  downregulated in the inside apolar cells. In the polar outside cells, AMOT is sequestered
  at the apical domain by F-actin preventing it from activating LATS1/2. Consequently,
  YAP can enter the nucleus and activates Cdx2 expression via TEAD4 and TFAP2C. Sox2
  is repressed via YAP1 and TEAD4. In the apolar inside cells, AMOT becomes phosphorylated
  and is associated with adherens junctions. There it forms a complex with NF2 and
  LATS1/2. Activated LATS1/2 subsequently phosphorylates YAP1 causing it to be degraded
  in the cytoplasm. As a result, Cdx2 is repressed and Sox2 is expressed allowing
  ICM lineage development.
