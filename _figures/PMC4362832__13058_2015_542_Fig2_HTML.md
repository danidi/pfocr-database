caption: Standard pathway by which microRNAs are processed and loaded onto RISC to
  regulate gene expression. Regulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression is controlled
  at the miRNA promoter by transcription factors (TF) and nuclear receptors (NR).
  After transcription, the pri-miRNA is processed inside the nucleus by Drosha and
  DGCR8 to form pre-miRNA – a hairpin miRNA. Exportin 5 exports the pre-miRNA from
  the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it gets cleaved further by Dicer, resulting
  in a short double-strand piece of RNA. These strands are separated into the passenger
  strand, which often gets degraded, and the mature strand, which is loaded onto RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC) for action on target mRNA. If the seed sequence (base pairs
  2 to 7) of the mature miRNA is complementary to the mRNA, the transcript is degraded.
  However, if there is not perfect complementarity between the miRNA seed sequence
  and its target mRNA, the result is inhibition of translation. DGCR8, DiGeorge syndrome
  chromosomal region 8.
