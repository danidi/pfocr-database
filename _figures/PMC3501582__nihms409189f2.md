caption: The hedgehog signaling pathway. In the absence of Shh, Ptch 1 suppresses
  signaling by smoothened (Smo). Binding of Shh to Ptch 1 relieves this inhibition.
  Activation of Smo leads to the activation and translocation of transcription factors
  of the Gli family into the nucleus, with subsequent changes in gene expression.
