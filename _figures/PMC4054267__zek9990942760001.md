caption: The calcineurin-Crz1 signaling pathway. When the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration
  increases, calmodulin activates calcineurin, which in turn dephosphorylates Crz1.
  Crz1 is then imported into the nucleus and induces or represses expression of its
  target genes. After phosphorylation (P), Crz1 is exported from the nucleus. Several
  regulators of this pathway have been identified. If not otherwise indicated, all
  denoted proteins were identified in S. cerevisiae. Sp = Schizosaccharomyces pombe;
  An = Aspergillus nidulans; Dd = Dictyostelium discoideum. For further explanation,
  see the main text.
