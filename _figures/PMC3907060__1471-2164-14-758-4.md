caption: 'Analyses of differentially expressed genes regulated by fasting in all three
  tissues revealing an involvement of p53 and Srebp signaling pathway. (A) Venn diagram
  of genes differentially regulated (1.3x, FDR5) in WAT, LIV, and SM and their intersections.
  (B) Two hundred genes differentially regulated in all three tissues were submitted
  to DAVID functional annotation using GO terms and KEGG pathways. Count shows the
  number of mapped genes and Benjamini-Hochberg’s correction was used for adjusting
  p-value for multiple testing. (C) Metacore mapping as obtained from analysis with
  the commonly regulated gene list. The thermometers display expression levels of
  mapped genes (1: WAT, 2: SM, 3: LIV). (D) Heatmap of p53 target genes discussed
  in the text. Values are log2 transformed. White dots mark highest expression between
  the 3 tissues. (E) and (F) Manually compiled heatmaps indicating expression levels
  of genes comprising the FA (E) and cholesterol biosynthesis (F) pathways. Values
  are log2 transformed. White dots mark highest expression between the 3 tissues.'
