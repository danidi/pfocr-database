caption: Schematic drawing of endocytic and secretory pathways in relation to the
  life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the cell by endocytosis (step
  1). The endocytic pathway consists of various early and late recycling endosomes
  and late endosome (also called multivesicular bodies, MVB) before maturing into
  the lysosome. Newly made proteins enter the secretory pathway via ER and are transported
  to the TGN via the ERGIC and then the Golgi stack before being transported to the
  cell surface via transport carriers that bud from the TGN and fuse with the plasma
  membrane. Some of the internalized viruses are released from the endosome into the
  cytoplasm (step 2) for unpacking and viral replication and assembly (step 3). Newly
  made viral S protein and other membrane proteins enter the ER (step 4) whereas viral
  RNA genome and nucleocapsid protein are assembled on the membrane of the ERGIC to
  trigger inward budding to form the previral particles into the lumen of the ERGIC
  (step 5). Matured viruses are released via transport from the TGN to the cell surface
  (step 6). Chloroquine directly inhibits endosomal function and likely indirectly
  affects the secretory pathway via perturbing the interface between the endosome
  and TGN, resulting in inhibition of viral endosomal release, replication, assembly,
  and/or release to achieve clinical benefit.
