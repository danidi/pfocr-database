caption: Dynamic equilibrium of the O-GlcNAcylation process. UDP-GlcNAc with the sugar
  moiety attached via α-O-glycosidic bond to the UDP is produced in the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway and subsequently attached to serine/threonine of protein substrates
  by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) via O-β-glycosidic bond. It is removed by O-GlcNAcase
  (OGA), and the GlcNAc formed after the OGA reaction re-enters the hexosamine pathway.
