caption: Trp deficiency is sensed by the integrated stress kinase GCN2 that inhibits
  eIF-2α and alters translation. Through a distinct pathway, the lack of Trp sufficiency
  causes mTOR to be inactivated, leading to autophagy via LC3 de-repression and translational
  blockade via S6 kinase inactivation. D-1MT acts as a peculiar mimetic of Trp in
  the sufficiency pathway, thereby functionally reversing the effects of IDO on mTOR.
  The figure is modified from Metz et al. OncoImmunology 1, 1460–1468 (2012).
