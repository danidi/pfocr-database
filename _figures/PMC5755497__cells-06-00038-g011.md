  within red nodes and those down-regulated are displayed within green nodes. The
  intensity of the color in a node indicates the degree of up-(red) or down-(green)
  regulation. The shapes of the nodes reflect the functional class of each gene product:
  transcriptional regulator (horizontal ellipse), transmembrane receptor (vertical
  ellipse), enzyme (vertical rhombus), cytokine/growth factor (square), kinase (inverted
  triangle) and complex/group/other (circle). An orange line indicates predicted upregulation,
  whereas a blue line indicates predicted downregulation. A yellow line indicates
  expression being contradictory to the prediction. Gray line indicates that direction
  of change is not predicted. Solid or broken edges indicate direct or indirect relationship,
  respectively.'
