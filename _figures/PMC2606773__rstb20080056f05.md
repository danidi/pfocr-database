caption: Serine pathway (assimilation of formaldehyde) is used by some chemolithoautotrophs,
  for example several methanotrophs. Methanotrophic bacteria oxidize methane and methanol
  to formaldehyde that condenses with glycine to form serine that can be assimilated
  to form intermediates of the central metabolic pathways. During this stage, phosphoenolpyruvate
  is carboxylated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase to form oxaloacetate. The intermediate
  compounds are then used for biosynthesis. The net balance of this cycle is the fixation
  of 2 mol of formaldehyde and 1 mol of CO2 into 1 mol of 3-phosphoglycerate, which
  is used for biosynthesis, at the expense of 2 mol of ATP and the oxidation of 2 mol
  of NAD(P)H.
