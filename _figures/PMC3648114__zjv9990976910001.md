caption: HPV16 binds to heparin sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on either the epithelial
  cell surface or the basement membrane or through laminin-332 on the ECM. Epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR)
  may also become activated at this time through HSPG/growth factor HPV16 complexes
  and may initiate intracellular signaling cascades that include the activation of
  the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. After binding to HSPGs, the virion
  undergoes a conformational change that is facilitated by cyclophilin B (CyPB), which
  exposes more amino acids of the N terminus of L2. Subsequently, HPV16 binds to α6
  integrin, which initiates a second intracellular signaling cascade. After undergoing
  conformational changes and signaling, the HPV16 capsid binds to A2t. Upon HPV binding
  to the A2t, clathrin-, caveolin-, lipid raft-, flotillin-, cholesterol-, and dynamin-independent
  endocytosis of HPV16 is triggered. HPV16-induced PI3K activation may then be involved
  in vesicle closure and actin scission. Tetraspanins are hypothesized to be involved
  in forming an enriched membrane domain that stabilizes connections between HPV16-associated
  molecules. Therefore, as opposed to a sequential handoff of the virion from one
  receptor to another, we hypothesize that a receptor complex coalesces and includes
  HSPGs, CyPB, α6 integrin, tetraspanins, EGFR, and A2t.
