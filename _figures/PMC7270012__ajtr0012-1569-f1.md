caption: The immune-regulatory role of L. reuteri in IBD. L. reuteri provides indole
  derivatives of dietary Trp, such as indole-3-lactic acid, which activate AhR and
  lead to the down-regulation of Thpok and subsequent reprogramming of CD4+ IELs into
  DPIELs. The R2lc and 2010 strains of L. reuteri activated AhR through the cluster
  of polyketone synthase (PKS), a pathway that is unrelated to Trp metabolism. Activation
  of AhR promotes the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22), which enhances the innate
  immune response by inducing production of antimicrobial peptides (Reg3-lectins)
  to fight off intestinal pathogens and to protect intestinal tissues from damage
  due to inflammation by increasing the expression of tight junction proteins.
