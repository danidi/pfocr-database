caption: Signals from the cell membrane either activate or inhibit the Hippo pathway
  depending on the cellular of tissue context and upstream regulators. YAP and TAZ
  (transcriptional co-activator with a PDZ-binding domain) co-activate TEAD (TEA domain
  family members) transcription factor target genes. The Hippo core (gray shade) molecules
  function as regulators of cellular location, abundance and activity of YAP/TAZ through
  different mechanisms including direct phosphorylation by the Ser/Thr LATS kinases
  (large tumor suppressor; Drosophila Warts). Phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ controls
  cytoplasmic retention via 14-3-3 interaction or degradation, thus reducing transcriptional
  activity of YAP/TAZ. MST1/2 (STE20-like protein kinase 1/2) are the homologs of
  Drosophila Hippo that provided the name for the pathway. SAV1 (Salvador family)
  are WW domain-containing proteins, MOB1/2 is a kinase activator. In addition to
  the above regulation, YAP can be sequestrated by CRBs (crumbs family members) in
  a complex with AMOT (angiomotin).GPCR: G-protein-coupled receptor.
