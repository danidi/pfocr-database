caption: Proposed mechanism of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuropathologies in
  Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD-associated microbiome composition has increased abundance
  of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) producing bacteria, including Bacteroides. LPS stimulates
  enteric microglia to produce Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and Tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF)-α, which induces the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) pathway, therefore upregulating
  expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Similarly, LPS stimulates the vagus nerve,
  activating microglia in the brain, thereby promoting neuroinflammation. LPS is able
  to translocate from the gastrointestinal tract to the circulatory system and stimulate
  astrocytes. The reduction in blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity allows LPS to cross
  the BBB and further promote inflammation in the brain.
