caption: Role of GalGlyNAcPVv in V. vulnificus. (A) Gene cluster containing the vv_1091
  gene in the genomic sequence of V. vulnificus CMCP6. The loci involved in LNB metabolism
  are indicated by bold type. (B) Predicted metabolic pathway for LNB in V. vulnificus.
  Proteins encoded by the genes in the gene cluster shown in panel A are indicated
  by bold type. One-step and multistep reactions in the metabolism are indicated by
  solid and dotted arrows, respectively. The question mark indicates a step not predicted
  by the annotations.
