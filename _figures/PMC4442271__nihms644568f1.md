caption: The initiation and resolution of inflammation is regulated by numerous lipid
  mediators. Upon injury or insult, PLA2 cleaves membrane phospholipids to yield arachidonic
  acid derived prostaniods and leukotriens, which induce vasodilation and act as recruiting
  chemokines for infiltrating leukocyte. Prostaglandin (PG)E2 and 15Δ-PGJ2 may also
  act as pro-resolving mediators, initiating the production of specialized pro-resolving
  mediators (SPMs) though induction of 15-lipoxygenase (LO) expression. Lipoxins (LXs)
  are also generated in a trans-cellular manner involving neutrophils, plateles and
  resident tissue cells, such as epithelial cells. LO thus transforms AA into 15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
  acid (HETE) and subsequently LXA4 or LXB4. Aspirin may also induce production of
  subsequently epi-LXs by acetylates cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and shifting its activity
  from that of an endoperoxidase to a lipoxygenase, yielding 15-HETE and 15-epi-LXA4
  or 15-epi-LXB4 though the action of 5-LO. ω-3 PUFA may also give rise to pro-resolving
  lipid mediators. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is converted by cytochrome P450 or
  acetylated COX-2 into 18R-HEPA, which can be further transformed by enzymatic epoxidation
  and 5-LO in leukocytes to form E series resolvins (RvE). Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
  may be converted into D series resolvins (RvD) by the sequential activation of 15-LO
  or acetylated COX-2 into 17R-HDHA, which is then transformed by enzymatic epoxidation
  and 5-LO to form D series resolvins (RvD). Protectins are similarly to resolvins
  generated from DHA, but via a separate pathway involving 15-LO and enzymatic epoxydation
  and hydrolysis, where 17S-H(p)-DHA serves as the intermediate product. MΦ mediator
  in resolving inflammation (maresin) are in human cells generated from DHA by a 12-LO,
  which forms 14S-HDHA. This product is then further modified into maresins by epoxidation
  and hydrolysis.
