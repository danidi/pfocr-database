  A. Wsc1 is a cell wall integrity (CWI) sensor in yeast. Features shared by all five
  known CWI sensors are the presence of a head group, which is a cysteine-rich domain
  for Wsc1, a highly mannosylated serine/threonine-rich (STR) domain, a transmembrane
  domain and a short cytosolic tail, which interacts directly with the GDP/GTP exchange
  factor Rom1/2. The latter activates the small GTPase Rho1. Rho1-GTP then interacts
  with protein kinase C, which in turn activates a MAPK signalling cascade leading
  to changes in the expression of genes controlling cell cycle progression and cell
  wall deposition and remodelling. The STR domain acts a Hookean spring, the elastic
  stretching of which, as a result of cell wall deformation, leads to the activation
  of the signalling pathway. Cell wall deformation also promotes the clustering of
  the Wsc1 sensor, which enhances the signalling capacity of the system (modified
  from ). B. Mechanical activation of latent Transforming Growth Factor (TGF) β in
  animal fibroblast cells. TGF-ß1 is secreted as a homodimer together with its latency-associated
  propeptide (LAP), which is cleaved in the trans-Golgi, but remains non-covalently
  attached also after secretion (). This association keeps TGF-ß1 in a latent state.
  The LAP domain dimer is, with one end, covalently attached (disulfide bonds) to
  a 120–160 kDa latent TGF-β-binding protein (LTBP-1 in fibroblasts), which is part
  of the ECM, and with its opposite end, connected to the actin cytoskeleton, since
  it associates, through its RGD sequence, with αν integrins. In the presence of a
  compliant ECM, actin-myosin contraction will not induce a conformation change in
  the LAP and TGFβ remains latent (left panel). In the presence of a stiff ECM, however,
  a strain-induced conformational change of the LAP domain will occur, which triggers
  the release of active TGF-ß1 and te activation of its receptor (adapted from ).
