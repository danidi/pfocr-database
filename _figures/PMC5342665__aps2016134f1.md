caption: Steps in the LDLR metabolic pathway. After LDL binds to the LDLR at the cell
  membrane, the LDLR-LDL complex undergoes endocytosis. Within the endosome, LDL dissociates
  from the LDLR. The LDL then enters the lysosome where it is degraded, and the LDLR
  is recycled to the cell surface. The LDLR metabolic pathway under PCSK9 regulation.
  Secreted PCSK9 binds to the LDLR at the cell surface, and the PCSK9-LDLR complex
  is endocytosed, thereby promoting its lysosomal degradation. PCSK9-targeted therapies
  include mAbs, adnectins, and mimetic peptides (which block the interaction between
  PCSK9 and the LDLR), CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, antisense oligonucleotides
  (ASOs), siRNAs and small molecules (which inhibit PCSK9 expression), and drugs that
  interfere with PCSK9 secretion from the ER.
