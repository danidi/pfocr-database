caption: Diagram depicting hypothetical mechanisms by which the polycystins directly
  affect gene transcription and regulate the cell cycle. PC1 binds and activates JAK2
  in a PC2-dependent manner. JAK2 is a member of the Janus kinase family of tyrosine
  kinases which in turn phosphorylates and activates the transcription factor STAT-1,
  upregulating p21waf (a cell cycle inhibitor), inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase
  2 (Cdk2), and inducing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1. PC2 binds Id2, a helix-loop-helix
  protein, and prevents its translocation to the nucleus and suppression of p21waf,
  thus preventing Cdk2 activation and cell cycle progression. The C-terminal tail
  of PC1 can be cleaved and migrate to the nucleus. Two non-mutually exclusive models
  have been suggested. In the first, PC1 normally sequesters the transcription factor
  STAT6 on cilia thereby preventing its activation. Interruption of luminal fluid
  flow (e.g. after ureteral clamping or renal injury) triggers the cleavage of the
  final 112 amino acids. This p112 fragment interacts with STAT6 and the co-activator
  P100 and stimulates transcriptional activity. In the second, mechanical stimulation
  of the primary cilium normally triggers the cleavage and release of the entire C
  terminal tail (p200). This p200 fragment contains a nuclear localization motif,
  binds β-catenin in the nucleus, and inhibits its ability to activate T-cell factor-dependent
  gene transcription, a major effector of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.
