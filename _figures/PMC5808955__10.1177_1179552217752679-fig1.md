caption: 'Schematic overview of the effects of Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745
  on enzymes within the small intestine. Even though not all mechanistic details are
  understood, the following mechanism appears plausible from the published literature:
  the yeast provides increased levels of polyamines, which are taken up by a polyamine
  transport system (PTS) and/or function as signalling molecules (other signals are
  also possible). As a result, translation, transcription, and kinase activities are
  activated, thereby inducing an increased expression of digestive enzymes, uptake
  transporter SGLT1 (sodium glucose cotransporter 1), and IAP (intestinal alkaline
  phosphatase) (likely, other targets of induction remain to be discovered). Polyamines
  are also generally observed to induce growth. One observed negative feedback mechanism
  is the increase in the polyamine degradation enzyme DAO (diamine oxidase). In addition,
  the yeast provides enzymes of its own, which help digest the supplied food, for
  the profit of both yeast and host. The combined effects will lead to an improved
  nutrient absorption, as well as to a faster adaptation towards a normal situation,
  in case that the small intestine is perturbed by disease or other causes for nutrient
  malabsorption. As an extra effect, the S. boulardii CNCM I-745-induced increase
  in alkaline phosphatase activities will inactivate toxins and reduce inflammatory
  signals. Abbreviations and brief explanations: APN, aminopepedidase N (alanyl aminopeptidase,
  neutral brush border aminopeptidase, N-aminopeptidase) – digests peptides generated
  from hydrolysis of proteins by gastric and pancreatic proteases, upregulated in
  response to S. boulardii .,DAO, diamine oxidase – degrades histamine as well as
  polyamines, is released from the intestinal mucosa via vesicles, and carried to
  the circulation by the lymphatics. As a negative feedback, DAO is upregulated in
  response to S. boulardii.IAP, intestinal alkaline phosphatase – dephosphorylates
  lipopolysaccharides derived from the cell wall of gram negative bacteria, preventing
  transmigration of bacteria across the epithelium; dephosphorylates other potentially
  pro-inflammatory ligands; upregulated in response to S. boulardii.GRB2-SHC-CrkII-Ras-GAP-Raf-ERK1,2
  – proteins of the MAPK pathway, including adaptor proteins SHC, CrkII, and GRB2,
  linking a signal receptor to a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (SOS). A signal
  results in an activated ERK dimer, which regulates targets in the cytosol and also
  translocates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates transcription factors, which
  in turn regulate gene expression, most likely including genes involved in upregulation
  of enzyme activity. The MAPK pathway gets activated in response to S. boulardii.,LPH,
  lactase-phlorizin hydrolase – digestive enzyme with 2 domains, one splitting, among
  others, lactose, cellobiose o-nitrophenyl- β-glucopyranoside, and o-nitrophenyl-
  β-galactopyranoside, and the other splitting, among others, phlorizin, β-glycopyranosylceramides,
  and m-nitrophenyl- β-glucopyranoside. Upregulated in response to S. boulardii.,,MGA,
  maltase-glucoamylase – α-glucosidase containing 2 domains with differing substrate
  specificity on maltose/starch and glucose oligomers with α(1→4) bonds; upregulated
  in response to S. boulardii.,,,SI, sucrase-isomaltase – α-glucosidase containing
  2 domains with overlapping substrate specificity, hydrolysing oligomers with (1→6)-α-d-glucosidic
  linkages including sucrose; upregulated in response to S. boulardii.,SGLT1, sodium
  glucose cotransporter – transports glucose into enterocytes while exporting sodium;
  upregulated in response to S. boulardii.PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase.PTS,
  polyamine transport system.'
