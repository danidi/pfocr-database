caption: 'Comparison of the biosynthesis and accumulation of phenolic compounds between
  ‘Clementine’ and ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit. A simplified polyphenol biosynthetic pathway,
  starting from phenylalanine, was constructed on the basis of ‘omics’ data from previous
  studies in Citrus (; ;  and on the basis of the metabolite patterns found in the
  flavedo of ‘Clementine’ and ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit. Accordingly, the compounds not
  quantifiable in these tissues were deliberately omitted. This simplified scheme
  does not display all possible routes between metabolites. For example, luteolin
  can also be formed via eriodictyol, which is not presented here. Arrows indicate
  one or several enzymatic steps of the pathway. Dotted arrows represent enzymes that
  are uncharacterized in Citrus. For the sake of clarity, details about enzymes are
  omitted within the classes of phenolic compounds. The contents of quantifiable end-products
  are presented. Concentrations of the indicated metabolites were measured in the
  flavedo of ripe fruits using the method developed in this study. ‘Clementine’ is
  represented in orange and ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit in purple. Contents are expressed
  in mg kg–1 dry wt and are means (n = 5 biological replicates) ± s.d. Different letters
  indicate significant differences between ‘Clementine’ and ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit
  at α = 0·05. The contents of phenolic compounds are also expressed in µmol phenylalanine
  equivalent per g dry wt. The sum is equivalent to the total amount of phenylalanine
  contained in soluble phenolic compounds. The proportions of each class were determined
  in relation to this total amount of phenolic rings and are shown close to the corresponding
  arrows in orange for ‘Clementine’ and in purple for ‘Star Ruby’. This information
  highlights the rate-limiting nodes/enzymes in the pathway. For example, in ‘Clementine’
  flavones, flavanones and flavonols represent almost 100 % of the total phenolic
  rings (11·5 µmol g–1 dry wt), whereas in ‘Star Ruby’ grapefruit this percentage
  is around 50 %. Abbreviations for the main enzymes: CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI,
  chalcone isomerase; C2′H, p-coumaroyl CoA 2′-hydroxylase; C4H, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase;
  4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FNS, flavone synthase;
  MS, marmesin synthase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; PT, prenyltransferase;
  PS, psoralen synthase.'
