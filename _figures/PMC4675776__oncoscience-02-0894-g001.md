caption: 'A. In mammary epithelial organoid culture, augmented PAR6 expression promotes
  MAPK activity whereas diminished expression induces PI3K/AKT pathway. This duality
  could explain why PAR6 up- and downregulation both result in a similar output: promotion
  of cell proliferation and corruption of the neighborhood suppression of proliferation.
  B. However, the tumorigenic processes strongly favor PAR6B upregulation and PAR6G
  downregulation, which difference is more likely related to mechanisms of tumorigenesis
  than to biological capacity of different PAR6 proteins.'
