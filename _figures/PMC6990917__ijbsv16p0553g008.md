caption: The mechanism of the protective effect of fenofibrate against diabetic nephropathy.
  Oxidative stress is a key pathogenic factor in the development of DN. Under diabetic
  conditions, glucose metabolism is impaired and excessive amounts of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) are produced, which accumulate in the kidney and induce oxidative
  stress. Oxidative stress causes renal cellular injury and apoptosis, followed by
  inflammation and fibrosis, which ultimately leads to renal dysfunction. Our previous
  study showed that FF-induced renal protection from diabetes is mediated through
  an upregulation of FGF21, and this in turn stimulates Akt/GSK-3β/Fyn-mediated activation
  of the Nrf2 anti-oxidative pathway. The present study reveals that the protective
  effect of FF/FGF21 on DN is dependent on Akt2. The activation of the Akt2/GSK-3β/Fyn
  pathway increases the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 by inhibiting the nuclear accumulation
  of Fyn, and induces antioxidant gene expression. However, AMPK activation can also
  alleviate the metabolic defects, and both pathways prevent renal oxidative stress,
  inflammation, and remodeling.
