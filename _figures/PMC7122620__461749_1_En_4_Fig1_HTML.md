caption: (a) Schematic of the structure and genomic pathway of the Steroid Receptor
  (SR) activated upon binding of the ligand (e.g., hormone). Binding of the ligand
  causes activation of the HSP-90-bound SR that undergoes nuclear translocation, dimerization,
  and then binds to the hormone response elements (HRE) by the action of cofactors/coactivators,
  thus resulting into transactivation and transcription of the target genes. The enlarged
  view of the SR reveals different structural domains, namely, N-terminal domain (NTD),
  DNA-binding domain (DBD), Hinge region (H), and ligand-binding domain (LBD), wherein
  each domain is capped by N-termini and C-termini amino acid residues. Presence of
  NLS, AF-1, and AF-2 domains has also been indicated. (b) Schematic representation
  of GnRHR and intracellular pathway activated on binding of GnRH. Binding of the
  ligand activates the receptor. The latter binds to GTP-linked proteins, or G-proteins.
  Gαq/11, a subunit of G-proteins, activates phospholipase C, which then hydrolyzes
  phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol triphosphate (IP3) and
  diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC), further leading to cascade
  of intracellular events, operating through activation of phospholipase A2, ultimately
  leading to Gonadotropin biosynthesis and release
