caption: Two models of the signaling pathway of agrin. The first step in the signaling
  pathway is the activation of the MuSK receptor tyrosine kinase by agrin. The subsequent
  tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR is dependent on MuSK activation. The results
  presented here are consistent with two models. (1) The intracellular calcium-regulated
  step occurs downstream of AChR phosphorylation. (2) The AChR phosphorylation is
  on a pathway parallel to (but not necessarily required for) agrin-induced AChR clustering.
  See Discussion for details.
