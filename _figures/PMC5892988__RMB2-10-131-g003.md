caption: Roles of the BMP system in steroidogenesis and mitogenesis in growing follicles.
  FSH activates estradiol and progesterone production through the cAMP‐to‐PKA pathway
  in granulosa cells in the ovary. FSH simultaneously stimulates MAPKs such as ERK
  and p38 pathways, leading to pathway‐specific modulation of FSH‐induced steroidogenesis.
  In oocytes, BMP‐15 ligands are synthesized as large precursor molecules, which are
  dimerized and cleaved by proteolytic processing to produce mature BMP‐15 proteins.
  BMP‐15 inhibits FSH receptor expression, while BMP‐6 suppresses adenylate cyclase
  activity, both of which result in reduction of progesterone production. BMP‐2 and
  ‐4 activate FSH‐induced p38, leading to stimulation of estradiol production. BMP‐7
  inhibits FSH‐induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, leading to upregulation of estradiol
  production since ERK1/2 activation is directly linked to inhibition of estradiol.
  In addition to the regulation of steroidogenesis by granulosa cells, oocytes and/or
  oocyte‐derived factors facilitate FSH‐to‐MAP kinase and BMP‐to‐Smad signaling activity
  through oocyte‐granulosa cell communication. Oocyte‐derived BMP‐15 also stimulates
  granulosa cell mitosis and Kit ligand expression. Kit ligand acts through c‐kit
  on the surface of oocytes to inhibit BMP‐15 expression, forming a negative feedback
  loop. Kit ligand‐to‐c‐kit signaling also increases granulosa cell mitosis, presumably
  by stimulating oocytes to secrete some unidentified mitogens
