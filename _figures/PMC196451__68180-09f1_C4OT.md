caption: Biosynthetic pathways affected in bp-9 seedlings. Genes  up-regulated in
  bp-9 are boxed in shades of green; genes  down-regulated in bp-9 are boxed in red.
  Genes not affected or absent  in the oligonucleotide array are boxed in white. The
  arrows indicate the  direction of the enzymatic reaction identified by EC number.
  The genes  At-ASN1, GDH2, CYP710A2, and TRYT belong to other pathways  but share
  common substrates with the lignin pathway. Complete names for the  genes differentially
  expressed are reported in   and Supplementary Table  1.
