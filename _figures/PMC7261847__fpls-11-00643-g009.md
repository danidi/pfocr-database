caption: Contrasting stomatal development in Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrium
  patens. In Arabidopsis, asymmetric entry (A), spacing (B), and amplifying (C) divisions
  are regulated by SPEECHLESS (SPCH) and ICE1/SCREAM (SCRM) or SCRM2. In all three
  types of divisions, SPCH activity is under phospho-regulatory control, and this
  occurs via the MAPK pathway. The MAPK pathway facilitates signals from the plasma
  membrane exterior to be transduced into the nucleus. ERECTA family proteins [particularly
  ERECTA (ER)], modulated by TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) convey such signals. If the EPIDERMAL
  PATTERNING FACTOR (EPF), EPF2 successfully binds to ER then stomatal lineage entry
  is inhibited. If the EPF-like (EPFL) peptide, EPFL9 binds, the MAPK pathway activity
  is reduced, allowing the SPCH-SCRM/2 heterodimers to initiate asymmetric divisions
  from meristemoid mother cells (MMC), leading to new meristemoid formation [see red
  cell in entry (A) or spacing (B) division], or the renewal of an existing meristemoid
  [see red cell in amplifying (C) divisions]. SPCH also upregulates EPF2 and thus
  regulates its own activity through negative feedback. Later MUTE, together with
  SCRM/2, orchestrates the advancement of the meristemoid to GMC, and then participates
  in the GMC division. EPF1 inhibits MUTE activity and EPFL9 promotes it, again via
  elements of a MAPK pathway. What drives EPF1 expression is still unclear. Lastly,
  FAMA together with SCRM/2 permits correct GC identity and this stage is also governed
  by various elements of the MAPK pathway. Typically EPF2 is secreted from meristemoids
  during early stomatal development, primarily to restrict SPCH activity in neighboring
  stomatal lineage cells [see translucent blue circles around meristemoids in panels
  (A–C)]. EPF1 is secreted later during the meristemoid to GMC transition, and continuing
  into GMC division [see translucent light blue circles around GMCs in panels (A,B)].
  (D) PpSMF1 and PpSCRM1 both facilitate stomatal lineage advancement to an early
  GMC. This may also include promoting early GMC pre-cursor fate. PpTMM promotes the
  initial formation of GMCs, and PpEPF1 may also be involved by preventing initial
  cells from obtaining early GMC fate. These signals are probably conveyed by a number
  of PpERECTA proteins () and a MAPK pathway. PpEPF1 function could normally take
  place once an initial GMC has been specified, although further work is required
  to establish whether this is the case. Downstream of the early GMC formation it
  is unclear as to what, if any, roles PpSMF1 and/or PpSCRM1/2/3/4 undertake. All
  lines which are dashed are hypothesized mechanisms as are the functions of proteins
  which are followed by question marks. (E) Secondary patterning occurs when early
  GMC cells may secrete PpEPF1 (blue circles) to signal to nearby early GMC pre-cursor.
  PpTMM, on the early GMC pre-cursor (green sticks), probably transduces PpEPF1 signal
  and thereby preventing adjacent early GMCs from forming. (F) GMC asymmetric spacing
  divisions occur when two early GMCs concurrently arise next to each other, maybe
  from cells which concurrently differentiate from GMC pre-cursor origin. PpEPF1 may
  be secreted by both early GMCs, and via PpTMM signaling assists in the orientation
  of division so that GMCs are not touching. The spacing division can then unfold
  and cellular organelles move in a polar fashion to the distal part of the dividing
  cell. This will eventually lead to GMCs which are separated via a spacer cell (SPC).
  PpEPF1 presence with PpTMM ensures these processes occur in the correct orientation.
  It is unclear whether the new SC has the capability to re-enter the stomatal lineage.
