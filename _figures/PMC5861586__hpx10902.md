caption: 'Biological pathways whereby PM2.5 promotes cardiovascular events. Inhaled
  PM2.5 deposit deep within pulmonary tissues (i.e., alveoli) and interact/activate
  local cells (e.g., resident macrophages, dendritic cells, alveolar/endothelial cells)
  and modify endogenous structures (e.g., cell membranes, surfactant lipids, antioxidants).
  Mediators of oxidative stress (e.g., free radicals) directly generated by particulate
  compounds (metals, organic species) or secondarily produced (e.g., modified phospholipids)
  by activated cellular enzyme systems (e.g., NADPH oxidase) can instigate a local
  inflammatory response. Several innate immune pathways may be important in coordinating
  this response such as via activated toll-like receptors (TLR). In pathway 1, the
  inhaled particles and/or oxidative stress impact a variety of afferent nerves (e.g.,
  transient receptor potential receptors [TRP]) and rapidly alter central nervous
  system (CNS) autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance typically favoring sympathetic
  (SNS) activity over parasympathetic (PSNS) nervous system activity. In pathway 2,
  numerous mediators of inflammation and oxidative stress generated in the lungs (e.g.,
  cytokines, activated immune cells, oxidized lipids) “spill-over” into the systemic
  circulation and thereafter carry this danger signal to remote cardiovascular tissues.
  In hypothetical pathway 3, nanoparticles (10–30 nm) or particulate components penetrate
  lung barriers and are carried within immune cells or lipoproteins or directly reach
  the systemic circulation. Harmful chemicals (organic carbon species, metals) deposit
  into cardiovascular tissues and elicit inflammatory-oxidative stress responses without
  the need for the signal to be indirectly transmitted via pathway 2. Abbreviations:
  BP, blood pressure; HPAA, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis; PM, particulate matter;
