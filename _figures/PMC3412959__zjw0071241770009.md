caption: Model for NP1 level modulation by glucotoxicity in β-cells. A, GSK3 is an
  intermediate in both insulin/IGF1 and Wnt pathways. On the one hand, GSK3 inactivation
  by Akt-mediated phosphorylation leads to the activation of glycogen synthase for
  glucose storage. It induces also anti-apoptotic signaling and the maintenance of
  β-cell function notably through the action of IPF1/PDX1. On the other hand, GSK3
  inactivation by the Wnt pathway induces an accumulation of β-catenin and therefore
  activates tumorogenesis. In β-cell, NP1 expression might be related to GSK3 activity.
  B, increased level of glucose might induce Akt deactivation by a decrease of its
  phosphorylation state. This loss of function would lead to a decrease of GSK3 phosphorylation
  state, corresponding to an increase of its kinase activity. This has an impact on
  several genes and especially induces an up-regulation of the NP1 level, potentially
  participating in induction of cell apoptosis.
