caption: 'McArdle disease Scheme. McArdle disease, also referred to as myophosphorylase
  deficiency or type V glycogen storage disease, is a recessive inherited disorder
  characterized by an inability to metabolize glycogen due to the absence of a functional
  myophosphorylase (PYGM). Patients lack sufficient glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) monomers
  needed for glycolysis and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). This results
  in lower ATP and, consequently, lower muscle contraction, as well as in lower post-translational
  modifications by O-GlcNAcylation in comparison to normal conditions. PTM: post-translational
  modification; O-GlcNAc, β-linked N-acetylglucosamine.'
