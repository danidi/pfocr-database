caption: 'There are two routes to generate the intracellular cysteine in cells: one
  is the cystine import though SLC7A11 and the other one is the transsulfuration pathway.
  Under basal conditions, the cystine import plays the dominate role in the GSH precursor
  cysteine generation. When the cystine import is blocked by erastin, the DJ-1 preserved
  transsulfuration pathway still could provide essential cysteine synthesis (refer
  to DJ-1 high with ferroptotic stress). DJ-1 depletion can markedly inhibit GSH levels
  only when the cystine import is blocked (refer to DJ-1 low with ferroptotic stress).
  The DJ-1 KD distinctly decreases Hcy levels by impairing SAHH activity via enhancing
  its interaction with AHCYL1. Decreased level of Hcy subsequently causes the depletion
  of GSH and eventually enhances ferroptotic cell death.'
