caption: After overexpression of αvβ3 integrin, CD61 interacted physically with TβR-II,
  thereby leading to its phosphorylation by Src. The activation of TβR-II phosphorylated
  and promoted Smad2/3 transportation to the nucleus. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 combined
  with the promoters of several differentiation-related genes, such as CD61, CD49f,
  PRDM1, PRDM14 and SOX2, which resulted in the regulation of their expression.
