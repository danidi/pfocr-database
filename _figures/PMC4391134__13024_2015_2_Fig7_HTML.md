caption: Diagram of potential APOE4 -induced decrease in synapse-related proteins
  and disruption of NMDAR-mediated signaling, resulting in impaired learning and memory.
  With APOE4, the levels of key post-synaptic proteins are reduced, including the
  subunits of NMDAR. NMDAR signaling via activation by phosphorylation of CaMK-II
  and CREB to increase expression of BDNF is also disrupted by APOE4, compromising
  synaptic function and impairing learning and memory. Previous work has demonstrated
  that apoE isoform-specific effects on Aβ clearance and interactions with apoE receptors
  likely play a role in this process at several levels. Soluble levels of Aβ are lower
  with apoE3 and inversely correlated with levels of apoE3/Aβ complex [], suggesting
  a potential clearance mechanism. LRP mediates Aβ uptake by neurons [,], and, in
  vitro, Aβ clearance is impaired with apoE4 [], consistent with a greater accumulation
  of intraneuronal Aβ [] compared to apoE3. For ApoER2, ligand recycling is impaired
  with apoE4 compared to apoE3 []. Loss of ApoER2 reduces Reelin binding, thus reducing
  activation of NMDAR via signaling by the Src family kinases [,], leading to decreased
  synaptic function and therefore decreased learning and memory.
