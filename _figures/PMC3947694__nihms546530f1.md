caption: Biosynthesis and structure of CL. The pathway, genes (red) and gene products
  responsible for CL synthesis in yeast mitochondria are shown (; ). The pathway in
  higher eukaryotes is essentially the same and is carried out by homologous genes
  and gene products. The CLD1 gene product (CL specific deacylase) initiates the remodeling
  of CL fatty acid chain composition in yeast by forming monolyso-CL (); higher eukaryotes
  utilize multiple deacylases (). The TAZ gene product in both yeast and mammalian
  cells is responsible for completing the remodeling of nascent CL by transferring
  fatty acids to monolyso-CL from other phospholipids (). The result is highly unsaturated
  forms of CL as represented by one of the structures found in yeast and mammalian
  cells. The (*) in red indicates the three chiral centers of naturally occurring
  CLs; carbon of the central glycerol is only a chiral center if the two adjacent
  phosphatidyl moieties have different fatty acid compositions. The glycerol backbone
  (green) is indicated. The lower figure depicts the hydrogen-bonding between the
  central free hydroxyl of CL and the phosphate residues creating a proton sink in
  the lipid bilayer and raising the pKa of one phosphate near neutrality (). DAG denotes
  the diacylglycerol lipid domain.
