caption: Indole-3-Acetaldoxime Is the Metabolic Branch Point between Indole Glucosinolates
  and IAA Biosynthesis.In rnt1-1, the pathway into indole glucosinolates through CYP83B1
  is blocked, which leads to accumulation of IAA and plants with high IAA phenotype.
  Conversely, in CYP83B1 overexpression lines, additional indole-3-acetaldoxime is
  channeled into indole glucosinolate biosynthesis, which leads to plants with a low
  IAA phenotype and increased indole glucosinolate levels.
