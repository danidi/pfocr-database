caption: Model of amino acid starvation-induced AARE-dependent transcription in human
  cells. In response to amino acid starvation, two pathways are activated. The first
  one is activated by uncharged tRNA and leads to ATF4 induction. The second one involves
  the Gα12 protein and leads to ATF2 phosphorylation.
