caption: Pathway networks. (A) Model of the pathway network. The red circle nodes
  indicate a pathway and the lines represent the interactions between two pathways.
  The strength of the interaction is represented by the thickness of the line, according
  to the mean value of JC and OC. (B) Model of the core pathway network. Red circle
  nodes indicate a pathway and the lines represent the interactions between two pathways
  The strength of the interaction is represented by the thickness of the line according
  to the mean value of JC and OC. JC, Jaccard coefficient; OC, overlap coefficient.
