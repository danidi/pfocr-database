caption: G1/S restriction point alterations and deregulations in BCP-ALL. In contrast
  with the normal cell cycle pathway (Fig. ), Cyclin D:Cdk4,6 complexes except for
  hypo-phosphorylating pRb may also lead the protein to an intermediate phosphorylation
  status (termed “pseudo-hyper-phosphorylated”) which retains the ability to inhibit
  E2F transcription factors, although its phosphorus content is increased. This version
  of the protein is believed to have lost differentiation related functions [], therefore
  its accumulation implies that the cell resides at or beyond the restriction point.
  Only when Cyclin E:Cdk2 and Cyclin A:Cdk1,2 complexes are activated, could the hypo-phosphorylated
  and pseudo-hyper-phosphorylated versions of the protein become hyper-phosphorylated
  and consequently liberate E2F transcription factors. The metabolism-mediated activation
  of these complexes is believed to exhibit differential time-course among patients
  due to differences in metabolism rates
