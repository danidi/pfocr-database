caption: FOXJ1 Is an Essential Component in Signaling Pathways for the Generation
  of Motile CiliaSchematics illustrating the function of FOXJ1 in the generation of
  motile cilia in the NOTCH1- and NOTO-dependent pathway in (A) multiciliated cells
  and (B) the ciliated cells of the embryonic node, respectively. Pathogenic variants
  in MCIDAS and CCNO (marked in green) are known to cause a ciliogenesis defect in
  multiple motile cilia causing a mucociliary clearance disorder referred to as reduced
  generation of multiple motile cilia,  (RGMC).
