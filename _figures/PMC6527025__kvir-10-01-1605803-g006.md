caption: UPR Signaling During Influenza A Virus Infection.Upon IAV infection, BiP
  is released from UPR proteins (e.g. PERK, ATF6, and IRE1) and facilitates their
  activation. IRE1 activation results in the splicing of XBP-1 mRNA in the cytoplasm,
  leading to its nuclear translocation and transcription of UPR target genes. It mediates
  HA degradation by involvement of three class I α-mannosidases EDEM1, EDEM2, and
  ERManI. Upon activation of PERK, eIF2a is phosphorylated and blocks protein synthesis.
  IAV targets eIF2α by inducing P58IPK, then regulates its mRNA translation by PKR-mediated
  and PERK-dependent mechanisms. ATF6 translocates to the Golgi apparatus where it
  is cleaved, then moves to the nucleus and targets ER chaperone genes. IAV targets
  this pathway using MxA.
