caption: A schematic model of AG activity in melanoma cells based on the results shown
  in this study and published previously []. A heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) has been
  shown to control the p65/NF-κB signaling pathway and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  homeostasis, among others. AG inhibits HSP90 activity that is associated with a
  reduction of phospho-p65 levels and expression of NF-κB target genes, including
  VEGF, CXCL8, and CCND1. In this way, AG can affect different cellular programs.
  In turn, AG does not change the levels of BCL-XL and MMP-2, suggesting that regulators
  other than NF-κB play a dominant role in the activation of their expression.
