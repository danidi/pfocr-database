caption: A proposed hypothetical model of the mini-dystrophin reduction effect on
  PLC activity. (A) During depolarization, the activation of DHPRs, followed by calcium
  release from RYRs (described as fast) would also stimulate PLC through Gi protein
  (). The IP3, produced from the PLC activity, reaches IP3Rs from the SR and leads
  to calcium release (slow). (B) The presence of the mini-dystrophin protein would
  repress the activity of PLC via the Gi protein and consequently reduce the slow
  release from IP3 receptors.
