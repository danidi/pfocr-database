caption: Differences of inhibitory effects between homodimeric and heterodimeric IL-35.
  IL-35 signal inhibited the differentiation of effector T-cells (Teffs) by activating
  the intracellular JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Although both homodimeric (EBI3/EBI3
  and p35/p35) and heterodimeric (EBI3/p35) IL-35 were capable of producing iTr35,
  the later showed a maximal suppressive activity by producing iTr35 and blocked the
  proliferation and function of Teffs. CTL, Cytotoxic T lymphocyte; iTr35, IL-35-producing
  Treg cells; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, Signal transducer and activator of transcription.
