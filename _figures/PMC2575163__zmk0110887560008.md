caption: Signaling pathway for proceeding from FosB or ΔFosB/Δ2ΔFosB toward thrombospondin
  1/TGF-β1, which regulates cell-matrix adhesion. Thrombospondin 1/TGF-β1 signaling,
  which may be negatively regulated by Jun/Fos complexes (active AP-1), enhances cell-matrix
  adhesion and up-regulates genes for basement membrane proteins through fosB gene
  expression. ΔFosB and Δ2ΔFosB antagonize not only FosB but also other Fos family
  members (Fos) constituting the major AP-1 complexes with the three Jun proteins
  (Jun), and they may up-regulate the TGF-β1 signaling pathway independent of intrinsic
  AP-1 activity. See details in the text and Supplemental Figure S2. Red represents
  up-regulated genes and blue indicates down-regulated genes.
