caption: a. SnoN promotes axons growth in postmitotic neurons. SnoN associates with
  the transcriptional coactivator p300 to induce transcription of the Ccd1 gene, which
  has a critical role in axon growth. SnoN-induced axon growth is controlled by the
  ubiquitin ligase Cdh1-APC, which is recruited to SnoN by the TGFβ-Smad pathway.
  b. The SnoN isoforms, SnoN1 and SnoN2, have opposing roles in the coordinate regulation
  of neuronal branching and migration. SnoN1 promotes neuronal branching and inhibits
  neuronal migration. SnoN2 inhibits the ability of SnoN1 to control neuronal branching
  and migration. SnoN1 associates with the transcription FOXO1 to repress the expression
  of the DCX gene.
