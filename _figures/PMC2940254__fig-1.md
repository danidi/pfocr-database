caption: In blood endothelial cells, the Notch/CSL signaling pathway regulates cell
  fate decisions by regulating gene expression. The downstream mediators of Notch
  function in endothelial cells are becoming known. Hey1 and Hey2 figure prominently
  in models of Notch function and are directly regulated by Notch/CSL. However, other
  intriguing targets of the Notch signaling pathway consist of genes that encode members
  of the VEGF receptor family. Notch induces VEGFR-3 directly, that is, it functions
  by binding and trans-activating the VEGFR-3 promoter. Notch also suppresses the
  expression of VEGFR-2 and upregulates ephrinB2 via its induction of Hey2. This complex
  relationship is schematized in . How important is VEGF receptor expression for Notch
  function in endothelial cell fate determination steps? This question is currently
  being addressed experimentally and we consider evidence for such regulation in the
  lymphatic vasculature.
