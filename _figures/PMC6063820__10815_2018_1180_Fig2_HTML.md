caption: Maintenance of a quiescent primordial follicle is regulated by Hippo and
  Akt signaling. The Hippo signaling pathway inhibits primordial follicle activation.
  Cells probe the rigidity of their microenvironment and respond through central regulators
  of intracellular contractility (e.g., Rho GTPase and Rho-associated protein kinase
  (ROCK)). (A) An increase in internal stress from environmental rigidity (lightning
  bolt) is likely mechanically mediated through actin by negative growth factors (i.e.,
  macrophage stimulating (MST1/2), salvador 1 (SAV1), and large tumor-suppressor homolog
  (LATS1/2)) that signals to the cell via Rho GTPase and ROCK phosphorylation of yes-associated
  protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), (B)
  inhibiting it from crossing to the nucleus to bind to promoter regions on the DNA
  to promote transcription of growth stimulators. Thus, the Hippo signaling pathway
  appears to utilize internal mechanical stress and associated mechanical signaling
  to maintain the follicle in a quiescent state and inhibit follicular activation.
  (C) Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) dephosphorylates
  activated phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) preventing follicular activation by counteracting the Akt (protein kinase
  B) pathway and allowing forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) transcription factor, an essential
  regulator of follicular quiescence, to maintain the latency period of the follicle.
  The red arrows indicate pathways that are likely active to maintain follicle latency
  while gray arrows signify non-active steps. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase;
  PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 *SUN1/2, transmembrane proteins;
  Nesprin, nuclear envelope spectrin repeat protein.

  description: Maintenance of a quiescent primordial follicle is regulated by Hippo
    and Akt signaling. The Hippo signaling pathway inhibits primordial follicle activation.
    Cells probe the rigidity of their microenvironment and respond through central

    protein kinase (ROCK)). (A) An increase in internal stress from environmental
    rigidity (lightning bolt) is likely mechanically mediated through actin by negative

    Thus, the Hippo signaling pathway appears to utilize internal mechanical stress
