caption: After SE, P2RX7 activation inhibited HSPB1 transactivation via MAPK1/2-mediated
  SP1-T739 phosphorylation. However, P2rx7 deletion or its antagonists impaired this
  inhibitory signaling pathway, which led to sustained HSPB1 expression and ER stress.
  Subsequently, ER stress activated PRKAA1/ULK1-mediated astroglial autophagy. Sustained
  HSPB1 expression also exerted AKT1/GSK3B-mediated SH3GLB1 accumulation, which triggered
  astroglial autophagy. Thus, P2RX7 regulated ER stress and autophagy by the fine-tuning
  of HSPB1 expression in astrocytes
