caption: A simplified view of cytoplasmic 1C folate metabolism. Not all enzymes are
  shown. The reactions in blue supply the 1Cs required for DNA synthesis. The reactions
  in red form part of the folate pathway that produces the methyl donor SAM. A range
  of methyltransferase enzymes catalyze the transfer of the methyl group (CH3) from
  SAM to a number of substrates including DNA, i.e., methylation reactions. SAH is
  an inhibitor of methyltransferase enzymes. MTHFR, methyltetrahydrofolate reductase
  enzyme; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine THF, tetrahydrofolate.
