caption: Topological organization of LacY as a function of membrane lipid composition.
  (a) The topology of LacY initially assembled in E. coli with wild-type phospholipid
  composition is shown. Rectangles define the transmembrane domains (TMs) (), oriented
  with the cytoplasm above the figure. TMs (Roman numerals), extramembrane domains
  [P for periplasmic and C for cytoplasmic as oriented in phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PE)-containing cells], N terminus (NT), and C terminus (CT) are indicated. The
  net charge of each extramembrane domain is indicated next to the domain name. The
  approximate locations of negatively charged (blue) and positively charged (red )
  residues are indicated. (b) A funnel-shaped energy landscape that defines the folding
  pathway of a membrane protein such as LacY in wild-type cells is depicted. The horizontal
  axis ( funnel circumference) represents the conformational space occupied by protein
  as it folds, and the vertical axis represents the internal free energy of a given
  polypeptide conformation. As TMs I–XII fold, they move down the funnel to the lowest
  energy state as defined by the final organization of native LacY. (c) The topology
  of LacY assembled in E. coli cells lacking PE is shown. TMs I–VI are inverted with
  respect to TMs VIII–XII, which still exhibit native topology. TM VII (red ) is exposed
  to the periplasm, resulting in breakage of the salt bridges with TM X and TM XI.
  (d ) A new energy landscape defines the energetics of folding in PE-lacking cells
  of the two halves of LacY with the N-terminal bundle forming a new energy minimum
  separated by a large activation energy, which disconnects it from the native state.
  (e) The topological organization of LacY after synthesis of PE in cells after assembly
  of LacY. All of LacY assumes a native topological organization except the domain
  defined by NT-TM I-P1-TM II. ( f ) The presence of PE raises the energy minimum
  (arrow) of the inverted topology of TM III–VII, resulting in low activation energy
  for a return to the native topology. A large energy barrier remains for TM I flipping
  with a new miniloop structure (TM II) allowing all domains to exist at their respective
  energy minima.
