caption: 'Induction of NLRP3 inflammasome complex by the inorganic crystal HZ. HZ
  induces IL-1β production via the NLRP3/ASC inflammasome: activation of caspase-1
  results in the cleavage of pro-IL-1β. Pro-IL-1β expression is resultant of the TLR4-
  and TNFα-activated NF-κB pathway or the IFNγ-stimulated STAT-1α pathway. The HZ-activated
  NLRP3 inflammasome is dependent on potassium efflux, ROS generation, HZ internalization,
  and cathepsin B activation. HZ internalization and the induction of SRC kinase signaling
  are mediated by lipid rafts. An ITAM-containing receptor could also be the starting
  point of SRC kinase cascade. HZ is internalized within a phagosome-like vesicle
  surrounded by LAMP-1. HZ activation of the SRC kinase Lyn leads to Syk phosphorylation.
  Subsequently, Syk positively modulates cathepsin B activation, which could result
  in the induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome. HZ is also capable of activating the
  NLRP3 inflammasome through PI3 kinase. The involvement of malarial DNA, which can
  adhere to HZ, in the activation of an intracellular receptor and its biological
  relevance are controversial and only reported for dendritic cells, which are present
  in limited numbers in the blood. HZ can interact with a large number of inflammatory-related
  biomarkers found in the circulation of P. falciparum-infected patients. However,
  the effect of these biomarkers on NLRP3 inflammasome activation is still unknown.
  Continuous arrows indicate a positive modulation. Dotted arrows indicate a hypothetical
  effect. Dotted arrows with a question mark indicate an unknown or controversial
  effect.'
