caption: RecA structural model is shown with the two Met residues (Met35 and Met164)
  analyzed in the present work. The RecA partially oxidized form contains a Met164-oxidized
  residue while the RecA-oxidized inactive form contains both Met35- and Met164-oxidized
  residues. The MsrA/B repair pathway allows to maintain the pool of functional RecA
  by repair, and the SOS induction pathway allows to replenish the pool of functional
  RecA by de novo synthesis.
