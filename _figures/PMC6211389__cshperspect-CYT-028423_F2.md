caption: Schematic view of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated type I interferon (IFN)
  gene induction by IFN regulatory factors (IRFs). The presence of RNA or double-stranded
  (ds)DNA in the cytosol triggers host responses via specific cytoplasmic pattern
  recognition receptors (PRRs). The binding of uncapped 5′-triphosphate RNA or dsRNA
  to the helicase domain of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)/melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5 (MDA5) induces the interaction between the caspase activation and recruitment
  domain (CARD) of RIG-I/MDA5 and the CARD-like domain of the adaptor mitochondrial
  antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), which is located on the mitochondrial membrane.
  This receptor–adaptor interaction results in the activation of tumor necrosis factor
  (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-associated nuclear factor [NF]-κB activator
  (TANK)-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK)ε. Activated TBK1
  induces the phosphorylation of the specific serine residues of IRF3 and IRF7. These
  IRFs then translocate into the nucleus and activate the type I IFN genes. NF-κB
  is also activated and involved in type I IFN gene induction. In some cases, IRF5
  or IRF8 participate in this IFN gene-induction pathway. dsDNA such as B-DNA is recognized
  by cGAS, IFI16, DDX41, and DAI. The stimulator of IFN genes (STING) adaptor protein
  on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane signals downstream of these DNA receptors.
  STING provides a scaffold for recruitment of TBK1, which phosphorylates IRF3 leading
  to the activation of type I IFN gene expression.
