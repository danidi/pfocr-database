caption: Depiction of the organization and regulation of the major steroid biosynthetic
  pathways in the small antral follicle of the ovary according to the 2-gonadotropin,
  2-cell model of ovarian steroidogenesis, taken and captioned from [] with permission
  of the Oxford University Press. LH stimulates androgen formation within theca cells
  via the steroidogenic pathway common to the gonads and adrenal glands. FSH regulates
  estradiol biosynthesis from androgen by granulosa cells. Long-loop negative feedback
  of estradiol on gonadotropin secretion does not readily suppress LH at physiological
  levels of estradiol and stimulates LH under certain circumstances. Androgen formation
  in response to LH appears to be modulated by intraovarian feedback to the levels
  of 17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, both of which are activities of CYP type 17A1,
  which is expressed only in theca cells. The relative quantity of androstenedione
  formation via 17OHP (dotted arrow) in the intact follicle is probably small, as
  is the amount of progesterone formed from granulosa cell CYP type 11A activity in
  response to FSH (data not shown). Additionally, 17 HSD2 activity is minor in the
  ovary, and estradiol is primarily formed from androstenedione. Androgens and estradiol
  inhibit (minus signs), and inhibin, insulin and IGF-1 (IGF) stimulate (plus signs)
  17-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities.
