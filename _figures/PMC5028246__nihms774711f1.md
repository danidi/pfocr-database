caption: Amyloid β precursor protein (APP) is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum
  and transported to the cell surface through endosomes via the trans-Golgi network.
  At the cell membranc, APP may undergo either non-amyloidogenic or amyloidgenic processing.
  APP is cleaved by β-, and then γ-secretase (compose of presenilin1 [PS1], Nicastrin,
  anterior pharynx defective-1 protein [APH1], and presenilin enhancer 2 [PEN2]) and
  produced Aβ through amyloidogenic pathway. Aβ peptides form oligomers and eventually
  accumulated into Aβ plaques.
