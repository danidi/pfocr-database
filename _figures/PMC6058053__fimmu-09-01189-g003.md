caption: 'Altered B cell receptor (BCR) and co-receptor signaling promotes increased
  autoreactivity within the naive B cell repertoire. (A) Under homeostatic conditions,
  self-reactive B cells are subjected to both positive and negative selection mechanisms
  as they transit into the naive B cell pool and establish the naive repertoire. Whereas,
  tonic BCR signaling and BCR engagement with self-antigen primarily regulate these
  events, synergy between the BCR and co-receptors fine-tunes the tolerance program
  within a given B cell. Among these co-receptors, B cell activating factor receptor
  (BAFFR) signaling (1) synergizes with BCR signaling during late bone marrow and
  transitional development through a series of complex events, including proximal
  biochemical crosstalk and the downstream transcriptional regulation of both receptor
  and substrate expression. Dual BCR and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (2) is
  mediated by internalization and delivery of self-antigens that contain TLR ligands
  to autophagosomes, which contain endosome-resident TLRs. CD40 signaling (3), which
  is triggered by interaction with CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T cells and possibly other
  cell types, also integrates with the BCR signaling pathway. Although BCR signaling
  can modulate CD40 expression, other biochemical or transcriptional events that affect
  this crosstalk are less well understood. (B) In genetic (or environmental) settings
  that promote an increased risk of developing autoimmunity, the homeostatic signaling
  thresholds are modulated, and self-reactive B cells exhibit greater positive selection,
  and/or reduced negative selection, leading to a naive repertoire that is skewed
  toward autoreactivity. For example, excess amounts of B cell-activating factor (BAFF
  1) in the Baff-transgenic mouse model rescue low-affinity self-reactive B cells
  from negative selection. A similar mechanism has been proposed to exist in individuals
  with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Similarly, in mouse and human settings
  of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS) deficiency (2), hyper-responsive dual BCR and
  TLR signaling promotes the positive selection of transitional B cells with BCRs
  that use a limited subset of genes that encode self-reactive heavy-chain variable
  (VH) domains. Healthy individuals with the autoimmunity-associated variant PTPN22R620W
  (3) exhibit altered BCR and CD40 signaling, and have an enrichment of self-reactive
  BCR specificities within the naive B cell compartment. Although it has not yet been
  definitively demonstrated, it is likely that enhanced positive selection, rather
  than relaxed negative selection, predominantly mediates this change. The thickness
  of the arrows indicates the strength of pathway activation. Abbreviations: MAPK,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase. Reprinted from Ref. () with permission from Springer Nature.'
