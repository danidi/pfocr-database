caption: 'Proposed anti-apoptosis mechanism for UDCA cardioprotection against hypoxia.
  Pertussis toxin does not block the effect of UDCA on caspase-9, neutral SMase expression,
  ROS production, and Hif-1α expression in hypoxia-induced CMs. Beating rate is partially
  inhibited by PTX, suggestive of nonsensitive PTX pathway (pathways independent of
  Gαi-coupled-receptor) involvement. Ursodeoxycholic acid cardioprotection has been
  reported to regulate the activation of survival signaling proteins (ERK 1/2 and
  Akt) and neutral SMase in hypoxia-induced CMs []. UDCA has been shown to downregulate
  caspase-9 protein expression and neutral SMase activity and upregulate phosphorylation
  of ERK 1/2 and Akt via Gαi-independent pathways (red line) to promote cardioprotection
  against the effects of CoCl2. Meanwhile, UDCA has been shown to inhibit Hif-1α,
  ROS production, and caspase-9 protein expressions in CoCl2-induced hypoxia CMs [].
  The data also suggests that UDCA cardioprotection in CoCl2-induced hypoxia could
  be mediated through dependent Gαi pathways on CM beating rate (blue line). GPCR:
  G-protein-coupled receptor; Gαi, Gi alpha subunit is a G protein subunit that inhibits
  cAMP from production; Gβ, G-beta; Gγ, G-gamma; nSMase, neutral sphingomyelinase;
  UDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid; Hif-α, hypoxia inducible factor alpha; Hif-ẞ, hypoxia
  inducible factor beta; ROS, reactive oxygen species; Akt, protein kinase B; ERK,
  extracellular signal regulated kinase; PTX, pertussin toxin.'
