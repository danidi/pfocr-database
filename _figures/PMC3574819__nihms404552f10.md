caption: O6MeG lesions are converted to O6MeG/T mispairs in the first replication
  cycle. Subsequently, members of the MMR pathway, MutSα and MutLα, bind to the O6MeG
  /T mismatch leading to direct activation of various DDR network proteins and, consequently,
  the activation of a transient cell cycle arrest in the first cell cycle. In parallel,
  single-strand DNA (ssDNA) gaps arise due to futile repair attempts by the MMR pathway.
  The formation of these ssDNA gaps is an additional source of (indirect) signal activation
  in the first cell cycle. These gaps persist into the second cell cycle where they
  are encountered by replication forks in the second S-phase. Ultimately, this gives
  rise to stalled replication forks, fork collapse, and DSB formation. Such events
  in turn trigger activation of a second wave of DNA damage signaling. At this time
  we observe an intra-S-phase arrest. Under low dose conditions, cells are able to
  repair/tolerate the damage and proceed successfully through the cell cycle. Under
  high dose conditions, damage ultimately leads to apoptotic cell death out of the
  second S-phase. Proteins that are regulated in the early- and late-phase are indicated
  accordingly. While the majority of proteins are regulated in both the first and
  second cell cycle following MNNG damage, CHK2 and JNK kinase activation occur only
  after cells proceed into their second cell cycle post treatment. The regulation
  of ATR is not monitored directly and therefore appears in parentheses.
