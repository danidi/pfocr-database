caption: Schematic of normal (A) and pathological (B) integrin-based focal adhesion
  signaling. (A) During normal focal adhesion signaling, the binding of integrins
  to their physiological ligands such as extracellular matrix proteins (i.e. fibronectin
  or laminin) or reelin activates various focal adhesion signaling proteins (i.e.
  paxillin, FAK, Src, and PI3K), leading to the activation of the Rac-PAK pathway.
  PAK activates LIMK which phosphorylates cofilin on serine-3. This phosphorylation
  inactivates cofilin, thereby transiently reducing actin dynamics. The engagement
  of normal physiological ligands such as reelin with the integrin/APP/LRP complexes
  (A) simultaneously slows down APP endocytosis, thereby reducing Aβ generation. As
  the binding of Aβ to various integrins is critical to transmit its neurotoxic signals,
  Aβ oligomers may displace normal integrin ligands, thereby transmitting defective
  or aberrant focal adhesion signals, eventually leading to defects in PAK activation.
  In appropriate or reduced PAK signaling fails to activate LIMK, thereby reducing
  cofilin phosphorylation. Under conditions of oxidative stress induced by Aβ oligomers
  or hyperphosphorylated tau, cofilin and 14-3-3ζ is oxidized leading to activation
  of SSH and further activation of cofilin. Oxidized and dephosphorylated cofilin
  translocates into the mitochondria to open up the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore, an event that is required for oxidant-induced cell death. Cofilin translocation
  into mitochondria induces mitochondrial dysfunction, thereby further increasing
  ROS and calcium dysregulation. Calcium dysregulation by Aβ, tau, and/or cofilin
  also activates calcineurin, which then leads to SSH activation and further cofilin
  activation. Activated cofilin can lead to the formation of cofilin-actin rods or
  aggregates, which attracts hyperphosphorylated tau and promote tau pathology. At
  the same time, the binding of RanBP9 to APP/LRP/integrin complexes accelerates APP
  endocytosis and enhances Aβ generation, thereby further propagating Aβ-induced neurotoxic
  signaling.
