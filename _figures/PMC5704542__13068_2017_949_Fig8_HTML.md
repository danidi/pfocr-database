caption: Model for regulation of nitrogen availability response. Our data as well
  as previous microscopy data suggest that the nitrogen depletion plays a role in
  chloroplast structure and metabolism [, , ]. More precisely our data support a two-phase
  acclimation of the chloroplast during N depletion. A first highlight-like response
  due to the depletion of stromal protein and supported by the accumulation of LHCII/PSII
  protein which leads potentially to ROS acclimation, both events could trigger a
  signal for chloroplast degradation as suggested in Arabidopsis []. High phosphorylation
  levels of CP29 at the early stage of N depletion support those data and could be
  implicated in the regulation of Fv/Fm []. The second step consists in the dismantlement
  of the chloroplast from 24 h on. Chloroplast dismantlement might involve the BR
  signaling pathway (see “”). Two protein kinases were shown to play a central role,
  CGK2 and DYRKP. They are connected to central metabolism which shows a clear switch
  to mitochondrial respiration (a process tightly controlled by protein phosphorylation)
  and protein translation (tight control by EIF phosphorylation). Data obtained for
  EIF4B phosphorylation are suggesting a down-regulation of the TOR complex. In this
  model, we propose that the higher phosphorylation levels observed for NNK1, RPS6,
  and ATG13 indicate a possible inhibition of the PP2A branch signaling of the TOR
  pathway by activation of CKIN pathway (CKIN 1, 2, and 3 are the AMPK/SnRK1 orthologs
  in Chlamydomonas as defined in []). This is further suggested by the higher phosphorylation
  level of CDPKK2, as proposed in yeast []. For example, the red-dashed arrow between
  TOR and RPS6 indicate that TOR indirectly and positively regulates RPS6 by phosphorylation.
  ROS is reactive oxygen species; PS is photosystem; LHCII is Light-Harvesting complex-II;
