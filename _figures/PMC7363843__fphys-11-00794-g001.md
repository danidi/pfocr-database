caption: Involvement of the carnitine shuttle in the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway.
  The picture represents a sketch of renal proximal tubule cells. Fatty acids (FA)
  enter the cytosol via CD36. FA are converted in acyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA synthetase
  (ACS) and then transferred to the mitochondrial matrix by the carnitine shuttle
  constituted by carnitine-palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), carnitine-acylcarnitine
  carrier (CAC), and carnitine-palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT2). Acyl-CoA undergoes β-oxidation
  (β-ox) with the production of acetyl-CoA that enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle
  (TCA). NADH and FADH2 generated by β-oxidation and TCA are the electron donors for
  the electron transport chain (ETC). The Organic Cation Transporter Novel 2 (OCTN2)
  mediates carnitine entry in the cytosol by a sodium dependent transport reaction.
