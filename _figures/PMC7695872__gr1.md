caption: Peripheral tolerance and the development of autoimmune diseaseThere appear
  to be two mechanisms of self-tolerance where T cell deletion has not occurred. In
  the first, top left, there is no significant expression of peptide-MHC on antigen-presenting
  cells (APC) so that T cells remain ignorant. In the second, bottom left, peptide-MHC
  is expressed on APC (shown by small open circles) but T cell activation is controlled
  by Treg. We are proposing that a common pathway in autoimmune disease is the breakdown
  of T cell ignorance consequent on a change in availability of antigen. This antigen
  change may be due to infectious damage of a tissue/organ or other cause as discussed.
  Thus, the ignorant state (top right) is transformed into that of antigen recognition
  (bottom right). Autoimmune disease will ensue unless Treg can deal with this new
  situation.
