caption: Mechanism of infection and life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells. The spike
  (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
  receptors expressed on the surface of the host cell. This binding facilitates the
  entry of the virus inside the host cell via an endosomal pathway. Upon its entry,
  the virus releases its RNA in the cytoplasm. The polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are
  then produced by the translation of ORF 1a and ORF1ab. These polyproteins are further
  cleaved by the proteases, which results in the production of 16 NSPs. The RTC (replication
  transcription complex) uses the genomic (+) RNA as the template. The genomic (+)
  RNA produced via the process of replication becomes the new virus particle’s genome.
  The subgenomic mRNAs produced by transcription are translated into structural proteins,
  i.e., spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, which
  are responsible for the formation of the viral particle. The S, M, and E proteins
  enter the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and the N protein combines with the genomic
  (+) RNA, forming a nucleoprotein complex. At last, all the viral components are
  integrated into the ERGIC (ER-Golgi intermediate compartment) and are ultimately
  released in the extracellular environment through exocytosis.
