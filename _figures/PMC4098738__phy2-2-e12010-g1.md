caption: Intraindividual variability in urine AGT, gremlin, and MMP‐7. Distribution
  of coefficients of variation (CV) for each analyte measured in urine samples collected
  at 0, 3, and 12 months. An/Cr, analyte to creatinine ratio in spot and 24‐h urine
  collections; AnER, analyte excretion rate. The dashed lines represent the intraindividual
  CVs for urine albumin excretion in the same samples.
