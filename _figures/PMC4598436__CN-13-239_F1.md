caption: Possible molecular pathways of TRPV1 channel activation on epilepsy in hippocampal
  neurons. Convulsions in epilepsy can results in augmented glutamate release, leading
  to Ca2+ uptake through NMDA receptor and TRP channels. Mitochondria were reported
  to accumulate Ca2+ provided cytosolic Ca2+ rises, thereby leading to depolarization
  of mitochondrial membranes. At the extreme, Ca2+ entry causes severe mitochondrial
  permeability transition or even the rupture of the mitochondrial membrane, substantial
  swelling of the mitochondria with rupture of the outer membrane and release of apoptosis-inducing
  factors such as caspase 3 and 9. Anandamide, capsaicin, resiniferatoxin, nitric
  oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce Ca2+ accumulation through desensitization
  of TRPV1 channels although pharmacological desensitization of TRPV1 channels through
  antagonists such as capsazepine (CPZ) and 5'-iodoresiniferatoxin (IRTX) contributes
  to an immediate reduction on neuronal excitability []. ROS enhance also spontaneous
  release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals onto neurons through TRPV1 channel
  activation. The molecular pathway may be a cause of epileptic seizures and the subject
  should urgently investigate.
