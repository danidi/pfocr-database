caption: (A) Schematic diagram of SUMO pathway. Post-translational modification of
  proteins with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a highly dynamic process.
  SUMO precursors are processed by the corresponding Sentrin/SUMO specific proteases
  which possess endopeptidase activity (SENP1/2/3/5) to become mature. Conjugation
  of SUMO to its substrate is programmed by a series of enzymatic cascades catalyzed
  by E1 activating enzymes (a heterodimeric, Aosl/uba2), E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9,
  and E3 ligating enzymes. SUMO2/3 contains the SUMO consensus modification motif
  (ψKxE/D) (ψ is a hydrophobic amino acid and x is any amino acid) which allows the
  formation of poly-SUMO chains []. Removal of SUMO from substrate is likewise executed
  by SUMO specific proteases which possess isopeptidase activity with SENP1/2 has
  the propensity of releasing SUMO1 rather than SUMO2/3, and SENP3/5 preferentially
  deconjugates SUMO2/3. While the poly-SUMO chains are specifically edited SENP-6/7
  []. (B) Schematic representation of the relevance of SENP3 in regulating BTB dynamic.
  SENP3 modulates the transcriptional activity of STAT3 which dictates the expression
  of those genes involved in tight junction, such as ZO-1 and Occludin. Furthermore,
  SENP3 also orchestrate cytoskeleton architecture through interfering with Rac1/Cdc42-N-WASP-Arp2/3
  pathway, and MAPK-Elk1 signaling, which licenses the expression of Profilin-1. Depletion
  of SENP3 therefore incites the dysfunction of those regulators required for tight
  junction integrity and cytoskeleton architecture, respectively, in Sertoli cells,
  and thereby undermines the microenvironment for proper spermatogenesis maintained
  by BTB dynamic.
