caption: Signaling pathway in brain capillaries mediating the seizure-induced overexpression
  of Pgp. Seizure-induced release of glutamate signals through the N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA) receptor, which leads to activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2).
  In turn, this leads to the release of arachidonic acid, which cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)
  converts to PGE2, which, via the PGE2 (EP1) receptor, leads to the transcriptional
  activation of ABCB1 (MDR1) and thus increased Pgp expression and transport activity
  levels at the BBB. The downstream event of EP1 receptors, which drives transcriptional
  activation of the Pgp encoding gene, is not clear, but the transcription factor
  NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) has been proposed to act as a master regulator of ATP-binding
  cassette (ABC) transporter expression in brain capillaries []. Note that the different
  cell and vesicle types are not drawn to scale. Modified from Potschka [] and Hartz
  et al. [].
