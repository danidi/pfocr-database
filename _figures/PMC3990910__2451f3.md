caption: 'Mechanisms of Notch signaling silencing in AML. So far, 4 potential levels
  of silencing of Notch signaling have been identified: (1) AML-initiating cells may
  reside in niches not expressing Notch ligands; (2) Notch pathway genes might be
  mutated (so far, only MAML1 mutations have been identified); (3) Notch pathway genes
  might be epigenetically silenced (for example, HES5, LFNG, and MAML1 have been shown
  to be hypermethylated in IDH mutant patients; and (4) alternative splicing of Notch
  pathway genes might lead to expression of inactive isoforms (to date, mis- or alternative-splicing
  of NOTCH2 and RBP-Jκ have been identified in a large fraction of AML patients).'
