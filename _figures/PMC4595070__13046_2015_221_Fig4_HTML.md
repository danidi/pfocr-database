caption: Interaction of caveolin 1-deficient CAFs with tumor cells. Cancer cells induce
  a pseudo-hypoxic microenvironment rich in ROS derived from metabolic reprogramming.
  By contrast, CAFs negative for caveolin 1 provide tumor cells with lactate, pyruvate,
  and ketone bodies. Notably, although cancer cells depend heavily on mitochondrial
  metabolism, CAFs exhibit the Warburg effect and activation of the autophagic pathway
