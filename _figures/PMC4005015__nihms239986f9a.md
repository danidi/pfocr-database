caption: Fig. 9a. Normaxic, hyperglycemic HIF pathway. In normoxia, hyperglycemic
  PKC activation, AGEs formation, mitochondrial ROS, and proinflammatory cytokines
  (e.g. IL-1β and TNF-α) decreases the degradation (through impairing proteasomal
  system) and/or increases the expression of HIF (through activating NF-κB). The elevated
  cytoplasmic HIF proteins may switch glucose metabolism from aerobic respiration
  to fermentation giving rise to lactate accumulation (also see ). The hyperglycemia-induced
  excess cytosolic HIF proteins may also lead to increased autophagy, while the lysosomal
  proteases are impaired by hyperglycemia. The combination of the two effects may
  also results in the accumulation of lysosomal lipofuscin. In addition, the excess
  cytosolic HIF proteins, such as an ubiquitinated form of HIF-1α induced by TNF-α,
  can also transactivate HIF-inducible genes (also see Fig 9b). However, under hypoxia
  the hyperglycemia-induced HIF protein is more stable.Fig. 9b. Hypoxic, hyperglycemic
  HIF pathway. In hypoxia, the transactivation activity of HIF is turned on because
  both oxygen sensors, PHD and FIH, become inactive. This eliminates proteasomal degradation
  of HIF proteins. The HIF proteins are further stabilized by hypoxia-induced HSP90
  and bind to the HREs in the promoter or enhancer region of HIF-inducible genes to
  transactivate the transcriptions of the genes. The HIF pathway consists of many
  HIF-inducible genes, which encode a wide range of proteins, including RAGE, glycolytic
  enzymes, GLUTs, Epo, and VEGF. The hyperglycemic, hypoxic HIF pathway may be enhanced
  by hyperglycemic AGE formation and PKC activation, which can activate RAGE signaling
  cascades and increase HIF expression. Furthermore, in adaptation of lower efficiency
  of ATP generation from fermentation, the activation of GLUTs and glycolytic enzymes
  increase glucose uptake and up-regulate the glycolysis pathway (also see ). Therefore,
  in hyperglycemic, hypoxic conditions the HIF pathway may further deteriorate the
  four glycolysis-associated pathways and lactate accumulation in the cytoplasm. Furthermore,
  the hyperglycemia-induced excess cytosolic HIF proteins may also enhance autophage,
  while the lysosomal system is impaired by hyperglycemia. Together, they may also
  result in the accumulation of lysosomal lipofuscin. In addition, hyperglycemia-induced
  proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β and TNF-α) can further enhance the HIF pathway.
