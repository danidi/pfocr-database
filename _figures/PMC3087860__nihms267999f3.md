caption: 'Apoptosis: intrinsic, extrinsic, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mechanisms.
  The diagram shows the various signaling pathways leading to apoptosis and the generation
  of ROS. Upon stress activation, p53 translocates to the mitochondria where it interacts
  with the BcL-2 family members, including anti-apoptotic BcL-xL and pro-apoptotic
  Bax and Bak. P53 disrupts inhibitory complexes formed with tBid and Bim, which effectively
  activate Bax and Bak to oligomerize and form lipid pores in the outer mitochondrial
  membrane, a process called mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).
  The Bax/Bak pathway subsequently activates caspase 12 mediated apoptosis through
  the release of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic p53 also plays a role in transcription
  independent apoptosis by being liberated from BcL-xL by Puma, and then activating
  cytosolic Bax. TNF-α is responsible for extrinsic death receptor mediated apoptosis,
  which is proposed to be activated by ROS stimulation through the p38 MAPK pathway.
  This leads to NF-κB and caspase 8 activation, which link the extrinsic pathway to
  the intrinsic apoptotic mechanism initiated by p53. The ER stress response mechanism
  might be triggered by the accumulation of ‘damage molecules’ in the ER, stimulating
  the unfolded protein response (UPR) and activating NF-κB. GADD-153 activates pro-apoptotic
  factors and downregulates anti-apoptotic BcL-2. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor-2 (TRAF-2) and caspase 12 stimulation contribute to apoptosis and cell death.'
