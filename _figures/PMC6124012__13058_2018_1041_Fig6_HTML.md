caption: 'Proposed working model for role of sterol regulatory element-binding protein
  1 (SREBP1) signaling in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) long-term estrogen deprivation
  (LTED) cells. Genes: the upregulated genes in MM134 or SUM44 LTED cells compared
  with parental cells, which were validated in the in vitro experiments or based on
  the RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) data or both. Black arrow, the potential pathway of
  SREBP1 promoting the survival of LTED cells'
