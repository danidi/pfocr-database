caption: Binding of Aβ1–42 to microglial cells (1) causes ATP release (2) and Aβ-induced
  upregulation of P2Y2R expression and ATP-induced P2Y2R activation (3). P2Y2R activation
  regulatesAβ1–42 uptake by microglial cells through P2Y2R interaction with αv integrins
  and perhaps other proteins that results in activation of the downstream signaling
  molecules Rac1 and Src1 (4).
