caption: The filamentation signaling pathway recovered completely. (A) The main chain
  of the filamentation pathway (KEGG Database), (B) PathFinder output for Sho1-Tec1
  pair (100% recall, 12% precision). For (A), the dashed links indicate interactions
  that do not exists in the database. For (B), the interactions that were predicted
  as false negatives were shown with dashed lines. The proteins that were not on the
  main chain of any pathway were not colored, whereas proteins that are part of other
  pathways were colored.
