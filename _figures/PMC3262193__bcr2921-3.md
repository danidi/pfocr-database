caption: Signaling pathways and proteins that increase or decrease STAT5 signaling
  in normal mammary epithelial cells. Research to date has identified several factors
  that contribute to higher levels of STAT5 activation or, conversely, reduce activation
  levels in normal mammary epithelial cells. E74-like factor 5 (ets domain transcription
  factor) (ELF5) acts in the PRL/JAK2 signaling pathway to increase levels of STAT5
  activation in normal mammary epithelial cells. Other signaling pathway components
  that increase STAT5 activation are EGF, ErbB2, transforming growth factor-alpha
  (TGF-α), estrogen acting with the progesterone pathway acting downstream, GH/JAK2,
  IGF, and c-Src. The TGF-β signaling pathway can decrease STAT5 activation levels.
  Cellular proteins that contribute to increased STAT5 activation include PI 3-kinase
  enhancer A (PIKE-A), serine/threonine protein kinase Akt 1 (AKT-1), p21-activated
  kinase 1 (Pak1), the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Shp2, beta-integrin, and dystroglycan.
  Cellular proteins that have been shown to decrease STAT5 activation levels include
  caveolin-1 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3). c-Src, human cellular-Src;
  EGF, epidermal growth factor; ErbB4, v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene
  homolog 4, neuro/glioblastoma-derived oncogene homolog (avian); GH, growth hormone;
  IGF, insulin growth factor; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; PRL, prolactin; Shp2, Src homology
  region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-2; STAT5, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 5.
