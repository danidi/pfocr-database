caption: Schematic illustration of different pathways of glucose metabolism in cancer
  cells. Glucose enters the cell via glucose transporter proteins (GLUT). Metabolic
  flux rates in different pathways are determined by the regulation of rate-limiting
  enzymes as described in the text, as well as by the balanced equilibrium of respective
  intermediates. Enzymes, reactions, and intermediates of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway
  are coloured in red, whereas those of the PPP are coloured in blue. Selected enzymes
  which are referred to in the text are listed at their respective positions. The
  oxidative branch of the PPP delivers ribose-5-phosphate for the biosynthesis of
  nucleotides, as well as NADPH for reductive biosynthesis, for the regulation of
  the redox state within the cell, and for the detoxification of ROS. Within the illustration
  of the non-oxidative PPP, C3, C7, C6, and C4 indicate sugar phosphate intermediates,
  which are interconverted in equilibrium reactions by the transketolase and transaldolase
  enzymes. Xylulose-5-phosphate, the concentration of which determines the flux rates
  through both major pathways, may be generated from glucose-6-phosphate via the oxidative
  or the non-oxidative branch of the PPP. It may serve as a substrate for TKTL1 in
  a putative cleavage reaction, which generates GAP and a 2-carbon unit, probably
  acetyl-CoA. Cytosolic acetyl-CoA is utilized for glucose-induced lipogenesis. GAP,
  which is also generated in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, may be further metabolized
  either in the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, or via methylglyoxal to D-lactate. In cancer
  cells, the generation of L-lactate from pyruvate is predominantly catalyzed by LDHA.
  Both lactate stereo-isomers are in an equilibrium with pyruvate. Since the oxidation
  of pyruvate is frequently inhibited in cancer cells (see text), high amounts of
  lactate are exported via monocarboxylate transporters (MCT).
