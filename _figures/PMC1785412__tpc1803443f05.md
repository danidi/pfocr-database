caption: Rate of Tuberization of Full-Length St BEL5 Transgenic Lines.Previous work
  on the analysis of transgenic lines that overexpressed St BEL5 was done with the
  coding sequence only (A) (). In this experiment, transgenic lines overexpressing
  the full-length St BEL5 transcript (A), including ∼650 nucleotides of the UTRs (accession
  number AF406697) were tested. Line 7540 is nontransformed S. tuberosum ssp andigena.
  Evaluations were performed on 10 plants per line cultured on Murashige and Skoog
  (MS) medium with 6% sucrose (B). Plants were scored for time to tuber formation
  under LDs (earliness), number of tubers after 14 LDs, and total tuber yield after
  56 d under SD conditions in vitro. The greenhouse LD experiment was with soil-grown
  plants. The top five lines (asterisks) tuberized as soil-grown plants in 10-cm pots
  after 8 weeks under LD conditions in the greenhouse. Most of these tubers ranged
  from 1.5 to 2.5 cm in diameter (C). Overexpression lines of the coding sequence
  only () did not form tubers under LDs even after 6 months in the greenhouse. The
  means of the St BEL5-FL lines for earliness, tuber number, and yield were significantly
  greater than the 7540 control plants at P = 0.05 (Fisher's test), and this difference
  is designated by the letters a or b. ND, not detected.
