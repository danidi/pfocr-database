caption: Proposed model of regulation of endothelial barrier function by FBXW7. In
  quiescent endothelium, SREBP is efficiently degraded via the proteasome because
  of FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination, so there is no or little activation of the cholesterol
  pathway. RhoB is expressed at low levels; the expressed RhoB is modified with a
  geranylgeranyl group to be inactive and stored in vesicles or with a farnesyl group
  to be active at the cell periphery. Upon loss of FBXW7, SREBP is stabilized, which
  results in activation of the cholesterol pathway by induction of HMCGR. Therefore,
  more GGPP and FPP is generated to modify RhoB. More RhoB will accumulate in the
  vesicles, but more RhoB will also be active at the cell periphery, inducing stress
  fiber formation and contraction. Addition of FTI will rescue this effect, because
  this induces geranylgeranylation of RhoB, an effect that is mimicked by GGPP. Addition
  of GGTI will lead to a switch toward farnesylation of RhoB that promotes its signaling
  at the plasma membrane and thus is detrimental for endothelial barrier function.

  description: Proposed model of regulation of endothelial barrier function by FBXW7.
    In quiescent endothelium, SREBP is efficiently degraded via the proteasome because
    of FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination, so there is no or little activation of the cholesterol
    pathway. RhoB is expressed at low levels; the expressed RhoB is modified with

    group to be active at the cell periphery. Upon loss of FBXW7, SREBP is stabilized,
    which results in activation of the cholesterol pathway by induction of HMCGR.
    Therefore, more GGPP and FPP is generated to modify RhoB. More RhoB will accumulate
    in the vesicles, but more RhoB will also be active at the cell periphery, inducing
    stress fiber formation and contraction. Addition of FTI will rescue this effect,
    because this induces geranylgeranylation of RhoB, an effect that is mimicked by

    promotes its signaling at the plasma membrane and thus is detrimental for endothelial
    barrier function.
