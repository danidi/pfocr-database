caption: Model of BLI-3 functions This model of BLI-3 functions includes (1) ROS bursts
  at the cell surface to kill invading pathogens, (2) ROS as a signaling molecule
  from the cell surface BLI-3 to p38 MAPK signaling to SKN-1, (3) the feedback loop
  to MEMO-1 important for healthy aging, (4) endoplasmic reticulum localized BLI-3
  to sulfenylate IRE-1 leading to TRF-1 recruitment and NSY-1 activation signaling
  to p38 MAPK pathway to SKN-1 orchestrating the oxidative stress response, and (5)
  during development BLI-3 generated ROS together with MLT-7 to crosslink collagens.
