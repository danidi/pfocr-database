caption: 'Schematic representation of the interaction between pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs) from dendritic cells (DCs) and VLPs. VLPs are recognized by PRRs
  from DCs (CLRs, TLRs, and FCγR). After this, VLPs are taken up by receptor-mediated
  endocytosis. VLPs are processed for the presentation of their epitopes through cross-presentation
  or MHCII. For cross-presentation, VLPs reach the proteasome, are degraded into the
  cytosol, and the short peptides derived from VLPs are transported to the endoplasmic
  reticulum by TAP (transporter associated with antigen presentation). MHCI-epitope
  complexes are moved to the cell surface from DCs to stimulate CD8+ T cells which
  induce lysis of cancer cells or cells infected by intracellular pathogens. The other
  pathway for antigen presentation is through MHCII molecules. In this case, VLPs
  are processed into short peptides by lysosomal proteases. In the meantime, the variant
  chain (li) is processed and loaded into MHCII molecules (class II associated li
  derived peptides, CLIPs) until their exchange by VLP epitopes. Later, the MCHII-epitope
  complexes are moved to the cell surface from DCs to stimulate CD4+ T cells which
  help B cells to produce antibodies or to CD8+ T cells to enhance their cytotoxicity.
  Additionally, two signals are required for full activation of adaptive immune system
  cells: costimulatory molecules (such as CD80) and cytokines (such as IL-12 for CD8+
  T cells and Th1 cells; and finally, IL-10 and IL-13 for Th2 cells).'
