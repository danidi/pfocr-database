caption: Regulation of glutamine and glucose metabolism defines the ability of hematopoietic
  stem cells (HSC) to differentiate into erythroid versus myeloid lineages in vitro
  and in vivo. A) Glutamine uptake and glutaminolys is in support of de novo nucleotide
  biosynthesis and tricarboxylic acid cycle α-ketoglutarate generation are critical
  for HSC erythroid lineage commitment. Alternative metabolic pathways that support
  nucleotide synthesis, including 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) blunting of glucose metabolism
  away from glycolys is toward the pentose phosphate pathway promotes erythropoiesis.
  B) In contrast, impairing nucleotide biosynthesis during erythropoietin-induced
  differentiation by impeding upstream glutamine synthesis (methionine sulfoximine,
  MSO), glutamine uptake, glutaminolys is (6-diao-5-oxo-L-norleucine, DON), transaminase
  reactions (aminooxyacetic acid, AOA) or blocking glucose entry into the pentose
  phosphate pathway (6-aminonicotinamide, 6-AN) skews lineage commitment away from
  erythroid, and toward myeloid fate. Supplementation with nucleosides rescues erythropoiesis,
  establishing the importance of de novo nucleotide biosynthesis for erythroid lineage
  commitment. GDH – glutamine dehydrogenase, GPAT – glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphateamidotransferase,
  GS – glutamine synthetase, G-6-P – glucose-6-phosphate, G6PD –glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, PRA 5-Phosphoribosylamine, PRPP– 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate.
