caption: 'Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized enzymatically from the amino acid l-arginine
  by three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS), including endothelial NOS (eNOS). Minute
  amounts of endogenously produced or exogenously administered NO activate soluble
  guanylate cyclase (sGC), which converts GTP to cyclic GMP, mediating various physiological
  and tissue protective effects. Degradation of cGMP to GMP is catalysed by several
  phosphodiesterase (PDE) families. Excessive amounts of NO produced under pathological
  conditions associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress react avidly
  with superoxide anion (•O2−), to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Peroxynitrite, in concert
  with other oxidants, induces cell damage via lipid peroxidation, inactivation of
  enzymes and other proteins by oxidation and nitration, and activation of matrix
  metalloproteinases (MMP) and the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP),
  which ultimately leads to cellular dysfunction and death. NO–sGC–cGMP signalling
  can be compromised either by reducing the bioavailability of NO (for example, via
  chemical interaction of NO with •O2−) or by altering the redox state of sGC itself
  (for example, through oxidative stress or the action of peroxynitrite), thereby
  making it unresponsive to endogenous NO and NO-releasing drugs. Two novel drug classes
  seem to be able to overcome these obstacles: sGC stimulators (stimulate sGC directly
  and enhance sensitivity of the reduced enzyme to low levels of bioavailable NO)
  and sGC activators (activate the NO-unresponsive, haem-oxidized or haem-free enzyme).
  Other potential therapeutic approaches that modulate this pathway are also shown
  (dotted lines).'
