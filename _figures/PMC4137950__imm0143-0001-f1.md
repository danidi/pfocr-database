caption: 'Human respriatory syncytial virus (hRSV) recognition by airways epithelial
  cells: upon infection, different hRSV components activate pattern recognition receptors
  (PRRs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial in the hRSV recognition and the triggering
  of innate immune response against this pathogen; TLR2 and TLR4, expressed in the
  cell surface, and TLR3 and TLR7, present in cytoplasmatic endosomes, are activated
  in response to hRSV and promote the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such
  as interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-1β and IL-6 through the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and
  interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) pathway. Also retinoic acid-inducible gene
  (RIG-1) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD2), which belong to RIG-I-like
  receptors (RLRs) and NOD-1-like receptors (NLRs), respectively, participate in the
  recognition of viral RNA associated with mitochondrial anti-viral signalling (MAVS)
  in the mitochondrial membrane in the cytoplasm leading to activation of NF-κB and
  IRF3.'
