caption: (A) Low levels of ACh do not produce effective fluid secretion because they
  activate K+ channels (K2) but not apical Cl– channels. (B) Low levels of VIP do
  not produce effective fluid secretion because they activate CFTR but not K+ channels.
  (C) When combined at low levels, ACh (i) activates Ca2+-activated K+ channels (K2)
  to increase the driving force through CFTR; it may also increase activity of basolateral
  transporters. VIP opens CFTR (ii), allowing electrogenic, anion-mediated fluid secretion.
  (D) At higher levels of ACh, apical Ca2+-activated chloride channels (CaCC) are
  activated (iii); at higher levels of VIP, cAMP-activated K+ channels (K1) are activated
  (iv). Thus, at higher rates of stimulation each pathway alone can produce enough
  fluid to support mucus secretion. Major unresolved points are the types of gland
  mucus secretory cells that express Ca2+-activated chloride channels (serous, mucous,
  or both) and the relative magnitudes of the apical conductances mediated by each
  type of channel. The apical K+ channel is based on single channel recordings in
  Calu-3 cells () and gland cells (J.V. Wu, unpublished observations).
