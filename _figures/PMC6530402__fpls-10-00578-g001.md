caption: The main O2-sensing pathways described in plants (identified in Arabidopsis
  and hypothesized to be present in M. truncatula) and S. meliloti N2-fixing bacteria.
  (A) In Arabidopsis, the Cys branch of the N-end rule pathway for protein degradation
  allows the O2-dependent regulation of gene expression (). ERF-VIIs are a class of
  transcription factors characterized by a conserved N-termini (N-degron) in which
  Cys2 determines the protein’s fate in response to O2 level inside the cell. In aerobic
  conditions (left), ERF-VIIs are unable to activate the transcription of anaerobic
  genes. In these conditions, Met Aminopeptidase (MetAP) removes the N-terminal Met,
  and PCOs oxidize the resulting exposed Cys (C∗) (; ). After arginylation by Arginyl
  Transferases (ATE1-2), an Ubiquitin Ligase (PRT6) identifies the proteins as a degradation
  substrate for the 26S proteasome. Under O2 deficient conditions (right), the efficiency
  of ERF-VIIs oxidation is dampened, allowing the stabilization and translocation
  into the nucleus to finally induce a set of anaerobic genes (), with Arabidopsis
  RAP2.2 and RAP2.12 playing a major role in comparison to the other ERF-VIIs ().
  This also happens through fine regulation controlled by the Hypoxia Response Attenuator
  (HRA1), which antagonizes RAP2.12 through a feedback mechanism that enables a flexible
  response to different levels of O2 availability (, ). The cis-regulatory element
  Hypoxia Responsive Promoter Element (HRPE) has been identified as being enriched
  in some hypoxia-responsive genes (). (B) FixL-FixJ two-component regulatory system
  in S. meliloti symbiotic bacteria regulates the expression of nif and fix gene clusters
  in an O2-dependent way. In free-living bacteria (left), FixL is inhibited by the
  binding of O2 to the heme moiety inside the PAS domain. By establishing symbiosis
  with the plant, nodule formation gives rise to a microoxic environment surrounding
  the microbial cells (right). In turn, FixL is activated by auto-phosphorylation
  and transfers the phosphoryl group to the FixJ transcriptional activator, thus regulating
  nif and fix genes expression.
