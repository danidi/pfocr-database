caption: cGMP-PKG signalling in the cardiomyocyte. cGMP is generated by NO stimulation
  of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in the cytosol (left) or natriuretic peptide
  receptor (NPR) coupled particulate guanylate cyclase (pGC) activation at the cell
  membrane (right). PDE5, which is located at the z-discs, appears to mainly target
  sGC-synthetized cGMP. PKG attenuates G-protein-coupled signalling (GPCR) via phosphorylation
  of regulator of G-protein signalling (RGS). Studies suggest that this happens through
  both sGC- and pGC-activated PKG pools., NO-derived cGMP/PKG improves proteasomal
  function, dampens ischaemia- and doxorubicin-related damaging mitochondrial signalling,,
  and reduces activation of the maladaptive transcription factors NFAT and myocyte
  enhancer factor-2 (MEF2). NO/sGC/cGMP-activated PKG also phosphorylates several
  myofilament proteins effecting enhanced lusitropy and attenuated beta-adrenergic
  inotropy.– PKG stimulated by both cGMP generated via the pGC pathway at the cell
  membrane or PDE5 inhibition with sildenafil inhibits TRPC6. Calcium that enters
  the cell through TRPC6 partakes in myofilament activation and force generation (slow
  force response, SFR), and calcineurin (CaN)-NFAT signalling,, and possibly mitochondrial
  calcium and permeability transition. In addition, pGC-cGMP-stimulated PKG selectively
  enhances transcription factors that have been linked to cell survival and enhanced
  adaption, GATA-binding protein 4 (GATA4), and cAMP response element-binding protein
  (CREB). NP-stimulated cGMP is preferentially targeted by PDE9, which localizes close
  to t-tubules. Oxidation (ROS) attenuates PKG activation and protective signalling
  in the cardiomyocyte. Whether oxidative activation differs according to the source
  of cGMP/PKG remains to be determined. PKG prevents activation and nuclear transport
  of mothers against decapentaplegic homologue 3 (SMAD3) and hence TGFβ-related signalling
  in myofibroblasts., Whether this happens in cardiomyocytes and whether this is differentially
  impacted according to PKG generation are unclear. Please note that research into
  the cardiac targets of the PDE9-related cGMP-PKG signal is as yet limited, and many
  of the studies to date did not strictly differentiate between sGC- and pGC-regulated
  cGMP signalling. Future studies will reveal the amount of crosstalk between these
  functional compartments and the respective importance in varied pathophysiologies,
  and thus paint a more complete or modified picture of compartmentalized PKG-associated
  signalling.
