caption: Autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). The lysosome is a key cellular organelle
  for the degradation of proteins maintaining a balance between synthesis and clearance.
  Three pathways—macroautophagy, chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and microautophagy—converge
  on this central hub to deliver cargo for degradation. The lysosome is a central
  mechanism by which the production of aSyn in the brain is controlled (see text for
  details). LAMP-2A, Lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 2; HSC70, heat shock
  cognate 70; CtsL, Cathepsin L; CtsD, Cathepsin D; CtsB, Cathepsin B; GCase, Glucocerebrosidase.
