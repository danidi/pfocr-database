caption: Schematic model of BLyS/BAFF-R signaling in normal and neoplastic B cells.
  Our current conceptual hypothesis of how the BLyS/BAFF-R signaling contributes to
  autonomous cell growth in normal and aggressive NHL-B cells. In this model, BAFF-R
  located in the plasma membrane of lymphoma cells provides signaling for NF-κB pathway
  activation upon ligand (BLyS) binding. In the nucleus, BAFF-R associates with IKKβ
  and promotes histone H3 phosphorylation. BAFF-R, IKKβ, and NF-κB/c-rel form a nuclear
  complex binding to NF-κB target gene promoters and regulating transcription of these
  genes.
