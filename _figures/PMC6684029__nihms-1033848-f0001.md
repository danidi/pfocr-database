caption: A. chemoattractant cAMP binds to G-protein coupled receptors, causing the
  G-protein α and βγ subunits to dissociate in a persistent manner (B). One of the
  earliest downstream signals is RasGTP activation, mediated by RasGEF and RasGAP.
  RasGTP activity adapts perfectly (blue line in C), in agreement with a LEGI model
  in which RasGEF acts as the excitation (green line in C), and RasGAP as the inhibitor
  (red line in C). Ras activates the PI3K signaling pathway which can be monitored
  using PIP3-specific biosensors. The observed behavior suggests the presence of a
  threshold (dotted line in D). Signals above the threshold elicit responses (dotted
  line in D); sub-threshold signals do not (dashed line in D).
