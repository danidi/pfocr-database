caption: 'Related proteins identified from A. lancea in this study: (1) MBL pathway
  (green color): Mannan-binding lectin. (2) G protein signal transduction pathway
  (sky-blue color): GDP-mannose-dependent alpha-(1–6)-phosphatidylinositol monomannoside
  mannosyltransferase, mannosyltransferase; Mannosyltransferase; GTP binding signal
  recognition particle protein; RhoGEF; Protein synthesis factor GTP-binding protein;
  Rho GTPase-activating protein 19 isoform X5; Adenylyl cyclase. (3) Protein kinase
  (yellow color): Receptor-like protein kinase 3; Adenylate kinase B; Phosphoprotein;
  Phosphoglycerate kinase. (4) Mannose pathway (carmine color): Hexokinase; Chlorophyll
  a/b binding protein; Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase; ATP synthesis enzymes; Redox
  enzymes depend on NADH/NAD. (5) Terpenoids biosynthesis pathway (red color): Cytochrome
  P450; Epoxide hydrolase. The blue dotted box represents previous finding that AL12
  could enhance volatile oil accumulation mediated by Ca2+-CaM, protein phosphorylation
  and many signalling molecules, such as NO, H2O2, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid,
  and brassinolide.'
