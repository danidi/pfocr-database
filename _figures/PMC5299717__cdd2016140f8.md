caption: 'Model depicting a hypothetical mechanism by which mTOR self-regulates its
  own abundance via the lysosome/autophagy pathway following global ischemia. Left:
  Under physiological conditions, mTOR imposes a brake on autophagy by phosphorylation
  and inactivation of ULK-1 at S757, retaining ULK-1 away from AMPK, thereby imposing
  a break on autophagy. Right: In response to ischemia, mTOR phosphorylation/inactivation
  of ULK-1 is decreased, whereas AMPK-dependent phosphorylation/activation of ULK-1
  is increased. This, in turn, removes the brake on initiation of autophagy and promotes
  ULK-1-mediated phosphorylation of Beclin-1 at S14, which drives induction of autophagy.
  The increase in autophagy further degrades mTOR via the lysosome, providing a feedback
  mechanism by which mTOR self-regulates its own abundance in CA1 neurons destined
  to die'
