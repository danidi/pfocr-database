caption: Schematic view of the roles of S-PCNA and Srs2 in the rescue of stalled replication
  forks. Left panel, monoubiquitination of PCNA on residue K164 promotes the Rad6/Rad18-dependent
  TLS pathway. Therefore, in the absence of Rad18 (boxed area) the cells become extremely
  sensitive to UV damage. On one hand, absence of ubiquitination no longer triggers
  the replacement of Polδ by Polη while on the other hand the unconjugated lysine
  K164 allows SUMOylation to recruit Srs2 that in turn dislodges either Polδ or Polη.
  This sensitivity is partially alleviated when Srs2 can no longer interact with S-PCNA
  (srs2ΔSIM). The dotted arrows indicate suboptimal processes. Right panel, polyubiquitination
  of PCNA results in error-free Rad5-dependent TS. Furthermore, Rad51 cooperates to
  promote TS regulated by the Ubc9-dependent SUMOylation pathway (TS/HR). SUMOylation
  of PCNA on residues K164 and K127 targets Srs2 to the replication fork to downregulate
  the HR pathway. As PCNA becomes increasingly SUMOylated, Srs2 is gradually concentrated
  at D-loops where it can block the further extension of repair synthesis and limit
  the extent of conversion tracts by releasing Polδ from its complex with S-PCNA.
  As a consequence, shorter stretches of DNA synthesis are easier to become destabilized
  through various activities therefore promoting NCO outcomes. Finally, Srs2 could
  also stimulate SDSA directly, thus lowering the risk of CO occurrence.
