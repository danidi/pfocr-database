caption: Thiol-redox signaling and apoptotic signaling cascades. Studies on postmortem
  brain tissue of PD patients have reported the presence of apoptotic markers in the
  substantia nigra supporting a role for apoptosis (programmed cell death) in neuronal
  cell loss. Accordingly, activation of caspases and pro-apoptotic members of the
  B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins was reported in the substantia nigra
  of PD patient autopsies, suggesting a role for the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis
  in neuronal cell death. Oxidative stress and alterations in GSH/GSSG balance are
  known to regulate the apoptotic machinery. However, very little is known about the
  mechanisms by which thiol-redox signaling regulates the progression of apoptosis
  in PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction in PD conveys the formation of RS, leading to the
  activation of the intrinsic pathway (). Activation of the mitochondrial pathway
  mediates the release of cytochrome C (Cyt C) that is regulated by the Bcl-2 protein
  family. The BH3-only members derepress Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2
  homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) by direct inhibition of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2
  proteins to promote apoptosis. Bax and Bak induce the permeabilization of the outer
  mitochondrial membrane and the release of Cyt C, leading to the recruitment of apoptotic
  protease activating factor 1 (Apaf1) into an apoptosome and activation of caspase-9.
  Initiator caspases further activate/cleave executioner caspases (3, 6, and 7), which
  mediate cell demise (). Proteins of the inhibitor of apoptosis family, including
  X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), inhibit executioner caspases through
  the occupation of their active site. In addition, XIAP can prevent caspase 9 dimerization
  that is required for its activation. XIAP-SNO is found in PD brains, and this oxidative
  modification impairs its ability to inhibit caspase activation (). Apoptosis signal-regulating
  kinase-1 (ASK-1) is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase
  family that activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 MAPK family members
  involved in apoptosis (). TRX1 associates with the N-terminal portion of ASK-1 inhibiting
  its kinase activity. When oxidation of TRX1 cysteine residues occurs, the TRX1-ASK-1
  complex dissociates leading to the phosphorylation and activation of ASK-1, which
  mediates the expression of pro-apoptotic genes ().
