caption: 'Predicted mechanism by which chloroquine kills the malaria parasite. Chloroquine
  (CQN) leads to the accumulation of heme. Although the downstream consequences of
  this effect are unknown, our analysis suggests that the accumulated heme leads to
  inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and thioredoxin reductase
  (TrxR), and that the downstream effects of these inhibitory events are the major
  determinants of chloroquine efficacy. This hypothesis also provides a mechanistic
  explanation of how chloroquine inhibits DNA synthesis (, ). Abbreviations: CDP,
