caption: Postulated mechanism for ceramide dependent regulation of G-CSF signaling
  in BMCs. In WT cells, G-CSF leads to the translocation and activation of G-CSF-R
  followed by the phosphorylation of Lyn kinase and of STAT3. This ultimately results
  in the expression of CXCR2 and its translocation into DRMs. Furthermore, G-CSF leads
  to downregulation of ceramides (CerS2 WT) and to upregulation of glycosylated very
  long chain ceramides in the plasma membrane. In CerS2 null cells, G-CSF did not
  induce the translocation of the G-CSF-R or the phosphorylation of Lyn, while the
  expression of CXCR2 was impaired. Moreover, due to the lack of CerS2, G-CSF induces
  upregulation of glycosylated long chain ceramides, leading to an altered lipid composition
  of the plasma membrane of CerS2 null cells in comparison to WT cells. In CerS6 null
  cells, G-CSF signaling and membrane composition is comparable to that in WT cells.
