  somatic cells: mitogen signaling through MAPK pathway activates cyclin D                                             -
  CDK4/6 kinase activity hypophosphorylating Rb family member proteins.                                             Hypophosphorylated
  Rb family member proteins bind to E2F transcription                                             factors
  blocking the transcription of E2F-regulated genes.  To surpass the                                             R
  point cyclin E - CDK2 kinase activity is activated hyperphosphorylating                                             Rb
  family member proteins.  Hyperphosphorylated Rb family member proteins                                             are
  unable to interact with E2F factors, allowing them to activate                                             transcription
  of genes necessary in the progression of cell cycle. (b)                                             Cell
  cycle regulation in ESCs as is currently understood.  Mitogen                                             signaling
  through MAPK pathways seems to be irrelevant in the progression                                             of
  cell cycle.  There is cell cycle-independent expression of cyclin E -                                             CDK2
  maintaining the hyperphosphorylated levels of Rb family member                                             proteins.  This
  results in cell cycle-independent expression of                                             E2F-regulated
  genes.  Cyclin B - CDC2 is the only CDK activity that appears                                             to
  be regulated by the cell cycle.  ESCs have shortened gap phases and an                                             elongated
  S phase of the cell cycle, with an apparent lack in the R point                                             for
  G1-S transition.'
