caption: The competition of 2-OBA and Pyr in the l-threonine-overproducing E. coli
  strain TWF115 and the strategy for metabolic detoxification of 2-OBA. In TWF115,
  the expression levels of the key enzymes relevant to the l-threonine biosynthetic
  pathway and pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (encoded by pntAB) are strengthened
  (bold black lines), and the two genes pflB and tdcE regarding similar catabolic
  pathways of pyruvate and 2-OBA are deleted (gray lines). In this study, genes poxB
  and acs, forming acetate bypass, were overexpressed in TWF115 under the temperature-controlled
  promoter pR-pL (bold red lines). The role of PDHc was replaced with the acetate
  bypass in the PDHc-deficient strain to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. The l-threonine
  biosynthesis relied on the cofactor supply (NADPH and ATP) mainly from the TCA (tricarboxylic
  acid) cycle. The four enzymes PDHc, pyruvate oxidase (PoxB) and pyruvate formate-lyase
  (PflB and TdcE) involved in the catabolism of 2-OBA and pyruvate are displayed with
  a light brown background. 2-OBA and pyruvate are potentially exchangeable to participate
  in these enzyme reactions because of their analog structures. PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; Asp, aspartate; Pyr, pyruvate; Ace, Acetate; AcCoA, acetyl-CoA;
