caption: 'A representative schematic for the pathways is shown. The canonical Wnt
  signaling pathway is referred to as the Wnt/β-catenin pathway since it can regulate
  β-catenin. All Wnt signaling pathways are initiated by interaction of Wnt proteins
  with Frizzled (FZD) receptors. Once Wnt protein binds to the FZD receptor and the
  co-receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)-5/6, this is
  followed by recruitment of Dishevelled. Dishevelled can inhibit glycogen synthase
  kinase (GSK-3β) activity. The non-canonical or calcium Wnt signaling pathway has
  two intracellular signaling cascades that consist of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway and the
  Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. In the Wnt/Ca2+pathway, Wnt protein binds
  to FZD receptors on the cell surface resulting in several cellular processes that
  can involve stimulation of heterotrimeric G proteins and increased intracellular
  Ca2+ release. Yet, the distinction between these pathways is sometimes not distinct
  and may involve non-canonical pathways, such as Wnt5a, that antagonize canonical
  pathways by leading to the degradation of β-catenin.Lef: Lymphoid enhancer-binding
  factor; Tcf: T cell factor.'
