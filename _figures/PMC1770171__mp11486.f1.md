caption: Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism. Brain tumour cells contain abnormally high
  concentrations of two dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, AA and linoleic acid.
  AA is biosynthesised from dietary linoleic acid or is incorporated into membrane
  phospholipids directly from dietary AA. Activation of phospolipase A2 (PLA2) causes
  the release of free AA. Once AA is released from phospholipids, it is oxidised by
  one of three different groups of oxygenases into AA metabolites eicosanoids. The
  insertion of a single oxygen atom into AA by certain cytochrome P-450 enzymes produces
  epoxy-AA. Cyclooxygenases (COXs) introduce two molecules of oxygen into AA, and
  prostaglandins, thromboxanes, prostacyclin, and malondialdehyde are synthesised
  through a series of subsequent biochemical steps. COX-1 is a constitutively active
  enzyme present in most cell types, whereas COX-2 is almost undetectable in most
  unstimulated tissues. However, the expression and activity of COX-2 is inducible
  and regulated by a variety of ligands, including growth factors, Ras proteins, cytokines,
  and tumour promoters. Lipoxygenases (LOs) introduce one molecule of oxygen into
  AA to produce a series of isomeric hydroperoxy acids that are subsequently converted
  into leukotrienes and lipoxins. According to the positional specificity with respect
  to AA, mammalian lipoxygenases are categorised into three main groups, 5-LO, 12-LO,
  and 15-LO. 5-LO performs the first of two enzymatic reactions in the biosynthetic
  pathway for the leukotrienes. COX and 5-LO derived eicosanoids stimulate cell proliferation,
  survival, adhesion, and motility, in addition to angiogenesis, increased vascular
  permeability, and inflammation, thus playing important roles in tumour growth and
  promotion. They are also considered to be the main mediators of peritumorous brain
  oedema in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Tumorigenesis associated cellular
  functions of eicosanoids can be inhibited by the suppression of PLA2 activity, by
  cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
  and COX-2 specific inhibitors, by 5-LO inhibitors such as boswellic acids, and possibly
  by the reduced dietary intake of ω-6 linoleic and arachidonic acid and increased
  intake of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.
