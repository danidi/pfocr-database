caption: The Figure shows an example of the connection of the KEGG pathways Focal
  adhesion (partial pathway, Green genes) and MAPK signalling (partial pathway, blue
  genes). Both biochemical pathways indicate connections to each other (indicated
  in the boxes) and gene profiles were produced on the microarray.
