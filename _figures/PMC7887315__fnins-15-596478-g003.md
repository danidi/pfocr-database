caption: Potassium channels in the MNTB. (A) Diagrams illustrating transmembrane topology
  and some of the regulatory phosphorylation sites in IHVA (Kv3 family) and ILVA (Kv1
  and KNa families) channels with documented functions in the MNTB. The intermediate
  IHVA/ILVA Kv2 family Kv2.2 channel is also depicted. (B) “Top down” schematic diagram
  illustrating the assembly of four Kv family subunits into a tetrameric channel with
  the potassium ion conduction pathway in the center.
