caption: Foxo3 controls DCs functions. The reverse signaling induced by CTLA4 ligation
  of B7 leads to Foxo3 nuclear accumulation. Once activated, Foxo3 directs SOD2 expression
  involved in activation of the IDO-dependent immunosuppressive pathway in DCs. In
  addition of controlling the redox status, Foxo3 major function in DCs is to constrain
  the production of IL-6 and then limit T cell survival. (For interpretation of the
  references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
