caption: NADPH oxidase- and mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species pathways
  in microglial activation. The antioxidants DPI, apocynin, NAC, MnTMPyP, gp91ds-tat
  peptide, and MitoTEMPO, decrease reactive oxygen species (i), leading to a decrease
  in release of proinflammatory factors. Exogenous catalase but not superoxide dismutase
  also blocks release, suggesting that superoxide (O2-) produced by NADPH oxidase
  requires dismutation to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) before it can mediate intracellular
  signaling (ii). Cell permeable H2O2 activates the MAP kinase signaling pathway and
  induces NF-kB translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus (iii), where it promotes
  synthesis of TNF-α and iNOS, leading to increased secretion of TNF-α and NO. Evidence
  also exists that reactive oxygen species upregulate and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  initiating release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 from their pro-forms
  subsequent to cleavage by caspase-1 (iv). Induction of mitochondrial superoxide
  by rotenone, measurement of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species by MitoSOX, and
  scavenging of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species by MitoTEMPO are three techniques
  commonly used to implicate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation (v). DPI, diphenylene iodonium; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; iNOS, inducible
  nitric oxide synthase; MnTMPyP, Mn(III)tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin; NAC,
  N-acetylcysteine; NO, nitric oxide; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing
  3; SOD, superoxide dismutase; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.
