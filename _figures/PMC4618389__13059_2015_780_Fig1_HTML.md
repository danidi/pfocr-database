caption: Vulture-specific genetic change in immune system. Genes with vulture-specific
  amino acid changes (TNFAIP3, CARD9, TRAF6, MAP3K8, and TBK1) are shown in red (cinereous
  vulture) and blue (turkey vulture) rectangles. Upregulated gene in the cinereous
  vulture (TAB2) is shown in yellow rectangle. A positively selected gene (LY96) in
  the turkey vulture is shown in a light blue rectangle. The pathway was drawn according
  to KEGG pathway (NOD-like receptor and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways). The
  solid lines indicate direct relationships between enzymes and metabolites. The dashed
  lines indicate that more than one step is involved in a process
