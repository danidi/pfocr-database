caption: CsA promotes the invasion of human trophoblast cells via two independent
  signaling pathways, calcium/CaN/NFAT and EGFR/ERK. E-cadherin (labeled as E-cad),
  MMP-2, MMP-9, and titin may function as the downstream targets of EGFR/ERK signaling
  pathway in the CsA-induced invasion of human trophoblast cells. CsA may promote
  the activation of EGFR via CXCL12/CXCR4 axis. EGFR and its downstream ERK signaling
  pathway may also be involved in the CsA-induced proliferation of human trophoblast
  cells. Blue lines represent the signaling pathways proved to be involved in the
  regulation of CsA on the invasion of human trophoblast cells, and red lines represent
  the putative signaling pathways involved in the regulation of CsA on the proliferation
  of trophoblast cells.
