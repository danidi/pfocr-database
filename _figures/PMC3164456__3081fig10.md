caption: 'Proposed wiring diagram of exit from mitosis homologues in A. gossypii;
  based on S. cerevisiae model and minimally reduced by nodes and connections that
  are suggested to be ruled out by experimental data. Of interest, calculated sequence
  identity values for all genes in the system are either particularly high (>70%)
  or rather low (<50%) with no values in between (Supplemental Figure S1). This pattern
  may indicate points of particularly high evolutionary pressure on the system. To
  a certain degree high identity values reflect areas of the network map that are
  likely to be conserved: The only highly conserved FEAR homologues are all part of
  the putative PP2AAgCdc55 phosphatase. Of the MEN, the cascade components AgTem1,
  AgDbf2/Dbf20, and AgMob1 are strongly conserved. During evolution the cellular function
  of this signaling group has largely been modified by altering upstream and downstream
  elements and not the pathway itself.'
