caption: N-glycan synthesis is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the
  en bloc transfer of a lipid-glycan precursor (that is, glucose (Glc)3 mannose (Man)9N-acetylglucosamine
  (GlcNAc)2 bound to dolichol phosphate) to Asp by the multisubunit oligosaccharyltransferase
  (OST). The glucose residues are sequentially removed by two α-glucosidases (α-Glc
  I–II) and an initial Man residue is removed by the ER α-mannosidase (ER α-Man).
  After a quality-control checkpoint, the glycoprotein moves to the Golgi apparatus
  for additional trimming by α-mannosidase I and II (α-Man I–II) and further glycan
  modifications. A cis-to-trans distribution of glycosidases and transferases — GlcNAc-transferase
  I–IV (GnT-I–IV), β1,4 galactosyltransferases (Gal-T), α2,3 sialyltransferase (α2,3,
  Sialyl-T) and α2,6 sialyltransferase (α2,6 Sialyl-T) — facilitates further processing
  by these carbohydrate-modifying enzymes to create a plethora of N-glycoforms that
  often terminate with sialic acid moieties. The final site-specific N-glycan composition
  is affected by the expression levels of glycosyltransferases, the accessibility
  of the glycoprotein glycosylation sites and the length of time during which the
  glycoprotein remains in the ER and Golgi apparatus. Gal, galactose.
