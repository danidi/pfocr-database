caption: Hedgehog signaling pathway. (A) In the absence of hedgehog protein (Hh),
  patched 1 (PTCH1) inhibits smoothened (SMO) and suppressor of fused homolog (SUFU)
  inhibits the GLI transcription factors (GLI) leading to degradation of GLI and blockage
  of target gene transcription. (B) In the presence Hh, the inhibition of PTCH1 on
  SMO is released. SMO inhibits SUFU which releases GLI to move to the nucleus and
  initiates transcription. (C) Advanced basal cell cancers have PTCH1 mutations in
  approximately 70% of tumors as compared with 30% in metastatic basal cell cancer
  while SMO mutations are present in 10%–20% of tumors [, , ] (Table ). PTCH1 and
  SMO mutations activate the Hedgehog pathway. PTCH1 mutations inactivate PTCH1 hence
  abrogating its inhibitory effect on SMO. SMO mutations directly activate SMO. Both
  PTCH1 and SMO mutations result in inhibition of SUFU which then allows GLI-mediated
  transcription of target genes. In the presence of SMO inhibitors (vismodegib, sonidegib,
  saridegib), SUFU remains active and inhibits the GLI transcription factors, leading
  to degradation of GLI and blockage of target gene transcription. Itraconazole and
  arsenic trioxide inhibit the downstream effector GLI.
