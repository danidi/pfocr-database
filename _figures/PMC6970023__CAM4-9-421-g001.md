caption: Concept of the tubal precursors. Some secretory cells in the fimbria exhibit
  expanded growth, leading to secretory cell outgrowth (SCOUT), and are likely to
  undergo genotoxic oxidative stress, probably due to exposure to follicular fluid
  at the time of ovulation. The DNA damage response will then be induced by activating
  the p53 pathway, leading to subsequent activation of ATM/ATR signaling and cell
  cycle arrest. Thus, p53 signature is characterized as negative for Ki‐67 or MIB1
  staining. Genotoxic stress or some other factors in p53 signature cells induces
  or causes p53 gene mutation, leading to the development of serous tubal intraepithelial
  lesions (STILs) and serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC)
