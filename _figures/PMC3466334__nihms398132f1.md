caption: 'Glycolytic cancer cells convert glucose into pyruvate, which can then be
  oxidized in the mitochondria or converted into lactate. Cells containing enhanced
  expression of the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), either as the result
  of genomic amplification of its gene on chromosome 1p12 or through other mechanisms,
  divert 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) away from glycolysis into the serine/glycine biosynthetic
  pathway (red arrows), which generates a number of important metabolic intermediates.
  Along this pathway, transamination of 3-phospho-hydroxypyruvate (3-POHpyr) by the
  enzyme phosphoserine aminotransferase-1 (PSAT1) generates α-ketoglutarate (α-KG),
  which can then be oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Serine and glycine
  are used to produce glutathione, proteins, nucleic acids, phospholipids and sphingolipids,
  and other molecules required for cell growth and proliferation. Abbreviations: Ac-coA,
  acetyl-coA; Cit, citrate; Isocit, isocitrate; Succ, succinate; Fum, fumarate; Mal,
  malate; OAA, oxaloacetate; NAD, nicotine adenine dinucleotide.'
