caption: LncRNAs regulate Rho/ROCK signaling in cancer metastasis. MALAT1 facilitates
  the metastasis of osteosarcoma though the RhoA/ROCK pathway and can act as ceRNA
  to inhibit miR-1 by targeting Cdc42, thereby inducing breast cancer cell metastasis.
  XLOC010623 activates the TIAM1/Rac1 and RhoA/ROCK2 signaling pathways and then increases
  the expression of vinculin, leading to the migration of adipose tissue–derived stem
  cells. SchLAH physically inhibits the migration of HCC cells through RhoA and Rac1.
  MEG3 downregulates Rac1 expression and is linked to primary thyroid cancer with
  lymph node metastasis. AFAP1-AS1 might promote NPC and HCC metastasis through RhoA/Rac2
  signaling. TDRG1 induces RhoC expression and tumor progression in EOC. ABHD11-AS1
  can directly bind to RhoC and upregulate the expression of its downstream molecule
  MMP2, thus increasing the metastatic ability of EOC
