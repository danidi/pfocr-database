caption: EVs cause changes in the mitochondrial function of the receptor cells by
  releasing the contents to the target cells, thus changing the fate of the cells.
  (1) EVs and their active molecules enhance the glycolysis of recipient cells by
  binding PHD2 and preventing the degradation of HIF-1α, which inhibits TCA cycle
  by inducing PDK1 that inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity; (2) EVs activate
  PGC-1α by directly targeting or through AMPK, which promotes mitochondrial biogenesis
  by interacting with PPARγ, ERRs, or NRF; (3) EVs activate AMPK, which regulates
  mitophagy and mitochondrial fission by activating ULK1 and directly phosphorylates
  MFF through DRP1, respectively; (4) EVs affect endoplasmic reticulum stress through
  Fas ligand receptor pathway, which promotes the production of mitochondrial ROS
  and ultimately affects mitochondrial function. In addition, mROS is regulated by
  mitochondrial metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fission and fusion
  and mitophagy, and mROS can also regulate AMPK activation. MFN1/2 mitofusin 1/2,
