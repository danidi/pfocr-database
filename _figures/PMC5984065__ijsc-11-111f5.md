caption: TGF-β induces Smad2 Phosphorylation, ARE Induction, and Trophoblast Differentiation
  Diagrammatic representation of the TGF-β signaling pathway in SM10 growth inhibition
  and trophoblast differentiation. The ligand, TGF-β, binds to cognate receptors and
  triggers activation via the TGF-β Type I receptor (ALK-5) to induce the phosphorylation
  of Smad2. Phospho-Smad2, via classically presumptive Smad 4 binding, triggers the
  transactivation of ARE response elements in target genes that inhibit cell growth
  and promote labyrinthine trophoblast differentiation. Smad 7 acts as a classical
  negative feedback inhibitor for the TGF-β signaling pathway.
