caption: 'Illustration representing the interaction of several pathogens with the
  intestinal epithelium and resident immune cells, and their contribution to the development
  of post-infectious-irritable bowel syndrome. A: Giardia duodenalis disrupts tight
  junctional proteins in the epithelium, in addition to resulting in a decrease in
  5-HT-producing enterochromaffin cells; B: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium
  invades enterocytes and makes its way to resident macrophages, where upon being
  phagocytosed it causes interleukin (IL)-18 release, which further stimulates interferon
  (IFN)-γ release from nearby immune cells, i.e., lamina propria dendritic cells,
  and macrophage pyroptosis. This pathogen is also able to disrupt the resident microbiota;
  C: Campylobacter jejuni causes disruptions in TLR9 signaling to make epithelial
  cells more susceptible (would sensitive apply here instead of susceptible) even
  to mild pro-inflammatory cytokines. It also activates the NF-κB pathway to result
  in an IL-1β and IL-8 release. C. jejuni has also been shown, particularly in cases
  of post infectious (Pi)-IBS, to cause a reduction of resident CD68+ macrophages;
  D: Shigella flexneri crosses the epithelium through the M cell and is taken up resident
  macrophages, where it causes IL-1β and IL-18 release, and pyroptosis in these macrophages.
  S. flexneri has also been associated with increased number of mast cells, secretions
  of which MCT can activate the enteric nervous system; E: EPEC results in TNF-α,
  IFN-γ, and IL-1β release via NF-κB and ERK-1/2 activation. Both EPEC and EHEC result
  in MLCK-dependent tight junctional disruption. Intriguingly, G. duodenalis (A) and
  C. jejuni (C) have been implicated in the modification of the intestinal microbiota;
  however, the effects of this modification remain unclear[]. A variety of combinations
  of these factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of PI-IBS. MCT: Mass cell tryptase.'
