caption: Hepcidin expression via bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-SMAD signaling pathway
  in hepatocytes. High iron concentration in plasma increases transferrin saturation,
  which results in homeostatic iron regulator protein (HFE) detachment from the transferrin
  receptor (TFRC)/HFE complex, then its interaction with ALK3 (BMP receptor), which
  leads to increased expression of ALK3 and activation of the BMP-SMAD signaling pathway.
  High plasma iron also causes stabilization of TFR2, which is associated with HFE,
  and may also interact with ALK3 (but this is not confirmed). Hemojuvelin (HJV) is
  a co-receptor for BMP, and TMPRSS6 protein cleaves HJV acting as an inhibitor of
  HJV expression.
