caption: '(a) The trigeminal system as an example of CGRP-containing nerve fibres
  and its neuronal and vascular interaction sites. By means of diffusion of H2S or
  NO, produced either in the endothelium or in neurons, there are several possibilities
  of their reaction leading to formation of HNO that targets the cysteines of TRPA1
  in close vincinity. (b) TRPA1/CGRP expressing nerve endings in the periphery communicate
  with the smooth muscle cells surrounding the endothelium of blood vessels. Endothelial
  cells are known to produce NO and H2S, both of which freely diffuse and activate
  guanylyl cyclase and KATP channels, respectively, to induce vasodilatation. However,
  H2S and NO also react with each other to give HNO, which could reach paravascular
  TRPA1-expressing sensory nerve fibres, inducing Ca2+ influx and CGRP release. (c)
  Other potential sites of NO–H2S interaction in neurons: (i) TRPA1 channels are co-expressed
  with nNOS and CBS in primary afferents forming a functional signalling complex that
  leads to confined HNO generation and TRPA1 gating upon activation of the gasotransmitter-generating
  enzymes. In addition, NO (ii) or H2S (iii) could originate from either side of a
  synaptic cleft (or from nearby axons of passage) and freely diffuse into adjacent
  neurons (or nerve fibres). There, they react with their counterpart producing HNO
  in vicinity of TRPA1, which leads to its activation, Ca2+ influx and release of
  CGRP. Apart from its vascular functions, CGRP acts as a co-transmitter, facilitating
  synaptic transmission, which may play a role in migraine headaches. Glu, glutamate;
  SC, satellite cells.'
