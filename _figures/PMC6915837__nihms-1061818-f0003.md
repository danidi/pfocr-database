caption: Redesigned malonyl-CoA biosensor. (A) Scheme showing a previous synthetic
  gene circuit regulated by IPTG and mCoA. (B) Scheme showing a redesigned synthetic
  gene circuit regulated only by mCoA. At low levels of mCoA, FapR binds to its cognate
  operator and represses transcription. At increased levels, mCoA binds to FapR and
  causes a conformational change, allowing transcription of a fluorescent reporter
  gene. IPTG, isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside; lacI, E. coli lactose repressor;
  T7, bacteriophage T7 promoter; lacO, lacI repressor binding site; RBS, ribosome
  binding site; fapR, B. subtilis fatty acid biosynthetic pathway repressor; fapO,
  FapR repressor binding site; eGFP, enhanced GFP; mCoA, malonyl-CoA; ProfapR/sfGFP,
  constituitive lac promoters; sfGFP, superfolder GFP.
