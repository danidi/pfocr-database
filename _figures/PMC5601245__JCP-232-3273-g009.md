caption: Hypothetical mechanism of the inhibitory effect of TNF‐α in monocyte cultures.
  (a) When monocytes are cultured in the presence of M‐CSF and RANKL (control), RANKL
  binds to RANK expressed on the membrane, up‐regulates NFATc1, and results in the
  stimulation of the osteoclastogenesis signaling pathway, leading to osteoclast differentiation.
  (b) When monocytes are cultured with M‐CSF, RANKL and TNF‐α, RANKL/RANK signaling
  is not triggered properly, leading to a down‐regulation of NFAcT1 and TRAcP and
  an inhibition of osteoclast formation. (c) When monocytes are incubated first with
  M‐CSF and RANKL for 3 days, RANK signaling is triggered. The addition of TNF‐α stimulates
  osteoclastogenesis
