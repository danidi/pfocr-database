caption: 'Treg activation: CBA (H-2k) mice were injected with CTLA-4-DCs from CBK
  mice (CBA mice expressing MHC class I, Kb transgene). Presentation of Kb determinants
  by self-MHC class II Ak/Ek (indirect presentation), in the absence of proper costimulation,
  leads to activation/expansion of some CD4+regulatory T cells (Tregs). Teff suppression:
  Upon adoptive transfer, Tregs recognizing Ak/Ek-Kb peptide complexes presented on
  (B6 x BALB/c) F1 donor cells (indirect pathway) suppress the alloresponse of CBA
  CD4+ effector T cells (Teff) recognizing donor MHC class II Ab molecules (direct
  pathway) presented on the same F1 APCs (three cell model). Teff suppression is mediated
  via IL-10 and TGFβ and potentially some cognate interactions between Tregs and Teff
  (T-T interaction).'
