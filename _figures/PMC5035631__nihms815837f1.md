caption: 'After acute consumption, fructose is efficiently metabolized by ketohexokinase
  (KHK) into fructose 1-phosphatase. Fructose 1-phosphate has only one pathy: cleavage
  by aldolase B (AldoB) into dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldhyde.
  The latter is phosphorylated by dihydroxyacetone kinase-2 (DAK) to provide glyceraldhyde
  3-phosphate. In contrast, glucose 6-phosphatae can be used for glycogen synthesis,
  glycolysis or enter the pentose phosphate pathway. The triose-phosphates formed
  from fructolysis (or glycolysis) can resynthesized into hexoses for glycogen synthesis
  or further metabolized into acetyl CoA, which can be oxidized or used for lipogenesis.
  Fructose metabolism augments glycogen synthesis from glucose via activating glucokinase
  (GCK). Additionally, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) produced from either direct phosphorylation
  of glucose, or indirect resynthesis from triose phosphates can allosterically activate
  glycogen synthase (GYS2). Other abbreviations: PKLR: Pyruvate Kinase-Liver/Red Blood
