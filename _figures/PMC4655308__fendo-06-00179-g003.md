caption: Model of the intracellular mechanism of GnIH and its receptor (GPR147) that
  control male aggressive behavior by regulating the activity of aromatase and neuroestrogen
  synthesis in the brain. GPR147 is expressed in aromatase immunoreactive cells in
  the brain. GPR147 is coupled to Gαi protein that inhibits the activity of adenylate
  cyclase (AC) and decreases cAMP production and the activity of protein kinase A
  (PKA). Inhibition of AC/cAMP/PKA pathway may decrease phosphorylated aromatase and
  increase dephosphorylated aromatase. 17β-Estradiol (E2) synthesized from testosterone
  (T) by aromatase in the brain especially in the preoptic area (POA) regulates male
  aggression. The administration of GnIH activates aromatase by decreasing phosphorylated
  aromatase and stimulates neuroestrogen synthesis in the brain. GnIH may inhibit
  aggressive behavior by directly activating aromatase and increasing neuroestrogen
  synthesis in the brain beyond its optimum concentration for the expression of aggressive
  behavior. Partially adapted from Ubuka and Tsutsui ().
