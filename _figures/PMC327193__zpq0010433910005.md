caption: Proposed role of RAS mutations in MPD and AML. Our results and other human
  and murine data support the idea that initiating events that result in hyperactive
  Ras induce MPD (upper pathway). Transcription factor (TF) fusions are detected in
  some cases of CML at the time of evolution to blast crisis. Other acquired mutations
  are likely to exist as well. By contrast, leukemia-associated TF fusions may initiate
  AML by perturbing cell fates but appear to require a cooperating mutation that drives
  proliferation to cause overt disease. Here, oncogenic RAS (or activated FLT3) represent
  secondary mutations that contribute to leukemogenesis (lower pathway). The ability
  of oncogenic RAS to either initiate disease or cooperate with preexisting genetic
  lesions is likely to account for the finding of RAS mutations in myeloid malignancies
  with distinct phenotypes.
