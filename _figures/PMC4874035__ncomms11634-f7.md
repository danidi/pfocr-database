caption: Our schematic diagram of a WT LG with the PSC in red, the MZ in green and
  the CT in grey. Slit from the CT activates the Robo signalling pathway in the PSC.
  Robo signalling controls PSC cell clustering and proliferation. Proposed interactions
  between Robos, bone morphogenetic protein/decapentaplegic (BMP/Dpp) signalling,
  DE-cadherin and Cdc42 activity for the control of PSC cell proliferation and clustering
  are indicated. Dlp expression in the PSC is also controlled by Collier/Knot (Col/kn)
  transcription factor, and Wint/Wingless (Wnt/Wg) signalling activates dmyc expression.
