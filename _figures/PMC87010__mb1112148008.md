caption: Role of the Rfc4-Rpa1 interaction in DNA replication and DNA damage checkpoint
  signaling. (Left) The DNA polymerase switch during lagging-strand synthesis is shown.
  The model proposes that a direct interaction between Rpa1N, bound to the lagging
  strand, and Rfc4 is required to target RFC to the primer-template junction. Bound
  RFC then displaces polymerase α, loads the PCNA sliding clamp, and allows processive
  DNA synthesis by polymerase δ. This reaction fails in the presence of Rfc4-2 and
  Rfa1-Y29H, resulting in synthetic lethality. (Right) The DNA damage response at
  a UV-induced lesion is shown. Again, a direct interaction between Rpa1N, bound at
  the processed lesion, and Rfc4 is required to target the Rad24–Rfc2-5 complex to
  the primer-template junction. This complex loads the Rad17-Mec3-Ddc1 sliding clamp
  and activates the signal transduction pathway. This reaction is compromised in the
  presence of either Rfc4-2 or Rpa1-Y29H, resulting in partially defective checkpoint
  signaling.
