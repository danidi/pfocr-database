caption: The ClueGo analysis of clustered proteins within each GO node for biological
  process interaction and signalling pathway analysis involved in the VPA treated
  cells. Node sizes are relative to number of proteins in dataset identified in that
  GO. Coloured nodes and labels represent important GO terms in the network.
