caption: Putative scheme for the MKK7/JNK signaling pathway. The MKK7/JNK signaling
  axis can be triggered by cytokines, stress stimuli, growth factors, and hormones/neurotransmitters.
  This stimulation promotes the incorporation of an MKK7/JNK scaffold that mediates
  the phosphorylation of MAP3Ks (such as MEKK3, MLK2, MLK3, DLK, and ASK1), phosphorylates
  MKK7, and then phosphorylates the JNK kinases. These signaling cascades have been
  implicated in regulating various physiological functions, including programmed cell
  death, inflammation, cell differentiation, and growth/cell cycle arrest.
