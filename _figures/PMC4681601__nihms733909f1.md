caption: 'The high expression of active IDO1 leads to a commensurately high rate of
  tryptophan conversion and depletion. This induces cell cycle arrest and/or anergy
  in the effector cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) compartment via the eIF2a kinase-dependent
  GCN2 pathway. Simultaneously, this mechanism also contributes to the activation/maturation
  of Treg in association with CTLA4-mediated CD80/CD86 co-inhibition. Kynurenine (Kyn)
  directly induces the apoptosis of CTL by an uncharacterized mechanism, while interacting
  with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in naïve CD4+ T cells, resulting in the
  induction of FoxP3+ iTreg. AhR interacts with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear
  translocator (ARNT) to mediate the specific transcriptional programming. Coincidently,
  IDO1 non-enzymatically enforces immunosuppression through two intrinsic immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) in antigen presenting cells (APC). TGF-β
  signaling results in the phosphorylation of the IDO1 ITIM, triggering non-canonical
  NF-κB activation and phosphorylation of IKKα, followed by nuclear translocation
  of the NF-κB subunits, p52 and RelB and autocrine reinforcement of IDO1 and TGF-β
  expression. The high affinity Trp transporter is expressed by APC and tumor cells,
  with the majority of agonists leading to IDO1 activity demonstrated in APC. Similarly,
  the oncogene, c-KIT, and tumor-suppressor gene, Bin1, as well as the IL-6/AhR/STAT-3
  signaling loop, have also been shown to impact the regulation of IDO1 in tumor cells.

  contributes to Treg activation, promoting the disabling and/or apoptosis of CTL,
  thereby supporting tumor outgrowth by virtue of an unproductive antitumor response.
