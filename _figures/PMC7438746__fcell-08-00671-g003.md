caption: Indirect transcriptional control by AMPK through metabolites of intermediary
  metabolism. (a) Intermediary metabolism of glucose, fatty acids and ketogenic amino
  acids leads to the formation of acetyl-CoA. By regulating glycolysis and fatty acid
  oxidation AMPK may determine cellular acetyl-CoA levels. Histone acetyltransferases
  (HATs) use acetyl-CoA to transfer acetyl group to nucleosomal histones. (b) α ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase subunit E2 (α-KGDH) complex binds to lysine acetyltransferase 2A (KAT2A).
  α-KGDH synthesizes succinyl CoA locally and KAT2A succinylates histone H3 on lysine
  79 (H3K79). AMPK regulates TCA cycle thereby may influence this process. (c) NAD
  generated in the mitochondrial electron transport chain acts as a cofactor for SIRT1
  and SIRT6 which deacetylates histone H3K9/14 and H3K9/56, respectively. (d) α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG), generated through TCA cycle acts as a cofactor for lysine demethylases (KDM)
  and ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. TETs oxidize 5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine
  in genomic DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC), and
  5-formylcytosine (5fC) that is involved in epigenetic regulation. FAD generated
  in the mitochondrial electron transport chain acts as a cofactor for KDMs. (e) AMPK
  potentially regulates the hexosamine pathway by providing precursors. UDP-GlcNAc
  is derived from glycolysis and glutamine, the latter being generated by transamination
  of α ketoglutarate. O-GlcNAcyltransferase (OGT) transfers GlcNAc residues to various
  nuclear proteins including TETs and histone 2B (H2B), OCT4 and SOX2 to control transcription.
