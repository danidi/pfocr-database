caption: Top Networks Associated With MK-801 Treatment Identified by Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis. Protein symbols with red were upregulated while green were downregulated.
  Hub proteins not significantly altered in this study are shown as clear. (A) The
  merged network of 2 top networks associated with 7-day MK-801 treatment. (B) The
  top network associated with 21-day MK-801 treatment.
