caption: 'Cdk5 regulates actin dynamics by phosphorylating multiple upstream regulators
  (left panel) and downstream targets of Rac GTPase (right panel): Similar to RhoA,
  Cdk5 can either activate or inhibit the Rac1 pathway using alternate substrates,
  thereby controlling both actin polymerization and depolymerization. Cdk5 activates
  Rac signaling via its upstream regulator kalirin-7, but inhibits it by phosphorylating
  other upstream regulators—neurabin-1 and RasGRF2 (left panel). Cdk5 also regulates
  Rac signaling by phosphorylating its downstream effectors— Pak1 and WAVE1. Pak1
  activates LIMK1 kinase, which inactivates cofilin, resulting in actin polymerization.
  Cdk5 reverses this regulation by inactivating Pak1 via phosphorylation, resulting
  in LIMK1 inhibition and cofilin activation, promoting actin depolymerization. Cdk5
  phosphorylates Rac effector WAVE1, which inhibits its activity, resulting in decreased
  spine density. In contrast, PP2A and PP2B-mediated dephosphorylation of WAVE1 increases
  its activity, leading to enhanced spine density. Red and green circles show activating
  and inactivating phosphorylation, respectively. Red and green arrows represent activating
  and inactivating pathways, respectively'
