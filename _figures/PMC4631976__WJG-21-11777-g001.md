caption: Death resistance signaling in cancer cells. Programmed cell death (i.e.,
  apoptosis and necroptosis) are either triggered extrinsically by cytotoxic stimuli
  through death receptors, or initiated intrinsically via mitochondria dysfunction
  caused by metabolic and hypoxic stress. In the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF) or Fas binding to the receptors trigger the recruitment of
  adaptor molecules to form a death-inducing signaling complex which contains TNF
  receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), Fas-associated death domain (FADD), procaspase
  8/FLICE, and receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) to facilitate the activation
  of caspase 8. Caspase 8 then cleaves and activates caspase 3 (the final caspase
  in the apoptotic pathways), and it also truncates Bid and RIPK1. The intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. The ratio of Bcl-2 superfamily
  proteins, including anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, and pro-apoptotic Bad, Bid,
  Bax, Bim and PUMA, determines the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore. The truncated form tBid cleaved by caspase-8 can migrate to the mitochondria
  to associate with Bax to increase membrane permeability. The drop of mitochondrial
  transmembrane potential leads to osmotic swelling and release of cytochrome c to
  complex with Apaf-1 and procaspase 9 which undergo cleavage into the active form
  of caspase 9. Caspase 9 and/or caspase-8 activates caspase-3, and ultimately leads
  to nuclear DNA fragmentation. Moreover, FLICE-like proteins (FLIP) and inhibitors
  to apoptosis proteins (IAPs), including cIAP, survivin and XIAP, provide a brake
  on the apoptotic cascade. In cancers, signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MEK/ERK,
  IKK/IκB/NFκB and HIF regulate apoptosis by modulating Bcl-2 members and altering
  expression of FLIP and IAPs. In the extrinsic necroptotic pathway, stimulus of TNFα
  in the presence of a caspase inhibitor frees RIPK1 to form a complex with RIPK3
  for auto- and trans-phosphorylation, which then recruits and phosphorylates MLKL.
  The RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL complex causes mitochondrial dysfunction and executes subcellular
  features of necroptosis, such as lysosomal membrane degradation, cytosol vacuolation,
  plasma membrane disintegration, and ultimately cellular explosion. In the intrinsic
  necroptotic pathway, metabolic and hypoxic stress induces the mitochondrial production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, which subsequently leads to
  RIPK1/3 activation and the final steps of necroptosis. However, signaling pathways
  to regulate necroptosis has not yet been reported.
