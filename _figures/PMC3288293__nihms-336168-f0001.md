caption: Molecular mechanism of senescence. Induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  induces mitochondrial breakdown as well as double stranded breaks. Activation of
  p16 and p53 induce growth arrest at G1/S and activation of NFkB leads to increased
  expression of cytokines and chemokines. Telomere shortening involved in aging or
  under stress conditions could result in double stranded breaks. ROS production as
  well as aging induced stress responses could be blocked by sirtuins, NAD dependent
  protein deacetylases []. Aggregates and crystals of denatured proteins (as in β
  amyloid crystals in Alzeimer’s disease) are visualized in the endoplasmic reticulum.
  Lipofuscin (Lf), a brown pigment consisting of insoluble membrane free protein aggregates,
  formed due to ROS and stress inhibits normal autophagy as well as proteosomal pathway
  of protein recycling machinery. Calorie restriction (CR) and sirtuins (SIRT) inhibit
  the effects of ROS and senescence.  Activation  Inhibition
