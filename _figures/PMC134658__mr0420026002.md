caption: Schematic representation of the known regulatory controls governing the expression
  of the E. coli acrAB and tolC genes. The AcrAB-TolC transport complex extrudes drugs
  across both the cytoplasmic (CM) and outer (OM) membranes (pale yellow shaded boxes).
  Excessive production of AcrA and AcrB is prevented (−) by the local dimeric repressor
  protein AcrR (green), whereas a regulatory protein involved in cell division, SdiA
  (grey), can increase (+) acrAB expression. However, activation of acrAB and tolC
  transcription occurs primarily because of the global regulatory proteins MarA, SoxS,
  and Rob (purple), any one of which can bind to a marbox (cyan) upstream of these
  genes. The intracellular level of MarA is controlled by MarR (red), a dimeric protein
  which binds to marO (orange) and represses (−) the expression of its own gene and
  the two others that constitute the marRAB operon. Binding of inducing compounds
  (diamonds) such as salicylate by MarR, in addition to the possible phosphorylation
  of MarR via a putative signal transduction pathway involving the periplasmic binding
  protein MppA, is proposed to transform MarR into a non-DNA-binding conformation,
  thereby permitting marRAB transcription to proceed. Hence, MarA protein is produced
  which can then bind as a monomer to the marO marbox upstream of the marRAB promoter,
  where it activates (+) transcription of marRAB and enhances the production of MarA.
  The ensuing highly elevated intracellular levels of MarA can then bind to marboxes
  adjacent to the promoters of mar regulon genes, such as acrAB and tolC, and activate
  their transcription. The MarA homologs SoxS and Rob can also bind to the marO marbox
  and activate marRAB transcription. The positive regulation by all three proteins
  on marRAB is enhanced by FIS (yellow), an accessory activating protein. SoxS is
  only produced upon conversion of the SoxR effector protein (magenta) into its active
  form (SoxR*) by superoxide-generating agents (O2−). Rob, like SoxS, in addition
  to mediating increases in MarA synthesis, can also directly activate the expression
  of some genes that belong to the mar regulon, such as acrAB. The regulatory-protein-binding
  sites within marO are shown in finer detail in the bottom left corner. The positions
  of the −35 and −10 hexamers of the marRAB promoter, the ribosome-binding site (RBS)
  and transcription start points (tsps) for the marRAB operon are indicated. See text
  for other details. (Modified with permission from reference .)
