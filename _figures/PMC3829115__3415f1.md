caption: Schematic overview of TF signaling complexes. The TF–FVIIa binary signaling
  complex signals via PAR2, whereas the ternary TF–FVIIa–FXa coagulation signaling
  complex activates both PAR2 and PAR1. TF pathway inhibitor inhibits the coagulation
  and signaling function of the ternary complex. Thrombin signals through PAR1 to
  induce inflammatory responses. Binding of aPC to EPCR switches the specificity of
  PAR1–thrombin signaling to mediate protective anti-inflammatory responses. Antibody
  10H10 targets the TF–FVIIa binary signaling complex and disrupts the TF–integrin
  interaction.
