caption: Cell migration and focal adhesion disassembly. (A) Migrating cells establish
  front–rear polarity in response to migration-inducing cues. At the front of the
  cell, branched actin networks support leading-edge lamellipodia protrusions, which
  are stabilized by the formation of nascent adhesions that mediate integrin-dependent
  cell–ECM contact. Nascent adhesions rapidly disassemble through unclear mechanisms,
  or alternatively, linkage of nascent adhesions to actin stress fibers results in
  maturation to stable focal adhesions, which transmit the forces generated by the
  actin cytoskeleton to promote forward motility (see B for detailed structural information).
  Focal adhesions disassemble through multiple mechanisms to allow for efficient cell
  displacement. Microtubules serve as tracks for both the exocytic and endocytic pathways
  that contribute to focal adhesion disassembly. Exocytic vesicles transport and enable
  secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) near to focal adhesions to promote
  localized cleavage of ECM. This pathway of proteolysis disrupts the linkage between
  integrins and the ECM, leading to focal adhesion turnover. Endocytosis of integrins
  also compromises the stable architecture of focal adhesions by directly weakening
  their interaction with the ECM through removal of integrins. Autophagic sequestration
  of focal adhesion components also facilitates focal adhesion disassembly by sequestering
  focal adhesion proteins away from focal adhesions. Focal adhesion disassembly is
  also induced by calpain-mediated cleavage of the focal adhesion protein talin (of
  which there are two isoforms), which connects integrins to the actin cytoskeleton.
  Finally, signaling mediated by the focal-adhesion-associated kinase FAK and cytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinases, such as Src, also promotes focal adhesion disassembly, although
  the molecular details of this pathway have not been elucidated. (B) Focal adhesions
  are multiprotein complexes comprising integrins and scaffolding and signaling proteins.
  Integrins interact directly with the ECM. Intracellularly, focal adhesion proteins
  interact with each other, and they directly bind to the cytoplasmic tails of integrins
  (e.g. paxillin, FAK and talin) and/or actin fibers (e.g. talin, vinculin, zyxin).
  Together, these interactions form a stable connection spanning the plasma membrane
  from the intracellular actin cytoskeleton to the ECM that anchors the cell to its
  substratum. Multiple mechanisms (boxed text) disrupt this stable structure of focal
  adhesions to promote their disassembly (see A for details) by interfering with the
  connection between focal adhesion proteins and actin or the connection between integrins
  and the ECM.
