caption: The functions of natural IgM in homeostasis maintenance and autoimmune diseases
  prevention; (A) sIgM enhances apoptotic cell clearance. sIgM binds to apoptotic
  cells thereby forming antigen:antibody complexes. C1q binds to the Fc portion of
  sIgM. This leads to the activation of the classical complement pathway Complement
  Receptors (CR) on phagocytes (macrophages (MQs), dendritic cells (DCs)) can bind
  to C3b on the immune complexes which triggers their uptake. (B) sIgM prevents the
  escape of harmful autoreactive B cells during development and selection in the bone
  marrow and periphery, apparently by enhancing BCR signaling. The absence of sIgM
  affects all stages of B-cell development and leads to the development of a peripheral
  B-cell compartment that contains increased self-reactive and anergic CD5+ B cells
  as well as shifts in the composition of the mature B-cell compartment.
