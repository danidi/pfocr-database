caption: NAD+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS), including H2O2, accumulate during
  inflammation and tissue damage. External NAD+ may be converted to ADPR, cADPR and
  NAADP by the ectoenzymes CD38 and CD157. Extracellular ADPR may then bind to plasma
  membrane receptors (e.g. P2Y receptors) and increases [Ca2+]i through Ca2+ release
  from stores via G-proteins and phospholipase C (PLC) activation with subsequent
  IP3 production. H2O2 may also cross the plasma membrane and mobilize ADPR from mitochondria
  (both H2O2 and cADPR can synergize with ADPR to activate TRPM2). ADPR is also generated
  from poly-ADPR during ROS-induced DNA damage through activation of the PARP-1/PARG
  pathway. Free cytosolic ADPR will act on the NUDT9-H of lysosomal and plasma membrane
  TRPM2 channels, enabling Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane and/or release of
  lysosomal Ca2+, raising the Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol. Ca2+ overload can
  trigger programmed cell death (apoptosis) and possibly necrosis. Finally, extracellular
  signals that remain to be identified could potentially induce the production of
  intracellular free ADPR, which may then gate TRPM2 channels in the lysosome and/or
  plasma membrane and regulate receptor-mediated signalling.
