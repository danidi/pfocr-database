caption: It appears that high RNF125 expression upregulates TGF-β1, SMAD3 and ID1
  expression in RNF125 downstream; on the one hand, upregulated TGF-β1, SMAD3 and
  ID1 strengthens EMT process by activating TGF-β1-SMAD3-ID1 signaling pathway, accelerating
  the invasion, migration and adhesion of GBC cells; on the other hand, highly expressed
  TGF-β1 and ID1 enhances MET process by activating TGF-β1-ID1 signaling pathway,
  stimulating the colonization of GBC cells; lastly promoting the metastasis and progression
  of GBC cells. Thus, RNF125 promotes the invasion and metastasis of human GBCs via
  activating the TGF-β1-SMAD3-ID1 signaling pathway.
