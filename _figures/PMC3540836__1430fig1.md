caption: 'Experimentally supported and inferred factors of Drosophila triacylglycerol
  synthesis and mobilization at lipid storage droplets. Represented are lipogenic
  enzymes of the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway (blue), lipases (red), and modulatory
  LD-associated proteins of the Perilipin family (green). The predicted function of
  proteins marked by a question mark (?) is largely based on sequence homology to
  functionally characterized mammalian relatives. Note that sequence similarity does
  not necessarily justify evolutionary orthology. An asterisk (*) indicates that in
  vitro evidence supports the involvement of the Manduca sexta CG8552 ortholog MsTGL
  in storage fat mobilization from LDs. For more details on all aspects of the pathways
  see text. ATGL: adipose triglyceride lipase; FA-CoA: fatty acid CoA ester; HSL:
  hormone sensitive lipase; MG: monoacylglycerol; PC: phosphatidylcholine; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PG: phosphatidylglycerol; PI: phosphatidylinositol; PLIN1, 2: Perilipin1, 2; PS:
  phosphatidylserine; TGL: triglyceride lipase.'
