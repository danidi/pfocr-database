caption: Overview of egg activation in Drosophila. Passage of the oocyte through the
  oviduct triggers egg activation. During activation, a single wave of calcium moves
  through the cytoplasm, starting from the poles and moving towards the middle of
  the egg. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ requires an influx of extracellular
  Ca2+, presumably via activation of mechanosensitive channels and a release of Ca2+
  from ER stores. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ leads to activation in Ca2+signaling
  components at egg activation, such as SRA, calcineurin, and potentially CAMKII,
  which then regulate downstream targets. The preparation of the oocyte for the consequent
  Ca2+signaling at egg activation appears to be set up during oocyte maturation, as
  phosphorylation of SRA by GSK3β during late oogenesis is required for proper egg
  activation. Completion of meiosis is linked to the activation of Ca2+signaling in
  the oocyte, and a potential target of this pathway is the APC/C, whose activation
  leads to a decrease in CycB/Cdk1 activity and meiotic progression. As high CycB/Cdk1
  in the mature oocyte leads to inhibitory phosphorylation of GNU, an activating subunit
  of the PNG complex, the decrease of CycB/Cdk1 levels at activation allows for dephosphorylation
  of GNU, which then binds and activates the PNG complex. The PNG complex then mediates
  translational control of many maternal mRNAs during egg activation. At activation,
  changes to the cytoskeleton and crosslinking of the vitelline membrane also ensue
  (not depicted).
