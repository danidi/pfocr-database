caption: Proposed mechanisms for the action of ACF on melanoma cells under normoxic
  conditions. (A) This picture reproduces the adaptation of melanoma cells to physiological
  concentrations of glucose. Restriction of glucose availability to physiological
  concentrations induces the production of ROS [], which activate HIF-1α []. Activated
  HIF-1α induces glycolysis upregulation in cancer cells, a phenomenon known as the
  Warburg effect []. Thus, by increasing the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, the
  Warburg effect reduces ROS production by the mitochondrial OXPHOS. Activated AKT
  pathway contributed to glucose transport through GLUT1 plasmatic membrane translocation
  and activation of HIF-1α. ACF, by inhibiting HIF-1α, impedes PDK1 transcription,
  resulting in enhanced ROS production. In this metabolic scenario, ACF blocks the
  PI3K/PDPK1 pathway, resulting in impaired phosphorylation of AKT. Consistently with
  our results (A), inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by ACF would also result in reduced
  expression of HIF-1α [] under normoxic conditions. Red arrows indicate favored pathways
  in the presence of ACF. (B) Increased ROS levels induces ER stress, leading to the
  UPR []. Although ACF induces the phosphorylation of eIF2α, this is not traduced
  in elevated expression of ATF4. Since protein stability of ATF4 is dependent of
  an operative PDPK1/RSK2 pathway [], ACF induces the destabilization of ATF4 and,
  therefore, the inactivation of ATF4-adaptative pathways.
