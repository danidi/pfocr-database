caption: Schematic summarizing CRF and glucocorticoid effects on the β-adrenoceptor–cAMP
  signaling pathway in the basolateral amygdala in influencing memory consolidation.
  Norepinephrine (NE) is released after training in emotionally arousing tasks and
  binds to both β-adrenoceptors and α1-adrenoceptors at postsynaptic sites. The β-adrenoceptor
  is coupled directly to adenylate cyclase to stimulate cAMP formation. The α1-adrenoceptor
  is known to modulate the response induced by β-adrenoceptor stimulation. CRF may
  also facilitate the β-adrenoceptor–cAMP response, but independently from the α1-adrenoceptor-induced
  modulation. Glucocorticoids enhance memory consolidation via a synergistic interaction
  with both the CRF and α1-adrenoceptor systems in potentiation training-induced β-adrenoceptor–cAMP
  activation. Other studies have demonstrated that cAMP may initiate a cascade of
  intracellular events involving the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).
  Our findings suggest that these effects in the basolateral amygdala are required
  for regulating memory consolidation in other brain regions. α1, α1-Adrenoceptor;
  α2, α2-adrenoceptor; AC, adenylate cyclase; β, β-adrenoceptor; CRF-R, corticotropin-releasing
  factor receptor.
