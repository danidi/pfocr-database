caption: Mechanism of circRNAs activity in tumor metastasis. A. CircRNAs function
  as miRNA sponges to promote the EMT signaling pathway via lowering of E-cadherin
  and increasing N-cadherin and vimentin. B. CircRNAs could recruit demethylase and
  induce DNA demethylation in the CpG islands to promote tumor cell metastasis. C.
  The presence of circRNAs in exosomes might promote tumor metastasis by promoting
  cancer cell’s EMT.
