caption: Simplified sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Ceramide (Cer) is generated through
  the degradation of either Sphingomyelin (SM) or Glycosphingolipids(GLS) by Sphingomyelin
  Phosphodiesterase (SMPD) and GlucosylCeramidase (GBA) respectively. Cer is subsequently
  metabolized by Ceramidase (CDse) to generate Sphingosine (Sph), which in turn produces
  Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) through phosphorylation by Sphingosine Kinase-1 and
  Sphingosine Kinase-2 (SPHK1/2). All these reactions are reversible. S1P can be catabolized
  into hexadecenal and  phospho-ethanolamine by S1P Lyase (SGPL1).
