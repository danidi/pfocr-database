caption: The Notch1 signalling pathway. (A) The binding of Notch1 ligand (DSL) with
  the Notch1 receptor activates two subsequent protease cleavages. Afterward, intracellular
  Notch1 (ICN1) translocates into the nucleus where it interacts with other coactivators
  in a protein complex for the induction of Notch1 target genes. ADAM = A disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase; MAML = mastermind-like protein; MP = metal-loproteinase;
  CSL = CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1 transcription factor complex. (B) The Notch1 signalling pathway
  promotes leukemia stem cell (LSC) activity by upregulation of IGF1R and c-Myc target
  genes and the indirect downregulation of protein kinase C–theta (PKCθ). RUNX3/1
  = runt-related transcription factor 3/1.
