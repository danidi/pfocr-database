caption: Scheme of the preparation pathway of NLG919(IODI)/IR780 coloaded micelles
  and the mechanism by which the NLG919/IR780‐micelle‐mediated PTT combined with immunotherapy
  suppressed the growth of the tumor margin beyond effective PTT and the distal (or
  secondary) tumor. When the tumor was treated with PTT, only several‐millimeter‐deep
  tumor tissue undergoes effective PTT. The remaining tumor tissue (tumor margin)
  undergoes an ineffective PTT, in which HSP, IDO, and PD‐L1 are upregulated, accelerating
  the growth of the tumor margin. Introduction of an IDO inhibitor can combine with
  the PTT, resulting in IDO‐inhibition‐mediated immunomodulation to further suppress
  the growth of the tumor margin beyond effective PTT, as well as distal tumor.
