caption: A. Cancer-Associated overexpression of Hh ligands or mutations in genes such
  as Ptch1 or Smo, which lie upstream of cilia, will only result in activation of
  the Hh pathway by increasing GliA levels if cilia are present. If cilia are present,
  then inhibitors targeting Hh ligand, Smo, and Gli trafficking (grey boxes) will
  be effective. Inhibitors that target Gli activity downstream of cilia (white box)
  will also be effective in reducing the Hh pathway in this context. B. Cancer-associated
  overexpression of Gli1 (GliA) in the presence of cilia will result in low levels
  of Hh pathway activation. In this context, cilia make the repressor form of Gli
  (GliR) counterbalancing GliA to reduce over activation of the Hh pathway. Mutations
  in REN(KCTD11) can also result in increased GliA activity. As this activation is
  downstream of cilia only the downstream Gli targeting inhibitors (white box) are
  predicted to be effective. C. Cancer-associated overexpression of Hh ligands or
  mutations in genes such as Ptch or Smo, which lie upstream of cilia, will not activate
  the Hh pathway in the absence of cilia. D. Cancer-associated mutations downstream
  of cilia such as overexpression of Gli1 (GliA) or mutations in Ren(KCTD11) have
  been documented in cancers and will turn on the Hh pathway in the absence of cilia
  due to high GliA and low GliR. Therefore, only downstream Gli targeting inhibitors
  (white box) are predicted to be effective in this scenario.
