caption: 'Putative Altered Signaling Events occurring upon treatment of GSI. From
  our current understanding: GBM CSCs signals Notch pathway leading to a constitutive
  activation. Sequentially, Notch signaling activates the proliferation and maintenance
  of the undifferentiated CSCs, while suppressing apoptosis and differentiation. Treating
  GBM CSCs with GSI impairs Notch signaling and therefore reverses the above effects,
  which is suggested from our results and previous publications. In addition, NFR2-mediated
  oxidative response and Glycolysis are also suggested to be down-regulated from our
  results possibly due to their crosstalk with Notch signaling.Solid line/arrow indicates
  a conclusion that is drawn based on our results and/or from previous publications
  with higher confidence. Dashed line/arrow indicates our hypothesis. The direction
  of an arrow placed in each node represents up/down-regulation of this protein or
  signaling pathway, while the arrow used to link adjacent nodes represents activation
  and the blunt end represents inhibition. Blue arrow/line indicates the native state
  of GBM CSCs while yellow arrow/line indicates the alterations occurring upon GSI
  treatment. Black arrow indicates the up/down-regulation detected in this study while
  red arrow indicates the ones that have been further validated by orthogonal approaches
  in our experiment.'
