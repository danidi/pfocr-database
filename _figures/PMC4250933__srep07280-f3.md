caption: 'Promotion of vegetative growth can be achieved through two converging pathways:
  Mdf1p binds to the MATα2 protein to cooperatively inhibit haploid-specific genes
  that encode key components of the mating pathway (MAPK pathway) and thereby suppresses
  the mating behavior of budding yeast to limit the cost of mating, as revealed in
  a previous study by our group; and Mdf1p binds to Snf1p to turn off glucose-repressed
  genes and turn on glucose-induced genes, thus enhancing the activity of the glucose
  signaling pathway.'
