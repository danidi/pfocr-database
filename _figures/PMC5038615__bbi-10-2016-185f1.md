caption: 'Biosynthesis pathway of auxin in selected species. (A) The phylogenetic
  relation of the selected 13 members of Viridiplantae. Species: Atha (A. thaliana),
  Gmax (G. max), Mtru (M. truncatula), Ptri (P. trichocarpa), Stub (S. tuberosum),
  Slyc (S. lycopersicum), Vvin (V. vinifera), Bdis (B. distachyon), Osat (O. sativa),
  Sbic (S. bicolor), Zmay (Z. mays), Ppat (P. patens), and Crei (C. reinhardtii).
  The color code indicates the distribution of the different clades demonstrating
  the distance from A. thaliana. The number of genes related to all analyzed phytohormone
  biosynthesis pathways in A. thaliana and of the identified co-orthologues in the
  other species are indicated. (B) Enzymes and intermediate products of the plastidial
  tryptophan biosynthesis pathway (green region) and distinct routes of Trp-dependent
  IAA biosynthesis in plants with IPA (blue region), IAM (yellow region), and TAM,
  IAOX and IAN (red region) as major biosynthesis intermediates. The route using IBA
  as precursor or storage intermediate and pathways of IAA conjugation are shown in
  the gray region. The arrows are colored according to the species in which the enzymes
  were found (taken from A) and multicolor dashed arrows indicate putative loss of
  co-orthologues genes in one clade during evolution.Abbreviations: Proteins: AAO,
  Arabidopsis aldehyde oxidase; AMI, amidase; ASA, anthranilate synthase alpha subunit;
  CYP79B, cytochrome P450, family 79, subfamily B; GH, Gretchen Hagen; IBR, indole-3-butyric
  acid response; ILR1/ILL, IAA-leucine resistant; IAMT, IAA carboxylmethyltransferase;
