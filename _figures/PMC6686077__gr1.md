caption: Glycosylation of a viral glycoprotein in the classical mammalian N-linked
  and mucin-type O-linked pathways. (A) Viral classes containing predominantly enveloped
  and non-enveloped viruses are coloured in blue and grey, respectively. Although
  not enveloped, viruses such as rotaviruses can also exploit the host-glycosylation
  pathways to modify their proteins. (B) Following mRNA synthesis, the mature tri-glucosylated
  N-linked glycan precursor, dolichol-P-P-glycan, is co-translationally transferred
  en bloc by oligosaccharyltransferase to the asparagine residue of an Asn-X-Ser/Thr
  sequon on a nascent polypeptide chain. Following transfer of the precursor glycan
  to the protein, glucosidases in the ER remove the three glucose residues while the
  protein folds in the Calnexin/Calreticulin cycle. A series of ER and Golgi mannosidases
  subsequently cleave mannose residues down to the Man5GlcNAc2 glycan. The action
  of GlcNAc transferase-I (GlcNAcT-I) initiates the first branch of the N-glycan.
  Once α-Mannosidase II removes the two remaining outer mannose residues, other glycan
  processing enzymes such as galactosyl-, fucosyl- and sialyl-transferases, can act
  to construct a huge assortment of complex-type glycans. (C) The mucin-type O-linked
  glycosylation pathway is initiated by a family of ppGalNAc transferases that covalently
  link a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) monosaccharide to any serine, threonine and
  tyrosine residue. Following this conjugation, a series of glycosyltransferases can
  act upon the primary GalNAc residue to generate the four common O-linked glycan
  cores. Each of these cores can be extended and processed further to generate numerous
  mucin-type O-linked glycans. Glycans are presented using Consortium for Functional
  Glycomics symbolic nomenclature and Oxford system linkages [], as per the key.
