caption: Overview of the core JA-signaling pathway. In the absence of JA-Ile, the
  activity of the TFs MYC2/3/4, bound to the G-box of JA-responsive promotors, is
  repressed by interaction with a JAZ protein that binds to the JAZ-interacting domain
  (JID) of MYC2/3/4 through their Jas domain. Upon perception of the hormone (green
  dot) by the co-receptor complex composed of a JAZ protein and the F-box component
  COI1 (SCFCOI1), which is potentiated by inositol pentakisphosphate (InsP5, blue
  dot), the CUL-RING E3 ligase (CRL) binds with SCFCOI1 and ubiquitinates the JAZ
  protein. Subsequently, JAZ proteins are degraded and MYC2/3/4 activate transcription
  of JA-responsive genes eventually resulting in a JA response. Figure adapted from
  Pauwels and Goossens [].
