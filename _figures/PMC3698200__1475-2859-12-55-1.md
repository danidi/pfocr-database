caption: 'The scheme of the central carbon metabolism (CCM, upper panel), with indicated
  genes coding for enzymes involved in particular reactions. Colored backgrounds indicate
  glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (green), pentose phosphate pathway (violet), the overflow
  reactions (gray), and the Krebs cycle (yellow). Lower panel demonstrates the pattern
  of suppressions of effects of mutations in genes coding for replication factors
  in B. subtilis and E. coli by particular mutations in genes coding for CCM enzymes,
  involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) or the overflow
  reactions. In both panels, red color indicates specific suppressions in B. subtilis,
  and blue color indicates specific suppressions in E. coli. Abbreviations: 1,3-BGP,
  1,3-biphosphoglycerate; 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; G3P, galactose-3-phosphate;
  G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; OXA, oxaloacetate; PBP, fructose-1,6-biphosphate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, pyruvate; Ru5P,
  ribulose-5-phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; S7P, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate; E4P,
