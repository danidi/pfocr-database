caption: The metabolic characteristics of a low-carnitine zebrafish model. Purple
  arrows represent as the lipid metabolism flow, green arrows represent as the glucose
  metabolism flow; orange arrows represent as the protein metabolism, black arrows
  represent as the ATP produced from the acetyl-CoA; the red arrows represent as the
  changes in metabolic pathway.
