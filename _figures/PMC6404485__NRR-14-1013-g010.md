caption: 'Schematic showing the role of the Wnt/Frizzled signaling pathway and potential
  mechanisms of the neuroprotective effect on early brain injury.Briefly, the Wnt/Frizzled
  signaling pathway is suppressed after SAH, which is accompanied by markedly decreasing
  Wnt1 protein secretion and expression. Weak interaction between extracellular Wnt1
  and Frizzled1 cannot be mediated by sufficient β-catenin content inside the cell,
  and reduced β-catenin in the nucleus decreases PPAR-γ expression. Reduced PPAR-γ
  down-regulates CD36 expression, which promotes M2 microglia conversion. Alternatively,
  as low concentrations of intranuclear PPAR-γ cannot effectively antagonize nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB) factor, relevant inflammatory signaling pathways are activated,
  and release of inflammatory factors is inevitable, directly causing nerve cell damage
  and intensified early brain injury. SAH: Subarachnoid hemorrhage; PPAR: peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor; APC: adenomatous Polyposis Coli; FRZ: Frizzled;
  GSK: glycogen synthase kinase; LEF/TCF: lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor.'
