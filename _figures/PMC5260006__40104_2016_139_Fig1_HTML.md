caption: Pathway of branched chain amino acid catabolism. BCAA are catabolized to
  acetyl-CoA and/or succinate-CoA and subsequently enter the TCA cycle. The main steps
  of the catabolic reactions (transamination by BCAT and decarboxylation by BCKD)
  are shown. With the help of BCAT, BCAA are catabolized into branched-chain α-ketoacids
  which are subsequently decarboxylated by BCKD. Finally, all the BCAA metabolites
  are catabolized by a series of enzyme reactions to final products and enter the
  TCA cycle
