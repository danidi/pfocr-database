caption: 'Proposed Schematic diagram of the interaction of Mda5 with LGP2 in the RLR
  signaling pathway. The presence of dsRNA in the cytoplasm is recognized by both
  RLRs, however, the signaling mechanism can follow two different paths: (a) the LGP2
  acts as a negative regulator of type I IFN response that causes inhibition of the
  Mda5 and suppression of the expression of MAVS, IRF3, and IRF7 and (b) the LGP2
  functions as a positive regulator in which LGP2 nucleates MDA5 filaments by binding
  dsRNA termini extending the MDA5 filaments. The LGP2 stabilizes the formation of
  these shorter filaments for the proper attachment to MAVS, thereby, causing more
  efficient and up-regulated expression of IRF3 and IRF7, leading ultimately, to the
  up-regulation of secreted type I IFNs and ISGs.'
