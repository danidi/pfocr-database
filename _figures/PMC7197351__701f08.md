caption: A model for dERR function in adult metabolism. dERR directly induces genes
  in glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), highlighted with gray boxes.
  The end product of glycolysis, pyruvate, enters the TCA cycle to undergo oxidative
  phosphorylation for ATP production. Relatively little pyruvate is converted to lactate
  due to low levels of Ldh expression in adults. Cytoplasmic citrate, derived from
  the TCA cycle, is converted into the critical precursor for lipogenesis, acetyl
  CoA, by ATP citrate lyase (ATPCL), which is up-regulated by dERR in adults. NADPH
  from the PPP provides the reducing power for efficient lipogenesis, supporting the
  synthesis of fatty acids, the precursor for stored triglycerides. Mitochondrial
  activity is independently up-regulated in adults by the dHNF4 nuclear receptor.
