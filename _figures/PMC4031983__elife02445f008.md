caption: 'Model of miRNA-dependent regulation of DSB repair during cell cycle. The
  balance of HR and NHEJ in dividing cells is crucial for efficient DSB repair. NHEJ
  is the preferred pathway in the G1 phase with 53BP1 and the Ku complex binding the
  broken DNA end. miRNAs (such as miR-1255b and miR-193b*) suppress HR factors, particularly
  BRCA1, preventing end resection of the DNA lesions. However, when these miRNAs are
  inhibited or deleted it may disrupt the correct choice of DSB repair pathway. Ectopic
  over expression of BRCA1 will allow CtIP-mediated resection in G1 cells, preventing
  NHEJ. Furthermore, HR-mediated repair in G1 is detrimental to cell health as it
  would lead to LOH. In S-phase, DSBs are predominantly repaired by HR and down-regulation
  of miRNAs targeting BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 may be important in ensuring efficient
  HR-mediated DSB repair. Over-expression of miRNAs (such as miR-1255b, miR-193b*,
  and miR-148b*) targeting BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51 in the S phase will impede various
  steps of HR, and the HR deficiency will sensitize these cells to PARP inhibitors.DOI:
