caption: Schematic representation of eHsp90α signaling pathway. The red arrows depict
  the flow of eHsp90α signals from inside to outside the cell. The dotted line indicates
  the finding that eHsp90α can also bind to subdomain IV. Akt is essential for eHsp90α
  signaling to promote cell migration and wound healing. However, whether or not activation
  of Akt alone is sufficient to entirely replace eHsp90α is not clear. Other parallel
  pathways may also be involved in eHsp90α signaling. How LRP-1 mediates eHsp90α signaling
  to the other three pathways identified by the protein kinase array remains to be
  investigated. The question mark indicates intermediate activators whose identities
  remain unknown.
