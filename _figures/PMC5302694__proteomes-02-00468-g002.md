caption: Amode of sporophytic self-incompatibility signaling pathway regulated by
  the ARCI. When the cognate S-locus cysteine-rich protein (SCR) binds to the extracellular
  domain of SRK, its intracellular domain is activated and relieves inhibition from
  THL proteins. A phosphorylation cascades transfer from the MLPK to ARC1. The phosphorylated
  ARC1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, supported by the E1 and E2 ligase, may activate the ubiquitination
  and degradation of EXO70A1. The ARC1-mediated degradation of EXO70A1 leads to the
  inhibition secretion of “compatible” factors to reject the “self” pollens.
