caption: mTOR impacts diverse processes that may be involved in the promotion of autoimmunity
  in SLE. Rapamycin treatment can directly limit many of these processes in isolation,
  and some or all of those effects in vivo may explain the efficacy of the drug in
  that setting. Included in this model are upstream factors that may drive increased
  mTOR activity in SLE, such as increased reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and
  nitric oxide, decreased level of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), and elevated
  mitochondrial potential. These metabolic processes also predispose cells to die
  by necrosis and release oxidized DNA, which can have pro-inflammatory consequences.
