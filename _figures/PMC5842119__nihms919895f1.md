caption: '(A) Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR) are
  natural compounds that effectively enhance NAD+ biosynthesis and have health benefits.
  In mammals, NMN is synthesized from nicotinamide by the rate-limiting enzyme, nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). NMN is also synthesized from NR via an NR kinase
  (NRK)-mediated phosphorylation reaction. NMN is then converted into NAD+ by NMN
  adenylyltransferases (NMNATs).(B) NAMPT has two distinct forms: intracellular and
  extracellular NAMPT (iNAMPT and eNAMPT, respectively). iNAMPT is present in the
  cytoplasm and nucleus. eNAMPT is secreted by multiple cell types, including adipocytes
  and immune cells. eNAMPT is fully active as an NAD+biosynthetic enzyme capable of
  catalyzing the generation of NMN, whereas it has also been reported to have a role
  as an inflammatory cytokine that are independent of catalytic activity. Nicotinic
  acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NaPRT) catalyzes the first step in the Preiss-Handler
  pathway, which converts nicotinic acid to NAD+, and de novo synthesis from tryptophan
  occurs through a complex series of steps ending with conversion of nicotinic acid
  adenine dinucleotide (NaAD+) to NAD+ by glutamine-dependent NAD+ synthase. NRK1
  and NRK2 convert NR to NMN, which can then be acted on by NMNAT1–3. NMNAT1 is exclusively
  nuclear. NMNAT2 has been reported to localize to the Golgi complex and synaptic
  vesicles, and is predominantly expressed in neurons. NMNAT3 is the only NAD+biosynthetic
  enzyme shown to be localized in the mitochondrial matrix, except in erythrocytes
  where it is expressed in the cytosol. NAD+ is consumed by NAD+-dependent enzymes,
  such as poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), sirtuins, CD38/157, and other NAD+
  glycohydrolases, and redox reaction.'
