caption: Signaling pathway and GO analyses were performed to identify the biological
  functions of the subsets of differentially expressed genes after BP5 treatment.
  Enriched genes associated with signaling pathways were identified according to the
  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. Eight signaling pathways were
  affected by BP5 treatment, including the Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis,
  and Wnt signaling pathway (Table 1 and , more information is shown in –). Most of
  these signaling pathways are involved in pre-B lymphocyte development and humoral
  immunity.
