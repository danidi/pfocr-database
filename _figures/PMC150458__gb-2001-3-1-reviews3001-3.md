caption: The known Wnt signaling pathways. (a) In the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, Wnt signaling
  depends on the steady-state levels of the multi-functional protein β-catenin. In
  the absence of Wnt signal, a multi-protein destruction complex that includes the
  adenomatous polyposis coli protein (APC) and a member of the Axin family facilitates
  the phosphorylation of β-catenin by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). GSK3 substrates
  also include APC and Axin; phosphorylation of each of these proteins leads to enhanced
  binding of β-catenin. Phosphorylated β-catenin is bound by the F-box protein β-TrCP,
  a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and is ubiquitinated; the ubiquitin
  tag marks β-catenin for destruction by the proteasome. When a cell is exposed to
  a Wnt, the Wnt interacts with its coreceptors Frizzled and LRP. Activation of Frizzled
  and LRP leads to the phosphorylation of Dishevelled (Dsh), a cytoplasmic scaffold
  protein, perhaps through stimulation of casein kinase Iε (CKIε) and/or casein kinase
  II (CKII). Dsh then functions through its interaction with Axin to antagonize GSK3,
  preventing the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of β-catenin. In vertebrates,
  inhibition of GSK3 may involve the activity of GSK3 binding protein (GBP/Frat),
  which binds to both Dsh and GSK3 and can promote dissociation of GSK3 from the destruction
  complex. Unphosphorylated β-catenin escapes degradation, accumulates in the cell,
  and enters the nucleus, where it interacts with members of the TCF/LEF family of
  HMG-domain transcription factors to stimulate expression of target genes. In addition
  to the components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway described here, many additional proteins
  with potential roles in regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling have been reported including
  the phosphatase PP2A and the kinases Akt/protein kinase B, integrin-linked kinase
  (ILK), and PKC. (b) Signaling through the Wnt/Ca2+pathway appears to involve activation
  of the two pertussis-toxin-sensitive G proteins, Gαo and G.αt, in combination with
  Gβ2 [34,35]. G-protein activation then leads to an increase in intracellular Ca2+
  and the subsequent stimulation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII) [37].
  Activation of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway also results in stimulation of PKC activity in
  the form of the translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane [34]. Downstream targets
  of the Wnt/Ca2+pathway have not been identified. (c) The Wnt/polarity pathway, which
  regulates cytoskeletal organization; the Drosophila Wnt/polarity pathway that regulates
  the polarity of trichomes in the wing is shown as an example. In this case, the
  nature of the polarity signal is not known.
