caption: Activation of growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinases results in
  autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. PI3K is recruited to the membrane by directly
  binding to phosphotyrosine consensus residues of growth factor receptors or adaptors
  through one or both SH2 domains in the adaptor subunit. This leads to allosteric
  activation of the catalytic subunit. Activation results in production of the second
  messenger phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). The lipid product
  of PI3K, PIP3, recruits a subset of signaling proteins with pleckstrin homology
  (PH) domains to the membrane, including PDK1 and AKT. PTEN (a PI 3,4,5-P3 phosphatase)
  negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT pathway. Once activated, AKT mediates the activation
  and inhibition of several targets, resulting in cellular survival, growth and proliferation
  through various mechanisms.
