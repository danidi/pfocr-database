caption: Selenium availability in the tumor microenvironment influences the phenotype
  of macrophages. In a Se-deficient microenvironment TAMs lose glutathione dependent
  peroxidases (GPxs) and phagocytic activities (M1-like feature) toward transformed
  cells and produce PGE2 and TXA2 from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase (COX) supporting
  the highly glycolytic cancer stem cells (CSC). In the presence of selenium, TAMs
  rely on selenium importer SEPP1, and increase the selenoproteins which in turn polarize
  the macrophages toward an M2-like phenotype, with activation of PPARγ, degradation
  of pro-inflammatory PGE2, and production of Δ12-PGJ2. Δ12-PGJ2 activates the tumor
  suppressor protein p53, which in turn upregulates the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation
  and lowers glucose uptake by the cells. As a compensatory mechanism the antioxidant
  machinery (selenium dependent thioredoxin reductases TrxRs and glutathione peroxidases
  GPxs) is enhanced but the increase is not sufficient to control ROS production.
  In a Se-rich microenvironment, its lower uptake might be assumed as one of the mechanisms
  through which neoplastic cells modulate M2-like macrophages and/or sustain TAMs
  function. In parts the figures are based on speculations and have been prepared
  by assembling in-house built cellular metabolic pathway outlines with a modified
  and adapted version of BioRender images.
