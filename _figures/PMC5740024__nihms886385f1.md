caption: Panel A, The generation of 90CE from acyl, alkoxycarbonyl, and alkylaminocarbonyl
  prodrugs. Prodrugs with acyl or alkoxycarbonyl N-2 substitutions are activated metabolically,
  whereas aminocarbonyl N-2 substituents are primarily activated by spontaneous base
  catalyzed hydrolysis. The alkylaminocarbonyl prodrugs also produce a reactive isocyanate
  during 90CE generation that is capable of inhibiting enzymes with essential active
  site thiol(s) or reacting with non-protein sulfhydryls such as glutathione. 90CE
  undergoes a rapid elimination reaction to produce a fleeting oxophilic chloroethylating
  species that can react with O-6 position of DNA guanine. Panel B, Reaction sequence
  leading to the formation of a highly toxic DNA interstrand cross-link following
  the O-6 chloroethylation of DNA guanine, and the points where the repair protein
  MGMT can block cross-link formation. Panel C, Greater therapeutic index (lethal
  dose 50%/effective dose 50%, LD50/ED50) of a single i.p. dose of the alkylaminocarbonyl
  based 90CE prodrug laromustine compared to the acyl based prodrug 1-acetyl-1,2-bis(methylsulfonyl)-2-(2-chloroethyl)hydrazine
  (90AC) towards L1210 leukemia in female CD2F1 mice (pooled historical data 5–14
  mice per data point ()). Deaths at the higher dosage levels are due to drug toxicity.
  The approximate ED50 and LD50 values are indicated. Panel D, Cancer cells frequently
  utilize aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) as their major energy producing
  pathway even in the presence of sufficient oxygen for normal aerobic glucose oxidation.
  This results in the production of only two ATP molecules per glucose molecule versus
  ~36 via normal oxidative glucose catabolism. The lower ATP yield is compensated
  for by having a higher pathway flux. To permit this increased glucose flux and manage
  the high production of lactic and pyruvic acids cancer cells express high levels/activities
  of glucose transporters and acid extruders (monocarboxylic acid transporters 1 and
  4, and proton export systems (,)). This results in atypically high intracellular
  pH values in cancer cells, and this further promotes glycolysis due to the high
  pH activation of several glycolytic enzymes (,). For cancer cells the extracellular
  pH can be quite variable, for a leukemia cell in the circulation the extracellular
  pH would be ~ 7.4, but in solid tumors due to the inefficient clearance of exported
  acids the extracellular pH can be much more acidic (). Panel E, Structures of bis(sulfonyl)hydrazine
  prodrugs possessing chloroethylating activity only (90AC), carbamoylating activity
  only (ProMIC), and combined chloroethylating and carbamoylating activities (laromustine).
