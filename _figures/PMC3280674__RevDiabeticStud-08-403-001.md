caption: 'FAs enter the cardiomyocyte through specific transporters, and they are
  converted to acyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthethase (ACS). Acyl-CoAs might be used for
  β-oxidation (blue pathway), or they can be diverted to non-oxidative pathways, including
  esterification and TG synthesis (pink pathway) and formation of lipotoxic intermediates,
  namely ceramides (Cer) (bottom, green pathway). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
  diacylglycerol (DAG), resulting from oxidation or esterification, are also toxic
  intermediates. Intracellular TG may accumulate in lipoproteins (top left, purple
  pathway) to be eventually released in the circulation, or be hydrolyzed by adipose
  tissue triglyceride lipase (ATGL), leading to intracellular release of FA. Intracellular
  FAs can follow one of the pathways mentioned above, with further accumulation of
  cytotoxic molecules. Potentially toxic products are shown in orange. Abbreviations:
  Acyl-CoA: acyl coenzyme A. ACS: acyl-CoA synthetase. AGPAT: acyl glycerolphosphate
  acyltransferase. ApoB: apolipoprotein B. ATGL: adipose tissue triglyceride lipase.
