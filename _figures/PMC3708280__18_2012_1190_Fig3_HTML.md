caption: The molecular background of major signaling pathways responsible for proper
  development of muscles and muscle stem cells in normal tissues and tissues affected
  by laminopathy. Only major signaling pathways are shown. In the case of Wnt and
  Notch signaling pathways, only essential fragments of pathways for muscle tissues
  are shown. In the case of TGFβ-related pathways, only four different pathways are
  shown as an example of possible interactions. a Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated
  by ligands of the Frizzled receptor, which triggers a signaling cascade resulting
  in the displacement of the multifunctional kinase GSK3β from the APC/Axin/GSK3β
  complex. Free GSK3β is not able to phosphorylate β-catenin. Hypophosphorylated β-catenin
  accumulates in the cytoplasm and is translocated to the nucleus, where it can be
  immobilized in nuclear envelope (NE) by emerin binding (inactive β-catenin) or can
  translocate to the nucleoplasm, where it activates its target genes via TCF/LEF
  (T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor) transcription factors. Mutations in emerin
  could change β-catenin cellular localization and thus influence its activity. In
  the absence of Wnt, cytoplasmic β-catenin is constantly phosphorylated by GSK3β
  in a protein complex, which leads to β-catenin ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
  b For proper myoblast differentiation, LIM-domain only 7 (Lmo7) is needed. This
  is a transcription factor that regulates Pax3 expression. Emerin binds to and inhibits
  the activity of Lmo7. c Notch binding to ligand elicits several steps of cleavage;
  thus the intracellular domain (NICD) of this protein is released and translocated
  into the nucleus where it forms a complex with the DNA-binding CSL transcription
  factor and the transcriptional co-activator Maml. This complex induces the expression
  of Hes1 and Hes5 genes. The Notch repressive effect on muscle differentiation arises
  from intracellular domain of Notch (NICD) ability to prevent binding between MAML
  and Mef2. d Bmp4 acts by augmentation of Notch-dependent transcription, inducing
  phosphorylation of Smads, which after heterodimerization with Smad4 leads to transcription
  stimulation of target genes including expression of Hes1 and Hey1 molecules. e,
  f SREBP1 interacts with pre-lamin A, but not with the mature form of this protein.
  SREBP1 is a transcription factor which regulates lipogenesis, and plays a role in
  the transactivation of the PPARγ promoter (f). Following activation by retinoic
  acid, PPARγ forms heterodimers with RXR (retinoid X receptor) and modulates gene
  transcription. Mutations of lamin A cause the retention of SREBP1 at the NE and
  decrease the SREBP1 level in the nucleoplasm, which reduces the expression of PPARγ
  and other genes. g, h Lamin A is phosphorylated on the S404 residue by Akt/PKB kinase
  downstream of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3 kinase) signaling pathway. The
  phosphorylation of lamin A might modulate interaction with protein partners, impair
  lamin polymerization or promote association with the 14.3.3 protein. Lamin mutations
  can inhibit S404 phosphorylation and lead to changes in NE stability. j The MAPK
  kinases activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun NH[]-terminal
  kinase (JNK). Active, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and JNK kinases are translocated to
  the nucleus where they interact with A-type lamins at the nuclear periphery and
  phosphorylate c-Fos and c-Jun, causing their release from the NE, thus allowing
  the transcriptional activation of responsive genes. Lamin A mutations, inhibit the
  binding of mutated lamin A/C proteins with ERK and JNK kinases, cause their release
  from the complex with lamins and in consequence increase the activity. k, l Lamins
  could modulate TGF-β-dependent signaling through interaction with protein phosphatase
  2A (PP2A). PP2A dephosphorylates pRb, and dephosphorylated Rb is able to bind MyoD.
  The MyoD-Rb-lamin A-LAP2α complex induces the expression of genes associated with
  myogenesis. Cdk4 phosphorylates MyoD, releasing it from the lamina-LAP2α-pRb complex,
  leading to the inactivation of myogenesis. This creates an opportunity for pRb to
  take part in the regulation of cell cycle progression and proliferation. In the
  absence of wild-type lamin A/C, PP2 is unable to dephosphorylate pRb in the lamin
  A-LAP2α complex. Phosphorylated pRb does not bind MyoD, and this leads to inactivation
  of myogenesis and a decrease in MyoD and pRb levels. See main text for adetailed
