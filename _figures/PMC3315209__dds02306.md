caption: Speculative model for the role of the Hippo pathway in germ cell tumorigenesis
  and reprogramming. Lats2 may be under tight control in PGCs via Dnd1-mediated inhibition
  of miRNAs of the 290 family. Loss of Dnd1 in PGCs may allow these miRNAs to inhibit
  their targets, including Lats2. ‘Other’ represents targets of the miRNA 290 family
  other than Lats2. Question mark (‘?’) represents functions of Lats2 independent
  of the Hippo pathway effectors Yap and Taz, such as in cell cycle and mitotic stability.
  Loss of Lats2 de-represses Yap or Taz, which promote reprogramming to the tumorigenic
  pluripotent stem cell state. Checkmarks indicate cases where a gene has been implicated
  in germ cell tumorigenesis and/or iPS cell generation in the literature (Dnd1, mir290,
  Yap) or in this study (Lats2, Taz). The different role for Yap and Taz in mouse
  versus human cell reprogramming may be due to species- or stage-specific differences.
  See Discussion section for details.
