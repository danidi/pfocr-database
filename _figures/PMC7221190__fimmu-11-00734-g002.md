caption: Complement-driven accelerated renal senescence after IRI-AKI leading to CKD
  progression. During renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), activation of complement
  may lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and neutrophils infiltration,
  thereby establishing a prosenescence microenvironment that promotes accelerated
  renal aging. Several molecular mechanisms can be responsible for the establishment
  of tubular senescence after complement activation. First, renal tubular epithelial
  cells expressed fucosylated glucose patterns upon IRI, which can be recognized by
  the lectin pathway pattern recognition receptor (PRR) (as Collectin-11), therefore
  inducing complement activation and tubular interstitial fibrosis with persistent
  chronic inflammation (upper part). Second, the release of C5a anaphylatoxin, through
  methylation changes, can induce cellular senescence characterized by growth arrest,
  inhibition of apoptosis, and acquirement of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype
  (SASP). The molecular mediators of the growth arrest are mainly G1-S cell cycle
  inhibitors as p16INK4a, p21 WAF/CIP1, p53, and p27. The p21 and p27 proteins can
  mediate the cell cycle arrest also during the transition from phase S to phase G2
  of cellular cycle. The SASP is maintained and amplified by the increased expression
  of proinflammatory [such as interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
  (MCP-1), IL-8, PAI-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)] and profibrotic cytokines
  [as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF)] (in the middle). Finally, another molecular
  mechanism of complement-induced renal inflammaging is mediated by Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling. The C1 complex (that is composed by the association of C1q with C1s and
  C1r serine proteases), after binding the serpentine Frizzled receptor (indicated
  in red), can cleave the N-terminal domain of LRP5/6 and stabilize the β-catenin
  protein (in the left). The function to bind Frizzled receptors and to cleave the
  LPR5/6 extracellular domain is normally exerted by the Wnt protein (indicated in
  green). The β-catenin stabilization allows the nuclear translocation, the interaction
  with transcription factors, and the augmented gene expression of proaging Wnt target
  genes. The final and common event of all these complement-mediated pathways is represented
  by the generation of stress-induced senescence cells, indicated in the figure as
  enlarged cells, indicated as blue cells to highlight the positivity to SA-βGal enzymatic
  assay. The persistence of these cells and the higher increase in SASP chemokines
  result in chronic fibrosis by the induction of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition
  (EndMT) and pericyte-to-myofibroblast transition (PMT) that can amplify microvascular
  rarefaction together with generation of new myofibroblast and proliferation of resident
  fibroblast. Lastly, several mechanisms are involved in the maintenance of renal
  inflammaging such as the downregulation of Klotho, the increased Wnt signaling,
  mitochondrial dysfunction, the epigenetic changes, and the increased and stable
  expression of cell cycle inhibitors.
