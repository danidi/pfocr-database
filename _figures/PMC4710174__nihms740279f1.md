caption: Wnt signaling in old HSCs switches from a canonical β-catenin-dependent pathway
  to a non-canonical pathway associated mainly to Wnt5a []. This again increases the
  activity of the small RhoGTPase CDC42 and results in an increase of Ca2+ (or induction
  of JNK pathways) to regulate transcription factors such as NFAT. There seems to
  be a substantial Wnt/NOTCH crosstalk resulting in upregulated intrinsic NOTCH signaling
  and less polarity. Apolarity might be linked to the mode of the cell division and
  thus fate of the daughter cells. These changes in polarity could also be influenced
  by the down-regulation of the global chromatin regulator Satb1 upon aging [] and
  changes of cytokines in the niche (i.e. CXCL12) []. Potential modification targets
  that have been identified so far are CDC42 inhibitor (CASIN)[], Sat1b [], Wnt pathways
  [, , ] or Calcium signaling (i.e. via for example physical activity []). With respect
  to later stages in T-cell development, certain cytokines such as IL-7, IL-12, IL-15
  or IL-22 and growth factors such as KGF (important for the stability of the thymic
  microenvironment) have been introduced as potential targets for restoring T-cell
  function, immunity and response to vaccination []. Notably, in these stages, Sat1b
  also seems to be crucial for Th2-type T-cell development in a (canonical) Wnt-dependent
  manner []. Potential novel and currently used targets for attenuation of SIR are
  marked in green.
