caption: The SREBP-driven mevalonate pathway. The transcriptional activity of sterol
  regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) governs expression of mevalonate pathway
  enzymes. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY, EC 2.3.3.8), which can be inhibited by hydroxycitrate
  (HC), generates cytosolic acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA). 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  CoA (HMG-CoA)-synthase (HMGCS1, EC 2.3.3.10) condenses 3 molcules of acetyl-CoA
  to form HMG-CoA. HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR, EC 1.1.1.34), which can be inhibited
  by statins, in turn generates mevalonate (also known as mevalonic acid) in the first
  committed step of the pathway. Sequential phosphorylation reactions by mevalonate
  kinase (MVK, EC 2.7.1.36), which is mutated in MVK deficiency, and phosphomevalonate
  kinase (PMVK, EC 2.7.4.2), respectively, followed by a decarboxylation step catalyzed
  by mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MVD, EC 4.1.1.33) produce isopentenyl diphosphate
  (IPP). Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase (FDPS, EC 2.5.1.10), which is the target
  of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) condenses IPP (C5) and its isomer
  dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, C5) to form geranyl diphosphate (GPP, C10) and
  subsequently GPP with another IPP unit to generate FPP (C15). FPP is the common
  precursor for cholesterol and steroids in the sterol branch as well as for products
  of the nonsterol branch including geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GPPP, C20), dolichol,
  heme A and ubiquinone (coenzyme Q). GGPP is formed by GGPP synthase (GGPS, EC 2.5.1.29)
  through condensation of FPP with yet another IPP unit. In protein prenylation, FPP
  and GGPP, serve as prenyl group donors in posttranslational modifications of multiple
  Ras protein family members and G protein-coupled receptors. Farnesylation (using
  FPP) or geranylgeranylation (using GGPP) are required for membrane attachment and
  function of these proteins. Prenylated proteins constitute approximately 0.5% to
  2% of proteins in mammalian cells. Prenyldiphosphate synthase-1 (PDSS1, EC 2.5.1.91)
  catalyzes the elongation of GPP or FPP with several IPP moieties to form the polyisoprenoid
  chain of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q). ACAT1 catalyzes cholesterol esterification for
  storage purposes.
