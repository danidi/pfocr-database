caption: Overview of mouse lung development and early pseudoglandular branching morphogenesis.
  (A) Stages of mouse lung development (see text for details). A lung in earliest
  stages of branching morphogenesis is depicted. The four right lobes and left lobe
  are discernable at E11.5. Cr., Cranial; M., Medial; Ca., Caudal; A., Accessory.
  (B) A distal lung bud at E12.5, shortly after bifurcation. The top branch highlights
  the Fgf10/Fgfr2b/Etv/Shh regulatory pathway. The bottom branch depicts regulation
  of cell adhesion and rearrangement via the Fgf10/Fgfr2b/β-catenin/Ep300 pathway.
  Distal airways are marked by Sox9 and Id2 expression, whereas proximal airways express
  Sox2 and Scgb1a1. Dark and light blue ovals represent localized sources of high
  and low Fgf10 expression, respectively.
