caption: 'F-actin correlation pathway diagram. RhoA and ROCK1 were regulatory factors
  upstream of F-actin. The expression of F-actin was regulated by RhoA/ROCK1/LIMK/coffin
  or MLC pathway. DnaJA4 may inhibit the RhoA/ROCK1 pathway protein expression. GPCR:
  G-protein-coupled receptor; MLC: Myosin light chain; ROCK: rho-associated serine/threonine
  kinase.'

papertitle: DnaJA4 is involved in responses to hyperthermia by regulating the expression
  of F-actin in HaCaT cells.
