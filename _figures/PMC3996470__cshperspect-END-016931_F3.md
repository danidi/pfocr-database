caption: Processing of APP to form Aβ peptide. APP is secreted by a constitutive secretory
  pathway from the Golgi. While on the plasma membrane, APP can be cleaved by α-secretases
  in the middle of the Aβ peptide region, thus preventing formation of Aβ peptide.
  APP is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In the early endosome system,
  probably in the ERC, APP can be cleaved by BACE1 to release the amino-terminal domain
  into the lumen of the endosome. The carboxy-terminal transmembrane fragment can
  be cleaved by the γ-secretase within the transmembrane segment, perhaps after retrograde
  transport back to the TGN. The amyloidogenic Aβ peptide is released into the lumen
  of the organelles. As discussed in the text, these various steps of proteolytic
  processing may take place in several different organelles because APP and the various
  enzymes are found throughout the secretory and endocytic pathways.
