caption: In diabetes, obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) decreased
  synthesis of anti-inflammatory adiponectin and increased production of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines lead to increased production of ceramides. Obesity also causes activation
  of TLR4 signaling pathway which leads to activation of sphingomyelinase (SMase).
  SMase hydrolyzes sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide. In NAFLD, insulin is not able to
  inhibit hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activity in adipose tissue leading to increased
  production of free fatty acids (FFAs), specially palmitic acid, that are shunted
  for ceramides synthesis. Ceramides, in turn, enhance the activity of protein phosphatase
  2A (PP2A) which causes dephosphorylation and inactivation of AKT leading to insulin
  resistance. Increased ceramides may be a substrate for increased SM and glycosphingolipids
  (GSL) synthesis that have been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.
  Synthesis of sphinogsine 1-phosphate (S1P), which is cardioprotective, is decreased
  in cardiovascular diseases.
