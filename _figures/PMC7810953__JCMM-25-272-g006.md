caption: Schematic diagram depicting how SEP‐mediated induction of autophagy leads
  to activation of apoptosis in AML. Treatment with SEP leads to mitochondrial dysfunction
  resulting in the activation of caspase‐3 and caspase‐9 as well as the release of
  CytoC, which triggers apoptosis in leukaemia cells. SEP also induces cell apoptosis
  by enhancing phosphorylation of NF‐κB and activating NF‐κB signalling pathway. SEP
  may elevate autophagy‐related protein LC3‐II, ATG7 and BECN1, stimulating autophagy
  in leukaemia cells and eventually promoting apoptosis
