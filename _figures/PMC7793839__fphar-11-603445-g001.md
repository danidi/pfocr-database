caption: The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway. TLR4 and its co-receptor
  MD-2 can signal through two different pathways, the myeloid differentiation primary
  response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent and MyD88-independent pathway. In MyD88-dependent
  pathway, the signal transduces through Interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase
  4 and 1 (IRAK4 and IRAK1) and the following TNF receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6).
  The activation of TRAF6 leads to phosphorylation of inhibitors of nuclear factor
  κB Kinases (IKKs), which in turn activates the IκB. The activation of IκB leads
  to its degradation and the initiation of activation of NFκB and the production of
  proinflammatory cytokines, for example, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), IL-1β and IL-6
  (). In contrast, MyD88-independent pathway adopts the adaptor protein TRIF and transduces
  the signal through TRAF3, TBK1 and IKKε, which then phosphorylates interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3). IRF3 then translocates to the nucleus and promotes the transcription
  of type 1 interferons. Drugs of abuse like opioids, alcohol and psychostimulants
  may activate TLR4 signaling and induce pro-inflammatory responses.
