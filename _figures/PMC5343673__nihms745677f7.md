caption: Amyloid beta peptide causes hyper activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors,
  which triggers downstream pathways such as phosphorylated tau, cyclin-dependent
  kinase 5, dynamin-related protein 1 and GSK-3β. These events cause endocytosis of
  AMPA receptors as well as NMDARs through calcium ions. These pathways may lead to
  abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics and impaired long-term
  potentiation, and synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease neurons. The p53-dependent
  apoptotic pathway mobilizes the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, in turn causes mitochondrial
  fragmentation during apoptosis by forming a complex with Drp1 and Mfn2 at fission
  sites. As a transcriptional regulator, p53 may also have a direct influence on the
  expression and function of proteins regulating mitochondrial morphology.
