caption: Working hypothesis of Glial Molecular Mechanisms Implicated in the Pathogenesis
  of POI. Under normal physiological conditions, glial cells modulate motility by
  interacting with neural-motor components of the gut. Glia communicate with each
  other and the ENS via Ca2+ waves and release of gliotransmitters. Recent evidence
  has revealed a number of potential glial targets implicated in the pathogenesis
  of POI and POGD. Gut surgical trauma and manipulation induces a reactive enteric
  glial phenotype that contributes to the overall neuroinflammation and GI dysmotility.
  Experimental evidence in reactive glia suggests that a variety of glial molecular
  signaling mechanisms may be operating in POI. These include 1) abnormal mechanosensation,
  2) purinergic pathways via ATP, 3) the IL1β/IL1R Signaling Pathway, 4) the ET-1/ETBR
  signalling pathway, 5) the s100β-RAGE/iNOS/NO signaling pathway, and 6) a PPARα
  signaling pathway targeted by PEA to inhibit inflammation.
