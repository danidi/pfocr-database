caption: A proposed model of signaling mechanisms underlying recruitment and activation
  of bone marrow-derived fibroblasts in renal fibrosis. In response to injury (urinary
  tract obstruction, ischemia-reperfusion, hypertension), tubular epithelial cells
  produce chemokines CCL21/CXCL16/CCL2 and cytokine TGF-β1. Chemokines act concertedly
  to recruit bone marrow-derived cells (T cells, monocytes, and fibrocytes) via interaction
  with their respective receptors. TGF-β1 activates Smad3 to stimulate monocyte-to-fibroblast
  transition. Th2 cells produce Th2 cytokines, which activate JAK3/STAT6 signaling
  pathway to promote monocyte-to-fibroblast transition. Finally, adiponectin produced
  by infiltrating inflammatory cells regulates chemokine and cytokine production and
  stimulates monocyte-to-fibroblast transition through activation of AMPK. T, T cells;
  M, Monocytes; MF, Myeloid fibroblasts.
