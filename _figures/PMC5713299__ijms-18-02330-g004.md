caption: 'Accumulation of individual (A) glucosinolates; (B) phenolic compounds; (C)
  carotenoids; and (D) chlorophylls in broccoli sprouts treated with UV light and
  MJ. Identified compounds are located in their corresponding biosynthetic pathway.
  Dashed arrows represent multiple enzymatic steps. The numbering of compounds corresponds
  to the peak number assigned in  for A,  for B, and  for C and D. Numbers in red
  correspond to compounds whose concentration decreased or remained unaffected by
  all treatments compared to its control; and in black, increased. From the latter
  group, phenolic compounds 4, 9, 11, 12, 15, and 17 (in B) were taken as the most
  representative. Concentrations (in mmol/kg DW or mg/kg DW) correspond to data presented
  in  for A,  for B, and  for C and D. For treatments with MJ (green), 65 mL of a
  25 µM MJ solution were exogenously sprayed to broccoli sprouts every 12 h from sowing
  day until the 8th day after sowing. For treatments with UVA (red) and UVB (blue)
  lights, broccoli sprouts were exposed for 120 min to doses of 9.47 and 7.16 W/m2
  respectively, on the 7th day after sowing. Harvest of treated and non-treated sprouts
  occurred on the 8th day after sowing. The higher the color block, the greater the
  compound’s accumulation after a given treatment. Abbreviations: Dry weight (DW);
  Methyl Jasmonate (MJ); Ultraviolet (UV); Glucoiberin (GIB); Progoitrin (PRO); Glucoraphanin
  (GRA); 4-hydroxy-glucobrassicin (4-HGBS); Glucoerucin (GER); Glucobrassicin (GBS);
  4-methoxy-glucobrassicin (4-MGBS), Neoglucobrassicin (NGBS); Galloyl quinic acid
  (GQA); Gallic acid derivative (GAD); Gallic acid hexoside II (GAH II); p-hydroxybenzoic
  acid (p-HBA); 1-O-sinapoyl-β-d-glucose (1-O-S-β-d-g); 1,2-diferulolylgentiobiose
