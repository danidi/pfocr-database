caption: Recent work has uncovered many types of genomic instability that lead to
  exposure of DNA to the cytoplasm, for example micronuclei and DNA bridges. Cytosolic
  DNA exposure can lead to signaling through the cGAS/STING pathway. Autophagy has
  been shown to be a prominent feature of cells in crisis. The exact details of the
  mechanisms linking cGAS/STING pathway activation to autophagy induction have not
  yet been fully elucidated.
