caption: 'Simplified diagram of the unfolded protein response. Three major effectors
  of unfolded protein response, IRE1, ATF6, and PERK are maintained in an inactive,
  membrane bound form by binding with GRP78. Binding of unfolded proteins to GRP78
  causes release of GRP78 from the three unfolded protein response effector proteins
  and results in their activation. Activated ATF6 and IRE1 lead to increased activity
  of CHOP protein which stimulates unfolded protein response. Activated PERK also
  activates CHOP via phosphorylation of eIF2α. Depending on the magnitude and duration
  of unfolded protein stress, unfolded protein response results in either cell recovery
  or cell death via apoptosis mediated by caspase 3 and 9. GRP78: glucose response
  protein 78; PERK: pancreatic ER kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase; ATF6: activating transcription
  factor 6; IRE1: inositol requiring enzyme 1; phospho-eIF2α: phosphorylated eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2α; CHOP: C/EBP homologous protein.'
