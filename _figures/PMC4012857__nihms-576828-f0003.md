caption: A.) Similar to bacterial chemotaxis, an adaptation module may be present
  early in the signaling pathway. Its output may then become transmitted to downstream
  nodes, relaying activity at each moment in time.B.) Several adaptation modules may
  exist. Shown is a case where adaptation modules operate in parallel.C.) Adapting
  nodes are highly interconnected, making it challenging to tease apart the underlying
  adaptation module(s). The minimum circuits necessary for each individual adapting
  node are currently unknown. Shown is one example of adapting nodes, along with some
  of their regulators and linkages. Positive and negative regulators, GTPase Exchange
  Factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating factors (GAPs) determine the GTP binding state
  and therefore activities of Ras and Rac. Similarly, PI3kinases and lipid phosphatases
  like PTEN regulate levels of PIP3 in the membrane. Each of these outputs shows adaptive
  behavior and can feed both forward and backward in the signaling cascade. An example
  is shown for the PIP3response in chemoattractant-stimulated Dictyostelium.
