caption: Potential steroid-specific protein markers. To identify potential steroid-specific
  biomarkers, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to screen proteins significantly
  altered by prednisone but not by infliximab. (a) Three proteins were found to be
  directly regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, or NR3C1) but not by TNF.
  An additional two were found to be regulated by one of its direct targets, but not
  by TNF. These five proteins (marked by a red box) were selected as potential steroid-specific
  markers. (b) Proteomic expression data for these five targets demonstrates that
  these were affected by prednisone treatment but not by infliximab treatment. (aValues
  are log transformed mean±s.d.; red=increased, blue=decreased, green=drug, yellow=direct
  drug targets, NR3C1=glucocorticoid receptor).
