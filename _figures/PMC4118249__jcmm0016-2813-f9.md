caption: 'Theoretical structure of this triple-hit nALI model as a translational study.
  There are specific stressors to the alveolar epithelial/endothelial cells (first
  bubble) and general stressors (second bubble) because of the set-up of the model.
  The study contains three levels of assessment: receptor, effector, and (lung) function.
  Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88),
  and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) were not assessed in this study but are known to play
  important roles for migration of macrophages into airways, and transcription of
  genes for amphiregulin, TGF-β1, and IL-6 synthesis, respectively. The aSMase/ceramide
  pathway is displayed as the central pro-inflammatory pathway causing impaired lung
  function as assessed by oxygenation, ventilation, compliance and pulmonary edema.
  Topical application of S+Imi/PIP2 for suppression of aSMase activity and improved
  lung function.'
