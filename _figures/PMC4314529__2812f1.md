caption: 'Mechanism of ICL repair in the FA pathway on collision of a replication
  fork with an ICL. The FA pathway is composed of ≥16 genes (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F,
  G, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q). The encoded proteins can be subdivided within the
  FA pathway into 3 groups: (1) proteins that make up the core complex; (2) the FANCI
  and FANCD2 proteins, which compose the ID2 complex; and (3) downstream effector
  proteins. (A) The FA pathway is activated during S phase of the cell cycle or on
  the detection of ICLs and DNA damage caused by other agents, including endogenous
  acetaldehydes. The FA core complex is recruited to the damage site through its interaction
  with the MHF1-MHF2-FANCM complex. (B) The ID2 complex becomes monoubiquitinated
  and remains associated with the DNA damage. The B-L-100 complex mediates the ubiquitination
  reaction, with the other 2 core subcomplexes (A-G-20 and C-E-F) playing accessory
  roles that remain to be elucidated. (C) Specialized endonucleases, in particular
  XPF/FANCQ-ERCC1 in complex with SLX4/FANCP, incise the DNA. (D) Within chromatin,
  the monoubiquitinated ID2 complex recruits DNA repair proteins including BRCA1,
  BRCA2/FANCD1, FANCJ, PALB2/FANCN, and RAD51C/FANCO. (E) Following successful repair,
  deubiquitination of the ID2 complex by USP1-UAF1 promotes its release from chromatin.'
