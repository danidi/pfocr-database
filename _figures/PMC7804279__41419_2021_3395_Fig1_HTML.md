caption: The core components of the Hippo pathway encompass MST1/2 and LATS1/2, whereas
  YAP/TAZ are two major effectors of this pathway. Traditionally, upstream signals
  turn on the Hippo pathway by phosphorylating and activating MST1/2 as well as the
  scaffold protein SAV1, followed by phosphorylation and activation of LATS1/2 and
  the scaffold protein MOB1, thereby preventing YAP/TAZ from translocating to the
  nucleus and initiating gene expression via binding to TEADs. VGLL4, a transcriptional
  co-repressor, competes with YAP/TAZ for TEADs binding. Instead, phosphorylated YAP/TAZ
  are isolated in the cytoplasm through interaction with protein 14-3-3 or experience
  ubiquitylation and degradation. Expanded Hippo pathway encompasses MAP4Ks as well
  as NDR1/2. MAP4Ks function similarly as MST1/2, performing activating phosphorylation
  of LATS1/2 and/or NDR1/2, consequently leading to the inhibition of downstream YAP/TAZ
  via LATS1/2- or NDR1/2-regulated phosphorylation. The complex of YAP/TAZ and TEADs
  can both directly enhance the function of LATS2 and indirectly stimulate LATS1/2
  expression via NF2, which constitute a feedback loop. Independent of the upstream
  kinases, YAP/TAZ may be directly sequestered at cell junctions via interacting with
  PTPN14, AMOTs, and α-catenin. NF2, Kibra, RASSF1A, and TAO-K stimulated by upstream
  stimuli, may phosphorylate and activate MST1/2 and/or MAP4Ks. GPCRs may inhibit
  and enhance LATS1/2 depending on the types of receptors. Arrows, blunt ends, and
  dotted lines indicate activation, inhibition, and possible regulatory effect, respectively.
