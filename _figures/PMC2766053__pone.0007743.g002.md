caption: 'Colored squares indicate the regulation pattern of genes encoding putative
  enzymes involved in the synthesis of carotenoids after exposure to HL for 0.5 h,
  3 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h. Squares with a diagonal line inside indicate genes
  with an expression ratio (log2 transformed) greater than +/−0.5 that are not significantly
  regulated. The scale on the right represents gene expression ratio values, log2
  transformed. The violaxanthin cycle (A) and the diadinoxanthin cycle (B) are boxed.
  Dashed arrows indicate the hypothetical conversion of violaxanthin to diadinoxanthin
  and the formation of fucoxanthin from diadinoxanthin, as proposed by Lohr and Wilhelm
  , . The abbreviations used are PSY: phytoene synthase; PDS: phytoene desaturase;
  ZDS: ζ-carotene desaturase, CRTISO: carotenoid isomerase; crtI: bacterial-like desaturase;
  LCYB: lycopene β-cyclase; LUT: lutein deficient-like; ZEP: zeaxanthin epoxidase;
  VDE: violaxanthin de de-epoxidase; VDL: violaxanthin de de-epoxidase-like; VDR:
  violaxanthin de de-epoxidase related.'
