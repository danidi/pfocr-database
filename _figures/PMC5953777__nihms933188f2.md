caption: 'Connectivity of differentially expressed genes in the important cancer signaling
  pathways in the exposed children are shown according to gene expression levels (with
  ≥ 1.5-fold change, t test, p < 0.05). Genes in the top six networks were allowed
  to grow our pathway with the direct/ indirect relationship from the IPA knowledge
  base using the most stringent filter, i.e., based on the data from our human study.
  Solid interconnecting lines show the genes that are directly connected, and the
  dotted lines signify the indirect connection between the genes and cellular functions.
  Canonical functions (signaling) that are highly represented are shown within the
  box (CP) along with their related function (Fx): they were identified as differentially
  expressed in our experimental results and in the results from the 45-month-old children'
