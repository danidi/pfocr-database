caption: Top-level, intermediate, and MAP kinase modules are colored in orange, magenta,
  and navy, respectively. Filled arrowheads represent protein-protein binding reactions
  whereas open arrowheads denote catalytic interactions. Rs, free cell surface receptor;
  L, ligand; Ri, internal receptor; Li, internal ligand; RL, cell surface R-L complex;
  R2L2s, cell surface dimmer complex of RL; R2L2i, internalized dimmer complex of
  RL; CPP, coated pit protein; R2L2-CPP, receptor-ligand-coated pit protein complex;
  R*, all active species of R, i.e., R2L2s, R2L2i, and R2L2-CPP; Shc, Src homology
  and collagen domain protein; ShcP, phosphorylated Shc; GS, complex of Grb2, growth
  factor receptor binding protein 2, and SOS, Son of sevenless homologue protein;
  GSP, phosphorylated GS; ShcGS, complex form of Shc and GS; Ras-GDP, inactive, GDP-bound
  Ras; Ras-ShcGS, complex form of Ras-GDP and ShcGS; Ras-GTP, active, GTP-bound Ras;
  GAP, Ras GTPase activating protein; MEKP and MEKPP, phosphorylated forms of MEK;
  ERKP and ERKPP, phosphorylated forms of ERK.
