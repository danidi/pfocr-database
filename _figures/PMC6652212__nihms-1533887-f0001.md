caption: The response to cell wall-active antibiotics involves multiple sensory systems
  including TCS systems, PASTA kinases and the Spx stress regulon. (A) One of more
  TCS systems comprise the CWSS. A TCS histidine kinase responds to cell wall stress
  by autophosphorylation and subsequent transphosphorylation of its response regulator.
  A third TCS component can act as an activator, or repressor, in regulating TCS signaling.
  (B) PASTA kinase signaling occurs by direct recognition of antibiotics or, alternatively,
  by responding to cell wall stress. PASTA kinase activation contributes to modulation
  of several cellular functions including cell wall biosynthesis, metabolism and virulence
  by acting on global regulators. (C) The Spx pathway responds to independent stresses.
  Under no-stress conditions, Spx is bound by YjbH and targeted for degradation. Disulfide
  stress increases Spx levels and oxidizes Spx to control activation of gene expression.
  In contrast, antibiotic stress increases Spx, in a manner dependent upon σM, and
  YirB sequesters YjbH allowing a reduced form of Spx to activate target gene expression.
  TrfA is induced by Spx during antibiotic stress and serves as a proteasome adapter
  for recognition of SsrA-tagged substrates. Notably, cross-talk exists among PASTA
  kinases and TCS systems and between the Spx and TCS systems, coordinating activities
  of the antibiotic response. Dashed boxes indicated degraded protein.
