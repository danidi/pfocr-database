caption: 'Mitochondrial Ca2+ channels/transporters and role in mitochondrial function.
  Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is determined by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU),
  rapid mode of uptake (RaM), and ryanodine receptor (mRyR, or RyR1). The mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore (mPTP), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (mNCX), H+/Ca2+ exchanger
  (mHCX, encoded by Letm1), and DAG activated cation channels (DCC) contribute to
  Ca2+ efflux. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake contributes to (a) shaping cytosolic Ca2+
  signals and triggering metabolic coupling by enhancing mitochondrial ATP synthesis:
  (b) stimulation of Ca2+ dependent dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle [] to increase
  NADH/FADH production used to feed electrons through the electron transport chain
  (ETC) and (c) activation of the ATP synthase []. However, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload
  can trigger (d) mPTP activation, (e) ROS generation, and cell death. Voltage dependent
  anion-selective channels (VDAC) provide a pathway for Ca2+ and metabolite transport
  across the mitochondrial outer membrane. MIM and MOM; mitochondrial inner and outer
  membranes, respectively.'
