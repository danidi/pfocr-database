caption: The involvement of 1-MT in tomato–Pseudomonas syringae pathosystem. ABA plays
  a positive role in pre-invasive stomatal immunity by induction of stomatal closure
  to prevent pathogen entry. 1-MT blocks JA pathway activating this way SA pathway
  through the expression of PR5. The increase in the concentration of Thr and Trp
  together with 1-MT could be affecting the cellular division of the bacteria. In
  addition, 1-MT reduces the expression of flic gene involved in the synthesis of
  the flagellum, causing a reduction in the motility of the bacteria and therefore
  a reduction in its capacity of infection.
