caption: BNP plays critical roles in itch transmission. Mast cell activation elicits
  the release of LTC4, 5‐HT, and S1P. These mediators subsequently bind to their respective
  receptors expressed in Nppb +‐sensory neurons. Noxious acidosis activates TDAG8
  in Nppb + neurons. Th2 inflammation results in IL‐31 release which activates sensory
  neurons to release BNP. The elevated BNP level in skin promotes the release from
  KCs and dendritic cells of several inflammatory and pruritic cytokines including
  CCL20, CXCL10, IL‐17A, and MMP9 (as indicated). Activation of Nppb +‐sensory neurons
  also results in BNP release at their central terminals, followed by binding to GRP+
  spinal cord neurons. This BNP‐GRP itch pathway is under the regulation by BI‐5,
  dynorphin, and GABA releasing inhibitory interneurons. In addition, inhibition of
  BNP receptors by antagonists or inducing GABAA receptor expression on GRP neurons
  can lead to block of the pruritus. [Colour figure can be viewed at http://wileyonlinelibrary.com]
