caption: Merlin exists in an open, inactive form and a closed, active form. Matrix
  adhesion and the consequent activation of joint integrin-receptor tyrosine kinase
  signaling activate the serine-threonine kinase PAK. PAK in turn phosphorylates the
  C-terminus of Merlin, disrupting the intramolecular association that maintains the
  protein in a closed conformation. The resulting inactivation of Merlin removes a
  block to cell cycle progression in normal cells. Conversely, engagement of E-cadherin
  and the ensuing assembly of adherens junctions (AJs) inactivate PAK, leading to
  an accumulation of the closed, active form of Merlin, which migrates into the nucleus
  to inhibit CRL4DCAF1. When it is not inhibited by Merlin, CRL4DCAF1 positively regulates
  a broad oncogenic program of gene expression, which includes mitogenic signaling
  components, anti-apoptotic proteins, and Hippo pathway target genes. CRL4, cullin-ring
  E3 ligase 4; DCAF1, DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 1; PAK, p21-activated kinase.
