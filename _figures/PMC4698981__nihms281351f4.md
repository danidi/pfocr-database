caption: The heterochronic pathway regulating larval development is shown. The arrows
  indicate activation; bars indicate repression. Regulatory relationships shown here
  are supported by genetic data, but not all are direct. lin-42 is not shown, as its
  complex expression pattern and genetic interactions suggest that it acts at multiple
  steps in the pathways with different genes, and its precise placement is uncertain.
