caption: '(a) Structures of some of the molecules used in this study (X = O or S as
  indicated, R = H or Ac as indicated). (b) The end product of the HBP is UDP-GlcNAc
  (2), the donor substrate used by OGT. The first step in the de novo pathway, where
  fructose-6-phosphate is converted to glutamine-6-phosphate, is catalyzed by glutamine:
  fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT). Glutamine-6-phosphate is transformed
  into GlcNAc-6-phosphate by acetyl-CoA:D-glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase
  (GAT). The GlcNAc salvage pathway recycles cellular GlcNAc (1), which is converted
  into GlcNAc-6-phosphate by GlcNAc kinase (GNK). GlcNAc-6-phosphate is converted
  into GlcNAc-1-phosphate by GlcNAc mutase (AGM), and then to the end product, UDP-GlcNAc,
  by UDP-GlcNAc pyrophosphorylase (AGX1). The endocyclic heteroatom is denoted X (O
  in nature and S in the synthetic compounds depicted in panel a). 5SGlcNAc (3) is
  converted via the salvage pathway to generate intracellular UDP-5SGlcNAc (4). Ac-5SGlcNAc
  (5) is deacetylated by cellular esterases.'
