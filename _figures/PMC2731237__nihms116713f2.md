caption: Canonical Notch signaling pathway. Upon binding to its ligand Jagged or Delta,
  Notch receptor undergoes two proteolytic cleavages, the last one is mediated by
  γ-secretase. This leads to the release of the intracellular ICN domain which then
  translocates to the nucleus and binds DNA-binding protein CSL(CBF-1) displacing
  co-repressor complex and recruiting co-activators including MAML, thereby converting
  CSL from a repressor to an transcriptional activator. ICN, Notch intracellular domain;
  GSI, γ-secretase inhibitor; MAML, mastermind-like coactivator; CSL(CBF-1), suppressor
  of hairless.
