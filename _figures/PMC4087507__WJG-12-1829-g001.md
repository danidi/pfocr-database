caption: NOD2/TLR4 signaling pathway. NOD2 activation by CARD-CARD dimmer formation
  results in binding to RICK kinase (RIP-like interacting CLARP kinase). RICK then
  activates the nuclear factor kB inhibitor (IkB) kinase complex (IKK) via phosphorylation
  of IKKc. The IKK complex next phosphorylates IkB resulting in nuclear factor kB
  (NFkB) translocation to the nuclei and transcriptional activation of NFkB responsive
  genes, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or defensins. TLR4 induces activation
  through other molecules (Myd88, IRAK and TRAF6).
