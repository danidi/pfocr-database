caption: Schematic illustration of the IPF fibroblast pathological proliferation signaling
  pathway. When IPF fibroblasts interact with polymerized collagen, Akt activity is
  inappropriately high as a result of low PTEN activity. Akt phosphorylates and inactivates
  FoxO3a by promoting its translocation to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, p-FoxO3a in
  the nucleus cannot bind to DNA because of Ser253 phosphorylation. FoxO3a is then
  unable to activate its target gene p27, and proliferation is not suppressed (left).
  In contrast, when control fibroblasts interact with polymerized collagen, PTEN activity
  remains high, suppressing Akt activity. FoxO3a remains active and accumulates in
  the nucleus, promoting p27 expression and suppressing proliferation (right).
