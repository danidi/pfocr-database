caption: 'The toxic mechanisms of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. The toxic
  mechanisms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ischemia/reperfusion injury are mainly
  as follows: (1) nerve cell necrosis: ROS can lead to protein degeneration and enzyme
  inactivation, which can lead to damage of mitochondrial respiratory chain, energy
  generation barrier and cell death. ROS reacts with cell membrane lipids to produce
  lipids peroxide. After lipid peroxide degradation, the toxic products such as 4-hydroxyl
  can be formed, thus damaging neurons and causing neuronal cell necrosis. (2) neuronal
  apoptosis: ROS can induce neuronal apoptosis through activation of multiple pathways,
  such as mitochondrial pathway and endoplasmic reticulum pathway, and involves multiple
  signaling pathways. ① the mitochondria pathway: ROS attacks mitochondria to cause
  the cytochrome C oxidase phosphorylation, mitochondrial transmembrane potential
  rising, MPTP remains open and release. Through activation of apoptotic protease
  activating factor 1, apoptosis inducing factor, apoptotic protease activating factor,
  the Bcl-1 family proteins, ROS starts the cascade activation of apoptosis pathway
  to promote cell apoptosis, ② the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) pathway: the
  ERS refers to lack of oxygen, glucose, or lack of nutrients or lipids, virus infection,
  toxin and excessive load drug harmful factors such as steady and smooth endoplasmic
  reticulum, Ca2+ balance disorders and non-folded protein misfolding then gathered
  in the endoplasmic reticulum. ERS can activate the apoptotic signaling pathway,
  and eventually induce apoptosis, thereby aggravating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion
  injury (CIRI).'
