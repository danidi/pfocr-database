caption: Macroautophagy in the immune system. Macroautophagy is involved in the regulation
  of innate immunity. (1) Macroautophagy facilitates the elimination of intracellular
  microorganisms by a mechanism called xenophagy. (2) Macroautophagy machinery contributes
  to phagocytosis of extracellular pathogens and dead cells by a mechanism called
  LAP. (3) Macroautophagy contributes to the limitation of IL1-α and IL1-β release
  by modulating the calpain pathway and the inflammasome respectively. (4) Macroautophagy
  is an important factor participating in NET release and NETosis of neutrophils.
  (5) Macroautophagy or its machinery regulates the intensity of IFN-I responses by
  modulating the trafficking and the amount of PRR. (6) Macroautophagy machinery can
  also positively influence IFN-I secretion by helping to the relocalization of DNA-containing
  immune complexes towards TLR9-positive compartments in plasmacytoid dendritic cells.
  The same mechanism is suspected for DNA containing antigens internalized after interaction
  with BCR at the surface of B cells. Macroautophagy activity is important at the
  interface between innate and adaptive immunity. (7) Macroautophagy promotes the
  presentation of intracellular viral epitopes and self peptides by MHC-II molecules.
  Macroautophagy is necessary for presentation by B cells of citrullinated epitopes
  from extracellular origin to CD4 T cells. (8) Macroautophagy contributes to the
  presentation of both intracellular and extracellular antigens to CD4 T cells by
  DCs and macrophages. It is also involved the presentation of citrullinated peptides.
  (9) Cross-presentation by DCs of exogenous antigens is more efficient under active
  macroautophagy within the antigen-presenting cells. Moreover, macroautophagy activity
  in phagocytosed cells improves the subsequent presentation of internalized antigens
  onto MHC-I molecules, to CD8 T cells. Macroautophagy is integral to adaptive immunity.
  (10) Macroautophagy is needed for peripheral T cell homeostasis and (11) for their
  survival, activation and polarization. (12) Macroautophagy contributes to B-cell
  differentiation into plasma cell and/or (13) plasma cell survival. (14) Constitutive
  macroautophagic activity in the thymus participates in the positive and negative
  selection of T cells and the prevention of autoreactivity.
