caption: CD44- and CD44v-induced RTK for apoptosis resistance. (A) CD44-HA binding,
  accompanied by activation of CD44-associated SRC, ezrin phosphorylation, and PI3K
  activation leads to the lipid-raft-integrated assembly of a complex that includes
  heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), the co-chaperone CDC37, Rho-GEF, Grb2/VAV2, and Gab-1/PI3-kinase
  (PI3K), which promotes phosphorylation and activation of the receptor tyrosine kinases
  (RTKs), including ERBB2, ErbB3, EGFR, IGF1R-β, PDGFR-β, and c-MET. CD44-HA binding
  initiates cross-talk between RTKs, non-RTKs [SRC (Src)] and linker proteins. Studies
  have indicated that ErbB2 most likely complexes with CD44 via interactions with
  Grb2 and Vav2, whereas the interaction of PI3K and CD44 is mediated by Gab-1. PI3K
  activates Akt and downstream anti-apoptotic events, which contribute to drug resistance.
  However, HA and PI3K stimulate MDR1 expression, and the stimulatory effects of PI3K
  would be mainly due to its feedback stimulation of HA production by a positive feedback
  loop. Studies indicate that MDR1 is associated with CD44 in lipid microdomain and
  can be linked via CD44 with the actin cytoskeleton so that expression of both CD44
  and MDR1 are concomitantly regulated. (B) Particularly, in colorectal cancer, the
  CD44–ERBB2 complex provides a strong apoptotic resistance through stimulation of
  cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) transcription via PI3K and β-catenin. COX2-induced PGE2
  stimulates HA synthesis and HA-CD44 signaling. CD44v6 also binds hepatocyte growth
  factor (HGF) and presents it to c-MET. Activation of MET and the downstream signaling
  cascades require sustained activation of CD44-associated phosphorylated ezrin, radixin,
  and moesin (ERM) and SRC (Src) signaling via the Ras-MAPK and the PI3K-Akt pathway.
  Ras-Erk pathway can augment CD44v6 synthesis through a feedback loop between CD44v6
  and c-Met/Ras-Erk pathway.
