caption: 'MELK and stathmin signaling. MELK can induce stathmin expression through
  two transcription factors, p53 and FOXM1. A tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) is activated
  by phosphorylation after binding to a ligant. Growth factor receptor-bound protein
  2 (GRB2) binds to the phophorylated residue of TKR and to Son of Sevenless homologs
  (SOS). GRB/SOS complex activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and RAS-MAPK signaling
  pathways. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways results in phosphorylation of stathmin on serine
  sites and consequent microtubule stability and cell cycle progression. Stathmin
  may be dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
  and protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), resulting in microtubule instability. TKR: tyrosine
  kinase receptor; P: phosphorylation'
