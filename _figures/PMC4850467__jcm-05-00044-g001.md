caption: Overview of the molecular networks by which different compounds in cigarette
  smoke regulate EMT. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) found in cigarette smoke can activate
  SRC resulting in cytoskeletal modification. Nicotine can induce EMT through nAChRs-dependent
  and nAChRs-independent pathways. In the nAChRs-dependent pathway, the activation
  of nAChRs results in the recruitment of β-arrestin1 on to the promoters and promotes
  the expression of mesenchymal markers. Additionally, the activation of nAChRs also
  induces the expression of periostin, the overexpression of which has been reported
  to cause EMT. In the nAChRs-independent pathway, nicotine can induce EMT through
  upregulating miR-21 in a manner dependent on TGF-β signaling. Nicotine-derived nitrosamine
  ketone (NNK) has been found to upregulate the expression of the mesenchymal marker
  fibronectin through cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is mediated by the activation
  of a7-nAChR. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) can mediate EMT through the
  activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), which triggers
  a marked cytoskeleton remodeling associated with the activation of the JUN N-terminal
  kinase (JNK) pathway. Increased nuclear accumulation of AhR in response to PAH also
  leads to transcriptional activation of SLUG.
