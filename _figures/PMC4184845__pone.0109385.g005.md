caption: 'A: JMY is involved in oocyte maturation and asymmetric spindle migration,
  presumably via its actin nucleation promoting activity. B: Upon DNA damage, JMY
  have a tendency to nuclear accumulation, which is recruited to the promoters of
  p53 target genes and facilitates the p53 response.'
