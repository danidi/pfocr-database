caption: Proposed DAP12 signaling pathway in macrophages and osteoclasts. In response
  to ligation of TREM2, Src family kinases phosphorylate the ITAM of DAP12 and the
  YINM motif of DAP10, which form docking sites for the Syk and p85, with the subsequent
  recruitment of PLC-γ2 and Grb2. This signaling complex then leads to the activation
  of Akt, ERK1/2, and Vav3. Simultaneously, SHIP1 is recruited to the DAP12 ITAM where
  it may dislodge or prevent the further recruitment of SH2 domain–containing proteins,
  including p85 and Syk. This leads to an arrest in the activation of PI3K, ERK, Akt,
  and VAV3. The absence of SHIP1 enables prolonged signaling in response to the activation
  of DAP12, which leads to enhanced osteoclastogenesis. Low-avidity ligands of macrophages
  or bacteria may preferentially recruit SHIP1, whereas high-avidity ligands or receptor
  cross-linking may induce a strong activation of PI3K and Syk.
