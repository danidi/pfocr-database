caption: 'The complement cascade. This figure represents the complement cascade with
  3 pathways of the complement cascade represented. The lectin and classical pathways
  are antigen–antibody complex related, whereas the alternative is continuously activated
  in blood plasma. The alternative cascade leads to the destruction of host cells.
  During the mid-secretory phase, DAF is upregulated and inhibits all pathways of
  the complement cascade. However, in early pregnancy, only the alternative pathway
  is inhibited by CFH. The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of significant
  upregulation (red), downregulation (blue) with a cutoff >2-fold; gray nodes represent
  genes present in the data set, but which did not reach the cutoff; white nodes are
  genes that belong to the canonical pathway but are not present in the data set.
  Nodes with double circle have more than one member. The bar graph near the node
  represents the gene expression in MSE, LSE, and Preg samples, respectively, from
  left to right. Numbers below nodes represent fold change between Preg and MSE (upper
  lane), and P value (bottom lane). C indicates complement component; M, mannose-binding
  lectin (protein C) 2, soluble (opsonic defect; SERPING1, serpin peptidase inhibitor,
  clade G (C1 inhibitor), member 1 (angioedema, hereditary); MASP, manna-binding lectin
  serine peptidase; BF, complement factor B; DAF, decay accelerating factor for complement;
  MCP, CD46 molecule, complement regulatory protein; CR1, complement component (3b/4b)
  receptor 1; DF, complement factor D (adipsin); IF, complement factor I; HF1, complement
  factor H; MSE, mid-secretory endometrium; LSE, late secretory endometrium; Preg,
