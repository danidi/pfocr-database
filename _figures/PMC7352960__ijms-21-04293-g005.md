caption: Scheme of mechanisms that might contribute to the dystrophy progression in
  dysferlinopathies. (a) In a healthy condition, the damage in plasma membrane is
  rapidly repaired, and only a local increase of Ca2+ is produced. (b) In a dysferlinopathy
  condition, the membrane repair is impaired [], and non-selective channels, such
  as connexin-based hemichannels, P2X7 receptors and transient receptor potential
  TRPV2 channels are de novo expressed [,]. This could contribute to an altered Ca2+
  homeostasis [], mitochondrial dysfunction [], ROS production [], and consequently
  OS, resulting in lipid peroxidation (LpOx) and protein oxidation (P Ox) []. OS further
  conduces to the activation of the NF-κB inflammatory signaling pathway []. On the
  other hand, an altered Ca2+ homeostasis might also lead to the activation of breakdown
  protein pathways such as calpains, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and autophagy [],
  whose overactivation also results muscle atrophy []. NAC reduces OS and NF-κB inflammatory
  signaling pathway [].
