caption: 'A portion of the purine biosynthesis and salvage pathway rendered from YeastCyc
  and enriched with the annotated feature and MS/MS (*) identified compound results.
  Metabolites detected are highlighted in blue and accompanied by a heat strip that
  shows log2 normalized relative abundance as detected per treatment condition; from
  left to right: calcium, red; CsA, orange; FK506, yellow; wild-type, grey. Boxes
  indicate gene/enzyme interaction nodes, which contain the genes described, but are
  not depicted.'
