caption: Schematic of the insulin-like growth factor system role in PMSC differentiation
  into the skeletal muscle. PMSCs isolated from the chorionic villus of preterm human
  placenta differentiated into the skeletal muscle under appropriate culture conditions.
  As PMSCs differentiated into the skeletal muscle, the levels of the potency-associated
  markers decreased, cells became committed to the muscle lineage, and skeletal muscle
  differentiation marker levels increased. IGFs bind to the IGF-1R and activate the
  tyrosine kinase activity to achieve muscle differentiation via downstream signaling
  pathway (PI3K-AKT and MAPK). The insulin receptor is also important in PMSC skeletal
  muscle differentiation. Moreover, IGFBP-6, due to its location, binds IGFs and enhances
  the muscle differentiation process through the IGF-1R or directly impacts PMSC muscle
  differentiation through IGF-independent functions. When IGF-1R or IR was inhibited
  in vitro, IGFBP-6 addition enhanced the muscle differentiation process of PMSCs
  with MAPK being a critical pathway for this differentiation process.
