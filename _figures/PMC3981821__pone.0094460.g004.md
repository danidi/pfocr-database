number: Figure 4
caption: '(A) Relative quantities of metabolites in Huh7.5 (left column) cells and
  HPI cells (right column) are superimposed on a metabolic map of the cholesterol
  biosynthesis pathway according to the data (, ). The metabolic map is depicted based
  on KEGG pathways (http://www.genome.jp/keg/). The NADPH/NADP+ reaction, if associated,
  was added to the main reaction. Height of column with larger quantity is set to
  100%, and that of smaller quantity are shown proportionally. Numbers on the right
  columns indicate the fold-change of HPI compared to Huh7.5, and the color of the
  column represents: yellow (> = 1.4-fold), blue ( = <0.7-fold), or gray (0.7∼1.4-fold).
  ¶: A metabolite appearing on other figure. Genes (italicized) located between metabolites
  encode enzyme(s) for a corresponding reaction with fold-expressions of HPI to Huh7.5
  according to the data (). A gene encoding a rate-limiting enzyme is surrounded by
  a square. *: Immunoblot analysis was also done for confirmation in (B). N.D.: Not
  detected. n.a.: Not assessed because of low expression. (B) Immunoblot analysis
  of the selected enzymes. Beta-actin was used as a control.'
