caption: The generalized metabolic disturbances in PAH lungs indicated by the untargeted
  metabolic profiling. A central role of mitochondrial metabolism in reprogramming
  is attributed to a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation due to respiratory chain
  deficiency and reduced glucose oxidation due to pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency.
  Reduction in fatty acid transport leads to a decrease in fatty acid oxidation. TCA
  cycle metabolites flux is upregulated by anaplerotic reactions that are required
  for the building blocks production for cellular proliferation instead of energy
  metabolism. This mitochondrial metabolic shift is accompanied with an increase in
  glycolysis for the energy demand and downstream of glycolysis metabolic pathways
  such as pentose phosphate pathway, nucleotide biosynthesis, and increased glycosylation,
  leading to proliferation and ECM remodeling. Another point of dysregulation is the
  nitric oxide and urea cycles, leading to vasoconstriction, increased reactive oxygen
  species/reactive nitrogen species, and polyamines production. Overall metabolic
  shift in lungs favors proliferation and dysfunction of cellular roles in all varieties
  of vascular cells. ECM, extracellular matrix; NO, nitric oxide; PAH, pulmonary arterial
  hypertension; TCA, tricarboxylic acid. Color images are available online.
