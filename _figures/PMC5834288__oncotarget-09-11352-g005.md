caption: (A) “→” The activation of the process, “ -| ” the inhibition of the process,
  “– –” the presence of intermediate steps either unknown or omitted. The DEPs were
  marked in red font, DEPPs were marked in purple font, and the shared proteins were
  labeled with a light yellow box. Glycogenolysis was highlighted by an orange background,
  and glycolysis was highlighted with a blue background. (B) Seventeen DEPs/DEPPs
  in both proteomics and phosphoproteomics data involved in glycolysis and glycogenolysis
  pathways respectively were identified and validated. (C) MSTN, Akt1, and 17 DEPs/DEPPs
  were submitted to conduct blast searching against the existing databases in STRING
  10 software. (D) Western Blot result of pAkt1 (Ser-473), demonstrating pAkt1 (Ser-473)
  is up-regulated in MSTN−/−than WT. These blots were cropped and original and original
  images were shown in .
