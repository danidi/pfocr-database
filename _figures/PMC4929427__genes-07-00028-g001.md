caption: The regulation of Hippo signalling in Drosophila melanogaster. The scheme
  summarises the canonical Hippo pathway and some of the non-canonical functions described
  to date. The proliferative signals are represented in orange and the pro-apoptotic
  signals are represented in blue. The black box illustrates the newly described transcription
  factors binding to Yki.
