caption: Schematic representation of pentose and D-galactose catabolism in light.
  Enzymes encoded by genes, which are positively regulated in light are highlighted
  in yellow. An influence of BLR1, BLR2 or ENV1 is indicated by their pictograms next
  to the enzyme. Metabolic intermediates of the pathway, on which growth is enhanced
  in light (BIOLOG assay) are represented with a green shadow. From the remaining
  intermediates, only D-xylose was also part of the assay, but no differences in growth
  were observed in wild-type or mutant strains. Galactitol, L-Xylo-3-hexulose, L-arabitol,
  D-Xylulose were not tested.
