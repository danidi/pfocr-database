caption: Model describing requirement of Rev7 in ICL repair. A, processing of ICLs
  in the G1 phase of the cell cycle involves nucleotide excision repair (NER) and
  endonucleolytic cleavage of ICL. PCNA becomes mono-ubiquitinated by E2 ubiquitin
  ligases in response to DNA damage, which allows loading of TLS polymerases and bypass
  of the lesion followed by nucleotide excision repair of the damaged DNA. B, in the
  S phase of the cell cycle, ICL repair requires an upstream FA pathway coupled to
  Polζ (left panel). FA core proteins are recruited by FANCM (M) to the ICL (red bar),
  which monoubiquitinates the FA-II complex followed by DNA incision and unhooking
  of the cross-linked DNA. On the incised strand, TLS polymerase is recruited to bypass
  the unhooked cross-link followed by nucleotide excision repair. However, the Rev7C70R
  mutation disrupts formation of Polζ, leading to incomplete DNA replication and persistence
  of S phase-stalled cells with double-strand breaks (right panel). Thus, Polζ is
  the TLS polymerase downstream of the FA pathway required to resolve ICL and relieve
  DNA replication arrest in S phase.
