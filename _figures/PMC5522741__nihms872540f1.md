caption: Aging is a complicated process, often characterized by increased ROS and
  inflammation. Whether this increase is a cause or an effect is still unclear. There
  is evidence that aging and increased ROS production lead to impaired FOXO1, AMPK,
  and SIRT1 signaling, possibly leading to a decrease in the catabolic pathways promoting
  obesity. In addition, leptin resistance is associated with aging and may further
  dampen catabolic signaling, which may lead to more inflammation and ROS production.
