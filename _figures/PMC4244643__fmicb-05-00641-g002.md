caption: Enzymatic pathway of archaeal lipid biosynthesis. The soluble enzymes of
  the pathway are colored in blue and the membrane proteins in green. The biosynthetic
  steps leading to the formation of tetraether lipids is unknown. Archaetidylserine
  (AS) and saturated AS (sAS) are depicted as an example of polar head group modification.
  Isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) are isomers.
  GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate; G1P, sn-glycerol-1-phosphate; GGGP, 3-O-geranylgeranyl-sn-glyceryl-1-phosphate;
  DGGGP, 2,3-bis-O- geranylgeranyl-sn-glyceryl-1-phosphate.
