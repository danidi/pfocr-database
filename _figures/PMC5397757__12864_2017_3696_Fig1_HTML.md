caption: Pheromone-biosynthetic pathways. MPB pheromone biosynthetic pathways. a (–)-trans-Verbenol
  is produced by a single P450-mediated hydroxylation of (–)-α-pinene. b Frontalin
  biosynthesis occurs through the mevalonate pathway to geranylgeranyl diphosphate
  followed by multiple steps likely catalyzed by P450s, a dioxygenase, and a cyclase.
  c exo-Brevicomin production from long chain fatty acid precursors in the fat body
  of unfed males involves steps catalyzed by P450s, a short chain dehydrogenase, and
  a cyclase. Previously identified/characterized enzymes are in blue font. Chemical
  structures were generated using PubChem Sketcher V2.4, https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/edit2/index.html
