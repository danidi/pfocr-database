caption: Diagram of a clinical trial with a PI3K pathway inhibitor in AI-resistant
  breast cancer. Patients with breast cancer that progressed on AI therapy will be
  subjected to a biopsy to confirm ER+, HER2-negative, PIK3CA-mutant status. Eligible
  patients would then be randomized to another AI plus a PI3K inhibitor, or fulvestrant
  plus the PI3K inhibitor. FDG-PET scans would be performed before and after 4 weeks
  of therapy to identify early metabolic changes. Patients will be treated until progression.
