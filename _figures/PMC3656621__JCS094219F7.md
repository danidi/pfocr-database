caption: Hypothetical model showing how Vam6, Gtr1–Gtr2 and TORC1 respond to amino
  acids. Amino acids activate Tor2 by means of Vam6 and the Rag proteins to induce
  translation and promote cell growth. In the presence of amino acids, Gtr1 interacts
  strongly with Gtr2 and this heterodimer binds Vam6. Vam6 would activate Gtr1 and
  this, in turn, would bind to the TORC1 complex by means of Mip1. The active TORC1
  complex induces Rps6 phosphorylation and, hence, induces cell growth and inhibit
  sexual differentiation. This activation would occur in the vacuolar membrane, where
  all the components would interact strongly in an amino-acid-dependent manner.
