caption: Eosinophils extravasate from the peripheral blood into the lung during RSV
  infection. The details of how the virus regulates the recruited eosinophils to help
  combat the infection remain to be determined. Phipps and coworkers show that some
  TLR-7 is present on the outer surface of the mouse eosinophil. However, most TLR-7
  resides inside the cell, presumably in an endosomal and/or lysosomal compartment.
  Once viral ssRNA comes in contact with TLR-7, activation of an IRF7-dependent signaling
  pathway occurs, which eventually results in the release of the cell's preformed
  granule mediators (eg, EPX) and newly generated cytokines (eg, IFN-β) that contributeto
  the host's antiviral response. The activated eosinophil also increases its expression
  of important surface proteins like CD11b/ITGAM.
