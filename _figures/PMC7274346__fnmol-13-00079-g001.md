caption: Biogenesis and cell-to-cell communication of extracellular vesicles (EV),
  especially exosomes. Exosomes are formed by the inward budding of the multivesicular
  body (MVB) membrane, which is formed by invagination of the endosomal membrane.
  Early endosomes go through transition to late endosomes and are further burdened
  to form late MVBs containing intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) (). Cargo sorting into
  exosomes involves the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-dependent
  mechanism, which are managed by ESCRT proteins (ESCRT-0, I, II, and III) and their
  accessories (ALIX, TSG101, and VPS32) (; ), and ESCRT-independent mechanism, which
  are mediated by neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMaseII), tetraspanins, and the chaperone
  heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSC70), can develop ILVs (). ILVs have two fates,
  either fusing with the lysosome resulting in the degradation of the ILVs and their
  contents for recycling as an endolysosomal pathway (), or fusing with the plasma
  membrane where they are released into the extracellular space as exosomes through
  a secretory pathway (). Microvesicles are formed directly by outward budding of
  the plasma membrane, a course which is managed by the ESCRT components and ADP ribosylation
  factor 6 (ARF6), some small GTPases, lipids, and Ca2+-dependent enzymatic machineries
  (). Apoptotic bodies are the largest of the EVs. They “bleb” off the cell membrane
  and contain material from cells undergoing apoptosis, which are typically engulfed
  by macrophages (). After release into the extracellular space, exosomes can be internalized
  by recipient cells mediated by the interaction of various exosomal surface proteins
  and cellular receptors via several mechanisms including phagocytosis, plasma membrane
  fusion, macropinocytosis and endocytosis (). The contents of exosomes can effectively
  influence cellular processes through taking part in genetic/protein transfer, transcriptional
  regulation or post-transcriptional regulation. Alternatively, exosomes can be further
  fused with the lysosomes for degradation (; ).
