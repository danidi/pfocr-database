caption: A) Gene array analyses were performed on liver fragments from control and
  SrfloxP/loxPAlfpcre livers that had low to undetectable levels of Srf mRNA by RT–PCR.
  Genes whose expression was significantly (p≤0.05) changed in SRF null livers were
  categorized based on gene function by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Fischer’s
  exact test was used to calculate a p-value determining the probability that each
  function assigned to the data set is due to chance alone. The x-axis lists the top
  cellular and molecular pathways affected by the loss of SRF in the liver. The y-axis
  expresses the statistical significance–log(p-value). B) Schematic showing that several
  genes encoding factors required for IGF1–mediated cell cycle control were negatively
  affected (grey symbols with fold change) by loss of SRF. (*) denote fold differences
  that approached significance, but where p>0.05.
