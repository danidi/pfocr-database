caption: Proposed mechanism by which miR-21 links hepatic lipid accumulation and the
  development of cancer. Hbp1 is a transcriptional activator of p53, a suppressor
  of cell cycle progression and inhibitor of lipogenesis by inhibiting transcription
  of Srebp1c. By directly inhibiting Hbp1 expression, miR-21 prevents expression of
  p53, which facilitates transcription of genes that are required for lipogenesis
  and the G1/S transition of cell cycle. As a result, increased miR-21 promotes both
  hepatic lipid accumulation and potentially carcinogenesis.
