caption: Potential functional outcomes of hEXO1-14-3-3 association in the DDR. Model
  of three plausible outcomes hEXO1/14-3-3 association presumed to indirectly regulate
  hEXO1 excision activity upon DNA damage induction. (A) Extensive 5′ → 3′ DNA resection
  by hEXO1 at the DNA damage site is possibly hindered by protein phosphorylation
  and subsequent binding by 14-3-3 proteins, mediating its ubiquitination and degradation.
  (B) Active hEXO1 at the DNA damage site is initially phosphorylated or otherwise
  modified which enables 14-3-3 binding. Chk1 is also phosphorylated in response to
  DNA damage and associates specifically with 14-3-3 proteins. 14-3-3 scaffolding
  of Chk1 and hEXO1 could mediate further phosphorylation of hEXO1 by Chk1 inhibiting
  its activity and preventing excessive DNA resection at the damage site. (C) Binding
  of hEXO1 by 14-3-3 might be related to inhibition of its apoptotic signaling ability,
  either mediated by nuclear export or altered protein affinity towards other binding
  partners in the apoptotic pathway.
