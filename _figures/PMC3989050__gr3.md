caption: The M3-muscarinic receptor expressed in β-islets of the pancreas is involved
  in the augmentation of insulin release in response to increasing concentrations
  of glucose. This response appears to be mediated by two signalling pathways. The
  first is M3-receptor mediated signalling to Gq/11-protein and calcium mobilisation,
  driving the early phase of insulin release. The second sustained phase of insulin
  release phase is dependent on receptor phosphorylation/arrestin mediated activation
  of the atypical PKC, PKD1. Since type II diabetes is characterised by a deficiency
  in the early phase of insulin release, it would seem that a compound that targeted
  the M3-muscarinic receptor in a manner that preferentially drove signalling through
  the Gq/11-protein pathway would provide greatest clinical efficacy.
