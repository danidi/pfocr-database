caption: 'Metastasis occurs through a series of stages: local invasion, intravasation,
  extravasation and colonization (as indicated by the blue boxes). Protein-coding
  genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) that promote (shown in green) or prevent (shown in
  red) metastasis are involved at each step (the figure covers only those pathways
  that are discussed in the main text). miR-200 directly represses the expression
  of the mesenchymal markers zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and ZEB2
  in quiescent cells. As such, during the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)
  when miR-200 levels are reduced, the expression of ZEB1 and ZEB2 becomes elevated.
  ZEB1 and ZEB2 transcriptionally repress E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule that
  is lost in aggressive and metastatic tumours; thus, cells missing miR-200 are more
  able to disseminate and invade surrounding tissue. Furthermore, the inhibition between
  miR-200, and ZEB1 and ZEB2 is mutual, leading to a potentially bistable system:
  either high miR-200 and low ZEB1 and ZEB2 levels, or high ZEB1 and ZEB2 and low
  miR-200 levels. This latter state would seem to be particularly dangerous and could
  lead to aggressive tumours. Based on its miRNA-processing ability, DICER is positioned
  upstream of miR-200. DICER1 itself is positively regulated at the transcriptional
  level by the full-length isoform of p63 (TAp63), and is negatively regulated by
  miR-103, miR-107 and let-7. In addition to suppressing DICER expression, let-7 also
  inhibits the oncogenic RAS–RAF–MEK pathway and HMGA2, an upstream activator of SNAIL.
  SNAIL inhibits E-cadherin, leading to local invasion and intravasation. Antimetastatic
  miRNAs that are involved outside of the E-cadherin pathway include miR-10b, which
  suppresses the expression of HOXD10; miR-335, which impairs SOX4 and tenascin C
  (TNC) signalling; and miR-31, which prevents all steps of metastasis through inhibiting
  the expression of integrin-α5, radixin (RDX) and RHOA. RKIP, RAF kinase inhibitory
  protein.'
