caption: Schematic of crosstalk between TLR pathway and MHC molecules. (A) The traditional
  view of TLR signaling which holds that TLR ligation initiates several signaling
  cascades within the cell that drive the production of type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines that are essential for both innate and adaptive immune responses resulting
  in pathogen clearance. (B) Recent evidence has shown that a second pathway involving
  crosstalk between the TLR pathway and MHC pathway is initiated. This crosstalk results
  in the formation the Btk-CD40-MHC class II signaling complex at the endosome that
  enhances TLR-driven cytokine production. Ligation of TLRs also results in the inhibition
  of MARCH-1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of MHC class II molecules, potentially
  increasing the pool of intracellular MHC class II molecules available to form the
  MHC-Btk signalosome at the endosome.
