caption: Corin and ANP in cardiovascular biology and disease. Corin converts pro-ANP
  to ANP, which in return enhances cardiac function, renal sodium excretion, vasodilation,
  and uterine spiral artery remodeling. Defects in the corin and ANP pathway may lead
  to major diseases, such as cardiac hypertrophy (CH), heart failure (HF), hypertension
  (HP), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and pre-eclampsia (PE).
