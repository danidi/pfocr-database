caption: 'Susceptibility and protective factors of the lectin pathway of complement
  and complement receptors, for HBV infection per se and HBV infection/leprosy. (A)
  High levels of fully functional proteins from the lectin pathway (with the possible
  exception of MASP-3), and probably also of complement receptors (CR1 and CRIg, officially
  VSIG4), are necessary to defeat HBV infection through complement activation and
  opsonophagocytosis. Recognition of HBV-associated molecular patterns by MBL and
  FCNs associated with MASPs causes MASP-1 autoactivation, MASP-1-driven transactivation
  of MASP-2 (complexed to another MBL or FCN oligomer), cleavage of C4 and C2, formation
  of the C3 convertase and cleavage of C3, covering the virus with C3b opsonins. These
  are recognized by CR1 and CRIg complement receptors, leading to phagocytosis and
  viral destruction. FCN-1 may also be presented on the phagocyte cell surface through
  recognition of self-sialic acid residues, but its function as a membrane receptor
  remains elusive. (B) In contrast, low levels of pattern-recognition receptors of
  the lectin pathway (marked with an asterisk), as well as of other complement proteins,
  are associated with higher susceptibility to HBV infection and leprosy/HBV infection
  (represented by Mycobacterium leprae within the phagolysosome). The associated polymorphisms
  cause: dysfunctional MBL, FCN-3 and MASP-2 molecules (given by the p.57E “C” variant
  in MBL, the frameshift caused by the +1637 deletion in FCN-3, and p.439H variant
  in MASP-2), lower MASP-1 levels and higher MASP-3 levels (associated with the MASP1*AC_CC
  haplotype), lower FCN-2 serum levels due to preferential alternative splicing of
  exon 2 and production of higher amounts of FCN-2 proteins with a shorter collagenous
  tail (associated with the FCN2*GGGCAC haplotype), and lower levels of functional
  FCN-1 levels (associated with eQTLs of the FCN1*1 haplotype). These alterations
  are expected to greatly reduce activation of the lectin complement pathway or to
  inhibit it (e.g., due to higher MASP-3 levels, as well as dysfunctional MASP-2 molecules).
  Furthermore, the p.1208Arg encoded by CR1*3A haplotypes and CRIg molecules encoded
  by VSIG4*TGGRCG increase susceptibility to the disease, probably by affecting internalization
  of the virus. MBL, Mannan-binding lectin; FCN, ficolin; MASP, MBL-associated serine
