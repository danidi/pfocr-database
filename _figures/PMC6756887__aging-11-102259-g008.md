caption: Graphical abstract of the senescence pathway in Idh2-deficient conditions.
  Idh2 deficiency-induced ROS generation accelerates p53 and p21 signaling pathways
  which inhibit Cdk2 expression. Furthermore, overexpression of Idh2 prevented senescence-associated
  phenotypes by decreasing the levels of senescence signaling pathway-associated proteins
  p21 and p53.
