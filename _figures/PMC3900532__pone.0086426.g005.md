caption: For M1 polarization, THP-1 cells were treated with PMA (320 nM) for 6 hours
  and then cultured with PMA plus LPS (10 ng/ml) and INFγ (20 ng/ml,) for another
  42 hours. After replacement of culture medium, PMA-treated control macrophages (gray
  bar, n = 6) and M1 macrophages (blue bar, n = 6) were incubated under normoxic (21%
  O2) condition for 6 hours, or the M1 macrophages were incubated hypoxic (1% O2)
  conditions for 6 hours (red bar, n = 6). Metabolite levels are expressed as pmol/106
  cell. *p<0.01 vs. PMA control, †p<0.05 vs. PMA control, §p<0.01 vs. M1 normoxia,
