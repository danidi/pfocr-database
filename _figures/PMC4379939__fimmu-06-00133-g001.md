caption: The as yet unknown side of DC secretion post-TLR activation, and trafficking
  molecules currently identified in DC function. Following TLR activation with TLR
  ligands, such as LPS, DCs activate intracellular pathways that lead to the transcription
  of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines. While this pathway is extremely well
  defined (black arrows), very little is known of the post-transcriptional pathway
  and how proteins, in particular cytokines, are trafficked out of the DC. It is evident
  from other cell types that SNARE proteins play a role in secretion of cytokines;
  however, to date, their specific role has not yet been described. SNARE importance
  in DCs has been highlighted by studies that demonstrate that STX4 on the phagosome
  interacts with Sec22b on the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, which is required
  for cross-presentation and MyD88-dependent TLR signaling, and results in phosphorylation
  of SNAP23 present on the phagosome. This leads to fusion with endosomal recycling
  compartment (ERC) and ultimately cross-presentation. Furthermore, VAMP8 has been
  shown to be a negative regulator of phagocytosis (red arrows). Our recent work has
  indicated a role for STX3 in IL-6 and possibly MIP1-α secretion (green arrows).
  This work and others also suggests a role for STX11 in DC function as it is highly
  up-regulated post TLR2, TLR4, and TLR7 activation.
