caption: Highly simplified schematic of PKA involvement in the AHP reduction after
  learning. Under normal condition, the Ca2+ influx into the cytosol, via the L-type
  Ca2+ channel and internal Ca2+ stores, activates the AHP. During learning, activation
  of monoamine receptors (e.g., noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin) along with a rise
  in internal Ca2+ levels activate adenylyl cyclase, causing an increase in cAMP levels
  leading to PKA activation (reviewed in (, , , ). Activated PKA leads to MAPK/ERK
  activation of the CREB signaling pathway, ultimately leading to gene transcription
  and translation. The activated CREB and PKA also lead to a reduction in the AHP.
  This reduced AHP channel activity, in turn, would lead to a longer duration depolarization,
  resulting in a longer time window for the continuation of the cAMP/PKA signaling
  cascade.
