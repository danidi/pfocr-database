caption: Diagrammatic representation of the top three canonical signaling pathways,
  proposed by the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis program, associated with differentially
  expressed genes in the microarray dataset. (A) The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated
  (ATM) signaling pathway. (B) The mitotic roles of the polo-like kinase (PLK). C)
  The rod phototransduction pathway. Genes that displayed an increase in expression
  in XOPS-mCFP retinas compared to wild-type are shaded in red; genes that displayed
  a decrease in expression are shaded in green. The hatched shading for ATM (A) and
  rhodopsin (C) indicates their manual annotation in the pathways. A legend describing
  the symbols used in each pathway is shown in the upper right portion of the figure.
