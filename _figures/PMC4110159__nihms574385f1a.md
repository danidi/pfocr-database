caption: PD-1’s role in inhibiting the immune response through T cell activity downregulation.
  T cells recognize antigens presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
  on tumor cells through interactions with the T cell receptor (TCR). Programmed death
  1 (PD-1) is an inhibitory receptor that can terminate or inhibit T cell immune response
  when interacting with programmed death ligand 1 (PD- L1). (A) Tumor cells that express
  PD-L1 can evade immune response by regulating the activity of T cells through PD-1.
  (B) By blocking the PD-1 receptor with an anti-PD-1 mAb, such as nivolumab or MK-3475,
  T cells are not inhibited by tumor-expressed PD-L1 and are free to mount an immune
  response against melanoma tumor cells.
