caption: Daam2 associates with PIP5K and promotes the clustering of Wnt receptor complexes
  into signalosomes through PIP2. The net result of signalosome formation is the amplification
  and maintenance of Wnt signal transduction, which in OLP populations serves to suppress
  their differentiation into myelinating OLs during development and after WMI. Our
  pharmacological studies point to the Daam2-PIP5K relationship as a potential therapeutic
  node that could be used to screen for inhibitors that disrupt Daam2-PIP5K interactions,
  culminating in decreased levels of Wnt signaling and increased OL generation after
  WMI. ** PIP2 phosphorylation of LRP6 was demonstrated previously in Xenopus ().
