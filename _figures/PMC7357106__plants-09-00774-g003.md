caption: 'Gene co-expression network developed to analyze the connectivity between
  isoflavonoid biosynthetic pathway and MYB genes. Genes shown with the same color
  show a similar transcriptional regulation in all data analyzed. Grey lines indicate
  the interconnections between isoflavonoid and MYB genes, and red lines link probesets
  with gene names or Kazusa codes of genes. The co-expression network was visualized
  using Cytoscape and analyzed using the NetworkAnalyzer []. Gene abbreviations as
  described in  and other codes as reported in Kazusa 2.5 terminology. Gene codes
  according to the 3.0 version of the L. japonicus genome are: LjIFS1 (Lj4g3v0485090.1);
  LjI2’H1 (Lj2g3v1925730.1); LjI2’H2 (Lj4g3v0189840.1); LjHID4 (Lj5g3v2057520.1);
