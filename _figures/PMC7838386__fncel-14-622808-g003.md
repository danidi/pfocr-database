caption: Extracellular factors govern dendritic morphogenesis via convergent signaling.
  (A) Model showing a multicomponent receptor-ligand complex regulating C. elegans
  PVD dendrite arborization. During the initiation of tertiary and quaternary PVD
  dendrite branches, membrane-associated protein, SAX-7/L1CAM, is expressed in a striped
  pattern in the underlying epidermis that correlates with the positions of dendrite
  branches. Surface expression of DMA-1 of PVD neuron receives extracellular signals
  via interactions with epidermal SAX-7/L1CAM and MNR-1, and the soluble ligand LECT-2
  to function with HPO-30 and downstream effectors, TIAM-1 and the WRC (WAVE Regulatory
  Complex), that promote F-actin assembly, thereby resulting in dendritic branching
  at precise localization (). (B) Two afferent-derived factors, Activin and DILP2,
  regulate Dm8 dendritic field size antagonistically. During the early pupal stage,
  insulin-like protein DILP2 derived locally from L5 neurons activates Insulin receptor
  (InR) and its canonical PI3K/AKT/TOR signaling pathway in Dm8 dendrites. Subsequent
  SREBP activation induces lipogenesis and stimulates Dm8 dendrite expansion. In the
  late pupal stage, InR expression declines, followed by the expression of Activin,
  which is derived from R7s. Activin acts on its receptor, Baboon, in Dm8 dendrites
  to restrict the expansion of the dendritic field. This temporal antagonistic regulation
  is accomplished by multiple afferent-derived morphogens and contributes to the robust
  and stereotyped control of Dm8 dendritic tree size ().
