caption: 'Posttranscriptional mechanisms by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulating
  mRNA stability. (a) TTP, AUF1, and KSRP are representative RBPs that promote mRNA
  decay by binding to an AU-rich element (ARE) present in 3′UTR. HuR is an RBP that
  inhibits mRNA decay by competing for ARE sites. (b) TTP promotes mRNA decay through
  the recruitment of the deadenylation complex, CCR4-NOT, and Dcp1 and Dcp2 decapping
  enzymes. This can be suppressed by MK2-mediated phosphorylation of TTP, which is
  induced downstream of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in response to
  TLR4 activation. The phosphorylated form of TTP is sequestered by the 14-3-3 protein,
  which results in enhanced stability of target mRNAs. (c) Regnase-1 and Roquin are
  representative RBPs that recognize stem-loop structures present in 3′UTR. There
  are two distinct mRNA decay mechanisms: (1) Endonucleolytic cleavage by endonucleases
  and (2) mRNA decay induced by recruitment of the deadenylation complex and decapping
  enzymes. (1) Regnase-1 is an endonuclease that recognizes the stem-loop structure,
  and cooperatively promotes cleavage of target mRNA with UPF1. However, this process
  can be blocked by Arid5a. In addition, Regnase-1-mediated mRNA decay is also regulated
  when this protein undergoes IKK-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal
  degradation. (d) Malt1 is a key component of the T cell receptor (TCR)-signaling
  pathway that contributes to posttranscriptional mechanisms. After the engagement
  of TCR, Malt1 is activated as a component of the Card11-Bcl10-Malt1 (CBM) complex
  downstream of PKCθ. Malt1 also acts on a set of substrates for its paracaspase,
  including Regnase-1, N4BP1, and Roquin. Malt1-mediated cleavage deactivates these
  proteins.'
