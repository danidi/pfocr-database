caption: Schematic model of UHRF1 structure and its role in the regulation of the
  epigenetic code (DNA methylation and histone modifications). Through its SRA domain,
  UHRF1 interacts with DNMT1 and HDAC1. Using its PHD domain, UHRF1 may interact with
  the histone methyltransferase G9a and also with DNMT1. UHRF1 may be autoubiquitinated
  by its RING domain, encompassing an E3 ligase activity. By its interaction with
  HAUSP, UHRF1 may be protected from autoubiquitination. The TTD is involved in histone
  methylation reading with the subsequent recruitment of the histone methyltransferases
  G9a and Suv39H1. The UBL domain may be involved in the proteasome pathway. The question
  mark represents a putative interaction that requires further confirmation. SRA,
  SET- and RING-associated; DNMT1, DNA methyltransferase 1; HDAC1, histone deacetylase
  1; PHD, plant homeodomain; RING, really interesting new gene; UHRF1, ubiquitin-like
  with PHD and RING finger domains 1; HUASP, herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific
  protease; TTD, tandem Tudor domain; UBL, ubiquitin-like; Tip60, Tat-interacting
  protein 60; UB, ubiquitin.
