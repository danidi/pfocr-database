caption: The role of the Nrf2 pathway in PD pathogenesis. In the case of oxidative
  damage, mitochondria produce increased amounts of ROS. Then, ROS activate Nrf2 bound
  to Keap1 in the cytoplasm, and it translocates into the nucleus to transactivate
  the transcription of ARE-bearing genes, which in turn activates the antioxidant
  defense system and mitochondrial biogenesis. In this pathway, PD-related genes are
  also involved. DJ-1 is found to inhibit oxidative damage in mitochondria. Another
  PD-related gene is PINK, which prevents impaired membrane potential of mitochondria
  and prevents apoptosis by counteracting cytochrome c release that leads to apoptosis
  of nigral cells. Lastly, Parkin was found to inhibit cytochrome c release that leads
  to caspase activation and apoptosis of nigral cells.  Ubiquitin-interacting p62
  also has a role in Nrf2 activation. It normally plays a role in transportation of
  ubiquitinated proteins to autophagosome. p62 was found to be interacting with Keap1
  and transports it for autophagic degradation and provides indirect activation of
  Nrf2. p62 also has ARE in its promoter region which creates a positive feedback
  loop between Nrf2 and p62.
