caption: Complex interactions between intracellular cascades result in a unique pattern
  of astrocyte reactivity in ND. (1) Many signals can trigger astrocyte reactivity
  (see Section How do Astrocytes become Reactive? and Figure ) such as cytokines,
  purines or abnormal epitopes like aggregated proteins. Astrocytes may also react
  to the absence of “resting signals” from neighboring cells, which occurs with neuronal
  death in ND. (2) These molecular signals are detected by specific receptor complexes
  at the astrocyte membrane, which activate several signaling cascades such as the
  JAK/STAT3 pathway, the NF-κB pathway, and the MAP kinase pathway (see also Figure
  ). These pathways and their effectors interact either directly or indirectly, in
  the cytoplasm, in the nucleus, or on DNA promoter regions (see Section Additional
  Levels of Complexity). Recent studies support the idea that these cascades eventually
  converge on the JAK/STAT3 pathway, triggering a transcriptional program of reactivity
  in astrocytes. This program is modulated at several levels. (3) Disease-specific
  proteins (mHtt, mSOD1) endogenously expressed in astrocytes as well as internalized
  aggregated proteins (Aβ) can directly interfere with these signaling cascades or
  with transcriptional activity. (4) Several environmental factors may also affect
  the transcriptional program in reactive astrocytes, such as nuclear factors (other
  transcription factors, chromatin state) and environmental factors (age, sex). In
  the brain, dialog with other cell types or the specific brain regions involved is
  another potential level of modulation. These complex signaling cascades result in
  (5a) common features of astrocyte reactivity such as the upregulation of GFAP and
  cellular hypertrophy and (5b) disease-specific outcomes. This scheme illustrates
  how several signals can converge on a central signaling cascade that, in turn, is
  modulated in a disease- and environment-specific manner to produce a particular
  functional outcome.
