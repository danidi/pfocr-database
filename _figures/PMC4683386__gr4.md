caption: Metabolic interactions of the l-arginine-NO pathway during sildenafil therapy.
  The bioavailability of NO is influenced by a complex of factors. Oxidative stress,
  hypoxia, and reduced intensity of redox reactions are accompanied by increased levels
  of free fatty acids mostly oleic, linoleic, and docosahexanoic (DHA) with subsequent
  elevation of hydroxynonenal (HNE), which impairs the activity of endothelial NO
  synthase (eNOS) prompting NO deficiency state. Moreover, elevated levels of HNE
  contribute to depletion of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and, thus, can mediate uncoupling
  and generation of superoxide . Increased HNE is also associated with accumulation
  of the endogenous eNOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine . Moreover, HNE was
  demonstrated to suppress iNOS and inhibit NO formation due to activation of Nrf-2
  . That notion is further supported by a study demonstrating HNE directly forming
  adducts with transcriptional inhibitor Keap-1. Sildenafil improves NO signaling
  by blocking phosphodiesterase type 5 and increasing intracellular cGMP level leading
  to relaxation of smooth muscle cells, reducing vascular remodeling and vasoconstriction.
  At the same time, long term potentiation of l-arginine-NO-system by sildenafil may
  trigger hyperactivation of various cGMP-dependent signaling pathways, excessive
  prooxidant activity and exhaustion of antioxidant potential, which results in distorted
  feedback regulation. Such metabolic derangements are reflected by reduced heart
  rate variability and worsening of its spectral structure. The efficacy of long-term
  sildenafil therapy may be improved by concomitant stimulation of free radical reactions
  (FRR), maintenance of pO2 and development of mild prooxidant activity, which can
  be achieved with administration of intermittent hypoxic training, use of flavonoids
  or various supplements used as the sources of PUFAs (fish, plant oils, etc.).
