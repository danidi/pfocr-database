caption: Comparing ECM-receptor interaction pathway for (a) DA and (b) non-DA neurons
  based on DEGs and DEmiR. (a) For the DA neuron, the ECM-receptor interaction pathway
  was altered by DEGs (p < 0.05) and DEmiRs (p ≪ 0.001) with three possible miRNA
  regulatory points. (b) For the non-DA neuron, the pathway was similarly significant
  for DEGs (p < 0.05) and DEmiRs (p ≪ 0.001) with one miRNA targeting many genes.
  Purple nodes are significant DEmiRs, blue nodes are significant DEGs, and yellow
  nodes are non-significantly regulated genes.
