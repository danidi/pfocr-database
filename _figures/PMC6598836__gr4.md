caption: 'Essential metabolism and mitochondrial regulation on B cells (A) and Antibody-Secreting
  Cells (B). A. B cells are activated through T cell-independent or -dependent mechanisms.
  B cell activation increases both aerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS rates, enhancing
  the expression of the glucose transporter Glut1 and mitochondrial mass. Part of
  the TCA cycle fueling is used to de novo lipid biosynthesis via citrate transport
  from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm. B cell activation promotes both oxidants
  and antioxidants production, which the balance regulates B cell survival, effector
  functions and cell fate. Higher mtROS levels are important for sustaining both mitochondrial
  activity and mass, activating the CSR. On the other hand, lower mtROS levels were
  directly associated with plasma cell differentiation. Moreover, B cell activation
  also increases the mitochondria number and change their anatomy from an elongated
  to a rounded shape. Recently, CpG-stimulated TLR9 in B cells causes mtDNA releasing
  into the extracellular environment and its associated in stimulating anti-viral
  responses via type I IFN production. B. ASCs have high metabolic demand in order
  to produce antibodies. Part of the glucose is used to glycosylate antibodies and
  intracellular membrane expansion. Higher antioxidant activity is associated with
  increased IgM secretion by ASCs. Different subtypes of plasma cells show different
  metabolic profiles. LLPCs show increased glucose uptake, CD98 amino acid transporter
  expression and autophagosome mass compared to SLPCs. a.a: amino acids.ASC: Antibody-Secreting
