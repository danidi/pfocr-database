caption: Animal and cell culture experiments indicate that increased intracellular
  glucose metabolism by the polyol and hexosamine pathways occurs in complication-prone
  cell types in diabetes. There is also excessive activation of the PKC pathway and
  non-enzymatic glucose oxidation to advanced glycation end products (AGE). Mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation and ROS release production are increased. Changes in intermediate
  metabolism can have a sustained effect on gene expression by reprogramming the epigenome.
  Data from the cancer metabolism field indicates that products of intermediate metabolism
  serve as substrates for different chromatin modifier enzymes, including histone
  acetyltransferases (HAT), sirtuins, and histone and DNA methyltransferases. Excessive
  activation of the chromatin-modifying enzyme PARP1 has also been described in DKD.
  Ac-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; F-6-P, fructose 6-phosphate; G-3-P, glucose 3-phosphate;
  OGT, O-GlcNAc transferase; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
