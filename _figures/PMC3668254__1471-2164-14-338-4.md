caption: 'The top two scoring gene-networks (A and C) of dysregulated miRNAs and mRNAs,
  and associated biological functions (B and D) in response to 4 days administration
  of MMPi as determined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.A and C - Data are mean fold
  change represented graphically - green colouration denotes significant down-regulation
  whilst red colouration denotes significant up regulation (P < 0.05). Arrows between
  molecules denote a stimulatory effect and blocked arrows denote a suppressive effect.
  Note: Transcription factors Sp1, RelA, and STAT1 are included due to their association
  with gene changes involved in the development of MMPi induced fibrodysplasia. Network
  score = −log (Fishers Exact Test result); Molecule Count refers to the number of
  molecules included within the network for which expression data is available (miRNA
  or mRNA). B and D - Data are calculated P values (−Log) determined by the Fishers
  Exact Test for the most significant biological functions associated with the top
  two scoring gene networks. Significance was accepted were P < 0.05 (−Log P > 1.301)
  as shown by the threshold line in orange.'
