caption: (A) Pathway showing the order in which Arabidopsis BR biosynthetic CYPs function.
  Selaginella CYP90s are shown to the right. (B) Model comparing Arabidopsis (left)
  with Selaginella (right) signaling pathways. Abbreviations are given beneath . P
  indicates phosphorylation. Solid lines indicate established signaling routes, whereas
  broken lines show possible routes. Flat-tipped and pointed arrows indicate inhibitory
  and positive actions, respectively. Question marks indicate steps that remain to
  be characterized.
