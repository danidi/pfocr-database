caption: The latest FA/BRCA network. In response to an ICL, the FA/BRCA network responds
  by blocking the cell cycle through the ATR and ATM checkpoint kinases and their
  downstream target p53. Similarly, the FA core complex (FAcore) becomes activated
  and ubiquitinates FANCD2I complex, which in turn recruits DNA endonucleases (NUC1
  and NUC2). These endonucleases unhook the ICL generating a DNA adduct (ADD) and
  a double strand break (DSB). Translesion synythesis (TLS) takes over the ADD while
  the DSB can be rejoined either by FA/BRCA-dependent Homologous Recombination (FAHRR),
  FA/BRCA-independent Homologous Recombination (HRR2), or by the error prone Non-Homologous
  End-Joining (NHEJ) pathways. Finally, we predict that the CHKREC node, composed
  by the G2/M transcriptional program and checkpoint recovery proteins, turns off
  the checkpoint and DNA repair proteins. Rectangles represent proteins or protein
  complexes, pointed arrows are positive regulatory interactions, and dashed lines
  with blunt arrows are negative regulatory interactions. Readers may refer to []
  for a more detailed description of the FA/BRCA pathway
