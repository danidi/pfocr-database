caption: . Signalling pathway of ShhN. Processing and maturation of Shh precursor
  in signalling cell, assembly and transport of multimeric complexes of ShhN in the
  extracellular space, activation of the ShhN receiving cell through binding of ShhN
  to its receptor Patched; purple structures represent as yet poorly understood components
  of the ShhN multimeric complexes.
