caption: Central carbon metabolism. Glucose is taken up by glucose transporters (Glut)
  and then phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) to produce glucose-6-phosphate (G6P).
  G6P can be channeled by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) into the pentose
  phosphate pathway for nucleotide production. Alternatively, G6P can be converted
  to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
  (GAP), 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG), and 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) under catalysis
  of phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI), phosphofructokinase (PFK), aldolase (Aldo), glyceraldehyde
  dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and phosphoglycerokinase (PGK), respectively. 3PG is a precursor
  for de novo serine synthesis via 3-phosphopyruvate (3PPyr) and 3-phosphoserine (3PSer).
  Serine is converted to glycine to feed methionine and folate metabolism (one carbon
  metabolism). Serine/glycine biosynthesis is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
  (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH),
  and serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2). Alternatively, 3PG is converted into
  pyruvate (PYR) via 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with phosphoglyceromutase
  (PGM), enolase (Enol), and pyruvate kinase (PK) catalysis. Pyruvate is imported
  into mitochondria and either channeled to the tricarbonic acid (TCA) cycle via pyruvate
  dehydrogenase (PDH)-catalyzed formation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) or via pyruvate
  carboxylase (PC). Pyruvate can be also transformed into lactate through lactate
  dehydrogenase (LDH) and then be exported from a cell via monocarboxylate transporters
  (MCT). Glutamine can also serve as substrate for the TCA cycle. Glutaminolysis refers
  to the import of glutamine (Gln) and its conversion into glutamate (Glu) and α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG) through glutaminase (GLS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD). Within the TCA
  cycle, αKG is converted into succinyl-CoA (SucCoA), succinate (SUC), and fumarate
  (FUM) via α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (αKGDH), succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS),
  and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), respectively. Fumarate is converted into citrate
  (CIT) via malate (MAL) and oxaloacetate (OAA), and these reactions are accomplished
  by fumarase (FH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and citrate synthase (CS). Finally,
  citrate converted by aconitase (Aco) to isocytrate (ISO), and the latter is isomerized
  and then transformed into αKG with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH). Hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF1α) upregulates expression of Glut1, HK2, PK, and PDK3, thus enhancing
  glycolysis but preventing shuttling of pyruvate into the TCA cycle. Cytochrome P450
  2E1 (CYP2E1) activates a cascade (see the text for details) which leads to phosphorylation
  of alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) and concomitant increase in Glut4
  expression, thus also contributing to stimulated glycolysis. The Hedgehog (Hh)-YAP
  pathway upregulates expression of glutaminase 1 (GLS1). A TCA cycle intermediate
  succinate (also shown in red) may contribute to fibrogenesis by activating G protein-coupled
  receptor 91 (GPR91), also known as a succinate receptor.
