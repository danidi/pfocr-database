caption: Evolutionary conservation of upstream TOR signaling pathway in plants and
  animals. The main inputs upstream of TOR are depicted. TOR, Raptor and Lst8 form
  the core of the TORC1 complex and are conserved in all eukaryotes. Small GTPases
  represent the best described regulators of TOR kinase. See text for details and
  abbreviations.
