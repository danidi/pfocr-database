caption: JAK-STAT antiviral defense in the cardiac myocyte and SOCS inhibition to
  limit early virus-induced cardiac injury. (a) Virus infection of the heart stimulates
  cytokine-receptor signaling through the JAK-STAT pathway. Activation of the JAK-STAT
  pathway induces antiviral target gene transcription stimulating the innate viral
  defense in the cardiac myocyte. (b) While activation of the JAK-STAT pathway has
  an important role in antiviral defense, phosphorylated STAT also induces SOCS expression
  that attenuates the innate antiviral defense by inhibiting JAK signaling. As in
  SOCS1-transgenic mice, increased expression of SOCS in cardiac myocytes results
  in robust virus replication and cardiac injury. (c) The strategies aimed at inhibition
  of SOCS potentiate the innate antiviral actions of cytokines that utilize the JAK-STAT
  pathway, resulting in the prevention of virus-mediated myocardial injury. P, phosphorylated.
