caption: The effect of extracellular zinc on cellular calcium signaling. (Pathway
  A), Mechanism proposed by Hershfinkel et al. (). (Pathway B), Alternative pathway
  through control of protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases by zinc. Both pathways
  lead to phospholipase C activation, mobilization of intracellular calcium, and activation
  of the Na+/H+ exchanger. Zinc exporters and importers control the transport of zinc
  between the extracellular space and the cytoplasm.
