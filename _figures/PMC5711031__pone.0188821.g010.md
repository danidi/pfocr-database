caption: (A) A schematic view of the putative action of Jagged1and IL-1β in human
  myogenic cells. Jagged1 modulates the action of IL-1β in myogenic cells during chronic
  inflammation in DMD muscles. Then, the Jagged1/Notch3 signaling pathway attenuates
  the potential of dystrophic myogenic cells to proliferate and differentiate, whereas
  it is quenched in non-dystrophic myogenic cells. (B) Putative negative feedback
  effect of Jagged1 in dystrophic myogenic cells. Abundant/chronic exposure to IL-1β,
  probably derived from macrophages, induces myogenic cells to express IL-1β during
  repeated inflammation. The autocrine/paracrine IL-1β excessively stimulates myogenic
  cells, and then induces expression of Jagged1.
