caption: Model suggesting the mechanism through which oncogenic YAP expression permits
  cell proliferation and survival after radiation-induced DNA damage. YAP induces
  IGF2 expression in CGNPs and medulloblastoma cells. IGF2 activates the PI3K/Akt
  pathway, promoting survival and increasing proliferation of these cells. In addition,
  increased activation of Akt leads to faster ATM and Chk2 dephosphorylation after
  radiation, subsequently deactivating the DNA damage response and removing the G1/S
  and G2/M checkpoints. Favoring survival, proliferation and genomic instability confers
  an advantage to YAP-expressing tumor cells. Inhibiting IGF2/Akt signaling in tumors
  with high YAP expression may prevent recurrence and enable use of lower radiation
  doses by increasing tumor cell radiosensitivity.
