caption: Compartments of the secretory pathway. Transport steps are indicated by arrows.
  Secretory cargos are synthesized in the ribosome-studded ER, exit the ER at ERES
  in COPII-coated (brown) vesicles and are transported to the ER-Golgi compartment
  (ERGIC) and then to the Golgi. After passage through the Golgi complex in the cis-to-trans
  direction, cargos are packaged at the TGN for delivery to the PM, early and late
  endosomes and in some cells to secretory granules. Sorting into endosomal compartments
  and secretory granules is mediated by clathrin-coated (red) vesicles. Transport
  to the PM is mediated by transport tubules. A COPI-mediated (green) recycling pathway
  retrieves escaped proteins from the ERGIC and the Golgi and returns them to the
  ER. Multivesicular bodies form by invaginations of endosomal membrane into its lumen
  and can fuse with the PM to release their content of exosomal vesicles.
