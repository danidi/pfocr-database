caption: The role of cysteine synthase (CS) in cysteine biosynthesis in Escherichia
  coli. (A) The reductive sulfate assimilation pathway is composed of eight enzymes
  (in black, boxed) that catalyze the synthesis of L-cysteine starting from sulfate/thiosulfate.
  N-acetylserine (NAS) spontaneously forms from O-acetylserine (OAS) by an intramolecular
  O-to-N-acetyl shift. It binds to the transcriptional activator CysB and induces
  the expression of the cysteine operon. O-phosphoserine (OPS) is an alternative substrate
  of O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase isozyme B (CysM); (B) Sketch of the two alternative
  models that have been proposed for the quaternary arrangement of CS [], consistent
  with the observed stoichiometry. In the upper drawing, both active sites of the
  O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase isozyme A (CysK) dimer (yellow) are engaged by the
  C-terminal peptide of two subunits of the serine acetyltransferase (CysE) trimer
  (cyan). In the bottom drawing, only one active site of the dimer is involved in
  complex formation, while the second is unoccupied and available for catalysis.
