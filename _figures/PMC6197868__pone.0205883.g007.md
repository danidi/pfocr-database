caption: (A-B) Opacity indicates relative strength of the pathway module; greater
  opacity indicates a more active pathway. (A) Conversion of N-acetylserotonin (NAS)
  to melatonin in α-pinealocytes is enhanced by increased ASMT activity and increased
  S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) availability, which is increased by greater ATP availability.
  ATP availability is increased by elevated ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation
  (OxPhos), as inferred by greater expression of mitochondrial genes in α-pinealocytes.
  ATP availability is also increased by reduced consumption by protein synthesis,
  as inferred by decreased expression of ribosomal genes in α-pinealocytes. (B) β-Pinealocytes
  also undergo melatonin synthesis, but do not have the same production increasing
  enhancements as α-pinealocytes. (C) Melatonin (M) is synthesized in both pinealocyte
  subtypes from N-acetylserotonin (NAS). NAS that is not converted to melatonin in
  β-pinealocytes enters the α-pinealocyte by passive diffusion through membranes and
  gap junctions (shown in blue). NAS is subsequently converted to melatonin by the
  high efficiency Asmt system in the α-pinealocyte, thereby maximizing melatonin production.
