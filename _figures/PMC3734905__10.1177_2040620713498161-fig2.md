caption: 'Germline syndromes associated with the Ras signaling pathway.Schematic diagram
  showing the GM-CSF receptor spanning the phospholipid bilayer. After stimulation
  with a cytokine, the receptor propagates a signaling cascade through the Ras-MAPK,
  CBL, and JAK-STAT pathways. Neurofibromin, encoded by the gene NF1 is a negative
  regulator of the Ras pathway by binding to activated Ras and catalyzing GTP hydrolysis,
  thereby returning Ras to the inactive GDP-bound state. Overall, 1 in 10,000 individuals
  are affected with an inherited syndrome that is caused by a mutation in the Ras
  pathway []. Color coding indicates a specific association between a mutated gene
  and a syndrome that predisposes children to leukemia. Syndromes include: Noonan
  syndrome (OMIM 163950); NF1 (OMIM 162200), and CBL syndrome (OMIM 613563). Illustration
