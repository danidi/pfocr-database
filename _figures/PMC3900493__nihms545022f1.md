caption: Dendritic cells (DCs) require lymphotoxin-α1β2 (LTα1β2) that is provided
  by a currently undefined cell type. Endothelial cell selective adhesion molecule
  (ESAM)hi splenic DCs, which are essential for priming CD4+Tcells, require T signaling
  for their development,. In the gut, LTβR induces the maturation of inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (iNOS)+ DCs, which then induce the development of IgA producing plasmablasts.
  In both of these cases, further studies are required to define the cellular source
  of the LT. Additionally, in the lymph nodes, DCs have recently been shown to express
  LTα1β2 (REF. ), which is recognized by high endothelial venules (HEVs) and leads
  to their upregulation of adhesion molecules, such as glycosylation dependent cell
  adhesion molecule 1 (GLYCAM1), and is important for maintaining lymph node cellularity
  in the steady state. ILC, innate lymphoid cell.
