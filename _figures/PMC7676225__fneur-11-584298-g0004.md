caption: Anticonvulsant effect of K+ channel-mediated ketone body metabolism. Ketone
  body metabolism increases overall ATP but reduces glycolysis and glycolytic ATP
  synthesis. The reduction of ATP near the plasma membrane can disinhibit the KATP
  channels and therefore reduce electrical activity. High electrical activity (as
  in a seizure) increases Na+ input and ATP utilization near the plasma membrane.
  This produces negative changes in activity through the KATP channels. The set point
  at which this negative feedback safety mechanism is activated is determined by the
  level of glycolytic ATP synthesis.
