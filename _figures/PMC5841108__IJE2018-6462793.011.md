caption: 'Schematic representation of miR-34a regulating SIRT1/AMPKα signaling pathways
  and Egr1 involved in the HG-induced fibrosis and inflammation in RMCs. High glucose
  upregulates miR-34a and Egr1 expression, as well as decreases SIRT1 protein and
  AMPKα phosphorylation expression. miR-34a suppresses the activation of SIRT1/AMPKα
  and results in promoting Egr1-mediated inflammation and fibrosis in high glucose-cultured
  RMCs. AICAR activating AMPKα prevents Egr1 expression in high glucose. Meanwhile,
  metformin attenuates high glucose-stimulated inflammation and fibrosis in RMCs by
  regulating miR-34a-mediated SIRT1/AMPKα activity and the downstream Egr1 protein.
