caption: Related pathological processes might break the homeostasis of neural cells,
  leading to the progression of HSAN II. FAM134B obstructs the replication of DENV,
  ZIKV, and EBOV. Consequently, DENV and ZIKV cleave FAM134B to subvert ER-phagy.
  FAM134B acts as an oncogene in HCC and ESCC, but it plays a tumor suppressor role
  in CRC. In HCC, FAM134B activates the Akt signaling pathway, promoting cell proliferation
  and metastasis. In CRC, FAM134B is not only located in the cytoplasm but also in
  the nucleus. However, the role it plays in the nucleus is still unclear. FAM134B
  and TNFRSF19 show a strong synergy in vascular dementia. Their effect may be related
  to their roles in the Golgi apparatus. In AR, the expression of CD39 on Treg cells
  is negatively correlated with the expression of FAM134B on monocytes. The CD39 expressed
  by Treg cells can hydrolyze extracellular ATP to suppress asthmatic airway inflammation.
  However, ATP can increase the expression levels of FAM134B in CD4+ blood monocytes.
  Thus, ATP may be a link between CD39 and FAM134B in AR.
