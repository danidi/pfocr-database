caption: The roles of cGMP and S-nitrosylation in NO-based signaling (A) and enzymatic
  protein denitrosylation mediated by the S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) and
  thioredoxin (Trx) systems (B). (A) NO synthase (NOS) synthesizes NO, which may activate
  soluble guanylyl cyclase and thereby enhance production of cGMP (left) or subserve
  protein S-nitrosylation (right). The cGMP-dependent pathway is deactivated by cGMP-phosphodiesterase
  (PDE), which hydrolyzes cGMP to GMP (PDE may also be activated allosterically by
  cGMP). The SNO-based mechanisms are dynamically regulated via S-nitrosylation and
  denitrosylation of a multitude of cysteine-containing proteins. In contrast to the
  multiple elements regulated by S-nitrosylation, the cGMP-based signaling system
  relies primarily on the cGMP-dependent protein kinase, PKG. (B) Proteins undergo
  reversible S-nitrosylation and denitrosylation (center). Denitrosylation mediated
  by GSNOR is depicted on the left. Transnitrosylation of glutathione (GSH) by S-nitrosylated
  proteins generates GSNO and native protein. GSNO undergoes NADH-dependent reduction
  by GSNOR to generate glutathione S-hydroxysulfenamide (GSNHOH), which can undergo
  further reaction with GSH to generate oxidized glutathione (GSSG). The redox cycle
  is completed by reduction of GSSG to GSH via GSSG reductase. Denitrosylation mediated
  by the thioredoxin (Trx) system is depicted on the right. The active site dithiol
  motif (CXXC) of Trx1 (cytoplasmic) or Trx2 (mitochondrial) undergoes oxidation coupled
  to denitrosylation of SNO substrate. Oxidized Trx is reduced by the selenoprotein
  thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), which employs the reducing power of NADPH to regenerate
  active Trx.
