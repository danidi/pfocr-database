caption: The Ras, cAMP/PKA, and MSIL signaling pathways in C. neoformans. In C. neoformans,
  the Ras and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways appear to have limited interconnection in
  terms of their cellular functions. Most Ras-related phenotypes are mediated mainly
  through the Rac1- and Cdc24/Cdc42/Ste20 signaling cascades. Although the cAMP/PKA
  pathway responds to a variety of environmental cues, hardly any corresponding sensors
  are known, except for the Gpr4 GPCR that senses methionine for mating and capsule-inducing
  signals. Interestingly, both glucose starvation and glucose addition seem to activate
  the cAMP/PKA pathway, as laccase induction for melanin synthesis is triggered by
  glucose starvation in a cAMP/PKA-dependent manner, and a spike in cAMP levels is
  also observed when glucose is added to the glucose-starved cells. More kinases and
  transcription factors downstream of PKA remain to be discovered and characterized.
  Msl1 has roles as a subunit of the chromatin assembly factor (CAF-1) complex and
  as an adaptor/regulator of the cAMP/PKA (other hitherto unknown) signaling pathways
  for stress response, mating, and virulence factor regulation (e.g., melanin). Please
  refer to the text for more details on the regulatory mechanisms of the Ras, cAMP/PKA,
  and their related signaling pathways. Black arrows indicate positive regulation
  or activation, whereas red lines ending in circles indicate negative regulation
  or repression. Broken arrows or lines indicate potential but unclear regulation.
  Gray type indicates currently unidentified or uncharacterized.
