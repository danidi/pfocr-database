caption: PDK1 and the Salvador/Warts/Hippo (SWH) pathway. When epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR) signaling is active, PDK1 is recruited to the cell membrane and
  the core components of the HIPPO pathway are not forming a complex, thus YAP protein
  is in its inactive form and can insert the nucleus and act as a transcription factor
  for growth-promoting genes. On the opposite, in the absence of growth stimuli, a
  cytosolic complex is formed between the core proteins of the HIPPO pathway and PDK1,
  which phosphorylates YAP and renders it in the cytoplasm, excluding its nuclear
  entry.
