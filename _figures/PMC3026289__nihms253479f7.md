caption: (A) The transcriptional activator Met4 functions as a substrate recruitment
  component in the SCFMet30/Met4 ubiquitin ligase to regulate ubiquitylation and degradation
  of its own DNA-binding co-factors (DCFs).(B) During repression Met4 recruits its
  co-factors to SCFMet30 for ubiquitylation and degradation. Met4 itself is inactivated
  as a transcription factor by a regulatory ubiquitin chain. Co-factors not bound
  to Met4 are degraded by a second degradation pathway. Stress conditions lead to
  inactivation of SCFMet30 and result in selective formation of productive Met4 transcription
  factor complexes. This is achieved because inhibition of SCFMet30 prevents both
  Met4 polyubiquitylation and degradation of Met4-bound cofactors. Note that degradation
  of co-factors not bound to Met4 is constitutive.
