caption: 'STRING v10.0 protein–protein interaction network based on input of 164 proteins
  of interest. Enrichment data were generated using the iTRAQ-identified network of
  learning-induced changes in proteins differentially expressed in the hippocampus
  between NonTg and 3 × Tg-AD mice during learning and memory. The database maps input
  proteins to enrich known pathways based on the following active prediction method
  criteria: interactions in other existing public databases, experimental data, gene
  fusion, neighborhood proteins and text mining. Colored nodes indicate input proteins.
  Stronger association of protein–protein interaction is represented by thicker lines
  connecting protein nodes. Node size is indicative of amount of protein structure
  information. Proteins within this interaction network that comprise a network of
  strong interactions and significantly enrich the major RNA splicing pathway (P<0.001)
  are Hnrnpa0, Hnrnpf, Hnrnpul1, Srrm1 and Ptbp1. Also within this interaction network
  are input proteins significantly enriched to RNA translation initiation (P<0.01).
  These proteins, in part, consist of Eif3h, Eif4b, Rps9 and Rpl30.'
