caption: Fluxmap of the glycolysis, penthose phosphate pathway, and citric acid cycle
  for the experiment where nitrogen-limiting medium is changed to carbon-limiting
  medium at time zero. The ordinate on each graph represents the flux expressed in
  mol/mol Biomass/h while the abscissa represents time. The first point left of each
  figure is the steady state value before the medium switch. The last point right
  on each figure is the steady state value after at least 50 hours. Error bars represent
  the standard deviations.
