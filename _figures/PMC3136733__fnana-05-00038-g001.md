caption: Diagram summarizing the effects produced by L-DOPA and haloperidol on cAMP
  signaling in the striatal MSNs of the direct and indirect pathway. In PD, loss of
  dopamine in the striatum leads to increased responsiveness of D1Rs, expressed in
  the direct MSNs of the striatonigral pathway. Administration of L-DOPA increases
  the production of dopamine and activates D1Rs, which stimulate the cAMP/PKA pathway,
  thereby phosphorylating DARPP-32 (D32) at Thr34 (Picconi et al., ; Santini et al.,
  , ). A similar effect is produced by haloperidol in the indirect MSNs of the striatopallidal
  pathway via blockade of D2Rs and disinhibition of A2AR-mediated activation of cAMP
  signaling (Svenningsson et al., ). The activation of the PKA/DARPP-32 cascade produced
  by L-DOPA and haloperidol increases the phosphorylation of targets located in the
  cytoplasm/plasma membrane, such as the GluR1 subunit of the glutamate AMPA receptor
  (Håkansson et al., ; Santini et al., ). In direct MSNs, L-DOPA promotes ERK signaling.
  This effect may be exerted via PKA/DARPP-32-mediated regulation of Ras-GRF1 (Mattingly,
  ) and/or striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (Valjent et al., ), which
  are involved in the regulation of ERK phosphorylation. ERK-dependent activation
  of MSK1 results in phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 and enhanced expression
  of c-fos (Santini et al., ). Activation of ERK also increases the expression of
  zif268 and ΔfosB, which has been associated to LID (Andersson et al., ; Carta et
  al., ). Increased ΔFosB, in turn, leads to enhanced levels of dynorphin (Andersson
  et al., ). In the indirect striatopallidal MSNs, the regulation of histone H3 and
  gene expression exerted by haloperidol occurs independently of the ERK/MSK1 cascade.
  Thus, histone H3 is regulated via PKA-catalyzed phosphorylation and by concomitant
  suppression of dephosphorylation, via DARPP-32-mediated inhibition of PP-1 (Bertran-Gonzalez
  et al., ). In addition, the ability of haloperidol to activate PKA leads to increased
  phosphorylation of the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which may be
  involved in the control of Fos expression (Konradi and Heckers, ). The control of
  multiple signaling pathways exerted by L-DOPA and haloperidol in the MSNs of the
  direct and indirect pathway may ultimately modify the activity of these neuronal
  populations, leading to abnormal motor responses, including L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia
  and extrapyramidal side-effects. Broken lines indicate indirect effects. See text
  for abbreviations.
