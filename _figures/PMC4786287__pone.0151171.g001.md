caption: In the mitochondria, ACSF3 links malonate to CoA, producing malonyl-CoA.
  MCAT then transfers the malonyl moiety from malonyl-CoA onto ACP, resulting in malonyl-ACP.
  KAS performs the initial condensation reaction of the mtFASII pathway, condensing
  malonyl ACP with acetyl-CoA, acetyl-ACP, or acyl-ACP derived from previous mtFASII
  cycles. The initial condensation reaction produces 3-ketoacyl-ACP. KAR then reduces
  3-ketoacyl-ACP, producing 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP. HsHTD2 then dehydrates 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP
  to trans-2,3-enoyl-ACP. Finally, MECR reduces trans-2,3-enoyl-ACP to acyl-ACP. Octanoyl-ACP
  is shuttled into the lipoic acid synthesis pathway, but other uses of mtFASII products
  are unknown.
