caption: Diagram highlighting representative examples of Ixodes immune components
  that impact persistence of Lyme disease agents. During tick engorgement on a mammalian
  host, B. burgdorferi (Bb, white color) from an infected host dermis are acquired
  in ticks (Bb in tick gut indicated in blue color). Ixodes ticks can recognize the
  presence of pathogens in the incoming blood using multiple immune surveillance mechanisms,
  including an indirect cross-species signaling mechanism that involves sensing mammalian
  cytokines like IFNγ (indicated by green dots). Ingested cytokine in the tick initiate
  microbicidal responses involving a tick STAT, an immune GTPase (IGTPase) and an
  antimicrobial protein (AMP) like Dae2. In addition, a direct recognition mechanism,
  such as involving an atypical IMD pathway, is also operative in ticks that limits
  spirochete levels in the vector. The other classical components of innate immune
  cascades like Toll and JAK-STAT signaling pathways, which are although represented
  in Ixodes genome, their roles in direct recognition of B. burgdorferi in Ixodes
  ticks remain unknown. Additional factors in the gut, such as a feeding induced molecular
  barrier (di-tyrosine network) and the gut microbiome also impact the persistence
  of spirochetes. During a subsequent blood meal, Bb (red color) exit the tick gut
  and disseminate to salivary gland (SG) via hemocoel (H), which contains hemocytes
  that can also impact microbial survival in the vector.
