caption: Gene interaction network related to lipid metabolism of DEGs between WC and
  WRR chickens. (A) Functional gene interaction networks was identified by Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA®) software. This network shows direct gene interactions mainly
  in WRR.D120.B-VS-WC.D120.B related to lipid metabolism, molecular transport, small
  molecule biochemistry. (B) DEGs SLC27A1, LPL, CPT1A, CETP in WRR.D120.B-VS-WC.D120.B
  involved in PPAR signaling pathway. (C) Proposed network for SLC27A1 to regulate
  chicken lipid metabolism based on GO annotation, KEGG pathway and Ingenuity Pathway
  Analysis (IPA®). ① SLC27A1 overexpression increases fatty acids afflux, which offers
  ligands (Forman et al., ) for binding and activating PPARs; ② expression of FATP
  genes (SLC27A1) involves both PPARα and –γ (Motojima et al., ); ③ PPAR control triglyceride
  metabolism by transcriptional control the expression of LPL (Auwerx et al., ); ④
  Though binding to PPAR responsive element in CPT1A, PPAR promotes fatty acid oxidation
  (Mascaro et al., ; Song et al., ); ⑤ PPAR activation may inhibit plasma CETP activity
  (Li and Chiang, ); ⑥ PPARs and LXRs are involved in the regulation of ABCA1 expression
  (Chinetti et al., ). Genes colored in red are up-regulated expression in WC chickens,
  while genes colored in green are down-regulated expression in WC chickens. Color
  intensity correlates to the size of the fold change.
