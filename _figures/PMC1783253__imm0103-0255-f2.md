caption: The l-arginine–nitric oxide pathway. NO is synthesized from l-arginine and
  molecular oxygen by the NOS group of enzymes. In inflammation, cytokines such as
  IL-1 and TNF are upregulated. The cytokines induce expression of the inducible NOS
  (iNOS) gene, leading to synthesis of the iNOS enzyme, which produces nitric oxide
  (NO) from l-arginine. NO can also be produced by pharmacological NO donors such
  as SNAP. NO is a very reactive molecule and rapidly reacts with oxygen to form nitrite
  and nitrate.
