caption: JA-mediated cold and freezing stress responses in plants. Under control conditions,
  JAZ1 and JAZ4 interact with ICE1 and ICE2 to inhibit the ICE–CBF signaling pathway.
  Under low-temperature conditions, bioactive JA–Ile and ICE–CBF pathways are activated,
  and the expressions of cold-regulated genes are induced to improve plant cold tolerance.
  CBF, C repeat binding factor; ICE, INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION; Ile, isoleucine; JA,
  jasmonic acid; JAZ, JASMONATE ZIM DOMAIN PROTEIN.
