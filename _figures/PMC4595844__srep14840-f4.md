caption: Gene expression levels and changes were calculated (see ) for selected metabolism-related
  marker gene families associated to respiration (A) substrate consumption or byproduct
  production (B) and glycolysis and TCA cycle (C). Normalized gene expression levels
  (mRNA-RPKM/DNA-RPKM) for each Bin-genome under the three operational conditions
  is described by the size of circle, while gene expression dynamics (mRNA-RPKM/mRNA-RPKM)
  is described by the circle color of SP (expression fold-change from MFC to SP) and
  the circle color of OC (expression fold-change from SP to OC). Important gene sets
  for the metabolic pathway analyses within the community are indicated by yellow
  rectangles highlighting the circles. Bars indicate partial pathways of a given KEGG
  module or no existence of the KEGG orthology/module, and the elements of the incompleteness
  are described below the bar. Red rectangles indicate potential metabolism switches
  after stimuli addition.
