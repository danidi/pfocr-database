number: Figure 10.
caption: 'Schematic of putative NRG-erbB signaling in the cochlea. NRG expressed by
  SGNs activates erbB receptors in the supporting cells. erbB receptor signaling induces
  expression of neurotrophins (most likely NT3) by the supporting cells, which then
  induces the survival of the SGNs through their Trk receptors. An indirect pathway
  may also exist: e.g., supporting cells produce a factor that acts on hair cells,
  which then release neurotrophins.'
