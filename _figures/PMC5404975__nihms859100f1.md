caption: Overview of the core components of canonical Hippo signaling. Activation
  of MST1/2 kinases, which is facilitated by association with the scaffold SAV1, causes
  phosphorylation and activation of LATS1/2 kinases. Active LATS1/2 can scaffold with
  MOB1A and phosphorylate the transcription co-factors YAP/TAZ. This inhibitory phosphorylation
  promotes binding of YAP/TAZ to 14-3-3 proteins and cytosolic retention, thereby
  preventing the association of YAP/TAZ with the TEAD family of transcription factors
  and regulation of gene expression. Ischemia, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), and pressure
  overload have been shown to activate MST1 in the heart.
