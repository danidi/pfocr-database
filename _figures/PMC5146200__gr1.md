caption: 'Priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The canonical pathway
  of NLRP3 inflammasome activation is thought to require a two-step process. An initial
  priming step involves signaling through pattern recognition receptors such as TLR4
  and subsequent activation of NF-kB, which then drives transcription of NLRP3. Once
  NLRP3 mRNA/protein is increased to a critical threshold, the cell is considered
  primed, but pro-inflammatory cytokine output is not increased. Upon exposure to
  a second activating signal such as ATP, NLRP3 forms a complex with ASC. This complex
  recruits pro-caspase-1, which is then converted to mature caspase-1. Caspase-1 is
  the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of pro-IL-1β to mature IL-1β. Once formed,
  mature IL-1β is then released via an unconventional pathway independent of the Golgi
  apparatus. Abbreviations: HMGB-1 (high mobility group box-1); NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding
  domain and leucine-rich repeat containing family, pyrin domain containing 3); TLR4
  (Toll-like receptor 4); NF-κB (nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer
  in B-cells); ATP (adenosine triphosphate); P2X7R (purinergic receptor P2X, ligand
  gated ion channel, 7); ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a
  caspase recruitment domain); IL (interleukin).'
