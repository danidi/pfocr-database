caption: Three mechanisms for plastid retrograde signaling during stress.High light
  and drought stress can lead to the production of several metabolites within plastids
  that act as messengers to regulate nuclear gene expression. Singlet oxygen (1O2)
  production occurs in high light when excess electrons are transferred from chlorophyll
  (Chl) molecules in photosystem II (PSII) to molecular oxygen. This leads to the
  oxidation of β-carotene to produce β-cyclocitral, which can then regulate 1O2-responsive
  genes in the nucleus. Although its role is unknown, the plastid Executor1 (EXE1)
  protein is required for normal 1O2signaling []. High light or drought stress also
  leads to the accumulation of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) and methylerythritol
  cyclodiphosphate (MEcPP). PAP is able to travel through the cytoplasm to the nucleus
  where it interacts with 5′ to 3′ exoribonucleases (XRNs) to regulate stress responsive
  genes. SAL1 regulates PAP levels in the plastid by converting PAP to AMP. MEcPP
  is an intermediate of the plastid methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway and its
  accumulation during stress is specifically responsible for the regulation of nuclear
  stress genes. In bacteria, MEcPP destabilizes histone-like-DNA complexes, suggesting
  a possible model for gene regulation. Figure adapted from [,].
