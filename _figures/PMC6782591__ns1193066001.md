caption: MAP kinase signaling via Raf-1 and B-Raf. In the most well studied pathway
  for Raf-1 activation (left pathway), growth factor receptors, via the adapter protein
  Grb2, activate the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos and in turn the small
  GTP-binding protein, Ras; recruitment of Raf-1 to the plasma membrane by Ras leads
  to its activation. This pathway also is activated by Ca2+ influx in PC12 cells and
  cortical neurons (). PKC also activates this pathway, although it is unclear whether
  it activates Raf-1 directly or acts indirectly via Ras. Activation of this Raf-1-dependent
  pathway by either growth factor receptors or PKC is regulated negatively by PKA.
  One mechanism by which PKA exerts its effect is via phosphorylation of Ser43 in
  Raf-1, which impairs its interaction with Ras, preventing its activation. In addition,
  PKA directly inhibits Raf-1 activity by the phosphorylation of its catalytic domain.
  The cAMP cascade also can activate p42 MAPK and p44 MAPK in PC12 cells and other
  cell types, but it has been demonstrated that, even in these cells, its effect on
  Raf-1 is inhibitory. The capacity for the cyclic AMP cascade to stimulate MAP kinase
  activity (right pathway) correlates with the expression of a tissue-specific Raf
  isoform, B-Raf. B-Raf does not contain the Raf-1 Ser43 phosphorylation site, suggesting
  one reason why it may be resistant to inhibition by PKA. B-Raf expression, however,
  is not sufficient to confer the potential for PKA-stimulated p42 MAPK and p44 MAPK
  activation; the small GTP-binding protein, Rap-1, is required also. Rap-1 is a Ras
  homolog that, like Ras, can activate B-Raf. PKA phosphorylates Rap-1 at Ser179 and
  leads to its activation. Thus, in cells expressing Rap-1 and B-Raf, PKA leads to
  the activation of MEK and its substrate MAP kinases via a pathway independent of
  Ras and Raf-1.
