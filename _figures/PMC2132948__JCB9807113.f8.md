caption: Model for the potential role of the HOG and PKC-MPK pathways in regulating
  cell wall biosynthesis. The HOG pathway is required for Golgi localization of Mnn1-s,
  controls the distribution of Mnn1p between early and late Golgi compartments, and
  upregulates the activity of an exoglucanase, possibly in response to excess rigidity
  in the cell wall. Conversely, the PKC-MPK pathway is thought to sense a weakened
  cell wall and respond by upregulating the transcription of cell wall biosynthetic
  enzymes. See Discussion for additional details.
