caption: (a) RB1 pathway indicating genes with mutations in this series. Genes in
  green are activated by mutations, while genes in red are inactivated. (b) Hedgehog
  pathway with known cancer genes mutated in this series indicated. Genes in green
  are activated by mutations, while genes in red are inactivated.
