caption: A model about the effect of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) on the utilization
  of the main energy sources by activated CD4+ T-cells. In the immune response microenvironment,
  IDO1 by degrading l-tryptophan along the kynurenine pathway activates general control
  non-derepressible 2 kinase (GCN2K) and aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). By upregulating
  the transcription factor p53 and downregulating the transcription factor c-Myc,
  activated GCN2K decreases the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), key glycolytic
  enzymes, and glutaminases inhibiting the consumption of glucose and glutamine. The
  reduced utilization of these pivotal sources of energy by activated T-cells results
  in reduced ATP production. The latter activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK),
  which phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) resulting in
  decreased production of the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) inhibitor malonyl-CoA.
  In parallel, activation of AhR increases the expression of all CPT1 isoenzymes.
  Since CPT1 controls free fatty acid oxidation, these IDO-induced alterations promote
  free fatty acid oxidation as an alternative fuel for ATP production, supplying the
  required energy for CD4+ T-cell survival and proliferation.
