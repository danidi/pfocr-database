caption: 'Thiamin biosynthesis pathway in plants. Thiamin is synthesized from pyrimidine
  and a thiazole moiety, both of which are synthesized in the chloroplast. The detailed
  description of the pathway is presented in the text. Abbreviations of the substrates:
  5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), 4-amino-2-methyl-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine phosphate
  (HMP-P), adenylated thiazole intermediate (ADT), 4-methyl-5-b-hydroxyethylthiazole
  phosphate (HET-P), thiamin monophosphate (TMP), thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). Abbreviations
  of the enzymes: thiamin C synthase (THIC), -methyl-5-b-hydroxyethylthiazole phosphate
  (HET-P) synthase (THI1), thiamin monophosphate pyrophosphorylase (TH1), haloacid
  dehalogenase (HAD) family phosphatase (TH2), TPP kinases (TDPK).'
