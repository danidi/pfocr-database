caption: Scheme of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.Scheme of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
  (RAA) system with aliskiren and enalapril as well as their effects on the RAA system
  (arrows). Based on its route of action, aliskiren causes an increase in renin and
  a decrease in plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin I and II. By contrast,
  enalapril increases renin, PRA, and angiotensin I, but causes a drop in angiotensin-converting
  enzyme (ACE) activity and angiotensin II. Additionally, the neprilysin pathway is
  included because it is of interest in new drug entities for controlling blood pressure.
