caption: RhoA/ROCK I pathway and remodeling of microtubule network underlie the polarization
  and migration of HSPCs. (A) A migrating HSPC growing on MSC displays a polarized
  morphology with the formation of a uropod (U) at the rear pole and a leading edge
  (LE) at the front. Both types of plasma membrane protrusions contain a specific
  ganglioside-based membrane microdomain—the uropod being enriched in GM1 (red) whereas
  the leading edge in GM3 (green). In addition to prominin-1, a plethora of cell adhesion
  molecules (inset) including PSGL-1 are concentrated in the uropod whereas the chemokine
  receptor CXCR4 is found at the leading edge consistent with its sensory role towards
  an SDF-1α gradient. ERM proteins seem to be actively involved in the subcellular
  localization of some uropod-associated membrane proteins. Other molecules such as
  CD34 and CD45 are evenly distributed. The microtubule-organizing centre is found
  between the nucleus and the uropod. (B) The activity (↓) of RhoA and its downstream
  effector ROCK I contributes to the formation of the uropod, and hence polarization
  and migration of HSPCs. The downstream target(s) remain to be identified (?), but
  it might engage a protein involved in microtubule destabilization (dashed green
  line). (C) Inhibition (⊥) of ROCKs using Y-27632 or the specific knockdown of ROCK
  I or its upstream regulator RhoA by means of RNAi results in an elongated morphology
  where the uropod is lost. Both membrane (prominin-1, PSGL-1) and cytoplasmic (ezrin)
  proteins are redistributed. These cells display an impairment of migration caused
  by microtubule stability (solid green line). (D) In RhoA/ROCKI-deficient HSPCs,
  the addition (+) of nocodazole restores their proper polarization and migration
  highlighting the implication of unidentified microtubule-destabilizing proteins.
  Green and red arrows indicate the direction of migration.
