caption: 'Rings of data depict different measurements about genes or proteins as higher
  activity (red) or lower activity (blue) compared to normal controls. Pathway illustrates
  part of the HotLink solution inferred from the TCGA basal and luminal breast tumors
  with various data available through TCGA including (inner to outer): pathway levels
  inferred by PARADIGM, Copy number alterations, RNA-Seq RSEM levels, and RPPA data.
  The outermost ring depicts the patient subtypes. Segments display aggregated levels
  for samples within each grouping defined by the breast cancer subtype (indicated
  in the outermost ring).'
