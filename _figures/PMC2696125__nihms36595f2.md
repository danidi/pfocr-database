caption: Neurotrophins are depicted to induce NPD1 synthesis and its apical release
  []. Oxidative stress or A2E (N-retinyl-N-retinylidene ethanolamine)/A2E oxiranes
  (epoxides) are activators of neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) synthesis as well (in purple).
  Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is shown to arrive to the RPE as part of the phagosome
  (DHA-phospholipids). After phagolysosomal digestion, most of the DHA is recycled
  back to the inner segments of photoreceptors through the interphotoreceptor matrix
  (red arrows). The precise phospholipid-DHA molecular species that is hydrolyzed
  to generate the free DHA pool precursor of NPD1 has not been identified (NPD1 synthesis
  pathway, blue color). NPD1 is released through the apical cellular side and recognizes
  a putative receptor. Intracellular signaling then inhibits pro-inflammatory gene
  expression. As a consequence, a decrease in proinflammatory proteins takes place
  that, when available, plays a role in choroidal neovascularization and cell injury.
  In addition, NPD1-triggered signaling upregulates antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein
  expression and downregulates pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein expression. As a
  result, caspase 3 activity is decreased and apoptosis reduced.
