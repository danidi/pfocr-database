caption: A sketch map was drawn to show how the miR-30c-5p/COTL1 pathway regulating
  breast cancer cell metastasis. Important molecules and structures are indicated.
  In normal breast cells, miR-30c-5p inhibited COTL1 expression and kept cell migration
  to a normal level. When miR-30c-5p was downregulated, COTL1 expression was up regulated,
  and cell migration was enhanced.
