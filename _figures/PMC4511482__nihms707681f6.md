caption: Hypothetical models of insulin-like and DA pathways in the control of diapause,
  longevity, and gonadal migration. A. HSD-1 and DAF-36 act in canonical DA biosynthetic
  pathways to promote reproductive development. B. HSD-1 does not participate in lifespan
  control by the germline pathway but promotes lifespan extension in animals with
  reduced insulin-like signaling. C. Regulation of gonadal migration does not require
  HSD-1.
