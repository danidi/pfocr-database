caption: 'Consequences of STING over-activation on antigen presenting cells and T
  cells following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2) infection.
  In antigen presenting cells (left), due to poor virus control by RNA sensors (including
  RIG-1, and MDA5) and despite the help of STING (red hexagon), SARS-CoV-2 induces
  delayed cell damages, with mitochondrial DNA and dsDNA release. It can add to damaged
  self-DNA secondary to ageing and/or obesity/diabetes. cGAS catalyzes those self-DNA
  in cyclic nucleotides, mainly cGAMP, which in turn activates STING (red hexagon).
  This activation of STING may be enhanced by: i) a lack of miRNAs, (like miR-576-3p,
  which normally suppress STING translation); ii) excess of IFIT3, which interacts
  with STING gene to promote its expression. Binding of cGAMP to STING first induces
  activation of the STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway, leading to IFN-I synthesis. In COVID-19,
  the SARS-CoV-2 NSP 3 and 16 lower this IFN secretion, but IFN enhances expression
  of ACE2 on cell membrane. cGAMP, which can be released to by-stander cells through
  viral exosomes, can also be transmitted by B cells (low), to activated T cells (right),
  through specific channels. Independently of the STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway, binding
  of cGAMP to STING can also: i) induce pyroptosis; ii) promote autophagy and lymphopenia;
  iii) activate NF-κB and both TNF and IL-6 synthesis. SARS-CoV-2 NSP 9 and 10 still
  enhances IL-6 release through inhibition of NKRF. Some beta-coronaviruses can also
  impede ULK1 and its negative feed-back loop, further enhancing IL-6 secretion. Excess
  of cGAMP can be internalized by by-stander activated CD4+ and CD8+T cells, which
  highly express the cGAMP importer SLC19A1. Therefore, even without infection of
  T lymphocytes, STING activation could also occur in activated T lymphocytes, especially
  those already stressed by a continuous activation by their hyper-responsive TCR.
  Defective retro-control of STING (dashed red loop) by IL-6 (see above) could still
  enhance STING activation in severe COVID-19. In activated T cells, STING overactivation
  leads to autophagy, up to lymphocyte death. This contributes much to the lymphopenia
  observed in rodent and human gain of function of STING models, and perhaps also
  in COVID-19, with subsequent poor virus control.'
