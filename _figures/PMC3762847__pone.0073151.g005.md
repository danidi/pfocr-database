caption: 'Butyrate hyperinduces WNT/beta-catenin activity in CC cells with mutations
  in the pathway by increasing the formation of beta-catenin/TCF4 (BCT) complexes
  , . High levels of BCT complexes induce directly pro-apoptotic genes such as BAX
  and BOK . However, due to signaling heterogeneity, only a fraction of all cells
  hyperactivates the pathway and undergo apoptosis within 24 hours of exposure to
  butyrate . Similar to cells undergoing compensatory proliferation , , apoptotic
  CC cell populations increase the expression of TGFbeta, WNT5A, and WNT11 , , and
  these molecules activate pro-survival pathways, such as JNK and AKT signaling ,
  (Figs. 1,2). JNKs activate cJUN and JAK/STAT signaling , . Inhibition of JNK augments
  apoptosis induced by butyrate/propolis treatment (Fig. 2C), as does the inhibition
  of its downstream target, the JAK/STAT pathway (Fig. 4). The role of pcJUN in the
  apoptotic response of CC cells to butyrate/propolis exposure is complex: at relatively
  lower levels, cJUN may contribute to proliferation; whereas, when hyperinduced together
  with beta-catenin/TCF complexes it may induce apoptosis. Asterisks mark the pathways
  inhibited by propolis.'
