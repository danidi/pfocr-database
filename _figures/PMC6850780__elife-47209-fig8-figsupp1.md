caption: DA neurons and the involvement of EVs and Sig1R-ARF6 signaling pathway. As
  shown previously (), cocaine stimulates the synthesis of 2-AG via promotion of the
  activation of α1-noradrenergic receptors following inhibition of the norepinephrine
  transporter (NET). 2-AG synthesis is also facilitated by activation of type-1 metabotropic
  glutamate receptors (mGluR1) activated by endogenous glutamate released during electrical
  stimulation of VTA tissue (). These Gq11-coupled GPCRs activate phospholipase-Cβ
  (PLCβ) to form diacylglycerol (DAG) from membrane phospholipids. DAG is then converted
  to 2-AG via the enzyme diacylglycerol lipase-α (DGLα) and then packaged into EVs.
  Cocaine also activates the Sig-1R, causing dissociation of a Sig-1R-ARF6-GDP complex
  at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in mouse VTA DA neurons. This free ARF6 is activated
  by a SecinH3-sensitive GEF, and then translocated to the plasma membrane where it
  interacts with myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). MLCK then interacts with cytoskeletal
  elements to evoke fusion of the 2-AG containing-EVs with the plasma membrane and
  permit 2-AG release into extracellular space. This 2-AG then activates CB1Rs located
  on GABA axon terminals to inhibit GABA release onto postsynaptic GABAB receptors
  leading to 2-AG-mediated disinhibition of DA neurons.
