caption: Human SHH-PTCH-GLI pathway (left) and its links to human diseases (right).
  The association of the human disease with malfunction of a given element in the
  pathway is indicated by the matching colors of the boxes. The placement of the elements
  of the pathway, as well as their role as a repressor (bars) or as an activator (arrows),
  has been demonstrated in humans. The exceptions are that interaction between human
  GLI3 and CBP was demonstrated using mouse CBP (Dai et al. ), human GLI genes were
  tested in frog and mouse cells (Ruiz i Altaba ; Dai et al. ), and mouse gli2 protein
  function is shown for completeness, although human GLI2 has not been fully characterized
  (Tanimura et al. ; Sasaki et al. ).
