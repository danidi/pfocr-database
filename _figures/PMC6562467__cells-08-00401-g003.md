caption: Mitochondrial morphology alterations and metabolic reprogramming. Mitochondrial
  morphology transitions (from elongated to fragmented, and vice versa) are linked
  to breast cancer metabolism. In fact, breast cancer cells alter mitochondrial dynamics
  to adjust their bioenergetics and biosynthetic needs in order to survive in harsh
  conditions and support tumour progression. In high-nutrient conditions, mitochondria
  are fragmented and dysfunctional, and energy demand is mainly supported by glycolysis.
  Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) upregulation in breast cancer cells is associated
  with fission, glycolysis, and mitophagy. The reduction of mitochondrial number due
  to mitophagy is restored by an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. The fission
  mechanism is also induced in breast cancer by the loss of the tumour suppressor
  gene, SH3LG2. When overexpressed, endophilin-A1 encoded by the SH3LG2 gene translocates
  to mitochondria, interacts with PGC-1α and Mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and triggers the
  mitochondrial fusion network and OXPHOS. Moreover, the mitochondrial translocation
  of SH3GL2 triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway through the induction of O2−
  production and cytochrome C (CYTC) release. Conversely, in low nutrient conditions,
  breast cancer cells maintain their mitochondria in a hyperfused state by inhibiting
  the mitochondrial fission protein DRP1 and favouring energy production through OXPHOS.
  The blue arrows indicate activated pathways, whereas red arrows depict inhibited
  pathways in the breast cancer cell.
