caption: 'Simplified scheme highlighting glycolysis as a biosynthetic hub. Enzymes
  are represented in italicized blue font and their substrates in bold black. Tumor
  cell proliferation relies on aerobic glycolysis for ATP production and also to redirect
  carbohydrates toward biosynthetic routes. When allosterically activated by fructose-1,6-
  bisphosphate (F1,6BP), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) promotes pyruvate (and ATP) synthesis.
  Pyruvate fuels either the production of lactate (for NAD+ production further supporting
  glycolytic ATP production), alanine [through the reversible alanine aminotransferase
  (ALAT) reaction during which a nitrogen group is transferred from glutamate onto
  pyruvate to yield alanine], and/or it can be used to replenish the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle. The fate of pyruvate is oriented by the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase 1 (PDK1) repressing pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) in the mitochondrion. When
  PKM2 is off (for example when accumulating alanine allosterically promotes dimer
  formation), glucose-6-P is directed toward the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to
  yield ribulose-5P (for DNA synthesis) and NADPH (2 molecules per molecule of G6P).
  In addition to glucose, glutamine is an important source of organic acids for proliferating
  cells. Glutamine uptake is mediated by glutamine transporters (GLT) and glutaminases
  present in the cytosol or in the mitochondrion generate glutamate. Glutamate fuels
  the TCA cycle and is also a nitrogen donor for alanine synthesis (ALAT reaction).
  Uncoupled mitochondria are major providers of biosynthetic precursors and produce
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). During cataplerosis, citrate, and isocitrate are
  exported to fuel lipogenesis, malate is exported and converted into pyruvate for
  NADPH production by the malic enzyme (ME), and glutamate may serve to regenerate
  glutamine as a precursor for amino-acid synthesis or to be exchanged against extracellular
  amino-acids. NADPH, produced either from the PPP or from malate, has two main roles:
  it is a necessary cofactor for lipogenesis (HMG-CoA reductase step) and it is used
  as a reductant for the regeneration of glutathione (GSH) from its oxidized disulfide
  form (GSSG). As an anti-oxidant, GSH detoxifies ROS. Other abbreviations: GLUT,
  glucose transporter; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; MCT, monocarboxylate transporter.'
