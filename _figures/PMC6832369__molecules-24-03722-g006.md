number: Figure 6
caption: 'Comparison of overall expression profiles across all samples. (A) Results
  of the principal component analyses (PCA) of gene expressions in DETA/NO and vehicle-treated
  cancer cells are shown. Each color represents one cell line (both vehicle-treated
  control and DETA/NO-treated samples were the same color). Blue: AN3CA, Turquoise:
  KLE, Magenta: Ishikawa, Green: HEC-1B. The PCA plot shows each DETA/NO-treated cell
  line forms its own cluster and is clearly separated from its matching control sample
  clusters. (B) Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). The top and common canonical networks
  identified among fours cell lines (AN3CA, KLE, Ishikawa, and HEC-1B). The pink color
  indicates upregulation and a light green color indicates downregulation of that
  particular gene.'
