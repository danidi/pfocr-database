caption: The potential mechanism underlying the role of PDE4 inhibitors in neuroplasticity
  after stroke. Under the condition of ischemic stroke, the expression and activity
  of PDE4 are extensively increased in neural cells, which subsequently lead to decreased
  level of cAMP and the inhibition of PKA/CREB and Epac/ERK1/2 signaling pathways.
  cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway plays a critical role in promoting the expression of BDNF,
  which is a potent factor triggering neuroplasticity. Activation of Epac/ERK1/2 and
  cAMP/PKA/CREB pathways inhibits the expression of pro-inflammtory factors, such
  as IL-1β, which are viewed as negative factors delaying the process of neuroplasticity,
  especially at the early stage of stroke. PDE4 inhibition is supposed to enhance
  neuroplasticity through increasing the levels of cAMP and BDNF, and decreasing the
  expression of pro-inflammatory factors.
