caption: Schematic presentation of the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in the host cell and
  proposed sites of famotidine action. The attachment and entry of the virus into
  the host cell (➊) require the interaction of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
  with the viral S glycoprotein, which is processed by the cellular transmembrane
  protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Following viral fusion with the target cell cytoplasmic
  membrane, the positive-sense single-stranded genomic RNA [(+)gRNA] of the virus
  is released into the host cytoplasm (➋) and the open reading frames (ORF) 1a and
  1b are translated into the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab (➌). These are cleaved by
  the viral papain-like (PLpro) and 3C-like (3CLpro) proteases to generate 16 non-structural
  proteins (nsps), including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), a core constituent
  of the replication–transcription complex (RTC) (➍). During replication (➎), the
  negative-sense genomic RNA [(−)gRNA] serves as template for the (+)gRNA, whereas
  the nested subgenomic RNAs [(+)sgRNA] produced by fragmented transcription through
  negative-strand intermediates [(−)sgRNA] (➎) are translated into the SARS-CoV-2
  structural (➏) and accessory proteins. The nucleocapsids assembled from gRNA encapsidated
  by N protein and the structural proteins S, E and M inserted in the endoplasmic
  reticulum move along the secretory pathway (➐) and form mature virions that are
  transported to the cell surface in vesicles (➑) and released from the infected cell
  by exocytosis (➒) [, , ]. Bold arrows indicate the sites of action of the histamine
  H2 receptor antagonist famotidine as proposed by computational studies [, , ], yet
  not experimentally confirmed [, ]
