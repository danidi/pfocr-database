caption: The main fixation pathway is the reductive citric acid (rTCA) cycle, from
  which most anabolic pathways are initiated. Reductive folate chemistry is a secondary
  fixation pathway from which an additional small set of anabolic pathways is initiated
  (R = aminobenzoate-derived side chain). Whether formate attachment occurs at the  or  position
  of THF remains to be elucidated (see text). Relative to the reconstructed root of
  carbon-fixation, in which the rTCA cycle and Wood-Ljungdahl pathway are fully integrated
  , this hybrid strategy employed by A. aeolicus lacks only the grey-dashed reaction
  (acetyl-CoA synthesis). Molecules highlighted in blue represent the “pillars of
  anabolism”, TCA intermediates from which the vast majority of anabolic pathways
  have been initiated throughout evolution . Highlighted in green is succinyl-CoA,
  which forms a precursor to pyrroles through a later derived pathway in some organisms
  (but not A. aeolicus). Highlighted in red are reaction sequences involving the same
  local functional group transformation that in A. aeolicus are catalyzed by closely
  related enzymes in both halves of the rTCA cycle. Green dashed arrows highlight
  alternate pathway sequences catalyzed by a single enzyme in other clades.
