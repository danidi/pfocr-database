caption: T cell activation in the tumor milieu. a Programmed cell death protein 1
  (PD1) receptor is an inhibitory receptor expressed by antigen-stimulated T cells.
  Interactions between PD1 and its ligand, PD-L1, expressed in many tumors activate
  signaling pathways that inhibit T-cell activity and thus block the antitumor immune
  response. b Antibodies targeting PD1 or PD-L1 block the PD1 pathway and reactivate
  T cell activity. MCH, Major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T cell receptor. (Adapted
