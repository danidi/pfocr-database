caption: 'Three Wnt-dependent pathways have been categorized: canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  and non-canonical Wnt/PCP as well as Wnt/Ca2+ pathways. Canonical Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway: In cells, with an inactive state of canonical Wnt signaling, cytosolic
  β-catenin is targeted to proteolytic degradation through phosphorylation by the
  APC–Axin–GSK3β complex and further ubiquitination through action of βTrCP-dependent
  E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. On stimulation by Wnt ligands through binding to Fzd
  receptors and its co-receptor Lrp, Fzd recruits and phosphorates Dsh, and inhibits
  APC–Axin–GSK3β complex formation by the recruitment and inhibition of GSK3β. Consequently,
  β-catenin can accumulate in the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus, activating transcription
  of target genes through association with the Lef1/Tcf transcription factor family.
  Non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+pathway: Interaction of Wnt ligands with Fzd receptors can
  lead to an increase in intracellular calcium level, through possibly the activation
  of phospholipase C (PLC). Intracellular calcium will subsequently activate Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II (CAMKII) and protein kinase C (PKC) in cells, as well as the transcription
  factor NFAT. This pathway is particularly important for convergent-extension movements
  during gastrulation. Additionally, Fzd receptors can also activate JNK, promoting
  expression of specific genes through activation of AP-1. Non-canonical Wnt/PCP pathway:
  This pathway is characterized by an asymmetric distribution of Fzd and related receptors,
  resulting in the polarization of the cell. Also, Wnt-signaling activates Cdc42,
  RhoA, and Rac1 leading to cytoskeleton rearrangement. Rac1 can also activate JNK,
  activating specific gene transcription through modulation of the AP-1 protein complex.'
