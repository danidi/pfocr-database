caption: Cell type-specific temporal dynamics of R-Smad phosphoisoforms. Although
  linker phosphorylation is transient after mitogen treatment of normal epithelial
  cells (A), mitogen-inducible phosphorylation generally persists in various mesenchymal
  cells (B). Moreover, constitutive linker phosphorylation is found in almost all
  types of carcinomas and Ras-transformed cells (C). Because mitogenic pSmad3L signaling
  is followed by the cytostatic pSmad3C signaling in normal epithelial homeostasis,
  pSmad2L/C and pSmad3L/C rarely exist in normal epithelial cells (A). Resembling
  observations in mesenchymal cells (B), carcinomas acquire an invasive phenotype
  via the pSmad2L/C pathway created by a combination of TGF-β signal with intracellular
  Ras signal (C).
