caption: Activation of inflammatory mediators in pancreatic β-cells in type 1 diabetes.
  Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are the most likely
  cytokines acting in synergy during inflammation of pancreatic β-cells, leading to
  the activation of a final common pathway, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and,
  ultimately, to β-cell destruction. NF-κB can be activated by a variety of stimuli,
  including TNF-α, IL-1, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs). IL-1β is an inflammatory cytokine that plays a major
  role in immune-mediated β-cell destruction. Interestingly, in patients with type
  2 diabetes, the IL-1 pathway blockade with an IL-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra)
  improved glycemic control and β-cell secretory function and resulted in a significant
  reduction marker of systemic inflammation, namely, C-reactive protein and IL-6 ().
  A recent clinical study indicated that the blockade of the IL-1β pathway in type
  1 diabetes resulted in the reduced ability of mononuclear cells to traffic to sites
  of inflammation (). The latter observations provide evidence for a possible mechanistic
  link between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and additional studies are necessary to
  unravel the common inflammatory pathways involved in the pathologic etiology of
  these two diseases. Compelling evidence indicates that cytokines influence the expression
  of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) leading to NO production. IL-1β and IFNγ, by NO
  synthesis, were reported to markedly decrease sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+
  ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) protein expression, deplete Ca2+ stores, and activate ER stress
  pathway, which is a potential contributing mechanism to β-cell death. Furthermore,
  cytokine-induced (IL-1β + IFN-γ) apoptosis of INS-1 cells appears to depend on NO
  production, as demonstrated by the use of the NO dioxygenase blocker NG-methyl-l-arginine.
  NO also contributes to cytokine-induced apoptosis through potentiation of Jun NH2-terminal
  kinase (JNK) activity and suppression of Akt/protein kinase B. Although whether
  oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes is still
  being discussed, a reduced antioxidant capacity has been demonstrated in patients
  with type 1 diabetes compared with healthy control subjects. To summarize the cytokine
  signaling, TNF-α signals through trimerized p60 receptors that interact with the
  TNF receptor type 1–associated death domain protein (TRADD). Fas-associated protein
  with death domain (FADD) is then recruited by TRADD, thus allowing binding of receptor-interacting
  protein (RIP) and TNF receptor–associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to the receptor complex.
  TRAF2 activates NF-κB through NF-κB–inducing kinase (NIK)–inhibitor of κB kinase
  (IKK) and activates the JNK/p38 pathways. TNF-α is an inflammatory cytokine that
  appears to be associated with a number of autoimmune disorders, including type 1
  diabetes. TNF-α may activate intraislet resident macrophages, resulting in the release
  of IL-1β, which generates iNOS expression and the overproduction of NO in β-cells.
  Alterations in the number and function of CD4+CD25+ T-cells may be an additional
  mechanism by which TNF-α may cause type 1 diabetes in NOD mice. The role of RAGE
  mediated by NF-κB has not been entirely elucidated, although RAGE may be an important
  intermediary in causing monocyte production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α.
  It is possible that increased expression of RAGE in response to hyperglycemia may
  lead to activation of innate and even adaptive immune responses and enhance β-cell
  destruction. After IL-1β binding to IL-1βR1, MyD88 is recruited to the receptor
  complex. MyD88 interacts with IL-1 receptor–associated kinase (IRAK), allowing the
  binding of TRAF6 to IRAK. TRAF6 causes activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/stress-activated
  protein kinase and activation of the NF-κB pathway by transforming growth factor-β–activated
  kinase 1 (TAK1)–mediated activation of IKK. IL-1β also stimulates activation of
  protein kinase C-δ (PKC-δ), possibly through phospholipase C generation of diacylglycerol.
