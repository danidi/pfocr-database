caption: Schematic representation of the signalling profiles of different β2‐adrenoceptor
  ligands. The figures show the relative signalling profiles of different β2‐adrenoceptor
  ligands based on several in vitro studies. The endogenous ligand adrenaline is assigned
  by convention as unbiased and is a full agonist (solid arrows) at both the cAMP
  and ERK1/2 activation pathways. Alprenolol is a partial agonist (dotted arrows)
  at both signalling pathways in comparison with adrenaline, carvedilol and propranolol
  are both inverse agonists (solid T‐line) at the cAMP accumulation pathway but partial
  agonists at the ERK1/2 activation pathway (dotted arrows). ‘a’ and ‘b’ indicate
  that carvedilol and propranolol activate ERK1/2 through different signalling cascades.
  Carvedilol activates ERK1/2 via an arrestin‐dependent pathway, while propranolol‐mediated
  ERK1/2 activation is arrestin independent. Nadolol is an inverse agonist at the
  cAMP accumulation pathway and an antagonist at the ERK1/2 activation pathway (Galandrin
  and Bouvier, ; Wisler et al., ; van der Westhuizen et al., ).
