caption: Microglial-mediated disruption of chloride homeostasis in spinal lamina I
  neurons gates morphine hyperalgesia. In response to chronic morphine treatment,
  microglia residing in the spinal cord adopt a reactive state characterized by μ
  receptor-dependent upregulation of P2X4R expression. Activation of P2X4R causes
  the release of BDNF, which signals to downregulate the potassium-chloride cotransport
  KCC2, resulting in a dysregulation of chloride homeostasis in spinal lamina I pain
  signaling neurons. The P2X4R–BDNF–KCC2 pathway is not only critical for the paradoxical
  hyperalgesic effect of morphine but also for pain hypersensitivity after peripheral
  nerve injury.
