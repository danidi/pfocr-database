caption: 'PPARγ ligand treatments increase expression of mitochondria-associated metabolic
  pathways in adipose tissue. Selected genes upregulated in ligand-treated adipose
  tissue are shown for the oxidative phosphorylation (A) and TCA cycle and BCAA degradation
  metabolic pathways (B). Red ovals, genes upregulated in PPARγ ligand-treated vs.
  FC groups. Unfilled ovals, no gene expression difference comparing ligand-treated
  and FC groups. Yellow-outlined ovals, genes exhibiting ligand-selective expression
  patterns (ANOVA, P < 0.05). Figures adapted from KEGG. C: examples of BCAA degradation
  pathway genes exhibiting ligand-selective expression that perfectly correlates with
  ligand treatment potency (Spearman, ρ = 1). Data are averages normalized to LC group
  ± SE. ANOVA P < 0.05 for each. *αbonf < 0.05 vs. FC group.'
