caption: Ion homeostasis. Ca2+ homeostasis is regulated by several transporters. Ca2+
  influx is primarily mediated by voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs), transient receptor
  potential channels (TRPs) and ligand-gated channels. Ca2+ efflux is achieved by
  plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPases (PMCAs), sodium calcium exchangers (NCXs) or Na+/NCKX.
  Release of Ca2+ from the ER/SR is mediated through IP3 or ryanodine receptors. Store-operated
  channels are activated by stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) protein that senses
  the store depletion and triggers the opening of the Ca2+-release-activated Ca2+
  channels and calcium release-activated calcium modulators. Store-operated channels
  entry (SOCE) is also modulated by K+-permeable channels, KCa and Kv, which are regulated
  by intracellular Ca2+ and depolarization, respectively. These two channels help
  sustain SOCE generation by inducing cell hyperpolarization. Additionally, the Na+-permeable
  channel transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member (TRPM) is
  gated by intracellular Ca2+ and reduces Ca2+ mobilization. The reuptake of Ca2+
  into the ER/SR is primarily mediated by sarcoplasmic/ER Ca2+ ATPase. Pathway objects
  and links are described separately in .
