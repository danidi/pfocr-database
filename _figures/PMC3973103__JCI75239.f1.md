caption: The complex milieu of primary colorectal cancer is mainly characterized by
  the presence of tumor epithelial cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), vasculature,
  and cells of the immune system that interact and support each other in promoting
  tumor growth and local invasion. The inflammatory microenvironment, through its
  major mediator IL-6, triggers the activation of the IL-6R–mediated IL-6/STAT3 pathway,
  which represses the expression of miR-34a, thus inhibiting the miR-34a–mediated
  suppression of SNAIL. Therefore, the activation of the loop by IL-6–induced EMT,
  through its downstream effector SNAIL, shifts the cellular phenotype toward a mesenchymal
  state that is advantageous for the invasion, intravasation, and extravasation steps
  of the metastatic cascade. Conversely, the inactivation of this loop at the site
  of the metastatic colonization (i.e., lungs) aids in switching back to an epithelial
  state, namely MET, allowing for the outgrowth of metastatic nodules.
