caption: (A) Nivolumab is a PD-1 receptor blocking antibody, which disrupts the inhibitory
  PD-1 signaling pathway and restores T cell mediated antitumor immunosurveillance.
  (B) Brentuximab vedotin is an anti-CD30 antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin
  E (MMAE). On binding to CD30, the antibody–drug conjugate is internalized, the linker
  protein attaching the drug is cleaved by cell proteases, and MMAE is released, leading
  to microtubule disruption and apoptosis.
