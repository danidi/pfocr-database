caption: 'The role of MSCs in regulating the IL-10 producing regulatory B cells. MSCs
  perform functions on modulating IL-10 producing regulatory B cells via many manners,
  including (1) Cell-to-cell contact: MSCs play roles in B cells via PD1-PDL1 pathway
  to inhibit antigen-dependent proliferation and differentiation, and induce Bregs.
  (2) Soluble factors: IL-10-producing Breg subsets, including CD5+ Bregs, CD24highCD38high
  Bregs, CD1d+CD5+ Bregs, and CD23+CD43+ Bregs, are mediated by MSCs-secreting soluble
  factors. (3) Extracellular Vesicles: MSCs-EVs could inhibit B cell proliferation
  and BCR-mediated Ca2+ mobilization, regulate PI3K-AKT signaling pathway in B cells
  that is critical for Breg cell development, and induce CD24highCD38high B cell subpopulation,
  a classic phenotype of Bregs, but without IL-10 production. Based on the current
  data, MSCs-EVs might be involved in MSCs regulating IL-10 producing B cells.'
