caption: We propose a model for pigment cell lineages that includes two pathways for
  melanophores and iridophores to differentiate. Pigment cells may develop directly
  from neural crest cells or transit through a bi-potent pigment precursor stage.
  Between 18–24 hpf, neural crest cells begin to express lineage-specific markers.
  Xanthoblasts require csf1r and commit to the pteridine pigment synthesis pathway,
  as indicated by aox3 expression. Iridoblasts require ltk and continue along the
  purine synthesis pathway as indicated by pnp4a expression. Melanoblasts require
  mitfa and continue along the melanin synthesis pathway as indicated by dct expression.
  In addition, some mitfa+ cells will retain the capacity to produce either melanophores
  or iridophores, a process regulated by expression of Foxd3. Foxd3 is initially expressed
  in all neural crest cells at 18 hpf, then downregulated. Foxd3 reappears in approximately
  half of mitfa+ bi-potent precursors at 24 hpf, resulting in repression of mitfa,
  activation of pnp4a and promotion to an iridophore fate. A reciprocal population
  will remain Foxd3 negative, continue mitfa expression and follow the melanophore
  path.
