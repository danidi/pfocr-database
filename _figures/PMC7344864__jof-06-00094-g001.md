caption: Mechanisms of Mucor circinelloides to escape from macrophage fungistatic
  activity. When M. circinelloides spores are phagocytized, a complex gene response
  is activated to survive macrophages attack that encompasses the differential expression
  of genes involved in defense mechanisms, extracellular structures, metabolism, and
  cell wall []. This response also up-regulates transcription factors atf1 and atf2
  that regulate germination at low pH and other processes involved in the response
  to phagocytosis []. Calcineurin pathway is also activated and promotes phagosome
  maturation arrest []. The spore response to phagocytosis also comprises the activation
  of macrophage genes involved in apoptosis and proinflammatory response []. The NCRIP
  represses most of the genes of the phagocytosis-activated response in the absence
  of macrophages [], suggesting that some of the signals present in the phagosome
  repress this RNAi-related pathway to allow the activation of the spore response
  to phagocytosis. Green arrow, activation; red T, repression.
