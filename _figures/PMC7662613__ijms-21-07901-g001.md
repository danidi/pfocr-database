caption: The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway is a master
  regulator of cellular lipid droplet (LD) metabolism. LDs are spherical organelles
  composed of a phospholipid monolayer surrounding a core of neutral lipids. LDs have
  been described in both the cytoplasm (cLDs) and nucleus (nLDs) of homeostatic cells,
  with cLDs being better described. cLDs serve as docking platforms for Class I and
  Class II host LD proteins. LD metabolism is controlled by endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER)- and nuclear membrane-bound proteins called SREBPs, which control expression
  of key target genes involved in the biosynthesis and uptake of cholesterol and other
  lipids. When sterol levels are high, SREBPs are retained in an inactive state in
  the ER by SREBP-cleavage activating protein (SCAP) and insulin-induced gene (INSIG)
  (1). When sterol levels are low, INSIG dissociates from SCAP at the ER (2) and coat
  protein II (COPII)-coated vesicles transport SREBP-SCAP complexes to the Golgi apparatus
  (3), where the active N-terminal portion of SREBPs is cleaved by site-1 protease
  (S1P) (4) and site-2 protease (S2P) (5). The N-terminal portion of SREBPs then translocates
  to the nucleus (6) to act as a transcription factor coordinating expression of many
  lipid-metabolism related genes (7) that can subsequently impact LD biogenesis. SREBP
  regulation of LD metabolism can be further fine-tuned by exosome-packaged host microRNAs
  (miR) such as miR-29 (inhibits SCAP and SREBP-1 expression), miR-33 (inhibits SREBP-1
  expression) and miR-24 (inhibits INSIG expression). SREBP-regulated LD homeostasis
  also intersects with other cellular pathways such as lipophagy, which catabolizes
  LDs in microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-decorated autophagosomes
  to liberate their component lipids.
