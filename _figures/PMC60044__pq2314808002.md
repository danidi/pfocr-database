caption: The octadecanoid pathway for biosynthesis of jasmonic acid. Members of the
  jasmonate family of oxylipins are shown in blue. The reactive α,β-unsaturated carbonyl
  group in the cyclopentenone ring of OPDA is highlighted in red. The biosynthetic
  step blocked by the opr3 mutation is also indicated.
