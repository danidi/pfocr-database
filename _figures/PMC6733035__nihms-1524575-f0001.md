caption: A. The common innate lymphoid progenitor (CILP) gives rise to the natural
  killer (NK) and innate lymphoid cell (ILC) lineages. Downstream of the CILP, the
  common helper innate lymphoid cell progenitor (CHILP) gives rise to all helper ILCs
  but has lost NK cell potential. In the liver, ILCk are derived from PLZF-expressing
  ILCp. However, it remains to be determined whether ILCk are differentiated via a
  distinct pathway downstream of ILCp or converted from helper ILC. The identity of
  a NK-committed progenitor downstream of the CILP remains unclear. Tissue-resident
  NK cells may be converted from conventional NK cells but may also be derived from
  an earlier progenitor.B. Cytotoxic innate lymphocytes survey epithelial to detect
  cancer associated danger signals. They could sense malignancy via IL-15R and NKG2D-mediated
  signals, while the role of ECM cues and E-cadehrin-CD103 axis is less clear.
