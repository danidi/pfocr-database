caption: Proposed model for the SXR-mediated response to irinotecan in colon cancer
  cells. In LS180 cells, CPT-11 is metabolized to SN-38 by the carboxylesterases (CE).
  SN-38 induces the activation of SXR. Consequently, the transcription factor is recruited
  to the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 promoter and upregulates the expression of these genes.
  SXR also constitutively activates MDR1 and MRP1 expression. As a feedback loop,
  CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and the transporters reduce the concentration of active irinotecan
  inside the cell, which favors cell proliferation. As a consequence, we propose that
  the combined detection of SXR together with a high expression of CYP3A4 should help
  to define in advance the subsets of tumors that will fail to respond to chemotherapy
  based on irinotecan treatment.
