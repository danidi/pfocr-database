caption: Cascade of inflammatory pathway in brain after acute HI. Resting microglia
  get activated to M1 type through classical pathway and M2 type through alternate
  pathway. M1 microglia release inflammatory cytokines, which cause disruption of
  blood–brain barrier (BBB). The BBB disruption promotes infiltration of macrophages,
  which further release inflammatory cytokines. Active microglia and macrophages release
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), which contribute
  to the secondary neuronal injury. M2 microglia release trophic factors, which contribute
  to the neuronal repair. TNF-α, a potent proinflammatory cytokine contributes to
  peripheral immune cell recruitment and proliferation in the brain, neuronal apoptosis,
  oligodendrocytes, and axonal injury after HI (). IL-1β blocks oligodendrocyte proliferation
  () and elevates levels of circulating IL-6, another potent cytokine that contributes
  to early neurologic deterioration after brain ischemia (, ). Matrix metalloproteinases
  (MMPs) disrupt the BBB and allow peripheral leukocyte infiltration (). Macrophage
  colony stimulating factor (MCSF), released mainly by macrophages, T cells, B cells,
  and microglia, induces proliferation, migration, and activation of microglia and
  regulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages (, ). MCP-1,
  a chemokine secreted by active microglia and astrocytes in response to injury (),
  mediates the migration of microglia, monocytes, and lymphocytes to the site of injury
  in the CNS (, ).
