caption: 'Sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins from solanaceous plants. Molecular structures
  and proposed pathways for synthesis of sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins in solanaceous
  plants. Farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) is the common precursor for all compounds, which
  leads to two separate pathways. The yellow pathway generates solavetivone-type phytoalexins
  and is present in potato and tomato. The blue pathway leads to the formation of
  capsidiol and debneyol and is found in Nicotiana benthamiana. In potato tubers,
  detoxification of rishitin was found to result in rishitin-M1 and rishitin-M2 as
  depicted in the gray pathway. Solid arrows: Enzymes have been characterized. Dotted
  arrows: enzyme unknown and intermediates may exist. EAS, 5-epi-aristolochene synthase;
  EAH (5-epi-aristolochene dihydroxylase; HPS, Hyoscyamus muticus premnaspirodiene
  synthase; HPO H. muticus premnaspirodiene oxygenase.'
