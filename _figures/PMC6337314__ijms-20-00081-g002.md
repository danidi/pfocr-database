caption: TREM2 activation and downstream signaling. sTREM2 is generated by ADAM10
  or ADAM17 mediated proteolytic cleavage. Ligand-activated TREM2 interacts with immune
  receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on TYROBP, which leads to TYROBP
  phosphorylation and recruitment of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). TYROBP/SYK mediated
  activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)—AKT pathway and phosphorylation of
  LAT (linker for activation of T-cells family member 1), recruits other signaling
  adaptors including phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). PLCγ degrades phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PIP3) into inositol trisphosphate (IP3), inducing an efflux of Ca2+. The ability
  of TREM2 to bind ligands is influenced by genetic variations, some of which are
  associated with AD, and located adjacent to or within an electrostatically basic
  patch (light blue).
