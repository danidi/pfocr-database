caption: Relevant aspects of phosphoinositide metabolism. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
  (PtdIns(4,5)P2) is an important phospholipid in cell signalling producing three
  separate ‘second messenger' molecules. It is hydrolysed by a variety of phospholipase
  C (PLC) isoforms to produce diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The
  former is the physiological activator of the diacylglycerol-regulated protein kinase
  C isoforms (see ), whereas the latter is important in the regulation of intracellular
  Ca2+ movements. In cardiac myocytes, the phospholipase Cβ isoforms are best studied
  in this regard. In a second signalling pathway, PtdIns(4,5)P2 is phosphorylated
  by phosphoinositide 3′ kinase (PI3K) to form phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate
  (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3). This regulates the activity of the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent
  kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) signalling pathway (see ). Phosphoinositides are dephosphorylated
  (hydrolysed) by a number of lipid phosphatases. One such phosphatase which hydrolyses
  the 5-phosphate of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is
  inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase f, which produces phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate
  and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, respectively.
