caption: 'Under Fe deficiency conditions, a branch of the phenylpropanoid pathway
  consisting of F6’H1, S8H and CYP82C4 is strongly induced, leading to the synthesis
  of scopoletin and its conversion into redox-active fraxetin and sideretin. These
  molecules are found as glycosides in the root () but are drawn as the aglycones
  for simplicity. Deglycosylation likely occurs as a step coupled to the export process.
  Secretion of oxygenated coumarins to the rhizosphere is mediated by the ATP-binding
  cassette protein PDR9. Sideretin is invariably the most abundant coumarin exuded
  by roots of Fe-deficient plants (and is shown as the sole secreted coumarin for
  simplicity), although at high pH considerable amounts of esculetin and fraxetin
  can be detected in the root exudates. In the rhizosphere, the redox-active coumarins
  act in concert with other components of the strategy I iron acquisition machinery
  (AHA2, FRO2 and IRT1) by solubilizing and reducing Fe from sparingly available sources.
  AHA2: Arabidopsis H+-ATPase 2 (At4g30190).'
