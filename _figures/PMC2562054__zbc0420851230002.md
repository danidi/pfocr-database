caption: The incorporation of 3H into G-3-P from body water.  Hydrogens of C-3 of
  pyruvate become labeled through exchange with body water  during transamination
  with alanine and keto-enol tautomerization as well as  during the equilibrium of
  malate with fumarate so that both hydrogens of C-3  of phosphoenolpyruvate, which
  forms the C-3 of glyceraldehyde-3-P, will have  the same SA as that of body water.
  Additional labeling occurs at the level of  the triose phosphate pool when C-1 and
  C-2 acquire 3H directly from  the body water. Thus, the 3H of C-1 and C-2 of G-3-P
  were derived  from the triose phosphate pool. The 3H of C-3 of G-3-P were derived  entirely
  from pyruvate. Hydrogens labeled with 3H are highlighted  in red.
