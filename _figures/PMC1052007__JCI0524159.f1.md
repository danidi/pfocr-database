caption: Intracellular Ca2+ cycling and associated signaling pathway in cardiomyocytes.
  On a beat-by-beat basis, a calcium transient is evoked by the initial influx of
  a small amount of Ca2+ through the LTCC and the subsequent large-scale Ca2+ release
  from the SR through the RyR. During diastole, cytosolic Ca2+ is taken up into the
  SR by the PLN-regulated SERCA2a pump. β receptor–mediated PKA stimulation regulates
  this Ca2+ cycling by phosphorylating LTCC, RyR, and PLN. In normal hearts, sympathetic
  stimulation activates β1-adrenergic receptor, which in turn stimulates the production
  of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase and thereby activates PKA. PKA phosphorylates PLN and
  RyR, both of which contribute to an increased intracellular Ca2+ transient and enhanced
  cellular contractility (pink zone signal). PP1 and PP2A regulate the dephosphorylation
  process of these Ca2+regulatory proteins (RyR, PLN, LTCC) (blue zone signaling).
  Activation of the Gαq-coupled receptors (angiotensin II receptor, endothelin 1 receptor,
  or α-adrenergic receptor) activates PLC, which in turn activates PKC-α. The PKC-α
  phosphorylates I-1, augmenting the activity of PP1 and causing hypophosphorylation
  of PLB. The PLB hypophosphorylation inhibits SERCA2a activity, thereby decreasing
  SR Ca2+ uptake. The increased Ca2+ level in the cytosol activates CAMKII, which
  affects the functions of RyR and PLN. Activation or deactivation of these molecules
  at a node in the signaling cascade affects beat-by-beat Ca2+ cycling, and such maneuvers
  have recently been highlighted as potential new therapeutic strategies against HF.
