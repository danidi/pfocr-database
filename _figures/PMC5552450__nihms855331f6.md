caption: The de novo serine biosynthesis pathway branches from glycolysis at 3-phosphoglycerate
  (3PG). The enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) oxidizes 3PG to phosphohydroxypyruvate
  (P-pyruvate) in the presence of cofactor NAD+. P-pyruvate is then converted to phosphoserine
  (P-ser) by phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1). Serine is eventually synthesized
  after the last step of dephosphorylation by phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH). Glycine
  metabolism is linked to serine metabolism through serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT). This reversible reaction is critical in bridging glycolytic substrates with
  compounds in one-carbon metabolism. The figure is adapted from  and .
