caption: When naive 5C.C7 CD4+ T cells receive strong TCR signals, strong and prolonged
  ERK activation is induced. This intense ERK activation results in failure to produce
  early IL-4 by suppressing IL-4-independent TCR-driven early GATA-3 expression and
  by transiently blocking IL-2R-mediated STAT5 activation (Right). By contrast, when
  naive 5C.C7 CD4+ T cells receive weak TCR signals, the level of ERK activation is
  not so strong as to suppress early GATA-3 expression or to inhibit the IL-2/STAT5
  pathway. GATA-3 and STAT5 subsequently translocate into the nucleus and bind to
  the DNase hypersensitivity sites II/III and V in the Il4 gene locus, leading to
  the induction of early IL-4 production, completion of the induction phase and subsequent
  Th2 polarization process (Left).
