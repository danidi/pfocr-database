caption: See Discussion for a more detailed explanation of the models. The cylinders
  embedded in the plasma membrane represent various types of ion channels. Blue arrows
  indicate the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the ER. Burgundy arrows indicate the
  ER-dependent Ca2+ accumulation pathway. Yellow arrows indicate the ER-independent
  Ca2+ increase pathway. The establishment of the calcium pool in the ER requires
  the calcium chaperons calreticulin (CRT-1) and calnexin (CNX-1). The release of
  Ca2+ from the ER requires the ryanodine receptor, whose activity is inhibited by
  dantrolene, and the InsP3 receptor (InsP3R). SERCA is an ER-surface Ca2+ reuptake
  pump whose function is inhibited by thapsigargin. Dominant mutations of DEC/ENaC
  channel subunits allow a small amount of Ca2+ to enter neurons. This, in turn, triggers
  a “Ca2+-induced” Ca2+ release from the ER, results in a further increase of cytoplasmic
  Ca2+ concentration. The resulting surge in the level of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ activates
  multiple downstream targets to induce parallel necrosis events. Dominant mutations
  in Ca2+ channels DEG-3 or TRP-4 induce PS exposure independent of the ER Ca2+ pool,
  presumably due to the large amount of Ca2+ let in the cells by these constitutively
  open Ca2+ channels. ANOH-1 function is necessary for the efficient PS exposure triggered
  by both ER-dependent and ER-independent Ca2+ increase mechanisms and we propose
  ANOH-1 is a prime candidate for a Ca2+-target that facilitates PS exposure. In addition,
  question marks indicate that the increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ might also activate
  CED-7 or other unknown PS-externalization enzymes. Besides Ca2+, there might be
  other upstream signaling molecules that induce PS exposure.
