caption: Model for regulation of expression/activity of multiple P450s by AKR1D1.
  Cholesterol is converted to CA and CDCA via a classic pathway (starting with CYP7A1)
  and an alternative pathway (starting with CYP27A1). Both bile acid synthesis pathways
  include AKR1D1-mediated catalysis of the 5β-reduction of bile acid intermediates.
  These 5β-reduced intermediates are finally converted to the primary bile acids CDCA
  and CA, which can serve as endogenous ligands of nuclear receptors PXR and CAR that
  upon activation can regulate the transcription of multiple P450s including CYP3A,
  CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. CA, cholic acid.
