number: Figure 3
caption: Different levels of drug-drug interactions. The figure shows that the effect
  of combining two drugs can be elicited at the level of target (drugs targeting different
  sites within the same target via similar or different mechanisms), pathway (drugs
  targeting different signaling proteins within the same cascade), processes (drugs
  targeting different processes contributing to the disease phenotype) and patient
  (where the effect of the drug combination will depend on how the drugs will influence
  each other’s ADME properties and pharmacological effects).
