caption: Cell窶田ell communication by extracellular vesicles in multiple myeloma. Massive
  proliferation of abnormal plasma cells is shown in the centre. The centre of the
  mass has pale blue plasma cells, indicating the hypoxic state. In addition to conventional
  signalling pathways, such as direct cell adhesion and soluble factors, either extracellular
  vesicles (EVs) derived from multiple myeloma (MM) cells (MM-EVs; small green circles)
  or EVs derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC-EVs; small orange
  circles) modify the behaviour of recipient cells as follows. MM-EVs modulate BM-MSCs
  and induce a favourable microenvironment for MM cells. Conversely, BM-MSC-EVs also
  induce MM cell growth, survival and drug resistance (bottom right). MM-EVs induce
  angiogenesis. In a long-lasting hypoxic state, EV-miR-135b acts as a mediator of
  angiogenesis through the FIH-1/hypoxia-inducible factor-1 signalling pathway (bottom
  left). BM-MSC-EVs interact with myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and MM-EVs
  modulate immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, resulting in immunosuppression
  (top right). MM-EVs activate osteoclasts which may be linked to osteolysis in MM
  (top left).
