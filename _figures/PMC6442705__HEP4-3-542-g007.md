caption: 'Mechanistic illustration of the effect of alcohol on the dysregulation of
  genes involving several metabolic pathways leading to alterations in serum metabolomic
  profiles. The levels of taurine‐conjugated BAs (TCA, TCDCA, and TUDCA) are markedly
  increased compared to glycine‐conjugated forms (GCA, GCDCA, and GUDCA) in patients
  with AC. This is associated with an increase in hepatic CYP7B1 expression in the
  BA synthesis pathway and taurine content secondary to the dysregulation of homocysteine
  metabolism. Increased levels of GCDCA, TCDCA, GCA, and TCA are positively correlated
  with disease progression from Child‐Pugh A to C and MELD scores, whereas GCDCA,
  GCA, and GUDCA are better predictors following alcohol abstinence. Alcohol also
  inhibits the expression of several nuclear receptors, such as FXR, HNF4α, LXR, and
  PXR, and affects the serum levels of FGF19, FGF21, and GLP‐1. An increase in the
  by‐product of heme metabolism in the serum is associated with the induction of BVRA,
  whereas the inhibition of genes related to sulfuration, such as SULT1E1 and SULT2A1,
  leads to a reduction in serum‐sulfated steroids. Abbreviations: AHCY, adenosylhomocysteinase;
  BHMT, betaine‐homocysteine S‐methyltransferase; CBS, cystathionine‐beta‐synthase;
