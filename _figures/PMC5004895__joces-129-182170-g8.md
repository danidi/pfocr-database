caption: A model for threshold-setting by noise canceling and overriding pathways
  in 1-MeAde signaling. (A) In unstimulated immature oocytes, an unknown phosphatase
  for Akt substrates is active (PPase X), and all pathways shown in B and C with colors
  are inactive. (B) When oocytes receive a subthreshold 1-MeAde stimulus, the atypical
  Gβγpathway (cyan) works cooperatively with the PI3K–Akt pathway (green) to phosphorylate
  Myt1 and Cdc25, thereby initiating activation of cyclin-B–Cdk1. However, cyclin-B–Cdk1
  activates cyclin-B–Cdk1-dependent negative feedback (magenta), resulting in activation
  of an unknown phosphatase (note that here we drew this phosphatase as the PPase
  X, although it remains unclear whether they are the same molecule or not), thereby
  dephosphorylating Cdc25 and Myt1. Finally, cyclin-B–Cdk1 is inactivated by suppressive
  phosphorylation without reaching maximum activity. Although the cyclin-B–Cdk1-dependent
  positive-feedback pathway (black arrow from cyclin-B–Cdk1) might be partially activated,
  it is inactivated along with cyclin-B–Cdk1 before formation of an autonomously sustainable
  positive-feedback loop. (C) When oocytes receive supra-threshold 1-MeAde stimulus,
  the atypical Gβγpathway and PI3K–Akt pathway activate cyclin-B–Cdk1. Although cyclin-B–Cdk1-dependent
  negative feedback might be active under these conditions, the atypical Gβγpathway
  would be strongly activated enough to override this negative-feedback mechanism
  to maintain phosphorylation of Akt substrates. Thus, cyclin-B–Cdk1 reaches maximum
  activity through a fully functional positive-feedback loop, and oocytes irreversibly
  undergo the meiotic G2/M transition.
