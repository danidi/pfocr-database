caption: 'Proposed model for the HGH solution-induced HPMC death. HGH solution increases
  of Ca2+ (1) and Na+ (2) levels are potentially dependent on ion channel activities.
  A sodium influx could generate membrane depolarization (3), which can induce voltage-activated
  calcium channel opening (4) and cell death (5). Intracellular calcium may activate
  enzymes, including PKC (6), PLC (7), and NOS (8). Increased ROS level could trigger
  HGH-induced HPMC death (9), and NOS-dependent NO generation would be relevant in
  inducing HPMC death (9–10). HGH-induced HPMC death could be carried out through
  the PLC/PKC/NOX/ROS signaling pathway (12–15). In line with this, NOX2 might be
  involved in both HGH-induced ROS production (14) and HPMC death (9). Furthermore,
  PKC activation may occur as a consequence of PLC-mediated G-protein activation (16–17).
  The PI3K/Akt pathway could also involved in the HPMC death induced by HGH exposure
  (18–19), and would be mainly activated through the activation of tyrosine-kinase
  receptors (20–21). HGH, high-glucose hypertonic; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; NO,
  nitric oxide; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; HPMC, human peritoneal mesothelial cells;
  PKC, protein kinase C; NOX, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase;
  PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B. Solid arrow: direct
  activation. Discontinuous arrow: indirect/unknown activation mechanism or potential
  effect.'
