caption: Pathways involved in protein turnover. Protein turnover involves a delicate
  balance of synthetic and catabolic mechanisms. Insulin and insulin-like growth factor
  1 (IGF-1) signaling lead to protein synthesis through activation of the mTOR pathway,
  Akt signaling, and phosphorylation of forkhead box (FoxO). Protein degradation occurs
  via major cellular proteolytic pathways, which can be enhanced by cytokines and
  reactive oxygen species. Dysregulated insulin signaling, increased cytokine expression,
  decreased antioxidant capacity, and upregulation of the Ub-proteasome system can
  all lead to an imbalance in protein turnover, favoring degradation over synthesis.
  Circled pathway members, with arrows indicating direction of change, are the results
  presented in this article. Dashed arrows and crosses show what we predict occurs
  to other pathway members based on the data we have presented. Together, these changes
  may lead to decreased protein synthesis and enhanced protein breakdown.
