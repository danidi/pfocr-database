caption: Inter-individual mRNA expression variances in the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with normal
  control (NC). The graph shows genes affected by significant intra-group inter-individual
  mRNA expression variances in RA compared with NC (P ≤ 0.05; Bonferroni/Holm corrected
  Brown-Forsythe version of the Levene test; labeled in red) in the Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) MAPK signaling pathway. Among the three MAPK family
  sub-pathways, the classical and the c-jun kinase (JNK)/p38 MAPK sub-pathways were
  significantly affected by gene expression variances (P ≤ 0.15, χ2 test; indicated
  in red). MAPK-regulated cellular processes with potential influence on or relevance
  for RA pathogenesis (for example, proliferation, inflammation, and anti-apoptosis)
  are labeled in blue.
