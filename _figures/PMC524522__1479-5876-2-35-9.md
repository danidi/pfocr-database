caption: Mapping molecular correlates of aggressive mesothelioma to highly curated
  molecular pathways can identify the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease.
  This information could be used for diagnosis, as well identification of the key
  steps that may represent intervention points in the treatment of the disease. The
  red arrow indicates a predicted therapeutic target (EGFR). Pathway mapping was generated
  using MetaCore™ (GeneGo, Inc., St. Joseph, MI). For more information on this pathway
  mapping tool, see .
