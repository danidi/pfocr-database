caption: The coagulation pathway and its relationship to the fibrinolytic system (modification
  of reference []). In the coagulation cascade, the activation of factor X is initiated
  by both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, which converge in the formation of a fibrin
  plug, which is degraded by plasmin in the fibrinolytic system. Activated factors
  are indicated with a lowercase “a”.
