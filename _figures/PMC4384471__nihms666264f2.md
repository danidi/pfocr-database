caption: 'Interferon (IFN) signaling via the JAK–STAT pathway. Once type I or III
  IFNs engage their cognate receptors at the cell surface, individual receptor chains
  are brought into close proximity. As a result, intracellular receptor-associated
  tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of proteins are juxtaposed and
  become activated. Activated JAK proteins subsequently phosphorylate (P) members
  of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of proteins,
  ultimately leading to the transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs).
  Inasmuch as is currently known, after receptor engagement, type I and III IFNs signal
  through the same pathway: activation of the two JAK proteins, JAK1 and TYK2, results
  in the phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine residues on STAT1 and STAT2, followed
  by formation of a heterotrimeric complex with IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). This
  complex, referred to as IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), translocates to the
  nucleus and binds to a DNA sequence known as the IFN-stimulated response element
  (ISRE) in the promoters of ISGs. As a result, hundreds of ISGs are transcriptionally
  regulated. In addition to stimulating transcription of numerous genes, IFN signaling
  also leads to the transcriptional repression of a variety of genes; however, the
  underlying mechanisms and outcomes are comparatively underexplored (reviewed in
  []). Abbreviations: GAF, γ-interferon activation factor; GAS, γ-interferon activation
