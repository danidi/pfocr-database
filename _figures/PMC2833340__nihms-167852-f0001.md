caption: 'Two major PCP pathways have been defined: The Fat pathway (red) and the
  Core PCP pathway (blue). Fat signaling has global effects, possibly due to the production
  of additional signaling molecules such as the hypothetical Factor “X.” In vertebrates,
  Fat binds to two cytoskeletal regulators: Homer and Ena/Vasp, suggesting autonomous
  effects at the level of the cytoskeleton. Fat/Ds interactions are modulated by Fjx,
  which either acts as a secreted protein or in the Golgi to modify their extracellular
  domains. Interactions among the core PCP genes result in the asymmetric distribution
  of Vang and Pk to one side of the cell and Fz and Dvl to the other. Celsr is present
  on both sides. Protein localization is also influenced by cell-cell interactions,
  although it is not clear whether this involves direct binding. The apical-basal
  axis (green) is determined by mutually inhibitory interactions between the Par complex
  and the Scribble (Scrb) complex. Scribble can bind to Vang in vertebrates, where
  it is also required for PCP. One component of the Par complex, aPKC, has been shown
  to function downstream of a Wnt signaling pathway (purple). Although Wnts do not
  regulate polarity in Drosophila, non-canonical Wnt signaling is required for hair
  cell orientation and axon guidance. Vertebrate protein names are provided wherever
  possible. Proteins with only hypothetical roles in the pathways are shown in gray;
  unclear interactions are indicated with question marks. For example, a vertebrate
  homolog of Diego (Dgo) has not yet been investigated, nor is it clear whether Scrb
  and aPKC affect PCP signaling in the context of the Scrb and Par complexes respectively.
  The Hippo branch of the Fat pathway is not shown as there is as yet no evidence
