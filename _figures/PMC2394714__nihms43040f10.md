caption: Model for TGF-β1-induced PAI-1 expression in VSMC. The available data indicates
  that TGF-β1 activates two distinct signaling pathways that initiate transcription
  of PAI-1 in VSMC. Rho/ROCK are required for SMAD phosphorylation as well as ERK
  activation (through yet to be defined mechanisms) while the pp60c-src-activated
  EGFR (at the Y845 site) signals to MEK-ERK initiating likely ERK/USF interactions
  resulting in USF phosphorylation and a subtype (USF-1→USF-2) switch [e.g., 45,46]
  at the PAI-1 PE1/PE2 E box sites. Collectively, these two promoter-level events
  stimulate high levels of PAI-1 in response to TGF-βR occupancy. The actual mechanism
  underlying EGFR activation in response to TGF-β1 is currently under investigation
  but may involve direct recruitment of src kinases to the EGFR or the processing
  and release of a membrane-anchored EGFR ligand (e.g., HB-EGF). Similarly, events
  associated with TGF-β1 stimulation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway are presently unclear.
