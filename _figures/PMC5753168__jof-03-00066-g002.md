number: Figure 2
caption: 'Regulation of the dimorphic transition in C. albicans via multiple signaling
  pathways. Signaling pathways are illustrated in different colors: cyclic AMP (cAMP)-
  protein kinase A (PKA) pathway (yellow), Hsp90 pathway (green), Rim101 pathway (blue)
  and Pes1 pathway (purple). Solid lines or arrows represent direct regulation. Dotted
  lines or arrows represent indirect or unknown regulation. Positive and negative
  relationships between components are illustrated in black and red, respectively.
  Transcription factors are illustrated with a rectangle, transcriptional co-repressors
  with a triangle, and other proteins with an oval.'
