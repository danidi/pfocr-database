caption: GM-CSF produced locally in the lung interacts with receptors on nearby alveolar
  macrophages stimulating terminal differentiation (paracrine mode) thereby enabling
  the numerous functions and signaling pathways, e.g., TLR4 pathway. Pathological
  stimuli activate signaling pathways with biologic responses important to host defense
  of that cell. GM-CSF released by and binding to the cell’s own GM-CSF receptors
  (autocrine mode) switches them into the tyrosine577-mediated, high activity state
  [], activating the macrophage, which enhances immune functions and stimulates proliferation.
  This autocrine mode of action provides a fine control for GM-CSF to modulate host
  defenses on a microscopic scale in the local microenvironment of the cell (i.e.,
  after encountering a pathogen) independent of other components of regional or systemic
  immunity. GM-CSF originating from a ‘upstream’ site of inflammation can stimulate
  macrophages at distal sites (endocrine mode), which may result in unnecessary (pathologic)
  activation. Low levels of GM-CSF autoantibodies in healthy individuals appear to
  block endocrine signaling and may modulate autocrine modes of GM-CSF signaling,
  whereas high levels in PAP patients also block paracrine signaling resulting in
  maturational arrest of macrophages.
