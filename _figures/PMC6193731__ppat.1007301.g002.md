caption: 'Several enzymes of energy storage pathways are up-regulated in persister
  cells (indicated in green), whereas glycolysis is down-regulated (indicated in red),
  suggesting that C. albicans persister cells are adapted to the absence of glucose.
  Icl1 and Mls1 are up-regulated in persister cells. This results in an increase in
  oxaloacetate that enters gluconeogenesis that is converted to phophoenolpyruvate
  by Pck1. Pck1, together with Fbp1, are also up-regulated in persister cells and
  are both key enzymes in the gluconeogenesis pathway. The up-regulation of these
  enzymes will likely result in an increased flux towards the production of energy
  storage molecules such as trehalose and glycogen. Additionally, up-regulation of
  Fbp1 also results in a decreased amount of fructose-1,6-biphosphate, which is the
  activator of Ras1. This suggests that persister cells have a lower proportion of
  active Ras1. Finally, Hsp90, which is up-regulated in persister cells may also inhibit
  the activation of Ras1 in persister cells. Ras1 is up-regulated in persister cells,
  and because persister cells appear to have a lower proportion of active Ras1, this
  may prepare persister cells for a rapid metabolic switch to restart proliferation.
  Dashed bold lines: likely to occur in persister cells; bold lines: proven in persister
  cells; dashed lines: likely to occur in cells growing in the presence of glucose.
  All other lines: proven to occur in cells growing in the presence of glucose. Fbp1,
  fructose-1,6-biphosphatase; GDP, guanosine-5''-diphosphate; GTP, guanosine-5''-triphosphate;

  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Ras1, rat sarcoma.'
