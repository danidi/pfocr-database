caption: MAO A generates ROS that inhibits PHD activity and stabilizes HIF1α to induce
  epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Generation of ROS by MAO A is elevated by
  hypoxic conditions that are characteristic of the tumor microenvironment. MAO A’s
  activation of VEGF-A/NRP1 signaling upregulates the AKT/FOXO1 pathway, resulting
  in the nuclear export of FOXO1 transcription repressor to increase the expression
  of nuclear TWIST1. Overall, increasing the MAO A expression promotes epithelial
  to mesenchymal transition, hypoxia and ROS production to drive prostate tumorigenesis,
  progression and metastasis. (Adapted from )
