caption: Overview of the heme biosynthetic pathway. Three known MCF members are involved
  in heme biosynthesis. Following its transport into the matrix by Hem25p/SLC25A38,
  glycine is condensed with succinyl-CoA by ALA synthase to form δ-aminolevulinic
  acid. The next four steps of the heme biosynthetic pathway occur in the cytosol.
  The identity of the protein, which may be a MCF member, that mediates the transport
  of δ-aminolevulinic acid across the inner membrane has not been determined. The
  active sites of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase and Protoporphyrinogen oxidase face
  the intermembrane space. In contrast, the final step in the heme biosynthetic pathway
  occurs in the matrix and is catalyzed by ferrochelatase. The identity of the protein,
  which may be a MCF member, that transports protoporphyrin IX to the matrix has not
  been determined. Ferrochelatase incorporates iron (Fe), transported into the matrix
  by the mitoferrins SLC25A28 and SLC25A37, into protoporphyrin IX to produce heme.
