caption: The Warburg effect and typical glucose metabolism in cancer cells. Cancer
  cells absorb higher levels of glucose than normal cells and generate energy by the
  non-oxidative breakdown of glucose (glycolysis). Cancer cells are generally found
  under hypoxic conditions, and glucose uptake and glycolytic pathway metabolisms
  are upregulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). HIF-1 upregulates glucose
  transporter expression, such as GLUT1 and GLUT3, and increases glucose uptake. It
  also activates enzymes for glycolysis such as HK2, PFK, PKM2, and LDH. Lastly, HIF-1
  inhibits the pathway at the pyruvate conversion to acetyl-CoA step by activating
  PDK1.
