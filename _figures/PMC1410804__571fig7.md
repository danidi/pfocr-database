caption: Cdc42 regulates HF differentiation and cell–cell contacts in keratinocytes
  by modulating the turnover of β-catenin and plakoglobin. Phosphorylation of free
  cytosolic β-catenin and plakoglobin by GSK3β targets these molecules for proteasomal
  degradation. GSK3β is part of a multiprotein complex that contains, among other
  molecules, APC and axin. Wnt signaling via the frizzled (Frz)-LPR receptor inhibits
  via disheveled (dsh) GSK3β activity, increasing the concentration of cytosolic β-catenin.
  (A) Activated Cdc42 can bind to a cytosolic complex of Par6–Par3–PKCζ, leading to
  inhibition of GSK3β activity by PKCζ-dependent phosphorylation of GSK3β. This leads
  to reduced phosphorylation of axin and decreased phosphorylation and degradation
  of β-catenin. Free cytosolic β-catenin can then go to the nucleus and, together
  with a transcription factor of the LEF/TCF family (LEF-1), induce the expression
  of HF-specific genes. (B) Loss of Cdc42 results in a reduced phosphorylation and
  an increased activity of GSK3β. This leads to an increased phosphorylation of axin,
  an increased degradation of free β-catenin and, consequently, decreased levels of
  nuclear β-catenin so that HF-specific genes cannot be induced. Instead, the default
  pathway of epidermal differentiation is used. Since plakoglobin is degraded by the
  same pathway as β-catenin, plakoglobin is also decreased in the absence of Cdc42,
  resulting in a reduction of junctional β-catenin and plakoglobin and, secondarily,
  a reduced transport of E-cadherin to the cell membrane. In suprabasal keratinocytes
  and in vitro, Akt activation compensates for the loss of Cdc42, leading to normal
  phosphorylation of GSK3β and normal levels of cytosolic β-catenin.
