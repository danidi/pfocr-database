caption: Inherited metabolic disease caused by pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) deficiencies,
  including two glycolytic enzymopathies with effects on the PPP. PPP enzymopathies
  are caused either by complete or partial deficiency of PPP and glycolytic enzymes.
  Abbreviations are defined in , H6PDH, hexose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.
