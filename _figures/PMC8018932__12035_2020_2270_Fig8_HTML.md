caption: Proposed model of mToxin effects in the brain of AD mice (with emphasis upon
  α7AChR function). a The development of AD-like phenotype in mice is characterized
  by neuroinflammation, astrogliosis, gradual Aβ deposition, cholinergic deficits
  due to block of α7AChR by Aβ oligomeric and fibrillar species, followed by α7AChR
  internalization. Also, these processes eventuate in the downregulation of the MAPK/ERK
  pathway that exacerbates the cognitive decline. b mToxin competes with Aβ for the
  binding to α7AChR and modulates its activity. Also, the treatment leads to a reduction
  in astrogliosis and neuroinflammation, which subsequently moderates the APP transcription,
  translation, and processing rates. Likewise, the treatment eventuates in activation
  of ERK and memory improvement. Of note, neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
  are located preterminally, presynaptically, and postsynaptically. ACh released from
  presynaptic vesicles diffuse and activate presynaptic α7AChR as well as postsynaptic,
  which results in the recruiting of neurotransmitter reserves and modulation of its
  release. Accordingly, PPF demonstrate significantly improved ratios following the
  treatment with mToxin. BACE1-β-secretase
