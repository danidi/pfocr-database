caption: The putative interaction between the microbiome and immune response in CAVD
  development. Increased shear stress, genetic factors, and oxygen reactive species
  cause the endothelial damage that allows ox-LDLs, immune and inflammatory cells
  to infiltrate the valve. Macrophages and ox-LDLs stimulate VICs inflammation through
  NF-κB/IL-6 signaling pathway. The microbiome and microbial metabolites can modulate
  the immune system through the intense effect of SFCAs on T cells’ differentiation.
  Furthermore, the bacterial metabolite TMAO can induce ox-LDL and maintain the inflammatory
  loop. IL-6, interleukin 6; NF-κB, nuclear factor κ-light-chain enhancer of activated
  B cells; ox-LDL, oxidized low-density lipoprotein; SCFA, short-chain fatty acid;
  TMAO-Trimethylamine-N oxide; VECs, valve endothelial cells; VICs, vascular interstitial
  cells.
