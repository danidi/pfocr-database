caption: 'Enzymes for Healthcare Applications. Enzymes for healthcare applications
  can include: (a) Enzymes used directly as “drugs”, such as the l-asparaginase (b)
  enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of active compounds, such as polyketides,
  carotenoids, or oxylipins. In the synthesis of polyketides, the enzymes studied
  are polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthases. For the synthesis of
  carotenoids, the most studied enzymes are phytoene synthase (PSY), phytoene decarboxylase
  (PDS) and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP). For the synthesis of oxylipins the studied
  enzymes are lipoic acid hydrolases (LAH) and PLAT (Polycystin-1, Lipoxygenase, Alpha-Toxin)/LH2
  (Lipoxygenase homology). An example of molecules and their roles for each pathway
  is also outlined.'
