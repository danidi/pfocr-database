caption: ROS can activate cytosolic ATM. ATM is activated in response to both endogenous
  and exogenous ROS, as well as NO at Cys2991, where it forms a disulphide bond. Once
  activated, it phosphorylates LKB1 at Thr366 which phosphorylates AMPK and drives
  the inhibition of mTORC1 through TSC2. The inhibition of mTORC1 phosphorylates ULK1
  at Ser757, whilst AMPK phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser313. This initiates autophagy and
  the formation of an autophagosome that targets peroxisomes specifically for degradation
  through the ATM-mediated ubiquitination of PEX5. It is currently unknown whether
  ATM is involved in either the activation of AMPK or suppression of mTOR in response
  to ROS to induce mitophagy. ATM mediates PINK/Parkin mitophagy pathway in response
  to spermidine treatment, which induces ROS and consequently activate ATM, that is
  then recruited to the permeabilized mitochondrial membrane where it colocalize with
  PINK and drives the recruitment of Parkin which is ubiquitinated. The ubiquitin
  chain binds to LC3 (green balls) on the autophagosome, which then engulfs damaged
  mitochondria for lysosomal degradation (not shown). Hypoxia or mitochondrial uncoupling
  can also activate ULK1, driving its translocation to the damaged mitochondrion membrane
  where it phosphorylates FUNDC1, which enhances its binding to LC3, whereas the dephosphorylation
  of FUNDC1 by PGAM5 also allows FUNDC1 to directly interact with LC3. BNIP and NIX
  can act as mitochondrial receptors in response to hypoxia when the mitochondrial
  membrane is not permeabilized and bind to LC3 on the autophagosome. Damaged mitochondria
  produce less ATP that activates AMPK, which in turn phosphorylates ULK1 and activates
  the Beclin1-VSP34-VSP15 complex and drives the formation of an autophagosome. Damaged
  mitochondria can also produce ROS which inhibits mTOR and leads to the activation
  of autophagy.
