caption: Autophagic pathways in mammalian cells. Three different types of autophagy
  co-exist in most types of mammalian cells. The major molecular components that participate
  in the execution and regulation of each of these autophagic pathways are depicted
  here. (A) Macroautophagy involves the sequestration of cytosolic regions by a de
  novo formed membrane that seals into a double membrane vesicle or autophagosome.
  Fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes is required for cargo degradation. Induction
  ofmacroautophagy leads to the mobilization of a protein kinase type III complex
  (the initiation complex) towards the sites of autophagosome formation. Lipid phosphorylation
  of this kinase complex is essential for the recruitment in these regions of the
  components of two conjugation cascades that mediate formation and elongation of
  the autophagosome membrane. The major negative regulator of macroautophagy, the
  mTOR protein kinase complex, is also depicted. (B) Microautophagy mediates the internalization
  of cytosolic cargo – proteins and organelles – through invaginations of the lysosomal
  membrane. The molecular components that participate in this autophagic process in
  mammals remain unknown. (C) Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) differs from the
  other autophagic pathways on the fact that substrates – only soluble cytosolic proteins
  – are selectively targeted to the lysosomal membrane by a cytosolic chaperone and
  they require unfolding before reaching the lysosomal lumen. Internalization of substrate
  proteins by this pathway is attained through the coordinated function of chaperones
  at both sides of the lysosomal membrane and a membrane protein (the lysosome-associated
  membrane protein type 2A or LAMP-2A) that acts both as a receptor and as an essential
  component of the translocation complex.
