caption: 'The tumor microenvironment (TME). This overview summarizes the intricate
  interactions of the different cells types that constitute the tumor mass. Some cancer
  cells (CC: orange) use glycolysis as main source for energy production (independently
  of oxygen availability—Warburg effect), excreting lactate and leading to acidification
  of the surrounding area, which finally promotes invasiveness of CC. Other CCs as
  well as M2 macrophages (blue) and endothelial cells (ECs: pink) with access to adequate
  levels of oxygen use this lactate for oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). Lactate
  in ECs leads to inhibition of PHD and subsequent activation of HIF, enhancing expression
  of VEGF-Rs (among others) and promoting angiogenesis. Uptake of fatty acids (FA)
  as well as de novo synthesis is used for new biomass required for fast CC proliferation.
  Next to amino acid depletion in the tumor mass by M2 cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts
  (CAF: brown) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs: purple) establish a metabolic
  competition between pro- and anti-tumor forces present in the TME. The absence of
  nutrients needed for T effector cell activation (Teff: light green) leads to their
  anergy, with a differentiation shift toward T regulatory cells (Treg: dark green).
  The lack of nutrients leads to activation of the mTOR pathway in CCs and production
  of VEGF (among others) via HIF regulation, promoting angiogenesis.'
