caption: The biosynthetic pathway of several different deoxyhexoses originating from
  the same 4-keto-6-deoxy intermediate. GMD converts GDP-d-mannose to the common intermediate,
  which undergoes reduction, epimerization, or amination, resulting in a variety of
  deoxy sugars.

  bacterial GDP-d-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway.
