caption: The signal transduction of GDF11. The figure displays the canonical signal
  transduction mediated by R-SMAD (SMAD 2/3, SMAD 1,5,8), assisted by the Co-SMAD
  (SMAD4). The signal could inhibited by inhibitory SMAD (I-SMAD) 6 or 7 or by the
  SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (SMURF). Extracellularly, GDF11 could
  be inhibited by the BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI), or the action
  of proteins such as Follistatin, Decorin, and GDF-associated serum protein-1 (GASP-1)
  and GASP-2. The non-canonical pathway is driven particularly by the Mitogen Activated
  Proteins Kinases (MAPK), signaling continues to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated
  factor (TRAF) 2 or 6; and TGF-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which in addition uses
  the TAK1 binding protein (TAB) 1 and one of both 2 or 3. Non-canonical regulation
  could influence the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) among others, and the inhibition
  of this pathway could be blocked by protein phosphatases (PP).
