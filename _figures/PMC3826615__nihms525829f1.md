caption: Schematic model of the TGF-β-induced post-translational modifications of
  Fli1. In quiescent fibroblasts, collagen gene expression is repressed by Fli1 occupancy
  of the collagen promoter. In response to TGF-β stimulation, PKC-δ is translocated
  into the nucleus and recruited to the COL1A2 promoter leading to phosphorylation
  of Fli1 at threonine 312. Phosphorylation of Fli1 is required for the subsequent
  PCAF-mediated acetylation of Fli1 at lysine 380. Acetylated Fli1 dissociates from
  the collagen promoter and is rapidly degraded through the proteasomal pathway, thereby
  enhancing collagen gene transcription.
