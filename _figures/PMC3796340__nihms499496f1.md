number: Figure 1
caption: The figure depicts the glycolytic pathway from glucose entry into cells through
  production of pyruvate, which is converted either to lactate or to acetyl coA for
  entry into the TCA cycle. Movement of metabolic intermediates through the pathway
  is designated by arrows. Enzymes in the glycolytic pathway are placed next to the
  arrow leading from their substrate to their product. Inhibitors of glycolytic enzymes
  or glucose transporters appear in boxes.
