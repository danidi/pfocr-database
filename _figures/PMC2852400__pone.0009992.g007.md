caption: The CDKN2A locus codes for the tumor suppressors p16 and ARF that regulate
  cell cycle progression, DNA repair and cell invasion via activating pRb, and the
  p53 pathway via inhibiting the activity of MDM2, respectively. Mutations or deletions
  of the CDKN2A gene result in altered MMPs/TIMPs and/or uPA/uPAR/PAI-1 expression
  and activity, which in turn lead to tumor cell invasion. The Ras gene is important
  for regulating the ERK activity, and hence expression of MMPs and uPA/uPAR. An activating
  mutation in the Ras gene can result in uncontrolled activity of MMPs and the urokinase
  system, which can lead to increased melanoma invasion. Blockade of PCs activity
  can reduce the expression and/or generation of active MMPs, uPA and uPAR leading
  to reduced tumor cells invasiveness. The asterisks indicate altered genes.
