caption: A cartoon representation of the proposed PKG-induced signaling pathway that
  modulates neuronal KATP channel function. Reagents used in our studies to manipulate
  individual signaling components are depicted, with inhibitors positioned at left
  and activators at right. Our findings suggest that PKG enhances the function of
  neuronal KATP channels in intact cells by activating the 5-HD-sensitive factor(s)
  and subsequent generation of ROS in a SUR1 subunit-dependent manner; moreover, the
  stimulatory effect of PKG can be reproduced by NO induction or exogenous H2O2. Furthermore,
  Ca2+/calmodulin activities are required for PKG and H2O2 to stimulate neuronal-type
  KATP channels. In addition to the stimulatory effect, H2O2 also exerts an (milder)
  inhibitory action on the KATP channel by direct modification of the Kir6.2 subunit
  or some closely associated protein(s). Like PKG (), the predominating effect of
  ROS/H2O2 on neuronal KATP channels in intact cells is stimulatory. This novel NO/cGMP/PKG/5-HD-sensitive
  factor/ROS/Ca2+/calmodulin signaling pathway may contribute to the regulation of
  neuronal excitability, neurotransmitter release, and neuroprotection under ischemic
  or metabolic stress, by functionally modulating neuronal KATP channels.
