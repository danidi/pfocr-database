caption: 'Schematic diagram of anti-metastatic mechanisms of herbal medicine in gastric
  cancer: When it comes to ROS, it has double-edged aspects in anti-tumor efficacy
  and mechanisms. Therefore, there are also two opposite ways that natural antioxidants
  utilize ROS as part of anti-metastatic process. First of all, ROS is predominantly
  generated by NOX as an early response to phagocytosis-mediated microbicidal activity
  of neutrophils. There exists a complicated enzymatic cascade of NOX, protein-arginine
  deiminase 4 (PAD4), neutrophil elastase (NE) and MPO which plays a crucial role
  in triggering sequential generation of neutrophil extracellular traps formation
  (NETosis) for circulating tumor cells and metastasis. Natural antioxidants might
  be applied as an effective antitumor agent in preventing early phase of NETs as
  a result of ROS. In contrast, herbal medicine can promote ferroptosis by maximizing
  ROS. Abbreviated expressions of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and cystine/glutamate
  antiporter (xCT), inducing the ROS accumulation in human gastric cancer (HGC) cells
  27, finally aggravate the ferroptosis of cancer cells. Furthermore, herbal medicine
  can inactivate the metastasis related process. TGF-β activates the Smad signaling
  pathway, which shares a common EMT pathway. SDF-1 and FN proteins are key factors
  in pre-metastatic niche formation in the lung, which lead to Cdc42 and Rac-1 expression.
  Besides, herbal medicines stimulate cancer cell apoptosis related processes. For
  instance, PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway is related to potential mechanisms for
  proliferation and apoptosis. Executive caspase-3, which is activated by up-regulated
  Bax or down-regulated Bcl-2, can also induce apoptosis. Abbreviation: ACP, Actinidia
