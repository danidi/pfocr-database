caption: Schematic representation of the normal immune response and the different
  steps where M. tuberculosis intervenes. The Th1 immune response to M. tuberculosis
  is central to immunity to the pathogen, and the IFN-γ and IL-12 pathway stimulated
  by proinflammatory factors induced by mycobacterial cell wall lipids is essential
  for macrophage activation, resulting in lysosome maturation and bacterial killing.
  M. tuberculosis counteracts this by manipulating the cytokine response through induction
  of inhibitory Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), affecting production of IL-12 themselves,
  and by modulating the activity of receptor-associated transcription factors such
  as Stat1. The immune response is also modulated by factors that interfere with antigen-specific
  responses (by either blocking presentation of antigen or, conversely, promoting
  immune responses to nonprotective antigens). At the same time, M. tuberculosis deploys
  an impressive armory of genes to interfere with phagocytosis and lysozyme maturation
  and function of antigen-presenting cells.
