caption: Models for FLO11 action in the filamentous growth pathway. (A) In the filamentous
  signaling pathway Flo11p functions downstream of Ste12p and is the primary target
  of Ste12p to effect invasion. (B) The FLO11 promoter region contains a filamentous
  response element (FRE), a site for the cooperative binding of the proteins Ste12p
  and Tec1p which transcriptionally activate genes during the filamentous response
  ().
