caption: Proposed pathway for repair of uracil-MsmUdgX complexes. Binding of MsmUdgX
  to uracil would stall replication which could in turn lead to generation of single
  stranded gaps or double stranded breaks. Activation of RecA protein upon binding
  to ss DNA would induce the SOS response through cleavage of LexA. RecBCD proteins
  would also repair the complex through homologous recombination repair pathway.
