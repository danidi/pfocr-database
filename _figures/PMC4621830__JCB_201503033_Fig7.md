caption: The working model. Several signaling molecules including Dpp, Hh, and Upd
  are expressed in the GSC niche. Whereas cap cell–expressed Dpp acts directly on
  GSCs to promote self-renewal (thick black arrow), cap cell–derived Upd activates
  the JAK/STAT pathway in ECs to promote low levels of Dpp expression in these cells
  (green arrow), and this EC-expressed Dpp functions to maintain a population of partially
  differentiated germline cells, including CBs (thin black arrow). In contrast, Hh
  signaling in the ECs dampens Dpp expression by antagonizing JAK/STAT signaling probably
  through the binding of Ci to Stat92e and influence its nuclear localization.
