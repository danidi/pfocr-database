caption: Targeted proteomics analysis of experimental rat glaucoma. As an effort to
  explore specific protein interactions in an experimental rat model of glaucoma,
  14-3-3-containing retinal protein complexes were eluted using co-immunoprecipitation
  and recombinant protein-based affinity pull-down for subsequent analysis by mass
  spectrometry. Based on the proteomics data and in vivo treatment experiments in
  rats, 14-3-3 proteins were found to control the subcellular localization of and
  function of Bad in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and thereby constitute an
  important regulatory pathway of RGC death signaling during glaucomatous neurodegeneration.
  This flow diagram has recently been published ().
