caption: ROS contribute to ICAM-1 and PD-L1 induction in salivary gland epithelial
  cells through a JAK(1/)2/STAT3 pathway. ICAM-1 upregulation leads to SGEC activation
  and induces lymphocytic infiltration. PD-L1 reduces T-cell activation and IFNγ production
  on one hand but, on the other hand, contributes to SGECs activation and disease
  perpetuation as it increases salivary gland epithelial cell survival and reduces
  pro-inflammatory TH1 cell-mediated activation and toxicity. JAK(1/)2 inhibitors,
  AG490 and ruxolitinib, as well as NAC reverse this process as described in . IFN(α/γ),
  interferon α/γ, ICAM-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1; PD-L1, programmed death
  ligand 1; TH1, T helper 1 lymphocyte; ROS, reactive oxygen species; H2O2, hydrogen
  peroxide; TYK, tyrosine kinase; JAK, janus kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator
  of transcription.
