caption: Overview of the cell‐intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The cell‐intrinsic or
  mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is regulated by the BCL2 protein family. Prosurvival
  proteins represented here by BCL2 (but also including BCL‐W, BCL‐XL, MCL1 and A1)
  bind to and inhibit the proapoptotic effector proteins BAX and BAK. BH3‐only proteins
  (BOPs), represented here by BIM, are upregulated or activated in response to various
  stresses (growth factor withdrawal, DNA damage, etc). All BOPs can bind to and inhibit
  a subset of the prosurvival proteins, thereby releasing BAX and BAK to undergo further
  activation steps including oligomerisation in the outer mitochondrial membrane;
  this results in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilisation (MOMP) and release
  of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space. Cytochrome c binds to APAF1 inducing
  conformational changes that result in the assembly of the heptameric apoptosome,
  which serves as a platform for activation of the initiator caspase, caspase‐9. Caspase‐9
  then cleaves effector caspases such as caspase‐3 and caspase‐7, which in turn cleave
  a large number of proteins within the cell to drive apoptosis. Note that some BOPs
  (‘activators’, such as BIM and BID), may also bind directly to BAX/BAK to promote
  their activation. Other BOPs (such as BAD or BIK) are not strong activators of BAX/BAK
  but can liberate activator BOPs from prosurvival protein‐mediated repression. See
  text for details.
