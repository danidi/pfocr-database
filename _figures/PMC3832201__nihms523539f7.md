caption: '(A) and (B), Signaling pathway and mechanism of chemotactic responses to
  attractant (Att) and repellent (Rep) in bacteria and archaea. The model is based

  see the text. CheW (W): signal transduction protein connecting the MCP signal generation
  with the CheA (A) sensor kinase to control its activity. CheA phosphorylates CheY
  (Y), and CheY phosphorylation determines the direction of flagellar rotation during
  activation by binding to the basal region of the flagellum, FliM(NFG). CheR (R)
  is the methylating S-adenosyl methionine:MCP methyltransferase while CheB (B) is
  the MCP methylesterase, both involved in adaptation (see also ) [see ;  for reviews
  and comparative analyses]. CheB is phosphorylated, and thereby activated, by CheA
  in a slow step. CheB catalyzes deamidation, converting certain glutamines (Gln)
  to glutamates (Glu) so they can be methylated by CheR. Minus Att, weaker interactions
  are observed between intersubunit periplasmic domains and intersubunit cytoplasmic
  domains as compared with when Att is present. Subunit exchange occurs – Att but
  not + Att. Almost all amino acid replacements in TMS1 → CCW; i.e., weaker TM1:TM2
  interactions, stronger intersubunit interactions, and poorer signaling. Intrasubunit
  movements (TM1 relative to TM2) may initiate signaling, i.e., Att binding → relative
  displacement of the two TMs in the membrane. CheZ is a CheY-P phosphatase. (C) Schematized
