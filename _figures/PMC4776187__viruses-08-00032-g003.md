caption: Modes of action of lipids in enterovirus replication. (A) The processes of
  lipid signal transduction regulated by enteroviruses. Class I PI3Ks and their downstream
  product PI(3,4,5)P3 regulate mTORC1 signals. The phosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 via
  PI3K activates the AKT signaling pathway. AKT blocks the inhibitory effect of TSC1-TSC2
  complex on Rheb. Activated Rheb in turn promotes mTORC1 complex signaling. Rapamycin
  inhibits the mTORC1 complex (violet T arrow) and further enhances production of
  enteroviruses, which also have an inhibitory effect on mTORC1 (grey T arrow). 3-MA
  inhibits the class I PI3K and shuts off its downstream signaling (violet T arrow);
  (B) Picornaviruses recruit PI3P effectors (grey arrow) to the outer membranes of
  autophagosomes. PI3P lipids on autophagosome membranes directly interact with PI3P
  effectors to induce signals for membrane budding, membrane fusion, and vesicular
  transport of autophagosomes; 3-MA inhibits the recruitment of PI3P effectors to
  PI3P lipids (violet T arrow); (C) Enteroviruses recruit PI4KIIIβ (grey arrow) via
  Golgi-localized host factors, resulting in an increase of PI4P lipids. These lipids
  are commonly found to localize on autolysosome membranes and are converted to PI(4,5)P2
  by PIP5K for autophagic lysosome reformation. Enviroxime inhibits PI4KIIIβ and itraconazole
  inhibits cholesterol and PI4P transfers (violet T arrow).
