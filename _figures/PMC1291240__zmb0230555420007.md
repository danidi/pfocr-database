caption: Model of CENP-50 function in the centromere. When cells progress through
  the cell cycle without problems, CENP-50 is dispensable for chromosome segregation.
  However, when problems such as spindle abnormalities or kinetochore defects occur
  during mitosis, cell cycle progression is arrested due to activation of a mitotic
  checkpoint pathway. At this point, CENP-50 promotes sister chromatid adhesion and
  prevents premature sister chromatid separation. We propose that CENP-50 functions
  as a backup mechanism to prevent chromosome abnormalities during delay due to activation
  of mitotic checkpoints. If this backup system is disrupted, the cells remain in
  mitosis for a prolonged period and eventually die.
