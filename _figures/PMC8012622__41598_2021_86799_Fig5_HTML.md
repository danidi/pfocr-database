caption: 'Formation pathway of cytoskeleton structure by F-actin. Filamentous actin
  is the major cytoskeletal protein in the cell, and there are three main structures
  formed by F-actin within a cell: filopodia, lamellipodia, and stress fiber. The
  Rho GTPases Cdc42, Rac1, RhoA are key elements in the regulation of actin filaments.
  Cdc42 and Rac1 induce actin polymerization through the WASP/WAVE family members,
  which are respectively involved in the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia by
  stimulating the Arp2/3 complex downstream. Stress fiber assembly is predominantly
  regulated by RhoA in the formin-mediated pathway.'
