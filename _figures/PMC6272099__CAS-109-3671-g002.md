caption: Metabolism of sphingolipids. S1P is generated from sphingosine by sphingosine
  kinases (SphK) in the Catabolic pathway. SphK1 mainly exists in the cytosol and
  SphK2 exists in the nuclei and mitochondria. Ceramide is generated from sphingomyelin
  by sphingomyelinases (SMase) in the Sphingomyelin pathway, generated from dihydro‐ceramide
  by ceramide desaturase (DES) in the De novo pathway, and generated from sphingosine
  produced in the Salvage and the Catabolic pathways. A‐SMase, acid sphingomyelinase;
  C1P, ceramide‐1‐phosphate; C1PP, ceramide‐1‐phosphate phosphatase; CDase, ceramidase;
  CK, ceramide kinase; CS, ceramide synthase; DES, ceramide desaturase; KDS, keto‐dihydro‐sphingosine;
  S1P, sphingosine‐1‐phosphate; SM synthase, sphingomyelin synthase; SMase, sphingomyelinase;
  SphK, sphingosine kinase; SPP, sphingosine phosphatase; SPT, serine palmitoyl transferase
