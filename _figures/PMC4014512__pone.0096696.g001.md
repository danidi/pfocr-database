caption: Na+-NQR catalyzes the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, which
  under physiological conditions is irreversible, and uses the free energy released
  by the redox reaction to pump sodium –. On the other hand, in most bacterial phyla
  RNF catalyzes the transfer of electrons between NADH and ferredoxin, which can be
  reversible depending on the metabolic adaptations of the bacteria , . However, the
  evidence indicates that RNF can also catalyze the reduction the transcriptional
  regulatory protein SoxR , which controls the expression of proteins involved in
  reactive oxygen species handling. In contrast with Na+-NQR, which is specific for
  sodium , the RNF complex might use sodium and protons . The pathway for electron
  transport in Na+-NQR is shown in the yellow lines , as well as the proposed pathway
  for RNF . Ubiquinone is a hydrophobic molecule located in the plasma membrane of
  bacteria. It has been demonstrated previously that the reduction of this compound
  occurs in the cytosolic face of the membrane , but for illustrative purposes it
  is shown on the bottom of the figure.
