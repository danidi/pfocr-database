caption: Regulation of antioxidant production by HIF-1. Under hypoxic conditions,
  HIFs activate the transcription of PHGDH, PSAT1, and PSPH (red) to increase conversion
  of glucose to serine (serine synthesis pathway); and SHMT2, MTHFD2, and MTHFD1L
  (purple) to increase generation of mitochondrial NADPH (by mitochondrial one-carbon
  metabolism), which is required to convert glutathione from oxidized (GSSG) to reduced
  (GSH) form to protect against increased ROS generated by the ETC. Under hypoxic
  conditions, HIFs also activate the transcription of SLC7A11 and GCLM (green) to
  increase glutathione production. (For interpretation of the references to color
  in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
