caption: Metabolic function of LuxS. Methionine recycling, methylation of DNA and
  proteins as well asde novocysteine synthesis is affected by the ACM. The SAM-synthetase
  MetK converts methionine to S-adenosylmethione (SAM). The cleavage of methyl residues
  from SAM results in the formation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which can be
  converted to homocysteine either in a one- or two-step reaction. The SAH-hydrolase
  metabolises SAH to adenosine and homocysteine in a one-step reaction. In the other
  pathway, Pfs cleaves SAH into adenine and S-ribosylhomocysteine (SRH), which in
  turn is cleaved into 4,5-dihydroxyl-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) and homocysteine by LuxS.
  Homocysteine can be converted to methionine by the methyltransferase (MetE or MetH)
  or to cystathione and further cysteine by the enzymes CysK and MetB.
