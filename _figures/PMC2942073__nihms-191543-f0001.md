caption: 'Genes may modify the neurodegenerative process to result in the expression
  of psychosis in AD (Pathway A1). Some of these genes may similarly impact the neurodegenerative
  process in other diseases (Pathway A2). Modifier genes may also interact with environmentally
  or genetically driven abnormalities of neurodevelopment (e.g. velocardiofacial syndrome)
  or with normal neurodevelopmental processes (e.g. synaptic pruning during adolescence)
  resulting in an early life psychosis such as schizophrenia (Pathway A3). Three possible
  disease modifier genes are shown (CHRNA7, COMT, NRG1) based on data suggesting a
  role for each in the onset of schizophrenia and preliminary findings in AD+P (see
  text for more complete review of the evidence). Alternatively in Pathway B, there
  may be genes that predispose to the development of a subtype of Alzheimer disease
  in which psychotic symptoms are manifest. Two genes associated with increased risk
  for late-onset AD, APOE and SORL1, are shown. Available evidence, while subject
  to limitations reviewed in the text, does not support a role for APOE in AD+P development.
  SORL1 has not been studied.APOE: Apolipoprotein E; CHRNA7: α7 nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptor gene; COMT: Cathechol-O-methyltransferase; NRG1: Neuregulin-1; SORL1: Sortilin-related
