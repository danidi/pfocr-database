caption: 'Aberrant activation of alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) in lung fibrosis.
  (a) Recapitulation of the developmental pathway of AECs in lung fibrosis: (1) Wnt/β
  signaling: type II AEC (AEC II) and fibroblast isolated from idiopathic pulmonary
  fibrosis (IPF) patients overexpress the members of the Wnt/wingless pathway and
  exhibit excessive nuclear accumulations of β-catenin. Several Wnt ligands render
  fibroblasts more active. WNT1-inducible signaling protein-1 (WISP1) is upregulated
  in AEC II in both a murine bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis model and IPF lungs.
  WISP1 activates AEC II and fibroblasts. Depletion of WISP1 attenuates bleomycin-induced
  lung fibrosis in mice. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin/CREB binding protein (CBP) also
  ameliorates lung fibrosis of bleomycin-treated mice. (2) Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling:
  a high expression of Shh protein is seen in the epithelial cells lining honeycomb
  cysts in lungs affected by IPF. TGF-β induced Shh expression in cultured murine
  AECs, whereas Shh induced TGF-β and alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression
  in cultured murine lung fibroblasts. (b) Defect of molecules essential for epithelial
  integrity: (1) Shp2: AEC-specific deletion of Shp2 in mice induces deregulated surfactant
  homeostasis, increased AEC II apoptosis, and spontaneous inflammation-independent
  lung fibrosis. (2) CD151: tetraspanin CD151 is expressed at the basolateral surface
  of AECs and is important in maintaining AEC integrity via rigid adhesion to the
  basement membrane (BM). CD151-deleted cultured AECs show attenuated adhesion on
  the BM. CD151-KO mice exhibit spontaneous age-related lung fibrosis. (c) Acceleration
  of aging-related properties: (1) cell biological characteristics of aging in the
  IPF lungs and (2) PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1). AEC II in IPF lungs exhibits
  marked accumulation of dysmorphic and dysfunctional mitochondria, defective autophagy,
  and decreased PINK1 expression. Lung epithelial cell-specific PINK1-deleted mice
  show dysmorphic and dysfunctional mitochondria and vulnerability to apoptosis. PINK1
  KO mice also show increased susceptibility to lung fibrosis after both MHV68 (a
  murine gammaherpesvirus homologous to EBV) infection and bleomycin treatment. EMT:
  epithelial mesenchymal transition; ECM: extracellular matrix; TCF: T-cell factor.'
