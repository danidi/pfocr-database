caption: Lipid metabolism regulatory network proposed for the breast of female chickens
  at hatching, based on significant DEGs and KEGG pathway analysis. The network involves
  Hedgehog, TGF-beta, and cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathways,
  through SHH, BMP, and LEPR molecular interactions. These three pathways potentially
  regulate lipid metabolism via the PPAR signaling pathway
