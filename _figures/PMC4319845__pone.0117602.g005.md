caption: PC, resveratrol, and emodin enter the influenza-infected cell and then activate
  proinflammatory cytokines through TLR9. TLR9 signals through the adapter protein
  myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88), leading to the activation
  of two different pathways. PC, resveratrol, and emodin likely activate interferon
  regulator factor 7 (IRF7) pathway rather than the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway,
  leading to the activation of type I IFN genes through the phosphorylation of IRF7
  and the transcriptional activation of proinflammatory cytokines.
