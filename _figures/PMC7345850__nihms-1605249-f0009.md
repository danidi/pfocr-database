caption: 'Left panel: Balanced autophagic flux. Rab5-positive early endosomes are
  the initial sorting station of the endocytic pathway. Normally, endocytic cargoes
  are either recycled to the cell surface or degraded via lysosomes. Rab5-positive
  early endosomes mature into late endosomes through a process called ‘Rab conversion’.
  Late endosomes, containing cargo from early endosomes, acquire newly synthesized
  lysosomal hydrolases and continue to mature and may eventually fuse with lysosomes.
  The resultant endolysosome matures into a classical highly acidic lysosome containing
  Lamp1 and the hydrolases and proteases necessary for degradation. Autophagosomes,
  the major cargo vesicle for macroautophagy, also traffic cargo to the lysosome for
  degradation, thereby forming an autolysosome. Under normal cellular homeostasis,
  endolysosomal function and autophagic flux are ‘balanced’.Middle panel: Acute rotenone
  dosing causes selective endolysosomal defects. Rotenone causes oxidative stress
  and activates LRRK2, and the resultant increase in LRRK2 kinase activity leads to
  phosphorylation of Rab10 and accumulation of swollen, Rab5-positive early endosomes.
  The apparent failure of Rab5-positive early endosomes to mature properly decreases
  the number of late endosomes and lysosomes, which likely impairs degradation and
  likely explains the accumulation of α-synuclein. At this stage, autophagosomes,
  labeled with p62 are unaffected.Right panel: Combined endolysosomal and autophagic
  deficits in endpoint rotenone and iPD. With continued cellular stress (mitochondrial
  impairment and LRRK2 activation), the endolysosomal deficits persist and worsen,
  and there are eventually fewer lysosomes with which autophagosome can fuse. As a
  result, p62-positive autophagosomes accumulate. Additionally, the finding of extra-lysosomal
  cathepsin D suggests that lysosomal integrity may be compromised. At this stage,
  there is ongoing neurodegeneration and depletion of dopamine neurons.'
