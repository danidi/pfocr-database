caption: Schematic of crosstalk between the TNF-related pathway and CS response. TNFRSF10A
  is involved in inducing apoptosis, but also in suppressing inflammation, reducing
  pro-inflammation cytokines. As a possible underlining mechanism, TNFRSF10A can reduce
  the apoptotic effect of CS, via IRES elements, maintaining the anti-inflammatory
  action and potentially conferring a better CS response to HR patients. CS, Corticosteroids;
  GR, Glucocorticoid Receptor; IRES, Internal Ribosome Entry Site; CYT, Cytokines;
  TNF, Tumor Necrosis Factor; HSP, Heat Shock Protein; FADD, FAS-associated Death
  Domain-containing protein (circuit used by CS).
