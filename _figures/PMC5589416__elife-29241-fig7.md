caption: 'Before onset of myelination, high activity of the pathway inhibits the differentiation
  of SCs by negatively regulating Krox20 transcription via S6K. After SCs have started
  myelinating, mTORC1 and Akt synergize to promote myelin growth: mTORC1 enhances
  lipid synthesis, while Akt, additionally to activating mTORC1, is likely to drive
  membrane wrapping largely independent of mTORC1.'
