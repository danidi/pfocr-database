caption: The anaerobic biosynthesis of adenosylcobyric acid from uroporphyrinogen
  III. The aerobic pathway starts with the synthesis of sirohydrochlorin, which is
  sometimes also referred to as Factor II. Metal insertion at this stage generates
  cobalt-sirohydrochlorin, which then undergoes a further methylation at C20 to give
  cobalt-factor III. Ring contraction is mediated by CbiH, which forms a δ-lactone
  in the generation of cobalt-precorrin-4. Further methylations coupled with lactone
  ring opening and rearrangement give rise to cobyrinic acid. Amidations together
  with adenosylation ultimately give rise to the formation of adenosylcobyric acid.
  The shaded box surrounding uroporphyrinogen III coordinates with other pathway figures
  and the summary in .
