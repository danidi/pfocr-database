caption: Flow chart of the DARPP-32-CaN pathway in the Cys311 variant of DRD2. The
  disturbance of DRD2 desensitization can prolong dopamine-induced DRD2-mediated signaling
  and accelerate the following processes; PLC activation, IP3 release, and Ca2+ release
  from the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, increased intracellular Ca2+ activates
  CaN. The activated CaN can then promote PP1 activation through the dephosphorylation
  of DARPP-32. Dephosphorylation of CREB may then be promoted in the brains carrying
  the Cys311 variant of DRD2. Since the ChIP analysis showed that CREB binds upstream
  of several CaN genes, dephosphorylation of CREB may decrease CaN expression. DRD2,
