caption: The effects of thyroid hormones on the activity and expression level of eNOS
  in vascular endothelial cells. Thyroxin (T4) is converted to its active form triiodothyronine
  (T3) by deiodinase 2 (Dio2). A rapid non-genomic action of thyroid hormones can
  occur upon binding T3 to the TRα and/or T4 to integrin receptors, which both can
  activate the PI3/Akt-kinase signaling pathway, causing phosphorylation at the serine-1177
  site and activation of eNOS. The long-term genomic effects of thyroid hormones occur
  upon binding of T3 to TRα receptors, which triggers expression of eNOS mRNA.
