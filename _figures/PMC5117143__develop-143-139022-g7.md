caption: ATR is required to maintain G2/M checkpoint integrity and prevent apoptosis
  induced by proliferation-associated DNA damage. (A) CGNPs proliferate in the postnatal
  cerebellum, generating DNA damage (lightning bolt) from endogenous processes, which
  stalls replication forks. ATR is recruited by replication protein A (RPA), which
  binds single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks. Activated ATR initiates
  checkpoint arrest, promoting DNA repair with minimal engagement of the p53 pathway.
  (B) ATR loss prolongs replication fork stalling across the CGNP genome, which degenerates
  into widespread DSBs that are sensed by ATM. Resultant p53 activation triggers apoptosis
  through BAX/BAK and caspase 3 (C-3) due to overwhelming DNA damage, with some concurrent
  activation of p21 and cell cycle arrest. G2/M checkpoint failure from ATR absence
  allows CGNPs with DNA damage to enter mitosis, incurring chromosomal abnormalities;
  however, apoptosis removes cells with aberrant chromosomes. (C) Co-deletion of Bax
  and Bak in ATR-deficient CGNPs prevents apoptosis. Instead, cells with DNA damage
  and p53 activation are driven to p21-mediated cell cycle exit, attenuating CGNP
  proliferation over time. However, cells that escape arrest then inappropriately
  enter mitosis and experience chromosome damage, which accumulates due to apoptotic
  failure. (D) In Atr;p53M-cre CGNPs, DSBs from collapsed replication forks accumulate
  and propagate due to the inability to undergo both ATR-mediated G2/M arrest and
  p53-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Excessive DNA damage triggers an as
  yet unidentified form of non-apoptotic cell death.
