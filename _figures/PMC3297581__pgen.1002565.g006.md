caption: The network involved in HSC establishment and development (red nodes), cell
  growth control (blue nodes) and multipotency (orange nodes) was identified among
  up-regulated genes in CD34+ cells (>2 fold) and displayed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  software (IPA). Gray lines are IPA annotated relations based on the literature.
  Pink lines indicate TCF7 or RUNX1 binding to gene targets that were identified by
  our ChIP-Seq experiments. The shades of green color of the nodes in the network
  indicate the level of up-regulation in CD34+ cells. Sox4, Mpo, Tal1 and Ppard were
  TCF7 binding targets that were added to the network manually because of their obvious
  interesting function in hematopoiesis and self-renewal. All other nodes were from
  default IPA analysis. Direct relations were indicated by solid line or arrows. Indirect
  relations were indicated by dotted line. Please see Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software
  (IPA https://analysis.ingenuity.com/) Online Help section for detailed definitions.
