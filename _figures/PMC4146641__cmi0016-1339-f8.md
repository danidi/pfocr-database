caption: Working model of S. Typhimurium regulation of 12-LOX expression/activity
  and HXA3synthesis during infection. Infection of intestinal epithelial cells with
  Salmonella Typhimurium induces an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production,
  which induces a decrease in GPX4 expression and total cell GPX activity. Treatment
  of intestinal epithelial cells with the S. Typhimurium effector protein SipA also
  directly decreased GPX4 expression (dotted lines) through mechanisms yet to be elucidated.
  The decrease in GPX4 expression and activity results in the accumulation of phospholipid
  hydroperoxides thereby activating the 12-LOX pathway. Furthermore, S. Typhimurium
  infection also induces an increase in the expression of 12-LOX. These two events
  (decrease in GPX activity/expression and increase in 12-LOX expression) culminate
  in the activation of the 12-LOX pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism leading to
  the synthesis of HXA3. Synthesized HXA3 is then effluxed across the intestinal epithelial
  cell membrane by MRP2. Once in the lumen, HXA3 induces transepithelial migration
  of neutrophils. PLA2 is involved in the release of arachidonic acid from the cell
  membrane. AA = arachidonic acid, ROS = reactive oxygen species, PLA2 = phospholipase
  A2, HXA3 = hepoxilin A3, IL-8 = interleuken 8, MRP2 = multidrug resistant associated
  protein 2.
