caption: TSP1 in adipose metabolism and obesity. TSP1 activates the latent form of
  transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFβ1), consequently promoting the recruitment
  of leukocytes, the influx of macrophages to the adipose tissue, and the release
  of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines. TGFβ1 will also contribute to fibrosis
  of adipose tissues by inducing the transcription of pro-fibrotic genes. By interacting
  with TSP1, CD47 suppresses the mitochondrial metabolism in brown adipose cells,
  therefore exhibiting a pro-obesity effect. TSP1 interacts with the hormone leptin
  by activating the JAK/STATs pathway. Increased plasma levels of leptin are correlated
  with high body fatness. The dashed arrow indicates a probable but yet unexplained
  association with obesity. CD36 facilitates the uptake of free fatty acids (FFA)
  into adipose cells, but it can also promote the apoptosis of endothelial cells,
  decreasing angiogenesis. Perhaps, this could contribute to the lower vascularization
  observed in white adipose tissues during the progression of this condition (dashed
  arrow). Finally, CD36 can regulate adipogenesis and expansion of adipose cells by
  activating the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling.
