caption: a | Normal transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signalling in TGFβ-responsive
  cells (blue cells) feeds through the type 2 TGFβ receptor (TGFBR2) to activate downstream
  signalling targets. Canonical signalling is activated through phosphorylation of
  TGFBR1 to induce nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of SMADs. Non-canonical
  signalling can occur independently of SMAD proteins and includes activation of RHOA,
  AKT and MAPK pathways. Early in tumorigenesis, TGFβ functions as a tumour suppressor,
  partly through the SMAD-dependent induction of cell cycle arrest. b | One hypothesis
  is that selective pressure leads to the expansion of the population of tumour cells
  that harbour inactivating mutations in the TGFβ pathway, thus allowing them to overcome
  the growth-inhibitory effects of active TGFβ signalling. As outlined by Levy et
  al., loss of TGFβ responsiveness (green cells) can occur through loss-of-function
  mutations, loss of expression or promoter methylation of genes (shown by the grey
  circles) that encode TGFβ receptors or SMADs. JNK, JUN N-terminal kinase; mTOR,
  mammalian target of rapamycin; PAR6, partitioning defective 6 homologue; ROCK1,
  RHO-associated protein kinase 1; RSMAD, receptor SMAD; SBE, SMAD-binding element.
