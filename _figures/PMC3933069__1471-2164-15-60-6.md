caption: 'A model of development of Spirodela dormancy through the signal transduction
  in response to environmental stimuli. Phosphorylated proteins are labeled as pink
  circles with a P inside. Solid lines represent direct connections. The dotted line
  indicates indirect connection. Not all linkages and details of pathway are shown
  in this diagram in order to simplify the model. Abbreviations: ABA (abscisic acid),
  CPK (calcium-dependent protein kinase), MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase),
  ABF (ABA-responsive element binding factor), ERF (ethylene-responsive element binding
  factor), HSF (heat shock transcription factor), WRKY (WRKY transcription factors),
  ABRE (ABA-responsive element), ERE (ethylene-responsive element).'
