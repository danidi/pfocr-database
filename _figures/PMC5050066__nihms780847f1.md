caption: The organogenesis pathway is strikingly analogous to the blue light-mediated
  phototropic response. Arabidopsis plants with compromised PIN1 or PID or NPY or
  ARF5/MP fail to produce flowers whereas mutations in PHOT1 or NPH3 or ARF7/NPH4
  cause defects in normal phototropic responses to blue light. PID is homologous to
  PHOT1 and NPYs are homologous to NPH3. Moreover, ARF5/MP is very similar to ARF7/NPH4.
  The starting point for phototropic response is the perception of light by the LOV
  domains in PHOT1. Light activates the kinase activity in PHOT1 and consequently
  phosphorylation status of NPH3 is altered. The role of ARF7/NPH4 in phototropism
  is not understood because phototropic response is generally believed to be non-genomic.
  PID lacks a receptor domain and we hypothesize that PIN proteins may function as
  an auxin receptor based on genetic evidences. The function of PIN/PID complex in
  the auxin-mediated organogenesis pathway is equivalent to PHOT1 in the phototropism
  pathway.
