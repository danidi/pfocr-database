caption: Suggested mechanism of EtSCT action in CCl4-induced hepatic injury. In this
  scheme, the protective effects of EtSCT are thought to be exerted via the suppression
  of hepatic apoptosis, inflammation, and liver fibrosis induced by CCl4 injection
  through the inhibition of lipid peroxidation and apoptosis in hepatocytes, the TNF-α
  signaling pathway in Kupffer cells, and the TGF-β signaling pathway in stellate
  cells.
