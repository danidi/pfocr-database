caption: 'Amino sugar metabolism, peptidoglycan synthesis and recycling, and the putative
  polymerization and secretion mechanisms involved in production of the chitin/chitosan-like
  bioflocculant. These pathways and mechanisms are depicted based on information obtained
  from published reports [,,,]. Blue arrows and gene names indicate the proposed BF
  synthetic pathway and genes, respectively. Abbreviations: BF, bioflocculant; GlcN,
  glucosamine; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid; P, phosphate;
  anh, anhydro.'
