caption: Visualization of the differential impact of compartmentalized cysteine oxidation
  events, as compared to diffuse oxidation events on signal transduction cascades.
  The left panel represents a hypothetical schematic illustrating the compartmentalized
  cysteine oxidation events, S1-Ox, and S2-Ox, following the localized activation
  of NOX or NOS, which lead to activation of regulator X, which in turn evokes response
  X. The panel on the right represents diverse intracellular cysteine oxidation events
  S1-Ox, S3-Ox, and S4-Ox that occur in response to extracellularly encountered H2O2
  or NO/SNO. This scenario leads to a different biological response (Z). Activation
  of Regulator X does not occur, because of lack of oxidation S2, and the oxidation
  of S3 which activates regulator Y, which in turn inhibits Pathway X. Instead, because
  of oxidation event S4, activation of regulator Z occurs, leading to activation of
  pathway Y, and response Z. The scenarios illustrated are strictly hypothetical.
