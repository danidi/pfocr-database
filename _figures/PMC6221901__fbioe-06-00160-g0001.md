caption: Biosynthesis of casbene in yeast and examples of casbene derived compounds.
  Schematic overview of casbene biosynthesis based on engineered mevalonate pathway
  in S. cerevisiae. The new biosynthetic branch starts with PaGGPPS, for production
  of GGPP using IPP and DMAPP as sole substrates. RcCBS mediates casbene synthesis
  (in red). Endogenous genes and metabolites are shown in black. Overexpressed genes
  are shown in blue. Genes regulated through dynamic control (ERG20 and ERG9) and
  genes from the steroid biosynthetic pathway are shown in gray. The truncated endogenous
  gene tHMG1 and the heterologous genes PaGGPPS (encoding a truncated version of the
  fusicoccadiene synthase from Phomopsis amygdali serving as GGPP synthase) and RcCBS
  (encoding a truncated version of the casbene synthase from Ricinus communis) were
  overexpressed to improve casbene production. The native promoter of ERG20 was replaced
  with PERG1 or PHXT1, respectively. The native promoter of ERG9 was replaced with
  PERG1. HMG-CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A; IPP, isopentenyl pyrophosphate;
  DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate; GPP, geranyl diphosphate; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate;
  GGPP, geranylgeranyl diphosphate.
