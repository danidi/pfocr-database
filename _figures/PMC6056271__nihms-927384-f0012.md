caption: Schematic representation of BTZ cellular uptake by normal and MM cells. (Left)
  Free BTZ penetrates into all cells by passive diffusion and preferentially inhibits
  the overexpressed proteasome in MM cells, even at a low drug concentration. (Right)
  BTZ-loaded anti-CD38 chitosan NPs bind to CD38+ MM cells, and BTZ can be released
  directly from the NPs attached to the surface or anti-CD38 NPs entered CD38+ MM
  cells via the endocytic pathway (inhibited by 4°C incubation). Clathrin- (inhibited
  by chlorpromazine, chlorp.), caveolae-mediated endocytosis (inhibited by nystatin)
  incorporated anti-CD38 chitosan NPs into early endosomes, which will be transformed
  into late endosomes (inhibited by EGA). Through both mechanisms BTZ is presented
  at a higher drug concentration to the proteasome based on higher availability of
  BTZ inside the cells through either diffusion from the anti-CD38 NPs that bind to
  the surface or the endocytosed anti-CD38 NPs.
