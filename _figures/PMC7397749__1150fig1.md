caption: 'Synthesis and metabolism of PUFAs. A: PUFA conversion from the essential
  fatty acids, LA and α-linolenic acid (ALA), by the indicated enzymes. FADS2 is proposed
  to desaturate other positions as well (), which is not depicted here. “XX:Yω-Z”
  illustrates a PUFA with XX carbons, Y double bonds, and the first double bond at
  the Zth carbon from the methyl end. Note the absence of inter-conversion between
  ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs. B: Synthesis of GPLs from glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P), and generation
  of lipid mediators thereof. Arrows with numbers illustrate steps where free fatty
  acids (FFAs) are generated (arrow 1, PLA2; arrow 2, TAG lipase; and arrow 3, MAG
  lipase), which can be further used to generate PUFA-derivatives. For simplicity,
  acyl-chain remodeling (Lands’ cycle) is illustrated only for PC and PI, but the
  pathway is functional for other GPLs as well. The LPLATs important for PUFA incorporation
  are illustrated. Although the presence of a LPAAT important for LA accumulation
  is suggested (), the responsible gene is unknown (indicated as “x” here). Cofactors
  and byproducts of enzymatic reactions are omitted. AGPAT3 and MBOAT7 are also termed
  LPAAT3 and LPIAT1, respectively. CDP-DAG, cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol; CL,
  cardiolipin; DAG, diacylglycerol; LPA, lysoPA; MAG, monoacylglycerol; NAE, N-acylethanolamine;
  NAPE, N-acyl PE; PI(4,5)P2, PI 4,5-bisphosphate; PI4P, PI 4-phosphate; SAG, stearoyl-arachidonoyl
  glycerol; TAG, triacylglycerol.'
