caption: The effects of mild and aggressive mechanical stimulations on LRP6, JNK signaling,
  eNOS production, and calcium ions in cardiomyocytes. (A,B) Piezo1 distribution observed
  to be different after subjected to mild and aggressive mechanical stimulations.
  (C) Cardiomyocytes subjected to 5% stretching for 24 h increased the LRP6/β-catenin
  (Wnt pathway) signaling. The SERCA2 is known to act as calcium transporter on the
  sarco/endoplasmic reticulum to promote cell contractility. In this study, SERCA
  was detected in the cardiomyocytes. (D) Piezo1 inhibition reduced calcium release
  at 5%. (E) At 25%, calcium ion release and T-eNOS protein level were reduced compared
  to 5%. (F) Piezo1 inhibition at 25% reduced calcium ion release; however, significantly
  increased LRP6/β-catenin, and JNK.
