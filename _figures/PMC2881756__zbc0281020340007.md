caption: Model illustrating the role of WDR3 in mediating cross-talk between ribosome
  biogenesis and p53-mediated cell cycle regulation. In cells expressing WDR3 (left
  panel), WDR3 gene expression is induced by the IGF-I signaling pathway, and the
  protein is localized to the nucleus where it is required for pre-rRNA processing
  of 18 S rRNA. Under these conditions, protein synthesis and cell cycle progression
  occur. In cells with suppressed WDR3 (right panel), defects in 18 S rRNA synthesis
  occur resulting in impaired 40 S ribosome biogenesis. As a result of impaired ribosome
  biogenesis (ribosomal stress), free rpL11 binds MDM2 allowing stabilization of p53.
  Under these conditions of impaired ribosome synthesis, p53 triggers cell cycle arrest
  at the G1/S checkpoint.
