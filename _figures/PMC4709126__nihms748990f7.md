caption: PINK1 deficiency leads to mitochondrial damage and depolarization, leading
  to inhibition of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger NCLX, the major Ca2+ efflux pathway in mitochondria.
  The resulting buildup of mCa2+ overload, combined with mitochondrial depolarization,
  can result in the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. PKA
  independent of PINK1 activates NCLX via phosphorylation at S258. Phosphorylation
  of NCLX rescues its activity in PINK1-deficient neurons and stops this vicious cycle,
  leading to recovery of mitochondrial membrane potential, thus enhancing dopaminergic
  neuronal survival.
