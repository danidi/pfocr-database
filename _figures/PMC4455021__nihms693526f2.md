caption: Mechanism of B7-H1/PD-1 pathway immune evasion. B7-H1/PD-1 pathway has been
  established as a major mechanism in the resistance of tumor to T cells’ attack.
  It is probable that a combination of mechanism, rather than a single model of action,
  can explain this resistance. B7-H1–positive tumor and tumor-associated cells might
  induce T cell apoptosis, anergy, functional exhaustion, or IL-10 production. Inducible
  B7-H1 expression by tumor cells in contact with CTLs acts as a “molecular shield”
  protecting tumor cells from cytotoxic lysis. Even though these mechanisms have been
  demonstrated in animal models, clinical significance in cancer patients remains
  poorly studied.
