caption: Representative pathways enriched with possible target genes of eight miRNAs
  whose plasma levels showed positive and negative correlations with CHA2DS2-VASc
  score and CA, respectively. (A) Pathway maps for “Development_Regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT)” and (B) “Pathway maps for “Androgen receptor activation and downstream
  signaling in Prostate cancer”, the 1st and 2nd most enriched pathways, respectively,
  querying possible target genes of the miRNA whose plasma levels showed positive
  correlations with CHA2DS2-VASc score (). Red bar represents possible target genes
  of miRNAs whose plasma levels were positively and negatively correlated with CHA2DS2-VASc
  score and CA, respectively. Green and red arrows mean positive and negative regulation
  of the target genes, respectively.
