caption: Schematic diagram showing the relevance of the Black–Leff operational model
  to quantification of agonist bias. The premise is based on the fact that the receptor
  conformation stabilized by the agonist will have a unique interaction with all signaling
  proteins that directly interact with it, thereby setting up the allosteric system(s)
  of modulator (agonist)/conduit (receptor)/guest (signaling protein). Under these
  circumstances, the affinity and the efficacy (the “quality” of the conformation)
  will be determined by the signaling protein, and this will be unique for each pathway.
  The magnitude of log(τ/KA) will be characteristic of both the affinity and efficacy
  of the agonist for a particular pathway.
