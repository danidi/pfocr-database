caption: Constitutively high MEK/ERK activity can mediate AR downregulation, growth
  inhibitory signaling and differentiation. In this signaling, AR downregulation is
  required to control NSE, NEP, p16INK4A and p21WAF expression (i). However, Rb phosphorylation
  and expression of E2F1 can be downregulated independently of AR downregulation (ii).
  Decreased AR transcriptional activity leads to PSA downregulation (i) but PSA is
  also downregulated via a non-transcriptional mechanism independently of AR downregulation
  (ii). Raf/EMK/ERK-mediated AR downregulation is also detected in a subset of PCa
  cells regardless of hormone sensitivity.
