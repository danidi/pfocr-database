caption: Engineering the raspberry ketone biosynthetic pathway in S. cerevisiae. a
  The phenylpropanoid pathway begins with the conversion of phenylalanine to p-coumaric
  acid via cinnamate or directly from tyrosine to p-coumaric acid (pink box). Conversion
  of p-coumaric acid to raspberry ketone requires three additional enzymatic steps
  including a condensation reaction between coumaroyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA. Heterologous
  production of raspberry ketone can be accomplished by the final three enzymatic
  reactions, if microbial cells are supplied with exogenous p-coumaric acid (blue
  box). The heterologous enzymes used for each reaction in this study are also listed.
  b Expression constructs used in this study for the production of raspberry ketone.
  Rigid and flexible linker sequences that were used for the protein fusions are represented
  by bold black lines (straight and wavy, respectively)
