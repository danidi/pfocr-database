caption: (A) Typical domain structure of the vertebrate Notch receptor and ligands.
  Jagged and Delta ligands share from N-terminus to C-terminus the Delta/Serrate/LAG-2
  domain (DSL), the Delta and OSM-11-like protein domain (DOS), a variable number
  of EGF repeats, transmembrane domain (TM), nuclear localization signal (NLS), and
  PSD95/Dlga/Zo-1domain (PDZ). Jagged1 and 2 also have a cysteine-rich domain (CR).
  Notch receptors have 24 to 36 EGF repeats, which mediate ligand interaction (11
  and 12, shaded in pink, are in direct contact with the DOS domain of the ligands).
  Following these EGF repeats are 3 cysteine-rich Lin-12/Notch repeats (LNRs), a heterodimerization
  domain (HD), transmembrane domain (TD), the RBP-Jκ association module (RAM), 7 NLS-flanked
  ankyrin repeats (ANK), and the proline/glutamic acid/serine/threonine-rich degradation
  motif (PEST). (B) Key steps involved in the activation of the Notch signaling pathway.
  In the absence of Notch activity, RBP-Jκ binds to the promoters of Notch target
  genes such as Hes and Hey and recruits corepressors to repress transcription. Newly
  synthesized Notch receptor experiences a series of posttranslational modifications
  in the ER and Golgi body before reaching the cell surface, including the glycosylation
  by O-fucose-transferase (Ofut1) and Fringe as well as the S1 cleavage by furin-like
  convertases. In contrast, the ligands are ubiquitinated in the signaling-sending
  cell by ubiquitin ligases such as Mib-1, endocytosed, and then recycled back to
  the cell membrane. Trans-interactions between the Notch receptor and its ligands
  is mediated by EGF repeat 11-12 of the receptor and the DOS domain of the ligands
  followed by transendocytosis of the ligand. This causes unfolding of the LNR/HD
  domain exposing the S2 cleavage site a substrate for the ADAM (A Disintegrin And
  Metalloprotease) metalloproteases. S2 cleavage leads to shedding of the extracellular
  domain of the receptor and turns it into the substrate for the γ-secretase complex,
  which catalyzes the cleavage at the S3 site within the Notch transmembrane domain.
  This leads to the release of the NICD from the cell membrane and its subsequent
  translocation into the nucleus, where it displaces corepressor bound to RBP-Jκ and
  recruits coactivators such as Mastermind and p300 to activate gene expression.
