caption: Diagram of TLR signaling pathways. TLRs localize to different subcellular
  compartments according to the molecular nature of the relevant ligands. TLR3, TLR7/8
  and TLR9 are located at endolysosomal compartment and recognized dsRNA or ssRNA
  or unmethylated CpG DNA, respectively. In contrast, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR11
  are mainly displayed on plasma membrane and recognize indicated ligands. TLR2/1
  heterodimers respond to triacyl lipopeptide, while TLR2/6 heterodimers recognize
  diacyl lipopeptide. CD14 and MD-2 are accessory proteins required for LPS/TLR4 ligation.
  Following ligation with their respective ligands, TLRs recruit downstream adaptor
  molecules, such as MyD88 (all TLRs except TLR3) and TRIF (TLR3 and TLR4), to activate
  IRAK4, TRAF6 and IKKε/TBK1. These sequentially activate signaling pathway of NF-κB,
  p38 MAPK and JNK, leading to a series of specific cellular responses related to
  cell survival, proliferation and inflammation. IRF3 and 7 are also activated downstream
  of TLR3, 7, 8 and 9. These signaling mediate the production of type 1 interferon
  and antiviral immune responses. MyD88:Myeloid differentiation primary-response protein
  88, IRAK:IL-1R-associated kinase, TRAM:TRIF-related adaptor molecules, TIRAP:TIR
  domain containing adaptor protein, TRAF:TNF receptor-associated factor, TAB:TGF-β
  activated kinase 1/MAP3K7 binding protein, TAK:TGF--activated kinase,IKK:inhibitor
  of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells kinase, MIKK:mitogen-activated
  protein kinase kinase.
