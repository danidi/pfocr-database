caption: Schematic summary of the mechanisms by which tick-borne Phlebovirus NSs proteins
  inhibit the canonical IFN induction and signaling pathways. Following bunyavirus
  infection, the generation of ssRNA with uncapped 5′ triphosphate ends during uncoating,
  transcription, or replication results in ssRNA binding to the RNA helicase RIG-I.
  RIG-I is activated in turn, and exposure of its two associated CARD domains allows
  the recruitment of the adaptor MAVS through two CARD-CARD interactions. Activation
  of MAVS leads to the subsequent activation of kinases such as TBK1 and/or IKKε,
  which leads to concomitant phosphorylation of IRF3 at specific serine residues.
  (A) Phosphorylation of IRF3 leads to its dimerization and translocation to the nucleus,
  where IRF3 dimers ultimately stimulate transcription of genes under the control
  of the IFN-α/β promoter, resulting in the production of IFN-α/β. (B) Signal transduction
  of type I IFNs initiates through the binding of secreted IFN-α/β to type I IFN receptors
  (a heterodimer of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) and the activation of multiple downstream signaling
  pathways. Signal transduction of type I, II, and III IFN initiates through the binding
  of secreted IFN to the respective IFN receptors and the activation of multiple downstream
  signaling pathways. Type I and type III IFN signaling pathways are mainly mediated
  via STAT1-STAT2 heterodimers. Receptor-associated kinases JAK1 and TYK2 become activated
  and phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2, respectively. Phosphorylated STATs can heterodimerize
  and recruit IRF9 for the assembly of the heterotrimer complex ISGF3. ISGF3 translocates
  to the nucleus and binds to ISRE, leading to the induction of many IFN-stimulated
  genes (ISG). Type III IFN signaling is more commonly associated with signaling by
  homodimerization of STAT1, which can translocate to the nucleus and activate GAS
  promoters, also initiating ISG transcription. Tick-borne Phlebovirus NSs proteins
  have evolved several countermeasures to block the IFN pathway. SFTSV NSs (red) directly
  interacts with and sequesters TBK1 and STAT2 into inclusion bodies to spatially
  isolate these elements. Additionally, through its interaction with TBK1 and STAT2,
  SFTSV NSs can also indirectly sequester IKKε, IRF-3, and STAT1 into the inclusion
  bodies. An interaction between SFTSV NSs and TRIM-25 also facilitates the spatial
  isolation of RIG-I, in an indirect manner. HRTV NSs (yellow) can also block IFN
  induction through a direct interaction with TBK1 and block IFN signaling by a direct
  interaction with STAT2. However, as HRTV NSs does not form inclusion bodies as SFTSV
  NSs does, its mechanism of antagonism is different from that of SFTSV NSs. UUKV
  NSs (green) blocks IFN induction only, targeting MAVS. For references, see the text.
