caption: Algorithm for estimating CC and MMI. (a) Inputs definition are given in Table ,
  the input was scaled from  through , by increasing the value ten units at a time.
  (b) Stochastic models of the MAPK/ERK pathway or minimal decoder is selected. The
  propensities and parameter values are given in Table . (c) Estimation of the response
  conditional probability distribution for every simulation minute. (d,e) Channel
  Capacity or Multivariate Mutual Information is computed.
