caption: Interactions between cellular metabolism, the circadian molecular clock,
  and ion channels. The core molecular clock consists of positive elements, such as
  circadian locomotor output kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1),
  that positively regulate the expression of PERs and CRYs, which comprise negative
  elements, repressing the activity of CLOCK and BMAL1 []. An additional feedback
  loop involves the BMAL1/CLOCK-mediated transcription of REV-ERB and RAR-related
  orphan receptor (ROR) proteins that inhibit and initiate Bmal1 transcription, respectively.
  Casein kinase 1 (CK1) enzymes contribute to timekeeping through phosphorylation
  and destabilization of PER. Reduced forms of NAD(H) and NADP(H) enhance DNA-binding
  activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK, while oxidized NAD+ and NADP+ inhibit their DNA binding
  []. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a rate-limiting enzyme in
  the NAD+biosynthetic pathway and is the driving force for rhythmic levels of cellular
  NAD+ which, in turn, activate NAD+-dependent histone deacetylases, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)
  and sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) [,]. SIRT1 has been found to exhibit circadian oscillatory
  activity and alter clock gene expression. SIRT3 is located in the mitochondria where
  it mediates metabolic processes. Heme is a known sensor of cellular redox state
  that binds to nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ and modulates their activity
  [,]. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an important sensor of cellular energy
  state activated by a high AMP/ATP ratio. AMPK mediates phosphorylation of CRY and
  CK1 []. Phosphorylation of CRY marks it for degradation and phosphorylation of CK1
  increases its activity and accelerates degradation of PER2. The balance between
  ROS levels and antioxidant defense systems, such as peroxiredoxins (Prx) and glutathione
  (GSH), contribute to the overall redox state. Ca2+, K+, and Na+ ion channels have
  been shown to be sensitive to redox modifications.
