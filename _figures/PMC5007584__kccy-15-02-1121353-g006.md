caption: HDR and mutagenic TLS function sequentially and are regulated in concert
  with checkpoint signaling to maximize the potential for error-free post-replication
  repair. The DNA damage checkpoint response to UV delays mitosis to allow HDR to
  complete error-free PRR using redundant information within the sister chromatids.
  Rad51 recombinase is required to prevent mutagenic TLS by Rev1 and Polζ during the
  checkpoint delay. A pathway mediated by Rhp18, Rad8, and Polη makes a more limited
  contribution to PRR at CPDs during the checkpoint delay and may continue to function
  after the G2/M checkpoint (not shown). After the G2/M checkpoint, cells lose the
  capacity to complete HDR and rely on Rev1 and Polζ to restore the continuity of
  the double helix. We suggest that the structures repaired by Rev1 and Polζ are formed
  most frequently in regions of the genome that remain unreplicated after the G2/M
  checkpoint. Gaps may form in such regions when replication forks encounter lesions
  (post-replicative daughter-strand gaps) or when an unreplicated region is unwound
  during mitosis (mitotic daughter-stand gaps). Rev1 and Polζ may begin to function
  immediately after cells pass the G2/M checkpoint or, more likely, gain access to
  DNA when HDR is inactivated at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition.
