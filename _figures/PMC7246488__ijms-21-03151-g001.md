caption: let-7 regulatory mechanisms govern HMGA2 misexpression, driving benign mesenchymal
  tumorigenesis. (A) Absence of tumor suppressor let-7 miRNA expression in the undifferentiated
  mesenchyme ensures ubiquitous HMGA2 expression during mammalian embryogenesis. (B)
  Increased let-7 expression as mesenchymal tissues mature and differentiate inhibits
  HMGA2 expression by binding to sites in the 3’ UTR of HMGA2 mRNA leading to transcript
  degradation. (C) Abundant HMGA2 transcription in many uterine leiomyomas and mammary
  fibroadenomas yield enough mRNA possessing multiple 3’ UTR binding sites that can
  soak up available let-7 allowing for remnant HMGA2 misexpression of full-length
  transcripts. (D) Intragenic chromosomal breaks at preferred locations between exons
  III and IV and (E) balanced translocations with chromosomal partners forming chimeric
  HMGA2 fused to ectopic sequences, are two mechanisms ensuring loss of HMGA2 3’ UTR
  and its let-7 binding sites allowing for misexpression of full-length HMGA2 transcripts
  and activation of the HMGA2 pathway in differentiated benign mesenchymal tumors.
