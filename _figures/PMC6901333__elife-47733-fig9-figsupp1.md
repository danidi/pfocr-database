caption: 'Loss-of-function mutation in the red-colored proteins and gain-of-function
  mutations in the green-colored proteins act as paqr-2 mutant suppressors. Note that
  there are likely two separate fluidity-promoting outputs of PAQR-2 signaling (dashed
  boxes): one output promotes desaturase transcription while the other output regulates
  incorporation of PUFAs into phospholipids. Previous studies showed that many paqr-2
  suppressor mutations act by promoting desaturase upregulation, either via either
  SBP-1::MDT-15 or NHR-49::MDT-15 (; ; ; ). Loss-of-function alleles of fld-1 () and
  or acs-13 (present work) have so far been identified as paqr-2 mutant suppressors
  that act as regulators of PUFA levels in phospholipids.'
