caption: Dynamic regulation of P2X4 receptors in microglia. Microglia in the physiological
  CNS actively monitor their surrounding environment for potential stimuli that threaten
  homeostasis. In response to peripheral nerve injury spinal microglia upregulate
  expression of P2X4 receptors, which normally are expressed at low levels in the
  ‘resting/surveillance state.’ Upregulation of P2X4 receptors is a critical mechanistic
  step through which spinal microglia signal to neurons in the spinal dorsal horn
  to cause neuropathic pain. Activation of P2X4 receptors initiates the p38 MAPK-BDNF-KCC2
  signalling cascade to cause aberrant nociceptive output that underlies pain hypersensitivity
  characterized by hyperalgesia, allodynia, and spontaneous pain. Molecules released
  from injured neurons, such as the chemokines CCL2 and CCL21, as well as the cytokine
  IFN-γ, increase P2X4 receptor expression in microglia. The fibronectin-Lyn kinase
  signalling cascade and tryptase released from mast cells have also been found to
  upregulate P2X4 receptors in microglia. Thus, the P2X4 receptor and the components
  of its signalling pathway have emerged as a core mechanism through which spinal
  microglia contribute to neuropathic pain.
