caption: Schematic diagram showing clathrin mediated endocytosis of KSHV in HFF cells
  []. (1) KSHV glycoproteins bind and interact with heparan sulfate, α3β1, αVβ3 and
  αVβ5 integrins followed by their interaction with EphA2. The association of EphA2
  with integrins leads to the formation of an active signaling complex among integrins,
  c-Cbl and myosin with simultaneous induction of FAK, Src, and PI3-K; (2) Activated
  c-Cbl polyubiquitinates EphA2 and recruits the accessory proteins Eps15 and adaptor
  protein AP-2 to mediate the endocytosis of the virus; (3) This is followed by the
  activation, recruitment and assembly of clathrin for the formation of clathrin coated
  pits; (4 and 5) The activated signaling platforms and the associated molecules leads
  to the internalization of KSHV into clathrin coated vesicles and dynamin dependent
  release of the vesicles; (6) The internalized vesicles also recruit Rab5 and transports
  KSHV to a productive infectious pathway and gene expression.
