caption: ER stress activates the regulators of UPR (atf-6, ire-1 and pek-1) and the
  data presented herein support a role for manf-1 in the regulation of the ire-1 arm
  of the unfolded protein response (UPR) by acting as both a negative regulator of
  xbp-1 transcriptional activation and a positive regulator of innate immunity factors
  in response to tunicamycin.m. ER stress and protein misfolding activate the ire-1
  pathway by dissociating hsp-3/4 from ire-1 allowing ire-1 to become phosphorylate
  (yellow circles) leading to activation of xbp-1 as well as of other transcriptional
  factors. We also suggest a conserved feedback loop whereby ER stress and xbp-1 activation
  results in increased manf-1 expression (as also reported in mammalian cell culture
  ()), suppressing further xbp-1 activation and acting as a negative regulator of
  the UPR.
