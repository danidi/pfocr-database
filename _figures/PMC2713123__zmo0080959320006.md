caption: 'Model for early- and late-phase platelet aggregation regulated through  PAR1.
  Thrombin signals stable activation of human platelets through sequential  PAR1-mediated
  pathways. a, initial DAG formation leads to activation of PKC, a  potent activator
  of PLD, which converts  1-dodecanoyl-2-tridecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine to
  PA and subsequently  DAG (with lipid phosphate phosphohydrolases). The cofactor
  for PLD,  PIP2, is formed after the complex formation of active Rap1, PI3K,  and
  PI5K, leading to a continuous generation of DAG formation and a continued  positive
  feedback on RapGEF and subsequent Rap1 activation that can be  inhibited by inhibiting
  any one of these processes. b, there are two phases to  platelet activation: an
  early unstable (reversible), and a late stable  (irreversible) phase, which signal
  through distinct pathways after activation  of PAR1. The early phase of platelet
  activation results in activation  primarily of the Gq and G13 G-protein pathways,
  which  subsequently induce the activation of Rap1 through RapGEF (CalDAG-GEF). This  mode
  of activating Rap1 induces early platelet aggregation. After this early  activation
  phase, platelets require maintenance of the platelet aggregate  through specific
  constituents of the PAR1 signaling pathway, including  PI-kinase and PLD-signaling
  components, to attain irreversible platelet  aggregation (a hallmark of second-phase
  activation of the human platelet).  This reinforcement maintains Rap1 activity and
  platelet aggregation, which may  allow for a stable platelet plug (and under pathological
  circumstances,  complete vessel occlusion).'
