caption: 'Scheme of rod and cone visual cycle. (Left) Currently supported visual cycle
  for rods. After absorption of light, the visual pigment chromophore, 11-cis retinal
  is isomerized to all-trans reteinal. All-trans retinal is detached from opsin and
  reduced by RDH8 to all-trans retinol in the presence of a cofactor, NADPH. This
  retinol is transferred to the RPE where the all-trans form is isomerized to the
  11-cis form and is oxidized to 11-cis retinal; 11-cis retinal is transferred back
  to the OS of a rod to regenerate visual pigment. (Right) Proposed model of visual
  cycle for cones. A similar pathway of visual cycle is present in cones. However,
  in cones additional pathway for production of 11-cis retinal is present: 11-cis
  retinol supplied from Müller cells is converted to 11-cis retinal by the ALOL-coupling
  reaction without a cofactor, NADP+ (see the text for details).'
