caption: 'Proposed mechanisms of sex-related susceptibility to COVID-19. On the top
  of the figure, epidemiological data from the Italian Ministry of Health are reported,
  with respective gender distribution of cases and deaths. A schematic representation
  of SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection is reported: after binding of viral spike proteins
  to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (1), transmembrane serine protease-2 (TMPRSS2)
  primes S protein (2), favoring viral entry and infection (3). ACE2 is also crucial
  in tissue response to viral infection, as it is typically involved in the the renin–angiotensin
  system (RAS), where it converts angiotensin I into angiotensin 1–7 (Ang 1–7), which
  binds to Mas receptor (MasR) and favors tissue protection, mainly by hypotensive
  and anti-inflammatory pathways. Conversely, ACE converts angiotensin I into angiotensin
  II/III (Ang II/III) that binds to angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), favoring
  tissue injury. On the left, the main mechanisms involved in reduced COVID-19 severity
  and mortality in women are proposed: (a) ACE2 methylation (M, orange dot) is reduced
  in women, resulting in higher ACE2 expression; (b) ACE2 is located on the X chromosome,
  which in females is present in two copies, in a region of the short arm where 15–30%
  of genes undergoes X inactivation Escape (XiE); (c) estrogens, produced by the ovary,
  promote ACE2 expression. Increased levels of ACE2 would provide a larger pool for
  tissue protection (green arrows) after viral entry. On the right, mechanisms involved
  in male increased susceptibility: (d) androgens, produced by testes, bind to the
  androgen receptor and are recognized by androgen-responsive elements (ARE) in the
  promoter of TMPRSS2, leading to increased expression, which in turn favors viral
  entry in males, whereas low levels of androgens in women may keep at low levels
  TMPRSS2 expression, representing a further protective factor for the development
  of COVID-19 infection. The lack of increased ACE2 pool in men due to low estrogens
  would favor the ACE pathway (red arrows) in the RAS axis, which further promotes
  tissue injury and disease severity in men, compared with women with the same viral
  load'
