caption: Blue lines indicate pathways whose activity had decreased after the sea voyage.
  Representative pathways, particularly the folate biosynthesis pathway, are highlighted
  in green boxes. Red boxes indicate pathways involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates,
  lipids, or amino acids; green boxes indicate pathways that belong to other metabolic
  processes. (a) Buccal mucosa samples. (b) Belly button samples. The data were analysed
  with the MG-RAST server using the KEGG mapper for functional analysis with a maximum
  e-value of 1e-5, a minimum identity of 80%, and a minimum alignment length of 15
  amino acids in protein databases.
