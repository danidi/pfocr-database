caption: Positive selection of nonautoreactive immature B cells into the peripheral
  B-cell compartment requires a threshold level of tonic BCR signaling. Differentiation
  of nonautoreactive immature B cells into transitional and mature B cells and entry
  into the peripheral B-cell population depends on a certain threshold of BCR expression
  and tonic BCR signaling, which is translated by the Ras-Mek-Erk signaling pathway.
  BAFFR expression correlates with BCR surface expression and tonic signaling, and
  BAFFR signaling contributes to the differentiation of immature into transitional
  B cells. The scheme is based on data from ,.
