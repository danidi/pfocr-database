caption: The proposed catalytic steps leading to the synthesis of the MTX motif and
  its transfer onto the mannoside caps of M. tuberculosis ManLAM are represented.
  The identity of the translocase involved in the translocation of DP-MTX from the
  cytoplasmic to the periplasmic side of the inner membrane and the precise nature
  of the nucleotide-MTX donor used by MtxS in the formation of DP-MTX are not known.
