caption: Diagram demonstrating the hypothesis that during pregnancy placenta-derived
  mitochondrial DNA, through TLR9 activation, increases vascular reactivity to constrictor
  stimuli via an ERK1/2-dependent signaling pathway and potentiates the release of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines, contributing to preeclampsia-like symptoms (i.e., maternal
  hypertension and intrauterine growth restriction).
