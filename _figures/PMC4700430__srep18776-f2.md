caption: 'To identify over-represented pathways, the DAVID software was used to map
  the input genes onto BioCarta, KEGG, and Reactome pathway databases, separately
  for the up-regulated (n = 52) and down-regulated (n = 182) genes. The only significant
  pathway was “REACT_13685: Synaptic Transmission” in the Reactome pathway database
  (p = 0.011) for the down-regulated genes. Four genes in the input gene list, ie.
  BCHE, CACNA1B, CACNA1E, and VAMP2, were included in this pathway. (a) Global schema
  of the pathway, showing that the pathway consists of 3 encapsulated pathway components:
  “Transmission across Electrical Synapses”, “Transmission across Chemical Synapses”
  and “Potassium Channels”. (b) Schema of the “Transmission across Chemical Synapses”
  component, in which all the four input genes are included. This schema shows that
  this component consists of 5 subcomponents. (c) Schema of a part of the “Neurotransmitter
  Release Cycle” subcomponent, in which VAMP2 is included as “SNARE complex”. (d)
  Schema of a part of the “Depolarization of the Presynaptic Terminal Triggers the
  Opening of Calcium Channels” subcomponent, in which CACNA1B and CACNA1E are included
  as “Voltage Gated Ca2+ Channel”. (e) Schema of a part of the “Neurotransmitter Clearance
  in the Synaptic Cleft” subcomponent, in which BCHE is included as “Cholinesterase”.'
