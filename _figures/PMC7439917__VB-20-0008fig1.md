caption: ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 induces pericyte damage and microvascular
  dysfunction. (A) SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for entry and the serine protease
  TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. (B) ACE2-mediated cardiovascular protection is lost
  following endocytosis of the receptor along with SARS-CoV-2 viral particles. (C)
  Unopposed ACE activity leads to Ang II generation with increased activity of angiotensin
  1 receptors (AT1R) at the cost of ACE2/Ang 1–7 driven pathways. (D) This leads to
  increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), vasoconstriction, vascular permeability,
  oxidative stress, and inflammation. Moreover, ACE2 downregulation results in increased
  level of Des-Arg9-bradykinin (normally degraded by ACE2) which through the kinin
  receptor B1 (B1R) causes vascular leakage and inflammation. (E) ADAM17 mediated
  proteolytic cleavage of ACE2 is upregulated by endocytosed SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins.
  Activation of the AT1R by elevated Ang II levels also further increases ADAM17 activity.
  Soluble ACE2 can act as a blocking receptor for SARS-CoV-2. (F) After replication
  and cellular damage, the virus spreads to other cells causing incremental injury
  and vascular dysfunction. Alternatively, if the virus does not reach the heart,
  viral particles and proteins could do so, activating the described signalling pathway.
