caption: Schematic of PIK3CA structure and “hot-spot” mutations observed in human
  cancers. Cancer-specific mutations are clustered in the helical and catalytic domain
  of p100α.Several mutations have been reported in human solid tumors for PIK3CA,
  the gene that encodes the catalytic subunit p110α  of PI3K. High frequency of missense
  mutations is observed at the amino acid residues E542, E545 and H1047.
