caption: Soluble T cell receptor (TCR) therapy. (a) The MHC-I antigen presentation
  pathway is predicted to present at least one peptide from any protein present in
  a cell at 500 copies or more. This clever system allows the TCRs on the surface
  of MHC-I-restricted T cells to inspect the cellular proteome from the cell surface
  and detect internal anomalies. This ‘X-ray vision’ allows TCRs to access a far greater
  number of cellular targets than are available to monoclonal antibodies. Phage-display
  and directed evolution of TCRs  can generate very high-affinity molecules (KD < 10
  pM) that bind to the cognate peptide-MHC (pMHC) with very long half-lives (several
  hours). These molecules can then be used to deliver therapeutic payloads to specific
  cells in vivo. (b) High-affinity tumour-specific TCRs can be ‘fused’ to a CD3-specific
  Fab fragment to produce a bi-specific molecule. Such molecules have recently been
  used to induce cancer regression .
