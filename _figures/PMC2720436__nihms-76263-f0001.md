caption: 'The Hippo pathway, a vital growth regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis
  was initially identified by mosaic screens in Drosophila melanogaster (,). Information
  that is known about the Hippo pathway in Drosophila is likely directly applicable
  to mammalian systems as it has been shown that mammalian homologs are capable of
  rescuing Drosophila mutants defective in Hippo signaling (-). The components of
  this pathway which are highly conserved in mammals include the following: YAP (Yes-associated
  protein), Lats1/2, Mob, Mst1/2, Sav, Merlin, Expanded 1/2, and Fat 4 () (). Hippo
  (Hpo) and Warts (Wts), two significant core pathway components, belong to the Sterile
  20 (Ste20) and Nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) serine/threonine protein kinase families,
  respectively (,-). Salvador (Sav), a third major component of the Hippo pathway,
  is a scaffold protein with two WW domains and is homologous to the human ww45 protein
  (,). YAP, one of the highly conserved components in mammals, is considered to be
  a nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway (,). It has been noted that loss of critical
  components of the Hippo pathway can lead to uncontrolled cell growth, which implicates
  this as a tumor suppressor pathway ().'
