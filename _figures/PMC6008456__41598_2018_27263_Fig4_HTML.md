caption: Schematic model illustrating hypothetical changes of the ‘oxidative tonus’
  in the small intestine of juvenile tegu lizards, associated with seasonal changes
  in metabolic rate during their first annual cycle. (A) Circles depict the decrease
  of resting metabolic rates during the autumn and winter in neonate tegus, and the
  reactivation during arousal in spring (data from de Souza et al., 2004). Diamonds
  depict the ‘oxidative tonus’ of the intestinal tissue in the corresponding stages
  of the annual cycle, according to the current results. The tegus hatched during
  the summer, and early autumn samples were not available for this study. Late in
  the autumn, the highest GSSG levels indicate a redox imbalance and a more oxidized
  environment in intestinal tissue. During winter dormancy the concentration of LOOH
  decreased, indicating that proportional adjustments in the processes that produce
  and consume energy promote a lower steady state concentration of ROS. The reactivation
  of metabolism is gradual during arousal from dormancy, restoring the pre-hibernation
  redox balance in the intestinal tissue. (B) Hypothetical mechanism to explain the
  increased GSSG levels observed during late autumn in the tegu intestine. NADPH should
  be generated in large amounts through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in the
  intestinal mucosa of actively growing tegus (in summer and early autumn). However,
  in late autumn metabolic rates slow down and NADPH supply should – hypothetically
  – decrease in the tissue. This may impair the enzymatic management of H2O2 (mainly
  by GPX and peroxiredoxins), leading to redox imbalance. LOOH, lipid hydroperoxides;
  GPX, glutathione peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; GSH, reduced glutathione;
  GSSG, disulfide glutathione; PRX, peroxiredoxin; Trx(ox), oxidized thioredoxin;
  Trx(red), reduced thioredoxin; TrxR, thioredoxin reductase.
