caption: Integrated “omic” analysis reveals global metabolic changes. Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes “search&color pathway” analysis for phosphoproteins and metabolites
  overlaid on the human metabolic reference map (hsa01100). Phosphoproteomic data
  from one biological replicate of the SU-DHL-1 were used, whereas metabolomic data
  from 4 averaged biological replicates of SU-DHL-1 cells were used. Metabolites that
  changed (Student t test, P < .05) in response to CEP treatment were used. Green
  and red represent decrease and increase, respectively. Lines represent phosphoprotein
  and dots represent metabolites. Blue shading over glycolysis, TCA cycle, and nucleotide
  metabolism serve to highlight pathways that are highly represented.
