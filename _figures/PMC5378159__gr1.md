caption: Synthesis and metabolism of repressors of SREBP processing and LXR ligands,
  24S,25-EC, 25-HC, of the EBI2 ligand 7α,25-diHC and of the RORγt ligand 7β,26-diHC.
  Shown in the inset is 24S-HC, a repressor of SREBP processing and an LXR ligand
  formed from cholesterol by the enzyme CYP46A1. Full stereochemistry is shown only
  for the initial sterols in the pathways. Systematic names given in parenthesis.
  Enzymes are indicated where known. A broken arrows indicates a postulated pathway
  with associated enzyme.
