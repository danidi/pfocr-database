caption: Degradation of histidine. The pathways glutamate fermentation (fnc1) (red)
  and degradation of histidine to L-glutamate (histidine2) (black) describe (amino
  acid) degradations producing ammonia as an end product. Due to the reversibility
  of all its reactions, this also includes the pathway of biosynthesis of 5-formimino-THF
  (blue), which - inversely followed - describes the degradation of 5-formimino-THF
  to glutamate (c2). All three pathways are interconnected and can be interpreted
  as complete degradation of L-histidine to acetate and ammonia (NH3). Thereby, three
  moles of ammonia per mole of histidine are produced (green or turquoise boxes, respectively).
  As histidine2 includes an alternative route from L-histidine to glutamate (dashed
  line), one mole of ammonia is either produced by the conversion of N-carbamoyl-L-glutamate
  to L-glutamate or by the conversion of N-formimino-tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate.
