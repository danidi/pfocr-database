caption: Model showing that the EMB-triggering regulatory pathway through EtbR enhances
  the INH sensitivity of M. tuberculosis. The solid orange discs with a notch represent
  EtbR, the repressor protein to both etbR and inhA. The solid green triangle represents
  the EMB molecule; it can bind with EtbR and enhances its DNA-binding activity, thus
  down-regulating the expression of inhA (color diamond bar, inhA operon). Less InhA
  (short blue round bars) makes cells more sensitive to INH radicals (small purple
  bent bars).
