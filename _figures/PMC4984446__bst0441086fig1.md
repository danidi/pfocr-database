caption: '(A) Schematic representation of ribosome biogenesis and the link between
  the 5S RNP and MDM2. Three of the rRNAs (18S, 5.8S and 28S) are transcribed by RNA
  polymerase I (Pol I) in the nucleolus, whereas the 5S rRNA is transcribed by RNA
  polymerase III (Pol III) in the nucleoplasm. The mature (18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S)
  rRNAs and the precursor rRNAs (47S, 21S, 18SE, 32S and 7S) are indicated. The LSU
  ribosome biogenesis factors PAK1IP1 and PICT1 are shown. (B) Illustration of the
  5S RNP interaction with MDM2 and the regulation of p53 signalling in both unstressed
  and stressed cells; Ub: ubiquitin.'
