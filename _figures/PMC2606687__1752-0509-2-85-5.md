caption: Map of fructose utilization pathway in A. baylyi. Fructose utilization pathway
  produces fructose-1,6-biphosphate which should be a precursor for the biosynthesis
  of pentose phosphates and polysaccharides and for the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
  Model accordingly predicts growth with fructose as sole carbon source. Phenotyping
  experiments show no growth of A. baylyi with fructose as sole carbon source. Supposedly,
  the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway may not operate in the glycolytic direction
  in A. baylyi, as already observed for glucose utilization [,]. See main text for
  details.
