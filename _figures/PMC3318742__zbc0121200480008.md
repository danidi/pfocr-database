caption: Model of how RACK1 mediates activation of SHH/GLI signaling in NSCLC Cells.
  Left, normal lung cells have low expression level of RACK1, and Smo is mainly localized
  in the cytoplasm, not on the cell membrane. Cytoplasmic Smo has little ability to
  stimulate Gli1 activation. Right, NSCLC cells express high levels of RACK1 that
  binds, transports, and activates Smo on the cell membrane in response to the SHH
  ligand. This results in translocation of Gli1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,
  leading to increased Gli1 levels and subsequent activation of downstream target
  genes.
