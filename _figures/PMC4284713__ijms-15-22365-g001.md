caption: 'Activation of ovarian cancer G protein-coupled receptor 1 (OGR1) by extracellular
  acidification. (A) Proton has been suggested as an agonists of OGR1. Cu2+ and Zn2+
  inhibit pH-dependent OGR1 activation; and (B) His residues that have been reported
  to be involved in proton-sensing process are bolded and underlined in OGR1. The
  interaction between protons and His residues of OGR1 leads to the activation of
  Gq/11/PLC/Ca2+pathway. PLC: phospholipase C; Gq/11: Gq/11 protein; IP3: inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate.'
