caption: Pathways that control the onset of adulthood and the terminal differentiation
  of specific cell lineages are conserved from C. elegans to mammals. (A) The C. elegans
  heterochronic pathway controls hypodermal terminal differentiation and the onset
  of adulthood by regulating the timing of MAB-10/LIN-29 activity. In the adult hypoderm,
  MAB-10 and LIN-29 prevent the expression of the nuclear hormone receptors nhr-23
  and nhr-25, which promote the expression of downstream genes required for molting.
  In the L4 seam cells, MAB-10 and LIN-29 prevent extra seam cell divisions by promoting
  the expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor cki-1/p27kip. NHR-25 has been proposed
  to act with LIN-29 to promote seam cell exit from the cell cycle. (B) Above, a model
  proposing that mammalian LIN28 controls the onset of menarche by regulating the
  timing of NAB/EGR activity in the gonadotrope lineage, possibly via a conserved
  heterochronic pathway. The nuclear hormone receptor SF1/NHR25 acts with EGR1 to
  promote the expression of the luteinizing hormone β subunit. Below, a model proposing
  that mammalian LIN28 controls the terminal differentiation of Schwann cells by regulating
  NAB/EGR activity.
