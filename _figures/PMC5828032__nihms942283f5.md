caption: Therapeutic inhibition of miR-214 in ulcerative colitis. During intestinal
  injury miR-214 is induced by IL-6 induced signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3 (STAT3) (left side of the dotted line). Elevated miR-214 levels inhibit PDLIM2
  (PDZ and LIM domain-containing protein) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog)
  representing direct miR-214 target genes. Inhibition of PDLIM2 and PTEN allow for
  phosphorylation of AKT (also protein kinase B, PKB), and finally activation of NF-κB.
  This pro-inflammatory pathway is triggered by a positive feedback loop aggravating
  and driving inflammation. Blocking miR-214 (right side of the dotted line) can break
  this feedback loop. Elevated PDLIM2 and PTEN level prevent phosphorylation of AKT,
  and consequently impede activation of NF-κB. In experimental colitis this therapeutic
  inhibition of miR-214 resulted in a lesser degree of severity of disease and reduced
  tumor growth in experimental colitis-associated cancer (CAC) []
