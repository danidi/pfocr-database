caption: Diagram depicting DA metabolic pathways. First dopamine (DA) is deaminated
  to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylaldehyde (DOPAL) by monoamine oxidase (MAO). The majority
  of DA is degraded along the “oxidative” pathway, where DOPAL is oxidized to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic
  acid (DOPAC) by ALDH. A small portion of DOPAL is reduced by aldehyde/aldose reductase
  (AR) to form 3,4-dihydroxyethanol (DOPET) along a “reductive” pathway.
