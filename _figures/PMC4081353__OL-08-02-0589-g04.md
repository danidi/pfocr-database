caption: Possible model showing the cooperation of the activating mutations KRAS G12A
  and BRAF V600E in the present case of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Simultaneous
  activation of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway by CRAF and BRAF occurs individually.
  BRAF V600E can transphosphorylate and hyperactivate CRAF in the presence of oncogenic
  KRAS, thus strongly augmenting MEK/ERK signaling activation. ERK-mediated negative
  feedback is highly resisted by BRAF-V600E.
