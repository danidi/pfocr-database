caption: Analysis of one aspect of system response, the SLQB of cell-to-cell variation
  in system output. Shown is how we dissected cell-to-cell variation in reporter gene
  expression. Division of system into a pathway subsystem, P, that goes from receptor
  binding to transcription factor activation, and an expression subsystem, E, that
  goes from transcription factor activation to accumulation of reporter protein. By
  analyzing system output in combination with fluorescent reporter gene expression
  from constitutive promoters, we were able to find that the majority of cell-to-cell
  variation in total system output was due to cell-to-cell variation in a component
  of the expression subsystem, not in gene expression noise or in signal transmission
  variation [].
