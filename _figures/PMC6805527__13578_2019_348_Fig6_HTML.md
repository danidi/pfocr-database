caption: Potential molecular mechanisms of Ang II receptor inhibitor LCZ696 in PAH
  by regulating the ERK signaling pathway. In vivo and in vitro, LCZ676 reduces the
  expression of ANP, βMHC, TIMP2, Collagen I, Collagen III and TGF-β in cardiomyocytes
  by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation, thus diminishing cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis,
  along with cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which ultimately attenuates cardiac remodeling
  in mice with PAH
