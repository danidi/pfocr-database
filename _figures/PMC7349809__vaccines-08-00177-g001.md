caption: Mechanisms for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) inhibition of type I interferon
  (IFN) production. (1) The RSV NS1 and NS2 proteins can act on many components of
  the type I IFN induction pathway in order to reduce the production of IFN-α/β. NS2
  binds to the caspase activation and recruitment domains (CARDs) on retinoic acid-inducible
  gene-I-like receptor (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5).
  This blocks RIG-I from dimerizing and interacting with mitochondrial antiviral signaling
  (MAVS). NS1 also reduces the level of TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)3 inside
  the cell, inhibiting the subsequent activation of the downstream TANK-binding kinase
  1 (TBK1)/IκB kinase (IKKε) complex. (2) Both NS1 and NS2 block the translocation
  of interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3/IRF7 into the nucleus. NS1 can bind and sequester
  IRF3 in the cytosol. NS1 and NS2 both inhibit the upstream phosphorylation of IRF3.
  (3) NS1 and NS2 also act on the IFN receptor (IFNAR) signaling pathway to obstruct
  the induction of type I IFN-mediated interferon-stimulating gene (ISG) production.
  NS2 reduces the levels of both total signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT)2 and phoshorylated STAT2. The dimished activation inhibits the nuclear translocation
  of STAT1/STAT2, reducing the induction of ISGs. Finally, the presence of NS1 lowers
  the quantity of ISGs found in infected cells. Created with BioRender.com
