caption: Participation of CD14 in TLR4 signaling pathways triggered by sLPS and rLPS.
  a In the presence of CD14, sLPS and rLPS activate TLR4 and trigger MyD88- and TRIF-dependent
  pathways with similar intensity. b, c Studies performed on macrophages bearing the
  Heedless mutation of Cd14 have indicated that sLPS requires CD14 to activate TLR4
  (b), while rLPS can induce TRIF-dependent signaling of TLR4 in CD14-deficient cells
  (c). d–f Other studies suggest that the requirement of CD14 for activation of TLR4
  varies depending on the concentration of the endotoxin. At low concentrations, sLPS
  or rLPS are unable to activate TLR4 without the involvement of CD14 (d). At higher
  doses of sLPS, CD14 is dispensable for initiation of MyD88-dependent pathway of
  TLR4, although the production of TNF-α is submaximal in these conditions (e). When
  present in relatively high concentrations, rLPS can induce submaximal activation
  of both signaling pathways of TLR4 without binding to CD14 (f)
