caption: Wnt1 mRNA in the rhombic lip is graded with the highest expressors giving
  rise to hRPe beginning at ~E8. These cells emerge from the rhombic lip and occupy
  the entire hRPe by ~E9.5 (yellow); they intermix in the AP and DV dimensions and
  are highly proliferative. Beginning at ~E9.25-9.5, Gdf7 expression starts in the
  dorsal-most progenitor cells in the rhombic lip and these progenitors give rise
  to hRPe (dark blue) that is compartmentalized in both the AP and DV dimensions,
  settles laterally, and is nonmitotic immediately upon emerging from the rhombic
  lip. The medially-located (yellow) hRPe cells have a history of Wnt1 expression,
  whereas the laterally-located (dark blue) hRPe cells have a history of both Wnt1
  and Gdf7 expression. Caudally (r2-r8)-derived lateral hRPe (light blue) expresses
  TTR and Kcne2 from ~E9.5 onward while rostrally (r1)-derived only after E12.5. Beginning
  at ~E12.5, laterally-located hRPe cells (light and dark blue) undergo cell shape
  changes to form the hCPe (not drawn to scale). Medially-located hRPe cells (yellow)
  do not appear to contribute to the hCPe. From ~E12.5 through E14, Gdf7+ progenitors
  within the rhombic lip likely generate hCPe cells directly, without seeming to transition
  through an hRPe intermediate. At ~E14, the production interval for hCPe ceases.
  Ligand-independent activation of the Notch1 signaling pathway in the Gdf7 lineage
  (the hRPe and hCPe lineage) results in overproliferation of hCPe. 4v/fourth ventricle;
  hCP/hindbrain choroid plexus; mes/mesenchymal cells.
