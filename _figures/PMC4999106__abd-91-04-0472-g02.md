caption: Main components of innate immune system in epidermis and their role in atopic
  dermatitis (AD). Defects in Toll-like receptor 2 contribute to increased colonization
  and infection by S. aureus. Decreased AD expression of AMP (catelicidin-LL37 and
  β-defensin) also favors skin infections. Reduced plasmacytoid dendritic cells in
  skin injured areas by AD, facilitating certain viral skin infections. Reduced NK
  cells in AD. S. epidermidis increase the expression of human β-defensin by human
  keratinocytes through TLR2 signaling pathway. IDEC are increased in AD skin lesion.
  NOD1 changes are associated with elevated IgE levels in AD individuals. Changes
  in expression of NLRP1 gene were associated to AD severity Staphylococcus aureus
  (S. aureus), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis),  other bacteria,  staphylococcal
  enterotox in,  virus, Toll-like receptors (TLR), nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain-containing protein (NOD) NOD-like receptor protein (NLRP)  β-defensina 1,  HBD-2,3
  e LL37, inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (IDEC), plasmacytoid DC (pDC).
