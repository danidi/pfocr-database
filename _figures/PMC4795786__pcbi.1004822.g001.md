caption: 'The reaction schema: NO˙ is synthesized in a generator cell and freely diffuses,
  either within the same cell or to a target cell, to activate sGC; sGC is oxidized
  by H2O2 and inactivated. Either sGC or NO˙-sGC can convert GTP to cGMP, which is
  degraded by PDE to GMP. Note that oxidative stress drives the system toward the
  oxidative limb, and that the goal of pharmacological modulation of this pathway
  is to reverse the adverse effects of oxidative stress and to minimize PDE inhibition
  in order to optimize cGMP levels. NAC can be used as an antioxidant (impairing hydrogen
  peroxide-dependent oxidation of SGC and, perhaps, oxidation of NO˙), sildenafil
  as a PDE5 inhibitor, and SNAP as an NO˙ donor to modulate this pathway experimentally.
  Abbreviations: cGMP, cyclic guanosine 3'', 5''-monophosphate; GMP, guanosine-5''-monophosphate;
  GTP, guanosine-5''-triphosphate; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; NAC, N-acetylcysteine;
  NO˙, nitric oxide; NOx, oxidized (inactive) nitrogen oxides; PDE, phosphodiesterase;
  SNAP, S-Nitroso-n-nacetylpenicillamine; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase.'
