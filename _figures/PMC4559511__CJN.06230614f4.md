caption: 'Mechanisms through which complement mediates antibody-initiated kidney diseases.
  (A) Complement and membranous nephropathy (MN): autoantibodies reactive to podocyte-expressed
  phospholipase A2 receptor 1 (PLA2R1) activate complement through the mannose-binding
  lectin (MBL) pathway. Cascade amplification promotes membrane attack complex (MAC)
  formation, which induces sublytic signaling and dedifferentiation of the podocyte
  to impair its filtration capacity, leading to proteinuria. (B) Complement and immune
  complex disease: circulating or in situ–formed immune complexes from kidney disease
  initiated by lupus, streptococcal infections, and cryoglobulinemia are deposited
  in the subepithelial and/or subendothelial space of the glomerulus. Classical pathway
  activation induces inflammation and recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages (MΦ),
  promoting tissue injury. (C) Complement and ANCA vasculitis. Cytokine-induced neutrophil
  activation results in surface expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO; among other cytoplasmic
  antigens). On binding to ANCA and cross-linking FcR, local complement activation
  results in C5a production, which induces vascular inflammation by ligating its receptor
  C5aR. GBM, glomerular basement membrane; PMN, polymorphonuclear leukocyte.'
