caption: Under low glucose conditions, COUP-TFII expression is promoted by the FOXO1
  transcription factor. Elevated COUP-TFII levels will then modulate insulin secretion
  by a still undefined mechanism (not shown). In response to high glucose, insulin
  is secreted from β-cells. By autocrine signaling, insulin targets its own receptor
  on β-cells to activate the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, leading to
  activation of AKT and phosphorylation of FOXO1, driving down COUP-TFII expression.
