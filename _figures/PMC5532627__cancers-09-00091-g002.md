caption: 'Linking processing of clustered DNA damage and immune response. I. The challenge
  of repairing a clustered damaged DNA site: a task for real survivors. Upon the induction
  of clustered DNA damage consisting for example of one double strand break (DSB)
  and two oxidative DNA lesions like a damaged base (shown here with an asterisk)
  and an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, two at least DNA repair pathways and several
  DNA repair proteins will arrive at the same chromosome region. For the base damage,
  the primary pathway is the base excision repair (BER) while for the DSB, here we
  consider for simplicity only the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In all cases,
  the most basic proteins and enzymes are also described in the main text. Last but
  not least, as shown by advanced fluorescence microscopy and foci colocalization,
  each DSB is expected to be rapidly accompanied by the phosphorylation of thousands
  of H2AX histone protein molecules called γH2AX. The MRN complex functions rather
  as a sensor of DNA ends and activates ATM kinase. The ATM phosphorylates substrates
  such as Chk2, p53, and the H2AX in flanking chromosomal regions. II. Linkage to
  immune response. Processing of clustered DNA damage and especially of unrepaired
  orpersistent is expected to lead to senescence or cell death i.e., apoptosis, necrosis

  can trigger the extracellular release of diverse signatures of ‘Danger’ signals
  or Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs: ATP, short DNAs/RNAs, ROS, heat
  shock proteins (HSPs), high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB)-1, S100 proteins and others)
  []. DAMPs activate different pattern recognition receptors (PRPs) including for
  example Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and inflammasomes, a process that leads usually
  to inflammation and immune-related pathologies. Interestingly, recent evidence as
  explained in the main text, suggests a direct interactions between different PRPs
  and DNA repair proteins involved in DSB repair and others (Dashed arrow connecting
  DSB to PRPs). Cellular damage or death can also lead to the release of several cytokines
  and chemokines that can regulate immune responses. Activation of PRPs usually results
  in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated release of various proinflammatory cytokines
  like IL-6, IL-8 and others. The activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like
  dendritic cells, macrophages will induce primarily the innate immune response (activation
  of T-cells) and most rarely by B-cells, the adaptive immune response. In all cases,
  the constituent and constant triggering of the immune system is expected to generate
  a variety of systemic effects on the organism and possibly pathophysiology, close
  to the damaged cells often called as “bystander” effects or distant. Overall, for
  the final assessment of radiation effects and the return to the physiological state,
  the role of immune response and the systemic nature of radiation is of enormous
  importance.'
