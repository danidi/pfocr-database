caption: 'Genes and biosynthetic pathway of the E. coli core lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
  required for replication of phages LL5 and LL12. Proteins in the pathway are denoted
  in bold and label each step in biosynthesis. The ability of phages LL5 and LL12
  to form plaques on mutants deficient at each step of the pathway are denoted by
  a green checkmark (forms plaques) or red “X” (does not form plaques) as denoted
  above each protein name. Panel A: The nucleotide sugar precursor ADP L-glycero-β-D-manno-heptose
  is used as a substrate for the transfer of heptose (green in panel B) to the E.
  coli core LPS. ADP L-glycero-β-D-manno-heptose is synthesized from sedoheptulose-7-P
  via a pathway comprised of gmhA, waaE and waaD. Both gmhA and waaE are required
  for growth of phages LL5 and LL12. Panel B: LPS is composed of four distinct domains:
  Lipid A, inner core, outer core and O-antigen. The enzymes responsible for the addition
  of sugar residues and phosphoryl constituents relevant to this study are denoted.
  WaaC, WaaF, WaaQ, WaaG, WaaI and WaaB add hexo or hepto sugar residues to LPS, and
  WaaP and WaaY add phosphoryl substituents to heptose residues I and II, respectively.
  WaaC, WaaP and WaaF are required for plaque formation by phage LL5. WaaC, WaaF and
  WaaG are required by LL12, and absence of WaaP (checkmark and “X”) results in a
  ~50-fold reduction in plating efficiency for phage LL12. Panel A is adapted from
  and panel B from.'
