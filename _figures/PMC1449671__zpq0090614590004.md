caption: Conservation of the NF-κB signaling pathway from horseshoe crab to human.
  In the horseshoe crab (Left), solid and dashed arrows annotate the established and
  suggested pathways. The GNB-activated CrFC initiates the serine protease cascade
  to proteolytically process coagulogen to coagulin (a homologue of Spaetzle), which
  probably binds to the horseshoe crab TLR. Factor C also exists on the hemocyte surface
  as a biosensor for GNB (). Ligand binding to TLR or Factor C on the membrane might
  activate the CrTRAF, a homologue of vertebrate TRAF, and lead to the degradation
  of CrIκB through CrSlimb (), via a Slimb/β-TrCP-mediated proteosome pathway ().
  The released CrNFκB translocates to the nucleus to activate target genes, including
  CrIκB. The newly synthesized CrIκB inhibits the nuclear translocation of CrNFκB,
  creating an autoregulatory pathway (blue arrows). The NF-κB pathway also controls
  the expression of Factor C and CriNOS and probably affects the synthesis of antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs). Similarly, the human p100 homologue, CrRelish, may also be activated
  by pathogen infection. However, whether CrRelish undergoes degradation and functions
  like human p100 remains to be ascertained. The schematic representation of the human
  TLR/NF-κB signaling pathway is shown (Right) (APPs, acute phase proteins) (, ).
  The familiar relationship between the human and horseshoe crab homologues forming
  the NF-κB cascade suggests they probably coevolved.
