caption: Hypothetical scheme of α-T trafficking and hepatic catabolism and disposition.
  MetS-associated inflammation and oxidative damage may decrease (−) or increase (+)
  pathways, which are indicated by dotted lines, to decrease vitamin E status. A portion
  of the dietary α-T is absorbed, and the remainder is excreted in the feces. Enterocytes
  secrete chylomicrons are enriched with α-T and, to a lesser extent, are enriched
  in individuals with MetS (), possibly as a result of enterocytes trapping α-T in
  lipid droplets, which occurs in obese individuals (). The liver takes up the α-T–containing
  chylomicron remnants. Hepatic α-T has several possible fates. α-TTP can facilitate
  α-T’s transfer to VLDL, which is enriched with α-T to a lesser extent in MetS ().
  Secreted VLDL is metabolized to LDL and HDL in the circulation (); all mechanisms
  for lipid delivery to tissues can transport α-T to extrahepatic tissues and facilitate
  its return to the liver (). Plasma α-T disappearance is slower, and α-T enrichment
  in both LDL and HDL occurs to a lesser extent, in adults with MetS (). Hepatic α-T
  can be excreted in bile, but whether this pathway is affected by MetS is unknown.
  However, data from the current study indicate that MetS limits the hepatic metabolism
  of α-T to α-CEHC, which can be secreted in bile for fecal excretion or secreted
  into plasma, transported to the kidney, and excreted in urine, as reviewed by Traber
  (). Alternatively, hepatic α-T can be sequestered in steatotic hepatocytes, which
  is consistent with the observation that MetS patients are frequently afflicted by
  nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (). Hepatic α-T can also be oxidized to the α-T●,
  which is consistent with increased inflammation and oxidative stress in MetS. Overall,
  the limited α-T bioavailability that was observed in the participants with MetS
  in the current study reduced plasma and urinary α-CEHC concentrations, possibly
  by increasing α-T oxidation, increasing α-T, or α-CEHC excretion in feces or trapping
  α-T in lipid droplets in the steatotic liver or enterocyte. CM, chylomicron; MetS,
