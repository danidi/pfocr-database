caption: (A) Host proteins (e.g. transcription factor STAT-2) contain nuclear localisation
  signals which are recognised by IMPα (brown), after the autoinhibitory IMPβ-binding
  (IBB) domain of IMPα binds IMPβ1, forming the IMPα/β heterodimer. This complex is
  then translocated across the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and the cargo is released
  after the binding of Ran-GTP to IMPβ1 dissociates the complex. The cargo can then
  carry out its normal nuclear function, such as transcriptional regulation of the
  antiviral response. (B) During viral infection, specific NLS-containing viral proteins
  (e.g. HIV-1 IN, purple) are imported into the nucleus by the same IMPα/β1 dependent
  mechanism, where they can interfere with normal cellular functions, such as altering
  transcription to antagonise the antiviral response in order to maximise the rate
  of virus production. (C) Ivermectin (pink) binds IMPα, dissociating the IMPα/β1
  heterodimer and preventing binding to its viral (as well as host) protein target(s),
  thereby preventing its nuclear import and downstream transcriptional effects. (D)
  4-HPR (green) specifically binds viral protein DENV2 NS5, preventing binding of
  the IMPα/β1 and nuclear import, and associated downstream effects on transcription
  and splicing.
