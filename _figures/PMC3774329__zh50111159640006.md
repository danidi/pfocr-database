caption: Schematic representation of the interactions between Rho/Rho-kinase signaling
  and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling.
  In SM22-tet-BMPR2R899X mice, the levels of GTP-RhoA and MYPT1 phosphorylation were
  elevated, thus indicating that Rho/Rho-kinase signaling was activated. Two possible
  pathways, namely the Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways, in which BMP/TGF-β
  signaling activated Rho/Rho-kinase signaling are known. We confirmed that the Smad-dependent
  pathway was not altered. We therefore speculate that Rho/Rho-kinase signaling was
  activated via the Smad-independent pathway. Rho-GEF, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor; PP1c, catalytic subunit; M20, a 20-kDa subunit of unknown function; P, inorganic
  phosphate.
