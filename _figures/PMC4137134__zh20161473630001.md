caption: Conceivable transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-initiated cellular events
  leading to myofibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis culminating
  into renal fibrosis. In the canonical pathway, phosphorylated Smad3 interacts with
  Smad4, and the complex translocates into the nucleus to initiate the transcription
  of the targeted genes. Smad3 can also modulate Nox4 to generate ROS, which can activate
  the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway. Finally, TGF-β1 can modulate Rho/Rho kinase (ROCK) activities
  to increase the expression of Nox4, which is further enhanced by polymerase (DNA-directed)
  δ-interacting protein 2 (Poldip2), and the interaction of NOX4:Polydip2 leads to
  the modulation of various cellular processes as well as excessive generation of
  ROS. The latter putative second messengers lead to activation of the ERK1/2 pathway,
  myofibroblast differentiation, and aberrant synthesis of ECM proteins. The existence
  of the latter transduction pathway (Rho/ROCK/Poldip2/Nox4/MEK/ERK1/2) is underscored
  in a study by Manickam et al. (). TGF-βR, TGF-β receptor [types I–III (RI–RIII)];
  GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; α-SMA, α-smooth muscle actin; CTGF, connective
  tissue growth factor.
