caption: Signalling pathway that mediates TRPA1-dependent PMA induced by GTN. (1)
  Systemic GTN is converted to NO by ALDH2 at sites distant to the trigeminal ganglion.
  (2) NO produces via TRPA1- and CGRP-independent mechanisms a rapid and transient
  increase in periorbital blood flow. (3) NO also targets TRPA1 in the soma of trigeminal
  ganglion neurons to evoke a Ca2+-dependent NOX1/NOX2 activation, thereby increasing
  reactive oxygen (H2O2) and carbonylic (4-HNE) species. (4) H2O2 and 4-HNE by an
  apparently autocrine pathway in trigeminal ganglion neurons sustain periorbital
  mechanical allodynia. (5) Activation of the NO/TRPA1/NOX pathway in the soma of
  trigeminal ganglion neurons could possibly (?) generate antidromically-propagated
  action potentials, which ultimately invade cutaneous nerve terminals to promote
  local CGRP release that partially contributes to PMA. Glyceryl trinitrate administration
  causes prolonged mechanical allodynia in rodents, which correlates temporally with
  delayed migraine attacks in patients. Marone et al. show that the allodynia is mediated
  by TRPA1 activation in cell bodies of trigeminal neurons and ensuing oxidative stress.
  This neuronal pathway may be of relevance to migraine-like headaches.
