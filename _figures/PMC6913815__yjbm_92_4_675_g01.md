caption: An overview of the 3 unfolded protein response pathways. ATF6 (left) is translocated
  to the Golgi apparatus after activation and cleaved. The p50 fragment translocates
  to the nucleus where it functions as a transcription factor. IRE1α (middle) undergoes
  dimerization and auto-transphosphorylation when activated. Once phosphorylated,
  IRE1α binds adapter molecules such as TRAF2. Phosphorylation also activates the
  RNase domain, which is capable of splicing a regulatory intron from XBP1 mRNA. The
  spliced XBP1 mRNA then encodes a potent transcription factor, XBP1s. IRE1α also
  decays other mRNAs and undergoes oligomerization (not pictured). PERK (right) undergoes
  dimerization and auto-transphosphorylation when activated as well. Phosphorylated
  PERK can phosphorylate eIF2α, leading to alternative translation of ATF4 mRNA. ATF4
  is a potent transcription factor. Figure generated with Biorender.
