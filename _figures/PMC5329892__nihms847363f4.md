caption: (A) The Malpighian tubule main segment secretes a KCl-rich fluid into the
  lumen (urine). Transepithelial cation transport in the Drosophila Malpighian tubule
  occurs through the principal cell, whereas transepithelial chloride transport occurs
  through the neighboring stellate cells. The apical vacuolar H+-ATPase drives fluid
  secretion (), and generates a lumen-positive transepithelial potential difference
  (). This drives exchange of protons for cations (K+ or Na+, primarily K+ in Drosophila
  renal tubules). Chloride secretion is also driven by the lumen-positive charge.
  The fly NKCC, Ncc69, is required for normal transepithelial K+ flux. Na+ entering
  through the NKCC is recycled by the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (). Cl may also be
  recycled through Cl− channels, or through basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchangers (not
  shown) (; ). The inwardly rectifying potassium channels Irk1 and Irk2 are also required
  for normal transepithelial K+ flux (). (B) The WNK-SPAK/OSR1 (=Fray in flies) pathway
  regulates transepithelial K+ flux in the Drosophila renal tubule principal cell.
  Hypotonic bathing medium stimulates transepithelial K+ flux in a WNK/Fray/NKCC-dependent
  manner.
