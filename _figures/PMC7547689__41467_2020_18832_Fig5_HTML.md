caption: a The chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. The genes encoding key enzymes for
  each step are shown below the arrow. The widths of the edge between TF and gene
  represent regulatory potential based on the TIP model. The 104 TF nodes are represented
  as circles and grouped into 7 modules, with size proportional to the sum of the
  regulatory potential. b The maize photosynthetic carbon pathway. Key genes encoding
  enzymes responsible for CO2 fixation and transport between mesophyll and bundle
  sheath cells are shown. c Heatmap showing the expression gradient of core C4 photosynthesis
  genes in four leaf sections from base to tip, as well as their mesophyll and bundle
  sheath cell-specific expression patterns. d Pale-green leaf and seedling lethal
  phenotypes of the COL8 CRISPR/Cas9 mutant. e Cell-type specific H3K27me3 in core
  C4 gene loci. MC mesophyll cells, BS bundle sheath cells. Source data underlying
  Fig.  are provided in a Source Data file.
