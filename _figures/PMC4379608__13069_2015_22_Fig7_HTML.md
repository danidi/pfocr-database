caption: The involvement of K Ca3.1 in the TGF/Smad 2/3 signalling pathway. A diagrammatic
  representation of how Smad2/3 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation
  is reliant on an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and KCa3.1 ion channels. TGFβ1 stimulation
  triggers an influx of extracellular Ca2+, which in turns opens Ca2+-activated KCa3.1
  K+ channels. KCa3.1 opening maintains a negative membrane which in turn promotes
  Ca2+ entry. Phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and therefore its downstream effects such
  as translocation and gene transcription are heavily reliant on Ca2+. KCa3.1 channel
  inhibition reduces Ca2+ entry, which in turn reduces Smad2/3 phosphorylation and
  nuclear translocation, and thus reduces TGFβ1-dependent gene transcription.

  description: The involvement of K Ca3.1 in the TGF/Smad 2/3 signalling pathway.
    A diagrammatic representation of how Smad2/3 phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear
    translocation is reliant on an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and KCa3.1 ion channels.
    TGFβ1 stimulation triggers an influx of extracellular Ca2+, which in turns opens
    Ca2+-activated KCa3.1 K+ channels. KCa3.1 opening maintains a negative membrane
    which in turn promotes Ca2+ entry. Phosphorylation of Smad2/3 and therefore its
    downstream effects such as translocation and gene transcription are heavily reliant
    on Ca2+. KCa3.1 channel inhibition reduces Ca2+ entry, which in turn reduces Smad2/3
    phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, and thus reduces TGFβ1-dependent gene
    transcription.
