caption: In wild-type CD4+ T-cells, upon stimulation with anti-CD3 (and co-stimulatory
  signal from CD28), the TCR signalsome composed of Lck, ZAP-70, LAT, GADS, SLP76,
  NCK, ITK, VAV1, PAK and PLCγ 1 is formed, recruiting additional proteins such as
  PLCγ 1. PLCγ 1 hydrolyses the lipid mediator PtdIns(4,5)P2 to diacylglycerol (DAG)
  and Ins(1,4,5)P3, leading to induction of Ca2+signalling and the PKCθ signalling
  pathway. The hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is also important for actin remodelling
  by releasing actin-regulating proteins localized at the plasma membrane. Additionally,
  PtdIns(4,5)P2 is phosphorylated by class I PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) to generate
  PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 which also triggers actin remodelling. WASP is recruited to the
  plasma membrane and is activated by PtdIns(4,5)P2 to regulate actin remodelling.
  These pathways synergistically regulate actin remodelling at the plasma membrane
  for mitochondrial translocation and T-cell activation. We have shown previously
  that n – 3 PUFA suppress total and phosphorylated PLCγ 1 translocation to the IS
  (dotted hammerheads signify suppression) [] and mitochondrial translocation to the
  IS []. We now show that n – 3 PUFA, such as DHA, can suppress (i) the basal level
  of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in unstimulated CD4+ T-cells, (ii) the metabolism of PtdIns(4,5)P2
  upon anti-CD3/anti-CD28 or PMA/ionomycin stimulation, (iii) WASP recruitment to
  the IS and (iv) actin remodelling upon anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation. The suppression
  of these early immediate events in T-cell activation leads to inhibition of T-cell
  function, and thus may suppress inflammatory responses.
