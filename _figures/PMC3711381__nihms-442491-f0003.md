caption: Htt affects ERK signaling in multiple ways. The ERK cascade potentiates pro-survival
  mechanisms, i.e. inhibition of apoptosis and transcriptional activation of pro-survival
  genes, in response to various stimuli. Mutant huntingtin activates the ERK pathway
  in a cell-autonomous manner but also interferes with both upstream and downstream
  signaling events. The points at which mutant Htt affects ERK signaling both positively
  and negatively are indicated.
