caption: Diagram of the Hedgehog pathway. Patched-1 transmembrane receptor (Ptch-1)
  is a tumor suppressor that normally inhibits the smoothened receptor (Smo). When
  a Hedgehog protein binds to Ptch-1, this inhibition stops and Smo is activated,
  leading to cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis. Vismodegib binds to and inactivates
  Smo, inhibiting downstream signaling.
