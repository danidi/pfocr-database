number: Figure 1
caption: The Hippo pathway. In response to a variety of stimuli, upstream kinases
  STK4/3 are activated by their interaction with SAV to phosphorylate LATS1/2 and
  MOB1. LATS kinase activity is activated, resulting in phosphorylation of effector
  proteins YAP/TAZ. This results in cytoplasmic sequestration and interaction with
  the chaperone protein, 14-3-3, in the cytoplasm to inhibit its ability to promote
  transcription. Further phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ then occurs via CK1 to result
  in β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. When YAP/TAZ cannot
  be phosphorylated, it resides in the nucleus where it can associate with transcription
  factors, such as Transcriptional Enhanced Associate Domain (TEAD) transcription
  factors, to stimulate transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation, cell
  cycle regulation, prevention of apoptosis, migration and invasion.
