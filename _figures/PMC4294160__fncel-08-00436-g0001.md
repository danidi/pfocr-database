caption: APP metabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Amyloid β precursor protein (APP)
  is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the cell surface
  through endosomes via the trans-Golgi network. At the cell membrane, APP may undergo
  either non-amyloidogenic processing or pro-amyloidogenic processing. If APP undergoes
  non-amyloidogenic processing, it is first cleaved by the α-secretase, and then the
  γ-secretase to produce p3 peptide, which does not form amyloid deposits. If APP
  is cleaved by β-, and then γ-secretase (composed of nicastrin, presenilin 1 [PS1],
  anterior pharynx defective-1 protein [APH-1], and presenilin enhancer 2 [PEN2]),
  then Aβ peptides are produced. Amyloid-β peptides form oligomers, and then fibrils,
  which become insoluble, and eventually deposit into Aβ plaques. While initially
  it was thought that Aβ plaques were the causal pathology in AD, soluble low-n oligomers
  are currently thought to play the initiating role in synaptic dysfunction and neuronal
  cell death.
