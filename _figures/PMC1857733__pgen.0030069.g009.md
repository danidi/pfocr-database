caption: 'In (A–F and E′ and F′), black arrows represent positive inputs and black
  block arrows represent repressor inputs for target gene expression that are functional
  within a given cell type: vulA (A), vulB (B), vulC (C), vulD (D), vulE (E and E′),
  and vulF (F and F′).In (A–D), the larger font size depicts high levels of expression
  of the represented patterning gene within the specified cell type.(E and F) This
  model assumes that the interactions mediated by nhr-67 occur within the vulE and
  vulF cells. Red block arrows (E and F) indicate that a specific regulatory factor
  (nhr-67 in vulF and cog-1 in vulE) acts as a major repressor within the specified
  cell type. (E′ and F′) This alternate model presumes that nhr-67 acts in the AC
  to differentiate between vulE and vulF cells. Signal X could be Ras, Wnt, or some
  other signaling pathway. Red block arrows (E′ and F′) indicate that the activity
  associated with a specific regulatory factor (nhr-67 in vulF and cog-1 in vulE)
  plays a major role in patterning gene expression with in the specified cell type.(G)
  A color-coded summary of the distinct expression patterns of lin-11 (red), cog-1
  (blue), and nhr-67 (green). Each box represents one of the seven vulval cell types.
  The colored boxes with the graded pattern represent rare weak expression of the
  transcriptional reporter, whereas boxes with solid colors represent robust expression.
  Colored arrows and block arrows are used to document all the identified regulatory
  interactions that occur during L4 patterning in the diverse vulval cell types: lin-11
  (red), cog-1(blue), egl-38 (brown), and nhr-67 (green). This model illustrates multiple
  patterning differences between the seven mature vulval cell types.'
