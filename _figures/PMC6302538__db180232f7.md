caption: Model for regulation of BMSCs by the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway and disruption in
  diabetes. In steady state, activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway preserves redox
  metabolism, multipotency, and associated features of BMSCs. Nrf2 drives transcription
  of antioxidants, metabolic modulators, and Sox2 to maintain low ROS in BMSCs and
  maintain multipotency. In diabetes, loss of Nrf2-driven transcription, and therefore
  high intracellular ROS, promotes expression of adipogenic genes and leads to commitment
  of BMSCs to an adipogenic fate.
