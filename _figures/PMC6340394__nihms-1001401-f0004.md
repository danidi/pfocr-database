caption: The Notch pathway generates a short-range communication channel utilized
  throughout skin development and elsewhere in the adult to regulate multiple cellular
  processes (e.g., proliferation, stem cell and stem cell niche maintenance, cell
  fate specification, differentiation and cell death). Notch signals in a unique mechanism
  mediated by proteolysis and without any secondary messengers. Post-translational
  modifications and trafficking of the ligands and receptors can regulate the amplitude
  and timing of Notch activity. 1–2) Receptor Maturation. Upon translation, the Notch
  protein is fucosylated by the Pofut1. The fucose can be extended by the glycosyltransferase
  activity of Fringe. This impacts the ability of specific ligands to activate Notch
  (see below). During exocytosis the Notch receptor is cleaved by PC5, a protein convertase,
  at Site 1 (S1). At the cell surface Notch is a heterodimer (HD) held together by
  non-covalent interactions within the HD domain which, together with three Lin-Notch
  repeats (LNR) forms the negative regulatory region (NRR). 2) The steady-state levels
  of the Notch receptor at the cell surface are regulated by several proteins, many
  of which are E3 ubiquitin ligases (Dtx, Nedd4). After recycling, inappropriate receptor
  activation within endosomes can occur in the absence of ligand binding (NICD*).
  The ESCRT complex proteins are involved in Notch down-regulation, and mutations
  in this complex may contribute to pathogenesis in different cellular contexts. 3)
  Ligand maturation. Notch ligands are also Type I transmembrane proteins. The two
  major classes of ligands are Delta and Jagged (Serrate in Drosophila), the latter
  containing a cysteine rich domain. To signal, ligands must undergo ubiquitinylation
  by E3 ubiquitin ligases Neur and Mib which trigger Epsin-mediated endocytosis, and
  an undefined modification produces an active ligand which recycles to the cell surface
  in a Rab11 dependent process. Current models explaining the nature of ligand modification
  include ligand clustering, post-translational modifications and/or recycling into
  specific membrane domains. 4–6) Activation. Productive receptor-ligand interactions
  occur between neighboring cells (in TRANS) whereas negative interactions occur between
  receptor-ligand proteins coexpressed in the same cell (in CIS). Fringe-modified
  Notch1 receptors favor Delta binding (shown). Ligand endocytosis is thought to generate
  sufficient force to unfold the NRR, exposing Notch to cleavage at site S2 by ADAM10
  metalloproteases. The membrane-anchored NEXT (Notch extracellular truncation) fragment
  is recognized by γ-secretase, an enzymatic complex composed of PS, NCT, PEN2 and
  APH1. γ-secretase then cleaves the Notch transmembrane domain sequentially starting
  near the cytosolic surface (sites S3 and S4) to release the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) and Nβ peptides, respectively. 5) In the absence of NICD, the DNA-binding
  protein CSL associates with ubiquitous co-repressor (Co-R) proteins, HDACs and Sirt1
  to repress transcription of target genes. NICD binding to CSL recruits the adaptor
  protein Mastermind (MAM), which recruits the mediator complex and assembles an active
  transcription complex on target promoters. 6) During the transcriptional activation
  process, NICD is phosphorylated on its PEST domain by kinases such as CDK8 and targeted
  for proteasomal degradation by E3 ubiquitin ligases such as Sel10/Fbw7. This terminates
  the Notch signal and resets the cell for the next round of signaling. This figure
