caption: During MS, lymphocytes infiltrate into the brain and recognize their antigen,
  usually myelin-derived antigen presented by an APC (A). These activated T cells
  then release pro-inflammatory cytokines that act on oligodendrocytes (B), leading
  to the demyelination that is a hallmark of the disease. This diagram focuses mainly
  on other events that may be involved in MS neurodegeneration. Atg5 is an important
  component of the autophagy pathway, and its cleavage can switch a cell’s fate from
  autophagy (and survival) to apoptosis (and death) (). In our recent paper () we
  showed that peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of some MS patients contained an elevated
  level of Atg5, leading us to speculate that these potentially-pathogenic cells may
  have prolonged lifespans (C). B cells and plasma cells, too, have been implicated
  in MS (D). The pro-inflammatory mediators that are released by activated lymphocytes
  and / or microglia (E) can activate astrocytes (F), reducing their capacity of resorb
  glutamate (G). The resulting increase in extracellular glutamate triggers AMPA receptors
  (H) which leads to an influx of Ca2+ into the neurons (). This initiates a cascade
  of events including damage to mitochondria (I), an increase in ROS (J), activation
  of caspases and calpain, and a decrease in number of neurite autophagosomes (K).
  The ultimate outcome is neurodegeneration (L).
