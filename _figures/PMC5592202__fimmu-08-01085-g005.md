caption: Schematic drawing of the efferent signaling pathway of the inflammatory reflex
  in the context of the cholinergic system in immune cells. ChAT+ T cell interaction
  with antigen peptides loaded on MHC class II on dendritic cells (DCs) or macrophages
  via the TCR/CD3 complex, CD80/CD86 (B7) co-stimulatory molecules with CD28, and
  ICAM-1/ICAM-2 with LFA-1, increases the synthesis and release of ACh from T cells
  [see a review by Fujii et al. ()]. Inflammatory mediators induce the release of
  the positive allosteric α7 nAChR ligand SLURP-1 from SP/CGRP-containing sensory
  fibers. Efferent inflammatory reflex signaling via the vagus nerve may also induce
  released SLURP-1 from SP+/CGRP+ fibers in the spleen. This released SLURP-1, as
  well as SLURP-1 released from CD205+ mature DCs, potentiates the action of ACh from
  ChAT+ CD4+ T cells at α7 nAChRs on macrophages, thereby suppressing synthesis and
  release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. The model proposed here is from reviews
  by Kawashima et al. () and Fujii et al. (). Green rectangles depict SLURP-1. Red
  ellipses depict acetylcholine. AcCoA, acetyl coenzyme A; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion
  molecule-1; ICAM-2, intercellular adhesion molecule-2; LFA-1, lymphocyte function-associated
  antigen-1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MHC II, major histocompatibility complex class
  II; SLURP-1, secreted lymphocyte antigen-6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator
  receptor-related peptide-1; TCR, T cell receptor; TLR, toll-like receptor.
