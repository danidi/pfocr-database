caption: The susceptible organs and pathways to stress. The red symbols and black
  arrows imply in distress (electrical foot shock) footprints while the green ones
  represent IF (Intermittent fasting) traces. Both distress and eustress messages
  have the joint targets in the body. They are also received and processed by brain.
  The processed distress signals activate (pro) inflammatory responses and stimulate
  adrenal glands to over-express corticosterone (CORT) and the committed immune cells
  to upregulate interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). IL-6
  can also trigger () TNF-α-induced macrophages. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)
  axis is the main targets of these secreted cytokines and subsequent CORT overexpression,
  adrenal glands hypertrophy and loss of spatial learning and memory. As it has been
  shown in the figure, the activated sites by distress can potentially suppress via
  IF () and finally lead to amelioration of cognitive function.
