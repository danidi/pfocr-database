caption: A meiotic recombination checkpoint response can inhibit DNA rereplication.
  This diagram based on our genetic analysis depicts certain key protein components
  in a pathway that leads from accumulation of unrepaired DSBs to inhibition of DNA
  rereplication in the SIC1∆PHA system. Also shown is an outline of the pathways that
  prevent intersister repair and meiotic progression in the normal checkpoint. See
  text for details.
