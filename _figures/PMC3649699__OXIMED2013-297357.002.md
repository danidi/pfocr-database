caption: 'Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion activates two major signaling pathways which
  exert an effect on NOD. (A) NF-κB pathway. Oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory
  stimuli phosphorylate NIK. Subsequently, IKK phosphorylates NIK, which in turn phosphorylates
  IkB, resulting in Iκb degradation and NF-κB translocation and activation. This action
  exerts different effects depending on the cell line. In endothelial cells, NF-κB
  promotes a proinflammatory phenotype, with the expression of cellular adhesion molecules
  and proinflammatory cytokines that induce leukocyte migration to the ischemic territory
  and promote acute inflammation. In glial cells, NF-κB leads to the expression of
  iNOS, COX-2, and proinflammatory cytokines. These effects contribute to nitrosative,
  oxidative, and inflammatory damage. Finally, in neurons, NF-κB induces the expression
  of apoptosis pathways. NOD can act at different levels in this pathway: NOD-derived
  NO diffuses across target cell membranes, where it is able to nitrosylate kinases
  located upstream of NF-κB, such as IKK, thereby suppressing their ability to phosphorylate
  []. This inhibition prevents Iκb phosphorylation and its degradation; thus the release
  of NF-κB. NO can also increase Iκb gene transcription and stabilize the complex
  formed by Iκb and NF-κB []. Furthermore, NOD-derived NO is capable of nitrosylating
  directly into the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB, which blocks their ability to migrate
  to the nucleus []. All of these actions prevent the nuclear translocation of NF-κB,
  therefore the expression of their target genes []. (B) Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion
  increases nNOS activity, which enhances its NO production. This NO can react with
  free radicals to produce ONOO− and also activates the JNK3 pathway. The result is
  c-Jun phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction, with an increase in Bcl2 phosphorylation
  and cytochrome C release into the cytoplasm. In addition, this activates caspase-3
  and leads to neuronal apoptosis. NOD-derived NO downregulates neuronal apoptosis
  by inhibiting increased phosphorylation of JNK, c-Jun, and Bcl-2 []. This is achieved
  by S-nitrosylation of nNOS, which interferes with its NO production []. NO is also
  capable of nitrosylating caspase-3 directly []. All of these effects, along with
  an increase in CBF, reduce brain damage after the ischemia-reperfusion event. Bcl2,
