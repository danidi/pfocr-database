caption: Parasites escape host autophagy destruction. (I) A hypothetical model of
  Toxoplasma controlling host autophagy by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-Akt
  signaling pathway. MIC protein is released from micronemes upon invasion. MIC3 and
  MIC6 bind to the host EGFR through the EGF-like domain and are activated by phosphorylation.
  Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-induced Akt phosphorylation and Akt-dependent
  activation of mTORC1 block the autophagy pathway and signify T. gondii to survive.
  (II) During the invasion of host cells, RON4 expression was associated with focal
  adhesion kinase (FAK) activation. In turn, FAK activates Src leading to the transactivation
  of EGFR in a Src-dependent way. Furthermore, the STAT3 signaling pathway is facilitated
  to prevent PKR and eIF2a from activation. Blocking the signaling causes the activation
  of PKR and eIF2a, resulting in autophagic targeting and the killing of parasite.
  At later stages of the intracellular stage of T. gondii, autophosphorylation of
  EGFR is maintained through PKCα/PKCβ-Src signaling. (III) The complex of GRA7 and
  ROP18-ROP17-ROP5 phosphorylates IFN-γ-activated IRGs and GBPs permanently inactivates
  them to ensure the integrity of PVM and is conducive to the survival of parasite.
