caption: The HP diet induced alterations in the hepatic expression of enzymes involved
  in lipid catabolism and biosynthesis. Enzymes and factors whose mRNA expression
  is higher and lower in the livers of HP diet-fed rats are shown in red and blue,
  respectively, in comparison to their expression in the livers of control diet-fed
  rats. See  for DEGs related to lipid metabolism. Up- and down-regulated pathways
  are represented with red and blue arrows, respectively. PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty
  acid; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
