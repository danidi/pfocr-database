caption: 'Left panel: Detailed pathway of ceramide biosynthesis and utilization. The
  pathway consists of three major subsystems: synthesis and utilization of DHC (left
  column), synthesis and utilization of PHC (right column), and fatty acid elongation
  and desaturation (center column). V1, V6, V11, V16, V21, V26, V30, V34, V38 and
  V42 represent fluxes catalyzed by ceramide synthase. V3, V8, V13, V18, V23, and
  V28, V32, V36, V40 and V44 represent fluxes catalyzed by dihydroceramidase and phytoceramidase,
  respectively. Reactions exiting the system to the left or right, namely V5, V10,
  V15, V20, V25, V29, V33, V37, V41 and V45, represent fluxes catalyzed by IPC synthase,
  while reactions entering the system from the left or right, V2, V7, V12, V17, V22,

  reactions catalyzed by other enzymes, such as remodelase (V46), fatty acid elongases
