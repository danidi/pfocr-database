caption: a The TME of solid tumors has the common characteristic of hypoxia (1% O2),
  which is due to a low supply of nutrients and oxygen. Hypoxia induces HIF-1α expression
  in tumor cells. This, in turn, acts on transcriptional factors, inhibiting the expression
  of AK, which performs the conversion of Ado into AMP, and favoring the expression
  of the enzymes CD39 and CD73, which act on cell membrane, converting ATP to AMP,
  and then to Ado, respectively. The increase of Ado in the extracellular medium by
  the action of CD73 causes a greater activation of ARs and promotes immunosuppression
  in the TME, making the control of the CD73 actions a therapeutic target. Low glucose
  levels and low pH, as well as cytokines, such as TGF-β, IFNs, and TNF-α, positively
  influence CD73 activity. Anti-CD73 mAb and shRNA for CD73 control and inhibit CD73
  activity. b The activation of the A1 receptor in an ER positive BC cell line (MCF-7)
  promotes reduction in the number of caspases and in the regulatory protein of the
  cell cycle p53, favoring the survival of these tumor cells. However, in this same
  cell line, activation of the A3 receptor, which can occur by agonists such as Ado
  and CI-BI-MECA, promotes (1) the decrease in the activity of the ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway, decreasing the number of complexes cyclin D1-CDK4, which are related to
  cell cycle progression; (2) regulation of the Bax/Bcl2 pathway, causing an increase
  in the level of caspases-6; and (3) decrease in the activity of the Hedgehog signaling
  pathway. Performance through these three pathways will promote cell death. c The
  activation of A2A and A2B receptors in the endothelial cells of the TME promotes
  an increase in VEGF and in the bFGF, favoring angiogenesis. d In an ER negative
  BC cell line (MDA-MB-231), activation of A2B receptors by Ado regulates the Raf/MEK/ERK
  pathways, producing an increase in ERK1/2, FOXM1, c-Myc proteins, which are involved
  in the cell cycle control. Furthermore, stimulation of this receptor leads to an
  increase in AC, which promotes an increase in intracellular levels of cAMP, which
  activates PKA. Both A2B pathways will promote the survival, proliferation, and migration
  of tumor cells
