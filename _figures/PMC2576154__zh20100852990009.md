caption: Proposed mechanisms by which BK channels mediate β-adrenergic relaxation
  in UBSM cells with illustrations of the differential outcomes following channel
  pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation in the WT (top) and the BK-KO mouse
  (bottom), respectively. In UBSM cells from WT mice, functionally active BK channels
  regulate Ca2+ entry via L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels, and thus contractility
  (top). In addition, BK channels are under the local control of the so-called “Ca2+
  sparks” caused by Ca2+ release from the ryanodine receptors of the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum, adjacent to the cell membrane (, ). After permanent BK channel gene deletion
  in the BK-KO mouse, an adaptive compensatory upregulation of the β-adrenergic receptor
  (β-AR)-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway develops. The enhanced β-AR/PKA activity compensates
  for the increased Ca2+ entry via L-type CaV channels that occurs due to sustained
  membrane depolarization in the absence on the BK channels. AC, adenylyl cyclase;
  Gs, stimulatory G protein; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PLB, phospholamban;
  RyR, ryanodine receptor; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum.
