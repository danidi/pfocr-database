caption: Regulation of rDNA amplification in response to caloric excess. Replication
  forks stalled at the replication fork barrier that have undergone cleavage (Center
  top) can enter the HR-dependent BIR pathway or the non-HR-dependent amplification
  pathway, which is repressed by Hst3 and Hst4. The BIR pathway can result in nondirectional
  copy number variation or amplification, but copy number variation through this pathway
  is repressed by Sir2. In response to excess nutrients, TOR signaling represses Sir2,
  Hst3, and Hst4 through suppression of PNC1 expression, but also represses Sir2 and
  potentially Hst3/Hst4 through a Pnc1-independent mechanism, leading to copy number
  amplification.
