caption: Under normal conditions, the membrane protein LOX1 functions as a receptor
  involved in endocytosis, and its activity is low. Three subunits (p65, p50, and
  phosphorylated IkBα) bind together to form a NF-κB complex. Phosphorylation of the
  p-IKK complex, which is induced by LOX1 receptor activation, causes phosphorylation
  of IkBα, resulting in disassociation of p65 from the IkBα complex. The released
  p65 is then transported into the nucleus, where it binds to the kB site in the promoter
  region of the NF-κB gene to regulate its expression and enhance expression of the
  CASP9 gene (Supplementary Figure S1). The phosphorylation of p-IKKβ and p-IkBα,
  the nuclear translocation of p65, and expression of caspase-9 remain at basal levels.
  However, high glucose (HG) or STZ-treatment might induce the overactivation of LOX1,
  and thereby dramatically increase the overexpression of phosphorylated p-IKKβ and
  p-IkBα. This leads to an increase in free p65 and its robust nuclear translocation,
  as well as its increased binding to the CASP9 gene and resultant overexpression
  of caspase-9 protein. Consequently, both HG- and STZ-treatment can induce high apoptotic
  rates in vitro and in vivo. Because there is a binding site for TKL on LOX1, and
  the inhibitory effects of TKL on p-IKKβ and p-IkBα expression, p65 nuclear translocation,
  and the subsequent expression of caspase-9 are dose dependent, all those effects
  are independent of LOX1 expression. In contrast, a down-regulation of LOX1 expression
  induced by Poly IC can significantly counteract TKL’s protective effects against
  HG or STZ. These results indicate that TKL most likely exerts its protective effect
  by regulating LOX1 activity, although the possibility of LOX1-mediated TKL endocytosis
  cannot be ruled out.
