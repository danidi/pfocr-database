caption: '(A) Flux directions between glycolysis and the PP pathway. (B) Relative
  flux of the PP pathway (R5P from either G6P or G3P/S7P). (C) Relative flux of the
  PP pathway (E4P vs. P5P). (D) Relative flux of the glycolytic pathway (PEP through
  the PP pathway). Metabolic flux ratios between glycolysis and the PP pathway of
  wild-type (black: top values), fbp1Δ (blue: mid-upper values), hst3Δ hst4Δ sir2Δ
  (green: mid-lower values) and hst3Δ hst4Δ sir2Δ fbp1Δ (red: bottom values) cells
  during exponential growth on glucose. Relative flux in converging pathways (in %)
  as determined using FiatFlux for two nodes and one enzyme reaction in central carbon
  metabolism. The values are expressed as the means ± standard deviations. The minus
  values represent reverse flux in metabolic reaction. The values in the solid box
  were directly inferred from the analysis of local 13C patterns, whereas the other
  values are the calculated complements. The experiments were repeated twice. A representative
  experiment is shown. G6P: glucose 6-phosphate, G3P: glycerol 3-phosphate, PEP: phosphoenolpyruvate,
  R5P: ribose 5-phosphate, E4P: erythrose 4-phosphate, S7P: sedoheptulose 7-phosphate,
  ub: upper bounds, PP pathway: pentose phosphate pathway.'
