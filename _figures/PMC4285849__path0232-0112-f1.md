caption: Impact of IBD genetic polymorphisms on dendritic cell function. Polymorphisms
  in IBD susceptibility genes in dendritic cells can be broadly categorized as either
  inhibiting the ability to effectively clear pathogens or contributing to excessive
  immune response. Dendritic cells play an important role in autophagy and presentation
  of bacterial antigens. SNPs associated with this pathway, including Nod2 and ATG16L1,
  can contribute to failure to deal with pathogens. Additionally, dectin-1 is important
  for the clearance of fungal pathogens by enabling dendritic cell recognition of
  β-1,3-glucans in fungal cell walls. A number of IBD susceptibility genes are linked
  to the excessive immune response which is characteristic of both Crohn's disease
  and ulcerative colitis. Nod2 in dendritic cells is upstream of MAPK and NF-κB, which
  are important regulators of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Impaired regulation of the
  inflammatory response caused by polymorphisms in Nod2, IL12B or TNFSF15 may result
  in excessive and prolonged pro-inflammatory T-cell responses. In addition, dendritic
  cells regulate the immune response through production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-10. SNPs in IL-10 may result in loss of regulatory T cells, leading to excessive
  immune response.
