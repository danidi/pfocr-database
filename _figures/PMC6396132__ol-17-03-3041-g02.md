caption: Hedgehog signaling and Wnt signaling in the primary cilium. The binding of
  hedgehog to Ptch1 results in Ptch1 inhibition and Smo accumulation as Ptch1 negatively
  regulates Smo. The accumulation of Smo leads to the activation of Gli family members
  and the inhibition of Gli repressors, eventually leading to cell proliferation.
  If the primary cilium is absent, Smo is incapable of activating Gli proteins leading
  to dysfunctional hedgehog signaling and increasing the possibility of cancer formation
  and development. Activation of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway by the stimulation
  of Frizzled3 results in the inhibition of Dsh by Inversin, this inhibits β-catenin
  accumulation and ensures the maintenance of planar cell polarity. When the primary
  cilium is lost, it is possible that a switch from non-canonical to canonical Wnt
  signaling could occur, leading to β-catenin accumulation, the loss of PCP and uncontrolled
  cell proliferation.
