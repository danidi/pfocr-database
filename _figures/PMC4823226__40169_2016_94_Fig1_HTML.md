caption: Schematic of energy metabolism dysfunction promoting carcinogenic risks and
  cancer development. Different types of environmental factors (physical, chemical
  and biological factors) could act on cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment.
  Cancer cells usually show aerobic glycolysis and abnormal signal pathway regulations.
  Pentose phosphate pathway can be upregulated to increasing the amount of NADPH and
  ribose-5-phoshate, which are used for energy generation and DNA replication, as
  well as counteracting proportion of ROS for protecting cancer cells from oxidative
  stress. The inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation at the same time can result
  in the accumulation of lactate and the acid microenvironment. Moreover, several
  signal pathways, such as the Akt-mTOR signal pathway and the HIF signal pathway,
  are involved in the dysfunction of energy metabolism and can co-active a hypoxic
  tumor microenvironment
