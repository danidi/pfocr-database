caption: Inverse relationship between canonical and non-canonical Hedgehog signaling
  in colon cancer stem cell (CSC) differentiation. Hedgehog signaling in colon cancer
  is SHH dependent and both autocrine and paracrine signaling occurs. In canonical
  Hedgehog signaling, SHH binds to its receptor PTCH1 to relieve it from its repression
  of SMO, which then activates a downstream signaling pathway that results in the
  activation of GLI. GLI proteins then translocate to the nucleus where they regulate
  the transcription of target genes that lead to the inhibition of Wnt signaling and
  tumor cell differentiation. Binding of SHH to PTCH1 in colon CSCs results in SMO-independent
  GLI-independent non-canonical Hedgehog, which acts as a positive regulator of Wnt
  signaling to block CSC differentiation.
