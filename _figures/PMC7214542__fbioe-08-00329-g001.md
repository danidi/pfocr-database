caption: 'Regulatory and catabolic pathways for glucose and xylose metabolism in E.
  coli. The primary mechanism for glucose transport in E. coli is through the phosphoenolpyruvate:
  sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS), including components EIIBCGlc, EIIAGlc, Hpr,
  and EI (encoded by ptsG, crr, ptsH, and ptsI, respectively). Under high glucose
  concentrations, glucose is transported via EIICBGlc, leading to more abundant unphosphorylated
  EIICAGlc that inhibits adenylate cyclase (AC) and lowers cAMP levels. Glucose-induced
  catabolite repression is mainly caused by low levels of cAMP which leads to non-functional
  CRP. Without CRP activation, the transcriptional activation of xylose catabolism
  pathways cannot be achieved. Under low glucose concentrations, AC is active due
  to the decreased amount of unphosphorylated EIICAGlc, thus leading to increased
  cAMP levels and activated CRP. Both activated CRP and XylR (activated when bound
  by xylose) are required to activate the xylose catabolic operons, xylAB and xylFGH.
  Phosphorylated sugar intermediates enter glycolysis or PPP pathways for full degradation.
  GalP functions as an alternative non-PTS glucose transporter and glk encodes cytoplasmic
  glucokinase to phosphorylate glucose for further glycolysis. Glucose uptake systems
  including both PTS components and GalP as well as Glk and XylR indicated in red
  ovals are genetic engineering targets to construct sugar specialists. Abbreviation:
  AC, adenylate cyclase; CRP, cAMP receptor protein; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  Glc, glucose; Glc-6P, glucose 6-phosphate; Xyl; xylose.'
