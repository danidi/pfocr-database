caption: '(Adapted from []) The enzymes LpxA, LpxC, and LpxD are located in the cytoplasm,
  whereas LpxH, LpxB, LpxK, WaaA, LpxL and LpxM are anchored to the inner membrane.
  Substrates for the biosynthetic are highlighted in green: acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound
  acyl donors, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), ATP, and CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic
  acid (CMP-Kdo). The product of the pathway is further modified into variable lipopolysaccharide
  structures via further glycosylation of the Kdo sugars (not explicitly shown).'
