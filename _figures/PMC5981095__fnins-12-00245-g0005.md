caption: General schematic of terminal translocation and differentiation in the CP
  during development. Within the CP SEP neurons (green) have high expression of Cux2
  and low expression of β-catenin, whereas REP neurons (red) have high expression
  of β-catenin and low expression of Cux2. Satb1 positive cells express in the superficial
  layers of the MZ, which overlap with Tbr1 expression. Terminal translocation and
  therefore lamination rely on regulation by FoxG1 for the SEP neurons and radial
  distribution of Satb2 expressing REP neurons is regulated by Robo1. FoxG1 on deep-layer
  progenitors through transcription switches their progeny to upper-layer neurons
  through repression of Tbr1. After exiting the cell cycle, Satb2-expressing cells
  immediately migrate to the upper layers of the cortical plate. Satb2 expressing
  cells are much more reliant on the reelin/Dab1 and Ephrin-A pathways for cortical
  migration. Reelin binds to the RGCs by VLDLR and Apoer2 receptors (Lane-Donovan
  and Herz, ), which causes the adaptor protein Dab1 to become phosphorylated. Upon
  phosphorylation by SFKs, Dab1 recruits various downstream molecules including PI3K
  and Lis1. E2 is able to inhibit VLDLR/ApoER, modulates reelin's mechanisms in cortical
  migration. Reelin's interaction with cadherin is also essential for the termination
  of migration. Through regulating terminal translocation, the reelin/Dab1/Rap1/N-Cadherin
  signaling pathway leads to the inside-out lamination of the cortex. Nectin molecules
  expressed in the Cajal-Retzius cell (Nectin1) and the migrating neuron (Nectin3)
  are also necessary for somal translocation. The initiation of detachment is signaled
  by SC1, which is expressed on the surface at the top and bottom of RGCs surfaces.
  The anti-adhesive signal is crucial to proper cortical development, as the absence
  of SC1 results in failure of neurons to detach and properly position. Dab1 interacts
  with Cullin5 in the migrating cell to accumulate in the appropriate cortical layer.
  Termination of polarization upon reaching the appropriate location is met by the
  degradation of reelin receptors, N-cadherin and Dab1 by exocytosis and endocytosis.
