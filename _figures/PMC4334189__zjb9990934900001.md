caption: Metabolic pathway for two-carbon metabolism. Three known fates of beta-methylmalyl-CoA
  are shown. Genes encoding pathway enzymes are shown in gray. mauFBEDACJGLMN, methylamine
  dehydrogenases; aldB, aldehyde dehydrogenase; alo, aldehyde oxidase; acsA, acetyl-CoA
  synthase; phaA, β-ketothiolase; phaB, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; croR, crotonase;
  ccr, crotonyl-CoA reductase/carboxylase; epi, ethylmalonyl-CoA/methylmalonyl-CoA
  epimerase; ecm, ethylmalonyl-CoA mutase; msd, methylsuccinyl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  mcd, mesaconyl-CoA hydratase; mclA1 and mclA2, β-methylmalyl-CoA lyases; mcl2, malyl-CoA
  thioesterase; pccAB, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; mcm, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; sct,
  succinyl-CoA transferase; sga, serine-glyoxylate aminotransferase; gcv, glycine
  cleavage system; glyA, serine hydroxymethyltransferase. The asterisk indicates that
  genes for the conversion of serine to 2-phosphoglycerate are not shown. Genes in
  parentheses denote a predicted function not confirmed by the mutant phenotype. amcy,
  amicyanin; me-H4F, methylene tetrahydrofolate; PHB, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate cycle;
  FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; FADH, reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide.
