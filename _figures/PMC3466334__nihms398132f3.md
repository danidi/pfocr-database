caption: '(A) Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and fumarate hydratase (FH) are TCA cycle
  enzymes and tumor suppressors. In normal cells, succinate and fumarate are generated
  through oxidative metabolism of glutamine-derived α-KG (gray arrows). Subsequent
  metabolism around the TCA cycle generates citrate for lipid synthesis. SDH and FH
  deficiency interrupt this pathway, with accumulation of succinate and fumarate,
  respectively. FH-deficient cells redirect TCA cycle metabolism in two ways (red
  arrows). First, the cells shunt succinyl-CoA into a pathway of heme biosynthesis
  and degradation, culminating in the secretion of bilirubin. Inhibiting Heme Oxygenase-1
  (HMOX1) in this pathway selectively kills cells with FH deficiency. Second, in order
  to produce citrate, the cells use reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived α-KG.
  IDH1 and/or IDH2 participate in this reaction, and subsequent metabolism of citrate
  produces acetyl-CoA for fatty acid/lipid synthesis, and other TCA cycle intermediates
  like oxaloacetate and malate, which are normally produced downstream of FH. (B)
  Keap1 is an electrophile sensor. In the absence of fumarate and other electrophiles,
  Keap1 negatively regulates the transcription factor Nrf2, targeting it for degradation.
  In FH-deficient cells, cysteine residues on Keap1 are modified by fumarate-dependent
  succination, in which cysteine is converted to S-(2-succinyl)-cysteine. Nrf2, now
  active, can activate the transcription of genes involved in the antioxidant response.
