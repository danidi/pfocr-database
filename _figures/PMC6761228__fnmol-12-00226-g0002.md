caption: Negative feedback loops are a common feature of gene networks. Negative feedback
  can drive oscillatory gene expression depending on the gene’s unique expression
  dynamics (time delay from transcription to translation, protein and mRNA half-lives,
  and efficiency of miRNA and proteasome degradation pathways). (A) Notch signaling
  activates expression of the Hes1 gene, causing gradual accumulation of Hes1 mRNA.
  Since there is a delay between Hes1 RNA transcription and translation, Hes1 mRNA
  levels will initially be much higher than Hes1 protein levels. But because Hes1
  protein negatively regulates its own production by binding to, and blocking, the
  Hes1 promoter, growing Hes1 protein levels cause Hes1 mRNA production to fall. The
  instability of Hes1 mRNA (degraded via a miRNA pathway) contributes to further Hes1
  mRNA decline. Increasing Hes1 protein levels continue to dampen Hes1 transcription
  until it ceases altogether. But since Hes1 proteins are also unstable (degraded
  via the 26S proteasome pathway), Hes1 protein levels eventually reach a maximum
  and then begin to decline, allowing renewed Hes1 transcription. The delay between
  Hes1 transcription and mature Hes1 protein production enables Hes1 protein levels
  to fall while Hes1 mRNA levels rise again. Repetition of this cycle drives Hes1’s
  oscillatory expression dynamics. It should be noted that Hes1 mRNA and protein levels
  oscillate with a phase shift in regards to each other. (B) The aforementioned mechanism
  of Hes1’s oscillatory expression may be applied to all genes whose expression is
  inhibited by Hes1 (Neurog2, Ascl1, Atoh7, Otx2, etc.; depicted here as gene X).
  Thus, expression of such genes should also oscillate. In this regard, if the expression
  of gene X oscillates, then the expression of genes activated by gene X (gene Y;
  e.g., Neurog2 and Ascl1 activate Dll1 expression) may also oscillate. The oscillatory
  expression of genes X and Y should be phase-shifted with respect to each other since
  products of gene X (mRNA and protein) must first be present to initiate the expression
  of Y.
