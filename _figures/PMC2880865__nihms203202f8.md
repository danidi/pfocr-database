caption: Model of revitalization of a diastemal bud. A drawing of a posterior diastemal
  bud (R2) at ED 13.5 with a signaling center (gray) at its tip (compare with ). Growth
  inhibitors (e.g. BMP) and growth activators (e.g. SHH, Wnt10, FGF3, FGF4, FGF10,
  EDA) are distinguished by colors, as in legend (compare with ). We propose that
  FGF signaling from the mesenchyme can induce expression of FGF4, SHH and EDA, perhaps
  by the stimulation of the Wnt/LEF1 pathway, and SPRY2 can antagonize this cascade.
  In wild-type diastemal buds, Spry2 is expressed, the growth-activation pathway is
  blocked and bud growth is stopped by a relative prevalence of growth inhibitors.
  The mitotic index is decreased and apoptosis occurs in the epithelium (crosses).
  In Spry2 mutants, development of the rudimentary bud is not arrested. In contrast
  to WT embryos, apoptosis is decreased in the rudimentary bud, whereas its mitotic
  index is as high as in the molar region. Determination of the extent of the contribution
  of the R2 rudiment to the supernumerary tooth will require future studies. This
  model is based on findings reported in this study and on previously reported studies
  (; , ; ; ; ; ; ; ). ED, embryonic day; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; FGF, fibroblast
  growth factor; SHH, Sonic hedgehog; EDA, ectodysplasin; SPRY, sprouty; LEF, lymphoid
  enhancer binding factor.
