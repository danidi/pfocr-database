caption: In the absence of cytokines or growth factors, the stress-induced PI3K-AKT
  pathway and the p53 pathway are activated. Downregulation of PI3K and AKT through
  inhibition by PTEN leads to translocation of dephosphorylated FOXO3A into the nucleus.
  Nuclear FOXO3A activates several pro-apoptotic genes (PUMA, BIM, SESN1, TNFRSF10B,
  CDKN1B, CITED2) and represses CCND2 (a cell cycle gene) by direct transcriptional
  control. Modulation of these FOXO3A targets then leads to cell cycle arrest and
  apoptosis. On the other hand, activation of p53 further represses AKT via induction
  of PTEN, and also leads to a cascade of expression changes in several apoptosis
  genes. Activation of p21 and the two GADD45 genes leads to cell cycle arrest at
  the G1 and G2 phases respectively. Ligation of TRAIL with TNFRSF10B (TRAILR) and
  activation of FAS on the surface of Tregs triggers the extrinsic apoptosis pathway,
  leading to the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and activation of the
  caspase cascade. This complex signaling involving cytokine-deprivation mediated
  activation of both the intrinsic pathway as well as the extrinsic pathway leads
  to increased Treg apoptosis in T1D subjects. Genes with red triangles were upregulated,
  while genes with green triangles were downregulated in Tregs from T1D subjects (|z-score|>20
  on the array). This pathway diagram is constructed using known gene-gene interactions
  from the literature, for those genes that were discussed in this study either on
  the array, RT-PCR or under conditions of IL-2-deprivation.
