caption: (A) MAD2L2 helps coordinate nucleotide insertion opposite a lesion by Y-family
  polymerases with mismatch extension by REV3/Polζ during translesion synthesis. (B)
  MAD2L2 helps to prevent premature activation of the APC/C by sequestering CDH1.
  (C) The newly uncovered role for MAD2L2 in pathway choice during double-strand break
  repair. A highly stripped-down scheme of the DNA damage response showing the role
  of 53BP1 in limiting resection through recruitment of RIF1. Genetically, MAD2L2
  appears to act downstream of RIF1. BRCA1 and phosphorylated CtIP prevent RIF1 recruitment,
  allowing displacement of 53BP1, resection and recombination. Thus, in the absence
  of BRCA1, 53BP1 and MAD2L2 block resection. Removing either of these factors in
  BRCA1-deficient cells alleviates this block and can allow resection to proceed.
