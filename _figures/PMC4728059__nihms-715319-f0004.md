caption: (A) Prior to integration, the HIV protein integrase cleaves the host cell’s
  genomic DNA, producing p53 double stranded breaks. Double stranded DNA breaks result
  in the activation of DNA-PK which phosphorylates p53, starting the signaling cascade
  which ultimately results in apoptosis. Two transcripts whose expression is affected
  by p53 are the lncRNAs lincRNA-p21 and PANDA. (B) LincRNA-p21 expression is induced
  by p53 and it binds to hnRNP-K enabling its localization at the promoters of pro-apoptotic
  genes. To prevent this proapoptotic pathway, HIV mediates the initiation of the
  MAP2K1/ERK2 pathway which causes hnRNP-K to be sequestered in the cytoplasm. MAP2K1/ERK2
  activation, therefore, protects HIV-infected cells against p53-induced apoptosis
  by lincRNA-p21 degradation and hnRNP-K sequestration. (C) Conversely, PANDA acts
  to inhibit apoptosis by binding to NF-YA and preventing its co-localization at promoter
  regions of apoptotic genes and is thus downregulated by p53.
