caption: Therapeutic approaches to tackle toxicity and/or aggregation in yeast models
  of HD. Yeast has long served as a tool to identify pharmacological agents against
  HD. Here, important processes (aggregation and kynurenine pathway) of HD toxicity
  in yeast are depicted. Prominent approaches previously used in yeast are the application
  of the polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), intrabodies or the small molecule
  C2-8, all in order to reduce intracellular aggregation load. The KMO inhibitor Ro
  61-8048 was used to modulate the course of tryptophan degradation via the kynurenine
  pathway, which is heavily implicated in HD, leading to less cell death. AB (here
  intrabody), EGCG (epigallocatechin-3-gallate), KMO (kynurenine 3-monooxygenase).
