caption: 'Cyclic production of melatonin, from external (e.g., pineal and possibly
  extrapineal sources) or internal uterine sources, is responsible for promoting decidualization
  and improving implantation. Circadian disruption of Per2 affects decidualization
  and a significant reduction in Bmal1 and REV-ERBα may favor the process via different
  molecular signaling pathways. Melatonin seems to reduce E2 while increasing the
  levels of decidualizing-related molecules, i.e., P53 and LIF, in the uterine tissue.
  In the blastocyst, melatonin directly induces higher viability (by reducing E2 and
  enhancing HB-EGF-ErbB1 pathway) and also indirectly by stimulating corpus luteum
  activity. To improve implantation, melatonin modifies the endometrial and epithelial
  thickness by lowering E2 levels while increasing its glandular density; these, in
  turn, result in ROS attenuation with high production of TAS. Importantly, melatonin
  significantly augments HB-EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB4 and promotes activity of P4-related
  factors in the uterine tissue. SCN: suprachiasmatic nucleus, PVN: paraventricular
