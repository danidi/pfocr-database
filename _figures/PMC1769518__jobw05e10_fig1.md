caption: The complement system consists of about 30 proteins that can be activated
  by 3 different cascades. The classical pathway is initiated when antigen-antibody
  complexes bind to the C1q component of C1, resulting in release of C1s and C1r,
  which act as protease to cleave C2 and C4. The mannin-binding lectin (MBL) pathway
  is triggered by activation of MBL-associated serine proteinases (MASP-1 and MASP-2)
  following the binding of polysaccharides on microbes to MBL. MASP-1 and MASP-2 convert
  C2 and C4. The alternative pathway is triggered by the deposition of spontaneously
  generated C3b on microbes, leading to the generation of alterative C3 convertase.
  The common final step is the activation of C5 by C5 convertases, which leads to
  the formation of the membrane attack complex that finally inserts into target cell
  membranes and causes cell lysis. The peptides C3a, C4a, and C5a mediate several
  reactions in the inflammatory response that could cause tissue injury when complement
  activation becomes uncontrolled.
