caption: Influence of canonical Wnt signals on the MAPK pathway. Wnt3a treatment activated
  the Raf-1-MEK-ERK cascade () and the JNK pathways (). Furthermore, Wnt3a activation
  of activator protein-1 (AP-1) was blocked by the inhibition of JNK with SP600125
  and by the inhibition of AP-1 with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and nordihydroguaiaretic
  acid (). In C3H10T1/2 cells, AP-1 was activated by ERK1/2 (). In totipotent mouse
  F9 teratocarcinoma cells, canonical Wnt-β-catenin-JNK signaling was found to be
  activated by G-proteins, which propagated the signals downstream through Dishevelled
  (Dsh) isoforms; suppression of Dsh-1 or Dsh-3 abolished Wnt3a activation of JNK
  (). In addition to JNK and ERK, p38 MAPK was strongly activated by Wnt3a and the
  activated p38 MAPK regulated canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling through regulation
  of GSK3β. Chemical inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580) and expression of a dominant
  negative (DN)-version of p38 MAPK attenuated Wnt3a-induced accumulation of β-catenin,
  Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene activation, and primitive endoderm formation ().
