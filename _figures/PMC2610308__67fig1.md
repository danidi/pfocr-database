caption: 'The model of HOG signaling pathway response during the long-term  hypersaline
  adaptation in the extremely halophilic H. werneckii.  Hyperosmotic conditions (4.5
  M NaCl) activate the plasma membrane localised  osmosensor of the pathway. However,
  unlike in S. cerevisiae, HwSho1  is most likely localised on an inner cell membrane.
  The Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1  phosphorelay is much more complex, with an input from at least
  one more  histidine kinase (HwHhk7) and with a questionable role of Sln1 homologue.
  The  signals from both pathways converge at the level of Pbs2 MAPKK homologues  (HwPbs2A,
  HwPbs2B1, and HwPbs2B2). HwPbs2 isoforms putatively activate the  HwHog1, a key
  MAP kinase of the pathway. Upon phosphorylation and  translocation into the nucleus,
  the phosphorylated HwHog1 associates with the  chromatin of osmoresponsive genes
  and thereby promotes (or represses;  underlined genes) the transcription, either
  by recruitment and/or activation  of transcriptional factors or by direct association
  with the RNA polymerase II  (RNAPol II), or both. The protein products of HwHog1-interracting  osmoresponsive
  genes belonging to indicated functional groups contribute to  the crucial metabolic
  changes required for successful adaptation to the severe  osmotic environment. Although
  H. werneckii has roughly retained the  structure of the HOG pathway, it has also
  developed many distinctive features.  The identified components of the H. werneckii
  HOG pathway are shown  in dark grey, the evolutionary highly conserved components
  are shown in light  grey, the known components of the S. cerevisiae HOG pathway
  are  colorless. HwHog1 responsive genes are: HwAGP1, amino acid permease;  HwATP1,
  ATPase alpha-subunit; HwATP2, ATPase beta-subunit;  HwATP3, ATPase gamma-subunit;
  HwBMH1, 14-3-3 protein;  HwCIT1, citrate synthase; HwCYT1, cytochrome c1;  HwDBP2,
  RNA helicase; HwECM33, extracellular matrix protein  33; HwEFT2, translation elongation
  factor 2 (eEF-2); HwELF1,  transcription elongation factor; HwERV25, p24 component
  of the  COPII-coated vesicles; HwFAS1, fatty-acid synthase acyl-carrier  protein;
  HwFRE7, ferric-chelate reductase 7; HwGDH1,  glutamate dehydrogenase; HwGPD1A, glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase  A; HwGUT2, FAD-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase;  HwIRE1,
  protein kinase/endoribonuclease; HwKAR2, endoplasmic  reticulum luminal chaperone;
  HwKGD2, dihydrolipoamide  succinyltransferase; HwMET17, cystein synthase, HwMET6,  methionine
  synthase; HwNUC1, mitochondrial nuclease; HwOPI3,  unsaturated phospholipid methyltransferase;
