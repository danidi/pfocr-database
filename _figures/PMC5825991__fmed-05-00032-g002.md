caption: Targeting pattern-recognition receptor signaling in human intestinal inflammation.
  (A) The small molecule VB-201 interferes with downstream signaling from TLR2 and
  has been trialed in ulcerative colitis. (B) Similarly, Bifidobacterium infantis
  35624, which probably acts to interfere with the TLR4 signaling pathway, has been
  trialed in maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis. The results of these two
  trials are not known. TLR4 is found on the cell membrane in immune cells but in
  intestinal epithelial cells has been demonstrated intracellularly where it responds
  to internalized lipopolysaccharide. (C) Alkaline phosphatase detoxifies LPS to inhibit
  TLR4 signaling and has been shown to be of benefit in ulcerative colitis. It is
  not known whether it might interfere with intracellular TLR4. Similar benefits have
  been seen with the TLR9 agonists DIMS0150 and BL7040 (D). (E) TOP1288, a narrow
  spectrum kinase inhibitor, has effects on p38, Src, Lck, and Syk to reduce colonic
  IL-6 and -8 in ulcerative colitis. (F) The exact role of apilimod in innate immune
  sensing is not well understood but there are effects on endosomal maturation and
  TLR9 sensing—this was not, however, effective in a trial in Crohn’s disease. (G)
  Laquinimod exerts some effects on antigen presentation by dendritic cells with some
  improvement in remission in Crohn’s disease.
