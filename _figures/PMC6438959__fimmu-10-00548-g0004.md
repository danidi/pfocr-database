caption: 'Antibody-mediated complement activation. Binding of C1q to antibody-bound
  virus-infected cells leads to activation of the classical complement pathway. C3
  convertase (C4bC2a) is formed and cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. Active C4b can be
  cleaved into the enzymatically inactive form C4d, which serves as a marker for complement
  activation. Further downstream in the classical complement pathway, C5 is cleaved
  into C5a and C5b. C3a and C5a are anaphylatoxins that stimulate a pro-inflammatory
  environment, although they act in different ways: C3a induces C3aR signaling, whereas
  C5a inhibits C3aR expression. C3b binds to pathogens and infected cells, leading
  to phagocytosis through complement receptors found on immune cells. The terminal
  complement components will assemble into the membrane attack complex (MAC), resulting
  in direct lysis of the infected cell. C3aR, C3a Receptor; MAC, membrane attack complex;
  RSV, respiratory syncytial virus.'
