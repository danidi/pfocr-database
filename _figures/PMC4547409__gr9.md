caption: A model illustrating the mechanism underlying inhibition of TGF-β1–induced
  EMT and cell migration by KF. In A549 lung cancer cells, TGF-β1 activates both canonical
  Smad pathway and noncanonical PI3K-Akt1 pathway. The activated Akt1 directly interacts
  with Smad3 and phosphorylated it at Thr179 in the linker region, which leads to
  induction of Snail, N-cadherin, and MMP2 expression as well as repression of E-cadherin
  that are necessary for induction of EMT and migration of cancer cells. Kaempferol
  inhibits TGF-β1–induced EMT and cell migration by suppressing its downstream Akt1
  activity through binding with PI3K.
