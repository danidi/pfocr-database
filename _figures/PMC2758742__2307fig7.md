caption: Model for the switch from proliferation to differentiation in the eye disc.
  Hth and Tsh are expressed in the progenitor domain where they repress retinal differentiation
  genes such as dac and eya and also up-regulate bantam expression in conjunction
  with Yki. Signals such as Dpp from the MF repress hth and tsh, allowing dac and
  eya to execute the differentiation program. In this region of the eye disc, Yki
  may work with other transcription factors such as Sd to regulate a different subset
  of Hippo pathway target genes.
