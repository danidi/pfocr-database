caption: Schematic diagram of the experimental methods in this research. A. C57BL/6
  and HO-1fl/fl/CAG-CreERT2 mice were injected with 10 mg/kg LPS through caudal vein,
  and euthanized for tissue collection after 12 h. B. MLE12 cells were transfected
  with HO-1siRNA for 24 h and then incubated with 5 μg/ml LPS for another 24 h before
  harvesting . To explore the function of HIF-1α/HO-1 pathway in Golgi stress in vitro,
  MLE12 cells firstly were pre-treated with 100 μM DMOG (dissolved in DMSO) for 24 h
  before 5 μg/ml LPS incubation for another 24 h. Fig. 1C. In order to find out the
  role of HIF-1α/HO-1 pathway in Golgi stress in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were pretreated
  with DMOG 25 mg/ml, 300 μl by intraperitoneal injection for 24 h, and then stimulated
  with LPS for 12 h before sacrificing.
