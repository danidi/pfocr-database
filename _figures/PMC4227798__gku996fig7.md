caption: Model of TOP mRNA regulation in response to ribosomal stress. TOP mRNAs are
  poorly translated (compared to non-TOP mRNAs) and thus partly non-utilized because
  they are ‘weak’ competitors for translation initiation. In response to ribosomal
  stress, eEF2 is phosphorylated and the elongation rate is reduced. As a consequence,
  competition at elongation is reduced, and some of the unused TOP mRNAs are recruited
  into polysomes whereas more efficient non-TOP mRNAs cannot be recruited because
  they were already fully utilized. Therefore the synthesis of TOP mRNA-encoded proteins
  is maintained approximately constant (the recruitment roughly compensates the decrease
  of elongation rate) whereas the synthesis of other cellular proteins is reduced.
