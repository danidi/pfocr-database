caption: Different entry points to apoptosis. The extrinsic or death receptor pathway
  is triggered by the interaction of the receptors Fas, TNF and TRAIL and their natural
  ligands. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway is activated by factors such as
  DNA damage, cytotoxic stimuli or cell stress. Another special entry point to intrinsic
  apoptosis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, where internal variability within
  the cell, e.g., variation in calcium homeostasis or wrongly folded proteins, leads
  to the initiation of apoptosis [,].
