caption: The achaete-scute expression is initiated by the combined action of the prepattern
  genes. However Notch signalling via Deltex represses proneural gene expression.
  Wingless signalling alleviates this repression locally through the interactions
  of Dishevelled, Wingless or both with the Notch protein. Inhibition of signalling
  via Deltex and signalling through the canonical Wingless pathway leads to proneural
  cluster development from which one or two SOPs will arise.
