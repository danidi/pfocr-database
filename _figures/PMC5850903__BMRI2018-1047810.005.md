caption: Schema of mechanism of DMY attenuates TNF-α-induced endothelial dysfunction.
  In response to TNF-α, miR-21 expression is increased and inhibits DDAH1, an effect
  that increases downstream ADMA concentration, which resulted in decreasing phosphorylation
  of eNOS and NO production and led to endothelial dysfunction. In contrast, DMY represses
  TNF-α-induced miR-21 expression and restores endothelial function.
