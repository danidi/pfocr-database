caption: 'A. The Warburg effect sustains metabolic needs of PDAC proliferative cells;
  B. The PKM2 tyrosine kinase enhances transcriptional activity of several factors
  such as hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1-α, inducing the Warburg effect through a positive
  feedback loop; C. the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway uses glucose and glutamine
  influx for protein O-GlcNAc glycosylation and its inhibition induces an unfolded-protein
  response-dependent cell death; D. PDAC-specific glutamine metabolism: glutamine-derived
  aspartate is converted into oxaloacetate, then into malate, and finally into pyruvate,
  resulting in an increased NADPH/NADP+ ratio that provides the reducing power to
  maintain reduced glutathione pools; E. glutamine is a nitrogen donor for amino acid
  and nucleotide biosynthesis; F. ASNase may be a promising therapy since a majority
  of PDAC express no or low ASNS; G. macropinocytosis and autophagy support the metabolic
  needs of PDAC cells; H. PDAC overexpresses enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis.
