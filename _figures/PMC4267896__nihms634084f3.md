caption: 'Central LepRb expression sites and related neuronal circuits. Leptin acts
  on diverse central circuits to regulate distinct aspects of energy homeostasis.
  A–E: Examples of select central circuits that have been studied in more detail for
  leptin function. Many other LepRb populations (gray areas in top panel) remain to
  be studied and integrated into a comprehensive picture of energy homeostasis. Specifically
  higher, cortical brain structures and descending effector pathway have not been
  well integrated into leptin regulated energy homeostasis. PVN = paraventricular
  nucleus; ARC = arcuate nucleus; NTS = nucleus of the solitary tract; AgRP = agouti-related-peptide;
