caption: 'Certain chemotherapy agents can cause immunogenic cell death through diverse
  pathways. (A) Anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, and oxaliplatin induce immunogenic
  cell death through the release of tumor antigens, the translocation of CRT (an eat
  me signal for phagocytosis by DCs) to the cell surface, and the secretion of the
  danger-associated molecules HMGB1 and ATP (a find me signal for phagocytosis by
  DCs). These cell death-associated molecules bind their respective receptors, the
  calreticulin receptor (CRTR), the TLR4 receptor (TLR4R), and the P2RX7 receptor.
  This results in activation of the NRLP3 inflammasome, the production of pro-IL1β,
  DC maturation, and the secretion of IL1β to support the evolution of tumor-specific
  CD8+ T cells. (B) Tumor cell death induced by anthracylines results in the release
  of dsRNA, which binds to TLR3 and results in the tumor cell autonomous secretion
  of type I IFNs. This pathway is analogous to the response to viral infection, and
  supports the evolution of tumor immunity. Abbreviations: CRT=calreticulin; DC=dendritic
  cell; HMGB1=high mobility binding box 1; ATP=adenosine triphosphate; TLR=toll-like
  receptor; IFN=interferon; IL=interleukin; NRLP3=inflammasome.'
