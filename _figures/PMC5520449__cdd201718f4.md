caption: 'Crosstalk between metacaspases and autophagy. Metacaspase and autophagy
  are known to be involved in regulating execution of developmental PCD. Depending
  on the type of tissue and model organism, they may have different roles in the pathway.
  For instance, type II metacaspase of Norway spruce, mcII-Pa, was demonstrated to
  be crucial for gradual disassembly of terminally differentiated cells of embryo
  suspensor via vacuolar PCD. mcII-Pa acts upstream to autophagy, and both metacaspase
  and autophagy prevent dying cells from early collapse and necrosis. Arabidopsis
  type II metacaspase AtMC9 is required at the very last stage of vacuolar PCD, post-mortem
  clearance of root xylem cells. It also has role in suppressing necrosis-inducing
  signaling from terminally differentiated cells to the surrounding cells by downregulating
  autophagic activity in the dying cells. Both plant metacaspases and autophagy are
  activated via NLR-dependent pathway upon pathogen infection. In both cases signaling
  leads to a hyper-sensitive response (HR) and might result in local lesion or runaway
  necrotic cell death. Interestingly, autophagy has antagonistic role in developing
  HR response: it is important for transducing the signal from NLR proteins in infected
  cells and at the same time aging-related autophagy is important for preventing the
  spread of runaway death of cells adjacent to the infection site. Likewise, metacaspases
  do not have a single function in HR response. Different metacaspases have antagonistic
  roles upon pathogen infection, for example, AtMC1 and AtMC9 have a pro-death role,
  while AtMC2 in complex with LSD1 acts as an AtMC1 inhibitor. AtMC9 might be involved
  in stimulating HR on different levels: by processing of cell death inducing peptide
  GRIM REAPER (GRI) upon oxidative stress and by cleaving cdc48a protein, which is
  important for removing excess NLR proteins from cells. Aging is associated with
  accumulation of damaged and/or misfolded proteins that tend to aggregate. Both metacaspases
  and autophagy participate in removing these aggregates. YCA1 metacaspase of Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae has been demonstrated to localize to protein aggregates and stimulate
  their proteasome-dependent degradation. A similar mechanism was proposed for the
  type I plant metacaspase AtMC1 (dashed arrow). Autophagy removes protein aggregates
  by delivering them to lytic compartments, such as lytic vacuole. Autophagic flux
  compensates for a decreased proteasomal activity (and vice versa), linking impacts
  of autophagy and metacaspase-dependent pathways on aging control'
