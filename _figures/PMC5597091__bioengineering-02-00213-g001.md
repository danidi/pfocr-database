caption: Schematic outline of the experimental approach used in this study (A). Biosynthesis
  of L-fucose (red triangle) occurs mainly via de novo synthesis and, to a minor extent,
  through the salvage pathway that is exploited here in the course of metabolic glycoengineering;
  Acyl moieties (shown in B) are introduced to fucose to facilitate cellular uptake
  across the plasma membrane and are thought to be cleaved intracellularly by cytosolic
  esterases. Emanating from GDP-mannose (green circle), the de novo pathway can be
  blocked by enzymatic conversion of the intermediate GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose into
  a dead-end product (GDP-rhamnose, green triangle) by GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-4-hexulose
  reductase (RMD) as previously shown in []. Other monosaccharide symbols are explained
  in .
