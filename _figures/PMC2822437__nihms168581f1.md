caption: The Intrinsic pathway is triggered by various stresses including hypoxia/ischemia,
  growth factor deprivation, and cell damage. These stimuli cause a disruption in
  the ratio of pro-apoptotic (BAX, BAK) to anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) Bcl-2 family
  proteins at the mitochondria. Relative increase in the levels of the pro-apoptotic
  proteins allows for their homodimerization, and subsequent Cytochrome C efflux into
  the cytoplasm activates Apaf-1. Apaf-1 triggers Caspase-9 aggregation and activation
  and the subsequent caspase cascade. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by ligand
  binding to the death receptors, which causes receptor trimerization and activation.
  Activated receptors recruit adapter proteins, such as FADD, leading ultimately to
  the activation of Caspase-8 and the subsequent caspase cascade. Both pathways converge
  on Caspase-3, leading to apoptosis.
