caption: Schematic representation of NO signaling mediating NMDA-R activation in the
  central nucleus of the IC. A presynaptic glutamatergic terminal containing both
  VGluT1 and VGluT2 is in close apposition to a postsynaptic multiprotein complex
  consisting of NMDA-R, nNOS, and sGC attached to the scaffold protein PSD95. Initial
  depolarization by glutamate binding to AMPA receptor allows the activation of the
  NMDA-R. Calcium ions enter the cell through the NMDA-R and activate nNOS (via calmodulin
  not shown), leading to the synthesis of NO. NO in turn activates sGC which produces
  the second messenger cGMP. Other excitatory and inhibitory terminals not terminating
  on NOSergic multiprotein complexes are shown. Note also the presence of a separate
  pool of NMDA-Rs not linked to the NO signaling pathway.
