caption: The Shh signaling pathway. A) In the absence of signal, the receptor patched
  (Ptc) is complexed with smoothened (Smo), and Gli exists in a truncated form that
  acts as a transcriptional repressor [, ]. B) When bound by Shh, Ptc releases Smo,
  which signals to produce a full-length Gli activator protein. Gli target genes include
  Gli, Ptc, and genes involved in proliferation and morphogenesis.
