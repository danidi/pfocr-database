caption: (A) Cartoon of S. cerevisiae in presence of extracellular calcium, considered
  a paradigm of bursty frequency modulation. Calcium enters through plasma-membrane
  ion channels and can be stored (released) in (from) vacuoles. Intracellular calcium
  activates calcineurin, which dephosphorylates Crz1p. Once dephosphorylated, Crz1
  binds inporting Nmd5p and enters the nucleus. Exportin Msn5p subsequently removes
  Crz1 from the nucleus. Cytoplasmic calcium pulses may correspond to Crz1 bursts
  in the nucleus []. Red arrows indicate movement while blue arrows stand for chemical
  signaling. (B) Single receptor/ion channel activity, r(t) (blue line), depends on
  the concentration of extra-cellular stimulus c. The signaling rate u differs between
  continuous (CM) and bursty modulation (BM). In CM, u is constant rate α during bound
  intervals, with p b the probability of being bound. In BM, ζ molecules are realized
  at the time of binding with τ bursts the duration between consecutive bursts (binding
  events). (C) Different regulatory networks. Linear pathway used for concentration
  sensing. Incoherent feedforward loop and integral feedback control allow chemical
  ramps to be sensed.
