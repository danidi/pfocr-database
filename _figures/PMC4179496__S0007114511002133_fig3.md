caption: Microarray analysis results obtained from the anti-tumour studies of oil
  palm phenolics (OPP). (a) Genes differentially expressed in the tumour cell cycle
  pathway as indicated by the GenMAPP analysis indicate cytostatic effects of OPP
  (Illumina custom error model P< 0·05, n 3–4). The figure is adapted from KEGG and
  maintained by GenMAPP.org. (b) Gene expression fold changes of two cell-cycle genes
  as determined by microarray and real-time quantitative RT-PCR experiments were comparable,
  thus validating the microarray results obtained. (c) Genes down-regulated in the
  Stat3 and Cxcl12 network generated by the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software indicate
  possible anti-invasiveness and anti-metastatic potential of OPP. , Microarray; ,
