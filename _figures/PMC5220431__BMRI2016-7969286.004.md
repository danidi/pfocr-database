caption: The role of the HH signaling pathway in lung cancer. (a) The HH signaling
  pathway in SCLC. The autocrine HH signaling pathway promotes cancer cell proliferation.
  (b) The HH signaling pathway in adenocarcinoma. The noncanonical GLI activation
  pathway would maintain cancer cell proliferation. CAF maintenance would be regulated
  by paracrine HH signaling pathway activation. CAF-secreted HH ligands would activate
  the HH signaling pathway in cancer cells and CSCs. CAFs-mediated paracrine HH pathway
  activation in cancer cells has important roles in acquisition of metastatic properties.
  Moreover, CAF-mediated HH signaling pathway activation might be involved in CSC
  maintenance. Cancer cells harboring metastatic properties and CSCs would be also
  maintained by autocrine HH signaling pathway activation. In addition, SMO might
  activate other signaling molecules in cancer cells harboring metastatic properties.
  (c) The HH signaling pathway in LSCC. Cancer cells would be maintained by the noncanonical
  GLI2 activation pathway. PRKCI-SOX2-HH signaling pathway has important roles in
  CSC maintenance.
