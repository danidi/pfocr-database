caption: Phospho-regulation of Rod1 function in mating pathway desensitization. Under
  normal growth conditions, Rod1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites that do not prevent
  its interaction with Rsp5, but do prevent its productive association with Ste2.
  Conditions that activate the phosphoprotein phosphatase calcineurin, or that diminish
  the activities of the protein kinases Snf1 and Ypk1, or both, permit Rod1-receptor
  association, promoting the Rsp5-dependent ubiquitinylation and clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis of Ste2. When phosphorylation of Rod1 at its Snf1 and Ypk1 sites is
  blocked, the only way it can be removed from the receptor is via its own Rsp5- and
  ubiquitin-dependent and proteasome-mediated destruction. When Rod1 cannot be phosphorylated
  at its Snf1 and Ypk1 sites and its V/PPxY are mutated (preventing Rsp5 recruitment),
  Rod1 remains bound to Ste2, blocking the ability of the receptor to stimulate its
  cognate G-protein and thereby potently squelching mating pheromone-evoked growth
  arrest.

  description: Phospho-regulation of Rod1 function in mating pathway desensitization.
    Under normal growth conditions, Rod1 is phosphorylated at multiple sites that
    do not prevent its interaction with Rsp5, but do prevent its productive association
    with Ste2. Conditions that activate the phosphoprotein phosphatase calcineurin,
    or that diminish the activities of the protein kinases Snf1 and Ypk1, or both,
    permit Rod1-receptor association, promoting the Rsp5-dependent ubiquitinylation

    is via its own Rsp5- and ubiquitin-dependent and proteasome-mediated destruction.
    When Rod1 cannot be phosphorylated at its Snf1 and Ypk1 sites and its V/PPxY are
