caption: A) Four chaperone-usher pathway pili, including type 1 pili (also known as
  Fim pili), F17-like pili (also known as Ucl pili), Fim-like pili (also known as
  Fml pili) and P pili (also known as Pap pili), are involved in urinary tract infections
  (UTIs) through various mechanisms (left panel). Type 1 pili bind mannosylated uroplakins
  in the bladder and mannosylated mucous components in the gastrointestinal tract
  using the two-domain FimH adhesin. F17-like pili bind O-glycans in the gastrointestinal
  tract, helping to establish a reservoir for recurrent UTIs. Fim-like pili bind GalNAc
  moieties found in the inflamed bladder and kidneys, which promotes chronic UTIs.
  P pili bind globosides in the kidney and are essential for progression to pyelonephritis.
  Biophysical studies performed on type 1 pili revealed the importance of conformational
  dynamics in the adhesin and pilus rod during infection (right panel). More specifically,
  positive selection at positions 27, 62, and 163 influencesconformational changes
  in the FimH adhesion that modulate the affinity of the binding pocket for mannose
  residues on the bladder epithelium. The FimHA62S variant preferentially adopts a
  ‘tense’ conformation with a low affinity for mannose, whereas the FimHA27V/V163A
  variant preferentially adopts a ‘relaxed’ conformation with high affinity for mannose.
  In the wild type protein, it is thought that an equilibrium between these species
  is necessary for maximum virulence. These adhesin subunits are noncovalently linked
  to the pilus tip and rod via a process known as donor strand exchange, wherein a
  donor strand from the preceding pilus completes the beta strand of the immunoglobulin-like
  fold. Furthermore, interactions between neighboring subunits within the Fim pilus
  rod when it adopts its native helical conformation modulate the force-length characteristics
  of the type 1 pilus in response to external force. Alterations to these interactions
  lead to an attenuation of virulence in mouse models of cystitis.B) Uropathogenic
  Escherichia coli (UPEC) preferentially express a subset of siderophores, including
  yersiniabactin (Ybt), during infection of the bladder. Ybt binds extracellular iron
  and copper ions and delivers them to the FyuA outer membrane receptor for internalization.
  The YbtP-YbtQ complex then transports the copper-Ybt complexes to the cytoplasm.
  The presence of depressed cytoplasmic metal levels upregulates transcription of
  the HWMP1 and HWMP2, which subsequently synthesize Ybt. A metabolic byproduct of
  the HMWP1/2-mediated Ybt synthesis pathway, escherichelin (Esc), engages in interbacterial
  competition by disrupting prochelin (Pyo)-mediated iron uptake through the FptA
  outer membrane transporter in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. C) Periplasmic CpxA (the kinase
  of the CpxA-CpxR two component system) can sense protein misfolding (periplasmic
  stress) in E. coli during UTI, leading to the induction of genes responsible for
  the production of the pore-forming toxin α-hemolysin (HlyA) by the CpxR response
  regulator. Approximately 40-50% of UPEC strains encode HlyA, which contributes to
  activation of the NRLP3 inflammasome, caspase-1 and caspase-4, interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
  and IL-1α, leading to urothelial cell death in the host. Deletion of the CpxR in
  UPEC results in overexpression of HlyA and loss of bacterial fitness in mouse models
  of acute and chronic cystitis by triggering the caspase-mediated inflammatory cell
  death pathway and early vigorous urothelial exfoliation. Such vigorous exfoliation
  overcomes the ability of wild type UPEC to subvert the exfoliation response and
  invade underlying epithelium. D) Mechanisms of gastrointestinal colonization and
  curli biofilm formation. In the gastrointestinal environment, E. coli can embed
  themselves in a complex extracellular matrix containing curli fibers, cellulose
  and DNA fragments to promote persistence and prevent clearance. Curli comprise repeating
  amyloidogenic CsgA subunits that are assembled into extracellular fibers. The periplasmic
  chaperone CsgE interacts with unfolded CsgA to facilitate the transport of CsgA
  to and through the nonameric CsgG outer membrane pore. CsgE and the chaperone-like
  protein CsgC prevent premature CsgA polymerization in the periplasm. Following transport
  to the CsgG pore, CsgA is secreted across the outer membrane where curli fiber formation
  is facilitated by CsgB, which is held to the outer membrane by CsgF. CsgB nucleates
  the folding of CsgA resulting fiber polymerization. The FimH adhesin at the tip
  of type 1 pili and UclD adhesin at the tip of F17-like pili also mediate binding
  to the intestinal crypts, helping to establish a stable gastrointestinal reservoir.
