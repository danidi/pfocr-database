caption: A schematic illustration of BER subpathways for damaged bases and DNA strand
  breaks. The damaged base is represented as a star(*). Divergent base excision steps
  converge to common steps for end processing, followed by repair DNA synthesis (represented
  as blue dots) and strand sealing. Polβ could be involved in LP-BER by collaborating
  with FEN1. Other details are discussed in the text.
