caption: (A) Concentration of β-hydroxybutyrate in NT and HCC tissues obtained from
  DEN-injected, ND- or HFD-fed mice, and liver tissues obtained from age-matched ND-fed
  control mice measured using the β-hydroxybutyrate assay kit. Data are the means
  ± SEM (n = 6 per group); *p < 0.05. (B) CE-MS analyses of NT and HCC tissues obtained
  from DEN-injected, ND- or HFD-fed, 8-month-old mice (ND-NT, n = 3; ND-HCC, n = 3;
  HFD-NT, n = 3; HFD-HCC, n = 4). Representative metabolites in the glycolytic pathway
  and TCA cycle are shown; *p < 0.05 vs. ND-NT tissues, †p < 0.05 vs. HFD-NT tissues.
