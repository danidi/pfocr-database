caption: The fourth module identified by iMCMC in the GBM data and locations of the
  detected genes in known pathways. (A) Mutual exclusivity between any pair of genes
  is greater than 0.80 in this module. Thick gray line denotes a value more than 0.90
  and thin line represents a value between 0.80 and 0.90. (B) The detected genes EGFR
  and NF1 are in the RTK signaling pathway, where the interactions are as reported
  in []. The dense dashed line represents pair of genes with exclusivity more than
  0.90 and correlation larger than 0.20. The loosely dashed line represents exclusivity
  more than 0.90 only, and the dot-and-dash curve represents correlation larger than
  0.20 only.
