caption: 'Coexpression of genes within three core metabolic pathways. The entities
  with correlations above the threshold are connected with an edge; networks at three
  thresholds of Pearson correlation are compared: A, 0.5; B, 0.6; and C, 0.7. With
  increasing correlation threshold, the within-pathway links emerge from noisy inter-pathway
  connections. Node colors represent the metabolic function assigned to each gene
  (blue: fatty acid synthesis, green: starch metabolism, red: leucine catabolism,
  yellow: transport or cofactor synthesis, white: acetyl-CoA generation) [see Additional
  file  for gene names]. The networks layouts were produced by GraphExplore software.
  The most densely crowded nodes indicate genes with the highest co-expression. Within
  each of these three co-expression networks the number of links between genes from
  the same metabolic pathway is significantly larger than in randomly generated networks
  with similar link structure. Isolated nodes not shown.'
