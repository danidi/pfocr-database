caption: Functional cross-talk between the signaling pathways involved in colorectal
  cancer.Each molecular signaling pathway represents a target for precision therapy,
  and specific proteins can be used as predictive molecular biomarkers that are essential
  in the characterization of colorectal cancer as a disease, for determination of
  personalized care. Approved biological chemotherapies are boxed in red. The Wnt
  signaling pathway regulates β-catenin concentrations, which finally activate specific
  target genes, together with members of LEF/ TCF. Ras is a multi-tasking protein
  that interacts with several effectors. The first Ras effector pathway identified
  was the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Ras/Raf signaling results in mitogen-activated protein
  kinase activation, which are a group of serine/ threonine kinases that mediate signal
  transduction from the plasma membrane to the nucleus in response to several extracellular
  stimulations, such as growth factors and mitogenic factors. The second best-characterized
  target of Ras signaling is the PI3K pathway, which is an essential player in the
  Ras-mediated cell survival and proliferation. Changes in PI3K signaling represent
  one of the most frequent events in human cancers, as well as in colon cancer. It
  is well known that three tyrosine kinase pathways can activate the PI3K proteins,
  and in particular, the Ras protein can interact and activate several PI3K proteins.
  PTEN is a negative regulator of PI3K, with roles in the dephosphorylation and down-regulation
  of PIP3 levels. The SRC/FAK pathway, the STAT3 pathway, the PI3K/AKT pathway, and
  the Ras pathways are all cMET target pathways [; ]. On the other hand, cMET is mainly
  regulated by HIF-1α, the expression of which is stimulated by hypoxia [].VEGF, Vascular
