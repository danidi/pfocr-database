caption: Conserved components unique to microorganisms, like bacterial lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), bacterial peptidoglycan (PGN) and bacterial lipoproteins (BLP), are called
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are sensed by pattern recognition
  receptors (PRRs), which include CD14 and various Toll-like receptors (TLRs). LPS
  is recognized following its binding to lipoprotein binding protein (LBP). CD14,
  is part of the LPS receptor complex, and together with the functionally linked TLR2
  and TLR4, and the associated molecule MD-2 (lymphocyte antigen 96) are expressed
  in the endocrine cells of human pancreatic islets. PRRs and TLRs signaling pathways
  play a major role in maintaining pathogen-free host tissues. When TLRs are activated
  by PAMPs, through NFκB signaling the innate and adaptive immune systems are activated.
  Invading bacteria are killed by the terminal attack complex (MAC) of the classical
  complement pathway and by specific anti-bacterial antibodies provided by the adaptive
  immune system.
