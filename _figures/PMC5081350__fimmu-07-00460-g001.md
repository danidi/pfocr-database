caption: 'The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin
  levels in the cytoplasm are largely reduced by the following means: (1) a destruction
  complex consisting of the scaffolding proteins APC and AXIN, as well as Ser/Thr
  kinases CK1α and GSK3β, interacts with β-catenin in the cytosol to induce phospho-inactivation
  of the protein by the two Ser/Thr kinases. (2 and 3) Phospho-β-catenin is promoted
  to ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation by β-Trcp and WTX proteins.
  In contrast, in the presence of Wnt ligands, β-catenin levels in the cytoplasm are
  upregulated and actively participate in cell signaling through the following steps:
  (1) Wnts bind to cognate Fzd receptors and interact with adjacent LRP5/6 co-receptors,
  (2) the resulting complex recruits DVL to the cytoplasmic tail of Fzd receptors,
  and (3) DVL recruits the destruction complex to the Fzd/LRP5/6 complex and associated
  Ser/Thr kinases such as GSK3β phosphorylate the co-receptor instead of β-catenin
  due to the altered localization of the complex. Moreover, cytoplasmic TNKS ubiquitinates
  Axin, targeting it for proteasomal degradation and causing disruption of the β-catenin
  destruction complex. (4) Cytosolic β-catenin levels are free to accumulate and subsequently
  translocate to the nucleus. (5) This translocation results in the displacement of
  the co-repressor Groucho on the TCF/LEF transcription factor by β-catenin and the
  recruitment of co-activators such as BCL9, CBP, and PYGO to result in the transcription
  of target genes. Alternate means of activation of β-catenin signaling include the
  disruption of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin)–E-cadherin interactions, which frees
  the association of β-catenin to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin and allows
  for its accumulation in the cytoplasm. In addition, TLRs and other such transmembrane
  receptors may result in PI3K/Akt signaling. This leads to an alternative phospho-activation
  of β-catenin through phosphorylation at Ser552 and phospho-inactivation of GSK3β
  at Ser9 to prevent the degradation of β-catenin by the destruction complex and allow
  it to accumulate in the cytoplasm and participate in cell signaling. Abbreviations:
