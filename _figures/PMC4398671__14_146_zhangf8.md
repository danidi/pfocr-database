caption: Schema of structure and signaling pathway of G-CSFRI and G-CSFRIV. G-CSFRI
  consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain.
  The membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain has been linked to activation
  of Jak and Stat5. The C-terminal end of G-CSFR cytoplasmic domain contains the dileucine
  internalization motif and four conserved tyrosine residues. Y704 and Y744 recruit
  Stat3, and Y729 is a docking site for SOCS3. The dileucine internalization motif
  and SOCS3 could inhibit Stat5 activation. In the alternatively spliced G-CSFRIV,
  87 amino acids at the C-terminal end of the cytoplasmic domain including Y729, Y744,
  Y764 and dileucine internalization motif are replaced by 34 amino acids of a novel
  sequence. In response to G-CSF, the G-CSFR forms ho-modimers and leads to rapid
  Jak phosphorylation and subsequently the activation of Stat3, Stat5 and SOCS3. The
  Stat proteins then dimerize, translocate to the nucleus and bind to specific DNA
  recognition sites and modulate the expression of the target genes. G-CSFRIV induces
  prolonged Stat5 activation, which causes an upregulation of the miR-155 host gene.
  miR-155 further downregulates the levels of its target genes including PU.1, GFI-1
  and TP53INP1, contributing to growth and survival advantage, increased CCL2 secretion
  as well as defective differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.
  The Stat5 inhibitor and shmiR-155 may abrogate G-CSFRIV–mediated Stat5/miR-155/miR-155-targets
  pathway.

  description: Schema of structure and signaling pathway of G-CSFRI and G-CSFRIV.
    G-CSFRI consists of an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic
    domain. The membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic domain has been linked
    to activation of Jak and Stat5. The C-terminal end of G-CSFR cytoplasmic domain
    contains the dileucine internalization motif and four conserved tyrosine residues.
    Y704 and Y744 recruit Stat3, and Y729 is a docking site for SOCS3. The dileucine
    internalization motif and SOCS3 could inhibit Stat5 activation. In the alternatively
    spliced G-CSFRIV, 87 amino acids at the C-terminal end of the cytoplasmic domain
    including Y729, Y744, Y764 and dileucine internalization motif are replaced by
    34 amino acids of a novel sequence. In response to G-CSF, the G-CSFR forms ho-modimers

    genes. G-CSFRIV induces prolonged Stat5 activation, which causes an upregulation
    of the miR-155 host gene. miR-155 further downregulates the levels of its target
    genes including PU.1, GFI-1 and TP53INP1, contributing to growth and survival
    advantage, increased CCL2 secretion as well as defective differentiation of hematopoietic
    stem and progenitor cells. The Stat5 inhibitor and shmiR-155 may abrogate G-CSFRIV–mediated
    Stat5/miR-155/miR-155-targets pathway.
