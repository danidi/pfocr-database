caption: Pharmacological regulation of the integrated stress response (ISR). The translation
  initiation factor eIF2α is phosphorylated (eIF2α-P) by a diverse group of kinases.
  Phosphorylated eIF2α represses eIF2B inducing translation attenuation as well as
  activation of a pathway that induces GADD34 forming a complex with PP1c (GADD34:PP1c).
  This stress-activated complex induces the desphosphorylation of eIF2α-P to restore
  proteostasis. A constitutively activated complex (CReP:PP1c) dephosphorylates eIF2α-P
  under basal conditions. Salubrinal inhibits indirectly the activity of both GADD34:PP1c
  and CReP:PP1c complexes through an unknown target (X). However, Guanabenz and Sephin1

  description: Pharmacological regulation of the integrated stress response (ISR).
    The translation initiation factor eIF2α is phosphorylated (eIF2α-P) by a diverse
    group of kinases. Phosphorylated eIF2α represses eIF2B inducing translation attenuation
    as well as activation of a pathway that induces GADD34 forming a complex with
    PP1c (GADD34:PP1c). This stress-activated complex induces the desphosphorylation
    of eIF2α-P to restore proteostasis. A constitutively activated complex (CReP:PP1c)
    dephosphorylates eIF2α-P under basal conditions. Salubrinal inhibits indirectly
    the activity of both GADD34:PP1c and CReP:PP1c complexes through an unknown target
    (X). However, Guanabenz and Sephin1 only inhibit the activity of GADD34:PP1c complex.
    ISRIB overcomes the attenuation of translation induced by eIF2α-P, activating
    eIF2B downstream of eIF2α. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
