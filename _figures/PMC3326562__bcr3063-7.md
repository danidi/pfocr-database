caption: 'Proposed signaling pathways modulated by α-TEA and TAM in TAMR cells. Based
  on published data and data presented here, a schematic diagram of the actions of
  α-TEA, MβCD, and TAM on proapoptotic and prosurvival signaling mediators in TAMR
  cells is depicted. (a) Proapoptotic pathway affected by α-TEA and α-TEA + TAM: α-TEA
  triggers DR5 extrinsic death receptor-mediated caspase-8/tBid/Bax/mitochondria/caspase-9-dependent
  apoptosis and caspase-8-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress-dependent upregulation
  of JNK/CHOP/DR5 positive-feedback loop. Combination of α-TEA + TAM enhances these
  apoptotic pathways via suppression of Akt-mediated c-FLIP. (b) Prosurvival pathways
  affected by α-TEA, MβCD, and TAM. Both α-TEA and MβCD disrupt cholesterol-rich lipid
  microdomains, leading to suppression of crosstalk between mER-α and RTKs, reduction
  of total and phosphoprotein levels of RTKs (HER-1 and HER-2), decreased levels of
  pAkt and pERK1/2, as well as decreased levels of estrogen receptor-α activity via
  downregulation of nuclear estrogen receptor-α (nER-α) phosphorylation mediated by
  Akt and ERK (Ser-118 and Ser-167). Both Akt and ERK mediated downstream prosurvival/antiapoptotic
  mediators, and nER-α promoted proliferation/survival and inhibited apoptosis. In
  contrast, TAM stimulates survival signaling in TAMR cells. (c) Prosurvival pathways
  affected by combination of α-TEA or MβCD + TAM: α-TEA or MβCD + TAM cooperatively
  act to suppress prosurvival signaling, indicating that either α-TEA or MβCD restores
  TAM sensitivity by converting the TAM prosurvival (agonistic) actions to antisurvival
  (antagonistic) actions. c-FLIP, cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein; CHOP, Ccaat-enhancer-binding
  protein (C/EBP) homologous protein; DR5 (L/S), death receptor 5 long/short; HER-1,
