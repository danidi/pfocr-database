caption: a, 2DG is specifically taken up by cancer cells through a glucose transporter.
  Once inside, it is phosphorylated and becomes a hexokinase inhibitor. At the same
  time, it activates several signal transduction cascades. One of them is IGFR-PI3K-mTOR-AKT
  pro-survival pathway. Through another cascade activation, Bak-Mcl-1 association
  is lost. When ABT is added 3 hours later, it can bind to Bcl-xL and disrupts its
  association with Bak. b, Freed Bak oligomerizes, releasing a small amount of cytochrome
  c into the cytosol. It activates cascades of caspases 9-3-6-8 and caspase 8 cleaves
  Bid, generating BH3 only tBid protein. Since tBid can dissociate Bak-Mcl-1 and Bak-Bcl-xL
  association, it induces mitochondria outermembrane pore formation through which
  more cytochrome can be released. Released cytochrome c recruits Apaf1, caspase 9
  and dATP, forming a “death executioner” apotosome complex.
