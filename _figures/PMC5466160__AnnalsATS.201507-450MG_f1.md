caption: 'Autophagy pathway. Autophagy is a regulated process that responds to regulation
  by nutrient signals. Autophagy responds to negative regulation by growth factor
  stimuli that activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/AKT) pathway, which
  up-regulates the mTOR pathway and down-regulates the Beclin1 complex. Autophagy
  responds to up-regulation by depletion of cellular energy charge through the activation
  of the adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In response
  to elevated AMP levels, AMPK can inhibit mTORC1 and directly phosphorylate ULK1,
  leading to activation of autophagy. The antibiotic rapamycin induces autophagy by
  inactivating mTORC1. The initiation of autophagosome formation is also regulated
  by the autophagy protein Beclin 1 (Atg6). Beclin 1 associates with a macromolecular
  complex that includes hVps34, a class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. Autophagosome
  elongation requires two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems, the ATG5-12 conjugation
  system, and the ATG8 (LC3) conjugation system, which are regulated by various ATG
  proteins. Autophagy protein LC3-II remains associated with the maturing autophagosome.
  The basic sequence of steps of autophagy include: (1) initiation and autophagosomal
  nucleation (formation of the phagophore); (2) elongation of the nascent autophagosomal
  membrane, to capture a cargo such as mitochondria; (3) maturation of the double-membraned
  autophagosomal structure with cargo assimilation; and (4) autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion, which is concluded by degradation of the autolysosomal contents.'
