caption: The network included 6 of the 7 validated proteins with direct and indirect
  relations (ANXA1, FLMNA, PSMA6, ALDH7A1, LMNA, LMNB2) connected with both αv (ITGAV)
  and uPAR (PLAUR) proteins and localized to a specific cell compartment (all colored
  in orange). Network proteins are visualized by proper symbols, which specify the
  functional nature of protein. Each node represents a protein and its direct (represented
  by solid lines) and indirect (represented by dotted lines) association with other
  proteins. Proteins with no background color were undetected in the study but have
  been inserted by IPA to produce a highly connected network.
