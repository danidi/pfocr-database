caption: Healthy livers contain large numbers of ductular cells, quiescent hepatic
  stellate cells and fenestrated SEC. The latter two cell types express Hedgehog interacting
  protein (Hip), which antagonizes the actions of the small amounts of Shh or Ihh
  that are released from rare immature ductular-type progenitor-cells and MF-HSCs
  that exist in uninjured livers. Liver injury represses Hip and activates ductular-type
  progenitor cells to produce PDGF-BB. PDGF-BB stimulates the accumulation of MF-HSCs,
  and induces production of Hh ligands by both MF-HSCs and ductular-type progenitor
  cells. Hh ligands promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of these cell types,
  expanding their numbers. This contributes to liver fibrosis and parenchymal nodularity.
  The MF-HSCs and ductulartype progenitor cells also release increased number of membranous
  exosome-enriched microparticles that contain Hh ligands. These interact with neighboring
  SEC and induce Hh-dependent changes in sinusoidal gene expression that result in
  capillarization and the release of vasoactive factors, such as nitric oxide (NO),
  that promote vascular remodeling. Therefore, Hh pathway activation during liver
  injury contributes to tissue remodeling that occurs in cirrhosis.
