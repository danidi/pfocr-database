caption: Figure 2 depicts various immunological, coagulative/thrombogenic, and fixative
  (glutaraldehyde)-related injuries that can affect a porcine GBHV, leading to calcification
  and failure of the graft. Genetic engineering of pigs may reduce or prevent the
  above-mentioned injuries. Several groups have reported multiple genetic modifications
  of the pig, such as GTKO.hCD46.hCD55.hTBM, GTKO.hCD46.CIITA-DN, GTKO.NeuGC-KO, or
  GTKO.hCD55.hCD39.A20 = tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3; CIITA-DN =
  MHC class II transactivator-knockdown; CRP = complement regulatory proteins; EC
  = endothelial cell; ELAM-1 = endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1; GBHV = glutaraldehyde-fixed
  bioprosthetic heart valve; GTKO = α1,3-galactosyltransferase gene-knockout; h =
  human; HO-1 = hemeoxygenease-1; ICAM = intercellular adhesion molecule; NeuGc-KO
  = N-glycolylneuraminic acid gene-knockout; p = porcine TBM = thrombomodulin’; TFPI
  = tissue factor pathway inhibitor; vWF = von Willebrand factor.
