caption: Proposed “synthesis” model for APV molecular pathogenesis in an infected
  host cell. Infection of the host cell by APV triggers host antiviral defenses comprising
  the IFN pathway, leading to the activation of several ISGs known to impact virus
  propagation. The data suggest that IFN may be important for the induction of chemokine
  and adhesion molecule genes by mediating IκB degradation and NF-κB activation facilitated
  by IκB ubiquitin ligase (SCF). The proposed mechanism of recruitment of host Vps
  pathway proteins (Vps45, Rab5c, clathrin, Endo180, and syntaxin 7) by APV for completion
  of its replicative cycle and budding is shown. The model predicts that the putative
  L domain in the APV M protein undergoes ubiquitination and thereby interacts with
  one or more of the Vps proteins. The complex thus formed directs more of the Vps
  pathway factors to the cell membrane to form an active budding complex for the egress
  of virus progeny from the host cell. The possible role of Ubp in aiding viral proteins
  to escape proteasomal degradation is also presented.
