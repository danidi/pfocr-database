caption: Classical neurotransmitters of clozapine neighborhood in A auto-layout format
  and B a gamut of multifunctional molecules identified by IPA core and functional
  analyses (see table 2). Both graphs are connected via a clozapine bridging hub to
  emphasize that they are related to the same ‘neighborhood’. Therefore, clozapine
  ‘outsiders’ were transferred to the B-section of the web. As in figure 2, some ties
  are not represented in the graph, and all ‘self-referential’ edges, as well as the
  labels that describe the nature of the relationship between the nodes were omitted
  to reduce the clutter. Clozapine hub, as well as the size of nodes is overemphasized
  for visual clarity (their symbols are shown in figure 2). They do not communicate
  differences of functional hierarchy.ADRA1A-1D, ADRA2A, ADRA2B, ADRA2C = Adrenergic
