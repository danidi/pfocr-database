caption: '(A) Schematic illustration of the intracellular trafficking dynamics of
  mitochondria-targeting nanoparticles. Copyright © 2015. Elsevier Ltd. Reproduced
  from Zhang Z, Zhou L, Zhou Y, et al. Mitophagy induced by nanoparticle-peptide conjugates
  enabling an alternative intracellular trafficking route. Biomaterials. 2015;65:56–65.
  (B) Schematic illustration of the PINK1/Parkin pathway. Dysfunctional mitochondria
  (yellow mitochondrion) fail to import and degrade PINK1, instead stabilizing it
  on the outer mitochondrial membrane. After PINK1 accumulation, PINK1 phosphorylates
  ubiquitin and Parkin to activate its E3 ligase activity. Once activated, parkin
  ubiquitinates substrates on the outer mitochondria for two divergent processes:
  autophagosome recruitment and the proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated mitochondrial
  substrates. Fis1 is a receptor on the outer membrane that binds two proteins TBC1D15/TBC1D17
  to govern the developing LC3 isolation membrane to generate the autophagosome around
  the damaged mitochondria. The autophagosome is then delivered to the lysosome for
  degradation. Copyright © 2015. Elsevier Ltd. Reproduced from Pickrell AM, Youle
