caption: Hypothetical model of WRKY22’s role in plant response to abiotic (left) and
  biotic (right) stresses. Changes in, for example, light, temperature and touch are
  perceived via sensors and ion channels; plant invasion by organisms such as bacteria
  and aphids is mainly perceived via pattern-recognition (PR) receptors. These stimuli
  induce WRKY22 directly via MAPK cascades (; ), or indirectly via SA accumulation
  (; ). Alternatively, aphid effectors secreted via the saliva may induce WRKY22 via
  PR-receptor-independent routes. WRKY22 subsequently integrates signalling of the
  JA and SA pathway, by inhibiting or activating specific transcription factors (TFs)
  and other regulatory genes.
