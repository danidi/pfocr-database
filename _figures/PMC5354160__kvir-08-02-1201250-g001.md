caption: Schematic representation of the calcineurin signaling pathway. In response
  to external stimuli Ca2+ ions enter the cell through the high affinity calcium channels,
  Cch1 and Mid1. Upon binding to 4 Ca2+ ions the calcium-binding protein, calmodulin
  (CaM), undergoes a conformational change. Activated Ca2+-calmodulin complex binds
  to the calcineurin heterodimer (CnA and CnB) and enhances the calcineurin phosphatase
  activity. The activity of calcineurin is inhibited by the binding of the immunophilin-immunosuppresant
  complexes (FK506-FKBP12 and CsA-CypA). The activated calcineurin complex dephosphorylates
  the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor, Crz1, and enables its translocation
  into the nucleus. Crz1 activates the transcription of genes involved in the regulation
  of stress response, cell wall integrity, growth and drug resistance.
