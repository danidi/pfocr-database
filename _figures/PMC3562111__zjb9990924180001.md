caption: 'Genomic reconstruction of NAD biosynthesis in Streptococcus spp. Schematic
  representation of NAD biosynthetic routes as revealed by the in silico genomic reconstruction
  of NAD metabolism, integrated with experimental mutant analysis and biochemical
  studies. Predicted enzymes are shown in squares, metabolites are indicated within
  large circles, and gene names are shown in parentheses. The small white circles
  indicate coregulated functional roles of the NiaR repressor, as described previously
  (). Nonpathogenic streptococcal species with an active nicotinamide riboside salvage
  pathway are listed in Table S2 in the supplemental material. Metabolites: IA, iminoaspartate;
  NmR, nicotinamide riboside. Enzymes and transporters: ASPOX, l-aspartate oxidase;
  QSYN, quinolinic acid synthetase; NaPRT, nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase;
  NAM, nicotinamide deamidase; NADS, NAD synthetase; RNK, ribosyl nicotinamide kinase;
  NMNAT, NMN adenylyltransferase; PnuC, family of nicotinamide riboside transporters;
  NiaX, family of niacin transporters.'
