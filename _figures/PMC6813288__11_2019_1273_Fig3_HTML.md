caption: Mechanism of NF-κB activation by PA. PA and TLR4 share some of the signaling
  pathways. Both activates IRE1α, but in a different way. TLR4 activates this ER stress
  sensor via TRAF6. In turn, activation through PA depends on the damage of ER membranes
  and incorporation into them. Then IRE1α activates JNK–MAPK pathway, which destabilizes
  the lysosomes. Cathepsin B is released, which is involved in the NF-κB activation.
  IRE1α also activates IKK, which participates in the canonical activation of NF-κB.
  PA can also cause activation of PERK, which inhibits translation and thereby reduces
  the level of IκBα that leads, as well, to the NF-κB activation
