caption: Proposed model for how mTORC1 activity controls macrophage polarization.
  a. Physiological induction of the Akt-mTORC1 signaling loop by IL-4 stimulation
  (left) allows for transient, inducible activation of the pathway, and enables Akt
  to synergize with the JAK/STAT pathway for M2 polarization. mTORC1 activity is also
  regulated by nutrient availability (not shown here), so such wiring of the signaling
  pathway may allow calibration of M2 activation to metabolic status (left). In contrast,
  constitutive or aberrant mTORC1 activation corrupts this signaling pathway and modulation
  of macrophage activation by metabolic inputs (right). (Green = activation; Red =
  inhibition; Black = attenuated) b. Constitutive or aberrant activation of mTORC1
  impairs the ability of macrophages to respond appropriately to polarizing stimuli.
  A critical mediator of this process is Akt, whose activity is downregulated by increased
  mTORC1 activity.
