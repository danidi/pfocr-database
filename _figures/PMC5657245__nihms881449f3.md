caption: A subset of dopamine neurons that innervate the mushroom body neurons promote
  forgetting. Although these neurons exhibit chronic activity, they are modulated
  by external and internal factors with increased sensory stimulation increasing their
  activity and sleep/rest decreasing their activity. The signal from the dopamine
  neurons is received by the DAMB receptor expressed on mushroom body neurons. This
  signal is communicated through a signaling complex scaffolded by the protein Scribble
  and containing Rac1, Pac3, and Cofilin. Cofilin regulates the remodeling of the
  actin cytoskeleton to mediate active forgetting. As conceptualized in , the mushroom
  body neurons in this case are “engram cells.” Neurons that promote forgetting (dopamine
  neurons) in the engram cells are thus termed “forgetting cells.”
