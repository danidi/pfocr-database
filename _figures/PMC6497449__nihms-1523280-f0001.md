caption: 'This scheme demonstrates current drug design strategies aimed at improving
  the safety of painkilling drugs by modulating mu opioid receptor (MOR) activity.
  The approaches discussed here include biased agonists, peripherally limited opioids,
  bivalent ligands acting at heteromers, allosteric modulators, and various approaches
  modulating opioid peptides. Colored arrows indicate potential drug induced signaling
  and physiological response(s) for each drug strategy. Physiological responses associated
  with signaling pathways are indicated below in matching colors including G protein
  mediated analgesia and β-arrestin signaling associated to constipation and respiratory
  depression however the pathway(s) rewarding properties of opioids remain unassociated
  to either pathway. Abbreviations: plasma membrane (PM), extracellular regulated
  kinase ½ (ERKs) and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), orthosteric site
  (1), allosteric site (2). References are from the text.'
