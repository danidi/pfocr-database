number: Figure 1
caption: a. The expression of GAS5 is decreased and regulates cell proliferation.
  b. NUF2 up-regulates lncRNA AF339813. LncRNA AF 339813 regulates apoptosis and cell
  cycle. LncRNA AF339813 regulates apoptosis via mitochondrial and caspase pathways.
  LncRNA AF339813 regulates cell cycle through cyclin D1 and CDK4/CDK6. c. HOTAIR
  is physically combined with PRC2, which increases cell proliferation and decreases
  apoptosis through GDF15. d. Similar to HOTAIR, HOTTIP is combined with protein WDR5
  and then regulates cell growth and cell cycle, but the mechanism is complex. e.
  MALAT-1 promotes EMT, PC cell growth and proliferation (not shown). Besides, MALAT-1
  maintains stemness by regulating Sox2. f. As a molecular sponge, H19 antagonizes
  let-7 and increases EMT through HMGA2 pathway. g. ENST000000480739 facilitates PC
  invasion and metastasis through OS-9/HIF-1 pathway.
