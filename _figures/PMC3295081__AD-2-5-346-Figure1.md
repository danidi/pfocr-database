caption: Macrophage iNOS signaling is imperative in generation of reactive nitrogen
  species to kill bacterial and viral pathogens, as well as a marker of macrophage
  polarization. Following stimulation of TLR4, activation of MAPK and NFκB modulate
  iNOS expression. With advanced aged, reports are still inconclusive regarding iNOS
  activation and NO production after stimulation with TLR4 ligands, like LPS. Activation
  of the IFN-γ pathway results in phosphorylation and translocation of STAT1a, initiating
  IRF-1 transcription and subsequent iNOS expression. In aging rodents, studies suggest
  that reduction in NO production and iNOS transcription may be due to decreases in
  STAT1a levels and phosphorylation.
