caption: a Before binding by a Hedgehog family ligand (most often Shh, but also Ihh
  or Dhh), Ptch1 and presumably Ptch2 maintain Smo sequestered, by a currently unknown
  mechanism. Under these circumstances, both anterograde and retrograde transport
  in functionally intact primary cilia is necessary to allow PKA-dependent cleavage
  of the Gli3 transcription factor to its repressor form and its shuttling from the
  base of the cilium to target DNA, accompanied by Sufu. The same mechanism may govern
  Gli2 processing. b Hedgehog proteins are post-translationally modified; the secretion
  and multimeric conformation of Shh is organized by the Disp transmembrane receptor
  in signaling cells, accompanied by Scube. Binding of Hh to Ptch receptors leads
  to internalization and degradation, and relocalization of Smo to the primary ciliary
  membrane, which changes lipid composition. Other receptors include Boc, Cdon and
  Gas1, which may refine signal integration. Lrp1 is a non-specific but necessary
  co-receptor. Hh binding leads to ciliary clearance of the G-protein coupled negative
  regulatory receptor Gpr161, reduction in PKA production, and accompaniment by Sufu
  of immature Gli2/3 proteins along the ciliary microtubules for their requisite processing
  to activating forms. Gli1 is transcribed as a Shh target and positively reinforces
  this cycle, while Ptch1 itself is another target whose increased transcription sharpens
  thresholds and raises cellular stakes for survival, as continued Hh stimulation
  becomes necessary for the target cell. The activity of cell cycle-related kinase
  (Ccrk) is necessary for ciliary integrity and acts between Smo and Gli2 in effecting
  readout of Shh levels within the optic primordium
