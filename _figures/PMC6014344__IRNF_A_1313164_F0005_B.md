caption: Jagged/Notch signaling pathway. Under high glucose condition, Notch receptor
  is firstly targeted with ligands binding to an adjacent receptor. Then the intramembrane
  Notch receptor (NICD) is cleaved by metalloproteinases and γ-secretase. The released
  NICD translocates to the nucleus and interacts with CSL to form a heteromeric complex
  which acts as an activator of target genes for podocyte EMT and DKD.
