caption: Mechanism of stiffness-induced ALI and PH. During ALI, pathogens or their
  virulent components induce inflammatory response by facilitating the leukocyte extravasation
  and may also simultaneously increase endothelial permeability by the activation
  of GEF-H1/Rho signaling pathway. The increased ECM proteins and adhesion molecules
  synthesis is mediated by NFkB pathway which acts as a feedback mechanism to increase
  stiffness. In pulmonary hypertension (PH), the causes yet to be known induce pulmonary
  artery stiffening with increased flow pulsatility which possibly initiates inflammation
  and EC dysfunction.
