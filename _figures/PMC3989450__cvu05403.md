caption: Wnt-dependent interactions between cardiac myocytes and cardiac fibroblasts
  after acute myocardial infarction. Wnt signalling regulating cardiac fibroblast
  and myocyte repair response. Sfrp2 and Wnt1 expressed by cardiac fibroblasts promote
  fibrosis. Wnt3a decreases cardiac progenitor self renewal, and Wnt5a activates expression
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages. Antagonism of Wnt3a and Wnt5a by
  small molecule pyrvinium inhibits fibrosis. SFRPs when injected or overexpressed
  globally appear to be cardioprotective and anti-fibrotic. Similarly, myocyte-specific
  loss of β-catenin is cardioprotective. These observations support a pro-fibrotic
  role of Wnts in cardiac repair. Red bars indicate inhibition of pathway.
