caption: Cartoon of Metabolite Changes in Response to Oligomycin Inhibition of the
  ATP Synthase and of Lines with Downregulated δ-Subunit Expression.The data from
  , , and , and Supplemental Figure 5 online were layered onto a metabolic pathway
  cartoon and statistically significant changes in metabolite abundance compared with
  controls are shown by colors. For oligomycin, changes in metabolites are indicated
  by two adjacent squares (first square, 1 h; second square, 4 h). An increase is
  denoted red (pink, increase < twofold; red, increase > twofold), and a decrease
  is denoted blue (light blue, decrease > 0.5; dark blue, decrease < 0.5). For δRNAi1,
  significant increases compared with the empty vector line are indicated as separate
  red boxes. Empty boxes indicate no change. Gluc, Glc; UDP-gluc, UDP-Glc; Gluc-6-P,
