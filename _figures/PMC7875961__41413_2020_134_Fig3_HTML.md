caption: Horizontal pleiotropy of common genetic factors. Pyk2 signal could be a converging
  pathway of the genetic correlation between osteoporosis and Alzheimer’s disease
  (AD). Genetic variants in PTK2B are significantly associated with AD, body mass
  index, and bone mineral density suggesting that the two traits—osteoporosis and
  AD—could be linked by horizontal pleiotropy
