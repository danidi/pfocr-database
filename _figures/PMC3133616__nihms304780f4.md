  ion channel types are color coordinated according to ion selectivity, Orai1 (red),
  Kv1.3 and KCa3.1 (green), cation non-selective TRPM7 and IP3R channels (orange),
  and Clswell (violet). Dots and arrows correspond to ions and fluxes with the same
  color code. STIM1 is shown (gray) with a Ca2+ ion bound to its EF-hand within the
  ER lumen under basal conditions with the ER Ca2+ store filled. Ion channels and
  functions include (clockwise from right): Kv1.3 maintains the resting membrane potential
  and participates in RVD; Clswell triggers RVD by opening in response to cell swelling;
  KCa3.1 hyperpolarizes the membrane potential when cytosolic Ca2+ rises; Orai1 embodies
  the pore-forming subunit of the CRAC channel and is activated by STIM1 following
  ER Ca2+ store depletion (dotted line); TRPM7, activated by PIP2 and inhibited by
  Mg2+ inside, may regulate Mg2+ homeostasis in the cell. Proximal signaling events
  inside the cell following presentation of antigen include the following (counterclockwise
  from top right): TCR engagement of peptide–MHC, activation of tyrosine kinases (TK:
  Lck, Fyn, and ZAP-70), and phospholipase-C-γ (PLCγ), resulting in the cleavage of
  PIP2 to generate the second messengers IP3 and DAG; IP3-induced Ca2+ release; depletion-induced
  mobilization of STIM1 and activation of Ca2+ influx through Orai1 subunits. Post-Ca2+
  events include activation of KCa3.1 via prebound CaM, activation of calcineurin
  via CaM, accumulation of dephosphorylated NFAT subunits in the nucleus, binding
  to DNA promoter regions, and altered gene expression. Functionally significant changes
  in ion channel expression and Ca2+signaling are indicated by arrows corresponding
  to changes during acute and chronic activation. TCR, T-cell receptor; STIM, stromal
