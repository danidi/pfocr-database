caption: PARylation is required for chromatin structural changes following DNA damage.
  (A) PARP1 facilitates the binding of the MRN complex, which is known as the first
  DNA damage sensor, being responsible for the recruitment of ATM. Following PARP1
  auto-activation, amplified in liver cancer 1 (ALC1) is implicated in nucleosome
  sliding by interacting with histones in a PARP- and aprataxin and PNK-like factor
  (APLF)-dependent manner. (B) ATM phosphorylates H2A.X at S139, resulting in the
  recruitment of RNF8 and RNF168. RNF8 catalyses the K63-linked poly-ubiquitylation
  of H1, while RNF168 is responsible for the ubiquitylation of H2A at K13 and K15.
  PARP1 promotes the recruitment of SMARCA5 to DSB sites and its subsequent interaction
  with RNF168. PARylated APLF, recognizing branched PAR chains catalysed by PARP2,
  participates in H3 removal during DNA repair. Furthermore, PARP1-mediated accumulation
  of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 2 (CHD2) leads to dynamic exchange
  of H3 to H3.3. (C) Members of the NuRD and polycomb complex, involving metastasis
  associated protein 1 (MTA1), CHD3, CHD4, polycomb group ring finger 2 (PCGF2), polycomb
  group ring finger 4 (BMI1), and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) take part in
  transcription inhibition through a PARP-mediated pathway.
