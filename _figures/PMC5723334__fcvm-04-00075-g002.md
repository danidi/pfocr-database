caption: The role of Kv7 in regulating the contractile state of smooth muscle. β-Adrenergic,
  cyclic AMP (cAMP)-mediated activation of Kv7 leads to outward directed K+ current,
  with subsequent hyperpolarization, reduced opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
  (VDCC) and vasodilation of the vascular smooth muscle cell. This action opposes
  the activation of Gq-linked receptors, α1-adrenergic receptor (α1AR), which negatively
  regulates Kv7 activity by the actions of the protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated pathway.
  This decreased Kv7 activity leads to depolarization, which opens VDCC. Ca2+ is simultaneously
  released from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) as a response to inositol triphosphate
  (IP3). This rise in intracellular Ca2+ leads to vasoconstriction (). The expression
  and function of Kv7.4 are impaired in SHR. This results in decreased β-adrenergic,
  cAMP-mediated Kv7.4 activation, with a shift toward α1AR activity. Reduced Kv7.4
  activity and α1-adrenoceptor hyperactivity lead to a rise in intracellular Ca2+
  concentration and subsequent vasospasm (). The vasodilatory effect of perivascular
  relaxing factors (PVRFs) released by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) may be mediated
  through opening of Kv7.
