caption: ER quality control (ERQC) pathways. In the ER specialized protein quality
  control (ERQC) pathways assist the synthesis, folding and maturation of proteins
  destined for secretion or insertion into the cell membrane. ER-synthesized proteins
  emerge from ER-bound ribosomes and reach their native structure, guided by ER-resident
  chaperones, such as CNX, CRT and BiP. Proteins that fold correctly transit to the
  Golgi stacks to complete their maturation and are then delivered to their final
  destination. Proteins that are unable to reach their native conformation, designated
  as “terminally misfolded,” are eliminated to counter potential proteo-toxicity.
  The main degradation system in the ER is the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.
  In this pathway, misfolded ERAD substrates are recognized by specialized ER lectins
  and dislocated from the ER to the cytosol by dedicated ERAD dislocation complexes
  (dislocons). In concomitance with the dislocation reaction, ubiquitinating enzymes
  attach ubiquitin moieties to the aberrant polypeptide chains as a signal for proteasomal
  recognition. Once in the cytosol, polyubiquitinated ERAD substrates are detected
  by the proteasome and degraded. Hence, basal ERQC activities cooperate to finely
  tune the balance between protein production and clearance. When the ERAD/proteasome
  system is engulfed and/or proteins form intracellular aggregates, autophagy may
  be activated as an alternative degradation system. Mutations that hamper the achievement
  of a proper protein structure can produce an excess of misfolded proteins in the
  ER, which exhausts the basal ERQC capacities generating ER stress. Under these conditions,
  BiP detects the excess of misfolded proteins and initiates the unfolded protein
  response (UPR) cascade, which is mediated by the PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 signaling
  pathways. The final goal of the UPR is to reduce the amount of misfolded proteins
  in the ER and re-establish ER-homeostasis. PERK (via phosphorylation of the translation
  initiation factor eIF2α) attenuates global protein synthesis. Concomitantly, activated
  IRE1/XBP1 and ATF6 pathways upregulate ERAD, ER-chaperones and autophagy genes,
  and genes associated with amino acid and lipid metabolism. If the ER stress cannot
  be resolved, the UPR itself can drive cells to apoptosis.
