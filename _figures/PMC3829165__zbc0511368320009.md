caption: A schematic illustrating the signaling pathways for TGF-β1-induced down-regulation
  of VE-cadherin and the inhibition of cell invasion in human trophoblast cells. TGF-β1
  treatment resulted in the activation of Smad2 and Smad3, which up-regulated the
  expression of Snail and Slug. The Smad2-dependent pathway is more involved in TGF-β1-induced
  up-regulation of Snail that Slug (thick versus thin arrow). In contrast, TGF-β1-induced
  up-regulation of Slug is primarily mediated by the Smad3-dependent pathway. Up-regulated
  Snail but not Slug subsequently binds to the E-box on the human VE-cadherin promoter
  and contributes to the TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of VE-cadherin and the inhibition
  of trophoblast cell invasion.
