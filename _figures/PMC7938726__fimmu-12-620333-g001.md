caption: 'Diagram of osteoimmunology and potential regulatory sites of TCPTP. Regarding
  the regulation of bone-related cells by immune cells, some CD4+ T cell subsets can
  produce osteoclastogenic cytokines (e.g., TNF-α from Th1 cells and IL−17 from Th17
  cells), while other subsets secrete anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines (e.g., IL−4
  from Th2 cells, IL−10 and CTLA4 from Treg cells). IFN-γ released by Th1 cells may
  exert both pro- and anti-osteoclastogenic effects as reported by previous studies.
  B cells physiologically inhibit osteoclastogenesis but stimulate osteoclastogenesis
  through activating the RANK/RANKL axis in the pathological state. Different stages
  of dendritic cells exhibit distinct properties in immune responses: immature dendritic
  cells differentiate into osteoclasts in response to M-CSF, RANKL, TNF-α, IL-1, and
  IL-17, while mature ones drive the activation and expansion of Th17 cells. Macrophages
  are essential to bone loss with the involvement of TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 released
  by themselves. On the other hand, bone-related cells also provide feedback to immune
  cells. Osteoblasts secrete G-CSF, IL−1, IL−6, IL−7, and CXCL12, which are required
  for HSCs maintenance. In addition, osteoblasts secrete IL-7 to support B lymphopoiesis
  and regulate DLL4-Notch signaling pathway to support T lymphopoiesis. Osteocytes
  are supposed to mobilize HSCs and are involved in myelopoiesis. Osteocyte-derived
  RANKL participates in estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss by indirect regulation
  of B cell development. Osteoclasts are also involved in antigen presentation and
  T cell activation. Osteoclasts secrete tolerogenic cytokines (e.g., IL-10, TGF-β)
  and activate regulatory T cells in physiological conditions, while in pathological
  conditions, osteoclasts secrete inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-1β) and activate
  TNF-α producing CD4+ T cells. Generally, TCPTP regulates bone metabolism mainly
  by changing the biofunction of macrophages, T cells, and B cells. TCPTP, T cell
