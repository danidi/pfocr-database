caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathways for the generation of AEA from its arachidonoyl
  containing NAPE (NArPE) precursor. NAPEs are formed from phosphatidyl choline and
  phosphatidyl ethanolamine membrane precursors by an as yet uncharacterised N-acyl
  transferase enzyme. The most widely accepted route of AEA biosynthesis is via NAPE-PLD
  [,]. This enzyme is also responsible for the generation of other NAEs including
  OEA and PEA from their corresponding NAPE precursor. The serine hydrolase αβh4 can
  generate lysoNAPE and glycerophospho-N-acyl ethanolamine (GpNAE), including glycerophospho-N-arachidonoyl
  ethanolamine (GpAEA), glycerophospho-N-oleoyl ethanolamine (GpOEA) and glycerophospho-N-palmitoyl
  ethanolamine (GpPEA) intermediates that are subsequently hydrolysed by a metal dependant
  phosphodiesterase to produce AEA, OEA and PEA, respectively. In mouse brain, this
  enzyme has been identified as GDE1 []. LPS induced synthesis of AEA involves the
  generation of phosphorylated AEA (pAEA) via PLC which is then converted to AEA by
  phosphatases. In mouse brain, this phosphatase has been identified as PTPN22 [].
  Whether this third pathway contributes to the synthesis of other NAEs such as OEA
  and PEA remains to be determined.
