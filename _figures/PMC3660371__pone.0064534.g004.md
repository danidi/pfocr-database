caption: Infection impact on larval physiology was investigated through immunity (1),
  cellular stress (2), energetic metabolism (3) and lipid metabolism (4) using physiological,
  enzymatic, biochemical and molecular analysis. Results suggest that bacterial infection
  induce the activation of the immune response (non-self recognition (1a), NF-κB signaling
  pathway (1b), haematopoiesis (1d), synthesis of inhibitor of metalloproteinase,
  antimicrobial peptide (1c) and phagocytosis (1e) allowing the destruction of pathogenic
  bacteria. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the phagocytosis
  process was managed by antioxidant defenses (2a) and cytoprotective proteins (2b).
  Infection affects the feeding activity (3a) which change the energy status of larvae
  (decline of metabolic rate (3b), energy reserve consumption (3c), β-oxidation activation
  (3d) and lower lipids storage (3e)). Besides metabolic changes, fatty acid remodeling
  in polar lipids (4a) is associated to pathogen exposure, as suggested by changes
  in phosphatidylinositol and lysophosphatidylcholine composition, non-methylene–interrupted
  fatty acids accumulation, lower content of major C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids
  and activation of desaturases. Finally, infection induces the activation of phospholipase
  and lipoxygenase (4b) probably through NF-κB regulation (4c) to initiate eicosanoïdes
  and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) pathways. See discussion for details.
