caption: Complement activation pathways and examples of complement-targeting therapeutics
  for IgAN. The three pathways of complement activation, classical, lectin, and alternative,
  are initiated by interactions of complement proteins with distinct structures. Complexes
  of antigen and antibody can activate the classical pathway. Mannan-binding lectin
  recognizes carbohydrate structures and, upon association with serine proteases (MASP,
  mannose-associated serine proteases), can activate the lectin pathway. Complement
  C3 that is covalently bound to microorganism surfaces as C3b initiates the cascade
  of the alternative pathway. Each pathway can ultimately generate an active C3 convertase,
  resulting in cleavage of C3 component into C3a and C3b fragments. C3b can interact
  with C4b2b or C3bBb to produce C5 convertase that cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b fragments.
  C5b binds to the cell membrane and serves as a platform for assembly of the membrane
  attack complex (MAC) (, ). The formation of MAC can be inhibited by membrane-bound
  CD59 that binds to C8 and/or C9. Several other regulatory proteins of the complement-activation
  pathways are shown in red. Five complement-targeting therapeutics are shown in blue
  rounded rectangles. These reagents include two monoclonal antibodies (eculizumab
  that blocks cleavage of C5; OMS721 targeting MASP-2 that inhibits its protease activity),
  a C5a receptor antagonist (CCX168), a low-molecular-weight inhibitor of factor B
  (LNP023), and an inhibitor of C3 activation (APL-2). CR1, complement receptor 1;
  CFHR 1-5, complement factor H-related proteins 1-5; DAF, decay-accelerating factor;
  FB, factor B; FD, factor D; FI, factor I; Gd-IgA1, galactose-deficient IgA1; Gd-IgA1-IC,
  galactose-deficient IgA1-containing immune complexes; MCP, membrane cofactor protein;
  P, properdin.
