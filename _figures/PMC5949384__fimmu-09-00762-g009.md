caption: Sirt1-Notch interaction in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophages.
  In LPS-induced inflammation, SIRT1 was suppressed, and Notch signaling was activated.
  SIRT1 caused the deacetylation of intracellular domain of Notch (NICD), which led
  to NICD degradation and inhibition of Notch signaling. The inactivation of Notch
  signaling reduced the activation of the NF-κB pathway in inflammation.
