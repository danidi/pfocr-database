caption: Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and the predicted model for the
  process of melanin biosynthesis. (A) EMSA for Vdpf (EGY18187.1) and the promoters
  of Ac, Pka, Mkk1, Mkh1, Gp1, Gp2 and Gp3. Ac represents the adenylate cyclase‐encoding
  gene, and Pka represents the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)‐dependent protein
  kinase A (PKA)‐encoding gene; these genes are involved in the cAMP signalling pathway.
  Mkk1 and Mkh1 represent the mitogen‐activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase MKK1/SSP32
  gene and the MAP kinase kinase kinase mkh1 gene, respectively, which play important
  roles in the MAP kinase signalling pathway. Gp1, Gp2 and Gp3 are genes that encode
  the G‐protein‐coupled receptor; they participate in the G‐protein‐mediated signalling
  pathway. The binding assays used 0, 3, 4 or 5 μL of purified Vdpf (EGY18187.1).
  The red arrow points to the shift bands. (B) Real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase
  chain reaction (RT‐PCR) analysis of the signalling genes. The expression level was
  measured by Quantity One software. (C) Deducible signalling pathways in melanin
  synthesis. Chk1 and Mps1 are two MAP kinase genes involved in the MAP kinase signalling
  pathway. They have been demonstrated to be involved in melanin synthesis through
  the transcription factor Cmr1/Amr1. The purple arrows represent known results, and
  the black arrows represent results in this research study. The broken lines represent
  unconfirmed results. Three biological replicates (n = 3) were used for this study.
