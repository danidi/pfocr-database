caption: 'During HCV infection, the virus is first recognized by TLRs and RIG-1, which
  in turn activates MyD88 and IRAK1 to initiate IFN-α synthesis, resulting in the
  activation of ISGs and the inhibition of HCV replication. In addition, miR-21 expression
  is activated during HCV infection through two signaling pathways: the PKCε/JNK/c-Jun
  pathway and the PKCα/ERK/c-Fos pathway. The HCV NS5A protein activates PKCε to enhance
  the expression of JNK and c-Jun, while the HCV NS3/4A complex stimulates PKCα to
  promote the production of ERK and c-Fos. The two subunits (c-Jun and c-Fos) of AP-1
  join together to recognize the miR-21 promoter and activate the expression of miR-21,
  which represses the expression of MyD88 and IRAK1 via imperfect base pairing between
  miR-21 and the 3′UTR of MyD88 and IRAK1. The reduction in MyD88 and IRAK1 causes
  a reduction of type-I IFN production and ISG expression that might contribute to
  viral pathogenesis and virus propagation.'
