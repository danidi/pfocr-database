caption: NAD biosynthetic pathways from nicotinamde and nicotinic acid in yeast, invertebrates,
  and mammals. (A) The NAD biosynthetic pathways in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae and invertebrates, such as C. elegans and Drosophila. Steps from nicotinamide
  to NAD are shown with grey arrows. Pnc1, Npt1, Nma1 and Nma2, and Qns1 are nicotinamidase,
  nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase, nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase
  1 and 2, and NAD synthetase, respectively. Only Sir2 is shown as a representative
  NAD-dependent protein deacetylase. NaMN, nicotinic acid mononucleotide. (B) The
  NAD biosynthetic pathways in mammals. The de novo pathway from tryptophan and the
  NAD biosynthetic pathway from nicotinic acid are evolutionarily conserved, while
  the NAD biosynthetic pathway from nicotinamide (grey arrows) is vertebrate-specific
  and mediated by Nampt and Nmnat. Nicotinamide is the main precursor for NAD biosynthesis
  in mammals. While multiple enzymes break NAD into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose, only
  Sirt1 is shown here. NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide.
