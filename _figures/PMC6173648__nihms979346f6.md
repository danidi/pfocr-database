caption: A hypothetical pathway that may underlie vibration-induced changes in gene
  transcription in the prostate. The blue outer circle represents a cell in the prostate
  and the black, inner circle is the nucleus of the cell. Vibration-induced changes
  in reactive oxygen species (ROS, either locally or systemically), may result in
  an increase the transcription of pro-inflammatory factors in the circulation, or
  within the cells of the prostate itself. Vibration-induced increases in ROS may
  also increase the transcription of runx, which in turn can stimulate vascular remodeling.
  Increases in pro-inflammatory factors may activate the mitogen-activated protein-kinase
  (MAPK) cell signaling pathway, and through phosphorylation of other cell signaling
  enzymes, affect the transcription of factors that regulate cell cycle or carcinogenesis
  such as chk1, pmel, bard1 and b-raf. Transcripts in red were increased by vibration
  exposure in the prostate. Black dashed arrows are hypothetical pathways by which
  vibration or changes in cellular processes may affect transcription within the prostate.
  Kinases (in grey) or grey dashed arrows are hypothetic pathways that may be activated
  and affect gene transcription, based upon the results of previous studies (, ).
