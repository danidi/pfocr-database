caption: 'Overview of the MAPK/MKP3 signaling network and application of caged cysteine
  toward caging the catalytic site of the phosphatase. a Schematic of the Ras/Raf/ERK
  signaling pathway with the dual-specificity phosphatase MKP3 indicated in grey.
  Upon activation of the pathway by external stimuli, a cascade of phosphorylation
  events results in dually-phosphorylated ERK, which translocates to the nucleus where
  it activates additional downstream targets. In the presence of active MKP3, pERK
  is rapidly dephosphorylated and remains in the cytoplasm. Phosphates are indicated
  by grey filled circles. b Irradiation of NVC removes the nitrobenzyl caging group
  (green) and restores a native cysteine residue. c The mechanism of MKP3-catalyzed
  ERK dephosphorylation. Dashed lines indicate electrostatic and/or hydrogen-bond
  interactions. d The crystal structure of MKP3 (PDB: 1MKP) is shown with the three
  critical active site residues labeled in black. On the left, the catalytic cysteine
  was replaced with NVC, which sterically blocks the active site and prevents catalysis,
  until exposed to 365 nm light'
