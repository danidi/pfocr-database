caption: Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for select chemical pathways of thyroid disruption,
  including (A) rat thyroid follicular cell tumors linked to chemical inhibition of
  TPO; (B) impaired cognitive functioning in mammals linked to chemical inhibition
  of TPO; and (C) hearing deficits in mammals linked to inductions of TH catabolic
  pathways. In the left-hand column, MIE boxes activated for a given pathway are shown
  with solid borders (shaded green) and KEs in the AOPs are shown as boxes with striped
  background (shaded orange). The causative KE in the formation of rat thyroid tumors
  (A) is increasing TSH (shown with thick borders and striped background and shaded
  orange) leading to hypothalamic–pituitary compensatory feedback responses shown
  in left-hand MIE boxes and downstream thyroid hypertrophy and hyperplasia with striped
  background (and also shaded orange). In contrast, elevated TSH (shown with a dashed
  border) has not been shown as a causative KE in chemical inhibition of TPO leading
  to cognitive impairments in mammals (B) or chemical activation of the hepatic xenobiotic
  NR response cascade leading to mammalian hearing deficits (C). References supporting
  these AOPs can be found in . ↔, no change from reference controls; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon
  receptor; CAR, constitutive androstane receptor; KE, key event; MIE, molecular initiating
  event; NR, nuclear receptor; PXR, pregnane X receptor; T3, 3,3ʹ,5-triiodothyronine;
  T4, thyroxine; TPO, thyroperoxidase; TH, thyroid hormone; TR, thyroid hormone receptor;
  TRH, thyrotropin releasing hormone; TRHR, thyrotropin releasing hormone receptor;
  TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TSHR, thyroid stimulating hormone receptor; UDPGT,
  uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase.
