caption: 'Changes in gene expression in the shikimate pathway of the glu1-2 mutant.
  Simplified schematic representation of the shikimate pathway and the genes showing
  different expression levels in glu1-2 leaves and root. Gene IDs indicated in blue
  are upregulated whereas those indicated in red are downregulated. Enzymes: (1) 3-deoxy-D-D-arabino-heptulosonate
  7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS), (2) 3-dehydroquinate synthase (DQS), (3) 3-dehydroquinate
  dehydratase/shikimate dehydrogenase (DHQD), (4) shikimate kinase, (5) 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate
  synthase, (6) chorismate synthase, (7) chorismate mutase, (8) prephenate aminotransferase,
  (9) arogenate dehydratase. The figure is based on []. The detailed data of the genes
  depicted in this figure are presented in Additional file .'
