caption: The slicing activity of Ago1 is critical for release of the siRNA passenger
  strand and generation of active RITS (Slicer I), and for efficient release and recycling
  of RITS coupled to nascent transcript degradation (Slicer II). The recruitment of
  CLRC, which leads to H3K9 methylation, and the recruitment of RDRC, which leads
  to dsRNA synthesis and secondary siRNA generation, are both independent of Ago1
  Slicer activity (blue shade). RITS and the Argonaute siRNA loading complex ARC form
  a minimal small RNA-directed pathway that can recruit downstream activities to promote
  heterochromatin assembly.
