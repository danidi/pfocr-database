caption: 'Working model of the SA-dependent pathway and SA modifications in Citrus
  sinensis. Proposed (simplified) model of the molecular mechanisms involved in the
  transcriptional regulation of SA modification and activation of defense-associated
  responses via NPR1 in C. sinensis. Black line arrows indicate the synthesis of SA
  metabolites. Dashed line indicates transport to vacuole; thick, white arrow indicates
  the Isochorismate (IC) Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase pathways; and thick, gray arrow
  indicates the reduction and monomerization of NPR1. The abbreviations are as follows:
  isochorismate (IC) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathways. Molecules are
  abbreviated as follows: salicylic acid (SA), methyl salicylate (MeSA), SA 2-β-D-glucoside
  (SAG), salicylate glucose ester (SGE), 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,3-DHBA) and
  2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (2,5-DHBA). Proteins are abbreviated as: benzoic acid/
  salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (BSMT1), Methylesterase 1 (MES1), Downy
  mildew resistance 6 (DMR6), UDP-glucosyltransferase 74F2 (UGT74F2), Nonexpresser
  of Pathogenesis-Related genes 1 oxidized or reduced forms (NPR1ox/NPR1reduced),
  Pathogenesis-related 1 gene (PR-1)'
