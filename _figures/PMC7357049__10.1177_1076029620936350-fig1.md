caption: Coronavirus disease 2019 and thrombotic risk mechanism. Severe acute respiratory-CoV-2
  direct pulmonary and systemic infection, due to its endothelial invasion and dysfunction,
  activates an inflammatory response, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators.
  Endothelial and hemostatic activation ensues, with decreased levels of tissue factor
  pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and increased tissue factor. This viral infection inflammation/coagulation
  interplay, in association with stasis, cardiovascular diseases, and genetics, leverages
  the hemostatic derangement , It results in venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly
  pulmonary embolism (PE), arterial thrombosis, myocardial infarction (MI), strokes,
  and cardiovascular death. In case of further hemostatic derangement; disseminated
  intravascular coagulation (DIC), whose treatment is different from PE.
