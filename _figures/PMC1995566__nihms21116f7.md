caption: Oxidative stress initiates a cascade of reactions leading to cell death via
  one or more sequences of molecular events. First, calcium-dependant calcineurin/calpain
  activation can initiate downstream events including dephosphorylation of NFAT and
  activation of BAD, release of cytochrome c, activation of caspases 9 and 3, and
  cell death. Second, a caspase-2 dependant pathway to cell death can be triggered
  by DNA damage. Third, caspase-independent pathways to cell death include release
  of AIF and EndoG from the mitochondria. Translocation to the cell nucleus results
  in chromatin condensation and high-molecular mass-chromatin fragments. Fourth, receptor-mediated
  cell death begins with ligation of death receptors, death inducible signaling complex
  is formed, which activates pro-caspase-8. Caspase-8 can activate caspase-3, leading
  to cell death, or cleave Bid, which results in translocation and insertion of Bax
  and/or Bak into the mitrochondrial membrane and release of cytochrome c, activation
  of caspases 9 and 3, and cell death. The caspase-2 dependent pathway differs from
  the caspase-8 and caspase-9 dependent pathways in that pro-caspase-2 is activated
  by DNA damage. Different cell types vary in the extent to which apoptotic cell death
  depends on the activation of caspase-2 (; ), and a specific role for caspase-2 in
  apoptotic cell death in the inner ear has not been described to date.
