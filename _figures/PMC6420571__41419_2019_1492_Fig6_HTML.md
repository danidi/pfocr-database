caption: β-Thujaplicin treatment increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation,
  which subsequently led to inhibition of the Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and activation
  of p38/ERK MAPK signaling pathway. Consequently, (1) increased expression of LAMP1
  and LC3B-II, suggesting that β-Thujaplicin increases autophagosome formation. Furthermore,
  blocking autophagy can effectively alleviate β-Thujaplicin-induced cell death, while
  inducing autophagy can aggravate cell death, indicating that β-Thujaplicin has a
  role in ACD. (2) The increase in cleaved PARP1, cleaved caspase-3, and Bax/Bcl-2
  ratio caused activation of the mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  (3) Decreased expression of CDK7, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin A2, and increased expression
  of p21 caused S-phase arrest. Thus, ROS-mediated p38/ERK MAPKs and the Akt-mTOR
  signaling pathway was shown to be the underlying mechanism of β-Thujaplicin-induced
  HCC cell death in this study
