caption: 'Chemical structure of OHyW in tRNAPhe and its biosynthetic pathway. A, chemical
  structures of yW (left) and OHyW (right). The exact name of OHyW is α-(carboxyamino)-β-hydroxy-4,9-dihydro-4,6-dimethyl-9-oxo-1H-imidazo
  [1,2-a]purine-7-butyric acid dimethyl ester. Atoms in the tricyclic ring and side
  chain are numbered in blue. B, secondary structure of human cytoplasmic tRNAPhe
  with modified nucleosides as follows: hydroxywybutosine (OHyW), 2′-O-methylguanosine
  (Gm), 2′-O-methylcytidine (Cm), pseudouridine (Ψ), 5-methylcytidine (m5C), 7-methylguanosine
  (m7G), 2-methylguanosine (m2G), N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (m22G), dihydrouridine (D),
  1-methyladenosine (m1A), and 5-methyluridine (m5U). Peroxywybutosine (o2yW), which
  has been identified in mammalian tRNAPhe (, ), was not present in our preparation,
  similar to a previous report (). C, biosynthetic pathway of OHyW. Chemical structures
  of intermediates from yW-86 to OHyW are illustrated. Additional groups at each step
  are shown in blue. The hydroxyl group at β-carbon is shown in red. TYW5 hydroxylates
  yW-72 to produce OHyW-72 utilizing 2-OG, O2 and Fe(II) as substrates.'
