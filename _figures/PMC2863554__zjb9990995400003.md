caption: Pathways of tryptophan metabolism. The catabolic pathway leading from tryptophan
  to anthranilic acid, found in a number of bacteria, is inducible by tryptophan ().
  The pathway leading from kynurenine to 3-HA is constitutive and found in all eukaryotes,
  including S. cerevisiae () and mammals (). In the eukaryotic cell, 3-HA serves as
  a precursor of NAD+ or can be metabolized further. In actinomycin synthesis, 3-HA
  is converted to 4-MHA. NAD+, nicotine adenine dinucleotide.
