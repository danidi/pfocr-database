caption: p27 regulates cell migration. Depending on the cell-specific context, p27
  can either promote or inhibit cell migration in a CDK-independent manner. (a) RhoA
  functions as a molecular switch that cycles between inactive GDP-bound and active
  GTP-bound states that are promoted by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and guanine–nucleotide
  exchange factors (GEFs), respectively. Upon stimulation, GEFs activate RhoA which
  in turn activates ROCKs to phosphorylate LIMKs. Thus activated, LIMK then phosphorylates
  cofilin to inhibit its actin-depolymerizing function to stabilize actin stress fibers
  and focal adhesions. Cytoplasmic p27 inhibits this pathway by directly interacting
  with RhoA and preventing its activation by the Rho-GEFs, resulting in increased
  cell motility. Mitogenic signaling pathways and oncogenic kinases target p27 for
  cytoplasmic relocalization through phosphorylation of specific residues (indicated
  by yellow circles)—phosphorylation of S10 promotes nuclear export while phosphorylation
  of T157 and/or T198 impairs nuclear import. (b) In certain cell types, cytoplasmic
  p27 can promote Rac activation to stimulate filopodium formation and cell migration
  (c) In migrating cortical interneurons, sustained activation of RhoA in the absence
  of p27 results in elevated actomyosin contractions due to increased phosphorylation
  of myosin-II light chain (pMLC-II) by activated MLC kinase (MLCK). This deregulation
  contributes to defective nucleokinesis, neurite branching, and tangential migration.
  Cytoplasmic p27 fine-tunes the actomyosin contractions by inhibiting RhoA activation
  to correct this defect. (d) p27 is a microtubule (MT)-associated protein and it
  promotes MT-polymerization, thereby contributing to neurite extension during interneuron
  migration. (e) p27 controls MT dynamics in a stathmin-dependent manner. Sequestration
  of stathmin, a MT-destabilizing protein, by p27 blocks the tubulin-sequestration
  activity of the former resulting in increased MT polymerization and inhibition of
  migration.
