caption: Activated Nrf2 entered the cell nucleus after dissociating from Keap1 suppressing
  protein, and combined with Maf protein in the nucleus to form a heterodimer and
  then combined with ARE DNA sequence, therefore, initiated gene transcription controlled
  by AREThis path is called as Keap-Nrf2-ARE pathway.
