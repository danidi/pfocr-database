caption: A recent in vitro study by Kim et al.  has shown that LMP-1 increases genomic
  instability through Egr-1-mediated upregulation of AID in B-cell lymphoma cell lines.
  A recent in vivo study  has demonstrated overexpression of AID, including LMP-1
  and Egr-1, in LPDs (MTX- and age- related) associated with pre-cancerous states
  due to immunosuppression in the head and neck. In LPDs that occur in patients who
  are immunosuppressed due to MTX administration or ageing, memory B-cells without
  mutation/translocation first express LMP-1 by reactivation of EBV latent genes.
  Secondly, LPDs with polyclonal growth show an increase AID expression through the
  LMP-1/NF-kB/Egr-1 signaling pathway, and LPDs with monoclonal proliferation undergo
  gene mutation or gene translocation throuugh the effect of increased AID. Abnormal
  long-term expression of AID in LPDs leads to development of true malignant lymphoma,
  and the changed malignant B-cell lymphomas show an increase of AID expression through
  acquired monoclonal growth. On the other hand, lymphoma caused by a gene mutation
  will develop when the expression of AID is absent or low involved.
