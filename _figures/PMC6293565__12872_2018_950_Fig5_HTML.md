caption: A proposed pathway for the protective effects of metformin against DM-induced
  disorders on atrial SK2 and SK3 channels. DM induces an excessive activitiy of PKC
  which is followed by a sequential activation of ERK and causes disorders of atrial
  SK2 and SK3 channels. Metformin treatment leads to a sequential inhibition on the
  activities of PKC and ERK and results in an improvement on the disorders
