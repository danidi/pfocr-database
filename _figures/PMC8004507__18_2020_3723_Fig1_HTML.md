caption: The SUMO cycle. The SUMO cycle ensues with the processing of pro-SUMO to
  its mature form by removal of the C-terminus of SUMO through the action of SUMO
  proteases. Mature SUMO (blue circle denoted as “S” in figure) is then activated
  in an ATP dependent step requiring the enzymatic functions of a heterodimeric complex
  of SAE1 and SAE2. The activated SUMO is then transferred to SCE1 (SUMO conjugating
  enzyme) in a conjugation step, and through the action of SUMO ligase is conjugated
  onto the substrate. This substrate can then be SUMOylated at more than one SUMO
  site or form a polySUMO chain. PolySUMOylated substrates can be polyubiquitinated
  through the action of specific SUMO targeted Ubiquitin Ligases (StUbLs) and targeted
  for degradation by the 26S proteasomal pathway. Lastly, in the deSUMOylation step,
  SUMO is removed from the substrate through the action of a SUMO isopeptidase to
  generate free SUMO. The action of the deSUMOylating isopeptidases allows the whole
  process to be cyclical and maintain the turnover of free SUMO
