caption: Caspases regulate RLR and TLR antiviral signaling. RIG-I and Mda-5 recognize
  viral RNA and associate with MAVS localized in mitochondria and then transduce signal
  through multiple adapters, leading to the activation of IRF3/7 via the kinase TBK1.
  Simultaneously, MAVS triggers NF-κB via TRADD, FADD and caspases-8 and -10. In addition,
  host cells could mount a caspase-3-mediated apoptotic response to some viruses,
  such as SeV, via MASV. The RNA genomes of viruses internalized in the endosomes
  are detected by members of the TLR family of receptors, including TLR3, TLR7, TLR8
  and TLR9, which recruit adapter proteins, such as TRIF and MyD88. Subsequently,
  TRIF and MyD88 transduce signals to the downstream transcription factors IRF3/7
  and NF-κB via TBK1 and the IKK complex, respectively. Notably, in some cell types,
  both TRIF and MyD88 can trigger RIPK3 and further form a cell death-inducing complex
  that includes RIPK1, FADD and caspase-8. Caspase-8 is also reportedly involved in
  the maturation of pro-IL-18/1β. Caspase-12 could suppress RIG-I signaling by cleaving
  TRIM25. By inhibiting multiple adapters in the RLR/TLR antiviral signaling pathway,
  such as TBK1, IRF3, RIPK1 and RIPK3, caspase-8 has even more powerful functions
  in controlling antiviral innate immunity. MDA-5, melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary response gene;
  RIPK1, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1; IKK, inhibitor of
  NF-κB kinase.
