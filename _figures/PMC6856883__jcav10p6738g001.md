caption: The regulatory roles of lncRNAs in TAM polarization. Macrophages can transform
  into M1 type or M2 type induced by LPS and IFN-γ or IL-4 or IL-13, respectively,
  and the two phenotypes can transform mutually. LncRNAscox-2 inhibits proliferation
  and immune evasion of tumor by inhibiting M2 polarization in macrophages. LncRNA
  CASC2c suppresses the expression and secretion of FX, which lead to decrease phosphorylation
  and inactivation of ERK1/2 and AKT in macrophages, resulting repressed M2 polarization
  and decreased proliferation of tumor cells. Exosomes-derived lncRNA TUC339 promotes
  M2 polarization by increasing the expression of M2 markers. High expression of lncRNA
  T-UCR, uc.306 is associated with a higher overall survival, which may involve in
  promoting M1 polarization. M2 macrophages secreted IL-8 could induce the expression
  of MALAT1 via inducing STAT3 pathway.
