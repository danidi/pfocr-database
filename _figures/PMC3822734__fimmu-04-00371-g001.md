caption: Modular composition of the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) compared to the
  T-cell receptor (TCR). The TCR binds to cognate peptide-loaded MHC (pMHC) by the
  TCR α and β chains, forms the immunological synapse by clustering accessory components
  including CD3ζ and CD28, and initiates the downstream signaling pathway for T-cell
  activation through phosphorylation of the CD3ζ ITAM motives. The CAR, in contrast,
  is composed of one polypeptide chain; the extracellular single chain fragment of
  variable region (scFv) antibody domain binds to the target antigen in a MHC-independent
  fashion. Upon CAR clustering, the intracellular CD3ζ chain, with or without costimulation
  through members of the CD28 family, initiates the downstream signaling for T-cell
  activation. Co-receptors may modulate CAR activity. In contrast to a first generation
  (1°) CAR, second (2°), and third (3°) generation CARs harbor in addition one or
  more costimulatory moieties in their intracellular part.
