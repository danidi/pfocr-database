caption: Carbohydrate‐mediated folding in the endoplasmic reticulum. Following translation,
  the nascent protein (red) enters into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a translocon
  pore (SEC61) where it sequentially interacts with a network of chaperones and enzymes
  to acquire its correct higher order structure. During entry into the ER, the oligosaccharyltransferase
  complex (OST) transfers a preformed Glc3Man9 NAc2 glycan precursor to the Asn of
  the Asn‐X‐Ser/Thr motif in the polypeptide chain. The two outermost glucose residues
  are then sequentially removed by glucosidase I (G‐I) and glucosidase II (G‐II) signalling
  entry of the resulting monoglucosylated (GlcMan9 NAc2) protein into the calnexin
  (CNX)/calreticulin (CRT) folding cycle. Calnexin is the membrane‐bound homologue
  of calreticulin and preferentially interacts with nascent proteins associated with
  the ER membrane (only calreticulin is indicated in this diagram for the sake of
  simplicity). This interaction with CNX/CRT facilitates the co‐ordinated activities
  of other chaperones such as the oxidoreductase ERp57 to further assist with folding.
  Incorrectly folded proteins are reglucosylated by UDP‐glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase
  (UGGT) signalling their re‐entry into the CNX/CRT folding cycle to undergo another
  round of chaperone‐mediated folding. In contrast, correctly folded proteins are
  acted on by G‐II, resulting in the removal of their remaining glucose residue. This
  signals release from the CNX/CRT pathway enabling export of the protein into the
  Golgi. Glycoproteins may undergo several rounds of chaperone‐mediated folding to
  assume the correct quaternary structure before continuing along the secretory pathway.
  In contrast, terminally misfolded glycoproteins are targeted for proteolytic degradation
  via the endoplasmic reticulin‐associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.
