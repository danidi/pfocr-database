caption: In response to growth signals, mTORC1 activation leads to S6K1 mediated-phosphorylation
  of CAD, the rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, thereby
  acutely stimulating an increase in pyrimidine synthesis. Through downstream effects
  on transcription factors that induce expression of key metabolic enzymes, mTORC1
  activation also increases the de novo purine synthesis pathway. One such mechanism
  involves activation of ATF4 and its induction of serine synthesis and mTHF enzymes,
  which contribute one-carbon formyl units to the purine ring. Purine and pyrimidine
  nucleotides are depicted and color coded by the source of their carbon, nitrogen,
  and oxygen moieties assembled through the de novo synthesis pathways.
