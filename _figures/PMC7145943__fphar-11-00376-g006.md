caption: FA ameliorated lipopolysaccharide-induced barrier dysfunction via miR-200c-3p-mediated
  activation of PI3K/AKT pathway in Caco-2 cells. FA exhibited the protective effects
  on LPS-induced barrier dysfunction involving in miR-200c-3p and PTEN/PI3K/Akt signaling
  pathway. FA promotes activation of PI3K/AKT pathway by miR-200c-3p-mediated suppression
  of the negative mediator PTEN, which, in turn, maintains TJ function and thus ameliorates
  LPS-induced intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction.
