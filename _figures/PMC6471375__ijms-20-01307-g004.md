caption: A schematic proposal on how toxins utilize the ER and cytosolic host factors
  in their transport to the cytosol in the mammalian or yeast cells. Yeast proteins
  are shown in magenta, mammalian proteins are shown in black. Ricin (A), Shiga toxin,
  Stx (B) and cytolethal distending toxins, CDTs (C). Role of Sec61 in ricin (A) transport
  to the cytosol is not clear. For detailed description and references, see the main
  text. Trx–thioredoxin, Crt-calreticulin, EDEMs refers to EDEM1, EDEM2, EDEM3. Derlins
  refers to Derlin-1, Derlin-2, Derlin-3. 20S refers to the core particle, whereas
  19S refers to the regulatory particle of the proteasome. For Shiga toxin (B), some
  information about the role of the ER and cytosolic ERAD proteins comes from experiments
  performed with the usage of Shiga-like toxin, SLTxA1(see the main text). Ub-ubiquitin.
  In case of cytolethal distending toxins (C) two alternative mechanisms (indicated
  as “and/or”) that may operate in these toxins’ transport from the ER to the nucleoplasm
  are considered. Direct transport from the ER to the nucleoplasm can be used by Haemophilus
  ducreyi A chain, HdCdtxB (see the main text). NLS-nuclear localization signal. In
  (A–C) for detailed description of the overall role of ERAD factors in toxin transport
  out of the ER and appropriate references, see the main text.
