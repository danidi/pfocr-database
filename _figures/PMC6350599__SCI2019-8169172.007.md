caption: Crosstalk between articular cartilage, synovium, and OA synovial fluid cells.
  Articular chondrocytes altered metabolism, shifting from the anaerobic to the glycolytic
  pathway, and other alternative sources of energy production, leading to a raise
  in glycerol and glucose concentration in the synovial fluid OA SF. Besides, synovium
  inflammation increases TGF-β and IL-4 production and reduces BMP-4 expression. These
  alterations are interpreted by the SFC as stimuli to keep proliferation and not
  to differentiate. So, synovial fluid cells keep proliferating, instead of repairing
  articular lesions.
