caption: 'An EGFR-centric view of EV biogenesis. This cartoon describes the possible
  routes taken by EGFR in its journey through and out of the cell. Top panel: degradative
  pathway at high EGF dose (left), retrieval at low dose (middle), and recycling (right).
  Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contacts with tubular buds, which lead to EGFR dephosphorylation
  by PTPB1, are also shown. Possible EGFR structures and relevant endocytic effectors
  are depicted in each location. Red frames highlight the different known pathways
  of EV biogenesis involving EGFR and its ligands, namely the ARF6-linked microvesicle
  pathway at the plasma membrane (bottom left), the classical exosome pathway involving
  sorting at the MVB (bottom middle) and the cancer-specific Large Oncosome pathway
  (bottom right).'
