caption: 'Clearance processes for apoptotic cell by phagocytes rely on “find me” and
  “eat me” signals that signal their internalization (A) “Find me” signal: apoptotic
  cells release signals that attract phagocytes to the site of programmed cell death.
  These signals include nucleotides (UTP and ATP), S1P, CX3CL1, and LPC. Phagocytes
  recognize the “find me” signals using cognate receptors such as P2Y2, S1PRs, CXCR3,
  and G2A. (B) “Eat me” signal: the apoptotic cells express “eat me” signals that
  allow phagocytes to recruit surface receptors and bridging molecules to identify
  and engulf apoptotic cells. PtdSer is a primary “eat me” signal expressed by phagocytes
  and is directly recognized by phagocytic receptors including BAI, TIM4, and stabilin
  2. Phagocytes can employ avB3 and tyrosine kinase receptor such as Mertk bind to
  PtdSer indirectly through bridging molecules such as MFG-E8 and Gas-6, respectively.
  (C) The engulfment process: after recruitment of engulfment receptors via the CRKII-ELMO-DOCK180
  complex within phagocytes, rac-1 signaling pathway is activated for phagosome formation.
  Once the phagosome is formed, LC3 is recruited to phagosomes (now the LAPosome)
  leading to lysosome-mediated digestion of the internalized apoptotic body. Degraded
  products release fatty acids that stimulate LXR and PPARγ for cholesterol efflux
  leading to the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TGF-β, IL-10 and
