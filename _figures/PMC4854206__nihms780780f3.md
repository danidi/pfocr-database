number: Figure 3
caption: 'This figure depicts chloroplast-to-nucleus and mitochondrion-to-nucleus
  retrograde signalling pathways in the higher plant cell (and in yeast and animals
  where noted). Seven different pathways are highlighted, a | The use of chloroplast-generated
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) to induce nuclear gene transcription, b | Control
  of nuclear gene regulation by the redox state of the photosynthetic electron transport
  chain (PET), c | Chloroplast Mg–protoporphyrin IX (Mg–proto) accumulation, d | Inhibition
  of plastid gene expression (PGE). c and d lead to the repression of nuclear-encoded
  chloroplast protein genes. Signals from inhibited mitochondrial gene expression
  act synergistically with the PGE pathway. Two putative Mg–proto signalling pathways
  are depicted: in pathway 1, GENOMES UNCOUPLED 1 (GUN1) or a putative GUN1-dependent
  chloroplast protein (GDCP) facilitate the export of Mg–proto from the chloroplast
  where it interacts with cytoplasmic signalling factors; in pathway 2, GUN1 or GDCP
  sense Mg–proto accumulation and other retrograde signals within the chloroplast
  and send an unidentified signal to the nucleus to control transcription of chloroplast
  protein-encoding genes, e | Mitochondrial electron transport chain (mtETC) dysfunction
  leads to transcriptional changes in the nucleus in several phyla, f | An aberrant
  mitochondrial protein leads to cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) by affecting nuclear
  gene expression, g | Mitochondrial haem synthesis as a cellular sensor for O2 availability
  in yeast. Proteins that are known to be involved in these pathways are designated
  as ovals. ABI4, abscisic acid insensitive 4; AOX, gene encoding the mitochondrial
  alternative oxidase; HAP1, haem activation protein; LHCB, gene encoding photosystem
  II chlorophyll a/b-binding protein; PQ, plastoquinone; PSI, photosystem I; ROX1,
  repressor of hypoxic genes; STN7, a thylakoid protein kinase.'
