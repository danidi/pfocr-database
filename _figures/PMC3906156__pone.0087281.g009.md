caption: Even in the absence of acute ligand stimulation, PDGFRA is constitutively,
  but slowly trafficking in glioma cells. In this trafficking process, PDGFRA is transported
  in vesicles as cargo along cytoskeleton highway. The extent of endocytosis and recycling
  of PDGFRA is sensed by the ERK activity. High ERK activity could lead to changes
  resulting in enhanced endocytosis but diminished recycling, with PDGFRA enriched
  in Golgi apparatus. As a consequence, surface PDGFRA expression is down-regulated.
  This process would dampen the ligand stimulation.
