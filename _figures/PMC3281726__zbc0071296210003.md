caption: 'Schematic models of de novo syntheses of amino acids derived from [U-13C6]glucose.
  A, model of the de novo synthesis of alanine, aspartate, and threonine. B, model
  of the de novo synthesis of aromatic acids by the shikimate pathway. Multiple 13C
  labeling is indicated by orange bars connecting 13C-labeled atoms in a given molecule.
  Amino acids shown in red boxes indicate 13C-enriched amino acids, and the blue box
  indicates uptake of the amino acid from the medium. The relative contributions in
  % of the isotopomer groups comprising different numbers of 13C-labeled atoms, as
  determined by mass spectrometry (M+0, M+3, and M+9), are given. Tryptophan is not
  detectable by the applied GC/MS method. The abbreviations used are as follows: E-4P,
  erythrose 4-phosphate; Pyr, pyruvate; OAA, oxaloacetate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate;
  aspC, aspartate aminotransferase (SPD_1373 (EC 2.6.1.1)); aroC, chorismate synthase
  (SPD_1208 (EC 4.2.3.5)); ppc, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (SPD_0953 (EC 4.1.1.31));
  zwf, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (SPD_1100 (EC 1.1.1.49)).'
