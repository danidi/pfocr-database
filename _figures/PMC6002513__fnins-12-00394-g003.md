caption: SIRTl/PGC-1α (FNDC5) pathway. Reduced expression of SIRT1- PGC-1α caused
  by many factors may impair the synthesis and respiratory function of mitochondria,
  thereby causing neuronal degeneration and cell apoptosis, thus leading to presbycusis.
  At the same time, reduced expression of SIRT1- PGC-lα in the brain can cause increased
  production of Aβ and reduced production of BDNF and thus contribute to the incidence
  of dementia. Therefore, SIRT1/PGC-lα (FNDC5) may be a possible drug target to prevent
  patients with ARHL from developing AD.
