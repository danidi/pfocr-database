caption: Bibliosphere network of ubiquinol-sensitive genes regulated in liver tissues
  of C57BL6J mice. Based on co-citations with transcription factors and other genes
  in the network (GFG level B4), 3 ubiquinol-inducible genes were connected with each
  other by BibliospherePathwayEdition Software. According to this, the uploaded genes
  seem to play a key role in PPAR-α signalling pathways. IN, input gene; TF, transcription
  factor; M, gene product is part of a metabolic pathway; ST, gene product is part
  of a Genomatix signal transduction pathway.
