caption: 'NRF2 activation in healthy and cancer cells. (A) In healthy cell, under
  normal conditions NRF2 level is inhibited by KEAP1-mediated proteasomal degradation;
  under stress conditions, NRF2 dissociates from KEAP1, accumulates in nucleus and
  activates cytoprotective gene expression. (B) In cancer cells, different molecular
  mechanisms cause constitutive NRF2 activation that results in drug resistance, stress
  adaptation, cells proliferation, and activation of metabolic reprogramming and induces
  expression of genes related to tumor progression. NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2; KEAP1, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; MAF, small musculoaponeurotic
  fibrosarcoma protein; Pol II; RNA polymerase II; ARE: antioxidant response element.'
