caption: The isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway (IBP, ) provides critical substrates
  for posttranslational modification of proteins that modulate cell signaling and
  regulatory processes [–]. The enzymes of this pathway have drawn significant attention
  aimed at development of both biological probes and potential drugs. Clinically relevant
  inhibitors of the IBP include statins such as lovastatin (1), which inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl
  co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and are used to treat hypercholesterolemia, and
  the nitrogenous bisphosphonates (NBPs) such as zoledronate (2), which inhibit the
  enzyme farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) and are used to treat osteoporosis ()
  [, ]. Studies in a variety of cancer cell lines have found that both statins and
  NBPs reduce cell proliferation, invasion, and migration [, , –]. However, because
  both the statins and the NBPs inhibit enzymes at relatively early steps of the IBP,
  the specific isoprenoid(s) responsible for altering malignant cell properties is(are)
  less clear.
