caption: Reactions and targeted genes (sdhB, fumA, fumC) of the oxidative TCA cycle
  are denoted by black arrows and black font. Reactions and targeted genes (fumB,
  frdA) of the branched, reductive TCA pathway are denoted by red arrows and red font.
  NADH and FADH2 are generated during reactions of the oxidative TCA cycle. Arrows
  indicate the direction of each reaction.
