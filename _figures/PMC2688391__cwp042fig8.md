caption: A proposed scheme showing potential alternative pathways and redundancy in
  the biosynthesis pathway of PIMs, LM, and ManLAM. PimA, PimB, and PimC are three
  characterized manosyltransferases that use phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PI) as a precursor
  lipid to synthesize lower order PIMs. PimE is implicated in the biosynthesis of
  higher order PIMs. MT1671/Rv1635c is the mannosyltransferase that adds the first
  mannose cap on M.tb ManLAM (Dinadayala et al. ; Appelmelk et al. ). The mannosyltransferase
  Rv2181 is described to have a dual function by adding α(1→2)-Manp to the ManLAM
  monocap to form the linear di- and trimannose caps and by adding α(1→2) branches
  to the mannan core of LM/LAM (Kaur et al. , ). Rv2174 is proposed in building the
  linear α(1→6) mannan core (Kaur et al. ; Mishra et al. ). GDP-mannose (GDP-Man)
  (Besra et al. ) and polyprenol monophosphomannose (PPM) (Gurcha et al. ; Baulard
  et al. ) are the proposed mannose donors in this biosynthetic pathway. EmbC is described
  as an arabinosyltransferase/transporter using decaprenol monophosphate arabinose
  (DPA) as an arabinose donor (Zhang et al. ; Berg et al. ). There are still many
  unknown manosyltransferases (ManTrs), arabinosyltransferases (AraTrs), and acyltransferases
  (AcylTrs) involved in ManLAM biosynthesis. Alternative steps or redundancy present
  in this pathway may explain how it is possible to bypass a given enzyme. As depicted,
  in each step there is primarily one enzyme implicated. It is possible that in some
  steps (i.e., conversion of Ac1PIM1 to Ac1PIM2) more than one enzyme participates
  in the process emphasizing the plasticity that can exist in this pathway. Conversely,
  as shown for Rv2181, one enzyme may direct several steps reducing considerably the
  number of transferases implicated in this pathway. AcxPIMy represents nomenclature
  where it is implicit that PIMy already has two acyl groups located in its glycerol,
  “x” = 1 or 2 defines tri-acylated or tetra-acylated PIMy, and “y” denotes the number
  of mannoses. The same nomenclature is applied for AcxLM, AcXLAM, and AcxManLAM.*AcxPIMy
  components are produced from steps in the biosynthesis of ManLAM that deviate to
  alternatively synthesize*PIM6,*Ac1PIM6 or*Ac2PIM6 as final products. AcylTrans*
  stands for potential succinyl-, malyl- and/or lactyl-transferases.
