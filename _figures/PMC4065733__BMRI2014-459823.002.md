caption: Regulation of autophagy and possible targets of the autophagy enhancer drugs.
  Drugs that modulate autophagy can be divided into two categories depending on whether
  or not they act through mTOR, a master negative regulator of autophagy that functions
  through the formation of mTORC1 complex. This complex is suppressed by specific
  inhibitors such as rapamycin and its analogs, which therefore enhance autophagy
  []. A recent study showed that ezetimibe perturbed the cholesterol homeostasis and
  decreased mTOR recruitment to late endosome/lysosome; thus ezetimibe is thought
  to induce autophagy by suppressing mTORC1 []. The mTOR signaling pathway can also
  be regulated by specific inhibitors target to the upstream of mTOR, for example,
  PI3K inhibitor []. In addition, nuclear translocation of TFEB promoted autophagic
  degradation of ATZ in PiZ mouse model []. There is evidence showing that TFEB interacts
  with mTORC1 on the lysosomal membrane; because it promotes phosphorylation of TFEB,
  mTORC1 is now considered an antagonist of TFEB activity []. Tat-beclin 1 peptide
  is identified as a potent inducer of autophagy and enhances the degradation of mutant
  huntingtin and several invasive bacterial and viral pathogens []. Several autophagy
  enhancer drugs identified from the recent drug screenings, including the phenothiazines,
  are thought to act on autophagy by mTOR-independent mechanism(s) [, , ]. One of
  the phenothiazines that have been investigated, fluspirilene, is thought to induce
  autophagy by reducing intracellular Ca2+ and preventing calpain-1-mediated cleavage
  of autophagy gene ATG5 []. The mood-stabilizing effects of lithium are thought to
  involve inhibition of IMPase and prevention of inositol recycling, while CBZ and
  valproic acid appear to act on Ins [, ]. The inhibition of IMPase or Ins leads to
  reduced intracellular inositol and IP3 levels, which therefore induce autophagy.
  However, the precise mechanism by which autophagy is regulated by the calcium-related
  signaling pathway or the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway has not been elucidated.
  In addition, further work on whether these targets are truly independent of mTOR
  is needed.
