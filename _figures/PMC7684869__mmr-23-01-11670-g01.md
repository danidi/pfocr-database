caption: Schematic figure of NPY and leptin in local homeostasis of bone remodeling.
  NPY is widely distributed in central nervous system, with the highest distribution
  in the arcuate nucleus. Y1 receptors are mainly expressed in peripheral tissues
  such as osteoblasts and osteoclast lineage cells, and high levels of Y2 receptors
  are expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and hippocampus. NPY from
  the peripheral and central nervous system is negatively correlated with osteoblast
  activity and bone mass. The underlying mechanism may be inhibition of the cAMP signaling
  pathway, followed by phosphorylation of ERK. NPY affects the activities of osteoclasts
  by inhibiting the response of osteoclasts to RANKL. The Y1 and Y2 NPY receptor subtypes
  were speculated to share the same downstream pathway, as simultaneous silencing
  of the two receptor genes did not result in an additional increase in bone mass.
  Decrease in Y1 receptor expression on the BMSCs is considered to be an important
  factor linking central and peripheral NPY circuits to bone. Inhibition of bone formation
  by leptin through central regulation at hypothalamus is the main process in bone
  metabolism. Leptin can reduce the action potential of serotonergic neurons in the
  brainstem. Serotonin binds to 5-HT2C receptors expressed on neurons in the ventromedial
  hypothalamus to regulate bone mass. Leptin acts on the hypothalamus to inhibit the
  expression of NPY, which subsequently leads to enhanced bone anabolism. Decreased
  CART expression was reported in the hypothalamus of ob/ob obese leptin-deficient
  mice, which induces osteoporosis and an increase in bone resorption. Leptin can
  also activate its receptors in osteoblasts and osteoclasts to inhibit bone resorption
  and promote bone formation, partly through increasing the amount of osteoprotectin
  and reducing the secretion of RANKL. 5-HT2CR, 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptor; BMSCs,
