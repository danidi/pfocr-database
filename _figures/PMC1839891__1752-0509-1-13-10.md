caption: In this model, the tumor growth process is replaced with the cell cycle model
  from figure 7. Components of the hedgehog pathway now interact directly with cyclin
  D1; mitotic cyclin (cyclin B) is required for Nmyc phosphorylation to the active
  Nmyc-P state. b. If the cell cycle is activated by injecting Nmyc-P initially, the
  effect of other components on the cycle can be studied. In this figure, IGF is decreased
  beginning on day 6, allowing GSK-3β to increase. Nmyc-P is then phosphorylated and
  degraded. The effects of drug dose will be the same for this model as in figure
  9, as the primary action of the drug on Gli2 has not been changed. However, adding
  details to the cell cycle now allows more detailed investigation of the interaction
  between the drug, its targets, and cell cycle components.
