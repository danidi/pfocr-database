caption: Immune responses and immunotherapy strategy in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Immune
  response to SARS‐CoV‐2 involving innate and adaptive immunity. A1, SARS‐CoV‐2 enters
  the host cells by binding the receptor for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
  The infected cells then release interferon type I (IFN‐α/β); innate immune cells
  respond to the IFNs by establishing an antiviral state. In case of severe infection,
  the viruses are sensed by monocytes, tissue macrophages, and resident dendritic
  cells resulting in uncontrolled proinflammatory cytokine (IFN, TNF‐α, IL‐1β, and
  IL‐6) production, leading to a phenomenon called the cytokine storm, which damages
  the host’s respiratory epithelial cells. Exhausted natural killer cells with increased
  expression of the inhibitory receptor, NKG2A, are also seen in SARS‐CoV‐2. A2, In
  SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, increased antibody production and poor T cell responses are
  observed (A2). CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell numbers decrease, and the exhausted phenotype,

  death receptor‐1 (PD‐1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen‐4 (CTLA‐4),
  is seen. Immunotherapy strategies for SARS‐CoV‐2 have been proposed. B1, Transferring
