caption: 'A: schematic representation of the redox signaling pathways that are postulated
  to lead to adaptive activation of transcription factors and upregulation of the
  expression of cytoprotective proteins following contractile activity in skeletal
  muscle. TF, transcription factor. [Redrawn and updated from Jackson and McArdle
  ().] B: putative sites at which the redox signaling pathway may be modified in aging
  leading to a failure of adaptive responses to contractile activity. Excess hydrogen
  peroxide generated by mitochondria in the muscle during aging may influence the
  pathway shown in A at multiple points: prevention of activation of NADPH oxidase;
  a chronic increase in cytosolic hydrogen peroxide; aberrant chronic oxidation of
  glutathione and other redox sensitive signaling proteins; oxidation of the nuclear
  environment leading to a failure of TF to activate transcription. AP1, activator
  protein-1; HSF1, heat shock factor-1; Nrf2, nuclear transcription factor erythroid
  2p45-related factor-2.'
