caption: Classic model of basal ganglia in normal condition, parkinsonian, and dyskinetic
  conditions. During LID the different population of striatal cells from direct and
  indirect circuit are opposite to parkinsonian state. LID would result from a decrease
  in the inhibitory pathway by striatal neurons in the indirect pathway to the GPe,
  leading to an inhibitory increment over the STN and consequently reducing STN and
  GPi/SNr activity. This is facilitated by the increase in the inhibitory striatal
  activity of GPi by the direct pathway from striatum.
