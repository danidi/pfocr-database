caption: Proposed signaling pathways of PS1-induced apoptosis. Data produced in this
  study support the hypothesis that PS1 could induce apoptosis through two pathways,
  γ-secretase-dependent and γ-secretase-independent pathways. In the γ-secretase-dependent
  pathway, PS1 first catalyzes the turnover of c-FLIP, leading to the activation of
  caspase-8, which in turn activates tBid, resulting in Bax translocation and the
  release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO. PS1-induced apoptosis through this pathway
  can be inhibited by γ-secretase inhibitor. In the γ-secretase-independent pathway,
  PS1 stimulates PSAP-Bax complex formation and subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction.
  Activated caspase-8 may directly activate caspase-3 and -7, leading to apoptosis.
  However, the finding that knockdown of Bax almost completely blocked PS1-induced
  apoptosis indicates that the contribution of this direct pathway is negligible.
