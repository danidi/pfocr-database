caption: Wnt ligands bind to transmembrane receptors of the Frizzled family. Secreted
  factors such as WIFs and SFRPs compete with Wnt ligands for binding. Activated receptor
  signals through Dishevelled and Casein kinase 1 (CK1) to a protein complex containing
  glycogen synthase kinase–3 (GSK3), axis inhibition protein 1 (Axin), and APC. The
  APC complex constitutively directs β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation. The
  Wnt signal inhibits the APC complex, leading to β-catenin stabilization and accumulation
  in the nucleus. Nuclear β-catenin binds T cell factor (Tcf) transcription factors
  to drive expression of genes such as c-Myc and Cyclin D1 that support cell growth,
  proliferation, and survival. Oncogenes are shown in green; tumor suppressor genes
  are shown in red. In this issue of the JCI, Kansara et al. provide evidence that
  WIF1 is a tumor suppressor and that epigenetic silencing of WIF1 accelerates osteosarcomagenesis
  ().

  description: Wnt ligands bind to transmembrane receptors of the Frizzled family.
