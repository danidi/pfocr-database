caption: Complex sugar signal transduction networks for  differential and coordinated
  regulation of gene expression. a, Signal  transduction in sugar-provided cells.
  Suc may be sensed by the receptor  directly, or it may be converted to Glc and Fru
  and sensed by  hexokinase-dependent or hexokinase-independent pathway. The sugar  signal
  transduction pathway may overlap or be independent of the sugar  metabolic pathway.
  b, Signal transduction in Suc-starved cells. The  signals of sugar starvation and
  environmental stresses may be perceived  by the same receptor or by different receptors
  but the signal pathways  converge downstream. R, Receptor; INV, invertase. The solid
  arrows  indicate pathways proposed based upon currently available  information.
  +, −; Positive and negative regulation,  respectively.
