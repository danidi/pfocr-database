caption: 'Left panel: Targeting of C3-opsonized bacteria to the autophagy pathway.
  Upon internalization, C3-coated bacteria are detected in the cytosol by the autophagy
  protein ATG16L1, which interacts directly with C3. This interaction initiates ATG16L1-dependent
  autophagy, which leads to the targeting of the bacteria to autophago-lysosomes for
  degradation. Right panel: Cytosolic sensing of C3-coated microbes triggers host
  defense. Bacteria and nonenveloped viruses that had been opsonized with C3 activation
  fragments in the extracellular setting can be sensed in the cytosol in a C3-dependent
  manner. This detection induces mitochondrial anti-viral signaling (MAVS), resulting
  in the activation of proinflammatory responses. Cytosolic detection of C3-opsonized
  viruses can, moreover, lead to proteasome-mediated viral degradation.'
