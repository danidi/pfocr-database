caption: 'Models for release of the Xenopus oocyte prophase block: probable cooperation
  between several receptors and downstream pathways. The constitutively active Gαs-coupled
  GPR185 maintains high cAMP and PKA activity, ensuring the prophase arrest (red pathway—right).
  The prophase release (green pathway—left) is triggered by steroids, mainly progesterone,
  with the potential contribution of IGF-1 and its receptor (IGF-1R). Progesterone
  could interact with its canonical nuclear receptor (iPR) but also a plasma membrane-bound
  receptor (mPR). Upon binding to progesterone, these receptors could inhibit the
  GPR185 pathway, and/or independently inhibit adenylate cyclase by recruiting Gαi
  or inhibiting GαS. They could also launch positive downstream signalling independently
  of cAMP and PKA. These cascades converge to the synthesis of new proteins required
  for activating MPF.'
