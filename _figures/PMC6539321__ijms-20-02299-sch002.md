caption: Biosynthesis of S-allyl-L-homocysteine (Sahc) using a re-directed metabolism
  of homocysteine in E. coli B834(DE3). In situ Sahc 4 production is simultaneously
  coupled with its residue-specific insertion as a response to all AUG codons in the
  mRNA sequence of recombinant target protein. The metX and metY genes are imported
  in E. coli [,] from methionine metabolism of C. glutamicum. MetX (metA homologue)
  encodes for homoserine O-acetyltransferase activity whereas metY (metB homologue)
  encodes O-acylhomoserine synthetase (thiolase), which catalyses the second step
  of the Met biosynthetic pathway of C. glutamicum [].
