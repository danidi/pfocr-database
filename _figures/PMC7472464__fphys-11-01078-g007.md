caption: The overview of metabolic reprogramming in adipose tissue in EgPSC infected
  mice. The metabolism diagram which shows the expression profile of key enzymes.
  “lipoxygenase” pathways were significantly upregulated while “glycolysis,” “tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle,” “pentose phosphate pathway,” and “de novo lipogenesis” pathways
  were dramatically downregulated. Enzymes identified in our study are marked in red
  oval (upregulated) and green oval (downregulated), while other enzymes are marked
  in blue oval. HK, hexokinase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; FBP, fructose bisphosphatase;
  PHI, phosphate isomerase; PK, pyruvate kinase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex;
  G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6GPDH, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase;
  CS, citrate synthase; CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase;
  ACO, aconitase; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; αKGDH, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase;
  FH, fumarate hydratase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; ACOD1, aconitate decarboxylase
  1; ACC1, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase-1; FAS, fatty acid synthase; SREBP-1c, sterol
  regulatory element-binding protein-1c.
