caption: Methylthioadenosine (MTA) metabolic pathway. MTA can be created from two
  pathways, both requiring S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a precursor. First, SAM can
  spontaneously degrade to form MTA. The second pathway is through the use of decarboxylated
  SAM (dcSAM) in polyamine synthesis. dcSAM is required for the formation of spermidine
  from putrescine and spermine from spermidine. Each reaction generates MTA as a by-product.
  MTA is then metabolized via a series of enzymatic reactions in the methionine (Met)
  salvage pathway to form additional Met. SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine.
