caption: 'Metabolic pathways for the whole cell biosynthesis of 2′-fucosyllactose
  (2′-FL) in Escherichia coli. Salvage GDP-L-fucose pathway enzyme is depicted in
  red, de novo GDP-L-fucose synthesis pathway enzymes in blue and α1,2-fucosyltransferase
  enzyme in green. Enzymes and molecules are abbreviated as follows: Gal, D-galactose;
  GDP-4k-6d-Man, GDP-4-keto-6-deoxymannose; GDP-Man, GDP-α-D-mannose; GDP-L-Fuc, GDP-β-L-fucose;
  Glc, D-glucose; FucP, fucose permease; GlpF, glycerol MIP channel; LacY, lactose
  permease; Man-1P, α-D-mannose-1-phosphate; Man-6P, α-D-mannose-6-phosphate; ManB,
  phosphomannomutase; ManC, mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase; Gmd, GDP-mannose
  4,6-dehydratase; WcaG, GDP-fucose synthase; FutC, α1,2-fucosyltransferase; LacZ,
  β-galactosidase.'
