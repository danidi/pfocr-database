caption: The key genetic alteration driving the initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
  is activating KRAS mutations, which are found in > 90% of cases. mTOR functions
  downstream of KRAS to maintain the stemness of pancreatic CSCs. Therefore, the inhibition
  of mTOR by rapamycin reduced sphere formation and anchorage-independent cell growth
  and viability in CD133+ cells, which were likely CSCs. The Hedgehog pathway also
  functions to maintain pancreatic CSCs. However, the inhibition of these two pathways
  led to different cellular effects, suggesting that mTOR has specific function(s)
  in addition to the common function of maintaining the stemness of pancreatic CSCs.
  mTOR-mediated tumor suppressor responses have been reported in normal and cancer
  stem cells in another cell type, showing a candidate of mTOR specific function(s)
  in pancreatic cancer cells.
