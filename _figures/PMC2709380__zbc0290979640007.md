caption: Hypothetical model of transcriptional regulation of the p21 gene and p53
  pathway. A, p53 pathway and ZBTB2 targets. ZBTB2 repressed transcription of the
  ARF, p53, and p21 genes and activated HDM2 gene transcription. Solid line with arrowhead
  (→), transcriptional activation; solid line with ⊥, transcriptional repression.
  Solid line with double arrowhead (↔), molecular interaction; *, inhibition of transcription
  factor binding. B, hypothetical model of transcriptional regulation of p21 by ZBTB2
  under three different cellular conditions. ZBTB2 represses transcription of the
  cell cycle arrest gene p21 by binding to the proximal GC-box 5/6 elements and the
  two distal p53 binding elements by competition with either Sp1 and/or p53. ZBTB2
  interacts with p53 via its zinc fingers and also interacts with Sp1 via its POZ
  domain and zinc fingers. These protein-protein interactions inhibit Sp1 or p53 binding
  to their respective binding elements. ZBTB2 attacks the three critical elements
  that are important in basal constitutive and inducible expression. ZBTB2 recruits
  co-repressor-HDAC complexes, which deacetylate histones Ac-H3 and -H4 at the proximal
  promoter to repress transcription. Tsp (+1), transcription start site.
