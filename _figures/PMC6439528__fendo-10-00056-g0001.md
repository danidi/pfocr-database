caption: 'Pathogenesis of diabetic complications. The figure presents the pathogenic
  mechanisms of diabetes mellitus (DM; red block, section Pathogenic Mechanisms of
  Diabetic Complications of main text) that cause microvascular complications (blue
  block) and macrovascular complications (yellow block). Destruction of pancreatic
  B cells in T1DM and insulin resistance in T2DM result in hyperglycemia. The resulting
  increase of intracellular glucose in microvascular target cells, such as capillary
  endothelial cells, causes ROS production in the mitochondria, activating four pathogenic
  downstream pathways: polyol pathway, AGEs & RAGE pathway, PKC pathway, hexosamine
  pathway (section Hyperglycemia of main text). Especially in T2DM, insulin resistance
  and the abundance of (visceral) adipose tissue result in an excess flux of free
  fatty acids (FFAs), which are oxidized in the mitochondria of macrovascular endothelial
  cells. This causes activation of the same pathogenic pathways, and downregulation
  of protective enzymes such as eNOS and prostacyclin synthase. Pathway-selective
  insulin resistance also contributes to microvascular complications (section Insulin
  Resistance of main text). Moreover, insulin resistance and circulating FFAs result
  in dyslipidemia, contributing to both micro- and macrovascular complications (section
  Dyslipidemia of main text). Hypertension contributes to the harmful processes by
  activating endothelial cells, inducing a cellular inflammatory response and reducing
  the availability of nitric oxide, causing vasoconstriction (section Hypertension
  of main text). All these processes mainly exert their harmful effects by upregulation
  of a pro-inflammatory state at vulnerable sites. Together with an impaired immune
  response and consequently higher susceptibility for infections, this immune dysfunction
  plays a pivotal role in the development of diabetic complications (section Immune
  Dysfunction of main text). Possible oral complications that are discussed in this
  review are listed in the green block at the bottom of the figure (section Potential
  Oral Complications of Diabetes Mellitus of main text). eNOS, endothelial Nitric
  Oxide Synthase; FFAs, Free Fatty Acids; GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate Dehydrogenase;
  GBM, Glomerular Basement Membrane; PKC, Protein Kinase C; (R)AGEs, (Receptor for)
  Advanced Glycation End products; ROS, Reactive Oxygen Species.'
