caption: 'Metabolism and synthesis of the major bile acids in mouse. Key: Color denotes
  family of bile acids, that is, primary bile acids synthesized in liver in black,
  secondary bile acids synthesized in liver and processed by microflora in green and
  tertiary bile acids synthesized in liver, processed by microflora and re-metabolized
  in liver through enterohepatic recirculation in orange. Conjugation with taurine
  and glycine is colored in blue and red respectively. Key intermediates in the pathway
  are colored in gray.'
