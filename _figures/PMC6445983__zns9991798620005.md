caption: A model for the role of RNB in the s-LNv master pacemaker neurons. In the
  s-LNvs, UNF and E75 cooperatively enhance the transcription of per. UNF also binds
  to the Rnb gene and promotes its expression. RNB interacts with the molecular clock
  feedback loops to reinforce molecular oscillations and output rhythms. The role
  of RNB might be mediated by some of the molecular clock components (*) that are
  also involved in the Wnt/Wingless signaling pathway.
