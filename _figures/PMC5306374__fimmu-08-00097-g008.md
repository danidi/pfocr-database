caption: Model indicating the two-step increase in ex vivo lymphocyte Fas surface
  expression. First, following human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 infection,
  there is an increase in lymphocyte Fas expression (%) in AC. Second, upon progression
  to HAM/TSP, Fas expression is increased on a per-cell basis as mean fluorescence
  intensity (MFI) (Figures A,B). In agreement with its role as a death receptor, Fas+
  cells in HC are primed to follow the apoptotic pathway, depicting nuclear condensation
  and cell blebbing, which is lost upon HTLV-1 infection (AC). In contrast, in HAM/TSP
  patients, Fashi cells are driven toward proliferation (Figures A,B). We recently
  discovered a genotype/phenotype interaction for the FAS -670 polymorphism with both
  apoptosis and proliferation in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients and healthy
  controls (Khouri et al., submitted). This Fashi proliferating and chemotherapy-resistant
  leukemic phenotype is in agreement with the recently discovered CD4 T stem cell
  memory (Tscm) hierarchical apex of ATL. The same FAS -670 polymorphism also determined
  CD4 Tscm levels in a genome-wide twin study, confirming our hypothesis (Khouri et
  al., submitted). Therefore, a genetically determined interferon (IFN)/STAT1/FAS
  axis might help explain the proliferative, non-apoptotic phenotype in HAM/TSP suggesting
  CD4 Tscm as a pivotal factor not only in ATL but also in HAM/TSP pathogenesis. Considering
  STAT1 and FAS are in the HAM/TSP gene signature, our data further refine the data
  of Tattermusch et al. () It is not unexpected that a Tscm phenotype is absent from
  the disease signature, since Tscm are rare (2–3%) () and their genome-wide expression
  profile is intermediate between naïve and central memory T cells. However, Tscm
  cells have a Fashi, apoptosis-resistant, and drug-resistant, proliferative phenotype,
  in agreement with their stem cell-like nature. Interestingly, the proliferating
  cells in HAM/TSP patients were almost exclusively Fashi (Figure B), compatible with
  a Tscm phenotype.
