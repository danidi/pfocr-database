caption: Control of Swi6 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Swi6 possesses two nuclear localization
  (NLS) signals, NLS1 and NLS2, which are both regulated by phosphorylation. NLS1
  is regulated through the cell cycle, and its function is blocked by phosphorylation
  on Ser160 by the S-phase CDK, Clb6/Cdc28, resulting in cytoplasmic localization
  of Swi6 at times other than G1. NLS2 is regulated by cell wall stress and its function
  is blocked by Mpk1 phosphorylation on Ser238. This feedback inhibitory event down-regulates
  cell wall stress-induced transcription after activation. Together, these two disparate
  signals converge to control Swi6 nuclear localization under different conditions.
  The indicated karyopherins recognize each NLS.
