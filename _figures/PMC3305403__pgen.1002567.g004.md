caption: Nme3Tcd2b encodes a hypomorphic allele of Nme3 leading to reduction of NME3
  activity in sperm derived from a t/+ male. NME3 may be an activator of the inhibitory
  Rho signaling pathway or an inhibitor of the activating pathway controlling SMOK
  activity, or both. NME3Tcd2b thus might synergize with TAGAP1Tcd1a to reduce inhibition
  and/or with FGD2Tcd2a to enhance activation of SMOK in all sperm. The combined activity
  of all distorters leads to impairment of sperm motility, which is rescued exclusively
  in t-sperm by the responder encoding the dominant-negative variant SMOKTCR, resulting
  in transmission ratio distortion in favor of t-sperm. Red upward pointing arrows
  indicate up-regulation, blue down-pointing arrows down-regulation; the green down-pointing
  arrow symbolizes rescued, the dark-red down-pointing arrow impaired flagellar motility.
