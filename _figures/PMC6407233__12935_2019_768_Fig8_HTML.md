caption: Proposed model for MAPK inhibition in paired TP53WT and TP53MUT cell lines
  selected for resistance to MDM2 inhibitors. WM35-R (a) and SN40R2 (b) were selected
  from WM35 and SJSA-1 respectively and both were sensitive to growth inhibition by
  MAPK pathway inhibition. The TP53MUT cells lost p53-dependent apoptosis but retained
  p53-independent cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in response to inhibition
  of the MAPK pathway. SJSA-1 showed minimal p53-dependent apoptosis in response to
  MAPK pathway inhibition, plausibly resulting from p53 suppression by overexpression
  of MDM2
