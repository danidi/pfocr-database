caption: The TGF-β signaling pathway and mechanisms of inhibition during leukemogenesis.
  TGF-β binds TβRII, directly or through TβRIII, inducing association of TβRII with
  TβRI. TβRII then phosphorylates and activates TβRI, which then phosphorylates Smad2
  or Smad3. SARA acts to concentrate Smad2/3 near the cell surface, facilitating their
  phosphorylation by TβRI. Phosphorylated Smad2/3 associate with Smad4 and translocate
  into the nucleus, where they activate transcription of target genes. Smad7 inhibits
  TGF-β signaling by preventing TβRI's activation of Smad2/3. In leukemias, disease-specific
  oncoproteins disrupt this pathway through different mechanisms. PML-RARα prevents
  the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by interrupting the formation of TGF-β receptor/SARA/Smad
  complexes. AML/ETO, AML/EVI-1, and Evi-1 inhibit Smad3 DNA binding and recruit the
  transcription repressor, CtBP. Tax disrupts the interaction of Smads with the transcriptional
  coactivator CBP/p300 and blocks the formation of Smad2/3/4 complexes.
