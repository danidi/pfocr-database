caption: Schematic of the canonical vertebrate Wnt signaling pathway. Wnt proteins
  stimulate signaling via the Frizzled receptors, the LRP5/6 co-receptor and the Dishevelled
  protein to inactivate the β-catenin degradation complex, which consists of Axin,
  APC and GSK3. DKK1 is a secreted Wnt antagonist. (A) The inhibition of GSK3 activity
  results in β-catenin stabilization (green arrow) and in the transcriptional activation
  of target genes mediated by β-catenin in complex with TCF proteins. (B) Wnt signaling
  also stimulates the HIPK2-dependent elimination of TCF3-mediated target repression,
  during which β-catenin appears to act as a scaffold for TCF3 phosphorylation. Negative
  interactions are shown in red; dashed lines represent a hypothetical effect. APC,
  adenomatous polyposis coli; DKK1, dickkopf 1; Dvl, Dishevelled; GSK3, glycogen synthase
  kinase 3; HIPK2, homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2; LRP5/6, low density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 5/6; TCF, T-cell factor.
