caption: 'Tumour-suppressor functions: The PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway is negatively regulated
  by PTEN in the cytoplasm through the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
  (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2). Increased activation of
  PI3K–AKT–mTOR leads to abnormal cell growth and proliferation. Cell senescence:
  PTEN also regulates cell senescence through the PI3K–AKT–mTOR network: the mTOR
  complex directly phosphorylates p53 that promotes the accumulation of p21. Consequently,
  p21 induces cell senescence. Nuclear PTEN also interacts with the anaphase-promoting
  complex (APC) and regulates cellular senescence through an APC–cadherin 1 complex.
  In this manner, PTEN loss promotes cell senescence as a failsafe against tumorigenesis.
  Immune and inflammatory response: PTEN negatively regulates the nuclear factor κB
  (NF-κB) signalling pathway through chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (CHD1),
  which is ubiquitinated (Ub) in the presence of PTEN and thus is unable to promote
  the transcription of NF-κB genes in the nucleus. On the other hand, PTEN-L promotes
  the nuclear import of p65, which consequently induces the transcription of NF-κB
  genes. The presence of cytoplasmic DNA—as a consequence of genomic instability—activates
  the STING pathway, which phosphorylates interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). PTEN
  and PTEN-L are required for the migration of IRF3 into the nucleus, where this transcription
  factor mediates the immune response by promoting the expression of type I interferon
  (IFN) genes, such as interleukin (IL)-6 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1).
  DNA integrity: The concomitant presence of DNA damage repair (DDR) gene mutations
  or genome instability leads to double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in the DNA, which often
  causes self-DNA to migrate into the cytoplasm. Such genomic changes are also controlled
  by PTEN, since this tumour suppressor regulates cell cycle checkpoints, maintains
  centrosome stability and is involved in DNA repair.'
