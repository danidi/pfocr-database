caption: Signaling pathway explains how PERK activation affects CREB signaling and
  memory impairment. The phosphorylation of PERK is critical for memory dysfunction
  following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The phosphorylated PERK, in turn, phosphorylates
  a postsynaptic protein PSD95 and a transcription factor CREB which plays a critical
  role in cognitive functionin the brain. PERK phosphorylates CREB at its S129 residue
  and prevents the interaction between phosphorylated CREB with CBP and blocks the
  active transcriptional complex formation in the nucleus to attenuate the transcription
  of mRNA responsible for BDNF, cfos, and Arc which are essential for early memory
  genes. On the other hand, phosphorylation of PSD95 by PERKat its T19 residue leads
  to its degradation. Since PSD95 functions as a scaffold protein, the absence of
  PSD95 affects the surface expression of AMPAR and NMDAR. In digest, inactivation
  of CREB and loss of expression of PSD95 affects dendritic spine formation and ultimately
  compromises memory function following TBI.
