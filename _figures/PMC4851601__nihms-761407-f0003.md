caption: Leading strand replicase Pol ε (dark green circle associated with PCNA represented
  as grey oval) incorporates high number of rNMPs that are used as strand discrimination
  for newly synthesized DNA. In yeast Top1 can cleave rNMPs, although in a minor pathway
  that is only evident in the absence of RNase H2. Top1 (represented as purple filled
  oval) cleaves at the 3′-end of the rNMP forming a 2′-3′ cyclic phosphate that creates
  unligatable ends. A second Top1 cleaving a few nucleotides upstream would generate
  a gap that could be filled by the replicative polymerase in an error-free manner.
  In a sequence with a tandem repeat Top1 could induce realignment in a mutagenic
  way. RNase H2 (represented as three blue circles) cleaves at the 5′-end of the rNMP
  (red rA) initiating the RER process that includes strand displacement synthesis
  (represented as green circle associated with PCNA represented as grey oval), flap
  removal and ligation identical to OF maturation. The nick created in the DNA by
  RNase H2 at the rNMP can be used by the MMR system (represented as green and yellow
  ovals) to access mispaired nucleotides in a strand-specific manner. Lagging strand
  replicase Pol δ (represented as green circle associated with PCNA represented as
  grey oval) incorporates low number of rNMPs. The discontinuous nature of lagging
  strand DNA synthesis permits the loading of the MMR system before OF maturation.
  RER initiated by RNase H2 can occur concomitant with OF processing or independently.
  Black represents the template strand, blue the newly synthesized DNA and red the
  RNA primer of OF.
