caption: The putative role of miR-146a in CVB infection. CVB3 triggers an inflammatory
  response by activating NF-κB through multiple inductions (dashed lines). The activated
  NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and binds to the genomic locus of miR-146a in
  chromosome 5 to initiate the transcription of the downstream RNA including primary
  miR-146a. After a mature process, miR-146a conversely suppresses the NF-κB pathway
  by doubly blocking TLR3 and TRAF6. Through the negative feedback by miR-146a, the
  inflammation caused by CVB can be precisely controlled to an adequate level so that
  the viruses can be eliminated but the tissue is not overinjured.
