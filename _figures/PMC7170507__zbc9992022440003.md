caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway of 1-4. The 3-HBA generated by Nat-hyg5 from
  chorismate, the end product of shikimate pathway, could be accepted as a starter
  unit to produce 1-4 by neoantimycin NRPS-PKS, which originally uses 3-FAS as starting
  precursor to produce 5 and 6 (, ). A, adenylation; T, thiolation; C, condensation;
  KR, ketoreductase; KS, ketosynthase; AT, acyltransferase; MT, methyltransferase;
  ACP, acyl-carrier protein; TE, thioesterase. The dimethyl extender unit in M4 was
  confirmed to be generated by the MT domain acting twice upon a malonate unit loaded
  by the AT domain ().
