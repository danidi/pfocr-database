caption: Summary of iAs effects on regulators of G1/(S)phase. Protein interactions
  (shown as solid arrows) and transcriptional targets (dotted arrows) along the E2F1-Rb
  pathway. All components of this pathway showed decreased activity or transcription
  after treatment with iAs, with the exception of Rb, whose activity is increased.
