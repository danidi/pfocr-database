caption: Diagram summarizing our findings. 14-3-3γ may have a beneficial effect in
  depressing LPS-induced inflammatory response in DCMECs through inhibiting NF-κB
  and MAPKs and up-regulating mTOR signaling pathway. Green arrows indicated that
  LPS get into the cell membrane; Blue arrows indicated that 14-3-3γ regulated genes
  expression; Black arrows indicated that change of genes expression had effects.
