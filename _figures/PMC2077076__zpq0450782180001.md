caption: 'Current model for FeMo-co biosynthesis and insertion into apo-NifDK. The
  model shows in dark blue the core components of the FeMo-co biosynthesis pathway:
  NifB, NifEN, and NifH (this work). Simple [Fe-S] clusters (most likely [2Fe-2S]
  and [4Fe-4S]), which can be chemically reconstituted on NifB, are converted into
  NifB-co precursor in a reaction that requires SAM and reducing conditions. Presumably,
  NifS and NifU would be responsible for the synthesis of those “NifB-co precursors”
  on NifB in vivo (, ). NifB-co is a common precursor for the biosynthesis of FeMo-co
  and the cofactors for the alternative nitrogenases, iron–vanadium cofactor and iron-only
  cofactor. NifEN binds NifB-co and converts it into the VK cluster. Incorporation
  of Mo and R-homocitrate into the VK cluster and final assembly of FeMo-co require
  NifH and MgATP. The resulting FeMo-co is inserted into apo-NifDK to activate it.
  Analogous reactions are hypothesized to occur during the maturation of alternative
  nitrogenases. The model shows in light blue the other Nif/Naf proteins known to
  participate in FeMo-co biosynthesis and insertion into apo-NifDK. NifS, NifU, NifQ,
  and NifV provide physiologically relevant forms of Fe, S, Mo, and R-homocitrate.
  NifX and NafY may assist NifB, NifEN, and NifDK on FeMo-co precursor trafficking
  among them and may serve as a reservoir of precursors giving some buffering capacity
  to the pathway.'
