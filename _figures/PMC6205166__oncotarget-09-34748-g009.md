caption: 'In 85As2 cells, the TLR5 signaling pathway is activated through increased
  IRAK-1/4 expression relative to that in the parent cell line MKN45cl85. Increased
  plasma LIF levels caused by increased LIF production through activation of the TLR5
  signaling pathway may contribute to the onset or aggravation of 85As2 cell-induced
  cancer cachexia in rats. IRAK; interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase; LIF: leukemia
  inhibitory factor; TLR: Toll-like receptor.'
