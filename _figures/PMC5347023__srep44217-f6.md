caption: An HC diet increased the concentration of GC in the plasma and AMPKα activation.
  Activated AMPKα increases the expression and transcriptional activity of PPARα,
  thereby increasing the expression of lipolytic genes, including CPT-1, CPT-2, L-FABP
  and ACO. AMPKα activation inhibits the expression and transcriptional activity of
  SREBP-1c, thereby reducing the expression of lipogenic genes, including ACC, FAS,
  and SCD-1. In addition, activated AMPKα directly phosphorylates and inhibits ACC.
  Consequently, an HC diet increases lipolysis and reduces lipid synthesis in the
  livers of lactating cows.
