caption: Innate immune antimicrobial pathways are conserved in arthropods. Insects
  utilize RNAi (A), STING-mediated immunity (B), and JAK/STAT signaling (D) in order
  to effectively respond to various arboviruses at different stages of infection.
  The IIS pathway (C) is an important mediator in host immunity as it regulates which
  immune responses are active or suppressed. During times of starvation, RNAi is more
  active while the bloodmeal provides the needed insulin to suppress RNAi and activate
  JAK/STAT. STING-mediated immunity has not yet been directly linked to IIS but may
  be affected by broader nutritional signaling. Each of these pathways, to varying
  degrees, are conserved in fly, mosquito, and human systems with different efficiencies
  in responding to viral infection.
