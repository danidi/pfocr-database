caption: 'Pathways leading to oxidative stress in PD and the modulation by PD-related
  genes. Different pathways contribute to high levels of oxidative stress in dopaminergic
  neurons, including impaired DA handling (1), mitochondrial dysfunction (2), and
  neuroinflammation (3). As further discussed in the text, alterations in PD genes
  can potentiate all these impairments and, therefore, lead to enhanced levels of
  oxidative stress (see ). UPS dysfunction (4), another important pathogenic pathway
  in PD, can contribute to the damaging effects of α-syn, due to improper degradation
  of α-syn mutants or oligomers. Abbreviations: ACO: aconitase, CYT: cytosolic, DA:
  dopamine, iNOS: inducible nitric oxide synthase, PHOX: NADPH oxidase, UPS: ubiquitin
  proteasome system, UCP: uncoupling proteins, VESIC: vesicular.'
