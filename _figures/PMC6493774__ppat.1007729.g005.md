caption: (A) Relative mRNA levels of genes involved in glycerolipid metabolism, starting
  from the cleavage of a triacylglycerol into glycerol and fatty acids. Enzyme Commission
  protein 2.3.1.21 is part of the carnitine shuttle that moves cytoplasmic acyl-CoA
  into the mitochondria. (B) Genes involved in the assimilation of inorganic sulfate.
  In both panels, the samples in the bar graphs are indicated in the key, and continue
  the color scheme and sample orders used in . The y-axis in each bar graph represents
  relative mRNA levels, per-gene normalized to an average of 1.0 for all four samples,
  as indicated in the key. Indicated in the pathway is each metabolite and the Enzyme
  Commission (EC) number for each enzyme.
