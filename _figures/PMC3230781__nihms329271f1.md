caption: 'Developmental pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells detect and
  transduce information on nutrients and pH through the combined action of the cAMP-PKA,
  SNF1/AMPK, TOR, Kss1-MAPK, and Rim101 pathways. The networks on the left (A,C,E)
  depict the effects of the inducing signals on each pathway and the effects of each
  pathway on three developmental phenotypes: pseudohyphal growth (B), complex colony
  morphology (D), and sporulation (F). Arrows indicate enhancing/activating effects;
  bars indicate repressive effects. The dashed lines indicate pathway activity in
  the face of repressive signals.'
