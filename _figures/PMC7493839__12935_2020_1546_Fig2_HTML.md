caption: Schematic overview of the CRISPR-Cas9 complex and its mechanism of action
  in presence of target DNA. a Compartments of CRISPR-Cas9 complex bound to the target
  double-stranded DNA and sgRNA. Watson–Crick base pairing between target DNA and
  sgRNA leads Cas9 to the site of reaction. DNA DSB occurs at three nucleotides upstream
  of PAM motif (brown) by incorporation of HNH and RuvC domains. b Non-homologous
  end joining (NHEJ) repairing pathway and some of its consequences. NHEJ introduces
  indels (insertion/deletion) among target DNA and results in frameshift or loss of
  function inducement. c homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway and some of its after-effects.
  In presence of a donor template, which is flanked by sequences complement to target
  DNA, the reaction directs toward the HDR pathway, leading to precise insertion or
  edition
