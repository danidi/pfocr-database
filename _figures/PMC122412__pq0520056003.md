caption: Two metabolic models used for fitting of 13C multiplet data of Fig. . (A)
  A single pyruvate pool feeds both PDH and PC. Any pyruvate derived from the TCA
  cycle via a catabolic decarboxylation pathway also randomly mixes with [U-13C3]pyruvate
  coming from [U-13C6]glucose. (B) The pyruvate pool involved in cycling with TCA
  cycle intermediates is sequestered in a compartment that does not allow full equilibration
  with [U-13C3]pyruvate coming from [U-13C6]glucose.
