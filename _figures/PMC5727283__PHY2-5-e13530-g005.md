caption: ER stress and the caspase proteolytic system are important regulators of
  muscle protein homeostasis. PA induces unfolded protein responses by activating
  all three arms of the ER stress system. These responses lead to activation of caspase‐3,
  presumably by inducing the intrinsic caspase‐3 pathway, and by increasing the expression
  of genes involved in autophagy. DHA counteracts the effects of PA by reducing ER
  stress, thus antagonizing the increase in UPR mRNAs and proteins and preventing
  caspase‐3 cleavage. Signaling and effector mRNAs/proteins investigated in this study
  are indicated in gray.
