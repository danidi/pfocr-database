caption: 'Schematic diagram of ionizing radiation damage mechanism. The damage of
  ionizing radiation to cell structure mainly has two ways: the direct damage to DNA
  and the indirect damage from accumulated ROS. DNA damage response and repair induced
  by ionizing radiation can lead to cell cycle arrest and activate DNA homologous
  recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair. DNA damage induces
  the phosphorylation of P53, promotes the expression of Bax and other apoptotic proteins,
  promotes the release of Cytochrome C from mitochondria, and activates Caspase from
  the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. P53 can induce the expression of downstream death
  receptors and death ligands, which triggers the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Oxidative
  stress caused by ROS overproduction triggers DNA double-strand breaks that continue
  and exacerbate DNA damage. It also induces mitochondrial dysfunction and intrinsic
  apoptotic cascade reaction. Ionizing radiation increases the secretion of inflammatory
  factors and induces immune responses. Inflammatory factors and oxidative damage
  are involved in regulating cell fate, including autophagy, pyroptosis and senescence.'
