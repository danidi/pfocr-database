caption: Metabolic pathway showing role of different proteins involved in synthesis
  and utilization of sucrose via some proteins with high and low expressions. G6P,
  Glucose 6 phosphate; 6PG, 6 phosphogluconate; F6P, Fructose 6 phosphate; F1,6BP,
  Fructose 1,6 biphosphate; F1P, Fructose 1 phosphate; GA, Glyceraldehyde; DHAP, Dihydroxy
  acetone phosphate; G3P, Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate; G1P, Glucose 1 phosphate; UDP-G,
  UDP-Glucose; SA, Salicylic acid; Red dotted circles show, up regulated proteins
  (in brackets fold values of proteins in 0-Fe conditions compared to control are
  demarked); Blue dotted circles show down regulated proteins (in brackets fold values
  of proteins in 0-Fe conditions compared to control are demarked).
