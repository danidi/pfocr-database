caption: Summary of the known signaling pathways thought to control aspects of entry
  into quiescence. The TOR and PKA pathways are active in the presence of nutrients
  and act to repress aspects of quiescence. When cells are starved of carbon, both
  pathways are downregulated. Inactivation of the TORs causes activation (albeit transiently)
  of PKC, leading to some characteristics of quiescence such as a remodeled cell wall.
  The Snf1 pathway is inhibited by the presence of fermentable carbon sources such
  as glucose. When such sources are depleted, Snf1 is activated and contributes to
  the switch from fermentative to respiratory metabolism that is essential for entry
  into quiescence.
