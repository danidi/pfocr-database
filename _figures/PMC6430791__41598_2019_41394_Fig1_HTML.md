caption: Overview of Cyclin D1 regulation in ADC of uterine cervix. Notch-3 and JAG1
  along with HPV-16 signals activates Notch signaling pathway by binding of Notch-3
  with JAG1. The NICD domain of Notch-3 further translocates to nucleus and along
  with signals of HPV-16 resulted in upregulated transcription and translation of
  Cyclin D1 in the nucleus which regulates cell cycle in ADC of uterine cervix. NICD,
  Notch Intracellular domain.
