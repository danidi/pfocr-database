caption: Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for human immunodeficiency virus type
  1 (HIV-1) recognition and the following pathway for triggering type I interferon
  (IFN-I) expression. Cellular actions are indicated in green (in italic) with arrows,
  and viral replication steps are indicated in red (in italic) with arrows. Cellular
  actions triggered by PRRs [IFN-γ inducible protein 16 (IFI16), cyclic GMP-AMP synthase
  (cGAS) and toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)] are indicated in blue (in italic) with arrows.
  Cellular organelle, viral components, and sensor-related molecules are indicated
  in green, red, and blue, respectively. “P” with yellow circle indicates phosphorylation.
  The detail of each step is described in the main text.
