caption: Cytochrome P450 epoxygenase expression in tumor cell compartments and their
  potential role in cell–cell communication in the tumor stroma. Note that both tumor
  cells and endothelial cell can produce EETs (blue circles), establishing an autocatalytic
  loop. EETs may act in an autocrine or paracrine fashion
