caption: Schematic overview of the multi-scale regulatory model of the heat stress
  response. Heat stress (HS) increases the expression of the transcription factor
  MSN, which in turn regulates genes that code for enzymes of central metabolism that
  are involved in the cell’s protection against protein unfolding (e.g., hexokinase
  and trehalose-6P phosphatase). Additionally, the expression of these MSN-induced
  genes is coordinated by sphingolipids (SL), whose pathway dynamics is directly affected
  by heat. Furthermore, heat stress increases the half-lives of transcripts, as well
  as the activity of Tre-6P phosphatase. The presence of heat-unfolded proteins releases
  the inhibitory effects of Cpr7p on Hsf1p, thus up-regulating the expression of HSF
  and of chaperonins, which in turn promotes the refolding of unfolded proteins. Trehalose
  acts as a protein stabilizer. Dashed arrows depict degradation processes.
