caption: a, Most normal healthy cells outside the brain are not affected by 2DG-ABT
  combination. b, Brain cells have higher glucose-uptake. However, ABT-263 is prevented
  from entering the brain by the blood-brain barrier. c, In cancer cells, deoxyglucose
  (2DG) is carried across the plasma membrane by the active glucose transporter (Glu
  Transp). It activates multiple signal transduction cascades, possibly phosphorylating
  Mcl-1/Bak, resulting in the dissociation of the Bak-Mcl-1 complex. ABT-263/737 (ABT)
  is membrane permeable, crosses the plasma membrane and binds to Bcl-xL, causing
  dissociation of the Bak-Bcl-xL complex, freeing Bak. Bak oligomerizes, creating
  pores on the mitochondrial outer membrane through which cytochrome c is released,
  crossing the point of no return. Cytochrome c triggers assembly of death-executioner
  apoptosomes, causing cell death. The model is a simplified version of the one found
  in (). Note that deoxyglucose also triggers a PI3K-mTOR-AKT pro-survival pathway
  by activating IGFR.
