caption: 'RAS trafficking pathway. Nascent RAS proteins leaving the polysome are rapidly
  modified by farnesyltransferase (FTase), which attaches a C15 farnesyl isoprenoid
  lipid to the cysteine of the CAAX motif. This provides them sufficient affinity
  for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they are further modified by RAS-converting
  CAAX endopeptidase 1 (RCE1)-catalyzed proteolytic removal of the AAX residues, and
  by reversible isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT)-catalyzed carboxylmethylation
  of the now terminal farnesylated cysteine residue. By preventing the first and obligate
  step, FTase inhibitors (FTIs) prevent all three of these modifications. In the presence
  of FTIs, KRAS and NRAS are alternatively prenylated by geranylgeranyltransferase
  I (GGTase I), which attaches a C20 geranylgeranyl isoprenoid that allows the same
  subsequent processing steps. RAS trafficking to the inner leaflet of the plasma
  membrane (PM) requires a second membrane-targeting element that dictates the pathway
  it will take to the PM. NRAS and HRAS have one or two cysteine residues, respectively,
  that undergo reversible acylation by a Golgi-resident protein acyltransferase (PAT)
  to promote their trafficking to the PM. Rapid deacylation by an acyl protein thioesterase
  (APT1/2) frees them up to be re-acylated and trafficked back to the PM. The nonpalmitoylated
  pool of APT in the cytosol is the active form, and is in dynamic equilibrium with
  a palmitoylated pool on the Golgi. KRAS4B, which has no palmitoylatable cysteine
  but a stretch of 6 lysines (polybasic region) does not go to the Golgi but trafficks
  to the more directly to the PM, where it binds by virtue of its electrostatic charge.
  KRAS4A, which has a hybrid motif of a palmitoylated cysteine and a bifurcated polybasic
  region, undergoes an intermediate form of trafficking. Phosphodiesterase-6δ (PDE6δ)
  recognizes the farnesyl isoprenoid and solubilizes nonpalmitoylated RAS proteins
  from any compartment, thereby promoting their availability for restoration to the
  PM; deltarasin blocks this interaction. Not pictured: other chaperone proteins that
  guide the lipidated RAS proteins between and within membrane regions. Each enzyme
  depicted has been a target for drug discovery.'
