caption: Implication of various approaches employed by host-mediated resistance factors
  in defense against geminiviruses. Plants implicate protein kinases (GRIK1 and SnRK1)
  and an autophagy pathway in several stages of the geminivirus infection cycle. Moreover,
  plant nuclear-bound RPT4 and EML1 inhibit viral transcription by preventing the
  binding of RNA polymerase II to viral chromatin. Plant kinases also prevent the
  nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of viral genomes through the sequestering of NIG
  (by WWP) from the cytoplasm to nuclear immune bodies. The NIK-mediated antiviral
  strategy involves the formation of a phosphorylated L10-LIMYB complex resulting
  in global translational suppression and prevention of polysome binding to viral
  transcripts. Membrane-localized BAMs are also employed by plants to assist with
  the cell-to-cell spread of RNA silencing.
