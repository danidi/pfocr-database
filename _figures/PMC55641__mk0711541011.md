caption: Model of a bifurcated arachidonic acid pathway  regulating a transition from
  cell spreading to cell migration. NIH-3T3  cell spreading on fibronectin is by means
  of α5β1-integrin  receptors in the plasma membrane initially binding extracellular
  matrix  fibronectin. The signaling pathway begins with integrin  receptor clustering
  during cell-ECM attachment, which stimulates rapid  cPLA2 activation and an immediate
  transient AA release oxidized by  5-lipoxygenase, generating leukotrienes to signal
  cell spreading.  ERK1/2 is also rapidly activated during the cell attachment phase,
  and  modulates cPLA2 activity to enhance a later sustained AA release, as  well
  as inducing the immediate expression of COX-2 protein.  Up-regulation of COX-2 increases
  total prostaglandin production over  that contributed by constitutive COX-1, to
  stimulate a postspreading  transition to migration.
