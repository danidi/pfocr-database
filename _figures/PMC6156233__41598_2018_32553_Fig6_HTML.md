caption: 'Graphical Abstract. (1) The general eye structure. (2) The main cellular
  types involved in the retinal structure: MC microglial cells; GC ganglion cells;
  BC bipolar cells; RPE retinal pigmented cells; Cones and Rods. (3) The pro-inflammatory
  signaling triggered by both TLR4 or cytokine receptors such as TNFα activates Tak1.
  These proteins recruit three Tab monomers, which phosphorylates and activates Tak1.
  Tak1 is a nodal molecule responsible to activate the inhibitor of kinase kappa (IKκ)
  and consequently the canonical pro-inflammatory pathway orchestrated by NF-κB. On
  the other hand, omega-3 fatty acid from flaxseed oil activates GPR120 receptor in
  the cell membrane. GPR120 recruit beta-arrestin2 protein which detached the protein
  complex formed by Tab and Tak1 inhibiting the pro-inflammatory cascade.'
