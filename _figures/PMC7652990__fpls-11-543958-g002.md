caption: 'The network of pathways involved in respiration, ethylene biosynthesis,
  and signaling, and ROS production and signaling during the ripening process. Pathways
  implicated in the stimulation of AOX expression or activity are indicated by dashed,
  colored lines. (1) Glyoxylic acid (GLA; green): GLA has been shown to directly activate
  AOX in vivo via interaction with the two cysteine residues that gate the protein
  (). In vivo, exogenous GLA application is hypothesized to lead to increased flux
  through the glyoxylate cycle and, consequently, the TCA cycle (). The latter leads
  to increased accumulation of NADH, resulting in increased flux of electrons through
  the cytochrome c (CYTc) pathway and consequent activation of AOX to prevent CYTc
  overreduction (). (2) Hydrogen sulfide (H2S; purple): sulfides accumulate in the
  cytoplasm as a result of exogenous treatment with H2S; these can be converted to
  the amino acid cysteine (). Cysteine, in turn, may directly modulate the activity
  of the AOX protein in response to stress or developmental changes in cellular redox
  state (; ). (3) Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA; pink): exogenous treatment with MeJA leads
  to increased flux through the jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway and accumulation
  of JA. JA has been shown to activate MYC, a transcription factor (TF) that enhances
  the function of ethylene signaling factors, particularly EIN/EIL family TFs, leading
  to an enhanced ethylene response (; ). It has also been hypothesized that JA can
  directly influence AOX gene expression, possibly via a similar mechanism, with MYC
  acting alone or as a complex with other transcription factors to target promoter
  regions of AOX family genes (). In addition to MYC, JA may regulate additional TFs
  like RIN, NOR, and cold-induced TFs that target ripening-associated genes (; ).
  (4) Cold (red): low temperature causes activation of respiratory burst oxidases
  (NADPH oxidases) embedded in the cell membrane, which produce superoxide that is
  then converted to hydrogen peroxide (). Continued stimulation of NADPH oxidases
  leads to accumulation of ROS in the apoplast; these ROS can then be transferred
  into the cytosol via aquaporin channels (). When redox state is disrupted, both
  cytosolic ROS and ROS produced in the mitochondria by the CYTc pathway transmit
  signals to the nucleus to mediate gene expression changes (including activation
  of AOX; ).'
