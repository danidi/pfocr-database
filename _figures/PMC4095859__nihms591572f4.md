caption: Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) activate the p38 MAPK–p16
  pathway, which results in defective self-renewal activity and increased stem cell
  senescence. Therefore, the cellular reduction–oxidation (redox) status is crucial
  to stem cell function and low oxidation levels are required to maintain the quiescent
  state of long-term haematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) and to prevent their exhaustion.
  The ‘ROS rheostat’ has been proposed to function by inhibiting excess ROS, maintaining
  important stem cell characteristics (that is, quiescence and self-renewal potential)
  and preventing stem cell ageing. This rheostat would include an immense cellular
  antioxidant defence system (for example, forkhead box O (FOXO), ataxia telangiectasia
  mutated (ATM)–BH3-interacting domain death agonist (BID) pathway) and a relatively
  inactive PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway, all operating under hypoxic niche conditions. GRP78,
  78 kDa glucose-regulated protein; HIF1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α; KEAP, Kelch-like
  ECH-associated protein 1; LKB1, liver kinase B1; NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid
  2-related factor 2.
