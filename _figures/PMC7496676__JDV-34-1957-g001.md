caption: 'Integrated model of EN pathogenesis based on existing literature. The causal
  drug is thought to mediate a specific TCR‐HLA interaction involving a keratinocyte
  self‐peptide via the (pro)hapten, pharmacological interaction (p‐i) or altered peptide
  loading mechanism. (Memory) CD8 + T cells are activated and exhibit cytotoxicity
  against keratinocytes via the perforin/granzyme B and granulysin pathway and Fas/FasL
  interaction. In parallel, keratinocyte cytotoxicity can be induced by monocyte‐derived
  annexin A1 binding to the keratinocyte formyl peptide receptor 1. The subsequent
  keratinocyte death enhances local inflammation by attraction and activation of other
  immune cells producing pro‐inflammatory cytokines and death receptor ligands (TWEAK,
  TRAIL) and by downregulation of regulatory T cells. Local inflammation stimulates
  FasL expression on keratinocytes and perpetuation of keratinocyte cell death. Widespread
  epidermal necrolysis and inflammation can induce systemic effects. Skin‐specific
  drug metabolism, organ‐specific co‐stimulatory signals and local memory T cells
  from previous infections are thought to contribute to the skin‐specificity of this
  adverse reaction. An alternative to date less validated mechanism by which drugs
  could induce keratinocyte death is via liver dysfunction and retinoid toxicity.
