caption: Schematic overview of the roles of the Notch pathway in CD8+ T cells and
  its application to immunotherapy. (A) The Notch pathway is stimulated during CD8+
  T cell activation and is required for the production of effector molecules, such
  as IFNγ and granzyme B. Therefore, the modulation of the Notch pathway could be
  used to treat various diseases in which CD8+ T cells are involved. In addition,
  studies indicate that the Notch pathway is active in resting naïve and memory T
  cells in which the pathway is reportedly needed for the maintenance of these cells.
  (B) Coculture with Dll1-expressing OP9 stromal cells can generate CD8+ T cells from
  hematopoietic stem cells or iPSCs in vitro. In addition, the coculture system can
  generate memory stem cell-like T cells from activated CD8+ T cells. These in vitro
  generated CD8+ T cells could be superior reagents for antitumor immunity. GVHD,
  graft-versus-host disease; CAR, chimeric antigen receptor; iPSCs, induced pluripotent
  stem cells; HSCs, hematopoietic stem cells.
