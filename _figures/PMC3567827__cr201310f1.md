caption: 'Hh signal transduction in Drosophila and mammalian systems. Hh protein is
  lipid-modified. Drosophila and mammalian HSPGs, Dally, Dally-like (Dlp), GPC3, GPC4
  and GPC6 modulate Hh signaling. In the absence of Hh, Ptc inhibits Smo, allowing
  CiF/GliF to be phosphorylated by multiple kinases and targeted for Slimb/β-TRCP-mediated
  proteolysis to generate CiR/GliR. In Drosophila, the kinesin-like protein Cos2 acts
  as a molecular scaffold to bridge Ci to its kinases. In the presence of Hh, Ptc
  inhibition of Smo is released, which triggers Smo phosphorylation by PKA, CK1 and
  Gprk2/GRK2, leading to its cell surface accumulation and activation. Smo recruits
  Cos2-Fu complex to the cell surface, and dissociates Cos2-Ci-kinase complexes to
  inhibit Ci phosphorylation and processing. In the presence of high levels of Hh,
  Fu converts CiF into CiA by antagonizing Sufu inhibition. CiA is unstable and degraded
  by the HIB-mediated Ub/proteasome pathway. Fu-Cos2 also regulates Smo phosphorylation
  in a feedback loop mechanism. In mammals, Hh induces Smo phosphorylation by CK1
  and GRK2, leading to its ciliary accumulation (not shown here) and activation. Sufu
  is a major whereas Kif7 a minor inhibitor of Gli proteins. The HIB homolog SPOP
  is responsible for degrading Gli proteins in the absence of Sufu. CiF/GliF: full
  length Ci/Gli; CiA/GliA: activator form of Ci/Gli; CiR/GliR: repressor form of Ci/Gli.
