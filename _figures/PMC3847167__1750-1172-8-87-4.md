caption: Lines/LINS plays a putative dual role in WNT canonical pathway. In WNT canonical
  pathway, the absence of a signal leads to the hyperphosphorylation of arm/CTNNB1
  leading to its ubiqitination and degradation by the proteasome in the cytoplasm.
  Binding of wg/WNT1 ligand to a Fz and arr/LRP receptor complex leads to stabilization
  of hypophosphorylated arm/CTNNB1, translocating it to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
  arm/CTNNB1 competes with and displaces gro/TLE interacting with pan/TCF proteins
  to activate transcription. In Drosophila, lines/LINS was found to act as a modulator
  of wg/WNT canonical pathway acting in parallel with or downstream of arm/CTNNB1
  in response to wg/WNT1 signaling to enhance or represses the transcription of target
  genes. Frizzled (Fz), arrow (arr), LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), armallido
  (Arm), β-catenin (CTNNB1), groucho (gro), transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE),
  pangolin (pan), T-cell factor (TCF).
