caption: Proposed model for the signaling pathway by which leptin stimulates fatty
  acid oxidation and PPARα gene expression in C2C12 cells. Long-term stimulation with
  leptin induces a biphasic activation of α2AMPK. Leptin first activates α2AMPK containing
  β2 and γ1 subunits, resulting in the stimulation of fatty acid (FA) oxidation through
  the phosphorylation of ACC and depletion of malonyl-CoA. However, this promotion
  of fatty acid oxidation is transient because α2AMPK containing β2 and γ1 rapidly
  undergoes translocation to the nucleus (within 1 h) as a result of an NLS in the
  α2 subunit. The active α2AMPK in the nucleus then induces the transcription of the
  PPARα gene. Stimulation with leptin for at least 6 h triggers a second wave of α2AMPK
  activation, in part attributable to the induction of transcription of the gene for
  the β1 subunit. Active α2AMPK containing β1 and γ1 is retained in the cytoplasm
  as a result of myristoylation of β1; it phosphorylates ACC, thereby stimulating
  fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria. Active α2AMPK containing β2 and γ1 again translocates
  to the nucleus and increases PPARα gene expression.
