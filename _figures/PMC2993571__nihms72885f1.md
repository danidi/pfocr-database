caption: E2 increases key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway to promote generation
  of pyruvate and its conversion by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to acetyl-CoA to
  initiate and sustain the TCA cycle. Under metabolically challenging conditions (i.e.
  starvation, aging and neurodegeneration) neurons can utilize acetyl-CoA generated
  from ketone body metabolism (ketolysis), produced by the liver or under conditions
  of starvation in neighboring glial cells. This latter pathway is much less efficient
  and can inhibit residual glycolysis. In AD there is a generalized shift towards
  use of an alternative fuel, ketone bodies, and away from glycolytic energy production.
  E2 enhances the glycolytic/pyruvate/acetyl-CoA pathway to generate electrons required
  for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation to sustain utilization of glucose
  as the primary fuel source for the brain.
