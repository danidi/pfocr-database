caption: Figure 2. siRNA-mediated trans chromosomal methylation. The RNA directed
  DNA methylation pathway plays a key role in TCM and TCdM events. RNA Polymerase
  IV (POL IV) transcribes a region which following double stranded RNA synthesis and
  cleavage forms 24 nt siRNAs. Twenty-four nt siRNA are loaded into an ARGONAUTE (AGO)
  and target regions by an RNA transcript produced by RNA Polymerase V (POL V). This
  complex that contains additional components can then recruit DOMAIN REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE
  2 (DRM2), which methylates the DNA. In hybrids, siRNAs derived from the methylated
  parental allele target both the methylated parental allele for continued methylation
  (blue helix) and de novo methylation of the unmethylated parental allele (red helix).
  After the initial TCM event (illustrated here) the previously unmethylated allele
  will produce siRNAs and transcripts produced by POL V enabling the newly methylated
  cytosines to be maintained through subsequent generations.
