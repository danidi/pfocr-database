caption: Loss of E-cadherin, which occurs during cancer progression, leads to an increase
  in miR-10b expression. miR-10b binds to a target sequence in the 3′UTRs of NF1 and
  HOXD10 and represses their expression. The decrease in HOXD10 causes an increase
  in the expression of RhoC, which activates ROCK, while the decrease in NF1 expression
  alleviates the inhibition of ROCK pathway. ROCK activation leads to changes in cytoskeleton
  organization which activates the translation of c-Jun and thereby promotes tumor
  cell invasion and metastasis.
