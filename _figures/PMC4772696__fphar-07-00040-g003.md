caption: Role of EZH2 in genomic signaling through canonical and non-canonical activity.
  EZH2 confers long-term, heritable memory by sustaining silent gene expression states.
  In addition to its role as epigenetic modifier, EZH2 also works as transcriptional
  co-activators through non-canonical signaling pathway.
