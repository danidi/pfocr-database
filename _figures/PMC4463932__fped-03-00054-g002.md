caption: Glycosylation pathway defects with known immunologic consequences. (A) Simplified
  scheme demonstrating N-linked glycosylation and 10 known gene defects resulting
  in altered glycosylation and immunologic disease; dashed arrows indicate presence
  of non-depicted enzymatic steps; question marks depict theoretical blocks for which
  the mechanistic defect remains speculative. N-glycan formation begins in the cytoplasm
  (left) where phosphoglucomutase 3 (PGM3) and phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2) provide
  key sugar substrate and beta-1,4-mannosyltransferase (ALG1) adds the first mannose.
  The core glycan is transferred to the ER lumen where alpha-1,6-mannosyltransferase
  (ALG12) adds an additional mannose and glucose-6-phosphate transporter 1 (SLC37A4)
  and glucose-6-phosphatase-β (G6PC3) potentially affect availability of glucose to
  complete the 14-sugar precursor (Glc3Man9 GlcNac2). Following transfer of the growing
  glycan to a nascent protein, mannosyl-oligosaccharide glucosidase (MOGS) participates
  in glycan remodeling prior to transit of the glycoprotein to the Golgi, a process
  facilitated in part by jagunal homolog1 (JAGN1). In the Golgi CMP-sialic acid transporter
  (SLC35A1) and GDP-fucose transporter 1 (SLC35C1) provide additional sugar substrate
  to complete complex N-glycan formation. (B) Reduced branching N-glycan pattern seen
  in patients with PGM3 deficiency (blue) detected using a fluorescently labeled lectin
  (L-PHA) to quantitate expression on lymphocytes by flow cytometry (green, unstained;
  red, control). (C) Schematic depiction of HIV infection initiation requiring the
  interaction of several glycoproteins (CD4, gp120 trimer, and gp41 trimer). Reduced
  complexity of N-glycans seen in MOGS deficiency, as depicted by the presence of
  high-mannose residues in this figure, results in impaired viral entry, and reduced
  infectivity of newly formed virions in vitro. (D) Depiction of impaired leukocyte
  trafficking due to reduced sialyl-Lewis-X (sLex) binding to E-selectin. SLC35C1
  mutations result in leukocyte adhesion deficiency, type 2 (LAD2), and mutations
  in SLC35A1 result in impaired sLex expression on neutrophils (indicated by red X).
  In LAD2, this results in a leukocyte trafficking defect in patients and impaired
  immunity.
