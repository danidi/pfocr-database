caption: Nutrient deprivation can activate autophagy through mTOR mediated signaling
  mechanisms. There are two mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is activated
  by amino acid deprivation or by AMPK sensing intracellular AMP. Insulin receptor
  activation, on the other hand, suppresses autophagy by activating Akt, which subsequently
  phosphorylates and inhibits the TSC1/2 complex, removing its inhibition of Rheb,
  which can interact with and activate mTORC1, and thereby inhibiting autophagy. Activation
  of autophagy in response to nutrient deprivation inhibits mTORC1 and activates ULK1,
  resulting in the initiation of autophagy via the Vps34, Vps15, Beclin-1 initiation
  complex, which then associates with the phagophore, and extends the double membrane
  structure which is rich in PI3P, a product of the class III PI3K, Vps34. ULK1 can
  also be activated directly by AMP kinase. Microtubule associated protein light chain
  3/LC3 lipidation is a hallmark of autophagy and require a multi-step conjugation
  process. Atg4 cleaves pro-LC3 to LC3-I. Ubiquitin-like step-wise conjugation of
  LC3 with Atg7, Atg3, followed by lipidation by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE); formation
  of Atg5-Atg12-Atg16 and Beclin-1/Vps34/Vps15 complexes are involved in initiation
  and expansion of the phagophore, which is a double membrane structure with LC3-II
  insertion and rich in PI3P, a product of Vps34. Rapamycin has been found to inhibit
  mTORC1 activity and thereby activate autophagy. This autophagy activating property
  of rapamycin has enabled research into effects of autophagy in cell function and
  survival with and without rapamycin. 3-methyladenine, which is a class III PI3K
  inhibitor, has been used as a pharmacological agent, to inhibit autophagy in various
  pathological studies, as a complementary approach to molecular interventions of
  siRNA of Beclin, Vps34, LC3, Atg5 or Atg7. Mouse knockouts of many of these genes
  involved in autophagy have been used in elucidating autophagy signaling and execution
  in vivo.
