caption: a | Arginase 1 (ARG1) produces ornithine from the amino acid arginine as
  part of the urea cycle. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a rate-limiting step in
  polyamine biosynthesis and produces the diamine 1,4-diaminobutane (putrescine).
  Decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) is the aminopropyl donor for spermidine
  synthase (SPDSY) and spermine synthase (SPMSY) for the synthesis of spermidine and
  spermine, respectively. Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase 1 (SSAT) catalyses
  the transfer of the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA to either spermidine or spermine,
  which can then either be excreted from the cell or serve as substrates for polyamine
  oxidase (PAOX). PAOX is a peroxisomal enzyme capable of catalyzing N1-acetylated
  polyamines. 3-Acetylaminopropanal (3-AAP) is a product of oxidation of the acetylated
  polyamines by PAOX. Spermine oxidase (SMOX) is a cytosolic and nuclear amine oxidase
  that directly oxidizes spermine to produce spermidine. 3-Aminopropanal (3-AP) is
  a product of the oxidation of spermine by SMOX. b | S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase
  (AdoMetDC) is the second rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis and produces
  the aminopropyl donor dcAdoMet. Once decarboxylated, dcAdoMet cannot be used in
  methyl-transfer reactions. 5′-Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is the product resulting
  from the loss of the aminopropyl group of dcAdoMet in spermidine and spermine synthesis.
  5′-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) converts MTA into adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate.
  Adenine is converted to AMP by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) using phosphoribosyl
  pyrophosphate (PRPP) as a phosphoribosyl donor and is converted to ATP by successive
  phosphorylation reactions using inorganic phosphate (Pi) as the donor. Methionine
  is salvaged from 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate through a series of enzymatic steps,
  resulting in a substrate that can be combined with ATP to form S-adenosylmethionine
  (AdoMet) by the action of methionine adenosyltransferase 2 (MAT2). Ado, adenosine.
