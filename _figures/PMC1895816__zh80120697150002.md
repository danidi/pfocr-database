caption: Identification of a Bcr-Abl kinase signature. (A) A pathway diagram of the
  16 common proteins from  with cellular localization is shown. The proteins without
  highlighting were found in the Bcr-Abl–containing cells and U937 cells and were
  therefore not considered part of a signature for Bcr-Abl. The 6 signature proteins
  with a previous link to Bcr-Abl were highlighted in green (Abl, Bcr, Cbl, SHIP-2,
  Shc, and VASP). The signature proteins not previously identified in Bcr-Abl signaling
  are highlighted in blue (CD2AP and GRF1). (B) Expression of 2 novel human signature
  proteins in Bcr-Abl–containing (BV173 and K562) and control (EoL-1) cells was confirmed
  by Western blotting using antibodies to total CD2AP and VASP. (C) Phosphorylation
  in Bcr-Abl–containing cells was validated using antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation
  followed by Western blotting using total CD2AP or VASP antibodies. Immunoblotting
  for p-cdc2 (Y15) was used to control for the efficiency of the phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation
  because this site is ubiquitously phosphorylated in cell lines.
