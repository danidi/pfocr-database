caption: The potential origins of lipointoxication in CF. Lipointoxication is defined
  as an imbalance among Saturated Fatty Acids (SFA) and Unsaturated Fatty Acids (UFA)
  within the main membrane constituents, namely Phospholipids (PL). Altered CFTR function
  results in several organ dysfunctions which could account for alterations in the
  repertoire of fatty acids available to the cells (and particularly bronchial epithelial
  cells), with an excess of SFA at the expense of UFA. These processes include Cystic
  Fibrosis-related Liver Disease (CFLD) and pancreatic insufficiency, leading to malabsorption
  of PolyUnsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA), but also hypoxia, which precludes the desaturation
  steps required to form UFA from SFA (). Moreover, mutations in the CFTR genes are
  also associated to an increased flux through the ω−6 pathway, which may account
  for decreased levels of LOE and DHA, and increased activity of Phospholipase A2
  (PLA2), leading to a decrease in the amount of PUFA-containing PL species (). See
  text for details.
