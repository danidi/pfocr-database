caption: Proposed patellazoles biosynthetic pathway. The trans-AT PKS pathway contains
  14 modules, with proposed repeated use (stuttering) of module 3 (PtzA) and use of
  the starting module of PtzF to produce the side chain. Predictions of structures
  accepted by KSs by phylogenetic analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S11) are shown above
  the domains, as are predications for KR stereospecificity (SI Appendix, Fig. S14
  and Table S11). A, adenylation; ACP, acylcarrier protein, also denoted by a filled
  black circle (predicted active) or a filled gray circle (predicted inactive); AT,
  acyltransferase; C, condensation; Cy, condensation/cyclization; DCR, 2,4-dienoyl-CoA-reductase;
  DH, dehydratase; ECH, enoyl-CoA-reductase; ER, enoyl-reductase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase; KR, ketoreductase; KS, ketosynthase; MOX, flavin monooxygenase; MT, C-methyltransferase;
  OMT, O-methyltransferase; OX, thiazoline oxidase; P450, cytochrome P450; TE, thioesterase.
