caption: Proposed model for the signal transduction pathways involved in TGFβ1-mediated
  fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation. In young dermal fibroblasts TGF-β1-dependent
  phenotypic activation uses two distinct but cooperating pathways that involve TGF-β
  receptor (TGF-βR)/Smad2 activation and EGF-mediated EGF-R/ERK1/2 signaling, and
  the latter is compromised with in vitro aging. We propose that induction of HAS2-dependent
  HA is mediated through EGF-R via EGF and subsequent binding of HA to CD44 facilitates
  its association with the EGF-R. This association triggers phosphorylation of the
  p42/p44 MAPKs, ERK1 and ERK2, necessary for promoting cellular differentiation.
  Various aspects of this signaling cascade (underlined and highlighted in italic
  text) are impaired with in vitro aging. This impairment includes decreased expression
  of EGF-R, suppression of TGF-β1-dependent EGF synthesis, and a resultant failure
  of induction of HAS2-dependent HA. We propose that deficient HA-CD44 interaction
  leads to loss of CD44-EGFR colocalization and subsequent downstream ERK signaling.
  Collectively, age-related defects in this pathway confer resistance to cellular
  differentiation, and this may play an important role in age-related impaired wound
  healing.
