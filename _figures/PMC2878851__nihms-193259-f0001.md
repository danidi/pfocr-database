caption: '8 statistically significant inter-signature connections were identified
  relating 6 of the ten signatures [inset] based on genetic overlap (common genes
  between signatures) after adjusting for the varying background of genes of the different
  expression platforms (adjusted p<5%; cumulative hypergeometric distribution). The
  maximum number of inter-signature connections for a single signature was 3. Signatures
  for lung and bone metastasis formed a separate unconnected network. Genetic overlap
  network did not provide inherent mechanistic information. Gene Ontology enrichment
  identified proliferation pathway markers were strongly associated with increased
  histologic grade as well as a worsened prognosis. Panel B. Inherent mechanistic
  and statistical overlap of genetic signature based on “breast cancer context”-constrained
  molecular interaction networks: 16 statistically significant inter-signature connections
  were identified relating 8 of the ten signatures [inset] based on “breast cancer
  context”-driven network genes that mechanistically anchor the signature overlap
  (red shapes). The Bonferroni adjusted pvalue for the number of relationships to
  a single gene-network ≤ 0.05 (for the entire network p<0.01). The maximum number
  of inter-signature connections for a single signature was 5. Noteworthy, the inflammatory
  breast cancer did not significantly interact or overlap with the rest of the network.
  Legend: Red circles indicate genes derived from the expression signatures. Triangles
  represent genes derived from the breast cancer context-driven network. Red hexagons
  are genes common to both expression signatures and the breast cancer context-driven
  network. Squares indicate phenotype of gene signatures. Thin grey edges related
  genes to their respective gene signature (squares, Panels A and B) and indentify
  any protein interactions in Panel A (no statistics), and only significant gene interactions
  in Panel B (adjusted pvalues<5%, Methods, SPAN[,,]). Thick blue edges of insets
  represent “inferred” statistical relationships between genes signatures. Colors
  represent the following: red indicate genes from the breast cancer context-driven
  gene set; black indicates genes significantly associated with more than one gene
  signature (more than one phenotype); the remaining colors indicate separate signatures.
  Thus, a red hexagon indicates a gene found both in a signature as well as in a breast
  cancer mechanism gene. Insets contain graphic representations of statistically significant
  inter-signature connections.'
