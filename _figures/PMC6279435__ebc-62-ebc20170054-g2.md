caption: (A) Structures of cholesterol and cholesterol ester. In cholesterol ester,
  the R group is a fatty acid as shown in (D). (B) Hydrolysis of triglyceride to glycerol
  and fatty acids by a lipase. There are several different lipases (e.g. lipoprotein
  lipase of endothelial cells and hormone-sensitive lipase in adipocytes). (C) Key
  steps in the multistep synthetic pathway of cholesterol. HMG CoA, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA.
  HMG CoA reductase is the rate-limiting step. (D) Fatty acids are carbon chains (most
  commonly 12–22 carbons) with a methyl group at one end and a carboxyl group at the
  other. Saturated fatty acids are ‘filled’ (saturated) with hydrogen and have no
  double bonds. Monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) have one carbon–carbon double
  bond which can occur in different positions. These MUFAs may have a double bond
  with hydrogens in the cis configuration (i.e. hydrogens at either side of the double
  bond are orientated in the same direction) or the trans configuration (i.e. hydrogens
  are orientated in different orientations). The cis configuration introduces a kink
  in the molecular shape of the carbon chain altering physical properties. Polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) have more than one double bond. The letter n or Greek symbol
  ω, is used to indicate the position of the bond closest to the methyl end. For example,
  n−6 PUFAs are characterised by the presence of at least two double bonds with the
  first between the sixth and seventh carbon from the methyl end.
