caption: 'Pathways to the generation of cytosolic and mitochondrial citrate and its
  utilization. Glucose-derived citrate is obtained through the conversion of glucose
  to glucose-6-phosphate, which, with a series of enzymatic reactions, is then converted
  to pyruvate. Pyruvate is reduced to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or,
  alternatively, transported into mitochondria to produce Acetyl-Coenzyme A (Ac-CoA)
  via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Citrate synthase then catalyzes the condensation
  of acetyl-CoA with oxaloacetate to yield citrate that is exported in the cytosol
  by CIC. Lactate can also enter the mitochondria and be converted to pyruvate by
  a mitochondrial lactate dehydrogenase (mtLDH) regenerating citrate. Mitochondrial
  citrate and, to a lesser extent, lactate fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  and the electron transport chain (ETC). Citrate can also be uptaken from the extracellular
  space and transported to the cytosol via SLC13A5. In the cytosol, citrate provides
  Ac-CoA via ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) for protein acetylation and can enter the mevalonate
  pathway for cholesterol biosynthesis mediated by hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase
  (HMGCS) and hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) and the fatty acid synthetic
  pathway via acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). Cytosolic
  Ac-CoA can be also generated by acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) which converts acetate
  derived from deacetylation reactions to acetyl-CoA. Cytosolic citrate inhibits phosphofructokinase
  1 (PFK1) and pyruvate kinase (PK), thus playing an active role in controlling glycolytic
  flux. An alternative source of mitochondrial or cytosolic citrate is supplied by
  reductive carboxylation of alpha-ketoglutarate to isocitrate, mediated in the cytosol
  by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and in the mitochondria by IDH2. Additional
