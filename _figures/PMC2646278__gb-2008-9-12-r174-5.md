caption: Pathways of global genome nuclear excision repair (GG-NER) and transcription-coupled
  nuclear excision repair (TC-NER). Cancer genes involved in the two subpathways as
  documented in 'cancer gene census' are marked by red stars. In GG-NER, damage, such
  as ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) or 6-4 photoproducts
  (6-4 PP), is recognized by proteins, including the XPE (DDB2) and XPC gene products.
  In TC-NER, the lesion appears to block the progress of RNA polymerase II in a process
  involving the CSA and CSB gene products. Following initial damage recognition, the
  two subpathways converge. The XPB (ERCC3) and XPD (ERCC2) helicases unwind the region
  surrounding the lesion, along with the XPA and XPG (ERCC5) gene products and replication
  protein A (RPA). (The graph was obtained from the KEGG Pathway database [], and
  only part of it is shown here.)
