caption: 'Cigarette smoke-mediated oxidative stress activates the NF-κB pathway leading
  to acetylation of chromatin on pro-inflammatory genes thus increasing the accessibility
  of transcription factors leading to increased pro-inflammatory gene expression.
  Deacetylation results in DNA rewinding around histone proteins, decreasing gene
  transcription. CBP/p300 function as intrinsic histone acetyltransferases (HATs).
  Activated corticosteroid receptors recruit HDAC2 into the transcriptome complex
  promoting histone deacetylation, chromatin condensation and expulsion of DNA polymerases,
  shutting off gene expression. Cigarette smoke/oxidants inhibit HDAC2 activity (by
  post-translational modifications) as well as activating NF-κB, facilitating histone
  acetylation by the transcriptome complex even in the presence of activated glucocorticoid
  receptor. Theophylline, a methyl xanthine, inhibits pro-inflammatory gene expression
  via restoring transrepressive pathways through the activation of HDAC2. GC: Glucocorticoid;
  Ac: Acetylation; 4-HNE: 4-hydroxy-2-nonenol; NO2: Nitric oxide; P: Phosphate; CBP:
  CREB (cAMP response element binding protein)-binding protein.'
