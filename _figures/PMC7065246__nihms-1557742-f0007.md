caption: General acid catalyzed transition states for 1,2 shift on C2 hydroxyl carbocation
  and C3 hydroxyl carbocation on a paraherquamide model system. Various indole substituents
  are modeled (red, blue, green) as compared to a model without general acid (black).
  Energies are given in kcal/mol and distances in Å.
