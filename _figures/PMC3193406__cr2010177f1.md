caption: Canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways. Canonical pathway is
  triggered by numerous signals, including those mediated by innate and adaptive immune
  receptors. It involves activation of IKK complex by Tak1, IKK-mediated IκBα phosphorylation,
  and subsequent degradation, resulting in rapid and transient nuclear translocation
  of the prototypical NF-κB heterodimer RelA/p50. Non-canonical NF-κB pathway relies
  on phosphorylation-induced p100 processing, which is triggered by signaling from
  a subset of TNFR members. This pathway is dependent on NIK and IKKα, but not on
  the trimeric IKK complex, and mediates the persistent activation of RelB/p52 complex.
