caption: Significantly modulated KEGG pathways in BS + ET group versus PC group comparison.
  (A) Expression patterns of the DEGs of MAPK signaling pathway. (B) Expression patterns
  of the DEGs of toll-like receptor signaling pathway. (C) Expression patterns of
  the DEGs of NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. (D) Expression patterns of the
  DEGs of cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction. Highlighted genes with red color
  represent up-regulated expression patterns and highlighted genes with green color
  represent down-regulated expression patterns.
