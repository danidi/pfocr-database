caption: 1α,25(OH)2D3 attenuates Il-6 and IL-1β-mediated inflammatory responses in
  MacCM-stimulated human white preadipocytes. Accumulated macrophages infiltrating
  into white adipose tissue induce metaflammation, which is embodied by inflammatory
  responses including increased local gene expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory
  factors, particularly IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and RANTES. Among these pro-inflammatory
  factors, by binding to its receptor, IL-1β initiates and sustains the inflammatory
  responses in macrophage-stimulated preadipocytes by enhancing the phosphorylation
  of relA of the NF-κB signaling pathway, while in the same ligand-receptor manner
  IL-6 mediates similar responses by enhancing the phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK.
  Besides directly inhibiting the pro-inflammatory gene expression (not tested in
  our study), 1α,25(OH)2D3 attenuates IL-1β-mediated inflammatory responses by decreasing
  the phosphorylation of relA in the nucleus. Moreover, 1α,25(OH)2D3 can exert a non-genomic
  action by decreasing the phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK in the cytoplasm, to attenuate
  IL-6-mediated inflammatory responses
