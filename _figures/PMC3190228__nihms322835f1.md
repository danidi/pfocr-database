caption: 'In normal state (left), the direct pathway facilitates movement by decreasing
  the tonic inhibition of basal ganglia outputs to the thalamus, while the indirect
  pathway suppresses movements by increasing the inhibitory pathway. Dopamine (DA)
  release in the dorsal striatum from the substantia nigra pars compacta induces an
  excitation in the direct pathway via activation of dopaminergic D1 receptors and
  an inhibition in the indirect pathway via D2 receptors, thereby facilitating movement.
  In Parkinson’s disease (right), degeneration of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia
  nigra pars reticulata induces hyperactivity in indirect pathway and reduces activity
  in the direct pathway. This imbalance results in inhibition of voluntary movement,
  likely by enhancing synchronous activity in downstream targets; abnormal activity
  of STN and GPi emerge, resulting in a high inhibition of thalamic activity. Adapted
  from ()Blue arrows: inhibitory projections; red arrows: excitatory projections;
  Grey arrows correspond to degeneration of dopaminergic output from the SNc.'
