caption: Hypothetical pathway of JH signaling in wood roaches and termites. A common
  pathway involved in 20E synthesis may control a downstream molting process via the
  JH receptor. In termites, soldier-specific morphogenesis may be regulated by a specific
  JH receptor pathway, probably involved in the 20E signaling genes including HR39.
