caption: On the upper left side of the figure is the simplified scheme of the de novo
  NAD synthetic pathway. On the left-lower part of the figure is the savage pathway
  and the interconversion of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside
  (NR). On the center and lower part of the figure are the mechanisms of degradation
  of NAD including CD38, PARPs, and SIRTUINs. On the upper right are the phosphorylation
  of NAD to NADP and the conversion of NADP to NAADP. Also on the upper right are
  the oxireduction reactions of NAD-NADH and NADP-NADH. On the lower portion of the
  figure is the metabolism of nicotinamide (NAM) via salvage pathway and (lower-right)
  via methylation. All of the abbreviations for metabolites and enzymes are found
  on the text.
