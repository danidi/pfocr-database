caption: Molecular mechanisms behind HIF regulation and responses in cells. The cellular
  oxygen sensing response is tightly regulated by a family of prolyl hydroxylases
  (PHD) which under normal oxygen conditions (normoxia; blue arrows) are responsible
  for hydroxylating proline residues on hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) alpha subunits.
  These hydroxylated residues are recognized by a pVHL-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex,
  whereby HIFalpha subunits are marked for polyubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal
  degradation. When oxygen levels are low (hypoxia; red arrow) PHDs cannot hydroxylate
  HIFalphas thereby allowing them to escape pVHL-mediated degradation. HIFalpha subunits
  accumulate and bind to their heterodimeric partner, HIFbeta, translocate into the
  nucleus and activate a cascade of hypoxic signaling first by the transcription of
  various target genes including microRNAs that are important for tumor promoting
  pathways. Alternatively, c-Src is also capable of activating HIFs by indirectly
  inhibiting PHD activity via the NADPH oxidase/Rac pathway. mTOR can also promote
  stabilization and HIF transcriptional activity. Critical points for therapeutic
  intervention include the use of c-Src and mTOR inhibitors to prevent HIFalpha accumulation
  and activation.

  description: Molecular mechanisms behind HIF regulation and responses in cells.
    The cellular oxygen sensing response is tightly regulated by a family of prolyl
    hydroxylases (PHD) which under normal oxygen conditions (normoxia; blue arrows)
    are responsible for hydroxylating proline residues on hypoxia inducible factor
    (HIF) alpha subunits. These hydroxylated residues are recognized by a pVHL-E3

    HIFbeta, translocate into the nucleus and activate a cascade of hypoxic signaling
    first by the transcription of various target genes including microRNAs that are
    important for tumor promoting pathways. Alternatively, c-Src is also capable of
    activating HIFs by indirectly inhibiting PHD activity via the NADPH oxidase/Rac
    pathway. mTOR can also promote stabilization and HIF transcriptional activity.
    Critical points for therapeutic intervention include the use of c-Src and mTOR
