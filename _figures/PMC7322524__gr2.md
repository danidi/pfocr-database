caption: Cell death pathways triggered by RNA sensors. (A) The RLRs RIG-I and MDA5
  recognize 5′ di- or triphosphorylated short stretches of base-paired RNA and long
  complex dsRNA, respectively. Stimulation of RIG-I and MDA5 exposes their CARDs,
  which interact with the CARD of MAVS. MAVS forms a multimeric complex localized
  at the mitochondria, from where two distinct signaling pathways diverge. One complex
  contains the kinase TBK1, which phosphorylates and activates the IRF3 transcription
  factor, which in turn controls expression type I IFN. MAVS also stimulates the activation
  of the proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB. A second complex forms with TRAF2,
  TRAF6, and LUBAC and activates the RLR-induced IRF3 mediated pathway of apoptosis
  (RIPA). LUBAC adds linear ubiquitin chains onto IRF3, which activates the proapoptotic
  protein Bax. This leads to leakage of cytochrome c out of the mitochondria. Cytochrome
  c binds to and activates the proapoptotic protein Apaf-1, which induces the cleavage
  of the proenzyme of caspase-9 into the active form. (B) ZBP1 contains two N-terminal
  Z-nucleic acid binding domains (Zα1 and Zα2) through which it binds to Z-form dsRNA
  (Z-RNA). On activation, ZBP1 interacts with RIPK3 via homotypic RHIM interactions.
  ZBP1 contains two tandem RHIMs (RHIM-A and RHIM-B), of which only RHIM-A is required
  for this interaction. RIPK3 then phosphorylates MLKL, which on oligomerization triggers
  necroptosis by inducing permeabilization of the cell membrane. In cells infected
  with IAV, RIPK3 also associates with RIPK1. RIPK1 contains a death domain (DD) through
  which it recruits FADD. FADD associates with caspase-8 through death-effector domain
  (DED) interactions leading to caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. In macrophages,
  ZBP1-mediated necroptosis or apoptosis triggers the formation of a caspase-1 inflammasome
  leading to maturation of IL-1β. ZBP1 can also induce NF-κB activation and this requires
  RIPK1 or RIPK3. The RHIM of RIPK1 prevents ZBP1-mediated necroptosis during development
  and in keratinocytes. The mechanism through which RIPK1 prevents such “spontaneous”
  ZBP1 activation is unknown. (C) TLR3 is expressed on the cell surface (not shown)
  and in endosomes. The ligand-binding domain of TLR3 faces the endosomal lumen and
  binds to dsRNA. TLR3 signals via TRIF that contains a RHIM, allowing recruitment
  of RIPK1 and RIPK3. Interactions with RIPK1 stimulate NF-κB activation and proinflammatory
  gene expression. TRIF also signals via TBK1 and IRF3 promoting type I IFN gene expression.
  RIPK1 can also associate with FADD and caspase-8 to induce apoptosis. Active caspase-8
  can directly cleave pro-IL1β into its biologically active form in TLR3-stimulated
  macrophages. When caspase-8 activation is compromised, RIPK3 is recruited to TRIF
  and induces necroptosis by activating MLKL, independently of RIPK1.
