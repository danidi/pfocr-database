caption: Myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated calreticulin (CALR) mutants
  bind to TPO-R and activate JAK2 signaling in the absence of thrombopoietin (TPO)
  ligand. CALR mutants that result from one base pair shifts in the reading frame
  in exon 9 have a novel positively charged tail (*). These CALR mutants bind to the
  N-glycosylated extracellular domain of TPO-R, and such complexes in the secretory
  pathway and at the cell surface activate JAK2. This results in persistent activation
  of STAT5 (as shown here) and also STAT1, STAT3, mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK)/ERK and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. Wild-type CALR
  (left), on the other hand, is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, due to the
  presence of its KDEL sequence (lacking in MPN-associated mutant CALR) and does not
  activate TPO-R.
