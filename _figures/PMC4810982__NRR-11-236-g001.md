caption: 'A proposed scheme for the protective effects of linagliptin against Aβ-induced
  neuronal insulin signaling blockade.GLP-1 is synthesized and secreted by neuronal
  cells. Thus, stimulation of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and subsequently activate downstream
  AMPK/Sirt1 pathway which protects mitochondrial function and suppresses intra-cellular
  ROS accumulation. However, the DPP-4 enzyme rapidly inactivates GLP-1, resulting
  in downregulation of GLP-1 downstream effects. On the contrary, therapeutic candidates
  against DPP-4 like linagliptin may display neuroprotective effects by rescuing suppressed
  GLP-1 signaling, which can work against neuronal insulin signaling blockade thereby
  attenuating Aβ-induced neuronal cell death. Aβ: Amyloid β; AMPK: 5′ AMP-activated
  protein kinase; DPP-4: dipeptidyl peptidase 4; GLP-1: glucagon-like peptide 1; GSK3β:
  glycogen synthase kinase-3β; IR: insulin receptor; ROS: reactive oxygen species;
  Ser9: phospho-GSK-3β; Sirt1: sirtuin 1; Tyr216: p-GSK-3β/β antibody.'
