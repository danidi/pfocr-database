caption: The maroon network describes the translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane
  and its subsequent dissociation from the membrane. The module denoted in black represents
  the homologous desensitization pathway. The blue network defines the PKA mediated
  desensitization of PKC Apl II. The red network illustrates the AD pathway responsible
  for the rescuing PKC from desensitization. Finally the D pathway, which is antagonistic
  to the AD pathway and causes the increase in desensitization, is specified by the
  green network. In green are the additional roles of AD needed to counteract D during
  massed training.
