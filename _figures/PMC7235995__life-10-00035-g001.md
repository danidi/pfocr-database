caption: 'Acetyleno/carboxydotrophic reaction network. NiS-catalyzed reaction network
  starting from acetylene and carbon monoxide. Observed products are shown with their
  chemical formula and names; red dots indicate the observed 13C label from 13CO.
  Colored semi cycles signify the corresponding parts of the indicated carbon fixation
  pathways. (rAcCoA: reductive acetyl-CoA pathway; 3-HP/4-HB cycle: 3-hydroxpropinate/4-hydroxybutyrate
  cycle; rTCA: reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle; DC/4-HB cycle: dicarboxylate/4-hydroxbutyrate
  cycle; and 3-HP bicycle: 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle. Dotted arrows show observed
  interconversions between products of the co-radiating, linear pathways.'
