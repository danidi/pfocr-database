caption: Both nutrient availability and metabolic network configuration affect how
  cells use metabolism to produce ATP, generate macromolecules, and regulate redox
  state. Key reactions in central carbon metabolism are shown, including how the TCA
  cycle and the electron transport chain are involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis.
  Some of the reactions catalyzed by enzymes and metabolites discussed in this review
  are also shown for reference. PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PDHK, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase;
  IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; FH, fumarate hydratase;
  GLS, glutaminase; DHODH, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; Ox PPP, oxidative pentose
  phosphate pathway; Non-Ox PPP, non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway; αKG, α-ketoglutarate;
  OAA, oxaloacetate; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
