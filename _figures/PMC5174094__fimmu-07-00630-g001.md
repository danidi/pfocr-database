caption: Energy and biosynthetic metabolism. Glucose is taken up and metabolized in
  the cytoplasm to pyruvate in a process called glycolysis. Pyruvate is then transported
  into the mitochondria and oxidized into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which enters
  the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The molecules NADH and FADH2 produced until
  this point are the inputs for the electron transport chain. Another important energy
  source are fatty acids, whose oxidation delivers acetyl-coA. Aerobic glycolysis
  takes place in proliferating (and cancer) cells and describes the phenomenon of
  increased glucose uptake and glycolysis with the subsequent production of lactate.
  Glutamine is another carbon source that can be transformed to αKG and, therefore,
  enters the TCA cycle. Glutamine can also be used as nitrogen donor in the hexosamine
  pathway, which requires F6P and is important for N-glycosylation of proteins. G6P
  can feed into the pentose phosphate pathway, which is important for the production
  of nucleotides and NADPH. Mitochondrial citrate can enter the cytoplasm and feeds
  into de novo fatty acid synthesis. For further details consult the text.
