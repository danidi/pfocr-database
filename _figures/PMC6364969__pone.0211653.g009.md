caption: (1) BsEndoV incises the second phospodiester bond downstream from a deaminated
  base or an AP site. Post-incision events are dependent on the type of damage. (2)
  BsEndoV performs a second incision at the 5' side of the lesion when the deaminated
  bases are Hx or X, directly allowing DNA extension by BsPolA. (3) Processing of
  U or an AP site initiated by BsEndoV requires the subsequent activity of BsExoA
  before a BsPolA-dependent DNA synthesis step. In both cases, a DNA ligase would
  be necessary to complete the AER events.
