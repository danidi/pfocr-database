caption: The vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSN), which detect semiochemicals, are sequestered
  in the VNO, requiring chemical fluids to be drawn into the vomeronasal lumen via
  the anterior opening and entrance duct. SCCs reside densely at the entrance duct
  and detect odorous irritants and harmful substances in the stimulus fluids. Signal
  transduction in SCCs primarily involves the PLC signaling pathway, in which activation
  of PLC results in either an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels via the internal
  Ca2+ stores, leading to activation of TRPM5 or activation of unknown effectors.
  PLC-independent pathway may also be involved in chemical responses. For sensory
  transduction of bitter compounds, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ opens TRPM5
  ion channels. Activation of SCCs leads to release of ACh, a potential transmitter
  onto the trigeminal nerve fibers and consequently regulating the access of chemical
  fluids.
