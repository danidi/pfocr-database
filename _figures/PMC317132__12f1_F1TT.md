caption: Model of somatic sex determination in C. elegans. (A) Genetic pathway regulating
  somatic sex determination. Barred lines indicate negative interactions, and arrows
  indicate positive interactions. The X/A ratio controls X chromosome dosage compensation
  and sex determination via xol-1 and the sdc genes. The regulatory pathway branches
  at the level of the sdc genes, and only the branch that controls somatic sex determination
  is shown. In XX animals, tra-2 negatively regulates the fem genes, allowing tra-1
  to promote female development. In XO animals, elevated her-1 activity inhibits tra-2
  and permits the fem genes to bring about male development by negatively regulating
  tra-1. (B) Molecular model of somatic sex determination. (Left) A high X/A ratio
  prevents HER-1 synthesis, allowing TRA-2A to inhibit the FEM proteins by binding
  FEM-3. TRA-1A is thus free direct female somatic development. (Right) A low X/A
  ratio results in the synthesis of HER-1, a small, secreted protein that inactivates
  the membrane protein TRA-2A, thereby releasing the FEM proteins from negative regulation.
  The FEM proteins then inhibit the activity of TRA-1A to cause male development.
  TRA-3 is shown as activating TRA-2A. See text for possible mechanism. Whether it
  is subject to sex-specific regulation is not known.
