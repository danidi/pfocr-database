caption: Predicted network linking pancreatic cancer miRNA markers, known pancreatic
  cancer genetic lesions, and DAMPs. miR-21, miR-155, and miR-200 family members are
  connected to known genetic lesions found in pancreatic cancers including mutant
  K-ras, BRCA1, TGF[beta], and DAMPs (HMGB1) and DAMP-receptors (RAGE) as well as
  the p53 pathway. Note that the role played by c-myc in apoptosis regulation is paradoxical;
  under some conditions, c-myc promotes proliferation, and under other condition c-myc
  promotes apoptosis.221 c-myc is crucial for apoptosis and requires p53 to activate
  apoptosis.
