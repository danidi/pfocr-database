caption: Figure 6. The metabolic network which regulates the cell cycle activation
  at the O2-dependent G1/S transition. The core of the network is the cellular redox-state
  expressed by the cytosolic NADP/NADPH ratio. This ratio (A) regulates the transfer
  of reducing equivalents (H) from the methylentetrahydrofolate (CH2-FH4) to methenyltrahydrofolate
  (CH-FH4), a crucial NADP-dependent reaction generating NADPH. This is a limiting
  step of the synthesis of purine ring (B), required for the amplification of purine
  pools indispensable for the G1–S transition. A fundamental role in the regulation
  of the NADP/NADPH ratio is played by folate, whose reduction to FH4 by the dehydrofolic
  reductase (DHFR) generates NADP (A). The addition of an excess of the reaction product,
  FH4, can impair the DHFR activity, leading to an increment of NADPH, with the consequent
  reductive shift of the NADP/NADPH ratio and the inhibition of the G1/S transition.
  Consistently, FH4 mimics the effects of MTX, a powerful inhibitor of DHFR (A), incrementing
  the NADPH levels and inhibiting cell recruitment into S. Whatever the mechanism
  incrementing the cytosolic NADPH, including an excess of glutamine through the glutaminolytic
  pathway (A), has an inhibitory effect, unless it is removed by the shuttle mechanisms,
  which discharge the cytosolic reducing equivalents onto the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain. This role of the shuttles accounts for the fact that the activity of the
  chain is crucial for the G1/S transition, which is impaired by a specific inhibitor
  like antimycin A (C). A similar inhibition can be performed whenever the chain,
  although not inhibited, it is saturated by reducing equivalents produced by oxidizable
  substrates of the Krebs cycle, mostly pyruvate.
