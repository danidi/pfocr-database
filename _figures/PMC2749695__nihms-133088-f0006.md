caption: Reproduced with permission from []. Activation of GCC by its ligands coordinates
  a complex system of intracellular signaling composed of dynamically regulated proteins
  that control discreet biological processes maintaining intestinal epithelial cell
  and crypt-villus homeostasis, the corruption of which contributes to the initiation
  and promotion of cancer. GCC, through cGMP, activates cGMP (PKG)- and cAMP (PKA)-dependent
  protein kinases; phosphodiesterases (PDE), which control cGMP concentration, spatially
  and temporally shaping GCC signaling; and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGs),
  which regulate calcium signaling through calcium-sensing receptors (CaRs). PKG is
  the canonical intracellular effector for guanylyl cyclases, and in intestinal cells
  induces phosphorylation of (1) the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
  (CFTR), mediating fluid secretion; (2) vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP),
  constraining actin polymerization dynamics, migration, and adhesion; and (3) β-catenin,
  resulting in its proteosomal degradation, restricting proliferation and promoting
  terminal differentiation. In turn, CNGs and CaRs form the extracellular calcium-dependent
  limb of the GCC signalome, cooperatively promoting differentiation and restricting
  proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells. GCC also inhibits the secretion of
  matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), key
  regulators of epithelial and mesenchymal remodeling and enterocyte survival and
  maturation. Specifically, TGF-β promotes tumor cell survival and proliferation through
  an oncogenic switch, recruiting stress-activated protein kinase p38 and phosphorylated
  c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (pJNK). Further, GCC and cGMP control genomic integrity
  and cellular metabolism, in part, by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ, coactivator 1α (PGC1α), either directly or by inhibiting the Akt pathway.
  Akt regulates cell survival, cell cycle progression, glycolysis, the number and
  function of mitochondria, and the DNA damage response pathway by targeting intracellular
  effector proteins, including the forkhead (FOXO) family of transcription factors,
  glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and tuberous
  sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt-dependent
  functional complexes regulating proliferation and cell survival include (1) Myc,
  cyclin D1, and phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB), which promote G1-S cell
  cycle transition; (2) p27kip1 and retinoblastoma-like 2 (RBL2), which induce cell
  cycle arrest; (3) Fas-ligand (FasL) and BCL2-like 11 (Bim), mediators of cell death;
  (4) BCL2-antagonist of cell death (BAD), which inhibits the B-cell lymphoma-like
  protein 1 (BCL-XL) and induces apoptosis; and (5) the mouse double-minute 2 (MDM2),
  which prevents cell arrest and apoptosis by promoting proteasome-dependent p53 degradation.
  The hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) promotes glycolysis and inhibits respiration;
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce genomic instability and HIF stability and function;
  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) are
  key enzymes mediating gluconeogenesis; glycogen synthase promotes HIF degradation
  and glycogen synthesis; and Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) is a small G protein
  inhibited by the TSC1/TSC2 complex that promotes mTOR-mediated functions, including
  proliferation and metabolism. Lines and arrows, indicating functional relations
  between molecules, are a schematic representation of key interactions mediating
  biological processes in intestinal epithelial cells, and they do not exhaustively
  portray the complexity of signaling interconnections mediated by each molecule of
  the GCC signalome.
