caption: Intracellular signaling pathways arising from β common (βc) receptor activation.
  Schematic of key protein interactions following activation of the βc cytokine receptor
  family. Low concentrations of cytokine promote the activation of phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K) and subsequent phosphorylation of βc on Ser585 (yellow circle) resulting
  in the recruitment of 14-3-3 and promoting cell survival. High concentrations of
  cytokine result in Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2 transphosphorylation and subsequent
  phosphorylation of βc at eight intracellular tyrosine residues (yellow circles),
  activating signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling.
  Cytokine binding activates the tyrosine kinase, Lyn, which interacts with either
  βc or the α subunit. Phosphorylation of βc on Tyr577 is mutually exclusive with
  Ser585 phosphorylation and leads to the recruitment of Shc and the loss of 14-3-3
  binding, while promoting cell survival and proliferation. SHP2 has been shown to
  interact with Tyr612 to promote activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) signaling pathway.
