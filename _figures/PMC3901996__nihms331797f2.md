caption: Transmembrane signaling of IL-6, which is a major growth factor for MM. Binding
  of IL-6 to the α chain (gp80) of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) causes the formation
  of multimeric complexes composed of 2 IL-6R α chains, 2 β chains (IL-6Rβ or gp130),
  and 2 IL-6 molecules. Subsequently, tyrosine kinases (JAKs and Src kinases, in particular
  Hck) which are bound constitutively to the IL-6Rβ, become activated and (trans)phosphorylate
  the receptor. This creates specific docking sites for several signaling proteins
  including STAT1, STAT3, and Shc (?) on the IL-6Rβ, allowing further phosphorylation
  of these proteins by receptor-associated kinases. Activation of Shc recruits Grb2/Sos1
  to the cell membrane. Sos1, a Ras-GDP/GTP exchange factor activates Ras; this activates
  a signaling cascade of several serine/threonine kinases including Raf-1, MKK, MAPK.
  Finally, MAPK phosphorylates substrates like c-Myc, c-Jun, c-Fos, RSK, and these
  events eventually enhance MM proliferation or prevent apoptosis. Upon phosphorylation,
  STAT1 and STAT3 form homodimers and heterodimers that are translocated to the nucleus
  and act as transcription factors for IL-6–induced promoters. Although the Ras-MAPK
  signaling cascade is believed to promote MM growth, no such function has yet been
  reported for the JAK-STAT pathway, believed to trigger rather metabolic events.
