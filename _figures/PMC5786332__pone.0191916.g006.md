caption: Data sets were analyzed through the use of QIAGEN's Ingenuity速 Pathway Analysis
  (IPA速, QIAGEN Redwood City, CA, USA www.qiagen.com/ingenuity). Network analysis
  included direct and indirect relationships with disease functions and selected genes
  differentially expressed between MDMs infected with HIV-1 pre-treated with estrogen
  or progesterone and MDMs infected with HIV-1 not treated with estrogen or progesterone
  samples.
