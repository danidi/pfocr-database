caption: 'DDVP profoundly affects energy metabolism. The diagram illustrates the predicted
  effects of DDVP on carbohydrate metabolic processes. The effects of DDVP on glucokinase
  and the glucose transporter (shown in blue) are derived from the literature (see
  text). Clusters of small arrows adjacent to gene symbols (small caps) denote the
  direction of differential expression in exposed fish (red, down-regulation; green,
  up-regulation). Large arrows indicate the direction of biochemical processes or
  reactions. Green indicates a predicted increase, and red indicates a predicted decrease
  in the process. Gray arrows indicate no predicted change or an inability to predict
  a change. Proteins are shown in blue. Biological processes are labeled with large,
  pale gray capital letters. PPP: pentose phosphate pathway. βOX: βoxidation. FAS:
  fatty acid synthesis. GLU: gluconeogenesis. GLY: glycogenolysis/glycogen synthesis.
  Orange asterisks indicate points at which amino acids can enter carbohydrate metabolism
  by transamination. GSSG: oxidized glutathione. GSH: reduced glutathione. We excluded
  fbp1b from the metabolic map because its expression behavior appears to be confounded
  by high background transcription (data not shown)'
