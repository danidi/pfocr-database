caption: Proposed model for the dual role of the endocannabinoid-mediated pathway
  in regulation of peripheral metabolic and central appetitive processes in liver
  and hypothalamus. In liver (left), a high-fat diet leads to increased CB1 levels
  as well as increased levels of anandamide, the latter of which result from decreased
  activity of FAAH, the primary enzyme responsible for this endocannabinoid’s catabolism.
  CB1 stimulation increases expression of the transcription factor SREBP-1c and its
  associated enzymes, ACC1 and FAS. Stimulation of this pathway leads to a functional
  increase in the rate of de novo fatty acid synthesis in liver and the increased
  occurrence of fatty liver and obesity. Through either direct or indirect mechanisms,
  this pathway also regulates plasma levels of hormones associated with metabolism
  and feeding, including insulin, leptin, and adiponectin. These altered levels of
  hormones may negatively affect feeding behavior and metabolism. For example, exogenous
  administration of leptin leads to decreased levels of anandamide and 2-AG in the
  hypothalamus and consequently inhibits feeding behavior. Conversely, stimulation
  of CB1 in the hypothalamus (right) activates SREBP-1c and FAS, which leads to a
  hyperphagic response to a high-carbohydrate meal following a fast. Disruption of
  CB1signaling through the use of CB1_/_ mice or SR141716 (Rimonabant) administration
  blocks both pathways, leading to a net effect of decreased fatty acid production
  and prevention of hyperphagia.
