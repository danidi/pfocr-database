caption: The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways to apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway
  of apoptosis is activated when certain death receptor ligands of the tumour necrosis
  factor (TNF) family (such as TNF) engage their cognate death receptors on the plasma
  membrane, leading to caspase-8 activation via the death-inducing signalling complex
  (DISC), which results in apoptosis. The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is activated
  by cellular stresses (such as DNA damage, growth factor deprivation or oxidative
  stress) and is regulated by BCL-2 family proteins. BH3 proteins bind to and activate
  pro-apoptotic proteins BAX, BAK and possibly BOK, which oligomerize in the mitochondrial
  membranes and release cytochrome c, then interact with apoptosis protease-activating
  factor 1(APAF1) and initiate caspase activation that results in apoptosis. Futhermore,
  BH3-only activator proteins (BID, BIM, Puma and NOXA) directly bind to interact
  with BAX and BAK to promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).
  While the BH3-only sensitizer proteins (BAD, BIK, HRK, BMF, PUMA, NOXA) bind to
  anti-apoptotic proteins with higher affinity, freeing the activator proteins from
  the BH3 binding pockets in the anti-apoptotic proteins and executing cell death
  by binding to BAX or BAK. The two pathways converge at activation of the effector
  caspase-3.
