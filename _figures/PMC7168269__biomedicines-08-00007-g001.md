caption: The roles of gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) in the immune microenvironment.
  Stromal cells can support GCSC development through various kinds of interactions.
  Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) enhance the induction of VEGF and COX2/PGE2
  in GCSCs through monocyte chemoattractant-1 (MCP-1) and milk-fat globule-epidermal
  growth factor-VIII (MFG-E8). Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) not only directly
  enhance the CSC capabilities of GCSCs by activating the Smad2 pathway (TGF-β inhibitors
  inhibit this process) but also attract macrophages that are converted into TAMs
  by CXCL12. GCSCs can inhibit T cell activity through the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction.
  Some theories suggest that GCSCs affect the balance of Treg and Th17 subsets, and
  GCSCs impair the function of dendritic cells (DCs). The solid line represents strong
  evidences supporting theory in GCSC; the dashed line represents possible evidences
  guide theory in GCSC.
