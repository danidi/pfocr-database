caption: 'Investigational approaches targeting the factors contributing to celiac
  disease pathogenesis. Long, Pro- and Gln-rich fragments of gluten survive gastrointestinal
  breakdown by luminal and brush border enzymes and consequently enter the lamina
  propria. Production of non-toxic cereals lacking antigenic peptides or sourdough
  fermentation during baking could avoid the ensuing immune response. Alternatively,
  gluten-sequestering polymers, oral proteases, and probiotics may reduce the exposure
  to immunogenic gluten peptides. At the intestinal epithelium, compromised epithelial
  barrier function enables paracellular and transcellular transport of gluten peptides.
  Antagonists of zonulin and inhibitors of the peptide-sIgA-CD71 transport pathway
  could reduce this paracellular and transcellular permeability, respectively. Gluten
  peptides induce epithelial and other cells to secrete IL-15, resulting in an increase
  in the number of IELs. These IELs are subsequently activated by epithelial MICA/B-NKG2D
  and CD94/NKG2C-HLA-E interactions that stimulating cytotoxic effects on epithelial
  cells. Neutralizing IL-15-mediated effects could provide a therapeutic benefit for
  celiac patients. Most gluten peptides survive gastric digestion and are excellent
  substrates of TG2 in the lamina propria. The resulting deamidated gluten peptides
  are then recognized by CD4+ T cells in the context of HLA-DQ2 or –DQ8 on antigen
  presenting cells. Thus, either TG2 inhibitors or HLA blockers are potential drug
  candidates. The T-cell response in the mucosa could be suppressed by anti-CD3-antibodies
  or peptide vaccination, or by blocking T-cell homing with anti-integrin α4β7 or
  CCR9 antagonists. Upon activation, gluten reactive T cells secrete inflammatory
  cytokines including IFN-γ and TNF that contribute to enteropathy. Anti-IFN-γ– and
  –TNF-antibodies could be considered as therapeutic targets. Finally, through interactions
  with T cells, B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce autoantibodies
  against TG2. B-cell depletion with anti-CD20 antibodies is yet another possible
  therapeutic strategy. Further means to prevent or treat celiac disease in the future
  is modifying the inflammatory immune response by hookworm infection or with steroid
  therapy. Abbreviations: sIgA, secretory IgA. TG2, transglutaminase 2; HLA, human
  leukocyte antigen; IFN-γ, interferon gamma; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.'
