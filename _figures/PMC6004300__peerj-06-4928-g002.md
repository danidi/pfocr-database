caption: ① Alcohol-stimulated KCs express CCL7 to facilitate HSCs phenotypic transform,
  consequently, CRC liver metastases rate increases. ② Intratumor overexpression of
  CCL7 can enhance vascular permeability by recruiting TAMs to promote RCC brain metastasis.
  ③ The level of CCL7 is increased after being stimulated by IL-1α and IL-1β in CAFs.
  Excessive CCL7 promotes EMT progression via the TGF-β pathway, resulting in increased
  tumor invasion and metastasis and CCL7 also promotes tumor proliferation. ④ CCL7
  derived from tumor cells binds to CCR3, and then participates in the EMT process
  and promotes tumor metastasis via ERK/JNK signal pathway. ⑤ Interacting with its
  receptors, CCL7 secreted by CAAs can instruct the tumor cells along the concentration
  gradient of CCL7 dissemination. ⑥ TAMs-secreted CCL7 promotes the recruitment of
  basophils into TDLNs, which facilitates tumor metastasis.
