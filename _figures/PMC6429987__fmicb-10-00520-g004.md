caption: Regulation of immunometabolism in macrophages infected with Mtb. In early
  phase of Mtb infection, mTOR kinase activation leads to the immunometabolic shift
  to M1 macrophages that generate pro-inflammatory cytokine by activation of NF-κB
  and HIF1α signaling. M1-like macrophages increase glycolysis and inflammation through
  HIF1α and NF-κB signaling pathways. In later phase of infection, M2-like macrophages
  increase mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation through AMPK activation. AMPK pathway
  enhances PGC1α and ERRα activity that is required for autophagy activation through
  transcriptional and translational regulation. Although the mTOR-HIF1α pathway is
  essential for initial control of Mtb growth, excessive induction of inflammation
  seems to be harmful to the host. Similarly, the prolonged activation of AMPK signaling
  to drive M2-like macrophages may result in the immunosuppression that is detrimental
  to eradicate intracellular mycobacteria.
