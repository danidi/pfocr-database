caption: Scheme of SAMHD1’s role in HMA metabolism and effector functions. Metabolic
  pathway of DAC and AZA.After their cellular uptake by nucleoside-specific transporters,
  AZA and DAC are activated and metabolically converted into the active nucleotides
  AZA-TP and DAC-TP, respectively, by sequential phosphorylation events. Importantly,
  a fraction of the intermediate AZA-DP can be converted to DAC-DP by ribonucleotide
  reductase (RNR). DAC-TP, but not AZA-TP, can activate and become hydrolyzed by SAMHD1.
  Strategies to interfere with SAMHD1 expression and function include degradation
  through Vpx-carrying virus-like particles (Vpx-VLPs), RNA interference or small-molecule
  inhibitors of SAMHD1’s triphosphohydrolase activity. See also Supplementary Fig.
