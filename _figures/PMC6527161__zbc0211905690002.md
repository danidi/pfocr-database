caption: Schematic representation of the Raetz pathway for the synthesis of Kdo2-lipid
  A. Shown is the pathway as operative in E. coli K-12 according to Ref. . The pathway
  is composed of nine conserved enzymes located in the cytoplasm or the cytoplasmic
  membrane. The chemical structure of substrates and products of the reactions is
  indicated. From the top left, arrows show the order of reactions, and the corresponding
  enzymes are colored according to the resulting structural modification of the product.
  Where appropriate, the names of substrates or products are specified.
