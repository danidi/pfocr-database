caption: Four hyperglycemia-induced pathogenic pathways which are related to overproduction
  of ROS and inflammation progression in atherosclerosis. Hyperglycemia causes mitochondrial
  overproduction of ROS via a greater oxygen use, high redox potential and mito-fission
  state. Increased ROS leads to nuclear DNA damage and activates nuclear PARP, which
  inhibits GAPDH activity, shunting early glycolytic intermediates into pathogenic
  signaling pathways, including activation of polyol pathway, PKC and AGE. These pathways
  amplify production of ROS and promote pathogenic inflammation progression in atherosclerosis.
  The polyol pathway generates ROS by consuming NADPH and GSH, and increasing subsequent
  NADH oxidation during the conversion of sorbitol to fructose. As a key rate-limiting
  enzyme of polyol pathway, AR promotes the expression of inflammatory cytokines such
  as TNF-α and NF-κB. Inhibition of GAPDH contributes to DHAP production and subsequent
  increase of PKC and AGE, both of which induce an increase in NADPH oxidase, inflammation
  factors expression and a decrease in eNOS activation. Moreover, PKC promotes insulin
  resistance by inhibiting downstream expression of PI3K-AKT. As a precursor of the
  majority of AGE adducts, methylglyoxal is increased in hyperglycemia, and then promote
  the expression of AGE, RAGE and RAGE ligands.
