caption: Schematic of major components in the Notch signaling pathway and Mib domain
  organization. (a) Notch signaling initiates upon transcellular engagement of a Notch
  ligand with a Notch receptor, and relies on ubiquitin-dependent internalization
  of the ligand. In vertebrates, ubiquitination is dependent on the E3 ligase Mind
  bomb 1 (Mib1). Transcellular delivery of force is thought to expose a site (S2)
  within the Notch negative regulatory region (NRR) for cleavage by ADAM-family metalloproteases.
  S2 cleavage is followed by cleavage at site S3 by gamma secretase, leading to release
  and entry of of the intracellular Notch (ICN) domain into the nucleus. Within the
  nucleus, ICN forms a ternary transcriptional complex with CSL and MAML to regulate
  target gene expression. (b) Domain organization of Mib1 highlighting the MZM, REP,
  ANK, and RNG regions of the protein. The MZM domain contains two Mib-Herc2 domains
  (blue and yellow) flanking a ZZ Zinc finger (green). The REP domain contains two
  tandem “Mib repeat” elements (orange and red). The ANK domain is composed of nine
  ankyrin-type repeats (light green), and the C-terminal RNG domain is composed of
  three RING elements (cyan).
