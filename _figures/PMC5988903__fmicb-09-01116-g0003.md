caption: Hypothetical mechanism of action of eugenol. Eugenol perturbs cellular signaling
  pathway by modulating GPCRs and oxylipins expression levels. Simultaneously, decreased
  levels of veA might make fungus less tolerant to oxidative stress response which
  could trigger an activation of several genes involved in the stress signaling pathway
  such as stress response transcription factor srrA, C2H2 transcription factor msnA,
  and down-regulate bZIP transcription factor ap-1. Final targets of these modulators
  correspond to fugal antioxidant system consisting in genes coding for catalasess
  and superoxide dismutase defenses. The down regulation of genes belonging to the
  AFB1 cluster may then be a final sequence of the repressive modulation caused by
  the over expression of OSR transcription factors. Dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis
  prevents the biosynthesis of Nor-1, Ver-1, and OmtA, and the aflatoxisomes from
  performing their normal function in aflatoxin formation. For conidiophores development,
  the growth signaling from the activated fadA and sfaD should be improved by flbA.
  Upon the activation of them, flbA causes asexual development by the activation of
  the brlA gene and repression of esdC gene. Up- or down-regulation of gene upon eugenol
  addition is represented by red and green arrow. PKs, protein kenase; TF, transcription
  factor.
