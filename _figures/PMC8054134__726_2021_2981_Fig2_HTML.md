caption: Sources of proline in RPE. Dietary proline is taken up by RPE cells likely
  through SLC6A20 transporter. Collagen and other proline-rich proteins are degraded
  via MMPs, and proline-containing fragments are further degraded into free proline
  by prolidase and prolinase enzymes. TIMPs are endogenous inhibitors of MMPs, whose
  mutation results in excess degradation of ECM. Proline is also generated via de
  novo synthesis from glutamate and ornithine substrates. Glutamate is converted into
  P5C intermediate through P5CS, which is then reduced to proline by PYCRs. Ornithine
  and arginine can also convert into proline via reverse reaction of OAT. Biosynthesis
  of proline is energetically expensive, requiring 2 NADPH and 1 ATP from glutamate
  or glutamine pathway, and 1 NAD(P)H from arginine or ornithine pathway. The genetic
  identity of transporters responsible for proline transport between cytosol and mitochondria
  is still unknown. αKG alpha-ketoglutarate, MMP matrix metalloproteinases, OAT ornithine
  aminotransferase, P5C pyrroline-5-carboxylate, P5CS P5C synthase, PYCR1,2,3 P5C
