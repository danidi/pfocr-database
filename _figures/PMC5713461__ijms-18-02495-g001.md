caption: Regulation of HIF1α under normoxia and hypoxia conditions. Under normoxia
  conditions, the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) hydroxylates HIF1α via molecular
  oxygen. Hydroxylated HIF1α becomes polyubiquitylated (Ub) for proteosomal degradation
  by binding the Von Hippel–Lindau protein (pVHL). Under hypoxic conditions, the activity
  of PHD is reduced. HIF1α is directly translocated to the nucleus where it binds
  HIF1β and CREB binding protein/p300 (CBP/p300) at the hypoxia response element (HRE)
  to act as transcription factor. If the VHL gene is mutated, it is not capable to
  bind HIF1α. HIF1α leads to the transcription of the target genes as described under
  hypoxia conditions.
