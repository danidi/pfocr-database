caption: CFTR, NHERF1, and β2AR form a macromolecular complex together with signaling
  molecules at the apical surfaces of airway epithelia. G proteins can be associated
  with β2AR and protein kinase A (PKA) anchored to AKAP (ezrin) and is likely to be
  in the complex. Upon agonist activation of the receptor, adenylate cyclase is stimulated
  through the Gs pathway, leading to an increase in highly compartmentalized cAMP.
  This increased local concentration of cAMP leads to the activation of PKA, which
  is in close proximity to CFTR, resulting in a compartmentalized and specific signaling
  from β2AR to the CFTR channel. Phosphorylation disrupts the complex, leading to
  the receptor-based activation of CFTR.
