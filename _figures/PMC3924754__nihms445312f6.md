caption: Etoposide promotes p53 translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to
  promote transcription of target genes involved in cell death. This activity is reduced
  following treatment with pifithrin α (PFα). A portion of p53 remains outside the
  nucleus and presumably translocates to mitochondria to inactivate pro-survival Bcl-2
  family members. Pifithrin μ (PFμ) can reduce p53 association with mitochondria,
  resulting in protection from death. The mitochondria may release ROS, which can
  disrupt the lysosomal membrane and cause release of cathepsins, which cleave specific
  target proteins. P53 may also translocate to the lysosome and result in the release
  of cathepsins. The activities of several cathepsins are inhibited by zFA and zFF,
  which reduce ETO-induced PCD. Bafilomycin A1 (BA1) inhibits lysosomal acidification,
  resulting in decreased cathepsin activity and reduced PCD. Spautin1 can inhibit
  ubiquitin-specific proteases that can regulate p53, although other targets are known
  to exist. Finally, EndoG is released from mitochondria to induce DNA fragmentation.
