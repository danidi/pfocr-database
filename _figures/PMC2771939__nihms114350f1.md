caption: 'Actin polymerization and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton occurs
  upon triggering of multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs). The transduced
  signals activate intracellular signaling pathways, which are modulated by local
  PIP2 and PIP3 levels. Three PIP2-dependent pathways for regulation of the actin
  cytoskeleton are shown here. ERM proteins are membrane-microfilament linkers which
  when activated (membrane-bound to PIP2 by FERM domain), function in cell adhesion,
  migration, and morphology. When ERM proteins are deactivated (cytosolic), they allow
  morphology changes and formation of a mature immune synapse. Vav is localized to
  the membrane via its PH domain binding to PIP2 and PIP3, and through association
  with membrane-associated adaptor molecules such as the LAT-associated signalosome
  in T cells. Vav is an exchange factor for Rho GTPases (Rac, Cdc42), which regulate
  actin polymerization through different pathways. One important pathway is by activating
  WASP, which nucleates actin via the Arp 2/3 complex. The integrin LFA-1 is activated
  by “inside-out” signaling. Abbreviations are: TCR, T cell receptor; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PH, pleckstrin
  homology; ERM, ezrin-radixin-moesin; FERM, band 4.1, ezrin, radixin, moesin; WASP,
  Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein; LAT, linker of activated T cells.'
