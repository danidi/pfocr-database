caption: It has been reported that IFG binds to IFNAR-2 and activates the tyrosine
  kinase Jak-1 and Tyk-2. Jak-1 induces and stimulates the phosphorylation of STAT-3
  [pSTAT-3]. We investigated the role of IFG mediated signaling mechanism in activating
  macrophages to restrict the intracellular growth of Mtb. [1] The phosphorylation
  of STAT-3 is induced by Jak-1. [2] Subsequently, Akt is activated through STAT-3
  along with PI3K. [3,4] This signaling translocates NF-κB into the nucleus and upregulates
  the IL-6 secretion, which receives a feed-back mechanism through pSTAT-3, Akt and
  therefore induces autophagy. Thus, ensuring the activation and survival of the Mtb
  infected macrophages. [5] The induction of autophagy in the Mtb infected macrophages
  directly involved in the killing of Mtb. [6] We propose that pSTAT-3 binds to the
  promoter sequence of INOS gene to produce ions in the cytosol that generates NO,
  a potent antimicrobial agent that may ultimately restrict the growth of Mtb. The
  data were validated by blocking the Akt-PI3K, iNOS and autophagy with their respective
  inhibitors to establish the role of autophagy in restricting the growth of Mtb by
  IFG stimulated macrophages. [7] Blocking of the Akt-PI3K, iNOS (NM), autophagy (3MA|CQ)
  with their specific inhibitors and therefore substantial reduction in the secretion
  of NO and autophagy, as well as increase in the survival of Mtb signifies that autophagy
  is directly involved in the killing of Mtb. Signifying that the function of iNOS
  and autophagy are interlinked. Overall, this mechanism illustrates that IFG plays
  a key role in controlling the survival of Mtb inside macrophages.
