caption: EGF and TGFα are typical growth factors that transduce growth signals via
  EGFR (HER1), which is one member of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases.
  Upon ligand binding, HER1 and HER2 dimerize, resulting in autophosphorylation and
  activation of the intracellular kinase domains which initiates the cascade of Ras,
  BRAF and MEKK. The latter phosphorylates MAPK (ERK) which activates transcription
  factors including ELK1 positively regulating proliferation and cell survival. This
  pathway is well studied in a variety of cancers and can be inhibited at a number
  of levels including the receptor (e.g. by Nimotuzumab or Cetuximab) the kinase itself
  (e.g. Gefitinib) or at the level of RAF (e.g. Sorafenib). The absence of susceptible
  mutations in EGFR might explain the lack of efficacy of Gefitinib in GEP- and BP-NENs.
  Mutations in TK are associated with cross-activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
  but this appears only to be a potential relationship and has not been demonstrated
  in NENs. Mutations in K-Ras occur in ~2% and may lead to loss of responsiveness
  to EGFR monoclonal approaches. The efficacy of other agents targeting different
  levels of this pathway in GEP- and BP-NENs is not currently known.*=KRAS mutation
