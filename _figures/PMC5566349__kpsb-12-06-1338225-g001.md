caption: Biosynthetic pathways for ornithine-derived alkaloids, polyamine, and nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Each defined step of the pathway is represented by an
  arrow and named enzyme, while undefined parts dependent on single or multiple steps
  are shown with broken arrows. Steps in black are hypothesized to be involved predominantly
  in alkaloid biosynthesis, while those predominantly associated with related primary
  metabolic pathways are shown in gray. Quinolinate synthase (QS) is shown in dark
  gray, as it contributes to both nicotine and NAD pathways. It has been proposed
  that putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT) and N-methylputrescine oxidase (MPO) have
  evolved from spermidine synthase (SPDS) and diamine oxidase (DAO), respectively.
  AO; aspartate oxidase, QPT; quinolinate phosphoribosyl transferase, ODC; ornithine
  decarboxylase.
