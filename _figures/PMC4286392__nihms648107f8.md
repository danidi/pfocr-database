caption: 'Shh and Wnt signaling pathways of non-myelinating oligodendrocytes relative
  to corresponding ones of their myelinating counterpart. We have used the Ingenuity
  software interacting networks to analyse A2B5+/OTMP+ gene expression data relative
  to those of O4+ committed OLGs. Red denotes up-regulation and green down-regulation
  of transcripts in the A2B5+/OTMP+ relative to O4+. Edge types: solid line = direct
  action; broken line = indirect action; arrow from A to B = act on; line joining
  A to B = binding only; line ending in vertical dash = inhibits. (A) This network
  shows the predicted sonic hedgehog pathway in the non-myelinating phenotype. Note
  the upregulation of transcripts for Pdgfrα (arrowhead), Pdgfrβ (arrowhead) and the
  growth factor Pdgfc (asterisk). Their interaction should result in the expression
  of the heterodimer PDGFRαβ on the surface of the A2B5+/OTMP+ cells, silencing their
  response to PDGF-AA – a ligand for myelinating OLGs, and thereby segregating the
  two cell types. Note also the downregulation of Pdgfa (double arrow). The growth
  factor receptor (double asterisks) implicated in the regulation of the other components
  remains to be elucidated. A cross-talk with Notch signaling (> 4-fold increase in
  Hey1; large arrow) is hinted by its apparent involvement in the increased expression
  (3.3-fold) of phospholipase C-γ (small arrow). (B) This interacting network illustrates
  A2B5+/OTMP+ transcripts pertaining to Wnt signaling. Asterisks mark the receptors
  Fzd (frizzled), co-receptor Lrp6 and the protein DVL1 (dishevilled); they are all
  upregulated. Note that NrCAM (arrowhead) appears as a cell-specific target of Wnt
  signaling.'
