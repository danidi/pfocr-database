caption: Metabolic profile of the PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node for B. subtilis WB
  growing on xylose. The metabolite concentrations from the central carbon metabolism
  for the three growth phases as indicated in 4 are given. Samples were taken after
  9, 11, and 14 h for phase I, II, and III, respectively. Cultivations were carried
  out in triplicates. The bar graphs represent the mean. The error bar indicates the
  standard deviation. CitZ, citrate synthase; MaeA, malic enzyme; MalS, malic enzyme;
  Mdh, malate dehydrogenase; MleA, malic enzyme; PdhABCD, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  PckA, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PycA, pyruvate
  carboxylase; PykA, pyruvate kinase; YtsJ, malic enzyme (modified from Meyer and
  Stülke, ). 2OG, 2-oxoglutarate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; F6P, fructose-6-phosphate;
  FBP, fructose-bisphosphate; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; GAP, D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  R5P, ribose-5-phosphate; S7P, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate.
