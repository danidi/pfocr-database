caption: 'Mechanisms of ferroptosis. Mechanisms of Ferroptosis. Excess irons are regarded
  as an important factor for ferroptosis. The circulated iron (Fe3+) combined with
  transferrin (TF) enters into cells mediated by transferrin receptor (TFR). Under
  the catalysis of iron oxide reductase STEAP3, Fe3+ can be deoxidized to Fe2+ and
  ultimately, releasing it into labile iron pool (LIP) mediated by DMT1. LIP consists
  of iron from endosomal uptake of circulated iron and ferritin degradation (ferritinophagy).

  (Gly) are materials of glutathione (GSH), which is an important antioxidant in cells.
  Transsulfurylation pathway may also increase the level of cysteine transformed from
  methionine (Met). Cysteine can be imported directly by alanine/serine/cysteine transporter
  (system ASC) under reducing conditions. The uptake of free PUAs such as arachidonic
  acid (AA) or adrenoxyl (AdA) mediated by fatty acid translocase (FAT) and fatty
  acid transport protein (FATP) can be converted to membrane phospholipids by enzyme
  acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) and lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), which is important to ROS generation. PE-PUFAs can be
