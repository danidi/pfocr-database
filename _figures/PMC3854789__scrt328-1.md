caption: 'Dexamethasone (Dex) induces the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells
  by increasing the transcription of FHL-2. Binding of FHL-2 to β-catenin potentiates
  the transport of β-catenin to the nucleus, where it binds TCF/LEF-1 (T-cell factor/lymphoid
  enhancer factor) and leads to the transcription of Runx2. Dex also contributes to
  osteogenic differentiation by increasing the expression of the Runx2 co-activator
  TAZ. Additionally, Dex treatment induces the expression of the gene encoding MKP-1
  (a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway),
  which dephosphorylates and thereby activates the key transcription factor Runx2
  via extracellular related kinase (ERK) signaling. The addition of ascorbic acid
  (Asc) facilitates osteogenic differentiation by increasing secretion of collagen
  type I (Col1), resulting in increased binding of α2β1 integrins to Col1. This leads
  to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in the MAPK signaling pathway, and a subsequent
  translocation of P-ERK1/2 to the nucleus where it activates Runx2 by phosphorylation.
  Abbreviations: ECM, extracellular matrix; +OH, hydroxylation; MEK, MAPK/ERK Kinase;
  FAK, Focal Adhesion Kinase; P, phosphate.'
