caption: 'Components of cysteine metabolism, redox homeostasis, and the γ-glutamyl
  cycle in control (CTRL), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) pulmonary arterial
  vascular smooth muscle cells (PAVSMCs), and PAH PAVSMCs treated with mTOR kinase
  inhibitor PP242. Box plots for altered metabolites, combined with reaction schemes
  including key components and enzymes, are shown. Data for PAVSMCs (5 subjects/group)
  are presented as box-and-whiskers graphs as follows: light yellow: nondiseased (control);
  light blue PAH PAVSMCs; dark blue: vehicle-treated PAH PAVSMCs (Veh); orange: PP242-treated
  PAH PAVSMCs (details in ). Data are in arbitrary units specific to internal standards
  for each quantified metabolite and normalized by total protein concentration. *P
  ≤ 0.05, #0.05 < P < 0.1 by the Welch 2-sample t test. Enzymes that catalyze particular
  steps in the pathway are shown in blue boxes labeled with their abbreviations according
  to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database. CBS: cystathionine-β-synthase;
  CSE: cystathionine gamma-lyase (cystathionase); GCS: glutamylcysteine synthetase;
  GGT: gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase 1; GS: glutathione synthetase; GSR: glutathione
  reductase; MTR: methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase; OXRs: oxidoreductases.
  cys-gly: cysteinylglycine; GSH: reduced glutathione; GSSG: oxidized glutathione;
