caption: 'Model of competition for Und-P in E. coli. The PG, ECA, and O-antigen biosynthesis
  pathways compete for pools of Und-P (red) and UDP-GlcNAc (blue). Interruption of
  the biosynthesis of ECA, O antigen, or the lipid A core sequesters part of the pool
  of Und-P and therefore restricts its availability for PG synthesis. Note that the
  colanic acid biosynthesis pathway, which also utilizes Und-P, is omitted from this
  illustration because this compound is not appreciably produced under normal growth
  conditions, though it is highly expressed during stress. Abbreviations: PG, peptidoglycan;
  UDP-M5, UDP–N-acetylmuramic acid–l-alanine–d-glutamate–meso-diaminopimelic acid–d-alanine–d-alanine;
  Und-P, undecaprenyl phosphate; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Und-PP, undecaprenyl
  pyrophosphate; ECA, enterobacterial common antigen; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.'
