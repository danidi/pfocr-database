caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanisms for the inhibitory actions
  of the β15–42 fragment. (A) Schematic presentation of fibrin and its fragments used
  in the present study. Fibrin E region and the E1 and NDSK-II fragments derived from
  this region are colored blue with their βN-domains colored red; the β15–42 and (β15–44)2
  fragments representing N-terminal halves of these domains are also colored red.
  (B) In the proposed direct inhibition mechanism,, fibrin degradation product E1
  fragment bridges leukocytes to the endothelium through the interaction with leukocyte
  CD11c integrin and endothelial VE-cadherin to promote their transendothelial migration,
  and the β15–42 fragment directly inhibits E1-VE-cadherin interaction thereby reducing
  leukocyte transmigration. (C) In the proposed Fyn-dependent signaling mechanism,,
  β15–42 signals to Fyn resulting in dissociation of the latter from VE-cadherin,
  association with p190 RhoGAP, and subsequent inhibition of RhoA. Since active RhoA
  promotes stress-induced opening of endothelial cell adherent junctions and thereby
  leukocyte transmigration, its inhibition prevents cell contraction and maintains
  endothelial barrier function.
