caption: 'A) Experimental design depicting the sampling time points represented as
  days post hatching (dph) during the different gonad developmental stages covered
  by the study. Vertical arrows link the different sampling points with their developmental
  stage and their corresponding period (in italics) during puberty in European sea
  bass. Abbreviations: undifferentiated ovary (UnO), undifferentiated testis (UnT),
  early differentiated testis (EdT), immature differentiated testis (IdT), early recrudescent
  testis (ErT), previtellogenesis (Pvit), vitellogenesis (Vit), maturation (Mat) and
  ovulation (Ovu). B) Schematic representation of the retinoic acid signaling pathway.
  Genes for which their expression levels were assessed in the study are represented
  in bold. Dotted line stands for binding protein interactions. Abbreviations: retinol
  (ROL), retinoid binding protein 4 (rbp4), stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (stra6),
  retinal (RAL), lecithin retinol acyltransferase (lrat), alcohol dehydrogenase (adh),
  aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a2 (aldh1a2), aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a3 (aldh1a3), retinoic
  acid (RA), cellular retinoid binding protein 1 (crabp1), polar molecules product
  of RA degradation (4-oxo-RA), retinoid receptor x, isoform a (rxra), retinoic acid
  receptor, isoform a (rara), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, isoform
  g (pparg), retinoic acid response element (rare).'
