caption: PARP mechanism of action. PARP (poly-ADP ribose polymerase) is activated
  when DNA is damaged. PARP enzymes modify DNA-associated proteins by adding chains
  of ADP ribose units. Chemotherapy agents, UV light, and products of cellular metabolism
  cause single-strand DNA damage that must be identified and repaired by PARP pathway
  activation, predominantly through BER (). With continuous PARP inhibition, these
  single-strand breaks are converted to double-strand breaks during DNA replication
  where replication forks stall at the point of DNA damage (–). If the amount of DNA
  damage exceeds the repair capacity, cell death ensues, especially in the setting
  of dysfunctional HR. Alternatively, massive activation of PARP following platinum
  treatment may deplete NAD+ leading to necrotic cell death (Adapted with permission
  from Ratnam and Low, ()).
