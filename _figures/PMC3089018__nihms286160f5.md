caption: Model of the regulation for CD300B expression. Retinoic acid can diffuse
  through the cell membrane, and then enter the nucleus where it binds to the complex
  of RAR and RXR, increasing the gene transcription of CD300B up to 20 fold (). On
  the other hand, PMA can also induce the mRNA expression of CD300B (~5 fold). Interestingly,
  the combination of RA and PMA synergistically increases the CD300B mRNA expression
  by 60 fold (). Indeed, PMA induces the CD300B transcription through MEK/ERK signaling
  pathway (). Moreover, the gene transcription process is independent of new protein
  synthesis and is time dependent. The CD300B protein amount can be increased by PMA
  or RA+PMA, but not by RA alone (). The newly synthesized CD300B protein can relocate
  to the plasma membrane. Based on these data and the structure of CD300B [], we hypothesize
  that CD300B can interact with a putative coupled protein by the positively charged
  lysine in the transmembrane domain of CD300B, and, upon ligand stimulation, CD300B
  can be phosphorylated and pass the signal to the downstream proteins, such as DAP12,
  to initiate a proper innate immune response, which currently is unknown for CD300B.
