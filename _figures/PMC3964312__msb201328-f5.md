caption: 'Pathway analysis of the E2-regulated genes associated with the ERα and ERβ-binding
  site clusters. (A) Clustering of gene ontologies that are differentially enriched
  in ERα cells versus ERβ cells: ClueGO plugin of Cytoscape was used to identify differentially
  regulated GO terms between ERα and ERβ cells. (B) Expanded view of M-phase-associated
  clusters. (C) Expanded view of additional M-phase-associated clusters.'
