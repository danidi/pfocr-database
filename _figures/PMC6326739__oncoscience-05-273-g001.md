caption: Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), AR inhibition therapy, and platinum-based
  chemotherapy leads to treatment-resistant, castration-resistant prostate cancer
  (CRPC). A subset of these cancers progress to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC),
  a highly metastatic disease that can exhibit small cell morphology and neuroendocrine
  differentiation. Zhang et al. recently demonstrated increased DNA damage response
  (DDR) gene expression in NEPC compared to CRPC with adenocarcinoma morphology, and
  further identified the MYCN-PARP-DDR pathway driven by N-MYC transcriptional regulation
  of PARP1, PARP2, and DDR genes []. This report links NEPC with increased DDR expression
  and establishes a novel N-MYC-driven molecular pathway for biomarker development
  and targeted therapy approaches. The MYCN-PARP-DDR signaling pathway identified
  in NEPC may be required to contain the deleterious effects of DNA damage that might
  occur prior to and during the transition from CRPC-Adeno to CRPC-Neuro.
