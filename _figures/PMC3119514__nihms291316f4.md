caption: Non-canonical activation pathways. Receptor binding of LTβ, BAFF, CD40, and
  RANK initiate the non-canonical signaling pathway. TRAF proteins and other intracellular
  target molecules are recruited, eventually leading to the activation of NIK through
  an unknown mechanism. NIK contains binding domains that interact with TRAF2, TRAF3,
  TRAF5, and TRAF6, but the specific roles of TRAF and other proteins in the non-canonical
  pathway is still controversial. After NIK phosphorylation, IKKα phosphorylates p100,
  marking it for poly-ubiquitination and partial degradation by the SCFβ-TrCP complex
  and 26S proteasome. Partial degradation of p100 yields functional p52, which most
  commonly forms heterodimers with Rel-B and translocates to the nucleus to initiate
  gene transcription
