caption: There were two processes. The first one could resist tumor metastasis. CCL3
  encoded the macrophage inflammatory proteins-1α (MIP-1α), which was produced by
  macrophages and had the ability to induce the migration of monocytes. Then the monocytes
  differentiated into dendritic cells (DCs) to recognize an antigen and activate tumor-specific
  T-cell responses via their potent antigen-presenting capacity to efficiently recognize
  and kill stem-like cancer cells [–]. The second one could promote tumor metastasis.
  Mature IL-1β could active macrophages, endothelial cells, monocytes, neutrophils
  or fibroblasts to secrete IL-8, which had the ability to promote angiogenesis of
  metastatic tumor tissues. This process might be dependent on the JNK pathway. Besides,
  the activated fibroblasts by mature IL-1β could secrete gelatinase B (MMP-9), which
  could promote the conversion of inactive pro IL-1β into mature IL-1β [].
