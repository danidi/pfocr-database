caption: Overview of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in leukemia. The Wnt signaling
  pathway is a central pathway, which results in the transmission of growth-promoting
  signals that control the activity of β-catenin. Stabilization of β-catenin results
  in its translocation to the nucleus and promotion of gene transcription by TCF/LEF
  transcription complex. This can result in the transcription of genes such as Cyclin
  D, c-Myc, SALL-4, PPARδ and other genes. In the absence of Wnt binding of Frizzled,
  the multiprotein destruction complex (MDC) is activated and glycogen synthase kinase
  3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylates β-catenin and it is targeted for proteasomal degradation.
  In the presence of Wnt binding, this complex is inactivated. Interactions with other
  signaling pathways such as PI3K/PTEN/Akt exist, which influence GSK-3β activity
  (inactivation). This pathway can be activated by Flt-3 and other receptors. Thus,
  there are interactions between the Wnt and PI3K/PTEN/Akt pathways. Wnt is also postulated
  to interact with the Notch and other signaling pathways. The Wnt pathway is frequently
  dysregulated in leukemia. This can occur by mutations at Flt-3, chromosomal translocations,
  methylation of the promoter regions inhibitory genes such as WIF-1 and many other
  mechanisms (e.g., mutations at either PI3K or PTEN, which result in the activation
  of Akt expression).
