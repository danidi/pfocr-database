caption: The JAK/STAT and Hh pathways. (A) The Drosophila testis. See text for details.
  (B) JAK/STAT signaling in Drosophila. Binding of the secreted ligand Unpaired (Upd)
  to its receptor Domeless (Dome) causes phosphorylation and activation of the Janus
  kinase (JAK) Hopscotch (Hop). Hop in turns phosphorylates the transcription factor
  Stat92E, which dimerizes and enters the nucleus to promote the transcription of
  target genes, including zfh1 and chinmo. (C) The Hh pathway in the absence (‘OFF’)
  or presence (‘ON’) of ligand. When Hh is not present, Patched (Ptc) inhibits Smoothened
  (Smo), rendering it inactive. In the absence of Smo activity, the transcription
  factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci) is cleaved from a full-length transcriptional activator
  form (Ciact) to a repressor (Cirep) by a complex that includes the Protein kinase
  A (PKA) enzyme and scaffolding proteins such as Costal2. Hh ligand (‘ON’) prevents
  Ptc activity, allowing Smo to inhibit Ci cleavage, meaning that Ciact enters the
  nucleus to activate transcription of target genes, such as ptc. GSC, germ line stem
  cell; CySC, cyst stem cell; Y, tyrosine residues.
