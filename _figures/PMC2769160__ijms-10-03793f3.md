caption: The role of trehalose pathway in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Trehalose in
  prokaryotes dramatically accumulates in osmotic or thermal stress conditions; it
  can signal from the bacteria to the plant cell stress tolerance and nitrogen and
  carbon metabolism. In plants, trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) plays a central role regulating
  sugar metabolism and plant development. Glucose and trehalose are also important
  keys to several signaling and regulatory pathways and integrate external cues to
  adapt cells to abiotic stress, growth and development. It seems that TPS1 and ABI4
  are part of the HXK1 signaling pathway. Other molecular actors in this network are
  the 14-3-3 proteins, which are known to interact with phosphoserine in diverse proteins
  including TPS; and SnRK1, which signals catabolism in starvation conditions, and
  is countered by T6P to induce anabolism. Thus, an important role of the trehalose
  biosynthesis pathway in higher plants would be the synthesis of small amounts of
  T6P and/or trehalose signaling molecules rather than accumulation of this latter
  as an osmoprotective compound.
