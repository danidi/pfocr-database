caption: Representation of the metabolites and related pathways involved in the Epithelial-Mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) process in cancer. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to promote
  EMT through the upregulation of transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ-1) and Mothers
  Against Decapentaplegic Homolog 2/3 (Smad2/3) [] as well through the increased expression
  of Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) and NF-KB [] in biliary epithelial cells. Conversely,
  Cadaverine (CAD) can inhibit EMT in breast cancer cell lines through the activation
  of trace amino acid receptors 8 and 9 (TAAR8/9) modulating the expression of metalloproteinase
  9 (MMP9) []. In breast cancer cell lines, inhibition of EMT can be carried out through
  the metabolic pathway of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that activates Free Fatty
  Acid Receptor 2 (FFAR2), leading to inhibition of the Hippo-Yap pathway and increased
  expression of adhesion protein E-cadherin, and FFAR3, resulting in mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signaling inhibition []. Finally, acetate can promote EMT
  by increasing the expression of the zinc finger protein Snail Family Transcriptional
  Repressor 1 (SNAI1) and Acyl-CoA Synthetase Short Chain Family Member 2 (ACSS2)
  in renal carcinoma cells under glucose limitation [].
