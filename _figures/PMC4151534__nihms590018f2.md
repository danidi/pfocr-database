caption: 'IL-1α and IL-1β synthesis and signal transduction pathway. IL-1α and -β
  are synthesized as precursor proteins (pro-IL-1, pro-IL-1β) which then undergo proteolytic
  cleavage by either calpain or caspase-1 to produce the mature active forms, mIL-1α
  and mIL-β respectively. While pro-IL-1β is biologically inactive, myristoylated
  membrane associated pro-IL-1α can signal through the IL-1R to initiate cell-to-cell
  signaling. In addition, nuclear translocation of pro-IL-1α or the cleaved N-terminal
  pro-peptide that retains its nuclear localization sequence (NLS), elicits biological
  functions. Pro-IL-1α, mIL-1α and mIL-β all bind to IL-1RI, which recruits the IL-1
  receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) as a co-receptor. The receptor complex recruits
  two adaptor proteins, the myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88)
  and interleukin-1 receptor-activated protein kinase (IRAK). Sequential phosphorylation
  of IRAK4, IRAK1, IRAK2 and lastly TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, results in polyubiquitination
  of signaling molecules, such as TGF-β-activated protein kinase (TAK-1) at K63. This
  modification allows for the association of TAK-1 with TRAF6 and subsequent activation
  of many signaling proteins: JNK, p38 and ERK1/2 as well as transcription factors:
  NF-κB and AP-1 which control expression of a number of inflammatory and catabolic
  genes. Signaling through IL-1 receptor complex is modulated by inhibitory actions
  of IL-1RII, sIL-1RII, sIL-1RAcP as well as IL-1 family member, IL-1 receptor antagonist
  (IL-1Ra).'
