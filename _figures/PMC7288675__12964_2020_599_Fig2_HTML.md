caption: The regulation of the microbiota in adaptive immunity. Bacteroides fragilis
  stimulates TLR2 on CD4+ T cells by producing polysaccharide A (PSA), thereby enhancing
  the expression of Forkhead Box P3 (Foxp3), IL-10, and TGF-β. Butyrate activates
  Foxp3 via a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), induces differentiation of Tregs,
  and inhibits anti-tumor immune responses. Butyrate also indirectly promotes Treg
  differentiation by inducing IECs to secrete TGF-β. High concentrations of TGF-β
  inhibit the expression of IL-23R and promote the differentiation of Tregs. TGF-β
  also induces RORγt to be expressed together with Foxp3 in CD4+ T cells, which in
  turn inhibits RORγt, leading to differentiation of Tregs. Microbial metabolites
  SCFA and PSA can promote the proliferation of induced regulatory T cells (iTregs);
  however, too many iTregs infiltrating tumor tissue will weaken cancer immunity.
  PD-L1 can also promote the conversion of Tregs to iTregs by increasing the expression
  of Foxp3 and PTEN, or by inhibiting the Akt/mTOR pathway
