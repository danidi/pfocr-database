caption: Platelets promote the EMT of breast cancer cell via surface integrin α2β1-mediated
  direct contacting. Surface integrin α2β1 mediated the direct contact between the
  MCF-7 cells and the platelet and promotes the activation of Wnt-β-catenin signaling
  pathway in MCF-7 cells. The activated Wnt-β-catenin signaling enhances the transcription
  of tgfb1, thereby promotes TGF-β1 secretion and the activation of the TGF-β1/pSmad3
  pathway. Both β-catenin and the interaction of β-catenin and pSmad3 enhance the
  transcription of Snail and Slug, which are critical for the expression of EMT markers,
  thus promoting breast cancer metastasis
