caption: 'LTP and LTD: Schematic of molecular mechanisms. (A) The induction of canonical
  forms of both LTP and LTD is triggered by activation of the NMDA class of glutamate
  receptor. This ionotropic receptor detects the coincidence of presynaptic and strong
  postsynaptic activity by a mechanism that involves both the binding of transmitter
  and depolarization-induced repulsion of the Mg2+ ions that block its ionophore at
  near-resting membrane potentials. In its unblocked state Ca2+ ions are able to permeate
  the channel, gaining access to Ca2+-dependent processes in the spine and triggering
  synaptic plasticity. (B) Ca2+ binds to Ca2+/calmodulin which, in turn activates
  numerous kinases and phosphatases, including CaMKII, PKC and Calcineurin (PP2B)
  directly and PKA and PP1 indirectly. The balance of kinase and phosphatase activity
  depends on the concentration and temporal profile of the postsynaptic Ca2+ transient
  (including Ca2+ released from intracellular stores). The Ca2+ transient determines
  the polarity of the induced plasticity, with low and prolonged Ca2+ transients inducing
  LTD and brief, steeper transients inducing LTP. (C) One means by which LTP is expressed
  is through phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor
  that mediates baseline chemical transmission at excitatory synapses in the CNS.
  Phosphorylation by CaMKII enhances the conductance of these channels. LTD, by contrast,
  results, in part, from the dephosphorylation of the AMPA receptor by phosphatases.
  (D) Trafficking of AMPA receptors plays a major role in the expression of LTP and
  LTD by increasing or decreasing the number of receptors in the postsynaptic membrane.
  (E) Presynaptic mechanisms leading to a sustained increase in the probability of
  transmitter release also contribute to the expression of LTP. The relative contributions
  of pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms may vary at different times after induction
  and also across different classes of synapse. Since induction of LTP and LTD is
  controlled by the post-synaptic NMDA receptor, any presynapic component of expression
  requires a retrograde messenger that can signal to the pre-synaptic terminal that
  coincidence has occurred. Two candidates are nitric oxide (NO) and endocannabinoids
  (EC). (F) A second form of LTD that has been much studied is dependent on group
  1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). Glutamate binding to this receptor initiates
  a signal cascade, involving the breakdown of the membrane lipid PIP2 by phospholipase
  C (PLC) to the important signaling molecules IP3, which releases Ca2+ from Ca2+
  stores (not shown) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which leads to the activation of the
  calcium sensitive kinase PKC. This enzyme then phosphorylates the AMPA receptor
  but in such a manner that the conductance is reduced. An offshoot is the production
  of NO. (G) Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a complicated role in
  both LTP and LTD and contributes in different ways to short-term and long-term plasticity.
  (H) Longer-lasting ‘late'' forms of LTP and LTD, persisting for more than a few
  hours, require the synthesis of new proteins, either through novel gene transcription
  or through initiation of local translation of existing transcripts. Novel gene expression
  requires signaling to the nucleus from newly potentiated or depressed synapses.
  A major player in this process is the cAMP-dependent signaling cascade initiated
  by calcium influx and involving adenylyl cyclase (AC) and cAMP-dependent kinase
  (PKA), which also acts directly on the AMPA receptor in LTP expression. Catecholaminergic
  modulatory input plays a major role in determining the longevity of LTP and LTD,
  through interaction with AC which increases levels of cAMP and thereby activates
  PKA. PKA then sets in action a chain of signals that leads to the expression of
  new transcripts which, in turn are translated into proteins contributing to the
  long-term expression of synaptic plasticity. This signaling pathway has been a major
  recent target of attempts to find nootropic substances. (I) There are parallel signaling
  pathways, involving mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK), that also result in
  the synthesis of new proteins. However, in this case existing transcripts are locally
  translated into proteins, without further requirement for nuclear signaling. The
  MAPK pathway is strongly implicated in mGluR-dependent LTD. (J) One newly synthesized
  protein that acts as a maintenance mechanism for late LTP is PKMζ. This remarkable
  kinase comprises the active subunit of PKM, an isoform of PKC, that is now known
  to maintain the presence of AMPA receptors inserted during LTP induction, and thereby
  maintain LTP. Inhibition of this kinase can erase LTP and memory many days after
  induction. (K) Finally, BDNF can also play a second role in synaptic plasticity,
  as a newly synthesized product that alters the structure of the synapse to enforce
  long-term changes in synaptic strength.'
