caption: Proposed molecular model of VCAM-1 regulation in ccRCC-VHL–expressing cells.
  IKKα and IKKβ hydroxylation by active PHDs in normoxic (Nx) conditions allows VHL
  binding to IKKs. VHL-dependent regulation of IKKα promotes the noncanonical pathway,
  whereas regulation of IKKβ represses the canonical pathway. Alternatively, an upstream
  regulation of the noncanonical pathway might occur after PHD direct hydroxylation
  of NIK. These events regulate transcriptional effectors of the noncanonical pathway
  (p52–Rel B) that ultimately lead to the up-regulation of VCAM-1 in normoxia. VCAM-1
  increase in the ccRCC cell membrane promotes binding to monocytes VLA-4 (α4β1 integrin)
  and activates their antitumoral effects. In the absence of VHL or in hypoxia, this
  pathway is nonfunctional, and VCAM-1 transcriptional induction is repressed. Black
  arrows indicate previously published data. Gray arrows indicate the proposed model
  based on results from this paper.
