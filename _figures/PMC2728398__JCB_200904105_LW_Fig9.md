caption: Cross talk between the p53 and p16 pathways through DDR. Although oncogenic
  Ras signaling has a potential to activate p16Ink4a gene expression, this effect
  is initially counteracted by an elevation of DNMT1 level and thereby causes a strong
  proliferative burst, resulting in the accumulation of DNA damage. The accumulation
  of DNA damage activates ROS production, which in turn blocks DNMT1 gene expression,
  thereby causing epigenetic derepression of p16Ink4a gene expression and thus senescence
  cell cycle arrest. This pathway is counterbalanced by the p53 pathway because p53
  is immediately activated by DNA damage and blocks proliferation of damaged cells
  that cause further accumulation of DNA damage. Thus, the DDR pathway activating
  p16Ink4a expression is accelerated in the event of p53 inactivation.
