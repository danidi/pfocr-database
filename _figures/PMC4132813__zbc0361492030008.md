caption: 'A model depicting the role of the PP1α signaling pathway in coordinating
  the activation of BRD4 and P-TEFb for inducible gene expression. Top: (1) in the
  absence of external signals, almost all BRD4 is locked up in nucleosomes containing
  histone modifications of H4K5ac/K8ac and H3S10ph. H3S10ph prevents HDAC from deacetylating
  H4K5ac/K8ac, thereby prohibiting the inappropriate activation of BRD4 (2). Upon
  stimulation, the external signals (left) trigger the activation of PP1α, which in
  association with partner A, dephosphorylates H3S10ph (3). Subsequently, the signal-activated
  HDAC1/2/3 deacetylate H4K5ac/K8ac, which leads to BRD4 release from chromatin. Bottom:
  (1) meanwhile, the signal-activated phosphatase PP2B induces a conformational change
  in the inactive 7SK complex to expose CDK9 T186ph (2). Consequently, PP1α with partner
  B is able to dephosphorylate CDK9 at Thr186, thereby liberating P-TEFb from the
  inactive 7SK complex () (3). Through selective association with the transcriptionally
  active form of P-TEFb that has its CDK9 T-loop re-phosphorylated by unknown kinase(s),
  (4) the released BRD4 mediates the recruitment of P-TEFb to the promoter-proximal
  region to enhance the processivity of RNA Pol II for productive elongation.'
