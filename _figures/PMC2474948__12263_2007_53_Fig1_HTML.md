caption: Integration of the TGFβ1 apoptotic signal by the lipid oxidation end-product
  4-hydroxynonenal. TGFβ1 induces apoptosis in epithelial cells through up-regulation
  of redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as AP-1. This signal may be mediated
  by either a Smad-dependent or a Smad-independent pathway, which in turn involves
  activation of JNK signaling. A mechanism is suggested whereby arachidonic acid oxidation
  products, such as HNE, may contribute to enhancing TGFβ1-induced apoptotis. Besides
  JNK-mediated transduction, HNE acts on Smad proteins, thereby strengthening this
  pathway. HNE interaction with the Smad pathway can enhance and sustain JNK signaling
  through a positive loop. This convergence of signals results in an amplification
  of TGFβ1-induced apoptotis. AA arachidonic acid; HNE 4-hydroxynonenal; ROS reactive
  oxygen species; SAPK/JNK stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  ATF-2 activating transcription factor-2; TGF-β1 transforming growth factor-beta1;
  SBE STAT (Signal Transduction and Activator of Transcription) binding site
