caption: Schematic representation of cGAS-STING and TLR9 signaling in response to
  the recognition of host-derived self-DNA as a DAMP. The entry of the self-DNA in
  the cytosol due to mitochondrial damage, nuclear damage, exosome-derived DNA, and
  the phagocytosis of dead cell does not remain as hidden from cytosolic PRRs. The
  cGAS identifies them as a potent DAMP in the cytosol and catalyze the cGAMP formation.
  The cellular exposure to the ionic radiations also induces cytosolic levels of chromatin
  DNA, which is also recognized by cGAS as a DAMP. The cGAMP is recognized by downstream
  signaling molecule called STING located in ER. STING activation phosphorylates TBK1
  that further activates or phosphorylates IRF3. IRF3 stimulates IRF3 target genes,
  including ISGs, which also include type 1 IFN. Also, STING activation activates
  NF-κB target pro-inflammatory genes for cytokines and chemokines. Hence, cGAS-STING
  signaling plays a crucial role in inflammation, cancer, auto-inflammation and ADs.
  The cGAMP recognition by STING also induces its autophagosome-mediated degradation.
  The p62 is an endogenous negative regulator of the STING and induces its autophagic
  degradation. BECN1 is also an endogenous cGAS inhibitor and their interaction removes
  Rubicon (an autophagy inhibitor) from the BECN1 that induces autophagy to remove
  cytosolic DNA. Hence, autophagy serves to remove cytosolic DNA without inducing
  inflammatory damage. Failure of autophagy increases inflammatory recognition of
  cytosolic DNAs by different cytosolic PRRs. On the other hand TLR9 is present in
  the ER during resting stages as soon as cytosolic CpG DNAs or host DNA enter into
  the endosome or endolysosomes TLR9 also migrates there and recognizes them as a
  crucial DAMP. TLR9 activation induces MyD88-dependent downstream signaling pathway
  to activate IRF3-based type 1 IFN production and NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory
  cytokine generation to cause inflammation and inflammatory diseases. MyD88 has a
  TIR domain and death domain (DD). The TIR domain of MyD88 activates interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) and IRAK-1. IRAK-4 subsequently recruits TRAF6
  to activate transforming growth factor-β associated kinase 1 (TAK1). TAK1 is linked
  to TRAF6 via TAB2 adaptor protein, whereas TAB1 adaptor protein interacts constitutively
  with TAK1 and induces TAK1 kinase activity. TAK1 then phosphorylates IκB kinase
  (IKK) complex through K63-linked ubiquitination of NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator),
  an IκB kinase regulatory subunit that is critical for the NF-κB, IRF3, and MAPK
  signaling.
