caption: Mechanism of MAPK inhibitor-induced resistance in melanoma and its reversal
  with inhibition of mTOR catalytic activity. (A) Activated RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway
  in NRAS- and BRAF-mutant melanomas promotes cell proliferation (Prolif) in conjunction
  with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Both pathways may exert homeostatic control over
  MITF levels by regulating its post-translational modification and nuclear (green)
  levels. Transcription of MITF may be regulated by PGC1α, independent of the MAPK
  pathway. (B) In MAPKi-resistant melanomas, inhibition of activated MAPK pathway
  by a BRAFV600 inhibitor (BRAFi) or a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) increases nuclear levels
  of MITF, which in turn induces the expression of PGC1α, an activator of mitochondrial
  regulatory genes (Mito Reg Genes), resulting in elevated oxidative phosphorylation
  (OxPhos) represented by blue mitochondria. These inhibitors also activate MITF transcription
  by an unknown (?) mechanism. Elevated OxPhos inhibits mitochondrial apoptotic pathways
  and prevents BRAFi/MEKi-induced cell death. (C) An mTOR catalytic inhibitor (mTOR1/2i)
  that inhibits both complexes I and II of mTOR decreases nuclear levels of MITF and
  inactivates BRAFi/MEKi-induced PGC1α expression. This sensitizes melanoma cells
  to BRAFi/MEKi-induced cell death. In the above schematics, continuous lines represent
  direct effects; discontinuous lines, indirect effects; thick lines and bold font,
  increased activity; red and purple colors, BRAFi/MEKi- and mTOR1/2i-induced effects,
  respectively.
