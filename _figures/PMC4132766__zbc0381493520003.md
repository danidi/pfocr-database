caption: Metabolic pathways from glucose and Gln to PA. Glucose is converted into
  lipids via two pathways. The first pathway is the conversion of the glycolytic intermediate
  DHAP to G3P by G3P dehydrogenase (GPDH). G3P is then fatty acylated, first to LPA
  by G3P acyltransferase (GPAT) and then to PA by LPAAT. The second pathway utilizes
  the end product of glycolysis, pyruvate. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA, which
  condenses with oxaloacetate to form citrate. Citrate leaves the mitochondria and
  is then converted back to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA, which is then used to synthesize
  the fatty acids that will be used to acylate G3P and generate PA. With the exit
  of citrate from the TCA cycle, there is a need for anaplerotic replenishment of
  the carbon provided by citrate. This is provided by the conditionally essential
  amino acid Gln, which enters the TCA cycle by being deaminated to glutamate and
  then to α-ketoglutarate by transamination. Via the TCA cycle, most of the Gln is
  converted to malate and then to pyruvate to generate NADPH for fatty acid synthesis.
  Gln can also go from malate to oxaloacetate where it can then condense with acetyl-CoA
  derived from glucose to form citrate and then fatty acids as above. Gln can also
  be reductively carboxylated to isocitrate and then converted to citrate in a reverse
  TCA cycle reaction of isocitrate dehydrogenase. In the absence of Gln, glucose cannot
  be converted to fatty acid synthesis.
