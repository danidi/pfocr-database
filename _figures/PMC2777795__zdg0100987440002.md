caption: Negative-feedback loop linking NAD+/SIRT1 with the Clock network. NAMPT,
  the rate-limiting enzyme in NAD biosynthesis, oscillates in a circadian pattern
  under the transcriptional control of the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer. Alterations in
  NAMPT drive oscillation in NAD biosynthesis, which in turn modulates the nutrient
  responsive deacetylase SIRT1. SIRT1 plays an important role in energy homeostasis
  and has recently been discovered to function in the control of the circadian clock.
  SIRT1 activity, dependent on the metabolic state of the cell, inhibits CLOCK:BMAL1
  activity and prevents the transcription of both circadian and metabolic downstream
  target genes. The CLOCK:BMAL1-NAMPT-SIRT1 pathway comprises a novel metabolic feedback
  that may integrate the daily cycles of activity, feeding, and energy homeostasis.
