caption: PAKs activated by extracellular signals participate in various signaling
  networks. PAK activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by phosphorylating
  Raf1 in addition to nuclear factor κB (NFκB). PAKs also phosphorylates a number
  of regulators of the cytoskeleton such as myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), LIM
  domain kinase (LIMK), filamin A, integrin linked kinase (ILK), merlin, Arpc1b, tubulin
  co-factor B (TCoB) and stathmin (OP18). In addition, PAKs regulate survival and
  apoptotic pathways through phosphorylation of its effectors such as dynein light
  chain 1 (DLC1), BimL and the pro-apoptotic protein BAD. On translocation to the
  nucleus, PAK directly affect gene transcription. Several transcription factors and
  transcriptional co-regulators such as FKHR, SHARP, C-terminal binding protein 1
  (CTBP1) and Snail homologue 1 (SNAI1) are substrates to PAK1. PAK1 co-ordinates
  transcription, splicing and translation by phosphorylating Poly C-binding protein
  1 (PCBP 1). PAKs also regulate cell cycle progression through phosphorylation of
  histone H3, Aurora A and polo like kinase 1(PlK1).
