caption: Novel connections of ethylene signal transduction pathway in Arabidopsis.
  The ethylene receptors comprising subfamily I (ETR1, ERS1) and II (ETR2, ERS2, EIN4)
  act redundantly, but also differentially, and activate a negative CTR1 protein kinase
  in the ER in the absence of C2H4. Arabidopsis RTE1 promotes ETR1 function at the
  membrane. EIN2 appears to act at the same ER membrane, but genetically works downstream
  of CTR1, implicating an assembly function of the receptor–CTR1 complex. CTR1 phosphorylates
  EIN2 and modulates other regulatory factors perhaps MAPKinases in the absence of
  C2H4. Upon ethylene signaling, the negative function of the hormone receptor–CTR1
  complex is inactivated. A portion of this process includes proteasome-dependent
  degradation of ETR2 protein. EIN2C is cleaved from EIN2 at ER or Golgi and moves
  into the nucleus in the presence of C2H4. The nuclear EIN2C then activates EIN3
  dependent gene transcription through a unknown mechanism. Concurrently, MKK9–MPK3,6
  cascade is activated in the presence of C2H4. Both EIN2 and EIN3 protein stability
  is respectively under the regulation of ETP1, ETP2 and EBF1, EBF2 F-box proteins
  in E3 ligase complexes that are coupled with 26S proteasome activity. EIN3 accumulation
  in the nucleus initiates the early transcription and some of these early gene products
  trigger the secondary transcription. EIN5 indirectly regulates EIN3 stability through
  mRNA regulation of EBFs.
