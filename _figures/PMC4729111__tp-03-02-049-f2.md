caption: Metabolic pathway of l-Phe. The primary pathway (blue box) is the catalytic
  conversion of l-phe to l-Tyr by phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). In phenylketonuria
  (PKU), the deficiency of PAH enzyme leads to the production of phenylketones by
  an alternative pathway (red box). A third pathway (green box) can be found in plants
  and yeast involving the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL).
