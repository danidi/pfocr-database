caption: A Model for the Signaling Pathway that Regulates Nucellus, Endosperm, and
  Endothelium Development after Fertilization.Black and red arrows indicate functional
  and transcriptional relationships, respectively. Solid and dashed arrows indicate
  direct and unknown regulations, respectively. The endothelium (yellow), endosperm
  (blue), and nucellus (orange) tissues are shown in color. PAB, proanthocyanidin
  biosynthesis; CD, cell division; CE, cell elongation; G, growth.
