caption: 'The Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP). (A) Pathway diagram of the methyl and
  carbonyl branches of the WLP (note: H2 is not directly used as a reductant). (B)
  Genetic representation of the WLP cluster I (formate dehydrogenase), cluster II
  (methyl branch), and cluster III (carbonyl branch). Lines denote contiguous sequences,
  while the absence of a line represents a discontinuous operon. The numbers represent
  the protein-encoding gene (peg) numbers generated by RAST. Consecutive numbers are
  synonymous with contiguous sequences. (C) Gene arrangement of cluster I of the Wood-Ljungdahl
  pathway. The formate dehydrogenase subunits are denoted in purple. (D) Phylogenetic
  tree of formate dehydrogenases from Acetobacterium spp. and closely related proteins.
  Four distinct FDH branches are highlighted, corresponding to the four types of FDH
  cluster I.'
