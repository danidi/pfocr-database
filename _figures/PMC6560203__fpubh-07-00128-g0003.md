caption: Hydrogen sulfide interaction and effects upon the activity of its biological
  targets. (A) In a physiological concentrations, H2S can either activate or inhibit
  different ion channels, providing a cytoprotective effect to the cell. (B) By inducing
  an increment of intracellular calcium, H2S induces the translocation of CSE to the
  mitochondria, resulting in the generation of H2S. In parallel, the H2S-mediated
  S-sulfhydration of the mitochondrial alpha subunit of ATP synthase, allows the augmentation
  of cAMP levels. This results in the increase of mitochondrial ATP production. Moreover,
  H2S can also inhibit PDE activity, allowing the increase of cAMP and cGMP net levels,
  thereby conferring vasodilatory and anti-proliferative properties (C) If, on the
  one hand, H2S seems to be able to prevent MAPK activation, on the other hand it
  increases the levels of other kinases, including PI3K/Akt, and protein kinase C,
  some of which can inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (D) The
  H2S-induced S-sulfhydration of Keap 1 induces the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus
  leading to the expression of ARE, which results in the augmentation of antioxidant
  responses. Moreover, H2S can induce NF-κB activation or inhibition. This depends
  upon the stage of underlying inflammation. ARE, antioxidant response elements; ,
