caption: Summary of Kit/Kitl signaling during spermatogenesis. The c-kit+ PGCs lose
  c-kit expression and turn into the undifferentiated Spg which characteristically
  express Plzf, Nanos, Bcl6b, Oct3/4, neurogenin3 and Sox3. Most of those undifferentiated
  Spg will go into c-kit- mitotic arrest (G0/G1 stage) under control of meiosis-inhibiting
  factor Cyp26b1. Undifferentiated Spg arrested during mitosis can return to normal
  spermatogenesis triggered by various differentiation signals. The lack of c-kit
  negative mitotic arrest disorders will lead to teratomas. RA, FSH and BMP4 may facilitate
  Spg differentiation as well as the activation of the Kit/Kitl signal pathway. Active
  RA acts on Sertoli cells through the RARα to stimulate the synthesis of growth factors
  Kitl, which bind to Kit to activate kit/Kitl/PI3K pathway. ALK3, receptor of BMP4,
  is specifically expressed in the mitotic Spg during the first week after birth.
  BMP4 action is mediated by a rapid nuclear translocation of Smad4 and Smad5 which
  make the Spg start to express c-kit. Mutations of c-kit (resulting in self-activation
  of Kit) at post-migration stage of Spg will cause bilateral testicular germ cell
  tumors. Differentiated Spg will go into meiosis after the activation of Kit/Kitl
  signaling. Dazl is a competence factor for meiosis initiation and germ cells start
  to express Stra8, Dmc1 and Sycp3 once get into meiosis.
