caption: Pathway analysis of MBI600-tomato interactions. Log2 fold changes of gene
  expression level mapped onto several KEGG pathways– by R package “Pathview”. Data
  included the qPCR estimates of all genes that were analyzed at 15 days-old tomato
  seedlings tissue (see Fig.  and Fig. ). Target genes are described as boxes that
  have been divided into three sections and colored according to time points 2, 6
  and 24 hpa and Log2FC scale respectively. Each gene consists of two boxes, the upper
  one refers to flg22 treatment while the lower to MBI600 CFCF treatment. The full
  names of genes are listed in Supplementary Table .
