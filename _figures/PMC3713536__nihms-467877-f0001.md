caption: The three major reactions of the protein C pathway, depicted from left to
  right, are protein C activation, the anticoagulant protein C pathway, and the cytoprotective
  protein C pathway. (left) Protein C activation. Physiological activation of protein
  C (PC) by the thrombin (IIa)-thrombomodulin (TM) complex on the surface of endothelial
  cells is facilitated by EPCR. (middle) The anticoagulant protein C pathway. APC
  exerts its anticoagulant activities by proteolytic inactivation of FVa and FVIIIa
  aided by PS on negatively charged phospholipid membranes. (right) The cytoprotective
  protein C pathway. APC associated with EPCR cleaves PAR1 to initiate cell signalling
  with cytoprotective effects that may include anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic
  activities, altered gene expression profiles, and barrier protective effects.
