caption: Mitochondrial metabolite in immune cells. (A) Succinate is an intermediate
  produced during TCA cycle in mitochondria and can secrete to the extracellular space
  when mitochondrial function is disturbed. Extracellular succinate enhances antigen-specific
  activation of helper T cells through GPR91 of DCs. (B) Glycolysis is a metabolic
  pathway that provides intermediates for energy generation. The induction of glycolysis
  by TLR ligands promotes IL-1β gene expression by succinate-mediated stabilization
  of HIF-1α in macrophages. In addition, high concentrations of glucose increase IL-1β
  secretion in an NLRP3-dependent mechanism. However, the concise mechanism by which
  activation of glycolysis-TCA cycle contributes in activation of inflammasome is
  still unclear. HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
