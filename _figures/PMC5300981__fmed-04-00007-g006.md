caption: 'Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NFκB signaling pathway. The secretion of damage-associated-molecular-patterns
  (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated-molecular-patterns (PAMPs) from injured hepatocytes
  and bacterial translocation due to chronic liver injury stimulates inflammatory
  processes through a TLR4-NFκB mechanism predominantly on Kupffer cells. TLR4 stimulation
  activates the canonical NFκB signaling pathway: the subunit IκB is phosphorylated
  by the NEMO-complex liberating the p50–p65 NFκB dimer. Then, the NFκB dimer is translocated
  to the nucleus where it binds to RNA response elements to promote the transcription
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, reactive oxygen species, and reactive
  nitrogen species contributing to global liver injury.'
