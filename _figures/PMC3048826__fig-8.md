caption: Hsp72 regulates oxidative stress-induced HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation
  and release. Upon stimulation with oxidative stress (i.e., H2O2), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathways are activated to trigger potential acetylation
  of HMGB1. On the other hand, oxidative stress also induces nuclear translocation
  of Hsp72, which directly or indirectly interacts with various nuclear proteins (such
  as HMGB1 and histone deacetylase-1 [HDAC1]) within the nucleus. The Hsp72-facilitated
  potential recruitment of HDAC1 to HMGB1 may consequently prevent HMGB1 acetylation,
  cytoplasmic translocation, and subsequent release via the secretory lysosome pathway.
  Hsp70 inhibits apoptosis downstream of cytochrome c release and with LAMP-2A drives
  chaperone-mediated autophagy. (For interpretation of the references to color in
  this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article at
