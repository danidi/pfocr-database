caption: 'A, Transcription initiation pathway. Core RNA polymerase (RNAP; gray oval,
  with active site depicted as a circle) binds to a promoter specificity σ initiation
  factor (1 of many) that directs the resulting holo RNAP to a subset of promoters.
  In Escherichia coli, the primary σ70 factor consists of separate domains (numbered
  1– 4); domains 2 and 4 recognize the −10 and −35 elements of “housekeeping” promoters
  to form a closed promoter complex, RPc, in which the double-stranded DNA is loosely
  bound on the surface of RNAP. In RPI1, the first intermediate along the pathway,
  DNA strand separation initiates around the −11 position (relative to the transcription
  start site). Melting propagates toward the active site (as shown in RPI2, but additional
  complexes also may exist). In the final, transcription-competent open promoter complex
  (RPo; boxed), the transcription bubble encompasses the +1 position. B, Order-of-addition
  experiments. Fidaxomicin (FDX; at 50 µM) was added to the in vitro transcription
  reaction with the E. coli RNAP at different points. The fraction of synthesized
  RNA was measured (as percentage of transcription in the absence of the antibiotic).
  Inhibition of the reaction was observed when FDX was added before steps 1 and 2,
  but not 3 or 4, after formation of the RPo. Abbreviations: [α32P]GTP, α-radiolabeled
  GTP; ApU, Adenylyl (3′-5′) uridine; ApUpC32pG, tetranucleotide reaction product;
  CTP, cytidine triphosphate; FDX, fidaxomicin; GTP, guanidine triphosphate; RPo★,
  open complex stabilized by the addition of a dinucleotide primer ApU.'
