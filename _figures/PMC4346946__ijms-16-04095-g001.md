caption: Nuclear entry of Cofilin-1 (CFL-1) via various stresses. (A) CFL-1 can bind
  G-actin and translocate to the nucleus to form actin rods by different exogenous
  and endogenous stresses. 1. 10% DMSO treatment; 2. Increase of G-actin concentration;
  3. Neural degenerative diseases; 4. Heat shock stress; 5. ATP depletion. This action
  may avoid energy expenditure and promote chromatin remodeling via actin; (B) Enforced
  expression of CFL-1 can also occur in the nucleus. In this situation, phosphorylated
  CFL-1 is also detectable in nucleus, while the mechanism of nuclear entry of phospho-CFL-1
  remains unclear. Because LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) and LMK2 are responsible for CFL-1
  phosphorylation in various cell types, the subcellular location of these kinases
  would determine the mechanisms of nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated CFL-1 and
  regulate actin dynamics in the cytosol and nucleus.
