caption: Regulatory T (Treg) cells modulate CD8 T‐cell exhaustion, but the programmed
  cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) pathway determines viral control. (a) During chronic
  lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, Treg cells prevent the activation
  of conventional CD4 T cells and dendritic cells (DCs), resulting in immune exhaustion
  by lack of co‐stimulatory signals. (b) Following Treg cell depletion, conventional
  CD4 T cells and DCs are re‐activated, inducing the rescue of exhausted LCMV‐specific
  CD8 T cells. However, Treg cell depletion also results in inflammation and increased
  systemic interferon levels. This is associated with PD‐L1 up‐regulation on infected
  cells. High PD‐L1 levels on infected target cells act as a potent ‘shield’ that
  prevents elimination by the rescued CD8 T‐cell response. (c) PD‐L1 blockade after
  Treg cell depletion allows the rescued CD8 T‐cell response to eliminate virally
  infected cells.
