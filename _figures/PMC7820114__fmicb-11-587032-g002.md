caption: 'Metabolic and transcriptomic changes within the Entner-Doudoroff pathway
  and the gluconeogenesis during growth of S. solfataricus P2 on phenol Relative metabolite
  concentrations (squares) were expressed as fold-changes compared to the reference
  D-glucose. Transcript abundance (solid circles) and flux distributions (dashed circles)
  were expressed as Log2 fold-changes compared to the reference D-glucose. Asterisks:
  Data are only available under glucose conditions. Hash: Data are only available
  under phenol conditions. Dotted arrows indicate multiple enzymatic reactions. KDG,
  2-keto-3-deoxygluconate. This pathway is available at MetaboMAPS (accession: P101).'
