caption: Increased Flux in Folate Metabolism in Response to Chloroquine. Illustration
  of folate metabolism reactions showing increases in flux levels in both chloroquine-treated
  models versus untreated models. We predict a shift in 4-aminobenzoate acquisition
  between short- and long-term chloroquine treatment, and elevated flux through all
  downstream steps of folate metabolism. Clinically available drugs target this pathway
  (sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine, indicated in red). Both enzymes targeted by these
  antimalarials (dihydropteroate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase) carry increased
  flux in both models of short- and long-term chloroquine treatment. Connectivity
  to other metabolic pathways are shown (dotted lines)
