caption: A. According to our results we propose an endothelial linage of the ES cell-of-origin
  where bFGF/VEGF are specially active and, upon binding to their receptors, activate
  a signaling cascade that transmits a nuclear signal prompting target genes to activate
  cell growth. As reporter for an endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) characteristic
  biology, proapoptotic genes remain inactive in cells with low NF-κB levels tightly
  controlled by RING1B in ES cells. B. Similar to EPC when treated with antiangiogenic
  factors, RING1B depletion in ES cells results in NF-κB activation, which binds to
  proapoptotic gene promoters and/or displaces transcription factors from prosurvival
  gene promoters. In this situation ES cells are highly sensitive to FGF/SHP2/STAT3
  blockade (adapted from []).
