caption: IFN-I response and signaling pathways in malaria parasite infections. Parasite
  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as DNA and RNA are recognized
  by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on the membrane of endosomes, including TLR7, TLR9,
  and possibly TLR8, and activate MYD88-TRAF6-IRF7 signaling cascade to stimulate
  production of IFN-Is. In the cytosol, parasite RNA is sensed by MDA5 (maybe RIG-I
  too) leading to the activation of MAVS-TBK1-IRF3 signaling and IFN-I production.
  Parasite DNA in the cytosol is sensed by cGAS, resulting in the activation of STING-TBK1-IRF3
  signaling pathway to produce IFN-Is. On the cell surface, glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  (GPI) might be recognized by TLR4 and/or TLR1/2 that activates MYD88-TRAF6-IRF7
  and TRIF-TBK1-IRF3 pathways to produce IFN-Is. Hemozoin (Hz) can form a complex
  with DNA and be recognized by TLR9 or with host fibrinogen and recognized by TLR4.
  Hz itself can also be sensed by NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3). However,
  recognition of Hz by these receptors mostly leads to the production of the proinflammatory
  cytokines. Many molecules (in light blue or light pink) are regulators that have
  been shown to inhibit IFN-I responses in vitro. The roles of CD40, FOSL1, MARCH1,
  and RTP4 in regulating IFN-I responses were further demonstrated in vivo during
  malaria parasite and/or viral (RTP4) infections. These regulators either can increase
  (CD40 in red) or decrease (FOSL1, MARCH1, and RTP4 in purple) IFN-I production through
  phosphorylation and/or ubiquitination of proteins in the IFN-I response pathways.
  The IFN-Is secreted by the cells bind to the IFNAR to activate the STAT1/STAT2-IRF9
  pathway leading to transcription of ISGs that either directly act on parasites or
  modulate host immune responses. Infection of Ifnar1-/ - mice will affect downstream
  IFN-I signaling but may not influence (and possibly stimulate) IFN-Is production.
