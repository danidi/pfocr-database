caption: 'Figure 5. Trio in cell adhesion. (A) Trio is activated by binding to adhesive
  receptors, such as cadherins and integrins of the ICAM family and thereby participates
  to several cell adhesion-mediated physiological processes, mainly through Rac1 activation
  and actin cytoskeleton remodeling. (B) Trio impinges on adhesive receptor expression
  at the transcriptional level through Rac1 activation. Left panel: Trio-mediated
  Rac1 signaling induces the phosphorylation of the transcriptional repressor Tbx3,
  leading to a decrease in E-cadherin expression. Tara upregulates E-cadherin transcription,
  by inhibiting Trio. Right panel: Trio regulates a novel pro-inflammatory pathway
  during transendothelial migration by controlling the expression of VCAM-1/ICAM-1
  through Rac1-mediated activation of the transcription factor Ets2 in response to
  the cytokine TNFα.'
