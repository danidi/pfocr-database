caption: Depiction of how different NAD precursors are transported into cells via
  identified or putative transport systems in cell membranes (embedded cylindrical
  domains). As can be visualized by the figure, networks of biosynthetic pathways
  converge to two main NAD biosynthetic intermediates, namely NaMN and NMN. NAD itself
  provides an action point for several other downstream processes, including biosynthesis
  of NADP/NADPH and for signaling processes, which regenerates nicotinamide for the
  core nicotinamide recycling pathway.
