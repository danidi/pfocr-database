caption: En2 modulates IGF1’s pleiotropic effects in GNPs, potentially through altered
  S6 kinase activation. While En2 expression appeared to have no effect on IGF1 activation
  of the PI3K pathway at the level of Akt phosphorylation, the absence of En2 caused
  increased phosphorylation of S6 kinase. Thus, we propose a model in which En2 expression
  in postnatal GNPs promotes differentiation and inhibits proliferation via disruption
  of S6 kinase activation, a well-characterized promitogenic signal. Potential targets
  for En2 may include PDK1 and mTORC1, which directly phosphorylate S6K, though these
  interactions remain to be explored. Alternatively, En2 may alter feedback inhibition
  between the S6K and the PI3K pathway. Dashed lines signify indirect pathways. Arrows
  and (+) indicate activation. Flat head and (-) indicate inhibition. GNP = Granule
  neuron precursor. IGF1R = Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor. P = Phosphorylation.
