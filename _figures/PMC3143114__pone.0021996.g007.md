caption: Proposed pathway of linamarin synthesis and breakdown in cassava roots. Transgenic
  cassava overexpressing HNL leads to decrease in steady state levels of linamarin
  in roots and reductions in both acetone cyanohydrin and cyanide levels after processing.
  In addition, there is an increase in total HNL protein which ultimately leads to
  increase in total protein level in roots. Two small blue arrows indicate either
  decrease or increase levels in roots.
