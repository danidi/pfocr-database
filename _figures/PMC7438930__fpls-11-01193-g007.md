caption: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to electron transport in the
  light reaction of photosynthesis in the chloroplast at time point 2 h (A) and 5 h
  (B). The fold change was analyzed and allocated with MapMan software. Blue squares
  show the intensity of upregulation, where darker blue color indicates stronger upregulation.
  To visualize the pathway, ChloroPlast_CustomArray_CUSTOM_MAPPING 1 pathway was used.
  Stub_PGSC_DM_v3.4 was utilized for mapping as this mapping file represents the reference
  genome used for the sequencing. Both pathway and mapping were obtained from the
  MapMan website and are available through the Creative Common (CC) license. NDH complex
  is not covered by the pathway.
