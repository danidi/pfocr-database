caption: The bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a well-studied example of a pathogen
  manipulating host PAK1 signalling. (A) Upon infection of human epithelial cells,
  H. pylori activates Rac1 and stimulates recruitment of PAK1 to active Rac1 in a
  T4SS-dependent manner (pathway 1). H. pylori also induces interaction between PAK1
  and NIK (pathway 2). Such interaction and subsequent phosphorylation of NIK by PAK1
  have been proposed to be required for NF-κB activation in H. pylori infection [].
  Moreover, H. pylori is capable of stimulating NF-κB activation in a PAK1-dependent
  pathway through αPix (pathway 3). NF-κB activation and recruitment of PAK1 to active
  Rac1 both appear to require the T4SS, a complex macromolecular transporter and key
  virulence factor of H. pylori [] (see ). CagA, the protein cargo of T4SS, has been
  shown to form a complex with αPix during H. pylori infection []. The T4SS is shown
  in red. Phosphorylation is indicated by the symbol “p”. Proteins identified to interact
  with PAK1 in H. pylori-infected epithelial cells are shown in yellow. (B) Upon stimulation
  of the human macrophage cell line, THP-1, purified H. pylori LPS can induce IL-1β
  secretion in a TLR4-dependent manner via post-translational (1) and transcriptional
  (2) pathways []. In the former pathway, H. pylori LPS stimulates Rac1 activity and
  the kinase activity of PAK1, triggering interaction of PAK1 with caspase-1 and possibly
  the subsequent phosphorylation of caspase-1 at S376 by PAK1. Phosphorylated caspase-1
  then cleaves pro-IL-1β into mature active IL-1β. H. pylori LPS can also activate
  IL-1β expression at the transcriptional level via NF-κB-activation in a manner that
  requires the kinase activities of both PAK1 and IKKβ. It has been proposed that
  the up-regulation of IL-1β expression by H. pylori LPS involves the PI3K/Rac1/PAK1
  signalling axis []. In-depth understanding of the molecular mechanism by which the
  kinase activity of PAK1 is modulated in these various pathways is warranted.
