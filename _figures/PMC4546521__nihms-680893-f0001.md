caption: The cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex. Invasion of pathogens and tissue
  damage produce inflammatory responses that are regulated in part by the cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory reflex. Endotoxins or pro-inflammatory cytokines signal through
  vagus nerve afferent fibers to the brain wherein the message is processed, resulting
  in an anti-inflammatory signal transmitted through vagus nerve efferent fibers to
  the celiac plexus. The splenic nerve then activates T-cells that express choline
  acetyltransferase (ChAT+ T-cells) in the spleen, which travel to macrophages and
  secrete ACh activating their α7 receptors. The efferent arm of the anti-inflammatory
  reflex is known as the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP). Activation of
  the α7 inhibits NF-κB by interfering with I-κB phosphorylation and NF-κB transcriptional
  activity (red lines). Activation of the α7 has been proposed to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation,
  leaving uSTAT3 available to bind NF-κB subunits p50 and p65, and avoiding their
  nuclear translocation (light green arrows). On the other hand, it has been reported
  that the anti-inflammatory effect that results from activation of α7 is due to activation
  of the Jak2/STAT3 signaling pathway (yellow arrows). In a separate work, activated
  STAT3 was shown to induce the production of tristetraprolin (TTP), which is suggested
  as mediator of the anti-inflammatory effect (blue arrow). An additional proposed
  mechanism for the cholinergic regulation of pro-inflammatory responses comprise
  the upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) mediated by the activation of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K)/Akt/Nrf-2 pathway (purple arrows)
