caption: Alternative pathway of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The alternative pathway
  is the third mechanism of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Similar to the canonical
  pathway's priming step, LPS binds to TLR4 that leads to upregulation of NLRP3 and
  pro-IL-1β through the NF-κB pathway. However, instead of the K+ efflux, NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation relies on toll/interleukin-1 receptor-domain-containing adapter-inducing
  interferon-β, receptor-interacting protein kinase 1, Fas-associated protein with
  death domain, and caspase-8 that are upregulated by the TLR4 signaling.
