caption: Diagram of immune responses induced by Leptospira sp. infection in mice.
  Known innate responses to Leptospira sp. involve neutrophils, macrophages but also
  B and T cells. Recognition of Leptospira sp. mostly occurs through the TLR2 pathway,
  sensing outer membrane proteins (OMPs) such as the lipoprotein LipL32, the major
  leptospiral OMP and the atypical LPS (), which is also recognized by toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) in mice (). Protective host responses are depicted in green on the right
  side, whereas potential unfavorable responses are in red, on the left side. In mouse
  B cells, TLR4 stimulation by leptospiral LPS leads to the early production of partially
  protective IgM (), via the TRIF adaptor (). TLR2 and TLR4 responses, through the
  Myd88 adaptor, also control the production of protective IgG (). In vivo methylation
  of LipL32 in rat has been shown to reduce its recognition by human antiserum ().
  In humans, leptospiral LPS is not recognized by TLR4 (), potentially leading to
  disease, as observed with TLR4 mutant mice (, , ). In mouse T cells, Leptospira
  interrogans signal through the MyD88-dependent activation of TLR4 and TLR2 receptors
  and trigger the production of the protective pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ that
  activates macrophages (). Both T and B cells, by sensing leptospiral components
  through an unknown receptor, are involved in the production of an unfavorable pro-inflammatory
  cytokine response (). In humans, neutrophils play a slight protective role for the
  host against Leptospira sp. infection due to the production of bactericidal neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NETs) (). Neutrophils and macrophages barely phagocytize non-opsonized
  Leptospira sp. but opsonized Leptospira sp. with specific IgG are readily killed
  by phagocytose (, ). Macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to a
  protective inflammatory state by sensing OMPs, including LipL32, via TLR2 (). The
  atypical leptospiral LPS is also detected by TLR2 and CD14, the co-receptor of TLR4
  (). Acting in concert with TLR2 and TLR4 activation, leptospiral glycoprotein blocks
  the Na/K-ATPase pump that triggers the activation of the Nod-like receptor protein
  3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and enables the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine
  IL-1β (). Upon L. interrogans infection, macrophages and other cells also produce
  nitric oxide (NO), which has a positive and a negative effect. NO has a protective
  effect through the action of its antimicrobial role () and the negative effect is
  that NO activity favors kidney fibrosis () and nephritis of infected hosts (, ).
