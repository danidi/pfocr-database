caption: Tr1 cells activate STAT1 via IFN-β and IL-10, respectively. IFN-β induces
  the transcription of TLR3 which induces the secretion of IFN-β in an autocrine and
  paracrine manner. IFN-β may lead to transcriptional activation of IDO through the
  STAT1 signaling in MSCs; however, further studies are needed to confirm the dependency
  of IDO on STAT1 signaling. Production of IL-10 by Tr1 cells leads to activation
  of the STAT1 signaling. IDO activates Treg cells and suppresses Th17 cells.
