caption: (a)Signal transduction of TNFRI. After binding of TNF, TNFRI first recruits
  TNFR associated death domain (TRADD) as a platform adaptor and assembles alternative
  signalling complexes. One complex involves receptor interacting protein (RIP) and
  TNFR associated factor 2 (TRAF2) which links ligand induced signalling to the activation
  of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP1. Another signalling complex is formed
  dependant on the internalization of activated TNF/TNFRI complexes (TNF receptosomes).
  During endocytosis FADD and caspase 8 are recruited to form the death inducing signalling
  complex (DISC) resulting in TNF-induced apoptosis. (b) Lymphotoxin beta receptor
  (LTβR) mediated NF-κB activation.Upon ligand induced activation of the LTβR two
  pathways are engaged. Activation of the IKK complex (IKKα, IKKβ, IKKγ/NEMO) and
  RelA controls the expression of inflammatory genes such as MIP-2, VCAM-1 and MIP-1β.
  The second pathway involves the activation of the NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK), which
  in turn activates IKKα for generating active p52 derived from its p100 precursor.
  Association of p52 with another partner (e.g. RelB) activates the transcription
  of genes implicated in lymphoid organogenesis and homeostasis such as SLC, BLC,
  ELC and BAFF.
