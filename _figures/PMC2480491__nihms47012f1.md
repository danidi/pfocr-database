caption: Aflatoxin B1 biosynthesis. (A) Biosynthetic pathway. PksA accepts a C6 fatty
  acid from the associated fatty acid synthase subunits (HexA/HexB) and homologates
  acetyl units while attached to either the acyl carrier protein (ACP) or ketosynthase
  (KS) to a fixed chain length (octaketide), as shown in the hypothetical intermediate
  1 (shown as the keto form), R = ACP or KS. PksA controls specific cyclization chemistry
  to release the norsolorinic acid anthrone (), which is auto-oxidized in vitro to
  norsolorinic acid (). 3 is processed through a series of oxidative rearrangements
  to aflatoxin B1 (). (B) Fungal nonreducing PKS domain architecture (PksA). Domains
  include SAT, KS, malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (MAT), PT, ACP, and thioesterase/Claisen
  cyclase (TE/CLC). Many known and apparently homologous enzymes that share similar
  domain organization synthesize an assortment of products with alternative chain
  lengths and cyclization scaffolds ().
