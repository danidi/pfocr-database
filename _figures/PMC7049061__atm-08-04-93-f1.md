  The number of occurrences of the keyword is normalized, and the standard score (also
  referred to as Z-Score) calculated by Formula 1  is taken as the Z value of the
  keyword. Z: the standard score of the number of occurrences of the keyword; χ: the
  number of occurrences of the keyword; µ: the mean of the number of occurrences;
  σ: the standard deviation of the number of occurrences.'
