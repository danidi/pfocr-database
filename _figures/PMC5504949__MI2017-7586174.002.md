caption: 'Overview of IL-6/soluble IL-6 receptor signaling at the nexus of endocrine
  function: illustrative examples. Binding of IL-6 to IL-6R and gp130 receptor complex
  leads to activation of Janus kinase- (JAK-) dependent pathways including mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), protein kinase B (AKT)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
  and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). The IL-6 signaling
  mediated via a soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) leads to binding of IL-6/sIL-6R complex
  to gp130 triggering similar intracellular pathways (adapted from [, , , ]). In the
  states of NTI (nonthyroidal illness), an increase in rT3 production is a consequence
  of increased D3-mediated T3 (and T4) clearance through activation of the MAPK pathway
  []. Stress-induced HPA axis activation and GH-induced somatotroph adenoma growth
  are mediated via the STAT3 pathway []. In bovine chromaffin cells exposed to stress,
  IL-6 leads to activation of ERK 1/2 and STAT3 pathways and consequently to increased
  activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis,
  and to upregulation of downstream targets including secreted neuropeptides galanin,
  PTH-related peptide (PTHrP), G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR), stanniocalcin-1 (STC1),
  and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) []. The signaling via gp130 regulates the
  gonadal axis via activation of ERK and MAPK pathways on multiple levels: cycle regulation
  and proliferation of GnRH cells, impaired steroidogenesis, and increased permeability
  of blood-testis barrier (BTB) (through downregulation of occludin and delocalization
  of claudin 11 and tight junction protein 1 (TJP1)) [, , ]. Bone phenotype is illustrated
  through a rodent mutation model, where JAK/STAT and the SHP2/MAPK signaling regulate
  bone turnover and closure of the growth plate []. Soluble IL-6R seems to regulate
  osteoclast development in vitro; however, its relevance in vivo is unclear [].'
