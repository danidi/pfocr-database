caption: Simplified overview of homologous recombination and non-homologous end-joining.
  Homologous recombination (HR) pathway starts with break recognition and signaling
  by a complex containing NBS1, MRE11 and RAD50 (MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 - MRN complex).
  RAD51 and RAD52 catalyze and facilitate a strand exchange reaction. Assembly of
  RAD51 is facilitated by different RAD51 paralogs such XRCC2 and XRCC3. MRN complex
  also promotes activation of ATM, which in turn activates several DNA repair factors
  as BRCA1/2. HR finishes with DNA synthesis and final ligation. Non-homologous end-joining
  (NHEJ) pathway starts with the recruitment of Ku heterodimer (Ku70 and Ku80) to
  DNA ends. Once attached to double-strand breaks, Ku recruits and stimulates the
  DNA-PKcs, forming the DNA-PK holoenzyme. DNA-PK activates XRCC4-LIG4 complex, which
  links the broken complementary DNA ends together. If DNA ends are not ready to end
  joining, it is necessary a previous DNA end processing, which may involve numerous
  enzymes as Artemis, Werner, DNA Polimerases μ e λ, Polynucleotide kinase (PNK) and
  Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), to conclude the NHEJ pathway. The role
  of MRN complex in NHEJ pathway it is still not clear.
