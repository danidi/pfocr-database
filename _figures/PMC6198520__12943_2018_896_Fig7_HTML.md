caption: Hypothetic schematic model of the underlying mechanisms of targeting G9a
  to suppress NSCLC. a Gene amplification [], hypoxia [], and/or other unknown mechanisms
  lead G9a overexpressed in cancers. G9a dimethylates H3K9, creating a binding site
  for HP1 (α, β, or γ, a structural chromosomal protein involved in transcription,
  chromatin organization, and replication as well as DNA repair), HP1 stabilizes and
  enhances the DNA methyltransferase activity of DNMT1. G9a also interacts with DNMT1,
  and then through this interaction G9a epigenetically regulates gene expression.
  In lung cancer, upregulated G9a may silence gene expression of these critical inhibitors
  of Wnt signaling pathway such as APC2, WIF1, and other tumor suppressors through
  DNA hypermethylation, resulting in overactivation of Wnt signaling pathway and enhanced
  growth. b Targeting G9a by the specific inhibitor UNC0638 down-regulates HP1α, and
  epigenetically restores expression of APC2 and other tumor suppressors through promoter
  demethylation, and then significantly inhibits Wnt signaling pathways and growth
  of NSCLC
