caption: Schematic diagram of metabolic pathways and 13C labeling patterns related
  to reverse flux through pyruvate kinase in skeletal muscle after [U-13C3]lactate
  administration. The direct conversion of [U-13C3]lactate to [U-13C3]pyruvate followed
  by reverse flux through pyruvate kinase results exclusively in [1,2,3-13C3]- and
  [4,5,6-13C3]glucose units in muscle glycogen without other labeling patterns. If
  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) formation from pyruvate occurs through a bypass (pyruvate
  → oxaloacetate → PEP) as seen in liver (, A and B), various glucose isotopomers
  including both [1,2,3-13C3]- and [4,5,6-13C3]glucose plus other distinctive labeling
  patterns such as [1,2-13C2]glucose, etc. would be observed due to rearrangements
  of 13C in the TCA cycle and pyruvate cycling. The glutamate analysis of the tissue
  showed only [4,5-13C2]-, [1,2-13C2]-, and excess [3-13C1]glutamate isotopomers.
  This informs that [U-13C3]pyruvate incorporated into the TCA cycle only through
  pyruvate dehydrogenase but not through the pyruvate carboxylase pathway. PDH, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; PK, pyruvate kinase; PC, pyruvate carboxylase; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate
