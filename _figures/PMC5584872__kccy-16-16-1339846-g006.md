caption: Model depicting RTK signaling by EGF to acetylation of ADA3 to regulate cell
  cycle progression. Activation of RTK signaling by EGF leads to phosphorylation of
  AKT, which then phosphorylates p300 to acetylate ADA3, leading to stabilization
  of ADA3 by preventing its ubiquitination, and thereby promoting cell cycle progression.
  Treatment of cells by RTK inhibitors such as lapatinib inhibits phospho-AKT and
  consequently p300 phosphorylation, which in turn prevents ADA3 acetylation leading
  to its poly-ubiquitination (Ubn) and destabilization and causes cell cycle block.
