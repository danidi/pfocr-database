caption: 'Schematic representation of proposed metabolic pathways for central carbon
  and nitrogen metabolism in Y88 during glucose growth, based on protein identifications
  (dark gray ovals) and the presence of their corresponding genes in the Y88 genome.
  Additional pathways of potential interest for possible metabolic engineering of
  desired products are also included (pink and blue boxes). Proteins that we identified
  that may be useful in these pathways are shown in these boxes. Acronyms for proteins
  not identified but encoded by genes present in the Y88 genome and required for the
  functional pathway depicted are included (light gray ovals) as are previously hypothetical
  proteins (purple ovals) that we identified in our experiments which we predict are
  associated with nitrogen fixation. Locus tags and full protein names corresponding
  to protein acronyms appearing in the figure are listed in  and in Table S3 in the
  supplemental material. Additional acronyms/abbreviations not listed in  and in Table
  S3 are as follows: AKG, alpha-ketoglutarate; beta-HBCoA, 3-hydroxybutyryl coenzyme
  A; Cit, citrate; CoA, coenzyme A; DD (E3), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3); DT
  (E2), dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2); EPS, exopolysaccharide; EINtr (PtsP), PTS
  system nitrogen regulatory enzyme I encoded by ptsP; EIIA, PTS system enzyme IIA
  component; EIIBC (fruc-like), PTS system fructose-specific enzyme IIBC components;
  EIINtr (PtsN), PTS system nitrogen regulatory enzyme II encoded by ptsN; F6P, fructose
  6-phosphate; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; FUM, fumarate; GLN, glutamine; G1P,
  glucose 1-phosphate; G3P, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate;
  ISC, isocitrate; KDPG, 2-keto-3-deoxyphosphogluconate; MAL, malate; N2ase, nitrogenase;
  GLU, glutamate; OAA, oxaloacetate; PDHc, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate;
  PK2, pyruvate kinase 2; PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system;
  SUC, succinate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; UGal, UDP-galactose; UGlu, UDP-glucose;
  2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate; 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; and 6-PG, 6-phosphogluconate.'
