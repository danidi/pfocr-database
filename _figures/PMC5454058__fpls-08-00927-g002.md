caption: Transcriptional regulatory network of proline biosynthesis as mediated by
  ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways. Water and cold stresses activate abscisic
  acid-dependent and/or –independent signaling pathways, which in turn modulate specific
  classes of TFs. CREs and TFs involved in ABA-dependent activation of proline biosynthesis
  are reported in sky blue (A), while those involved in ABA-independent pathway are
  reported in green (B). ABRE, ABA responsive elements; CE, coupling element; DRE/CRT,
  dehydration-responsive elements/C-repeat; MYBRS, MYB recognition sequences; NACRS,
  NAC recognition sequences. Proline accumulation has been reported to occur in response
  to a variety of stress conditions, under which its possible role may vary from that
  of a compatible osmolyte lowering the intracellular water potential to avoid water
  withdrawal from the apoplast (as in the case of drought and salinity, but also under
  freezing cold), to a protectant for proteins (at high ion concentration) and membranes
  (to cope with excessive salt or freezing), or an antioxidant (in response to a direct
  oxidative stress as that caused by heavy metals, or to mitigate oxidative conditions
  triggered by other stress types). As a function of these different roles, different
  cytoplasmic levels of proline are most likely needed. The presence of many CREs
  recognized by various TFs may allow a fine regulation of gene transcription and
  facilitate the attainment of a certain homeostatic level, as required to deal with
  a given stressor. Moreover, at the cellular level the effect of different stresses
  is virtually the same. For instance, cell dehydration occurs as a consequence of
  drought, excess salt in the soil, or ice crystal formation in the apoplast. The
  presence of apparently redundant regulatory networks, as the ABA-dependent and ABA-independent
  pathways, may therefore be functional to distinguish among these different stress
  conditions. However, a cross-talk between them is essential to ensure the attainment
  of a suitable response. Despite the importance of this aspect for a proper understanding
  of the plant cell reaction to stress, to date our knowledge of how the two signaling
  pathways regulate each other is still limited, or restricted to partial aspects
  (; ). The flux through one pathway may affect the other, and they might act in an
  additive or negatively regulatory way, or might compete for a target. Shared elements
  are expected to work as nodes, allowing the cross-talk. Since recent data suggest
  that high intracellular proline levels may induce in turn the catabolic pathway
  influencing mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species generation (;
  ), proline synthesis could represent one of these nodes. Further work is required
  to shed light on this possibility.
