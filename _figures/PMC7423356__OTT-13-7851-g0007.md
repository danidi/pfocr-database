caption: Scheme of the proposed mechanisms (A) The tumor microenvironment of the liver
  metastases mainly comprises of endothelial cells, macrophages, HSCs, activated HSCs
  and tumor cells. The tumor cells around the blood vessels were oxygenous, while
  those farther away from the blood vessels were in a hypoxic state. (B) Normoxic
  tumor cells secreted exosomes that carried p-ERK and p-AKT, in order to convert
  HSCs into aHSCs. The p-ERK and p-AKT signaling pathways were activated to target
  p65 to increase the secretion of IL-6. The cultured supernatant of aHSCs enhanced
  the lactate metabolism of tumor cells by activating the IL-6/STAT3 pathway and upregulating
  MCT1 and LDHB to produce ATP to confer drug resistance.
