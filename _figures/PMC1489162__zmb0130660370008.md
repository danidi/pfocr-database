caption: A proposed model for the regulation of SBP2 subcellular localization and
  function. (A) Under normal conditions, the majority of the SBP2 pool is localized
  within the cytoplasm, at ribosomal sites, where it functions as part of the Sec
  incorporation complex. SBP2 contains functional NLS that mediates its nuclear translocation
  to potentially bind SECIS-containing mRNAs. This may trigger exposure of the NES,
  which would lead to rapid nuclear export of SBP2 via the CRM1 pathway and restore
  the ribosomal steady-state levels of SBP2. (B) During oxidative stress, redox-sensitive
  cysteine residues within SBP2 become oxidized to disulfide linkages (S-S) and/or
  form glutathione-mixed disulfides (S-SG), leading to a conformational change, disrupting
  its ribosomal localization and triggering its nuclear translocation. The lack of
  sufficient reducing equivalents maintains SBP2 in an oxidized state which masks
  the NES, inhibiting its export and leading to its nuclear retention and inhibition
  of selenoprotein synthesis. (C) During the cell recovery phase, Trx and Grx relocate
  to the nucleus and reduce SBP2, leading to exposure of the NES and promoting CRM1-dependent
  nuclear export. In the cytoplasm, reassembly of SBP2-containing translationally
  active ribosomal complexes takes place and synthesis of selenoproteins can commence.
