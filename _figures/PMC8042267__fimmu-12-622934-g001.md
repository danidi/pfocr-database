caption: IL23 signaling in Crohn’s disease. IL23 is a heterodimer consisting of the
  unique subunits p19 and p40, the latter is shared with IL12. IL23 signals through
  its heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the two subunits IL12Rβ1 and IL23R
  whereas IL23R is the unique subunit and IL-12Rβ1 shares the IL12 receptor complex.
  The IL23R complex signals through JAK kinase and STAT transcription factors. IL23
  binding to its receptor activates Jak2 and Tyk2 kinases which then phosphorylates
  the receptor to form a docking site leading to the subsequent phosphorylation of
  STAT3 for the p19 subunit and STAT4 for the p40 subunit. IL23R signaling activates
  several pathways leading to transcription of several effector cytokine genes in
  CD including IL17A, IL17F and IL22.
