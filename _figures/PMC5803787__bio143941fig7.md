caption: Model for the fate decision of XY PGCs regulated by stage-specific FGF9 levels.
  Before sex differentiation at 11.5 dpc, FGF9 expression is upregulated in undifferentiated
  Sertoli cells. At 12.5-14.5 dpc, FGF9 levels are gradually decreased while testis
  differentiation progresses. The stage-specific expression of FGF9 in XY gonads regulates
  the different signaling transduction pathways in XY PGCs. High FGF9 stimulates the
  ERK1/2 signaling pathway to promote unknown genes and suppress Nanos2 expression,
  resulting in PGC proliferation. In contrast, low FGF9 enhances the p38 signaling
  pathway to induce Nanos2 expression for PGC male differentiation.
