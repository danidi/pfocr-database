caption: Proposed model on how the WWP-1/UBC-18 complex modulates both stress response
  and dietary restriction pathways. Upon DR, a signaling cascade is initiated that
  results in the ubiquitylation of KLF-1 by the WWP-1/UBC-18 E3/E2 complex. KLF-1,
  together with PHA-4 and SKN-1, launch a transcriptional response that results in
  increased longevity. In a distinct pathway, environmental stress and/or DR induces
  WWP-1/UBC-18 complex activity resulting in the ubiquitylation of an unknown substrate
  that feeds into a DAF-16 dependent signaling pathway, leading to an increased resistance
  to multiple types of stress as well as increased lifespan with some DR regimens
  (see text). The dotted line represents a possible interaction of klf-1 and pha-4.
