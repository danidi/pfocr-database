caption: NRF2- and SIRT1-signaling pathways targeted by antioxidant compounds. Under
  normal homeostatic conditions, NRF2 transcriptional activity is inhibited by KEAP1
  and PTEN. KEAP1 directly interacts with NRF2 and mediates its ubiquitination and
  subsequent proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, PTEN eliminates 3-phosphoinositides
  (PIP3) required for AKT activation, thus leading to GSK3β activation and NRF2 phosphorylation.
  In vivo antioxidants act as electrophiles that modify and inhibit KEAP1 and PTEN.
  When KEAP1 is oxidized, its interaction with NRF2 is disrupted and NRF2 half-life
  increases. Electrophiles also inhibit the redox-sensitive phosphatase PTEN, allowing
  PIP3 accumulation, AKT activation, and GSK3β inactivation. In these conditions,
  NRF2 is translocated to the nucleus where it binds to the electrophile response
  element (EpRE) and drives the expression of antioxidant defence genes. Additionally,
  antioxidant compounds modulate SIRT1 pathway favouring the antioxidant defence response
  and mitochondrial biogenesis by activation of FOXOa3 and PGC1α transcription factors,
  respectively.
