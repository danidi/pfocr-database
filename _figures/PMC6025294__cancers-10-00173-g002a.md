caption: 'JMY (Junctional Mediating and Regulating Y protein)/P53 interaction pathway.
  (A) JMY’s regulation. In unperturbed cells, JMY levels are maintained at a constant
  state by a balance between transcription and degradation. The latter is controlled
  by Mdm2 which ubiquitinates JMY leading to its degradation by proteasomes. Following
  DNA damage, the newly phosphorylated E2F1 induces increased transcription of JMY,
  while ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) dampens MDM2 activity. Furthermore, actin
  monomers form polymers and therefore are no longer available to bind to JMY and
  sequester it in the cytoplasm. Since it is no longer bound to actin monomers, JMY
  can then bind to Importin and translocate to the nucleus. This causes the levels
  of JMY in the nucleus to increase and form a complex with P300. Stability of this
  complex is further increased by linkage with phosphorylated Stress responsive activator
  of p53 (Strap). Based on: [,,,,]. (B) JMY’s effect on p53. Following DNA damage,
  p53 is phosphorylated and escapes degradation resulting in upregulation of p53 levels.
  Phosphorylated p53 binds to the JMY/p300/Strap complex and its transcriptional activity
  increases. Based on: []. (C) Formation of molecular complexes and their effects
  on apoptosis and cell cycle. Following DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated and released
  from MDM2. It binds to the p300/JMY/Strap complex which causes acetylation of five
  Lysine residues located on the C terminus region of p53. This leads to an increased
  ability of p53 to transcribe Bax, but not p21, resulting in a preferential activation
  of the apoptotic pathway over cell cycle arrest. However, when PRMT5 is recruited
  to Strap that is bound to the JMY/p300 complex, this triggers the methylation of
  p53 shifting the process away from Bax transcription and apoptosis to increased
  transcription of p21 and induction of cell cycle arrest. PRMT5 further reinforces
  this switch by E2F1 inhibition via methylation which reduces JMY’s transcription.
