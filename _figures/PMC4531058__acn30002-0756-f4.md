caption: Network graph representing Pearson correlations between metabolites for NC,
  PHD, and HD groups (r = ±0.7 to ±0.2) for each pathway. Red lines represent negative
  correlations while blue lines represent positive correlations. These results demonstrate
  altered relationships amongst metabolites across disease groups, suggesting unique
  alterations in the feedback control of key enzymatic processes that change with
  HD progression.
