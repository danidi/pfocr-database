caption: The LIPC SNP rs1800588 was associated with folate levels, the LPL SNP rs328
  was associated with HDL cholesterol, and both of these genes are in the glycerolipid
  metabolism KEGG pathway in Mexican Americans. The APOA5 SNP rs135506, associated
  with triglyceride levels in our study, shares the PPAR signaling pathway along with
  LPL.
