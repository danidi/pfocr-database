caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis identified two networks of genes down regulated
  in response to 90 minutes of ischemia in aged mouse liver. (A) Network 1 shows 6
  differentially expressed focus genes involved in the proteasome ubiquitin pathway
  which include proteasome subunit, alpha type (PSMA) 1, 4, 5, and 7; cytoplasmic
  FMR1 interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1); and ring finger protein 14 (RNF14). (B) Network
  2 classified 14 differentially expressed focus genes involved in the proteasome
  ubiquitinylation pathway. Proteasome 26S subunit, non- ATPase (PSMD) 2, 4, 7, 10,
  11, 12 and 14; N-myc (and STAT) interactor (NMI); histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS);
  proteasome subunit, alpha type 2 (PSMA2); proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase (PSMD)
  3 and 6; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit E (EIF3S6); and COP9
  (constitutive photomorphogenic) homolog, subunit 6 (Arabidopsis thaliana) (COPS6).
