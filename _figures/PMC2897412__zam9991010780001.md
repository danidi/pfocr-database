caption: Metabolic pathway and fuc regulon for l-fucose and l-1,2-PDO. (A) Metabolic
  pathway for l-fucose and l-1,2-PDO. In E. coli, fucose metabolism is initiated by
  the sequential actions of a permease (encoded by fucP), an isomerase (encoded by
  fucI), a kinase (encoded by fucK), and an aldolase (encoded by fucA). The aldolase
  catalyzes cleavage of fuculose-1-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and l-lactaldehyde.
  Under aerobic respiratory conditions, the l-lactaldehyde is further oxidized by
  a series of enzymes to pyruvate, which subsequently enters central metabolism. Under
  anaerobic fermentative conditions, the l-lactaldehyde is reduced to l-1,2-PDO by
  oxidoreductase (encoded by fucO). (B) Genetic organization of the fuc regulon. The
  fuc regulon for l-fucose uptake and metabolism consists of two divergent operons,
  fucAO and fucPIKUR.
