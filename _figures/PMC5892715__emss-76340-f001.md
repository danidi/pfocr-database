caption: First step in the DDR activation is recruitment of ATM kinase by MRN complex
  to DSBs through its interaction with NBS1,. At the DSB ATM is activated (for details
  see ) and phosphorylates both itself and other substrates (1). One of the most important
  substrates of ATM is H2AX, which provides a scaffold for the further accumulation
  of DDR factors. γH2AX is recognized and bound by MDC1 that then enables further
  accumulation of ATM-MRN complex and spreading of γH2AX around DSBs (2),. ATM-mediated
  phosphorylation of MDC1 allows also for the recruitment of RNF8 ubiquitin ligase
  (3), which ubiquitinates histone H1 and enables the recruitment of another ubiquitin
  ligase RNF168 (4),, which in turn ubiquitinates histone H2A. Ubiquitination of H2A
  together with the deposition of methyl group done by MMSET results in the recruitment
  of 53BP1 (5), which coordinates with other factors DNA repair pathway choice.
