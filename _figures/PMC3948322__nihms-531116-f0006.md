caption: Model for the mechanism by which BDNF enhances repair of oxidative DNA damage
  in neurons. Neurons generate considerable amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  in mitochondria (superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) which can cause oxidative damage
  to DNA bases. Under usual conditions, neurons express sufficient amounts of the
  base excision repair (BER) enzymes that repair oxidative DNA lesions (OGG1, APE1,
  DNA ligase and DNA polymerase β). However, when levels of excitatory synaptic activity
  are elevated, or during injury, aging, and neurodegenerative disease, basal levels
  of repair are insufficient to prevent excessive accumulation of DNA lesions. Activation
  of BDNF receptors (TrkB) results in activation of PI3 kinase (PI3K) which phosphorylates
  AKT. AKT, in turn, phosphorylates the transcription factor CREB (pCREB), which then
  binds to the promoter of the APE1 gene to induce the expression of APE1 and enhance
  BER. In addition, Ca2+ influx through ionotropic glutamate receptor channels can
  upregulate APE1 expression via a pathway involving calmodulin (CaM) and calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase (CaMK) which phosphorylates and activates CREB (13). By upregulating
  APE1 and BER, environmental factors that induce BDNF expression, such as regular
  exercise, may increase the resistance of neurons to oxidative DNA damage
