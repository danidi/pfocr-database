caption: Summary Effect of miR34a. The miR34a delivery using HA-NPs can induce apoptosis
  in cisplatin sensitive (A549) and cisplatin resistant (A549 DDP) NSCLC cancer cell
  lines. miR34a can inhibit the Nrf-2 pathway and result in decreased levels of Glutathione
  (GSH). This altered redox status can further affect the levels of DNA methyl transferase
  (DNMT1) as well as Ten Eleven Translocase (TET) enzymes. Such altered levels of
  epigenetic enzymes can further lead to altered epigenetic status on mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) and resulting in altered mitochondrial transcription and mitochondrial
  bioenergetics. Consequently, elevated mitochondrial ATP and cytochrome C oxidase
  can further contribute towards caspase activation and apoptotic induction. This
  process is also supported by the effects of PGC1-alpha on mitochondrial transcription
  and biogenesis. In parallel, miR34a can also inhibit the anti-apoptotic factor resulting
  in elevated levels of caspase-3 activation and apoptotic induction.
