caption: Glycosphingolipid structure and biosynthesis. (A) Basic structure of a neutral
  glycosphingolipid, made up of a sphingoid base (highlighted in blue) and a fatty
  acid chain (highlighted in black) to form ceramide, which is linked to a sugar residue
  (highlighted in red). (B) The structure of IPC, a simple acidic glycosphingolipid,
  is shown. Acidic glycosphingolipids differ from neutral glycosphingolipids in that
  they contain an additional -OH group at C4 of the sphingoid base and lack C9-methylation
  and Δ4- and Δ8-unsaturations (highlighted in orange). Another difference is that
  acidic glycosphingolipids are made up of a very long fatty acid (C18–26, highlighted
  in purple) instead of the C16–18 chain found in neutral glycosphingolipids. (C)
  Proposed biosynthetic pathway of glycosphingolipids. The reactions indicated by
  the number 3 are common to acidic and neutral GSL synthesis, while those indicated
  by the numbers 4 and 5 are exclusive of neutral (see Neutral GSL Synthesis in the
  text) and acidic (see Acidic GSL Synthesis in the text) GSLs, respectively.
