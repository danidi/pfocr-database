caption: Working model of TGFβ and NFκB pathway interactions that regulate GCT viability.
  Our current working model of GCT cell survival regulatory mechanisms proposes that
  in normal ovary, TGFβs, and NFκB act via SMAD2/3-dependent and ERK1/2 signaling
  pathways to coordinately regulate granulosa cell development, maturation, proliferation,
  and survival over the course of folliculogenesis. During tumor progression in GCT,
  progressive loss of betaglycan expression results in increasing insensitivity to
  TGFβ-mediated cell death and reduced control of NFκB activity. Late-stage metastatic
  GCT exhibit constitutively active NFκB activity, in part via increased SMAD3 and
  ERK1/2 signaling, which are now largely dependent on continuous NFκB activation.
  These codependent positive regulatory factors converge to drive GCT progression
  and growth.
