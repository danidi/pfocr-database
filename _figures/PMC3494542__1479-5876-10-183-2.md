caption: TGF-β canonical signaling pathway. After ligand binding, TGF-β receptors
  dimerize and phosphorylate intracellular SMAD proteins. Complex of SMAD2 and/or
  SMAD3 becomes phosphorylated by TβRI and forms a complex with SMAD4 which is subsequently
  transported into the nucleus where it binds with specific transcription factors
  (TF) and induces a transcription of TGF-β dependent genes
