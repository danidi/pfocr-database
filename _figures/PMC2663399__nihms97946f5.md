caption: 'Primed ssDNA accumulates at stalled replication forks when a polymerase
  stalls. In apparently independent processes, the resulting structure supports assembly
  of the proteins required for PCNA ubiquitination (Rad6 and Rad18) as well as the
  proteins required for activation of the ATR-dependent checkpoint pathway. For simplicity,
  only a few checkpoint proteins are depicted here: the 911 checkpoint clamp and the
  ATR-ATRIP heterodimer. Proper assembly of these proteins leads to phosphorylation
  of the downstream effector kinase Chk1 and cell cycle arrest. Shown are the presumed
  effects of stalling the leading (left) and lagging (right) strand polymerases. On
  the leading strand, ssDNA accumulates upon functional uncoupling of MCM helicase
  and replicative DNA polymerase activities, and in this case, the 5′-primer end thought
  to be required for checkpoint activation could be provided by the adjacent origin,
  or possibly replication restart. Note how a single stalled fork (i.e. gap) can be
  detected simultaneously by the two PCNA and 911 clamps.'
