caption: Diagram of ouabain/EO-activated, α2 Na+ pump/Src-mediated signaling cascade
  (the EO/α2 Na+ pump signalosome). EO binding to the α2 Na+ pump activates a Src
  (Src family tyrosine kinase), which, in turn, activates mitogen-activated protein
  kinases (MAPKs) such as P38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2).
  This leads to altered expression and/or phosphorylation of several ion transport
  proteins including the α2 Na+ pump, NCX, and ROC and SOC. As described in main text,
  these mechanisms are cell type specific. Ouabain/EO triggers upregulation of Ca2+signaling
  proteins and vasoconstriction in arterial myocytes and attenuated vasodilation in
  endothelial cells. This slow signaling pathway thus modulates the rapid Ca2+signaling
  mechanisms diagrammed in . EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor.
