caption: Recent examples of microswimmers with sensing capabilities. (A) Signal transduction
  pathway engineered into biohybrid microswimmers based on Bacillus subtilis. The
  presence of certain stimuli in the microswimmer environment ultimately leads to
  a measurable output, either fluorescence or chemiluminiscence. Figure reproduced
  from [], © 2019 by the authors (Creative Commons Attribution license). (B) Microswimmers
  developed for the diagnosis and treatment of multi drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.
  The microswimmers combine propulsion by magnetic actuation, bacterial detection
  using fluorescent markers, photoacoustic imaging, and photothermal therapy enabled
  by near-infrared (NIR) illumination. Figure reproduced from [], © 2020 American
  Chemical Society.
