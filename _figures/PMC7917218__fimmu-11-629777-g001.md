caption: '(A) The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is regulated by three transmembrane
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) receptors: PERK, ATF6 and IRE1α. BiP binds to and holds
  the receptors in an inactive state under non-stressed conditions. The accumulation
  of unfolded proteins in the ER leads to the disassociation of BiP from the receptors
  and UPR activation. PERK phosphorylates eIF2α and induces ATF4, which controls transcription
  of chop and gadd34. ATF6 is cleaved and translocated to the nucleus to regulate
  expression of GRP94, p58IPK, and UPR-associated proteins. IRE1α splices xbp1, which
  is translated into a protein that controls genes involved in lipid biosynthesis,
  ER associated degradation pathway (ERAD) and chaperone production. IRE1α can also
  recruit TRAF2, which leads to NF-kB, ASK1 and JNK signaling. (B) The Integrated
  Stress Response (ISR) is initiated by stress-specific stimuli that activate kinases
  GCN2, HRI, PKR and PERK, which all converge on the regulatory molecule eIF2α. Phosphorylation
  of eIF2α halts global protein translation and upregulates the transcription factor
  ATF4, which determines cell fate. To terminate the ISR, ATF4 induces GADD34 expression
  which dephosphorylates eIF2α and allows global protein translation to resume.'
