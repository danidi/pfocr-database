caption: 'Network of canonical signaling pathways that are individually associated
  with CpG-ODN responsiveness, host gene coexpression modules, and microbial community
  features. An integrated approach was used to identify common canonical pathways
  (light blue circles) enriched from the following three paired datasets obtained
  from patients with IPF in the COMET-IPF study: (1) fibroblast response to CpG-ODN,
  (2) microbial diversity indices and OTUs, and (3) WGCNA host gene coexpression modules.
  Up-regulated genes between cases with CpG-ODN response and CpG-ODN nonresponse were
  subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis with a criterion of FDR less than 0.01 to
  identify 22 significantly CpG-ODN response–associated canonical pathways. These
  22 pathways were then matched to the canonical pathways associated with 10 host
  gene coexpression modules (gray squares) from PBMC microarray and microbial diversity
  indices and OTUs (purple diamonds) from bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing (Tables
  E2 and E4, respectively). Fourteen pathways (light blue circles) were shared among
  CpG-ODN response (yellow hexagon), microbial features (purple diamonds), and host
  gene coexpression modules (gray squares). The red and green edges represent positive
  and negative associations between nodes, respectively. Gray edges represent both
  positive and negative associations between nodes. The width of the edge is proportional
  to the value of −log P value (i.e., thicker edge is more significant). COMET-IPF = Correlating
