caption: Expression patterns of genes of the NF-κB signaling pathway in the intestinal
  tissue. (A) Intestinal tissue exposed to 10 μM DON; (B) Intestinal tissue exposed
  to S. cerevisiae boulardii and 10 μM DON. Red nodes represent up-regulated genes,
  and green nodes represent down-regulated genes identified in our differential expression
  analysis. Darker node colors indicate more extreme (high or low) up- or down-regulation
  of the respective gene. White nodes represent genes involved in the signaling pathway
  that were not identified in the microarray analysis. The red circles indicate genes
  showing different expression pattern in both conditions.
