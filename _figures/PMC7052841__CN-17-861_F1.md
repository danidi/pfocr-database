caption: Mechanisms involved in the antiparkinsonian effect of selegiline (SEL), rasagiline
  (RAS), and safinamide (SAF). The Figure is a schematic drawing of the basal ganglia
  motor circuit, with dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc)
  projecting to the caudate nucleus and putamen (CPU). Striatal projection neurons
  of the direct and indirect pathway are stimulated and inhibited by D1 and D2 dopamine
  receptors (D1R, D2R), respectively. Both neurons express NMDA receptors (NMDA-R)
  and mGlu5 metabotroic glutamate receptors (mGluR5), which are activated by the glutamate
  released from cortico-striatal fibers (CTX = cerebral cortex). The external globus
  pallidus (GPe) and the subthatamic nucleus (STN) are the two stations of the indirect
  pathway. STN glutamatergic neurons send excitatory projections to the internal globus
  pallidus (GPi) and the substantia nigra pars reticulate (SNpr). Neurons of the direct
  patway send GABAergic projection to the GPi and SNpr. Dopamine (DA) released from
  nigro-striatal terminals is taken up by astrocytes, where it is transformed into
  DOPAC by MAOB. Inhibition of MAOB by SEL, RAS, and SAF enhances DA levels in the
  striatum. SAF can also inhibit glutamate release in the GP and SNpr. Inhibition
  of glutamate release in the striatum by SAF was not demonstrated by in vivo microdialysis
  experiments []. (The color version of the figure is available in the electronic
  copy of the article).
