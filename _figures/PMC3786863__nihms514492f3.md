caption: Core genetic pathway controlling the proliferation vs. differentiation decision
  (top) with factors that promote the proliferative fate and/or inhibit meiotic entry
  shown in green, while factors that promote meiotic entry and/or inhibit the proliferative
  fate shown in red. In this model, the LAG-2 and APX-1 ligands, which are expressed
  on the distal tip cell (DTC), interact with the GLP-1 Notch receptor, which is expressed
  on the germ cells. This causes the intracellular portion of GLP-1 to translocate
  to the nucleus and interact with the LAG-1 CSL transcription factor and SEL-8 Mastermind
  co-activator. These are all conserved components of the Notch signaling pathway.
  The GLP-1 pathway inhibits the activities of the redundant GLD-1 and GLD-2 genetic
  pathways, whose components all appear to regulate mRNA stability and/or translatability.
  An additional redundant pathway that is inhibited by GLP-1 signaling has been uncovered
  genetically (not shown), although genes that reside in this pathway have not been
  identified. The basic model of how signaling from the DTC regulates the proliferation
  vs. differentiation decision is shown (bottom). While germ cells are in the distal-most
  end of the gonad arm, close to the DTC (yellow), GLP-1 Notch signaling levels are
  high (green), keeping the activities of the GLD-1 and GLD-2 pathways low (red),
  resulting in cells remaining in the proliferative fate. As cells move proximally,
  GLP-1 Notch signaling levels decrease, causing the activities of the GLD-1 and GLD-2
  pathways to increase, resulting in cells entering into meiotic prophase.
