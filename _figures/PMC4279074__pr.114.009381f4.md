caption: ROCK activation of YAP/TAZ-TEAD–directed profibrotic gene expression. In
  addition to the MRTF-SRF pathway, ROCK has recently been shown to regulate gene
  expression through the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, the transcriptional
  coactivators YAP and TAZ. YAP and TAZ bind and activate the TEAD family of transcription
  factors, which directs the expression of genes that promote cell proliferation,
  including CTGF. The subcellular localization of YAP and TAZ is determined by their
  phosphorylation state. Phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ by Lats 1/2 kinases results
  in their sequestration in the cytoplasm due to binding by 14-3-3 regulatory proteins;
  inhibition of Lats 1/2 kinases results in YAP/TAZ dephosphorylation and nuclear
  translocation. LPA activation of its G protein–coupled receptors has been shown
  to inhibit Lats 1/2 kinases, and promote YAP/TAZ dephosphorylation, as has matrix
  stiffening, through a signaling pathway that also involves ROCK activation and actin
  polymerization.
