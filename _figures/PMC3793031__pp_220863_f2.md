caption: Symbiotic signaling downstream of  oscillations. The generation of  oscillations
  requires components essential for both rhizobia and  symbioses, collectively referred
  to as the common symbiosis (SYM) signaling pathway.  is responsible for decoding
  the  oscillations through its association with  and calmodulin (CaM; ).  associates
  with and phosphorylates CYCLOPS (). Downstream of  and CYCLOPS, a suit of GRAS transcription
  factors are required to activate nodulation or  programs (). NODULATION SIGNALING
  PATHWAY2 (NSP2) associates with both the nodulation-specific GRAS transcription
  factor NSP1 () and the -specific GRAS transcription factor REQUIRED FOR ARBUSCULAR
  MYCORRHIZATION1 (RAM1; ). The complex NSP2/NSP1 is required for the expression of
  nodulation genes (ERN1, NIN, and ENOD11), while the complex NSP2/RAM1 modulates
  the expression of -specific genes such as RAM2 (). In this model, we hypothesize
  that upon symbiont stimulation (Myc or Nod factors), the transcription factor complexes
  are recruited by specific unknown  (X) or nodulation (Y) components. The /CYCLOPS
  complex is activated via  oscillations and activates symbiotic gene expression,
  either independently or in combination with the GRAS protein complexes.
