caption: When free radical chain oxidation generates oxidized phospholipid mediators,
  Ca2+signaling is induced, followed by the activation of calcineurin and subsequent
  induction of the NFAT pathway. On the other hand, H2 modifies the production of
  oxidized phospholipids by modulating free radical chain reactions. The putative
  oxidized phospholipids appear to function as antagonists and lead to a decline in
  Ca2+signaling.
