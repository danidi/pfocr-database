caption: Increased vulnerability to the depression-like effects of chronic social
  defeat stress occurs in part via priming of BDNF signaling in the nucleus accumbens
  (NAc). Under control conditions (left), BDNF activation of TrkB signaling is limited.
  However, after some prior stimulus that increases susceptibility (e.g., repeated
  stress, chronic cocaine exposure; right), BDNF–TrkB signaling is increased in the
  NAc, causing enhanced phosphorylation and activity of several downstream-signaling
  mediators, including cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). This maladaptive
  response occurs not only through increased BDNF release into the NAc from the VTA,
  but also through epigenetic modifications that further prime BDNF signaling cascades.
  For example, chronic stress increases Ras expression in NAc of susceptible animals
  by decreasing G9a binding at the H-Ras1 gene promoter, causing reduced levels of
  repressive H3K9me2 (dimethyl-Lys9-histone H3, a major form of repressive histone
  methylation). Ras also appears to be a target for CREB, creating a pathological
  feed-forward loop that promotes CREB activation and Ras expression as well as depression-like
  behavior. The figure also shows the induction of another pathway downstream of BDNF,
  including inhibitor of kappa kinase (IKK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) — possibly
  downstream of the p75 BDNF receptor — in the NAc after chronic social defeat stress
  in susceptible animals.
