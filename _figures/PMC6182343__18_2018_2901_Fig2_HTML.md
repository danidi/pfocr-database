caption: 'Representation of the methylamine pathway illustrating the microbiota–host
  co-metabolism. Bacterial enzymes use dietary substrates, choline, betaine, l-carnitine,
  γ-butyrobetaine, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) to synthesise trimethylamine (TMA),
  which is transferred across the intestinal endothelium to the circulation and transported
  to the liver where it is metabolised into TMAO by the enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase
  (FMO3). The TMA substrate betaine can be synthesised from choline and l-carnitine.
