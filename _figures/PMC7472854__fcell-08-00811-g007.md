caption: Proposed signaling pathways involved in the SNX9-induced inhibition of ADPKD
  development. SNX9 interacted directly with YAP, which increased the LATS1-mediated
  phosphorylation of YAP, leading to the cytoplasmic retention of YAP and the decreased
  transcriptional activity of the YAP/TEAD4 complex, and, consequently, inhibited
  the expression of Hippo target genes and ADPKD development.
