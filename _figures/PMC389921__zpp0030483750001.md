caption: Biosynthetic relationship of DFR to anthocyanidins, leucoanthocyanidins,
  catechins, and condensed tannins (CTs). CHI, Chalcone isomerase; F3H, (2S)-flavanone
  3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; F3′,5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase;
  ANS, anthocyanidin synthase (also known as leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase); GT,
  anthocyanidin glucosyl transferase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase. A to C on
  the naringenin structure indicate the standard nomenclature assigned to the three
  flavonoid rings. After 3-O-glucosylation of anthocyanidins to form anthocyanins
  by GT, anthocyanins may be further modified, undergoing additional glycosylation,
  methylation, and acylation. The pathway differs from that in recent reviews of flavonoid
  biosynthesis to account for the recent discovery that anthocyanin reductase (ANR
  or BAN) produces 2,3-cis-flavan-3-ols such as epicatechin (3′,4′ B ring hydroxylated)
  via the NADPH-dependent reduction of anthocyanidins, not leucoanthocyanidins ().
