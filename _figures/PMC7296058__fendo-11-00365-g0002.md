caption: The role of the PPP in insulin resistance. (A) CARKL is highly expressed
  in M2 macrophages, limiting the PPP flux by inhibiting G6PD. M2 macrophages release
  anti-inflammatory mediators including IL-10 and arginase 1 to maintain insulin sensitivity.
  Decreased G6PD in adipocytes suppresses inflammation and ameliorates insulin resistance.
  (B) FFAs and pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, and resistin increase
  G6PD expression in both adipocytes and M1 macrophages, which stimulate inflammatory
  responses leading to insulin resistance.
