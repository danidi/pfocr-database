caption: 'The transcription factor NF-κB regulates the cellular response to inflammatory
  and oxidant stress, as well as stretch. Normally, NF-κB remains sequestered in the
  cytoplasm bound to members of a family of inhibitory proteins: IκB. The canonical
  pathway, active after inflammatory stress (TNFα, LPS, etc) results in activation
  of IKK (IκB kinase), which phosphorylates (p) the inhibitory protein IκBα on 2 N-terminal
  serine residues. With hyperoxia, a tyrosine kinase phosphorylates (p) the inhibitory
  protein IκBα on tyrosine 42. The pathway that leads to NF-κB activation after stretch
  has not been described. Phosphorylation of IκBα results in the ubiquitination (u)
  and subsequent degradation of IκBα, which allows for dissociation and nuclear translocation
  of the active NF-κB dimer (the p65 and p50 subunits are used as examples here),
  binding to specific nucleotide sequences on promoter genes and transcriptional activation
  or repression of gene expression. Known inhibitors of NF-κB activation, including
  NO, dexamethasone, azithromycin, and pentoxifylline, are shown where they affect
  the activation cascade. Multiple genes with a purported role in the pathogenesis
  of BPD are controlled by NF-κB. IFNγ indicates interferon γ; MIP-2, macrophage inflammatory
  protein 2; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted;
  ELAM-1, endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1; ICAM-1, intracellular adhesion
  molecule 1; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion molecule; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor;
  G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
  factor; SOD, superoxide dismutase; MMP-9, matrix metallopeptidase 9; iNOS, inducible
  NO synthase; EGR-1, early growth response 1.'
