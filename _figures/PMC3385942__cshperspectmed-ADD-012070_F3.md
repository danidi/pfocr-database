caption: Chronic morphine decreases VTA DA soma size yet increases neuronal excitability,
  while DA transmission to NAc is decreased. The net effect of morphine is a less
  responsive reward pathway, i.e., reward tolerance. Down-regulation of IRS2-AKT signaling
  (blue) in VTA mediates the effects of chronic morphine on soma size and electrical
  excitability; the effect on excitability is mediated via decreased GABAA currents
  and suppression of K+ channel expression. Morphine-induced down-regulation of mTORC2
  activity in VTA is crucial for these morphine-induced morphological and physiological
  adaptations as well as for reward tolerance. In contrast to mTORC2, chronic morphine
  increases mTORC1 activity (red), which does not appear to directly influence these
  morphine-induced adaptations. Chronic morphine also decreases DA output to NAc,
  as well as decreasing dendritic branching and the number of dendritic spines on
  medium spiny GABA neurons in NAc, further suppressing normal DA signaling in the
  mesolimbic circuit.
