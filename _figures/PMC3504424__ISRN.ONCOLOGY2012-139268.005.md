caption: Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway. TGF-β receptor is a dimer formed
  by TβRII (with a binding site for TGF-β) and TβRI (with a glycine/serine rich domain).
  The complete receptor is autophosphorylated and recruits and phosphorylates a gene
  regulatory protein called SMAD (adapted from []).
