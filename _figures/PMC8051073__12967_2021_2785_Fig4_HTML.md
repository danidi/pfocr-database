caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), prediction network of the T1DM conditions
  presented in this study with the upregulation (red) of miR-126-5p, IL-7, TNF-α,
  VEGF-C, CXCR1, CXCR2 and glucose. Orange signifies predicted activation of a molecule
  or biological function. Paler orange shades signify a prediction of less activation.
  Blue signifies inhibition of a molecule or biological function. White represents
  a molecule or biological function is unchanged. Orange lines represent stimulation,
  blues lines represent inhibition, the black lines represent a correlation, grey
  lines represent reciprocal stimulation and inhibition, and purple lines represents
  simultaneous stimulation and inhibition. Solid un-interrupted lines represent a
  direct action and dashed interrupted lines represent an indirect action. Alanine
  aminotransferase (ALT)
