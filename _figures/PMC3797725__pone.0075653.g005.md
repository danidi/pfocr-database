caption: 'Not all metabolic pathways are shown. Black and grey pathways and proteins
  indicate presence during Fe-limitation, white proteins indicate significantly down-regulated
  proteins, colored pathways were significantly up-regulated in Fe-limited cells compared
  to Fe-replete cells. A) Pentose Phosphate Pathway, B) The rejoining of the pentose
  phosphate pathway with glycolysis and generation of pyruvate. C) Polyamine synthesis
  using spermine synthase. D) Proposed reduction of Fe+3 and eventual transport of
  Fe into cells. Purple: photosynthesis and glycolysis-gluconeogenesis, red: nucleotide
  metabolism, teal: lipid metabolism, orange: amino acid metabolism.'
