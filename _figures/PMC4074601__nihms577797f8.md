caption: Model of PMA-induced SnoN turnover and CD61 expression. PMA stimulates expression
  of Activin A which activates Smad2 signaling pathway via activating its receptors,
  such as Alk4. Phosphorylated Smad2 functions as a cofactor for the APCCdh1 ubiquitin
  ligase to ubiquitinate SnoN. SnoN functions as an inhibitor of CD61 expression and
  its proteolysis via the ubiquitin and proteasome pathway is important for PMA-induced
  CD61 induction.
