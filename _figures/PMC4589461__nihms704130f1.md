caption: 'The classic bile acid synthesis pathway is initiated by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  (CYP7A1) to synthesize two primary bile acids, cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic
  acid (CDCA). Cholic acid synthesis requires sterol 12α-hydroxylase (Cyp8B1). Mitochondrial
  sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) catalyzes steroid-side chain oxidative cleavage.
  In the alternative pathway, side-chain cleavage by CYP27A1 precedes 7α-hydroxylation
  by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) to synthesize oxidized sterols (oxysterols)
  in most tissues. In mice, CDCA is converted to α- and β-muricholic acids (MCAs).
  Most bile acids are conjugated to taurine (T) in mice, and secreted into bile, stored
  in the gallbladder. After each meal, bile acids are secreted into the intestinal
  tract for absorption and transport of nutrients. In the intestine, bacteria bile
  salt hydrolase de-conjugated bile acids and then bacteria 7α-dehydroxylase activity
  removed a 7α-HO group from CA and CACA to form deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic
  acid (LCA), respectively, and other secondary bile acids as indicated. FXR/MAFG
  signaling directly inhibits CYP8B1 and CYP27A1 in the classic pathway and may also
  inhibit CYP27A1 and CYP7B1 in the alternative pathway (Pathway 1). In the liver,
  FXR induces SHP to inhibit transactivation of the CYP7A1/CYP8B1 gene (Pathway 2).
  In the intestine, FXR induces FGF15, which is transported via portal circulation
  to the liver to activate a membrane FGF receptor 4 (FGFR4)/β-Klotho signaling to
  inhibit CYP7A1/CYP8B1 gene transcription (Pathway 3). Abbreviations: CYP7A1, cholesterol
