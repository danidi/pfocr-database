caption: UV photodamage is repaired by the nucleotide excision repair genome maintenance
  pathway. In TC-nucleotide excision repair, a blocked RNA polymerase acts as the
  damage recognition signal whereas in GG-nucleotide excision repair, XPC initiates
  repair by locating the damage and recruiting the subunits of a large complex called
  transcription factor II H (containing XPB and XPD). These proteins initiate strand
  separation, enabling other nucleotide excision repair factors to bind, including
  XPA, replication protein A (RPA), XPG and excision repair cross-complementation
  group 1 (ERCC1)-XPF. Once ERCC1-XPF is positioned on DNA via its interaction with
  XPA, it incises the damaged strand 5' to the lesion, followed by XPG performing
  the 3' incision. Repair is completed by polymerases in combination with proliferating
  cell nuclear antigen replace the gap using the undamaged complementary strand for
  fidelity. Please see the following excellent recent reviews for more detail about
  nucleotide excision repair (, , )
