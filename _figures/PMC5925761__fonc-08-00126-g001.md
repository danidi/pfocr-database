caption: One-carbon metabolism (1-CM) and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) at the cross-road
  between anabolism and redox balance. Simplified scheme of the crosstalk between
  metabolic and signaling pathways that can occur in cancer cells. Pro-tumorigenic
  signals are represented in red and anti-tumorigenic in green. Glycolysis regulates
  both PPP and 1-CM. Serine signaling pathway, once PKM2 activity is inhibited (red
  light), leads to glycolytic intermediates accumulation hence fueling both PPP and
  1-CM. Serine metabolism enzymes bridge the shunt between glycolysis and 1-CM, with
  specific oncogene upregulating the enzymes involved [i.e., phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase
  (PGHDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH)],
  leading to serine generation and antioxidant machinery intermediates (cysteine and
  glutathione). Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) mediates the conversion between
  serine and glycine with the concurrent transformation of tetrahydrofolate (THF)
  into 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (meTHF). Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member
  (ALDH1L) mediates the opposite reaction with concurrent generation of NADPH, similarly
  methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHDF) transform meTHF into 10-formyltetrahydrofolate
  (F-THF) with concurrent generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate.
  The main chemotherapy agents are represented in blue. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),
  epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine
  (PP2), 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
