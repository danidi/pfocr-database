caption: DNA damage signaling at replication forks. During DNA replication, lesions
  (yellow square) in the DNA template block the progression of DNA polymerases and
  result in the stalling and uncoupling of replicative polymerases with helicase activities
  of the replication machinery at the lesion site, generating tracts of single-strand
  DNA (ssDNA) due to continuous unwinding of DNA by helicases. ssDNA is subsequently
  bound by RPA. RPA-ssDNA then serves to signal the recruitment of ATR through its
  interacting partner, ATRIP, where it phosphorylates and activates Chk1. ATR-Chk1
  activation requires intricate crosstalk between TopBP1, BACH1, 9-1-1 complex, Timeless,
  Tipin and Claspin mediator proteins at the replication forks. ATR-Chk1 pathway serves
  to activate cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair machinery to repair the DNA lesion
