caption: Activation of a B-cell and its regulation by miR-155. When B-cell receptor
  is activated by the F(ab')2 of antibody in general, a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine
  kinase Lyn activates a downstream tyrosine kinase Syk, followed by the initiation
  of the ITAM-mediated signalling pathway. When B cells are activated by the whole
  molecule of antibody, but not by F(ab')2, the activated Lyn phosphorylates Syk as
  well as ITIM in the cytoplasmic region of FcγRIIB. Tyrosine-phosphorylated ITIM
  then recruits SHIP1 as well as other negative regulators, leading to cell inactivation.
  miR-155 impairs SHIP1 expression, leading to enhanced B-cell activation in response
  to the whole molecule of antibody. Note that an intact antibody in general can be
  cleaved by pepsin protease into an F(ab')2 fragment and an Fc fragment. ITAM, immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
  motif.
