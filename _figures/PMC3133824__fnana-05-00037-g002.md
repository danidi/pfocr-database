caption: Mechanisms for import and export of proteins to and from the nucleus. The
  major identified cytonuclear traffic pathways have been characterized in non-neuronal
  cells and their specifics in MSNs are not known. Transport is mediated by karyopherins
  which are also known as importins (Imp) and exportins, depending on their function.
  Proteins are imported by binding to Impα through a basic nuclear localization sequence
  (NLS). Some others bind directly to Impβ. For example, proteins with nuclear translocation
  sequence (NTS Ser/Thr-Pro-Ser/Thr), which is activated by phosphorylation, bind
  to Imp7 (Chuderland et al., ). The complex moves through the nuclear pore complex
  (NPC) to the nucleoplasm where its dissociation is induced by RanGTP. The best-characterized
  nuclear export pathway is mediated by the exportin CRM1. Proteins containing a hydrophobic
  nuclear export sequence (NES) bind to CRM1 in the presence of RanGTP. Following
  translocation the complex is dissociated through hydrolysis of GTP by Ran GTPase-activating
  proteins (Ran GAPs) enriched on the cytoplasmic side of the NPC. Leptomycin B (LMB)
  prevents binding of NES to CRM1. CRM1-independent export pathways are poorly characterized.
  RanGDP is imported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where GDP is replaced by GTP
  by specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs, not shown). Following carrier-cargo
  dissociation, the empty importins or exportins return to their compartment of origin
  through specific pathways that are not indicated on the scheme. References can be
  found in the text and in (Pemberton and Paschal, ; Poon and Jans, ; Nardozzi et
  al., ).
