caption: A proposed metabolic pathway responsible for thiocyanate (SCN−) degradation
  by Thiohalobacter sp. strain FOKN1. TcDH; thiocyanate dehydrogenase, CNase; cyanate
  lyase, DsrAB; dissimilatory sulfite reductase, Apa; adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate
  (APS) reductase, Sat; sulfate adenylyltransferase, Sox; sulfur-oxidizing protein,
  Fcc; flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase, Sqr; sulfide:quinone reductase, and
  Soe; sulfite oxidoreductase. Locus tag numbers are shown in parentheses. The abundance
  of proteins detected in the proteome is presented as the protein content index.
  n.f; not found in the proteome.
