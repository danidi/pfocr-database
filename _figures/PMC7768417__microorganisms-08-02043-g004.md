caption: Proposed model for observed BNF activity in L. lactis associated with Sierra
  Mixe maize (1). Lactococci import monosaccharide derivatives of the aerial root
  mucilage polysaccharide comprised of pentoses (arabinose, xylose) and hexoses (galactose,
  mannose) [,] as their primary energy source for generating ATP and reducing equivalents
  based on their lack of a complete Krebs cycle []. Hexose sugars are phosphorylated
  and fed into glycolysis to generate ATP and reducing equivalents. Arabinose and
  xylose are catabolized via the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) and fed into glycolysis as well through the activity of gene products from
  the araABD operon and the xylA gene, respectively; (2) Uptake of iron–siderophores
  (yellow star) is facilitated through action of the YusV and FeuABC transporters.
  Iron is liberated from siderophores by esterase activity of the BesA protein [],
  generating cytosolic iron that is readily available for iron–sulfur cluster biosynthesis
  and other metabolic requirements; (3) The translocation of Hemin, Vitamin B-12 (cobalamin)
  and heme precursors (blue star) such as protoporphyrin IX occurs by the action of
  BtuD-like membrane transporters. Exogenous heme (gray star) uptake occurs through
  the action of ferrichrome ABC transporters [,], or heme assembly through the incorporation
  of cytosolic iron to imported heme precursors via ferrochelatase encoded by the
  hemH gene []; (4) Imported or synthesized heme compounds enable a membrane bound
  respiration chain (RC) and the subsequent elimination of molecular oxygen through
  the action of the cytochrome bd oxidase encoded by the cydA and cydb genes [,].
  A membrane-bound NADH oxidase initiates electron transfer to menaquinone, which
  passes the reducing power to cytochrome bd oxidase for the reductive conversion
  of O2 to water and generates a proton motive force via H+ expulsion to the periplasm
  [,]. O2 depletion is also achieved through the action of cytosolic NADH oxidase.
  The resulting potential gradient may serve as an additional path for chemical energy
  by ATP-synthetase [,]; (5) Nitrogen fixation occurs through an uncharacterized system
  involving the coordination of NIF-related proteins and novel oxidoreductases conferring
  the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia or an unknown metabolic product. The NifU,
  NifS and NifV proteins synthesize 4Fe–4S clusters, which interact with a novel NIFB-like
  protein to generate a FeMoCo-like metal cofactor potentially involved in the catalytic
  reduction. Pyruvate and ATP generated from sugar metabolism contribute to electron
  transfer between the NifJ protein and a secondary electron carrier (Ferredoxin Reductase
  or Flavodoxin), which relays the reducing equivalent to the site of catalysis.
