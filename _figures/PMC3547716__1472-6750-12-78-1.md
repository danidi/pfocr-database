caption: Overview of trans-polyisoprene biosynthesis pathway in plants. In the isoprenoid
  biosynthetic pathway, the basic five-carbon unit IPP is synthesized in the cytoplasm
  via the MVA pathway or in plastids via the DXP pathway. Then, IPP is interconverted
  to its highly electrophilic isomer, DMAPP, by the isomerase IPI at the first step.
  DMAPP then loses its inorganic pyrophosphate to form isoprene, which sequentially
  condenses with IPP to generate the short-chain isoprenoid precursors GPP, FPP, and
  GGPP. These precursors are further metabolized for the biosynthesis of distinct
  sets of isoprenoids, such as monoterpenes (C10), sesquiterpenes (C15), diterpenes
  (C20), and polyisoprenes (C>5000) by various isoprenyl diphosphate synthases.
