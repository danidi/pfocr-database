caption: Schematic diagram representing the role of the proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052
  in the regulation of tumor cells sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Treatment
  with NPI-0052 results in the modification of several genes regulating the apoptotic
  pathways. NPI-0052 inhibits the NF-κB pathway via inhibition of IκBα and p65 phosphorylation.
  NF-κB inhibition by NPI-0052 leads to the down-regulation of Bcl-xL and the induction
  of Bax (Fig. 6) contributing to the mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Furthermore,
  NPI-0052 inhibits the transcription repressor YY1, leading to up-regulation of DR5
  (Figs. 4 and 2, respectively).Thus, the combination of NPI-0052 and TRAIL results
  in the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, inhibition of antiapoptotic
  gene products, activation of procaspases 9 and 7, formation of the apoptosome, and
  altogether downstream activation of the effector caspase 3 resulting in apoptosis.
