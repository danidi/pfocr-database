caption: A possible anticancer pathway of HO-1 in neuroblastoma cells. The figure
  shows different pathways induced by NRF2 action on HO-1. All pathways converge through
  the stress of other factors, such as the splitting of the heme group and the release
  of Fe + ions, the arrest of the cell cycle with induction of p21 or through BAX
  and classic apoptosis. This figure was drawn using the software CorelDraw and the
  vector image bank of Servier Medical Art (http://smart.servier.com/). Servier Medical
