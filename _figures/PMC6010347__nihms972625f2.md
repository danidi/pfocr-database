caption: Example adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network 2 (T4-AOP network). Network
  of fourteen adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) related to disruption of thyroid hormone
  signaling (; AOPs 8, 42, 54, 155, 156, 157, 158, 175, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193;
  ). Squares indicate key events (KE). Arrows indicate key event relationships (KERs)
  with the arrow emanating out of the upstream KE and into the downstream KE. Key
  event relationships linking non-adjacent KEs were filtered out of this network and,
  KERs shared by more than one AOP are shown as non-redundant (i.e., represented by
  a single arrow). Additionally, in order to improve overall connectivity, the network
  was curated slightly with regard to titles and relationship information defined
  in the AOP-Wiki (see  for details). [A] Network overview. Molecular initiating events
  are colored green. Adverse outcomes are colored red. Arrow thickness indicates strength
  of evidence as defined in the AOP-wiki for each KER, where were weak = thinnest
  arrows, strong = thickest arrows, moderate = mid-sized arrows. A shaded circle highlights
  a KE that serves as the knot of a bow-tie motif within the network. A sequence of
  black dots highlights two examples of AOPs not described in the AOP-Wiki that “emerge”
  through network connectivity. A blue shaded rectangle highlights two KEs that represent
  the same object, but different actions (SODAs) within the AOP network.
