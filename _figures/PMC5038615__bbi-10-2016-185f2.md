caption: 'Expression of tomato genes encoding Trp and IAA biosynthesis enzymes. Major
  routes and enzyme activities involved in auxin biosynthesis are represented as in  with
  focus on the expression of corresponding co-orthologues, genes identified in the
  tomato genome. Relative transcript levels in different tissues and developmental
  stages are shown in the color code as indicated in the right lower corner.Notes:
  Analyzed samples in each row from left to right are: 1, root; 2, stem; 3, leaf;
  4, flower; 5, fruit – mature green; 6, fruit – breaker stage; 7, fruit – ripening
  10 days after turning red. Number and order of the rows at indicated co-orthologues
  corresponds to the presentation of expression data in . Genes coding for enzyme
  activities not yet identified in tomato are indicated by question mark. Color intensities
  of the arrows from light to dark orange indicate the general pathway expression
  at low, moderate, and high levels, respectively.'
