  cascade can be activated via the classical, lectin, or alternative pathway; each
  of which results in the production of tumorigenic complement proteins. C3, C3a,

  have been implicated as pro-tumorigenic molecules since they can enhance tumor angiogenesis
  or inhibit apoptosis, and thus facilitate tumor progression.
