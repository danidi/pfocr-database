caption: In response to DNA fork stalling at ICLs during the S phase of cell cycle,
  ATR and PARP1 are activated, which induces RUNX poly(ADP-ribosyl) ation and its
  interaction with BLM helicase. This leads to efficient recruitment of FANCD2-FANCI
  onto the ICLs for repair. Data from the article of  (Cell Rep. 24, 1747-1755) in
