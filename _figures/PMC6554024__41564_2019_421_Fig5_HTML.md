caption: Following IFN binding to their receptor in an autocrine or paracrine manner,
  a signalling cascade takes place that results in the transcription and expression
  of ISGs. These ISGs are critical for establishing an antiviral state in the host
  and bystander cells. Different viruses have evolved to antagonize this pathway at
  virtually all stages, indicated by blunt end arrows. Solid arrows indicate direct
  pathway connections. The asterisk indicates viral antagonism by an unknown mechanism.
  See Table  for specific mechanisms at each stage.
