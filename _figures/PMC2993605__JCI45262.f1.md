caption: The drawing illustrates how Teffs help Tregs control themselves, as suggested
  by the data generated by Grinberg-Bleyer et al. (). Pathogenic T cells infiltrate
  and inflame the tissue. Teffs produce inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α (which
  can also be produced by activated dendritic cells and macrophages) that can act
  on Tregs to promote their proliferation and expansion. Tregs can now outcompete
  the Teffs and also secrete antiinflammatory cytokines that will hamper the proliferation
  of Teffs. Decreased proliferation of Teffs will limit ongoing inflammation. An alternative
  pathway in which antigen presentation directly to Tregs may lead to their expansion
  and subsequent control of inflammation is highlighted in the gray box.
