caption: 'General roles of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) stress sensors inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK),
  and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) deliver ER stress signals from the
  ER lumen into the cytosol. IRE1 pathway: ER stress induces IRE1 oligomerization
  and autophosphorylation, then the splicing of XBP1 is triggered by activated IRE1.
  As a transcription factor, X-box binding proteins 1 (XBP1s) activate UPR-related
  genes. PERK pathway: The activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2a and further stimulates
  ATF4, which will regulate its target gene expression. Canopy homolog 2 (CNPY2) could
  dissociate from Grp78 and then promote PERK autokinase activity. Increased translation
  of CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) activates CNPY2 promoter
  and further elevates CNPY2 expression. ATF6 pathway: ATF6 is cleaved by proteases
  S1P and S2P to produce ATF6-N. ATF6-N then migrates to the nucleus to initiate the
  transcription of its target genes. IRE1-XBP1, PERK, and ATF6 pathways, if protracted,
  can contribute to the development of various diseases. Figure was made with Biorender.'
