caption: A hypothetical model illustrating the crosstalk between JA/ethylene and SA
  signaling pathways in regulating plant responses to different stress factors. Possible
  interactions between JA and other signaling pathways along with the known modular
  switches that regulate the interaction are indicated in green.
