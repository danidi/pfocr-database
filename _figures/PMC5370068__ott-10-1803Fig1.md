caption: 'Schematic representation of the interaction of tumor cells with the immune
  system.Notes: Upper panel represents the unperturbed mechanism of interaction between
  PD1 with PD-L1 in homeostasis conditions. Lower panel demonstrates the effects of
  the blockade of the interaction between a tumor cell and a lymphocyte T-cell when
  there is a PD1 and or PD-L1 inhibitor present (X). It shows the upregulation of
  autophagy as a defense mechanism.Abbreviations: IFNγR, interferon gamma receptor;
  MHC, major histocompatibility complex; PD1, programmed cell death receptor-1; PD-L1,
  programmed cell death receptor-1 ligand; TCR, T-cell receptor.'
