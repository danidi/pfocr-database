caption: Proposed pathomechanism of PXE. ABCC6 transporter mediates the efflux of
  ATP, which is metabolized by some ecto-nucleotidases (such as ENPP1) in AMP, which
  in turn is converted in adenosine and Pi by CD73. In the extracellular milieu, nucleotides
  regulate the activity of TNAP through the purinergic pathway and prevent the ectopic
  mineralization []. ABCC6, ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C, member 6; ENPP1, ecto-nucleotide
  pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase type I; CD73, cluster of differentiation 73; TNAP,
  tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase; Pi, inorganic phosphate; PPi, inorganic
  pyrophosphate [].
