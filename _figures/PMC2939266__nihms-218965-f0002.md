caption: Phosphoinositide signaling cycle, showing the generation of second messengers
  and the resynthesis of phosphatidylinositide substrates. Synthesized in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), phosphatidylinositol (PI) is transported by PI transport protein
  (PITP) to the cell membrane where it is phosphorylated to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate
  (PIP) and PI(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate) by respective kinases
  (PI4K and PI5K). A further phosphorylation of PI(4,5)P2 by PI-3-kinase yields PIP3
  (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5- trisphosphate) which functions to initiate downstream
  signaling via the Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) pathway. Phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated
  hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 generates the second messengers diacylglycerol (DG) and
  inositol trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 mobilizes calcium from the ER, resulting in activation
  of calcium-dependent calmodulin and downstream kinases (Ca/CamKs). DG activates
  protein kinase C (PKC) to initiate PKC-dependent downstream cascades, or DG could
  be converted to 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG), an endogenous ligand that initiates
  signaling via the CB1 endocannabinoid receptors. Sequential dephosphorylation of
  IP3 by respective phosphatases produces inositol bisphosphate (IP2), inositol monophosphate
  (IP1) and ultimately myo-inositol (inositol). DG not participating in immediate
  signaling is phosphorylated by DG kinase to produce phosphatidic acid (PA) which
  is then transported from the plasma membrane by unknown transport proteins to the
  ER. Here, the PA encounters cytidine triphosphate (CTP) formed by various nucleotide
  kinases from cytidine (or uridine) and, catalyzed by cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol
  (CDPDG) synthase (CDS), PA and CTP react to yield CDP-DG. PI synthase (PIS) then
  catalyzes CDPDG reaction with myo-inositol to regenerate PI, thus completing the
  cycle. The PI cycle is by far the most prolific signaling system, generating at
  least four downstream cascades mediated via Ca/CalmKs, PKC, 2AG, and PKB. And in
  all, the rate-limiting step is the synthesis of CDPDG from CTP and PA.
