caption: This figure illustrates some of the potential interactions of this pathway
  in lymphoid organs and in a cardiac allograft. (A), Tolerogenic DCs interact with
  naïve T cells and may induce either alloantigen-specific Tregs (iTregs) or decreased
  activation of effector T cell (T eff), depending on the presence (or absence) of
  TGF-β. (B), After activation by DCs in secondary lymphoid organs, alloantigen-specific
  effector T cells migrate to the graft where initial interaction with PD-L1 in the
  endothelium might inhibit T effector responses. Additional T eff cells that infiltrate
  the graft may be suppressed by iTregs or local cells expressing PD-L1 (APCs or non-hematopoieitic
  cells). Whether PD1/PDL1 on iTregs play a significant role in the direct suppression
  of T eff remains to be determined. Other potential costimulatory interactions are
  not depicted in this figure for simplicity.
