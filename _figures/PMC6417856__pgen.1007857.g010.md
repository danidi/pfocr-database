caption: The main findings are illustrated (A). Neuromuscular synapses (NMJs) are
  normally formed as a tripartite structure including a presynaptic nerve terminal
  (green), a postsynaptic muscle (orange) and a Schwann cell (glia, pink). Schwann
  cells are essential for the formation of the NMJ; in the absence of Schwann cells,
  nerve terminals withdraw from muscles, resulting in synapse loss (synapse degeneration)
  and muscle denervation (as shown in CRD-Nrg1−/−mice). These defects are rescued
  by (1) a blockade of evoked neurotransmitter release (CRD-Nrg1−/−Snap25−/−); (2)
  a blockade of neurotransmitter synthesis (CRD-Nrg1−/−Chat−/–); (3) a blockade of
  post-synaptic AChRs (CRD-Nrg1−/−Chrna1−/−); (4) a blockade of muscle dihydropyridine
  receptors (CRD-Nrg1−/−Cacnb1−/−); and (5) a blockade of muscle ryanodine receptor
  1 (CRD-Nrg1−/−Ryr1−/−). These genetic rescues reveal a common pathway (B) that ultimately
  leads to muscle activity mediated by DHPR/Ryr1. Therefore, a blockade of muscle
  activity is the key to rescuing muscle denervation/synapse loss in the absence of
  Schwann cells. Together, these genetic manipulations indicate that the blockade
  of muscle activity prevents muscle denervation and neuromuscular synapse loss caused
  by CRD-NRG1 deficiencies in mice.
