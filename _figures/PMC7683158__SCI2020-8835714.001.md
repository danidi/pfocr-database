caption: The SUMOylation pathway. All SUMO paralogues are synthesized as preproteins
  which are first cleaved by sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) and then exposed to
  the carboxy-terminal diglycine (GG) motif. By consuming an ATP for activation by
  E1 (SAE1-SAE2), resulting in formation of a SUMO E1 thioester complex. The formation
  of a SUMO E1 thioester complex can be blocked by ginkgolic acid, anacardic acid,
  and kerriamycin B. SUMO is transferred to SUMO E2 and linked to a thioester, which
  can be inhibited by spectomycin B1. SUMO can be directly transferred to the target
  protein by Ubc9, or sometimes SUMO E3 ligases are also required to connect SUMO
  to the target proteins at their lysine residues, which can be inhibited by 2-D08
  and reversed by SENPs.
