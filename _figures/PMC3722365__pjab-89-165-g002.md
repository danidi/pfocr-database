caption: Some unique reactions catalyzed by P450 enzymes found in the IQA pathway.
  CYP719A1 from C. japonica catalyzes the oxidative cyclization of an ortho-hydroxymethoxy-substituted
  aromatic ring (i.e. methylenedioxy bridge formation) and converts only tetrahydrocolumbamine
  to (S)-tetrahydroberberine. CjCYP80G2 not only catalyzes the intramolecular C-C
  phenol coupling reaction and converts (S)-reticuline to (S)-corytuberine, but also
  4-O-demethylates codamine to form the demethylated product. The reaction mechanism
  has been discussed in the text.
