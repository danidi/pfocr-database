caption: 'In this scheme the product of MenA is depicted as the quinone rather than
  the quinol. This is consistent with the majority of the MK literature (), which
  indicates that the oxidation from quinol to quinone is spontaneous, but differs
  from UQ synthesis. The arrows indicate C2 and C3 of MK-9(II−H2). Abbreviations used:
  DHNA, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate; DHNA-CoA, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA; OSB,
  o-succinylbenzoate; OSB-CoA, o-succinylbenzoyl-CoA ; SEPHCHC, 2-succinyl-5-enolpyruvyl-6-hydroxy-3-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate;
  SHCHC, 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate.'
