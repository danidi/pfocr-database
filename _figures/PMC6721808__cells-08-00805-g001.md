caption: 'Simplified scheme of the cellular metabolism pathways important for AML
  pathophysiology. Names in colored boxes indicate major metabolic pathways. Oxidation
  of glucose in the course of glycolysis (orange box) generates carbon intermediates
  that can be metabolized in the pentose-phosphate-pathway (PPP, dark red box) and
  one-carbon metabolism (1C, blue box), both generating substrates for nucleotide
  biosynthesis. Parts of PPP as well as reactions catalyzed by IDH and malic enzymes
  are the main producer of cytosolic NADPH. Enzymatic degradation of fructose by fructolysis
  (yellow box) provides carbon intermediates for the glycolytic pathway as well as
  substrates for lipid synthesis. Acetyl-CoA, generated by glycolysis, fructolysis
  or fatty acid β-oxidation (green box), is the starting point for the mitochondrial
  tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA, purple circle), which is essential to ensure oxidative
  phosphorylation (OXPHOS, red box). Acetyl-CoA is used for the condensation reaction
  of oxaloacetate to citrate. Citrate can be further processed to generate cytosolic
  acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis (grey box). Furthermore, TCA cycle intermediates,
  e.g., oxaloacetate, are linked to the urea cycle, an important arginine source.
  In contrast, anaplerotic reactions, such as glutaminolysis (dark blue box), replenish
  the TCA cycle. Additionally, glutaminolysis is important for the synthesis of glutathione,
  a major player in maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. The exchange of glutamine
  to branched chain amino acids (especially leucine) is known to be a main activator
  of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, directly linking
  metabolites to anabolic growth programs resulting in nucleotide, lipid and, in particular,
  protein synthesis. Single arrows indicate preferred direction of reactions of the
  main pathways, while multiple arrows indicate multiple reaction steps. Abbreviations:
