caption: A. The network predicted with methods of neighborhood, gene fusion, co-occurrence,
  co-expression, experiments, databases and text-mining. This network was enriched
  in interaction with a p-value of 5.55E-15. B. The network predicted only with experiments.
  Disconnected nodes were hidden. This network was not enriched in interaction. C.
  KEGG pathway related to cervical cancer. Only the part related to results of this
  study is plotted. This graph was reorganized based on viral carcinogenesis (hsa05203)
  from KEGG.
