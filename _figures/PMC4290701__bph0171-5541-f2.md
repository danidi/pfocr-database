caption: Functional role of PI3K and PTEN in chemotaxis. (A) Spatial-temporal regulation
  of PTEN and PI3K induces cell polarization in response to a chemoattractant signal.
  When cells sense the chemoattractant signal, a signalling pathway yet to be identified
  promotes the rapid translocation of PI3K to the leading edge facing the higher chemoattractant
  concentration and the delocalization of PTEN from the leading edge. Therefore, PI(3,4,5)P3
  is synthesized from PI(4,5)P2 at the leading edge and prevented from accumulating
  on the sides and at the back of the cell by PTEN, causing a very steep anterior/posterior
  PI(3,4,5)P3 gradient. (B) Chemotaxis signal pathway in Dictyostelium and neutrophils.
  Binding of chemoattractant to G-protein coupled receptors releases the Gα heterodimer
  from the heterotrimeric Gα proteins. Dissociated Gα proteins stimulate PI(3,4,5)P3
  production via PI3K and lead to membrane translocation of PI(3,4,5)P3-binding ABPs,
  probably the members of myosin I. Finally, there is remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton
  at the leading edge required for the formation of novel cell protrusions.
