caption: Ergosterol synthesis pathway (left) and transcription levels that correspond
  to different pathway genes (right). Downregulation of genes (green) or minimal change
  (black) is shown. All genes are aligned on the right for both strains. Downregulation
  of ERG genes is more common in the ndh51Δ mutant than in the goa1Δ mutant. P, phosphate;
  PP, pyrophosphate.
