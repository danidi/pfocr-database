caption: a | To promote antigen-specific immune responses during priming in the lymphoid
  organs, distinctive co-stimulatory pathways can be engaged, such as CD28, CD137
  (also known as 4-1BB), CD27, OX40 and CD40, by agonistic reagents or through blockade
  of the primary early checkpoint receptor cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4)
  by an antagonist. Vice versa, the CD28 co-stimulatory pathway can also be blocked
  by CTLA4–immunoglobulin (Ig) to inhibit T cell activation. b | To expand effector
  T cells or restore exhausted T cells in the peripheral organs, peripheral inhibitory
  pathways can be blocked, including the pathway mediated by B7 homolog 1 (B7H1) and
  programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), B7H4, lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3)
  as well as B- and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA); alternatively, co-stimulatory
  receptors on effector T cells — such as CD137 and OX40 — can be activated. mAb,
  monoclonal antibody.
