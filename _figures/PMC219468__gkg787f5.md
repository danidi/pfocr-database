caption: 'Detected regulatory circuits. (a) Known direct regulatory circuits. Gal4–Gal80
  comprises a negative feedback circuit (see text). The Swi6–Swi4 circuit functions
  to switch on a new pathway: the transcription of SWI4 depends on Swi6. The complex
  Swi4–Swi6 (called SBF) is responsible for the transcription of SWI4 as well as for
  the synthesis of other genes that function in late G1, thus enabling the progression
  of the cell cycle (,). (b) Known regulatory circuits of order 2 (see text). (c)
  Regulatory circuits of higher orders. Ste12 and Far1 define a known regulatory circuit
  of order 4 that is part of the mating pheromone response pathway () and Swi4 and
  Hog1 define a putative regulatory circuit of order 3. In the Ste12–Far1 circuit,
  purple arrows mark protein–protein interactions that are part of the known circuit,
  but are not detected by our method since we are looking for the shortest path between
  Ste12 and Far1. A complex of Ste4–Ste18 released from activated pheromone receptors
  recruits three essential regulators to the plasma membrane, and tethers them in
  close juxtaposition: a scaffold protein, Far1, that carries the guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor (Cdc24) for the Cdc42 small GTPase; a Cdc42-activated protein kinase
  Ste20; and a scaffold protein, Ste5, that carries the three-tiered module of protein
  kinases (Ste11, Ste7, Fus3). The close juxtaposition enables the following interaction
  series, Cdc24–Cdc42–Ste20–Ste11–Ste7–Kss1–Ste12, which results in the activation
  of Ste12. The activated Ste12 is a transcription factor of FAR1, as well as of many
  other genes involved in the pheromone response pathway. (Conventionally, the pathway
  is described by the interactions of proteins Fus3 and Dig1/Dig2 with Ste12 instead
  of Kss1, and we would have detected it if we did not look for the shortest path.)
