caption: Filoviruses enter the host cell via micropinocytosis and escape the endosome
  (depicted as a circle containing a virus). The viral genome escapes into the cytoplasm
  where replication reactions occur. Products of viral RNA synthesis, which may include
  RNAs with dsRNA features (depicted) and RNA with 5′-triphosphates are recognized
  by RIG-I or MDA5. This, aided by host protein PACT, activates RIG-I or MDA5 signaling
  and stimulates a signaling pathway that leads to activation of kinases IKKε and
  TBK1. These phosphorylate interferon regulator factors 3 or 7 (IRF3/7) which then
  dimerize, move to the nucleus and contribute to IFN-α/β gene expression. VP35 can
  bind to dsRNA, can block PACT activation of RIG-I and can prevent IKKε and TBK1
  phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IRF-7.
