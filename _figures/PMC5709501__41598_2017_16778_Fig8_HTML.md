caption: Working model of neutrophil-macrophage crosstalk via NET-bound HMGB1 during
  activation of neutrophils by mineralo-organic particles. When exposed to mineral
  particles, neutrophils interact with the particulate matters, which in turn lead
  to ROS production and NETosis. The released NETs deliver danger signals to bystander
  macrophages via NET-bound HMGB1. The NET-bound HMGB1 signals via a TLR2/TLR4-dependent
  pathway and initiates pro-inflammatory signaling cascades in the macrophages, resulting
  in inflammation via secretion of TNF-α.
