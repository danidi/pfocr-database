caption: ACE inhibitors, ARB and Statins act effectively as antioxidants to inhibit
  inflammatory and growth pathways. Blockade of activation of the angiotensin II Type
  1 receptor (AT1R) by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or by AT1R
  blockers (ARB) inhibits AngII generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting
  from the inhibition of NOX. These anti-oxidation effects decrease local and systemic
  inflammation. Statins also inhibit NOX but by a different pathway. The small GTPase
  RAC is a critical component of the NOX complex but must be recruited to the cell
  membrane to complete the activation of the oxidase. The translocation to the cell
  membrane of RAC requires its modification by geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (GG-PP)
  that enables formation of the active NOX holoenzyme. GG-PP formation is inhibited
  by statins. Both statins and AngII blockers are therapeutically effective individually
  and synergistically in multiple disease phenotypes that share ROS-mediated inflammation
  as a common causal mechanism.
