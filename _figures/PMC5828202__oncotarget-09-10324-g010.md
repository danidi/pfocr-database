caption: Binding of TRAIL to DR5 leads to activation of the caspase cascade system,
  and silibinin enhances TRAIL sensitivity for apoptosis. Silibinin stimulates ER
  stress along with PERK-eIF2α-ATF4, which may open Ca2+ channels on the ER by activating
  CHOP. Consequently, cytosolic Ca2+ influx in response to silibinin induces Ca2+-sensitive
  CaMKII. CaMKII directly upregulates DR5 expression or indirectly links with the
  Sp1 pathway, causing sensitization of cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.
