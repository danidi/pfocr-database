caption: Schematic diagram describing a proposed mechanism for the differential induction
  of different forms of LTP by Ca2+. Weak conditioning stimulation (e.g. 1 TBS) activates
  NMDARs resulting in a modest influx of Ca2+ into the spine, which in turn activates
  Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptors (RyR). CICR is proposed
  to activate kinases in the PSD that underlie the expression of LTP 1. Stronger stimulation
  (e.g. 2–4 TBS) can additionally recruit an IP3-dependent signalling pathway by activation
  of mGluRs. Ca2+ release from IP3Rs in the dendrites, possibly combined with other
  G-protein-coupled mechanisms (e.g. protein kinase C (PKC)), is proposed to activate
  local dendritic protein synthesis that supports the expression of LTP 2. The NMDAR
  gates IP3R activation, possibly via extrasynaptic NMDARs. Repetitive activation
  of L-VDCCs (e.g. by 5–8 TBS) causes significant Ca2+ peaks in the nucleus, which
  are proposed to trigger the gene transcription necessary for the expression of LTP
  3.
