caption: Simplified pathway of steroid hormone biosynthesis and the role of CYP17A1.
  CYP17A1 encodes the enzyme cytochrome P-450c17α (CYP17) that catalyzes steroid 17α-hydroxylase
  and 17,20-lyase activities and is hence essential for the synthesis of glucocorticoids
  (17α-hydroxylase activity) and sex steroids (17,20 lyase activity). Adapted from
  Molina and Belldegrun, 2011 [].
