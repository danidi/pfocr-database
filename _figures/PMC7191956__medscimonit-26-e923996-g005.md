caption: Tomatidine-targeted genes-related part of the top five shared KEGG pathways.
  (A) Tomatidine-targeted genes-related part of the chronic myeloid leukemia pathway.
  p53 signaling pathway was involved in the process, resulting in proliferation, increased
  survival, and genomic instability. (B) Tomatidine-targeted genes-related part of
  the B cell receptor signaling pathway, resulting in B cell ontogeny, autoimmunity,
  anergy, immuno response, Ig production, and GC formation. (C) Tomatidine-targeted
  genes-related part of the pathway in cancer. p53 signaling pathway was involved
  in the process, resulting in proliferation, sustained angiogenesis and evading apoptosis.
  (D) Tomatidine-targeted genes-related part of the bladder cancer pathway. p53 and
  MAPK signaling pathways are involved in the process, resulting in G1/S progression.
  (E) Tomatidine-targeted genes-related part of the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation
  pathway. MAPK signaling pathway was involved in the process, resulting in metaphase
  II arrest.
