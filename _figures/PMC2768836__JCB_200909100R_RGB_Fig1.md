caption: 'Role of clathrin adaptor proteins in melanosome biogenesis. Post-Golgi trafficking
  routes of three melanosome cargoes (Pmel17, tyrosinase, and Tyrp1) in melanocytes
  are shown. Newly synthesized Pmel17 is transported to the limiting membrane and
  intraluminal vesicles of stage I melanosomes/early sorting endosomes via the plasma
  membrane. This process (depicted by a question mark) might involve clathrin and
  AP-2. From these EEA1-positive vacuolar endosomes, Pmel17 is sorted away from the
  late endosome/multivesicular body pathway into stage II melanosomes. Little is known
  as to how the enzymes essential for melanin synthesis, tyrosinase and Tyrp1, are
  sorted from the TGN to early REs, and it is likely that clathrin and its adaptors
  are involved in this process. Tyrosinase, which binds both AP-1 and -3, is transported
  to stage III melanosomes from tubular regions of REs, containing Tf/TfR and Rab11,
  by two distinct routes: one regulated by AP-3 and the other regulated by BLOC-1,
  BLOC-2, and perhaps AP-1. However, Tyrp1 binds only AP-1 and not AP-3, indicating
  a divergence of sorting mechanisms between tyrosinase and Tyrp1.  now show that
  AP-1 interacts with the kinesin motor KIF13A to transport recycling endosomal domains
  to the melanocytic cell periphery. The close apposition of Tyrp1-containing tubules
  with melanosomes allows cargo transfer and biogenesis of stage III and IV melanosomes.
  Although Tf is found in these peripheral endosomal tubules, there appears to be
  a filtering mechanism that sorts it out before the tubules fuse with melanosomes.
  It is likely, although not yet confirmed, that BLOC-1 and -2 act in concert with
  AP-1 to transport Tyrp1. The tissue-specific Rabs, Rab32 and Rab38, might function
  in any or all of these pathways.'
