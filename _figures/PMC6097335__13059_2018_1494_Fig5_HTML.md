caption: Model of EnhAP1-OIS1 regulation of OIS. a In normal BJ fibroblast cells,
  hyper-activation of RAS induces MAPK signaling cascade, including AP-1 TFs. Activated
  AP-1 TFs control different cellular functions, including cell proliferation and
  apoptosis. AP1 is recruited, among other enhancers, to EnhAP1-OIS1 and stimulates
  its activity. This, in turn, promotes the expression of the target gene FOXF1, diverting
  oncogenic signals into the pre-senescent pathway. b Mutagenesis of the AP-1 binding
  site in EnhAP1-OIS1 abrogates its enhancer activity and thus leads to decreased
  expression of FOXF1. This results in compromised induction of OIS and thus cells
  continue uncontrolled cell proliferation []
