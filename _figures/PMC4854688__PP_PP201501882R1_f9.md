caption: Working model for the role of ZAT6 in regulating Cd accumulation and tolerance.
  Cd stress quickly induces the expression of ZAT6, which directly binds to the promoter
  of GSH1 and actives its expression, thereby triggering Cd-activated  synthesis,
  which results in enhanced Cd accumulation and tolerance.
