caption: Model for an alternative Okazaki fragment-processing pathway in vivo. A,
  during DNA replication, at a sequence that has the potential to form secondary structure,
  a fold-back will form in the template DNA. The Okazaki fragment downstream of the
  fold-back is synthesized normally. A primer is laid down upstream of the template
  secondary structure. Note that the RNA portion of the primer is not depicted for
  simplicity. B, pol δ will be slowed as it extends the primer through the secondary
  structure. A gap between the extended primer and the downstream primer will remain.
  C, meanwhile, the fragment upstream of the internal fragment will be synthesized
  normally. D, when it reaches the internal fragment, flap lengthening factors, such
  as Pif1 activity or acetylation of the nucleases, may create a long flap. The long
  flap will then fold-back on itself. Neither the FEN1-only pathway nor the two-nuclease
  pathway can process the fold-back flap. E, Pif1 will bind a gap between the fold-back
  and the remaining downstream annealed region and, working with strand displacement
  synthesis from the upstream primer, unwind the entire internal Okazaki fragment.
  This synthesis will convert the fold-back region of the template to double strands
  that will no longer be capable of forming secondary structure. F, pol δ will then
  continue synthesis through the gap until it reaches the downstream fragment. G,
  conventional flap processing will produce a nick that LigI will then seal. The red
  lines represent segments with potential to form secondary structures.
