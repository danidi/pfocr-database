caption: Major pathways for ATP generation in innate immune cells. Glucose and free
  fatty acids are the primary sources of energy for innate immune cells. Glucose is
  metabolised by glycolysis (pink) when the cellular ATP requirement is high and nucleotide
  flux is high e.g. for phagocytosis. The release of glucose from glycogen to meet
  this demand also fuels the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP; blue). The PPP generates
  the reduced nucleotide NADPH that is essential for reducing enzyme (e.g. glutathione
  reductase) and NADPH oxidase activity. Products of the pentose phosphate pathway
  can fuel five carbon sugar metabolism and feed back into the glycolytic pathway
  as pyruvate. After shuttling into the mitochondrion (yellow), the citric acid cycle
  catalyses further carbon oxidation and generation of the reducing equivalents NADH
  and FADH2 which are substrates for oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, succinyl
  and acetyl CoA can promote enzyme catalysed post-translational succinylation and
  acetylation of proteins within and outside of the mitochondrion. Tightly coupled
  mitochondria harness the proton gradient generated across the membrane during nucleotide
  oxidation to generate ATP. When mitochondria are less well coupled, superoxide anion
  radicals may be formed by single electron leakage to molecular oxygen. This is most
  likely to occur at complex 1. The generation of energy by innate immune cells is
  intimately related to the cellular redox state.
