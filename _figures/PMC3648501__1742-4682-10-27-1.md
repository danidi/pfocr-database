number: Figure 1
caption: Schematic diagram of the Notch signaling pathway. The diagram was created
  using CellDesigner. The light green rectangle represents protein; the bottle green
  parallelogram represents mRNA; the white rectangle that contains a light green rectangle
  represents a complex; ∅ represents the resultant of a degradation reaction or reactant
  of a combination reaction. The arrow represents the reaction.
