caption: Expression of PKM2 promotes glucose uptake and lactate production and inhibits
  O2 consumption in cancer cells, by coactivation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)-mediated
  gene transcription. Expression of the less active PKM2 dimer leads to the accumulation
  of upstream glycolytic metabolites, which include 3-phosphoglycerate (3-P-glycerate)
  that stimulates serine synthesis, and phosphoenopyruvate (PEP) and glucose-6-phosphate
  that stimulate the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), thereby promoting macromolecule
  biosynthesis and inhibiting intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.
  PKM2 also translocates into the nucleus to stimulate the activity of transcription
  factors including HIF-1, HIF-2, β-catenin, STAT3, and Oct-4, thereby increasing
  the expression of gene products that are required for tumor growth.
