caption: Protein O-GlcNAcylation depends on the flux of glucose through the hexosamine
  biosynthesis pathway. A small fraction of the glucose entering the cell feeds the
  hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) to produce UDP-GlcNAc, the substrate used
  by O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) to add N-acetyl glucosamine on serine or threonine
  residues of cytosolic or nuclear proteins. This dynamic and reversible post-translational
  modification controls the activity, the localization, or the stability of proteins
  according to glucose availability. Glucose enters the HBP as fructose-6-phosphate.
  The latter is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate by the glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate
  amidotransferase (GFAT), the rate limiting enzyme of the pathway. After a subset
  of reactions, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is generated and used by OGT
  to add GlcNAc on serine or threonine residues of target proteins. The O-GlcNAc moiety
  is removed from O-GlcNAc-modified proteins by the O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Experimentally,
  O-GlcNAcylation of proteins can be increased by incubating the cells with high concentrations
  of glucose, or with glucosamine, which bypass the rate limiting step catalyzed by
  GFAT. Inhibitors of OGA such as O-[2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene] amino-N-phenylcarbamate
  (PUGNAc) or (3aR,5R,6S,7R,7aR)-2-(ethylamino)-3a,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-5-(hydroxymethyl)-5H-Pyrano[3,2-d]thiazole-6,7-diol
  (Thiamet-G) can also be used to increase the O-GlcNAc level on proteins.
