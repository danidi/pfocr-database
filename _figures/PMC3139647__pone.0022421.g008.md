caption: The cell wall damaging agents (e.g. NaCl, KCl, MgCl2) activate the cell wall
  integrity MAPK Pmk1, then the activated Pmk1 phosphorylates Cch1, resulting in the
  opening of the Cch1-Yam8 channel and in Ca2+ influx. In the absence of FK506, the
  increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ level activates calcineurin, which in turn dephosphorylates
  Cch1, resulting in the closing of the channel. In the presence of FK506, calcineurin
  is inhibited, thus resulting in the persistent opening of the Cch1-Yam8 channels.
  Trp1322 and Pkd2 directly regulates calcium influx, and also may crosstalk with
  other components of the Pmk1 MAPK pathway upstream of Pek1, thus indirectly affecting
  the Cch1-Yam8 complex upon NaCl plus FK506 stimulation.
