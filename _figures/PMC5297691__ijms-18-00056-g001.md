caption: Canonical Notch signaling pathway. Notch receptors are heterodimeric cell
  membrane proteins containing a 200-kDa extracellular subunit and a 120-kDa fragment
  that includes a transmembrane and an intracellular domain. Notch receptors are activated
  by trans-membrane ligands expressed on the surface of neighboring cells. Upon ligand
  binding, two proteolytic cleavages occur. The first cleavage takes place 12 amino
  acids outside the trans-membrane domain by metalloproteinase TACE/ADAM10. The resultant
  Notch COOH-terminal fragment, called NEXT (Notch extracellular truncation), is required
  for the second cleavage performed by γ-secretase within the trans-membrane region.
  This last proteolytical event releases a 65–95 kDa Notch intracellular domain (NICD)
  from the 120-kDa fragment. NICD molecular weight is highly dependent on the Notch
  receptor that is cleaved. NICD translocates to the nucleus, interacts with DNA binding
  proteins and transactivates target genes.
