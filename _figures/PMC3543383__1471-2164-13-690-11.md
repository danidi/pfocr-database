caption: One-carbon unit production in P. carbinolicus. One-carbon units carried by
  tetrahydrofolate (THF) derive from serine, producing glycine. In the absence of
  the glycine cleavage complex, excess glycine might be deaminated to glyoxalate by
  aminotransferases using pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLPO). Fusion of two glyoxalate
  molecules by glyoxalate carboligase, rearrangement to hydroxypyruvate with the aid
  of glutathione (GT), and amination would regenerate serine. An alternative pathway
  involving phosphorylation allows hydroxypyruvate to enter glycolysis to be catabolized.
