caption: Model of Aly1- and Aly2-dependent, nutrient-regulated, Gap1 trafficking.
  Under nitrogen replete conditions, the majority of Gap1 is trafficked from the TGN
  to the endosome/vacuole without ever transiting the PM; Aly1/Aly2-dependent endosomal
  recycling of Gap1 is reduced, but contributes to overall Gap1 levels by diverting
  a portion of the permease from the endosome/vacuolar pathway. Npr1 is inactive.
  Under nitrogen starvation conditions, newly synthesized Gap1 transits from the TGN
  to PM, and Gap1 recycling from endosomal compartments is up-regulated. Npr1 is active.
  Aly1 and Aly2 mediate trafficking of Gap1 from endosomal compartments back to the
  TGN and/or the PM through two distinct pathways. Aly2 requires AP-1, Lst4, and Npr1
  to mediate Gap1 recycling, and is proposed to operate in endosome-to-TGN trafficking
  based on the known activities of Lst4 and AP-1 in this interval. Aly1 functions
  independently of known recycling factors and may regulate Gap1 recycling from endosomes
  through multiple pathways that either go to the TGN and/or directly back to the
  PM. Black lines denote Gap1 trafficking paths, with thicker lines indicating the
  predominant trafficking pathways in that nutrient condition.
