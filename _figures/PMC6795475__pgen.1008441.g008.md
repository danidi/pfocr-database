caption: Model of histone deposition coupled to recombination-dependent replication.
  Upon fork arrest, HR factors promote D-loop formation which primes the restarted
  DNA synthesis and histone deposition. Histone deposition coupled to RDR allows JMs
  to be protected from disassembly by DNA helicases such as Rqh1. This fork-associated
  histone deposition pathway to stabilize recombination intermediates contributes
  to replication recovery and balances genome stability at site of replication stress.
