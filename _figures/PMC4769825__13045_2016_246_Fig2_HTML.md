caption: Schematic illustration of pathways associated with Nrf2 signal. Keap1 assembles
  Cullin 3 and binds to the ETGE and DLG sites of Nrf2 through Kelch domain, leading
  to the degradation of Nrf2. In the absence of Keap1, Nrf2 translocates from cytoplasm
  to nuclear to bind with ARE in the promoter region of target gene, leading to the
  transcriptional activation of genes related to inflammation, detoxication, and metabolic
  regulation. However, Nrf2 activity could be modified by acetylation and deacetylation
  through NF-kappa B or ER pathway. Nrf2 activity could also be inhibited by Bach1
  through competitively binding with ARE. Mutant K-ras promotes Nrf2 transcriptional
  through TPA responsive element. Several microRNAs have been shown to inhibit Nrf2
  or Keap1. BTB Broad complex, Tramtrack, and Bric à brac, ARE antioxidant responsive
  element, ER estrogen receptor, Ub ubiquitin, CBP CREB-binding protein
