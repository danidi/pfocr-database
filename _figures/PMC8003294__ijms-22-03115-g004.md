caption: Neurosteroidogenesis pathway scheme. The biosynthetic pathway of neurosteroids
  is summarized. The enzymes that were transcriptionally expressed are in green boxes,
  except those at very low levels, which are in red boxes. A full arrow represents
  an enzymatic conversion that most probably occurred in the investigated microglial
  cells, whereas the dotted rows show a poorly represented one.
