caption: Figure 2. A cascade of cellular events triggered by distinct, but interconnected
  molecular systems, is required for mating and nuclear fusion. (A) Stimulation by
  mating pheromone (here, α-factor in the case of a MATa cell) of the G protein-coupled
  seven-transmembrane receptor Ste2 leads to the activation of the pheromone MAP kinase
  signaling pathway, consisting of the scaffold protein Ste5 and the three canonical
  MAP kinases Ste11, Ste7 and Fus3. Fus3 regulates a number of cytoplasmic proteins
  and nuclear transcriptional regulators, thereby triggering cell cycle arrest and
  the expression of factors needed for mating. Prior the activation of the mating
  program and cell polarization, MTs are anchored at the SPB, through the interaction
  of the γ-tubulin receptor Spc72 with the SPB protein Nud1. (B) Upon pheromone stimulation,
  MTs are relocated from the SPB to the half-bridge (HB) via the interaction of Spc72
  with Kar1. Concomitantly, Myo2 linked to the MT plus end-tracking protein Bim1 through
  the adaptor protein Kar9 moves MTs along polarized actin cables and therefore orients
  the nucleus toward the shmoo tip. At the shmoo tip, the MT plus ends interact persistently
  via the interaction of plus end-located Kar3 with the Gα subunit of the Ste2 receptor.
  Simultaneously, a mating specific cytoplasmic Cik1 form is expressed, heterodimerizes
  with Kar3 and binds to Spc72. (C) After cell-cell fusion, MTs protrude into the
  cytoplasm of the mating partner. When they reach the opposite SPB, they interact
  with Spc72-anchored Kar3 and the congression of the haploid nuclei starts. Possibly,
  MT plus end-located Kar3 interacts transiently with MTs from the mating partner
  to guide the MTs before they reach the opposite SPB. (D) When the two nuclei become
  close enough, nuclear and SPB fusion is initiated in a three-step pathway. First,
  the outer nuclear membrane fuses, initiated by Prm3 and facilitated by Kar5. In
  a second step, the inner nuclear membrane fuses using Kar2 and Kar8. Only finally
  is the SPB fusion occurring (for more details about nuclear and SPB fusion see refs.,).
