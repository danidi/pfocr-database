caption: “Supermature” focal adhesions, SMA (α-smooth muscle actin), MRTF/SRF (myocardin-related
  transcription factor/serums response factor) pathway, and the nucleus. Double arrows
  refer to communication in both directions. Single arrows refer to communication
  in one direction. “Upstream” and “downstream” refer to the relative locations of
  each component in the cascade.
