caption: FGF19 and FGF21 treatment of NASH. The effect on hepatic steatosis, inflammation
  and fibrosis seem to be mediated via activation of the FGFR1c/KLB complex in the
  CNS and in the adipose tissue. FGF21 has been shown to decrease insulin release
  which will increase hepatic beta-oxidation and decrease DNL. FGF21 is furthermore
  a strong inducer of adiponectin release which has been shown to have several beneficial
  effects on NASH. FGF21 also increases the antioxidant capacity of the liver and
  increase the mitochondrial function. In addition, FGF21 lowers plasma TG, LDLc,
  and increases plasma HDLc. FGF19 has also been shown to activate the FGFR1c/KLB
  pathway but in addition FGF19 decreases bile acids synthesis via FGFR4/KLB activation,
  which has beneficial effect on NASH. It is unknown, if FGF21 activates the FGFR4/KLB
  complex and if other FGFRs (FGFR2c and FGFR3c) expressed in liver are involved in
  direct action of FGF19 or FGF21.
