caption: Metabolic adaptations to acute metabolic stresses in the tumor microenvironment
  changes central carbon metabolism flow and exposes vulnerabilities. A) Under normoxic
  conditions proline residues on HIF1ɑ are hydroxylated by PHDs, thus creating recognition
  sites for VHL, which ubiquitinates HIF1ɑ marking it for proteasomal degradation.
  Lack of oxygen prevents hydroxylation and degradation. HIF1ɑ stabilization leads
  to activation of a transcriptional program that increased glycolytic flux and shunts
  pyruvate towards glucose. Glutamine is funneled into the Krebs cycle and frequently
  used for fatty acid synthesis through reductive flux. Due to the higher turnover
  of glutamine, targeting GLS1 or CAD are trialed as therapeutic approaches. The former
  precludes a source of nutrients, the latter leads to an accumulation of ammonia.
  B) A high ATP/AMP ratio leads to binding of ATP to AMPK thus rendering it inactive.
  Growth stimuli and oncogenes can engage growth programs unabatedly. A drop of this
  ratio, leads to AMP binding to AMPK, which allows LKB1 to phosphorylate and activate
  it. AMPK can quench biosynthetic pathways and engage energy production, by boosting
  nutrient utilization in the Krebs cycle, including glucose, glutamine, and fatty
  acids, as well as nutrient uptake via transporters. LKB1 is frequently mutated in
  lung and cervical cancers, leading to failed engagement of LKB1. Persistent stress
  can, however, re-engage AMPK via a Calcium dependent AMP independent pathway carried
  out by CaMKK2. Thus, tumors frequently retain parts of this stress response pathway.
  Drugs including metformin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) have
  been shown to re-engage AMPK as well and are in clinical trial as therapies. C)
  The mTOR complex needs signals both from afferent proliferative pathways as well
  as nutrient sensors to be fully active. Once fully active, it engages a biosynthetic
  Warburg like metabolism with enhanced Glycolysis, pyruvate shunting into lactate,
  and increased glutaminolysis. mTor strongly inhibits autophagy, and inhibition of
  mTor induces autophagy leading to cell survival. Dual inhibition of mTor and autophagy
  is a promising drug combination. Note that some upstream activators can have mTor
  independent effects on metabolism that are not depicted. mTor is rarely mutated
  itself, allowing tumors to sense and react to nutrient depletion in tumors. When
  mTor is inhibited due to lack of nutrients, metabolism becomes more oxidative and
  autophagy is engaged, until amino acid levels have been replenished.
