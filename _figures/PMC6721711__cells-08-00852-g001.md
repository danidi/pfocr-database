caption: The multiple pathways available for the production of cellular ATP. In the
  cytoplasm of the cell, glycolysis generates four molecules of ATP for every two
  molecules of glucose invested. This is the pathway favored by fast replicating cells.
  In the mitochondrion, the processes of β-oxidation, the citric acid cycle and OXPHOS
  take place. OXPHOS is favored by cells with complex functions. Two molecules of
  ATP are generated by the citric acid cycle and 34 molecules are generated by OXPHOS
  (adapted from reference []).
