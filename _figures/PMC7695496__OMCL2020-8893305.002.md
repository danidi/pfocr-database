caption: The regulation of CH25H expression. In LPS-stimulated macrophages, Ch25h
  is induced via a TLR4/IRF3/IFN-β/STAT1 signaling pathway. In addition, anti-inflammatory
  transcriptional factor KLF4 transactivates Ch25h in vascular endothelial cells.
  On the contrary, transcriptional factor ATF3 represses Ch25h transcription via directly
  binding to the Ch25h promotor. Furthermore, in hepatocytes and peritoneal macrophages,
  25-HC induces CH25H expression in an LXR-dependent manner. Inflammatory cytokines
  IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 can also promote CH25H expression through the STAT1 transcription
  factor in virus-infected human macrophages (not shown).
