caption: Proposed mechanism utilized by HDACi to inhibit osteoblast-mediated protection
  of AML cells. In an osteoblast undergoing differentiation (cell on left), Nherf1
  is expressed at low levels and binds to PP1α to induce dephosphorylation of TAZ,
  which leads to the limited amount of TAZ nuclear localization required for the necessary
  gene transcription for osteoblast differentiation. In this scenario, the AML cells
  are protected from SDF-1 and proliferating. Because HDACi affect many genes globally,
  it is possible that multiple mechanisms contribute to the HDACi-modulated osteoblast-mediated
  inhibition of SDF-1-induced leukemia cell apoptosis. In the mechanism studied in
  detail here, HDACi-mediated increased expression of Nherf1 in differentiating osteoblasts
  (cell on right) leads to more Nherf1 binding PP1α, which enhances PP1α dephosphorylation
  of TAZ and increases TAZ nuclear localization. Higher levels of nuclear-localized
  TAZ alters gene transcription within osteoblasts such that the osteoblasts no longer
  protect the AML cells and the AML cells die in response to SDF-1 or other chemotherapeutics
  if present.
