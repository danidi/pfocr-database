caption: Complement is activated by three major pathways. The classical pathway is
  primarily activated when C1q interacts with IgM and certain IgG isotypes bound to
  antigen. C1q-associated C1s cleaves C4 and C2 to form the classical pathway (CP)
  C3 convertase (C4bC2a). The lectin pathway (LP) is initiated by carbohydrate pattern
  recognition receptors such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and the ficolins (F)
  which are in a complex with enzymes known as MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs).
  MASP-2 activates the complement system by cleaving both C4 and C2 to form the C4bC2a
  C3 convertase. The alternative pathway (AP) is activated by spontaneous hydrolysis
  of C3 (C3-H2O). This pathway also functions as an amplification loop for the cleavage
  of C3 initially triggered by other mechanisms. C3-H2O or C3b bound to target surfaces
  are bound by the protease factor B (fB). Factor D (fD) is a serine protease that
  cleaves C3-H2O or C3b-bound fB, resulting in the generation of Bb and formation
  of the alternative pathway C3 convertase (C3bBb). Both the classical and alternative
  convertases function to cleave C3 to C3a and C3b. Cleavage of C3 exposes a reactive
  thioester bond in C3b that allows for the covalent attachment of C3b to target surfaces.
  In addition, C3b can bind to either the classical or alternative C3 convertases
  resulting in a change of the substrate specificity of the convertases from C3 to
  C5. These C5 convertases cleave C5 to C5a and C5b. Release of C5b promotes assembly
  of the C5b-C9 membrane attack complex (MAC) which can directly lyse pathogens or
  pathogen-infected cells. C3b is further cleaved by factor I (fI), a function enhanced
  by factor H (fH), to generate degradation products such as iC3b and C3dg. C3b and
  its degradation products interact with cellular receptors to regulate effector functions
  such as phagocytosis and B cell activation. The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a interact
  with specific receptors to promote chemotaxis and regulate effector functions of
  cells of both the innate and adaptive immune response.
