caption: The mechanisms involved in the transformation from NSCLC to SCLC. They include
  RB1 loss, TP53 mutations, MYC amplification and alvelor type II cells proliferation.
  The most underlying signaling pathway is the ASCL1 target CDK5 activity and inactivation
  of RB by phosphorylation. With inactivated RB, p53 mutated cells have a selective
  advantage. ASCL1 = achaete-scute homolog 1, CDK5 = cyclin-dependent kinase 5, RB1 = retinoblastoma
  1, SCLC = small cell lung carcinoma.
