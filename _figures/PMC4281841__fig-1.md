caption: The schematic diagram of XBP1s production. Under normal circumstances, IRE1α
  is located on the ER membrane and binds to Grp78. Upon ER stress, IRE1α separates
  from Grp78 and oligomerizes, resulting in its autophosphorylation. Nascent XBP1u
  polypeptide recruits its own mRNA to the ER membrane through a hydrophobic region
  (HR) within XBP1u, facilitating the activated IRE1α to splice 26 nucleotides from
  the XBP1u mRNA. In addition, the C-terminus of XBP1u results in translational pausing
  (TP), which increases the efficiency of this process. After splicing, the generated
  2′,-3′-cyclic phosphate structure at the cleavage site is enzymatically joined to
  form the mature XBP1s mRNA. During the early UPR, eIF2α phosphorylation by PERK
  inhibits XBP1s mRNA translation. Then, both the number of XBP1s mRNAs generated
  by splicing and translation suppression result in the stabilization and slow turnover
  of XBP1s mRNA. During the progression of the UPR, eIF2α is dephosphorylated by GADD34,
  an ER-associated phosphatase regulatory subunit, and translation is then reinitiated,
  resulting in rapid XBP1s mRNA turnover. Finally, synthesized XBP1s protein stimulates
  XBP1 transcription and its nuclear translocation to mediate the transcription of
  additional factors through a positive feedback mechanism. In addition, XBP1u may
  interact with XBP1s to mediate its proteasomal degradation in the cytosol. eIF2α,
  eukaryotic initiation factor-2α; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IRE1, inositol-requiring
  enzyme 1; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase; UPR, unfolded protein response; XBP1, X-box
  binding protein 1; XBP1s, spliced XBP1; XBP1u, unspliced XBP1.
