caption: Homology modeling of Staphylococcus aureus phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs).
  (A) Alignment of amino acid sequences of PSMα1, PSMα2, PSMα3, PSMα4, PSMβ1, PSMβ2,
  and δ-toxin. Sequence alignments were generated using Clustal Omega. Conserved,
  conservative, and semiconservative substitutions are indicated using asterisks,
  colons, and periods, respectively. The three-dimensional model of PSMα1 (B), PSMα2
  (C), PSMα3 (D), PSMα4 (E), δ-toxin (F), PSMβ1 (G), and PSMβ2 (H) were generated
  by MODELLER. Side chains that may participate in salt bridges are shown explicitly.
  Secondary structural elements are depicted as ribbons (coils, α-helices; arrows,
  β-sheets). Color is based on secondary structures (α-helices, red; β-sheets, sky
  blue; loops, green). The side chains are shown as sticks with carbon, oxygen, and
  nitrogen colored gray, red, and blue.
