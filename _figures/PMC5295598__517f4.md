caption: Expression data mapped onto gene network generated using Cytoscape (). Protein-coding
  genes (circular nodes) were linked to their associated KEGG pathway (square nodes),
  and colored based on their Log2FC (fold change) under microoxic compared with control
  conditions, according to the gradational color bar shown in the top panel. (A) KEGG
  pathways relevant to our results. The blue rectangle in (A) marks the part of the
  network that is enlarged in (B), showing PSI, PSII, soluble electron carriers, and
  ATP synthase complexes.
