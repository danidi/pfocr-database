caption: 'A synopsis of intratumoral cholesterol metabolism. Cholesterol regulators
  assessed in this study are noted in bold; broken arrows indicate regulation and
  continuous arrows indicate metabolic steps. Transcellular cholesterol uptake is
  mediated mainly by endocytosis of cholesterol-laden low-density lipoproteins (LDL)
  via the LDL receptor (LDLR) and partly by endocytosis of cholesterol esters from
  high-density lipoproteins (HDL) via the HDL receptor (SCARB1) (,). LDLR levels are
  under tight control of PCSK9 () and IDOL (). The transporter ABCA1 mediates transcellular
  cholesterol efflux (). Intracellularly, cholesterol can be produced de novo via
  the mevalonate pathway with its rate-controlling enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme
  A reductase (HMGCR), the target of statin drugs (). The product of the mevalonate
  pathway, squalene, is then cyclicized and elaborated into cholesterol; this pathway
  is regulated by the activity of squalene monooxygenase (SQLE) (). Excess intracellular
  cholesterol can be esterified for storage in lipid droplets by sterol O-acyltransferase
  1 (gene name, SOAT1) (). Although SOAT1 is often referred to as ‘ACAT1’ (acyl-coenzyme
  A: cholesterol acyltransferase 1) (,), it should not be confused with the enzyme
  acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase encoded by ACAT1. Sterol regulatory element binding
  transcription factor 2 (SREBF2) is the main transcription factor that regulates
  cholesterol homeostasis (,).'
