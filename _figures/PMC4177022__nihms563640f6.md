caption: Proposed mechanism of testicular apoptotic response to x-ray exposure. The
  regulation of key apoptotic factors in the testis are shown following exposure to
  (A) 0.5 Gy x-ray (B) 1 Gy x-ray or (C) 2 Gy x-ray. Following 0.5 Gy exposure (A)
  the spermatogonial cells attempt adaptation to cell damage by simultaneously downregulating
  pro-and anti-apoptotic factors, resulting in a delay in apoptosis activation. With
  1 Gy (B) and 2 Gy (C) x-ray exposure, the pro-apoptotic signal is stronger, resulting
  in a more rapid onset of apoptosis.
