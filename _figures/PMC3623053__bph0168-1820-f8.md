caption: Proposed mechanisms underlying sildenafil neuroprotection against malonate-induced
  neurotoxicity. Inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase by malonate administration
  induces mitochondrial dysfunction, which triggers the generation of ROS. The increase
  in ROS production leads to the activation of ASK1, which, in turn, activates JNK
  and p38. Nuclear translocation of p38 contributes to neuronal death. Sildenafil
  afforded protection is independent of any change in ROS production but appears to
  be related to the inhibition of the ASK1–MKK3/6–p38 pathway.
