caption: 'SFRP5 at the crossroad between obesity, T2DM and CHD. As a member of the
  non‐canonical WNT family of proteins, WNT5A mainly activates WNT5A/Ca2+ and WNT5A/JNK
  signalling pathways. One branch of the non‐canonical signalling pathways involves
  the activation of small GTPases Rho and Rac. After WNT5A binds to FzR, activated
  DSH integrates Rho and Rac into it, respectively. Then, the DSH‐Rho and DSH‐Rac
  complexes activate JNK to regulate the PCP pathway. In addition, WNT5A can also
  bind to Ror2 to directly activate JNK to mediate the PCP pathway. This signalling
  branch has been shown to regulate cell orientation. Another branch, when activated,
  leads to PLC‐mediated increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels, which further activates
  CAMKII and PKC. This signalling branch has been demonstrated to mediate cell proliferation,
  migration and adhesion. Inflammation plays an important role in this process, which
  is from obesity, IR and ED to atherosclerosis. As we know, CHD has been regarded
  as an atherosclerosis‐related disease and the development of T2DM is significantly
  correlated with insulin resistance. Therefore, we propose that SFRP5, as an anti‐inflammatory
  adipokine, might link obesity, T2DM to CHD. Abbreviations: AS, atherosclerosis;
