caption: Signaling pathways in hepatocyte polarity. The relation between LKB1, AMPK
  and hepatocellular polarization is schematized based on experimental observations
  in sandwich cultured mouse hepatocytes (adapted from Homolya et al., 2014) . AMPK
  activation inhibits processes which utilize ATP with the exception of polarization
  machinery. In addition, protein catabolism is enhanced. How LKB1 participates in
  polarization and apical trafficking of ABCB11 and other ABC transporters is not
  known; however, the process is associated with AMPK activation and canalicular network
  formation. Taurocholate stimulates microtubular-dependent trafficking by activating
  the cAMP-Epac pathway, whereas, in Lkb1−/− mice, the stimulating effect of taurocholate
  and Epac is prevented; however, cAMP activation restores intracellular trafficking
  by a PKA-dependent mechanism which is independent of AMPK. PP2C-protein phosphatase
  2C removes phosphate from phosphor-AMPK. AICAR activates AMPK in a manner similar
  to cAMP.
