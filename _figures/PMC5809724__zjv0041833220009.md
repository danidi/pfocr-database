caption: Proposed model of CD63-mediated intersection between endosomal and autophagic
  processes. Endosomal intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) are dependent in part upon CD63
  for secretion as exosomes into the extracellular space. Alternatively, multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs) carrying ILVs can fuse to lysosomes for degradation, where mTORC1
  is activated. The autophagy pathway also converges on endosomal processes. Once
  autophagosomes mature from phagophores, they may fuse with MVBs to form amphisomes
  or autophagic vacuoles (AVs). AVs may also traffic to the plasma membrane to release
  EVs. Treatment of cells with chloroquine or wortmannin increases Epstein-Barr virus
  LMP1 secretion by inhibiting lysosomal acidification or phagophore formation, respectively,
  and results in decreased mTORC1 activation. Wortmannin also blocks EV uptake. Activation
  of autophagy by trehalose drives secretion of CD63-independent vesicles containing
  LMP1. Depletion of CD63 results in decreased EV secretion, likely shunting MVBs
  toward lysosomal or autophagosomal fusion. As a result, mTORC1 activation is increased
  and AVs accumulate in cells. Introduction of high levels of LMP1 drives late stages
  of autophagy and results in the acidification of AVs.
