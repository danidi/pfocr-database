caption: GAIT-mediated translational control. IFN-γ treatment elicits an intricate
  translational regulatory pathway in which the GAIT complex modulates the expression
  of its target mRNAs. (i) IFN-γ induces phosphorylation and release of EPRS (green)
  from the tRNA multisynthetase complex (yellow). Phosphorylated EPRS (P-EPRS) interacts
  with NSAP1 (light red) and forms an inactive, pre-GAIT complex. (ii) Later, L13a
  (dark blue) is phosphorylated and released from the 60S ribosomal subunit. Phosphorylated
  L13a (P-L13a), with GAPDH (brown), joins the pre-GAIT complex to form the functional
  GAIT complex. (iii) The complex binds the GAIT element in the 3′UTR of target transcripts
  circularized by simultaneous interactions of poly(A)-binding protein (PABP, gray)
  with eIF4G (orange) and the poly(A) tail. (iv) P-L13a interacts with eIF4G in the
  translation initiation complex to block recruitment of the eIF3 (light blue)-containing
  43S ribosomal complex subunit and repress translation. Cap-binding protein, eIF4E,
  is shown (dark orange).
