caption: Proposed model of the role of S1P during lung infection with C. neoformans
  Δgcs1 and C. neoformans H99. (A) In C. neoformans Δgcs1 infection, TNF-α stimulates
  resident macrophages to produce S1P from sphingosine (SPH) by the action of SK1.
  S1P contributes to phagocytosis and extracellular killing of C. neoformans cells
  and stimulates the production of MCP-1. MCP-1 recruits activated macrophages and
  other phagocytes, leading to a strong immune response. (B) In C. neoformans H99
  infection, TNF-α and S1P levels are significantly reduced, leading to a reduction
  in the level of MCP-1 generation. This in turn hampers immune cell recruitment,
  phagocytosis, and extracellular killing and allows the fungus to proliferate and
  disseminate throughout the body.
