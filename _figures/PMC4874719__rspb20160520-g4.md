caption: A proposed metabolic model and peroxisome remodelling in Euglenozoa. (a)
  Peroxisomes (Px) and mitochondria (Mt) have been present in the last eukaryotic
  common ancestor (LECA), with cytosolic location of glycolysis (blue arrows), gluconeogenesis
  (red arrows), pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), pyrimidine biosynthesis (Pyr) and
  purine salvage (Pur). PFK and FBPase (FBP) are critical allosteric enzymes in glycolysis
  and gluconeogenesis, respectively. (b) After the divergence of the lineage leading
  to Euglenoids, the peroxisomes of the common ancestor of diplonemids and kinetoplastids
  were remodelled through the sequestration of a subset of glycolytic enzymes, possibly
  FBPase and others (boxed in yellow). In these remodelled compartments, both glycolysis
  and gluconeogenesis were functional. (c) The ancestral diplonemids or Diplonema
  lost glycolysis accompanied by the loss of PFK activity as suggested in our analysis.
  (d) The ancestral kinetoplastid further sequestered into peroxisomes a part of enzymes
  for PPP, Pyr, Pur and others such as PEPCK and NADH-fumarate reductase (boxed in
  blue).
