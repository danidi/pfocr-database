caption: 'Outline of isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis pathway. The cDNAs of the
  enzymes shown in red were first cloned and/or characterized in Sato’s laboratory,
  and those in blue were cloned as described in the literature, from cultured Coptis
  japonica (Cj) and California poppy (Eschscholzia californica: Es). Genes of the
  following enzymes have been also cloned from Papaver somniferum by other several
  groups;) TYDC, CYP719B1, SalR (salutaridine reductase), SalAT (salutaridinol 7-O-acetyltransferase),
  T6ODM (thebaine 6-O-demethylase), CODM (codeinone O-demethylase) and COR (codeinone
  reductase).'
