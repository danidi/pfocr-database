caption: Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR),
  and triggered arrhythmia.The left part of the diagram (in blue) depicts the mechanism
  of CICR, in which an action potential activates the voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+
  channel, leading to a small Ca2+ influx. This Ca2+ entry opens the RyR2 channel
  in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), resulting in SR Ca2+ release and muscle contraction.
  The right part of the diagram (in red) denotes the mechanism of SOICR, in which
  spontaneous SR Ca2+ release or Ca2+ spillover occurs under conditions of SR Ca2+
  overload caused, for example, by stress via the β-adrenergic receptor (b-AR)/protein
  kinase A (PKA)/phospholamban (PLB) signaling pathway. SOICR can activate the Na+/Ca2+
  exchanger (Na/CaX), which, in turn, can lead to delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs)
  and triggered activities. Reprinted from Priori and Chen with permission.
