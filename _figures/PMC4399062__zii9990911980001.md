caption: Diverse role of the IL-33/ST2 axis during microbial infections. The alarmin
  cytokine IL-33 is released during viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections
  of host cells or during cellular demise. IL-33 interacts with ST2-bearing immune
  cells to induce secretion of various cytokines. IL-33/ST2 signaling is mediated
  by the MyD88/mitogen-activated protein kinase/NF-κB pathway. The IL-33/ST2 axis
  plays a dual-edge function, as it either is protective, for example, in RSV, influenza
  virus, herpes simplex virus, coxsackie B virus, LCMV, HBV, septic shock (LPS, BLP),
  keratitis (P. aeruginosa), dermatitis (S. aureus), peritonitis (C. albicans), or
  blood microfilaria (L. sigmodontis) infections, or has an exacerbating role in Th2-biased
  lung mycosis (C. neoformans), fungal asthma (A. alternata), lung infection (S. mansoni,
  N. brasiliensis), brain infection (A. cantonesis), or intestinal infections (T.
  muris, T. spiralis). At the nucleus level, IL-33 acts also as a transcription repressor.
  DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns.
