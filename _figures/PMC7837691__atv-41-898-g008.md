caption: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated extracellular vesicle (EV) release
  and Grp78 (glucose-regulated protein, 78 kDa) deposition in the ECM (extracellular
  matrix) promote vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. ER stress induces
  loading of Grp78 into EVs. Warfarin induces the PERK (PKR [protein kinase RNA]-like
  ER kinase)-ATF (activating transcription factor) 4 branch of the unfolded protein
  response, which via this pathway increases EV release. Increased EV release and
  the presence of Grp78 lead to VSMC calcification eIF2α indicates eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2α.
