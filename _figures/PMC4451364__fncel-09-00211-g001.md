caption: 'Physiological effects of purinergic receptors in neural and mesenchymal
  stem cells (MSCs). (A) Proposed model of purinergic receptor action on neurogenesis:
  ATP, released from astrocytes, and ADP, resulting from ATP hydrolysis, stimulate,
  respectively, P2X7 and P2Y1 receptors present on neural stem cells (NPCs). The activation
  of P2Y1 receptor leads to increased proliferation and migration and this effect
  is counterbalanced by P2X7 activation that decreases proliferation, induces neuronal
  differentiation, and apoptosis. (B) Osteogenic and adipogenic actions of purinergic
  receptors present on MSCs : A2B, P2Y13, P2X5, and P2X7 receptors stimulate osteogenesis,
  while P2X6 and P2Y2 are inhibitory. A2A, P2Y1, P2Y4 and P2Y11 receptors are adipogenic.
  P2Y11 receptor also induces migration, cytokine release, and proliferation. Proliferation
  is inhibited by P2Y1 receptor.'
