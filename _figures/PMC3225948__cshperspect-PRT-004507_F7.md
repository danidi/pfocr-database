caption: The three arms of the unfolded protein response stress-responsive signaling
  pathway. Proteostasis network capacity in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is matched
  to the level of newly synthesized proteins passing through the secretory pathway
  by the activation of intracellular signaling pathways collectively referred to as
  the unfolded protein response. The unfolded protein response responds to the accumulation
  of misfolded proteins within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Accumulation
  of unfolded proteins activates signaling pathways in the cytosol via the trans-membrane
  stress sensor proteins IRE1, ATF6, and PERK. Activation of the unfolded protein
  response results in translational attenuation of protein synthesis and transcriptional
  activation of genes regulated by the transcription factors XBP1s, ATF4, and ATF6
  resulting from the three signaling arms of the unfolded protein response. (Figure
