caption: Over the last decade, the biosynthesis of phenazines has been elucidated
  in considerable detail [, , ], yet there are still gaps in understanding. Chorismic
  acid, an important intermediate of the shikimate pathway, is the starting material
  of the core phenazine biosynthesis. Five enzymes, namely PhzA/B, PhzD, PhzE, PhzF,
  and PhzG encoded in the phz operon, catalyze the transformation of chorismic acid
  into 5,10-dihydrophenazine-1,6-dicarboxylic acid (DHPDC) and 5,10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic
  acid (DHPCA). Both compounds are central intermediates in the biosynthesis of strain-specific
  phenazines (Scheme ) [, ].
