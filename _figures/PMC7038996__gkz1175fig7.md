caption: 'A two-step mechanism for SSB end resection in SSB repair and signaling.Step
  1: An SSB is recognized by APE1, which then initiates SSB end resection in the 3′–5′
  direction to generate a small gap (this work). Step 2: APE2 is recruited to the
  small gap likely via PCNA, and its exonuclease activity is activated and enhanced
  via several distinct regulatory mechanisms (). After this two-step SSB end resection,
  the ATR–Chk1 DDR pathway is activated and the SSB is eventually repaired. See the
  text for more details.'
