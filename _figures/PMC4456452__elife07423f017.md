caption: 'Initial oviposition depression during the 0- to 24-hr acute response period
  and information transmission during social learning 24- to 48-hr periods are not
  coupled. Sustained oviposition depression requires learning and memory genes in
  both teachers and students. Alleles tested for indicated genes were ninaBP315, Orb2ΔQ,
  Adf1nal, dnc1, dncML, rut1, rut2080, FMR1B55, FMR13, amn1, amnX8, wg1, ewg1, ewg2,
