caption: Comparison of mouse and human pro-resolving macrophages. This figure summarizes
  the data discussed in the text, and focuses on two pathways involved in mouse macrophage
  anti-inflammatory reprogramming, namely the L-arginine metabolism and the LXR pathway.
  Interspecies heterogeneity is reported for these two pathways. Mouse pro-resolving
  macrophages (left-hand side) are characterized by arginase-1 (Arg-1) and uses the
  arginine pathway to stimulate tissue repair and “continual” efferocytosis. Efferocytosis
  and tissue microenvironment imprint an anti-inflammatory profile with an increased
  expression of M2 receptor CD206 () and efferocytic receptor TIM-4 (), as well as
  a downregulation of pro-inflammatory Tlr9 () and Il1b () genes. Cholesterol derivatives
  (chol. der.) issued from apoptotic cells may promote the LXR pathway that is responsible
  for upregulation of efferocytic receptor Mer () and an anti-inflammatory response,
  including inhibition of NF-κB () and TLR2, 4 and 9 signaling pathway via the LXR
  target factor, ABCA1 (). LXR upregulates Tgm2 in mouse macrophages (). Metabolites
  released from apoptotic cells (i.e., inosine-monophosphate and adenosine-monophosphate)
  imprint an anti-inflammatory profile (), possibly via A2A and A2B adenosine receptors,
  which are highly expressed and functional in mouse cells. Thus, in mouse macrophages,
  adenosine A2A receptors are the primary target of apoptotic cell-derived adenosine
  and these receptors mediated apoptotic-cell induced immune suppression (, ). Aging
  affects efferocytosis efficacy by downregulating Mer receptor (). The picture for
  human macrophages (right-hand side) is more complicated and data remain incomplete.
  While apoptotic-cell derived ornithine and putrescine participates in “continual”
  efferocytosis and the anti-inflammatory program of human pro-resolving macrophages
  (). LXR activation leads to anti-inflammatory functions [with upregulation of efferocytic
  receptor Tgm2 () and inhibition of TLR4 signaling ()] and pro-inflammatory functions
  (, , ) [with the production of IL-1β via HIF-1α (), as well as ROS ()]. Human cells
  are less receptive to inosine and adenosine with reduced expression and function
  of adenosine receptors in comparison to mouse cells (). Aging disturbs efferocytosis
  efficacy and the resolution of inflammation by downregulating TIM-4 receptor ().
