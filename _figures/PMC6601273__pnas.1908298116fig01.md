caption: Schematic diagram depicting the role of the hepcidin/ferroportin axis in
  systemic iron homeostasis and local iron homeostasis in PASMCs. (A) Systemic iron
  homeostasis. The liver produces hepcidin in response to stimulatory signals from
  iron and inflammation and to inhibitory signals from erythropoietic drive via the
  BMP signaling pathway to govern systemic iron homeostasis. Hepcidin binding induces
  ferroportin (FPN) degradation on duodenal enterocytes, iron-recycling macrophages,
  and hepatocytes to block iron (Fe) release into the bloodstream from dietary sources
  and body stores. (B and C) Proposed model by Lakhal-Littleton et al. () for local
  iron homeostasis in PASMCs (B) and how abnormalities in the PASMC hepcidin/ferroportin
  axis lead to PAH (C). (B) PASMCs produce hepcidin in response to BMP signals. Hepcidin
  has an autocrine effect to degrade ferroportin, block iron release, and maintain
  adequate intracellular iron levels. (C) Mutations in ferroportin that block hepcidin
  binding (Left) or mutations in BMP receptor type 2 (BMPR2) associated with PAH that
  block hepcidin production (Right) lead to unregulated ferroportin activity and intracellular
  iron deficiency in PASMCs, resulting in increased production of the vasoconstrictor
  ET-1.
