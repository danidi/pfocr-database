caption: The signaling pathway initiated by estrogen in MCF-7 cells. Estrogen upregulated
  the expression of Cav1.3 through the membrane GPR30. The activation of Cav1.3 promoted
  the Ca2+ influx, then the increase of Ca2+ induced the expression of p-ERK1/2 pathway
  to initiate the cell proliferation.
