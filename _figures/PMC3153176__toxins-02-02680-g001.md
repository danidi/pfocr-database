caption: Simplified biosynthetic pathway for aflatoxin (AF) and sterigmatocystin (ST)
  and predicted pathway for dothistromin (DOT) showing key intermediates and chemical
  structures of pathway products. Probable sites of action of the currently known
  dothistromin genes (left), and their AF and ST orthologs, are indicated. Some other
  biosynthetic genes expected to be present in D. septosporum are indicated in grey,
  with old AF gene names in parenthesis for clarification.
