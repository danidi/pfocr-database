caption: Proposed diagram for miRs-449 regulation in doxorubicin sensitivity and resistance
  cells. A proposed model for doxorubicin sensitivity/resistance cells by E2F1-miRs-449
  circuit coupling the positive and negative feedback loops in cell cycle progression
  and growth control is shown. In this model, DNA damage produced by doxorubicin,
  leads into E2F1 directly activation of miR-449 family, which in turn targets and
  inhibits the expression of factors that belong to the E2F-pRb pathway, including
  CDK4/6, CCNE2, CDC25A, and E2F1/3. These changes further cause reduced levels of
  E2F proteins and an increase in hypophosphorylated pRb protein level, which will
  further reduce E2F activities and thus affect cell cycle progression and growth
  control. Arrowheads symbolize activation and bars inhibition.
