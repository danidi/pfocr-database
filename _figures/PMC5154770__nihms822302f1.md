caption: Naïve T cells are predominantly oxidative and constantly monitor their environment
  for immune insult. Upon T cell receptor stimulation and co-stimulation by antigen
  presenting cells, T cells upregulate Myc expression and mTOR signaling, enhancing
  glycolysis and glutaminolysis (above). In tumor environment, some T cells exhibit
  high PD-1 expression and reduced activation. During the immune response, some cells
  will become memory T cells and return to naïve-like oxidative metabolism, whereas
  large populations of clonally selected T cells remain effector cells with high Myc
  and mTOR pathway signaling to respond to acute infection. In autoimmune settings,
  effector T cells react against self-antigens erroneously, enhancing effector responses
  that escape Treg suppression. Induced Treg (iTreg) are important in suppressing
  this peripheral autoreactivity.
