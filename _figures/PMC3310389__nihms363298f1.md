caption: Protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic AMP (cAMP) signalling pathway in pathogenesis
  of C. neoformans. Adenylyl cyclase (Cac1) is activated by the Gα subunit (Gpa1)
  or HCO3− resulting in production of cAMP. cAMP then binds to regulatory subunits
  (Pkr1) of the PKA complex to release an active form of the catalytic subunit (Pka1),
  which phosphorylates downstream proteins including Nrg1. A GTPase-activating protein
  (Crg2) and phosphodiesterase (Pde1) negatively regulate Gpa1 and production of cAMP
  respectively. Gpr4, G-protein-coupled receptor; Can2, carbonic anhydrase; Aca1,
  adenylyl cyclase-associated protein; Gib2, Gβ subunit.
