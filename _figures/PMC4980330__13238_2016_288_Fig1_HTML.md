caption: The core of the Hippo signaling pathway. The core components of the Hippo
  pathway comprise a kinase cascade and a transcriptional activation module. When
  the Hippo pathway is activated, mammalian STE20-like 1/2 (MST1/2) phosphorylate
  and form complex with Salvador 1 (SAV1). MST1/2 phosphorylate and activate large
  tumor suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2) and Mob1 homolog (MOB1). Beside MST1/2, MAP4K family
  members could directly phosphorylate LATS1/2 as well. Two homologues transcriptional
  coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW domain-containing transcription
  factor (TAZ) are phosphorylated and inactivated by LATS1/2 via cytoplasmic retardation
  by 14-3-3 or degradation by SCF/CRL1(β-TrCP) E3 ligase. When the Hippo pathway is
  inactivated, MST1/2 and LATS1/2 are dephosphorylated and inactivated, resulting
  in the dephosphorylation and nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ. As transcriptional
  coactivators, the nuclear YAP/TAZ bind to and activate TEA domain family members
  1–4 (TEAD1–4), leading to the transcription of genes relating to cell proliferation,
  migration, and tumorigenesis
