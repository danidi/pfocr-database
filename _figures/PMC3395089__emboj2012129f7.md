caption: Model of Notch–Mef2 synergistic activity. The Notch–Mef2 synergy acts upon
  JNK signalling and downstream events. Notch and Mef2 cooperate to directly turn
  on the JNK pathway ligand eiger at the transcriptional level, which results in activation
  of JNK signalling. This in turn results in increased cellular proliferation as well
  as the formation of metastatic groups of cells that can migrate away from the original
  source.
