caption: Two possible mechanisms by which myofibroblasts acquire anoikis resistance
  via integrin receptors for laminin-332 during tissue remodeling. Direct and indirect
  interactions may occur between invasive tumor cells and myofibroblasts in the interface
  zone of invasive ductal carcinoma. Myofibroblasts within the interface zone could
  be stimulated to express laminin-332 by diffusible factors from invasive breast
  cancer cells. Binding of laminin-332 to integrin α3β1 on the myofibroblasts turns
  on a cell-survival signaling pathway mediated by Akt phosphorylation. In this case,
  myofibroblasts may simultaneously use synoikis to overcome anoikis. In addition,
  in the border between the tumor zone and the interface zone, invasive breast cancer
  cells can directly interact with myofibroblasts, leading to integrin β4 neoexpression.
  Once integrin β4 is induced, myofibroblasts use both integrin α3β1 and α6β4 as receptors
  for laminin-332, and become resistant to anoikis via Akt phosphorylation (laminin-332
  dependent) and Rac1 activation (laminin-332 independent). Moreover, integrin β4
  neoexpression may inhibit myofibroblast aggregation through downregulation of β-catenin.
