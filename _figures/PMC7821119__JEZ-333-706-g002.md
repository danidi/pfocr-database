caption: Illustration of the complement system pathways, mechanisms of activation,
  and terminal outcomes. The classical pathway is triggered when an antigen‐presenting
  cell (e.g., a phagocyte) engulfs a pathogen and presents the pathogenic antigen
  on the extracellular surface (1). The C1 protein is activated after binding to an
  antigen/antibody complex on the antigen‐presenting cell (2). C1 goes through a series
  of binding and cleaving events with other complement components to form C3‐convertase.
  In the lectin pathway, free mannose‐binding lectins (MBLs) bind with a serine protease
  to create MBL associated serine proteases (MASPs) (1). MASPs exist as zymogens in
  the bloodstream and function similarly to C1 in the classical pathway. The lectin
  pathway is triggered when MBL binds to mannose and other carbohydrates found on
  the pathogen cell surface which activates the MASP (2). MASP will cleave complement
  proteins C2 and C4 into fragments which then bind with each other to form C3‐convertase
  (3). In the alternative pathway, free C3b proteins are held in an inactive state
  by inhibitory factor proteins that prevent complement components from attacking
  host cells and eliciting an autoimmune response (1). When C3b encounters a pathogen,
  it binds directly to pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the pathogen
  surface (2). The binding of C3b to a pathogen surface makes it available to the
  complement protein, Factor B (3). C3b and Factor B, (C3bBb), function as a C3‐convertase.
