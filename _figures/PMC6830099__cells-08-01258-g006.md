caption: Putative model for the role of WIP1 in HR and in PARP inhibitor sensitivity.
  (A) Under normal conditions, endogenous DNA lesions are efficiently repaired by
  HR and BER. WIP1 promotes efficiency of HR and limits the extent of p53 pathway
  activation allowing cells to proliferate. (B) After inhibition of PARP1, BER pathway
  is impaired (dashed lines) but DNA lesions are efficiently repaired by HR. (C) Combined
  inhibition of PARP1 and WIP1 impairs both BER and HR (dashed lines) and enhances
  p53 response leading to accumulation of DNA lesions in G2 cells. Increased DNA damage
  load triggers the DNA damage response and allows full activation of p53 pathway
  leading to cell death.
