caption: Main biosynthetic pathway of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. The
  main biosynthetic product of fatty acid synthase (FASN) is 16:0, but saturated fatty
  acids of 12 and 14 carbon atoms are also produced. ACC indicates acetyl-CoA carboxylase;
  ELOVL6, fatty acid elongase; and SCD, stearoyl-CoA desaturase.
