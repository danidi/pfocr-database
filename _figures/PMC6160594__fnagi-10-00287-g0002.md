caption: Putative role for astrocytic CN/nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT)
  in vascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Ischemia arising from vascular degeneration
  or disruption leads to increased expression of ΔCN and hyperactivation of NFAT4
  in astrocytes. The CN/NFAT pathway induces numerous cytokines and other inflammatory
  mediators linked to neuroinflammation. Some of these factors may target blood vessels,
  leading to perivascular inflammation. CN/NFAT signaling also leads to the downregulation
  of GLT1 glutamate transporters resulting in elevated extracellular glutamate levels.
  Glutamate causes excitotoxicity at synaptic connections and disrupts astrocyte endfeet
  and/or blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity, leading to further vascular dysfunction
  and/or degeneration.
