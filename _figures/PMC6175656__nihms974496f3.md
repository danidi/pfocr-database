caption: Insulin signals via IRS-PI3K to activate TRPC 5 channels in POMC neurons,
  which generates a robust inward cationic current to depolarize POMC neurons and
  increase their excitability. Similarly, leptin binding to its receptor (LRb) triggers
  the recruitment of the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase (JAK) 2, leading to the activation
  of the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway
  and simultaneously activation of PI3K, which also activates TRPC 5 channels. PI3K
  (p85/p110) will also accelerate the rapid insertion of TPRC 5 channels into the
  plasma membrane. PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase-1. [Modified
  from Fig. 8, . Endocrinology 159, 647-664.]
