caption: Transcription factor restricted functional interactions with ERα in osteoblasts.
  A model based on results from these studies proposes that, in differentiating osteoblasts,
  17βE activated ERα enhances gene expression through TCF response elements (TCF RE),
  and Wnt pathway induction enhances the transcriptional effect of 17βE activated
  ERα through ERE response elements in a β-catenin independent way through a functional
  complex formation between ERα and TCF-4 (right half of figure). These co-stimulatory
  events contrast with earlier studies revealing that an interaction between ERα and
  Runx2 that enhances Runx2 dependent gene expression through Runx response elements
  (Runx RE) and suppresses ERα dependent gene expression through ERE (McCarthy, 2003);
  and between ERα and C/EBP that co-suppresses gene expression by ERα through ERE
  and C/EBP through C/EBP response elements (C/EBP RE) () (left half of figure). Perhaps
  imposed on this, but not detailed in this figure, and the physical and functional
  interactions between TCF-4 and Runx2 (), and between Runx2 and C/EBP (), and the
  interactions between these factors by the osteoblast growth factor TGF-β and/or
  IGF-I pathways (; ; ; ). The importance of changes in specific downstream genes
  regulated by the individual or combined effects of ERα and TCF activation and the
  mechanisms by which they occur, now just initiated here (Figs. ,), await further
  studies.
