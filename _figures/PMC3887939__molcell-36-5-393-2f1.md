caption: 'Signaling mechanisms proposed for the mammalian autophagy pathway. Numerous
  molecular events are needed to activate the autophagy pathway, including initiation,
  nucleation, elongation, autophagosome maturation, and cargo degradation. 1) Initiation
  and nucleation: an autophagic isolation membrane is generated from several sources,
  such as the ER membrane, mitochondria (MT), and the plasma membrane (PM) derived
  from Atg16L1 precursors. Homotypic fusion of the Atg16L1 precursor is regulated
  by the SNARE protein VAMP7 together with partner SNAREs; this is an essential event
  in the early phases of autophagy. 2) Elongation: expansion of the autophagic membrane
  is required for the conjugation system to form phagophore structures. (a) Atg 16
  non-covalently conjugates with the Atg5 and Atg12 covalent complex, which functions
  as an E3-like enzyme; (b) the Atg5/12/16 complex activates the conversion of LC3
  into LC3. 3) Maturation and cargo degradation: the autophagosome fuses with the
  late endosomal/multivesicular body to make intermediates called amphisomes, which
  ultimately results in formation of the autolysosome via fusion with the lysosome.
  The autophagosomal SNARE Syntaxin 17 interacts with the endosomal/lysosomal SNARE
  VAMP8 via SNAP-29, which results in autophagosome-late endosome/lysosome fusion.
  Formation of the am-phisome and autolysosome is dependent on Rab7 GTPase activation
  by UVRAG-class C complex.'
