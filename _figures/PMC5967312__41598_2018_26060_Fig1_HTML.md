caption: A schematic representation of the biosynthetic pathway of the main mandibular
  gland fatty acids in honey bee queens (ω-1 hydroxylation; purple) and queen right
  -workers (ω hydroxylation; green). The oxidative reduction of 9-HDA to 9-ODA is
  catalysed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.
