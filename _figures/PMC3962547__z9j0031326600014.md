caption: Integration of metabolic control, cell growth and proliferation, and their
  regulation by phosphoinositides. One of the main effectors of PI3K activation is
  the Akt/PKB protein kinase that is activated by translocation to the membrane by
  binding via its PH domain to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 [and PtdIns(3,4)P2]. This recruitment
  is important for phosphorylation of Akt/PKB by two protein kinases, PDK1 (on Thr308)
  and the mTORC2 complex (on Ser473). These two kinases are also activated by PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.
  Although Akt signals in a number of other directions (not shown here for simplicity),
  one of its major functions is to control the activity of the mTORC1 complex. Active
  Akt stimulates mTORC1 by inhibiting the GAP activity of the TSC1/2 complex, the
  latter limiting the activity of the Rheb GTP binding proteins that are upstream
  activators of the mTORC1 complex. Active mTORC1 is a signal for cell growth and
  proliferation and inhibits apoptosis and autophagy. In case of starvation, energy
  depletion, stress, or hypoxia, mTORC1 is inhibited, and these signals activate the
  TSC1/2 complex. Under these conditions autophagy is stimulated. A different pathway
  is used during amino acid sensing. Amino acids activate the Rag GTPases and induce
  translocation of the mTORC1 complex to the surface of the lysosomes. The classIII
  PI3K hVPS34 is also important for the amino acid sensing pathway for mTORC1 activation
  using a pathway that works parallel to the Rag GTPases and which requires PLD1,
  and PtdIns3P binding to the PX domain of PLD. Recently, the class II PI3Ks and PtdIns(3,5)P2
  production was also shown to stimulate mTORC1. Paradoxically, autophagy also requires
  PtdIns3P and VPS34, and it is most likely that the VPS34 that serves as a mediator
  of mTORC1 activation by amino acids works in a different complex and location than
  the one that promotes autophagy.
