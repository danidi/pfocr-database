caption: IAP antagonists promote bone metastasis via activation of alternative NF-κB
  pathway. The presence of IAP antagonists enhances the degradation of cIAP1/2, stabilizing
  more NIK, thereby increasing more osteoclastogenic signaling through p52/RelB. Elevated
  numbers of osteoclasts provide a favorable microenvironment for bone metastasis
  through release of tumor growth factors from bone matrix and a positive feedback
  loop from RANKL-secreting osteoblasts. Osteoclast inhibiting agents such as bisphosphonates
  can interrupt this vicious cycle, reducing the osteolytic and pro-tumor effects
  of IAP antagonists
