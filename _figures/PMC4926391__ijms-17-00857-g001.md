caption: 'Hedgehog signaling pathway and the primary cilia. (A) In the absence of
  Hedgehog (Hh) ligand, Gli localizes in the cytoplasm as part of an inhibitory complex
  with Fused kinase (Fu) and Suppressor of Fused (SuFu), which allows the sequential
  phosphorylation by several kinases: Protein kinase A (PKA), glycogen synthase-3β
  (GSK3β) and casein kinase-1 (CK1). Thereafter, ubiquitination by Skip-Cullin-F-box
  (SCF) protein/β-Transducing repeat Containing Protein (TrCP) primes the phosphorylated
  Gli to limited proteosomic degradation, exposing the N-terminal repressor domain
  (GliR), which translocates to the nucleus and represses; (B) When Hh ligand binds
  to Ptch, it releases the inhibitory effect of Ptch on Smo that localizes in cytoplasmic
  vesicles. Smo then undergoes anterograde movement along the cilia, directed by kinesin
  and facilitated by the ciliary proteins Bardet-Biedl syndrome proteins (BBS) and
  intraflagellar transport proteins (IFP). At the tip of the cilia, Smo releases Gli
  from the suppressor complex, allowing it to move along the cilia, directed by dynein
  proteins. Unphosphorylated Gli undergoes limited proteosomal degradation, exposing
  the C-terminal activator domain (GliA), which translocates to the nucleus promoting
  gene transcription.'
