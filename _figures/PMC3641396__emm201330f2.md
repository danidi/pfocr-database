caption: Model of heterotrimeric G protein signaling in E. histolytica. Activated
  EhGα1, together with guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound EhRacC, engages the autoinhibited
  EhRGS-RhoGEF (E. histolytica regulator of G protein signaling–Rho guanine nucleotide
  exchange factor) to promote Rac GTPase in Drosophila S2 cells, although no specific
  E. histolytica Rho family substrate for EhRGS-RhoGEF has yet been identified. Both
  EhGα1 and EhRGS-RhoGEF alter trophozoite migration, host cell attachment and cell
  killing by altered cysteine protease secretion.,  An associated G protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR) is postulated but not yet established within this signaling pathway;
  Despite its name, the protein EhGPCR-1 is more likely a Wnt-binding factor than
  a ligand-activated heterotrimeric G protein GEF. DH, Dbl homology; GDP, guanosine
  diphosphate; PH, pleckstrin homology.
