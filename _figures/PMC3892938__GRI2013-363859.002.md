caption: A schematic representation of IL-12 family cytokines and the corresponding
  receptors and JAK-STAT signaling pathways []. IL-12, IL-23, IL-27, and IL-35 are
  heterodimeric and share the subunits. The 4 cytokines require each corresponding
  receptor which also shares components for the function. It is thought that the 4
  cytokines have overlapping but distinct effect on T cells with corresponding Janus
  kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway. The experimental data demonstrated a functional
  spectrum from proinflammatory to inhibitory in Th cell differentiation. IL-12 and
  IL-23 are produced by activated dendritic cells and macrophages and induce inflammation
  through Th1 and Th17 differentiation, respectively. IL-27 is secreted from antigen-presenting
  cells and produces IL-10 secreting Th cells. IL-35 is mainly produced by Treg cells,
  amplifies IL-35 producing Th cells, and induces T-cell arrest.
