caption: 'The SDF1/CXCR4 signaling pathway: A new player involved in DiGeorge/22q11-deletion
  syndrome malformations. A. Schematic representation of the different NC cell populations
  that colonize the pharyngeal arches, the cardiac outflow tract and the cranial ganglia.
  NC cells that express the CXCR4 receptor and respond to SDF1 signals allowing them
  to migrate along the superficial ectoderm and populate the arches and the cardiac
  outflow tract are indicated in red. Those which do not express CXCR4 and migrate
  ventrally to contribute to the cranial sensory ganglia are in blue. Arrows indicate
  the level of origin of NC cells along the rostro-caudal axis. tel, telencephalon;
  di, diencephalon; mes, mesencephalon; r1-r8, rhombomeres 1-8; V, trigeminal ganglion;
  VII/VIII, facial and vestibuloacoustic ganglia; IX/X, glossopharyngeal and vagal
  ganglia; PA1-6, pharyngeal arches 1-6; ht, heart; ot, outflow tract. B. Putative
  signaling pathways regulating migration, survival and differentiation of NC cells
  in PA1-2 and PA3-6, respectively. The tissular origin of the signal (enodermal or
  ectodermal) is indicated. Single arrows with plain line represent demonstrated (direct
  or indirect) regulations and double arrows indicate reciprocal regulations. Arrows
  with dashed line and associated with question marks represent hypothetical regulatory
  pathways. C. Lists of the main NC derivatives generated in PA1-2 and PA3-6, respectively,
  and of the corresponding disorders commonly observed in 22q11DS. Neural defects
  consecutive to CXCR4 signaling defects and causing mental retardation and other
  psychiatric disorders are not listed because, to our knowledge, they are not directly
  related with anomalies in pharyngeal NC cells.'
