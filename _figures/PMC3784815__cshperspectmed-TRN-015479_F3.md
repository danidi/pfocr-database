caption: Kidney immune activation against ischemia-reperfusion and transplant injury.
  Ischemic stress to the kidney induces the local synthesis and secretion of complement
  proteins directly by proximal tubule epithelial cells. Subsequent activation of
  the complement cascade leads to C3b and C5b deposition and engagement of receptors
  by terminal pathway effector molecules such as C5a, which signals via C5aR. Deposition
  of membranes attack complex (C5b-9) and engagement of C5aR by C5a can lead to PTEC
  activation and/or cell death. During allograft rejection, chemokines secreted by
  perturbed PTECs, such as TGF-β, result in an inflammatory phenotype within the interstitium,
  where lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
  enter. APCs express complement components and receptors following complement activation
  during the inflammatory response and can enhance DC-mediated T-cell priming and
  the generation of T helper 1 (Th1) cells. C3a and C5a recognition by naïve Th cells
  can also promote their differentiation to a Th1 phenotype. TCR, T-cell receptor;
  MHC II, major histocompatibility complex class II.
