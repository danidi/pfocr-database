caption: MIF in HD. Preclinical studies on MIF in HD show that lymphocytes of HD patients
  express MIF against a single agent present in brain samples of HD patients []. It
  has also been observed that MIF down expression, through the inhibition pathway
  of HDAC3, reduces the activation of the astrocytic response [].
