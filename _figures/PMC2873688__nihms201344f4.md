caption: Molecular mechanism and pathway of JNK activation by p85. The full-length
  p85 regulatory subunit activates JNK through the insulin/cdc42/MKK pathway. Activation
  of JNK results in negative feedback on the insulin signaling pathway. Thus, the
  loss of p85 improves insulin sensitivity, in part by diminishing this JNK-mediated
  negative regulation. (This figure is a modification from .)
