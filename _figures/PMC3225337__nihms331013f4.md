caption: 'The choice of a lower pathway for the metabolism of pyruvate by Clostridium
  pasteuranium is shown. Lactate, ethanol, acetate, butyrate, and butanol are the
  major metabolic end products; next to each one is a ‘scorecard’ showing, from left
  to right: equivalents of NADH reduced to NAD+; equivalents of ADP converted to ATP
  by substrate-level phosphorylation; equivalents of acid produced; and equivalents
  of H2 produced (all figures are in units of per mole pyruvate). Double arrows represent
  multiple steps in a pathway; see text for details.'
