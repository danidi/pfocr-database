caption: generation of ceramide via the function of dhCerS. Recently identified dhCerS1–6
  are responsible for the generation and determining the fatty-acid chain length of
  ceramide in the de novo pathway. For example, dhCerS1, previously known as LASS1,
  is responsible for generating dihydro-C18-ceramide, whereas CersS2 and CerS4 synthesize
  dihydro-C22-, C24-, and C26-ceramides. In addition, dihydro-C12-, C14- and C16-ceramides
  are generated by CerS5 and CerS6. These dihydro-ceramides are then desaturated to
  form ceramides by DES
