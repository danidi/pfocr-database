caption: Biosynthesis of ceramide and its conversion into other bioactive sphingolipids.
  De novo ceramide synthesis begins with the conversion of serine and fatty acyl CoA
  into 3-ketosphinganine by serine palmitoyl transferase (SPT), then 3-ketosphinganine
  is converted into dihydrosphingosine. Myriocin is a potent inhibitor of SPT activity.
  (Dihydro) ceramide synthase (LASS/CerS) acylates dihydrosphingosine to form dihydroceramide,
  which is then reduced to ceramide by dihydroceramide desaturase. Ceramide is also
  produced by SMases through SM degradation in SMase pathway. Ceramidase converts
  ceramide into sphingosine, which is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase (SK) to
  generate sphingosine-1-phosphate. Ceramide is phosphorylated by ceramide kinase
  (CK) yielding ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). In the salvage or recycling pathway, complex
  sphingolipids are broken down to ceramide by glucosylceramidase (GCase) and then
  by ceramidase to sphingosine, which is re-acylated to ceramide by LASS/CerS. Fumonisin
  B1 inhibits LASS/CerS activity.
