caption: 'Glucose enters pancreatic beta-cells through glucose transporters (GLUT2
  in mice and GLUT1 in humans) where it is metabolized in mitochondria resulting in
  an increase in the ATP/ADP ratio; this results in closure of membrane ATP-sensitive
  K+ channels (KATP) that are responsible for the resting membrane potential. KATP
  channel closure results in cellular depolarization that opens voltage-gated calcium
  channels, triggering Ca2+ signals that induce insulin granule exocytosis and a subsequent
  rise in circulating insulin levels. This secretory pathway is disrupted by EDCs
  at different points: 1) Bisphenol-A, nonylphenol, octylphenol and triphenyltin impair
  mitochondrial function. 2) Bisphenol-A blocks KATP channels after binding ERbeta.
  3) Calcium signaling is altered by Bisphenol-A, Arsenic, PCBs and Triphenyltin.
  4) disruption of insulin secretion has been described for Bisphenol-A, dioxins,
  PCBs, DDT, Arsenic, and Cadmium . Beta-cells have a low antioxidant capacity and
  are very sensitive to oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen and nitrogen
  species that impair their function by altering metabolism and/or KATP activity while
  inducing apoptosis. Mercury and Cadmium (5) are EDCs that produce oxidative stress
  in beta-cells. 6) Insulin gene expression is regulated by BPA via ERα, while DEHP
  and Cadmium provoke cell death and decrease in beta-cell mass.'
