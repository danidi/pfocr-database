caption: The role of epidermal growth factor (EGF-EGFR) signalling pathway in hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) inflammatory microenvironment. The role of EGF-EGFR signalling pathway
  in the department of inflammatory microenvironment of HCC. HCC cells per se could
  produce inflammatory factors such as CXCL5 and CXCL8, probably responsible for the
  recruitment of leucocytes and HCC metastasis. EGF may act as an initiator factor
  to facilitate the transforming process of tumour cells from low metastatic potential
  into high metastatic potential, associated with the regulation of tumour progression.
  The potential mechanism indicated from the present study is that EGF may combine
  with its receptor EGFR to initiate the downstream of PI3K and Erk signal pathway
  and contribute to HCC proliferation, migration and production of inflammatory cytokines.
  HCC-produced inflammatory cytokines further form dynamic networks in tumour microenvironment
  and interact with each other. CXCR2 as the co-receptor of CXCL5 and CXCL8 probably
  have the cross-talk with EGFR. CXCL5 and IL-8 may further regulate the inflammatory
  microenvironment by combing with CXCR2.
