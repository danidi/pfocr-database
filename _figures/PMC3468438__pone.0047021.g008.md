caption: MESB treatment resulted in activation of intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.
  This is mediated through activation of p73. This activation leads to changes in
  the level of mitochondrial apoptotic protein, BAX. This may result in the imbalance
  of proapoptotic/antiapoptotic proteins. The activation of BAX, further leads to
  cleavage of MCL-1 and release of CYTOCHROME C, which along with APAF1 helps in cleavage
  of CASPASE 9. Cleaved CASPASE 9 activates CASPASE 3 which further initiates PARP1
  cleavage and cell death.
