caption: 'Ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transactivation of epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR)/MAPK3/1 pathway in pig cumulus cells by FSH. The binding
  of FSH to the Gq class of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) results in the activation
  of protein kinase C (PKC) and SRC that phosphorylates EGFR in its intracellular
  domain. It is not clear whether this phosphorylation leads to receptor dimerization
  []. The SRC-mediated phosphorylation is associated with activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK1
  pathway and rapid activation of MAPK3/1, but it may not lead to full phosphorylation
  of the intracellular domain and activation of all pathways known to be associated
  with EGFR TK activity [,]. FSH also binds to the Gs class of GPCRs and activates
  adenylyl cyclase, which leads to an increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. This
  PKA activity is required for the synthesis of the AREG pro-peptides [], which are
  cleaved at the plasma level by TACE/ADAMs metalloproteinases and released outside
  the cumulus cells into the extracellular space. The active forms of AREG serve as
  ligands for EGFR, which leads to dimerization of the receptor, full phosphorylation
  of its intracellular domain and activation of downstream signaling pathways, including
  the MAPK3/1, PKC and PI3K pathways. The transcription- and ligand synthesis-dependent
  process of EGFR/MAPK3/1 activation requires 1–2 h to be activated [] and operates
  in cumulus cells for an extended period of time. MAPK3/1 may thus be involved in
  events occurring in minutes after the exposure of follicular cells to gonadotropins,
  such as gap junction closure through connexin phosphorylation [] and the regulation
  of cGMP level in follicular cells [,,], as well as in delayed events such as the
  regulation of steroidogenesis and cumulus expansion []. MEK: MEK1/2; MAPK: MAPK3/1;
  MMP: matrix metalloproteinases; AC: adenylyl cyclase.'
