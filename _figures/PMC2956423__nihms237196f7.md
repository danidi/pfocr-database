caption: In normal non-ethanol-exposed and non-aldehyde-exposed hepatocytes, upstream
  kinase events (solid arrows) cascade down through ERK-1/2 to phosphorylate and activate
  this signaling intermediate, resulting in the active transport of ERK-1/2 into the
  nucleus where phosphorylation of downstream ELK-1 and subsequently AP-1 (c-Fos,
  and to a lesser extent c-Jun) result in transcriptional activity. During ethanol-induced
  lipid peroxidation, 4-HNE forms covalent adducts with inactive ERK-1/2 in the cytosol,
  preventing its phosphorylation, activation, and nuclear translocation, which results
  in the loss of downstream ELK-1 activity (dotted arrows). The 4-HNE-mediated inactivation
  of ERK-1/2 and the subsequent loss of ELK-1 activity could potentially result in
  the loss of normal transcriptional activity through the c-Fos and c-Jun AP-1 transcription
  factors associated with proliferation, cell survival, and homeostasis (dashed arrows).
