caption: (A) Proposed role of miR-451 in the regulation of LKB1/AMPK-mTOR signaling
  in response to high and low glucose levels. miR-451 levels determine glioma cell
  migration or proliferation in response to glucose (triangle on the left) via the
  AMPK-mTOR network []. Glucose withdrawal reduces miR-451 levels, resulting in up-regulation
  of AMPK activity and down-regulation of mTOR. This leads to reduced cell proliferation
  and enhanced cell motility. Normal glucose levels up-regulate miR-451, which leads
  to down-regulation of AMPK activity. In turn, down-regulated AMPK levels induce
  up-regulation of mTOR, which leads to increased proliferation and decreased cell
  migration. (B) Schematic components of miR-451, CAB39/LKB1/AMPK complex, and mTOR
  are represented by modules ‘M’ (dotted box on the left), ‘A’ (box with solid line
  in the middle), and ‘R’ (dotted box on the right), respectively, in our theoretical
  framework. (C) Detailed schematic of cellular decision of cell proliferation and
  migration in glioblastoma via signaling networks including miR-451, AMPK, mTOR,
  and players in the cell cycle module (CycB, Cdh1, p55cdcT, p55cdcA, Plk1) [].
