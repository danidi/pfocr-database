caption: Model of PAPP-A-driven PABC. Schematic of our current understanding of PAPP-A-driven
  PABC, where red boxes indicate factors that have been established to activate the
  pathway, blue boxes indicate factors inhibiting the pathway, and green boxes factors
  that are hypothesized to affect the pathway. In this model, elevated content in
  collagen is necessary for PAPP-A to cleave IGFBP-5 in the mammary gland. The elevated
  level of collagen can be provided through distinct avenues including involution
  and, as demonstrated in the current study, post-partum environment. We postulate
  that high breast density may contribute the activity of PAPP-A. Conversely, extended
  breastfeeding appears to inhibit PAPP-A. Upon activation of PAPP-A and cleavage
  of IGFBP-5, free IGFs are released and able to bind and activate the IGF receptor,
  which results in increased IGF signaling, increased collagen deposition, and extended
  involution, in the case of an involuting mammary gland. We show that LARP6 is activated
  following PAPP-A overexpression and as a chaperone of the mRNA of collagen, LARP6
  contributes to the elevation in collagen deposition in PAPP-A-driven mammary tumors.
  In addition, the collagen receptor DDR2 is activated, which leads to the DDR2/Snail
  axis of metastasis reported by others. In a mechanism that remains unclear, DDR2
  promotes the formation of TACS3 collagen, which facilitates metastasis
