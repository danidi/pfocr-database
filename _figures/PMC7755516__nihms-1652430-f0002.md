caption: 'Lytic cell death pathways of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) during the
  intestinal diseases. A: The inadequate release of TNF-α not only mediates IECs apoptosis,
  but also triggers necrotic cell death by inducing ROS, which acts as secondary messengers
  to regulate inflammation and its mediated signaling pathways during the presence
  of multiple pathological stimuli and stress condition. B: The binding of death ligands
  with their corresponding receptors (as shown in the figure) together with adapter
  proteins, but under caspase-8 or cIAP depletion, promotes the cell death pathways
  of necroptosis through the formation of necrosome RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL, which leads
  to the phosphorylation of MLKL (p-MLKL). This event reduces the cell survival and
  anti-apoptotic pathways and increases the pro-inflammatory mediators along with
  intestinal barrier dysfunction and intestine permeability. C: Sensing of DAMPs or
  PAMPs by NLRs promotes the formation of inflammasome complex that involves NLRP3,
  ASC, and caspase-1 in the canonical pathway. In the non-canonical pathway, LPS leads
  to the activation of caspase-11 and results in cytoplasmic swelling and cytosolic
  content leakage along with DAMPs. Although pyroptosis occurs in inflammatory cells,
  it seems that pyroptosis in IECs plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
  chronic intestinal diseases, but several scientific pieces of evidences are needed
  to fill this gap. D: The increase in iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and lipid
  ROS accumulation and decrease in GPX4 activation through system Xc− inhibition lead
  to the destruction of IECs and intestinal hyperpermeability. However, the evidence
  for supporting ferroptosis in IECs is very less. DAMPS, Damage-associated molecular
