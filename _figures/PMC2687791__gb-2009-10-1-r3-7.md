caption: 'GG, EG, and EE links in the calcium signaling pathway. The gene layout is
  the same as the layout in the KEGG pathway database. A red line represents a GG
  link. The two gene pairs with GG links happen to also have EE links (''GG & EE'').
  A blue line represents an EE link and a green line represents an EG link. A dot
  at one end of a line is used to represent the exon in an EG link. The KEGG calcium
  signaling pathway is enriched with EG and EE links with p-values 0.01 and 0.001.
  However, GG links are not enriched in the pathway, with a p-value of 0.354. Each
  box represent the corresponding component in the KEGG database: 1, NCX; 2, PMCA;
  3, GPCR; 4, SOC; 5, CaV1; 6, ROC; 7, GPCR; 8, PTK; 9, CD38; 10, Gs; 11, Gq; 12,
  ADCY; 13, PLCδ; 14, PLCβ; 15, PLCγ; 16, PLCε; 17, SPHK; 18, PKA; 19, PLN; 20, SERCA;

  CAMK; 30, NOS; 31, PDE1; 32, FAK2; 33, PKC; 34, PPID. A circle in a box represents
  a gene in the corresponding component.'
