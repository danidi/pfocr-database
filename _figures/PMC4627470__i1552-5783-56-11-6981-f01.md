caption: Schematic of sensory and reflex pathways regulating tear production and corneal
  sensation in the rat. Corneal sensation and tear film status are monitored by corneal
  afferents that innervate the corneal epithelium, have their cell bodies in the trigeminal
  ganglion (TG), and send projections via the trigeminal nerve (purple line) to the
  trigeminal dorsal horn (DH). Ascending pathways from the DH (red arrows) mediate
  pain and behavior in response to corneal stimulation. A separate reflex circuit
  from the DH (dotted lines) mediates tear production (Tears) via the parasympathetic
  reflex pathway through the superior salivatory nucleus (SSN) and pterygopalatine
  ganglion (PPG) to the lacrimal gland (Lac). In our novel DED rat model, a saporin
  toxin is microinjected into the extraorbital lacrimal gland (Lac) and ablates a
  portion of the innervating cholinergic nerve fibers (ACh) that originate in the
  PPG. ACh, acetylcholine; CNS, central nervous system; PNS, peripheral nervous system.
