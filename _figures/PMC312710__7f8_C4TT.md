caption: Model of RegA regulation by differential degradation. RegA is a key regulator
  as it controls, in part, the concentration of intracellular cAMP. RegA is differentially
  degraded via a pathway that requires the F-box/WD40-repeat-containing protein FbxA
  and the cullin CulA. The pathway requires ERK2, a MAP kinase activated through the
  cAMP receptor. We propose that ERK2-mediated phosphorylation of RegA (circled P)
  targets RegA's interaction with FbxA and the ubiquitination machinery that includes
  CulA. In addition, RegA's PDE activity is positively regulated by a His kinase two-component
  phosphorelay pathway (boxed P) (, ). The His kinase (generic) is shown as a transmembrane
  protein with a His kinase domain and a response regulator-motif Asp residue, as
  is the case with known Dictyostelium His kinases (; ). It transfers the phosphate
  (boxed P) to a His residue on RdeA, which transfers it to a receiving Asp in the
  response regulatory domain of RegA, stimulating its activity (, ). Whereas the His
  kinase is not specified, the one with a knockout phenotype consistent with this
  model is (). RegA PDE activity may be negatively regulated by two-component system
  pathways during culmination (,). ERK2 may also negatively regulate RegA PDE enzymatic
  activity during the aggregation stage of development through its direct phosphorylation
  (A. Kuspa, pers. comm.). This is indicated in the model by the broken line with
  a bar at the end. It is not known whether ERK2 phosphorylates RegA at different
  sites or the same sites for these two different modes of regulation.
