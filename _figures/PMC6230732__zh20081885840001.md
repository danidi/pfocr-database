caption: Model of WNK-SPAK/OSR1 [with no lysine (K) kinase-Ste20-related proline/alanine-rich
  kinase/oxidative stress response 1] signaling in the Drosophila renal tubule. Flies
  have four renal tubules, an anterior pair and a posterior pair, that lie in the
  abdominal cavity bathed in hemolymph. Urine generation by the tubule main segments
  occurs by the transepithelial secretion of cations through principal cells and chloride
  through stellate cells. The apically located vacuolar H+-ATPase drives fluid secretion
  by generating a lumen-positive transepithelial potential that allows exchange of
  protons for cations (primarily potassium in the Drosophila tubule). Chloride secretion
  is also driven by the lumen-positive charge (, , ). In the principal cell, the sodium-potassium-2-chloride
  (NKCC) encoded by Ncc69, and inwardly-rectifying potassium channels encoded by Irk1
  and Irk2, are required for normal transepithelial ion flux. Sodium entering through
  the NKCC is recycled by the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase (, ). Chloride may be recycled
  as well, as there is an outwardly-directed basolateral chloride conductance, whose
  molecular identity is unknown (). Drosophila WNK and Fray (the fly SPAK/OSR1 homolog)
  are positive regulators of transepithelial ion flux through the NKCC (). Hypotonic
  bathing medium, which stimulates transepithelial ion flux in a WNK-, Fray-, and
  NKCC-dependent manner (), results in a decrease in principal cell intracellular
  chloride concentration over ten to sixty minutes, and an increase in tubule Drosophila
  melanogaster (Dm)WNK activity at thirty to sixty minutes. Drosophila Mo25 is also
  required for stimulation of transepithelial ion flux by hypotonic bathing medium.
  The overexpression of Mo25 with a chloride-insensitive WNK mutant in adult tubules
  is sufficient to increase transepithelial ion flux in isotonic conditions, indicating
  a cooperative role for chloride and Mo25 in regulation of WNK pathway activation
