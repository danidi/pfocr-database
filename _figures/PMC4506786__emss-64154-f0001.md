caption: Different linkage types of ubiquitin chains including Met 1-, Lys 11-, Lys
  48-, and Lys 63-linked ubiquitin chains participate in the TNF-induced NF-κB signaling
  pathway and have roles in fine-tuning the regulation of the downstream cascade.
  Ubiquitin chains are generated by E3 ligases (shown in orange), such as cIAP, HOIP
  containing LUBAC complex, and SCF-βTrCP. These ubiquitin chains are hydrolyzed by
  DUBs (in yellow) such as OTULIN and CYLD. A20 has a dual role as an E3 ligase as
  well as a DUB. Ubiquitination of the substrates including cIAPs, RIPK1, NEMO, and
  IκB-α have shown to be critical for the signaling pathway.
