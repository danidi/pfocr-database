caption: Binding of β2-agonist to β2AR induces a conformational change allowing the
  α-subunit of the G-protein to dissociate and bind to adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl
  cyclase is thus activated and catalyses the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from
  ATP. cAMP molecules bind to PKA which induces the dissociation of the catalytic
  and regulatory subunitsfrom each other. Once released, the PKA catalytic subunits
  phosphorylate and hence activate myriad cellular targets which results in airway
  smooth muscle relaxation and hence bronchodilation.
