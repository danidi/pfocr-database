caption: NF-κB is held in the latent state in the cytoplasm by its inhibitor IκB.
  When TNFα binds to the TNF receptor (TNFR), IκB kinase (IKK) gets activated and
  phosphorylates the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) that is subsequently ubiquitinated and
  degraded. The free NF-κB enters the nucleus where it regulates the transcription
  of several genes. Among them is the gene for IκB that is up regulated by NF-κB.
  The synthesized IκB, on binding to NF-κB, promotes its export to the cytoplasm and
  holds it in latent state thus forming a negative feedback loop.
