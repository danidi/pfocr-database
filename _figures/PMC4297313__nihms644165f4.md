caption: 'Proposed model for potential competition for the use of the mTOR pathway
  between interferons (IFNs) and oncogenic signals/growth factors (OS/GFs) for transcription
  of genes and mRNA translation/protein expression of products that account for distinct
  and opposing biological responses. In the case of the Type I IFN receptor there
  is also documented cross-regulation of STAT-pathways by mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and STAT2, although the intermediate kinases and specific pathways involved
  remain to be identified. Abbreviations: ISG, IFN-stimulated genes; MG, mitogenic
  genes; TF, transcription factors.'
