caption: Model for the roles of Ras and Mob2 in S. cerevisiae. Ras proteins have PKA-independent
  functions in mitotic exit and actin repolarization and PKA-dependent functions affecting
  metabolism, transcription, and cell growth. Cbk1, together with Mob2, regulates
  the Ace2 transcription factor, effecting daughter cell-specific gene expression.
  Cbk1 and Mob2 have additional Ace2-independent functions in regulating apical growth
  and mating projection formation. Hym1 interacts with Kic1 and Sog2, and this complex
  along with Pag1 interacts with Cbk1 to promote its localization and function. Data
  presented in this report demonstrate that the Ras/PKA and Cbk1/Mob2 pathways play
  parallel roles in cell growth and bud site selection, likely through regulation
  of Rho1 (see Discussion for details). Cbk1 and the Ras/PKA pathway independently
  repress cellular trehalose levels through a different mechanism.
