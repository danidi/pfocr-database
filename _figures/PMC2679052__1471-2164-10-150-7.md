caption: Diagram summarizing differences in expression of interaction genes enriched
  within the KEGG p53 signaling pathway, and possible interactions of corresponding
  proteins with the androgen receptor. Boxes are in red or green when gene expression
  is increased or decreased in CX male C57BL/6J mice, respectively. Lines terminating
  with an arrowhead indicate positive regulation, those terminating with a bar indicate
  negative regulation. The values represent the ratio of mRNA abundance in CX male
  C57BL/6J vs C57.YA hearts.
