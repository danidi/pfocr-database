caption: Overall scheme of key genetic and epigenetic events in colorectal tumorigenesis.
  Both genetic and epigenetic changes play important roles in colorectal tumorigenesis.
  Genetic changes may be broadly classified into two categories; chromosomal instability
  (CIN) and microsatellite instability (MSI). Although about 80% of tumors exhibit
  chromosomal instability, stability of microsatellite DNA and involves chromosomal
  aberrations such as loss of heterozygosity. The typical genetic events associated
  with tumors in this pathway are shown. MSI is found in most cases of hereditary
  non-polyposis colorectal cancer and in 15% of sporadic tumors. This pathway involves
  inactivation of DNA mismatch repair genes caused by promoter hypermethylation of
  hMLH1 followed by mutations in the microsatellite sequences of the genes important
  in tumor progression such as TGFβ RII and BAX. MSI is a late event in colorectal
  tumorigenesis and chromosomal aberrations are rare in MSI tumors. There are two
  major epigenetic aberrations that occur during colorectal tumorigenesis, global
  DNA hypomethylation and region specific or promoter hypermethylation of CpG islands
  (CGI). Global DNA hypomethylation occurs early in colorectal tumorigenesis (aberrant
  crypt foci/hyperplastic polyps) and remains at constant levels during tumor progression.
  It is frequently associated with chromosomal instability. CGI promoter hypermethylation
  also occurs early in colorectal tumorigenesis, but the propensity of methylation
  increases with tumor progression. In addition, different frequencies and patterns
  of promoter methylation of specific genes are observed during tumor initiation and
  progression. CGI promoter hypermethylation is frequently associated with BRAF mutation
  and MSI.
