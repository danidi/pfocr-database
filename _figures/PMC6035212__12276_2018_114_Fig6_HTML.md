caption: CSE increases IL-8 production in lung epithelial cells. Released IL-8 recruits
  neutrophils into the lungs. Neutrophils secrete several proteases including NE.
  NE induces IL-8 production via the PAR2-mediated activation of ERK. CSE upregulates
  PAR2 through a p38-dependent pathway, which enhances NE-induced IL-8 production.
  A vicious cycle causing continued neutrophil accumulation and inflammation exists
