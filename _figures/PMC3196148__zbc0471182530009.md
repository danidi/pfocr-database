caption: Working model for the ATF4-dependent and c-JUN-dependent AA signaling pathways.
  The GCN2-eIF2α-ATF4 pathway that culminates in ATF4 binding to CARE sites has been
  well documented (). The novel information in this study illustrates the existence
  of a ERK-JNK-c-JUN/ATF2 pathway that functions independently of ATF4 by assembling
  c-JUN-c-JUN or c-JUN-ATF2 dimers at AP-1 sites. Although not indicated for clarity,
  it is known that ATF2 also participates in activating ATF4-dependent genes by catalyzing
  histone acetylation (, ). The dashed lines indicate that the mechanism is unknown.
