caption: 'Signaling pathways activated after binding of E2 and G1 to GPER. Six different
  signaling pathways are distinguished: (1) EGF-receptor-pathway, (2) calcium-signaling,
  (3) cAMP-pathway, (4) IχB-pathway, (5) Hippo-pathway, and (6) HOTAIR-pathway. EGF,
  epidermal growth factor; MMP, matrix-metalloproteases; GPER, G-protein coupled estrogen
  receptor 1; Erk1/2, extracellular regulated kinase 1 and 2; PI3K, phosphoinositol-3-kinase;
  PLC, phospholipase C; IP3, inositol-triphosphate; cAMP, cyclic adenosine-monophosphate;
  PKA, protein kinase A; CREB, cAMP-responsive element binding protein; IB, inhibitor
  of ; IKKβ, inhibitor of  kinase β; MST1/2, mammalian sterile 20-like 1 and 2; LATS,
  large tumor suppressor; YAP, yes-associated protein; TAZ, transcriptional coactivator
  with PDZ binding motif; HOTAIR, HOX-transcript antisense intergenic RNA; FOXO3a,
  forkhead box 3a; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; After binding of 17β-estradiol
  or G1 to GPER various signaling pathways are activated in the cytosol. Ligand binding
  to GPER leads to the detachment of the βγ-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins.
  The EGF-receptor pathway starts with the activation of the kinase Src by βγ-G-protein
  that activates MMPs, liberating EGF from heparin-bound EGF. EGF binding to EGF-receptor
  leads to auto-phosphorylation of the EGF-receptor that activates MAP-kinase Erk1/2
  and PI3-kinase. Activated Erk induces transcription of c-fos, Egr-1, ERRα and aromatase
  in the nucleus followed by the induction of CTGF. PI3-kinase is also activated by
  the phosphorylated EGF-receptor and phosphorylates the kinase Akt that phosphorylates
  transcription factor FOXO3a in the nucleus that is subsequently exported to the
  cytosol, where FOXO3a is degraded. The Calcium signaling pathway starts with the
  released α-subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins that activates phospholipase C.
  PLC cleaves Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphat to diacylglycerol and IP3. IP3
  releases calcium ions from cytosolic calcium-stores. Ca2+ activates several enzymes
  in the cytosol among other things Ca2+ additionally activates Erk1/2. Binding of
  17β-estradiol to GPER also opens calcium L-channels in the plasma membrane by a
  yet unsolved mechanism. The released α-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein also
  activates the adenolyl-cyclase (AC) in the cytosol. cAMP generated by AC activates
  protein kinase A (PKA) that phosphorylates the cAMP response element binding protein
  (CREB). Phosphorylated CREB binds as a transcription factor to promoters of genes
  containing a cAMP response element, for example cyclinD1, that supports the progress
  of the cell cycle. Less elucidated are the IB-pathway, Hippo-pathway and HOTAIR-pathway
  represented in this figure by hatched arrows. In the course of the IB-pathway IKKβ
  is activated that phosphorylates IB, an inhibitor of NF-B. Phosphorylated IB is
  degraded via the ubiquitination pathway allowing NFB action. In the course of the
  Gα-protein dependent Hippo-pathway MST1/2 are activated that phosphorylates LATS,
  a kinase phosphorylating the transcription factors YAP and TAZ that are subsequently
  degraded. In the HOTAIR-pathway expression of miR148a is inhibited in a Gα-dependent
  manner, but the intermediate steps leading to transcription of this microRNA are
  not completely elucidated, in this figure exemplified by a hatched arrow. Suppression
  of miR148a expression leads to an increased expression of HOTAIR that finally supports
  metastasis.'
