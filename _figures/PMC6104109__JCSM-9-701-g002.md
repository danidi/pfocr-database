caption: Canonical pathways of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction.
  The canonical pathways of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dysfunction
  were dysregulated in the muscle samples from breast cancer patients compared with
  non‐cancer controls. The shading pattern of the individual electron transport chain
  complexes is used as an indicator of the degree of predicted dysfunction, with a
  greater percentage of light shading suggestive of greater dysfunction. Individual
  genes that were significantly down‐regulated are identified within the specific
  electron transport chain complex. Specific dysregulated genes were identified using
  DESqe2, while the canonical pathways of oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial
  dysfunction were identified using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate; IMM, Inner Mitochondrial Membrane.
