caption: Identification and targeting of the ATF6 UPR signaling pathway. A, mechanism
  of ATF6 activation and downstream transcriptional signaling. B, domain architecture
  of ATF6, including the N-terminal bZIP transcription factor domain, the transmembrane
  domain (TM), and the luminal domain. Upon ATF6 activation, the N-terminal cytosolic
  domain containing the leucine zipper motif is liberated via processing in the golgi
  as shown in A, resulting in release of the active ATF6 transcription factor. Specific
  inhibiting (red) or activating (blue) mutations in ATF6 implicated in achromatopsia
  are indicated. C, structures of ATF6 inhibitors, including the S1P inhibitors PF429242
  and AEBSF and the selective ATF6 inhibitor Ceapin-A7. D, structures of ATF6-activating
  compounds BiX, AA147, and AA263.
