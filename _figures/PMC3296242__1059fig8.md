caption: 'Models of interactions within the destruction complex (A) and the catalytic
  cycle of the destruction complex (B). (A) On the basis of the ability of Axin and
  APC to self-associate in vivo, we predict that these interactions contribute to
  the assembly of the functional “destructosome”. We have depicted Axin and APC here
  as dimers, but the formation of higher-order assemblages has not been ruled out.
  (B) Step 1: the APC–Axin–kinase complex assembles onto the Axin scaffold. APC is
  in its non-P state. Step 2: βcat enters the complex via interactions with Axin and
  Arm repeats 1–5 and with the extended region of a 20R of APC through Arm repeats
  5–9. Step 3: GSK3β and CKI phosphorylate both βcat and APC. This results in the
  loss of the Axin–βcat interaction as P-APC outcompetes Axin. Step 4: The P-APC-P–βcat
  complex dissociates from Axin. Step 5: Proteosome-associated chaperones separate
  APC and βcat. βcat proceeds to degradation by the proteosome while P-APC is released.
  Step 6: P-APC is dephosphorylated, perhaps via PP2A. It is now able to reenter the
  Axin–kinase complex.'
