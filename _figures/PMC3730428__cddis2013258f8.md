caption: Schematic diagram summarizing the key findings. (a) Recruitment of cIAP to
  TNFR1 following binding by TNFα is mediated by TRADD and TRAF2 and results in RIPK1
  ubiquitination, which then promotes activation of pro-survival NFκB signaling (via
  the LUBAC/IKK signalling complexes) and activation of the MAPK pathway (via the
  TAB/TAK complex). (b) In the presence of SMCs, cIAPs are polyubiquitinated and degraded
  by the proteasome, and RIPK1 is recruited to a second complex (Complex IIb) where
  it recruits FADD, FLIP and procaspase 8. SMCs can also block XIAP-mediated inhibition
  of caspases 3, 7 and 9. If present in sufficient amounts, FLIP will inhibit activation
  of caspase 8 at Complex IIb and thereby limit the activation of the downstream executioner
  caspases 3 and 7 with the result that the cells survive. (c) HDAC inhibitors such
  as SAHA efficiently target FLIP for degradation via the proteasome. Thus, when cells
  are cotreated with SAHA and SMC, procaspase 8 homodimers are recruited to Complex
  IIb, resulting in caspase 8 activation and subsequent activation of the executioner
  caspases and induction of apoptosis. The activation of the executioner caspases
  is further facilitated by SMC-mediated inhibition of XIAP
