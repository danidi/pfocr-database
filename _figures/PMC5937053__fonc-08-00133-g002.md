caption: The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad signaling pathway. TGF-β dimers
  bind to two TβRII receptors that induce the assembly of two TβRI and two TβRII receptors
  into a heterotetrameric complex in which TβRII phosphorylates and activates TβRI.
  Smad3 (S3) is then phosphorylated and activated by TβRI. Activated S3 dissociates
  from the Smad anchor for receptor activation protein (SARA) and recruits Smad4 (S4).
  This protein complex is translocated into the nucleus to regulate target gene expression
  in association with cofactors (Co-F) and/or p300. Smad7 (S7) recruits E3-ubiquitin
  ligases (Smurf1 and Smurf2) to activate TRβI, resulting in receptor degradation.
