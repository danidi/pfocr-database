caption: Diagram illustrating a general overview of the siRNA-mediated antiviral response
  in an insect cell and the points at which VSRs of insect-infecting viruses are known
  or thought to interfere with the pathway. Viral dsRNA triggers the siRNA pathway
  and is processed into siRNAs by Dcr2.The siRNAs are loaded into the RISC by Dcr2
  and R2D2. The passenger strand is removed by C3PO and the guide strand is methylated
  by Hen1. The guide strand binds complementary viral dsRNA, which is then cleaved.
  FHV B2, WhNV B2, and DXV VP3 have been shown to bind small and long dsRNA, whereas
  DCV 1A binds only long dsRNA. HvAV-3e orf27 may competitively degrade dsRNA to prevent
  siRNA formation and/or loading. WhNV B2 potentially interacts with Dcr2 directly
  to inhibit function. CrPV 1A and Nora virus VP1 appear to directly interfere with
  the function of Ago2/RISC to prevent target cleavage.
