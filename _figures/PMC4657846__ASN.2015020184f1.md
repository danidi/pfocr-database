caption: The normal complement cascade. The complement system can be activated by
  the classic pathway, the lectin pathway, and the AP, all resulting in the formation
  of C3 convertases. The classic pathway is initiated by immune complexes that interact
  with C1q, ultimately leading to the formation of the classic pathway C3 convertase
  C4bC2a. The lectin pathway generates the same C3 convertase C4bC2a but is activated
  by the binding of mannose-binding lectins (MBLs) to carbohydrate moieties found
  primarily on the surface of microbial pathogens. The AP is capable of autoactivation
  by a mechanism called tick over of C3. Tick over occurs spontaneously at a low rate,
  generating a conformationally changed C3, which is referred to as C3(H2O). C3(H2O)
  is capable of binding CFB, resulting in the cleavage of CFB by complement factor
  D (CFD) and generating Ba and Bb and the formation of the AP C3 convertase C3 (H2O)Bb.
  Any of the C3 convertases can cleave C3 to C3a and C3b. The C3b fragment can bind
  to CFB. After the cleavage of CFB by CFD, the C3 convertase C3bBb is formed. This
  C3 convertase cleaves more C3 to C3b to generate even more C3 convertase in a powerful
  amplification loop, resulting in the full activation of the complement system. The
  plasma protein properdin stabilizes C3bBb and provides a platform for its in situ
  assembly on microbial surfaces, apoptotic cells, and malignant cells. C3b also initiates
  the terminal complement cascade by the formation of the C5 convertase through association
  with either of the C3 convertases (C4bC2aC3b or C3bBbC3b). The C5 convertase then
  cleaves C5 to C5a and C5b. C5b subsequently binds to C6, facilitating the binding
  of C7, C8, and C9 and culminating in the formation of the C5b-9 terminal membrane
  attack complex (MAC). The latter forms pores in the membrane of pathogens and damaged
  self-cells, thus promoting cell lysis. C3a and C5a are anaphylatoxins and among
  the most powerful effectors of complement activation capable of inducing chemotaxis,
  cell activation, and inflammatory signaling. MASP, mannose-binding lectin–associated
  serine protease.
