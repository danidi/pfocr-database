caption: Primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are sequentially processed by Drosha into precursor
  miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), and then Dicer into mature miRNAs. The mature miRNA then represses
  its target mRNA by first binding to the mRNA 3’UTR region, followed by recruitment
  of the RISC complex which down-regulates the expression of mRNA transcripts via
  decreased mRNA stability or decreased translation. Figure reproduced with permission
