caption: Synthesis of plant phenolic compounds by shikimate pathway, shows the biosynthetic
  pathway of plant phenolic acids []. The phosphoenolpyruvate react with erythrose-4-phosphate
  to give chorismic acid, which is a precursor for tyrosine and phenylalanine which
  later serves as precursors for cinnamic acid derivatives. Predominantly benzoic
  acids are synthesized from chorismic acid via oxidative and non-oxidative pathways while
  iso chorismic acid serve as precursor for protocatechuic acid []
