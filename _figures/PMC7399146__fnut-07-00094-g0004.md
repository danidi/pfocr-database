caption: 'Physical exercise actions against aging brain and the apoptotic process.
  In the central boxes: Apoptosis can be divided into extrinsic and intrinsic signaling
  pathways. The extrinsic pathway illustrated in the upper central box is induced
  by death receptors such as FASL, and their ligands, FAS. On the other hand, the
  intrinsic pathway illustrated in the central inferior box is induced by signs that
  cause changes in the mitochondrial membrane, called mitochondrial outer membrane
  permeabilization (MOMP). This process generates macropores on the mitochondrial
  surface and a release of Cytochrome C, which once released by mitochondria binds
  to and induces APAF-1 and pro-caspase 9, forming the Apoptosome complex, which activates
  caspase 9 causing cell death. This pathway is mediated by anti-apoptotic proteins
  such as BCL-2 and BCL-XL, and pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX and BAK. In the
  left box, brain aging is illustrated, and a decrease of neurotrophic factors such
  as nerve growth factor (NGF) is observed, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor
  (BDNF), especially in dentate gyrus located on hippocampus, may be related to decreased
  cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. In addition, TNF-alpha, a pro-inflammatory
  cytokine, can increase the apoptosis process by intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
  and lead to the emergence of neurodegenerative diseases. Physical exercise effects,
  illustrated in the right box, act in reverse, increasing the amount of NGF and BDNF,
  increasing cell survival and culminating in decreased apoptosis. In addition, physical
  exercise inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha which, in
  low quantities, decreases the extrinsic apoptosis process.'
