caption: Viral appropriation of cellular nucleocytoplasmic transport. (A) Classical
  protein nuclear import mediated by Importin-α (Imp-α; green) and Importin-β (Imp-β;
  blue), and nuclear export pathways mediated by Crm1 (pink). (B–F) Selected examples
  of viruses perturbing or utilizing different components of the nuclear transport
  pathway. (B) Viruses can utilize the classical Imp-α/β pathway, Imp-β directly,
  the nuclear pore complex (NPC), or transportin through a PY-nuclear localization
  signal (PY-NLS) for nuclear import as well as Crm1 for nuclear export. (C) Viral
  proteins can perturb global nuclear transport by altering the dynamics of the NPC
  though the degradation or phosphorylation of nucleoporins (Nups). (D) Preventing
  nuclear import, or promoting export, of cellular proteins such as signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3),
  or nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) can block the antiviral innate immune response.
  (E) Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) capsid protein forms a tetrameric
  complex with Imp-α/β and Crm1 that “clogs” the NPC blocking import of other cellular
  proteins. (F) During hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, key Nups are recruited to
  the membranous web, forming a “viral NPC”, to regulate transport of cellular and
  viral proteins as well as block access of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such
  as melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible
  gene I (RIG-I). Figure created with BioRender.
