caption: Overview of the complement pathways. The classical pathway is initiated by
  recognition of immune complexes while the lectin pathway is initiated by recognition
  of carbohydrates or glycans on the pathogen’s surface, resulting in the convergence
  of the two pathways with cleavage of C2 and C4 to generate C2a, C2b, C4a and C4b.
  C2a and C4a remain soluble to act as inflammatory mediators while C2b and C4b form
  the C3 convertase C4b2b. C3 is then cleaved by C4b2b to generate anaphylatoxin C3a
  and C3b. C3b can serve as an opsonin, or, upon binding with the C3 convertase, forms
  the C5 convertase C4b2b3b. C5 is then cleaved producing C5a and C5b. C5a is another
  potent inflammatory mediator while C5b initiates MAC formation and results in cytolytic
  activity. The alternative pathway can be initiated by (a) spontaneous hydrolysis
  of soluble C3 producing C3(H2O), or (b) non-covalent binding of properdin to the
  target membrane. C3(H2O) binds with Factor B and Factor D which cleaves Factor B
  into Ba and Bb. C3(H2O) and Bb form one of the alternative pathway C3 convertases.
  Properdin binds with C3b and Factor B, cleaving Factor B to produce the other alternative
  pathway C3 convertase C3bBb. C3 cleavage is amplified in the alternative pathway
  and accounts for approximately 70% of complement activity. The C3 convertase C3bBb
  binds with another C3b fragment forming the alternative pathway C5 convertase C3bBb3b.– MAC, membrane
  attack complex.
