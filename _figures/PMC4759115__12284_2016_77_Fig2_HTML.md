caption: 'Summary of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in photosynthesis
  and tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway. Mapping and distribution of DEGs, involved in
  photosynthesis and tetrapyrrole synthesis pathway (TSP), in indica rice variety
  RP2068-18-3-5 (RP), challenged with the Asian rice gall midge biotype 1 (GMB1).
  (a) DEGs involved in light reaction of photosynthesis; (b) DEGs involved in Calvin
  cycle; (c) DEGs involved in TSP. Transcripts showing more than 2-fold change between
  infested (RP-I) and un-infested (RP-UI) tissues of the resistant host RP have been
  mapped. Transcripts significantly up- or down-regulated are indicated in blue or
  red, respectively. Grey circles represent genes whose expression did not change
  more than 2-fold. For detailed information on these transcripts refer Additional
