caption: A neuronal model for olfactory associative learning in Drosophila, involving
  the cAMP signal transduction pathway. Sensory input from olfactory cues produces
  neural activity in mushroom body neurons (MBNs), producing an increase in intracellular
  calcium. Sensory input from footshock also activates MBNs via a modulatory neuron,
  which releases dopamine (DA) or serotonin (5HT) synthesized by the Dopa decarboxylase(Ddc)
  gene. This monoamine neurotransmitter binds to its postsynaptic receptor (R?) on
  the MBNsand activates a rutabaga (rut)-encoded adenylyl cyclase (AC) via a stimulatory
  subunit of G-protein (Gs), which itself is encoded by theDrosophila Gsα (dGsα) gene.
  Coincident activation of AC by calcium and G-protein leads to a synergistic increase
  in intracellular cAMP, which is hydrolyzed by dunce (dnc)-encoded phosphodiesterase
  (PDE). Increased cAMP levels may be involved in several intracellular effects (?),
  but nevertheless cAMP binds to an RI regulatory subunit of PKA (RI), encoded by
  the Drosophila PKA-RI (dPKA-RI) gene. cAMP binding causes RI dimers to disassociate
  from dimers of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKA), encoded by DC0. FreePKA then is
  able to phosphorylate many cytoplasmic targets (?), one of which is a potassium
  channel (K+ channel) composed of Shaker subunits. Free PKAalso is translocated to
  the nuclei of MBNs, where it phosphorylates the CREB transcription factor (CREB)
  encoded by dCREB2. Phosphorylated CREBthen initiates a cascade of gene expression
  that produces gene products (?) involved with long-term functional and structural
  changes at MBN synapses. The neuronal effect of these biochemical changes is to
  increase transmitter efficacy between MBNs and their follower neurons, which mediate
  the motor output responsible for conditioned odor avoidance responses. This model
  assumes MBNs to be sights of associative learning because chemical ablation of MBNs
  or molecular disruption of G-protein function in MBNs completely abolishes olfactory
  associative learning. Protein components of the signal transduction pathway are
  labeled only after disruptions of identified genes are shown to produce defects
  in olfactory associative learning that cannot be attributed to nonspecific effects
  on the sensory or motor responses required to perform this task. Other neural substrates
  or signal transduction pathways will be added to this working model as they are
  revealed in future studies (see text for more details).
