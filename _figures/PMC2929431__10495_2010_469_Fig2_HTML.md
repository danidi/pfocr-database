caption: 'Summary of the role of apoptotic cells in different immunosuppressive therapies.
  Apoptotic cell therapy, ECP, DST, tolerogenic DC therapies and anti-CD3 Ab immunotherapy
  likely modulate Ag-specific immune responses and inflammation in transplantation
  by a common mechanism: in vivo generation of apoptotic cells. Therapeutically-administered
  (i.v.) or -induced apoptotic cells deliver potent immunosuppressive signals plus
  the entire repertoire of donor Ag (the latter in apoptotic cell therapy, DST and
  tolerogenic DC therapies) to quiescent APC of secondary lymphoid organs. Presentation
  of donor Ag by these quiescent APC induces defective activation of indirect pathway
  CD4 T cells followed by T cell deletion and generation of Treg. As a consequence
  of the regulatory effects of apoptotic cells on donor-reactive T lymphocytes, allo-specific
  B cells do not receive adequate help from indirect pathway CD4 T cells and therefore,
  are unable to differentiate into the plasma cells that secrete alloAb'
