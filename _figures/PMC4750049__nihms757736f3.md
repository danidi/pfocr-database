caption: The proposed biosynthetic pathway of trypacidin. The protein putatively catalysing
  each step is indicated over the arrow, and the dehydration potentially occurs spontaneously.
  Genes-encoding enzymes in bold were deleted in this study, whereas the assignment
  of roles for enzymes that are in regular font and parentheses were made based on
  comparison to similar characterized biosynthetic pathways. The assignment of the
  methyltransferases TpcA, TpcH and TpcM was determined by analysis of a ΔtpcA strain
  () and comparison to the proposed cluster and biosynthetic pathway for geodin ().
  Note the conversion of questin to desmethylsulochrin, and similar reactions in monodictyphenone
  and aflatoxin biosynthesis, have multiple proposed mechanisms (,; ).
