caption: 'Ca2+-dependent glutamate release from astrocytes utilizes a  vesicular,
  exocytotic pathway. Astrocytes express protein machinery  necessary to execute exocytotic
  release of glutamate: the SNARE proteins  synaptobrevin 2(Sb2)/cellubrevin (Cb),
  syntaxin 1, and SNAP23, along with  vesicle filling proteins vesicular glutamate
  transporters (VGLUTs) isoforms 1-3  and vacuolar-type H+-ATPase  (V-ATPase). Glutamate
  (Glu) can be synthesized in astrocytes de novo from  pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic
  acid cycle in mitochondria (mito) via pyruvate carboxylase (PC); glucose is broken
  down to pyruvate in the cytosol.  Glutamate is converted from the cycle intermediate,
  α-ketoglutarate (α-KG),  usually by transamination of aspartate via mitochondrial
  aspartate  aminotransferase (AST). The synthesized glutamate once in the cytosol
  can then  be converted to glutamine (Gln) by glutamine synthetase (GS), or transported  into
  vesicles via vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs). Glutamate  dehydrogenase
  (GDH) normally generates α-KG by oxidative deamination. Drawing is  not to scale.
  For simplicity syntaxin is shown truncated with its molecule  portion N-terminal
  to the SNARE domain missing.'
