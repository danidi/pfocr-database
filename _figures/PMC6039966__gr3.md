caption: The AhR genomic pathway. When a ligand crosses the plasma membrane (passive
  diffusion), it binds to the AhR (the PAS B domain). This allows the translocation
  of the ligand-receptor complex into the nucleus and the dissociation of the receptor
  complex. In the nucleus, the complex heterodimerizes with its partner ARNT (AhR
  Nuclear Translocator also called HIF-1β) . The heterodimer binds specific DNA sequences
  located in the promoter regions of target genes named xenobiotic response elements
  (XRE, 5′-TA/TGCGTG-3′) . AhR-ARNT induces the transcription of target genes by the
  recruitment of various components of the transcriptional machinery  such as CBP/p300
  (cAMP response element-binding protein binding protein) , , , SRC-1 (steroid receptor
  coactivator 1), p160/bHLH-PAS, NCoA2/GRIP1/TIF2 (Nuclear receptor Coactivator 2/Glucocorticoid
  Receptor Interacting Protein 1/Transcriptional Intermediate Factor 2) and p/CIP
  (p300/CBP/CoIntegrator-associated Protein)  as well as other transcriptional coactivators
  such as RIP140 (Receptor Interacting Protein 140) ,  or ATP-dependent chromatin
  remodeling components such as BRG-1 (Brahma Related Gene). After being exported
  out of the nucleus, the AhR is rapidly degraded in the cytoplasmic compartment by
  the proteasome . Other post-translational modifications such as SUMOylation of the
  human AhR have been observed .
