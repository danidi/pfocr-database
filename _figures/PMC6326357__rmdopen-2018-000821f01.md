caption: Potential role of MAIT cells in spondyloarthritis (SpA). MAIT cells are activated
  by MR1 ligands derived from bacteria and yeasts able to produce vitamin B2 (riboflavin)
  metabolites. Cytokines, such as IL-7, IL-12, IL-18 and IFN-γ, can also directly
  activate MAIT cells by an antigen-independent mechanism. MAIT cells are characterised
  by the semi-invariant T-cell receptor (TCR) composed by an invariant α chain (Vα7.2
  segment paired with Jα12, 20 or 33) and a restricted β chain repertoire (Vβ2, Vβ8,
  Vβ13 or Vβ22). They are CD8+ or double negative (CD4–/CD8–), express CD45RO isoform
  and high levels of CD161, several chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR5, CCR6, CXCR6,…)
  and interleukin (IL) receptors, as well transcription factors, including some involved
  in IL-17A production (IL-23R, RORγt/RORc). MAIT cells are preferentially located
  at the inner barriers, such as the lamina propria of the intestine. The α4 integrins
  (α4β1 and α4β7) regulate tissue homing of activated lymphocytes. MAIT may express
  α4β7 as a marker suggesting activation in the gut. MAIT express also α4β1 integrin
  (also known as VLA-4), associated with chemokine receptors responsible for homing
  to the sites of active inflammation, presumably sacroiliac joints, entheseal structures
  and peripheral joints in SpA. Once activated by microbial ligands, they can produce
  high levels of Th17 cytokines, IL-17A and IL-22, and also Th1 cytokines (TNF, IFN-γ).
  IL-17A promotes local inflammation, while IL-22 contributes to osteoproliferative
  changes and ligamentous ossifications. Circulating MAIT of patients with SpA express
  CD69 activation marker. Factors implicated in the type 1 response are in green,
  while factors involved in the type 17 pathway are in red. PLZF, promyelocytic leukaemia
  zinc finger; RORγt, retinoid-related orphan receptor-γt.
