caption: Model of IP. Based on our observations that preconditioning elicits caspase
  cleavage and ROS generation, which are required for protection, and that this protection
  requires new protein synthesis, we propose the following pathway. We hypothesize
  that the initial energetic stress put on cells generates ROS and activation of mitochondrial
  KATP channels. These events likely contribute to limited cytochrome c redistribution
  and caspase 3 activation. Cleaved caspases are likely held in check by preexisting
  proteins such as HSC 70. When these proteins are depleted, we speculate that this
  depletion results in the activation of a positive-feedback cycle that leads to increased
  production of HSPs. This up-regulation is then able to block normally lethal exposure
  to excitotoxic insults.
