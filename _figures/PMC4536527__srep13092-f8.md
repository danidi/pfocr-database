caption: Briefly, circulatory levels of saturate FFA are increased in diet-induced
  obesity. Saturated FFA could stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production in chondrocytes
  directly through TLR4. Meanwhile, the elevated FFA stimulates LDH-a-dependent lactate
  production in chondrocytes and perhaps also in other cells. Consequently, the levels
  of circulatory lactate are also increased in response to HFD treatment. The increased
  lactate would stabilize and activate HIF-1α protein in chondrocytes to stimulate
  the production of VEGF and proinflammatory cytokines. In summary, saturated FFA
  could stimulate proinflammatory cytokine production in chondrocytes directly through
  TLR4 or LDHa-lactate-HIF1α pathway, which provides a potential molecular mechanism
  linking obesity to chronic inflammation in osteoarthritis.
