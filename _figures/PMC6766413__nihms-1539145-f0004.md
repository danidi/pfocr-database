caption: μOR regulation of CXCR4 working modelMorphine or other μ-opioids binding
  to μORs on cortical neurons activates a Gαi-protein pathway that leads to de-acidification
  of endolysosomes, and efflux of endolysosomal iron to the cytoplasm. This increases
  labile iron levels in the neuron, resulting in increased production of the iron
  storage proteins ferritin heavy chain (FHC) and ferritin light chain (FLC) through
  a post-transcriptional mechanism. In addition to its iron storage functions, FHC
  also associates with the homeostatic chemokine receptor CXCR4 and blocks its downstream
  signaling. Normally, CXCR4 activation by its natural ligand CXCL12 increases dendritic
  spine density in cortical neurons, which may occur through activation of several
  pathways. First, CXCR4 activation leads to HDAC4 translocation to the nucleus, which
  regulates several genes involved in synaptic activity. Specific knockdown of HDAC4
  prevents CXCL12 from increasing dendritic spine density, suggesting that CXCL12/CXCR4
  signaling regulates synaptic protein expression. Second, CXCL12 may activate the
  Rac1/PAK pathway in cortical neurons, resulting in phosphorylation of the actin
  severing protein cofilin. Phosphorylated cofilin is unable to break down the actin
  cytoskeleton, which may result in stabilization of actin-rich dendritic spines.
