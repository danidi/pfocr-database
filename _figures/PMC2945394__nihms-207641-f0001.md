caption: '(A) Post-pandrial increase in insulin leads to induction of lipogenesis
  and inhibition of lipolysis. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the rate-limiting enzyme
  for the import of triglyceride-derived fatty acids from VLDL or chylomicrons for
  storage by the adipose tissue. Uptake of free fatty acids (FFA) involves passive
  diffusion through the lipid bilayer or protein-facilitated transfer. Within the
  adipocytes, FA are activated into acyl-CoA and 3 acyl-CoA are esterified with glycerol
  to form triglycerides (TG) stored into the lipid droplet. Additionally, insulin
  triggers glucose and amino acid (AA) transport into adipocytes that are metabolized
  into acetyl-CoA. ACC (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase) which converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA
  is the commited step of FA synthesis pathway. Leptin antagonizes lipogenesis and
  promotes lipolysis. (B) In some situations, white adipocytes can acquire brown adipocytes
  features and lipid stores are mobilized. Sequential breakdown of intracellular TG
  (lipolysis) provides FA and glycerol. Diglyceride formation (DG) is catalysed by
  HSL and ATGL, DG are hydrolysed by HSL and monoglyceride catabolizing involve MGL.
  Insulin and leptin have opposing action on lipolysis. FA and glycerol can be liberated
  in the circulation or FA can be oxidized in mitochondria. Fatty acid oxidation (FAO)
  forms substrates for the respiratory chain (RESP). ATP or heat can be produced by
  the discharge of the intermembrane space proton gradient via the ATP synthase or
  UCP, respectively. Leptin has been shown to exert direct and indirect stimulation
  in FAO. Abbreviations: CoA: coenzyme A, Glycerol-P: phospho-glycerol, PERA: perilipin
