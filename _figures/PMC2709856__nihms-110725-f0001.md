caption: 'Using TLR4, which can signal through both the MyD88 and TRIF pathways, as
  an example, this figure depicts how the shift from a proinflammatory to an anti-inflammatory
  response may be achieved to provide neuroprotection. Signaling through the MyD88
  pathway leads to the production of proinflammatory mediators, whereas signaling
  through the TRIF pathway both activates NF-κB and induces Type I IFNs and IFN-inducible
  genes. Experiments using MyD88- and TRIF-deficient mice that have been preconditioned
  with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) have led to the hypothesis that TRIF is the key adaptor
  protein for the TLR4 response to LPS preconditioning, since MyD88-deficient mice
  can be preconditioned whereas TRIF-deficient mice cannot. In turn, signaling down
  the TRIF pathway leads to the activation of NF-κB for proinflammatory responses
  and IRFs for anti-inflammatory responses. The initial TLR4 stimulation by LPS (solid
  line) may reprogram the subsequent TLR4 response to ischemia to one that activates
  IRFs and IFN production (dotted line). This reprogramming may be mediated by several
  pathway inhibitors (e.g., TRIM30α), which are upregulated after LPS preconditioning
  as well as ischemic insult, and may act to destabilize the TAK1 complex, which in
  turn blocks NF-κB activation.IFN: Interferon; IRF: IFN-regulatory factors; TAB:
  Transforming growth factor-B binding protein; TIR: Toll—interleukin 1 receptor;
