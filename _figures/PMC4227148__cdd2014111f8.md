caption: Hypothetical model of Syn mechanisms of action. Wt intracellular Syn sequester
  actin monomer in a contest in which the severing protein cofilin 1 is active. Increased
  levels of extracellular Syn shift the balance of actin dynamics toward polymerization.
  This effect is achieved through the inactivation of cofilin 1 by phosphorylation,
  triggered by the clustering of GRP78 at the plasma membrane and activation of the
  depicted signaling pathway
