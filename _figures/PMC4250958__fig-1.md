caption: Diagram of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathways. Intrinsic
  apoptosis (the left side of the figure) is usually the result of hypoxia, ischemia,
  or UV damage. These induce cell stress which is propagated through Casp2 and Trp53
  disruption of the balance of the mitochondrial membrane. Cycs is released after
  mitochondrial membrane disruption and recruited to form the apoptosome with Apaf1
  and pro-Casp9. Pro-Casp9 is cleaved and activates the caspase cascade resulting
  in cleavage and activation of Casp3, Casp6, and Casp7. The downstream effect of
  activation of the caspase cascade is DNA fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies,
  and cell death. The extrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway (the right side of the
  figure) requires binding of the death ligand (FasL or TNF-α) to its respective receptor
  (FasR or Tnfrsf1b). Binding of the death ligand to the death signals the recruitment
  of Tradd, Fadd, and pro-Casp8. Pro-Casp8 is cleaved by the complex and begins the
  caspase cleavage cascade resulting in the cleavage and activation of Casp3, Casp6,
  and Casp7. Similar to the intrinsic pathway, the result of the caspase cleavage
  cascade is DNA fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies, and cell death. ▲,
