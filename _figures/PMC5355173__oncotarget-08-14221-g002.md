caption: Two pathways activated by growth factors include the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTORC1
  and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways. Some of the regulatory interactions between
  GSK-3 and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways are indicated. A generic
  growth factor (GF) is indicated in purple and the corresponding growth factor receptor
  (GFR) are indicated in green and yellow. Ras is indicated by a purple oval. Shc,
  Grb2 and SOS are indicated in orange ovals. Kinases are indicated in green ovals.
  The p85 regulatory and the p110 catalytic subunits of PI3K are indicated in green
  ovals. The PTEN phosphatase which dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
  (PIP3) into phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) (yellow ovals) is indicated
  in a light brown octagon. The PP2A and PP1 phosphatases which may activate GSK-3
  by dephosphorylation are indicated in yellow octagons. TSC1 and TSC2 are indicated
  in light brown semi-circles. mTOR interacting proteins which positively regulate
  mTOR activity are indicated in yellow ovals. mTOR interacting proteins which negatively
  regulate mTOR activity are indicated in light brown ovals. Transcription factors
  activated by either ERK or Akt phosphorylation are indicated in yellow diamonds.
  The Foxo transcription factor FKHR that is inactivated by Akt phosphorylation is
  indicated by a light brown diamond. beta-catenin is indicated in light brown oval
  as it is inactivated after GSK-3 phosphorylation. Some of the types of proteins
  which are regulated by the beta-catenin pathway are indicated (c-Myc, c-Jun, PPPARδ,
  DKK, Axin2, VEGF, cyclin D). They are colored in light brown as their expression
  is inhibited by GSK-3 phosphorylation of beta-catenin. In addition, KRas can induce
  ERK which can result in activation of Ets and GSK-3 expression which can in turn
  have effects on IkappaK and NF-kappaB activity. Green arrows indicate activating
  events in pathways. Red arrows indicate inactivating events in pathway. Activating
  phosphorylation events are depicted in yellow circles with green Ps inside them.
  Inactivating phosphorylation events are depicted in yellow circles with red Ps inside
  them. This figure is provided to give the reader an idea of the multiple interactions
  of GSK-3 with various signaling molecules in the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  pathways.
