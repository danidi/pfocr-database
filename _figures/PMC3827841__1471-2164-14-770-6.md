caption: TGF-β and NOTCH activation in AoSMCs stimulated with P. gingivalis. Treatment
  of AoSMCs with viable P. gingivalis, increases the mRNA expression level of TGF-beta.
  TGF-beta is secreted as a latent complex which can be activated by a number of agents.
  The activation of TGF-beta interacts with TGFRII and this complex further phosphorylates
  TGFRI to activate the Smad pathway by phosphorylation at the carboxyl terminus.
  During this process, Smad anchor for receptor activation (SARA) can facilitate TGF-beta
  receptor complex to bind to R-Smads (Smad 2/3). Once the R-Smads being phosphorylated,
  they bind to Co-Smads to form a complex which go into nucleus and regulates the
  transcription of several targets genes involved in atherosclerosis. Beside this,
  TGF-beta and NOTCH pathway can collaborate with each other by direct interaction
  between Smad3 and NICD.
