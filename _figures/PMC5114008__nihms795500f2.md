caption: 'Cancer cells are exposed to diverse stress stimuli that activate the unfolded
  protein response (UPR), a homeostatic pathway that aims to restore ER folding capacity
  under ER stress conditions, but can induce cell death when restoration fails. Accumulation
  of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the ER activates three proteins that orchestrate
  the UPR: protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α),
  and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). PERK inhibits cap-dependent translation
  (via eIF2α phosphorylation) and activates transcription via translation of specific
  mRNAs, such as the transcription factor ATF4. PERK also regulates cellular bioenergetics
  by influencing mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis through crosstalk with components
  of metabolic pathways, such as AMPK. IRE1α activation results in splicing of the
  transcription factor uXBP-1 to its active form sXBP-1, which translocates to the
  nucleus and induces gene expression. IRE1α also splices other mRNAs to reduce the
  protein load in the ER, and modulates survival and autophagy by crosstalk with other
  pathway components such as JNK. Activation of ATF6 induces its translocation to
  the Golgi where it is cleaved to its active form. The transcriptional output of
  the UPR depends on the relative activity of each UPR arm and the degree of stress.
  All major transcription factors activated by the UPR regulate genes involved in
  restoring ER proteostasis, but specialized transcriptional programs are also activated.
  For example, the PERK–ATF4 arm regulates genes involved in autophagy and induces
  expression of the transcription factor CHOP, a major regulator of UPR-mediated apoptosis.
  A fine balance between homeostatic or apoptotic signals determines cellular outcome
  and thus, activation of the UPR can display pro or anti-metastatic effects, dependent
  on their degree of activation.'
