caption: 'A summary of methyl and methionine metabolism. Methionine is an ubiquitous
  amino acid acquired via tissue protein breakdown or dietary intake. Methionine is
  converted to SAM via irreversible adenosylation, which is used for transmethylation.
  Utilizing methyl groups from SAM, DNA, GAA, PE, glycine, and a number of other transmethylation
  precursors are transmethylated to methylated DNA, creatine, PC, sarcosine and other
  products, respectively. These transmethylation reactions are governed by the dietary
  availability of methionine, choline, betaine, and serine (via folate cycle) which
  are the primary methyl donors. The common end product of all transmethylation reactions
  is SAH, which is then converted to homocysteine. Homocysteine is either irreversibly
  oxidized to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway or remethylated to methionine
  via BHMT or MS. Enzymes involved in methyl metabolism are: MAT, methionine adenosyltransferase;
  GAMT, guanidinoacetate methyltransferase; PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase;
  DNMT, DNA methyltransferase; SAHH, S-adenosylhomocystine hydrolase; CBS, cystathionine
  beta-synthase; CGL, cystathionine gamma-lyase; BHMT, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase;
  MS, methionine synthase; SHMT, serine hydroxymethyltransferase; MTHFR, methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase. Metabolite abbreviations: SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine;
  GAA, guanidinoacetic acid; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine;
  DMG, dimethylglycine; THF, tetrahydrofolate; 5,10-CH3-THF, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate;
  5-CH3-THF, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.'
