caption: A single network was generated from the list of proteins that were differentially
  expressed in 2 week-old NOD mice compared to both control strains, NON and C57BL/6.
  The protein spots from which these proteins were identified were selected from the
  hierarchical cluster of 19 protein spots that had significant expression differences
  between strains at 2 weeks. The gene names derived from our uploaded lists (focus
  genes) are represented by gray icons. White icons represent genes (or endogenous
  chemicals) derived solely from the IPA knowledge base and that could be algorithmically
  connected to the focus genes.
