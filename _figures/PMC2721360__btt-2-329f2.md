caption: Expression by QPCR of selected genes from differentially expressed pathways.
  The charts show fold induction (±SD from triplicates) by APHS relative to DMSO treatment.
  The diagrams propose pathways that may underlie the observed expression changes.
  (A) Chronic inflammation mediated via COX-2 is associated with increased levels
  of prion protein. COX-2 inhibition may thus be related to reduced PRNP expression
  following APHS treatment. Prion protein binds to the laminin receptor 1 and can
  directly interact with Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), which is involved in reciprocal COX2 regulation.
  PRNP downregulation may sensitize cancer cells to apoptotic stimuli, while LAMR1
  expression correlates with tumor progression. (B) Retinoic acid (RA) is well known
  for its anticancer effects and is essential for proper colonic differentiation.
  Activation of the RA receptor-α is known to inhibit the growth of CRC cells in vitro.
  Many genes have been identified that can be induced by RA or its α-receptor and
  all are involved in antineoplastic processes. Integrinβ4, however, can also promote
  metastatic behavior. (C) The COX-2 product PGE2 has been shown to regulate Hif1a,
  Akt1, and Mapk8 (Sapk or Jnk1), which further can modulate Igfbp3 and Fhl2 levels
  via p53. The inhibition of these proteins by CIBs can lead to cancer cell apoptosis
  and growth reduction, however, some CIBs can also require activation of proteins
  such as Mapk8 for their anticancer action. In addition, complex and often reciprocal
  interactions exist between these proteins. The exact role of this pathway in CRC
  is thus difficult to assess. (D) The WNT pathway is initiated by signaling through
  Fzd receptors causing inhibition of the Apc-containing complex normally required
  for degradation of cytoplasmic β-catenin. β-catenin in turn can accumulate, translocate
  to the nucleus and induce transcription of MYC, the key mediator of colonic proliferation
  and self-renewal. The majority of CRCs harbor mutations that lead to β-catenin accumulation.
  See main text for further details.
