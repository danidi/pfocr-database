caption: Proposed mechanism for β2M mAb inhibition of AR and cell proliferation, survival,
  and progression through a MAPK/SREBP-1 signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells.
  β2M mAb inhibited p-MAPK and p-AKT expression and decreased SREBP-1 expression in
  LNCaP and C4-2B cells. By the addition of U0126, a MAPK selective inhibitor, we
  observed down-regulation of SREBP-1 expression (see B). In addition, β2M mAb inhibited
  AR and FAS expression; the latter is known to regulate fatty acid biosynthesis,
  cell membrane integrity, energy metabolism, and lipid raft-regulated cell signaling
  (, , ), which ultimately control prostate cancer cell proliferation, survival, and
  progression.
