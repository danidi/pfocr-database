caption: Possible signaling transduction pathways induced by TGL. Different doses
  of TGL could induce the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the down-regulation
  of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and the up-regulation of cytosolic free
  Ca2+ concentrations, accompanied by activation of the NF-κB pathway and overproduction
  of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β). N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger,
  could abrogate ROS production and subsequently inhibit mobilization of the NF-κB
  pathway and pro-inflammatory response.
