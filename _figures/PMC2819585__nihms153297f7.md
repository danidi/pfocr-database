caption: In qHSC miR132 exerts a translational block on MeCP2 transcript. Upon transdifferentiation
  mIR132 expression is down regulated enabling translation of MeCP2 protein and binding
  to the 5′ end of the PPARγ gene where it promotes H3K9 methylation and recruitment
  of the transcription repressor HP1α. Additionally, MeCP2 stimulates expression of
  EZH2 which methylates H3K27 to form a binding site for the polycomb repressor 1
  complex which promotes chromatin condensation in the 3′ PPARγ exons. The culmination
  of the pathway is transcriptional repression of the master anti-fibrogenic gene
  PPARγ.
