caption: Model of NGF/TrkA-mediated Rab5 inactivation and establishment of signaling
  endosomes. NGF binds TrkA and induces its endocytosis. TrkA-associated RabGAP5 inactivates
  Rab5 by promoting its GTP hydrolysis. As a result, the TrkA-containing endocytic
  vesicles cannot fuse with early endosomes and enter the endocytic pathway. This
  population of TrkA-containing endocytic vesicles is thus diverted from the conventional
  endocytic pathway and specializes to become the signaling endosomes.
