caption: 'Fatty acid synthesis pathways in C. elegans. (a) De novo synthesis of polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) begins with acetyl-CoA and utilizes acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC)
  and fatty acid synthase (FAS). Dietary fatty acids such as palmitic acid (16:0)
  can also enter the pathway and be converted to PUFAs by various desaturase and elongase
  activities. (b) Monomethyl branched-chain fatty acid synthesis uses a branched-chain
  primer as a substrate, FAS and specialized elongase activities to synthesize C15:iso
  and C17:iso, which are essential for growth. Fatty acid nomenclature: X:Yn-Z, fatty
  acid chain of X carbon atoms and Y methylene-interrupted cis double bonds; Z indicates
  the position of the terminal double bond relative to the methyl end of the molecule.
  Gene activities: FAT-1, omega-3 desaturase; FAT-2, Δ12 desaturase; FAT-3, Δ6 desaturase;
  FAT-4, Δ5 desaturase; FAT-5, Δ9 desaturase; FAT-6, Δ9 desaturase; FAT-7, Δ9 desaturase;
  ELO, fatty acid elongase; LET-767, 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase.'
