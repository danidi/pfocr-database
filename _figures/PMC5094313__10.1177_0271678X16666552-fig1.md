caption: 'Simplified diagram of cerebral intermediary metabolism with a focus on the
  glycolytic pathway and its relation to glycerol and glycerophospholipids and to
  the citric acid cycle. Glucose, lactate, and pyruvate are involved in major pathways
  of brain energy metabolism, and changes in their concentrations and lactate/pyruvate
  (Lac/Pyr) ratio can reflect disturbances in transport and metabolism, whereas increases
  in glutamate and glycerol levels reflect excitatory neurotoxicity and membrane damage,
  respectively. P: phosphate; α-KG: α-ketoglutarate; TCA: tricarboxylic acid. Underlined
  metabolites are analyzed during routine cerebral microdialysis assays and displayed
  at the bedside. Reference levels (means ± SD) of the various metabolites for normal
  human brain were obtained from Reinstrup et al. Modified from Nordström, Childs
  Nerv Syst 2010; 26:465–472, Copyright © 2009, Springer-Verlag, with permission.'
