caption: Schematic representation of the main strategies utilised to therapeutically
  inhibit the NF-κB signalling pathway. Depicted are the canonical (left) and non-canonical
  (right) pathways of NF-κB activation. Also depicted are the main therapeutic strategies
  utilised to inhibit these NF-κB signalling pathways in the oncological context.
