caption: CONSORT diagram of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
  cancer (mCRPC) treated with androgen receptor signalling inhibitors (ARSi). A total
  of 342 patients with mCRPC who underwent cell-free DNA profiling received ARSi (i.e.,
  abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide). Five patients were excluded from downstream
  analysis as they were positive for the microsatellite instability (MSI) or hypermutator
  genotype. VANC, Vancouver Prostate Centre cohort; CORE/PROBIO, Centre for Oncological
  Research and Prostate Biomarker cohort; PCI, pathway complexity index.
