caption: Alcohol-related receptors, channels, and their downstream pathways. (a) GABA
  receptors are classified as either ionotropic (GABAA/C) or metabotropic (GABAB).
  GABAA/C receptors are gated chloride-conducting ion channels whereas GABAB receptors
  activate Gi/o proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase and decrease cAMP. (b) Glutamate
  receptors are classified as either ionotropic (AMPA, Kainate, and NMDA) or metabotropic
  (mGluRs) receptors. AMPA, Kainate, and NMDA receptors are all gated sodium-conducting
  cation channels, however, NMDA receptors also conduct calcium. mGluR are classified
  as groups I and II. Group I mGluRs activate Gq proteins which activate the PLC signaling
  pathway, whereas group II mGluRs activate Gi/o proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase
  and decrease cAMP. (c) Dopamine receptors are classified as D1- or D2-family members,
  which are both metabotropic receptors. However, D1 receptors activate Gs proteins
  thereby increasing cAMP, whereas D2 receptors activate Gi proteins thereby decreasing
  cAMP. (d) 5-HT receptors are classified as either ionotropic (5-HT3) or metabotropic
  (5HT1, 5-HT4,6,7, and 5-HT2) cation-permeable channel. 5-HT3 receptors are gated
  sodium-conducting cation channels. 5-HT3 receptors are not present in Drosophila.
  5-HT metabotropic receptors activate either Gs, Gi, or Gq proteins to influence
  adenylyl cyclase and PLC signaling. (e) Calcium channels are gated by voltage. (f)
  Potassium channels are a diverse family that can be activated by Ca2+, voltage,
  the G βγ protein complex, and Na+. SLO2 is the fly homolog of the Na+ activated
  potassium channel, however it is not Na+ activated. Potassium channels also include
  two-pore domain K+ channels.

    (a) GABA receptors are classified as either ionotropic (GABAA/C) or metabotropic
    (GABAB). GABAA/C receptors are gated chloride-conducting ion channels whereas
    GABAB receptors activate Gi/o proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase and decrease

    Gq proteins which activate the PLC signaling pathway, whereas group II mGluRs
    activate Gi/o proteins which inhibit adenylyl cyclase and decrease cAMP. (c) Dopamine
    receptors are classified as D1- or D2-family members, which are both metabotropic
