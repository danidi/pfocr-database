caption: 'Rab proteins are heavily implicated in both FTD/ALS and PD, being shown
  to interact with several disease-associated proteins in a number of pathways that
  converge on the lysosome. (A) Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mediates lipid
  droplet formation via Rab8. (B) Compartmentalisation and trafficking of lysosomal
  enzymes and membrane proteins in the trans-Golgi to the lysosome is crucial for
  lysosome function and is modulated by LRRK2, TMEM230 and chromosome 9 open reading
  frame 72 (C9ORF72) via their interaction with Rab proteins. (C) Effective lysosome
  exocytosis during stress-induced lysosome overload is key to cell survival and has
  been shown to be mediated by LRRK2 and its substrates, Rab7L1, Rab10, and Rab8.
  (D) C9ORF72 has been shown to act as a guanine exchange factor (GEF) for several
  Rab proteins implicated in autophagosome formation. (E) Both PD and FTD/ALS-associated
  proteins have been shown to modulate different stages of the endolysosomal pathway
  via their interactions with Rabs, intersecting at both early endosomes (EE) and
  recycling endosomes (RE). Blue boxes, PD; green boxes, FTD/ALS. Abbreviation: APh,
  autophagosome.'
