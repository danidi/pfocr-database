caption: 'The honey bee genome encodes major members of insect immune pathways including:
  RNAi (RNA interference); Jak/STAT (Janus kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator
  of Transcription); Toll; NF-κB (Nuclear Factor κB); JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase);
  and MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases), as well as orthologs of genes involved
  in autophagy, eicosanoid biosynthesis, endocytosis, and melanization. Bold text
  indicates genes and proteins differentially expressed in virus-infected honey bees.
  Additional information including Apis mellifera (Am) gene accession numbers is provided
  in  and . The first step in immune activation is host recognition of pathogen associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) including viral dsRNA, bacterial peptidoglycans, and
  fungal β-glucans. In general, the Toll pathway is involved in defense against Gram(+)
  bacteria and fungi and the Imd pathway is activated by Gram(−) bacteria, but specific
  host-pathogen interactions are unique. This is particularly true for host – virus
  interactions since data from fruit-flies, mosquitoes, and honey bees indicate differential
  activation of immune genes and pathways. The Jak/STAT pathway is activated via ligand
  binding to the Domeless receptor; while Drosophila melanogaster (Dm) express Domeless
  ligands (unpaired, upd, upd2, and upd3), a honey bee upd ortholog has not been identified.
  Following Domeless-ligand binding, Hopscotch Janus kinases are transphosphorylated,
  leading to phosphorylation and dimerization of STAT92E-like proteins. Activated
  STATs transcriptionally regulate antimicrobial effectors TEP7 (Thioester-containing
  protein 7), TEPA, TEPB, and the Jak/STAT inhibitor SOCS (Suppressor of Cytokine
  Signaling). The honey bee genome also encodes for D-PIAS (Protein Inhibitor of Activated
  STAT), another inhibitor of the Jak/STAT pathway. The RNAi-pathway is initiated
  by Dm Dicer-2 cleavage of viral dsRNA into 21–22 bp siRNAs; Am Dicer-like share
  ~30% aa identity with Dm Dicer-2. The siRNAs are then loaded into AGO2 (Argonaute-2),
  the catalytic component of the RISC (RNA Induced Silencing Complex). A single strand
  of the siRNA is retained in the RISC and used to specifically target cognate viral
  genome sequences for cleavage. In addition, Dm Dicer-2 serves as a dsRNA sensor
  that mediates a signal transduction cascade resulting in increased expression of
  Dm Vago and suppression of viral replication. Am Dicer-like may serve as a dsRNA
  sensor, and honey bees have a vago ortholog (), but the mechanism(s) of honey bee
  non-specific dsRNA-mediated antiviral responses require additional characterization.
  The Toll pathway is activated by a family of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs)
  (e.g., peptidoglycan receptor proteins and Gram(−) binding proteins) that bind fungal
  and bacterial PAMPs. The Toll pathway is activated in some insect host-virus combinations,
  although the activation mechanism is unknown. Following PAMP binding, a serine protease
  cascade results in cleavage of pro-Spaetzle into mature Spaetzle. The honey bee
  genome encodes two putative spaetzle orthologs, which bind the membrane-anchored
  Toll receptor. Toll dimerization results in the recruitment of dMyD88, Tube, and
  Pelle. Pelle is likely involved in degradation of NF-κB inhibitors (e.g., Cactus-1,
  Cactus-2, Cactus-3), resulting in the release of transcription factors Dorsal-1A
  and Dorsal-1B. Nuclear translocation of Dorsal results in increased expression of
  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The Imd pathway is activated by Peptidoglycan recognition
  protein LC (PGRP-LC) binding to diaminopimelic-containing peptidoglycan of Gram(−)
  bacteria, followed by activation of the adaptor protein Immune deficiency (IMD),
  Relish phosphorylation by the IKK complex (IkB kinase), and cleavage of Relish by
  the caspase Dredd (Death-related ced-3/Nedd2-like). Relish transcriptionally regulates
  expression of AMPs and other genes involved in antimicrobial defense. The JNK pathway
  is also activated by TAB (Transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1) and TAK1
  (Transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1 binding protein), resulting in AMP
  expression and/or apoptosis. In Drosophila, binding of vesicular stomatitis virus
  to the Toll-7 receptor promotes autophagy, likely by inhibiting the PI3/Akt/Tor
  (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Protein kinase B/Target of rapamycin) pathway which
  suppresses autophagy. The honey bee genome encodes for one gene of the Toll-7/2
  clade, 18-wheeler (am18w), which shares ~49% aa identity with Dm Toll-7 and ~45%
  aa identity with Dm Toll-2. The role of Am18w protein in antiviral defense and autophagy
  in honey bees is unknown. In insects, Eicosanoid biosynthesis begins with the induction
  of PLA2 (Phospholipase 2) from signal cascades downstream of viral, fungal, or bacterial
  PAMP recognition. Activated PLA2 hydrolyzes arachidonic acid (AA) from cellular
  phospholipids. Eicosonoid production likely occurs via oxidation of AA by an unidentified
  enzyme. Eicosanoids are critical for nodulation and aid in phagocytosis, micro-aggregation,
  adhesion, and release of prophenoloxidase (PPO) from hemocytes. Experimental evidence
  also suggests endocytosis, melanization, and MAPK pathways are involved in honey
  bee antiviral defense.'
