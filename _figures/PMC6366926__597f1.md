caption: Representation of the engineered mating pathway. Rhodopsin activation was
  functionally coupled to the expression of a fluorescent reporter protein, mCherry,
  utilizing the mating-responsive promoter pFUS1. Modifications to the mating pathway
  included the knockout of negative regulator Sst2, the gene encoding Far1, which
  halts cell growth in the wild-type mating pathway, and the endogenous mating pathway
  GPCR Ste2. The chimeric G alpha protein (Gpa1-Gαt) contains the five C-terminal
  amino acids of the G alpha subunit of human transducin (Gαt).
