caption: Fermentative hydrogen production from glucose by E. coli, a well‐studied
  facultative anaerobic bacterium. Hydrogen is produced through the action of the
  FHL complex. The maximum theoretical hydrogen yield is 2 mol of H2 per mole of glucose.
  The glucose metabolic pathway yields succinate, lactate, acetate, ethanol and formate,
  as fermentation end‐products. The proteins shown in bold with an asterisk have been
  studied through metabolic engineering in order to enhance the biohydrogen production.
  PFL, pyruvate formate lyase; FDH, formate dehydrogenase; FHL, formate hydrogen lyase;
  Hyd, hydrogenase; CoA, coenzyme A.
