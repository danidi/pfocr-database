caption: Reconstructed and redesigned B. linens carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in
  the heterologous host E. coli. Carotenogenic enzymes of B. linens, P. ananatis,
  and R. capsulatus, which were used for the biosynthetic pathway reconstruction,
  are indicated by boldface letters. Idi (IPP isomerase), IspA (FPP synthase), CrtE
  (GGPP synthase), CrtB (phytoene synthase), CrtI (phytoene desaturase), CrtYcYd (lycopene
  cyclase), CrtU (β-carotene desaturase), CrtZ (β-carotene hydrolase), CrtY2 (mutant
  lycopene cyclase), and CrtA (spheroidene monooxygenase). B. linens 3,3′-dihydroxyisorenieratene
  biosynthesis is indicated by dashed arrows.
