caption: 'Gene-gene interaction among genes associated with atypical antipsychotic-induced
  lipid disturbances. The central and peripheral pathways are separated by brain-blood
  barrier, with leptin through it. Neuropeptide Y (NPY)/agouti-related protein (AgRP)
  neurons and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons play a fundamental role in the downstream
  of the pathway of LEP, CNR1, and HTR2C. NPY is an orexigenic mediator whereas melanocortin-4
  receptor (MC4R) exert anorexigenic effects. HTR2C mediates the effects of multiple
  genes, such as LEP, CNR1, and BDNF. Dopamine regulate appetite mainly through brain
  reward circuits. As a bridge between the central and peripheral ways, leptin inhibits
  food intake by triggering multiple signaling cascades like NPY, MC4R, CNR1. In peripheral
  tissues, multiple hormones or peptides modulating lipid metabolism, such as leptin,
  neuropeptide Y, melanocortin, endocannabinoids, insulin, and norepinephrine etc.
  Inhibition of lipolysis and stimulation of lipogenesis lead to hyperlipemia and
  obesity. The solid and dotted lines indicate upregulation and downregulation respectively.
  ↑: activated by AAPDs; ↓: inhibited by AAPDs; yellow arrows indicate compensatory
  effects rather than direct effects; NE, norepinephrine.'
