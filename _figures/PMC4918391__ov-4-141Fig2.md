caption: 'Schematic representation of HVJ-E-mediated cancer cell death.Notes: (A)
  HVJ-E-mediated apoptosis signaling in cancer cells with CASP8. RNA fragments, which
  are introduced by HVJ-E membrane fusion, are recognized by RIG-I, and the signaling
  induces the transcription of TRAIL and Noxa by the activation of IRF7 and IRF3 via
  the RIG-I/MAVS pathway. TRAIL activates CASP8 via TRAIL receptor binding, and Noxa
  activates CASP9 via Cyt-C release from mitochondria. Activation of CASP8 and CASP9
  results in cancer cell apoptosis via the subsequent activation of CASP3. (B) HVJ-E-mediated
  necroptosis signaling in cancer cells without CASP8. HVJ-E membrane fusion elevates
  the cytoplasmic Ca2+ level, and Ca2+ induces the phosphorylation of CaMK II. CaMK-II-P
  phosphorylates RIP1, and RIP1-P induces cancer cell necroptosis by elevating the
  levels of intracellular ROS.Abbreviations: CaMK-II-P, phosphorylated CaMK II; CASP,
  caspase; Cyt-C, cytochrome-C; HVJ-E, ultraviolet-irradiated hemagglutinating virus
  of Japan; RIP1-P, phosphorylated RIP1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TRIAL, TNF-related
  apoptosis-inducing ligand.'
