caption: Model for the role of Hsl1 and Hsl7 in linking septin ring assembly to activation
  of Cdc28-Clb complexes. See Discussion for details. The catalytic domain (KIN),
  Hsl7-binding domain (HDB), and postulated septin-binding domain (SBD) of Hsl1 are
  indicated.

papertitle: Hsl7 Localizes to a Septin Ring and Serves as an Adapter in a Regulatory
  Pathway That Relieves Tyrosine Phosphorylation  of Cdc28 Protein Kinase in Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae.
