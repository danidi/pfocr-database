caption: Schematical overview of the signaling pathway mediated by MC1R. MC1R resides
  at the plasma membrane of melanocytes and is activated by melanocortins, in particular
  α-MSH, and inactivated by Agouti protein. To be fully effective, Agouti also needs
  Attractin, which helps Agouti binding to the receptor, and Mahogunin, which acts
  at the cytosolic side of the plasma membrane, most likely by competing with Gs for
  receptor binding. In addition, MC1R has a neutral agonist, β-Defensin, which interferes
  with both agonist and antagonist binding, thereby highlighting the high degree of
  constitutive activity of the receptor. The canonical pathway activated by MC1R leads
  to cAMP increase via Gs and adenylyl cyclase, and proceeds with CREB phosphorylation
  by PKA and transcription of downstream targets, in particular MITF. Increased MITF
  activity is further reinforced and regulated by cAMP-independent ERK activation,
  probably resulting from cross-talk between MC1R and the cKIT receptor. MITF binds
  to promoters and stimulates transcription of genes coding for melanosomal proteins
  implicated in the eumelanogenesis pathway, thus inducing a switch from pheomelanin
  to eumelain synthesis and increasing melanosome number, size and transport. MC1R
  signaling also reduces the generation of reactive oxygen species and enhances DNA
  repair mechanisms by still poorly understood mechanisms (not shown). PM, plasma
  membrane.
