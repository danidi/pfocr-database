caption: PHS metabolic pathway. PHS is metabolized to either complex sphingolipids
  as an LCB component or to glycerolipids as a FA component via the PHS degradation
  pathway. In the degradation pathway, PHS is phosphorylated to PHS 1-phosphate by
  the SPH kinase SPHK2, cleaved to 2-OH C16:0-CHO by the SPH 1-phosphate lyase SPGL1,
  oxidized to 2-OH C16:0-COOH by the FALDH ALDH3A2, and converted to 2-OH C16:0-CoA
  by ACSs. Most of the generated 2-OH C16:0-CoAs are subjected to C1 removal by 2-OH
  acyl-CoA lyases (mainly by HACL2 and partly by HACL1), producing C15:0-CHO. Some
  2-OH C16:0-CoAs are incorporated into sphingolipids as a FA moiety. C15:0-CHO is
  oxidized to C15:0-COOH by the FALDH ALDH3A2, converted to C15:0-CoA by ACSs, and
  incorporated into glycerolipids.
