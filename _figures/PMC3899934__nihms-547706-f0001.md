caption: Bile acids, the endogenous ligands for FXR, are end products of cholesterol
  catabolism. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the
  neutral pathway of bile acid synthesis, which converts cholesterol to CDCA. Sterol
  12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) converts CDCA to CA. 6-ECDCA is modified from CDCA and
  is a synthetic FXR agonist. CDCA, CA and 6-ECDCA are steroidal FXR ligands. Nonsteroidal
  FXR ligands include GW4064, fexaramine and WAY-362450 (XL335). Endogenous FXR ligands
  and synthetic FXR ligands are indicated in red and blue, respectively.
