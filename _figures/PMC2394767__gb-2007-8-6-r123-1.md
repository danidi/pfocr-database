caption: 'Construction of elementary mode collections. (a) This scheme represents
  some of the elementary modes calculated between fumarate and 2-oxoglutarate in the
  citrate cycle pathway. Each color corresponds to a different elementary mode; numbers
  indicate the identifiers of elementary modes as in Additional data file 1, and doors
  represent start and end compounds of elementary modes. This figure illustrates the
  combinatorial nature of elementary modes: several of them are almost identical except
  for one or two reactions, and a given reaction can belong to several elementary
  modes. (b) The composition of the EM1 collection (left) and how elementary modes
  were merged to build the EM2 collection (right). Three independent sets from EM1
  can be merged into two sets in EM2 if they share a common boundary compound.'
