caption: BCAAs (i.e, Val, valine; Ile, isoleucine; Leu, leucine) are transported by
  LATs into the cell and reversibly metabolized by branched-chain amino acid transaminases
  (BCATs), followed by irreversible decarboxylation of branched-chain α-keto acids
  (BCKAs, i.e, KMV, α-keto-β-methylvalerate; KIV, α-ketoisovalerate; KIC, α-ketoisocaproate)
  by the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. The activity of
  the BCKDH complex is determined by its phosphorylation status modulated by a pair
  of enzymes, branched-chain keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) and Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent
  1K protein phosphatase (PPM1K). Along the BCAA metabolic pathway, BCAAs (especially
  Leu), α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), glutamate (Glu), BCKDK, BCKDH, and PPM1K have been
  demonstrated to play significant roles in cancer progression via various mechanisms,
  which are highlighted in the colored boxes. The end products of BCAA catabolism,
  acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and succinyl-CoA, were shown to contribute to 1-3%
  of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, but their roles in cancers
  remain to be investigated. EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition; mTORC1, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin complex 1; TET, ten-eleven translocation; GSH, glutathione;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
