caption: Schematic of PDGF-mediated corneal wound healing. PDGF secreted at the site
  of the corneal wound induces its receptors on the corneal fibroblast that induces
  JAK2 followed by STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. STAT3 induces
  the transcription of genes involved in cell growth, migration, and IL8 chemokine
  secretion resulting in the initiation of corneal wound healing. SOCS3 serves as
  an endogenous regulator of JAK2-STAT3 inhibition as seen with the chemical inhibitor,
  AG-490, in vitro.
