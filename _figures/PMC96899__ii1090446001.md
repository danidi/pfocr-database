caption: 'Representation of the structure of meningococcal LPS oligosaccharides of
  immunotypes L1 to L9. Immunotypes are indicated to the extreme left. The vertical
  line marks the junction between the inner core structures to the right and outer
  core structures to the left. The epitope recognized by MAb B5 is indicated in boldface
  (MAb B5 positive). Arabic numerals indicate the linkage between sugars or amino
  sugars. Alpha and beta indicate the carbon 1 linkage at the nonreducing end of the
  sugar. Genes for incorporating each of the key sugars or amino sugars into the LPS
  oligosaccharide in the biosynthetic pathway are indicated with arrows indicating
  where in the pathway the gene product is required. Abbreviations: Kdo, 2-keto-2-deoxyoctulosonic
  acid; Gal, galactose: GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Glu, glucose; Hep, heptose. Immunotype
  L5 has no PEtn on the second heptose. The gene that adds the glucose to the second
  heptose (lgtG) is phase variable.'
