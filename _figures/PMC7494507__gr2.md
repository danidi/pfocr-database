caption: The regulatory mechanisms of CD47 expression.Regulators of CD47 expression
  in cancer cells includes cytokines, oncogenes, microRNAs as well as enzymes. IL-6
  induces the expression of CD47 through activating STAT3 signaling pathway. Both
  TNF-α and IL-1β stimulate the expression of CD47 at the transcriptional level, which
  are mediated by the activation of NF-κB pathway and the increased binding of NF-κB
  to the CD47 promoter. IFN-γ increased the expression of CD47 and the specific mechanism
  need to be further confirmed. HIF-1, which is induced by hypoxia conditions, directly
  binds to CD47 promoter to increase the transcriptional expression of CD47. MYC directly
  binds to the CD47 promoter to transcriptionally up-regulate the expression of CD47.
  miR-708, miR-192, miR-222, miR-133a, miR-155 miR-200a and miR-340 suppress CD47
  expression by directly targeting the 3′-UTR of CD47 mRNA. QPCTL modifies the N-terminal
  pyroglutamate formation of CD47 protein at the post-translational modification level,
  thereby influencing the binding of CD47-SIRPα. The solid arrows indicated that identified
  mechanism and dashed arrows indicated that inferred mechanism.
