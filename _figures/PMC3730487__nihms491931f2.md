caption: The two mechanisms of phase II xenobiotic-metabolizing enzyme induction by
  phase II inducers. In the AhR–XRE signaling pathway, chemopreventive inducers bind
  to the AhR and facilitate the dissociation of HSP90 from this complex and the transloction
  of the receptor and ligand into the nucleus. Once translocated, AhR complexes with
  the transcription factor Arnt, binds to XRE and enhances trans cription of both
  phase I and phase II genes at the same time it induces Nrf2 expression. In the Nrf2–ARE
  signaling pathway, chemopreventive inducers are thought to modify the cystein-rich
  sensor protein Keap1, in such a way that it releases the transcription factor Nrf2,
  which is then free to translocate into the nucleus. Additionally, Nrf1 is translocated
  from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the nucleus in response to ER stress, through
  the functional contribution of Nrf1 to the ER stress response has not been well
  described. Finally, Nrf1 and/or Nrf2 heterodimerize with Maf and other transcription
  factors and bind as a complex to the ARE, leading to enhanced expression of phase
  II genes.
