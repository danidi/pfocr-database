caption: Mechanism of neuroprotective effects of genistein against neuropathological
  insults of Alzheimer’s disease. In the amyloidogenic pathway, cleavages of APP by
  β- and γ-secretases lead to the genesis of Aβ peptides and in the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway, cleavages of APP by α- and γ-secretases causes the formation of p3 and
  AICD. Genistein by activating PKC signaling pathway enhances the non-amyloidogenic
  pathway of APP cleavage by increasing α-secretase activity and in the amyloidogenic
  pathway genistein block the formation of Aβ peptides by reducing γ-secretase. Genistein
  also reduces tau pathology by blocking intracellular calcium levels as well as inhibit
  oxidative stress-mediated neuronal death by inhibiting the ROS release from the
  mitochondria as well as promote autophagic clearance of aggregate-prone proteins.
  APP, amyloid precursor protein; sAPP, soluble APP; CTF, C-terminal fragment; AICD,
  APP intracellular domain; ROS, reactive oxygen species.
