caption: The interactive pathways of stress-responsive miRNAs and their targets. The
  cold-stressed microRNAs include information summarized from Xin et al (chartreuse
  oval) and this study (forest green oval). The forest green link indicated the unique
  regulation between the miRNAs and targets in response to cold stress only in our
  study, and the dark blue link indicated the target genes involved in the flower
  development pathway
