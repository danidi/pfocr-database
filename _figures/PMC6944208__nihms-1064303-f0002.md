caption: a) A biosynthetic schematic. Steps in blue are derived from the analog studies
  presented herein. A protease, to convert the peptide-bound cross-linked Glu and
  Tyr to the substrate of PqqB, is inferred from the present study but not yet characterized.
  b) Structures of the PqqB substrate analog Cys-Tyr and catalytic intermediate analog
  Cys-DOPA.
