caption: 'The working model shows that under normal oxygen tension GNAQ/GNA11 mutations,
  present in the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (GPCR: G protein-coupled
  receptors) in the majority of primary uveal melanomas, are responsible for the activation
  of MAPK pathway under normoxic conditions. MAPK pathway in turn activates mTOR signaling,
  known to regulate HIF-1α protein translation and tumor growth. In hypoxic conditions,
  HIF-1α protein levels are further induced by the inhibition of its oxygen-dependent
  degradation. Such induction leads to Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD1) stabilization
  and Notch activation. The induction of P-Erk and P-Akt, mediated by a non-canonical
  Notch signaling, contributes in promoting invasion and metastasis.'
