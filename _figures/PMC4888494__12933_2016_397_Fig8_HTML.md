caption: Effects of high glucose on inflamed human vascular smooth muscle cells. (a
  and b) Under low or high extracellular glucose and in the absence of cytokine activation,
  the cell regulates the entry of glucose. (c) However, activation with IL1β augments
  GLUT-dependent glucose uptake ①, enhances PPP activity ② and GSH levels ③, and activates
  NADPH oxidase ④ and pro-inflammatory signalling ⑤. (d) When the cytokine activation
  coexists with high concentrations of extracellular glucose, the increased glucose
  entering the cell ① is partially diverted through an over-stimulated PPP ②, resulting
  in a pro-oxidant environment ③ that cannot be counterbalanced by a reduced regeneration
  of GSH ④, leading to enhanced inflammation and ultimately to tissue damage ⑤
