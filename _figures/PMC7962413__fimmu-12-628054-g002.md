caption: 'Tick signaling-related genes in the three main immune signaling pathways
  of arthropods: (A) Toll, (B) IMD, and (C) JAK/STAT. (A) A previous in silico study
  () showed that components of the Toll signaling pathway of arthropods are conserved
  in ticks: extracellular cytokine Spatzle (Spz), transmembrane cytokine receptor
  Toll, Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP), adaptor protein MyD88, kinases Tube (interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase 4 or IRAK4), Pelle (interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1 or IRAK1), Pelle-interacting protein Pellino, TNF receptor associated factors
  (TRAFs), evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in toll pathway (ECSIT),
  sterile alpha- and armadillo-motif-containing protein (SARM), Rel/NF-kappa B transcription
  factor Dorsal, Dorsal inhibitor protein IkappaB Cactus (IkB), and interacting protein
  Cactin of the IkB. (B) Regarding the IMD pathway, genes encoding downstream members
  of both the NF-kB/Relish and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) branches were identified:
  peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), enzymes involved in ubiquitination (UEV1a,
  Effete/Ubc13 and Bendless/Ubc5), X-linked inhibitor apoptosis protein (XIAP), negative
  regulators Caspar (Fas-associating factor 1) and POSH (E3 ligase Plenty of SH3),
  transforming growth factor-beta activated kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK1-binding protein
  2 (TAB2), IRD5 and Kenny/NEMO (IKKγ), and Relish-like Rel/NF-kB transcription factor.
  The adaptor protein IMD (immune deficiency), its associated molecule FAAD (Fas associated
  protein with death domain), the caspase DREDD (death related ced-3/Nedd2-like) and
  Dnr1 (defense repressor 1) have not yet been described in ticks. Components of the
  JNK branch of the tick IMD pathway include mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase
  hemipterous (HEP), Jun-kinase basket (BSK), activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription
  factors JRA (Jun-related antigen) and KAY (Fos-related antigen, Kayak). Some IMD
  pathway components were functionally characterized by () (Insert). The authors showed
  that the IMD pathway is activated by PODAG (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl diacylglycerol)
  or POPG (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol). Once activated, XIAP
  interacts with the heterodimer Bendless : UEV1a, leading to the ubiquitination of
  p47 in a K63-dependent manner. Ubiquitylated p47 connects to Kenny (also named NEMO)
  and induces the phosphorylation of IRD5 and Relish. (C) Components of the Janus
  kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway
  are also conserved in ticks: the transmembrane cytokine receptor Domeless, tyrosine
  kinase JAK (Hopscotch), transcription factor STAT, signal transducing adaptor molecule
  (STAM) and the inhibitor proteins PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) and
  SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling). The ligand of the Domeless receptor (UPD
  gene) was not identified in ticks (C). Activated transcription factors are represented
  in dark blue; the immune signaling pathway components not yet described in ticks
  are represented in green.'
