caption: Macrophage infiltration in adipose tissues, oxidative stress and IR. Circulating
  monocytes adhere to activated endothelial cells. Activated CD8+ T cells and chemokines
  induce monocyte migration into adipose tissues where they differentiate into macrophages.
  Interaction of saturated fatty acids with TLRs leads to secretion of inflammatory
  cytokines/chemokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). Together with the adipocytokines leptin and
  resistin, they impair c-jun N-terminal kinase and NF-κB signalling, resulting in
  IR and reduced adiponectin (Acrp-30) secretion, and thereby loss of adipocyte maturation.
  Together they also induce adipocyte proliferation. Infiltration of inflammatory
  cells is associated with ROS and ox-LDL production, endothelial cell apoptosis,
  impaired LXR and VEGF signalling, and decreased blood flow leading to hypoxia and
  increased oxidative stress. Ox-LDL can further induce adipose tissue hyperplasia,
  and by inducing lipoprotein lipase it enhances lipid accumulation resulting in adipose
  tissue hypertrophy. The latter is also facilitated by MMPs secreted by macrophages.
  Hypoxia and increased oxidative stress induces apoptosis of adipocytes. Increased
  apoptosis also results from reduced Acrp-30 secretion and growth arrest specific
  6 mediated survival pathway. Apoptotic adipocytes attract macrophages which normally
  remove apoptotic adipocytes. However, ox-LDL impairs phagocytosis of dead adipocytes
  by inhibiting resolvin E1 and protectin D1 production.

  description: Macrophage infiltration in adipose tissues, oxidative stress and IR.
    Circulating monocytes adhere to activated endothelial cells. Activated CD8+ T
    cells and chemokines induce monocyte migration into adipose tissues where they
    differentiate into macrophages. Interaction of saturated fatty acids with TLRs
    leads to secretion of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). Together
    with the adipocytokines leptin and resistin, they impair c-jun N-terminal kinase
    and NF-κB signalling, resulting in IR and reduced adiponectin (Acrp-30) secretion,
    and thereby loss of adipocyte maturation. Together they also induce adipocyte
    proliferation. Infiltration of inflammatory cells is associated with ROS and ox-LDL
    production, endothelial cell apoptosis, impaired LXR and VEGF signalling, and
    decreased blood flow leading to hypoxia and increased oxidative stress. Ox-LDL
    can further induce adipose tissue hyperplasia, and by inducing lipoprotein lipase
    it enhances lipid accumulation resulting in adipose tissue hypertrophy. The latter
    is also facilitated by MMPs secreted by macrophages. Hypoxia and increased oxidative
    stress induces apoptosis of adipocytes. Increased apoptosis also results from
    reduced Acrp-30 secretion and growth arrest specific 6 mediated survival pathway.
    Apoptotic adipocytes attract macrophages which normally remove apoptotic adipocytes.
    However, ox-LDL impairs phagocytosis of dead adipocytes by inhibiting resolvin
    E1 and protectin D1 production.
