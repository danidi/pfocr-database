caption: Molecular mechanisms involved in inflammasome activation. Activation of the
  canonical inflammasomes usually requires two steps. As the first priming step, PAMPs
  or DAMPs combine with TLRs on the plasma membrane to trigger NF-ĸB-dependent transcription
  of inflammasome components and their downstream targets, including NLRP3, pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18. The second step involves the recognition of PAMPs or DAMPs by the
  inflammasome sensors AIM2, pyrin, NLRC4, NLRP1 and NLRP3. These sensors recruit
  the adaptor protein ASC and procaspase-1 to form diverse inflammasomes. Once assembled,
  the inflammasomes act as activating platforms for procaspase-1. Catalytically active
  caspase-1 converts the inactive pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their biologically
  active forms (IL-1β and IL-18). On the other hand, caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD to release
  an N-terminal pore-forming domain (GSDMD-NT), which migrates toward the plasma membrane
  and forms membrane pores. The pores facilitate the release of the active IL-1β and
  IL-18 into the extracellular environment. In addition, caspase-1 activation leads
  to the cleavage of chromosomal DNA by nuclease activity. The non-canonical inflammasome
  pathway is specifically activated by Gram-negative bacteria. IFN-γ-induced GBP causes
  the lysis of Gram-negative bacteria-containing vacuoles, allowing the release of
  LPS into the cytoplasm. Intracellular bacterial LPS can directly activate caspase-4
  and -5 in humans and caspase-11 in mice. These caspases cleave GSDMD to drive pyroptotic
  cell death. GSDMD-NT activates the NLRP3 inflammasome to promote caspase-1-dependent
  cytokine maturation. TLR, toll-like receptor; PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular
