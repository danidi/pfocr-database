caption: The mTORC1-SREBP-NRF1-Proteasome pathway. Growth factors and nutrients activate
  mTORC1, which promotes an increase in cellular protein synthesis. mTORC1 also stimulates
  activation of the SREBP1 transcription factor by promoting its processing and nuclear
  accumulation, which requires its trafficking to the Golgi, where it is proteolytically
  cleaved by 2 proteases, resulting in release of the N-terminus encompassing the
  mature active transcription factor. Mature SREBP1 binds to SRE sequences in the
  promoters of genes, including the enzymes of de novo lipid synthesis and NFE2L1,
  encoding the NRF1 transcription factor. NRF1 is synthesized as an ER transmembrane
  protein and must be processed to release the active transcription factor. Proteasome
  inhibitors stimulate this processing, but the nature of the physiological signal
  is currently unknown. Once activated, NRF1 goes to the nucleus and turns on a subset
  of genes containing AREs in their promoter, including those encoding all, or nearly
  all, subunits of the proteasome, leading to an increase in cellular proteasome content.
