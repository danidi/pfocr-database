caption: DNA end resection is required for repair of complex DSBs. Low LET irradiation
  generates simple DSBs, which are repaired by NHEJ in G1 and by NHEJ or HR in S/G2.
  High LET irradiation generates complex DSBs. Complex DSBs are resected in all cell
  cycle phases by Exo1/CtIP/Mre11 to generate stretches of ssDNA that are bound by
  RPA. It is still unknown which DSB repair pathway repairs complex DSBs in G1.
