caption: Overview of autophagy process and regulation of ATG proteins by PTMs. Autophagy
  is a lysosomal degradation pathway that sequesters and engulfs cytoplasmic targets.
  The induction of autophagy is initiated by ULK complex which contains ULK1/2, autophagy-related
  (ATG) 13, focal adhesion kinase family interacting protein of 200 kDa (FIP200),
  and ATG101. The PI3KIII complex containing Beclin1, ATG14L, vacuolar protein sorting
  (VPS) 34, and vacuolar protein sorting 15 (VPS15) is activated by ULK1 initiates
  formation of phagophore. Two ubiquitin-like (Ubl) conjugation systems (Atg12 conjugation
  system and LC3 lipidation system) mediate the elongation and closure of the autophagosome.
  The maturation of the autophagosome and the fusion with the lysosome are mediated
  by the PI3KIII complex containing Beclin1, UV radiation resistance-associated gene
  product (UVRAG), vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) 34, and vacuolar protein sorting
  15 (VPS15). Autophagy receptor, such as p62, specifically recognizes ubiquitinated
  substrates and binds to LC3-PE. In mitophagy, PINK1 is stabilized on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane and activated by autophosphorylation, triggering Parkin recruitment and
  activation. Then mitochondrial surface proteins, such as voltage-dependent anion-selective
  channel protein 1 (VDAC1) and mitofusins (MFN1/2) are ubiquitinated by Parkin, modulating
  mitochondrial dynamics. The PTMs including phosphorylation (P), acetylation (Ac),
  ubiquitination (Ub) and sumoylation (SUMO) are shown on ATG proteins. PTMs that
  positively regulate the autophagy process are in green, and those that negatively
  regulate the autophagy process are in red.
