caption: Involvement of mitochondrial iPLA2γ in antioxidant protection and amplification
  of FA-induced insulin release. (A) Antioxidant mechanism based on UCP2 and iPLA2γ
  synergy that is also protective against lipotoxicity in pancreatic β-cells. Acute
  lipotoxicity leads to FA β-oxidation in mitochondria. Not only the higher substrate
  load for the respiratory chain (Complexes I, III, IV) contributes to higher superoxide
  release, but also the electron-transferring flavoprotein:ubiquinone oxido-reductase
  produces superoxide on β-oxidation (). Superoxide can be transformed to H2O2 by
  superoxide dismutases, SOD2/MnSOD in the matrix, or SOD1/CuZnSOD in the mitochondrial
  intermembrane space and in the cytosol. Subsequently, H2O2 activates iPLA2γ, which
  cleaves both saturated and unsaturated FAs off IMM phospholipids. Only these nascent
  FAs induce UCP2-mediated mild uncoupling, which inherently suppresses respiratory
  chain superoxide formation. Thus, iPLA2γ can be also activated by external oxidative
  stress as well as by redox signaling pathways, elevating H2O2 levels in its vicinity.
  CaL, L-type Ca2+ channel; KATP, ATP–sensitive K+ channel; O2•−, superoxide; Rcarn,
  acylcarnitine; RCoA, acyl-CoA. (B) Involvement of iPLA2γ in amplification of FA-induced
  GPR40 pathway of insulin secretion. After activation of iPLA2γ by H2O2 generated
  due to β-oxidation of incoming palmitic acid, FAs released from mitochondrial membranes
  provide feedback amplification of GPR40 response, leading to insulin surplus secretion.
  Lysophospholipids may also be cleaved by specific mitochondrial phospholipase D
  (mtPLD) (). Phosphatidic acid (PhosA) released from normal phospholipids by mtPLD
  might be further processed by phosphatidic acid preferring PLA1 (PAPLA1). All mentioned
  lipid metabolites are involved in the glycerol lipid/FA cycle signaling stimulating
  insulin secretion ().
