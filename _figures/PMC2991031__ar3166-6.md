caption: PE inhibits IL-1β-induced signaling cascade in human OA chondrocytes. The
  MAPKs are a group of signaling molecules that include the p38-MAPKs which are activated
  by upstream MAPK kinases MKK3 and MKK6. In human OA chondrocytes, IL-1β through
  IL-1R activates preferentially MKK3 which leads to the activation of p38-MAPK →
  RUNX2 pathway. Polyphenols rich PE inhibited the IL-1β-induced activation of MKK#
  and p38-MAPK in human OA chondrocytes. Breaking lines indicate reduced phosphorylation.
  IL-1R, IL-1β receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKK, MAPK kinases;
  MMPs, matrix metalloproteinases; p, phosphorylation; PE, pomegranate extract; RUNX2,
  runt-related transcription factor-2.
