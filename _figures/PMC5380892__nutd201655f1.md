caption: Mechanism of the link between insulin resistance, T2D and cancers. Amino
  acids metabolism in the liver via the gluconeogenic pathway increases glucose levels,
  which promotes insulin secretion from the pancreas. IGF-1 and insulin activate mTORC1
  and S6K1. Persistent activation leads to serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and IRS-2.
  The resulting insulin resistance increases demand on insulin to dispose of excess
  glucose. Long-term demand may negatively affect the function of islets, resulting
  in an inadequate insulin response and leading to the onset of T2D. On the other
  hand, some insulin resistant individuals who are able to maintain the degree of
  hyperinsulinemia needed to maintain normal (or near-normal) glucose tolerance are
  at increased risk of cancers. IGF-1, Insulin-like growth factor 1; IRS, insulin
  receptor substrate; mTORC1, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; S6K1, ribosomal
  protein S6 kinase β1; T2D, type 2 diabetes.
