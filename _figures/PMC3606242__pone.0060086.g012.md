caption: Dectin-1 is activated by complex β-glucan containing particles that induce
  clustering of dectin-1 at the membrane and formation of a phagocytic synapse. This
  leads to Syk recruitment to the ITAM like sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of
  dectin-1. Syk then mediates the activation of downstream signaling including the
  ERK1/2 and p38α MAPK cascades. Both ERK1/2 and p38α phosphorylate and activate the
  protein kinases MSK1 and 2. These in turn phosphorylate CREB on the IL-10 gene promoter,
  which stimulates IL-10 mRNA transcription. In addition, ERK1/2 also activate a MSK
  and p38 independent pathway that inhibits IL-10 mRNA transcription. The identity
  of this pathway is not clear. In addition to the ERK1/2 and p38α pathways shown
  dectin-1 also activates NFκB that likely also plays a role in inducing IL-10 transcription.
