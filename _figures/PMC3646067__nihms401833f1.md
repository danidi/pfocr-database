caption: Proposed scheme linking metabolic and signaling pathways to insulin resistance
  in the heart. Enhanced supply of fatty acids results in enhanced fatty acid uptake
  into the heart, which in turn, leads to an increase in mitochondrial uptake of long
  chain fatty acyl CoA . β-oxidation of long chain acyl CoA in the heart is increased
  in insulin resistance, and may exceed the capacity of the TCA cycle and the electron
  transport chain to utilize β-oxidation products, leading to increased oxidative
  stress and ROS production. A mismatch between β-oxidation and the TCA cycle and
  electron transport chain leads to a buildup of products of incomplete β-oxidation.
  ROS and products of incomplete oxidation impact signaling cascade such as PKC, JNK
  and IKK, as well as that of IRS-1 and downstream signaling mediators in the insulin
  signaling pathway, such as PI3 kinase, Akt and AS160, resulting in reduced GLUT4
  translocation and consequently a decrease in glucose uptake in to the heart. However,
  GLUT4 translocation has also been shown to be impaired in the heart in insulin resistant
  states in the absence of defects in PI3K and Akt signaling. In these circumstances,
  hyperactivation of Akt may further exacerbate lipotoxicity by increasing the translocation
  of CD36 to the plasma membrane. Increased β-oxidation leads to increased production
  of acetyl-CoA, NADH, AND FADH2, and citrate, which inhibit PDH and PFK respectively.
  Generation of Advanced glycation end product (AGE) precursors and AGEs due to increased
  flux of glucose via the aldose reductase pathway, are an unexplored pathway in insulin
  resistance. These pathways have been shown to impact signaling via PKC and PI3K/Akt
  and ROS generation.
