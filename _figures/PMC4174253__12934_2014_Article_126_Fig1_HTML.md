  AAA biosynthetic pathways intermediates and genes shown: ANT (anthranilate); PRANT
  (N-(5-phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate); CDP (1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1''-deoxyribulose
  5''-phosphate); IGP ((1S,2R)-1-C-(indol-3-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate); trpE, trpD (ANT

  tyrA, pheA (TyrA and PheA subunits of the CHA mutase, respectively); ilvE (subunit
  of the branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase); aspC (subunit of aspartate aminotransferase);
  tyrB (tyrosine aminotransferase). Continuous arrows show single enzymatic reactions,
  black dashed arrows show several enzymatic reactions, long-dashed blue arrows indicate
  allosteric regulation and dotted blue arrows indicate transcriptional repression.
