caption: 'The low antiviral gene expressions at the time of antiretroviral therapy
  (ART) initiation in cryptococcosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory
  syndrome (C-IRIS) group. The C-IRIS group exhibited significantly lower expression
  of genes associated with innate immune responses: specifically, those that involve
  activation of antiviral defense (for example, interferon-inducible genes (IFI),
  and other, connected with orange lines), or genes encoding enzymes, that directly
  restrict or inhibit viral replication (for example, oligoadenylate synthase [OAS]
  or helicases [DHX]). Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)
  family genes are predominantly induced by type I and type III interferons and are
  regulated by the pattern recognition and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The OAS
  genes encode a synthase family that is induced by interferons and catalyze the 2’,5’-oligomers
  of adenosine to bind and activate RNase L. The IFIT and OAS families of genes are
  one of many interferon-stimulated genes that play a significant role in the inhibition
  of cellular protein synthesis in infected cells and is particularly important in
  cellular resistance to viral infections. Transcripts (nodes), colored in blue, were
  downregulated (>1.5-fold) with the intensity of blue reflecting the degree of downregulation.
  Fold change for these transcripts’ expression is shown in . The orange line represents
  activation effect of the encoded protein. The blue line represents inactivation
  effect of the encoded protein. Transcripts were identified through functional analysis
  using Ingenuity Pathway Assistant (IPA) software.'
