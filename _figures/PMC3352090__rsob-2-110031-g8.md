caption: Model for the function of Poly in the InR–TOR signalling pathway. The interaction
  of Poly with (a) the insulin receptor allows it to fulfil a role as a positive regulator
  of InR–TOR signalling, which has the overall effect of increasing the phosphorylation
  and, hence, activity of numerous positive regulators of the InR–TOR pathway, such
  as Akt, S6K and 4E-BP, as well as inhibiting negative regulators of cell growth
  such as autophagy. Furthermore, Poly aids to promote anabolic metabolism resulting
  in an increase of TAG and Lsd-2 levels. (b) The absence of Poly leads to a decrease
  in the activation of positive regulators of cell growth such as Akt and S6K kinases.
  The 4E-BP protein becomes hypo-phosphorylated, consistent with an overall downregulation
  of InR–TOR signalling. Furthermore, autophagy—a negative effector of InR/TOR signalling—becomes
  constitutively active. Anabolic metabolism is downregulated as indicated by a decrease
  in TAG and Lsd-2 levels.
