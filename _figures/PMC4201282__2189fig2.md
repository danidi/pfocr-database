caption: (A) The PHD2:HIF pathway. (Left) Under normoxic conditions, PHD2 constitutively
  prolyl hydroxylates HIF-α, targeting it for degradation in a VHL-dependent manner.
  (Right) Under hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylation is arrested, allowing HIF-α
  stabilization, dimerization with HIF-β, and binding to hypoxia response elements
  (HREs) that control target genes. (B) The three PHDs. The prolyl hydroxylase (PH)
  domain resides at the C-terminal end of each paralog. PHD2 is distinctive in harboring
  a MYND zinc finger (ZF) at its N terminus. The amino acid sequence of this zinc
  finger (residues 21–58) is shown. Underlines denote predicted zinc chelating residues.
  The positions of PHD2 Asp4 and Cys127 are indicated by a red star and a black circle,
  respectively.
