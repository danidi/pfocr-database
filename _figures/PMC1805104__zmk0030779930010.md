caption: 'The synergistic effect of cell contact injury and TGF-β1 in the complex
  regulation of the SMA promoter. Contact disassembly activates Rho which, in turn
  stimulates mDia (1; ) and ROK (2). The former process leads to increased actin polymerization,
  whereas the latter activates the LIMK/cofilin pathway (2a) and stimulates MLC phosphorylation
  (2b). The LIMK/cofilin pathway may stabilize F-actin via decreased severing ().
  Enhanced MLC phosphorylation may contribute to SMA expression by acting through
  various nonexclusive mechanisms: it might promote actin polymerization/stabilization
  (i), may directly participate in the nuclear translocation or retention of MRTF
  (ii), or might be required for the internalization of cell contact components (iii;
  ). Increased nuclear accumulation of MRTF acts in concert with SRF through the CArG
  boxes. In addition, contact injury triggers the internalization of β-catenin, which—through
  yet unidentified mechanisms—potentiates the activation of the SMA promoter (). Finally,
  TGF-β1 activates a multitude of signaling pathways, which through various transcription
  factors impact on the TCE and SBE cis elements. TGF-β1 may also contribute to Rho
  activation; however, this effect in itself is insufficient to provoke long-lasting
  MLC phosphorylation, which has a permissive effect on the activation of the SMA
  promoter. The underlined processes or pathways are addressed in the current study.
  Question marks denote potential mechanisms. The relative contribution of the primary,
  permissive, and potentiating mechanisms remains to be defined.'
