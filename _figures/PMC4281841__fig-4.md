caption: XBP1s in vascular diseases. XBP1s mediates macrophage cell death, foam cell
  formation, and IL-8 and TNFα up-expression. XBP1s attenuates NF-κB, VCAM-1, and
  ICAM-1 expression in retinal vascular endothelial cells. XBP1s induces endothelial
  cell apoptosis, autophagy and proliferation, and increases cell size. XBP1s results
  in smooth muscle cell calcification. These different cellular events are involved
  in vascular diseases, including atherosclerotic initiation and progression and tissue
  and organ ischemia. ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; IL-8, interleukin-8;
  TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.
