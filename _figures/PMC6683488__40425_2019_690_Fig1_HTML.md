caption: Molecular landscape of SCLC. SCLC cells are characterized by ubiquitous loss
  of TP53 and Rb1 (dotted lines), the main G1-S cellular cycle checkpoints. SCLC cells
  depend on G2-M cell cycle checkpoint, that may be influenced by Aurora kinase A
  over-expression, characterizing the Myc-driven “variant” subtype of SCLC) and by
  Chk1-WEE1 axis. Chk1 is activated by Ataxia telangiectasia Mutated (ATM)/Ataxia
  telangiectasia and Rad-3 related protein (ATR) pathway upon chemo-induced DNA double
  strand break. After its activation, Chk1 can induce G2 cell cycle arrest through
  the phosphorylation of WEE1. Activated Chk1 can also up-regulate PD-L1 expression
  through the activation of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1–3
  (STAT1–3) mediated regulation of Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Signaling
  pathways involving Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), an epigenetic modifier inducible
  both by immunotherapy and cytotoxic agents, also seem crucial in SCLC. EZH2 activity
  is required for the acquisition of an immunosuppressive phenotype, down-regulating
  antigen presentation process (resistance to immune-therapy), and also for an enhanced
  chemo-resistance property, through the inhibition of Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11),
  a negative regulator of homologous repair machinery (HRM)
