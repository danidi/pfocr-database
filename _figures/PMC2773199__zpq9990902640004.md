caption: 'Two-branch model: regulation of subcellular compartmentalization, aflatoxin
  gene expression, and carbon flow. Compartmentalization (branch 1): the model proposes
  that Nor-1 (early), Ver-1 (middle), and OmtA (late) are synthesized on free ribosomes
  in the cytoplasm, packaged into transport vesicles (–), and transported to vacuoles
  via the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway (, ). In contrast Vbs localizes
  in the cytoplasm and in structures thought to be Golgi (), suggesting it is transported
  to vacuoles via the classical secretory pathway; VBS is glycolsylated in support
  of this notion. Gene regulation (branch 2): sensing of glucose concentration or
  glucose metabolism initiates a FadA/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway (); details of mechanism
  for sensing or metabolism of sucrose are not known. Carbon flow highlighted in red.
  Mitochondria and peroxisomes supply acetyl-CoA () to polyketide synthesis. The occurrence
  of early steps in aflatoxin synthesis (acetyl-CoA→norsolorinic acid) in peroxisomes
  was proposed by others (). In the current study, we show the function of late pathway
  enzymes in aflatoxigenic vesicles (aflatoxisomes) that also participate in aflatoxin
  export. Our data also suggest the presence and activity of early and middle pathway
  enzymes in aflatoxisomes. Coordination of 2 branches (current study). At least 2
  separate signals (carbon source and light) trigger VeA activity that coordinates
  regulation of the 2 branches involved in aflatoxin synthesis/export (denoted by
  thick black arrows). One branch up-regulates gene transcription via activation of
  general and specific transcription factors (reviewed in ref. ). The second branch
  down-regulates class C Vps tethering complex (Tc) activity (current study), resulting
  in accumulation of transport vesicles. When both branches are operational, aflatoxin
  enzymes accumulate in aflatoxisomes where they carry out aflatoxin synthesis and
  export the toxin to the cell exterior. Hypothesized pathways denoted by dashed lines;
  known pathways denoted by solid lines. PM, plasma membrane.'
