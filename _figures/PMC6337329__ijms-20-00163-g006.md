caption: 'Proposed model of molecular interactions and clustering analysis. (a) Diagrammatic
  overview of the interactions implicating RSU-1 in basic metastasis-related cellular
  properties based on our findings. All arrows and lines in black designate known
  connections based on the literature, while green and red arrows and lines represent
  connections proposed based on the findings of the present work. RSU-1 has been previously
  shown to inhibit cell proliferation [,,], and spreading through inhibition of Rac
  [] and promote cell invasion [,], while data on cell migration seem to be dependent
  on the cell type or system used [,]. Data from the present work suggest that RSU-1
  positively regulates PINCH-1 and PARVA whereas it negatively regulates ILK while
  it also seems to activate GDF-15 providing another link towards cell invasion. The
  blue bi-directional arrow connecting RSU-1 and GDF-15 conveys the main finding of
  this study, that RSU-1 depletion inhibits GDF-15 (), but GDF-15 treatment also upregulates
  RSU-1 (). (b) Clusters of pathways each one shaded by a different color. Herein
  the edge betweeness community detection algorithm detects communities by progressively
  removing edges from the original network that are most likely “between” communities.
  The black edges (lines) refer to the connections between nodes that form the identified
  clusters, while the red ones refer to those that have been excluded by the algorithm.
  (c) Complementary network of pathways: the nodes refer to the pathway names while
  the edges refer to the functional connection between them as provided by the Kyoto
  Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) reference network. The blue nodes refer
  to the initial pathways identified in this work while green nodes refer to the complementary
  pathways obtained by the shortest path algorithm described in the text.'
