caption: The Hedgehog signaling cascade. (A) In the absence of its ligand, the Hh
  receptor PTCH localizes to the primary cilium where it interferes with SMO ciliary
  trafficking and activation. GLI proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by SUFU
  where they undergo phosphorylation followed by either degradation or processing
  into repressor forms (GLIR). Both GLI2 and GLI3 undergo proteolytic modification
  into repressor forms GLI2R and GLI3R, whereas GLI1, lacking a repressor domain does
  not. (B) Upon Hh ligand binding, PTCH suppression of SMO is relieved resulting in
  SMO ciliary translocation and activation. Cell surface receptors regulating Hh ligand‐PTCH
  interaction include positive regulators CDO* (cell adhesion molecule‐related/downregulated
  by oncogenes), BOC* (brother of Cdo), and GAS1* (growth arrest‐specific gene 1)
  and negative regulator HHIP (Hh‐interacting protein). Activated SMO promotes trafficking
  of SUFU‐GLI complexes to the distal cilium followed by dissociation of GLI proteins
  from SUFU. Activation of GLI1 and inhibition of GLI2 and GLI3 proteolytic processing
  occur leading to formation of full‐length GLI transcription factors in their activator
  form (GLIA). Nuclear translocation of GLIA ensues and leads to upregulation of Hh
  target genes. Functional redundancy exists between GLI1 and GLI2; both GLI1 and
  GLI2 regulate the expression of overlapping target genes and GLI2 also upregulates
  GLI1 expression. GLI‐mediated transcriptional output is also influenced by the context‐dependent
  activator/repressor functions of GLI. Different combinations of activator and repressor
  forms of GLI regulate the expression of either distinct or partially overlapping
  sets of genes, ultimately leading to diverse cellular responses. *While the role
  of BOC, GAS1, and CDO has been described in non‐small‐cell lung cancer, pancreatic,
  and prostate cancer, a direct connection to Hh signaling in TNBC, specifically,
  has not been reported.
