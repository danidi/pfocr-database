caption: Intracellular NAD+synthesis in S. cerevisiae. (A) NAD+ is synthesized via
  the salvage pathway from vitamin precursors (nicotinic acid [NA], nicotinamide [Nam],
  and nicotinamide ribose [NmR]) and putative precursors (nicotinic acid ribose [NaR]
  and nicotinamide mononucleotide [NMN]) or by the kynurenine (de novo) pathway from
  Trp. (B) Reactions from Trp leading to QA in the kynurenine pathway are catalyzed
  by Bna2/7/4/5/1 and Aro9. For both panels, general enzyme names and reactions are
  provided in Table S1 in the supplemental material.
