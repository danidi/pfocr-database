caption: 'Left panel: phospholipase D2 (PLD2)-generated phosphatidic acid (PtdOH)
  recruits and binds to AKT and subsequently promotes autophagy via beclin 1, as detailed
  in . During the process of autophagy, autophagosomes fuse with endosomes and lysosomes,
  which leads to their maturation into autolysosomes. These display the autophagy
  markers LC3 (light chain 3, also known as MAP1LC3) and p62 (also known as sequestosome
  1). This process results in acidification and allows the autolysosome to digest
  captured cellular material such as viruses. The respective details of PLD1 and PLD2
  activation are discussed elsewhere. Right panel: this shows a PLD1 pathway that
  affects pyrimidine biosynthesis and intracellular deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate
  (dNTP) levels via the enzyme CAD (which contains carbamoyl aspartate synthase, aspartate
  transcarbamylase and dihydro-orotase domains). PLD1 allosterically modulates the
  activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which leads to the phosphorylation
  of CAD and enhances its catalytic activity. The subsequent production of pyrimidine
  nucleotides via the activation of CAD is independent of AKT. PLD1 inhibition, in
  turn, can lead to reductions in dNTP production.'
