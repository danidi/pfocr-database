caption: The impact of redox imbalance on canonical pathway of miRNAs biogenesis.
  For more detailed description see . Stimulatory interactions are indicated by arrows
  (except for the sharp black arrows) and inhibition by T-bars. Arrows which are crossed
  out denote the withdrawal of the stimulation. Red interactions and crosses mark
  the impact of oxidative stress. Processes/phenomena, elements concerning subsequent
  stages of produced miRNA, side product of miRNA biogenesis, proteins/compounds are
  highlighted in blue, yellow, grey and green, respectively. The figure was made using
  the PathVisio 3.3.0 free open-source software []. miRNA—microRNA, pri-miRNA—primary
  microRNA, pre-miRNA—premature microRNA, Ran-GTP—Ras-related nuclear protein-guanosine-5’-triphosphate,
  GSK3β—glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta, Drosha—Drosha class 2 Ribonuclease III, DICER—Dicer
  1, Ribonuclease III, RISC—RNA-induced silencing complex, IRE1α—inositol-requiring
  enzyme 1 α.
