caption: Regulation of MAPK and NF-κB pathways and their manipulation by bacterial
  effectors. Bacterial infection triggers PAMP-dependent activation of PRRs at the
  host cell membrane. Receptor activation triggers MKKK phosphorylation, which in
  turn activates MAPK pathways and the NF-κB pathway via activation of the IKK complex.
  IKK phosphorylates IκB, which then becomes polyubiquitinated and removed by proteasomal
  degradation. Degradation of IκB exposes the NLS on NF-κB, which subsequently undergoes
  nuclear translocation and binds to κB sites in target promoters to stimulate transcription
  of genes required for pro-inflammatory responses, such as cytokines and chemokines,
  and genes involved in cell proliferation. Activation of NF-κB also leads to surface
  expression of receptors such as CEACAMs, which are hijacked by pathogens to promote
  their attachment to the host cell surface. Some κB site-containing promoters require
  RPS3 as a transcriptional co-factor in addition to NF-κB. RPS3 nuclear translocation
  is dependent on its phosphorylation by IKKβ. Bacterial pathogens manipulate both
  MAPK and NF-κB pathways either by acting as inhibitors (red boxes) or activators
  (green box) of individual components.
