caption: SYK and downstream kinases are essential to drive inflammation and blistering
  in experimental epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA). This schematic summarizes
  the current understanding of the events leading to blistering in experimental EBA.
  (1) The initial event is the binding of the IgG and/or IgA autoantibodies directed
  against type VII collagen (COL7). (2) Thereafter, anaphylatoxins are generated by
  activation of the complement cascade. Furthermore, several cytokines lipid mediators
  are released, which collectedly leads (3) to the activation of endothelial cells
  and allows the (4) CD18/ICAM-1-dependent extravasation of Gr-1+ myeloid cells into
  the skin. (5) Within the skin, myeloid cells bind to the skin-bound immune complexes
  via specific activating Fc gamma receptors (FcγR). (6) FcγR binding triggers an
  intracellular signaling cascade involving SYK, p38, ERK, and Akt, ultimately leading
  to the activation of the NCF1 gene, which is part of the NADPH oxidase complex and
  generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). Within this pathway, we show an absolute
  requirement of SYK for blister induction in EBA. Blockade of downstream kinases
  (i.e., p38, Akt, or individual Src family kinases) only partially reduces the blistering
  phenotype, indicating that SYK activation is in the center stage of EBA pathogenesis.
  (7) Ultimately, this intracellular signaling process leads to the release of ROS
  and proteases from the myeloid cells, which (8) mediates blistering. Image modified
  from Ludwig et al. ().
