caption: Top panel, Model of P pilus formation by the chaperone-usher pathway in uropathogenic
  E. coli. After secretion of pilus subunits into the periplasm via the general Sec
  machinery, periplasmic chaperones (dark green) serve as folding templates, providing
  a beta-sheet that enables proper folding of the pilin subunits into immunoglobulin-like
  domains, but in a non-conical orientation, in a mechanism called donor strand complementation.
  Assembly and anchoring of the pilus occurs at an outer membrane pore known as the
  usher (orange). The pilus tip adhesin (red) is the first subunit to interact with
  the usher, via a preferential interaction between the tip adhesin/periplasmic chaperone
  complex and the usher N-terminal periplasmic domain (NTD, light blue), and this
  interaction initiates assembly by causing a conformational change in the usher that
  “unplugs” (Plug, dark blue) the pore and displaces the tip adhesin subunit/chaperone
  complex to two C-terminal usher domains, CTD1 (yellow) and CTD2 (purple) (, , ).
  The next pilin subunit/chaperone complex then binds to the NTD and if it has an
  N-terminal extension that is able to complete the immunoglobulin fold of the preceding
  subunit in a canonical fashion, this provides the free energy to displace the chaperone,
  in a process called donor strand exchange, and drive assembly (–, ). In P pili,
  this occurs repeatedly, incorporating anywhere from hundreds to thousands of PapA
  major pilin subunits (green) in the pilus, until PapH (brown) is incorporated into
  pilus. PapH is a terminator because it is unable to undergo donor strand exchange
  (). Small molecule inhibitors (pink) that disrupt pilus assembly (“pilicides”) or
  adhesin binding to its receptor (“pilus adhesin antagonists”) have been identified
  (, ). Bottom panel, Model of sortase-mediated assembly of the endocarditis- and
  biofilm-associated pilus (Ebp pilus) in E. faecalis (). Unlike CUP pili in Gram-negative
  bacteria, sortase-assembled pilus subunits are covalently linked. Pilin subunits
  are first secreted to the outside of the cell via the general Sec machinery, and
  are retained in the membrane via a hydrophobic domain within their cell wall sorting
  sequence. Sortase C (SrtC, yellow) cleaves the EbpA (red) LPETG sequence, resulting
  in an EbpA-SrtC thioacyl intermediate that is resolved by the EbpC (green) Lys186
  nucleophile. Pilus polymerization occurs when SrtC processes the EbpC LPSTG sequence
  at the base of a growing, membrane-associated pilus forming a pilus-SrtC intermediate
  that is resolved by the Lys186 of an incoming EbpC subunit. EbpB (brown) incorporates
  at the base of a pilus fiber when its Lys179 nucleophile resolves a pilus-SrtC intermediate.
  Sortase A (SrtA, blue) processing of the EbpB LPKTN sequence leads to eventual incorporation
  of the mature pilus into the cell wall. Sortase inhibitors (pink) may be useful
  for disrupting the virulence potential of Gram-positive uropathogens.
