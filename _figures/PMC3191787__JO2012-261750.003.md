caption: Tumor cell-derived PDGF-B induced pericyte differentiation. Incorporation
  of pericytes into newly formed vessels is one of the key steps to terminate angiogenesis.
  Studies in animal models have shown that PDGF-B is responsible for (1) differentiation
  of pericytes from mesenchymal stem cells through the PDGF-B-NRP-1 signaling pathway
  (2) increased recruitment and attachment of newly differentiated pericytes into
  newly formed tumor vessels. In addition, Flk1+ cells differentiate into endothelial
  cells or pericytes upon stimulation by VEGF or PDGF-B [].
