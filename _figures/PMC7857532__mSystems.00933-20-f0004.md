caption: Schematic representation of STRING output and targeted pathway analyses.
  Lines between genes represent a putative metabolic association. Three pathways involved
  in arginine/proline, chorismate/tryptophan, and propanoate synthesis are color coordinated
  purple, cyan, and orange, respectively. Candidates chosen to further validate Met-Seq
  results (see ) are circled in red.
