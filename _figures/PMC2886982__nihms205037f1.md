caption: a |  In the lean state, small adipocytes efficiently store fatty acids as
  triglyceride (TG input, arrow), which can be mobilized and used to generate ATP
  through the mitochondrial β-oxidation pathway in muscle during periods of caloric
  need. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake under these conditions is normal. b |  Excess
  caloric intake leads to metabolic overload, increased TG input and adipocyte enlargement.
  Nonetheless, in non-diabetic overweight individuals, TG storage by adipose cells
  and β-oxidation in muscle can often be maintained to prevent insulin resistance.
  c |  On further overloading with TG, hypertrophy of adipocytes and increased secretion
  of macrophage chemoattractants occurs, including the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant
  protein-1 (MCP-1; arrows), which recruits additional macrophages. d |  Macrophage
  recruitment in turn results in a pro-inflammatory state in obese adipose tissue.
  Infiltrating macrophages secrete large amounts of tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNFα),
  which results in a chronic inflammatory state with impaired TG deposition and increased
  lipolysis (arrow and plus signal). The excess of circulating TG and free fatty acids
  results in the accumulation of activated lipids in the muscle (yellow dots), disrupting
  functions such as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and insulin-stimulated
  glucose transport, thus triggering insulin resistance.
