caption: Selenite-inducedROSinhibited the activity of JNK,s which further caused dephosphorylation
  of ATF2, a transcriptional factor of some cell cycle-related proteins such as Cylin
  A, Cyclin D3 and CDK4. As a result, NB4 cells were arrested at G0/G1 phase and finally
  underwent an obvious apoptosis progression. After selenite exposure, ROS was arisen
  rapidly, which further inhibited JNK/ATF2 axis. The inactivation of ATF2 resulted
  in the decreased affinity of this transcriptional factor for the promoters of cyclin
  A, cyclin D3 and CDK4, which in turn led NB4 cells to be arrested at G0/G1 phase
  and undergo apoptosis
