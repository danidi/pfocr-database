caption: The hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) and the O-GlcNAc posttranslational
  modification. (a) An estimated 1–3% of the total glucose enters HBP. The key enzymatic
  reaction of this pathway is the addition of an amino group from glutamine to fructose-6-phosphate
  by the rate-limiting enzyme glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT).
  Following subsequent steps (addition of an acetyl group, converting 6-phosphate
  to 1-phosphate and finally the transfer to UDP), the end product of HBP is uridine
  diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). (b) The majority of UDP-GlcNAc is
  utilized in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus for various glycolipid,
  glycoprotein, and glycan synthesis. A small, but significant, percentage of UDP-GlcNAc
  serves as a substrate pool for the dynamic, reversible posttranslational modification
  termed O-GlcNAc. A single N-acetylglucosamine group is attached to the Ser/Thr residues
  of target proteins by O-GlcNAc transferase, while the removal of this group is managed
  by the enzyme O-GlcNAcase. O-GlcNAc modification occurs predominantly in the cytoplasm
  and in the nucleus, and it is strongly dependent on substrate availability (i.e.,
  the metabolic flux through HBP).
