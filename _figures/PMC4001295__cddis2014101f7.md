caption: Opposing TNF-α/IL-1β- and BMP-2-activated MAPK signaling pathways converge
  on Runx2 to regulate BMP-2-induced osteoblastic differentiation. (a) BMP-2 activates
  the canonical BMP/Smad signaling pathway and non-canonical MAPK pathways to regulate
  osteoblastic differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells. In the activated MAPK pathways,
  only p38 and ERK1/2 signaling are required to regulate the expression and activation
  of Runx2. (b) TNF-α and IL-1β also activate p38, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2 signaling, but
  they act to oppose the effects of BMP-2 on Runx2 expression and osteoblastic differentiation.
  (c) Without the positive influence of BMP/Smad signaling, both ERK1/2 and JNK1/2
  signaling are activated, but BMP-2-induced Runx2 activity is inhibited, resulting
  in the suppression of osteoblastic differentiation
