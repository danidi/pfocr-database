caption: (a) When IAPs are present, TNFR1 or TLR–TRIF signalling results in IAP-mediated
  ubiquitylation of RIPK1 or RIPK3, respectively, to propagate pro-survival signals
  and gene induction. (b) If IAPs are inactivated but caspase-8 is present (left panel),
  LPS stimulation induces the ripoptosome platform to activate caspase-8 (ubiquitylated).
  Caspase-8 can (i) trigger apoptosis, (ii) cleave pro-IL-1β directly into its mature
  form or (iii) promote NLRP3-associated caspase-1 activation, by a mechanism yet
  to be defined. Alternatively, if both IAPs and caspase-8 are inactive (right panel),
  LPS induces the formation of the RIPK3–MLKL necrosome that, in addition to causing
  necroptotic cell death, activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. This necroptotic pathway
  is associated with RIPK3 and MLKL ubiquitylation, which may control RIPK3/MLKL signalling
  and/or stability. (c) Genetic loss or inhibition of cIAPs alone or XIAP and cIAPs
  in myeloid cells cause differential effects on cell death, cytokine production and
  haematopoiesis leading to spontaneous arthritis. Loss of all three IAPs leads to
  spontaneous systemic inflammatory disease, featuring mild joint inflammation. Disease
  is associated with increased cytokine release, including IL-1β and TNF, as well
  as apoptotic and necroptotic cell death and the accumulation of innate inflammatory
  cells. In contrast, loss of cIAP1/2 causes severe arthritis that is associated specifically
  with enhanced TNF levels and only modest effects on haematopoiesis.
