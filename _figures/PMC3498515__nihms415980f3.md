caption: T. cruzi infection elicits generation of superoxide (O2•−) through activation
  of NADPH oxidase in phagocytic cells. T. cruzi invasion of other cells elicits intracellular
  Ca+2 flux affecting mitochondrial membrane potential and results in increased leakage
  of electrons from the electron transport chain to molecular oxygen and formation
  of O2•− and other reactive oxygen species (ROS). Two pathways of ROS signaling of
  the NFκB pathway are envisioned. One, ROS directly promotes phosphorylation and
  transport of p65 (RelA) and p50 to nucleus, assembly of transcription complex, and
  expression of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, TNF-α). Two, ROS-mediated oxidation
  of DNA may signal activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1). PARP-1 cleaves
  NAD+ to form ADP-ribose and polymerizes the latter onto nuclear acceptor proteins
  (e.g. histones), transcription factors, and PARP itself, and contributes to DNA
  repair and genomic stability. Binding of poly ADP-ribose (PAR) molecules activates
  NF-κB transcription complex and inflammatory cytokine gene expression. The feed-back
  loop of ROS generation and cytokine gene expression contribute to persistence of
  inflammatory responses and oxidative damage, and progressive evolution of cardiomyopathy
  in Chagas disease.
