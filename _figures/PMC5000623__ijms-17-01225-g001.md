caption: Gut microbiota and energy balance. The gut microbes can benefit the host
  by extracting energies from otherwise non-digestible carbohydrates and plant polysaccharides
  via enzymes not encoded by humans. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) modulate intestinal
  gluconeogenesis via the gut-brain neuronal circuit, involving GPR41 (free fatty
  acid receptor, FFAR3) and through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent
  pathway. Butyrate is able to regulate the appetite in the central nervous system
  by stimulating the liberation of peptide YY (PYY) and the satietogenic hormone glucagon-like
  peptide 1 (GLP-1) from enteroendocrine L-cells. PYY decreases the intestinal transit
  rate and increases the harvest of energy from the diet, while GLP-1 improves adipocyte
  insulin sensitivity and remarkably reduces fat storage in adipose tissue. Gut microbes
  can also control the metabolic activity of the host by affecting the composition
  and the abundance of certain bile acid species. In the ileum microbes deconjugate
  cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids, which escape intestinal uptake, and are converted
  into secondary bile acids. Bile acids can also act as signaling molecules by binding
  cellular receptors such as the bile-acid-synthesis controlling nuclear receptor
  farnesoid X receptor (FXR), G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), and TGR5. While
  primary bile acids can impair glucose metabolism by binding FXR, secondary bile
  acids, by binding TGR5, improve glucose homeostasis and increase energy expenditure
  in skeletal muscle.
