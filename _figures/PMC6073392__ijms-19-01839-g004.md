caption: 'The modulation of glucose metabolism by HPV oncoproteins favor glycolysis
  instead of OXPHOS. HR-HPV E6 oncoproteins promote glucose uptake through the overexpression
  of glucose transporters GLUT and SGLT. Both E6 and E7 oncoproteins induce the expression
  of hexokinase, enzyme associated to the first step of glucose metabolism. Moreover,
  E6 can promote nucleotide synthesis through the degradation of p53, which is an
  antagonist of glucose 6-P-dehidrogenase, a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP). The glycolytic pathway is carried out in two phases. First, in the preparatory
  or glucose activation phase, a six-carbon glucose molecule breaks down into two
  molecules with three carbons each: one glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and the other
  is dihydroxyacetone phosphate, which is transformed into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
  In these reactions, two molecules of ATP are consumed. Second, the energy extraction
  phase, involves the conversion of the two glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate molecules into
  two pyruvate molecules by pyruvate kinase, which is activated by E6 and E7 oncoproteins.
  This process results in the production of four ATP molecules through substrate-level
  phosphorylation. Pyruvate is metabolized to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  which, in turn, is negatively regulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDK2).
  PDK2 is activated in the absence of p53, a process induced by E6, avoiding acetyl-CoA
  production. Moreover, p53 degradation avoids glutaminase 2 (GLS2) activation and
  glutaminolysis, which in turn decreases α-ketoglutarate levels. Thus, E6 does not
  permit an optimal function of the Krebs cycle, inducing lactate production by lactate
  dehydrogenase. E6 prevents the expression of miRNA34a and lactate dehydrogenase
  deactivation. HPV type is indicated. T arrows indicate inhibition. Black line arrows
  and thick blue arrows indicate the direction of the reaction.'
