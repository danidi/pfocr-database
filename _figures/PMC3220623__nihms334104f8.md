caption: Glutamate released from corticostriatal projection neurons stimulates NR1A/NR2B
  NMDAR and mGluR5 receptors on striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs).(A) In normal
  MSNs, NMDAR activation triggers Ca2+ influx from extracellular sources. Activation
  of mGluR5 stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) via a heterotrimeric G protein (G) pathway
  to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (InsP3) second messengers.
  Activation of mGluR5 cooperates with NMDAR activation largely through the actions
  of DAG, which activates PKC. The InsP3 generated downstream of mGluR5 does not trigger
  robust Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in response to low levels
  of glutamate, as InsP3R1 sensitivity to InsP3 is low. The association of Htt with
  the cytosolic carboxy-terminal tail of the InsP3R1 is weak and with the PSD95-NR1A/NR2B
  is strong. In this schematic, only the interaction of Htt with the InsP3R1 carboxy-terminal
  tail is represented. This interaction appears to be stabilized by the presence of
  HAP1A (labeled as HAP1) in normal MSNs.(B) In MSNs of Huntington’s disease (HD)
  patients, Httexp perturbs Ca2+signaling via two synergistic mechanisms. Httexp enhances
  NMDAR function, possibly through decreased interaction with the PSD95-NR1A/NR2B
  complex. In addition, Httexp strongly binds to InsP3R1 carboxy terminus and sensitizes
  the InsP3R1 to activation by InsP3. As a result, low levels of glutamate released
  from corticostriatal projection neurons lead to supranormal Ca2+ influx via NMDAR
  and Ca2+ release via the InsP3R1. The net result is elevated intracellular Ca2+
  levels in MSNs that eventually trigger pathogenic Ca2+-dependent downstream pathways
  such as increased caspase and calpain activity, increased Htt proteolysis, activation
  of the apoptotic program, and MSN degeneration.
