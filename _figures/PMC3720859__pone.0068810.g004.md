number: Figure 4
caption: Molecules are represented as nodes and the biological relationship between
  two nodes is represented as an edge (line). All edges are supported by at least
  one reference from the literature, from a textbook, or from canonical information
  stored in the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. The intensity of the node color
  indicates the degree of up- (red) or down- (green) regulation. Direct relationships
  are indicated by solid lines. Line beginnings and endings illustrate the direction
  of the relationship (e.g. arrow head indicates gene A influences gene B). Nodes
  are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene
  product. Edges are displayed with various labels that describe the nature of the
  relationship between the nodes (e.g., P for phosphorylation, T for transcription).
