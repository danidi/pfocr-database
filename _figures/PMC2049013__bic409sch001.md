caption: Polyamine depletion inhibits E47 transcription which in turn increases p21Cip1
  gene expression and protects IEC-6 cells from TNFα- and CHX-mediated apoptosis.
  Polyamine depletion also decreases caspase 3 activity, sustaining the phosphorylation
  of p130Cas and preventing the cleavage of p130Cas, which generates 31 kDa Cas. The
  31 kDa Cas inhibits p21Cip1 expression and sensitizes cells to apoptosis. (↓ and
  ⊥ refer to activation and inhibition respectively).
