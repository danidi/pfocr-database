caption: Vibriobactin biosynthesis. (A) Biosynthetic pathway. 2,3-Dihydroxybenzoate
  is synthesized from chorismate by the sequential activities of VibC, VibB, and VibA.
  VibB is a bifunctional enzyme that is also required for a later step in biosynthesis.
  VibB and VibF are modified by the attachment of phosphopantetheine arms to the aryl
  carrier protein domain of VibB and the peptidyl carrier domain of VibF (). VibD,
  which is required for late steps in vibriobactin synthesis (), is predicted to be
  the phosphopantetheine transferase based on homology and its ability to complement
  an E. coli entD mutation (). VibE activates DHBA forming the acyl adenylate and
  transfers it to the free thiol of the phosphopantetheine (). This DHB thioester
  is combined with norspermidine by the condensation domain protein VibH to produce
  N1-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)norspermidine (). VibF activates and covalently loads the
  PCP domain with l-threonine and heterocyclizes 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-VibB with l-Thr.
  The aryl oxazoline is then transferred to N1-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)norspermidine.
  VibF catalyzes a second oxazoline acylation, yielding vibriobactin. (B) Domain structure
  of the vibriobactin biosynthesis enzymes VibF, VibB, and VibH. The NRPS VibF is
  the scaffold for assembly, and the indicated domains act in an assembly-line fashion
  to construct the final product.
