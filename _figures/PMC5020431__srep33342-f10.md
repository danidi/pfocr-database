caption: 'GhPEPC1 works as a core enzyme not only involved in photosynthesis but also
  regulated the inflowing of carbon turnover to fatty acid biosynthesis and finally
  contributed to the increase of cottonseed oil content. In this report, the carboxylation
  pathway of PEP to OAA was blocked through RNAi of GhPEPC1 and resulted in a decline
  in OAA concentration. Under this background, more proteins would be converted to
  aspartate involved in anaplerotic reactions to offset the OAA deficiency in mitochondrial
  and this hypothesis has been confirmed by our RNA-seq data. Among the DEGs, the
  glutamine-dependent asparagine synthase 1 was found to be down-regulated in the
  RNAi lines. Simultaneously, more pyruvate will be transported into mitochondria
  due to the acceleration of glycolysis, through mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC)
  located in the mitochondrial inner membrane. The pyruvate located in mitochondria
  was then involved into two metabolism branches: conversion into acetyl-CoA through
  pyruvate decarboxylation with pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and other irreversible
  carboxylation to form OAA by pyruvate carboxylase (PC) ligase to serves as an anaplerotic
  reaction for TCA. The excessive acetyl CoA and relative lack of OAA forced chloroplasts
  to the heighten light-dependent reactions based on photosynthetic electron transport
  chains and which produced the ATP and NADPH by using Calvin cycle, where the fixed
  CO2 was converted as sucrose to provide substrate for glycolysis. However, the RNAi
  cotton plant was in a state of ‘starvation’ because of the down-regulation of GhPEPC
  and the TCA were confined. Moreover, the expression levels of ACC in transgenic
  lines were significantly increased, which indicates that superfluous acetyl-CoA
  could combine with OAA and form citrate and then transported to cytoplasm via citrate
  transport protein (CTP). These citrates have participated into biosynthesis of fatty
  acids and finally stored in cottonseed in the form of TAG. The red marker region
  indicated that relevant genes exhibiting rising trend in RNA-seq data. The blue
  marker indicated down-regulated genes.'
