caption: Model for RDR6 function in antiviral defense against PVX. In the inoculated
  cell (lower box) PVX replicates, forming dsRNA with genomic or subgenomic and antisense
  RNA in the process (1). DCL recognizes the dsRNA as a substrate and produces virus-derived
  siRNA (2), which guides RISC to the viral RNA (3). siRNA, probably bound to a transporter
  protein (4), are translocated through the phloem stream into upper parts of the
  plant alongside the coated viral RNA (5). Viral RNA and virus-derived siRNA are
  unloaded simultaneously into cells in the upper part of the plant and the virus-derived
  siRNA can anneal to the unpacked viral RNA immediately (6). Annealed siRNA could
  either be used as a primer by RDR6 to produce the dsRNA substrate for DCL (7) or
  they could guide RISC to cleave the viral RNA, leaving an aberrant (noncapped or
  nonpolyadenylated respectively) RNA that is recognized by RDR6 for unprimed synthesis
  of the dsRNA substrate for DCL (8). Both pathways lead to immediate production of
  siRNA to target viral RNA for RISC-mediated destruction. If no signal or no RDR6
  is present in the receiving tissue, this immediate response is not possible and
  production of viral siRNA relies on viral replication, giving the virus a head start
  before the silencing machinery. Once the infection is fully established, the viral
  replicase produces abundant substrate for DCL and the RDR6 pathway does not contribute
  significantly to virus-derived siRNA production anymore.
