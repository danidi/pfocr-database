caption: Simplified model of the molecular machinery involved in the transcriptional
  regulation of the SA signaling pathway (A), the JA signaling pathway (B), or the
  antagonism of SA on the JA signaling pathway (C). By inducing reduction and monomerization
  of NPR1, SA activates NPR1 (star-shaped), which then triggers gene expression in
  the nucleus. JA-responsive genes are kept in check by JAZ repressors in the absence
  of JA. In the presence of JA, MYC or ERF transcription factors activate JA-responsive
  genes, but only if SA is absent. Activation of both the SA and JA signaling pathways
  leads to antagonism of JA-responsive gene expression by SA. There are indications
  for roles in SA/JA crosstalk for cytosolic NPR1, and nuclear localized TGAs, GRX480,
  and WRKYs. See text for details on the molecular processes underlying the transcriptional
  control, like redox signaling, sequestration, degradation, phosphorylation, and
  chromatin modification. Solid lines indicate established (in)activities and dashed
  lines hypothesized (in)activities, where black arrows specify activation and red
  blocks suppression. Red crosses indicate that gene transcription is hampered.
