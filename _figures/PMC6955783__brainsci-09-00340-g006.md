caption: 'Hypothesized pathway and consequences of glutamine uptake in 2 h post METH
  STR microglia. Binge dose METH leads to neuronal release of glutamate. Glutamate
  is taken up by astrocytes, converted to glutamine, and released to the extracellular
  space. Upregulation of genes for several glutamine transporters suggests the enhanced
  uptake of glutamine by microglia. The potential increased levels of glutamine would
  stoichiometrically be converted to glutamate and ammonia []. The resulting enhanced
  levels of glutamate may be met by the enhanced expression of Gclc, the gene for
  the first rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis, and enhanced expression
  of Slc7a11, the gene for a cystine/glutamate transporter. This combination may drive
  the enhanced synthesis of γ-glutamylcysteine and the reduced form of glutathione
  (GSH). The utility of GSH to participate in detoxifying reactive species may be
  thwarted by the concurrent downregulation of genes for several glutathione-S-transferases
  (GSTs). Enhanced expression of Sod1 via the IPA-predicted enhancement NRF2 signaling
  may serve to partially reduce the amounts of METH-generated reactive oxygen species.
  However, there is incomplete conversion of the resulting toxic hydrogen peroxide
  to water and alcohol and accompanying generation of oxidized glutathione due to
  the downregulation of genes for catalase (Cat) and glutathione peroxidase 8 (Gpx8),
  respectively. Other sources of toxic species resulting from enhanced uptake of glutamine
  by microglia could be the enhanced presence/release of ammonia after the conversion
  of glutamine to glutamate via the concurrent downregulation of glutamate dehydrogenase
  1 (Glud1) as well as the enhanced export of glutamate via upregulated Slc7a11. Changes
  in gene expression are denoted by text color and font for the gene symbol: Green
  = no significant change. Red, bold = significant upregulation. Blue, bold = significant
  downregulation. Gene expression data can be found in .'
