caption: The proposed mechanism by which decanal protects photoaging in dermal fibroblasts.
  As depicted, higher production of cAMP in response to decanal increases the procollagen
  levels. The mechanism of cAMP-mediated procollagen production is not yet fully defined.
  On the other hand, cAMP production in response to decanal decreases the MMPs levels,
  with the possible involvement of the PKA/MAPK/AP-1 pathway. Then, collagen is less
  cleaved by decreased MMPs, resulting in increased hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) gene
  expression and hyaluronic acid levels.
