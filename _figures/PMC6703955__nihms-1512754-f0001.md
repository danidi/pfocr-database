caption: 'The outlines of Hh signaling(A) In Drosophila, Ptc keeps Smo inactive, partly
  by promoting its internalization and degradation. Full-length Ci is sequestered
  in the cytoplasm in a complex with Cos2, Fu and Sufu, whereas Ci repressor (CiR)
  inhibits target gene expression in the nucleus. Hh blocks Ptc function, allowing
  the phosphorylation and dimerization/oligomerization of Smo, leading to Ci activation
  (CiA) and target gene expression. MT: microtubule;(B) In vertebrates, Ptch1 in the
  primary cilia prevents Smo ciliary localization and activation. Gli3 enters the
  cilia with Sufu and Kif7 and is processed into Gli3R. Shh binds Ptch1, leading to
  Smo ciliary translocation, phosphorylation, dimerization/oligomerization and Gli3
  activation (Gli3A). A membrane barrier near the base of the cilia prevents free
  diffusion of Smo.'
