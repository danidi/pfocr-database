caption: 'Simplified version of the complement cascade showing initiation on foreign/altered
  surfaces via the classical (CP), lectin (LP) and alternative (AP) pathways, generation
  of AP and CP/LP C3 convertases, amplification via the AP, and effector generation
  mainly via the AP and the terminal pathway. Some components, particularly the natural
  regulators/inhibitors, are not shown. Major effector functions in both physiological
  and pathophysiological contexts are listed in green and orange boxes, respectively
  (a yellow box signifies ambivalent function). Blue arrows represent conversion and/or
  assembly, green arrows enzymatic cleavage, and black dotted arrows signaling events.
  The various complement components are colored to signify major target classes as
  relevant for drug development (see legend). Inhibitors currently listed in the pipelines
  of pharmaceutical/biotech companies or known to be in clinical development are shown
  at their respective target, with red symbols to mark the inhibitor type (see legend);
  numbers refer to the inhibitor list in the upper right corner. Abbreviations: CL-11,
  collectin 11; CR, complement receptor; CRIg, CR of the immunoglobulin family; FB,
  factor B; Fcn, ficolins; FD, factor D; FP, properdin (factor P); MAC, membrane attack
  complex; MASP, MBL-associated serine protease; MBL, mannose-binding lectin.'
