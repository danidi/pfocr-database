caption: '5-FU, oxaliplatin (OXA) and CPT-11 are the principal anti-colorectal cancer
  drugs. Arrow-headed lines indicate metabolite chemical conversion whereas bar-headed
  lines represent inhibition of chemical process (OXA pathway) or enzymes (5-FU and
  CPT-11 pathways). The anabolic pathways are dark-colored and the catabolic pathways
  are light-colored. Some of therapy resistance biomarkers are indicated in bold.
  5-FU penetrates in tumor cell by nucleoside solute carrier (SLC) transporters such
  as SLC29A1. Then, 5-FU is converted to three main active metabolites: FdUMP, fluorodeoxyuridine
  triphosphate (FdUTP) and fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) which acts as antimetabolites
  and pyrimidine analogues. FdUMP decreases the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides
  by inhibiting TS, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate limiting step in DNA synthesis
  by catalysing the reductive methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to
  deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) using 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF)
  as the methyl donor. By this way, FdUMP inhibits DNA synthesis and repair leading
  to DNA strand breakage and cell death notably by induction of apoptosis. 5-FU is
  also incorporated into DNA (via FdUTP) or RNA (via FUTP), leading to other cytotoxic
  actions including DNA fragmentation and decrease in protein synthesis. LV expands
  the intracellular pool of 5,10-MTHF and increases the toxicity of 5-FU. DPD mediates
  the conversion of 5-FU to non-active dihydrofluorouracil (DHFU). 5-FU catabolism
  also includes efflux of metabolites by ABC transporters such as ABCC11. TS and OPRT
  over-expressions are major molecular mechanism of 5-FU resistance. OXA, a third
  generation of alkylating platinum agent, is transported mainly by organic cation
  (OCT1/2) and copper (CTR1/2) transporters. On the contrary, P-type ATPase (ATP7A/B)
  transporters and ABC transporters promote its efflux. Inside the cell, displacement
  of the labile oxalate and non-enzymatic hydrolysis promotes the conversion of OXA
  in active metabolites such as monoaquo-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DACH) platinum and
  diaquo-DACH platinum. These products alkylate DNA leading to G/G or G/A intra-strand
  crosslinks which, if not repaired, will block both DNA replication and transcription
  leading to apoptosis. Hydrophobicity and bulkiness of the DACH ring prevents the
  MMR proteins from binding to OXA. Excision repair cross-complementation 1 and 2
  (ERCC1/2) and X-ray repair cross complementing 1 (XRCC1) are involved in repair
  of DNA adducts. Cellular detoxification processes include metabolites targeting
  for excretion by conjugation of aquated compounds to cysteine (Cys), methionine
  (Met) or GSH. In particular, conjugation of GSH is catalysed by GST (-mu GSTM1,
  -pi GSTP1 and -theta GSTT1). CPT-11 is transported by SLC transporters such as SLC19A1.
  Inside the cell, CPT-11 is converted into the active SN-38 by carboxylesterases
  1 and 2 (CES1/2). SN-38 binds and stabilizes its target DNA Top1 responsible for
  supercoiled DNA relaxation during replication and transcription. SN-38 inhibits
  the relegation step and the collision of the SN-38/Top1 complex with the moving
  DNA replication fork leads to irreversible arrest of the replication fork and double
  DNA stranded breaks. This damage causes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. CPT-11
  resistance mechanisms include SN-38 glucuronidation in inactive SN-38 glucuronide
  (SN-38G) by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1)
  and overexpression of ABC transmembrane transporters (ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2 and ABCG2)
  responsible for efflux of SN-38. 5-MTHF: 5-methyltetrahydrofolate; Cl-: chlorine;
