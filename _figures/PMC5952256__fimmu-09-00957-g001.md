caption: The mechanism of extracellular vesicles (EVs) release differs among different
  types of EV. Exosomes are secreted via the endosomal pathway, starting with the
  inward invagination of the cell membrane forming an early endosome. In later stages,
  further invagination of the endosome leads to the formation of intraluminal vesicles
  (ILV) and this late endosome is now referred to as a multivesicular body [MVB; Ref.
  (, )]. The MVB can either be targeted for cellular destruction/recycling by lysosomes
  or it may fuse with the cell membrane thus releasing ILV as exosomes. Proteins involved
  in exosomal machinery include the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport
  (ESCRT), tetraspanins (such as CD9), ALG-2-interacting protein X (Alix), and tumor
  susceptibility gene 101 [TSG101; Ref. ()]. Microvesicles (MV) and apoptotic vesicles
  (ApoV) are secreted via the direct outward budding of the cell membrane. Cellular
  activation or apoptosis results in an increased influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) which
  triggers proteases, such as calpain or gelsolin (). These activated proteases lead
  to cytoskeletal disruption. ADP-ribosylation factor-6 (ARF-6) initiates a signaling
  cascade eventually activating the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) signaling
  pathway which in turn activates myosin light-chain (MLC) kinases that activates
  and phosphorylates MLC that would initiate blebbing eventually leading to ApoV/MV
  release (, ). Apoptosis initiation also activates apoptotic enzymes known as caspases.
  Caspase-3 can cleave ROCK transforming it into a constitutive truncated form which
  then enhances the phosphorylation and activation of MLC that leads to ApoV shedding
  (). Caspase-3-mediated blebbing can also act on other blebbing-mediated proteins,
  such as LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) or p21-activated kinase (PAK2); reviewed in
  Ref. ().
