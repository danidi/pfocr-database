caption: Proposing a mechanism for VPA, linking epilepsy and bipolar disorder with
  the phosphoinositide salvage pathway. Phosphoinositide signalling (pink oval) has
  been widely shown to be deregulated in seizures and epilepsy, is regulated by VPA,
  and is dependent upon the salvage pathway involving DAG and DGKs. In addition, protein
  kinase C (PKC) activity is regulated by DAG, and numerous studies have described
  changes in PKC pathway activation in bipolar disorder studies (blue oval), in which
  patients are treated with VPA or lithium. Our data, based on the model system Dictyostelium,
  suggest that loss of the DGK enzyme reduces the effect of both VPA and lithium,
  and reduces DAG levels, and that both compounds (and other potential new epilepsy
  treatments) function to commonly elevate DAG levels. Further pre-clinical and clinical
  studies are therefore needed to investigate DAG and related signalling as a target
  pathway in the treatment of both disorders.
