caption: Intestinal SIRT1 is an important regulator of systemic bile acid homeostasis.
  (A) Deletion of intestinal SIRT1 or hepatic SIRT1 has distinct impacts on systemic
  bile acid homeostasis. Left, deletion of intestinal SIRT1 impairs the transcriptional
  activity of HNF1α, leading to a decreased FXR signaling pathway and thereby reduced
  bile acid absorption in the distal ileum and increased elimination of bile acid
  from feces. The blunted ileal bile acid absorption further feedback increases hepatic
  bile acid synthesis, leading to decreased liver damage under lithogenic condition.
  Right, deletion of hepatic SIRT1 decreases the HNF1α/FXR signaling pathways and
  reduces active biliary excretion of bile acids. Hepatic deletion of SIRT1 also impairs
  hepatic bile acid synthesis, probably through the LXR signaling pathway, further
  reducing biliary bile acid contents. The reduced storage of bile acids in gallbladder
  leads to hypersaturation of biliary cholesterol and formation of cholesterol gallstones.
  Please note that red arrows designate decreased activities whereas green arrows
  designate increased activities. (B) Intestinal SIRT1 regulates ileal bile acid absorption
  and systemic bile acid metabolism through the DCoH2/HNF1α/FXR signaling pathways.
  Our data suggests that deletion of SIRT1 leads to hyperacetylation of DCoH2, which
  in turn results in decreased dimerization and DNA binding of HNF1α as well as reduced
  the transcription levels of HNF1α downstream genes such as FXR and Asbt.
