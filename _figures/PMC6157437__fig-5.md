caption: Activating (pink) and inhibiting (blue) effects of Prxs on carcinogenesis
  depend on cell type and the interplay between different pathways. In breast cancer
  cells, Prx1 protects PTEN phosphatase from oxidation and thus inactivation; PTEN
  in turn controls Akt activation and suppresses tumor development (). In lung cancer
  cells, Prx1 suppresses activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/cyclin
  D1 pathway by inhibiting phosphorylation of ERK (). In hepatocytes, both Prx1 and
  Prx2 induce activation of ERK, and Prx1 also increases Nrf2 signaling (, ). The
  activity of ERK is controlled through the status of specific tyrosine and threonine
  residues that can be phosphorylated by MEK1/2 kinases or dephosphorylated by MAP
  kinase phosphatases MKP1/DUSP1 (). Prxs may affect different targets in different
  tissues, and thus have opposite effects on activation of the ERK/cyclin D1 or Nrf2
  pathways, ultimately promoting either cell proliferation or cell death. Nrf2, nuclear
  erythroid 2-related factor 2. To see this illustration in color, the reader is referred
