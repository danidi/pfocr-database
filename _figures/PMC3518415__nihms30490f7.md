caption: Diagram depicting the relationship between clusterin, the intrinsic and extrinsic
  apoptotic cascades, and histone deacetylases. We have shown that clusterin co-localizes
  with mitochondria and suppresses cytochrome c release, which triggers apoptosis.
  Clusterin is regulated by the proteasome, although it is unclear if this regulation
  is direct. The clusterin-mediated inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway
  can be bypassed by activation of the extrinsic pathway, although the precise mechanism
  through which histone deacetylases perform this function is not known.
