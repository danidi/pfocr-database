caption: 'Predicted flow of [1-13C]xylose tracer into the metabolic products of xylose
  fermentation either by the pentose-phosphate pathway or phosphoketolase pathway.
  Numbers represent the corresponding enzymes that catalyze the particular step as
  follows: 1, xylose isomerase; 2, xylulose kinase; 3, phosphoketolase (phosphoketolase
  produces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and acetyl phosphate that is converted to acetate
  and ATP by acetate kinase with ADP); 4, enzymes of glycolysis (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerokinase, enolase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase);
  5, enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway (phosphopentose epimerase, phosphopentose
  isomerase, transketolase, and transaldolase); 6, same enzymes as step 4 with phosphofructokinase,
  aldolase, and triose phosphate isomerase; 7, lactate dehydrogenase.'
