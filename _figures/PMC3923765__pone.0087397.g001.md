caption: BiNA's KEGG visual style provides layouts of the pathways which are very
  similar to the KEGG maps. Additionally, BiNA supports filtering of organism-unspecific
  parts of a pathway, which improves the readability. In this figure, we manually
  removed disconnected reactions from BiNA's pathway. Furthermore, neighbored pathways
  can be directly explored and shown in the same visualization, which clearly supports
  the biological understanding of relationships across borders of canonical pathways
  (not shown).
