caption: Biogenesis and function of miRNA in cancer cells. Pre miRNAs are produced
  in the nucleus through canonical and mirton's pathway. Dicer processes pre miRNAs
  as they enter the cytoplasm via active exportin 5. miRNA-induced silencing complex
  (miRISC) is formed by integration of argonaute family proteins that act as guides
  and allow recognition of the complementary sequences in target mRNA. miRISC subsequently
  inhibits the translation of target mRNA or degrades the target mRNA. Various miRNAs
  can function as tumor suppressors or oncomiRs.
