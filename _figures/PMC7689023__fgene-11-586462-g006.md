caption: Mode of action of ethylene during panicle development and grain filling.
  The model summarizes the role of ethylene-related factors (pink hexagons) in the
  regulation of panicle development and grain filling. Inferior spikelets accumulate
  ethylene by promoting its biosynthesis. Polyamines compete and reroute ethylene
  metabolism, thus antagonizing the ethylene response. Meristem transition determination
  by FZP greatly affects the branching potential of panicles. FZP interacts with BR
  and auxin pathway components. OsEATB coordinately with GA affects the tillering
  and panicle branching. PA, polyamines; D-SAM, decarboxylated SAM; SAMDC, SAM decarboxylase.
  Arrows represent positive regulation; bar-headed lines represent negative regulation.
