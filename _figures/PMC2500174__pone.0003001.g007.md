caption: Chemicals and siRNAs used in the study are highlighted in red and asterisks,
  respectively. Dotted lines indicate potential mechanistic interactions within or
  between the cell-integrity and self-renewal pathways, although further investigations
  are required to address these possibilities. Arrows denote activation and bars indicate
  inhibition.
