caption: Model for erythropoietic regulation by an iron-aconitase-isocitrate pathway.
  In the absence of iron restriction (A; > 15% Transferrin Saturation) aconitase enzymes
  possess intact iron-sulfur clusters and function mainly in the conversion of citrate
  to isocitrate by the Metabolic Flux Pathway. In the presence of iron restriction
  (B; 15% Transferrin Saturation), destabilization of the aconitase iron-sulfur clusters
  induces assembly of a repressive signalosome which may act in part through PKC hyperactivation.
  In addition, diminished metabolic flux may compromise heme production and lead to
  shunting of citrate by activated ATP-citrate-lyase (P-ACL) to oxaloacetate (OAA)
  and acetyl-CoA. Isocitrate rescue (C; 15% Transferrin Saturation with Exogenous
  Isocitrate) may prevent assembly of a repressive signalosome by stabilization of
  aconitase iron-sulfur clusters and by binding to isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
  enzymes. In addition, exogenous D- but not L-isocitrate may support heme biosynthesis.
  However, exogenous isocitrate does not prevent shunting of citrate by activated
  ATP-citrate-lyase.
