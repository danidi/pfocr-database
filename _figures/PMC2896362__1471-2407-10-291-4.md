caption: Differentially expressed proteins for BT474 cell line were analyzed using
  a manually curated structured network tool (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis). A) Network
  ID 1 (p-value < 10-37) with function associated with cancer, B) Network ID 2 (p-value
  < 10-22) with function associated with cell morphology. White nodes are proteins
  identified by IPA, grey nodes are proteins identified by IPA and 2-DE, blue node
  is identified by IPA and validated by immunoblotting, and red node is identified
  by IPA and 2-DE, and confirmed by immunoblotting.
