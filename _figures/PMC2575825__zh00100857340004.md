caption: 'Glutathionine (GSH) redox network. A partial list of GSH-dependent proteins
  illustrates the need for research to understand the integrated function of these
  redox systems. 1) GSH is synthesized by a two-step pathway in which abundance of
  two enzymes, glutamate cysteine ligase (GSH0, GSH1) and GSH synthetase (GSHB), determine
  synthesis rate (). GSH is degraded by γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) at the surface
  of the brush border of the kidney, small intestine, and a number of other tissues,
  and probably also in the cisternae of the secretory pathway (). 2) GSH is transported
  out of cells by several multidrug resistance proteins (MRP) (). The chloride channel,
  which is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CFTR), also transports GSH (), and GSH is transported
  into mitochondria by the dicarboxylate carrier (DIC) and a monocarboxylate carrier
  (OGCP) (). GSH is transported into the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum (),
  but the molecular nature of the transporter is not known. 3) GSH is used by a number
  of GSH transferases (GST), which include microsomal and nonmicrosomal locations,
  to modify electrophilic chemicals (). These are thought to largely function in detoxification,
  but some also act on biosynthetic intermediates for prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
  A fraction of GSH is present as S-nitroso-GSH, a transnitrosylating agent generated
  from nitric oxide or its metabolites (). 4) GSH functions in metabolism as a coenzyme
  for formaldehyde dehydrogenase, glyoxylase, and other metabolic reactions (, ).
  In these reactions, GSH is cyclically removed by one reaction and regenerated in
  a second reaction. 5) Several thiol transferases, also known as glutaredoxins, catalyze
  introduction and removal of GSH (, ). 5a) Several proteins are regulated by GS-ylation,
  and many others undergo GS-ylation under oxidative stress conditions (, ). 6) GSH
  is used as a reductant for selenium-dependent GSH peroxidases (GPX) and selenium-independent
  peroxiredoxin-6 (PRX6) and some GSH transferases (GST). 6a) The product of these
  oxidative reactions, GSSG, is reduced back to GSH by GSSG reductase (GSHR) in most
  tissues. In sperm, thioredoxin reductase-3 (TRXR3) has activity toward both Trx
  and GSH. The proteins included in this figure are present in multiple cellular compartments
  and are differentially expressed in cells so that development of functional maps
  will require tissue-specific measurements of individual reaction rates. Protein
