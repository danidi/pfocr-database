caption: C. sakazakii–stimulated mammalian mammary gland epithelium induced apoptosis
  via activating AIM2 pathway and excessive ER stress response. E. sakazakii was isolated
  from bovine mastitis milk sample, which was used to infected mice and BMECs. E.
  sakazakii–infected mammary gland epithelium activated AIM2 inflammasome and induced
  excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress response. However, there has been no evidence
  to support the relationship between AIM2 inflammasome activation and endoplasmic
  reticulum stress. Finally, apoptosis occurred in mammary epithelial cells
