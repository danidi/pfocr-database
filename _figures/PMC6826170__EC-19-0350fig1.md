caption: Overview of insulin regulation on intrahepatic pathways in the postprandial
  state in healthy (A) and individuals with NAFLD or defined as insulin resistant
  (B). In the fasting state non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) from the lipolysis of
  subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue enter the liver and mix with fatty acids
  (FAs) from the cytosolic triacylglycerol (TAG) storage pool and those from de novo
  lipogenesis (DNL). FAs are then preferentially partitioned toward the oxidation
  pathway where the acetyl Co-A produced can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle to
  produce CO2 or ketogenic pathway, where the ketone bodies 3-hydroxybutyrate and
  acetoacetate are produced. FAs are also esterified to TAG and utilised in the production
  of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles. In the transition to the postprandial
  state, and after consumption of a mixed meal, FAs from the diet also enter the liver
  and mix with endogenous sources. The postprandial increase in plasma insulin concentrations
  suppresses adipose tissue lipolysis, decreasing the flux of NEFA to the liver. Within
  the liver, insulin upregulates the DNL pathway, leading to suppression in FA oxidation,
  VLDL production and secretion, and gluconeogenesis. Thus, during the postprandial
  period, cellular metabolism rapidly shifts away from energy supply to energy storage
  (A) and back again. In individuals with an ‘unhealthy’ phenotype (e.g. NAFLD, insulin
  resistance) the postprandial increase in plasma insulin concentrations will not
  suppress adipose tissue lipolysis to the same extent as in a ‘healthy’ individual,
  leading to a higher flux of NEFA to the intrahepatic FA pool. Within the liver,
  insulin will further upregulate the DNL pathway, leading to a greater contribution
  of FA to the FA pool, FA oxidation will be suppressed, and ceramide production may
  be increased, whilst VLDL production and secretion and gluconeogenesis are not attenuated.
  During the postprandial period in these individuals FAs will partitioned toward
  esterification pathways and utilised in the production of VLDL particles or stored
  in the cytosolic TAG storage pool rather than entering oxidation pathways (B).
