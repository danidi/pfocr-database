caption: A partial list of AMPK targets. A. AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl
  CoA carboxylase 1 and 2 (ACC1 and ACC2), resulting in decreased fatty acid synthesis
  and increased fatty acid oxidation, respectively (). CPT1, carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1. B. AMPK phosphorylates CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2). Phosphorylation
  sequesters the coactivator to the cytoplasm, ultimately down-regulating gluconeogenesis
  (; ). The graphical portrayal of this pathway varies, with some authors depicting
  phosphorylation of CRTC2 by AMPK prior to nuclear export; others depict only cytoplasmic
  phosphorylation (; ).
