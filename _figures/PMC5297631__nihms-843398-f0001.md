caption: a | An example of the extrinsic pathway is depicted, wherein binding of FasL
  to its cognate death receptor Fas facilitates the recruitment of FADD. FADD then
  recruits the inactive form of caspase 8, the aggregation and homodimerization of
  which result in its autocatalysis and/or activation. This step induces the degradative
  phase of apoptosis through the activation of caspase 3 and caspase 7, which are
  coordinators of downstream apoptotic cellular processes. FLIP, a catalytically inactive
  homolog of caspase 8, acts as an endogenous regulator of the Fas pathway at the
  level of caspase 8 activation. FLIP is recruited by FADD upon Fas activation and
  can either inhibit or potentiate the binding of FADD and caspase 8, depending on
  its concentration. b | An alternative pathway of Fas-induced cell death involves
  crosstalk between the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This crosstalk
  is mediated by the activation of the Bcl2 pro-apoptotic protein BID, which is cleaved
  by caspase 8 following Fas ligation. c | The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis is regulated
  by the Bcl2 protein family, which comprise both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic
  members. The pro-apoptotic family includes multi-Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain proteins
  and BH3-only domain proteins. One view is that the BH3-only proteins either activate
  the multi-BH pro-apoptotic proteins or sequester Bcl2 anti-apoptotic proteins to
  induce apoptosis. Alternatively, Bcl2 pro-apoptotic proteins bind and prevent the
  BH3-only domain proteins from activating the apoptotic cascade. Nevertheless, once
  the apoptotic signalling is initiated, BAK and BAX form homodimers and heterodimers
  at the mitochondrial outer membrane, causing the release of inner mitochondrial
  proteins such as Cytochrome c. Subsequently, Cytochrome c binds to APAF-1 and caspase
  9 forming the apoptosome, which activates caspase 3 and caspase 7.
