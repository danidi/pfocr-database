caption: Fungal cell wall pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and their
  host-pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Various fungal cell wall components are
  recognized by specific PRRs. Some PAMPs are recognized by multiple PRRs; for example,
  N-linked mannan is recognized by mannan receptor (MR), dectin-2, and FcγR [, ].
  Phospholipomannan-(PLM-) coated β-glucans are recognized by both TLR-6 and TLR-2
  [, ]. Other receptors may involve the signaling pathway of another PRR. For example,
  galectin-3, which recognizes β-mannosides, signals through TLR-2 (represented by
  a curved arrow) [, ] dectin-1, when activated by β-glucans can signal to activate
  the nuclear factor kappa-lightchain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) on its
  own or with the help of TLR-2 [, ]. Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) may signal through
  dectin-2 when activated by N-linked mannan [, , , ]. Recognition of these fungal
  cell wall components mediates fungal recognition and defense by the host. Recognition
  by host PRRs usually involves signaling through NF-κB and activation of proinflammatory
  cytokines, such as TNF-α, or in some instances, and anti-inflammatory cytokines
  such as interleukin (IL)-10 []. The possibility of an alternative chitin receptor
  exists, activation of which leads to the recruitment of IL-4 producing cells [,
  ]. However, chitin has been shown to function as a T helper (Th)1 immune modulator,
  which stands in contrast an IL-4 associated Th2 response [–].
