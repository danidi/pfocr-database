caption: 'The major biosynthetic pathways of plant C18 unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs)
  (based on ; ). After 18:1 is synthesized de novo in plastids, the generation of
  18:2 and 18:3 is coupled to that of membrane glycerolipids, which is conducted in
  two pathways: the ‘prokaryotic pathway’ in plastids, and the ‘eukaryotic pathway’
  in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as marked in green and yellow, respectively.
  To illustrate the acyl editing way of 18:1 incorporation (distinguished from the
  de novo way with darker color), PC(18:2, 18:2) is used as an example substrate.
  Nascent FAs are largely channeled to the acyl editing way, whereas those exchanged
  instead enter the de novo way of eukaryotic glycolipid synthesis. The three C18
  UFAs and the corresponding fatty acid desaturases (FADs) and reactions are shown
  in different colors. The dotted arrows denote that trafficking between the plastid
  and the ER is involved. Prokaryotic glycolipid synthesis is only present in ‘16:3
  plants’ characterized by MGDG(18:3, 16:3), as indicated by shading. PA and PG of
