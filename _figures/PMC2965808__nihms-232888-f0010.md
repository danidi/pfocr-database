caption: Schematic presentation of a possible mechanism by which GTPP potentiates
  NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. In this study, we have demonstrated therole of TrkA,
  ERK and ROS in the GTPP potentiation of NGF action by using appropriate blocking
  agents. Our hypothesis is that under basal conditions TrkA is phosphorylated at
  its tyrosine residues, but a phosphotyrosine protein phosphatase deposphorylates
  TrkA and inhibits its activation and subsequent downstream signaling. GTPP, via
  ROS generation, inactivates this phosphatase and increases the phosphorylation of
  TrkA and subsequent activation of ERK. A lack of further increase in NGF-induced
  ERK activation by GTPP suggests that additional pathways, regulated either by GTPP
  directly or by ROS generated by GTPP, may complement the ERK pathway to increase
  the expression of neuronal marker genes and potentiate NGF-induced neuritogenesis.
