caption: Proposed model. Hemin triggers TLR4 on human monocyte derived dendritic cells
  (moDCs), which leads to inhibition of NF-κB and downstream CD83 in non-alloimmunized
  sickle cell disease (SCD) patients. On the other hand, this signaling pathway is
  defective in alloimmunized patients, thereby preventing the inhibition of NF-κB
  and CD83. Hemin-exposed moDCs derived from non-alloimmunized patients (CD83low)
  prime naïve T cell to produce lower levels of IFNg than when derived from alloimmunized
  patients (CD83high). This pathway could, therefore, represent a mechanism by which
  enhanced inflammation is induced and/or maintained in alloimmunized patients.
