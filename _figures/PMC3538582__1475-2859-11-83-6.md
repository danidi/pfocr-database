caption: Glutamate family biosynthetic pathway behaviour under different oxygen conditions.
  The metabolite levels bars in the graphs are the average and the standard error
  from at least 4 measurements. The control and the Fab-expressing strain are represented
  by black-grey and yellow bars, respectively. Oxygenation conditions from normoxic
  to oxygen-limited conditions are represented as light to dark color scale. The mRNA
  data are indicated as m plus the specific reaction name. Each graph has its own
  scale.
