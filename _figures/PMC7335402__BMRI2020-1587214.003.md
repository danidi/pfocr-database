caption: A relevant biological network containing the DPTs and their associated genes
  () was constructed using Cytoscape version 3.8.0. The major associated-genes, namely,
  GABARAP, NSF, DNM1, GABARAPL2, UBQLN1, TRAK2, GABARAPL1, GLRA2, CLCN2, GLRB, GPHN,
  GLRA3, and CLIC2, were shown to heavily interact with DPTs (). As shown in , 13
  genes, namely, NSF (24 PPIs), CAMK2G (9 PPIs), ATP2B1 (3 PPIs), ATP2B2 (10 PPIs),
  GRIA2 (29 PPIs), BDNF (12 PPIs), ATP2B4 (6 PPIs), GPHN (26 PPIs), GABARAPL1 (20
  PPIs), TRAK2 (15 PPIs), CREB1 (8 PPIs), STIM1 (5PPIs), and GABARAPL2 (19 PPIs),
  were involved in the GABAergic synapse, cAMP signaling pathways, and calcium signaling
  pathway. These 13 candidate genes were searched in GeneCards one by one. Further
  analysis revealed that GABARAPL1 and 2 were involved in the autophagy pathway. Autophagy
  is believed to protect against neurodegeneration []. Besides, GABARAPL1 and 2 were
  identified to be the major targets of sevoflurane-associated DPTs in the subnetwork
  shown in . Thus, GABARAPL1 and 2 were selected for further investigation ().
