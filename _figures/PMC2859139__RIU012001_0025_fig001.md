caption: Immunoregulatory pathways. Proapoptotic stimuli (radiation, chemotherapy)
  trigger apoptosis of tumor cells and phagocytosis by antigen-presenting dendritic
  cells (DCs). Tumor-associated antigens (TAA) are processed and presented by major
  histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on the DC surface to naïve CD4}+
  thelper T cells (TH0). A subset of peptides is also delivered into the cytoplasm
  of DCs and “cross-presented” by MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells. If the DCs
  are sufficiently activated, they upregulate costimulatory B7 (CD80, CD86) and the
  CD40 receptor. If a cognate T cell exists, it is activated by the combination of
  MHC-peptide and costimulation, leading to upregulation of CD40L, which provides
  a retrograde signal for optimum activation of DCs. Fully activated or “licensed”
  DCs make TH1 polarizing cytokines, like interleukin (IL)-12, which drive differentiation
  to the TH1 cytokine-producing pathway. Subsequently, activated DCs can activate
  TAA-specific CD8+ T cells, which proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic T
  lymphocytes. Insufficient DC activation can lead to polarization of helper TH2 cells
  (which favors humoral immunity, ie, B cells) and expansion of inhibitory regulatory
  Treg cells. IFN, interferon; TGF, transforming growth factor.
