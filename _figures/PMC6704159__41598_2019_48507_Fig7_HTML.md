caption: 'Model of the cooperation between M and P proteins to inhibit different Jak-Stat-pathway
  steps. (A) At infection onset, before the IFN response is triggered and IFNα binds
  to its receptor (IFNR), JAK1 and STAT1 are not phosphorylated. Then, both RABV M
  (red) and P (purple) proteins can interact with JAK1, although M-STAT is favoured.
  Only the mutant 2P (pink) but not 4M (orange) interact with JAK1 (phosphorylated
  or not). (B) In the presence of IFNα, JAK1 is phosphorylated which lead to the phosphorylation
  of STAT1 and translocation in the nucleus of STAT phosphorylated dimers and finally
  activation of ISRE promotors and increase of transcription of corresponding genes
  (ex: ISG15, MxA, IFNβ1 and Tyk2). This is inhibited in the context of a RABV infection
  by both M and P proteins. Neither the mutant 2P nor 4M are able to interact with
  STAT1 (phosphorylated or not). Less than 30 min after IFN stimulation (1), the M
  protein blocked JAK1 phosphorylation and then STAT1 phosphorylation. 30 min after
  the initial stimulation (2), P destabilises M-JAK1 and the M protein switches towards
  pSTAT1 interaction, which then enhances the capacity of P protein to also switch
  towards pSTAT1 interaction and inhibit the translocation of phosphorylated STAT
  dimers. (C) Several hours later, P and M proteins tend to interact preferentially
  with JAK1, although the initially high P/JAK1 levels were never again reached.'
