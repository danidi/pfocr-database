caption: Model for hypoxia-induced signaling. During normoxia (white area), activity
  of NOS presumably generates a pool of NO, possibly nitrite, which is stored in the
  mitochondria. During shortfalls of oxygen (hypoxia, shaded area), this pool gets
  converted back to NO. NO is present in the cytoplasm as GSNO. In the cytoplasm,
  generation of cGMP through sGC subsequently activates cGMP-dependent channels, resulting
  in mobilization of calcium through these channels. The two most novel steps in this
  proposed pathway are the production of NO by mitochondrial reduction and the activation
  of sGC by GSNO. The reductive production of NO by the mitochondrial has been documented
  in other contexts (; ). The activation of sGC by GSNO is suggested by our data and
  a recently recognized diversity in the mechanisms regulating sGCs leads us to suggest
  an activating input by transnitrosylation (see Discussion). Activation of this signaling
  pathway may allow adaptation to conditions of hypoxia. The signaling pathway as
  delineated in this article was defined by our data using S2 cells.
