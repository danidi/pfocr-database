caption: 'Potential targets of glucose metabolism for anticancer therapy. Blocking
  glucose metabolism serves to inhibit both a major energy source for cancer cells,
  as well as a major source of reducing equivalents (e.g. NADPH). The major glucose
  metabolic pathways, and potential drug strategies to target them are shown. Drugs
  are shown in bold. Abbreviations: HK, hexokinase; 2-DG, 2-deoxyglucose; LND, lonidamide;
  G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6-AN, 6-aminonicotinamide; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase;
  3-BrPA, 3-bromopyruvate; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; TCA cycle, tricarboxyclic
  acid cycle.'
