caption: 'The actions of IL-21 on T cells are context-dependent and shaped by cellular
  and environmental parameters. IL-21 signals are interpreted and integrated via a
  network that includes STAT, MAPK, and PI3K-AKT transduction pathways. STAT proteins
  are central constituents of this network, and a wide array of cytokines including
  IL-6, IL-10, IL-2, IL-7 as well as IL-15 activate overlapping and distinct STAT
  proteins that cooperate with, counteract, or compensate for IL-21. Suppressor of
  cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins, which attenuate STAT activation also provide
  an additional level of regulation. IL-21 may integrate with TCR-signals via the
  PI3K-AKT pathway which can culminate in the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR), which is also sensitive to nutrient levels and plays important roles in
  T cell metabolism and differentiation. In addition, mTOR has been shown in CD8 T
  cells to promote the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which
  is necessary for STAT3 binding to many of its target sties. IL-21 can also promote
  proliferative responses by activation of MAPK. Thus, antigenic signals, other cytokines,
  and the metabolic status of the responding cell all likely contribute to the eventual
  outcome of IL-21 signaling. Finally, the epigenetic profiles of target genes and
  the binding of transcriptional regulators may mutually influence each other, adding
  to the cell-type dependent control of the magnitude and patterns of gene expression
  that dictate the differentiation, plasticity, and survival of the responding cells.
