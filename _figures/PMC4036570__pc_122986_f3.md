caption: Metabolic Analysis of Wax, Cutin, Total Free Soluble Lipid, , and  in Wild-Type
  and ams Buds.The wax, cutin, and total soluble lipid amounts expressed as dry weight
  (μg/mg) in the wild type and ams flower buds. The  and  amounts relative to standard
  substance content in each of 100 buds. Error bars indicate sd (n = 5). Some genes
  (shown in blue on pathway) had been reported as being involved in these metabolic
  processes; these genes are down in ams, which lead to changes of the corresponding
  compounds.[See online article for color version of this figure.]
