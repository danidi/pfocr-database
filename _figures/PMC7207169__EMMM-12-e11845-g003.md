caption: In MYC‐hyperactivated tumors, IRE1α‐XBP1s signaling and MYC likely engage
  in a positive feedback loop, as XBP1s transcriptionally upregulates MYC while c‐Myc
  directly induces ERN1 (encoding IRE1α) and XBP1 expression. c‐Myc also physically
  interacts with XBP1s and enhances its transcriptional activity. MYC is further shown
  to contribute to IRE1α protein stability via unknown mechanisms (denoted as dashed
  line). Red arrows indicate direct transcriptional regulation between MYC and IRE1α
  arm.
