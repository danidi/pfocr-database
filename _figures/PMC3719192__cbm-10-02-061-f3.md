caption: 'Wnt canonical pathway. (A) In the absence of a Wnt ligand, the cytoplasmic
  β-catenin is degraded by the “destruction complex”, which contains adeomatous polyposis
  coli (APC) and axin, glycogen synthase 3β (GSK-3β) and casein kinase 1α (CK1α) phosphorylated
  β-catenin. Accordingly, phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by β-TrCP and constantly
  degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; (B) The binding of WNTs, such as WNT3A
  and WNT1, to frizzled (FZD) and LRP5 or LRP6 co-receptors transduces a signal across
  the plasma membrane that results in the activation of the Dishevelled (DVL) protein.
  Activation of Dvl induces the dissociation of GSK-3β from Axin and leads to the
  inhibition of GSK-3β. This results in the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm
  and ultimately the nucleus where it displaces cyclic AMP response element-binding
  protein (CBP) β-catenin and facilitates transcriptional actiation of lymphocyte
  enhancer binding actor (LEF)/T cell factor (TCF) resulting in altered gene transcription.
  Ultimately, Wnt canonical pathway modulates changes in cell behaviours such as proliferation,
  survival and differentiation. DKK: dickkopf homologue; NRX: nucleoredoxin; R-spon1:
