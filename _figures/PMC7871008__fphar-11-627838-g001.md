caption: 'Scheme: Putative mechanism(s) of signal transduction of cardiac A2A-adenosine
  receptors (A2a-ARs). A2a-ARs via stimulatory G-proteins (Gs) can activate adenylyl
  cyclase (AC) which would enhance the 3′-5′cyclic adenosine-phosphate (cAMP)-levels
  in compartments of the cardiomyocyte and activate cAMP-dependent protein kinases
  (PKA) which would increase the phosphorylation state and thereby the activity of
  various regulatory proteins in the cell. Moreover, phosphorylation state and thus
  the activity of ERK1/2, JNK, p38 and CREB could be enhanced by pathways via arrestins.
  PKA-stimulated phosphorylation might also increase the current through the L-type
  Ca2+ channel (LTCC) and/or release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)
  via the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RYR2); both processes would increase force of
  contraction by increasing the Ca2+ acting on myofilaments. In diastole, Ca2+ is
  pumped via the SR-Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) from the cytosol into the SR. Activity of
  SERCA is increased by phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB). The latter effect
  might also follow from inhibition of PP2A (a serine/threonine phosphatase: PP) activity
  by MAP kinases and subsequent increased phosphorylation state and thus activation
  of I-1 (a specific inhibitory protein of PP1) which will lead to decreased activity
  of PP1. Reduced activity of PP2A (and/or PP1) can increase phosphorylation of additional
  proteins and might thus increase the Ca2+ -sensitivity of myofilaments by dephosphorylation
  of the myosin light chains in the myofilaments which would increase force of contraction.
  Thus, A2A-ARs might increase the Ca2+ -sensitivity of myofilaments. In addition,
  cardiac A2A-ARs might act via the non-canonical pathway of β-arrestin, via α-actinin,
  via the Arf nucleotide site opener/cytohesin-2, ubiquitin-specific processing protease,
  translin-associated protein-X and neuronal calcium-binding protein 2.'
