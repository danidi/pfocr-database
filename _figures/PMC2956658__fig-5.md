caption: A model of ip-10 induction by interferon (IFN)-γ. Solid lines represent known
  pathways; for example, IRF1 induction by IFN-γ (requiring Stat1) and subsequent
  IRF1 binding to the IFN-stimulated regulatory element (ISRE) of ip-10. Dashed lines
  represent pathways revealed by the present work. The pathway connecting the IFN-γ
  receptor to IKK-β is unknown, as are the pathways connecting IKK-β to IRF1 and p65.
  IRF1 and p65 may interact with one another when bound to the ip-10 promoter.
