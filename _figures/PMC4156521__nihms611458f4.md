caption: MiR-696 is downregulated with exercise and motor nerve activity, which leads
  to an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1
  (PGC-1), a potent transcriptional coactivator that regulates genes involved in energy
  metabolism. PGC-1 increases Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef-2) and nuclear respiratory
  factor (NRF), leading to increased type I myofiber formation and mitochondrial biogenesis/oxidative
  metabolism, respectively. The miR-696 pathway interacts with the previously described
  miR-133a pathway by way of Mef-2.
