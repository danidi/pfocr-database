caption: In DLD1 cells, active KRAS stabilizes RasGAP expression, which in turn binds
  to and stabilizes RhoGAP phosphorylation. This complex then activates Rho pathway
  activation, either by sequestration of RhoGAP away from Rho, or by increasing Rho
  turnover. In DKO4 cells, RasGAP is not expressed, due in part to a truncating mutation
  and in part to lack of expression downstream of active KRAS. In this situation,
  RhoGAP is not phosphorylated, and so Rho pathway phenotypes are inactive. When RasGAP
  is overexpressed in DKO4, RhoGAP is once again phosphorylated and Rho pathway is
  active- however, lack of stabilization and/or contributing signaling pathways from
  active RAS means that tumorigenicity does not attain the same level as DLD1. The
  bottom of the figure summarizes the main characteristics of RhoGAP and RasGAP in
  these cell lines.
