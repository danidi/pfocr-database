caption: An intriguing step in the sphingolipid pathway, illustrated in , is the ceramidase
  reaction which results in deacylation of ceramide to form sphingosine and free fatty
  acid. From a metabolic standpoint, the ability of ceramidase to directly regulate
  ceramide (substrate) and sphingosine (product) is critical in several cellular processes,
  including proliferation, cell cycle arrest, differentiation, death, and motility.
  On a larger scale, ceramidases indirectly regulate other bioactive lipids namely
  gucosylceramide, C1P and S1P. Here we shall review the biochemical properties of
  acid ceramidase, recent advances in understanding the role of AC in cancer biology
  and the potential for targeting AC in cancer therapy.
