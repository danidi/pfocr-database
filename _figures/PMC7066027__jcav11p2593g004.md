caption: 'The roles of miR-30c family members in carcinogenesis, metastasis and invasion.
  Note: miR-30c promotes cancer progression through the activation of KRAS/MAPK signal
  pathway, and miR-30c family members act as caner suppressors by targeting TWF1 (Twinfilin
  actin binding protein 1)-IL-11-STAT3 pathway. Moreover, cancer metastasis and invasion
  were inhibited by the decreased EMT process caused by the down-expression leves
  ofMTDH(Metadherin) and VIM (Vimentin) via the specific bindings of miR-30c, respectively.'
