caption: A possible model for FT/TSF-mediated stomatal opening. The photoperiodic
  pathway is shown with representative components. The blue light signaling pathway
  between phototropins and the H+-ATPase is shown with a blue arrow. Arrows and T-bars
  indicate positive and negative regulation, respectively. Dotted arrows represent
  input and output of the circadian clock. Gene names in red represent components
  that were directly analyzed in this study. ELF3 and FT were described previously
  (). TFs represents transcription factors working downstream of FT and TSF, such
  as an AP1. Gray lines indicate regulatory mechanisms that are reported in previous
  works. White arrows show a contribution to stomatal opening, and the thickness of
  the arrows represents the possible degree of the contribution (for details, see
  text).
