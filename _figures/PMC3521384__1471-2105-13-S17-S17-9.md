caption: (a) Path extracted from MRSD, (b) Path extracted from NEAT, (c) Path extracted
  from CMPFdynamic. The dotted edge represents additional reactions not shown in the
  same pathway. The width of the edge represents the number of reactions within the
  same pathway. A pathway trace is a sequence of pathways activated in a linear metabolic
  path represented by colored boxes.
