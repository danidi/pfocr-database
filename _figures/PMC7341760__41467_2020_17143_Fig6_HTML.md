caption: The green-highlighted part is the original model; the pink-highlighted part
  is the branched pathway promoted by OM. Myosin catalytic domain is green for the
  motors without OM (M) and magenta and brown for the OM-bound motors (MOM) before
  and after the isomerization step (step 11), respectively. The working stroke in
  the attached head is indicated by the tilting of the light chain domain (the lever
  arm, blue) towards the Z-line. The system of linear differential equation for the
  calculation of state transitions is reported in Supplementary Note .
