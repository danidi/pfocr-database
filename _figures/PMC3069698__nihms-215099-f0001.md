caption: After DNA damage, the Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR)
  activates FA core complex (FANCA/B/C/E/F/G/L/M). The FA core complex then functions
  as an E3 ubiquitin ligase and monoubiquitinates FANCD2 and FANCI. The Monoubiquitinated
  FANCD2/FANCI complex is then targeted to chromatin where it forms complex with additional
  FA proteins and other DNA repair proteins. The USP1 and UAF1 protein complex then
  deubiquitinates FANCD2/FANCI complex, allowing their release from chromatin. USP1
  is also required for localization of FANCD2/FANCI into DNA repair foci.
