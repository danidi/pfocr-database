caption: Fc-mediated functions of anti-TfR1 antibodies. The simultaneous binding of
  an antibody, such as IgG1, to TfR1 on the surface of the cancer cell and the FcγRs
  on the surface of effector cells through the Fc region may induce cell death through
  ADCC and/or ADCP. This interaction may also potentially sequester TfR1 on the surface
  of the cell, inhibiting its internalization. Antibodies bound to apoptotic cells
  or apoptotic bodies are also expected to trigger phagocytosis. Additionally, binding
  of the antibody to the antigen on the surface of the cancer and to C1q, the first
  component of the classical complement pathway, through the antibody Fc region may
  also lead to cell lysis through CDC.
