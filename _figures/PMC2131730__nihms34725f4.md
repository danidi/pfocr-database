caption: 'LPS signals the TLR4 pathway on an APC (i.e., monocyte or dendritic cell).
  TLR4 is a pathogen-associated receptor for Gram-negative bacterial product LPS.TLR4
  requires MD-2, a secreted molecule, to functionally interact with the LPS:LPS binding
  protein complex (LPB). CD14 stabilizes and enhances LPS signaling. TLR4 engagement
  of LPS leads to nuclear factor-κB translocation via MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent
  pathway that involve the TIR domain–ontaining adapter protein TIRAP. Adapted by
