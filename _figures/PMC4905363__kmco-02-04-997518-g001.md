caption: 'MKP1-mediated survival pathway. HER2-mediated activation of ERK results
  in the phosphorylation and activation of MKP1. PhosphoMKP1 then translocates into
  the mitochondria to dephosphorylate and inactivate JNK, resulting in the inhibition
  of apoptosis and, therefore, enhanced survival. ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase;
  HER2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; JNK, Jun NH-terminal kinase; MKP1,
  mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1. Ras–Raf–MEK are mitogen-activated
  protein kinase signaling cascade proteins: Ras, Rat sarcoma; Raf, rapidly accelerated
  fibrosarcoma; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase.'
