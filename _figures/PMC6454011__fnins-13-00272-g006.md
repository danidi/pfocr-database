caption: Schematic diagram showing how Oridonin ameliorates experimental autoimmune
  neuritis by promoting anti-inflammatory macrophages through blocking Notch pathway.
  Oridonin exhibits efficient anti-inflammatory activity and induced a switch in macrophage
  polarization to the anti-inflammatory phenotype through inhibition of the Notch
  pathway in our in vitro study. Further in the EAN rats, Oridonin significantly reduced
  neuropathic pain, demyelination, inflammatory cellular accumulations and inflammatory
  cytokines in peripheral nerves, effectively suppressed disease progression by attenuating
  local inflammatory reaction and increasing the proportion of immune regulating macrophages,
  possibly through blockage of the Notch pathway.
