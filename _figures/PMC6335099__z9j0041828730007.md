caption: Blood-brain barrier breakdown and dysfunction in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease.
  Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) has shown blood-brain
  barrier (BBB) breakdown in the hippocampus in individuals with mild cognitive impairment
  (MCI) and in different gray and white matter regions in early Alzheimer’s disease
  (AD), before brain atrophy and dementia occur. Microbleeds reflecting loss of cerebrovascular
  integrity and BBB breakdown have been shown by T2*-MRI and susceptibility-weighted
  imaging (SWI)-MRI during MCI stage, which progresses and augments through early
  stages of AD. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has indicated
  diminished BBB GLUT1 transporter activity mediating glucose uptake by the brain
  before brain atrophy, dementia, or amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Similarly, diminished
  active efflux ABCB1 (P-gp) BBB transporter activity was shown by verapamil-PET in
  early AD. Early BBB breakdown and vascular dysfunction in MCI and AD has been confirmed
  by some studies by elevated levels of vascular biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid
  (CSF) and blood before Aβ and tau pathology, and dementia. Neuropathological (NP)
  analysis of mild and advanced AD cases confirmed accumulation of perivascular blood-derived
  deposits including, to name a few, fibrin(ogen), thrombin, red blood cells (RBC)-derived
  iron-containing products that all are potentially toxic for the neural tissue. In
  addition, pericyte degeneration, endothelial degeneration, and brain infiltration
  with circulating macrophages and neutrophils were associated with BBB breakdown
  of AD cases on NP analysis. Diminished expression levels of BBB GLUT1 and ABCB1
  (P-gp) transporters have been shown by post mortem NP analysis of AD cases, as well
  as downregulation of Aβ BBB clearance receptors LRP1 and ABCB1, suggesting impaired
  Aβ clearance. Furthermore, APOE4 carriers develop accelerated BBB breakdown associated
  with activation of proinflammatory cyclophilin A (CypA)-matrix metalloproteinase-9
  (MMP-9) pathway at the BBB, which degrades endothelial tight junction and basement
  membrane proteins enhancing BBB damage. How changes in BBB permeability as measured
  by advanced neuroimaging techniques in the living human brain relate to disrupted
  structural and functional connectivity as measured by diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI)-MRI
  and functional MRI (fMRI), and amyloid-PET and tau-PET findings remains unclear
  at present.
