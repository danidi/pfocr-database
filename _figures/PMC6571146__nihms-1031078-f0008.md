caption: '(a) Model depicting the potential involvement of the Mek/ERK1/2-MAPK and
  the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways at different stages of developmental myelination
  and during adulthood. From the analysis of multiple transgenic mice, a working model
  is proposed here: (i) During oligodendrocytes differentiation and initiation of
  myelination, PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, not the Mek/ERK1/2-MAPK pathway is the key regulator
  of these events through mTORC1 activation. (ii) During active myelination, both
  pathways cooperate to regulate the rapid increase of myelin thickness via activation
  of mTORC1 and its downstream signaling molecules. (iii) During adulthood, Mek/Erk1/2-MAPK
  is primarily responsible for the preservation of the integrity of the myelinated
  axon by mechanisms not yet fully understood (?), which are largely mTOR independent.
  Forced overactivation of ERK1/2 in adult oligodendrocytes can re-establish the mTOR-dependent,
  ERK1/2-mediated program of myelin growth during adulthood (*). Relative functional
  importance of the two pathways at different stages is depicted by the image size
  of the signaling proteins. (b) Simplified schematic showing the major components
  of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and the hypothesized involvement of PDK1. Active PI3K
  phosphorylates PIP2 [phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate], converting it to
  PIP3 [phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate] on the plasma membrane. PIP3 recruits
  Akt and PDK1 (Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1) to the plasma membrane,
  enabling PDK1 to phosphorylate a conserved Thr308 on Akt. The activated Akt phosphorylates
  the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) and leads to the release of TSC inhibition
  of RHEB (GTPase Ras homolog enriched in brain). RHEB directly activates mTORC1 which
  activates p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) by phosphorylation at Thr389, a major
  site important for its activation. Activated p70S6K promote the phosphorylation
  of S6 ribosome protein at Ser235/236. Shown in red dotted line is the hypothetical
  step downstream of PI3K and upstream of Akt which potentially involves PDK1. Briefly,
  while the mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of p70S6K at site T389 is clearly important
  for its activity, a prior direct phosphorylation by PDK1 at site T229 in its catalytic
  domain is believed to enhance the activity of p70S6K to reach a higher threshold
  level of activation (; ; ) [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
