caption: Role of oxidative stress and DNA repair proteins in cells. NM23-H1 induced
  DNA nicks may lead to DNA repair or apoptosis. Endogenous or exogenous alkylating
  agents cause DNA lesions such as 3-methylguanine (3-MeG), which are recognized and
  removed by MPG and leave apurinic sites. Ape1/Ref-1 recognizes apurinic sites and
  cleaves the adjacent DNA backbone. DNA repair can be completed through the base
  excision repair pathway. If not repaired, apurinic sites can result in double-stranded
  breaks. γ-H2AX associates with double-stranded breaks and recruits DNA repair proteins.
  Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include superoxide (O2–·), hydrogen peroxide
  (H2O2), and hydroxyl radical (OH·), are formed as byproducts of normal cellular
  metabolism and can produce DNA lesions such as 8-OxoG, which are excised by cellular
  DNA glycosylases. Accumulated O2 interacts with nitric oxide (NO·) to produce peroxynitrite
  (OONO–), which in turn nitrates tyrosines and alters protein structure/function.
  TrxR uses NADPH to reduce Trx, which in turn reduces and activates Ape1/Ref-1. Activated
  Ape1/Ref-1 reduces a number of proteins including various transcription factors.
