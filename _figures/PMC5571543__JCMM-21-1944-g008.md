caption: Proposed mechanism of ESA‐mediated downregulation of Foxp3 in regulatory
  T cells. ESA down‐regulates the expression of P‐Smad2/Smad3 via the inactivation
  of TßRII. Then, it may contribute to the down regulation of Smad4, leading to the
  diminished Foxp3. Ultimately, the reduced Foxp3 might be responsible for the abortion
  caused by ESA.
