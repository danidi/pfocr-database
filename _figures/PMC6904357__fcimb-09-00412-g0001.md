caption: 'Mechanisms of oral bacteria virulence factors inducing changes in host cells.
  (A) Cytolethal distending toxins (CDT) are the virulence factors released by A.
  actinomycetemcomitans: In the cytoplasm, the phosphatase activity of CdtB can decompose
  PIP3, thereby over-activating PI-3K, which is one of effectors of KRAS. This process
  may cause KRAS mutation that leads to cancer. In the nucleus, CdtB causes double
  strand break (DSB), which activates ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase.
  Activation of ATM kinase blocks G1/S and G2/M phases promoting tumor occurrence
  through cell senescence. Tumor initiation also could occur in the instance of erroneous
  in homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair mechanisms.
  In order for the cells to survive, RhoA and p38 MAPK will get activated, thereby
  promoting tumorigenesis. (B) FadA and LPS are the significant virulence factors
  of F. nucleatum. (1) Binding of FadA to host cell E-cadherin causes accumulation
  of β-catenin in cytoplasm that eventually enters into nucleus. β-catenin will act
  together with LEF/TCF and produce abnormal proteins, which ultimately leads to cancer.
  (2) LPS binds to host cell TLR4 receptor and induces MyD88 recruitment. These will
  activate NF-κB signaling pathway to direct cell proliferation and cancer development.
  (C) Gingipains and NDK are the virulence factors secreted by P. gingivalis. (1)
  NDK can decompose ATP and inhibit p2x7-mediated apoptosis. (2) Gingipains able to
  upregulate matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) outside the cells and proMMP-9 via
  NF-kB pathways in the cytoplasm that contribute to the metastasis of cancer cells.
  (3) P. gingivalis also could enter the cells and increase the expression of proMMP-9
  by activating erk1/2-ets1, p38/HSP27. Moreover, P. gingivalis invasion could inhibit
  release of cytochrome c and activate caspase-9 and caspase-3 by dual JAK/Stat and
  Akt signaling, thereby allowing damaged or diseased cells to survive.'
