caption: BHLHE40 can be regulated by the DNA-damage associated gene p53, a tumor suppressor,
  which is commonly mutated in several cancers resulting in its loss of function,
  thus allowing uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation in affected tumors. TP53
  is activated in a tetramer form and is expressed normally in low levels through
  interaction with mouse double mutant 2 (Mdm2) which signals for its degradation
  via ubiquitination (“Ub”). Under conditions of stress, including DNA damage, p53
  gets activated and is stabilized by dissociation from Mdm2, and is transported to
  the nucleus, where it regulates the transcriptional activity of several target genes,
  including BHLHE40. Binding of BHLHE40 to p53 stabilizes the complex in the nucleus
  and allows cooperative transcription of target genes that may lead to senescence
  or apoptosis.
