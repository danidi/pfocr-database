caption: Exogenous agents produce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) with two ends (a),
  whereas during replication, blocking lesions on the template strand can produce
  either one-ended DSBs (b) or daughter-strand gaps (DSGs) (c), both of which are
  preferentially repaired in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle by the BRCA1–BRCA2-mediated
  homologous recombination (HR) pathway. During replication, template strand lesions
  may be repaired either behind the fork or at the fork. Gaps associated with lesions
  on the parental strand behind the fork cannot be removed by base excision repair
  (BER) because an undamaged template is needed for repair; therefore, HR is the only
  available pathway for the repair of DSGs. Cells lacking functional BRCA1 or BRCA2
  exhibit an abundance of chromatid breaks, which indicates an attempt to repair DSGs
  in the absence of a functional BRCA-mediated HR pathway. DSBs that remain unrepaired
  behind a replication fork can also produce chromatid breaks or aberrant junctions
  or exchanges. Hence, BRCA1 and BRCA2 have crucial roles in the repair of replication-associated
  lesions at or behind the replication fork. NHEJ, non-homologous end-joining.
