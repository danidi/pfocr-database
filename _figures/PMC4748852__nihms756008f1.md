caption: Abbreviated illustration of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) protein folding and
  degradation pathway. Nascent GBA peptide is recognized by molecular chaperon Hsp70.
  The enzyme is folded and assembled through other chaperon/cochaperonin systems such
  as eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT (TCP1-ring complex or chaperonin containing TCP1/CCT).
  Successfully folded GBA is transported to the lysosome for its biologic function.
  Unnatural conformation of GBA due to missense mutations leads to inappropriate protein
  folding and Hsp90 binding that directs the peptide to premature degradation through
  the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) appear to
  affect Hsp90 binding and increase protein stability and the quantity of functioning
  enzyme
