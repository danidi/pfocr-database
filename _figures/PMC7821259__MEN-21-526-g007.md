caption: 'Plant hormone signal transduction pathway in elephant grass. A proposed
  model of the plant hormone signal transduction pathway in elephant grass. Expanded
  genes are shown in red. The heatmaps show the expression level of genes involved
  in the plant hormone signal transduction pathway in different elephant grass tissues.
  Columns and rows correspond to the tissues and gene copies, respectively (left to
  right represents leaf, shoot, stem tip, flower and root). Abbreviations: AUX1, auxin
  influx carrier; TIR1, transport inhibitor response; ARF, auxin response factor;
  Aux/IAAs, auxin/indole‐3‐acetic acid; SAUR, small auxin upregulated; GH3, Gretchenhagen‐3;
  CRE1, cytokinin receptor 1; AHP, Arabidopsis histidine phosphotransfer proteins;
  BRR, B‐type Arabidopsis response regulators; ARR, Arabidopsis response regulators;
  GID1, GA‐insensitive dwarf 1; PIF3, phytochrome‐interacting factor 3; BRI1, Brassinosteroid
  insensitive 1; BSK, Brassinosteroid ‐signalling kinases; BIN2, Brassinosteroid insensitive
  2; BZR1/2, Brassinazole‐resistant 1/2; BSU1 bril suppressor1 phosphatase; TCH4,
  Touch 4; CYCD4, Cyclin D 4. Heatmap showing the expression level of candidate genes
  involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathway in tissues of elephant grass
  (left to right represents leaf, shoot, stem tip, flower and root)'
