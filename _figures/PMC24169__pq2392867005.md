caption: Proposed model of CD1d signaling in polarized intestinal epithelia. Results
  from these studies define a signal transduction pathway through surface activation
  of epithelial CD1d and illustrate that this pathway may serve to dampen proinflammatory
  signals at the level of mucosal epithelia through the autocrine actions of epithelial-cell-derived
  IL-10.
