caption: Regulation of hormone synthesis, signaling and transport in seeds by histone
  deacetylation. Previous studies had indicated that histone deacetylation modulates
  the GA, ethylene and ABA pathways (shaded background). HISTONE DEACETYLASE 2B positively
  affects GA levels in seeds and germination by repressing the GA catabolism gene
  GA2ox and enhancing the GA biosynthesis genes GA3ox1 and GA3ox2. SWI-INDEPENDENT3
  (SIN3)-LIKEs (SNLs) in the histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex exert negative effects
  on ethylene levels in seeds and germination by repressing the ethylene biosynthesis
  genes 1-AMINOCYCLOPROPANE-1-CARBOXYLATE OXIDASEs (ACOs) and signaling genes ETHYLENE
  RESPONSE FACTORs (ERFs), through deacetylation of histone H3 at lysines 9 and 18
  (H3K9/18). SNLs repress CYP707A1 and CYP707A2 also, which results in ABA accumulation
  in seeds and negative regulation of germination. A new study has revealed that the
  negative role of SNLs in seed germination (speed) is also mediated through the auxin
  pathway. Unlike the other hormonal pathways where metabolism or signaling genes
  are the targets of histone deacetylation, SNLs repress AUXIN RESISTANT 1 (AUX1),
  an auxin influx carrier, thereby affecting auxin transport (and synthesis). Repression
  of AUX1 reduces the expression of the downstream factors D-type cyclin genes CYCDs,
  which are positive regulators of germination. The auxin transporter appears to play
  an important role for (the synthesis and) proper distribution of auxin in the radicle
  tip. Based on , ), , .
