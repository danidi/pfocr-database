caption: 'Alteration of TLR4 signaling in pregnancy disorders. (A) Bacterial products,
  such as lipopolysaccharide, activate TLR4 and the signal TRIF-TBK1-IRF-3 pathway
  to induce the baseline expression of IFN-β (which is encoded by IFNB) in the placenta.
  The production of IFN-β by the placenta modulates the maternal immune system and
  promotes tolerance, while providing protection against viral and bacterial infections.
  (B) Bacterial products stimulate the production of type I IFNs by trophoblast cells
  and maintain an anti-inflammatory environment as well as active surveillance and
  protection against infections. However, in case higher antigen load or if pathogenic
  infection reaches the placenta, TLR4 expression increases and modulate the activation
  signals through MyD88-TRAF6-NF-κB leading to inhibition of type I IFNs, and promotion
  of pro-inflammatory response that is responsible for preterm labor. TRAM is the
  TRIF-related adapter molecule (also known as TICAM2). Role of macrophages and TLR4
  in Pregnancy: (C) In normal pregnancy, M2-like macrophages are available around
  spiral arteries and the endothelium, which helps in the remodeling of these arteries
  by producing various factors associated with angiogenesis and tissue remodeling.
  They also play a role in immunomodulation, for instance by producing IL-10. (D)
  During preeclampsia, increased numbers of M1-like macrophages are found in the materno–fetal
  interface. These M1 type decidual macrophages have more TLR4 expression and signal
  via NF-κB pathway to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IFN-γ,
  which induces apoptosis of the trophoblast cells.'
