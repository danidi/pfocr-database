caption: Intracellular Ca2+ initiates 2-AG biosynthesis by inducing the formation
  of diacylglycerol (DAG) in the membrane by stimulating the phosphatidyl-inositol-phospholipase
  C (PI-PLC) pathway. Alternatively, the formation of DAG involves the hydrolysis
  of phosphatidic acid through Mg2+ and Ca2+-dependent PA phsophohydrolase activity.
  2-AG is the product of DAG-lipase (DAGL) acting on DAG. The second pathway involves
  hydrolysis of PI by phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and hydrolysis of the resultant lyso-PI
  by a specific lyso-PLC. In certain conditions 2-AG can also be synthesized through
  the conversion of 2-arachidonyl lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) by a phosphatase to
  yield 2-AG. Once synthesized, 2-AG can be transported to the outside of the cell
  through a process that has not yet been characterized. AMT, anandamide membrane
  transporter.
