caption: Schematic model demonstrating how PTH signaling leads to changes in SOST
  and RANKL expression in osteocytes. Salt‐inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) is a constitutively
  active kinase that normally phosphorylates substrates, including HDAC4/5 and CRTC2.
  When phosphorylated, these SIK2 substrates localize to the cytoplasm due to retention
  by 14‐3‐3 chaperone proteins. PTH induces protein kinase A activation, which phosphorylates
  and inhibits SIK2 and leads to reductions in SIK substrate phosphorylation and their
  subsequent nuclear translocation. In the nucleus, HDAC4/5 inhibit MEF2C‐driven SOST
  expression, and CRTC2 potentiates CREB‐driven RANKL transcription. Because PTH inhibits
  SIK2 action, small molecule SIK inhibitors such as YKL‐05‐099 mimic the effects
  of PTH in a cyclic AMP‐independent manner. Future studies are needed to assess whether
  additional PTH‐regulated SIK substrates exist and to determine the role of PTH‐dependent
  SIK2‐independent pathways in osteocytic responses to parathyroid hormone. It is
  not currently known if this pathway also participates in PTH/PTHrP‐driven osteocytic
  perilacunar remodeling.
