caption: 'Schematic overview of costimulatory receptors and their ligands. Illustrated
  are costimulatory ligands and their respective receptors, which can deliver signals
  that function to either activate (+) or downregulate (−) immune responses in tandem
  with alloantigen-specific T cell receptor engagement with the MHC/peptide complex.
  Costimulatory molecules can be grouped broadly into two distinct superfamilies based
  on structural homology: the CD28:B7 superfamily, which includes CD28 and CTLA-4,
  and the TNF:TNF-R superfamily, in which the CD40-CD40L pathway is pre-eminent. Costimulatory
  molecules were originally described in immune cells. It is increasingly recognized,
  however, that costimulatory signaling can also occur in nonlymphoid cells, including
  cancer cells.'
