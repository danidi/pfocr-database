caption: Inhibition of components of the Shh Pathway in cancer. Inactive signaling
  (left) occurs in the absence of Shh ligand wherein PTCH1 inhibits SMO resulting
  in GLI1 sequestration in the cytoplasm by SUFU. In the presence of Shh (right),
  PTCH1 suppression of SMO is abrogated resulting in the nuclear accumulation of GLI1
  and activation of target genes that promote several oncogenic properties to tumor
  cells. Inhibition of the Shh pathway is primarily directed at inhibition of SMO
  and GLI1, with many of these compounds in clinical trials for solid cancers. More
  recently attempts have been made to inhibit the Shh signaling pathway by using the
  monoclonal antibody 5E1 or the SHHat inhibitor RU-SKI 43 to inhibit SHH directly.
  SHHat is an O-acyltransferase that catalyzes the palmitoylation of Shh, which is
  critical to its function.
