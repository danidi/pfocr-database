caption: 'Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is generated within cells from
  discrete dietary precursors: the essential amino acid tryptophan by a series of
  enzymes collectively referred to as the “de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathway;” the
  vitamin B3 analog nicotinamide (also referred to as niacinamide) by the enzyme nicotinamide
  phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt); and other precursors that include nicotinic acid
  (NA) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). NAD+ is cleaved by enzymes of different classes:
  sirtuins, which remove acetyl or acyl modifications from proteins; poly-ADP ribose
  polymerases (PARPs), which add one or more poly-ADP ribose moieties to proteins;
  and ectonucleotidases such as CD38, which generate cyclic ADP ribose from NAD+.'
