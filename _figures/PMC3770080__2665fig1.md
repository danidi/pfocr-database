caption: Schematic representation of FA and GPL biosynthesis and remodeling. During
  de novo biosynthesis of GPLs by the Kennedy pathway, SFAs and MUFAs are mainly incorporated
  in position sn-1 and sn-2 of the newly synthesized GPLs. These FAs are biosynthesized
  by FASN and SCD-1. PUFAs are incorporated into GPLs by Lands cycle remodeling, which
  is characterized by the hydrolysis of SFAs or MUFAs from the sn-2 position of GPLs
  by a PLA2 followed by a reacylation with PUFAs by a LPLAT. Free FA must be activated
  by an ACSL to produce the acyl-CoA required for its incorporation in the 2-lyso-GPL
  previously produced by the PLA2. Highly unsaturated long chain PUFAs, like AA (20:4n-6),
  which are mainly incorporated into 1-acyl-glycerophosphatidylcholine (GPC) in the
  Lands cycle, are directly transferred to other specific GPL species [1-acyl-glycerophosphatidylethanolamine
  (GPE), 1-alk-enyl-GPE, and 1-alkyl-GPC] by the CoA-IT. This CoA-independent remodeling
  is involved in the maturation of GPLs and the distribution of the AA in GPLs.
