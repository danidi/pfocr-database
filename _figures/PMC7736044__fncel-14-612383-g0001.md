caption: 'Interplay between cysteine protease activation and mitochondrial deteriorating
  processes in MS myelin degeneration. (A) graphical depiction of the AMS in physiological
  conditions (Micu et al., ). The action potential (1) is sensed by Ca2+ channels
  which via a ryanodine receptor-dependent mechanism mobilize the axoplasmic Ca2+
  reserves. Ca2+ triggers vesicle fusion and glutamate release (2). Glutamate activates
  NMDA-Rs promoting myelinic Ca2+ influx and glycolysis processes. This sequence of
  events leads to pyruvate and lactate production (3). Lactate is ultimately transported
  to the axon to metabolically assist axonal mitochondria. (B) In pathological conditions,
  excessive Ca2+ myelinic influx is promoted via altered stimulation of NMDA receptors
  (Micu et al., ). Possible players involved in such effect are: (a) an altered Na+
  homeostasis, where augmented extracellular Na+ may lead to intra-axonal aberrant
  processes that promote Ca2+ influx (Craner et al., ); (b) altered Ca2+ mobilization
  inside the axoplasmic reticulum (Micu et al., ) and (c) the presence of subtle axonal
  nanoruptures which make axonal cylinder permeable to Ca2+ (Witte et al., ). Irrespective
  of the mechanism by which altered Ca2+ entrance in the myelin is triggered, such
  phenomenon (1) may lead to a consequent activation of PADs (2). PADs citrullinate
  myelin proteins (e.g., MBP). Myelin degenerative processes together with citrullination
  of MBP promote biochemically altered (highly immunogenic) debris formation (3).
  (C) Summary of the principal pathways by which cysteine proteases (blue pathway)
  and dysregulated mitochondria (red pathway) can affect myelin and MAG stability.
  These processes and their interplay may be responsible of myelin and axonal breakdown
  in MS. Pink box inside myelin depicts the players of a possible vicious cycle between
  cysteine protease activation and mitochondrial instability in MS-related myelin
  breakdown. (D) Schematic representation of a possible vicious cycle activated by
  enhanced myelinic Ca2+ entrance. Primary Ca2+ entrance instigates a parallel activation
  of mu-type-calpains (calpain-1) and mitochondria degenerative processes. Secondary
  Ca2+ accumulation due to Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) degradation and Ca2+ efflux from
  mitochondria might take part in a tertiary activation of m-type calpains (calpain-2)
  which can exacerbate lysosomal and mitochondria instability leading to heightened
  myelin damage.'
