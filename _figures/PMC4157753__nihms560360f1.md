caption: Vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) is supplied from blood circulation by the concerted
  action of serum retinol-binding protein (RBP), stimulated by retinoic acid 6 (STRA6),
  cellular retinol-binding protein type 1 (CRBP1) and lecithin:retinol acyl transferase
  (LRAT). Vitamin A is stored as all-trans-retinyl ester in the retinosomes of RPE
  cells. With all-trans-retinyl ester as substrate, RPE65 isomerizes the ester to
  11-cis-retinol and then 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) such as RDH5 and RDH11
  oxidize 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-Retinal binds to retinoid binding
  proteins including cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP) and inter-photoreceptor
  retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), and is then transported to photoreceptors to regenerate
  light-sensitive rhodopsin. When light hits the light-sensitive form of rhodopsin
  with 11-cis-retinal, 11-cis-retinal is photo-isomerized to all-trans-retinal. This
  conformational change initiates rhodopsin activation. All-trans-retinal is largely
  released from rhodopsin into the cytosolic lumen of rod photoreceptor cell outer
  segments, but a fraction remains in the intra-discal lumen. This portion of the
  aldehyde is flipped into the cytosolic lumen of photoreceptors by the ATP-binding
  cassette transporter (ABCA4), to join the rest of released all-trans-retinal that
  then becomes reduced by all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs, including RDH8 and
  RDH12) to all-trans-retinol. All-trans-retinol is transported back to RPE cells
  by binding with IRBP and CRBP1. Impairment of any reaction in this cycle is closely
  associated with human retinal disorders (red). LCA, Leber congenital amaurosis;
  RP, retinitis pigmentosa; CRD, cone-rod dystrophy; FA, fundus albipunctatus; BD,
  Bothnia dystrophy; RPA, retinitis punctata albescens; SGD, Stargardt disease; AMD,
  age-related macular degeneration; Matthew-Wood Synd, Matthew-Wood Syndrome. This
  current work focuses mainly on models in mouse, which is rod dominant species, but
  identification of supplementary retinoid transformations in Müller cells could open
  the possibility to study the cone retinoid cycle that, in addition to the canonical
  retinoid cycle pathway, supports cone pigment regeneration [, –].Note that Stecher
  et. al. [] showed two pools of retinyl esters in the RPE, only one of which were
  substrates for retinoid isomerase. This discovery was followed by findings made
  by 1) Imanishi et al. who showed that a large amount of the esters are stored in
  retinosomes [, ]; and 2) Orban et al. and others showed that RPE65 does not localize
  retinosomes []. Thus, the fraction of retinyl esters embedded in the smooth ER are
  like the source of substrate for RPE65 (not distinct from retinosomes on the figures).
