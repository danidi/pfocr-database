caption: There are similarities and significant differences in light and dopamine
  mediated phase regulation of the retinal clock in Xenopus leavis driving melatonin
  release and that in mice driving PER2∷luc expression. A. In Xenopus dopamine acting
  at D2-like receptors suppresses cAMP and increases PER2 expression in a pathway
  leading to both phase advances and phase delays. However, there is a dopamine and
  cAMP independent pathway through which light directly increases PER2 phase shifts
  the clock. B. In mice dopamine acting at D1 receptors (DRD1) phase shifts the clock.
  In addition, dopamine mediates the phasing effect of light as DRD1 antagonists block
  the phasing effect of light. There is evidence that retrograde signaling through
  melanopsin (OPN4) in ipRGCs modulates the effects of light on dopamine release from
  amacrine cells. However, OPN4 is not required for light induced phasing of the PER2∷luc
  rhythm and neuropsin (OPN5), also in a set retinal ganglion cells, is required.
  Current data imply that retrograde signaling from ipRGCs phase shift the clock through
  a pathway involving dopamine but it is unclear whether OPN5 is in a class of cells
  that is distinct from those expressing OPN4.
