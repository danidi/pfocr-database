caption: 'De novo SL biosynthesis and S1P metabolism. S1P is the product of ceramide
  metabolism, which can be originated by three pathways: 1) sphingomyelin catabolism
  in the plasma membrane; 2) salvage pathway in the lysosome; and 3) de novo biosynthesis
  in the ER membrane. (1a) Sphingomyelinase (SMase) catabolizes sphingomyelin (SM)
  into ceramide, which is transformed into sphingosine (Sph) by ceramidase and finally
  phosphorylated by SPHK-1/2 to form S1P; (1b) the salvage pathway involves first
  the breakdown of SM and complex SLs into ceramide and then sphingosine in the endolysosomal
  compartment; and (1c) de novo biosynthesis initiates with the condensation of serine
  and palmitoyl-CoA into 3-ketosphinaganine by serine-palmitoyltransferase (SPT),
  the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway. Nogo-B binds to and inhibits the activity
  of SPT. In the next step, 3-ketosphinganine is rapidly converted into sphinganine
  by ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (KDHR). Dihydroceramide synthase (dihydro-CerS)
  converts sphinganine into dihydroceramide, which is further catabolized into ceramide
  by dihydroceramide desaturase (DES). Ceramide can be transformed into higher-order
  SLs, such as glycosphingolipids (GSL) and SM, or metabolized into Sph and ultimately
  S1P. Once produced, S1P can follow three different paths: (2a) it can be dephosphorylated
  into Sph by S1P phosphatase (SPP) to form ceramide; (2b) it can be irreversibly
  degraded by the S1P lyase; or (2c) it can be transported out of the cell, through
  transporters, such as spinster 2 (Spns2). Once released by (3a) ECs or (3b) red
  blood cells (RBCs), (4) S1P binds to circulating protein carriers, ApoM on the HDL
  (≈65%) or albumin (≈35%), which transport and deliver S1P to S1PRs. Endothelial-derived
  S1P can also directly activate the S1PR1/3 in an autocrine manner to regulate vascular
  tone. (5) S1P can be recycled and converted into Sph, which is uptaken by RBC or
  EC and converted to S1P.'
