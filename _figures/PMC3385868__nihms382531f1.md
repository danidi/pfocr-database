caption: Delivery of glucose and ATP to hexokinase (HK) II bound to the outer mitochondrial
  membrane within a malignant cell and metabolic fates of the glucose-6-phosphate
  (G-6-P) formed. Glucose brought across the plasma membrane by glucose transporters
  (1) is rapidly phosphorylated by HK II (5) bound to voltage-dependent anion channel
  (VDAC) (4) located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The VDAC allows direct access
  to HK II of ATP generated by the ATP synthase (2) and transported across the inner-mitochondrial
  membrane by the adenine nucleotide translocator (3). To maintain the highly glycolytic
  metabolic flux of such malignant cells, the product G-6-P is rapidly distributed
  across key metabolic routes. The primary routes are (a) direct entry of the G-6-P
  into the pentose-phosphate shunt for biosynthesis of nucleic-acid precursors and
  (b) conversion of the G-6-P via the glycolytic pathway to pyruvate and lactic acid.
  Here, whereas the lactic acid is transported out on lactate transporters (6) to
  provide an unfavorable environment for surrounding normal cells, some pyruvate is
  directed to mitochondria via the pyruvate transporter (7), to provide substrates
  for the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Citrate produced by this cycle then exits
  the mitochondria on the citrate transporter (8) to help synthesize membrane components
  (phospholipids and cholesterol) that are essential for tumor proliferation.
