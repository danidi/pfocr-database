caption: Model of salicylic acid (SA) synthesis and SA signal transduction. Enhanced
  disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1), phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD4), and avrpphb susceptible
  3 (PBS3) are involved upstream of SA synthesis, and can be induced by positive SA
  feedback. The redox state alteration caused by the SA burst leads to the monomerization
  of non-expressor of PR genes 1 (NPR1). The monomerization of NPR1 by thioredoxins
  (TRXs) such as TRX-H3 and TRX-H5 cause the translocation of NPR1 in the nucleus
  and subsequent interaction with the positive transcription activators TGACG sequence-specific
  binding proteins (TGAs), the negative regulators non-inducible immunity (NIM1)-interacting
  proteins (NIMINs) and Suppressor of npr1-inducible 1 (SNI1). NPR1 is imported into
  the nucleus through nuclear pores. S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) can facilitate the
  oligomerization of NPR1. During systemic acquired resistance (SAR), the kinase SnRK2.8
  is required for the phosphorylation of NPR1, which is not triggered by SA; it is
  triggered by an unknown signal. A possible working model would be that SA triggers
  the formation of NPR1 monomers. Then, NPR1 monomers are phosphorylated by sucrose
  non-fermenting 1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 2.8 (SnRK2.8) for its nuclear import.
  The transcription factor whirly 1 (WHY1) is probably involved in the NPR1-independent
  SA response. Suppressor of SA insensitivity 2 (SSI2) is a negative regulator, independent
  from NPR1, which regulates the SA-mediated response. Overexpression of glutaredoxin
  C9 (GRXC9) could regulate the SA pathway independent from NPR1. Pathogen-related
  1 (PR1), PR2, and PR5 are SA-responsive marker genes. Activation (closed arrowhead),
  suppression (⊥), and important genes are indicated.
