caption: The Fanconi anemia pathway suppresses R-loop-associated genome instability.
  A replication fork encountering a R-loop is stabilized by the coordinated functions
  of proteins implicated in FA. BRCA2, FANCD2, and possibly other FA proteins are
  recruited to the replication fork encountering a DNA‒RNA hybrid to prevent fork
  collapse. The FA proteins may facilitate R-loop resolving enzymes such as RNH1 or
  SETX. On the other hand, FANCM directly resolves R-loop structures to facilitate
  resumption of DNA synthesis. Thus, proteins involved in the FA pathway mitigate
  R-loop-associated transcription‒replication conflicts and ensure genome stability.
  BRCA1 in association with SETX is recruited to the R-loop sites formed at transcriptional
  termination regions of highly transcribed genes and acts to repair/prevent R-loop-driven
  DNA damage at these genomic loci.
