caption: 'Modes of Aβ toxicity as illustrated for the signaling through the NMDA (N-methyl
  d-aspartate) receptor (NMDAR). Tau is perceived as an ‘axonal’ protein, although
  a fraction of it is present in dendrites. Tau functions in targeting the kinase
  Fyn to this compartment. Fyn then phosphorylates the NMDAR subunit NR2B, thereby
  mediating complex formation of NMDARs with the post-synaptic density protein 95
  (PSD95). The over-activation of the NMDAR complex (excitotoxicity) results in excessive
  nitric oxide (NO) levels. This causes down-stream protein misfolding and aggregation,
  as well as mitochondrial fragmentation. The toxic signaling pathway also involves
  the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c (Cyt c) and the activation of down-stream
  caspases as well as the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The excitotoxicity
  complex mediates Aβ’s toxic functions and subsequent neurodegeneration, a process
  that depends on the presence of tau. Inset: Components of the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain itself are targets of Aβ and tau and, together, these toxic entities synergistically
  impair mitochondrial functions'
