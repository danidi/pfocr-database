caption: TRAIL-induced apoptosis signaling pathway. TRAIL initiates apoptosis through
  binding to DR4 and/or DR5. TRAIL binding induces receptor trimerization to promote
  the assembly of DISC (composed of FADD and procaspases 8/10) to induce self-cleavage
  and thus activation of caspases 8/10, which in turn trigger downstream caspase cascade
  to execute apoptosis program. In certain cell types, activated caspase 8 cleaves
  BID to generate truncated BID (tBID), which in turn triggers the mitochondrial apoptosis
  pathway. c-FLIP competes with procaspase 8 for recruitment to DISC, thereby suppressing
  activation of procaspase 8 and thus dampening TRAIL-initiated apoptosis stimuli.
  Antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1 suppress the activation
  of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway to blunt TRAIL-induced apoptosis. IAP proteins
  survivin and XIAP induce TRAIL resistance via the blockade of the activity of executioner
  caspases.
