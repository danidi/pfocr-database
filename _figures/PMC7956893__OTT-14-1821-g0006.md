caption: PPs inhibit inflammation and induce necroptosis and mitophagy in cancer cells.
  (A) PPVII inhibits the inflammation by inhibiting the LPS-induced expression of
  TNF-α, IL-1B, and IL-6. PPVII also inhibits the inflammation through the NF-kB and
  MAPK pathways. In the NF-kB pathway, PPVII inhibit the IKB-α, p65 and its translocation
  to the nucleus which further inhibit iNOS, COX-2, and MMP-9 and inhibit inflammation.
  In the MAPK pathway, PPVII inhibits p38-MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK1/2, resulting in inhibition
  of inflammation. (B) PPD induces necroptosis in cancer cells, whereas necrosulfonamide
  reverses this inhibition. (C) PPI induces the translocation of DRP1 to the mitochondria
  by dephosphorylating DRP1 at ser-637, causing mitochondrial fission. PPI increases
  the stabilization of full-length PINK1 at the surface of the mitochondria, leading
  to P62, PARK2, ubiquitin, and LC3B-II recruitment to the mitochondria and then to
  mitophagy. PPI-induced mitophagy is suppressed markedly by PINK1 knockdown. DRP1
  suppression through shRNA or mdivi-1 inhibits the knockdown of PINK1 and PPI-induced
  mitochondrial fragmentation. These results suggest that PINK1 depletion leads to
  fission and mitochondrial fragmentation.
