caption: Receptors used by chemerin, visfatin, resistin and apelin for their signaling
  pathways. chemerin can bind three different receptors that are CMKLR1, GPR1 and
  CCRL2. CMKLR1 and GPR1 are coupled with intracellular Gαi proteins. The last receptor
  doesn’t have any active signaling pathway identified until now suggesting a putative
  role of co-receptor for CCRL2. Apelin has its own receptor called APJ coupled with
  intracellular Gq and Gαi proteins. Resistin could bind receptors such as CAP-1,
  ROR-1 and TLR-4 but it has to be confirmed. No receptor for visfatin has been identified
  until now.
