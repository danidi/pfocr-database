caption: 'By several pharmacological experiments, it has been suggested that protein
  kinase A (PKA) is involved in the downstream of cAMP as an inhibitory signaling
  pathway together with calmodulin activated by Ca2+. Lydan and O’Day have shown evidence
  about the role of calmodulin as both a negative (gamete formation) and a positive
  (cell fusion) regulator of sexual events in Dictyostelium. It is most likely that
  ZYG1 may be phosphorylated by PKC activated by Ca2+ in the signaling pathway inducing
  zygote formation.: induction →: inhibition ⫞'
