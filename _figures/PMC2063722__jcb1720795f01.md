caption: The p53 signaling pathway negatively regulates tumorigenesis and bone development.
  Wild-type p53 inhibits osteoblast differentiation through the repression of Osterix
  and Runx2. Mdm2, which is a negative regulator of p53, can override this response
  and promote osteoblast differentiation and bone development. Osteoblasts lacking
  p53 have an enhanced ability to promote osteoclast differentiation and activity.
  Enhanced osteoclast differentiation is associated with elevated levels of MCSF produced
  by the p53 −/− osteoblasts.
