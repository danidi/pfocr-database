caption: (a) Schematic illustration of the enzyme-catalysed Krebs cycle as occurring
  in yeast (grey), glyoxylate shunt (orange) and succinic semi-aldehyde pathway (red).
  (b) Non-enzymatic TCA-like reactions replicate large parts of the reaction spectra
  of the TCA cycle, glyoxylate shunt and succinic semi-aldehyde pathway. Non-enzymatic
  reactions that occur in the presence of peroxydisulfate and ferrous sulfide are
  coloured according to whether they replicate the Krebs cycle (black), the glyoxylate
  shunt (orange) or the succinic semi-aldehyde pathway (red). Circle diagrams illustrate
  the efficiency in terms of total TCA metabolite recovery of the entire network (substrate
  formation; blue), TCA-intermediate formation (red) and carbon loss (formation of
  non-TCA intermediates; grey). The inner and outer circles, respectively, represent
  peroxydisulfate and the combination of peroxydisulfate and ferrous sulfide. Modified
  from [].
