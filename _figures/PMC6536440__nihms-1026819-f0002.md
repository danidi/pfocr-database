caption: Examples of axonal stress that lead to activation of DLK. Defects in axonal
  transport [], disruption of cytoskeleton within axons [–], and inhibition of trophic
  factor signaling [,,] all result in the activation of DLK signaling. Downstream
  responses (in orange) include reduced expression levels of presynaptic proteins
  [] and yet unknown signals that impair postsynaptic receptor function and synaptic
  homeostasis mechanisms []. Over time these responses are expected to promote synaptic
  decline and loss.
