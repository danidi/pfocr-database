caption: The NCT complex is a global regulator, which acts as both a negative and
  a positive regulator of a wide range of gene regulation that includes secondary
  metabolism, cellular transport and sterol biosynthesis as important targets for
  virulence and azole resistance in A. fumigatus. The NCT complex fine-tunes expression
  of several genes in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and the azole efflux pump
  encoding cdr1 by directly interacting with their core promoter region. The NCT complex
  also acts as a key regulator of azole resistance by modulating the expression levels
  of the transcription factors associated with ergosterol biosynthesis and azole resistance;
  transcriptional repression of the activator-encoding srbA and atrR genes, and activation
  of the negative regulator-encoding hapC gene. Therefore, the loss of the NCT complex
  causes an increased level of cellular ergosterol content and an elevated production
  of Cdr1B that leads to a multi-drug-resistance phenotype to the azoles as well as
  the salvage therapeutics amphotericin B and terbinafine.
