caption: 'A: three members of BIQ family shares opposite conFig uration at C3 and
  C15 (either 3S15R, or 3R15S). Two well-known antibiotics, daunorubicin and avermectin,
  have more than one stereospecific center and genes for stereochemical control at
  C13 and C5 for these two antibiotics respectively will be discussed in this study.
  B: Biosynthetic pathways of MED 2 and ACT 1 were proposed to share common earlier
  stages to produce a bicyclic intermediate 4. The formation of this intermediate
  was catalyzed by polyketide synthases (minimal PKS: KS, CLF and ACP) and related
  enzymes (KR, ARO and CYC). It could be converted into two shunt products (DMAC 5
  and aloesaponarin II 6) in the actVI-ORF1-deficient mutant strain. The keto-reduction
  at C-3 of this bicyclic intermediate 4 in ACT 1 pathway was performed by ActVI-ORF1,
  probably by Med-ORF12 in MED 2 pathway, followed by spontaneous cyclization and
  dehydration, leading to the production of DNPA 7 with 3S configuration.'
