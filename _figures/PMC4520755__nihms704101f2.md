caption: 'The canonical HH-signalling pathway and pharmacological inhibitors targeting
  this pathway that are under ongoing development as anticancer therapies. The HH-processing
  pathway involves HHC autocatalysis, and SKN and Dispatched proteins, which mediate
  the release of HHN ligands (IHH, DHH and SHH). In the absence of HHN binding, PTCH
  interacts with and inhibits the activity of SMO; HHN binding to PTCH releases its
  inhibitory effects on SMO, resulting in SMO accumulation and sequestration of COS
  and SUFU proteins in cilia, which releases the GLI transcription factors to exert
  their effects in the nucleus. KIF3A and β-arrestin are required for localization
  of SMO to cilia. GLI1/2 promote a gene-expression pattern relevant to tumorigenesis.
  Development of investigational anticancer agents that inhibit SMO activation is
  of great interest. In addition, other potential targets, such as extracellular HHN
  ligands, GLI1/2 activation, or inhibition of gene transcription are under preclinical
  investigation. Besides the FDA-approved agent vismodegib, a number of small-molecule
  inhibitors of SMO are currently under clinical investigation. Abbreviations: COS,
