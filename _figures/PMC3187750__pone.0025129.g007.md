caption: 'A complete cycle of lipid II biosynthesis and processing, including translocation
  to the outside and recycling of the bactoprenol carrier, needs to be maintained
  for co-ordinated function of the cell division machinery (which may consist of FtsW,
  FtsI, FtsH, FtsK and FtsY). The actin ortholog MreB functionally organizes MurF,
  MraY and MurG and directs lipid II biosynthesis to the septum. The synthesized precursor
  is translocated to the outside where the release of the bactoprenol carrier is catalyzed
  through the activity of FtsI and PBP2 (as well as probably AmiA). Question marks
  and dashed arrows indicate steps of the proposed pathway that remain to be elucidated.
