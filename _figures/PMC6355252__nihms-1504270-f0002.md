caption: The figure illustrates the formation and detoxification of MGO, a glycolytic
  byproduct that is formed either from glucose or fructose. Endogenously derived glycolytic
  byproducts (e.g., Methylglyoxal or MGO) or their AGE derivatives (e.g., Nε-carboxyethyl-lysine
  or CEL and Methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone or MG-H1) lead to a variety of
  diseases affecting different organs (such as brain, heart, eyes, kidney, lungs)
  that complicate with age. In addition to endogenous sources such as glucose or fructose
  derived dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) (formed during glycolysis), exogenous
  dietary sources such as dry heat-cooked food predominantly produces AGEs (large
  red arrow). Detoxification of MGO occurs via glutathione (GSH)-dependent glyoxalase
  pathway mediated by two mitochondrial enzymes glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) and glyoxalase
  2 (GLO2) that eventually converts MGO to lactic acid. Alternatively, MGO can also
  be converted to lactic acid in a single step mediated by a GSH-independent cytosolic
  enzyme glyoxalase 3 (GLO3), a mammalianorthologue of the protein DJ1/PARK7.
