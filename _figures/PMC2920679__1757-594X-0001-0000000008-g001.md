caption: mTOR complex (mTORC)1 regulates protein synthesis in cycling cells by promoting
  cap-dependent mRNA translation, and the assembly of actively translating poly-ribosomes
  (polysomes). The signaling functions of mTORC1 are tightly controlled by growth
  factors, amino acids, and bioenergetic molecules, including oxygen and ATP. Growth
  factor receptors communicate with mTORC1 by activating phosphoinositide-3-kinase
  (PI3K). A key target for PI3K is the AGC family kinase AKT, which is phosphorylated
  at Thr308 in the activation loop (AL) by PI3K-dependent kinase-1. Full activation
  of AKT requires a second phosphorylation event at Ser473 in the hydrophobic motif
  (HM), which is carried out by mTORC2. mTORC2 is also responsible for a third phosphorylation
  event at Thr450 in the turn motif (TM), which promotes AKT signaling by increasing
  the stability of this protein kinase. The signaling functions of mTORC2 are stimulated
  by direct binding to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)1 and TSC2 heterodimer
  (TSC1/2), and possibly by an undefined signal generated by PI3K. Once activated,
  AKT phosphorylates TSC2, which inhibits TSC1/2-associated GTPase-activating protein
  (GAP) activity, leading to increased levels of mTORC1-activating, GTP-bound Rheb.
  Conversely, hypoxia and ATP depletion (revealed by an increase in the AMP:ATP ratio)
  stimulate TSC1/2 GAP activity via induction of REDD1 (Regulated in Development and
  DNA Damage Responses-1) and AMPK activities, respectively. Genotoxic stress-induced
  p53 activity also stimulates TSC1/2 GAP activity via induction of Sestrins, which
  bind to and stimulate AMPK. Finally, amino acids activate mTORC1 by inducing the
  assembly of Rag heterodimers (e.g., the RagA-RagC heterodimers shown in the figure).
  Deregulated mTORC1 activity promotes the synthesis of proteins that drive inappropriate
  cell survival and growth, and supports tumor progression. The inset box shows the
  newly defined, Fbxw7-dependent mechanism that mediates mTOR ubiquitination and subsequent
  proteasomal degradation. Loss of the tumor suppressor Fbxw7 stabilizes mTOR and
  promotes elevated mTORC1 and mTORC2 activities in cancer cells.
