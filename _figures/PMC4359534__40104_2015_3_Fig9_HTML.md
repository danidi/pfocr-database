caption: Lipid metabolism, molecular transport, small molecule biochemistry. Pathway
  analysis of gene functions in broiler hypothalamus transcriptome in response to
  acute heat stress. Red color shows up-regulation and green color shows down-regulation
  (IPA). The intensity of green and red molecule colors indicates the degree of down
  or upregulation, respectively. White molecules are not differential expression,
  but are included to illustrate association with significantly up-regulated and down-regulated
  genes.
