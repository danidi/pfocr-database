caption: Population dynamics and maintenance of Treg cells in NLTs. During an adaptive
  immune response in NLT (e.g., in the central nervous system during EAE) conventional
  T cells (Teff) infiltrate the target tissue and expand providing sufficient IL-2
  to also drive the differentiation and expansion of Treg cells. After contraction
  of the conventional effector T cell (Teff) population (due to active regulation
  by Treg cells), IL-2 becomes limiting and persisting Treg cells likely depend on
  alternative signals for self-renewal. Here, signals that activate the NF-κB pathway
  might be important cues not only for NLT function but also for their maintenance
  (). TCR triggering of Treg cells and downstream modulation of the TCR signal by
  the transcriptional modulator IRF4 is a non-redundant event in the differentiation
  of central Treg cells (cTreg) in secondary lymphoid tissues into effector Treg cells
  (eTreg) in the inflamed tissue. The requirement of the TCR signal and other cues
  in NLT Treg cells that reside in specific niches over extended periods of time needs
  to be determined and likely depends on the anatomical niche that might then also
  drive a distinct functional specialization of NLT Treg cells.
