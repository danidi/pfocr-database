caption: The multiple roles of protein ubiquitylation. (a) In the nucleus, ubiquitylation
  signals for proteasome-independent regulation of DNA repair. Histones and PCNA are
  examples of nuclear targets of ubiquitylation. (b) Ubiquitylation functions in kinase
  activation by acting as a scaffold to bring kinases and their substrates together
  to enable the activation of kinase cascades, as exemplified by the activation of
  IKK by TAK1. The E3 TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) ubiquitylates several
  proteins including NEMO and itself upon ligand stimulation. TAK1 and IKK complexes
  interact with each other upon binding these ubiquitin chains with their ubiquitin-binding
  subunits (TAB2 and NEMO, respectively). IKK is thus activated by TAK1 and competent
  to phosphorylate IκB, which leads to its ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation
  (i). Iκ-B degradation releases NF-κB into nucleus, thereby activating gene transcription.
  (c) Proteasome-mediated degradation (i) regulates many cellular processes through
  targeted degradation of key regulatory proteins. (d) Ubiquitylation signals for
  protein quality control to degrade misfolded proteins. Protein quality control of
  ER proteins occurs through the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway
  by proteasomal degradation (i), whereas some large protein aggregates are eliminated
  through the autophagy (Av, autophagic vesicles)-lysosome route (ii). Polyubiquitylation
  acts as a signal for autophagy targeting. (e) Ubiquitylation signals for vesicular
  trafficking between membrane compartments. (iii) Ligand-bound plasma membrane proteins
  internalized into early endosomes (EE). (iv) Proteins sorting into multivascular
  bodies (MVB). (v) Newly synthesized membrane proteins sorting from the trans-Golgi
  network (TGN) to the MVB. (f) Ubiquitin signaling regulates gene transcription.
