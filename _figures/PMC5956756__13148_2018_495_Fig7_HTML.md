caption: 'Proposed mechanistic scheme: miR-29c suppresses breast cancer by the TIMP3/STAT1/FOXO1
  pathway. The expression of miR-29c was decreased in breast cancer, which leading
  to the elevated expression of DNMT3B that is critical for promoter methylation and
  decreases the expression of TIMP3. As a result, the expression of STAT1 was increased,
  and it inhibits the expression of FOXO1, leading to proliferation, migration, and
  invasion of breast cancer cells'
