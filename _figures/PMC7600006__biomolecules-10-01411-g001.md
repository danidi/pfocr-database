caption: The biosynthetic pathway of oleandomycin. (A) OleP is active during the final
  steps of the biosynthesis of the antibiotic oleandomycin, where it catalyzes a reaction
  of epoxidation at the C8-C8a bond of the macrolactone ring. According to Gaisser
  et al. [], OleP may introduce the epoxide function both to the aglycone and to the
  C3-monoglycosylated intermediates, splitting the process into two parallel pathways.
  In the figure, the pathways are distinguished by continuous and dotted arrows, respectively
  representing the epoxidation occurring on the aglycone intermediate DEO and the
  one performed on the monoglycosylated L-O-DEO. (B) The chemical structure of 6DEB
  and L-rhamnose are reported. A black square indicates the different substituent
  group at C13 of 6DEB with respect to DEO.
