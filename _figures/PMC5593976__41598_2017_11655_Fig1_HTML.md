caption: Diagrammatic illustration of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and
  O-GlcNAcylation. GlcNAc, generated from HBP, is added to a protein on serine (S)
  and threonine (T) residues by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). This process can be inhibited
  by ST045849. GlcNAc can be removed from the protein by O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which
  can be inhibited by Tiamet-G. P, phosphate. UDP, uridine diphosphate.
