caption: 'Example of a shortest path in a metabolic reaction network and a metabolic
  correlation network. The transformation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate in glycolysis
  is represented by one connection in the pathway network. In this example of a sparsely
  connected but non-fragmented correlation network (parameter constellation: sampling
  point 0.5 h light, ω = 8 and κ = 0.85) the shortest path between this pair of metabolites
  consists of 5 links (numbers next to the links denote the individual correlation
  strength of the involved metabolite pairs; here, the correlation strength between
  glucose and glucose-6-phosphate is 0.13.). The deviation of path lengths shown in
  this example just demonstrates the possible structural differences within these
  networks.'
