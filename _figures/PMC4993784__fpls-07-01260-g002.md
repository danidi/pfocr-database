caption: Scheme of the SL signaling pathway. (A) Expression of transcription factors
  (TFs) from the TCP family is repressed in the absence of SLs. (B) SL molecules are
  recognized by the SL receptor D14/DAD2. (C) The receptor hydrolyses SL molecules
  resulting in conformation changes of the D14/DAD2 protein. (D) In presence of SLs,
  the receptor with altered conformation is able to bind the F-box protein (MAX2/D3)
  from the SCF complex and the SL repressor (D53/SMXL6 to 8). (E) The repressor is
  degraded in the proteasome, also receptor is destabilized because of its changed
  conformation. (F) Degradation of repressor allows the expression of TFs from the
  TCP family. (G) List of identified components of the SLs signaling pathway in rice
  and A. thaliana.
