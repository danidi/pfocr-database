caption: An overview of the signalling pathways mediated by TNF-α in metastasis. The
  TNF-α induces protein stabilisation of Snail and β-catenin by inhibiting GSK-3β-mediated
  phosphorylation through NF-κB and Akt signalling pathways. It also induces CSN2
  expression through a NF-κB-dependent pathway. Together, these signalling events
  contribute to EMT induction and invasion in tumour cells.
