caption: Phenotypic response of microglia on dietary fatty acid exposure. Spreading
  of Tau between the neurons in tauopathies is a major concern to address that increases
  the disease progression. The aggregated species of Tau, prudentially oligomer species
  of misfolded aggregated Tau, show more propagation in the brain environment and
  found to be more toxic. The phenotype of microglia driven by omega-3 fatty acids
  could be used as a therapeutic strategy to prevent the propagation of extracellular
  Tau in tauopathies. Microglia has ramified morphology in surveillant mode, and they
  significantly express Fc receptors, P2Y6R, β-2 integrins, and PRRs including RAGE
  and TLRs. Ramified state is maintained through inhibitory signal through interaction
  of CD200-CD200R, CD22-CD45, and CX3CL1-CX3CR1. Saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid,
  stearic acid) triggers TLR-4 signaling leading to increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine
  production (TNF-α); omega-6 fatty acid (arachidonic acid) activating the pathway
  of PKCδ causes phosphorylation of Tau increasing the aggregation of protein in cells.
  Thus, it favors inflammatory phenotype and also enhances aggregation of Tau in AD,
  whereas unsaturated omega-3 fatty acids trigger phagocytic response through TREM2
  that recognizes apoptotic bodies and further activates ERK pathway to increase the
  clearance of apoptotic bodies. P2Y6R receptors interact with UDP released from dead
  neuron (act as an eat-me signal), which increases phagocytosis of debris, accumulated
  proteins, and pathogens. This is also indicated by increase in expression of Arginase-1
  (Arg-1) and chitinase-like-3 (Ym1) and increases anti-inflammatory cytokine production
  (TGF-β, IL-4). Along with their anti-inflammatory properties, they also regulate
  wound healing through Arg-1 and Ym1. Therefore, omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids
  favor anti-inflammatory phenotype that can mediate clearance of extracellular Tau
  in tauopathies
