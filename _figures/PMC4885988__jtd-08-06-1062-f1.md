caption: 'The critical role of thiamine in carbohydrate metabolism and its connection
  with GSH (reduced glutathione) generation. Thiamine, through TPP, is an indispensable
  cofactor for PDH without which the entry into the Krebs cycle is blocked that leads
  to lactate accumulation. TPP is also an essential cofactor of the enzymes: α-KDH
  for conversion of (α-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA in the Krebs cycle, and Transketolase
  in the pentose phosphate pathway for regeneration of GSH from oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG) and energy production. LDH, lactate dehydrogenase. TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; α-KDH, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.'
