caption: (A) A significant positive correlation was observed between osteoclast activity
  and cartilage degeneration. A significant negative correlation was observed between
  osteoclast activity and subchondral bone recovery. Subchondral bone recovery negatively
  correlated with cartilage degeneration. (B) Proposed molecular mechanism of knee
  loading suppresses osteoclastogenesis by Wnt signaling pathway.
