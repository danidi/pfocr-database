caption: Vitamin B6 salvage pathway in E. coli. Biosynthesis of PLP via the DXP-dependent
  pathway and salvage of B6 vitamers are schematically shown. Pyridoxine 5′-phosphate
  synthase (PdxJ) catalyzes the condensation of DXP with 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone
  phosphate to form pyridoxine 5′-phosphate (PNP) in de novo synthesis. PLP can be
  formed from PNP or PMP by pyridoxine/pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate oxidase (PdxH). PdxK
  can phosphorylate the three B6 vitamers, pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxamine (PM), and
  pyridoxal (PL), allowing PLP to be salvaged from the environment by the routes depicted.
  PdxY contributes to the phosphorylation of PL only. In addition, amino acid transaminases
  convert PMP to PLP and vice versa during their catalytic cycle. Some phosphatases,
  including YbhA and PhoA, can dephosphorylate PLP. There is currently little information
  about the bacterial vitamin B6 transporter(s). This study demonstrated that PdxI
  contributes to PL salvage and catalyzes the irreversible conversion of PL to PN
  under physiological conditions. Known or identified pathways are shown in solid
  arrows. Broken arrows indicate unidentified/missing pathways.
