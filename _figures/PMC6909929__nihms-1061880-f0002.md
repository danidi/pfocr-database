caption: Proposed model of myostatin inhibition leading to beneficial muscle growth
  and adipocyte beige phenotypeInhibition or reduced myostatin increases PGC-1 levels
  and the activity of AMPK, resulting in the increased expression of the myokine,
  irisin. Irisin is released into circulation inducing a beige adipocyte phenotype
  and increasing skeletal muscle IGF-1 expression and decreasing myotatin expression
  via the extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) pathway to promote muscle growth.
