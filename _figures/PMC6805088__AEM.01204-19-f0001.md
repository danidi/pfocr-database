caption: Simplified steroid degradation pathway in Comamonas testosteroni TA441 (the
  metabolites and reactions focused on in this study are shown in detail; the whole
  degradation pathway is presented in Fig. S1). Structures of the compounds named
  in parentheses are based on speculation. R1 (C-12)/R2 (C-7) is a hydroxyl moiety
  when the initial steroid has a hydroxyl moiety at the corresponding position (e.g.,
  cholic acid). ScdG converts I-CoA ester to II-CoA ester, but it is not indispensable.
  ScdG is indispensable for conversion of VI-CoA ester. The compounds are 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione
