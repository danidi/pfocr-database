caption: Schematic depicting ghrelin’s proposed effect on contact dermatitis and psoriasis.
  TNF-α binds to TNFR, which activates IKK to phosphorylate and degrade IκBα. This
  change results in activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, causing the secretion
  of proinflammatory cytokines and subsequent inflammation. Ghrelin exerts its effects
  through binding to GHSR1a, followed by antagonizing TNF-α, resulting in suppression
  of NF-κB signaling. This signaling pathway represents a potential therapeutic method
  for both contact dermatitis and psoriasis.
