caption: Oncogenic function of the MAPK signaling pathway. Genetic aberrations in
  this pathway are found in a vast majority of melanomas, with driver mutations in
  BRAF (V600E or V600K) occurring most often. The activation of BRAF results into
  phosphorylation of MEK and the activation of downstream MAP kinases like ERK. The
  pathway co-regulates tumor cell proliferation and cell survival; inhibition of BRAF
  downregulates the oncogenic function of MAPK signaling []. However, resistance to
  BRAF therapy is observed in about 50% of BRAF-mutated patients within 6–7 months
  after start of therapy. The CRAF-mediated reactivation of MAPK signaling pathway
  can be effectively blocked by the additional use of a MEK inhibitor (combined BRAF-MEK
  blockade), prolonging time to resistance development considerably. Consequently,
  anti-BRAF directed monotherapy is no longer used today. Figure adapted from Jenkins
  RW [] and created byGellrich FF.
