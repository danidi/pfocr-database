caption: 'Notch-targeting therapeutic approaches in TNBCs. (a) The canonical Notch
  signaling pathway: ligand binding promotes sequential cleavages of the Notch receptors
  (Notch1-4) by ADAM enzyme and γ-secretase complex, resulting in the release of NICD,
  which translocates in the nucleus, interacts with transcriptional regulators to
  transcriptionally activate the canonical Notch target genes (ON), thus leading to
  the regulation of TNBC growth and progression. (b) Notch inhibitors with lower or
  absent selectivity, respectively, include mAbs targeting the Notch ligands and GSIs.
  (1) mAbs against Notch ligands prevent ligand-receptor interaction and the subsequent
  Notch cleavages, preventing Notch signaling triggering. Little is known about the
  specific Notch-ligand relationship in TNBC; thus further studies are needed to consider
  ligand blocking as a potential alternative selective approach in TNBC treatment.
  (2) GSIs act as pan-Notch inhibitors since they prevent the cleavage of all Notch
  receptors, thus avoiding the release of any NICD. This unselective mechanism of
  action is strongly correlated with a high intestinal toxicity in patients, which
  significantly impairs their clinical use. (3) Lower doses of GSIs used in combination
  with chemotherapeutic drugs result in improved clinical outcome and less toxicity,
  which however must be overcome. (c) A higher selectivity can be obtained by using
  monoclonal antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of a specific Notch
  receptor (1): mAbs mask the cleavage domain of ADAM, thus preventing the binding
  of this enzyme and the subsequent γ-secretase cleavage. The final effect will depend
  on the specific block of the single Notch receptor, also used in combination with
  chemotherapeutic drugs (2). Several studies detailed in the text have suggested
  that a greater selectivity in the Notch inhibition approach for TNBCs treatment
  is strongly correlated with a higher probability of success in favoring tumor regression,
  associated with less toxicity and therefore with a potential better prognosis of
  TNBC-bearing patients. Abbreviations. ADAM: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase;
