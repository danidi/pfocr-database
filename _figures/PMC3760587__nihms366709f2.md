caption: Summary of major signal transduction pathways downstream of chemokine receptors.
  This simplified figure depicts signaling molecules activated following chemokine
  receptor activation. The binding of chemokines to their respective receptors results
  in the activation of three main downstream signaling pathways to various cellular
  responses. The classical G-protein pathway activates various downstream systems
  including PLC, PI3K, FAK and MAPK, leading to cell adhesion, polarization and chemotaxis.
  Inactivating Giα using PTX can be inhibite this pathway. The activation of the JAK/STAT
  pathway being initiated following the tyrosine phosphorylation of activated chemokine
  receptors has been documented. The signaling pathways initiated by phosphorylation
  at serine/threonine residues on the COOH-terminus region involve the activities
  of GRKs and β-arrestins. This pathway is responsible for internalization and recycling/degradation
  of the activated receptors. Arrows indicate “activated downstream”. Question marks
  indicate unclear downstream signaling pathways. FAK focal adhesion kinase, PLC phospholipase
  C, PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, MAPK mitogen-activated protein kinase, PTX
  pertussis toxin, JAK/STAT Janus kinase/Signal transducer and activator of transcription,
  GRKs G-protein-coupled receptor kinases.
