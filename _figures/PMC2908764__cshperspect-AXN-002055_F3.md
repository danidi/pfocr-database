caption: Molecular cues controlling the pathway choices at the Drosophila and vertebrate
  midline. (A) Comm regulates Robo1 trafficking and midline crossing. Model for the
  sorting action of Comm on Robo1; inset to the left shows enlarged view of the boxed
  region. In an ipsilateral neuron (top), Comm is absent and Robo1 is inserted into
  the growth cone, ensuring midline repulsion by Slit. In a commissural neuron (middle),
  Comm is present and diverts Robo1 to the endosomes, making the growth cone insensitive
  to Slit. After crossing (bottom), Comm is reduced and Robo1 begins to accumulate
  in the contralateral axon segment, potentially preventing the growth cone from crossing
  again. (Adapted from .) (B) The Slit/Robo and Sema3B, 3F/Neuropilin2 systems control
  midline guidance. Robo3.1 (Rig-1), an inhibitor of Robo1 and 2, is required for
  commissural axons to cross the midline. In the absence of Robo3.1, no commissural
  axons are able to cross the floor plate, because Slits in the midline repel commissural
  axons. After entering the floor plate, commissural axons acquire a repulsive response
  to Sema3B (in the floor plate), Sema3F (in the ventral spinal cord gray matter)
  and Slits (in the floor plate and ventral spinal cord gray matter), which turn their
  trajectory into a longitudinal one. The stem cell factor in the floor plate promotes
  the growth of commissural axons via the Kit receptor to allow axons to cross the
  midline in this highly repulsive environment.
