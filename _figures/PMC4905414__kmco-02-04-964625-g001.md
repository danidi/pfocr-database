caption: Simplified model for phosphatidylserine receptor-mediated efferocytosis.
  Apoptotic cells display various ‘eat me’ signals like phosphatidylserine (PS) on
  the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane that are recognized directly or indirectly
  (via bridging molecules such as Gas6) by different phagocytic PS receptors, including
  BAI1, TAMs, Stabilin1/2, TIM1/4, and CD300 family members, such as human CD300A
  or mouse Cd300lb and Cd300lf. The CD300 receptor family consists of both activating
  and inhibitory receptors. Inhibitory receptors, like CD300A, harbor immune-receptor
  tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) within their intracellular tail to regulate
  signaling events. Cd300lf functions as an activating receptor via the PI3K pathway
  or as an inhibitory receptor, depending on cell type. The activating receptor Cd300lb
  requires binding to an adaptor protein, such as DAP12, to gain signaling capacity
  and regulates efferocytosis via the DAP12-Syk-PI3K-AKT pathway. BAI1, brain-specific
  angiogenesis inhibitor 1; DAP12, DNAX activation protein of 12 kDa; Gas6, growth
  arrest-specific 6; TAM, Tyro3, Axl, and MerTK receptor tyrosine kinase; TIM1/4,
  T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 1 and 4.
