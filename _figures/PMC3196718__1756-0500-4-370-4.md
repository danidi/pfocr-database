caption: 'Network of upregulated genes in C2C12 cells treated with rhBMP2 and rhBMP7
  using the STRING 9.0 pathway analyzer. STRING 9.0 is a database of known and predicted
  protein interactions. The interactions may be physically direct or indirect (functional).
  The list of protein names are inserted as input and the organism to be analyzed
  is selected in a user-friendly web-browser interface. The network, composed of the
  uploaded proteins, is constructed based on four different sources: genomic context,
  high-throughput experiments, co-expression and scientific reports (http://string-db.org/).
  The upregulated genes found in each group (C2C12 cells treated with rhBMP7 or rhBMP2)
  were matched and classified according to a pre-described interaction (activation,
  repression, or predicted interaction). The circles represent the genes and the blue
  edges represent the interaction between them. The edges are based on proteins being
  co-mentioned in scientific publications as well as their association in curated
  databases. The edge thickness is directly proportional to the degree of evidence
  available, with lack of evidence for interactions in the literature being represented
  as no edges among the genes. Runx2: Runt Related Transcription factor 2; Dlx1/2/5:
