caption: The partial mechanisms of multisite radiotherapy combined with immune checkpoint
  inhibitors (ICIs) and biological response modifiers (GM-CSF or IL-2). Radiotherapy
  induces immunogenic cell death (ICD), which exposes and releases danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs) like calreticulin, HMGB1, ATP, ANAX1, and similar ().
  cGAS-STING pathway is activated by the cytolytic double-strand DNA and results in
  the release of IFN-I (). Radiation can also generate tumor neoantigens. Multisite
  radiotherapy can overcome the insufficient tumor-associated antigen (TAA) exposure
  caused by tumor heterogeneity (). ICDs can recruit antigen-presenting cells (APC)
  like dendritic cells (DC). APCs can take up antigens and further be activated, which
  can be augmented by GM-CSF. DCs then migrate to lymph nodes, presenting antigens
  to T cells and prime a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated immune activation (,
  ). The activated CTLs initiate clonal proliferation and then travel to the irradiated
  lesions or distant tumor sites, exerting killing effects. The cytokine IL-2 is essential
  for the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of T cells (). CTLA-4 antibody,
  PD-1 antibody, and PD-L1 antibody, known as ICIs, can increase CTL activation and
  boost the synergistic anti-tumor effects.
