caption: The HK QseC detects Epi and NE made by the host, as well as AI-3 produced
  by the EHEC enzyme TDH. Binding of these molecules to the HK enables QseC to control
  the activity of the 3 RRs KdpE, QseB, and QseF, which results in regulation of downstream
  virulence genes. AI-3, autoinducer-3; EHEC, enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7;
  Epi, epinephrine; HK, histidine kinase; NE, norepinephrine; RRs, response regulator;
  TDH, threonine dehydrogenase. Created with BioRender.com.
