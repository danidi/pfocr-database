caption: Hypothetical model of PARK7 enhancing antioxidative‐stress processes in BMSCs.
  A hallmark of oxidative stress is excessive production of ROS. PARK7 promotes the
  phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 is then transferred
  to the nucleus, which phosphorylates the downstream effector, Elk1. Phosphorylated
  Elk1 then promotes the expression of antioxidative enzymes, such as SOD. Antioxidative
  proteins, such as PARK7 and SOD, then eliminate excessive intracellular ROS, thereby
  promoting the survival of BMSCs under oxidative‐stress conditions. BMSC, bone marrow‐derived
  mesenchymal stem cell; Elk1, ETS domain‐containing protein Elk‐1;ERK1/2, extracellular
  signal‐regulated kinase 1/2; MEK1/2,  MAP kinase‐ERK kinase; PARK7, Parkinson's
  disease protein 7; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase
