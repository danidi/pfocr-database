caption: A normal gas exchange between the alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood is
  achieved through a passive diffusion of O2 and CO2. During SARS-CoV-2 infection,
  increased IFN-β and IFN-γ activate the AhR pathway, leading to the expression of
  mucins in alveolar epithelial cells. Mucins then stick to the blood–gas barrier
  and increase the thickness. Thickened barrier hinders O2 crossing but not CO2 at
  the beginning, leading to a clinical symptom of silent hypoxia. Companying the disease
  progression, more mucin production in combination with inflammation-induced exudate
  further increases barrier thickness, impeding the exchange of both O2 and CO2, leading
  to a critical illness. “–”, normal level.
