caption: Beneficial Effects of Extracellular Vesicles on Vascular FunctionAn increasing
  body of evidence points out the beneficial influence of certain EVs of diverse cellular
  sources in cardiovascular biology. This figure illustrates the favorable effects
  of EVs on endothelial and vascular function, atherosclerosis, and plaque stabilization.
  Endothelial EVs reduce endothelial apoptosis by inhibition of p38 activity mediated
  by an annexin I/phosphatidylserine receptor-dependent mechanism, contributing to
  endothelial protection. Moreover, endothelial EVs decrease endothelial regenerating
  cell apoptosis, facilitating endothelial repair. Platelet-derived MVs induce alterations
  in the endothelial-regenerating cell secretome toward a more proangiogenic profile
  and amplify vascular protection. Among the biological content transferred by EVs
  into target cells, miRNAs play a crucial role. Endothelial EVs promote vascular
  endothelial repair by inhibition of SPRED1 by delivering functional miRNA-126. Endothelial
  EVs promote anti-inflammatory effects by reducing endothelial ICAM-1 expression
  by the transfer of functional miRNA-222 into recipient cells. Exosomes from KLF-2-transduced
  or shear-stress-stimulated endothelial cells attribute to atheroprotection by transferring
  miRNA-143/145. Circulating leukocyte- and platelet-derived miRNA-223-containing
  exosomes penetrate the vascular wall, inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation
  and migration, resulting in decreased plaque size. Endothelial apoptotic bodies
  decrease vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, limit plaque size, and increase
  plaque stability by miRNA-126-dependent inhibition of G-protein signaling (RGS16)
  pathway. MV = microvesicle; other abbreviations as in  and .
