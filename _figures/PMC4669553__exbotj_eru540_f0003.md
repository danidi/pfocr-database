caption: Comprehensive schematic of PLD–PA involvement in lipid metabolism and signalling
  and impact on SA biosynthesis and signalling in plant defence. In the chloroplast,
  many enzymes such as stearoyl acyl carrier protein desaturase (SSI2) are involved
  in the biosynthesis of C16:0 to 18:1 fatty acids. Many plastidic enzymes such as
  allene oxide synthase (AOS), α-dioxygenase (α-DOX), ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY1
  (EDS1), fatty acid hydroxylase (FAH), hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), hydroperoxide reductase
  (HPR), lipoxygenase (LOX), and peroxygenase (POX) are involved in the biosynthesis
  of oxylipins including jasmonic acid (JA) and azelaic acid from oxidation of polyunsaturated
  fatty acids. JA is also generated from the action of phospholipase A (PLA) hydrolysis
  of plastidic membrane galactolipids such as monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG),
  digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). JA and other oxylipins
  could activate induced system resistance (ISR) through CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1
  (COI1) receptor, SCFCOI1/JAZ/MYC complex signal transduction. Plastidic synthesis
  of salicylic acid (SA) through shikimate pathway is transported into the cytosol,
  where SA activates NPR1 to trigger NPR1 translocation into the nucleus to activate
  systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The fatty acid desaturases (FADs) such as FAD6
  and FAD7/FAD8 modifying the fatty acyl chains (18:1 to 18:2 and 18:3) of galactolipids
  (GLs) also affect plant disease resistance by modifying JA- and SA-dependent or
  independent signalling pathways. The prokaryotic pathway of glycerolipid biosynthesis
  in the plastid is through acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) by G3P acyltransferase
  (ATS1) to give lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), PA, MGDG and DGDG. G3P can be transported
  into the chloroplast and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) from the cytosol. The cytosolic
  G3P synthesis by glycerokinase (GK), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (SFD1),
  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is also implicated in plant
  responses to pathogen attack. GAPDH is one of the targets of phospholipase D (PLDδ)
  and PA. PLA, PLD, or phospholipase C (PLC)/diglycerol kinase (DGK) could hydrolyse
  the oxidized acyl chain- or oxylipin-containing glycerolipids to release JA/oxylipins,
  which could induce JA-dependent defence signalling and responses. The fatty acyl
  CoAs synthesized in the plastid are transported out to form a cytosolic pool, supplying
  precursors for biosynthesis of neutral lipids and phospholipids in the ER. As the
  important precursors, PAs are involved in biosynthesis and turnover of phospholipids
  and the neutral lipids diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG). PA synthesis
  and metabolism through lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase (PLAAT), phosphatidic
  acid phosphatase (PAP), ATS1, PLD, PLC, and DGK also affect plant defence. PA from
  the ER can also be transported into the plastid through trigalactosyldiacylglycerols
  (TGDs) and the TGD4 transport complex to provide precursors for biosynthesis of
  chloroplastic glycerolipids. PA can affect JA biosynthesis in multiple ways. SA
  biosynthesis from the shikimate pathways may interact with JA and PA signalling
  by an unknown mechanism.
