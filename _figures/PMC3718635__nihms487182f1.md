caption: 'Multiple signaling pathways have been implicated in driving mitochondrial
  decline with age. Besides reduced activity of the PGC/ERRα network (see text) Angiotensin
  II has been suggested to play a role as activation of the Angiotensin receptor type
  I (AT-1) impairs mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial respiratory chain activity
  and deletion of the AT-1 in mice is associated with increased number of mitochondria,
  decreased ROS induced oxidative damage, and improved cardiac function. Elevated
  norepinephrine and activation of β-adrenergic receptors in the heart increases ROS,
  impairs mitochondrial function and deletion of AC5 (the predominant isoform of adenyl
  cyclase in the heart), and protects from oxidative stress through activation of
  the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. Similarly, β-receptor blockade with carvedilol
  reduces oxidative stress levels in the heart., The insulin/IGF-1 pathway has been
  suggested to play a protective role, based on findings in mice deficient for either
  the insulin (CIRKO), the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), or both receptors
  (MI2RKO)., These mice have varying degrees of reduced oxidative phosphorylation
  with decreased ATP generation, increased ROS, reduced tricarboxylic acid cycle and
  fatty acid oxidation genes, and impaired cardiac function. Of the 7 mammalian sirtuins,
  Sirtuin 1 and Sirtuin 3 have been particularly implicated in delaying cardiac aging
  and protecting from oxidative stress. Illustration credit: Cosmocyte/Ben Smith.'
