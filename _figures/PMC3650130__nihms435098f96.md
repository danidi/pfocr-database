caption: Recently, Zhang et al. also developed the Rh(I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization/carbonylation
  cascade transformation of 1-(1-alkynyl) cyclopropyl ketones 2-304 into the corresponding
  polysubstituted furans 2-307. Mechanistically, this reaction begins with a regioselective
  oxidative addition of the Rh(I) complex into the C1–C2 bond of a cyclopropane to
  generate rhodacyclobutane 2-305 that undergoes cyclization into a fused furan-derived
  rhodacyclopentane 2-306. Subsequent carbonylation and reductive elimination of the
  Rh(I) catalyst processes gives furan 2-307 (). Using this method, a variety of substituted
  C3–C4-fused bicyclic furans bearing different functional groups could be obtained
  in good to excellent yields. Interestingly, the configuration of a substituted cyclopropane
  ring dramatically affects the reaction pathway. Thus, the cycloisomerization of
  (1R*,2R*)-trans-2-304 yields normal carbonylation products 2-307, whereas the reaction
  of (1R*,2S*)-cis isomers 2-308 produces C3-allyl-substituted furan 2-311. Apparently,
  in the latter case, the initially formed rhodacyclobutane 2-309 undergoes β-hydride
  elimination/reductive elimination to produce allenyl ketone 2-310. A subsequent
  Rh(I)-catalyzed cycloisomerization of 2-310 gives furan 2-311 ().
