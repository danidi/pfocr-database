caption: Conservation of the Ral-centered signaling network in mammals and flies.
  Black arrows reflect protein-protein interactions as deciphered mainly by two-hybrid
  assays in the present study and elsewhere (see text for references). Gray arrows
  reflect functional data obtained in various mammalian cell lines and genetic interactions
  in Drosophila. In flies, the white arrow between Ras and RGL reflects a genetic
  interaction that does not fit with a linear functional path from one to the other.
  Preliminary data suggest a genetic interaction between fly Ral and RLIP. In mammals,
  a linear pathway goes from Ras to Ral, with no intervention of Rap, whereas in flies,
  Rap seems to activate a Ral pathway that interacts with Ras. In flies, dotted arrows
  reflect that the observed Ras-Rgl/Ral genetic interaction might be accounted for
  by the convergence of the Ras and the Ral pathways, with Ras using an effector that
  does not discriminate between the three effector loop mutations used in this work.
