caption: 'Changes in metabolism in Prx1-Cre; PORlox/lox limb bud cells and levels
  of cholesterol. (A) Cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (see also Table S2 in the supplemental
  material). Upregulated enzymes in CKO forelimb buds are shown (red). Note that Cyp51
  as a POR-dependent enzyme is nonfunctional despite being upregulated. (B) POR deficiency
  on a cellular level based on microarray results. Colors: cholesterol metabolic pathway,
  red; cholesterol, red hexagons; cholesterol transport, yellow; retinoic acid metabolic
  pathway, green; transcription factors, blue. (C) Cholesterol quantification in E13.5
  limb buds. CKO forelimbs show reduced cholesterol levels compared to controls Values
  were calculated per limb bud and represent the mean of three embryos. (D) Rescue
  experiment. To try and rescue the phenotype, dams were given a diet enriched with
  2% cholesterol. Embryos were prepared at E14.5 and stained for cartilage. Splaying
  between digits 3 and 4 was reduced (compare to Fig. ).'
