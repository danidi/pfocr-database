caption: Srs2 removes toxic Rad51 filaments by translocating on ss-DNA. In response
  to a DSB, Cdk1 targets Srs2 helicase to dismantle the D-loops, thus allowing SDSA
  pathway that limits DNA exchanges. When Srs2 phosphorylation is prevented, unscheduled
  sumoylation takes over and the DSB is channeled into the Slx5-dependent pathway.
