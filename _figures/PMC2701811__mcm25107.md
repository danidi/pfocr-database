caption: 'Genetic control of the RAM maintenance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Cellular
  compartments are depicted in squares and not drawn to scale, and some major cellular
  processes are shown in ovals. Collective activity of PIN auxin efflux carriers is
  essential for the stabilization of auxin response maximum in the root tip, which
  is necessary for QC establishment. Transcription factor genes SCR, SHR, PLT1, PLT2
  and WOX5 are involved in the establishment and conservation of QC identity. The
  RBR pathway participates in control of initial cell activity. Cell proliferation
  in the rest of the RAM is maintained by cell cycle machinery: its defects, for example,
  the hbt mutations, results in differentiation of the root tip cells. Glutathione
  is specifically required for cell divisions in the RAM, as evidenced by the phenotype
  of the rml1 mutant. A phenotype of hlr mutant evidences an importance for the RAM
  maintenance of 26S proteasome-mediated protein degradation, which could be in part
  explained by its involvement in auxin response. Possible participation of ABA signal
  transduction pathway in RAM maintenance is suggested from the phenotype of abi8
  mutants. Cell differentiation is inhibited in proliferating cells. Cytokinins control
  the RAM size by promoting transition of cells from proliferation to elongation specifically
  at the distal part of the elongation zone (transition zone). Loss-of-function mutations
  in genes essential for QC identity and cell proliferation lead to RAM exhaustion
  and determinate root growth.'
