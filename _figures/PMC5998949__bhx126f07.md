caption: 'Proposed substrates for LTP in the LPP. Glutamate released during bursts
  of high-frequency gamma activity binds to mGluR5 receptors resulting in activation
  of the enzyme DAGL-α and the synthesis of 2-AG. The ECB diffuses from the postsynaptic
  compartment to CB1Rs located on LPP terminals where it is degraded by MGL. CB1Rs
  initiate 2 signaling cascades. The first (#1) which is depressed by pregnenolone
  (pregn), engages ERK leading to phosphorylation and degradation of the vesicle protein
  Munc18-1. This depresses vesicle-membrane fusion and glutamate release. The second
  (#2) CB1R pathway stimulates integrin-associated FAK, which targets small GTPases
  (RhoA) and ROCK. CB1R signaling is biased toward pathway #1 in the S–C projection
  in CA1 but toward pathway #2 in the LPP. Related to this, the Munc18-1 route does
  not contribute to lppLTP while the FAK route is necessary but not sufficient for
  production of lppLTP. Expression of this atypical LPP potentiation also requires
  activation of a subclass (nonRGD) of β1 integrins by high-frequency afferent activity.
  It is proposed that ligands for these presynaptic integrins are generated by NMDAR
  activation, associated increases in postsynaptic calcium, and the release of unspecified
  factors (“??”) that activate extracellular MMPs. The latter generate matrix protein
  fragments that bind to the integrins and contribute to their activation. Integrins,
  in conjunction with CB1R, signal to FAK and separately engage a second, homologous
  kinase (Pyk2). The tyrosine kinases then activate small GTPases and their downstream
  effectors (ROCK, etc.) along with other actin signaling events (“??”) leading to
  reorganization of the presynaptic cytoskeleton (dashed horizontal line). This results
  in enhanced glutamate release probability by improved vesicle docking.'
