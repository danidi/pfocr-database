caption: Strategies for miR modulation within the miR pathway. (A) miR biogenesis.
  After transcription, the primary miR (pri-miR) is processed by Drosha into a 70
  bp long precursor miR (pre-miR) and then transported into the cytoplasm by exportin
  5. Cleavage by DICER leads to a double stranded miR/miR* from which one strand will
  be incorporated into the RISC complex (miRISC). Complementary binding to the corresponding
  mRNA will further lead to mRNA degradation whereas imperfect binding will lead to
  translational repression; (B) miR inhibition strategies. Down-regulation of miRs
  can be achieved by anti-miRs (e.g., AMOs), single stranded RNAs, which can bind
  to the mature miRNA or through miR-sponges, which contain several miR binding sites
  leading to a competitive inhibition of miRs; (C) miR mimics. Up-regulation or restoration
  of a miR can be achieved through virus-based or nanoparticle delivery of double
  stranded miRs.
