caption: 'Proposed model for the regulatory role of methenyl-dH4MPT in methylotrophic
  metabolism in M. extorquens AM1. When methanol availability increases, the carbon
  flux to the methylotrophic oxidation pathway upshifts and methenyl-dH4MPT accumulates,
  inhibiting production of methylene-H4F and, thus, assimilatory metabolism. Formate
  utilization shifts to oxidative metabolism, producing more CO2. Upregulation of
  the assimilation cycles increases gradually over time. The genes involved in the
  reactions of the metabolic pathway are indicated next to the arrows. Abbreviations:
  dH4MPT, dephosphotetrahydromethanopterin; H4F, tetrahydrofolate; PGA, phosphoglyceric
  acid; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; OAA, oxaloacetate. The fae gene product is formaldehyde-activating
  enzyme, the mtdB and mtdA gene products are the methylene-tetrahydromethanopterin
  dehydrogenases MtdA and MtdB, the mch gene product is methenyl-dH4MPT cyclohydrolase,
  the fhc gene product is the formyltransferase/hydrolase complex, the fdh gene products
  are formate dehydrogenases, the ftfL gene product is formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase,
  and the fch gene product is methenyl-H4F cyclohydrolase. The major assimilation
  cycle, the serine cycle, is also depicted. The glyA gene product is serine hydroxymethyl
  transferase, the sga gene product is serine glyoxylate aminotransferase, the hpr
  gene product is hydroxypyruvate reductase, the gck gene product is glycerate kinase,
  the eno gene product is enolase, the ppc gene product is PEP carboxylase, the mdh
  gene product is malate dehydrogenase, the mtkAB gene products are malate thiokinases
  A and B, and the mclA gene product is malyl-CoA/β-methylmalyl-CoA lyase.'
