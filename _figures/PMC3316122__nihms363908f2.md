caption: A schematic model depicting activation of the AIM2 inflammasome by F. tularensis
  infection. The bacteria enter macrophages through phagocytosis. Shortly after, the
  phagosome rapidly acidifies and ruptures releasing the phagocytosed bacteria and
  some bacterially derived DNA from lysed bacteria. This released DNA activates IRF3
  by an as yet uncharacterized mechanism, which transcriptionally induces production
  of type I interferons. The newly synthesized type I interferons somehow enhance
  activation of the AIM2 inflammasome through an autocrine signaling pathway involving
  IFNAR1. The released DNA can also bind to the HIN-200 DNA-binding domain of AIM2.
  This interaction leads to oligomerization of AIM2 into a large AIM2 inflammasome
  cluster. The AIM2 inflammasome activates caspase-1 as described in , which in turn
  processes pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to the active cytokines, IL-1β and IL-18, which
  induce inflammation. The activated caspase-1 also cleaves a number of cellular proteins
  leading to pyroptotic cell death. The nature of the caspase-1 substrates that lead
  to pyroptotic cell death, however, is not yet known.
