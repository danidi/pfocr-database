caption: A, On the left, the Neurotrophin signaling pathway (modified from KEGG hsa04722),
  showing genes targeted by miRNAs (n = 15) involved in its modulation. Orange boxes,
  genes targeted by more than 1 miRNA; yellow boxes, genes targeted by 1 miRNA and
  in green, not targeted genes. The complete list of target genes is reported in .
  On the right, the graph showing interactions between miRNAs and related target genes
  involved in neuronal death. B, On the left, the PI3K‐Akt signaling pathway (modified
  from KEGG hsa04151), showing genes targeted by miRNAs (n = 16) involved in its modulation.
  Orange boxes, genes targeted by more than 1 miRNA; yellow boxes, genes targeted
