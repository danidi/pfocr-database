caption: Schematic representation of thyroid cancer hystotypes and their causative
  genetic events. Papillary (PTC), Follicular (FTC) and Anaplastic Thyroid carcinomas
  (ATC) originate from thyroid follicular cells. PTCs display BRAF (V600E substitution)
  and/or Rat Sarcoma (RAS) mutations as well as Rearrangement During Transfection
  (RET)/PTC rearrangements. FTCs present PPARc/Pax8 rearrangements, RAS, mutations
  and PTEN inactivating mutations or deletions. ATCs are characterized by PTEN and
  CTNNB1 mutations and p53 inactivation. Furthermore, ATCs may arise from FTCs and
  PTCs as a result of p53 loss of function, dysregulation of the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway
  or additional genetic alterations. Dashed lines indicate genes and mechanisms involved
  in progression to ATC.
