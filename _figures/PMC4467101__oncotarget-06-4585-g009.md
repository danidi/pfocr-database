caption: Activation of the PI3-kinase/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is known to converge
  on ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis. Thus, the therapeutic effects of
  PI3-kinase inhibitors and AKT inhibitors, may be explained by their ability to inhibit
  mTOR signaling and block protein synthesis in TICs. Similarly, direct pharmacological
  inhibition of protein synthesis and/or caloric restriction or protein restriction
  may have similar beneficial therapeutic effects. Thus, our current data provide
  a novel convergent mechanism by which inhibitors of PI3-kinase, AKT, mTOR, as well
  as caloric restriction, may all directly target tumor-initiating cells, by inhibiting
  protein synthesis.
