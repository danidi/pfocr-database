caption: The canonical Wnt (Wnt/β-catenin) signaling pathway (adapted from Ref. 84).
  (A) In the absence of an upstream inhibitory signal induced by Wnt ligands, the
  constitutively active serine/threonine protein kinase, glycogen synthase kinase
  3 (GSK3α or GSK3β), phosphorylates β-catenin on conserved serine or threonine residues
  near its amino terminus. This process depends on the formation of a large, multiprotein
  complex that includes the Axin protein and the product of the Adenomatous polyposis
  coli (APC) gene. Phosphorylation of β-catenin targets it for degradation through
  a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway. In addition, GSK3 activity also controls
  the activity of the tuberous sclerosis complex, consisting of the tuberin and harmartin
  proteins (encoded by the TSC1 and TSC2 genes, respectively). GSK3-mediated phosphorylation
  of TSC1 inhibits this complex, leading to downregulation of the small GTPase, Rheb.
  This, in turn, results in decreased activity of the mTOR complex (which is activated
  by Rheb-GTP). Because mTOR normally activates proteins that increase the cellular
  capacity for translational activity, the net effect of GSK3 activity in the context
  of canonical Wnt signaling is to downregulate both transcriptional (through β-catenin
  target genes) and translational (through mTOR regulation) activity. (B) In the presence
  of an upstream Wnt ligand, GSK3 activity is inhibited, leading to increased cytoplasmic
  levels of β-catenin, which enters the nucleus and activate transcription of target
  genes. In addition, inhibition of GSK3 also leads to activation of the mTOR pathway.
  A parallel pathway leads to the JNK2-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin, which
  facilitates nuclear localization. Thus, the net result of activation of canonical
  Wnt signaling is to coordinately increase both transcriptional (through increased
  activation of β-catenin target genes) and translational (through activation of mTOR)
  activation within cells. Activation of the pathway is normally constrained by the
  expression of proteins such as members of the Dickkopf family and sclerostin, which
  selectively bind to either Lrp5 or Lrp6, thereby blocking the ability of Wnt ligands
  to interact with these receptors. In addition, proteins of the secreted frizzled
  related protein (Sfrp) family can directly bind to Wnt ligands, offering another
  way to inhibit activation of the pathway.
