caption: A) In the presence of wild-type merlin, mutant RAS modestly increases MAPK
  signaling, which is insufficient to drive tumorigenesis (). Wild-type merlin blocks
  RAC1 activation, decreasing stimulatory input of PAK into CRAF and pMEK (). Merlin
  also activates the Hippo pathway, leading to phosphorylation of YAP and its retention
  in the cytoplasm. In the absence of nuclear YAP, TEAD is unable to induce transcription
  of wild-type and oncogenic RAS, restricting the magnitude of the oncogenic drive
  ().B) In Merlin-deficient cells the Hippo pathway is off (), allowing YAP to form
  transcriptionally active complexes with TEAD, leading to increased oncogenic and
  wild-type RAS gene expression. This, in concert with engagement of RAC1-PAK signaling
  (), leads to increased of MAPK output and promotion of tumorigenesis, while generating
  increased dependence on the pathway for viability.
