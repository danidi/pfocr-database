caption: DET1 suppresses FT and SOC1 expression through the photoperiod and autonomous
  pathways of flowering. In the photoperiod pathway, DET1 mainly represses flowering
  by modulating GI-mediated floral induction at the transcriptional and post-translational
  levels during daytime under SD. DET1 represses the function of daytime-expressed
  GI by preventing GI from binding to the FT promoter in a CO-independent pathway.
  In the autonomous pathway, DET1 interacts with MSI4/FVE and possibly modulates trimethylation
  of FLC chromatin to epigenetically induce FLC expression. Genes and proteins are
  represented as rectangles and ovals, respectively.
