caption: A model depicting interactions of putative nutrient and energy signaling
  components. The blue components are part of a network that, upon sensing nutrient
  and/or energy deficiency, restricts growth and promotes nutrient remobilization,
  survival and tolerance to stress. The pink components form a hypothetical antagonistic
  network that couples nutrient and/or energy availability with growth. In response
  to energy deprivation, SnRK1 orchestrates an energy-saving program through direct
  enzyme regulation and through extensive transcriptional reprogramming that involves
  at least the S-group bZIP (basic leucine zipper) transcription factors (TFs) [].
  SnRK1 response is blocked by sugars, partly through the product of hexokinase (HXK)
  activity, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) []. In addition to its catalytic role, HXK1
  has a distinct signaling function in the nucleus, where it regulates the expression
  of photosynthetic genes, among others [,]. HXK might act in a cooperative manner
  with the TOR (target of rapamycin) PK (protein kinase) in the growth-promoting network.
  As in mammals [], nutritional information might be conveyed to plant TOR through
  the PI3K/VPS34 protein []. In nutrient-rich conditions, mTOR (mammalian TOR) promotes
  growth partly through regulation of the translational machinery [] and blocks the
  translation-inhibitory pathway mediated by the amino-acid-deficiency-sensing GCN2
  PK. Similar functions seem to apply to the plant TOR [,] and to some extent to GCN2
  [,]. Plants could have evolved unique modes of interplay between the SnRK1 and TOR
  pathways. A scenario is proposed where various growth-promoting and growth-limiting
  pathways interact to regulate metabolism, stress tolerance and development in response
  to the environment and nutrient availability. Solid lines denote proven connections
  in plants, whereas broken lines represent connections described for other organisms
  that might or might not exist in plants.
