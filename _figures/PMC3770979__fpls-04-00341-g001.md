caption: Examples of interplays between SL and NO signaling in animal (A,B) and plant
  cells (C,D). (A) NO regulates Cer formation from sphingomyelin in a dose-dependent
  process. Low NO concentrations inhibit sphingomyelinase activity (SMase) leading
  to low Cer levels that are further degraded to sphingosine (Sph) by ceramidases.
  High NO concentrations stimulate SMase activities while inhibiting ceramidases,
  therefore leading to high Cer levels. This differential control of SMases by NO
  participates in Cer-dependent cell survival or death. (B) Cer formation indirectly
  triggers endothelial NOS (eNOS) activation and NO formation. Sphingosine-1P (S1P)
  is formed from Cer degradation and subsequent phosphorylation of Sph. S1P is externalized
  and perceived on the outer cell surface by specific S1P receptors (S1PR). Activated
  S1PR trigger eNOS activation via an increase of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and/or
  via the regulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. eNOS-evoked NO eventually
  down-regulates Cer-activated signaling pathways. (C) Complex SL (fungal cerebrosides),
  SL precursors (LCB), or SL analogs (AAL fungal toxin) act as potent inducers of
  NO formation. Such NO production might participate in specific aspects of SL-triggered
  cell death or defense responses. (D) Plant exposure to cold triggers the formation
  of NO that down-regulates the synthesis of phospho-SL (i.e., Cer-P and LCB-P). In
  addition, NO participates in the modification of membrane SL content resulting from
  low temperature exposure.
