caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for acu-dioxomorpholine A and B production.
  (A) The acu-dioxomorpholine gene cluster contains a nonribosomal peptide synthetase
  gene (adxA), an NAD(P)-dependent reductase gene (adxB), and a prenyltransferase
  gene (adxC). (B) AdxB catalyzes reduction of phenylpyruvate to form phenyllactate.
  AdxA dimerizes tryptophan and phenyllactate via an ester bond-forming condensation
  domain containing an unusual arginine active site (CR). The depsipeptide intermediate
  is released by cyclization catalyzed by AdxA-CT, resulting in the diketomorpholine.
  Reverse prenylation catalyzed by AdxC results in acu-dioxomorpholine A. An unidentified
  methyltransferase (proposed to not be in the BGC) affords acu-dioxomorpholine B.
