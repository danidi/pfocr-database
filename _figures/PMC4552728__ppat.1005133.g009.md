caption: 'In the presence of MB or other respiratory inhibitors, cellular ATP levels
  are low. Under these conditions, GTP-bound Ras1 is rapidly turned over to GDP-bound
  Ras1 in a Cyr1-Ira2 dependent manner repressing the input of filamentation inducing
  signals and hyphal formation does not occur (upper panel). Under control conditions
  (no inhibition) ATP levels are high due to efficient oxidative metabolism and slow
  growth. In the presence of inducing signals GTP-bound Ras1 can accumulate probably
  because Cyr1 does not stabilize the interaction of Ras1 with Ira2. GTP-Ras1 can
  now effectively bind to and activate Cyr1 resulting in filamentation (lower panel).
  MDPs: muramyl dipeptides; HCO3¯: bicarbonate.'
