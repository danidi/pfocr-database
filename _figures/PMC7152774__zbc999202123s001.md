caption: Overview of the heme synthesis pathway in yeast. Heme is synthesized from
  glycine and succinyl-CoA in a pathway initiated (Hem1, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase)
  and terminated inside mitochondria (Hem14, protoporphyrinogen oxidase; Hem15, ferrochelatase)
  with a number of intermediary reactions taking place in the cytosol (Hem2, ALA dehydratase;
  Hem3, porphobilinogen deaminase; Hem4, uroporphyrinogen III synthase; Hem12, uroporphyrinogen
  III decarboxylase; Hem13, coproporphyrinogen III oxidase). Heme can then be complexed
  in mitochondrial or cytosolic hemoproteins or act in signaling pathways. Deuteroporphyrin
  IX is an analogue of protoporphyrin IX that is much more soluble and stable and
  can be converted to deuteroheme (an analogue of heme) by the ferrochelatase enzyme
  but cannot be incorporated into hemoproteins.
