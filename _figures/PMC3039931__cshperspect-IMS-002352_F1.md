caption: Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases in the activating signaling pathways utilizing
  ITAM-containing adapters. Examples of immunoreceptors, hemi-ITAM C-type lectin receptors,
  and nonimmunoreceptors that utilize ITAM-signaling adapters and the cytoplasmic
  tyrosine kinases (indicated as shaded molecules) discussed in this article are shown.
  “Classical immunoreceptors” refers to those signaling molecules that are directly
  coupled to ITAM adapters FcRγ (group shown on the left) or DAP12 (group shown on
  the right) through transmembrane charged residues, shown as “+” and “−” in the figure.
  These immunoreceptors consist of immunoglobulin superfamily-containing proteins
  (such as the Fc receptors, PIR-A, or the TREMs) or the C-type lectin receptors (Dectin-2,
  Mincle, or MDL-1). In some cases, receptors may utilize either signaling adapter
  (see ). Examples of the C-type lectin receptors that have ITAM-like sequences as
  imbedded domains within their cytoplasmic tails are Dectin-1, CLEC2, and CLEC9A.
  The sequences with the ITAM domain of these receptors differs in that the membrane
  distal tyrosine resides in a YxxxL sequence (or YxxxI for mouse), as opposed to
  the traditional YxxL ITAM sequence found around the proximal tyrosine. As a result,
  the membrane distal tyrosine is dispensable for signaling, leading to the designation
  of these receptors as “hemi-ITAM” molecules (). For a more complete list of FcRγ-
  and DAP12-associated receptors, see , , and . Not shown is the human FcγRIIA receptor,
  which is unique among the Fc receptors for having an ITAM sequence directly imbedded
  in its cytoplasmic tail (see ). To the right are shown examples of receptors that
  link to or co-opt the ITAM pathway, with the best example being the leukocyte integrins
  (see ). For all of these receptors, it remains unclear how they are coupled to the
  ITAM adapters; hence this association is indicated as a “∼” within the membrane
  region. Despite the difference in the coupling of these receptors to the initial
  activating pathways, the overall signaling events that follow receptor engagement
  by their respective ligands are quite similar (as an examples, see ; ). The first
  step involves activation of Src-family kinases (shown as “SFK”), which are anchored
  in the membrane by their N-terminal acetylation sites. The SFK phosphorylate the
  ITAM adapters, leading to docking sites for Syk kinase, which then phosphorylates
  a number of substrates, including signaling scaffolding proteins such as SLP76,
  LAT, or NTAL, which in turn recruit other molecules (Vav family members) to initiate
  downstream responses. Syk function is also critical for PI3-kinase activation, which
  in turn leads to generation of membrane-bound PIP3 lipids that serve as membrane
  binding sites for the Tec-family kinases. Tec-family members contribute to scaffold
  protein phosphorylation. Together, these three cytoplasmic kinases contribute to
  the main downstream pathways of Ca2+signaling, MAPK activation, and NF-κB activation.
  Syk and Src-family kinases also contribute to activation of the FAK/Pyk2 kinases
  that feed primarily into the Rho/WASP pathway of actin polymerization, leading to
  cytoskeletal changes in innate immune cells required for adhesion, migration, and
  degranulation responses.
