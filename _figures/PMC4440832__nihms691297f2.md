caption: A. A schematic of the neogenin protein, which has four immunoglobulin (IG)
  repeats and six fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats located in the extracellular
  domain, a transmembrane (TM) domain, and three conserved P1, P2 and P3 motifs located
  in the intracellular domain. B. A model based on one proposed by  on how RGM and
  neogenin modulate BMP signaling. RGM and neogenin may form a super complex with
  the ligand and receptors of the BMP pathway in lipid raft membrane microdomains
  to mediate signaling. However, many questions remain as to how neogenin may modulate
  BMP signaling, which include, but are not limited to those marked by the question
  marks. For example, does neogenin play a role in the processing of RGM? What other
  proteins interact with neogenin? What is the role of the intracellular domain of
  neogenin in BMP signaling? See text for more discussions.
