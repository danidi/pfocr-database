caption: Working model to explain the role of ethylene (ET) on the regulation of responses
  to different nutrient deficiencies in plants. Nutrient deficiencies can enhance
  ET production by up-regulating SAMS, ACS, and ACO genes (; ; ), although the steps
  leading to this up-regulation are not yet clear. A possibility is that, at first,
  nutrient deficiencies cause oxidative stress and consequently,  accumulation and
  possibly,  accumulation (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). This - accumulation would stimulate ET
  production, which in turn, could increase - production (; ; ; ) in a positive feedback
  loop, leading to enhancement of the nutrient deficiency signal (). When ET is perceived
  by the receptors, it could act through a CTR1-EIN2-dependent pathway for the regulation
  of some responses or a CTR1-EIN2-independent pathway for the regulation of other
  responses (). At the end of these transduction pathways, different ET-related transcription
  factors, such as RAP2.11, ERF070, EIL3, EIN3/EIL1, or others, would activate different
  nutrient responses (; ; ; ). Under nutrient sufficiency, several signals that can
  move through the phloem (mineral ions, peptides, , etc.; ; ; ) could negatively
  interact with ET to inactivate nutrient responses. However, under nutrient deficiency,
  other signals that can move through the phloem (microRNAs, auxin, sugars, etc.;
  ; ; ; ; ) could positively interact with ET to activate the responses. Additionally,
  ET can influence auxin accumulation and distribution and the expression of some
  microRNAs (see text for details). Yellow background indicates signals that activate
  responses, orange background indicates signals that repress responses. AHP, Arabidopsis
