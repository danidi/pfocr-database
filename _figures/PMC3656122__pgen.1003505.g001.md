caption: In response to IR, miR-335 is downregulated by pCREB in an ATM dependent
  manner. MiR-335 downregulates CtIP and likely modulates the initiation of DNA end
  resection and repair. MiR-335 is also subject to epigenetic regulation by DNA methylation.
  The shaded box indicates that the miR-335-CtIP signaling axis is modulated by both
  irradiation and DNA methylation.
