caption: 'Subcellular distribution of the antioxidant network in T. cruzi. The antioxidant
  network of T. cruzi is formed by a number of enzymes and nonenzymatic redox-active
  molecules distributed in the endoplasmic recticulum, glycosomes, mitochondrion,
  and cytosol. The final electron donor for all the enzymatic systems is the NADPH
  derived from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The reducing equivalents are funneled
  through the trypanothione [T(SH)2], glutathione (GSH), ascorbate (ASC), and/or tryparedoxin
  (TXN) redox systems. Endoplasmic reticulum: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is metabolized
  by an ascorbate-dependent hemoperoxidase (APX) using ASC as the electron donor.
  Dehidroascorbate (DHA) is thought to be reduced by a direct reaction with T(SH)2.
  H2O2 in the presence of redox-active metals can initiate lipoperoxidation reactions
  that generate organic hydroperoxides (LOOH), which are substrates of GSH-dependent-peroxidase
  II (GPX-II) that uses GSH. T(SH)2 reduces oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH, while
  trypanothione reductase (TR) reduces oxidized trypanothione (TS2). Mitochondrion:
  the electron transport chain (Complex II: succinate dehydrogenase, CII; Complex
  III: ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase, CIII and Complex IV: cytochrome c oxidase,
  CIV) is a principal site for superoxide (O2•−, blue sphere) formation mainly at
  CIII. The mitochondrial isoform of FeSODA catalyzes the dismutation of O2•− to H2O2.
  When host-derived •NO (gray sphere) reaches the mitochondrion, it inhibits mitochondrial
  respiration at CIV (with an enhanced production of O2•− by CIII) by outcompeting
  FeSODA for O2•− to form ONOO− (green sphere). Mitochondrial peroxiredoxin (MPX)
  catalytically decomposes H2O2 and/or ONOO−  probably uses reduced TXN (TXNR) and
  T(SH)2 as the reducing substrate (dashed arrows). Cytosol: The antioxidant enzymes
  in the cytosol include cytosolic peroxiredoxin (CPX), FeSODB, and GPX-I. T(SH)2
  is synthesized from two molecules of GSH and one spermidine in a reaction catalyzed
  by the enzyme trypanothione synthetase (TS). The oxidative branch of the PPP is
  induced in the metacyclic trypomastiogote, ensuring the provision of reducing equivalents
  from NADPH (). The size of the spheres for •NO, ONOO−, and O2•− illustrates the
  diffusional capabilities of the oxidants. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6P-DH);
  nitrite (NO2−). Adapted from Piacenza et al. (). To see this illustration in color,
