caption: Biosynthetic pathway for β-caryophyllene and its structural analogs in plants
  [,,]. Sesquiterpenes are synthesized in nature through the mevalonic acid (MVA)
  pathway, which supplies the central metabolic C15 intermediate (E,E)-farnesyl pyrophosphate
  precursor (FPP); caryophyllane sesquiterpenes are synthetized from FPP as described
  above.
