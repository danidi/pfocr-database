caption: The proposed model underlying the potential lithogenic mechanisms of estrogen
  through the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) pathway in the liver. In the liver there
  is a possible “estrogen-ESR1-SREBP-2” pathway promoting cholesterol biosynthesis
  and hepatic secretion of biliary cholesterol. The negative feedback regulation of
  cholesterol biosynthesis (as shown in a dashed line) is inhibited by ESR1 that is
  activated by estrogen, mostly through stimulating the activity of sterol regulatory
  element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) with the resulting activation of the SREBP-2
  responsive genes for the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Consequently, these alterations
  induce excess secretion of newly synthesized cholesterol and supersaturation of
  bile that predisposes to cholesterol precipitation and gallstone formation. Moreover,
  the hepatic ESR1 activated by estrogen could stimulate the activity of ATP-binding
  cassette (ABC) transporter ABCG5 and ABCG8 on the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte
  and promote biliary cholesterol secretion. Of special note is that these lithogenic
  effects of estrogen are inhibited by the antiestrogenic ICI 182,780. In addition,
  the estrogen effects on increasing cholesterol biosynthesis and promoting cholesterol
  gallstone formation are, in part, blocked by deletion of the Esr1 gene. See text
  for details. Modified from Reference [], with permission.
