caption: Potential interplay between methylglyoxal (MG)-mediated glycation and S-glutathionylation
  pathways induced by KRIT1 (Krev interaction trapped 1) loss-of-function. The impairement
  of intracellular redox homeostasis caused by KRIT1 loss-of-function leads to a reactive
  oxygen species (ROS)-dependent sustained activation of the JNK-Nrf2 (c-Jun N-terminal
  kinase -nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor) pathway and upregulation of downstram
  targets, including Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1). In turn, Glo1 upregulation results in decreased
  intracellular levels of cytoprotective MG adducts, including argpyrimidine (AP)-modified
  heat-shock proteins (HSP) 27 and 70, leading to an increased cell susceptibility
  to oxidative damage and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Concomitantly, KRIT1 loss-of-function
  affects the glutathione (GSH) redox system, causing a significant decrease in the
  GSH:GSSG redox ratio and an increase in the S-glutathionylation of important structural
  and regulatory proteins, including metabolic enzymes; cytoskeletal proteins; and
  chaperonines, such as the HSP60. A potential interplay between the MG-mediated glycation
  and S-glutathionylation pathways may also occur, including the modulation of the
  GSH:GSSG redox ratio by MG and the contribution of S-glutathionylation to ROS production
  and Nrf2 activation (hatched red lines), leading to a synergistic contribution to
  the chronic adaptive redox homeostasis and enhanced cell susceptibility to oxidative
  stress associated with KRIT1 loss-of-function mutations. Eventually, these synergistic
  pathological effects might therefore culminate in cerebral cavernous malformation
  (CCM) disease onset and severity. See text for details.

  description: Potential interplay between methylglyoxal (MG)-mediated glycation and
    S-glutathionylation pathways induced by KRIT1 (Krev interaction trapped 1) loss-of-function.
    The impairement of intracellular redox homeostasis caused by KRIT1 loss-of-function
    leads to a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent sustained activation of the
    JNK-Nrf2 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase -nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor)

    In turn, Glo1 upregulation results in decreased intracellular levels of cytoprotective
    MG adducts, including argpyrimidine (AP)-modified heat-shock proteins (HSP) 27
    and 70, leading to an increased cell susceptibility to oxidative damage and mitochondria-dependent
    apoptosis. Concomitantly, KRIT1 loss-of-function affects the glutathione (GSH)
