caption: Folic acid is reduced to dihydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate (THF). A one-carbon
  unit is transferred from serine to THF to form 5,10-methylene-THF which is used
  for thymidylate synthesis or reduced to 5-methyl-THF. Dietary folate can enter one-carbon
  metabolism as 5-mTHF. The one-carbon unit is transferred to homocysteine by methionine
  synthase using the cofactor vitamin B12, forming methionine and THF. Homocysteine
  can also be remethylated using betaine as the methyl donor. Methionine is activated
  to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which serves as the methyl donor for reactions including
  arsenic methylation. Methylation reactions generate the methylated product and S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH), an inhibitor of methyltransferase enzymes. SAH is hydrolyzed to homocysteine,
  and can be remethylated or be used in the transsulfuration pathway.
