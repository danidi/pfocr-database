caption: A schematic pathway for one mechanisms of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity involves
  TRPV1 activation by cisplatin leads to NOX3-dependent generation of ROS to trigger
  STAT1 activation. STAT1 promotes an intracellular inflammatory response and p53
  activation, resulting in cell death, adapted from , .
