caption: The nitric oxide–nitrite–nitrate pathway. Under normal oxygen parameters
  (normoxia), nitric oxide (NO) is produced by NOS from L-Arg. In the absence of oxygen
  (hypoxia), nitrite is reduced by a variety reductases, including deoxyhemoglobin
  to produce NO. Further reduction/oxidation of NO can lead to production of metabolites.
