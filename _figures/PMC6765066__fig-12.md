caption: The role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of PAH. PAH is a disease that is characterized
  by increased pulmonary arterial pressure, vasoconstriction, and thrombosis. Right
  ventricular heart failure results from an increase in peripheral vascular resistance,
  systolic and diastolic pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, venous hypertrophy,
  and a thickening of arterial walls. Inflammation and vascular remodeling are major
  pathological changes in pulmonary hypertension. Patients with PAH have significantly
  elevated levels of airway HMGB1. These airway levels of HMGB1 can interact with
  RAGE to activate the p38/ERK/JNK pathway that signals via AP-1 to promote proliferation
  of smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. This increased proliferation produces
  vascular remodeling, venous hypertrophy, and thickening of arterial walls. Vascular
  remodeling contributes to vasoconstriction, which can increase vascular pressure.
  HMGB1 also can bind to RAGE and TLR4 to induce excessive inflammation by activating
  NF-κB. The activation of NF-κB increases the transcription of TGF-β1 to elicit vascular
  remodeling. NF-κB also increases the synthesis of the proinflammatory mediators
  MCP-1, CXCL8, IL-6, and TNF-α. TNF-α can increase neutrophil infiltration and plays
  a role in vascular remodeling by eliciting ET-1 secretion. ET-1 stimulates vasoconstriction
  and further augments the pathology of pulmonary hypertension. Also, IL-6, MCP-1,
  and CXCL8 mediate neutrophil infiltration and recruitment of immune cells. This
  leads to increased levels of ROS, MMP9, MPO, proteases, HMGB1, and endothelial dysfunction,
  which can stimulate vascular remodeling, formation of vascular lesions, and a further
  increase in the levels of HMGB1. Vascular lesions and remodeling can cause cell
  injury and death, contributing to increased pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary
  hypertension. ET-1, endothelin-1; PAH, pulmonary arterial hypertension.
