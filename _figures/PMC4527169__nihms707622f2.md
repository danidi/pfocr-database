caption: The antiviral effects of IFN-λ are evident at epithelial surfaces, including
  the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and skin. A. IFN-λ is a dominant
  IFN produced following viral infection in the respiratory tract. Respiratory epithelial
  cells can respond to both IFN-λ and IFNα/β to activate an antiviral response. Th1-skewing
  induced by IFN-λ reduces the severity of allergic asthma. B. The fenestrated endothelium
  of the liver creates a tissue architecture in which hepatocytes directly contact
  blood in liver sinusoids. Hepatocytes are the primary cellular targets for HBV and
  HCV, and are highly responsive to IFN-λ. A role for IFN-λ in controlling HCV infection
  is suggested by the association between HCV clinical outcome and numerous SNPs within
  the IFNL locus. C. IFN-λ has a key role in gastrointestinal tract immunity because
  unlike respiratory epithelial cells, gut epithelial cells do not respond to IFN-α/β
  and therefore rely upon IFN-λ to activate an antiviral response. The antiviral effects
  of IFN-λ may be especially important for restricting the shedding and transmission
  of enteric viruses. Immunity in the gastrointestinal tract is shaped by the bacterial
  microbiome; the ability of gut microbes to promote viral persistence requires IFN-λ
  signaling, although the mechanism of this interaction remains unclear. D. IFN-λ
  signaling tightens the endothelial junctions of the blood-brain barrier, which reduces
  viral neuroinvasion from the circulation. The tightening activity of IFN-λ is STAT1-
  independent, implicating a non-canonical signaling pathway. E. Psoriasis and atopic
  dermatitis are chronic inflammatory conditions of the skin characterized by breakdown
  of the epithelial barrier. Compared to lesions from atopic dermatitis patients,
  psoriasis lesions exhibit elevated IFN-λ production and enhanced expression of ISGs.
  This may explain why disseminated viral skin infections are common in patients with
  atopic dermatitis but not psoriasis.
