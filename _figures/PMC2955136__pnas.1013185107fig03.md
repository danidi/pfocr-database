caption: Highly expressed proteins in MII oocytes. (A) Transcription factors, translation
  factors, and transcriptional activators expressed in the MII oocyte. Forty-three
  transcription factors are more prevalent in MII oocytes than in GV oocytes, and
  they include TCL family proteins TCL1, TCL1b1, TCL1b2, and TCL1b3; 12 translation
  factors and 20 transcriptional activators are expressed in MII oocytes. (B) Epigenetic
  modification-related proteins are expressed more abundantly in MII oocytes. The
  MII oocytes express four histone demethylases, including Padi6, Jmjd3, Fbxl10, and
  Aof2, five histone acetyltransferases, including Nat11, Hat1, Taf15, Btaf1, and
  Taf7, six histone deacetylases, including Hdac2, Hdac6, Sirt2, Sirt5, Sap30, and
  Satb1, and eight histone methyltranferases, including Men1, Mll3, Mllt10, Mllt4,
  Nsd1, Prmt1, Dpy30, and Carm1. (C) DNA metabolic pathway in MII oocytes. More DNA
  repair proteins are expressed in MII oocytes than in GV oocytes; they include the
  single-strand break repair and nucleotide-excision repair proteins. DNA recombination
  pathway and DNA replication protein families are also more abundant in MII oocytes.
  Proteins involved in DNA metabolic pathways are highlighted in blue for MII oocytes
  and red for GV oocytes.

    Forty-three transcription factors are more prevalent in MII oocytes than in GV
    oocytes, and they include TCL family proteins TCL1, TCL1b1, TCL1b2, and TCL1b3;
    12 translation factors and 20 transcriptional activators are expressed in MII
    oocytes. (B) Epigenetic modification-related proteins are expressed more abundantly
