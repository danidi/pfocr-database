caption: Neural circuits for brief social defeat stress and continuous subordination
  stress. The ascending DA pathway originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
  and projecting to themedial prefrontal cortex is inhibited by GABA interneurons
  which in turn receive input from opioid peptides and CRH, among others. The glutamatergic
  feedback from PFC and amygdala modulates the DA pathway either directly or by acting
  on the GABA interneurons. This pathway may be rendered hyperactive as a result of
  brief social defeat episodes. By contrast, continuous uncontrollable subordination
  stress activates the serotonergic DRN cells that project to the forebrain, including
  the PFC. Glutamatergic feedback fromPFC and limbic forebrain modulates the ascending
  5-HT projections and it has been proposed that this feedback prevents dysregulation
  of the 5-HT system.
