caption: 'T. urticae enzymes involved in inositol phosphate metabolism and their expression
  in diapausing T. urticae females. The inositol phosphate metabolism pathway was
  derived from the KEGG metabolic pathway database for D. melanogaster (http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ko00562).
  The name and E.C. number of each enzyme involved in the IPM pathway is listed next
  to the arrows while accession numbers of T. urticae homologues of D. melanogaster
  enzymes involved in IPM are mentioned between brackets (see Additional file ). T.
  urticae homologues presented with a green font where significantly upregulated (FDR < 0.05,
  |FC| ≥ 2) in diapausing T. urticae females while those shown with a red font were
  significantly downregulated (FDR < 0.05, |FC| ≥ 2). Abbreviations: INPP1 = Inositol
  polyphosphate 1-phosphatase, I3K = inositol 3-kinase, IMPA = inositol monophosphatase
  3, MIOX = inositol oxygenase, INPP5 = inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase,
  PLC = phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C.'
