caption: 'Schematic illustrations of pathways for arginine metabolism. The main metabolism
  pathway includes several important enzymes: NOS that converts Arg to Cit and NO;
  arginase that converts Arg to Orn; ornithine transcarbamylase that converts Orn
  to Cit and further to Arg via arginosuccinate; PRMT that transfers methyl to Arg
  residues in protein; DDAH that hydrolyses ADMA to Cit and dimethylamine. The first
  3 enzymes are main part of the normal pathway, whereas the last 2 comprised the
  methylation pathway. ADMA = asymmetric dimethylarginine, Arg = arginine, Cit = citrulline,
  DDAH = dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, NMMA = NG-monomethylarginine, NO = nitric
  oxide, NOS = nitric oxide synthase, Orn = ornithine, PRMT = protein arginine methyltransferase,
  SDMA = symmetric dimethylarginine.'
