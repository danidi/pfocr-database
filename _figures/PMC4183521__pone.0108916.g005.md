caption: 'A. Summary of prior ideas in which the links between icv Ang II and elevated
  BP were mediated by activation of angiotensin type I receptors (AT1R), increases
  in sympathetic nervous system activity (SNA), and elevated plasma levels of AVP
  and ACTH –. B. Revised model presenting a pathway involving the CNS, humoral and
  vascular events that may link activation of hypothalamic AT1R with hypertension
  as suggested by the present and related studies. The CNS component involves amplification
  of chronic Ang II mediated signaling via local stimulation of mineralocorticoid
  receptors (MR) by aldosterone and increased brain and circulating EO . The CNS effects
  of Ang II raise SNA and plasma EO; the latter reprograms arterial myocyte function
  leading to: a) Increased Ca2+ and Na+ entry via NCX1 and TRPC6, and increased intracellular
  Ca2+ stores via SERCA2 , –, . b) Amplification of SNA in the sympathetic ganglia
  and vascular wall ,  and, c) increased myogenic and evoked tone, and elevated TPR
  and BP , . A central MR antagonist blocks all measured downstream effects of icv
  Ang II. The increased SNA and vascular reprogramming together appear to underlie
  the elevated BP. AVP, plasma arginine vasopressin. ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone.
  MT, myogenic tone. TPR, total peripheral resistance. See text for references and
  abbreviations not listed here.'
