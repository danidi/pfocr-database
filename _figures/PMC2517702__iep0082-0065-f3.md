caption: Signal transduction in the CD95 pathway. Activated, trimerized CD95 receptor
  forms a death inducing signalling complex (DISC) with adapter molecules FADD and
  procaspase-8. FADD binds to CD95 via a domain known as the death domain (DD) present
  in both proteins. Procaspase-8 is recruited by homologous interaction with a second
  domain in FADD, the death effector domain (DED). The formation of DISC leads to
  the release of activated caspase-8 in the form of a heterotetramer. Thereafter,
  caspase-8 either acts directly on caspase-3 (CASP-3) in type I cells or activates
  Bid to induce MMP and formation of a functional apoptosome in type II cells. Viral
  and cellular FLIP proteins inhibit the formation of DISC.
