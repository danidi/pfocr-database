caption: A synthetic genetic system to record cell-cell contacts and manipulate interacting
  cells. (A) Molecular mechanism of Delta/Notch signaling. Upon ligand (Delta) binding,
  the NRR domain of the Notch receptor is partially unfolded, exposing the S2 site.
  Thereafter, it is sequentially cleaved, first in NRR (S2 site) and then in the TMD
  (S3 site). After TMD cleavage, the ICD moves into the nucleus and activates transcription.
  (B) Diagram depicting the domains of Notch and the engineered receptor, SNTGV. (C)
  SNTGV activation uses the molecular mechanism of the Delta/Notch signaling pathway.
  Upon CD19 binding, SNTGV is cleaved both in the NRR and TMD, and Gal4VP16 moves
  into the nucleus of the receiver cell to activate transcription of UAS-dependent
  genes, such as GFP in this example.
