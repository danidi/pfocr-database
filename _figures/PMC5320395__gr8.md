caption: Effect of plasma from obese children on vascular endothelial cells. As summarized
  in this scheme plasma from severely obese children (Plasma OB) affect endothelial
  function by acting on several intracellular signaling pathways. First, a reduced
  insulin sensitivity leads to decreased Akt and eNOS activation by phosphorylation
  and consequently reduction of insulin-stimulated NO production and bioavailability,
  which, as well known, might contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Secondly, increased
  Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress activation leads to the induction of the Unfolded
  Protein Response (UPR) pathway. In particular GRP78 (ER stress upstream regulator),
  PERK and ATF6 (both ER stress transmembrane sensor proteins), eIF2α and ATF6 cleaved
  (both downstream ER stress markers) and IkBα (ER stress and Inflammatory marker)
  result all increased, while IRE1 results not involved in this process. In parallel,
  the induction of these pathways lead to increase NF-κB activation, thus resulting
  in increased inflammatory response. In addition, it should be emphasized that a
  mutual interaction probably exists between factors that cause ER stress and factors
  that are generated by ER stress. Thus, a vicious circle triggered by OB plasma may
  contribute to endothelial dysfunction. Nitric Oxide (NO), endothelial Nitric Oxide
  Synthase (eNOS), protein kinase B (known as Akt), glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78,
  also called BiP), inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1), double-stranded RNA-activated
