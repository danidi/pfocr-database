caption: Schematic representation of the role of miR‐133b in the Warburg effect. The
  ectopic expression of miR‐133b‐induced downregulation of PTBP1 and switching from
  PKM2 to PKM1 for a short duration, which caused an abrupt increase in the intracellular
  reactive oxygen species (ROS). PEP, pentose phosphate pathway; PPP, phosphoenolpyruvic
  acid.
