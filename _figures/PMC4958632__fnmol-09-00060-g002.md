caption: 'MT functions and regulation at the presynaptic terminal of Drosophila NMJs.
  (A) Different pools of MTs at presynaptic terminals of NMJs: Futsch-positive stable
  MTs and dynamic pioneer MT bundles. At presynaptic terminals, there is a balance
  between soluble and polymerized tubulin. (B) Futsch-dependent regulation of MT stability
  at presynaptic terminals. Un-phosphorylated Futsch interacts with MTs and promotes
  their stabilization. Sgg directly phosphorylates Futsch, detaching it from MTs,
  hence promoting MT disassembly and synaptic retraction, in a mechanism that is inhibited
  by the Wnt signaling pathway. The phosphatase calneur counteracts the effect of
  Sgg phosphorylation. It is also likely that the phosphatase PP2A participates in
  this mechanism. Ank2 links both MTs and Futsch to the spectrin cytoskeleton, conferring
  structural stability to the presynaptic terminal. Finally, disrupting the interaction
  between aPKC and Futsch detaches the latter from the MTs, inducing disassembly.
  (C) MT interactions with components of the NMJ active zone. Futsch links MTs with
  Brp and Cacophony at active zones. The active zone protein DYSC regulates the stability
  of the presynaptic MT cytoskeleton. The recycling of SV depends on the clth-mediated
  endocytosis of neurotransmitter-depleted SVs in a mechanism involving the MT cytoskeleton,
  dynein and BicD. Abbreviations: Ank2, Ankyrin 2; aPKC, atypical protein kinase C;
