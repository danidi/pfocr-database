number: Figure 2
caption: UPRER and UPRmt mechanistic commonalities and differences are described in
  this figure. BiP binds to misfolded proteins and promotes UPRERsignaling, allowing
  for activation of the ATF6, PERK, and IRE1 pathways. ATF6 acts as a transcription
  factor and activates production of protein-folding machinery. PERK phosphorylates
  eIF2α, promoting translation of both UPRER and UPRmt protein-folding machinery and
  downregulating global translation. IRE1 splices Xbp1 and allows the spliced product
  to transcribe protein chaperones in the nucleus. In the ATF5 pathway of UPRmt, ClpP,
  and Lon1 diverge from degradation of ATF5 to degradation of misfolded proteins and
  the accumulation of ATF5 results in transcription of UPR-associated proteins in
  the nucleus. Dashed line is ATF5 movement in normal physiological conditions; solid
  line is enhanced when UPRmt is activated. UPR, unfolded protein response; BiP, binding
  immunoglobulin protein; ATF, activating transcription factor; PERK, protein kinase
  RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; ClpP, ATP-dependent Clp protease proteolytic
  subunit; Lon1, Lon protease homolog 1; IRE1, inositol-requiring kinase 1; Xbp1,
  X-box binding protein 1; eIF2α; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A.
