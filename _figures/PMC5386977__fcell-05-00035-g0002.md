caption: MYC-dependent miRNA regulation of glutamine metabolism. MYC was found to
  downregulate miR-23a/b, which targets Gls, resulting in increased production of
  glutamate from glutamine (Gao et al., ). In addition, MYC was found to upregulate
  miR-18a, which targets GCLC, resulting in decreased production of glutathione from
  glutamate, and increased flow of glutamine-derived carbon into the TCA cycle (Anderton
  et al., ). Gray lines indicate a decreased effect, and dotted lines indicate a multi-step
  metabolic pathway.
