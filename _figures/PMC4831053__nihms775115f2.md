caption: 'A. Examples of common structures found in cell signaling networks that have
  been identified using graph theory. A1. A “Bow-tie” structure: signals from many
  receptors converge onto a few cytosolic targets which in turn regulate many transcription
  factors; A2. The “bifan” motif : two input nodes directly cross-regulate target
  nodes; A3. Negative feedback loops that include receptors are more often observed
  close to the membrane, and positive feedback loops (often highly nested) are more
  commonly found a few steps downstream from receptors. B. Dynamics in minimal pathway
  components in cell signaling networks. B1. Positive feedback loop. The feedback
  results in a larger response than if no feedback were present. The interaction between
  voltage and L type or non-inactivating inward calcium channels show this type of
  positive feedback. In some cases positive feedback might result in bistability;
  B2. Negative feedback loop with no (or in practical cases very little) delay. The
  feedback results in a smaller response than if no feedback were present. Non-inactivating
  outward K channels exhibit negative feedback; B3. Negative feedback loop with delay.
  The delayed feedback reduces the response after an initial transient response. Oscillations
  can occur in response to sustained input. C. A generic MAPK pathway. C1. A single
  phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is circled in green. The MAPK cascade consists
  of three layers of such cycles, and the two lower layers have dual phosphorylation
  sites. C2. Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles can in certain conditions show
  “ultrasensitivity” and behave as threshold devices. The layered cascade, with dual
  phosphorylation sites, can sustain bistability as well. Bistability requires hysterisis:
  the response to an increasing input differs from the response to a decreasing input.
  In contrast, ultrasensitivity exhibits a similar steep increase in output with small
  changes in input, but the threshold is identical for increasing and decreasing inputs.'
