caption: Semaphorin 5A can both promote and inhibit the migration of cells based on
  the intracellular pathways triggered. It is known to enhance cellular invasion via
  its interaction with MET receptor tyrosine kinase or by the activation of the MEK/ERK
  pathway. However, contrary to this it can recruit Rho-GDIα at its intracellular
  domains, which in turn inhibits cellular migration by disrupting the activity of
  Rac-1.
