caption: Skeletal effects of 1,25(OH)2D3signaling. During a negative calcium balance,
  when VDR action in the intestine is impaired or dietary calcium intake is low, intestinal
  calcium absorption is decreased. Normal serum calcium levels can however be maintained
  by increased 1,25(OH)2D3 and PTH levels, which will increase bone resorption and
  reduce bone matrix mineralization. During a normal or positive calcium balance,
  normal serum 1,25(OH)2D3 levels promote intestinal calcium absorption. This pathway
  will deliver sufficient calcium for adequate bone matrix mineralization. VDR signaling
  in osteoprogenitors increases RANKL expression and stimulates osteoclastogenesis,
  whereas VDR action in mature osteoblasts has anticatabolic actions, by decreasing
  RANKL expression, and anabolic effects by stimulating LRP-5 signaling.
