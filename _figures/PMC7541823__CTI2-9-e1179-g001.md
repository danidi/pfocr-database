caption: 'Receptors implicated in the internalisation of Mycobacterium sp. and intracellular
  sensors. (1) Pulmonary Mycobacterium infection begins with the bacilli entering
  into the airway where airway epithelial cells (AEC) respond by synthesising antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs) and proteins, for example, Collectins Surfactant protein A (SP‐A)
  and SP‐D proteins. (2) These proteins opsonise the bacteria and facilitate phagocytic
  uptake by alveolar macrophages through SP‐A receptors. (3) Mycolic acid and lipoteichoic
  acid in the Mtb cell membrane play distinct roles in receptor‐mediated internalisation.
  Lipoteichoic acid binds to the MARCO (Class‐A scavenger receptor) and affects cytokine
  production in a TLR2‐dependent manner. (4) The entry of Mycobacterium is also supported
  by an array of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including, Toll‐Like receptors
  (TLRs) TLR4‐CD14, TLR2, Mannose receptors, immunoglobulin G (IgG)‐coated Mycobacteria
  via FcγRs and Scavenger receptors that bind lipopolysaccharides of gram‐negative
  bacteria and lipoteichoic acid of gram‐positive bacteria. (5) The abundance of C3
  and C3bi proteins in broncho‐alveolar lavage fluid marks the Mycobacterium for complement‐mediated
  lysis through the alternative pathway. This binding also enhances its phagocytic
  uptake via complement receptors expressed by alveolar APCs. (6) Serum‐derived ligands
  facilitate pathogen uptake via receptors CR1, CR3 and CR4 and translocated to membrane‐bound
  phagosomes. CR3 through its interaction with Mannosyl‐phosphatidyl‐Myo‐inositol‐based
  glycolipids (PIM) can also facilitate Mycobacterium uptake. (7) A battery of major
  virulence proteins from mycobacterial species are reported. Lipoarabinomannan (LAM)
  and mannosylated LAM (ManLAM) are two major representatives. Others include HSP60/65,
  38kDa protein/Ag38, Mtb resuscitation‐promoting factor (RpfB), ESAT‐6, CFP‐10, MPT83,
  PE‐PGRS33, and these factors have different mechanisms of binding to the host cells.
  (8) The C‐type lectin and DC‐Sign receptors (CD209) mediate Mtb entry via binding
  to PIM similarly. Other CLRs are Mincle and Dectin‐1 that may also mediate the internalisation
  process through unknown mechanisms. Intracellular Sensors: (9) During Mtb infection,
  the lysosomal release of cathepsin B (CTS‐B) plays an important role in NLRP3‐inflammasome
  activation and subsequent rise in IL‐1β production. This pathway may also control
  pyroptosis. (10) TLR3 and TLR8 are activated by mycobacterial RNA while undermethylated
  CpG motifs from the Mtb genome may activate TLR9 to elicit the cytokine biosynthesis.
  (11) Many other intracellular sensors of mycobacterial moieties have been reported.
  These include RIG‐1, MDA‐5 and PKR that may contribute to the upregulation of Type‐I
  IFNs. NOD2 activation may occur through GMDP which is a metabolite of the Mtb cell
  wall. (12) Cytosolic DNA sensor AIM‐2 mediates IL‐1β and IL‐18 production in response
  to Mtb. IFI16 is an innate immune sensor for intracellular DNA that may lead to
  the activation of the cytosolic surveillance pathway (CSP).'
