caption: 'HDV spreading pathways and the targets of the interferon (IFN) response.
  Left: de novo infection-mediated extracellular spreading pathway. HBV/HDV co-infection
  produces progeny HDV that infect neighboring intact hepatocytes. The IFN response
  inhibits early stages of HDV de novo infection but does not significantly impair
  HDV RNA replication in the nucleus. Right: cell-division-mediated HDV spread. HDV
  survives cell division and efficiently establishes replication in both daughter
  cells. The IFN response causes efficient degradation of HDV RNA during cell division
  and/or prevents the re-establishment of replication in daughter cells.'
