caption: NAD+ biosynthetic pathways in S. cerevisiae and mammals.  NAD+ is synthesized
  from tryptophan by the de novo  biosynthetic pathway and from vitamin precursors,
  NA, Nam, and NR, through  salvage pathways (,  ). Salvage pathways in  mammals and
  yeast differ in the utilization of Nam. Yeast convert Nam to NA  via the nicotinamidase,
  Pnc1, whereas mammals convert Nam to nicotinamide  mononucleotide (NMN) through
  the activity of the nicotinamide  phosphoribosyltransferase, Nampt. In yeast, NR
  is salvaged via the Nrk1  pathway and the Urh1/Pnp1 pathway with slight flux through
  Meu1  (). In yeast, NaR is  salvaged by Nrk1 and the Urh1/Pnp1 pathway  (). According
  to the data in  this study, mammalian Nrk-independent NR salvage relies solely on
  Pnp and, in  yeast, Nrk-independent usage of NaR relies principally on Urh1. Urh1
  is now  classified as an NR hydrolase, with lower activity on uridine and NaR.  ribo,
