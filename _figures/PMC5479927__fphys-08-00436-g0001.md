caption: CoQ biosynthesis and effect of 4-HB analogs. Names for enzymes of E. coli,
  S. cerevisiae, and humans are in gray, orange, and pink, respectively (in black
  when common to S. cerevisiae and humans). Polyprenyl pyrophosphate (PPP, 8, n =
  6–10) synthesized from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and n-3 isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  (IPP) is conjugated to 4-HB (2) by Coq2/UbiA to yield polyprenyl-4-HB (7). The numbering
  of the aromatic carbon atoms is shown on polyprenyl-4-HB and is uniformly applied
  to the different intermediates cited in the text, although IUPAC nomenclature might
  be different depending on the substitution pattern. Since the order of some reactions
  is different in bacteria (Aussel et al., ), only the eukaryotic pathway from polyprenyl-4-HB
  to CoQ is shown. R corresponds to the polyprenyl moiety (n = 6–10). 4-Chlorobenzoic
  acid (12) and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (13) (red) are inhibitors of Coq2/UbiA, whereas
  pABA (9, blue) is prenylated and progress to different stages of the CoQ biosynthetic
  pathway depending on the organisms (see text for details). 4-HB analogs (in green)
  have potential (16, 17) or proven (10, 11, 15) capacities to bypass the biosynthetic
  steps indicated by the dashed arrows.
