caption: Pathways involved in cardiac energy metabolism. FA and glucose oxidation
  are the main ATP-generating pathways in the adult mammalian heart. Acetyl-CoA derived
  from FA and glucose oxidation is further oxidized in the TCA cycle to generate NADH
  and FADH2, which enter the electron transport/oxidative phosphorylation pathway
  and drive ATP synthesis. Genes encoding enzymes involved at multiple steps of these
  metabolic pathways (i.e., uptake, esterification, mitochondrial transport,and oxidation)
  are transcriptionally regulated by PGC-1α with its nuclear receptor partners, including
  PPARs and ERRs (blue text). Glucose uptake/oxidation and electron transport/oxidative
  phosphorylation pathways are also regulated by PGC-1α via other transcription factors,
  such as MEF-2 and NRF-1. Cyt c, cytochrome c.
