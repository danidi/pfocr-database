caption: 'A model for ethylene signalling at the ER membrane in Arabidopsis. The initial
  steps in the ethylene signalling pathway occur at the ER membrane and involve ethylene
  receptors (represented here by ETR1; ) interacting with the CTR1 serine/threonine
  protein kinase () and the EIN2 Nramp homologue (). Left: the N-terminal regulatory
  domain of the CTR1 protein kinase associates with the ethylene receptor histidine
  kinase (HK) and receiver (R) domains. In the absence of ethylene, the ethylene receptors
  activate the CTR1 kinase domain (KD) by an unknown mechanism. Active CTR1 somehow
  represses EIN2. Right: ethylene binding shuts off receptor signalling, such that
  the CTR1 kinase domain is no longer active, allowing signalling to proceed to EIN2.
  We postulate that dimerization/monomerization of CTR1 could play a role in activating/inactivating
  the CTR1 KD, respectively. The biochemical functions of EIN2 have yet to be determined,
  but downstream of EIN2 there is activation of the nuclear transcription factors
  EIN3/EIL1 and ERF1, which induce ethylene-responsive gene expression. Interestingly,
  EIN2 can also associate with ethylene receptors (; ), and in vitro association of
  EIN2 with the ETR1 receptor is enhanced when ETR1 histidine kinase activity is disrupted
