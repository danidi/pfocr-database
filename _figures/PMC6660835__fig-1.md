caption: Endogenous RNA recognition by RIG-I-like receptors. Recognition of endogenous
  RNAs by RIG-I and/or MDA5 during viral infection (a) or in inflammatory and autoimmune
  diseases (b). Specific RNA ligands are depicted as well as the signaling pathway
  initiated by RIG-I and MDA5 via their adaptor protein MAVS, which is localized at
  the mitochondrion. Activation of MAVS then leads to several downstream signaling
  events, including the activation of TBK-1, IKKɛ, IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB. The detailed
  mechanisms of host ligand recognition by RLRs are described in the text. Solid lines
  indicate direct effects or signaling events. Dashed lines indicate signaling events
  that are indirect. Red lines indicate inhibitory effects. CARD, caspase activation
  and recruitment domain; CTD, carboxy-terminal domain; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; HSV-1,
  herpes simplex virus type 1; IAV, influenza A virus; IKKɛ, IκB kinase-ɛ; IFN, interferon;
  IRF, IFN regulatory factor; KSHV, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; MDA5,
  melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral signaling
  protein; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; P, phosphate; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible
  gene-I; TBK-1, TANK-binding kinase 1; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. Color images
  are available online.
