caption: Schematic representation of jasmonate-induced, ARF7-mediated auxin responsive
  gene expression in protoplasts. In the absence of JA, the transcriptional activity
  of ARF7 is repressed by the chimeric protein JaSHY. In the presence of JA, JaSHY
  is degraded by COI1, leading to the liberation of ARF7 transcriptional activity.
