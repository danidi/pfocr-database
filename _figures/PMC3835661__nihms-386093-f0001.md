caption: Apoptosis and necrosis are mediated by death receptor (extrinsic) and mitochondrial
  (intrinsic) pathways. In the death receptor pathway, a death ligand (e.g. TNF-α)
  binds its cognate death receptor to trigger assembly of either the DISC (not shown)
  or complex I. When RIP1 is K63-polyubiquinated by cIAP1/2, complex I signals survival
  through NF-kB activation (not shown). If (a) death receptor dissociates from complex
  I, (b) the complex is endocytosed, (c) RIP1 undergoes deubiquitiniation, and (d)
  a FADD-RIP3 complex is recruited, complex II is formed. This complex signals apoptosis
  or necrosis depending on procaspase-8 activity. Activation of procaspases-8 leads
  to cleavage and activation of downstream procaspases that proteolyze cellular proteins
  to bring about apoptosis. Procaspase-8 also cleaves RIP1 and RIP3, to preclude necrosis.
  In contrast, with caspase-8 inhibition, RIP1 and RIP3 undergo a series of cross-phosphorylation
  events that trigger necrosis by a variety of mechanisms (see text). In the mitochondrial
  pathway, the critical event in apoptosis is permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial
  membrane (OMM), which results in release of mitochondrial apoptogens (e.g. cytochrome
  c) to the cytoplasm. Complex interactions among Bcl-2 family members (e.g. Bax and
  Bak) mediate OMM permeabilization (see text). Once in the cytoplasm, cytochrome
  c stimulates assembly of the apoptosome, a multiprotein complex in which procaspase-9
  is activated. Procaspase-9 goes on to activate downstream procaspases. In contrast,
  the defining event in necrosis is opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition
  pore (mPTP) in the inner membrane, which (a) collapses the electrical gradient across
  the IMM leading to cessation of ATP synthesis and (b) promotes the influx of water
  into the mitochondrial matrix resulting in severe mitochondrial swelling. Multiple
  connections exist between these pathways. TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α, TNFR1,
