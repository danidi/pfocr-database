caption: 'Riboflavin biosynthetic pathway and genetic basis in representative bacterial
  species. (A) Riboflavin (RF) is synthesized from one molecule of GTP and two molecules
  of ribulose-5-phosphate (R5P). Note that the first dedicated reactions for GTP and
  R5P are catalyzed by RibA and RibB, respectively. (B) Genomic context of riboflavin
  biosynthesis genes in representative bacterial species. Gene color is based on function.
  Gray genes are not involved in riboflavin biosynthesis but are included to show
  their shared genomic context. A forward slash indicates that genes are not adjacent
  on the chromosome. RFN elements, denoted by black circles, were predicted by Vitreschak
  and coworkers (), with the exception of the B. subtilis RFN element, which was demonstrated
  experimentally (). Genome abbreviations: BS, Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis 168;
  SO, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1; EC, Escherichia coli MG1655; VP, Vibrio parahaemolyticus
  RIMD 2210633; PP, Pseudomonas putida KT2440; BC, Burkholderia cenocepacia PC184;
  HP, Helicobacter pylori 83; CJ, Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168.'
