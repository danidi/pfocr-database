caption: nAChRs pathway in lung cancer. (1) ACh is synthesized intracellularly by
  the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) from choline and acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA)
  before being released into the extracellular space. This signaling system is targeted
  by various biological modulators which can inhibit ACh release or ChAT activity.
  ChAT is strongly up-regulated in squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), which increases
  levels of Ach, providing endogenous proliferative stimuli to nAchRs; (2) All nAChRs
  allow the influx of different cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+), and the α7nAChR is selective
  for Ca2+. Binding of nicotine to α7nAChR can cause Ca2+ influx into lung cancer
  cells and the subsequent membrane depolarization activates voltage-gated Ca2+ channels,
  which activates the MAPK pathway to promote cancer cell proliferation; (3) Hypermethylation
  of 15q25.1 locus and epigenetic silencing of the CHRNA3 gene may result in under-representation
  of α3 containing nAChR-subtypes, which in turn leads to over-representation of α7
  and α5 containing nAChRs on the cell surface, further increasing Ca2+ influx mediated
  activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. As a result, cells with the complete or
  partial absence of the CHRNA3 subunit containing nAChRs may display defective cell
  death response; (4) α7nAChR antagonist abungarotoxin (α-BTx) can attenuate the proliferative
  effects of nicotine in NSCLC and SCLC cells; and (5) The other ﬁndings suggest a
  strong connection between growth factor mediated VEGF pathway and the cholinergic
  angiogenic pathway. The endothelial cell (EC) migration induced by basic ﬁbroblast
  growth factor (bFGF) and VEGF can be inhibited by blocking the nAChRs with α-BTx.
