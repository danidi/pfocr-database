caption: Schematic representation of the glutamine-glutamate cycle in the brain. In
  the brain, glutamate (Glu) is released by presynaptic neurons to the synaptic cleft.
  Glutamate activates glutaminergic receptors that undergo a conformational change
  to allow influx of extracellular calcium. This triggers membrane depolarization
  in the postsynaptic neuron and induces signal transduction. The excess of glutamate
  in the synaptic cleft has to be removed to prevent excitotoxicity. Astrocytes take
  up surplus glutamate through various glutamate importers and convert it to glutamine
  (Gln) through glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is exported to the capillaries (not
  shown), or is transferred back to the neurons. Subsequently, neurons can then convert
  back the glutamine to glutamate, closing the glutamine-glutamate cycle. Glutamate
  can be imported by IDH mut glioma cells in order to supply cells with αKG as a rescue
  pathway
