caption: Schematic representation of HMGB1 signaling events mediated by RAGE and TLR2/4
  and therapeutic strategies for cerebral ischemia. The HMGB1 is passively released
  into the extracellular space, thereby allowing its interaction with RAGE and TLR2/4,
  as well as other unknown receptors. The TLR2/4 can then signal via MyD88, IL-1R-associated
  kinase 1 (IRAK), and TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to NF-κB. The RAGE
  can activate the Rac1 and CDC42, as well as Ras and p38. The common signaling pathway
  involves activation of NF-κB to induce gene expression, including that of HMGB1.
  The HMGB1 may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of cerebral ischemia. Therapeutic
  strategies include anti-HMGB1 antibodies, HMGB1 A box protein, and soluble RAGE
  and anti-RAGE antibodies. Open ovals indicate ‘actively secreted' acetylated HMGB1
  and filled ovals indicate ‘passively released' HMGB1.
