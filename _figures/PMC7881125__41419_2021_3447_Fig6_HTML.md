caption: A UNC1999 inhibits the activity of EZH2. B This prevents EZH2 from methylating
  H3, thus resulting in loss of H3K27me3 and open chromatin. As a consequence, the
  tumour-suppressor miRNAs miR-494-39, miR-192-5p, miR-130a-3p and miR-134-5p, which
  are silenced by H3K27me3 under basal conditions, are upregulated. C The tumour-suppressor
  miRNAs downregulate their target genes (MAT2A, MAT2B, CBS and CTH), which encode
  for enzymes involved in methionine cycling. This dysregulates methionine cycling
  and results in variation of metabolite abundance, such as accumulation of homocysteine.
  Metabolites in each pathway are indicated by small circles, which are colour coded
  with the same colour of the pathway they participate in. Metabolites that vary in
  abundance post UNC1999 treatment are marked by either a red (decreased abundance)
  or a green (accumulation) border.
