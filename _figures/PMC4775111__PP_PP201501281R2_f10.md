caption: Scheme and coexpression network for a putative flavonol synthesis pathway
  in tobacco flowers. A, Outline of a potential flavonoid synthesis pathway for tobacco
  (based on metabolites measured in  and Supplemental Fig. S6). CHS, Chalcone synthase;
  CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; FGT,
  flavonol glycosyl transferase. B, Coexpression network of EB427179 (large node)
  corresponding to tobacco methyltransferase_2 module 177 (). Nodes depict genes (probe
  set identifiers are associated with nodes), and edges depict coexpression relationships
  as outlined by . Colored shapes of the nodes indicate the label co-occurrence that
  the respective gene is associated with. Genes that correspond to enzymes in the
  flavonoid pathway scheme (A) are highlighted in boldface and are associated with
  respective boxes. The grayed-out, transparent part of the network represents nodes
  that are not supported by the .
