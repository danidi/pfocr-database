caption: Regulation diagram. Notch1 could interact by cis and trans with Jag1 and
  Dll1 ligands, and in which one of the Fringe-related proteins, Lunatic Fringe (LFng),
  could modulate these interactions. LFng modification of Notch1 enhances trans activation
  from Dll1 and weakens trans-activation from Jag1 (left). LFng modification of Notch1
  enhances cis-interactions with Dll1 and weakens cis-interactions with Jag1 (right).
  Interactions are indicated by + and − for positive and negative regulation, respectively
