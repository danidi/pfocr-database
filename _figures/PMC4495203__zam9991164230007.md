caption: Current model for the role of the Pta-Ack pathway in S. mutans. The activities
  of products encoded by the ackA or pta genes are primarily responsible for the generation
  of AcP, the levels of which strongly influence physiology and gene expression in
  S. mutans. In particular, the role of the Pta-Ack pathway in modulating the expression
  of genes involved in carbohydrate flux at the pyruvate node, as well as those contributing
  to biofilm formation and stress tolerance, is significant. Moreover, a metabolic
  linkage between acetate metabolism and (p)ppGpp production in response to oxidative
  stress is established and is probably mediated by the small (p)ppGpp synthase RelP
  and the two-component signal transduction system RelRS. Red arrow, high level of
  accumulation of AcP; dashed arrows, the observations and models.
