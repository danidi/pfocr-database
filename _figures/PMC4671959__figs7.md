caption: Mechanism of the Redox-Dependent Brf2 Blockade during Oxidative Stress and
  Carcinogenesis, Related to , , , , , , and During normal growth conditions (A) Brf2-
  and Nrf2-dependent transcripts are synthesized at basal levels. Upon moderate oxidative
  stress (B), Nrf2 is activated and Nrf2-dependent transcripts upregulated. Concomitantly,
  Brf2-dependent transcription, including SeCys tRNAs, is rapidly downregulated via
  redox-dependent modifications of Brf2. The pre-existing pool of SeCys tRNA is sufficient
  to sustain synthesis of selenoproteins. Upon prolonged oxidative stress (C), SeCys
  tRNA levels become limiting while, simultaneously, selenoprotein’s mRNAs continue
  to be highly upregulated by Nrf2. In this scenario, compromised synthesis of selenoproteins
  drives the cells into apoptosis. In cancer cells (D), the Nrf2 pathway is constitutively
  activated and contributes to the observed resistance of cancerous cells to higher
  than normal concentrations of reactive oxygen species. Under these circumstances,
  Brf2 overexpression is required to overcome the innate redoxdependent blockade,
  ensuring elevated synthesis of SeCys tRNAs and, ultimately, enabling cancer cells
  to evade apoptosis under prolonged oxidative stress.
