caption: 'Cross-talk between O-GlcNAc, phosphorylation, and redox signaling. A: phosphorylation
  of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) at Ser1177 results in increased
  eNOS activity and NO production, whereas O-GlcNAcylation of the same site leads
  to decreased enzyme activity and NO production. B: theoretically, O-GlcNAc-dependent
  reactions are not limited to interactions with specific proteins but rather act
  to regulate an entire pathway. For example, O-GlcNAc modification of eNOS decreases
  its activity and NO production. At the same site, Akt-mediated phosphorylation and
  activation of eNOS leads to increased NO-production. However, Akt is also subject
  to O-GlcNAcylation, which reduces its activity, thereby inhibiting eNOS phosphorylation
  and NO production.'
