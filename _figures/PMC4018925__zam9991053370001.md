caption: 'Pathway for the synthesis of eriodictyol from l-tyrosine. (A) Six genes
  are involved in the eriodictyol synthesis pathway: TAL, encoding tyrosine ammonia
  lyase, from R. glutinis; 4CL, encoding 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, from P. crispum;
  CHS, encoding chalcone synthase, from P. hybrida; CHI, encoding chalcone isomerase,
  from M. sativa; F3′H, encoding flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase, from G. hybrida; and CPR,
  encoding cytochrome P450 reductase, from C. roseus. (B) Four genes were involved
  in the biosynthesis of malonyl-CoA: the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) genes accBC
  and dtsR1, cloned from C. glutamicum; acs, cloned from E. coli BL21(DE3), encoding
  acetyl-CoA synthase; and ackA, encoding an acetate kinase, which was deleted from
  E. coli BL21(DE3). The steps that are the focus of this paper are highlighted.'
