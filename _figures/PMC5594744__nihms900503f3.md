caption: (A) The MUST complex (MAGEL2-USP7-TRIM27) is important for the retromer-mediated
  endosomal protein recycling pathway. The retromer coat-like complex recognizes membrane
  protein cargo on endosomes and facilitates their trafficking back to the plasma
  membrane or trans-Golgi network, sparing them from degradation in lysosomes. Sorting
  of retromer cargo into tubules emanating from the endosome is facilitated by deposition
  of actin by the WASH and Arp2/3 complexes to demarcate distinct endosomal domains.
  Non-degradative ubiquitination of WASH by the MUST complex facilitates WASH activity
  and endosomal actin accumulation. (B) Molecular mechanism of how the MUST complex
  regulates WASH activity. Retromer recruits the SHRC complex (WASH, FAM21, CCDC53,
  SWIP, and Strumpellin) through binding FAM21 and recruits the MUST complex by binding
  MAGEL2. The MUST complex promotes the activation of SHRC by K63-linked polyubiquitination
  of WASH leading to VCA exposure and Arp2/3 and actin binding to generate endosomal
  F-actin. USP7 deubiquitinating activity functions to prevent TRIM27 auto-ubiquitination
  and degradation, as well as fine-tuning WASH ubiquitination levels. Too little or
  too much WASH ubiquitination and thus endosomal F-actin levels are both detrimental
  to recycling.
