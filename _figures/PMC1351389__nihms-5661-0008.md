caption: Model of p38 inhibition on the regulation of LPS-stimulated TNF secretion
  in WT and TTPKO macrophages. This model depicts the hypothetical actions of p38
  to stimulate the phosphorylation of TTP by p38, either directly or indirectly, and
  a subsequent effect of this phosphorylation to decrease TTP binding to the TNFα
  mRNA ARE and increase the stability of the mRNA, leading to increased TNFα secretion
  (A1). In the presence of p38 inhibitors in the normal cells (A2), dephosphorylated
  TTP binds more avidly to the TNFα mRNA ARE, promoting destruction of the mRNA and
  decreased TNFα secretion. In the KO cells, TNFα mRNA is constitutively stabilized
  in the absence of TTP, and thus activation of p38 has relatively little effect on
  the mRNA stability (Fig. 8B); TNFα secretion is thus elevated both in the absence
  (B3) and the presence (B4) of the inhibitors. Both inhibitors are abbreviated SB.
  + denotes activation of a pathway; – denotes inhibition of a pathway. ↑ and ↓ represent
  increase and decrease, respectively.
