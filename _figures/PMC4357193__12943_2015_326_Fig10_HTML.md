caption: Phosphorylation ERK was specific activated in LSCs. Phosphorylation ERK was
  intrinsic and spontaneous activated in LSCs, which led to drug resistance for clinical
  chemo-agents. In contrast, the bulk leukemia cells were more sensitive to chemical
  drugs and eventually involved in apoptosis.
