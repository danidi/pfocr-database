caption: Top two networks based on ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showing interactions
  between the controls and the case. (A) Cell-to-cell signaling and interaction (control
  vs. DEHP). (B) Cancer, cell death and survival (control vs. OA). The lines between
  the genes represent known interactions (solid lines represent direct interactions;
  dashed lines represent indirect interactions). Each gene is displayed using shapes
  that represent the functional class of the gene product as indicated in the legend.
  The intensity of the red and green colors indicates the degree of up- and downregulation,
  respectively. A total of 25 networks (p-scores > 18) are provided in .
