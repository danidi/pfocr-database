caption: This illustration represents a proposed model of metabolic inflammation in
  support of the data presented, wherein RIH or glucose fluctuations in vitro upregulate
  the expression of TLR4-IRF5 together with markers of inflammation and the cardiovascular
  disease marker MMP-9 in macrophages. These data support the notion that controlling
  glucose fluctuations and/or IRF5 silencing could be beneficial to alleviate metabolic
  inflammation.
