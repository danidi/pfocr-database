caption: A proposed model for role of MARK4 in regulating lipogenesis in pig placental
  trophoblast cells. MARK4 promotes lipogenesis by activating WNT/β-catenin signaling
  pathway. Arrows indicates a positive regulation and bar-headed lines show negative
  regulation. Interactions depicted are based on studies performed in various tissues
  (in some cases placenta) and have been previously published.
