caption: ROS-dependent cellular senescence pathways in MSCs. Similar to other adult
  somatic cells, MSCs enter replicative senescence after a certain number of cell
  divisions. ROS are responsible for cellular senescence and cause a direct DNA damage.
  DNA damage triggers a specific DNA damage response (DDR). DDR activation leads to
  cell cycle arrest via activation of p53/p21 and/or p16/pRB pathway. In addition,
  MAPK pathway is required for the acquisition of senescence. P38 plays an important
  causative role in cellular senescence induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore,
  ROS regulate major epigenetic processes and can induce DNA methylation and histone
  acetylation. Understanding the mechanism of senescence of MSCs should provide more
  effective strategies in transplantation of MSCs into the recipients with age-related
  diseases inherently associated with increased levels of oxidative stress.
