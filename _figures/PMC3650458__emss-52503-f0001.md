caption: Simplified overview of classical bile acid synthesis pathway in mice. CYP7A1
  and CYP8B1 catalyze the first and third reaction respectively. Dotted lines represent
  several steps in the synthesis of BAs that involve multiple enzymes. AKR1D1 is an
  abbreviation for Δ4-3-oxosteroid 5β-reductase.
