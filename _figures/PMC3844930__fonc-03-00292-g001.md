caption: Defining mitochondrial dynamics. (A) Mitochondrial fusion requires the action
  of fusion proteins, OPA-1 at the IMM and Mitofusin 1 and Mitofusin 2 at the OMM
  promoting the fusion of membranes of juxtaposed mitochondria. Mitochondrial fusion
  is selective for polarized mitochondria and promoted by growth on oxidative carbon
  sources, such as galactose, that also induces respiratory chain protein expression,
  increased cristae density and formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes and
  increased OXPHOS. Fusion likely also contributes to increased respiration and mitochondrial
  metabolism by promoting increased diffusion of intermediate metabolites and reducing
  agents. Fusion also limits mitophagy and apoptosis. (B) Mitochondrial fission is
  promoted by the GTPase activity of the dynamin-related protein (DRP1) that is recruited
  to mitochondria in response to stresses, such as hypoxia, where DRP1 interacts with
  its mitochondrial receptors (Mff1, Fis1 and others) to pinch off mitochondria into
  smaller units. Mitochondrial fission depolarizes mitochondria but mitochondria generally
  recover. Failure to restore membrane potential is thought to target mitochondria
  for degradation by autophagy or depending on other stresses, result in apoptosis.
  Cleavage of OPA-1 promotes apoptosis. (C) Biogenesis is induced by nutrient deprivation
  and in response to oxidative stress and requires the coordinated expression of nuclear
  and mitochondrial encoded genes that are co-regulated by transcription factors NRF1/2,
  PPARγ, ERRα, β, γ, and the key transcriptional co-factor, PGC-1α. Mitochondrial
  biogenesis is required for cell growth to produce increased metabolites and energy
  and defects in biogenesis are frequently lethal to cells and organisms. (D) Mitophagy
  is a specialized form of autophagy in which mitochondria are targeted to nascent
  phagophores and engulfed by autophagosomes that fuse with lysosomes to degrade the
  encapsulated mitochondria. Mitochondrial fragmentation is required for mitophagy
  and induction of fusion protects mitochondria from degradation under starvation
  conditions. Mitophagy is promoted by a number of different mechanisms including
  Pink1/Parkin-mediated pathways and also the BNIP3/NIX pathway. (E) Apoptosis is
  a terminal event that is promoted by the activity of BH3-only members of the Bcl-2
  superfamily of cell death regulators. When apoptosis is inhibited, novel functions
  for BAK/BAX and other Bcl-2 family members has been revealed. (F) Mitochondrial
  spatial dynamics is relatively under-studied but mitochondria respond to key stresses,
  including hypoxia and calcium flux in the cell, by changing their sub-cellular localization,
  including coalescing around the nucleus and changing their proximity to the ER.
  Mitochondrial migration in cells is modulated by Miro, a Ca2+ dependent small G
  protein as well as by poorly understood effects of Parkin and HDAC6.
