caption: PM induces ROS generation leading to oxidative HDAC6 activation which in
  turn destabilizes MT by deacetylation of a-tubulin within stable microtubules. MT
  depolymerization causes release of MT-bound GEF-H1 and subsequent activation of
  the Rho pathway. Simultaneously, PM-induced HDAC6 activation via positive feedback
  regulation of ROS production stimulates IL-6 expression and activation of JAK-STAT3
  pathway of EC inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Both these signaling events
  ultimately result in increased EC permeability and inflammation.
