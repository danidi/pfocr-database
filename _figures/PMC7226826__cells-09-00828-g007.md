caption: A proposed model for the remodeling of cholesterol metabolism in the transition
  from a chemosensitive to a chemoresistant phenotype in human ovarian cancer cells.
  Drug-sensitive cells show significant activation of the cholesterol biosynthetic
  pathway and transport of cholesterol through the Golgi apparatus, while uptake of
  exogenous cholesterol through the LDLR is limited. Drug resistant cells, on the
  opposite, show reduced levels of FDPS and OSC along the biosynthetic pathway and
  increased LDL uptake. The inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase
  (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the biosynthetic pathway, by statins induces
  drug resistance, whereas the reduction of LDL recycling and lipid absorption through
  extracellular lipid withdrawal or LIPG knockdown sensitizes cells to drug-induced
  apoptosis. Enzymes whose expression has been analyzed in this work are in bold red.
