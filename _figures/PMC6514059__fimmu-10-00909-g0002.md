caption: Expression of the NCRs and their Ligands. Schematic representation of the
  expression of the NCRs on NK cells and the NCR ligands by tumors (green) or pathogens
  or cells infected with pathogens (light blue). NKp30 and NKp46 are expressed by
  resting (pink) as well as activated (orange) NK cells, whereas NKp44 is only expressed
  by NK cells activated with IL-2 or IL-15 (arrow). PCNA, BAT3 and NKp44L are nuclear
  proteins but the pathways whereby they become expressed on the surface of tumor
  cells remain to be identified. NKp44L is a splice variant of the Mixed-lineage leukemia
  5 (MLL5) protein encoding a C-terminal modification reported to mediate cell-surface
  expression of NKp44L on tumor cells. Similarly, the pathway whereby vimentin becomes
  expressed on the surface of M. tuberculosis infected cells also remains to be described.
