caption: Hypoxia regulates other critical pathways that impact tumor progression in
  a HIF-independent fashion. A schematic diagram of signaling pathways which regulate
  mRNA translation is shown. These include the mTOR pathway and the integrated stress
  response. Hypoxia influences AMPK and REDD1 activity, which act upstream to inhibit
  mTOR kinase activity, resulting in a decrease in cap-dependent translation. Hypoxia
  also inhibits the ER resident kinase PERK, which phosphorylates eIF2α, resulting
  in global protein synthesis inhibition. While HIFs contribute to mTOR regulation
  via the induction of REDD1 during chronic hypoxia, all of these pathways can be
  regulated by O2 deprivation in a HIF-independent manner. Although the mechanisms
  for mTOR and PERK regulation by changes in O2 remain unclear, they represent important
  additional therapeutic targets.
