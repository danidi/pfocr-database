caption: Guanylyl cyclase-cGMP signaling pathway in melanocytes and non-metastatic
  and metastatic melanomas. cGMP signaling is involved in UVB-induced pigmentation
  of melanocytes (black color) and in NO-induced reduction of melanocyte adhesion
  to extracellular matrix (ECM) components like fibronectin (FN). Human melanocytes
  express GC-A and GC-B but are insensitive to ANP and CNP. Non-metastatic melanoma
  cells (NMMCs, red color) express the NO-sensitive sGC and the ANP-sensitive GC-A/CNP-sensitive
  GC-B. Absence of NO-sensitive sGC but upregulated expression and activities of GC-A/GC-B
  are related to the metastatic potential of melanoma cells (red color). Activation
  of CNP-GC-B-cGMP-PKGI pathway promotes melanoma growth/migration in a MAPK-dependent
  manner. The oncogenic BRAFV600E variant induces melanoma cell invasion by downregulating
  the cGMP-specific PDE5A. Tyr, tyrosinase MMCs, metastatic melanoma cells.
