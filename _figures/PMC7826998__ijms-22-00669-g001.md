caption: General scheme of pathways leading to production of different hormones. ABA
  and GAs share their biosynthetic pathway with other hormones, such as CKs. During
  fruit maturation, balance among hormone biosynthesis changes, and this involves
  carotenogenesis. IDP, isopentenyl diphosphate; GDP, geranyl diphosphate; FDP, farnesyl
  diphosphate; GGDP, geranyilgeranyl diphosphate . Number of arrows illustrate number
  of biosynthetic steps.
