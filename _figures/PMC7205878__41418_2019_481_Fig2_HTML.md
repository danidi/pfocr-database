caption: In the first example, Listeriolysin O (LLO) produced by Listeria monocytogenes
  mediates pore formation in the plasma membrane that facilitates cell-to-cell spread
  of the bacterium. The ATG16L1 complex restricts this spread by promoting plasma
  membrane repair through an autophagy-independent mechanism involving the exocytosis
  of lysosomes that confines the damage to surface blebs. In the second example, α-toxin
  secreted by Staphylococcus aureus binds ADAM10 on the surface of target cells such
  as the endothelium leading to cell death. The ATG16L1 complex downregulates ADAM10
  levels, limiting the availability of the receptor for α-toxin binding and promotes
  cell survival. In the third example, TNFα produced by immune cells in the gut in
  response to murine norovirus (MNV) infection is tolerated by intestinal epithelial
  cells when autophagy is intact. However, upon the disruption of the ATG16L1 complex
  and inhibition of mitophagy, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) licenses
  signaling through RIPK1 and RIPK3 downstream of the TNFα receptor (TNFR) resulting
  in the activation of MLKL, the pore-forming executioner molecule of the necroptosis
  pathway of programmed cell death.
