caption: 'A putative scheme of the cellular metabolism in the hydrogen producing arachaeon
  T. onnurineus NA1. A, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. B, pyruvate degradation. C,
  pentose phosphate synthesis and carbon dioxide fixation. D, pseudo-TCA cycle. E,
  amino acid degradation and aldehyde metabolism. F, propionate utilization. Dashed
  lines or faint italic letters represent pathways or enzymes not yet experimentally
  validated in Thermococcales species. Each protein with its predicted function in
  ion or solute transport, or H2 evolution or consumption, is illustrated on the membrane.
  Blue, red, and gray indicate proteins expressed prominently during growth on formate,
  CO, and starch, respectively. Major metabolic proteins deduced from the annotatable
  coding sequences (CDSs) were categorized by their induction on different substrates:
  formate (blue), CO (red), and starch (black). Other enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  pathway are designated by purple text, although they were mainly induced during
  growth on starch. Enzymes involved in sulfur reduction or ATP synthesis are shown
  in green, irrespective of their substrate specificity. Most proteins identified
  in T. onnurineus NA1 are shared by other Thermococcales: NPSOR (TON_0129), NADH:polysulfide
  oxidoreductase; FNR (TON_0056), ferredoxin-NADP(+) reductase; braC-4 (TON_0162),
  branched chain amino acid transporter; CbiOQ (TON_0243), ABC-type cobalt transport
  system; FepBCD (TON_0296), ABC-type Fe3+-siderophore transporter; FbpABC (TON_0983
  and TON_0985), ABC-type Fe3+ transporter; Pst (TON_1464 and TON_1551), hypothetical
  phosphate transporter; NhaC (TON_1517), Na+/H+ antiporter; MnhB (TON_1577), multisubunit
  Na+/H+ antiporter; AppABC/OppBCDF (TON_1764 and TON_1768), ABC-type dipeptide/oligopeptide
  transporter; MalEFGK (TON_1791 and TON_1795), ABC-type maltodextrin transporter;
  AAT, additional amino acid ABC transporter; Fdred, reduced ferredoxin; Fdox, oxidized
  ferredoxin. The abbreviations of all of the identified proteins are presented separately
  in  and supplemental Table S1.'
