caption: Pathway for induction of apoptosis in H. pylori-stimulated macrophages by
  an AP-1-dependent mechanism leading to polyamine-derived oxidative stress. As demonstrated
  in the current report, H. pylori causes activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by
  MEK1/2 that leads to nuclear translocation of pERK. This results in the induction
  of both c-Fos and c-Jun and the phosphorylation of c-Fos. pc-Fos and c-Jun form
  an AP-1 complex that binds to the c-Myc gene leading to expression of c-Myc mRNA
  and protein. This c-Myc protein in the cytoplasm translocates to the nucleus and
  enhances ODC transcription () in concert with activation of a purported H. pylori
  response element (HPRE). This induction of ODC leads to increased generation of
  the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. In parallel, H. pylori up-regulates
  the expression and activity of the enzyme spermine oxidase (SMO), which back-converts
  spermine to spermidine, a process that generates H2O2, which causes apoptosis through
  mitochondrial membrane depolarization ().
