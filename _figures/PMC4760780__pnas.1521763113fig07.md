caption: Proposed model for Usp12 function in the pathway of TCR signaling. A model
  for Usp12 function in TCR activation is illustrated. Following TCR engagement, protein
  tyrosine kinases are activated, resulting in phosphorylation of CD3 modules and
  further activation of downstream kinases and phosphorylation events. Phosphorylated
  LAT and SLP-76 associate with other adaptors, such as Trat1, Grb2, and PLCγ, resulting
  in formation of a multimeric complex. TCR and adaptor molecules, such as LAT, Trat1,
  and SLP-76, are constitutively monoubiquitylated to undergo internalization and
  recycling or degradation from the lysosomes. During TCR engagement and activation,
  Usp12 is translocated into the cytosol and deubiquitylates its substrates to stabilize
  the TCR signaling complex at the plasma membrane. In the absence of Usp12, formation
  of the multimeric complex at the plasma membrane is significantly diminished owing
  to reduced expression of adaptor molecules as well as the TCR, resulting in inhibition
  of NFκB and NFAT.
