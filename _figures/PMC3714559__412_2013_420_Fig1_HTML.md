caption: Model for resolving transcription-blocking lesions. i During transcription,
  UVSSA, USP7, and CSB interact transiently with elongating RNA Pol II. ii Upon encountering
  a lesion (indicated by star), stalled RNA Pol II stabilizes its binding with these
  proteins and triggers the recruitment of several other DNA repair factors, including
  CSA. Since RNA Pol II shields the DNA lesion in its active pocket, the stalled transcription
  complex must be remodeled to enable access of repair proteins to the lesion. In
  the case of helix-distorting lesions (iiia), TC-NER is initiated for which extensive
  modulation of stalled RNA Pol II is needed, causing a prolonged transcriptional
  arrest. During this slow process, CSB assembles a functional TC-NER complex and
  assists in the remodeling of RNA Pol II. In response to DNA damage, CSB is ubiquitinated
  and eventually degraded. In order to allow sufficient time for CSB to perform its
  function in TC-NER, its presence is protected by the concerted action of UVSSA and
  USP7 by counteracting the ubiquitination-dependent degradation. When the required
  remodeling of stalled RNA Pol II is completed, the TC-NER complex is destabilized
  and CSB is degraded by the proteasome. XPA, RPA, and the TFIIH complex are subsequently
  recruited. Following further helix unwinding and lesion verification, XPG and XPF
  are required for the double incision of the damaged DNA strand. The repair reaction
  is completed with DNA polymerase gap filling of the repair patch and sealing of
  the nicks. Oxidative lesions (iiib) have a minor effect on the DNA helix structure,
  which therefore requires relatively little remodeling of RNA Pol II for efficient
  repair. Consequently, RNA Pol II is only slowed down or transiently arrested in
  response to these lesions resulting in a faster response as compared to iiia. CSB
  remodeling helps to efficiently remove oxidative lesions likely via the BER pathway
  or to pass stalled complexes over the lesion (lesion bypass). However, due to the
  faster response, protection of CSB from ubiquitination-dependent degradation by
  UVSSA/USP7 is not necessary. After repair is completed (iv), transcription is resumed
