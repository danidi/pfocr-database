caption: miR-21 has been shown to inhibit both PTEN and RECK2 as well as to upregulate
  EGFR in gliomas. These pathways are directly linked to tumor immune suppression.
  In breast cancer, miR-155 has been shown to induce the STAT3 pathway []; it has
  yet to be explored in gliomas. The miRNAs highlighted in white text have been predicted
  to interact with STAT3, but this has not yet been demonstrated.
