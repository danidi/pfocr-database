caption: Comparison of Leu Biosynthesis with the Chain Elongation Pathway of Met-Derived
  Glucosinolate Biosynthesis.The enzymes and numbers of genes identified in silico
  in the Arabidopsis genome are given in gray. For acetohydroxyacid synthase genes,
  two regulatory subunits and a single catalytic subunit can be detected, and for
  isopropylmalate isomerase genes, at least one large and three small subunits can
  be detected in Arabidopsis. The dashed line indicates that 5-methylthio-2-oxopentanoate
  (or longer 2-oxo acids) can undergo another condensation step with acetyl-CoA for
  further chain elongation. Light-gray box, Leu biosynthesis; dark-gray box, chain
  elongation pathway of Met-derived glucosinolate biosynthesis. AHAS, acetohydroxyacid
  synthase; KARI, ketolacid reducto-isomerase; DHAD, dihydroxyacid dehydratase; IPMS,
  isopropylmalate synthase; IPMI, isopropylmalate isomerase (also called dehydratase);
  and IPMDH, isopropylmalate dehydrogenase.
