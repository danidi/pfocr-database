caption: (A) Enrichment of adenine nucleotide catabolites in pulmonary arterial blood
  during exercise. (Left) Intramuscular and extracellular metabolic reactions in the
  adenine nucleotide catabolism pathway. (Right) Patterns of change of individual
  metabolites in peripheral plasma from subjects undergoing ETT as well as pulmonary
  arterial (PA) and superior vena cava (SVC) plasma from subjects undergoing CPET.
  * P<0.05 for between group differences in metabolite levels in PA plasma vs. SVC
  plasma. ** P<0.05 for comparison of PA plasma metabolite levels vs. baseline.(B).
  Enrichment of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in pulmonary arterial blood
  during exercise. (Right) Patterns of change in individual TCA cycle intermediates
  in peripheral plasma from subjects undergoing ETT as well as in pulmonary arterial
  (PA) and superior vena cava (SVC) plasma from subjects undergoing CPET. * P<0.05
  for between group differences in metabolite levels in PA plasma vs. SVC plasma.
  ** P<0.05 for comparison of PA plasma metabolite levels vs. baseline
