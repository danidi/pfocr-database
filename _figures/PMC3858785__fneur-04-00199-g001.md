caption: Synaptic activity and energy homeostasis. During synaptic transmission, activation
  of glutamate receptors allows influx of a large amount of sodium and calcium. Rises
  in intracellular sodium are rebalanced by the sodium pump powered by ATP consumption.
  Cellular energy status is sensed by AMPK via a reduced ATP/AMP ratio and CaMKK-dependent
  calcium signaling, leading to enhanced mitochondria activity and ATP biogenesis.
  AMPK activity also activates the PI3K/AKT pathway, leading to enhanced glucose uptake
  by stimulating glucose transporter membrane expression and transport efficiency.
  Mitochondria are trafficked on microtubules into metabolically demanding synapses
  by binding to Milton/Miro-mediated kinesin motor complex. In conditions of neurotrauma
  and neurodegenerative diseases, several aspects of this regulation may be disrupted.
  During hypoxia, ischemia, and stroke, insufficient ATP levels cause dysfunction
  of the sodium pump, leading to a loss in membrane potential and neuronal function.
  AD brains show reduced levels of GLUT3, and both AD and HD brains have a reduced
  rate of neuronal glucose metabolism. Mouse models of AD and PD show mitochondrial
  dysfunction along with reduced mitochondrial motility, preventing proper mitochondria
  delivery to the synapse and leading to decreased energy metabolism. Brains of traumatic
  injuries show reduced ATP levels and suppressed mitochondrial function.
