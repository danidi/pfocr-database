caption: Schematic representation of chiral 3HV production via the threonine biosynthesis
  pathway in metabolically engineered E. coli. Genes in bold are overexpressed while
  disrupted pathway steps are indicted by the "no" symbols. The carbon sources and
  main metabolic products in the system are enclosed by rectangular boxes with thick
  and thin lines, respectively. For glycerol utilization [,], a glycerol kinase (GK)
  phosphorylates glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate, followed by oxidation to dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate that enters glycolysis. The oxidation reaction is catalyzed by a membrane
  enzyme called glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GlpD) with concomitant production
  of ubiquinol (UQH2) from ubiquinone (UQ). Electrons stored in the ubiquinol are
  then transferred through the aerobic respiratory chain coupled with proton translocation
  from cytoplasm to periplasm. Both ATP and NADPH can be synthesized by an H+-driven
  proton movement from periplasm to cytoplasm, catalyzed by an ATP synthase and a
  membrane-bound transhydrogenase (PntAB), respectively.
