caption: Regulation of chromosome replication by S-phase checkpoint response in budding
  yeast (see text for details). Dotted lines indicate minor functions, and question
  marks denote putative roles that are not well established. For the sake of simplicity,
  the regulation of mitosis by checkpoint kinases has been omitted.
