caption: A model for torpor induction in mammals that links reduced availability of
  food in the environment with the energy status of the cell, the mammalian circadian
  clock, and response to oxidative stress. An animal begins to fast as a result of
  reduced availability of food in the environment. Fasting results in depletion of
  cellular nutrients and increased intracellular concentrations of 5′-adenosine monophosphate
  (AMP) and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). As intracellular [NAD+]
  increases, the activity of silent mating type information regulation 2 - homolog
  1 (SIRT1) deacetylase is also increased. Activated SIRT1 can enter the nucleus and
  deacetylate many targets including the core circadian clock protein, brain and muscle
  aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (BMAL1). Deacetylation of BMAL1 inhibits
  transcriptional activation of genes that are regulated by the heterodimeric transcription
  factor complex formed between BMAL1 and circadian locomotor output cycles kaput
  (BMAL1:CLOCK). This might prolong a gene expression profile that is typical of that
  during an animal’s inactive period, e.g. when the animal is normally resting. SIRT1
  might also activate nuclear receptor proteins that promote transcription of enzymes
  that function in lipolysis and in resistance to hypoxic stress (hypoxia inducible
  factor-2α; HIF-2α). Activation of lipolytic enzymes is part of the switch from carbohydrate
  to lipid-based metabolism. SIRT1 might increase biosynthesis of its own activating
  cofactor, NAD+, by deacetylation and activation of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase
  (NAMPT). NAMPT is the rate-limiting enzyme in the major NAD+ salvage pathway of
  mammals that reinforces SIRT1 activity. Fasting induced nutrient depletion also
  causes increased intracellular [AMP] and results in increased activation of adenosine
  monophosphate kinase (AMPK). AMPK acts to promote the switch to lipid-based metabolism
  by down-regulating glycolysis via phosphorylation of the nuclear receptor, carbohydrate
  responsive element binding protein (ChREBP). Small molecules are indicated by green
  hexagons. Proteins are indicated by ovals of various colors. Biochemical processes
  are indicated in purple boxes. Whole organism phenotypes are indicated in light-blue
  boxes. ↑ = increase and ↓ = decrease.
