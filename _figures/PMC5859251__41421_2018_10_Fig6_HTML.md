caption: Viral dsDNA, or self-dsDNA, is sensed by cGAS and other DNA sensors such
  as DDX41 and IFI16. cGAS catalyzes the synthesis of cGAMP, which functions as a
  second messenger to activate STING–TBK1–IRF3 pathway, leading to IFN-I production.
  NF-κB pathway is also activated by TBK1 to trigger proinflammatory cytokine production.
  These cytokines are crucial to mediate an efficient antiviral immune response. TRIM29
  is induced by DNA virus and cytosolic DNA stimulation, and targets STING for K48
  ubiquitination and degradation, therefore downregulates STING-dependent signaling
  pathway, to prevent the overcommitted immune response
