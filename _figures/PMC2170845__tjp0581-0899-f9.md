caption: Five-state kinetic scheme for the interpretation of KAAT1 amino acid competition
  T1 represents the empty, outward-facing state of the transporters, to which cations
  (and possibly Cl−) may bind leading to state T2 which enables interaction with amino
  acids. The scheme is intended to simulate the competition of leucine (left branch
  of the scheme T3 → T5) with other amino acids (aa) (right branch T4 → T5) and with
  central leak pathway T2 → T5. T5 represents the inward-facing conformation that
  releases the substrates to the cytosol before rearranging to the initial state to
  complete the cycle.
