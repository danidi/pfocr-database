caption: Fungus-induced changes in expression of the wheat lignin biosynthesis pathway.
  A, Schematic of pathways leading to lignin formation in plants. Metabolite analysis
  of Z. tritici-infected wheat leaves identified increased levels of Phe and ferulate
  during the late stages of infection. B, Relative expression changes of lignin biosynthetic
  pathway components in wheat leaves from 1 to 14  with Z. tritici. Green shading
  indicates significant down-regulation (adjusted P < 0.05), while red shading indicates
  up-regulation (adjusted P < 0.05). PAL, Phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase; C3H, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeic acid O-methyl transferase;
  F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase;
  CCoA-3H, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; CCoA-OMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase;
  CAD, cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase.
