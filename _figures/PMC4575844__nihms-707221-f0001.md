caption: Biosynthetic scheme for production of reticuline from L-tyrosine. (A) Engineered
  yeast aromatic amino acid synthesis for the production of BIA precursors L-tyrosine
  and 4-hydroxyphenylacetylaldehyde (4-HPAA). (B) Engineered biosynthetic pathway
  from L-tyrosine to reticuline. Enzymes labeled in black indicate unmodified yeast
  enzymes, red indicate modified yeast enzymes, blue indicate heterologous enzymes.
