caption: 'The mGluR5 / APP Signaling Nexus: The feedback regulation between mGluR5
  and APP/Aβ is complex and complicated by the involvement of FMRP and PrPC. APP synthesis
  is regulated through a FMRP- and mGluR5-dependent signaling pathway []. The phosphorylation
  status of FMRP regulates its association with actively translating polyribosomes
  []. The generation of APP provides template for cleavage of α-, β- and γ-secretases
  to produce a multitude of APP metabolites, which have varied functions at the synapse
  []. One of those metabolites, A β, associates with PrPC, which acts as a bridge
  between mGluR5 and A β to form a complex that modulates neuronal signaling [–].
  The potential role of PrPC in FXS has not been studied. Moving forward, it will
  be important to explore the temporal and spatial expression and function of APP,
  APP metabolites, APP secretases, PrPC, mGluR5 and FMRP in control and FXS models.'
