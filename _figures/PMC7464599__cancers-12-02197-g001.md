caption: 'Schematic of the reduction of hydroperoxides by selenocysteine-containing
  glutathione peroxidases (GPx). The selenolate state (GPx-Se-) reduces hydroperoxides
  to water to form the oxidized selenenic acid (GPx-SeOH). GPx-SeOH reacts with GSH
  to generate selenenyl sulfide (GPx-SeSG), which is regenerated to the active selenol
  following nucleophilic attack of a second GSH and formation of oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG). GSSG is reduced back to GSH by glutathione reductase (GR). Nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) reducing equivalents for this reaction are
  mainly derived from isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH)1/2, including the forward reaction
  of IDH2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and via the reduction of glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P) in the pentose phosphate pathway by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH).
  (Enzymes are indicated by boxes; α-KG: α-ketoglutarate; IC: isocitrate; 6PG: 6-phospho-gluconate).'
