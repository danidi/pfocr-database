caption: Relationship of bm2 to the lignin biosynthetic pathway. Modified biosynthetic
  pathway of monolignols (; ). The MTHFR (BM2) enzyme catalyzes the conversion of
  5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which serves as a methyl
  donor to convert homocysteine to methionine. SAMS catalyzes the conversion of methionine
  to SAM, which is a methyl donor for CCoAOMT and COMT. The number of genes in families
  with at least one gene differentially expressed between bm2 mutants and wild-type
  siblings is indicated by the number of rectangles. The number of significantly up-
  and down-regulated genes in bm2 mutants relative to wild-type siblings are shown
  in blue and red, respectively. PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:shikimate
