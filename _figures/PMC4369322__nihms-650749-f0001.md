caption: A model for the integral role of the Rad6 DNA damage tolerance pathway in
  coordinating the activities of Fanconi anemia (FA) network and homologous recombination
  repair (HRR) pathway in interstrand DNA crosslink (ICL) repair. In conjunction with
  Rad18 E3 ligase, Rad6 activates the error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS) component
  of DNA damage tolerance by inducing PCNA monoubiquitination and recruitment of TLS
  polymerases. Evidence suggests that Rad6/Rad18 can also mediate FANCD2 monoubiquitination
  and activation of FA network [, ]. Besides its role in BRCA-HRR, monoubiquitinated
  FANCD2 also partakes in TLS by recruiting TLS polymerase Pol η. In addition to their
  involvement in TLS, PCNA and Pol η enable HRR by regulating extension of D-loop
  structures. The error-free arm of DNA damage tolerance or template switching is
  accomplished by PCNA polyubiquitination. Here the K63-linked polyubiquitin chains
  assembled by Rad6 are transferred en bloc to PCNA via HLTF E3 ligase.
