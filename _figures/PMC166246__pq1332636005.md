caption: TGF-β enhances lung metastases despite suppressive effects on primary tumor
  formation. The onset of Neu-induced mammary tumors is delayed by expression of an
  activated TβRI and accelerated by a dominant negative TβRII. However, activation
  of TGF-β signaling enhances extravasation of Neu-induced mammary tumor cells into
  lung tissue, which can be impaired by inhibition of the TGF-β pathway.
