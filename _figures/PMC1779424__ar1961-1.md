caption: 'Metabolic pathways involved in the production of endogenous ceramide. Endogenous
  ceramide is produced via 2 main mechanisms: a catabolic pathway, involving the hydrolysis
  of the membrane lipid sphingomyelin by endosomal acidic and membrane-bound neutral
  SMases; and de novo synthesis. TNF-α can increase cellular ceramide via both mechanisms.
  The rise in ceramide can create a positive feedback loop to amplify ceramide production
  further via the activation of SMases. Once generated, ceramide can transiently accumulate
  within the cell or be converted into various metabolites such as sphingosine and
  sphingosine-1-phosphate. Cell responses to ceramide will therefore depend on the
  engagement of downstream effectors, the cell microenvironment and concomitant activation
  of enzymes that convert ceramide into other metabolites. CoA, coenzyme A; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; SMase, sphingomyelinase; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.'
