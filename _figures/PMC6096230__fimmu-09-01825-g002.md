caption: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) recruit induced Tregs (iTregs) by activating
  Notch signaling. When cocultured with CD4+ cells, MSCs induced a T-cell population
  with a regulatory phenotype (iTregs) (). NOTCH1 pathway is activated in CD4+ T cells
  cocultured with MSCs. Inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling through γ-secretase inhibitor
  (GSI)-I or the NOTCH1 neutralizing antibody reduced expression of HES1 and the percentage
  of MSC-induced CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ cells in vitro ().
