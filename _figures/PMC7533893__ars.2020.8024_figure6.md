caption: The role of NRF2 in regulation of cancer cell metabolism. NRF2, activated
  through canonical or noncanonical pathways, regulates carbon utilization. Glycolytic
  flux at the level of G6P is driven toward UDP-Glc and glucoronate synthesis, as
  well as toward the PPP cycle, to support the synthesis of ribose and NADPH. Glycolytic
  flux supports Ser and Gly synthesis by upregulating PHGDH. Glutathione synthesis
  is supported by cystine import and glycine synthesis. Cystine import is connected
  to glutamate export by Xc− transporter. Fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation
  (β-ox) are both regulated by NRF2. NRF2 also regulates synthesis of polyamines by
  regulation of MAT2A expression. Pathways upregulated by NRF2 signaling are designated
  by red arrows. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; Gly, glycine; PPP, pentose-phosphate pathway;
  Ser, serine; UDP-Glc, UDP-glucose. Color images are available online.
