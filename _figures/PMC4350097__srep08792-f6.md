caption: The LIM domain was proposed to repress CHS3 activities in the absence of
  pathogens. SGT1b, which can form a chaperone complex with HSP90 and RAR1, is probably
  required for the proper assembly of CHS3 activation complex. CHS3 activation relies
  on its TNL neighbour CSA1, and this signaling pathway appears to primarily rely
  on SAG101 and EDS1-90.
