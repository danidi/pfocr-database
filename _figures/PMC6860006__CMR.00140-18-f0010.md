caption: Neutrophils and their different anti-A. fumigatus activities. Neutrophil
  chemotaxis occurs in two waves and is regulated by (a) epithelium-dependent IL1R/MyD88
  signaling and (b) inflammatory monocyte-mediated CARD9 signaling pathways. PTX-3
  production by myeloid cells facilitates the anti-A. fumigatus killing by neutrophils.
  Neutrophils employ mainly ROS-dependent mechanisms of killing against intracellular
  (conidia) and extracellular (hyphae) fungal morphotypes. Intracellular killing of
  conidia is mediated by induction of apoptotic-type fungal cell death induced by
  ROS. Type I IFN and type III interferon signaling occuring via IFNLR1 in neutrophils
  is a pathway critical for optimal ROS production. IL-17A autocrine production via
  IL-6/IL-23 and Dectin-2 signaling is required for optimal ROS production. ROS-independent
  mechanisms of conidia leading to intracellular inhibition are mediated by Zn and
  Fe starvation by lactoferrin and other effectors. ROS-induced NETosis is another
  mechanism of inhibition of Aspergillus hyphae without a clear role in immunity in
  vivo.
