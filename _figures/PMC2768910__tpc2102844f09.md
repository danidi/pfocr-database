caption: A Hypothetical Model for Plastid Targeting of Glycoproteins from the Golgi
  Apparatus through the Secretory Pathway.The plastid-destined glycoproteins, such
  as AmyI-1 and NPP1, are synthesized in the ER lumen and transported to the Golgi
  apparatus. Plastid targeting of glycoproteins is prevented by the drug Brefeldin
  A and/or mutants of ARF1 and SAR1, indicating that membrane trafficking is essential
  to their plastid targeting. The Golgi bodies with cargo, which are specialized for
  delivering cargo to the plastids, might move to the plastid in a targeting signal–dependent
  manner, after which small membrane vesicles derived from the Golgi adhere to the
  envelope membrane of the plastid. Both the membrane component and glycoprotein cargo
  are eventually imported into the interior of the plastid through the envelope membranes
  via as yet unknown translocation machinery.
