caption: 'Schematic overview ofP. knowlesi reactions in structural phospholipid biosynthesis
  as demonstrated by experimental work. Solid lines correspond to metabolite transport
  or biochemical reactions with an identified enzyme whereas dotted line correspond
  to reaction identified with unidentified enzyme. Squares represent the phospholipid
