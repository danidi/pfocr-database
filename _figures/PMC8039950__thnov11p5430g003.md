caption: The function and underlying mechanisms of sialylated IgG (s-IgG) in myeloid
  and B cells. A. Upon IL-33 secretion by myeloid cells after s-IgG binding to DC-SIGN/SIGN-R1
  (1), basophils produce IL-4, thus upregulating inhibitory FcγRIIb on CSF1-independent
  effector macrophages and resulting in increased anti-inflammatory effects. Additionally,
  CDC and ADCC activity decreases due to the reduced affinity of s-IgG for C1q (2)
  and activating FcγRs (3), respectively, which lead to a reduced proinflammatory
  effect. B. s-IgG can bind to CD23 (4) and increase the expression of inhibitory
  FcγRIIb on B cells. S-IgGs can also bind to CD22 (5) in an Fc-dependent manner and
  induce inhibitory SHP-1 recruitment, which inhibits BCR and TLR signaling pathways
  in B cells, further inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, downregulating the expression
  of MHC II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 molecules and decreasing the expression of IL-6.
