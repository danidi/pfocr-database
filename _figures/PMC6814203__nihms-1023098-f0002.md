caption: Endogenous (left side) and pharmacologic (right side) STING agonists elicit
  similar, but slightly different anti-tumor immune responses. The endogenous immune
  response involves tumor cell (purple cell) activation of CD11c+ cells (orange cells)
  that leads to type 1 IFN (red dots) signaling and Batf3+ DC (red cell) maturation.
  This, in turn, leads to CD8+ T cell (blue cell) cross priming and recruitment by
  CXCL9/10 (green dots). CD8+ T cells can then kill tumor cells (black cells). Treatment
  with intratumoral STING agonists (green dots) differs because the agonists are membrane
  permeable and therefore might activate a wider range of cell types including tumor
  cells, fibroblasts (brown cells), and endothelial cells (red vessels). Pharmacologic
  agonists also induce endothelial cell death, elicit higher IFN-β expression, and
  more CD8+ T cell cross-priming, which can lead to tumor clearance in preclinical
  models.
