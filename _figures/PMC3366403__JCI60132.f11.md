caption: Lung level of SIRT1 is reduced in response to CS or oxidative/carbonyl stress,
  which leads to acetylation and degradation of FOXO3 and culminates in stress-induced
  premature senescence. The senescence of lung cells is a contributing factor to airspace
  enlargement and emphysema. NF-κB is also acetylated and activated in response to
  CS exposure as a result of SIRT1 reduction. However, inhibition of NF-κB–dependent
  lung inflammation does not prevent the progression of airspace enlargement. SIRT1
  activation by overexpression and pharmacological means protects the lungs against
  cellular senescence and emphysematous changes.
