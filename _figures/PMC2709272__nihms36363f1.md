caption: Wnt/β-catenin signaling in preadipocytes is initiated by expression of Wnt10b,
  Wnt10a, and Wnt6. Binding of these Wnts to transmembrane frizzled receptors and
  LRP coreceptors inhibits GSK3β leading to hypophosphorylation and stabilization
  of β-catenin in the cytoplasm. β-catenin is then translocated to the nucleus where
  it binds TCF/LEF transcription factors and activates downstream targets to inhibit
  preadipocyte differentiation. Factors from other inhibitory pathways converge on
  the Wnt/β-catenin pathway to block adipocyte conversion. TNFα signals through its
  receptor, TNFα receptor-1, to stabilize β-catenin and activate downstream pathways.
  Testosterone inhibits adipogenesis in part by stimulating interactions between androgen
  receptor and β-catenin. This complex travels to the nucleus to promote β-catenin-mediated
  gene transcription. DKK1 and Wnt5b are transiently induced during adipogenesis and
  stimulate preadipocyte differentiation. DKK1 prevents Wnt signaling by inhibiting
  LRP coreceptors, while Wnt5b promotes differentiation through an unknown mechanism.
  As adipogenesis proceeds, the expression of another Wnt inhibitor, Cby, is induced.
  Cby binds β-catenin in the nucleus and prevents coactivation of TCF/LEF transcription
  factors. Finally, binding of β-catenin to PPARγ leads to rapid degradation of β-catenin
  through a mechanism that involves the proteosome. (−) indicates factors that inhibit
  preadipocyte differentiation and (+) denotes factors that stimulate the process.
