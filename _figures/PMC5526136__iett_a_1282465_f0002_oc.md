caption: Targeting endothelial cell metabolism induces tumor vessel normalization.
  a. Schematic representation of the glycolytic pathway converting glucose into pyruvate.
  PFKFB3 is a key regulator of glycolysis by producing fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P2),
  the most potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  F6P, fructose-6-phosphate; F2,6P2, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate; PFK, phospho-fructokinase;
  3PG, 3-phospho glyceraldehyde; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; ATP, cellular adenosine
  5สน-trisphosphate.b. Upon inhibition of PFKFB3 in hyperglycolytic tumor endothelial
  cells, tumor vessels show smoother endothelial surface, reduced intercellular gaps,
  more prominent basement membrane and increased pericyte coverage. All these changes
  improve tumor vessel perfusion and thereby lower hypoxia, contributing to reduced
  invasion, intravasation and metastasis. Adapted from [].
