caption: Regulation of HDL homeostasis by miRNAs. The liver is the site of HDL biogenesis,
  where ABCA1-mediated lipidation of lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) generates
  nascent HDL. Free cholesterol (FC) on nascent HDL particles is esterified to cholesteryl
  esters (CE) by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), converting nascent HDL
  to mature HDL. In turn, ABCG1 mediates cholesterol transfer to mature HDL. CETP
  mediates CE transfer from HDL to apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins (VLDL/LDL)
  in exchange for triglycerides (TG), promoting plasma cholesterol clearance by uptake
  of VLDL/LDL lipoproteins through the LDLR pathway. Hepatic SR-BI mediates removal
  of FC and CE from HDL, through the selective uptake pathway, and excess cholesterol
  is excreted from the liver into the bile. Both the ABC11 and ATP8B1 transporters
  promote hepatic clearance, directly via biliary lipid secretion and indirectly via
  arrangement of adequate canalicular membrane phospholipid asymmetry required for
  bile salt movement, respectively (net cholesterol movement out of the liver is depicted
  for simplicity). Numerous miRNAs regulate genes involved in cholesterol efflux and
  HDL homeostasis in various tissues, including the liver, brain and macrophage. Other
  microRNAs, such as miR-223, are carried on HDL particles and mediate extracellular
  signaling by repressing genes in target tissues. Black lines with a right angle
  at the end represent miRNA target genes that are repressed.
