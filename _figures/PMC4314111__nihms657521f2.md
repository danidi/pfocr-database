caption: (A) miRNA precursors are expressed as stem-loop structures, which (B) interact
  with Drosha and DGR8, where they are processed then exported from the nucleus by
  Exportin 5. (C) These transcripts are further processed by Dicer to small (21–23
  nt) dsRNAs, one strand of which is loaded into AGO component of the RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC). Exogenously introduced siRNAs can also be processed by
  RISC. Either the endogenous miRNA or exogenously added siRNAs can then to target
  (D) the repression of translation and/or (E) cleavage of homology containing transcripts,.
  Some small RNAs are functional in the nucleus. (F) Exogenously introduced small
  antisense RNAs (asRNAs) can target epigenetic silencing of targeted loci,,, a pathway
  that miRNAs may also utilize in the nucleus. (G) tiRNAs and spliRNAs, are also expressed
  through an unknown pathway that may involve RNAPII backtracking and TFIIS cleavage,
  with the tiRNAs shown to modulate CTCF chromatin localization and to be associated
  with nucleosome position.
