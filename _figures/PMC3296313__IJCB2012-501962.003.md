caption: A schematic of signaling pathways activated by the Rho GTPases in macrophages.
  Generic GEFs and GAPs are designated as upstream regulators of Cdc42, Rac, and Rho
  activity. Downstream signaling molecules specifically labeled in the schematic are
  those that are described in the text. Signaling pathway outcomes are depicted for
  actin cytoskeleton responses only. Regulation of adhesion by Rho GTPases in macrophages
  is not shown as the signaling pathways are not yet elucidated.
