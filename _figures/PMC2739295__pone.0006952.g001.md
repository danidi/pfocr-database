caption: 'To identify genes whose transcription is affected by γ-secretase activity,
  two starkly contrasting conditions were analyzed by cDNA microarray: genetically
  engineered enhanced γ-secretase (left panel) and pharmacologically inhibited γ-secretase
  (right panel) in CHO cell lines. For a schematic depiction of the strategy, the
  Notch-1 receptor signaling pathway is used as an example. After processing by the
  Furin protease and when activated by binding to its ligands Notch-1 is cleaved at
  the S2 position by the TACE protease, generating a substrate for γ-secretase (1,
  7). Under enhanced (left panel) or inhibited (right panel) γ-secretase activity,
  the cleavage of the substrate controls the release of the Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD) (2, 8). With enhanced γ-secretase, increased numbers of NICDs enter the nucleus
  and interact with CSL (3), leading to the transcription of target genes like Hes1
  and Hey (4). The Hes1 transcription repressor inhibits transcription of target genes
  like NC3C1 (5), with the final consequence being reduced production of NC3C1 mRNA
  (6). Thus, enhancing γ-secretase leads simultaneously to gene-dependent increase
  (in the case of Hes/Hey) or decrease (in the case of NC3C1) of mRNA copy numbers.
  With inhibited γ-secretase, reduced numbers of NICDs (9) lead to the transcription
  of less Hes1/Hey (10), to reduced inhibition of target genes like NC3C1 (11) and
  consequently to increased production of NC3C1 mRNA (12). Inhibiting γ-secretase
  thus leads to gene-dependent decrease (in the case of Hes/Hey genes) or increase
  (in the case of NC3C1) of mRNA copy numbers. Following mouse cDNA microarray analysis
  of both transcriptomes, top scoring candidates were evaluated and validated by real
  time PCR and further analyzed for changes of transcript levels between healthy and
  AD human brain cortices.'
