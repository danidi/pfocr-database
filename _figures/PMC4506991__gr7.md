caption: Proposed mechanisms of bilirubin modulation of TLR4 signaling. The interaction
  of LPS with TLR4 activates the MyD88-dependent pathway (leading to the up-regulation
  of IL-6), and the TRIF-dependent pathway (which induces the expression of Inf-β).
  LPS further stimulates the TLR4-dependent activity of Nox, resulting in the generation
  of superoxide that dismutates to form hydrogen peroxide. Intracellular hydrogen
  peroxide stimulates the nuclear translocation and interaction of HIF-1α with ARNT,
  which binds to the HRE in the iNOS promoter and induces gene expression. TCDD activates
  the translocation and binding of AhR to ARNT, causing up-regulation of Cyp1A1 through
  binding to the xenobiotic response element (XRE). Reciprocal activation of Cyp1A1
  and iNOS appears to occur as a result of competition for ARNT binding. Bilirubin
  inhibits the LPS-stimulated induction of iNOS by scavenging Nox-derived ROS, and
  also suppresses the TLR4-dependent up-regulation of Inf-β. Due to the relatively
  weak activation of AhR by physiological concentrations of bilirubin, it is unclear
  whether this mechanism plays a significant role in iNOS regulation under normal
  circumstances.
