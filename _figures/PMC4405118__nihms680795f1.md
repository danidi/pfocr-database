caption: A. In the pathway-off state Patched (Ptch) catalytically inhibits Smoothened
  (Smo) activity through an unidentified intermediate. Suppressor of Fused (SuFu)
  mediates cleavage of Gli2 and Gli3 into their repressor forms, lacking transactivation
  domains. The Gli2/3 repressors translocate to the nucleus where they repress transcription
  by binding target gene promoter sequences. B. Shh binding to Ptch inhibits its catalytic
  repression of Smo, resulting in activation of Smo and degradation of SuFu. In the
  absence of SuFu, Gli2/3 are phosphorylated to become the activator forms. Gli2/3
  activators translocate to the nucleus where they promote transcription by recruiting
  other transcriptional activators to target gene promoters.
