caption: Role of ERRα in regulating cellular oxidative capacity. PGC-1α coactivates
  and regulates the expression of a number of transcription factors, including ERRα,
  PPARα, and NRFs, involved in mediating PGC-1α effects on cellular metabolism. PGC-1α
  regulation of ERRα and NRF-2 expression involves both cross- and auto-regulatory
  mechanisms (, ). Data presented in the current study demonstrated that ERRα likely
  directs PGC-1α upregulation of PPARα. In response to PGC-1α, activation of the NRF
  cascade regulates genes involved in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis, whereas
  activation of the PPARα pathway regulates fatty acid uptake and mitochondrial oxidation
  enzymes. ERRα may also directly regulate metabolic target genes in both pathways.
