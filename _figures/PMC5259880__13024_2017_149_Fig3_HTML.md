caption: 'The molecular mechanisms dysregulated in PD and thought to lead to DAergic
  neuronal cell death. Up to now, 14 genes have been consistently associated with
  familial PD (red circles; []). The analysis of the functions of the corresponding
  (mutated) proteins and the resulting cellular abnormalities has allowed the identification
  of the depicted main pathways underlying PD: mitochondrial, proteasomal and autophagy
  dysfunction, protein aggregation, dopamine metabolism and oxidative stress, leading
  to DAergic cell death [–]. Green circles: compounds dysregulating multiple cellular
  processes linked to PD and used to mimic PD with dotted lines pointing towards their
  targets. Orange circles: drugs that specifically act on one of the processes are
  placed next to their targeted pathway'
