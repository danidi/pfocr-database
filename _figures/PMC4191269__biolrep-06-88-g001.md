caption: (A) Transport fluxes that reach the Golgi (black arrow) activate signaling
  responses (red dotted arrows) to accelerate anterograde traffic through the Golgi
  to the plasma membrane (PM) as well as retrograde traffic to the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) (blue arrows). A prolonged activation of this Golgi signaling results in transcriptional
  regulation of many transport machinery genes and other genes (green dotted arrows)
  presumably to support long-term adaptations of the transport apparatus to sustained
  overloads. (B) Molecular components of the Golgi control system. Transport from
  the ER to Golgi (black arrow) carries ER chaperones to the Golgi, where they bind
  to, and activate, the KDELR that promotes the activation of Golgi Gq and Gs (red
  dotted arrows). Gq activation induces the acceleration of anterograde traffic through
  the Golgi and transport from Golgi to PM by the activation of Src and a phosphorylation
  cascade (blue arrow). Gs leads to the activation of the Golgi-based adenylyl cyclase
  AC9 to increase cAMP levels (spatially restricted within the Golgi area by PDE71A).
  Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) then activates protein kinase A (PKA), which
  activates retrograde transport via the phosphorylation of specific components to
  regulate retrograde traffic (blue arrow). The prolonged activation of the KDELR
  and of PKA results in the phosphorylation and activation of CAMP-responsive element
  binding protein 1 (CREB1) and possibly of other cAMP/PKA-regulated transcription
  factors (SP1, AP2, and ATF1/3). This results in the upregulation of many transport
  machinery genes as well as of a large number of genes involved in other functions,
  such as lipid and energy metabolism (green dotted arrows). The original observations
  on which these schemes are based upon are reported in [,,]. ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi
  intermediate compartment; N, nucleus.
