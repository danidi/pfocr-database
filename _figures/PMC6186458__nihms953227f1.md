caption: The intrinsic pathway is initiated by death stimuli including DNA damage,
  ER stress, anoikis, and deprivation of cytokines, growth factors or nutrients, resulting
  in transcriptional or post-translational activation of BH3-only molecules (BH3s).
  Activator BH3s, including BID, BIM, PUMA, and NOXA, directly activate BAX and BAK
  to induce the homo-oligomerization of BAX and BAK, leading to mitochondrial outer
  member premeabilization (MOMP) and release of cytochrome c and SMAC from the mitochondrial
  intermembrane space to the cytosol. Upon binding to cytochrome c and dATP, APAF-1
  oligomerizes into a heptameric complex known as the apoptosome, resulting in the
  recruitment and activation of caspase-9 and subsequent activation of effector caspase-3/7.
  The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis is initiated by engagement of cell surface death
  receptors, such as FAS or TRAIL receptors, resulting in the recruitment of adaptor
  proteins such as FAS-associated death domain (FADD). FADD then dimerizes with procaspase-8
  to form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and promote the auto-activation
  of procaspase-8. In ‘type I’ cells with low expression of the caspase inhibitor
  XIAP, such as T-lymphocytes, death receptor mediated caspase-8 activation is sufficient
  to activate effector caspase-3/-7. In ‘type II’ cells with high expression of XIAP,
  such as hepatocytes, effector caspase activation requires a mitochondrial amplification
  loop to alleviate XIAP-mediated caspase inhibition through mitochondrial release
  of SMAC. Caspase-8 mediated proteolytic cleavage of cytosolic BID into truncated
  BID (tBID) activates BAX and BAK-dependent MOMP, connecting the extrinsic pathway
  to the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.
