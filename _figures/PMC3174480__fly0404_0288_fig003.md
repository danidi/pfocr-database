caption: (A) Lgl/aPKC regulates Yki activity by promoting the formation of Hpo/RASSF                         complexes.
  Lgl/aPKC regulate the SWH pathway by favoring the formation of                         inactive
  Hpo/Rassf over active Hpo/Sav protein complexes. Hpo/Rassf are                         unable
  to phophorylate Yki. Consequently, pYki levels are reduced and                         dephosphorylated
  Yki enters the nucleus to form a complex with Scalloped                         (Sd)
  and activate SWH pathway targets. Perhaps the mislocalization and                         formation
  of Hpo/Rassf complexes is due to disruptions in endocytosis. (B).                         Crb
  regulates Yki activity by reducing the levels of Ex/Yki complexes. Crb                         regulates
  the SWH pathway through direct interactions with Ex. Crb/Ex/Yki                         form
  a tripartite complex and Yki is sequestered in the cytoplasm and                         prevented
  from entering the nucleus by binding to Expanded (Ex). The                         overexpression
  of Crb reduces Ex/Yki complexes, freeing Yki to enter the                         nucleus,
  interact with Scalloped (Sd) and activate SWH target genes. It is                         possible
  that Ex/Yki complexes are regulated by ubiquitination and/or                         proteolysis.
  crb mutant tissue also shows overgrowth due to                         deregulation
  of Notch endocytosis but the influence of Notch signaling on                         SWH
  pathway targets remains to be determined.
