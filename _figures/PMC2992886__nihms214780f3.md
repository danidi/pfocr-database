caption: Genes associated with autoimmunity regulate the CD40/NF-κB signaling pathway.
  The CD40/NF-κB pathway regulates numerous immune-related functions, such as T and
  B cell proliferation and activation. After association with its ligand, CD40 trimerizes
  and translocates to lipid rafts, where it interacts with intracellular mediators,
  including TNF receptor–associated factors (TRAF)1 and 2, which mediate activation
  of the I κB kinase (IKK) complex. Through phosphorylation, IKK targets the I κB
  molecule for destruction, which releases NF-κB to translocate into the nucleus and
  bind to promoter regions of target genes. The NF-κB pathway is regulated by the
  inhibitor A20 (encoded by TNFAIP3) and by TRAF1, both found to be associated with
  autoimmune disorders. Interestingly, CD40 has also been detected in the nucleus
  of B cells, where it interacts with c-rel and initiates transcription of target
  genes. Both CD40 and c-rel are recently discovered candidate genes for rheumatoid
  arthritis (RA) (see text).
