caption: 'Representation illustrating the interactions of Fusobacterium nucleatum
  in colorectal cancer. Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) presents the virulence
  factors FadA and Fap2 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which are recognized by Toll-like
  receptors (TLR2 and TLR4) mediating F. nucleatum invasion and the promotion of colorectal
  cancer (CRC). FadA, a surface adhesion protein, can bind to E-cadherin on CRC cells,
  activating B-catenin signalling. Fap2, a galactose-sensitive haemagglutinin and
  adhesion protein binding to Gal-GalNAc, contributes to the invasive ability of F.
  nucleatum. The TLR2/TLR4/MYD88 pathway is activated in response to F. nucleatum,
  leading to the activation of NF-κB, a transcription factor that is involved in regulating
  the expression of many genes, leading to elevated expression levels of oncogenes
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines, mainly interleukin (IL)1B, IL6, IL8 and tumour necrosis
  factor, inducing the production of reactive oxygen species, which subsequently lead
  to inflammation and DNA damage that promotes tumour growth and progression. Furthermore,
  these pathways may be under the regulation of differentially expressed microRNAs.
