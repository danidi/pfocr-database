caption: Biosynthetic relationships between amino acids, as defined by their biosyntheses
  and their relationships with the glycolytic pathway and the citric acid cycle. The
  figure was taken from Taylor and Coates [] with a few modifications. The numbers
  indicate the biosynthetic steps. DAP = diaminopimelic pathway, aKG = alpha-ketoglutarate,
  OOA = oxalacetic acid, PEP = phosphoenolpyruvate, PGA = phosphoglycerate, R-P3 =
  5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, Ru-5-P = ribulose-5-phosphate. The other abbreviations
  are standard.
