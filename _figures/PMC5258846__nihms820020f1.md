caption: a. Primary cilia on progenitor cells the mouse neuroepithelium at embryonic
  day 10.5 (E10.5) visualized by scanning electron microscopy.b. Primary cilium of
  cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast formed during Go/G1 of the cell cycle. Staining
  of acetylated α-tubulin (green) labels the axonemal microtubule, and γ-tubulin staining
  (red) labels the basal body. Nucleus is labeled by DAPI in blue. Scale bars = 5
  μm.c. Core Hedgehog components localize to the primary cilium. Hh ligand inhibits
  Patched localization to the cilium and promotes Smoothened accumulation in the ciliary
  membrane. GLI transcription factors, Suppressor of Fused (SUFU) and KIF7 are enriched
  in the cilia tip compartment upon Hh stimulation []. Dissociation of the GLI-SUFU
  complex is required for maximal activation of the Hh pathway [,]. Protein Kinase
  A (PKA) is required for phosphorylation and proteolytic processing to GLI to form
  transcriptional repressors [,]. PKA resides at the base of cilia in neuroepithelial
  cells [], but is found within the ciliary compartment in mIMCD3 cells and cholangiocytes
  [,]. The activity of PKA may be coupled to an orphan G-protein coupled receptor
  GPR161, which can increase intracellular cAMP when activated. Like PTCH1, GPR161
  localization to the ciliary membrane is negatively controlled by Hh ligand []. Correct
  localizations of membrane-bound cilia proteins depend on both active transport through
  IFT trains/BBSome and diffusion.
