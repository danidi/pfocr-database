caption: 'Delivery of CD4 T cell help for cytotoxic CD8 T cell alloimmunity. (A) For
  CD8 T cell responses against conventional protein antigen (such as viral antigen)
  following internalisation by the dendritic cell (DC), processed viral peptide is
  presented in the context of MHC class II and class I for CD4 and CD8 T cell recognition,
  respectively. CD4 T cell help is delivered to the DC, resulting in upregulation
  of co-stimulatory signals on the DC surface. This in turn results in enhanced presentation
  and more effective priming of the CD8 T cell response. (B) In transplantation, a
  similar three cell cluster model is achieved by donor DC presentation of intact
  MHC class II and class I to direct pathway CD4 and CD8 T cells. (C) Although animal
  models have shown that indirect pathway CD4 T cells can provide effective help for
  cytotoxic CD8 T cell alloresponses against intact MHC class I alloantigen, this
  theoretically involves a cumbersome four cell cluster with two unpaired couplets:
  recipient APC presenting to recipient indirect pathway CD4 T cell and donor DC presenting
  MHC class I alloantigen to direct pathway CD8 T cells; raising concerns regarding
  uncontrolled CD8 T cell alloresponses from bystander CD4 T cell activation. (D)
  These concerns are obviated if a recipient DC is able to re-present intact MHC class
  I alloantigen and processed MHC class I allopeptide simultaneously, enabling the
  provision of linked help from indirect pathway CD4 T cells to direct pathway CD8
  T cells.'
