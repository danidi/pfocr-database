caption: 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-cAMP response element binding (CREB)-miR-21-
  programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4) axis. In cystic kidney cells, elevation
  of phosphorylated CREB protein through activation of protein kinase A (PKA) has
  pleiotropic activities. The microRNA-21 (miR-21) gene is identified as a target
  of this protein, for which the binding site is within the proximal promoter, thus
  conferring the transcription of miR-21. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is
  known as a negative regulator of the PTEN/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, whereas PDCD4 is recognized to inactivate PI3K/Akt
  signaling to regulate cell growth. Class IA PI3Ks are heterodimeric enzymes containing
  a p110 catalytic and a p85 regulatory subunit, for which the free monomer variant,
  p85α, may act as a negative regulator of PI3K signaling so as to reduce PI3K/Akt
  activation. As an oncogenic miRNA, miR-21 has been demonstrated to target multiple
  genes in the mTOR pathway to induce cell growth in tumor cells, including PTEN,
  PDCD4, and p85α. However, in cystic kidney cells, only the role of PDCD4 in the
  mTOR pathway is revealed to date. RG-012 is a single-stranded chemically modified
  oligonucleotide that binds to and inhibits the function of miR-21 for the treatment
  of Alport syndrome. The finding that miR-21 inhibits apoptosis of cyst epithelial
  cells, likely through direct repression of its target gene PDCD4, makes the manipulation
  of miR-21 expression by miR-21 inhibitors such as RG-012 a possible therapeutic
  approach for polycystic kidney diseases. Abbreviations: ATP, adenosine triphosphate;
  TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex.'
