caption: 'The mercapturate pathway and associated side reactions. If the mercapturate
  precursor contains an electrophilic center it may react directly with GSH (reaction
  1). Alternatively, the precursor may be converted to a compound with an electrophilic
  center (reaction 2) prior to reaction with GSH. Reactions 1 through 5 represent
  the mercapturate pathway. Reactions 7 through 9 are alternative reactions for elimination
  of the cysteine S-conjugate. Reactions 7 plus 8 denote the thiomethyl shunt. Enzymes:
  1) glutathione S-transferases, 2) oxidases that generate an electrophilic center
  for attack by GSH (in some cases oxidation may be non-enzymatic); 3) ectoenzyme
  γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT); 4) ectoenzymes aminopeptidase N/cysteinylglycine dipeptidase
  and possibly cytosolic leucyl aminopeptidase; 5) N-acetyltransferases; 6) aminoacylases;
  7) cysteine S-conjugate β-lyases; 8) thiomethyltransferase; 9) UDP-glucuronosyltransferases.
  In vivo the hydrolysis reaction of GGT predominates over the formation of γ-glutamyl
  amino acids. Additional possible metabolic transformations (not shown) include a)
  further oxidation of the thiomethyl compound to sulfoxide, sulfone or CO2 and sulfate,
  which are excreted, b) conversion of some cysteine S-conjugates to the corresponding
  α-keto acid, α-hydroxy acid and oxidatively decarboxylated product, and c) conversion
  of the cysteine S-conjugate to the corresponding sulfoxide. Abbreviations: AdoHcy,
