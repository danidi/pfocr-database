caption: 'Complex transcriptional circuitry contributing toward secondary cell wall
  development in plants as influenced by abiotic stress. The secondary cell wall biosynthesis
  consists of two nodes: one is E2Fc-mediated and the other one is through the BR-signaling
  pathway. E2Fc is the master regulator of downstream transcription factors that act
  in a coordinated manner to further result in synthesis, transport, and assembly
  of secondary cell wall components such as cellulose, xylan, and lignin. Similarly,
  brassinosteroid signaling also modulates various downstream genes leading to cell
  wall remodeling under stress as follows: BSK1 (BR-SIGNALING KINASE); BSU1 (BRI1
  SUPPRESSOR1); BZR1 (BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1); CAD4 (CINNAMYL ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE
  4); CESA4/7 (CELLULOSE SYNTHASE 4/7); FLY1 (FLYING SAUCER 1); GSK2 (GSK3/SHAGGY-LIKE
  KINASES); GUX2 (UDP-GLUCURONATE: XYLAN α-GLUCURONOSYLTRANSFERASE 2); IRX7/9 (IROQUOIS
  HOMEOBOX 7); LAC4/17 (LACCASE 4/17); REV (REVOLUTA); SKP2A (S-PHASE KINASE-ASSOCIATED
  PROTEIN 2A); SND1/2/3 (STAPHYLOCOCCAL NUCLEASE AND TUDOR DOMAIN CONTAINING 1/2/3);
  VND 6/7 (VASCULAR-RELATED NAC DOMAIN 6/7); XTH (XYLOGLUCAN TRANSFERASE/HYDROLASE);
  EXP (EXPANSINS). In this complex process, various NACs (NAM-ATAF1,2-CUC2) and MYBs
  act as the key master switches that control cell wall deposition.'
