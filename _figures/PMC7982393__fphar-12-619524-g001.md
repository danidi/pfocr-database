caption: (A) Physiological and pathological functions of the RAS. Renin acts on angiotensinogen
  releasing angiotensin I (Ang I; Ang 1–10). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) transforms
  Ang I to angiotensin II (Ang II; Ang 1 –8). Ang II activates angiotensin II type
  1 (AT1) receptor causing systemic vasoconstriction, salt and water retention, hypertension,
  fibrosis, inflammation, remodeling and tissue damage. Ang II also acts on angiotensin
  II type 2 (AT2) receptor. The AT2 receptor mediates several beneficial effects;
  however, its expression is quite low in adults. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2
  (ACE2) converts Ang I to Ang (1 –9) and Ang II to Ang (1 –7). Ang (1 –9) is converted
  to Ang (1 –7) and Ang (1 –7) to Ang (1 –5) by ACE. Ang (1 –7) and Ang (1 –9) are
  also ligands of AT2 receptors. Ang (1 –7) stimulates the Mas receptor, counteracting
  the Ang II‐induced AT1‐mediated harmful effects. Activation of AT1 receptors exerts
  signal transduction mechanisms by ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways inducing downregulation
  of ACE2 expression. ACE2 has also non-catalytic function acting as a functional
  receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2. (B). Modulatory roles of ACEIs and ARBs on the RAS. ACEIs
  decrease the concentration of the main endogenous agonist of the AT1 receptor, Ang
  II; Ang (1 –8). Direct antagonism of the AT1 receptor (by ARBs) or reduction of
  the agonist (Ang II) concentration (by ACEIs) increases ACE2 expression with a marked
  reversal of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation signaling pathway. Since ACE is
  responsible for the degradation of Ang (1 –7) to Ang (1 –5), ACEIs also increase
  Ang (1 –7) and Ang (1 –9) plasma levels. These peptides are agonists at AT2 and
  Mas receptors and play an important role in counter-regulatory effects against AT1‐mediated
  deleterious changes. On the other hand, ACE2 overexpression by ACEIs or ARBs potentially
  promotes the uptake of SARS‐CoV‐2 into the cells.
