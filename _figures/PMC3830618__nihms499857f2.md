  Dashed arrows represent speculative or likely signaling connections, based primarily
  on indirect supporting evidence.Genetic (GluRIIA deletion) or pharmacological (PhTx)
  inhibition of glutamate receptor function initiates retrograde signaling processes
  (RS - green) that result in increased presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Postsynaptic
  CaMKII, Crossveinless-c (Cv-c), Dystrophin (Dys), and Importin 13 (Imp13) all oppose
  retrograde signaling-induced increases in presynaptic quantal content. Downstream
  of GluRIIA subunit receptor loss, postsynaptic Target of Rapamycin (TOR) appears
  to initiate a translation-dependent retrograde signaling process through S6 kinase
  activation (S6K). Based on genetic and electrophysiological data, some retrograde
  signaling may operate through Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway members Glass
  Bottom Boat (Gbb) and Wishful Thinking (Wit), or the Eph receptor tyrosine kinase
  (or other unknown processes).Presynaptic proteins such as Eph/Ephexin and kinesin
  Khc-73 may act to potentiate presynaptic active zone (black T-bar) activity by regulating
  the localization or function of active zone molecules, such as CaV2-type calcium
  channels and the ELKS/CAST homolog, Bruchpilot (Brp). In parallel, Rab3 Interacting
  Molecule (RIM) and Rab3-GAP may coordinately enhance the size of the readily releasable
  pool of presynaptic vesicles (RRP) and also work in conjunction with members of
  the BLOC-1 (Dysbindin, Snapin) and SNARE (SNAP25) complexes to enhance vesicle release
  through SNARE-mediated fusion events.In the presynaptic nucleus, overall neuronal
  excitability is shaped in part by reciprocal regulation of expression of the shal
  and Shaker potassium channel-encoding genes. Transcription factors Mad and Gooseberry
  (Gsb), as well as the Survival of Motor Neuron 1 (Smn) protein, confer competence
  upon the neuron to undergo homeostatic increases in synaptic release. Additionally,
  the miR-310 microRNA cluster negatively regulates expression of the Khc-73 gene.
