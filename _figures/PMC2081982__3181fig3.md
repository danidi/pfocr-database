caption: '(A) A model for the regulation of CEM neuron survival by the sex determination
  pathway and by ceh-30. In the wild-type hermaphrodite, TRA-1 is active and binds
  an intronic regulatory site of ceh-30, preventing ceh-30 transcription and thereby
  preventing CEM survival. In the wild-type male, TRA-1 is inactive; ceh-30 is therefore
  expressed and protects the CEM neurons from programmed cell death. In a ceh-30 gain-of-function
  hermaphrodite, TRA-1 is active but is unable to bind the mutated regulatory site,
  so ceh-30 is expressed and protects the CEMs. In a ceh-30 loss-of-function male,
  ceh-30 is expressed but is nonfunctional and unable to protect the CEM neurons from
  programmed cell death. (B) ceh-30 acts as a genetic switch for CEM neuron survival:
  If ceh-30 is active, CEMs live; if ceh-30 is inactive, CEMs die. Normally, ceh-30
  is active in males and inactive in hermaphrodites. (C) A representation of the sensitivity
  to programmed cell death controlled by ceh-30. In hermaphrodites, the CEM neurons
  express the killer gene egl-1, which promotes their deaths. In males, the CEM neurons
  have ceh-30 activity, which desensitizes these cells to programmed cell death by
  acting downstream from or in parallel to egl-1 and ced-9. Such a CEH-30-protected
  CEM neuron will live even when EGL-1 is expressed. (D) A model for the genetic pathway
  for the regulation of CEM neuron death by the determination of sexual identity.
