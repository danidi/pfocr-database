caption: The currently proposed cercosporin biosynthetic pathway. (a) The cercosporin
  toxin biosynthetic (CTB) gene cluster has been identified in C. nicotianae. (b)
  The proposed cercosporin biosynthesis hinges upon the formation of carboxylic acid
  5 by the NR-PKS CTB1. The direct product of CTB1 is nor-toralactone (6), precluding
  the proposed biosynthetic scheme.
