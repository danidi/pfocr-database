caption: Homeostatic role of IFNy pathway and IFNy-dependence of IL2 pathway in heathy
  men. In the APC analysis, in heathy men (Figure ) IFNγ level decreases with aging,
  however the IL-2 level seems to be a better candidate than IFNγ. The authors use
  their mathematical modeling to verify the IFNγ role as a gender-specific pathway,
  by excluding from the model IL2 and IFNy alternately. The graphs obtained from this
  APC analysis, clearly define the homeostatic role of IFNy and IFNy-dependence of
  IL2. Indeed, excluding IL2, reports from the network of cytokines are not affected,
  however the exclusion of IFNy completely reshapes these relationships.

papertitle: The discovery of how gender influences age immunological mechanisms in
  health and disease, and the identification of ageing gender-specific biomarkers,
  could lead to specifically tailored treatment and ultimately improve therapeutic
  success rates.
