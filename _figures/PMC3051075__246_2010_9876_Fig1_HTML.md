caption: The atypical BH3-only protein Bnip3 regulates cell death of cardiac myocytes
  through two separate pathways involving the mitochondria and promotes mitochondrial
  turnover via autophagy. In response to stress, Bnip3 activates the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway via Bax and Bak. Activation of Bax/Bak causes permeabilization of the outer
  mitochondrial membrane and release of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome
  c, leading to activation of caspases and cell death. Bnip3 also can induce opening
  of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), a nonselective channel
  permeable to molecules smaller than 1.5 kDa. Opening of the mPTP leads to swelling
  of the inner mitochondrial membrane and subsequent rupture of the outer membrane.
  Bnip3 also promotes mitochondrial turnover, in which Bnip3 targets mitochondria
  for removal by autophagosomes. Bnip3 is anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane
  via its C-terminal transmembrane domain, where it can interact with LC3/GAPARAP
  on the autophagosome, thereby anchoring the damaged mitochondrion to the autophagosome
