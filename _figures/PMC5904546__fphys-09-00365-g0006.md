caption: Proliferation of cardiomyocytes and fructolytic pathway are strongly affected
  in P7 hearts. (A) Hypoxia condition (3% O2) increases the cardiomyocyte proliferation
  rate. The cardiomyocytes were isolated from P1 hearts and kept in hypoxia chamber
  for 24 h. The number of proliferative cardiomyocytes stained by Ki-67 and MHC was
  counted. n = 10, respectively. Mann-Whitney U-test, *p < 0.05. 3407 (normoxia) and
  3,072 (hypoxia) cells / per group were counted, (B) The network overview of sugar
  metabolism with two functional modules depicting Fructose, mannose and galactose
  metabolism and Glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and Pyruvate metabolism. The downregulation
  of fructose in P7 hearts was observed in metabolomics experiments, marked by rectangular,
  (C) The representation of a fructose downregulation in P7 hearts. Box and whiskers
  plot, the median, lower 25% and upper 75% percentiles and minimum and maximum values
  are shown. Welch's Two-Sample t-test, **p < 0.01, *p < 0.05. Glucose levels are
  shown in comparison, (D) The overview of the fructolysis/glycolysis pathways with
  affected targets. The downregulated metabolites (Fructose, Fru; dihydroxyaceton
  phosphate, DHAP), enzymes (Phosphofructokinase-2, Pfkfb2; ketohexokinase isoform
  c, Khk-c; Aldolase a/c, Aldoa/c measured in MSE experiments) and transporters (Glut1/Slc2a1;
  Mct4/Slc16a3) are indicated with an arrow. Lac, lactate; Pyruvate (Pyr), Mct4, monocarboxylate
  transporter, LDH, lactate dehydrogenase, (E) The downregulation of Glut1, Mct4,
  Khk-c and Pfkfb2 at the mRNA level was assessed by q-PCR, by comparing the RNA abundance
  from tissue samples derived from P1 and P7 hearts. Ct values were normalized to
  the level of a housekeeping gene 18S in each measurement, n = 10. Mann-Whitney U-test,
  ***p < 0.001.
