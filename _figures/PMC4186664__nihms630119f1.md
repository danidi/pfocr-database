caption: Metabolic pathway for vitamin D3synthesis in mammals. Cholecalciferol (D3),
  its precursor (Pre-D3), and its downstream metabolites are shown within boxes. Enzymes
  that regulate each step are noted, and feedback regulation is indicated by the curved
  arrows [see references (–) for details].
