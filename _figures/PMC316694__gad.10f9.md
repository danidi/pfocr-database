caption: A pathway for cytoskeletal polarization mediated by Cdc42p in yeast. Cell
  cycle progression or extracellular signals lead to the conversion of GDP to GTP
  on Cdc42p, possibly by activation of the exchange factor Cdc24p. GTP–Cdc42p then
  binds and thereby localizes the effectors Gic1p and Gic2p to sites of polarized
  growth, which in turn contribute to polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. Cdc42p
  might exert some of its effects on the cytoskeleton not only through Gic1p and Gic2p
  but also through other targets including Bni1p, Ste20p, and Cla4p. Bni1p is known
  to interact also with other members of the Rho-GTPase family.
