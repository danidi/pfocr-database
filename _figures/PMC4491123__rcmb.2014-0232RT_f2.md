caption: The function and targets of miRNAs in different cell types of developing
  mouse lungs. (A) miR-34/449 promotes ciliogenesis by targeting Notch1, δ-like 1
  (Dll1), and centriolar coiled coil protein 110 (Cp110). (B) Highly expressed in
  epithelium of early developing lungs, miR-17 and miR-302/367 promote proliferation
  by suppressing retinoblastoma-like (Rbl) 2 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor
  1A (Cdkn1a); miR-302/267 also regulates cell polarity by targeting T-cell lymphoma
  invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase
  1b, regulatory subunit 1 (Lis1 or Pafah1b1). (C) Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) up-regulates
  expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) and Notch3 by suppressing
  miR-206, resulting in increased smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and innervation;
  miR-145/143 promotes SMC differentiation by down-regulating Klf4 and many other
  genes associated with synthetic phenotype. (D) miR-142-3p and miR-326 regulate mesenchymal
  cell proliferation and differentiation by modulating wingless-type MMTV integration
  site family and Shh pathways, respectively.
