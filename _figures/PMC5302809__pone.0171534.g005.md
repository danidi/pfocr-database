caption: (a) Structural gene cluster of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway. (b) The
  biosynthetic pathways were constructed based on the KEGG database, NCBI genome annotation,
  and the RAST server. Black shaded arrows indicate known pathway steps for which
  related genes were not detected in the RSC-14 genome. Red arrows indicate putative
  enzymes that are encoded by the genome. The enzymes that were identified in the
  RSC-14 genome are shown with their NCBI locus tag.
