caption: 'Role of CCR9+ DCs in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune cell function
  in the intestine during homeostasis: (i) CCL25-CCR9 interaction on DCs increase
  the production of TSLP and expression of FasL and LAP, which promotes Treg differentiation,
  which induces tolerance and maintains intestinal homeostasis. (ii) CCR9+ DCs inhibit
  Th17 differentiation by an unknown mechanism, which prevents intestinal inflammation.
  (iii) CCR9+ DCs might regulate the ILC3 function by regulating IL-22 production
  by secreting IL-23 cytokine. IL-22 augments the production of AMP and helps in maintaining
  epithelial cell integrity and preventing colitis. (iv) ILC3 may acquire antigens
  from CCR9+ DCs and eliminate commensal-reactive CD4+ T cells by activating the apoptotic
  pathway, which prevents the expansion of pathogenic Th17 cells and maintains intestinal
  homeostasis. (v) CCR9+ DCs may regulate IgA+ B cell class switching by activating
  the TGF-β pathway or increasing expression of BAFF or APRIL and generate high-affinity
  IgA antibodies, which control commensal and pathogenic bacteria growth. TSLP provides
  an autocrine effect on DCs and increases expression of BAFF or APRIL, which help
  in IgA class switching. (vi) CCR9+ DCs may inhibit IgE class switching by an unknown
  mechanism. DC, Dendritic cell; Treg, T regulatory cells; TSLP, thymic stromal lymphopoietin;
  LAP, latency-associated peptide; ILCs, innate lymphoid cells; AMP, antimicrobial
  peptide; BAFF, B-cell activating factor; APRIL, A proliferation-inducing ligand.'
