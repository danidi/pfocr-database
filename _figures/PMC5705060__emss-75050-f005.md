caption: mTORC1 is a large multiprotein complex containing mTOR and Raptor, which
  phosphorylates and activates S6 kinase-1, an activator of protein synthesis, and
  phosphorylates and inactivates initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1),
  an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Binding of the active GTP-bound form of the small
  G protein Rheb recruits mTORC1 to the lysosome, where it is activated. Growth factors
  activate the protein kinase B/Akt pathway and the Erk pathway, and both of those
  protein kinases phosphorylate the TSC2 component of the TSC1:TSC2 complex, inhibiting
  its Rheb-GAP activity and thus activating mTORC1. PKB/Akt also phosphorylates PRAS40,
  relieving its inhibitory effect on mTORC1. On the other hand AMPK, activated in
  response to energy stress, phosphorylates TSC2, enhancing its Rheb-GAP activity,
  as well as Raptor, with both effects inhibiting mTORC1.
