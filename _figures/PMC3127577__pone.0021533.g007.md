caption: β-lap induces mitochondrial apoptotic cell death in a NQO1-dependent manner.
  The induction of ER stress by β-lap is substantially required for JNK activation
  which triggers mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway. In detail, JNK activation
  induces cleavage of Bax and mitochondrial translocation of cleaved Bax, which causes
  disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, and subsequent nuclear translocation
  of AIF and Endo G. Understanding these signaling pathways that we elucidated in
  this study may provide useful insights into improvement in therapeutic efficacy
  of the design of NQO1-targeted cancer therapies.
