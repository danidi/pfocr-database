caption: 'Mutated NMP attenuates an oncosuppressor pathway and enhances an oncogenic
  one. Normal cell: NPM is mainly localized in the nucleolus and is required for nucleolar
  accumulation and stability of FBW7γ and ARF. This is relevant for the control of
  MYC turnover and provides an active pool of ARF ready to inactivate the HDM2-mediated
  p53 degradation in response to cellular stress. AML blast: NPM-mut is mainly localized
  to the cytoplasm and causes cytoplasmic delocalization and degradation of ARF and
  FBW7γ. As a consequence, HDM2 can induce ubiquitination/degradation of p53, and
  MYC accumulates and activates its target genes.'
