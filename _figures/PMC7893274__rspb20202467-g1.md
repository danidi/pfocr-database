caption: A neurosteroid pathway for the phenotypic effects of maternal steroids. (a)
  Many maternal steroids are converted into neurosteroid metabolites that do not bind
  with classical receptors. (b) However, these neurosteroid metabolites can bind with
  neurotransmitter receptors and microtubule-associated proteins and modulate their
  activity. (c) Variation in the activity of developing neural circuits can, for example,
  (i) alter neuron outgrowth, (ii) influence the response of growing neurites to chemical
  guidance cues, and (iii) promote or inhibit axon branching depending on the developmental
  stage. Modulation of these key neural processes via maternally derived neurosteroids
  may underlie effects of maternal steroids on long-term variation in behaviour by
  shaping the size or connectivity of neural circuits in different brain regions.
