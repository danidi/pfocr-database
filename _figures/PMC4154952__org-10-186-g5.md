caption: Figure 5. Network analysis of stress-shielded wounds. Top scoring Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA)-constructed transcriptome network based on genes that were
  significantly downregulated in stress-shielded wounds compared with natural stress
  wounds, corresponding to the IPA gene expression network whose top functions consist
  of “Connective Tissue Disorders” and “Inflammatory Disease.” Direct relationships
  are indicated by solid lines (blue), and dashed lines (gray) represent indirect
  relationships.
