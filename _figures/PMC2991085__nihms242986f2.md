caption: Signaling through the Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant response pathway is shown in
  a simplified manner. In basal conditions, Nrf2 is targeted by Keap1 for Cullin3-mediated
  polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Phase 2 genes are mostly inactive
  and Antioxidant Response Elements (AREs) in their enhancers are largely bound by
  small Maf dimers or other repressive factors like Bach1. Oxidants, electrophiles,
  cancer chemopreventive agents, and other “inducers” impair Nrf2 degradation and
  facilitate the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. The activation of Nrf2 is further promoted
  by positive pathway modulators like DJ-1, p62, and prohibitin. As a result, antioxidant
  response genes are transcriptionally induced in a coordinated manner through Nrf2-small
  Maf dimers bound to their AREs, the redox balance is restored, and oxidative damage
  is minimized. Chronic oxidative stress associated with aging or degenerative diseases
  handicaps the expression or function (↓) of critical Nrf2 pathway modulators, or
  increases the abundance (↑) of negative regulators like Keap1 and Bach1. Nrf2 proteolysis
  is increased, while several other steps (*) of the pathway are reduced. As a result,
  Nrf2 activity is compromised despite the presence of oxidative conditions. Nrf2-stimulating
  compounds, like sulforaphane and lipoic acid, induce Nrf2 activity and restore the
  Cnc antioxidant response.
