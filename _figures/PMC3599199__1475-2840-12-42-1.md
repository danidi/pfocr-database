caption: Glucose and fatty acid metabolism in the cardiomyocyte. Glucose uptake into
  the cell occurs through the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4. Once inside, glucose
  is broken down into pyruvate by glycolysis. Pyruvate is subsequently transported
  into the mitochondria and decarboxylated to acetyl-CoA. Non-esterified fatty acids
  are taken up through fatty acid transporter (FAT)/CD36, fatty acid transport protein
  (FATP) and plasma membrane fatty acid binding protein (FABPpm). Intracellular fatty
  acids form fatty acyl-CoA and can either be esterified into triglycerides (TG) or
  enter the mitochondria via carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT-1). Fatty acyl-CoA
  enters the β-oxidation pathway, forming acetyl-CoA. Glucose or fatty acid-derived
  acetyl-CoA enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle with entry of reducing equivalents
  to the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation, and finally ATP is
  formed.
