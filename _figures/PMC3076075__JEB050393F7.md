caption: Model for insulin-like protein (ILP) action on behavioral physiology of honey
  bees. Brain and fat body signaling are illustrated for (A) a high nutrition and
  (B) a low nutrition phenotype. Levels of nutrient stores are indicated by the size
  of the trophocytes (t; irregular orange shapes) and oenocytes (o; light yellow ovals)
  that make up the fat body. We hypothesize that ilp1 (filled circles) acts as an
  agonist of the honey bee insulin receptors (InR, red indicators) whereas ilp2 (small
  open triangles) is an antagonist of the InR. Nutritional status, of which Vg is
  one component, influences the interplay between ilp1 and ilp2 action. During periods
  of high nutritional status (A), such as nursing, when honey bees have large nutrient
  stores and high titers of Vg, the fat body is less sensitive to ILP action as InR
  expression is low, leading to less InR incorporated in cell membranes. The high
  ilp2 expression in the fat body acts remotely to reduce transduction (phosphorylation
  of InR, encircled ‘P’) of the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway in the
  brain, a tissue with relatively constant InR expression. IIS transduction suppresses
  synthesis of JH, a downstream target of IIS. When honey bees have depleted nutrient
  stores and low Vg titers (foragers, B), fat body InR expression is high, suggesting
  that increased sensitivity to IIS in that tissue accompanies increased metabolic
  needs. Increased ilp1 expression in the brain increases IIS transduction and acts
  remotely to mobilize stored nutrient reserves in the fat body. These changes meet
  energetic demands and may ‘lock’ individuals into the foraging behavioral state
  by further depleting nutrient stores and suppressing Vg synthesis.
