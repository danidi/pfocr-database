caption: Glucosinolates in Barbarea vulgaris leaves as detected in this investigation,
  with suggested biosynthetic relationships. 1, 2-phenylethyl GSL (gluconasturtiin);
  2R, (2R)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl GSL (epiglucobarbarin); 2S, (2S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylethyl
  GSL (glucobarbarin); 3R, (2R)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl GSL (4-hydroxyepiglucobarbarin);
  4, 3-indolylmethyl GSL (glucobrassicin); 5, 4-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl GSL (4-methoxyglucobrassicin);
  6, N-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl GSL (neoglucobrassicin). GSL, glucosinolate; RHO, R-hydroxylation;
  SHO, S-hydroxylation, PHO, para-hydroxylation. In all structures except the upper
  complete structure, the constant glucosinolate backbone is indicated GSL.
