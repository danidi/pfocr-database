caption: A hypothetical outline of chemokine signaling cascade relayed by the urotensinergic
  system inducing cell migration. Illustration of a pathophysiological situation involving
  directional migration/invasion of cells expressing UT in response to a urotensin
  II (UII) gradient concentration. It is proposed that mobile high-affinity UT coupled
  to both Gαi/o and Gα13 is activated by a low concentration of UII, would promote
  the formation of protrusions and adhesions at the front of the cell through PI3K/PIP3/GEF/Rac/Cdc42
  signaling cascade. At the back of the migrating cell, concomitant activation of
  G13, likely allows actomyosin contraction via the Rho/ROCK/MLCK pathway. To favor
  cell progression toward the emission source of UII, mobile or engaged UT coupled
  to Gi/o in lipid rafts may activate proteins responsible for the formation and maturation
  of focal adhesions composed of αv integrins and vinculin. Together, this pleiotropic
  UT associated signaling events represents a prototypic chemokine-mediated mechanism
  shared by P2.58 GPCRs allowing chemotactic migration. Cdc42, cell division control
  protein 42; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; MAP1A, microtubule-associated
  protein 1A; MLCK, myosin light-chain kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase;
  PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-trisphosphate; ROCK, rho-associated protein kinase
  [from Ref. ()].
