caption: Activation of the IRS signaling cascade pathways. A peptide ligand such as
  insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) binds to its receptor, activating
  the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of that receptor that then tyrosine phosphorylates
  (pY) adaptor molecules such as IRS-1 or -2. Other receptor tyrosine kinases, or
  receptors that activate tyrosine kinases such as Janus kinase (JAK), can also activate
  IRS signaling. This leads to activation of two major signaling cascades, the Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (orange) and the phosphatidylinositol-3′-kinase (PI3’K)/protein
  kinase-B (PKB; also known as Akt) signaling pathway (green). For the Ras-Raf-MAPK
  pathway, growth factor receptor–bound protein-2 (Grb2)/son of sevenless (SOS) protein
  complex binds to specific phosphorylated tyrosines on IRS-1/2, activating the GTP/GDP
  exchange activity of SOS, which loads p21Ras (Ras) with GTP to activate Ras, leading
  to phosphorylation of the serine/threonine protein kinase Raf-1, which then phosphorylates
  the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1), which is then activated to phosphorylate
  the extracellular signal–regulated kinases-1 and -2 (Erk-1/2). Phospho-activated
  Erk-1/2 can then directly (or indirectly via phospho-activation of other kinases
  such as p90 ribosomal serine kinase [p90RSK]) serine/threonine phosphorylate certain
  transcription factors, such as cFos and E-twenty-six–like transcription factor 1
  (Elk-1), to upregulate gene transcription. Phospho-activated Erk-1/2 can also phosphorylate
  MAPK–interacting kinase (Mnk) 1 and 2, leading to phosphorylation activation of
  the eukaryotic initiation factor-4e (eIF4e) in a complex also containing eIF4a and
  eIF4G to increase general protein synthesis at the level initiation phase of translational
  control. For the PI3’K/PKB signaling pathway, the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3’K
  docks to other specific phosphorylated tyrosine sites on IRS-1/2 that then activates
  its p110 catalytic activity. This catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,
  5-bisphophaste [PI(4,5)P2] to phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-trisphophaste [PI(3,4,5)P3],
  which then activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). PDK1
  then threonine (pT) phosphorylates PKB for PKB activation, which can be amplified
  by serine phosphorylation (pS) of PKB by the target of rapamycin complex-2 (TORC2;
  which includes the protein kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] and associated
  proteins rictor and mLST8). PKB has a plethora of serine/threonine phosphorylation
  substrates. PKB-mediated phosphorylation of the tuberous sclerosis protein-1/2 complex
  (TSC1/2) inhibits its GTPase activating protein activity to then load the Ras homolog
  enriched in brain (Rheb) protein with GTP (RhebGTP), leading to activation of the
  TORC1 (which includes mTOR and associated proteins raptor and mLST8). TORC1 can
  then serine/threonine phosphorylate a series of substrates. This includes the eIF4e-binding
  protein-1 (4e-BP1) that releases it from eIF4e binding, enabling eIF4e to associate
  with eIF4a and eIF4G in a complex with Mnk, where Mnk then phosphorylates eIF4e
  to increase rates of protein synthesis translation. This also shows how the Ras/Raf/Erk
  and PI3’K/PKB signaling pathways can coordinate to give a tight translational control
  of protein synthesis. TORC1 can also phosphorylate and subsequently activate p70
  S6-ribosomal kinase (p70S6K), which can lead to an increase in the elongation phase
  of protein synthesis translation. PDK1 can threonine phosphorylate p70S6K to amplify
  this effect. TORC1 also phosphorylates Unc-51–like kinases-1/2 (ULK-1/2; also known
  as autophagy gene-1), which results in inhibition of autophagy. Among PKB’s other
  phosphorylation substrates are proteins involved in the apoptotic process such as
  Bcl-antagonist of cell death (BAD) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP),
  outlining a mechanism whereby PKB is antiapoptotic. PKB phosphorylation of the transcription
  factors FoxO1 and FoxO3a causes their removal from the nucleus and promotes their
  degradation, causing an inhibition of FoxO1/3a-mediated transcription. Phosphorylation
  of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) by PKB inhibits GSK3 activity, resulting in
  increased glycogen deposition and cell growth. Under certain circumstances, PKB
  can also influence increases in cell growth by phosphorylating the cell-cycle inhibitor
  proteins p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1 (p21CIP) and p27 cyclin-dependent-kinase
  inhibitor (p27KIP). PKB can also phosphorylate-inhibit phosphodiesterase-3b (PDE3b)
  to elevate intracellular cAMP ([cAMP]i) levels. Many of these IRS signaling elements
  have been shown to be expressed and active and play important roles in pancreatic
  β-cells in terms of certain functions, growth, and survival (rev. in –), and these
  are indicated by a yellow highlighted halo.
