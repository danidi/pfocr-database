caption: A dual negative regulation model of HIF-1α/VEGF-A pathway by miR-199a. Under
  hypoxia conditions, HIF-1α accumulation in ESCs leads to increased VEGF-A production,
  which promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion and tube formation of endothelial
  cells. However, when miR-199a was transfected into ESCs, it could down-regulate
  its target genes, including HIF-1α and VEGF-A, thereby suppressing the positive
  signaling and attenuating the angiogenic potential of ESCs.
