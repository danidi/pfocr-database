caption: Paramyxovirus inhibition of IFN signaling pathways. IFN binding to the extracellular
  domain of the plasma-membrane-localized IFN receptor complex results in phosphorylation
  of intracellular STAT1 and STAT2 by the Tyk2/Jak1 kinase and hetero-dimerization.
  Following association with IRF-9, the complex is translocated to the nucleus to
  activate transcription of ISGs containing an interferon-stimulated response element
  (ISRE). Steps and targets in the signaling pathway that are blocked by select paramyxovirus
  proteins are indicated by dual red lightning bolts.
