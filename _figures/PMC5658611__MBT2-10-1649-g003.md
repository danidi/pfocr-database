caption: 'Flux partitioning around the valine metabolism at 2 mg l−1 phytosterols
  and three different levels of assimilable nitrogen.The distribution of fluxes around
  these metabolic routes was investigated using isotopic filiation experiments with
  13C‐labelled valine. Portion of consumed valine recovered in proteinogenic leucine
  and valine: the labelled fraction (light colour) corresponds to the consumed valine
  directly incorporated into proteins, while the unlabelled fraction (dark colour)
  represents the proteinogenic amino acids de novo synthetized from CCM precursors.
  Portion of the valine consumed converted into volatile compounds: the labelled fraction
  (light colour) corresponds to the fraction of volatile compounds synthetized using
  carbon from consumed valine, while the unlabelled fraction (dark colour) represents
  the portion of volatile molecules synthetized from α‐ketoacids through the CCM.
  Flux partitioning involved in the use of valine during fermentation: the fraction
  of consumed valine catabolized through a certain pathway was assessed from the molar
  ratios between the amount of a proteinogenic amino acid or volatile compound labelled
  and the total amount of consumed amino acid. Isotopic enrichments (defined as the
  molar ratio between the quantity of labelled compound and the total quantity) are
  shown above each bar plot. The raw data and details of the calculations are provided
  in the Supplemental Material. Blue: SM70; orange: SM250; pink: SM425.'
