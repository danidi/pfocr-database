caption: Graph representation of the Signaling by NOTCH2 pathway as extracted from
  the Reactome database. Participating proteins are displayed as large dark red dots
  labeled with their canonical gene name. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are
  indicated with suffixes in the label. A connection between two dots indicates a
  documented interaction between the two proteins in the given pathway. Connections
  belonging to the subpathways NOTCH2 intracellular domain regulate transcription
  and NOTCH2 activation and transmission of signal to the nucleus are displayed in
  orange and yellow, respectively. The interactions involving these proteins in other
  pathways are displayed with light gray connections in the background.
