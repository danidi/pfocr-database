caption: Glutamine metabolism and macrophage polarization. In M1 macrophages, succinate
  accumulates due to glutamine-dependent anerplerosis and the GABA shunt. Succinate
  stabilizes HIF-1α through inhibiting the enzymatic activities of PHD or ROS, resulting
  in specific regulation of expression of IL-1β and other HIF-1α–dependent genes,
  including enzymes required for glycolysis. In M2 macrophages, α-ketoglutarate generated
  from glutaminolysis is essential for OXPHOS and FAO and promotes an M2 phenotype
  through Jmjd3 (a key enzyme for demethylation of H3K27)-dependent demethylation
  of H3K27 on the promoters of M2-specific marker genes, as well as inhibition of
  the activation of IKK through PHD, which inhibits the activation of IKKβ through
  hydroxylation of IKKβ on P191. Glutamine also supports M2 macrophage polarization
  through the glutamine–UDP-GlcNAc pathway. Also, M2 macrophages have a potential
  isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate conversion breakpoint in the metabolic flow of the
  TCA cycle. Pathways in black are enhanced in M1 macrophages, the pathways in blue
  are impaired, and pathways in red enhance differentiation of M2 macrophages. ABAT,
