caption: Metabolic crosstalk in light acclimation and defence signalling. Shikimate
  pathway and sulfur assimilation are redox activated at 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate
  7-phosphate synthase (DAHP synthase), chorismate synthase (CS) and APS reductase
  (APR) upon photosynthetic electron transport in light. The shikimate pathway provides
  precursors for SA and aromatic amino acids, of which tryptophan is used for biosynthesis
  of indolic glucosinolates (GLS). Rate-limiting steps in these branches include isochorismate
  synthase (ICS) for SA and anthranilate synthase (AS) for tryptophan. Biosynthesis
  and sulfonylation of GLS requires glutathione (GSH) and the sulfur donor 5′-phosphosulphate
  (PAPS). The reaction product phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP) is a retrograde
  signalling molecule in high light stress. Level of PAP is controlled by the chloroplastic
  phosphatase SAL1 and the PAPS transporter (PAPST). Degradation products of the indolic
  GLS act in parallel with SA signalling to promote callose deposition to the cell
  wall. APS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulphate; ATPS, ATP sulphurylase; APK, APS kinase;
  APS, adenosine phosphosulphate; Ind, indole; Glc, glucose.
