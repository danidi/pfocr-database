caption: Proposed mechanism by which PKCα regulates Ca2+ sparklet activity in arterial
  myocytes. Binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors activates heterotrimeric Gq/11-proteins.
  Activation of Gq/11 increases phospholipase C (PLC) activity and diacylglycerol
  (DAG) production, which, in turn, activates protein kinase Cα (PKCα). Gq/11 activity
  can negatively regulated by regulators of G-protein signalling (RGS) 2. Protein
  kinase Cα, and presumably calcineurin, are targeted to specific regions of the sarcolemma.
  Those sites in which L-type Ca2+ channels (LTCC) are associated with the PKCα/calcineurin
  complex can develop persistent Ca2 sparklet activity. Interestingly, LTCC agonists,
  such as Bay-K 8644, and activators of the PKCα signalling pathway could increase
  Ca2 influx by promoting additional clusters of LTCC to operate in persistent Ca2+
  influx mode and by increasing the probability of solitary LTCC. PP2B, protein phosphatese
  2B.
