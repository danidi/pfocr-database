caption: Schematic representation of macrophage-derived exosomal miR-501-3p in PDAC
  and the involvement of TGFBR3-mediated TGF-β signaling pathway. M2 macrophages deliver
  miR-501-3p through exosomes in PDAC cells, thereby down-regulating TGFBR3 expression,
  and ultimately accelerate the development of PDAC via the TGF-β signaling pathway,
  corresponding to enhanced PDAC cell invasion and migration
