caption: The expression (i.e., functional) states for two different environments,
  as generated by extreme pathway analysis of R*, are presented.(A) The expression
  states for the environment in which Metabolite a is absent but all other metabolites
  are present are shown. This environment yields 27 extreme pathways, the least of
  all possible environments, leading to the activation or inactivation of the genes
  within the TRS.(B) The expression states for the environment in which Metabolite
  e and Metabolite f are absent but all other metabolites are present are shown. This
  environment yields 75 extreme pathways, the most of all possible environments, leading
  to the activation or inactivation of the genes within the TRS. A legend for these
  drawings is described in the caption for .
