caption: 'a Prenylation and processing of RAS proteins. The three Ras genes, K-Ras,
  H-Ras and N-Ras encode 188–190 amino acids and share 82% - 90% overall sequence
  identity. These proteins undergo farnesylation at the thiol group of cysteine moiety
  of CAAX motif. This is followed by cleavage of terminal tripeptide by endopeptidase,
  methylation and palmitoylation of terminal exposed cysteine residue before membrane
  localization. b Activation cycle of RAS GTP-GDP. Conformation of RAS proteins at
  30–38 amino acid region [Switch I (SI)] and at 60–76 amino acid region [Switch II
  (SII)] changes during GDP-GTP cycling. GTP hydrolysis is facilitated by RASGAPs
  while guanine nucleotide exchange activities are stimulated by GNEFs. Binding of
  ligand to the receptor activates GNEFs, destabilizes nucleotide binding and releases
  nucleotide. At or above ten-fold higher concentration of GTP in cell cytoplasm,
  GNEFs facilitate transient formation of RAS-GTP. This is followed by the increased
  intrinsic GTPase activity of RAS (stimulated by GAPs). As a result RAS-GTP is converted
  into inactive GDP bound form. Mutations in Ras gene impair GAPs stimulated GTP hydrolysis
  and allow RAS to persist in GTP bound form. GTP: Guanosine triphosphate; GDP: Guanosine
  diphosphate; GAPs: GTPase-activating proteins; GNEFs: Guanine nucleotide exchange
