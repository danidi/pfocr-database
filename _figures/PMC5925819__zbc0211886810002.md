caption: CDP-DAG and Kennedy pathways. The CDP-DAG pathway begins with the consumption
  of phosphatidate (PA) on the cytosolic leaflet of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  by either CDP-DAG synthase (CDS) 1 or 2 to produce cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol
  (CDP-DAG). The CDP-DAG is then used as a substrate by the phosphatidylinositol synthase
  enzyme (PIS) to catalyze the production of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) from CDP-DAG.
  CDP-DAG is also used in the mitochondria by the phosphatidylglycerophosphate synthase
  (PGPS) to produce phosphatidylglycerol (PtdGly)-phosphate, which is, in turn, dephosphorylated
  to produce PtdGly. Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) synthesis is catalyzed by PtdSer
  synthase 1 (PSS1). A significant fraction of the newly synthesized PtdSer is transported
  from the ER to the mitochondria. There it serves as a substrate for the enzyme PtdSer
  decarboxylase (PSD) to produce a mitochondrial pool of phosphatidylethanolamine
  (PtdEtn). In the Kennedy pathway, choline (Cho) and ethanolamine (Etn) are first
  activated for phosphorylation by choline kinase (CK) and ethanolamine kinase (ETNK),
  respectively. Next, the phosphobase serves as substrates for the rate-limiting step
  of the pathway catalyzed by CTP:phosphocholine cytidyltransferase (CCT) and CTP:phosphoethanolamine
  cytidyltransferase (ECT), respectively, yielding CDP-Cho and CDP-Etn. The final
  step of the pathway is catalyzed by two homologous proteins, the phosphatidylcholine
  (PtdCho)-specific CPT and the PtdCho/PtdEtn producing CEPT. Finally, PtdEtn can
  be converted to PtdCho by three successive methylation reactions catalyzed by PtdEtn
  methyltransferases, PEMT1 and -2, in the liver of mammals. PAP, phosphatidate phosphatase.
