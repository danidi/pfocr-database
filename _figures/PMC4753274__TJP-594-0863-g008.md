caption: A general schematic representation of epigenetic modifications that are crucial
  for NA‐induced enhancement of LTP maintenance. β‐Adrenergic receptor activation
  by NA, along with depolarization‐triggered activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors,
  promote epigenetic modifications in the nucleus. These include DNA methylation by
  DNA methyltransferases, histone H3 acetylation by histone acetyltransferases such
  as CBP/p300 (not shown) and histone H3 phosphorylation. The latter was mediated
  by Aurora kinase‐B (not shown), but other histone kinases may also be involved.
  The cytosolic signalling cascades that link β‐adrenergic receptors to the nucleus
  are not clearly defined. They may include the ERK/MSK pathway. Plasticity‐related
  proteins would ultimately be synthesized in the cytosol following epigenetic modification
  of transcriptional activity. The mRNAs that are produced, as well as the proteins
  that contribute to boosting maintenance of LTP, remain to be identified.
