caption: A decrease in GM3 levels or glycolipid accumulation, as a result of the reaction
  catalysed by highly expressed NEU3, promotes cell adhesion to laminins, integrin-mediated
  signalling to ERK and subsequent activation of cell proliferation, but attenuates
  adhesion to fibronectin and its related signalling pathway. On laminins, including
  laminin-1, laminin-10/11 and laminin-5, stimulation of cell adhesion and proliferation
  could be mediated by integrins α6β1 and α3β1 via increased integrin β1 phosphorylation,
  whereas suppression of integrin α5β1-mediated signalling would occur on fibronectin.
  Furthermore, in the absence or presence of NEU3 product(s), the NEU3 molecule itself
  could interact with integrin α6β4 and promote Shc phosphorylation and recruitment
  of Grb2 through integrin β4 phosphorylation.
