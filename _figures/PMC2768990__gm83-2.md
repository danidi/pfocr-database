caption: BANs of differentially expressed genes in common between cell lines. The
  lists of common genes between both colon cancer cell lines, between both breast
  cancer cell lines, and among the other three cell lines studied (representative
  of pancreatic cancer, leukemia and osteosarcoma) were used to construct BANs with
  the Pathway Architect software. Expanded networks were constructed for each list
  - (a) colon cancer, (b) breast cancer and (c) the other three cell lines - by setting
  an advanced filter that included the categories of binding, expression, metabolism,
  promoter binding, protein modification and regulation (see legend). Only proteins
  are represented. Overlapping of the expression levels was also performed (red for
  overexpressed genes and green for underexpressed genes; translucent shading represents
  genes that were not in the list and were added by the program from the interactions
  database). The BANs show some node genes that were studied further (those with arrows
  pointing to them).
