caption: Schematic representation of molecular mechanisms that connect cellular junctions
  to the Hippo pathway. (A) Effect of tight junctions in Drosophila. Crumbs (Crb)
  and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) polarity complexes promote Hippo signaling
  through Mer, Ex, and kidney and brain expressed protein (KIBRA), while the Fat-Dachs
  branch blocks the Warts (Wts) kinase. (B) Effect of tight junctions in mammals.
  The Crb complex acts through Angiomotin (AMOT), which suppresses Yes-associated
  protein (YAP) activity by direct binding and activates LATS2 by recruitment. AIP4
  inhibits YAP by ubiquitination and stabilizes AMOT. F-actin competes for AMOT binding
  therefore inducing YAP activity. Zonula Occludens (ZO)-2 binds to YAP and sequesters
  it in the cytoplasm. (C) Effect of adherens junctions in Drosophila. E-cad-α-cat-β-cat
  complex, Echinoid (Ed), and Pez promotes Hippo signaling activity while Ajuba (Jub)
  and Zyxin (Zyx) inhibit it. (D) Effect of adherens junctions in mammals. The E-cad-α-cat-β-cat
  complex and PTPN14 promote Hippo signaling activity while the Ajuba protein LIMD1
  inhibits the activity of LATS1/2 kinases. Also, α-cat and PTPN14 inhibit YAP by
  direct binding and sequestering it in the cytoplasm.
