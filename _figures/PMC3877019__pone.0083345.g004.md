caption: This is one of the canonical pathways that contained statistically significantly
  more genes than expected by chance in the group of genes that are highly expressed
  in the mouse CPE. Gray fields indicate their presence in the “Mouse High CPE expression
  sub-dataset (>90th P)”; uncolored genes are added by the Ingenuity software to show
  the entire standard pathway. Solid lines between molecules indicate direct physical
  relationships between molecules (such as regulating and interacting protein domains).
  Abbreviations of gene names are according to standard abbreviations used in GenBank.
  As shown, the majority of genes of this pathway are highly expressed in the mouse
  CPE.
