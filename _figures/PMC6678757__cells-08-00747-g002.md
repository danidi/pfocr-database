caption: 'Immunosuppressive role of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs promote
  immunosuppression by different mechanisms: TAMs can express programmed cell death
  ligand 1 and ligand 2 (PD-L1 and PD-L2), which bind the T cell inhibitory receptor
  programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), thereby inducing T cell exhaustion. TAM
  expression of V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA) and B7 family
  molecules, such as B7-H4, can have similar function. TAMs secrete immunosuppressive
  cytokines such as IL-10 and TGFβ, which can have direct suppressive functions on
  CD8+ T cells, or they can induce recruitment of immunosuppressive CD4+ T regulatory
  (Treg) cells. TAM secreted IL-10 can impair T cells effector functions indirectly
  either by inhibit dendritic cell (DC) anti-tumorigenic role or by inducing DC expression
  of PD-L1. Moreover, amino acid metabolism in TAM results in production of arginase
  and immunosuppressive metabolites via the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway,
  which is responsible of metabolic starvation in T cells. TAMs can also indirectly
  induce immunosuppression by promoting fibrosis. Indeed cancer associated fibroblast
  (CAF) secreted factors and/or extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness are responsible
  for CD8+ T cell immunosuppression and/or exclusion from the tumour nest.'
