caption: Schematic of the impact of CFTR dysfunction in HLMVEC on oxidative stress,
  inflammation and angiogenesis. Specific pharmacological inhibition of endothelial
  CFTR activity is associated with an increase in intracellular ROS (5 min) and hydrogen
  peroxide (30 min), an increase in phosphorylation of c-jun and activation of AP-1
  (30 min) leading to transcription of IL-8 (16–24 h). These responses are inhibited
  by the antioxidant NAC and the EGFR inhibitor AG1478, indicating a role for EGFR-mediated
  ROS/H2O2 generation in the induction of IL-8 synthesis. The increase in ROS/H2O2
  is associated with increased VEGF and SOD2 expression which serve to sustain high
  levels of intracellular hydrogen peroxide, via effects on VEGFR and superoxide dismutation,
  respectively. Under these conditions Nrf2, the master regulator of oxidative stress,
  is significantly depleted, which is proposed to occur via prolonged exposure to
  high levels of H2O2, activation of GSK-3β and labeling of Nrf2 for β-TrCP recognition,
  ubiquitination and degradation. The suppression of Nrf2 levels to below normal will
  further sensitize endothelial cells to oxidative stress by reducing expression of
  antioxidant genes. Dotted lines indicate proposed pathways. T indicates inhibition
  of a pathway.
