caption: Activity reduction of Dmp53 in the Drosophila insulin-producing cells leads
  to down regulation of dILP2 abundance by unknown mechanisms. Dmp53 activity can
  be reduced through deacetylation by dSir2, the activity of which is increased under
  CR/DR conditions. How dSir2 activity is increased by CR/DR is unclear, but it may
  be that the reduction of specific nutrient components, particularly essential amino
  acids (EAA), underlies the CR/DR effects.Reduced Dmp53 activity inhibits PI3K and
  Akt activity in the fly fat body. As a consequence, dFoxo is predominantly nuclear
  to control transcription, but this event does not control life span. The longevity
  response is transmitted through inhibition of the TOR pathway and the translational
  inhibitor 4E-BP. dFoxo may modify the overall magnitude of the 4E-BP response and
  provide feedback regulation of dILPs (the signaling events underlying CR/DR are
  in red).This model may also apply to mammalian systems, in which the relevant tissues
  and signaling pathways are conserved.
