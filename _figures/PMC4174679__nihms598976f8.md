caption: Invasin binding to β1 integrins on epithelial cells triggers a signaling
  cascade involving focal adhesion proteins including FAK followed by the activation
  of the Rho GTPase Rac 1. Activation of the focal adhesion complex ultimately leads
  to IL-18 gene expression. This integrin signaling pathway coupled with TTSS translocon-mediated
  pore-formation leads to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the secretion
  of IL-18. This signaling cascade is potently inhibited by the activity of the virulence
  factors YopH and YopE during infection with wild type Yersinia enterocolitica.
