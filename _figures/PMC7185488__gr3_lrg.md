caption: Hypothesized Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV)-Mediated Activation Cascades
  Leading to the Pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This illustration depicts
  a hypothetical pathogenic pathway for MS involving HERV-W activation and envelope
  (Env) protein expression triggered by an environmental factor. This causes dysregulated
  inflammatory and immune responses accompanied by activation of microglial cells,
  which thereby also express pathogenic HERV-W Env protein (formerly called MSRV-Env).
  The proposed direct cytotoxic effect on endothelial cells through TLR4 activation
  could contribute to T cell homing through upregulated ICAM-1 expression in response
  to cytokines and chemokines secreted from the initial site of HERV-W expression.
