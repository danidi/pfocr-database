caption: Conventional PPP. Conventional formulation of the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP) that allows the oxidative branch to produce two NADPH molecules per each molecule
  of glucose 6-phosphate (G6P). The non-oxidative branch recycles ribose 5-phosphate
  (R5P) back into G6P for the oxidative branch. R5P is required for the synthesis
  of nucleotides, RNA, and DNA in support of cell growth while NADPH is needed for
  biosynthetic reactions and protects against oxidative stress through neutralizing
  reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) directly or indirectly via regeneration of reduced
  glutathione (GSH) from its oxidized form GSSG.
