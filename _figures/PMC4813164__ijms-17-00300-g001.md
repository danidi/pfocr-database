caption: 'Schematic summary of the gastrointestinal microbial contribution to the
  development of NAFLD. The colored arrows represent stimulated effect, as well as
  the inhibitory effect shown with cross line. The arrows with identical color means
  same pathway involved, and the black arrow indicates increased secretion of LPS.
  Abbreviations: NAFLD: nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; FA: fatty acid; IR: insulin
  resistance; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; BA: bile acid; TMA: trimethylamine; TMAO: trimethylamine-N-oxide.'
