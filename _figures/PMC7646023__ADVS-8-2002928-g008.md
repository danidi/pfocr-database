caption: Schematic summary of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced lung injury and inflammatory responses
  associated with COVID 19 on the human organ chip model system. Following SARS‐CoV‐2
  exposure, virus particles invade the alveolar epithelium and endothelium and replicate
  violently in human epithelial cells. The viral infection can activate the host antiviral
  defense or immune response, including the activation of innate immune responses
  (e.g., IFN‐I signaling pathway) in epithelial cells and JAK‐STAT signaling pathway
  in endothelial cells. The cytokines or chemokines released from infected cells can
  recruit circulating immune cells (such as CD14+ monocytes) to infected sites and
  initiate inflammatory responses. This process further exacerbates the disruption
  of alveolus‐capillary barrier integrity, leading to lung injury.
