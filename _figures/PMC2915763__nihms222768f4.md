caption: A model for glucose-induced closure of K-ATP channels leading to depolarization,
  Ca2+-influx and insulin secretion. Glucose uptake through the Glut2 transporter
  enters the metabolic pathway and generates ATP from ADP. Metabolic synthesis of
  ATP from ADP depletes the local AMP concentration (through ATP + AMP → 2ADP and
  ADP then being converted to ATP) and inhibits the AK-mediated phosphoryl transfer
  cascade that under basal condition generates ADP from ATP in the microenvironment
  of the K-ATP channel. Inhibition of the AK cascade results in a localized increase
  in ATP and decrease of ADP causing channel closure. Additionally, glucose metabolism
  generates diadenosine polyphosphates (APnA) that further inhibit AK-mediated phosphotransfer
  and also directly interact with K-ATP to inhibit channel activity. We therefore
  propose that these three components are involved in the inhibition of K-ATP channels
  resulting in cell depolarization, activation of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels
  (L-VDCC) and the stimulation of insulin secretion.
