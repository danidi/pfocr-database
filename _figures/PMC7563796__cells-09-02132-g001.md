caption: Multiple functions of microglia and macrophages in brain injury. Neurotrophic
  microglia and macrophages (left half) exhibit an intact TCA cycle and stable mitochondrial
  OXPHOS. Microglia that have migrated to the injury site release anti-inflammatory
  cytokines and neurotrophic factors, thus encouraging wound healing and debris clearance.
  Neuroprotective infiltrated macrophages called BINCs (brain Iba1+/NG2+ cells) express
  a variety of neuroprotective factors. Neurotoxic microglia and macrophages (right
  half) produce energy in a glycolysis-dependent manner and exhibit increased lactate
  production, glucose uptake, and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). DAMPs recognized
  by TLR stimulate NFκB pathways, leading to an increased expression of proinflammatory
  mediators. Microglia phagocytose viable neurons by recognizing opsonized PS via
  VNRs and the humoral “eat-me” signal UDP, through P2Y6. Phagocytic microglia and
  macrophages express the phagocytosis marker CD68 and NG2. Neurotoxic infiltrated
  macrophages (NG2−/CD200+ macrophages) release a greater amount of MitoROS, IL1β,
  and NOX2 compared with microglia. MitoROS not only directly damages the brain tissues,
  but also induces proinflammatory reactions by inducing the formation of inflammasomes.
