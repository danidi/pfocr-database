caption: Potential signalling pathways in magnetoreception involving ErCry4 and its
  hypothetical interaction partners. (A, left scheme) ErCry4 might form a complex
  with long-wavelength-sensitive opsin triggering activation of G protein (Gtα)-mediated
  phototransduction. Alternatively, interactions between ErCry4 and Gtα could also
  lead to activation of downstream signalling proteins not involving opsin (A, right
  scheme). The downstream events could be part of the classical phototransduction
  pathway leading to closure of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels via hydrolysis
  of cGMP. However, an unknown pathway leading to an unknown cell response could be
  involved. Both Gtα and Gtγ are attached to membranes by lipid anchors. Thus, they
  might anchor ErCry4 to the surface of the disk membrane. The seven-transmembrane
  receptor opsin could also serve as a membrane anchor for ErCry4. (B) A potential
  complex involving ErCry4 and the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit Kv8.2,
  which is the modifying subunit in a heteromeric K+-channel, could directly affect
  the membrane potential of the cell. (C) Putative interaction of ErCry4 with RBP
  and the retinal photoisomerase RGR that catalyzes the transformation of all-trans-retinal
  to 11-cis-retinal.
