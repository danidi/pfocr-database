caption: 'Inhibitors developed against EZH2. The five types of inhibitors are indicated:
  “S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase inhibitors”, “S-adenosyl-l-methionine competitive
  inhibitors”, “S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine-EZH2 peptides as disruptors of the contact
  between EZH2 and EED”, “Degradation by ubiquitin proteasome pathway”, and “Downregulation
  mediated by the increased expression of miRNAs target of EZH2”. EZH2: Enhancer of
  zeste homolog 2. SUZ12: Zinc finger protein suppressor of zeste 12. EED:WD40 Repeat
  protein embryonic ectoderm development. SET: Su(var)3-9E Enhancer of zeste and Trithorax
  RbAp48: Retinoblastoma-binding protein p48. AEBP2: Adipocyte Enhancer-Binding Protein
  2. DZNep: 3-dezaneplanocin-A Me: methylation. Ub: ubiquitination Mir101: miRNA-101.
  Arrow blue: activation of different pathways Arrow red: inhibition of different
  molecules. Light blue cylinders are histones, and with red ribbons are DNA.'
