caption: Regulation of NF-κB signaling by the proteasome. Multiple inflammatory signals
  result in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB through a variety of
  adapter proteins and kinases. The most abundant form of the NF-κB dimer is the p50/p65
  heterodimer. (A) The p105 precursor is processed by the proteasome, thereby liberating
  the NF-kB p50 subunit for dimerization with p65. IκB retains the NF-κB heterodimer
  in the cytoplasm. (B) Ligand binding to cellular receptors like TLRs activates the
  IKK complex, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of IκB, inducing its poly-ubiquitination
  and degradation by the proteasome. (C) Activated NF-κB translocates into the nucleus,
  where it (D) activates target gene expression. Table  summarizes all reported effects
  of i-proteasome activity on the different steps in this canonical NF-κB signaling
  pathway. NF-kB, nuclear factor kappa B; IκBs, inhibitors of κB; IKK, IκB kinase.
