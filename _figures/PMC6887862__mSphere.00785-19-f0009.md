caption: Schematic summary of Yap1-related signaling cascades under environmental
  stresses. Yap1 is the transcription factor working downstream of the Mpk1 MAPK pathway
  required for maintaining cell wall integrity and responding to oxidative stress
  responses, whereas Atf1 is the transcription factor working downstream of the Hog1
  MAPK pathway required for responding to oxidative and general stresses. However,
  Yap1 and Atf1 are responsible for only a subset of Mpk1- and Hog1-dependent functions,
  respectively, and are also regulated by other signaling pathways. Therefore, Yap1
  and Atf1 play distinct and shared roles in regulating a variety of stresses in C.
