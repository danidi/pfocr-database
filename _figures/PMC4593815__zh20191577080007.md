caption: Schematic of the proposed mechanism for the NSAID-induced reduction in vasa
  recta diameter. Treatment with NSAIDs shunts the metabolism of arachidonic acid
  (AA) from the COX pathway to other pathways, which results in the production of
  alternative vasoconstrictor agents. Increased availability of agonists favoring
  vasoconstriction leads to a reduction in mean blood blow (MBF). Whether these agonists
  act directly on pericytes or indirectly via endothelial signaling has yet to be
  established; however, the data presented here indicate that pericytes are the key
  players in mediating the reduction of vasa recta diameter. LOX, lipooxgenase; Cyt
  P450, cytochrome P-450; LB4, leukotriene B4; 5-HETE, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid;
  PDG2α, PGE2α.
