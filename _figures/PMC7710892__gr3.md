caption: Schematic overview of the CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway. At least 15 genes are
  involved in the CoQ10 biosynthesis pathway; however, the biochemical pathway is
  not yet completely understood. The function of COQ genes shown in italics (COQ8A/ADCK3,
  COQ8B/ADCK4, and COQ9) has not been fully elucidated. COQ8A/ADCK3 and COQ8B/ADCK4
  have a regulatory role, COQ9 is a lipid-binding protein interacting with COQ7. The
  question mark indicates that the enzyme involved in the reaction has not been identified.
  CoA, coenzyme A; COQ, coenzyme Q gene; PDSS, prenyldiphosphate synthase subunit;
  PP, pyrophosphate; 4HB, 4-hydroxybenzoate
