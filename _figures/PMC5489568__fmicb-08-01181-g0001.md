caption: Heterotrophic pathways associated with carbonatogenesis presumed to occur
  in Streptomyces species. Microbially mediated carbonate precipitation might be either
  linked to active transport of calcium ions across cellular membrane through Ca2+/2H+
  antiporter system—ChaA, or to nitrogen cycle-related pathways—ureolysis, ammonification,
  and dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium/ammonia (DNRA). All those pathways
  lead to alkalinization of the bacterial environment through the generation of ammonium,
  shifting the equilibrium toward carbonate/bicarbonate ions, which, upon the presence
  of calcium, precipitate as calcium carbonate (CaCO3). ChaA, apart from providing
  calcium ions for potential precipitation, locally increase pH through simultaneous
  incorporation of protons. The urease activity seems to be linked with cytoplasmic
  carbonic anhydrases (β-CA), which catalyze dehydration of carbonic acid produced
  during ureolysis into carbon dioxide that can constitute an additional source of
  bicarbonate ions for precipitation. The export or import of bicarbonate ions could
  be potentially mediated via the sulfate transporter family protein in cluster with
  CA (SulP-type permease). Assimilation of organic nitrogen from amino acids releases
  extracellular ammonia through deamination, once the metabolic demand for nitrogen
  is fulfilled. The inorganic nitrogen source (), which is imported in Streptomyces
  by Nark-type transporters, can participate into biomineralization exclusively through
  dissimilatory reduction to ammonia mediated by respiratory nitrate reductases (Nar)
  together with potential nitrite reductases (Nir), which would be functional under
  dissimilatory conditions. Reduction of nitrite to ammonia in streptomycetes was
  found to operate through assimilatory pathway catalyzed by NasA and NirBD reductases.
