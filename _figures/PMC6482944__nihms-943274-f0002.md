caption: The cartoon on the left depicts primordial follicles consisting of a primordial
  oocyte and a few pregranulosa cells stay dormant due to the negative regulation
  of cell growth and the cell cycle by transcription factor FoxO3, and negative regulation
  of the mTOR signaling pathway, both controlled by the upstream action of Pten [,,].
  Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of Pten using molecules such as bpV(HOpic)
  can result in enhanced PFGA. FoxO3 has been shown to inhibit the cell cycle via
  regulation of Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1b (Cdkn1b/p27). Oocytes with low
  mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) activity are likely to be held in a state
  of low protein synthesis due to a lack of phosphorylation of the mTOR target Eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4-EBP), remaining out of an active
  cell cycle due to activity of P70S6-kinase (P70S6K), itself a positive regulator
  of cyclin D1, cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), and Retinoblastoma (Rb) proteins
  []. The table on the right presents an updated list of genes and factors shown to
  impact PFGA, with experimental evidence categorized by in vitro and/or in vivo genetic
  evidence. Cartoon adapted from [].
