caption: 'A. The loss of insulin receptor (IR) expression on pancreatic β-cells during
  2nd transition of the pancreatic development results in enhanced secretion of insulin
  growth factor-2 (Igf-2). B. Autocrine/paracrine activation of the insulin growth
  factor-1 receptor (Igf-1r) on pancreatic β-cell by Igf-2 promotes Akt phosphorylation,
  leading to: (1) suppressed phospho-p53 (S15) activation that prevents β-cell apoptosis,
  and (2) increased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor-a (Vegf-a) through
  the Akt/HIF-1/Vegf-a signaling pathway in β-cells []. C. Together, Vegf-a-mediated
  hyper islet vascularization and upregulated Akt activity promotes exaggerated β-cell
  replication and cell survival, leading to an expanded β-cell population within the
  pancreas of MIP-βIRKO animals.'
