caption: 'Schematic representation of the lysosome and autophagy pathway in normal
  cells (A) and lysosomal storage disease (LSD) cells (B). (A) Lysosomes fuse with
  autophagosomes to form autolysosomes. Lysosomes also fuse with endosomes to form
  highly dynamic membrane structures called endolysosomes. Functional lysosomes require
  an acidic environment in the lysosomal lumen (pH 4.5 to 5.0) maintained by the V-ATPase
  proton pump and an adequate level of calcium ions maintained by the TRPML1 transporter.
  TRPML1: mammalian mucolipin TRP channel subfamily, V-ATPase: a vacuolar ATPase.
  (B) LSD is a metabolic disorder caused by mutations in genes that encode lysosomal
  enzymes, consequently leading to accumulation of various substrates. Lysosomes loaded
  with undigested substances lead to defective lysosomal fusion with autophagosomes
  or endosomes. Furthermore, lysosomes of LSD exhibit alterations in lysosomal pH
  and lysosomal Ca2+ homeostasis.'
