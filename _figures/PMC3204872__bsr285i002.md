caption: (1) The mAb anti-TNF drug infliximab triggers pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion
  due to failure to internalize or shed cell surface TNFR1, (2) resulting in TNF-stimulated
  NF-κB activation through the canonical pathway or ligand-independent TNFR1 signalling.
  This in turn results in nuclear translocation of p65 and c-Rel subunits of NF-κB,
  c-Rel-mediated reinforcement of the inhibition of apoptosis, and (3) transcriptional
  activation of cell survival pathways, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion
  and the onset of TRAPS.
