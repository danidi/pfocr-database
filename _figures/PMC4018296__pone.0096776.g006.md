number: Figure 6
caption: (a) Common signaling network between EC109 cells and TT cells. (b) Specific
  EGF-induced signaling network in EC109 cells. (c) Specific EGF-induced signaling
  network in TT cells. The edge color is decided based on the sign of edges; red indicates
  positive signaling, and blue indicates negative signaling.
