caption: Activation of growth factor receptor by ligand (for example, IIS) activates
  a signaling cascade involving tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and downstream
  signaling factors. The protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) normally limits signaling
  by removing the phosphate residues from the receptor and downstream signaling pathway
  factors including AKT. The activated receptor and/or activated PI3K activate nearby
  membrane-associated NADPH oxidase enzyme. The NADPH oxidase catalyzes the production
  of extracellular superoxide. Extracellular superoxide dismutase enzyme (ecSOD) then
  converts the superoxide into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The H2O2 enters the cell
  through the aquaporin water channel, thereby creating a localized burst of hydrogen
  peroxide near the receptor and downstream signaling factors (indicated with red-color
  background). The H2O2 reversibly inactivates the PTP, thereby amplifying the magnitude
  of signaling through the pathway. The signaling pathway down-regulates mitochondrial
  turnover, thereby creating increased mitochondrial abundance, ATP production and
  ROS production, including H2O2 (indicated in red) that support growth and sexual
  differentiation. The mitochondrial H2O2 further contributes to the inactivation
  of PTP, potentially creating a positive feedback loop. The ultimate consequences
  of reduced mitochondrial turnover are longer-lived and more damage-prone mitochondria,
  mitochondrial maintenance failure and aging. Mito = mitochondria.
