caption: 'Androgen “backdoor” steroidogenesis pathway. The orange boxes bear the names
  of the steroid precursors at early stages of steroidogenesis and for 17OHP and its
  derivatives; reddish boxes for the cortisol pathway and its metabolite; blue areas
  (and mixed orange/blue) are background for androgens and their precursors; and finally
  gray boxes bear names of enzymes, which are involved in consecutive steps of steroidogenesis.
  The bluish arrows depict steps of the androgen backdoor pathway. The left side of
  the figure presents a few steps of steroidogenesis leading to cortisol synthesis
  (steroidogenesis beginning from cholesterol towards mineralocorticoid pathway is
  omitted), which are adjacent the rectangle area displaying the irreversible pathway
  from 17OH-progesterone to pregnanetriolone, a marker of adrenal origin of 17OHP.
  The upper row (from 17OH-pregnenolone) presents canonical steroidogenic steps to
  dehydroepiandrosterone (and its sulfate), which initiate progression of so-called
  classic androgen pathways toward testosterone and thereafter, to 5α-dihydrotestosterone.
  The main substrate appears to be 17OH-progesterone, which fuels (broad bluish arrows)
  the ”androgen backdoor pathway" and eventually reaches 5α-dihydrotestosterone with
  omission of testosterone as an intermediate step. The abbreviations of the enzymes
  involved in each step are displayed in gray boxes: AKR1C1/4 aldo-keto reductase
  1C1/1C4 (3αHSD), AKR1C2/4 aldo-keto reductase 1C2/1C4 (3αHSD), AKR1C3 aldo-keto
  reductase 1C3 (17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 5), CYB5 cytochrome b5, CYP11B1
  cytochrome P450 11β-hydroxylase, CYP17A1 cytochrome P450 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase,
  CYP21A2 cytochrome P450 21α-hydroxylase, HSD11B1 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
  type 1 (mainly reductase 11BHSD), HSD11B2 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type
