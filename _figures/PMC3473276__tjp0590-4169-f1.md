caption: Antigen engagement of T cell receptor stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) that
  hydrolyses PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) into IP3 (inositol 1,4,5
  trisphosphate) and diacyl glycerol. Generated IP3 binds to the IP3 receptor (IP3R)
  on the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) membrane to empty the ER Ca2+ store (Phase I,
  store depletion). ER Ca2+ depletion is sensed by STIM1, an EF-hand protein localized
  in the ER membrane, which translocates into the junctions of plasma membrane and
  ER membrane. STIM1 couples with Orai1 at the junctions by protein interaction and
  induces opening of CRAC channels (Phase II, store-operated Ca2+ entry). Opening
  of Orai1 raises the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and enhances mitochondrial
  Ca2+ uptake. The increased Ca2+ ions trigger a broad range of downstream signalling
  pathways including the Ca2+–calmodulin/calcineurin-NFAT (nuclear factor of activated
  T cells) pathway (Phase III, transcriptional events). Ca2+-bound calmodulin (CaM)
  forms a complex with a protein phosphatase, calcineurin (Cn), and dephosphorylates
  the heavily phosphorylated, cytoplasmic NFAT leading to its nuclear translocation.
  Nuclear NFAT forms a multimeric protein complex of itself or with other transcription
  factors (e.g. AP-1) to induce gene transcription involved in cytokine production,
  cell proliferation and cell death depending on the amplitude or duration of [Ca2+]i
  and the associating partners.
