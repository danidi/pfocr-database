caption: 'Three possible mechanisms for constitutive activation of NIK have been considered:
  1) NIK could be mutated such that it is constitutively active; 2) NIK could be activated
  by upstream activators; or 3) NIK could be activated through an autocrine loop.
  Current data suggest that if an autocrine loop contributes to the constitutive activation
  of NIK, it probably does not involve CXCR2, a Gαi-coupled receptor, or the IL-1
  receptor, since CXCR2 blocking antibody, CXCL1 antibody, or pertussis toxin did
  not affect the constitutive NIK activity in three melanoma cell lines. Moreover,
  dominant negative MyD88 and dominant negative IRAK did not affect the constitutive
  NIK activity, ruling out an IL-1 receptor-mediated autocrine loop. Since transfection
  with wild type NIK did not increase the NF-κB luciferase activity, if NIK is activated
  by a novel upstream activator, the novel factor would probably be rate-limiting.
  We therefore postulate that NIK may undergo an activating mutation(s) in tumor cells,
  leading to constitutive NF-κB activation.'
