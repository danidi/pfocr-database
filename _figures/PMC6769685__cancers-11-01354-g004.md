caption: 'Metabolism of F-araAMP in normal and tumoural cells subjected to Escherichia
  coli PNP (ePNP)/F-araAMP GDEPT. 9-β-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenosine 5’-monophoaphate
  (F-araAMP) is cleaved by plasma phosphatases into 9-β-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine
  (F-araAde), which enters both normal and tumoural cells. Inside the cell, it is
  activated to the monophosphate by cellular deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). In tumour
  cells, the presence of ePNP allows for an additional activation pathway, which proceeds
  through a phosphorolytic cleavage to give 2-fluoroadenine (F-Ade), which is activated
  by cellular adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT). Through the action of ribonucleotide
  reductase (RR), F-ADP is converted to the respective deoxynucleotide, thus interfering
  also on DNA synthesis. GDEPT: gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy.'
