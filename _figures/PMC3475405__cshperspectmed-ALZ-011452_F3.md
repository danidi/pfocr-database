caption: 'The role of blood–brain barrier (BBB) transport in homeostasis of brain
  Aβ. Influx pathway: RAGE, the receptor for advanced glycation end products, mediates
  influx and reentry of circulating Aβ across the BBB. RAGE-mediated Aβ influx is
  accompanied by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of nuclear
  factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated inflammatory response in endothelium, that is, increased
  production of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin (IL)
  1β and 6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP1), as well as increased expression
  of several leukocyte adhesion molecules (not shown). RAGE also mediates transport
  of Aβ-laden monocytes across the BBB. Efflux pathway: LRP, the low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein-1, mediates Aβ clearance from brain via transport of free
  Aβ and Aβ-bound to apoE2 and apoE3, but not apoE4, across the BBB. Other Aβ transport
  proteins in brain interstitial fluid such as apoJ and α-2 macroglobulin (α2M) influence
  Aβ clearance from brain. Aβ enzymatic clearance, oligomerization, and aggregation
  also control Aβ levels in brain. Soluble form of LRP (sLRP) in plasma is a major
  binding protein of plasma Aβ. sLRP is produced by the proteolytic cleavage from
  LRP mediated by β-secretase (BACE). Liver and kidneys mediate systemic clearance
  of free Aβ and of sLRP–Aβ complexes. APP, Aβ-precurosr protein. TJ, tight junctions.
