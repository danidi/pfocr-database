caption: NK2 homeobox 1 (NKX2-1)–Sam Pointed Domain Ets-like Factor (SPDEF)–associated
  gene network analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. (A) Genes/proteins are represented
  as nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a
  line. Solid lines indicate direct relationships, dashed lines mean indirect relationships,
  open line is binding, arrow indicates activation, and closed line is inhibition.
  mRNAs up- or down-regulated in transgenic mice expressing NKX2-1 after ovalbumin
  sensitization are color coded in orange or green, respectively. Biological relationships
  are derived from the combined analyses of microarray samples from transgenic mouse
  models in which NKX2-1, Spdef, or Foxa2 genes were selectively perturbed; experimental
  data (reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, and immunohistochemistry);
  and peer-reviewed publications (Ingenuity knowledge base). NKX2-1 expression suppressed
  genes involved in mucus production, goblet cell differentiation (e.g., Spdef, Muc5ac,
  Muc4, Clca1, Agr2, Scin), and allergic inflammation (e.g., Ccl17, Ccl22, Ccr8, Il4,
  Il13, and Chia), while promoting the expression of genes involved in acute inflammatory
  response (e.g., Il6, Saa1, Saa4, Adora3, Orm1, and Orm2) and epithelial development
  (e.g., NKX2-1, Etv5, Chrna7, Areg). (B) Schema of the inhibitory role of NKX2-1
  in goblet cell metaplasia.
