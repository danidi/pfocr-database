caption: A summary of possible p42mpk1 functions during Xenopus oocyte maturation.
  Progesterone stimulates the translation of maternal mRNAs and triggers the synthesis
  of the protein kinase Mos, which activates p42mpk1 via MAP kinase kinase. p42mpk1
  activates p90rsk, which in turn down-regulates the p34cdc2 inhibitory kinase Myt1.
  Our results indicate that D2 interferes with p42mpk1signaling in oocytes but does
  not affect the activation of p42mpk1 and p90rsk. Instead, D2 interferes with the
  phosphorylation and activation of Plx1. This pathway, which may lead to Cdc25 up-regulation,
  is triggered by p42mpk1 independently of pre-MPF activation but requires protein
  synthesis. Expression of D2 also inhibits the nuclear migration and pseudomaturation,
  which appears to be triggered by the sustained activation of p42mpk1 in the absence
  of MPF activation.
