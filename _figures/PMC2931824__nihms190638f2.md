caption: 'EGCG''s mode of action: Environmental factors such as metals cause oxidative
  stress, leading to protein, lipid, and DNA damage. EGCG is known to chelate transition
  metals like Fe and Cu, there by prevents oxidative stress. EGCG also acts as an
  anti-inflammatory molecule and increases the activity of SOD and Catalase. EGCG
  induces the PI3K/Akt-signaling pathway, and this pathway has a pivotal role in neuronal
  cell survival.'
