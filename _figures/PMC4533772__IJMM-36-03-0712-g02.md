caption: Analyses of interactions among SHRSP-specific genes. Interactions among SHRSP-specific
  genes isolated when the rats were 3 and 6 weeks of age were analyzed using IPA.
  The 8 nodes on the left corresponded to SHRSP-specific genes isolated at 3 weeks
  of age, while the 11 nodes on the right corresponded to SHRSP-specific genes isolated
  at 6 weeks of age. Nodes colored light blue represented BP-regulating genes categorized
  into GO:0003013 (circulatory system process) by DAVID () and/or categorized into
  cardiovascular system development and function (development of cardiovascular system)
  by IPA () at 3 weeks of age, and nodes colored pink represented Huntington's disease-related
  genes categorized into hereditary disorder (Huntington's disease) at 6 weeks of
  age. SHRs, spontaneously hypertensive rats; SHRSP, stroke-prone SHRs; IPA, Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis; BP, blood pressure.
