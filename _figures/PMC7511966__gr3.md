caption: Schematic representation of the role of oxylipins in the control of leaf
  senescence. Under optimal growing conditions (lower panel) leaves only produce small
  amounts of oxylipins as a result of low lipid peroxidation induced by mild levels
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Such conditions inhibit the jasmonic acid signaling
  pathway and JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN PROTEIN (JAZ) represses expression of MYC transcription
  factors, while low levels of lipid hydroperoxides and malondialdehyde (MDA) induce
  the production of antioxidants that enable ROS control in plant cells. During senescence
  (upper panel), jasmonic acid plays a prominent role in the activation of senescence-associated
  genes (SAGs) and expression of chlorophyll catabolic enzymes such as pheophorbide
  a (PAO1) that contribute to chlorophyll degradation and programmed cell death with
  a tight control of ROS production and oxylipin formation by antioxidant systems.
