caption: Salt appetite and regulation of salt homeostasis in the brain. (A) Gut-brain
  axis for a high salt diet. High dietary salt intake modulates T-helper 17 (Th17)
  and enhances the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL17, which suppresses
  endothelial NO production by inducing inhibitory phosphorylation of eNOS at Thr495.
  The NO deficit results in reduced calpain nitrosylation in neurons. This calpain
  activation cleaves p35 to p25, which activates Cdk5 and then phosphorylates Tau.
  The hyperphosphorylation of Tau is ultimately responsible for cognitive dysfunction.
  Rescue of NO deficit with l-arginine prevents the cognitive dysfunction. (B) The
  salt appetite-related signaling pathway in human and mouse brains. Sodium ingestion
  is regulated by three regions as indicated by the dotted lines in the human brain.
  The serotonin receptor in LPBN suppresses salt appetite. The Nax channel is a salt
  sensor expressed in glial cells surrounding the subfornical organ (SFO). The taste
  messages in the mouse are processed to the lateral parabrachial (LPBN) via the NST.
  Aldosterone-sensitive NTS HSD2 neurons projecting to the medial central lateral
  parabrachial nucleus (PBN), the pre-locus coeruleus (pre-LC) and the ventral bed
  nucleus of the stria terminalis (vBNST) increase sodium intake. Two populations
  of neurons in the SFO project to the organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis
  (OVLT) and vBNST to increase water and sodium intake, respectively. Angiotensin
  II (Ang II) and aldosterone (Aldo) influence the SFO and the OVLT.
