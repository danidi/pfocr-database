caption: In the shoots, a strong induction was observed of LOX2 after JA treatment,
  whereas in the roots LOX2 did not respond and only a two-fold up regulation of LOX1
  was observed. In both roots and shoots, RJA and SJA differentially affected the
  expression of the AOC and OPR3 genes. Heat maps represent the log2 of the fold changes
  in expression after RJA or SJA compared to CON for all genes that were significantly
  affected in at least one of the treatment groups (ANOVA, FDR corrected P-value <0.1).
  RRJA, Root tissue RJA treatment; RSJA Root tissue SJA treatment; SRJA, Shoot tissue
  RJA treatment; SSJA, Shoot tissue SJA treatment.
