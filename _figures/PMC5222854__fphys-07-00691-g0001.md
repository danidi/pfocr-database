caption: 'Strigolactone (SL) Biosynthetic pathway: figure shows the biosynthetic pathway
  of SL production and key enzymes involved in biosynthesis. SL biosynthesis occurs
  in two separate compartments, plastid and cytosol. Biosynthesis starts in plastid
  with the conversion of trans-β-carotene to (Z)-(R)-carlactone (CL) involving three
  intermediate steps catalyzed by trans/9-cys-β-carotene Isomerase, CCD7, and CCD8,
  respectively. Carlactone further moves to cytosol and there with the help of Cytochrome
  P450 monooxygenase (MAX1) and several other unidentified enzymes it is further converted
  to different other SLs. Enzymes involved in this biosynthetic pathway in different
  plants are named accordingly like Arabidopsis (MAX), Rice (D), and in Pea (RMS).'
