caption: p53 is degraded under homeostatic conditions by its negative regulator MDM2,
  which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. MDM2 monoubiquitinates p53 and consequently induces
  the proteasomal degradation of p53. Several small molecules that disrupt the interaction
  between p53 and MDM2 are being investigated including HLI98, the nutlins, RITA and
  others. The activity of wild-type p53 may also be restored by inhibiting Crm1-mediated
  nuclear export or by inhibiting Sirt-1 and Sirt-2, which deacetylate p53 to decreases
  its activity. The tenovins are a class of small molecules that inhibit Sirt. Mutant
  p53 can be therapeutically targeted using small molecules such as CP-31398 or PRIMA-1
  or the peptide C1(C369–383) to a cause a conformational shift in the mutant p53
  to restore WT conformation and therefore activity. Adenovirus-based therapies such
  as Advexin and Gendicine can also be used to deliver wild-type p53. NSC176327 and
  RETRA restore WT p53 function by increasing p73 levels.
