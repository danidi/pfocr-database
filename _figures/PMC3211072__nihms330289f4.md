caption: 'Mammary Cell Proliferation Network. Blue arrow means activation and red
  arrow means inhibition. Cytokine TGFβ inhibits cell growth promoter, c-MYC. In additional,
  c-MYC promotes cell proliferation by repressing several cell growth suppressor proteins,
  p15, p21. TGFβ elevates activity of three cyclin-dependent kinase’s inhibitor: p15,
  p21 and p27. p15, p21 and p27 inhibit the complex formation between cyclinD and
  CDK4,6 and p27, p21 further prevent cyclinE-CDK2’s activation. TGFβ elevates expression
  of CDK4/6-specific inhibitor p15. p27 binds to CDK4,6 to form a complex, meanwhile,
  p27 is released from this protein complex under the presence of p15. p15 indirectly
  stimulates the surge of p27. CyclinD1 and CDKs 4,6 form a complex which drives the
  cell proliferation in combination with complex formed by cyclinE and CDK2. Besides
  TGFβ pathway, hyperactive Ras signaling regulates cell developments and promotes
  cell growth. (a) Dynamic Bayesian Network. (b) 2-Time-Slice Bayesian Network.'
