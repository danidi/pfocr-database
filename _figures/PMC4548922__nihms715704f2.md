caption: Decreased fatty acid oxidation contributes to CKD progression. Schematic
  model describing lipid abnormalities in renal tubule cells during fibrosis. Renal
  tubule cells take up long-chain fatty acids taken up via CD36. Fatty acids are then
  either stored in lipid droplets or oxidized in the mitochondria. The rate-limiting
  step in fatty acid oxidation is the uptake of fatty acids by mitochondria; this
  is regulated by CPT1. The RXR/PGC1a complex plays a critical role in transcriptional
  regulation of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis. Smad3 and TGFB1
  and the LKB1 and AMPK pathway play an important role in regulating the PGC1a/RXR
  complex. Defective fatty acid oxidation in CKD results in energy depletion and increased
  apoptosis and dedifferentiation and kidney fibrosis development. CD36 CD36 molecule
  (thrombospondin receptor); TGFB1 transforming growth factor, beta 1; RXR retinoid
  X receptor, alpha; PGC1A peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator
  1 alpha; LKB1 liver kinase B1; AMPK AMPK-activated protein kinase; CPT1 carnitine
  palmitoyltransferase
