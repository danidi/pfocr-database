caption: Noncanonical GLI1 signaling sustaining LAC growth and CSC maintenance. The
  HH pathway effector GLI1 can be activated even in the absence of SMO, the canonical
  upstream activator of HH signaling, whose expression is epigenetically silenced
  in many GLI1-expressing LACs. GLI1 serves as a downstream effector of oncogenic
  MAPK/ERK signaling, which can be triggered by ligand-binding events at NRP2 receptors
  expressed by the cancer cells. GLI1 then promotes features involved in tumor growth
  and CSC maintenance, including the transcription of known HH target genes (for example,
  ABCG2 and VEGFA). The VEGFA that binds epithelial-cell NRP2 receptors is secreted
  by the epithelial cells themselves, and this autocrine signaling loop is self-amplified
  by GLI1-upregulated transcription of both the receptor (NRP2) and its ligand (VEGFA).
  NRP2/ERK/GLI signaling can also be activated in a paracrine fashion by VEGFA secreted
  by cells in the tumor stroma. The stromal VEGFA production is the result of canonical
  SMO-dependent HH–GLI signaling triggered by SHH secreted by epithelial cells. The
  output of this stromal signaling includes VEGFA, which in turn bind tumor-cell NRP2,
  thereby triggering the noncanonical MAPK/ERK-mediated GLI1 activation illustrated
  in the upper panel.
