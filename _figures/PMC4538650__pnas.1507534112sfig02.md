caption: (A) Schematic of TRIM21 antiviral mechanism. TRIM21 and the E2 Ub conjugation
  enzyme Ube2W mediate monoubiquitination of TRIM21. This provides a substrate for
  Ub-63Ub chain elongation by the E2 heterodimer Ube2N/Ube2V2, resulting in TRIM21-anchored
  Ub-63Ub chains. The proteasome-associated deubiquitinase Poh1 liberates polyubiquitin
  from TRIM21, thus synchronizing both “effector” (virus degradation) and “sensor”
  (immune signal induction) functions of TRIM21. (B) RIG-I stimulates the NF-κB pathway
  via IKK and is unaffected by depletion of Poh1. IκBα is phosphorylated and degraded
  by the proteasome but is unaffected by depletion of Poh1. TRIM21 stimulates the
  NF-κB pathway via IKK and is impaired by depletion of Poh1. Thus, Poh1 is required
  at the indicated point of the signaling pathway.
