caption: Molecular mechanism of myostatin in muscle mass regulation in CKD. Myostatin
  appears to induce muscle wasting independent of NF-κB pathway. Increased levels
  of myostatin blocks myogenesis by downregulating pax3 and myoD expression. In addition,
  myostatin upregulates proteolysis by phosphorylating FOXO1 through the inhibition
  of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Blunt-ended line represents inhibition.
