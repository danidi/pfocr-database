caption: Proposed model for Syk in mediating oxidative stress-induced calcium release.
  Phosphorylation of Syk by Lyn and autophosphorylation is required for oxidative
  stress-induced activation of Syk. How Lyn senses oxidative stress in DT40 cells
  is currently unknown. Oxidative stress might inhibit tyrosine phosphatase, thereby
  activating Lyn; Activated Syk phosphorylates phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) and adaptor
  protein B cell linker protein (BLNK). Phosphorylated BLNK provides docking sites
  for PLCγ2 and Btk, enable Btk phosphorylates PLCγ2. Simultaneous phosphorylation
  of PLCγ2 by Syk and Btk is indispensable for oxidative stress-induced activation
  of PLCγ2; Activated PLCγ2 cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, releases
  IP3, triggering Ca2+ release via binding to ryanodine receptor. Oxidative stress
  also activates PI3K pathway signaling through recruitment of p85 PI3K to the particulate
  fraction, producing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate that targets the activated
  PLCγ2 to its substrate site for maximal catalytic efficiency.
