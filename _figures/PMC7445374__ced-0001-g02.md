caption: 'The contact system in disease states. FXII is activated into FXIIa either
  by endogenous activator (nucleic acids RNA/DNA, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs),
  polyphosphate, and heparin) or artificial surfaces. FXIIa then activates 4 different
  pathways: (1) The inflammation kallikrein-kinin pathway by converting plasma prekallikrein
  (PPK) into active plasma kallikrein (PK), which cleaves both FXII into FXIIa and
  high molecular weight kininogen (HK) to bradykinin (BK). The latter binds to kinin
  receptors (B2 and B1 receptors) and triggers inflammation. (2) The complement system
  by activation of the C1qrs complex subunits C1r and C1s leading formation of the
  membrane attack complex by the classical complement pathway. (3) The fibrinolytic
  system by PK activation of prourokinase into urokinase that in turn cleaves plasminogen
  into plasmin, an enzyme that degrades fibrin clots. (4) The intrinsic coagulation
  pathway by FXI activation into FXIa leading to thrombin activation and fibrin generation.
  The contact system is controlled mainly by C1 inhibitor (C1-Inh) that inhibits both
  FXIIa and PK. Other endogenous inhibitors including antithrombin III (ATIII), α-2-macroglobulin
  (α2M), and α-2-antiplasmin (α2AP) contribute in controlling contact system proteases
  and new synthetic “exogenous” inhibitors have been developed to interfere with contact
  system-mediated diseases. Green arrows indicate activation, and red arrows inhibition.
