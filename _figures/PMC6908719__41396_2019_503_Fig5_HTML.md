caption: Artistic illustration of primary functions observed for the Bering Strait
  microbiome as a system in response to additions of algal organic matter (OM). The
  initial microbiome (Day 0) had a higher abundance of peptides correlating to outer
  membrane proteins, such as transporters and receptors, and enzymes involved in the
  C1 metabolic pathway. At day 0, lysed native algal organic matter was added to the
  incubation experiments yeilding a significant increase in peptides related to cellular
  growth within the microbiome observed including translation, ATP generation, and
  glycolysis. By day 6, significant increases in peptides associated with ABC transporters,
  the uptake and utilization of a range of nitrogen sources, and intracellular nitrogen
  recycling were identified. These pathways were inherently linked with increased
  abundances of peptides involved in the TCA cycle, which included increases in metal-binding
  proteins, GS-GOGAT pathway, and vitamin production. ADP adenosine diphosphate, ATP
  adenosine triphosphate, AKG alphaketogluterate, LSU large ribosomal subunit, OAA
  oxaloacetate, GS glutamine synthetase, GOGAT glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase
  (Glutamate synthase), SSU small ribosomal subunit, RBP ribosomal binding proteins,
  THF tetrahydrofolate
