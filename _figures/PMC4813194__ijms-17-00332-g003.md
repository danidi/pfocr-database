caption: 'Crosstalk between Autophagy and Apoptosis. Bcl-2/Beclin-1: The interaction
  between the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and the autophagy protein Beclin-1 is essential
  to regulate the switch between autophagy and apoptosis. Bcl-2 binds to Beclin-1
  and segregates Beclin-1 away from class III PI3K, leading to an inhibition of autophagic
  response. Atgs: Atg12 has a dual function of participating in autophagy and apoptosis,
  which connects both of the processes. Non-conjugated Atg12 can bind to Bcl-2 through
  a unique BH3-like motif, which positively regulates mitochondrial apoptosis. Caspases:
  caspases, a family of cysteine proteases, are both the initiators and effectors
  participating in apoptotic cascades. Caspase-3 can cleave Beclin-1 and inhibit autophagy.
  Caspase-6 can cleave Atg3, Atg5 and Beclin-1, which regulates autophagy. Caspase-9
  can promote the Atg7-dependent formation of autophagosomal LC3-II and autophagic
  activity. p53: In nucleus, p53 promotes the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins
  (such as Bax, Bid, PUMA, and Noxa), which triggers the intrinsic apoptotic pathway;
  in cytoplasm, p53 increases the expression of TRAIL receptor and Fas receptor, causing
  the initiation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. p53 is also involved in the regulation
  of autophagy. Autophagy can be induced by transcriptional activation of DRAM, promoting
  autolysosome formation. DRAM seems to be a critical component of the network regulating
  p53-mediated apoptosis and autophagy. Cytoplasmic p53 suppresses autophagy by activating
  mTOR signaling. Under the nutrient deprivation condition, p53 post-transcriptionally
  downregulates LC3, which controls the autophagic flux and prevents the cells from
  ‘‘autophagic burst’’. FLIP: FLIP is an anti-apoptotic protein, suppressing the death
  receptor–mediated apoptosis. FLIP competes with LC3 for binding of Atg3 and inhibits
  LC3 lipidation, which suppresses autophagy. Red arrows indicate stimulatory inputs.
  Blue bars indicate inhibitory interactions. For clarity, some of the signaling connections
  between autophagy and apoptosis are not shown. See text for details.'
