caption: Abnormal one-carbon metabolism, either through folate deficiency or through
  polymorphisms in folate metabolizing genes, may promote lymphomagenesis through
  mechanisms involving aberrant DNA synthesis, repair and methylation (hypomethylation
  of proto-oncogenes or hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes). A 677C>T (222Ala>Val)
  polymorphism in the MTHFR gene, associated with reduced MTHFR enzyme activity, may
  cause DNA hypomethylation while increasing the flux of one-carbon units available
  for purine and DNA synthesis and repair. Reduced TYMS enzyme activity may increase
  uracil incorporated in DNA and result in chromosome damage and fragile site induction.
  A 28-bp double repeat in the promoter region and a 6-bp deletion in the 3′UTR of
  the TYMS gene alter TYMS gene expression and mRNA stability, that can influence
  the rate of DNA double strand breaks and chromosomal translocations. S-adenosylmethionine
  (SAM); S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH); tetrahydrofolate (THF); serine hydroxymethyltransferase
  (SHMT); 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-methyleneTHF); 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase (MTHFR); 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-methylTHF); methionine synthase (MTR);
  thymidylate synthase (TYMS); deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP); and deoxyuridine
  monophosphate (dUMP).
