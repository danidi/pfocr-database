caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway to enc-based polyketides (1-10) and structures
  of analogous act-derived polyketides (11-13). Path A involves monooxidation of 14
  to the trione intermediate 16, whereas path A′ involves a dioxygenase role of EncM
  in which the C7-C12 olefin of the aldol product 15 is oxidatively cleaved to 16.
  The Favorskii-like rearrangement is speculated to occur on a putative ACP (EncC)-bound
  intermediate. The relative size of the reaction arrows reflects the flux in the
  pathway to the major product 1 as can be observed chromatographically (see ). Dashed
  lines in structures 16 and 17 represent newly created bonds. In compounds 14-17,
  the carbon numbering is based on linear 14 in which priority is given to the carboxyl
  carbon; the numbering in compounds 1, 9, and 10 is in contrast based on that defined
  in ref.  for 9.
