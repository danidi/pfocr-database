caption: 'Early HIV signaling through chemokine coreceptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) and late
  chronic immune activation may trigger cofilin hyperactivation, impairing CD4 T cell
  migration and homing to lymphoid tissues such as GALTs. ART alone is not sufficient
  to restore T cell motility. For early, low levels of cofilin hyperactivation, stimulation
  of the upstream regulators of cofilin through antibodies (e.g., stimulating chemokine
  or integrin receptors such as the α4β7 receptor), receptor agonists, or activators
  of G proteins and GTPases may repair cofilin-mediated T cell migratory defect. For
  late, high levels of cofilin hyperactivation, it may need to use LIMK (the cofilin
  kinase) activators or the cofilin phosphatase (slingshot) inhibitors to directly
  inhibit cofilin dephosphorylation to restore actin dynamics. Therapeutically, targeting
  cofilin to restore T cell motility may bring two major benefits: (i) For uninfected
  cells, the restoration of CD4 T cell circulation and homing to lymphoid tissues
  such as GALTs may help immune reconstitution; (ii) for latent HIV+ T cells, the
  restoration of T cell circulation and homing to lymphoid tissues may lead to their
  reactivation and eventual containment by the restored immune system, reducing latent
  viral reservoirs persistent in the peripheral blood and in tissues.'
