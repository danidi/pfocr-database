caption: 'The lactase pathway. The FGF21 was found to enhance MAPkinases (ERK1/2)
  phosphorylation in intestinal explants and to stimulate lactase production and glucose
  homeostasis. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) of the intestinal microbiota are the
  main source of lactase in adult. Bacterial lactase genes in the intestinal microbiota
  derived from Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. The bacterial species
  that transform the carbohydrates into lactate mainly belong to the genera Bifidobacterium
  and Lactobacillus, as well as Streptococcus and Enterococcus. Lactate is produced
  by reduction of pyruvate. LAB can be divided in two metabolic classes: first, the
  homofermentative bacteria that produce lactate includes some Lactobacilli and most
  species of Pediococcus, Vagococci, Streptococci, Tetragenococci, and Enterococci
  (including Enterococcus faecium), and the heterofermentative species include Leuconostocs,
  Oenococci, Weissella species, and some lactobacilli that produce lactate, carbon-dioxide
  (CO2), acetate, and/or ethanol. Patients receiving allo-HCT as treatment of hematologic
  malignancies and who have an abundance of lactase-producing bacteria (left) produce
  lactate from lactose and are less sensitive to GVHD. Patients with allo-HCT, who
  carry a microbiota that produces low lactase, accumulate lactose that increases
  the abundance of lactose auxotroph bacteria (En. faecium) with a concomitant decrease
  of the microbiota diversity (right), triggering pro-inflammatory responses, and
  serving as a breeding ground for GVHD.'
