caption: 'During somatic reprogramming by expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc,
  somatic cells rapidly accelerate the cell cycle. Ectopic overexpression of cell
  cycle proteins or inactivation of cell cycle inhibitors increases the efficiency
  of reprogramming. Conversely, serial passaging leads to a decreased reprogramming
  rate. CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of Sox2 or cyclin BCDK1-dependent upregulation
  of LIN28 were postulated to aid reprogramming. RB1 represses expression of core
  pluripotency factors. The cell cycle machinery is also important for the maintenance
  of ESC pluripotency. G1 cyclins stabilize core pluripotency factors through phosphorylation,
  thereby preventing their proteasomal degradation. High levels of cyclins and Cdk1-dependent
  phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt pathway components likely contribute to the maintenance
  of pluripotency. Cdk1 also inhibits Oct4 activity during the M phase, acting through
  PP1 and Aurkb. Upward blue arrows indicate increased expression. Abbreviations:
  ESC: embryonic stem cell; IPSC: induced pluripotent stem cell.'
