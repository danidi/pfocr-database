caption: Hg(II) promoted ROS formation in cytoplasm inducing oxidative stress, finally
  led to apoptosis. However, luteolin triggered the activation of NF-κB/Nrf2/P53 signaling
  pathway and prevented liver injury induced by Hg(II). Green line denotes stimulatory
  or inhibitory effect of luteolin, and red line denotes inhibitory effect.
