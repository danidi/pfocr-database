caption: 'The RLR signalsome is shown including the RNA Polymerase/RIG-I pathway for
  indirect recognition of cytosolic foreign DNA. Viral proteins known to block RLR
  signaling are shown with lines associating the specific factors they target. Viruses
  or viral Genus are denoted in parenthesis next to their specific proteins.Abbreviations:
  CCHFV (Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus), BDV(Borna Disease virus), HTNV (Haantan
  Virus).'
