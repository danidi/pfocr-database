caption: Summary of the convergence of the E2–ERK and mTORC1 signaling pathways in
  regulating migration and invasion in LAM patient-derived cells. These have TSC2
  mutations and therefore are hyperactive in mTORC1 activity (). E2 activates the
  ERK pathway, uses biphasic and sustained ERK2 activation, and stimulates the transcriptional
  induction of the LRG, Fra1. Concurrently, constitutively activation of mTORC1 in
  LAM cells enhances the translation of accumulating Fra1 mRNA. Blocking mTORC1/S6K1
  with either an mTORC1 inhibitor or an S6K1 inhibitor inhibits the phosphorylation
  of eIF4B and therefore decreases the translation efficiency of Fra1 and downstream
  cellular processes such as ZEB1/2 induction, EMT markers, and cell migration and
  invasion. Inhibitors used in this study are the transcription inhibitor ActD (5
  µg/mL), the MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 (AZD; 5 µM), the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin
  (rapa; 20 nM), and the S6K1 inhibitor PF4708671 (30 µM).
