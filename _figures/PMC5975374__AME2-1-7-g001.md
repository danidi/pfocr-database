caption: Glucose metabolic pathways under euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions.
  A, Under normal physiological conditions, glucose is used for energy (ATP) production
  via glycolysis and the Krebs cycle pathways. Glucose can also be fluxed to the pentose
  phosphate pathway that makes NADPH and ribose. Excess glucose can be stored as glycogen
  or fatty acids. B, Under diabetic conditions, approximately 30% of glucose can be
  fluxed to the polyol pathway, whereby glucose is converted to fructose via 2 consecutive
  reactions that also transform NADPH to NADH
