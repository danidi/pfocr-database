caption: Schematic representation of TNF’s dual effect on rat pinealocytes. TNF stimulates
  TNF-R1, leading to internalization of the receptor and activation of the NFKB pathway.
  This activation is mediated by the degradation of NFKBIA and depends on its phosphorylation
  (Neumann and Naumann, ). Next, we observed the nuclear translocation of the p50/p50
  and p50/RelA dimers. p50/p50 NFKB acts to inhibit gene transcription, whereas p50/RelA
  activates gene transcription. We have shown previously that TNF inhibits the transcription
  of Aanat, which encodes the key protein for melatonin synthesis (Fernandes et al.,
  ). In fact, TNF inhibits melatonin synthesis. Here, we also show that the nuclear
  translocation of p50/RelA induces the transcription of iNOS, a hallmark enzyme of
  inflammatory responses. We suggest that the mechanism of action of TNF, as determined
  in the present paper, is the molecular basis for understanding the inhibition of
  melatonin synthesis that occurs at the beginning of an innate immune response.
