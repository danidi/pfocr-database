caption: 'A. Radiation initiates at least four molecular effects: 1) radiation activates
  the canonical NF-κB p65/p50 and p50/p50 complexes that directly bind to the TNFα
  promoter to activate its transcription; 2) radiation-activated canonical NF-κB p65/p50
  and p50/p50 complexes also directly bind to the FAS promoter to activate its transcription
  to increase tumor cell sensitivity to apoptosis induction by FasL of tumor-infiltrating
  Tc1 cells; 3) radiation-activated NF-κB also up-regulates the T cell chemokines
  CCL2 and CCL5 to attract T cell infiltration to the tumor microenvironment; and
  4) radiation-generated dsDNA fragments activate the STING pathway, as characterized
  by increased IRF3 and IFNβ expression, to induce T cell activation. B. TNFα in the
  tumor microenvironment induces tumor apoptosis and necroptosis in an autocrine manner,
  and RIP1 is a key molecular switch that determines whether TNFα induces cell death
  or survival signaling pathways. cIAP1 and cIAP2 ubiquitylates RIP1 in the TNFR cytoplasmic
  complex (complex I) and the ubiquitylated RIP1 promotes cell survival by preventing
  the formation of the death complex IIb. BV6 induces cIAP1 and cIAP2 degradation.
  Degradation of cIAP1 and cIAP2 leads to activation of caspase 9. Degradation of
  cIAP1 and cIAP2 also leads to deubiquitylation of RIP1. Deubiquitylated RIP1 dissociates
  from the membrane-bound TNFR complex I to form cytosolic complex IIb that mediates
  both caspase-dependent apoptosis and RIP3-dependent necroptosis.'
