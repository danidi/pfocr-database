caption: 'NPs interfere with canonical, non-canonical and alternative routes of inflammasome
  activation. Canonical inflammasome activation requires two signals: the first, represented
  by TLR-ligand engagement, involves NF-κB and ERK1/2 activation and culminates in
  the increased expression of pro-IL-1β and PRRs, such as NLRP3; the second, provided
  by stress signals, results in Caspase-1 activation and pro-IL-1β cleavage. NPs,
  by binding to NPR-1 induce an intracellular increase in cGMP which activates PKG-I.
  This latter is responsible for NF-κB and ERK1/2 inhibition and possibly for the
  phosphorylation of NLRP3, thus impeding the assembly of the inflammasome platform.
  Non-canonical inflammasome signaling depends on the activation of Caspase-4 and
  -5 in human by a direct binding to cytosolic LPS. Caspase-4/5 process Gasdermin
  D which translocates to the plasma membrane forming pores that may cause K+ efflux
  responsible for inflammasome platform assembly. Moreover, Gasdermin D may serve
  as a conduit for the release of IL-1β. NPs-induced increase in intracellular cGMP
  levels inhibits Gasdermin D cleavage. Alternative inflammasome activation pathway
  culminates, upon TLR4 engagement, TRIF and RIPK1 endorsement, in the cleavage of
  Caspase-8 which can directly cleave pro-IL-1β or regulate the NLRP3 inflammasome.
  PKG-I, activated by cGMP, reduced RIPK1 expression levels. Moreover, the intracellular
  cGMP rise evoked by NPs leads to inhibition of Caspase-8 cleavage.'
