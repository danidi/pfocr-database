caption: Lin28/let-7 regulatory axis. In undifferentiated cells, Lin28 is highly expressed
  and blocks the biogenesis of let-7 miRNA. By binding to the pre-element of pri-
  or pre-let-7, neither Drosha nor Dicer can process the corresponding let-7 precursor.
  In addition, Lin28 recruits TUT4/TUT7 to pre-let-7 and promotes its 3′-end oligo-uridylation.
  Oligo-uridylated pre-let-7 cannot be cleaved by Dicer and thus serves as a signal
  for the cellular 3′–5′ exoribonuclease Dis3l2. Upon differentiation, Lin28 expression
  is reduced, which leads to increased levels of mature let-7. The latter silences
  gene expression of proto-oncogenes (Ras, c-Myc, Hmga2), cell cycle progression factors
  (Cyclin D1 and D3, Cdk4), components of the insulin-PI3K-mTOR pathway and Lin28
  itself, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop. Besides its role in differentiation,
  a Lin28/let-7 regulatory network is apparently involved in several cellular processes
  such as proliferation, oncogenesis, development and physiology, as well as metabolism
  (recently reviewed in []).
