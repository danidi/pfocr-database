caption: A model explaining how RSV may mediate energy homeostasis and lifespan expansion
  in Ppt1-KO mice. Increased ER and oxidative stresses lead to neuronal apoptosis
  (left upper). Oxidative stress reduces the levels of p-AMPK (phosphorylated-AMPK)
  most likely by inhibiting the protein kinase, LKB1 that is known to phosphorylate
  AMPK. Down-regulation of p-AMPK reduces the level and activation of SIRT1, which
  in turn reduces PGC-1α. As a result, expression of genes down-stream from PGC-1α
  is down-regulated disrupting energy homeostasis. Down-regulation of p-AMPK levels
  also stimulates PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), which in turn activates Akt.
  The activation of Akt leads to the phosphorylation and activation of mTOR (mammalian
  target of rapamycin) that is known to phosphorylate S6K1 (ribosomal S6 protein kinase
  1). Increased p-S6K1 levels inversely correlates with lifespan (). RSV, an SIRT1-activator
  and an antioxidant polyphenol, not only reduces oxidative stress but also increases
  p-AMPK levels most likely by stimulating LKB1. Thus, RSV stimulates the PGC-1α level
  that increases the expression of genes down-stream of PGC-1α. Activated SIRT1 may
  also enhance p-AMPK levels. By increasing the p-AMPK levels, RSV also suppresses
  activation of PI3K/Akt pathway of mTOR activation, which decreases the p-S6K1 levels,
  thereby increasing lifespan. Therefore, by stimulating p-AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling
  pathway and suppressing p-S6K1 levels, RSV improves energy homeostasis in neurons
  and in other cell types in the Ppt1-KO mice and causes a small increase in lifespan.
  As suggested by the results obtained from INCL fibroblasts, RSV may have similar
  beneficial effects on INCL patients.
