caption: Spatial-temporal signals determine the fate of activated CD8+ T cells. The
  balance between TLR-induced proinflammatory and apoptotic signals via STAT1 pathways
  in activating DCs and subsequent induction of negative feedback loops that initiate
  anti-inflammatory signals via the STAT3 axis define the narrow window of DC competency
  for polarizing CD4+ Th1 responses and cross-presentation of antigen to CD8+ T cells.
  TCR recognition of pMHC results in rapid down-regulation of CD62L, SIP1, and IL-7R,
  up-regulation of activation markers, and acquisition of effector function. During
  the next 3 to 4 days, Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ T cells proliferate in response to autocrine
  and paracrine IL-2, produce IFN-γ, and up-regulate CTLA-4. CTLA-4 ligation on DCs
  leads to indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) up-regulation, Foxo3-mediated inhibition
  of IL-6 production, and a shift from competency to induction of regulatory T cells,
  anergy, and cell death. This is the cue for activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to egress
  from secondary lymphoid organs. Foxo1 and KLF2 transcription factors, regulated
  by posttranscriptional modifications, coordinate renewed expression of the IL-7R,
  CD62L, CCR7, and S1P1, and down-regulate inflammatory chemokine receptors, respectively,
  on cells destined to become T central memory (Tcm) cells. In contrast, both IL-2
  and IL-4 suppress Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) expression and signals transmitted
  through IL-4R/ STAT6 up-regulate Eomes which induces expression of CXCR3 on CD8+
  T cells. Survival after cytokine deprivation is dependent on costimulatory and other
  survival signals received before egress from lymphoid tissue. Limiting growth factors
  cause activated T cells to shutdown growth and proliferative programs sustained
  through TCR/CD28, and IL-2 and the P13K/AKT/mTOR pathway and to up-regulate autophagy
  pathways during transit into nonactivated lymphoid tissue and tissue niches. Here,
  T central memory (Tcm) and T effector memory (Tem) cell populations become dependent
  upon cytokine and tissue-specific interactions for maintenance and homeostasis.
  CD8+ T cells that receive CD4-proficient help in T cell–rich zones of draining lymph
  nodes may be more destined for long-term survival. The balance between costimulatory
  signals that up-regulate antiapoptotic factors, and negative costimulatory molecules
  up-regulated during the effector phase such as CTLA-4, BTLA-4, and PD1 (during chronic
  stimulation) that block effector function ultimately determine the population of
  cells that survive and transit into the memory pool. Expression of CD8+ effector
  function is regulated by 2 T box–binding transcription factors, Tbet and eomesodermin
  (Eomes). Although both Tbet and Eomes are essential inducers of CD8+ T-cell IFN-γ,
  perforin, granzyme B, and cytolytic capability, how these 2 transcription factors
  are coordinately regulated to control effector function and transition to long-term
  memory is unclear. During the inductive phase of the immune response, IL-12 and
  IFN-γ drive the differentiation and expansion of CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ T effector cells.
  This is reflected in the levels of T-bet expression and secreted osteopontin. During
  late-stage effector differentiation, inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2), an antagonist
  of E protein transcription factors is up-regulated by CD8+ T cells and maintained
  in effector memory cells. E proteins are basic helix-loop-helix family of transcriptional
  activators and repressors, which bind specifically to DNA sequences containing the
  E-box consensus sequence. E protein homodimers regulate a complex array of genes
  during T-cell differentiation including expression of CD127 and CD27. Members of
  helix-loop-helix (HLH) protein family of Id (inhibitor of differentiation) dimerize
  with bHLH transcription factors and function as negative regulators of differentiation
  and promote progression of cells into S phase. E-Id2 heterodimer formation leads
  to diminished E-box–mediated gene expression such as Ctla4 and Bcl2l11 (BimEL) associated
  with reduced survival of T effector cells and relieves E protein repression of Serpinb9
  coding for the serine protease inhibitor (Spi-6) thought to protect cytolytic effector
  cells from programmed cell death. Thus, Id-2 regulates the size of the Tem (CD62Llow,
  CD122lowCD127lowCD27high) subset in addition to regulating the survival of effector
  CD8+ T cells. Understanding transcriptional programs that control proliferation,
  acquisition of effector function, and survival of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during the
  immune response will be key to developing new vaccine strategies.
