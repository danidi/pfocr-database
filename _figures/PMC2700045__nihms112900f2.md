caption: Genetic lesions resulting in TR cell deficiency/dysfunction and autoimmunity.
  A. Activation of effector T (Teff) cells by antigen presenting cells (APC) triggers
  Teff cell activation and IL-2 production. Signaling by the IL-2 /IL-2 receptor (IL-2R)/STAT5
  pathway is essential for the competency of TR cells and helps maintain high level
  expression of Foxp3. It enables the suppression by TR cells of both APC and Teff
  cell function. X denotes genetic defects associated with IPEX (Foxp3) and IPEX-like
  syndromes (IL-2Rα chain and STAT5b).
