caption: Angiotensins in the RAS. (A) Schematic of the RAS pathway. In the vasoconstrictive
  arm, Ang I is cleaved from angiotensinogen (AGT) by renin. Ang II is produced from
  Ang I by ACE. Ang II acts as a vasoconstrictor while ACE-2 cleavage of AGT and in
  turn the eventual production of Ang (1-7) works to vasodilate and oppose the actions
  of Ang II. Ang=angiotensin; AP-A=aminopeptidase-A; AP-N=aminopeptidase-N; DAP=dipeptidyl
  aminopeptidase. Not all intermediary metabolites and enzymes are shown. (B) Schematic
  of angiotensins (including their amino acid composition) derived from the cleavage
  of the decapeptide Ang I at various amino acid positions. Adapted from [,].
