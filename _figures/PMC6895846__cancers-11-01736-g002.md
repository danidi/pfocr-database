caption: ADAM17 is a membrane-bound metalloprotease, which cleaves more than 80 substrates
  [,]. Major substrates of ADAM17 are IL-6R, TNFα, and ligands of the EGF-R. Cleavage
  of the IL-6R is a prerequisite of the pro-inflammatory IL-6 trans-signaling pathway
  via the sIL-6R. Cleavage of TNFα and the formation of soluble TNFα (sTNFα) leads
  to the stimulation of the pro-inflammatory TNFα receptor 1 (TNF-RI). Cleavage of
  ligands of the EGF-R is needed for the systemic activity of the ligands and therefore
  for the full stimulation of the EGF-R [].
