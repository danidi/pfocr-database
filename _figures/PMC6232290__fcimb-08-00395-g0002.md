caption: IL-13 signaling mechanisms and associated host directed targets in the treatment
  of ulcerative colitis. IL-13 signals through the type II (IL-4Rα and IL-13Rα1) receptor
  complex and activates the JAK1/STAT6 pathway. In addition, IL-13 has also been shown
  to signal through IL-13Rα2, activating AP-1 to induce the secretion of TGF-β. This
  pathway is, in part dependent on the production of TNFα. Various drug targets have
  been directed at IL-13 including the IL-4Rα signaling pathway to block the immune
  response that mediate Th2-driven inflammatory diseases such as allergy and colitis.
  Drug treatments that were beneficial or improved disease outcome are depicted in
  green and treatments that were unsuccessful or exacerbated disease outcome are depicted
  in red (Rutgeerts et al., ; Wenzel et al., ; Levin and Shibolet, ; Reinisch et al.,
  , ; Mannon and Reinisch, ; Sandborn et al., ; Verma et al., ; Colombel et al., ;
