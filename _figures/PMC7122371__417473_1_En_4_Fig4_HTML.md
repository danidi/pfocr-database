caption: Activation of coronavirus spike proteins by host cell proteases occurs at
  different stages in the viral life cycle. Binding of the viral spike (S) protein
  to a cellular receptor can induce endocytosis of virions. In the endosome, the pH-dependent
  cysteine protease cathepsin L (CatL) can activate the S protein for fusion within
  the endosomal membrane. Alternatively, receptor binding may expose a protease cleavage
  site and may thus promote S protein activation at the plasma membrane by type II
  transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) or furin. Membrane fusion allows the release
  of the viral genome into the cytoplasm, the site of viral genome replication and
  protein translation. The S protein is synthesized in the constitutive secretory
  pathway, where some S proteins can be cleaved by furin or other pro-protein convertases
  during passage through the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Finally, nascent virions are
  assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi intermediate compartment and are released
  from infected cells through exocytosis
