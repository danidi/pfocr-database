caption: Schematic diagram of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. a In the absence of
  Shh or unstimulated cells, the activity of the transmembrane protein Smo is suppressed
  by the Hedgehog receptor Ptch. b Binding of Shh to Ptch results in the removal of
  the inhibitory effect on Smo and consequently activating Smo. Smo then transduces
  the Shh signal into the cytoplasm. Transduction of the Shh signal into the cytoplasm
  leads to activation of the Glioblastoma (Gli) family of transcription factors and
  activation of downstream targets such as Wnt, Snail, and H+,K+-ATPase
