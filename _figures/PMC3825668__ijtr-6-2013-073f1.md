caption: 'The de novo pathway for the semi-vitamin nicotinamide is also the immune
  tolerance pathway, and is closely connected to serotonin synthesis and social signaling.
  This may be a homeostatic circuit that supports energy and nicotinamide/tryptophan
  acquisition, and responsive internal solutions such as autophagy and symbionts that
  supply nicotinamide and NAD(H), or, pseudo-symbionts such as cancer that sink nicotinamide
  excesses, as do metabolic and inflammatory syndromes, but they lead to longer term
  toxicity.Abbreviations: SIRTs, sirtuins; PARPs, poly(ADP ribose polymerase); cADP,
  cyclic adenosine diphosphate; ARTs, T-cell ADP ribosyl-transferase; NNMT, nicotinamide-N-methyl-transferase.'
