caption: A proposed model for regulation of floral organ abscission by JA and ethylene.
  JA and ethylene can regulate floral organ abscission in independent and inter-dependent
  manners. JA and ethylene act independently to control the timing of abscission (left).
  Inter-dependent regulation of JA and ethylene is mediated in the downstream signaling
  of the ethylene receptor, ETR1 (right). The model predicts that when JA levels are
  low and EIN2 activity is eliminated in Arabidopsis, there is an EIN2-independent
  component (Xs) or signaling pathway (dotted line) that is inhibited by JA or DAB4/COI1SCF.
