caption: Improvement of local pathways in GenMAPP. This figure represent a Transcription
  Growth Factor Beta (TGF-B) signaling pathway that was improved after applying our
  new annotation methods for both the Incyte (left) and Agilent (right) arrays. Genes
  visualized using the RefSeq annotation could again be visualized with the new annotation
  (green box), whereas the new annotation added a large amount of genes that can be
  used for visualization purposes (red box). Additionally, the RefSeq approach found
  some genes which our approach was unable to find (purple box). Boxes with more than
  one color indicate that that gene is covered on the array by multiple reporters.
