caption: When β-carotene is cleaved symmetrically by the action of the 15,15’-oxygenase
  enzyme (CMOI) two molecules of retinaldehyde are produced. Retinaldehyde can then
  be oxidized to form retinoic acid or can be reduced to retinol, which is further
  converted into retinyl ester, the storage form of vitamin A in tissues. In vivo,
  95% of retinoids arising from β-carotene are produced by this pathway. However,
  β-carotene can also be cleaved asymmetrically by the action of 9’,10’-oxygenase
  enzyme (CMOII) producing apocarotenals, which can be converted to retinaldehyde
  by chain shortening. Through this pathway, one molecule of β-carotene yields one
  molecule of retinaldehyde. Interestingly, Ziouzienkova and colleagues [] showed
  that apocarotenals may also function as ligands for PPAR and RXR receptors, inhibiting
  vitamin A signaling.
