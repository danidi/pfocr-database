caption: 'Key organelles and proteins involved in cellular Cu homeostasis. (Left)
  Cu enters cells through the Cu-specific transporter CTR1. Intracellular Cu is buffered
  by metallothioneins. Designated Cu chaperones deliver Cu to specific cuproenzymes
  in their respective organelles. Cox17 delivers Cu to COX in mitochondria. SOD1 is
  the only cytosolic cuproenzyme and receives Cu through CCS. Atox-1 delivers Cu to
  an ATPase (ATP7A or ATP7B) that transport Cu into the secretory pathway (Right).
  Cu is present in secretory granules along with cuproenzymes like DβM, extracellular
  SOD3 and PAM. Based on the localization of ATP7A and ATP7B, Cu is also present in
  constitutive vesicles and in endocytic compartments. APP and BDNF are also part
  of the secretory pathway in neurons (see ,). Abbreviations: APP, amyloid precursor
  protein; Atox-1, antioxidant-1 (a.k.a. HAH1); ATP7A, Menkes disease protein; CCS,
  Cu chaperone for SOD1; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; Cox17, Cu chaperone for COX; CTR1,
  Cu transporter 1; DβM, dopamine β-monooxygenase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LDCV,
  large dense-core vesicle; PAM, peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase; SOD1,
  superoxide dismutase 1; SOD3, superoxide dismutase 3; TGN, trans Golgi network.'
