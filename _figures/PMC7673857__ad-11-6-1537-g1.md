caption: Schematic model of the main source of ROS and redox reaction. ROS are generated
  mainly from enzymatic reactions in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria,
  and peroxisome []. Specifically, overproduced mitoROS can affect metabolic pathways,
  such as alteration of protein translation, oxidation of lipid and DNA, and impairment
  of ATP synthesis []. Moreover, assembled NOX (NOX1 and NOX2) complex transports
  an electron from cytosolic NADPH to oxygen to form superoxide on the extracellular
  side []. The NOX4 complex rapidly converts the superoxide to H2O2, which undergoes
  a Fenton reaction to produce hydroxyl radicals and ions, and to regulate many downstream
  effects []. However, these oxidative events are inhibited by antioxidants, such
  as SOD and CAT/GPx. Activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway increases antioxidants, such
  as HO-1, SOD1, and CAT to protect cells from FR accumulation [].
