caption: 'Data analysis workflow. Protein quantification data were from ultra-definition
  MSE, and proteins with two or more unique peptides were approved for identification.
  ANOVA cut-off of 0.05 was used. PCA: principal component analysis is used to visualise
  the variation between groups. OPLS–DA: latent structures discriminant analysis brings
  data for the S-plot for an efficient comparison of protein expression profiles.
  PPI: protein–protein interaction network gives the known and predicted functional
  and physical associations between single proteins in the S-plot. IPA: Ingenuity
  pathway analysis is an analysis tool revealing pathways and potential networks associated
  with the given data'
