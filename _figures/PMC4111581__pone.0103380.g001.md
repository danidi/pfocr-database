caption: 2-OG, produced from isocitrate in the TCA cycle, can be used by all cyanobacteria
  as backbone to incorporate ammonium, through the GS/GOGAT pathway. Alternatively,
  the majority of cyanobacteria can transform 2-OG to succinic semialdehyde, and later
  to succinate, through reactions catalyzed by 2-OG decarboxylase (2-OGDC) and succinic
  semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH), respectively . These reactions (shown in grey)
  are missing in marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus strains.
