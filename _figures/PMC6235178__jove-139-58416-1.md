caption: Using a similar approach, we recently developed a new LATS-BS by fusing NLuc
  to 15 aa of YAP surrounding the LATS phosphorylation site at S127 (YAP15) and CLuc
  with 14-3-3. The full-length YAP protein was not used, to avoid confounding signals
  by post-translational modifications of YAP (e.g., phosphorylation at other sites
  and ubiquitination) by other upstream regulators. The LATS-BS presented here can
  non-invasively monitor Hippo signaling activity both in vitro in living cells and
  in vivo in mice (). Here, we describe a detailed protocol for measuring LATS kinase
  activity in vitro using the LATS-BS. First, we show how the LATS-BS can be used
  to investigate the effect of an overexpressed protein on LATS activity. Then, we
  show how the biosensor can be used to monitor the activity of the Hippo pathway
  after treatment with agents regulating the Hippo pathway. This protocol could be
  used to identify and characterize signaling pathways or stimuli regulating LATS
  kinase activity.
