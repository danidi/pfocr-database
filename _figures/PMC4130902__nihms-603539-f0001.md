caption: A model for Hh signaling in the absence (left) or presence (right) of Shh.
  In the absence of Hh ligands, PKA phosphorylates the Gli proteins (red circles)
  and initiates their processing to repressor forms (GliR) in a cilia-dependent manner.
  Gli3R suppresses target genes upon nuclear translocation. Upon binding of Shh with
  Ptch1, Ptch1 is removed from cilia, and Smo activation results in its accumulation
  in cilia and the consequent decrease in PKA activity towards the Gli proteins. The
  recently described Efcab7-Iqce module anchors the Evc-Evc2 complex in a signaling
  microdomain at the base of cilia, transducing downstream signals for Smo-dependent
  Gli2 activation [, ]. Recent results with Efcab1/Iqce knockouts not inhibiting Gli3
  processing but preventing Shh pathway activation [], and the Shh-dependent removal
  of Gpr161 from cilia () [] strongly suggest that the inhibition of Gli3 processing
  is uncoupled from Gli2 activation downstream of Smo. Gli proteins traffic through
  the cilia in a Gli-Sufu complex, and activation by Shh results in dissociation of
  Gli from SuFu, allowing them to enter the nucleus and activated target genes.
