caption: Model of mitochondrial fission induced by the activation of the non-canonical
  Wnt signaling pathway in dendritic spines. Mitochondrial dynamics. Wnt5a ligand
  binds to its Fz receptor and activates the Wnt/Ca2+signaling pathway to promote
  mitochondrial fission in the postsynaptic area. Wnt5a increases intracellular Ca2+,
  following the activation of kinases (PKC and CaMKII) and phosphatases (calcineurin),
  which in turn activates Drp1 through the regulation of its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
  states. Drp1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial surface to induce
  mitochondrial fission. Mitochondrial movement. The importance of the dendritic distribution
  of mitochondria in the generation of new spines and synaptic plasticity has been
  established. Once Drp1 is activated and induces mitochondrial fission, new mitochondria
  could mobilize to dendritic spines to support the energy demands associated with
  neural activity.
