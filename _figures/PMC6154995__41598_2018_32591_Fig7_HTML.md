caption: 'Heme-dependent feedback inhibition of ALAS in the heme biosynthetic pathway.
  (A) In the mammal cells, heme primarily regulates ALAS1 by inhibiting its mRNA expression
  and translation and by blocking the translocation of ALAS1 precursor protein into
  the mitochondria. Heme promotes the degradation of ALAS1 protein in mitochondria.
  (B) The heme biosynthesis in C. crescentus is negatively regulated via inactivation
  of cALAS by direct heme binding, where the excess free heme directly binds to each
  subunit of cALAS homodimer in one-to-one stoichiometry to releases an essential
  coenzyme PLP and is inactivated quickly, thus providing a mechanism for bacteria
  to react to the toxic unbound tetrapyrrole products. Abbreviations: PBG; porphobilinogen,
  HMB; hydroxymethylbilane, URO III; uroporphyrinogen III, CPP III; coproporphyrinogen
  III, CPPIX; coproporphyrinogen IX, PPIX; protoporphyrinogen IX, PBGS; porphobilinogen
