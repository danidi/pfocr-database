caption: In healthy ISCs and enterocytes, the Hpo Wts kinase cascade (homologous to
  the MST LATS kinase cascade in mammals) suppresses Yki activity. Upon intestinal
  damage Wts is inactivated, in part by JNK signalling, resulting in Yki activation.
  Yki activation in enterocytes leads to expression and secretion of Upd protein,
  a Jak Stat ligand, and Egfr ligands, which promote non-autonomous ISC proliferation
  in a paracrine manner. Yki activation in ISCs results in expression of cyclin E1,
  bantam and diap1, promoting autonomous ISC proliferation and survival. In enteroblasts,
  Msn activates Wts in a Hpo-independent manner, and therefore negatively regulates
  Yki. Egfr, epidermal growth factor receptor; Hpo, Hippo; ISC, intestinal stem cell;
  LATS, large tumour suppressor; Msn, misshapen; MST, mammalian ste20-like kinase;
  Upd, unpaired; Wts, warts; Yki, transcriptional co-activator yorkie.
