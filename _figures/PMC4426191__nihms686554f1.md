caption: Signaling pathways activated by opioid receptor agonists in the enteric nervous
  system. μ- and δ-opioid receptors couple to inhibition of adenylate cyclase via
  the inhibitory G-protein, Gi. These receptors also couple to activation of K+ channels
  and inhibition of Ca2+ channels via a Go-linked pathway. These mechanisms suppress
  enteric neuronal activity. κ-Opioid receptors link to inhibition of Ca2+ channels
  on enteric nerve terminals. This would inhibit neurotransmitter release. These pathways
  contribute to the constipating effects caused by opioid receptor agonists. cAMP,
  cyclic 3′,5′ adenosine monophosphate; PKA, protein kinase A.
