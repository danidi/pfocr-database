caption: Scheme for poly P role in the mTOR signaling pathway. Only the portions of
  the known pathways relevant to the results presented in this work are shown. Poly
  P is proposed to act as a cofactor in the insulin and amino acid activation of mTOR
  function. Other aspects are discussed in the text. See ref.  for a recent review
  on TOR.
