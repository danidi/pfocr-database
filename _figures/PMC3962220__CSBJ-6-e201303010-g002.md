caption: The ATF6 pathway. The sensor molecule pATF6(P) located on the ER membrane
  is transported to the Golgi apparatus by transport vesicles in response to ER stress.
  In the Golgi apparatus, pATF6(P) is sequentially cleaved by two proteases, S1P and
  S2P, resulting in release of the cytoplasmic portion pATF6(N) from the ER membrane.
  pATF6(N) translocates into the nucleus and activates transcription of ER chaperone
  genes through binding to the cis-acting enhancer ERSE.
