caption: Proposed mechanisms of HK-mediated Ca2+signaling in endothelial cells. The
  binding of HK (domains 3 and 5) to cytokeratin 1 (CK1), urokinase plasminogen activator
  receptor (uPAR) and complement C1q receptor (gC1qR) on endothelial cells is well
  established. Our novel findings suggest that in addition to these proteins, HK (through
  its BK sequence in domain 4) directly interacts with BK B2 (B2) receptors to regulate
  endothelial cell functions. HK-mediated stimulation of Gq-coupled B2 receptors on
  endothelial cells triggers the activation of PLC-IP3-DAG second messenger signaling
  pathway. IP3 acts on IP3 receptors (IP3-R) on the endoplasmic reticular (ER) membrane
  leading to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ from the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ pool.
  An increase in [Ca2+]i activates eNOS and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to NO and PGI2
  production, respectively. The known inhibitors of B2 receptor signaling pathway
  block NO and PGI2 formation by uncoupling the upstream signaling steps involved
  in the synthesis of these mediators. Endothelial cell activation in response to
  HK also involves extracellular Ca2+ influx into cells, mainly through B2 receptor-operated
  (ROC) and/or store-operated (SOC) Ca2+ channels. Gd3+, a stretch-activated Ca2+
  channel inhibitor and verapamil, a L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channel inhibitor,
  potentiate the HK-mediated increase in [Ca2+]i through a yet unidentified mechanism
  (?). The increase in [Ca2+]i in response to HK activates Ca2+-activated Cl− channels
  (ClCa), and the inhibition of these channels is associated with a decrease in HK-induced
  rise in [Ca2+]i.
