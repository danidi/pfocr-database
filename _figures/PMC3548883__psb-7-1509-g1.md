caption: Figure 1. Nutrient uptake via the direct pathway (DP) or mycorrhizal pathway
  (MP) in mycorrhizal roots. High affinity nutrient uptake transporters of the DP
  are downregulated in mycorrhizal roots (dotted line), and instead mycorrhiza-inducible
  transporters of the MP are expressed at the mycorrhizal interface. The ERM takes
  up inorganic N from the soil/fungal interface and N is assimilated and converted
  into arginine via glutamine synthetase (GS), carbamoyl-phosphate synthase glutamine
  chain (CPS), argininosuccinate synthase (ASS), and argininosuccinate lyase (AL).
  The basic amino acid arginine (Arg) acts as charge balance and is co-transported
  to the IRM with negatively charged polyphosphates (polyP) that are synthesized in
  the ERM from P taken up from the soil. PolyP are remobilized in the IRM and release
  inorganic P (PI) and Arg, which is re-converted into NH4+ via the catabolic arm
  of the urea cycle and the activity of a fungal arginase (ARG) and urease (URE).
  Plants transfer sucrose into the interfacial apoplast, which is hydrolyzed by the
  activity of a plant invertase (INV) into hexoses. The carbon supply of the host
  stimulates N and P uptake and transport via the MP in the AM symbiosis (hatched
  line). The supply of a carbon source (acetate) independent from the C supply of
  the host reduces N transport in the AM symbiosis.
