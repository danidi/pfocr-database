caption: Rice immunity and symbiotic signaling pathways triggered by microorganism
  signatures. In immune signaling, OsCEBiP directly binds to chitin and forms a receptor
  complex with OsCERK1 to transduce an immune response. OsCERK1-dependent phosphorylation
  of OsRacGEF1 leads to the activation of the small GTPase OsRac1 at the plasma membrane.
  OsRac1 activates the transcription factor RAI1 via the MAPK pathway, including OsMPK3/4
  and MKK4. In addition, OsRac1 directly binds to the N-terminus of OsRbohB to regulate
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The kinase domain of OsCERK1 also phosphorylates
  the cytoplasmic receptor-like kinase OsRLCK185/176 and phosphorylated RLCK185/176
  activates the MAPK cascade. In symbiosis signaling, unknown receptors recognize
  Myc-LCO or CO4/5. OsCERK1 may transduce the extracellular signals to the cytoplasmic
  region. In the rice genome, CASTOR, POLLUX, CYCLOPS, and CCaMK are highly conserved.
  All four proteins in rice may contribute to the symbiosis pathway.
