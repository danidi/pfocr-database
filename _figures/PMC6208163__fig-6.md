caption: NRF2 protects cells from ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell
  death inducible by FIN compounds. These compounds induce ferroptosis by directly
  or indirectly inhibiting GPX4 activities, causing cellular lipid peroxide accumulation
  and subsequent oxidative cell death. NRF2 protects cells from ferroptosis by increasing
  cellular glutathione production. NRF2 promotes glutathione synthesis by increasing
  expression of genes directly involved in the glutathione biosynthetic pathway. NRF2
  also promotes the expression of SLC7A11, which increases intracellular cysteine
  pools, resulting in increased intracellular glutathione level. GPX4, which is the
  primary regulator of ferroptosis, is also an NRF2 target gene. NRF2 also regulates
  cellular iron availability by promoting the expression of ferritin (FTL and FTH1),
  which reduces the labile iron pool and thus protects cells against ferroptosis.
  Other NRF2 target genes, such as MT-1G and HMOX-1, have been shown to regulate ferroptosis.
