caption: 'Hippo pathway signaling in Drosophila and mammals.Note: (A) Signaling diagram.
  Corresponding proteins in Drosophila and mammals are indicated by matching colors
  and shapes. Direct biochemical interactions are indicated by solid lines or drawn
  as proteins in direct contact with each other. Dashed lines indicate genetic interactions
  for which no direct protein-protein interactions have been reported. Arrowed or
  blunted ends indicate activation or inhibition, respectively. Also shown are selected
  target genes. Yki- or YAP/TAZ-interacting transcription factors other than Sd (Drosophila)
  or TEAD (mammals) are collectively listed in a box. Adapted from Dev. Cell, 19(4),
