caption: '(A) DC map of modules enriched with KEGG pathways. Nodes represent gene
  modules and edges correspond to DC (blue for increased correlation in AD, red for
  decreased correlation). Node size is proportional to the size of the module. The
  enriched pathways are noted on the module. NDD pathways refer to Parkinson''s disease
  (PD), Huntington''s disease, Alzheimer''s disease and oxidative phosphorylation.
  CAMs refer to the cell adhesion molecules pathway. (B) Analysis of DC between the
  PD and the NDD modules (the circled sub-graph in A). Left: the known interactions
  involving the genes of the two modules according to GENEMANIA. Most known interactions
  are between the modules. Right: co-expression networks of the same genes for AD
  patients and controls. Rectangular nodes are genes related to oxidoreductase activity,
  hexagons indicate genes related to phosphate metabolic process. An edge between
  two genes indicates correlation >0.3 in the tested class. The average correlation
  between the modules was 0.3 in the controls and 0 in the AD class. Node colors indicate
  the DE between case and control, measured by the base-10 logarithm of the p-value
  (t-test) of the tested gene. The genes circled in the NDD pathway module are also
  part of the PD pathway. These genes are also down-correlated in AD, whereas all
  other genes show only mild DE.'
