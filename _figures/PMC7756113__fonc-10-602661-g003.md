caption: The mechanism of autophagy. Autophagy is a degradation process that involves
  the formation of double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. Canonical signaling
  pathways, such as activation of the nutrient deprivation sensor AMP-activated protein
  kinase (AMPK) or inhibition of the nutrient-full sensor mechanistic target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) activate autophagy-related protein 1 (ATG1) kinase by phosphorylation. This
  in turns phosphorylates the Beclin 1 (BECN1) protein, allowing formation of a PtdIns3K
  complex that phosphorylates the phosphatidylinositol of intracellular membranes.
  Formation of the autophagosomes implicates the elongation of the membranes and their
  decoration with LC3 molecules, a process that is assisted by the ATG5 protein. The
  material targeted for degradation (i.e. proteins and organelles) arrives to the
  elongating membrane of the autophagosome through “receptors”, like SQSTM1/p62, which
  binds polyubiquitinated proteins. Once the autophagosome is formed, it fuses with
  a lysosome that contains hydrolytic enzymes, leading to the degradation of the material
  enclosed within the autophagosome. The NFκB pathway is involved in transcriptional
  up-regulation of autophagy proteins such as BECN1, LC3 and ATG5, thereby promoting
  autophagy.
