caption: In T2 DM rats, where the Hepatic Glucokinase (HGK) is lower, the level of
  lncRNA NONRATT021972 is increased. These rats, when treated with siRNA NONRATT021972,
  leads to decrease in the p-GSK 3β protein and reduction in hyperglycemia whereas
  increase in p-AKT1 and Glucokinase (GK) expression. These are regulated by (PKB/AKT)
  signaling pathway activation and results in the improvement in the dysfunction of
  HGK.
