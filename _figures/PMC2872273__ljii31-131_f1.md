caption: 'Cancer Elevates FDP Levels Through Two Pathways: Coagulation and Fibrinolysis.
  The AMDL-ELISA DR-70® (FDP) test measures the FDP produced by multiple pathways,
  unlike other FDP assays which only measure one pathway or one pathway product. Researchers
  have established that cancer causes elevated levels of both urokinase-type plasminogen
  activator (u-PA)[–] and tissue factor (TF).[–] Both the u-PA and TF pathways effect
  the production of FDP in cancer cells. The u-PA pathway (1A and 1B) activates plasmin
  by transforming plasminogen, the inactive precursor of plasmin, into functional
  plasmin.[–] The TF pathway (2) alters the extrinsic coagulation system causing an
  activation of thrombin.[–] Thrombin (3) converts Fibrinogen to Fibrin.[] The type
  of FDP produced will be different depending upon which of the two substrates is
  digested by plasmin. When fibrinogen is the substrate for plasmin (4), fragments
  D and E are the end products with fragments X and Y as intermediate products in
  this digestion. When fibrin is the substrate of plasmin (5), D-dimer is the end
  product. As a result of either pathway (4) or (5), cancer will cause an elevation
  in FDP levels as measured by the DR-70 (FDP). Tests that measure only one of the
  individual FDP species, i.e., D-dimer tests, will miss up to half of the FDP generated
  as a result of cancer physiology. (Figure is provided in color online.)'
