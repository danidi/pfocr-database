caption: Bile acids enrich both hepatic and gallbladder bile. Sterols undergo micellar
  solubilization in the intestinal lumen, and uptake occurs at the enterocyte brush
  border. The NPC1L1, located at the apical membrane of the enterocytes, governs the
  active uptake of cholesterol and plant sterols across the brush border membrane
  of the enterocytes. Ezetimibe specifically inhibits the NPC1L1 pathway. The ATP-binding
  cassette transporters ABCG5/G8, also located at the enterocyte brush border, promote
  the active efflux of cholesterol and plant sterols from the enterocytes into the
  intestinal lumen for fecal excretion. In the enterocyte, new synthesis of cholesterol
  occurs from acetate (by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, or HMGCR). The
  esterification of intracellular cholesterol requires the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase
  isoform 2 (ACAT2). Chylomicrons are assembled following triacylglycerol (TG) and
  phospholipid (PL) synthesis, steps requiring facilitated transport of fatty acids
  (FAs) and monoacylglycerol (MG) into the enterocytes, which include their FA binding
  protein 4 (FABP4)-mediated transport into the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. This
  step is followed by synthesis of diacylglycerol (DG) and TG, whereas PL synthesis
  is dependent on glucose transport into the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and synthesis
  of α-glycerophosphate (α-GP) and phosphatidic acid (PA). Apolipoprotein (APO)-B48
  and activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) are required for
  assembly of chylomicrons before their secretion into the lymph. Thus, final chylomicron
  particles contain a core of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters surrounded by a
  surface enriched with PLs (mainly phosphatidylcholine), unesterified cholesterol,
  and apolipoproteins, including A-I, A-II, A-IV, B-48, C-I, and C-III. APO C-II and
  APO-E are acquired when the chylomicrons enter the circulation , , . Adapted from
