caption: 'Inhibition of LINE-1 retrotransposition by the SLX4com prevents pro-inflammatory
  signaling. (A) The SLX4com inhibits LINE-1 retrotransposition by preventing accumulation
  of reverse transcribed LINE-1 DNA. LINE-1-derived DNA are likely subsequently degraded.
  (B) In the absence of the SLX4com, by-products of LINE-1 reverse-transcription accumulate
  in the cytoplasm. These are recognized by the cGAS-STING pathway to activate pro-inflammatory
  signaling. Grey lines represents: LINE-1 RNA; green lines: LINE-1 reverse-transcribed
  DNA.'
