caption: The direct and indirect recognition pathways of islet allograft destruction.
  After transplantation, islet-resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from the donor
  graft can present directly to host T cells with stimulatory signals provided by
  reactive oxygen species, such as , •OH, and H2O2 to promote the expansion and activation
  of alloreactive cytotoxic T cell subsets. This stimulation can then activate inducible
  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), NAD(P)H oxidase, and mitochondrial oxidative pathways
  within the T cell to produce more nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide,
  eventually leading to cellular rejection via the direct pathway (A). Alternatively,
  islet antigens can be shed into the surrounding environment following transplantation
  to be engulfed and presented by host APCs and then indirectly presented to host
  T cells. Through co-stimulation and the release of , •OH, H2O2, and NO, those APCs
  promote a classical antibody response involving the activation and expansion of
  alloreactive T cells and humoral rejection (B).
