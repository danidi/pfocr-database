caption: 'Pathways of PHB metabolism and fatty acid degradation in M. extorquens AM1
  and their connection to methylotrophy. Enzymes of the fatty acid degradation pathway:
  1, crotonyl-CoA reductase; 2, l-crotonase; 3, NADH-linked acetoacetyl-CoA reductase;
  4, d-crotonase. Enzymes of PHB synthesis and degradation: 5, β-ketothiolase; 6,
  NADPH-linked acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; 7, PHB synthase; 8, PHB depolymerase; 9,
  β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; 10, acetoacetate–succinyl-CoA transferase. Dotted
  lines reflect enzymes not yet known or detected.'
