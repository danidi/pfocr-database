caption: Activation of α7 nAChR by PNU-282987 improves synaptic and cognitive functions
  through restoring the expression of synaptic-associated proteins and the CaM-CaMKII-CREB
  signaling pathway. Synapses are the basic structure for the connection between neurons,
  and the function of a synapse is largely associated with synaptic-associated proteins.
  The present study found that activation of α7 nAChRs by PNU-282987 could largely
  restore the expression level of synaptic-associated proteins, including SYN, PSD95,
  SNAP25, DYN1 and AP180, which are downregulated by deposition of Aβ. α7 nAChRs belong
  to the ligand-gated ion channel coupled receptors, and form an ion channel in the
  center, which mainly regulates the flow of Ca2+ plasma inside and outside the cell.
  As a second cytoplasmic messenger, Ca2+ can flow into the cells through α7 nAChRs
  and bind to CaM to form an active CaM complex. The CaM complex can bind to CaMKII,
  which changes the CaMKII spatial conformation and phosphorylates CaMKII protein.
  Phosphorylated CaMKII enters the nucleus to catalyze CREB phosphorylation. CREB
  is located downstream of the α7 nAChR signal transduction pathway and acts as a
  transcription factor that regulates the growth and development of neurons and the
  formation of long-term memory.
