caption: Lipid remodeling pathways in mammals, yeast and T. cruzi. “R” represents
  the entire glycan structure of each GPI anchor precursor linked to a protein. Although
  this assumption has been validated in mammals (top panel) and yeast (middle panel),
  no such experimental data are available for T. cruzi (bottom panel). Each step (in
  parentheses) has corresponding entries in .
