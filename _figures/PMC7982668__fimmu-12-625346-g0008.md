caption: A hypothetical scheme of the role of AhR and AhRR in breast cancer development.
  AhR agonists like kynurenine (Kyn) are produced in the tumor microenvironment and
  activate AhR in cells of the tumor microenvironment including stromal and inflammatory
  cells or the tumor cells themselves. Activation of the PKA pathway and the increased
  expression of inflammatory mediators such as C/EBPβ and COX-2 contribute to mammary
  cell transformation and increased cell proliferation. The activated AhR pathway
  can also induce the activity of the immune-regulatory enzymes IDO and TDO, which
  metabolize tryptophan into the endogenous AhR ligand Kyn in a positive feedback
  loop. AhRR may function as an inhibitor of the tumor promoting mechanisms triggered
  by AhR in the tumor microenvironment. IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; TDO, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase;
  PKA, protein kinase A; Kyn, kynurenine.
