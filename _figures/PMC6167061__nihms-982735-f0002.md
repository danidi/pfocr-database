caption: (A, B) Intracellular pharmacological chaperoning and matchmaking of G protein-coupled
  receptors (GPCRs) and downstream effects. (A) The conventional outside-in assumptions
  that GPCR antagonists manipulate second messengers and kinase cascades, resulting
  in gene activation. The diagram includes receptor trafficking in the late exocytotic/endocytotic
  pathway and signaling by p-arrestin. The diagram omits known facts about homodimerization
  and heterodimerization of GPCRs. (B) The inside-out view. Intracellular pharmacological
  chaperoning and matchmaking of GPCR and downstream effects, including reduction
  of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and suppression of unfolded protein response.
