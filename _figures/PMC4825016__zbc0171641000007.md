caption: Proposed model for cross-talk of IGF1 and integrin signaling. A, regulation
  of IGF1 signaling via integrin signaling-associated molecules. In the presence of
  a mechanical stimulus, IGF-1R undergoes integrin-dependent activation and phosphorylation
  of downstream targets AKT and ERK. Integrins can potentiate ligand-induced IGF1
  signaling via SRC-mediated AKT and ERK activation or through FAK-mediated IGF1R,
  AKT, and ERK activation. Our study also reveals that FAK not only functions as a
  downstream target of both integrins and IGF1R but also modulates the response of
  IGF1R to IGF1. B, IGF1 and shear stress-induced synergism of IGF1 and integrin signaling.
  IGF1 induces physical association of IGF1R and integrins, bringing receptor complexes
  together to generate a signaling hub that potentially amplifies pro-survival and
  pro-proliferation signals.
