caption: The most highly significant gene networks identified in the Ingenuity Pathway
  analysis of the gene expression data in response to PM10 are shown for small intestine
  at days 7(A) and 14(B) and colon at days 7(C) and (D). The networks are displayed
  graphically as nodes (genes/gene products) and edges (the biological relationships
  between the nodes). The intensity of the node color indicates the degree of up (red)
  or down (green) regulation in gene expression. Nodes are displayed using shapes
  that represent the functional class of the gene product. Edges are displayed as
  a direct interaction (solid line).
