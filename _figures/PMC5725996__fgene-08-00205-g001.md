caption: Summary diagram of energy metabolism pathway. Pathway categories were obtained
  from KEGG. Positively selected genes (PSGs) identified in hypoxia-tolerant mammals
  are shown in red. The solid lines indicate direct relationships between enzymes
  and metabolites. The dashed lines indicate that more than one step is involved in
  a process. Glycolysis (EMP) metabolizes glucose to pyruvate, which provides the
  cell with ATP under anaerobic conditions (). In contrast, gluconeogenesis (GNG)
  drives the synthesis of D-glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (e.g., lactate),
  and some glycolytic enzymes are part of the gluconeogenesis pathway. In the pyruvate
  metabolism (PM) pathway, pyruvate is processed anaerobically (fermented) to lactate
  (lactic acid fermentation) or ethanol (alcoholic fermentation), and can be aerobically
  oxidized to CO2. Of note, lactate and pyruvate is either the product of EMP or the
  major precursor for GNG; moreover, the former can be converted back to pyruvate
  when conditions return to normal, or excreted in the urine (). The citrate cycle
  (TCA) contains genes responsible for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA under
  aerobic conditions. Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is composed of multi-subunit
  complexes, encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes, which catalyzes the
  synthesis of ATP (). In the absence of sufficient oxygen, electron transport ceases
  and the energy demands of the cell are not maintained ().
