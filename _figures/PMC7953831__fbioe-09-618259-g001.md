  = 1–9 carbon) cross the outer membrane by diffusion and are simultaneously transported
  and activated by the acyl-CoA synthetase FadD (; ). Acyl-CoAs are converted to enoyl-CoAs
  by the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase FadE and are unable to proceed by native β-oxidation
  due to the absence of FadB and FadJ (). Recombinant enzymes PhaJ4 and PhaC1 (STQK),
  an R-specific enoyl-CoA hydratase and an engineered PHA synthase, respectively,
  are conferred by the pBBR-C1J4SII plasmid and complete the PHA biosynthesis pathway

  however, both fadD and fadE expression are activated by the binding of the cyclic
  AMP receptor protein – cyclic AMP (CRP-cAMP) complex (). A high ATP concentration
  inversely lowers cAMP concentration, reducing the amount of complexed CRP and potentially
  decreasing the expression of fadD and fadE and preventing PHA biosynthesis. ATP
  shown in this figure is a product of the intermediates NADH1, GTP2, and FADH23 (with
  the exception of some ATP generated by glycolytic enzymes).
