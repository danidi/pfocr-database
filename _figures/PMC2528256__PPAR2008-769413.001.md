caption: Production of PGD2 and conversion to its metabolites. Prostanoids follow
  an initial common pathway in which arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids
  by phospholipase A2 and then converted to the short-term intermediates PGG2 and
  PGH2 by cyclooxygenases. Prostaglandin D synthase forms PGD2 itself, but subsequent
  nonenzymatic reactions in aqueous media lead to the sequential production of prostaglandin
  J2 (PGJ2), 9-deoxy-Δ9,Δ12‐13,14-dihydro-PGD2 (Δ12‐PGJ2), and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14‐PGJ2
  (15dPGJ2).
