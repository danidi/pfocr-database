caption: Simplified schematic showing the potential strategy for muscle‐derived miR‐23a/27a
  to attenuate muscle atrophy and renal fibrosis. In diabetes, the insulin/IGF‐1 signalling
  is down‐regulated. In a normally functioning insulin/IGF‐1 signalling pathway, miR‐23
  targets the 3′‐UTR of PTEN resulting in a decrease in PTEN protein amount. The decrease
  in PTEN will result in increased phosphorylation of Akt, inactivation of FoxO, and
  inhibition of the pro‐atrophic E3 ubiquitin ligases TRIM63/MuRF1 and FBXO32/atrogin‐1
  leading to blockade of muscle atrophy. Furthermore, miR‐23 directly targets MuRF1
  and atrogin‐1. The decreased levels of MuRF1 and atrogin‐1 resulting from exogenous
  overexpression of miR‐23 and miR‐27 in a diabetic animal therefore block diabetes‐induced
  muscle atrophy. The decrease in kidney fibrosis in diabetic animals receiving exogenous
  miR‐23 and miR‐27a may result from the influence of miR‐27a and miR‐23a on the TGFβ
  cascade. The TGFβ/myostatin cascade is down‐regulated by miR‐23a and miR‐27a through
  influences on SMADs. MiR‐23a directly inhibits SMAD3 and miR‐27a directly inhibits
  SMAD2, the consequence of which is decreased production of extracellular matrix
  and decreased renal fibrosis. In addition, miR‐27a directly inhibits myostatin,
  which inhibits SMAD2 in a post‐transcription manner resulting in additional up‐regulation
  of pAkt and prevention of diabetic muscle atrophy.
