caption: Signaling cascades participating in presynaptic dormancy reduction. Under
  some conditions, inactivity and increased cAMP activate previously dormant terminals.
  Calcium-dependent adenylyl cyclase VIII (AC8) knockout prevents recovery of active
  terminals when elevated neuronal activity is removed, so AC8 may be the cAMP source
  responsible for this form of unsilencing. In other contexts multiple bursts of high
  frequency stimulation (HFS), which often causes strong calcium influx and long-term
  potentiation, lead to presynaptic awakening. Both activity reduction and HFS require
  protein kinase A (PKA) signaling for presynaptic activation, but how ostensibly
  opposite changes in activity both recruit PKA in different experimental contexts
  remains unknown. Once PKA is activated, phosphorylation events may slow priming
  protein degradation. Additionally, PKA phosphorylates and thereby activates nuclear
  transcription factors (blue arrow and inset) like cAMP response element-binding
  protein (CREB), and this may increase synthesis of presynaptic proteins vital for
  vesicle priming and release (purple arrow and inset). A third pathway to unsilencing
  is via phorbol esters, which enhance function of the priming protein Munc13-1. Under
  this model of dormancy reduction, postsynaptic responses are restored once the presynaptic
  terminal regains the ability to release neurotransmitter.
