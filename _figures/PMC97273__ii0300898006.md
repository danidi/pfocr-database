caption: Model of TCT and endotoxin signaling. TCT and LPS each act through cell surface
  receptors to induce differential signaling events, which combine synergistically
  to activate a unique H7-sensitive kinase. Direct activation of PKC by PMA can produce
  a signal that mimics TCT, in that it can synergize with LPS in the same manner as
  does TCT. However, TCT and LPS signaling pathways do not proceed via PKC, since
  the PKC-specific inhibitor calphostin C does not block effects of TCT and LPS but
  does block effects of PMA and LPS. The signaling pathway induces IL-1α, causing
  induction of iNOS and the production of NO·, which leads to cytostasis. Note that
  while the PMA-stimulated pathway may not proceed through the same kinase as TCT
  and LPS, the depiction is consistent with our data.
