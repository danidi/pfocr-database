caption: Interaction of DNA damage response (DDR), environmental stress response (ESR),
  and TORC1/TORC2 signaling in S. pombe. TORC1 and TORC2 play distinct roles in regulating
  cell growth and division as well as responses to environmental stresses and nutrient
  availability. Activation of Rad3 by DNA damage or replication stress leads to the
  activation of Chk1 and Cds1, respectively. Chk1 and Cds1 inhibit Cdc25 and activate
  Wee1 (or Mik1) to inhibit Cdc2 and delay cell cycle progression. Direct inhibition
  drives cells into mitosis via the Ppk18-Igo1-PP2APab1pathway in the presence of
  DNA damage, suggesting Rad3 may maintain TORC1 activity during cell cycle arrest.
  Conversely, TORC2 is required for the resumption of cell cycle progression once
  DNA repair has been affected. Rad3 may also regulate TORC2 activity during the DDR.
  Caffeine may directly inhibit TORC1 as a low affinity ATP competitor. Alternatively,
  caffeine may indirectly inhibit TORC1 via activation of the ESR and Ssp1-Ssp2 (AMPK)
  pathways.
