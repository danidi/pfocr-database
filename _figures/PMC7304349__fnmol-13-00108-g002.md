caption: G-protein signaling of CB1R. Classically, CB1R signaling is mediated by Gi/osignaling.
  CB1R is activated by ligand (green triangle), generating a conformational change
  that allows for heterotrimeric G-protein (α, β, and γ subunits) binding. The receptor
  then acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), activating Gα by GDP-to-GTP
  exchange. This triggers the dissociation of Gα from Gβγ. Gαi/o inhibits adenylyl
  cyclase (AC), a membrane protein that catalyzes that conversion of ATP to cAMP+PPi,
  causing a decrease in cAMP levels and thus inhibiting the PKA phosphorylation pathway.
  Gβγ inhibits voltage gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and activates G protein-coupled
  inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs).
