caption: Treatment of mouse skin with CHRY leads to the upregulation of IFNγ in the
  epidermis. The actual cellular source of the IFNγ produced in the epidermis after
  treatment with CHRY is not known at the present time. Increased levels of IFNγ lead
  to activation of its receptor on keratinocytes and subsequent downstream signaling
  events. Because both TPA and CHRY cause an initial activation (i.e., phosphorylation)
  of Stat1, the subsequent induction of IRF-1 and uStat1 must occur through a process
  unique to this pathway. Several mechanisms could explain this difference and may
  involve both the canonical (pStat1 homodimers) as well as a novel non-canonical
  pathway involving the translocation of a complex containing IFNγR1/Jak2/pStat1 to
  the nucleus where it binds to the IRF-1 promoter and induces transcription of IRF-1.
  Upregulated IRF-1 then leads to increased transcription of a number of genes, including
  uStat1, iNos and Cox-2 as well as others that ultimately contribute to the skin
  tumor promoting action of CHRY. Both pStat1 and IRF-1 have been shown to interact
  with NFκB, which may also play a role in altered expression of some genes.
