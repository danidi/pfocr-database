caption: 'Alcohol’s effects on pro-inflammatory pathways in liver macrophages (i.e.,
  Kupffer cells). Excessive alcohol consumption increases the permeability of the
  gastrointestinal (GI) tract, exposing Kupffer cells to bacterial endotoxin (i.e.,
  lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). LPS is bound by LPS-binding protein (LBP), enabling engagement
  with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and activating the myeloid differentiation primary
  response (MyD) 88–independent signaling pathway involving interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) and TIR domain–containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF).
  IRF3–TRIF signaling induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases and activates nuclear factor κB
  (NF-κB) and histone acetylation, which trigger transcription of genes for several
  pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα] and interleukin
  [IL]-17). Alcohol’s breakdown to acetaldehyde and acetate also stimulates ROS signaling
  and cytokine production. In addition, IRF3–TRIF signaling and detection of damage-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs or alarmins) released from hepatocytes after alcohol exposure
  stimulate the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex containing caspase 1, which cleaves
  and thus activates another pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. Alcohol activates complement,
  generating anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, which dock with their cognate receptor on
  Kupffer cells, further stimulating cytokine production. NOTES: ADH = alcohol dehydrogenase;
  ALDH = acetaldehyde dehydrogenase; C3a/C5a R = C3a/C5a receptor; CD14 = cluster
  of differentiation 14 protein; MD-2 = myeloid differentiation 2 protein; NOD-like
  R = nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–like receptor.'
