caption: Visualization of two pathways relevant for drug treatment of T2DM. Gene expression
  is visualized on (A) AMPK Signaling pathway, http://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP1403
  and (B) Statin pathway, http://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP430 from WikiPathways.
  The visualization of the gene product boxes in the pathways is split into two parts,
  (1) the log2 FC in the left part of the box (blue is down-regulated over white is
  not changed to red is up-regulated) and (2) the p-value in the right part of the
  box (green when significant). Pathway elements including metabolites that have not
  been measured in the selected dataset are gray.
