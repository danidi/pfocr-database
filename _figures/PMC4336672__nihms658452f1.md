caption: Schematic representation of antiviral pathways in the nematode C. elegans,
  insects and mammals. Signalling DRAs are shown in light orange, catalytic DRAs in
  dark orange (RNaseIII domains highlighted in grey) and dsRBD cofactors in green.
  Cell autonomous primary responses are illustrated in the top panel, and secondary
  responses amplifying antiviral immunity are shown in the bottom panel. In D. melanogaster,
  the cytokines Upd2 and Upd3 activate the Jak/STAT pathway through the receptor Domeless
  [], whereas in cells from the mosquito Culex fasciculatus, Vago triggers activation
  of the pathway through an unknown receptor []. Although also associated with antiviral
  activity in Drosophila, the exact function of Vago in this organism is still unclear.
  In undifferentiated mouse cells, virus-derived siRNAs contribute to antiviral immunity
  [–].
