caption: Schematic outline representing neuronal adiponectin signaling pathway in
  the brain upon consumption of HFD. Chronic consumption of HFD along with several
  inciting factors (metabolic perturbation and adiponectin deficiency) in periphery
  leads to oxidative stress and AdipoR1 suppression along with its downstream signaling
  molecules (energy depletion; p-AMPK) in the brain. This leads to insulin resistance
  and increased APP processing (increased in BACE-1 and Aβ level). Abnormal accumulation
  of Aβ is accompanied by neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction that together
  leads to memory impairment and Alzheimer-like pathology in the mouse brain.
