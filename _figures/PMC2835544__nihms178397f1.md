caption: Regulation and function of SK1. The diagram depicts some of the negative
  and positive regulators of SK1 activity and the synthesis and location of the SK1/S1P
  pathway either present in the heart or derived experimentally. A key feature of
  this pathway is the conversion of the ubiquitous membrane lipid sphingomyelin by
  several sphingomyelinases manufactured intracellularly that act both at the membrane
  level and extracellularly. This results in the generation of ceramide that is deacylated
  by neutral ceramidase, yielding sphingosine, which is then converted to S1P by the
  action of SK1. As noted in the text, activation of SK1 in the heart is inhibited
  by I/R injury and is stimulated by monoganglioside GM-1 that like IPC requires activation
  of PKCε. SK1 activity can also be influenced negatively or positively by the interacting
  proteins shown and by many other agonists described in the text. As shown in the
  figure, SK1 generates intracellular S1P that may act in as yet poorly defined ways
  on mitochondria, nuclei, or other targets. Intracellular S1P is known to be exported
  (“inside-out signaling”) to act as an autocrine or paracrine messenger via G-protein–coupled
  cell surface receptors. A second isoform of SK (SK2) is also responsible for S1P
  generation (not shown). The location of S1P generation within the cell may determine
  its effect, but the outcomes of such location-based effects have not been determined.
  As shown in the figure, S1P is also generated extracellularly by a sequence of enzyme
  reactions similar to those described above. I/R, ischemia/reperfusion.
