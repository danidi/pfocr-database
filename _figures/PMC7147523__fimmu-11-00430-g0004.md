caption: CD11c+ microglia as a subset of microglia present through life and across
  conditions. Our investigation leads us to believe that CD11c+ microglia represent
  a subset of microglia characterized by a robust signature of 22 genes expressed
  by this subset at any age and in various disease states. Emergence of this subset
  is induced by various factors including signaling through the TREM2–APOE pathway,
  cell death, IL-4 signaling, and cytokine signaling through CSF1R inducing CCL2,
  and is inhibited by CD47/SIRPα signaling. In physiological conditions, CD11c+ microglia
  account for around 15% of all microglia, before contracting to 2% in adulthood and
  being re-induced by aging at levels similar to development. In disease states, their
  numbers oscillate between 10 and 50%. We argue that despite the numerous names given
  to this subset across conditions, it is unique and should be referred to as “CD11c+
  microglia”.
