caption: Serine/glycine metabolism in proliferating cells. (a) The serine synthesis
  pathway (SSP). Serine can be imported from the extracellular environment by several
  members of the SLC superfamily of transporters, and it can also be synthesized de
  novo in the cytosol via the SSP. The SSP branches from glycolysis at the point of
  3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and involves three sequential reactions catalyzed by 3-phosphoglycerate
  dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phosphoserine aminotransferase (PSAT1) and phosphoserine
  phosphatase (PSPH). Up to 10% of glycolytic carbon is shunted into the SSP in cancer
  cells. The gene encoding PHGDH is recurrently amplified in a subset of human cancers,
  and is frequently overexpressed even in the absence of amplification. The endproduct
  of the SSP, serine, allosterically activates pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), allowing
  glycolytic flux to increase. Thus, when serine is depleted PKM2 activity becomes
  suppressed and glycolytic intermediates including 3-PG accumulate to supply the
  SSP. In addition, the glycolytic intermediate 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG) activates
  PHGDH. Thick blue arrows indicate multistep pathways and blue text indicates their
  products. Dotted green line and ‘+’ symbol indicate enzymatic activation mechanisms.
  (b) Contribution of serine and glycine to one-carbon metabolism. In proliferating
  mammalian cells, the mitochondrial isoform serine hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2),
  and not cytosolic SHMT1, is the primary catalyst of serine to glycine conversion
  (the SHMT1 reaction is indicated by a thin dotted line, and the SHMT2 reaction by
  a thick solid line, to illustrate the primary flow of carbon). The SHMT reaction
  transfers a one-carbon unit from serine to tetrahydrofolate (THF), generating glycine
  and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF). The mitochondrial glycine cleavage
  system (GCS) transfers a one-carbon unit from glycine to THF, also generating 5,10-CH2-THF.
  This intermediate is oxidized in the mitochondrion by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) or MTHFD2-like (MTHFD2L) to yield 10-formyl-THF. THF can
  be regenerated from 10-formyl-THF, with the release of formate, in a reaction catalyzed
  by MTHFD1L. After transport into the cytosol, formate is consumed by the trifunctional
  MTHFD1 along with cytosolic THF, generating cytosolic 10-formyl-THF, which is required
  for purine synthesis, and cytosolic 5,10-CH2-THF. The latter intermediate donates
  the one-carbon unit to convert deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine
  monophosphate (dTMP), a reaction catalyzed by thymidylate synthase (TYMS). The other
  product of the TYMS reaction, dihydrofolate, is converted back to tetrahydrofolate
  by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). TYMS is a target of the commonly used
  chemotherapy drugs pemetrexed and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and DHFR is a target of
  pemetrexed and methotrexate. Cytosolic 5,10-CH2-THF also donates a one-carbon unit
  for homocysteine methylation in the methionine cycle. Thick blue arrows indicate
  multistep pathways and blue text indicates their products. Reactions involving transfer
  of one-carbon units are highlighted with the text ‘1C’ in blue. Abbreviations:α-KG,
  α-ketoglutarate; ENO, enolase; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PGAM, phosphoglycerate
  mutase; Pi, inorganic phosphate; 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; SSP, serine synthesis
  pathway. Amino acids are denoted by their standard three-letter abbreviations.
