caption: Ligand-induced activation of an unknown receptor may be transmitted through
  plasma membrane-associated STE-20, RAS-2 and CAP-1, which signal toward the NRC-1/STE-50
  complex and recruit the MAPK cascade through activation and clustering of the scaffold
  HAM-5 at intracellular puncta. MAK-2 activation triggers nuclear gene expression
  through interaction with the transcription factor PP-1 and the RCO-1/RCM-1 complex
  and the cytosolic activation of the secretory pathway and cell polarity machineries
  to coordinate pulsed signal release and chemotrophic growth towards the partner
  cell, respectively. MAK-2 activity is also required for termination of the receiver
  phase, potentially through negative feedback phosphorylation of the MAPK and disassembly
  of the MAK-2/HAM-5 module. MAK-2 pathway function may also be regulated through
  the STRIPAK complex, the CK2 heterodimer, membrane lipid composition, the septum-associated
  septation initiation network SIN and motor protein-dependent vesicle trafficking.
