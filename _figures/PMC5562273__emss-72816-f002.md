caption: The scheme shows the NER factors that have been studied most extensively
  in the nematode. The damage is recognized either via GG-NER factors DDB-1 or XPC-1,
  or via TC-NER, in which CSB-1 and CSA-1 interact with the stalled RNA polymerase
  II. Both pathways employ a common core mechanism that is distinguished in DNA unwinding,
  damage excision and DNA synthesis to fill the gap.
