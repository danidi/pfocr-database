caption: Pathway network associated with PCOS. Five genes (LEP, SPP1, F2R, IL12B and
  RBP4) and two important pathways (the Jak-STAT signaling pathway and neuroactive
  ligand-receptor interaction) were involved in this pathway network. PCOS, polycystic
  ovarian syndrome; LEP, leptin; SPP1, secreted phosphoprotein 1; F2R, coagulation
  factor 2 receptor; IL12B, interleukin-12 subunit β; RBP4, retinol binding protein
  4; KEGG, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.
