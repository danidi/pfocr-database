  systemic regulation at the endocrine level. The GH-IGF-IGFBP axis is directed by
  the hypophysis where GH is produced. In the liver, GH stimulates the secretion of
  its main effector, IGF-I, as well as IGF-II and IGFBPs. B, at the tissue level,
  the levels of the free ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II) are regulated bythe presence of
  the six different IGFBPs, which bind the growth factors with high affinity, and
  by IGFBP-related proteins, which bind IGF-I and IGF-II with lower affinity. The
  formers are regulated by specific proteases. Insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II bind to
  the different receptors (insulin receptors A and B, IGF-IR, and IGF-IIR) with diverse
  affinities, and each receptor triggers different intracellular signaling cascades.
  Hybrid receptors are composed by one α-subunit and one β-subunit of the IGF-IR and
  one α-subunit and one β-subunit of the insulin receptor. C, at the cellular level,
  binding of IGF-I to its receptor triggers the autophosphorylation of the later and
  of the adaptor proteins IRS1 to 4 and shc/ Grb-2. Activation of each of these proteins
  prompts different signaling cascades through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt
  and ras/raf/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase
  pathways. The GH-IGF-IGFBP axis controls, through these three levels of regulation,
  mediators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and translation that regulate cell growth,
  proliferation, and differentiation, as well as energetic metabolism. D, overlapping

  complement each other and there is an equilibrium in signaling between the energy
  and metabolic pathways and pathways that drive growth and proliferation. II, in

  of IGF-IR turns the cells to survive apoptotic signals and to proliferate. III,
  specific inhibition of IGF-IR with monoclonal antibodies can switch the equilibrium
  toward a predominance of the insulin pathway, having significant metabolic effects.

  description: The three levels of regulation of the IGF-IR pathwayand its components.
    A, systemic regulation at the endocrine level. The GH-IGF-IGFBP axis is directed

    of the six different IGFBPs, which bind the growth factors with high affinity,
    and by IGFBP-related proteins, which bind IGF-I and IGF-II with lower affinity.
    The formers are regulated by specific proteases. Insulin, IGF-I, and IGF-II bind
    to the different receptors (insulin receptors A and B, IGF-IR, and IGF-IIR) with
    diverse affinities, and each receptor triggers different intracellular signaling

    of each of these proteins prompts different signaling cascades through the phosphatidylinositol
    3-kinase/Akt and ras/raf/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated
    kinase kinase pathways. The GH-IGF-IGFBP axis controls, through these three levels
    of regulation, mediators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and translation that regulate
    cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as energetic metabolism.
