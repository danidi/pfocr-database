caption: Proposed mechanism. Infection of either NIH:Swiss or core-3−/− mice with
  C. rodentium leads to colonic crypt hyperplasia which is associated with activation
  of both the Wnt/β-catenin and Notch pathways. Acute blockade of Notch signaling
  via DBZ before the onset of C. rodentium-induced crypt cell proliferation (A) also
  inhibits the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, leading to abrogation of hyperplasia. Late blocking
  after the onset of C. rodentium-induced crypt cell hyperproliferation fails to inhibit
  either the Wnt/β-catenin pathway or crypt hyperplasia (B). Chronic inhibition of
  the Notch pathway leads to an inability of the mucosa to regenerate, and along with
  defects in barrier function, it may trigger colitis (dotted lines). Dietary intervention
  with either bael or curcumin restores signaling via the two pathways, which may
  be associated with a restoration of barrier function and amelioration of colitis
  (dotted lines).
