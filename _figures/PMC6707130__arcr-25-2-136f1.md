caption: Functional components of the internal timekeeping system responsible for
  the regulation of circadian, or 24-hour, rhythms in mammals. The central circadian
  pacemaker, or “clock,” is located in the brain in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN).
  These cells contain the “gears” that are necessary for accurate timekeeping. These
  gears consist of certain genes (e.g., the Period genes and the Cryptochrome genes)
  that are rhythmically expressed and regulate ciracadian output pathways. These pathways
  involve various signals that emanate from the SCN, including neuropeptides, such
  as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and vasoactive
  intestinal polypeptide (VIP). These neuropeptides and other output signals act on
  other brain regions or peripheral organs and result in the generation of overt rhythms
  in biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes throughout the body. The
  retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) is an entrainment, or input, pathway that mediates
  the synchronization of the circadian clock to the light-dark cycle.
