caption: Cilia-dependent mTOR signaling. Flow shear stress mediates the bending of
  primary cilia and inhibition of mTORC1. Tumor suppressor kinase (LKB1) and AMP-dependent
  protein kinase (AMPK) are found in the cilia and basal body. Upon cilium bending
  by fluid flow, LKB1 is activated and transported into the basal body, where AMPK
  is phosphorylated. Furthermore, AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 to activate the TSC1–TSC2
  complex. In turn, TSC1–TSC2 stimulates the GTPase activity of Rheb, preventing it
  from activating mTORC1. Otherwise, AMPK could also directly antagonize mTORC1. Polycystin-1
  (PC1) may also exert its inhibitory effect on the mTORC1 pathway through its known
  interaction with TSC2. The T bars denote inhibition of protein function.
