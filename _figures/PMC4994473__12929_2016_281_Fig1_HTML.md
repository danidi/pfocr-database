caption: Hypoxia and signaling mediators. Representation of the signaling pathways
  mediated by NF-kB and HIF under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Under normoxic
  conditions, HIF-α is hydroxylated by PHD and FIH enzymes to promote its ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation. During hypoxia, stabilized HIF-α relocates to the nucleus
  where it forms a dimer with HIF-β, recruits coactivators, and initiates transcription
  of hypoxia-regulated genes. NF-kB is inactive in the cytoplasm owing to its association
  with IkB. Activation of this pathway is regulated by IKK, which mediates the phosphorylation
  and degradation of IkB, allowing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus where it activates
  gene transcription. PHD has been proposed to inhibit IKK under normoxic conditions.
