caption: Characterization of the 3 biosynthetic gene cluster. A, four overlapping
  cosmids were identified and sequenced to define the genetic organization of the
  3 biosynthetic gene cluster. The cpr25 gene encodes the putative l-Thr:uridine-5′-aldehyde
  transaldolase that was targeted to identify the genetic locus. B, comparative analysis
  of the sequenced region of chromosomal DNA from the 2- and 3-producing strains.
  Highlighted in blue are the minimal ORFs predicted to be essential for 3 biosynthesis,
  whereas the two ORFs in black, cpr19 and cpr25, are predicted to encode for a non-heme
  Fe(II)-dependent αKG:UMP dioxygenase and l-Thr:uridine-5′-aldehyde transaldolase,
  respectively. C, shared biosynthetic pathway leading to the core structure of 2
  and 3 and divergence upon amide bond formation.
