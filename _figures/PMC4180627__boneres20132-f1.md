caption: 'The endocrinology of vitamin D. The left panel depicts the essentials of
  the endocrine synthesis, metabolism and action of vitamin D. The key enzyme in the
  synthesis of the active, vitamin D receptor-(VDR) interacting metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
  D, is the CYP27b1-hydroxylase. In normal human endocrine physiology the CYP27b1-hydroxylase
  is expressed principally in the kidney but also in the placenta. The catabolic CYP24a1-24-hydroxylase
  is ubiquitously distributed among human tissues and serves to inactivate 25-hydroxyvitamin
  D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The right panel shows the endocrine responses of
  the vitamin D pathway to a hypocalcemic challenge and the human host''s use of the
  skeleton to restore blood calcium levels back to normal. Abbreviations include:
  CaSR, calcium sensing receptor; PTH, parathyroid hormone; PTH/PTHrP, receptor for
  PTH and parathyroid hormone-related protein; DBP, serum vitamin D binding protein;
  RXR, retinoid X receptor; VDRE, vitamin D response element; Ca2+, calcium ion; PO43−,
  phosphate ion; RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand; FGF23,
  fibroblast growth factor-23. Figure adapted with the permission of the original
