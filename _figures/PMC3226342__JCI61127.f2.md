caption: (A) Relationship between Pomc expression (which encodes a precursor protein
  that can be cleaved to generate ACTH) and pituitary cell growth mediated by the
  MAPK pathway. Corticotroph adenomas have aberrant MAPK pathway activation, resulting
  in pituitary cell growth and increased Pomc expression (). (B) Use of a TKI reduces
  corticotroph adenoma growth and Pomc expression, which is mediated by the MAPK signaling
  pathway.
