caption: In macrophage cells, LPS triggers TLR4 pathway to activate NF-κB signals
  by promoting IκB degradation and nuclear translocation of p50 and RelA/p65 to enhance
  the target gene e.g., TNF-α transcription. In our current study, we demonstrated
  a non-canonical signaling where LPS may activate the phosphorylation of a ubiquitous
  transcription factor, STAT3 which in turn can further augment the down-stream signaling
  for TNF-α expression, since blocking STAT3 activation by Static dramatically reduced
  the LPS induced TNF-α production. In the biological system, the versatile function
  of STAT3 enabled it to generate both the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signal
  transduction efficiently. Utilizing the STAT3 pathway, MFG-E8 can directly exert
  its anti-inflammatory effects towards downregulating the LPS-induced TNF-α production
  in macrophages via activating SOCS3. MFG-E8-induced SOCS3 may in turn target the
  NF-κB p65 component for ubiquitination and act as a negative regulator of LPS-mediated
  TLR4 signaling via NF-κB for TNF-α production.
