caption: Proposed differential roles of FadA, FlbA, PhnA, and Gβγ in controlling ST
  production. We propose that the A. nidulans PhLP PhnA is an essential component
  of SfaD-GpgA-mediated signaling, which is required for normal vegetative growth,
  sexual fruiting body formation, ST production, and proper down-regulation of asexual
  development. FadA-mediated vegetative growth signaling is transduced in part by
  the primary PKA PkaA (). PkaB is the secondary (backup) PKA catalytic subunit, playing
  a role in hyphal growth and germination (). The FadA→PkaA signaling pathway is thought
  to be primarily responsible for the negative control of ST biosynthesis via modulating
  the activity of the AflR protein (). The potential inhibitory role of the FadA→PkaA
  pathway on the transcription of aflR is indicated by a dotted line (, ). It is proposed
  that the results of SfaD-GpgA signaling include transcriptional activation of aflR
  and subsequent ST production. A dotted arrow presents the predicted posttranscriptional/posttranslational
  activation of AflR by FlbA. Potential autoactivation of aflR transcription by the
  AflR protein (, ) is also indicated.
