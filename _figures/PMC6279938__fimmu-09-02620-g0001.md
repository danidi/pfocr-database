caption: 'Impact of i-proteasome subunits on innate immune signaling in myeloid cells.
  Among many different pattern recognition receptors, TLRs are sensors of microbial
  antigens on monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells. These membrane-bound receptors
  are located both on the cellular surface (TLR4—colored in red) and in endosomes
  (TLR3—green, TLR7—blue, TLR9—purple) (). Signaling pathways down-stream of TLR4,
  TLR7, and TLR9 involve the common adaptor molecule MyD88 (, ). Upon TLR stimulation,
  the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRAF6 engages with the TLR/MyD88 complex and generates poly-ubiquitin
  scaffolds (), thereby recruiting the TAK1 complex (). TAK1 then activates the IKK
  complex, which in turn phosphorylates IκBα. Ubiquitination of IκBα marks it for
  degradation by the proteasome. Thereafter, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus.
  Simultaneously, TAK1 induces MAP kinase signaling (), which results in the phosphorylation
  of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK and thereby activates the transcription factor AP-1. Both
  NF-κB and AP-1 induce the expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40)
  and migration signals (CCR7) on DCs, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-23, IL-1β), chemokines (e.g., Mip2α, MCP-1, IP-10, RANTES),
  and of Pentraxin3 by monocytes/macrophages (cytokines partially also by DCs). MyD88-dependent
  TLR7/9 signaling induces the phosphorylation of IRF7, which is a key regulator of
  T1IFN (IFNα, IFNβ) expression in pDCs (). Signals from TLR3 and TLR4 are transmitted
  by a MyD88-independent, TRIF-dependent pathway involving activating kinases ().
  Phosphorylation of IRF-3 induces translocation into the nucleus. Results obtained
  from in vitro studies, in which the impact of the different peptidase activities
  of the proteasome isoforms regarding to TLR signaling or the expression of effector
  molecules were investigated by different approaches, are summarized. Colors indicate
  the type of TLR stimulated to activate innate immune cells of different origin including
  human PBMCs, murine splenocytes, bone marrow cells and peritoneal macrophages. Each
  box illustrates both the model used to alter a specific peptidase activity of the
  proteasome—innate myeloid cells isolated from knock out mice or proteasome inhibitors
  with different specificity studied in innate myeloid cells, as well as, the observed
  effect either on the respective signaling pathway or on the production of respective
  effector molecules. (↓): reduced phosphorylation of a key molecule in the indicated
  signaling pathway or lower production of the effector molecule, = no alteration
