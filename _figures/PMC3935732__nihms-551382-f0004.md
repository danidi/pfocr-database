caption: Activation of ABL kinases downstream of hyperactive RTKs, chemokine receptors
  and Src kinases, or in response to oxidative stress promotes cancer cell invasion
  by direct or indirect activation of actin regulatory proteins such as cortactin,
  N-WASP, Abl interactor 1 (Abi1), WAVE, CrkL, HEF1/NEDD9, and the Rac GTPase, , -,
  . ABL kinases regulate MT1-MMP localization and activity. ABL2 interacts with MT1-MMP
  promoting its phosphorylation, and ECM degradation. One or both ABL kinases are
  required for cancer cell invasion depending on the cellular context, . ABL kinases
  also regulate cancer cell invasion by modulating expression of several MMPs and
  other genes involved in EGFR-mediated invasion, . ABL1 regulates MMP1 expression
  through a STAT3-dependent pathway, and ABL2 regulates the expression of MMP1, MMP3,
  and MT1-MMP through yet to be identified transcription factors. Solid lines indicate
  direct links between ABL and target proteins; dotted lines indicate indirect links.
