caption: Heuristic model showing the tyrosine phosphorylation signaling pathways in
  sperm cell involved in capacitation. There seems to be three major signaling pathways
  operating in sperm cell, namely cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway (pathway I), receptor
  tyrosine kinase pathway (pathway II), and non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase pathway
  (pathway III). The pathway I, that is exclusive only to sperm cells, seems to be
  the major pathway among the three pathways. These cascades may not be mutually exclusive
  and include cross-talk among several molecules. Many key molecules and receptors
  are still to be identified to completely elucidate the molecular mechanism and signal
  transduction cascade involved in capacitation. G-protein coupled receptor pathway
  has not been included in this model.
