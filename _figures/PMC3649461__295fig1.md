caption: Signal transduction pathways of the amino acid (AA) response (AAR). The AAR
  represents a collection of signal transduction pathways that are activated by AA
  deprivation of mammalian cells. There are differences between cell types, such as
  which mitogen-activated protein kinases are activated, but the central pathway of
  general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2)–eukaryotic initiation factor 2–activating
  transcription factor 4 (ATF4) appears to be ubiquitously expressed and regulated
  in all tissues. Likewise, the phosphorylation of ATF2 may well be a universal response,
  but the tissue distribution of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation has not
  been established. The autoregulatory induction of cJUN by the AAR occurs in cultured
  transformed cells to a much greater extent than in nontransformed counterparts,
  although the response has not yet been studied in vivo. The initial AA sensor for
  the cJUN and phosphorylated ATF2 (p-ATF2) pathways has not been determined conclusively.
  Interestingly, the 4 pathways shown rely on a variety of molecular mechanisms. The
  synthesis of ATF4 protein is translationally controlled, the phosphorylation of
  preexisting cJUN and ATF2 protein is mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase
  signaling, and NF-κB activation occurs as a consequence of disassociation, but not
  degradation, of IκB. See the text for additional details. GPCR, G protein–coupled
  receptor; IκB, inhibitory kappa beta; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MEK/ERK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase/extracellular-regulated kinase.
