caption: In response to TCR and CD28 costimulatory signals, CD8 T cells rapidly increase
  flux of glucose through the glycolysis pathway into lactate and mitochondria. Likewise,
  glutamine uptake is significantly increased to replenish carbons lost in the TCA
  cycle to macromolecule synthesis. Memory CD8 T cells acquire a metabolic program
  that is distinct from naïve T cells where they significantly increase their mitochondrial
  mass and are reliant on fatty acid oxidation to provide energy. Importantly, manipulation
  of the metabolic programs of effector and memory T cells appears to influence fate
  and function, suggesting that targeting the metabolism of responding CD8 T cells
  may represent a viable approach to facilitating the development of protective immunity
  or controlling pathogenic processes. FAO, fatty acid oxidation; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; TCA, tricarboxylic.
