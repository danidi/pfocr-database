caption: Model of pmCB1s and mtCB1s in presynaptic nerve terminals. Stimulation is
  represented by solid arrows and inhibition by dotted lines. Postsynaptic depolarization
  induces Ca2+ influx and the subsequent activation of DGLα results in 2-AG synthesis
  and release. 2-AG is degraded by MAGL in mitochondria and other presynaptic intracellular
  compartments. Weak DSI produces only enough 2-AG for pmCB1 activation; strong DSI
  generates enough to also activate mtCB1s. Stimulation of pmCB1 reduces transmitter
  release mainly by inhibiting presynaptic, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (not shown).
  Stimulation of mtCB1 inhibits the cAMP-PKA pathway and thereby inhibits the activity
  of complex I in the electron transport chain. The resulting reduction of mitochondrial
  respiration triggers further inhibition of transmitter release through an unknown
  mechanism. Complex I can also be inhibited by rotenone. Membrane permeant agonists
  such as HU210 or antagonists such as AM251 gain access to both pmCB1s and mtCB1s.
  However, hemopressin, a membrane-impermeant CB1 antagonist, prevents eCB effects
  only partially because it inhibits only pmCB1s. Similarly, the membrane-impermeant
  CB1 agonist HU-biot activates only pmCB1s and so cannot completely occlude eCB-mediated
  effects if mtCB1s are involved.
