caption: Biological association network (BAN) of differentially expressed genes in
  common between CA and ICC. The list of common genes between both treatments was
  used to construct a BAN with the Pathway Analysis software within GeneSpring v.11.5.1.
  An expanded network was constructed by setting an advanced filter that included
  the categories of binding, expression, metabolism, promoter binding, protein modification,
  and regulation. Only proteins are represented. The BAN shows the node genes STAT5B
  and ATF-2 that were further studied.
