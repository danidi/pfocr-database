caption: Proposed mechanism of CyPA/EMMPRIN axis involvement in TAA associated with
  MFS.The ECM of thoracic aorta in MFS patients is characterized by fragmented fibrillin-1,
  which determines TGF-β1 release. Active TGF-β1 binds its receptor and stimulates
  both the SMAD2/3 (canonical) and ERK1/2 (non-canonical) pathways, leading to the
  transcription and translation of pro-fibrotic factors, such as collagen and TGF-β1
  itself. AngII stimulus leads to the secretion of CyPA, which binds its receptor
  EMMPRIN. The CyPA/EMMPRIN axis triggers (i) ERK1/2 pathway (non-canonical signaling,
  shared with TGF-β1), (ii) EMMPRIN, which, in turn, induces MMP activation, and (iii)
  the expression of typical downstream ERK1/2 pro-fibrotic mediators, involved in
  tissue remodeling of MFS-associated TAA. The inhibitor MM284 reverses all the deleterious
  effects of CyPA in MFS-VSMC.
