caption: Domain organization of DARPP-32. DARPP-32 is phosphorylated at Thr34 by PKA
  (and PKG, not shown), at Thr75 by Cdk5, at Ser97 by CK2, and at Ser130 by CK1. Thr34
  is preferentially dephosphorylated by PP2B (calcineurin); Thr75 is preferentially
  dephosphorylated by PP2A; Ser97 is also preferentially dephosphorylated by PP2A
  (not shown); Ser130 is dephosphorylated by PP2C. Phosphorylation of Thr34 converts
  DARPP-32 into a potent inhibitor of PP1. A PP1 docking motif and phosphorylation
  of Thr34 are required for binding and inhibition of PP1. Phosphorylation of Thr75
  converts DARPP-32 into an inhibitor of PKA, reducing its ability to phosphorylate
  DARPP-32 and other substrates. Phosphorylation of Ser130 increases phosphorylation
  of Thr34 through inhibition of PP2B and potentiates dopaminergic signaling via the
  cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32/PP-1 pathway. In contrast, phosphorylation of Thr75 acts to inhibit
  dopaminergic signaling via this pathway. Phosphorylation of Ser97 in conjunction
  with a nuclear export signal (NES) act to export DARPP-32 from the nucleus and maintain
  the cytoplasmic localization of the protein observed under basal conditions.
