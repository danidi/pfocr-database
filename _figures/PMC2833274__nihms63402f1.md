caption: 'Sorting of acid hydrolases mediated by mannose 6-phosphate receptors. The
  scheme represents the sorting of acid hydrolases by transmembrane, mannose 6-phosphate
  receptors (MPR) that cycle between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes.
  Coats containing clathrin, GGA and AP-1 mediate exit of hydrolase-MPR complexes
  from the TGN, whereas retromer mediates the retrieval of unoccupied MPR from endosomes.
  Sequestration of MPR into recycling tubules by retromer prevents their delivery
  to the degradative, multivesicular body (MVB) pathway by the clathrin-ESCRT machinery.
  A fraction of MPR are transported from the TGN to the plasma membrane, after which
  they are internalized by coats containing clathrin and AP-2, joining the pool of
  recycling receptors in endosomes. See text for additional details and references.
  TEN: tubular endosomal network; H+ represents the acidic pH of the endosome lumen.'
