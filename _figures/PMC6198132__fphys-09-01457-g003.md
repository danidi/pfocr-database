caption: 'Hypothetical scheme for the unfolded protein response-induced signaling
  cascade in MANF-deficient beta cells. Ablation of MANF in mouse beta cells in vivo
  leads to sustained UPR, increased inflammatory signaling and beta cell death. The
  IRE1α pathway, Xbp1s and Chop mRNA levels were found increased in the pancreases
  of Manf-/- embryos at E18.5, whereas the PERK and ATF6 pathways were upregulated
  and chronically activated after birth in Manf-/- islets (). Chronic activation of
  IRE1α and its oligomerization, has been shown to recruit TRAF2 and ASK1 in a complex
  that activates JNK and p38 signaling cascades, leading to increased expression of
  CHOP and pro-apoptotic genes (; ). IRE1α/TRAF2 complex also stimulates the activation
  of pro-inflammatory NF-κB signaling cascades via IκBα proteosomal degradation by
  ERAD leading to intrinsic beta cell death. BCL10 expression levels were found decreased
  in cytokine-treated human beta cells and silencing of MANF in cytokine-treated human
  EndoC-βH1 resulted in a significant increase of BCL10 expression (), suggesting
  involvement of BCL10 in the beta cell survival pathway regulated by MANF. BCL10
  is a known inducer of apoptosis and an upstream regulator of NF-κB and also a binding
  partner of TRAF2 (). Thus, BCL10 was placed with TRAF2 activated by IRE1α in the
  scheme. NF-κB nuclear translocation induces among other genes, iNOS expression leading
  to subsequent NO formation. NO constrain the SERCA2b pump, consequently leading
  to depletion of Ca2+ from the ER, resulting in increased ER stress () and cell death.
  The role of the JNK/p38 pathway in Manf-/- islets is under investigation. Activation
  of ATF6 pathway results in enhanced expression of pro-apoptotic transcription factor
  CHOP. The activation of PERK pathway followed by phosphorylation of eIF2α leads
  to global inhibition of protein synthesis and selective increase in translation
  of transcription factor ATF4. EIF2α was chronically phosphorylated and ATF4 mRNA
  upregulated in islets from Manf-/- mice (). Global inhibition of translation induced
  by pEIFα also leads to reduced expression of inhibitory IκBα resulting in increased
  NF-κB nuclear translocation and activation of inflammatory genes. ATF4 is known
  to induce the expression of Chop, Trib3 and Xbp1. Trib3 has been shown to inhibit
  AKT phosphorylation in the insulin signaling pathway (). In addition, Trib3 expression
  was shown to be reduced in beta cells with genetically reduced insulin production
  due to reduced PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 activation (). Reduced ATF4 led to increased AKT
  Ser473 phosphorylation and increase in beta cell proliferation via cyclinD1. Thus
  decreased beta cell proliferation in Manf-/- mice could be caused by increased ATF4-induced
  Trib3 mRNA expression and increased inhibition of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation and
