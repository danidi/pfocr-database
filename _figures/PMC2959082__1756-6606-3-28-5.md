caption: The function of the Trc signaling pathway in tiling and self-avoidance. Unidentified
  cell surface signals activate Hpo and TOR, which in turn up-regulate the activity
  of the Trc and Fry complex. Trc may then modulate the activity of certain cytoskeletal
  regulators to control the growth of neuronal arbors. PM, plasma membrane.
