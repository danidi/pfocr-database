caption: Schematic overview of Annexins at the crossroad of late endocytic pathways.
  Late endocytic structures (LE), MVBs containing ILV and Lys with associated Annexins
  are depicted in the centre of the diagram. The LE compartment dynamically and functionally
  interacts with several inbound and outbound routes; (1) maturation of early endosomes
  (EE); (2) the recycling pathway to the plasma membrane; (3) the transport route
  for the biogenesis of lysosomes from Golgi or (4) the retrograde trafficking to
  the Golgi membranes. Rab proteins (i.e., Rab5, 7) are critical for these pathways
  are also shown. In addition, a subset of cytosolic proteins, such as Ca2+ binding
  proteins (i.e., calmodulin, CaM; S100 family; apoptosis-linked gene 2, Alg-2) and
  signalling proteins (i.e., mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, mTORC1), interact
  with proteins (lipids) at the membrane of LE/Lys, contributing to the regulation
  of ion channels, pumps, enzymes or signalling complexes. The close connection with
  ER membranes enables membrane contact sites (MCS) to establish metabolic functional
  platforms for the exchange of lipids (cholesterol) and ions (Ca2+). Specific proteins,
  “tethers”, such as AnxA1 and possibly AnxA6, or “exchangers”, like StARD3, ORP1L,
  or ORP5 at the LE/Lys membrane, are attached via two phenylalanines acid track (FFAT)
  motifs with vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated proteins A/B (VAP-A/B)
  or protrudin at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Hence, complex interplay of
  vesicular transport with non-vesicular transport through MCS guarantee Ca2+ and
  cholesterol homeostasis and the positioning of LE/Lys constituents. Although Annexins
  are commonly considered cytosolic proteins, they have been identified inside as
  well as outside LE structures. Ca2+, acidic phospholipids and cholesterol regulate
  the recruitment and binding of a subset of Annexins to the LE surface; Finally,
  (5) the secretory pathway for constitutive exocytosis and (6) a regulated transport
  for the secretion of exosomes, involving ESCRT and Alix from MVBs, are shown. Orange
  arrows indicated those pathways modulated by cholesterol. Green arrows indicated
  recycling pathways and cytoplasmic proteins interacting with late endocytic compartment.
  Grey arrows indicate maturation of the late endocytic structures. Caveolin-1, Cav1;
