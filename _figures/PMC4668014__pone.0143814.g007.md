caption: SIRT1 (a histone deacetylase, HDAC) could directly promote the deacetylation
  of acetylated (Ac)-p53 or indirectly suppress the acetylation of nascent p53 through
  inhibition of p300 (a histone acetyltransferase, HAT) expression, and thereby modulate
  Ac-p53/p21-mediated endothelial senescence. Incubating cells in High glucose (HG)
  for 3 days followed by normal glucose (NG) for 3 days (a cellular model of transient
  hyperglycaemia) enhanced intracellular ROS production, which in turn inhibited the
  expression and deacetylase activity of SIRT1 and simultaneously increased the protein
  level of p300. Accordingly, the transcriptional activity of p53 was increased due
  to sustained acetylation at lysine 382 (K382), and the expression of p21, a downstream
  gene of p53, was activated, leading to persistent endothelial senescence (a cellular
  model of “metabolic memory”). Furthermore, resveratrol (RSV) and metformin (MET)
  could prevent the transient hyperglycaemia-induced senescent “memory” via AMPK-dependent
  ROS reduction and SIRT1 activation.
