caption: Two pathways of cellular TCR. UvrD-dependent TCR (left). Under conditions
  of massive DNA damage, the SOS response increases UvrD output, which leads to UvrD
  dimerization, RNAP backtracking, and TCR.Mfd-dependent TCR (right). Cells with a
  steady-state level of DNA damage have low concentrations of UvrD, thus the UvrD-dependent
  pathway is repressed. DNA damage is located and removed via Mfd-dependent TCR. Proposed
  switch from Mfd to UvrD pathway under non-SOS stress conditions is shown by the
  dashed line.
