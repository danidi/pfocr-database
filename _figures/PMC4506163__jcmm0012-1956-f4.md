caption: Gene product association networks extracted from the most significant (A)
  cellular and regulatory process pathways and (B) metabolic pathways involved in
  arteriotomy-induced carotid stenosis (listed in Table ). The core of the network
  in A is constituted by genes involved in MAPK signalling (green line), cell adhesion
  (red line) and focal adhesion (yellow line). The most significant pathway in B is
  arginine and proline metabolism. Faded nodes belong to pathways with a P>0.1. The
  thickness of the edge is proportional to the number of pathways to which are associated
  two genes.
