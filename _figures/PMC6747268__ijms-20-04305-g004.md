caption: Signaling pathways involved in the switch between proliferation and dormancy.
  Proliferation to dormancy switch seems to be mediated by interactions between surface
  receptors such as UPR and integrins, mitogenic signaling from the Ras-extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, and stress induced signaling from the p38
  pathway. In particular, the switch toward phosphorylation of ERK1/2 favors proliferation,
  while predominant phosphorylation of p38 leads to a G0/G1 arrest, growth arrest
  and survival that result in dormancy.
