caption: Model of inhibition by insulin of APOC3 transcription and modulation by abdominal
  obesity. A repressor rather than an activator mediates the action of insulin over
  APOC3 gene expression (pathway 1). In the absence of insulin, the transcriptional
  machinery (TM) is bound to the APOC3-promoter, which results in the transcription
  of APOC3-mRNA. In conditions of good insulin sensitivity, for example in lean individuals,
  the activated repressor is unable to bind to the mutant-type insulin response element
  (IRE), and the TM remains bound to the APOC3-promoter and results in overexpression
  of the APOC3 gene (pathway 2). In conditions of insulin resistance, for example
  in obese individuals, the repressor fails to be activated, and the TM remains bound
  to the APOC3-promoter and results in overexpression of the APOC3 gene regardless
  of the presence of mutations in the APOC3-IRE (pathways 3 and 4). IL, interleukin;
  TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor receptor; JNK, jun N-terminal
  kinase; IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate-1; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase.
