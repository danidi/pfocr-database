caption: Schematic overview of the network of enriched pathways related to HIV disease
  progression. HIV accessory proteins and side effects of therapy could lead to the
  impaired activity of electron transport chain complex I, which results in mitochondrial
  dysfunction. As a compensatory effect, OXPHOS pathway (electron transport chain
  and ATP synthase) is up-regulated as indicated by the red arrow. Along with the
  OXPHOS pathway, the TCA cycle supplying NADH to OXPHOS, and a wide range of metabolic
  pathways (carbohydrate, fatty acid, protein, and amino acid metabolism pathways)
  furnishing substrates to the TCA cycle are coordinately up-regulated. In addition,
  mitochondrial dysfunction leads to cell apoptosis mediated by the activation of
  mitochondrial membrane pore-forming proteins, such as BAX and BAD. Pores generated
  in the mitochondrial membranes allow the release of the pro-apoptotic proteins cytochrome
  c, which binds to APAF and hence activates CASP9 leading to the caspase cascade
  resulting in apoptosis. G2 arrest and DNA damage signaling could also activate BAX
  leading to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. On the other hand, AKT could prevent
  apoptosis by either inhibiting BAD or CASP9 activation or preventing FOXO factors
  from relocating to the nucleus.
