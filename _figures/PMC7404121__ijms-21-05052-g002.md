caption: The synergistic regulation mechanisms of leaf angle by phytohormones in rice.
  (A) Brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathway. The corresponding enzyme that catalyze
  each reaction in yellow color. The secondary structure of the chemical is obtained
  from ChemSpider (http://www.chemspider.com/Default.aspx). (B) Positive and negative
  regulation of leaf angle by brassinosteroid (BR) signaling pathway and its crosstalk
  with other regulators involved in other plant hormones pathway, and other phytohormones
  regulators positively participate in regulation of leaf angle. The proteins in white
  color and with a question mark represent that they are homologs of those reported
  to be involved in the regulation of leaf angle. The green arrow represents the downregulation
  of indoleacetic acid (IAA). The protein in red color box represents as the positive
  regulator while the one in green color box represents the negative regulator of
  leaf angle. The dashed line and solid line represent the indirect or direct evidence
  supporting the responsible regulation, respectively.
