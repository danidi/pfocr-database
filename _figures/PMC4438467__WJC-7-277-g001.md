caption: 'The role of mitochondrial cholesterol trafficking in regulation of macrophage
  sterol metabolism. Increased expression of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein
  (StAR, STARD1) or 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) drive cholesterol trafficking
  to mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), enhancing endogenous production
  of oxysterols (24-, 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol), in turn activating liver X receptors
  (LXR) and enhancing cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (Apo AI) via ATP binding
  cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). One current model for cholesterol transfer from
  the outer (OMM) to inner (IMM) mitochondrial membrane, derived from studies in steroidogenic
  cells, involves a complex of proteins, including StAR, TSPO, voltage-dependent anion
  channel (VDAC), regulatory subunits of protein kinase A (PKA-R1α), acyl CoA binding
  domains-1 and -3, ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3A (ASTAD3A) and optic
  atrophy type 1 proteins. Exogenous cholesterol delivered to the endocytic pathway
  via lipoprotein or scavenger receptors is transported either to the plasma membrane,
  enhancing cholesterol efflux via ABCA1, to lipid poor acceptors such as Apo AI or
  Apo E, or delivered to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), retaining the Sterol Regulatory
  Element Binding Protein (SREBP)/SREBP-cleavage activating protein (SCAP) complex,
  in turn reducing cholesterol biosynthesis. Oxysterols enhance this process by binding
  to Insig-1/2 (insulin-induced gene-1 or -2). Excess cholesterol is esterified via
  Acyl CoA: Cholesterol Acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1), and stored in lipid droplets within
  the cytoplasm as “foamy” droplets. nCEH: Neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase; FC:
  Free cholesterol; CE: Cholesteryl ester: NPC-1/NPC-2: Niemann-Pick C1/C2 protein;
