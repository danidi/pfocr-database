caption: MNT and its place in the MAX-MLX network of interacting proteins. Through
  its interaction with both MAX and MLX, MNT is positioned to compete with both MLXIP/MLXIP1
  and MYC family proteins for interaction with MLX and MAX respectively, and for binding
  to shared target genes. Whereas MYC and MLXIP complexes promote transcription, MNT
  complexes repress transcription. Chromatin is depicted to indicate histone modifications
  and architecture that acts to promote transcription (green marks, relaxed conformation,
  MYC-MAX and MXLIP/1-MLX) or repress transcription (red marks, closed conformation,
  MNT-MAX, MNT-MLX). MXD-MAX, MXD-MLX and MGA-MAX complexes also repress transcription
  and may function in concert with MNT complexes to antagonize transcription by MYC
  and MLXIP complexes and fine-tune the expression of shared target genes. For MNT,
  its abundance can be downregulated by hypoxia and specifically through the inhibitory
  mRNA binding by miR-210 which is strongly induced by hypoxia. MNT can also be downregulated
  by the ubiquitin ligase E6AP. The effect of mitogenic signaling on MNT appears variable,
  with evidence that MNT is significantly increased in settings of sustained proliferation,
  but that in the setting of growth-factor-induced cell cycle entry, phosphorylation
  of MNT by ERK acting downstream in the MAPK pathway transiently interferes with
  MNT binding to SIN3 corepressors and its ability to antagonize transcription by
  MYC. See text for additional details.
