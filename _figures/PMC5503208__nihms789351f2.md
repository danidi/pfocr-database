caption: (A) Molecular mechanisms of dietary fat absorption within enterocytes. Triacylglycerol
  (TAG) is hydrolyzed in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract by lipases, generating
  fatty acids (FAs) and 2- monoacylglycerol (MAG). These digestive products are taken
  up by enterocytes. The FAs are primarily activated to fatty acyl-CoAs by acyl-CoA
  synthetase (ACS) activity and utilized for TAG re-synthesis through the acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol
  acyltransferase (MGAT) pathway. The first step involves the synthesis of diacylglycerol
  (DAG) from 2-MAG and a fatty acyl-CoA by MGAT activity. The second, final step involves
  the synthesis of TAG from DAG and a fatty acyl-CoA by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase
  (DGAT) activity. The synthesized TAG within ER membrane bilayer is trafficked towards
  either the cytoplasm for cytoplasmic lipid droplet (CLD) synthesis or the ER lumen
  for chylomicron (CM synthesis). (B) Mechanism and proteins involved in CM synthesis.
  CMs are made by a two-step pathway within the ER. The first step is the synthesis
  of primordial CMs, as neutral lipids are packaged on apolipoprotein B48 (ApoB48).
  The second step is the expansion of the CM core by adding neutral lipids from ApoB-free
  lumenal lipid droplets (LLDs). The activity of microsomal triglyceride transfer
  protein (MTP) is essential for the synthesis of primordial CMs and for CM growth
  in the ER lumen. Pre-CMs exit the ER and are transported to the Golgi for further
  processing via a prechylomicron transport vesicle (PCTV) containing a coat protein
  complex II (COPII). SAR1B, one of the core components of COPII complex, initiates
  PCTV budding from ER and directs PCTV to Golgi. CMs are eventually released from
  the basolateral side of the enterocyte by Golgi-derived secretory vesicles. (C)
  Mechanisms and proteins involved in enterocyte CLD synthesis and growth. The most
  accepted model of CLD synthesis is budding of excess TAG from the smooth ER membrane
  bilayer with specific proteins involved in the process. Multiple proteins are identified
  on CLDs and shown to mediate local CLD growth. Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase
  2 (LPCAT2) synthesizes phosphatidylcholine, MGAT2 synthesizes DAG, and ACSLs synthesize
  fatty acyl-CoAs, providing lipids substrates for CLD growth. PLINs stabilize CLD
  structure. Cell death inducing DFF45-like effector B (CIDEB), fat storage-inducing
  transmembrane protein 2 (FIT2) and ATLASTIN-1 are also shown to regulate CLD size.
  (D) Mechanisms and proteins involved in enterocyte CLD catabolism. Cytoplasmic lipolysis
  and lipophagy are two identified mechanisms of CLD catabolism. The lipases contributing
  to these two pathways are present in enterocytes. In cytoplasmic lipolysis, adipocyte
  triglyceride lipase (ATGL) (with its co-activator comparative gene identification-58
  (CGI-58)), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), and MAG lipase (MGL) sequentially cleave
  FAs from the glycerol backbone of TAG by hydrolyzing ester bonds. In lipophagy,
  CLDs are selectively targeted and sequestered within autophagosomes and then transported
  to the lysosome where they are hydrolyzed by lysosome acidic lipase (LAL). The FAs
  released from CLDs in enterocytes may serve as substrates for re-esterification
  of TAG, PL, and CE for secretion on lipoproteins or membrane synthesis, fatty acid
  oxidation (FAO), or serve roles as signaling molecules.
