caption: 'Left: epidermal wounding initiates a first influx of Ca2+ within the cells
  through the TRPM channel Gtl-2. A subsequent molecular cascade involving the phospholipase
  Cβ Egl-8 and its regulatory Gαq protein Egl-30 leads to the release of Ca2+ stored
  in the endoplasmic reticulum through the IP3 receptor Itr-1, increasing the intracellular
  concentration in Ca2+. The Cdc-42 GTPase could be activated by the increase in intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration and promotes wound closure by actin polymerization through the
  regulation of actin nucleation factors (Wsp-1/WASP and Arx-2/Arp2/3). On the contrary,
  Ca2+ mediated Rho-1 GTPase activation could inhibit F-actin polymerization, either
  by directly inactivating Cdc-42, or by promoting actomyosin cable formation by the
  intermediary of non-muscle myosin regulation. The increase in intracellular Ca2+
  level also activates ROS production by the Bli-3 dual oxydase. The increase in ROS
  and the Cst-1/MST1 protein are responsible for the translocation of the Daf-16/FOXO
  transcription factor in the nucleus where it will regulate the expression of innate
  immunity genes. The released Ca2+ also enters the mitochondria via the mitochondrial
  Ca2+ uniporter Mcu-1 and triggers the mtROS release by opening the mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore mPTP. The released mtROS inhibits the Rho-1 GTPase,
  thereby promoting the F-actin mediated wound closure. Right: Following damage to
  the cuticle, an increase in the HPLA ligand triggers the activation of the G-protein
  coupled receptor Dcar-1. The Gα protein Gap-12 and Rack-1 and the Egl-8 and Plc-3
  C-type phospholipases subsequently activate a signal transduction pathway consisting
  of the two protein kinases C Tpa-1 and Pkc-3, the Tir-1/SARM protein, and the Pmk-1/p38
  MAP kinase cascade. The Snf-12 and Sta-2 transcription factors act downstream of
  this pathway to activate the AMPs genes. The Dapk-1 calcium-calmodulin kinase is
  an inhibitor of the molecular response to epidermal wounding, acting upstream of
  the Tir-1/p38 signaling cascade and on the the F-actin mediated wound closure pathway.
