caption: 'The RAS/MAP kinase signaling pathway. A growth factor binds to its cognate
  receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), along with a transductive complex, which then activates
  RAS through an exchange of GTP for bound GDP. Active RAS then recruits inactive
  cytosolic BRAF to the membrane and activates BRAF. Active BRAF in turn phosphorylates
  MEK thereby activating this MAPK kinase to phosphorylate and activate the ERKs.
  Active ERK then translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates and regulates
  transcription factors, such as ELK. BRAF is mutated in about 60% of melanomas while
  NRAS is mutated in an additional 20%; the two events are functionally overlapping
  and thus genetically exclusive. The RTK, KIT, is mutated or amplified in about 40%
  of acral and mucosal melanomas. The various inhibitors are shown in red boxes.Abbreviations:
  MM, malignant melanoma; NM, nodular melanoma; SSM, superficial spreading melanoma.'
