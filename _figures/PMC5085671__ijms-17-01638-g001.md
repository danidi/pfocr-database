caption: Schematic representation of the DNA damage response (DDR). Cells are constantly
  exposed to various environmental or endogenous genotoxic agents. Through the DDR
  pathway, the DNA damage is recognized by sensor protein complexes. The accumulation
  of DNA damage provokes various cellular events, including cell cycle arrest, DNA
  repair, cellular senescence, or cell death. The DDR plays a key role in the genomic
  stability that protects cells from tumorgenesis. UV, ultraviolet; IR, ionizing radiation;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species.
