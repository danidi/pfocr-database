caption: Mechanisms of estrogen-induced resistance and signaling of its receptors.
  (A) Control of the cell cycle. ER functions as a transcription factor to regulate
  p53 expression, in addition ER can physically interact with p53 to inhibit p53 function.
  Moreover, it signals through the c-Src kinase and switches on the PI3K and Ras/MAPK
  pathways to promote activation of Cyclin D and release the p27 repressor from the
  nucleus to promote cell cycle progression. (B) Inhibition of apoptosis ER functions
  as a transcription factor to induce the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein
  Bcl2 and functions as a transcriptional co-repressor of Bad to inhibit its synthesis.
  Furthermore, mERα associates with c-Src, to activate the PI3k/Akt pathway, Akt phosphorylates
  Bad to preclude the formation of Bad/Bad homodimer and block the release of cytochrome
  C and thus the process of apoptosis. (C) Cellular plasticity promotes TEM. E2 diffuses
  through the plasma membrane binds to mER, induces phosphorylation of c-Src, its
  associated with ZO1, and forms the p-Src/ZO-1 complex, that favors the dissociation
  of the Tight Junctions and promotes that ZO1 and ZONAB are translocated to the nucleus,
  inducing the transcription of HER-2, which triggers EMT and migration of tumor cells.
