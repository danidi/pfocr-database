caption: The designed 1,2,4-butanetriol (BT) biosynthetic pathway from malate were
  divided into two modules at the junction of 2,4-dihydroxybutyrate (DHB). In module
  1, one of the terminal carboxyl groups of malate was firstly activated with CoA
  and then reduced to an aldehyde group, and then further reduced to a hydroxyl group,
  to yield DHB. Similarly, the other terminal carboxyl group of DHB was reduced to
  a hydroxyl group to yield the final product BT in module 2. The standard Gibbs free
  energy change of every reaction (reaction delta G) was shown in the left designed
  pathway, which was the difference of standard Gibbs free energy of formation (formation
  delta G) between products and substrates in the right every equation. This artificial
  six-step pathway was thermodynamically feasible as the sum of reaction delta G from
  six reactions was negative (−15 kcal/mol).
