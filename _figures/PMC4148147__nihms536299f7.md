caption: Endosomal TLR7 in pDCs can bind single-stranded RNA (including, but not limited
  to viral genomes), and trigger a MyD88 dependent kinase cascade that leads to the
  activation of IRF7. The kinases IRAK1 and IKKα are the kinases that directly phosphorylate
  IRF7, which then translocates to the nucleus to bind the IFN promotors. pDC can
  produce IFN rapidly and in large quantities due in part to 1) the ability of the
  sensor (TLR7) to detect pathogen associated molecules even in the absence of viral
  replication, and 2) the constitutive expression of IRF7.Cytosolic RIG-I binds to
  ssRNA or dsRNA with 5′-triphosphates, most likely the product of viral transcription,
  leading to the activation of the IRF3/7 kinases TBK1 and IKKε. RIG-I can also trigger
  IFN production in response to double-stranded RNA, a structure that may exist as
  part of viral replication. Prior to infection, cDC do not express IRF7 until IFN
  (produced either by the cDC itself in response to viral infection, or by neighboring
  cells) triggers its production. Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF7
  thus occurs several hours after viral infection.When a virus encoding VP35 infects
  cDCs, the time required by the virus to synthesize the protein allows the immune
  cell to produce IFN and begin the synthesis of ISGs, including IRF7. Once expressed,
  VP35 inhibits the kinase activity of IKKε or TBK1, preventing the activation of
  IRF7. It is also possible that VP35 interferes with the interaction between viral
  RNA and RIG-I, preventing the detection of viral infection. The failure of VP35
  to suppress IFN production from pDCs could be due to its inability to inhibit IKKα
  or IRAK1.
