caption: Mechanism of DNA damage induced dispersal of the Golgi. In response to DNA
  damage, DNA-PK is activated and phosphorylates GOLPH3 on the T143 TQ motif. This
  phosphorylation results in increased GOLPH3 interaction with MYO18A and consequently
  an increased tensile force on the Golgi, leading to Golgi vesiculation, fragmentation,
  and dispersal. The DNA-PK/GOLPH3/MYO18A pathway is required for cell survival following
  DNA damage, and overexpression of GOLPH3 confers resistance to killing by DNA damaging
  agents.
