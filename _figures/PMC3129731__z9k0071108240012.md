caption: Model of PMn mechanisms of stability and plasticity. PMn spontaneous activity
  is regulated by a serial interaction between conventional and atypical PKCs (represented
  by thin arrows). The activity of both PKCs is maintained in an unsaturated state.
  During the jamming avoidance response, NMDAR activation leads to an influx of Ca2+,
  biasing the activity of conventional PKC isoforms and ultimately leading to the
  phosphorylation of target proteins involved in LTFE. The same Ca2+ signal activates
  the calmodulin/calcineurin pathway, gradually leading to the dephosphorylation of
  proteins targeted by PKCs and ultimately reducing the PMn firing rate to basal levels.
  DAG, diacylglycerol.
