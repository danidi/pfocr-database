caption: 'Fig. 1. A representation of the metabolic pathway displaying the enzymatic
  interconversions and structures of plant sphingolipids. Known yeast gene orthologues
  are listed in parentheses following abbreviated enzyme designations. Plant genes
  predicted to be involved in sphingolipid metabolism are not shown but are described
  in the text. Enzymatic steps modifying long‐chain bases and amide‐linked acyl chains
  via hydroxylation and/or desaturation are thought to utilize ceramide, glucosylceramide
  or inositolphosphorylceramide as substrate, but acyl‐chain elongation precedes ceramide
  formation, and the hydroxylation of free sphinganine has been demonstrated. Inositolphosphorylceramide
  is thought to be the precursor to complex glycophosphosphingolipids but the glycosyltransferases
  presumably required have not been identified. In addition to free sphinganine (d18:0)
  and 4‐hydroxysphinganine (t18:0, phytosphingosine), other long‐chain bases present
  in plants include cis and trans isomers of 8‐sphingenine (d18:1Δ8), 4,8‐sphingadienine
  (d18:2Δ4,8) and 4‐hydroxy‐8‐sphingenine (t18:1Δ8), shown here as constituents of
  ceramide, glucosylceramide and inositolphosphorylceramide, respectively. Sphingosine
  (d18:1Δ4trans, 4‐sphingenine) is shown as the phosphorylated derivative. The acyl
  chain amide‐linked in the ceramide shown is a nonhydroxy saturated C24 chain (lignocerate),
  whereas that of inositolphosphorylceramide and glucosylceramide is the α‐hydroxylated
  counterpart. Enzyme abbreviations: CERase, ceramidase; GCase, glucosylceramidase;
  GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; IPCS, inositolphophorylceramide synthase; KSR, 3‐ketosphinganine
  reductase; LCBK, long‐chain base kinase; LCBPL; long‐chain base‐phosphate lyase;
  LCBPP, long‐chain base‐phosphate phosphatase; PLC, phospholipase C; SAT, sphinganine
  acyltransferase; SH, sphinganine hydroxylase; SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase.'
