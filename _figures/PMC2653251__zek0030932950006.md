caption: 'Summary. Upstream activation: a resting conidium senses environmental nutrients
  by an unknown signaling mechanism, ultimately leading to activation of adenylate
  cyclase and production of cAMP. PKA activation: binding of cAMP to PkaR leads to
  release and activation of PKA catalytic subunits. Downstream effects: phosphorylation
  of downstream targets leads to metabolic and cell cycle activation. Phenotypic outcome:
  metabolic activation leads to swelling and increased susceptibility to oxidative
  stress. In a ΔpkaR mutant, PKA is constitutively active, leading to these phenotypes
  in the absence of an extracellular trigger (i.e., nutrients). Also, in the mutant
  unregulated nuclear division leads to an increased accumulation of hyphal nuclei.
  It is possible that PKA lies upstream of only one branch, while an unknown pathway
  connects the two (dashed line).'
