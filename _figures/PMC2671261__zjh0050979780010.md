caption: Hypothesis for the regulation, by CCN3, of CCN2 and collagen in fibrosis.
  Solid arrows show the current paradigm for up-regulation of ECM accumulation and
  fibrosis by TGF-β and CCN2. Dashed arrows show the pathway identified in the present
  work. Red arrows depict the effect (positive or negative) of the molecule on the
  further downstream elements. Currently unknown are factors that may induce endogenous
  CCN3 in renal disease or fibrosis.
