caption: Proposed model of the induction of endothelial proinflammatory response and
  barrier dysfunction by P. falciparum histones. Parasite histones from merozoites
  are released in the proximity of endothelial cells during schizogony of cytoadherent
  IRBCs, where they exert a disruptive effect on endothelial barrier function through
  a charge-related mechanism. In addition, parasite histones activate TLR2 and other
  innate receptors, leading to the induction of inflammatory mediators through a signaling
  pathway involving the Src family kinases and p38 MAPK. The pathological effect of
  parasite histones may be further amplified by the release of host histones and other
  endogenous mediators from dying cells. The proinflammatory activity of both plasmodial
  and human histones can be inhibited by rhAPC.
