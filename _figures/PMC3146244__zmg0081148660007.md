caption: Model of the DHEA's effects on in the ESC. Increased levels of DHEA, either
  due to adrenal overproduction in PCOS or exogenous administration, leads, first,
  to inhibition of stromal cell proliferation in the estrogen-driven proliferative
  phase of the menstrual cycle. DHEA additionally leads to a decrease in decidualization
  of ESC during the secretory phase of the cycle by inhibiting G6PD activity, the
  rate-limiting enzyme in the PPP. Taken together, DHEA inhibits the progression of
  ESC through both phases of the cycle and has a dual mechanism of preventing the
  differentiation of the endometrial stromal compartment toward a receptive state,
  capable of supporting embryo implantation.
