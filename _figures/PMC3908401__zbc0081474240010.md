caption: The first steps of the PQ biosynthetic pathway in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis
  sp. in comparison to ubiquinone biosynthesis in the proteobacterium E. coli and
  PQ biosynthesis in the higher plant A. thaliana. The dashed arrows indicate that
  further hydroxylation and methylation reaction steps are required for ubiquinone
  and PQ biosynthesis.
