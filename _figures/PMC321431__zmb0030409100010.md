caption: Cascade of transcription factors that induce stress gene expression in response
  to eIF2α phosphorylation. In response to ER stress, eIF2α phosphorylation by PEK
  induces ATF4 expression, which is required for increased expression of ATF3 and
  other stress genes. ATF3 is required for increased levels of GADD34, which directs
  the type 1 protein phosphatase (PP1) to dephosphorylate eIF2. ER stress is also
  recognized by membrane-associated ATF6 and IRE1, which function to activate the
  UPR, including GRP78 expression. ATF6 and IRE1 are proposed to work in conjunction
  with the eIF2 kinase stress pathway to enhance the expression of many stress genes,
  including CHOP/GADD153 and ATF3. During nutritional stress, the eIF2 kinase GCN2
  induces the sequential expression of bZIP transcription factors ATF4, ATF3, and
  CHOP. ATF3 contributes to increased GADD34 expression, which contributes to feedback
  dephosphorylation of eIF2. Transcriptional activation by ATF3 may be indirect through
  protein-protein interactions. ATF4 is suggested to directly regulate stress gene
  expression during nutrient limitation. Analysis of MEF cells carrying a deletion
  of ATF2 indicate that this bZIP transcription factor is also required for CHOP expression
  in response to amino acid deprivation ().
