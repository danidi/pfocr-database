caption: Cetuximab resistance is characterized by increased AXL mRNA and protein expression,
  EGFR activation, and MAPK pathway signaling. In CtxR cells, increased EGFR ligand
  (L) production leads to AXL and EGFR association and transactivation. This results
  in MAPK and c-Jun signaling and subsequent increases in AXL transcription. Increases
  in AXL mRNA result in elevated AXL protein levels and maintenance of EGFR activation
  and signaling. This positive feedback loop results in the constitutive activation
  of both AXL and EGFR in CtxR cells and thereby mediates cetuximab resistance.
