caption: 'Synthesis of Dihydrotestosterone via the Classic and Alternative (Backdoor)
  PathwaysThe classic pathway of steroidogenesis leading to dihydrotestosterone is
  shown on the left, and the alternative pathway is shown on the right. The factors
  in the classic pathway are CYP11A1 (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, P450scc),
  StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase,
  P450c17), HSD3B2 (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, type 2), HSD17B3 (17β-HSD3 [17β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase, type 3] and 5α-reductase, type 2 [5a-reductase 2, encoded by SRD5A2]).
  The alternative pathway is characterized by the presence of additional enzymes:
  5α-reductase, type 1 (5a-reductase 1, encoded by SRD5A1), AKR1C2 3 (3α-reductase,
  type 3) and possibly AKR1C4 (3α-reductase, type 1) and RoDH (3-hydroxyepimerase,
  encoded by HSD17B6). Most steroids are identified by their trivial names; 17-hydroxy-dihydroprogesterone
  (17OH-DHP) is 5α-pregnane-17α-ol-3,20-dione; 17-hydroxy-allopregnanolone (17OH-allo)
  is 5α-pregnan-3α,17α-diol-20-one; 5α-dihydroprogesterone (5α-DHP) is 5α-pregnane-3,20-dione,
  and allopregnanolone is 3α-hydroxy-dihydroprogesterone (3α-OH-DHP) or 5α-pregnane-3α-ol-20-one.'
