caption: Proposed GC-C signaling in colitis. Direction of filled arrows in frames
  indicates significantly down- or up-regulated expression of genes encoding transcription
  factors, GC-C, GC-C ligands (GN and UGN) or cGMP downstream mediators in IBD (blue)
  and TNBS colitis (red). Down-regulation of transcription factors leads to reduced
  synthesis of GN (and UGN), which both act in a paracrine, luminocrine and autocrine
  manner, and reduced synthesis of GC-C, with subsequent decreased intracellular cGMP
  generation. Reduced cGMP and down-regulation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase II
  (PKGII) reduce phosphorylation of CFTR and diminish chloride efflux. In addition
  bicarbonate efflux through an unknown channel decreases. The ion channels CFTR and
  sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE) are also down-regulated. These processes have implications
  for fluid and ion homeostasis. Both lower cGMP levels and down-regulation of cyclic
  nucleotide-gated channels (CNG) lead to diminished calcium influx and calcium-sensing
  receptor (CaR) signaling, with reduced anti-proliferative effects as a consequence
  []. cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase (PDE5) which facilitates conversion of cGMP
  to GMP is down-regulated in IBD and up-regulated in TNBS colitis. cGMP is transported
  through the basolateral cell membrane, possibly by multidrug-resistance transporter
  (MRP) 5. Reduced availability of cGMP in the lamina propria and submucosa could
  hamper inhibition of nociceptors. The figure was adapted and modified from Basu
  et al. and Fiskerstrand et al. [].
