caption: Figure 3. Network analysis of genes under-expressed in MCF-7/MET-R cells
  that have acquired resistance to metformin. A data set containing the differentially
  downregulated genes (called the focus molecules = 366) between metformin-refractory
  MCF-7/MET-R cells and metformin-sensitive MCF-7 parental cells was overlaid onto
  a global molecular network developed from information contained in the Ingenuity
  Pathway (IPA) Knowledge Base. Networks of these focus molecules were then algorithmically
  generated based on their connectivity. The figure shows downregulated networks with
  the 5 highest IPA scores (a composite measure that indicates the statistically significance
  of the interconnection between the molecules depicted in the network). The focus
  molecules are colored according to the gene expression (fold-change). The nodes
  are displayed using various shapes that represent the functional class of the gene
  product. Edges with dashed lines indicate indirect interactions, while continuous
  lines represent direct interactions.
