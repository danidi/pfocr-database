caption: Based on experimental data GDS3634, miR-205 expression effect on prostate
  cancer cell line, from NCBI public database browser, P value of 8 samples of Student's
  t-test, microarray data was applied as the link cost for predicted paths. Searched
  on the pathway bridge that has been enriched through prostate cancer pathways, the
  top 10 out of 88 forecasted paths were picked for further biological meaning verification
  (Supplementary Table 1.2). One reasonable forecast shown in  was miR205- PRKCE-
  CNA13- CDH1- PTPN14-OCIAD2. High correlated genes with OCIAD2 were distinguished
  as dashed lines (red for positive correlation and green for negative correlation).
  PRKCE, as one of the six target genes of miR205, was marked as the green box. Among
  the pathway bridge that consisted of protein nodes (dashed circles) and proteins'
  interactions (green lines), a shortest protein path with least DES cost was emphasized
  by red lines.
