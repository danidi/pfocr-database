caption: Calcium overload is the important target of treating myocardial ischemia/reperfusion
  (MI/R) injury. The maintenance of calcium homeostasis requires the participation
  of multiple regulatory proteins including LTCC, RyR2, SERCA, NCX, PLB, FKBP12.6,
  and CaMK II. When MI/R occurs, calcium homeostasis will be broken and further developed
  into calcium overload. Calcium overload further exacerbates MI/R injury. Therefore,
  inhibiting calcium overload is an effective way to reduce MI/R injury. These drugs
  currently on the market or under investigation including adenosine, ridogrel, vorapaxar,
  metoprolol, flunarizine, and zoniporide hydrochloride, are for the treatment of
  MI/R injury or have the potential to treat MI/R injury. These drugs can play a cardioprotective
  role by regulating the calcium signaling pathway.
