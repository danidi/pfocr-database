caption: (A) The pathway of N-glycosylation in eukaryotic cells is depicted. N-glycan
  synthesis is initiated in the outer endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane leaflet
  on a dolichol-P-phosphate facing the cytoplasm. Flipping of the precursor N-glycan
  to the ER luminal leaflet and further synthesis steps mediated by ALG proteins leads
  to eventual transfer of a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 N-glycan to a substrate by the oligosaccharyl
  transferase complex. ALG6 (red lettering) catalyzes the transfer of the initial
  glucose onto the Man9 precursor N-glycan. (B) In wild-type (WT) cells, a Glc3Man9GlcNAc2
  N-glycan is transferred to substrates. Monoglucosylated substrates may therefore
  occur via trimming by glucosidases I/II (GlsI/II) or reglucosylation by UGGT1/2.
  In ALG6-/- cells, a Man9GlcNAc2 N-glycan is transferred to substrates. Therefore,
  monoglucosylated substrates may only occur through reglucosylation by UGGT1/2. Deoxynojirimycin
  (500 μM) was added to block the trimming of monoglucosylated substrates by GlsII.
  ALG6-/- cells were then lysed and split equally between affinity purifications with
  either GST-CRT or GST-CRT-Y109A bound to glutathione beads. Affinity-purified samples
  were then reduced, alkylated, trypsinized, and labeled with tandem mass tag (TMT)
  labels. Samples were then deglycosylated with PNGaseF, pooled, and analyzed by mass
  spectrometry. (C) Substrates were identified by dividing the quantification of the
  TMT label in the GST-CRT condition for each protein by that of the associated GST-CRT-Y109A
  condition, yielding the fold increase. Localization as predicted by UniprotKB annotation
  is depicted. A cutoff of threefold increase was applied. Data is representative
  of two independent experiments. Error bars represent standard error of the mean
  (SEM). (D) The N-glycoproteome (N-glycopro) was computationally determined by collecting
  all proteins annotated to contain N-glycans by UniprotKB. Annotated localization
  information was then used to computationally determine the localization distribution
  of the N-glycoproteome as well as the identified UGGT substrates.Figure 1—source
