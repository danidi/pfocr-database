caption: Schematic diagram that gintonin-mediated in vitro cellular effects through
  LPA receptors in neurons and astrocytes is linked to in vivo pharmacological effects.
  The primary action of gintonin produces second messenger Ca2+ via LPA receptor activations
  and regulates Ca2+-dependent to various ion channels and receptors regulations,
  and glio-transmitter and neuro-transmitter release. The ensuing inter-cellular communications
  via the released neurotransmitters (i.e., acetylcholine or glutamate) can be related
  to the pharmacological effects that can finally be linked to improvement of learning
  and memory in nervous system (). Gintonin also exhibits pharmacological effect against
  Alzheimer’s disease by attenuating β-amyloid plaque formation and by ameliorating
  cognitive dysfunction via the activation of non-amyloidogenic pathway and by restoring
  cholinergic systems that were damaged by β-amyloid in transgenic Alzheimer’s disease
  animal model (; ). In astrocytes, gintonin-mediated ATP and glutamate release can
  be coupled to regulations of neuronal activity (). In addition, gintonin as exogenous
  LPA induces various cellular effects such as migration and proliferation of cells
  as LPAs do through LPA receptor activations. Gintonin also exhibits anti-metastasis
  activity via inhibition of autotaxin (ATX) activity. ACh, acetylcholine; AChE, acetylcholine
  esterase; sAPPα, soluble amyloid precursor protein α; ATX, autotaxin; ChAT, choline
  acetyltransferase; Glu, glutamate.
