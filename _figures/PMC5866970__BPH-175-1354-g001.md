caption: Components of the Hippo/YAP pathway. When the Hippo pathway is activated,
  YAP/TAZ is phosphorylated by LATS1/2 on serine residues, which leads to its cytoplasmic
  retention, degradation and nuclear exclusion. Inactivation of YAP/TAZ affects the
  activity of transcription factors that control proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.
