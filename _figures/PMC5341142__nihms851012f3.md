caption: Active PDGF-CC ligand can be targeted with neutralising antibodies to prevent
  receptor binding. In similar fashion ligand binding to PDGFR-α can be prevented
  by antibodies targeting the extracellular domains of the receptor. PDGFR-α intracellular
  domain phosphorylation and signaling activity can be reduced with tyrosine kinase
  inhibitors. For detailed description see .
