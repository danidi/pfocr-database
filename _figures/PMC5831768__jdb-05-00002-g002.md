caption: Non-canonical Shh signaling in commissural axon guidance. In vivo and in
  vitro studies have implicated Shh in commissural axon guidance. Shh is attractive
  for pre-crossing but repulsive for post-crossing commissural axons. On pre-crossing
  commissural axons Shh binds to Boc (Brother of Cdo) and Ptc1 (Patched1), thus de-repressing
  Smo (Smoothened). However, in contrast to canonical signaling (see ), binding of
  Shh results in the phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs). Shh itself induces
  expression of Hhip (Hedgehog-interacting protein), its receptor for post-crossing
  axon navigation, by binding to Glypican1 (Gpc1) and Ptc1. The de-repression of Smo
  results in transcription of Hhip via the canonical signaling pathway. How Shh binding
  to Hhip on post-crossing commissural axons mediates repulsion is not yet known.
  In vitro (lower panel), protein 14-3-3 levels have been linked to the transition
  from attraction to repulsion. Pre-crossing axons initially express low levels of
  protein 14-3-3 (left). High levels of 14-3-3 were required for the repulsive response
  to Shh (right). It is unknown how 14-3-3 is linked to the precise switch from attraction
  to repulsion. Protein 14-3-3 can reduce the activity of PKA (Protein Kinase A),
  but no changes in the levels of cAMP were found between pre- and post-crossing axons.
  Furthermore, it is unknown if (and which) surface receptors could be linked to the
  function of protein 14-3-3.
