caption: 'Hypothetical summary of the proposed events occurring in tissue injected
  with B. asper venom. (A) Venom toxins, particularly snake venom metalloproteinases
  (SVMPs), PLA2s and hyaluronidases, induce direct damage to the tissue, especially
  acute muscle fiber necrosis and degradation of extracellular matrix components,
  such as those of the basement membrane of capillary vessels, and other matrix molecules,
  including hyaluronic acid. Acute inflammation ensues, with the release of many types
  of mediators that promote an increase in vascular permeability, recruitment of inflammatory
  cells, and pain. Such acute tissue damage is also associated with the release of
  multiple damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), both intracellular
  and extracellular; (B) DAMPs act on a variety of cells, including endothelial cells,
  other resident cells, and incoming inflammatory leucocytes, to generate diverse
  tissue responses, such as increase in vascular permeability, and the synthesis of
  a variety of cytokines and chemokines, which further contribute to the inflammatory
  scenario in a highly complex interplay. ROS: Reactive oxygen species; LCs: leukotrienes;
  PGs: prostaglandins; NO: Nitric oxide.'
