caption: 'The JNK pathway is a kinase cascade that, when activated in Drosophila,
  leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factors JRA (Jun-related antigen)
  and KAY (Kayak). puckered (puc) is a transcriptional target of the JNK pathway and
  acts in a negative feedback loop to dampen JNK signaling. The activation of this
  cascade also leads to the transcriptional activation of the pro-apoptotic gene rpr
  that in turns leads to the degradation of the anti-apoptotic factor DIAP1, which
  activates caspases such as DRONC/Caspase 9 and its specific co-factor DARK/Apaf-1,
  DRICE/Caspase 3 and Death Caspase-1 (DCP-1) resulting in the onset of apoptosis.
  Although reaper does not have a direct human homolog, mammalian Smac/DIABLO was
  shown to be a functional homolog of Reaper/Hid/Grim, that acts by reducing c-IAP
  protein levels through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway . Two JNKKs, HEP and MKK4,
  phorphorylate the JNK/BSK at different sites. These are phosphorylated by several
  Drosophila JNKKKs, among which SLPR and dTAK1, the latter being a target for phosphorylation
  by MSN. DTRAF1 and DTRAF2 are intracellular proteins known to activate JNKKKs. TAK1-associated
  binding protein 2 (dTAB2) is an adaptator protein linking dTRAF1 to dTAK1. The ligand-receptor
  interaction between EGR/WGN (TNF/TNFR) has been shown to induce JNK pathway-mediated
  apoptosis. Yellow stars: phosphorylation activity of the kinases. Blue, pink and
  violet lines: negative regulators (DIAP1 overexpression, and PUC and P35 expression
  negatively regulate DTRAF1, BSK and effector caspase activities, respectively).
  Wide blue arrows: lacZ reporter transgenes. The dotted arrows 1 and 2 indicate the
  candidate targets of Vpu suggested by this work.'
