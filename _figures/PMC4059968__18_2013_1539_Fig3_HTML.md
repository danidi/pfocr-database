caption: 'Pyruvate dysmetabolism in cancer. Pyruvate metabolism and carbon flux is
  altered in many cancer cells. Arrows show the relative carbon flux through different
  metabolic pathways in cancer (gray portion of the large arrows) and in normal cells
  (black portion of the large arrows). Generally, cancer cells upregulate glycolysis
  and the pentose phosphate pathway and downregulate the citric acid cycle and oxidative
  phosphorylation. Modulators of cancer metabolism include: HIF1, which upregulates
  transcription of MCT1, LDHA, and PDK1; p53, which downregulates glycolysis by transcriptional
  induction of Mir-34A and TIGAR, upregulates oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos),
  and is typically silenced in cancer; and dimeric PKM2, which impairs pyruvate production
  and therefore OxPhos and also causes accumulation of glycolytic intermediates and
  increased biosynthetic carbon flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  Finally, several therapeutics and their effects are shown: 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)
  and 3-bromopyruvate directly inhibit glycolytic enzymes thereby decreasing aerobic
  glycolysis. DCA inhibits PDK thereby activating PDH and increasing citric acid cycle
  flux and oxidative phosphorylation. HK hexokinase, PPP pentose phosphate pathway,
  DCA dichloroacetate, 2-DG 2-deoxyglucose, TIGAR tp53 induced glycolysis and apoptosis
