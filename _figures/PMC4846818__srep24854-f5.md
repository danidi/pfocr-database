caption: PRRSV infection downregulates the expression of ssc-miR-30d_R-1 (targets
  TLR4), which activates the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in promotion
  of PRRSV replication. Conversely, overexpression of the ssc-miR-30d_R-1 mimic inhibits
  TLR4, which inhibits the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in reduced
  PRRSV replication.
