caption: Overview of the effects of VitA in gut-associated lymphoid tissue. (A) Insufficient
  VitA can cause Treg imbalance with excess Th1 and insufficient Th2 function. (B)
  On the other hand, when there are elevated levels of VitA, enhanced development
  of Th2 cells via RXR pathway promotion occurs. (C) When there are normal physiological
  levels, homeostatic functions of VitA are present in tissue. The pre- or proforms
  of VitA found in food are absorbed by intestinal epithelial cells and esterified
  with fatty acids forming less toxic derivatives, which are further transported to
  liver for storage. Dietary retinol is also directly converted to the biologically
  active ATRA, the major VitA metabolite, by gut-associated lymphoid tissue DCs. This
  process is enhanced by TLR2/6-mediated effects of probiotics to induce Raldh2, which
  is important in conversion of VitA derivatives (VitAd) to ATRA. ATRA can convert
  naive FoxP3−CD4+ T cells into unique, tissue-specific FoxP3+ Tregs. TGF-β exerts
  synergistic effect on this process. Histone acetylation at the FoxP3 gene promoter
  is induced upon binding of ATRA to the nuclear retinoic acid receptor α (RARα),
  which as a consequence, leads to the prolonged expression of FoxP3 protein in CD4+
  T cells and stability of Tregs. The resulting Tregs can efficiently suppress effector
  T cells and show an additional upregulation of the mucosal tissue-homing receptors
  CCR9 and integrin β7. GALT, gut-associated lymphoid tissue; RARE, retinoic acid
  response element.
