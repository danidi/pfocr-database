caption: Comparison of the humoral and neuronal hypotheses for fever induction. According
  to the humoral hypothesis of fever induction, the pyrogenic cytokines IL-1, IL-6,
  and TNF-α gain access to the hypothalamus via fenestrations in the blood–brain barrier
  in the circumventricular organs or via active transport mechanisms mediated by the
  cells surrounding the hypothalamus. A key feature of the humoral hypothesis is that
  the pyrogenic cytokines activate the febrile response indirectly by inducing local
  endothelial cells or microglial cells to secrete prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The PGE2
  then acts via PGE receptor 3 to initiate a neuronal response that regulates the
  body temperature. According to the neuronal hypothesis, C5a stimulates PGE2 production
  in the liver and signaling to the hypothalamus occurs via a neural pathway mediated
  by the vagus nerve and the nucleus tractus solitarius.” [Reproduced with permission
