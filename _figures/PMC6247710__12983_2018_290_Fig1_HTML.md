caption: The outline of the molecular pathways in the fat body and prothoracic gland
  (PG) implicated in ecdysone-mediated body growth and size determination. In the
  fat body, amino acids (AAs) transported via the Slimfast (Slif) transporter stimulate
  the activity of target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling. Drosophila insulin-like peptides
  (dILPs) bind to and activate the insulin receptor (InR), thereby increasing the
  activity of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway. Activation
  of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) by ecdysone binding inhibits the expression of miR-8,
  thereby activating the expression of U-shaped (Ush), an inhibitor of IIS. Activated
  EcR also represses Myc, activated by TOR signaling. Through these pathways, ecdysone
  suppresses IIS/TOR activity, thereby attenuating the rate of body growth. In the
  PG, activated IIS suppresses bantam, a repressor of the expression of ecdysone biosynthetic
  genes. FOXO, which is suppressed by IIS, binds to ultraspiracle (Usp) thereby inhibiting
  the expression ecdysone biosynthetic genes. PTTH peptides released from the axon
  terminals of PTTH-expressing neurons acts on Torso, the PTTH receptor, which activates
  MAPK signaling cascades, thereby activating ecdysone generation. Activated InR or
  Torso also stimulates Warts (Wts), which in turn represses the activity of bantam
  and Yorki (Yki), thereby controlling ecdysone synthesis. TOR signaling activated
  by a protein-rich diet promotes ecdysone generation. Torso is also expressed in
  the fat body, stimulating IIS/TOR. The ligands acting on Torso in the fat body are
  currently unknown

  description: The outline of the molecular pathways in the fat body and prothoracic
    gland (PG) implicated in ecdysone-mediated body growth and size determination.
    In the fat body, amino acids (AAs) transported via the Slimfast (Slif) transporter
    stimulate the activity of target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling. Drosophila insulin-like
    peptides (dILPs) bind to and activate the insulin receptor (InR), thereby increasing
    the activity of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway.
    Activation of the ecdysone receptor (EcR) by ecdysone binding inhibits the expression
    of miR-8, thereby activating the expression of U-shaped (Ush), an inhibitor of
    IIS. Activated EcR also represses Myc, activated by TOR signaling. Through these
    pathways, ecdysone suppresses IIS/TOR activity, thereby attenuating the rate of
    body growth. In the PG, activated IIS suppresses bantam, a repressor of the expression
    of ecdysone biosynthetic genes. FOXO, which is suppressed by IIS, binds to ultraspiracle
    (Usp) thereby inhibiting the expression ecdysone biosynthetic genes. PTTH peptides
    released from the axon terminals of PTTH-expressing neurons acts on Torso, the
    PTTH receptor, which activates MAPK signaling cascades, thereby activating ecdysone
    generation. Activated InR or Torso also stimulates Warts (Wts), which in turn
    represses the activity of bantam and Yorki (Yki), thereby controlling ecdysone
    synthesis. TOR signaling activated by a protein-rich diet promotes ecdysone generation.
    Torso is also expressed in the fat body, stimulating IIS/TOR. The ligands acting
    on Torso in the fat body are currently unknown
