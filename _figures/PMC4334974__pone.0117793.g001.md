caption: Selected enzymatic steps in ABA biosynthesis are shown. The names of the
  genes encoding the enzymes that catalyze each step in tomato and Arabidopsis are
  indicated; the names of genes examined in this work are underlined. The conversion
  of phytoene to ß-carotene is mediated by phytoene desaturase (PED); this step is
  blocked by fluridone. Zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) catalyzes the synthesis of violaxanthin,
  which is then converted to neoxanthin. The subsequent synthesis of xanthoxin is
  catalyzed by 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED), which is encoded in the gene
  LeNCED1 in tomato and disrupted in notabilis mutant. Whereas the previous steps
  occur in plastids, xanthoxin is transported to the cytosol where it is converted
  to the abscisic aldehyde by short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR). The final
  step of ABA biosynthesis is the oxidation of abscisic aldehyde to ABA by an abscisic
  aldehyde oxidase (AAO), which is encoded in genes that are disrupted in the sitiens
  and flacca tomato mutants. ABA degradation (shown in the red frame) is mediated
  by ABA 8´-hydroxylase (A8H, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase), whose product spontaneously
  isomerizes to phaseic acid. The genes encoding ABA 8´-hydroxylase in tomato are
  SlCYP707A1–SlCYP707A4. Dashed arrows represent missing steps in the pathway. These
  schemes are modified according to Kitahata and co-authors [] and Nambara and Marion-Poll
  [].
