caption: The overview of RNA-sensing pathway. TLR3 senses dsRNA and utilizes the adaptor
  TRIF to activate IRF3 and NF-κB. Upon recognition of dsRNA, RLRs are recruited by
  the adaptor MAVS located on the outer membrane of the mitochondria, leading to the
  activation of several transcription factors including IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB. DExD/H-Box
  helicases other than the RLRs and some RNA-binding proteins have emerged as important
  for innate immune signaling and control of virus infection. DDX1-DDX21-DHX36 forms
  a complex with TRIF. DDX3 has been shown to associate with RIG-I, MDA5, and MAVS.
  DDX60 has been shown to bind RIG-I, whereas DHX9 has been shown to interact with
  MAVS. DHX33 has also been shown to bind MAVS, as well as the NLR NLRP3, to induce
  inflammasome assembly. DHX15 may serve as a sensor for viral RNA in the cytosol
  to signal NLRP6-mediated interferon responses in a MAVS-dependent manner, independent
  of inflammasome formation.
