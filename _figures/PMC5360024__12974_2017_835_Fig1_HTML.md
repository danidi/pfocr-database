caption: Signal transduction mechanism and detection principle of the BWZ reporter
  assays. In the BWZ cells, TREM2 (shown in blue) is expressed in a single chimeric
  protein containing CD8 transmembrane domain (shown in green) and a CD3ζ domain (shown
  in purple and pink), with an extracellular FLAG-tag (shown in brown). When a TREM2
  ligand, here ApoE, binds to TREM2 (a), the CD3ζ ITAM motifs (shown in purple) are
  phosphorylated (b), which leads to an intracellular signaling cascade resulting
  in an increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This induces the NFAT promoter,
  so that β-galactosidase is expressed from the lacZ gene (c). β-galactosidase is
  released from the cells using a lysis buffer containing saponin (d). The yellow
  β-galactosidase substrate, CPRG, is also present in the lysis buffer, and when cleaved
  by β-galactosidase, it forms a red product which is measured by absorbance (e)
