caption: A virtual cross section through the vertebrate embryo (zebrafish) with Bmp
  (A), Hedgehog (B), Vegf (C), Notch (D), non-canonical Wnt/Notch (E), and canonical
  Wnt signaling requirements depicted (F). Genes required for HSC emergence are annotated,
  including their anatomical site of expression and known epistasis within each pathway.
  Species is indicated in instances where gene function has only been identified in
  mouse (M), Xenopus (X), or zebrafish (Z). Solid lines indicate that there is evidence
  for a genetic relationship between proteins, while dotted lines indicate uninvestigated
  but plausible relationships.
