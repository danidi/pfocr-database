caption: 'Convergence of three vesicular pathways of endocytic traffic on the cross-presentation
  compartment in dendritic cells. A series of events is depicted leading to the formation
  of a cross-presentation-competent compartment after phagocytosis of bacteria. In
  dendritic cells, three pathways of vesicular traffic converge on nascent phagosomes
  carrying bacteria: the () ERGIC, () ERC, and () LRO pathways. () The ERGIC pathway
  traffics vesicles from the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and is dependent
  on pairing of the ER SNARE Sec22b with syntaxin-4 on the phagosomal membrane. This
  pathway delivers TAP, other components of the peptide-loading complex (not shown),
  and possibly also the ER retrotranslocon Sec61. The ERGIC pathway is mobilized independently
  of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signals during phagocytosis, regardless of the nature
  of the phagocytosed cargo, and in response to undefined signals likely associated
  with the process of phagocytosis. In the case of endocytosis, TLR signaling can
  increase TAP and Sec61 localization to endosomes in a MyD88 and TRIF dependent manner,
  respectively (not shown). () The ERC pathway traffics vesicles from the ERC to phagosomes
  marked by phosphorylated synaptosomal-associated protein SNAP23. This pathway is
  regulated by TLR signals (designated in blue letters). When internalized cargo carries
  microbial structures that engage TLRs, resultant MyD88-IKK2 signals phosphorylate
  SNAP23 on phagosomes. SNAP23 phosphorylation stabilizes interactions between ERC
  VAMP3/8 and a putative phagosomal syntaxin (not shown) to mediate fusion of ERC-derived
  vesicles with the bacterium-containing phagosome. ERC-phagosome fusion delivers
  MHC-I molecules from the ERC. Activity of the small GTPase Rab11a (shown) is important
  for formation of the MHC-I-rich ERC. () The LRO pathway traffics vesicles from lysosome-related
  organelles (LRO), is dependent on activity of the small GTPase Rab27a and formation
  of a stable SNARE complex comprising VAMP8, SNAP23, and syntaxin-7 (not shown).
  The LROs deliver to phagosomes the membrane-integral subunits of the NADPH oxidase,
  gp91phox and p22phox. Recruitment of the small GTPase Rac1 and cytosolic subunits
  of the NADPH oxidase to gp91phox and p22phox on the phagosomal membrane leads to
  the assembly of an active NADPH oxidase complex that raises phagosomal pH and protects
  antigens from complete degradation. The regulation of the LRO pathway is poorly
  understood and might occur at the point of trafficking from LROs or assembly of
  the cytosolic and membrane components of the NADPH oxidase. Concurrently with these
  events, proteins derived from bacterial degradation are subjected to one of two
  routes of proteolysis: (A) vacuolar processing relying on the activity of phagosomal
  cathepsin S, which remains active at the relatively alkaline pH of the cross-presentation
  compartment, and (B) cytosolic processing relying on retrotranslocation of antigen
  to the cytosol (perhaps through ERGIC delivered Sec61), degradation by the proteasome,
  and transport back into phagosomes through TAP. Peptides are trimmed by insulin-regulated
  endopeptidase (IRAP) in preparation for MHC-I loading. The combined activity of
  these two pathways (A and B) would serve to diversify the peptide repertoire that
  can be generated from exogenous cargo, loaded onto MHC-I and exported to the plasma
  membrane for cross-presentation to CD8 T cells (not shown). Together with the vacuolar
  and cytosolic pathways of antigen processing (A and B), the ERGIC (), ERC (), and
  LRO () pathways of vesicular traffic equip phagosomes for cross-presentation of
  microbial antigen.'
