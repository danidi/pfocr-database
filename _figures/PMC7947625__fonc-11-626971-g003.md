caption: The mevalonate (MVA) pathway in cancer progression. The MVA pathway is dysregulated
  in several cancer cells due to mutations or abnormal signaling of different proteins/pathways.
  Upregulation of MVA pathway drives to increased protein prenylation thus promoting
  a malignant phenotype of cancer cells with an uncontrolled cell invasive growth
  and survival. In cancer cells expressing a mutation of tumor protein p53, there
  is a positive-feedback loop where p53 interacts with sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein (SREBP), leading to increased activation of the MVA pathway activity, and
  therefore higher levels of MVA. This MVA leads to the stabilization of p53 mutation
  as well as promotes protein prenylation, thus accelerating cancer progression.
