caption: The class I MHC antigen processing pathway acting as an internal surveillance
  mechanism to detect any abnormal or foreign protein synthesized in the cell. Tumor
  antigens encoded in the endogenous DNA of the tumor cell, or encoded in a DNA plasmid
  or viral vector vaccine taken up by an APC, are synthesized and cleaved by the 26S
  proteasome into fragments that are transported by TAP, the transporter associated
  with antigen processing, into the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are loaded onto
  newly synthesized class I MHC molecules that transport them to the cell surface
  for recognition by the T cell receptor.
