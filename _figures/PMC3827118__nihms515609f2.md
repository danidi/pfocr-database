caption: 'Hh signaling in mammals. (a) Hh protein production. Autocatalytic cleavage
  of the Hh precursor protein yields a cholesterol-modified signaling peptide (HhN)
  that is further palmitoylated by Hh acyltransferase (Hhat). Lipophilic HhN released
  from the plasma membrane by Dispatched (Disp) is distributed to other cells. (b,
  c) Hh pathway response. The suppressive action of Patched 1 (Ptch1) on Smoothened
  (Smo) (b) is inhibited by binding of Hh to Ptch1, a 12-transmembrane protein with
  structural similarities to the resistance nodulation division (RND) family of small-molecule
  transporters (c). Smo controls activity of Ci/Gli transcription by regulating nuclear
  localization and proteolytic processing into repressor molecules, subsequent to
  Smo localization to the primary cilium. Suppressor of fused homolog (Sufu) appears
  to be the primary pathway suppressor in mammals, although its regulation by Smo
  has not been demonstrated. Abbreviations: GliR, glioma-associated oncogene family
  zinc finger, repressor domain; Hh, Hedgehog signaling molecule.'
