caption: Genes/gene products are represented graphically as nodes and the biological
  relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line). Grey colour of
  the node is indicating genes that were identified in the stage 1 GWAS (p<0.001)
  and white indicates the molecule was added from the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Dashed
  lines indicate indirect interactions; solid lines indicate direct interactions.
  The style of the arrows indicate specific molecular relationships (A  acts on B,
  A  binds to B), dotted lines indicated an indirect interaction. All edges are supported
  by at least one reference from the literature or from canonical information stored
  in the Ingenuity Knowledge Base. Nodes are displayed using various shapes that represent
  the functional classes of the gene product( cytokines,  enzyme,  complex/group,  transporter,  transcription
  regulator,  transmembrane receptor,  ion channel,  ligand-dependent nuclear receptor,  kinase,  growth
  factor,  other).
