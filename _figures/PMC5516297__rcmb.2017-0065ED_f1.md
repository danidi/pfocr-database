caption: Sepsis inhibits fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-mediated repair of the pulmonary
  endothelial glycocalyx. At baseline, pulmonary endothelial cells project a long
  glycocalyx/endothelial surface layer (ESL) into the vessel lumen that is maintained
  in part via exostosin-1 (Ext) expression (left). Injury by either infusion of heparinase
  or sepsis causes disruption of the pulmonary endothelial ESL and release of heparin
  sulfate (HS) fragments. Physiologic repair of the ESL after heparinase injury occurs
  rapidly because HS fragments activate FGF signaling, which leads both to activation
  of existing Ext as well as Erk-mediated up-regulation of additional Ext, resulting
  in rapid reconstitution of the ESL. In contrast, repair after sepsis-induced injury
  is significantly delayed because sepsis leads to inhibition of fibroblast growth
  factor receptor 1 (FGFR) signaling and subsequent suppression of the FGF-mediated
  pathway that is necessary for Ext activation and up-regulation.
