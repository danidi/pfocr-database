caption: The redox cascade involved in the protection of protein sulfhydryl groups
  from oxidation. Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) catalyses the transfer of electrons
  from reduced thioredoxin (Trxred), which is regenerated by transfer of electrons
  from NADPH to oxidised thioredoxin (Trxox). Alternatively, proteins may become glutathionylated
  (Pr-SSG), in which case glutaredoxin reductase (GrxR) catalyses the transfer of
  electrons from reduced glutaredoxin (Grxred), which is, in turn, regenerated by
  oxidation of reduced glutathione (GSH) to glutathione disulfide (GSSG). GSH also
  participates in the glutathione redox cycle, involving glutathione peroxidase (GPx)
  and glutathione reductase (GR), in a reaction coupled to oxidation of NADPH that
  is supplied by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The GSH redox cycle takes place
  in the cytosol and in mitochondria. ROS, reactive oxygen species.
