caption: Plasma treatment abolish siRNA-induced knockdown of NRF2. A, I–IV, immunofluorescence
  microscopy showing nuclear trafficking of NRF2 after plasma treatment. B, I–IV,
  HaCaT cells were transfected with a control scrambled siRNA or NRF2 siRNA and incubated
  for 72 h. After 60-s plasma treatment (20-min incubation), plasma effects on NRF2
  localization were obtained. C, I–IV, increased plasma treatment time up to 180 s
  and prolonged incubation time (1 h) abolish siRNA-induced knockdown of NRF2 and
  enhanced expression of NRF2 in the cytosol and the nuclear translocation. D, functional
  annotation, pathway, network analysis, and graphical summary of NRF2 activation
  in keratinocytes after plasma treatment. The top gene interaction networks associated
  with plasma-treated HaCaT cells were predicted by IPA and are presented for all
  groups. About 30 genes are involved in the network. A solid line represents a direct
  interaction and a dashed line represents an indirect interaction between target
  genes (red, up-regulation; green, down-regulation). Plasma activates NRF2 signaling
  and induces an antioxidant response. Among others, HMOX1, FOS, JUN, JUNB/D, and
  BACH1 were regulated by plasma. Regulation of several components is simplified in
  the drawing.
