caption: Schematic representation of BGN- and DCN-mediated inhibition of the TGF-β
  pathway and restriction of HER-2/neu signaling. TGF-β1 binds to its receptors (TGF-βRI
  and TGF-βR2) and induces phosphorylation of TACE, resulting in its translocation
  to the cell surface, where TACE induces integrins and cleaves EGFR pro-ligands.
  EGFR ligands will initiate autocrine and paracrine EGFR signaling, which is amplified
  in HER2-overexpressing cells (BGNlow/neg HER-2/neu+ cells). In BGNhigh HER-2/neu+
  cells, BGN and DCN bind to TGF-β1 and restricts HER-2/neu signaling, thus allowing
  tumor suppression to occur.
