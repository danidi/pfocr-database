caption: Elf3 in developmental enterocyte differentiation. Elf3, expressed in developing
  intestinal epithelium, promotes epithelial expression of the TGFβ type II receptor
  (TGFβRII), probably by directly stimulating TGFβRII promoter acivity. This presumably
  permits an epithelial response to the differentiating effects of TGFβ, thus promoting
  epithelial differentiation along the enterocyte lineage. The same pathway also appears
  to regulate goblet cell terminal differentiation (see text).
