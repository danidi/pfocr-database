caption: Schematic representation of action mechanism by gallic acid and rutin on
  mitochondrial functions in C2C12 myotubes. Improvement of functions of the mitochondrial
  network will result in increased exercise performance. The mitochondria in skeletal
  muscle are dynamically balanced. By enhancing the performance of genes, such as
  mitochondrial synthesis, fusion/fission, and mitochondrial autophagy, it can enhance
  mitochondrial function and improve metabolic dysfunction diseases. Gallic acid and
  rutin are the most potent activators of mitochondrial function, which is mediated
  through SIRT1 pathway. The results show that it has the best performance in enhancing
  the mitochondrial function of C2C12 myotube cells (mitochondrial DNA content, mitochondrial
  number, enzyme activities, and ATP content). It can further promote the downstream
  molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial biosynthesis genes (PGC-1α, NRF1, ERRα, and
  TFAM), mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (NDUFB3, SDHB, UQCRC1, COX5b, and
  ATP5 l), oxidized muscle fibers (MyHC I and MyHC IIa), fusion/fission (Mfn1, Mfn2,
  OPA1, DRP1, and Fis1), and mitochondrial autophagy (Atg5, Atg7, Beclin, Bnip3, LC3II,
  Mul1, and p62) gene expressions to improve skeletal muscle endurance. Therefore,
  gallic acid and rutin may be beneficial against exercise performance and anti-fatigue
  action.
