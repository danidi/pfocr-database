  synaptic terminal. Glutamate binds to metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR6 (GRM6)
  and activates an intracellular cascade involving GαO and Gβ5, leading to the closure
  of the TRPM1 channel. NYX also plays a role, but its function is currently unknown.
  GRM6, NYX, and TRPM1 have now been implicated in human cCSNB. It is less likely
  that human patients with mutations in either GαO or Gβ5 will be found, given that
  the GαO mutation is lethal in mice and Gβ5 has a primary photoreceptor-degeneration
  phenotype.'
