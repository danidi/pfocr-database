caption: 'Mechanism of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. NLRP3 inflammasomes are formed
  by priming and activation signaling. In the priming signaling, several pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) bind
  to the pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors and activate
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, which leads to the upregulation of NLRP3, pro-interleukin
  (IL)-1β, and pro-IL-18. In the activation signaling, various PAMPs, DAMPs, or intracellular
  changes induce the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome composed of NLRP3 as a PRR,
  pro-caspase-1, and adapter proteins such as the apoptosis-associated speck-like
  protein containing a caspase recruitment domain that connects NLRP3 and pro-caspase-1.
  Then, the inflammasome complex activates pro-caspase-1. The activated caspase-1
  cleaves the pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into IL-1β and IL-18, which are biologically
  active forms. Abbreviations: ASC: apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing
  a caspase recruitment domain; DAMP: danger-associated molecular pattern; IL: interleukin;
  NF-κB: nuclear factor kappa B; NLRP3: NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing
  3; TLR: Toll-like receptor.'
