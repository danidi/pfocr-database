caption: Simplified phylogenetic tree showing the catalytic properties of P450s of
  the DIMBOA-biosynthetic pathway in maize. The first common ancestor probably had
  the ancestral function of BX2, producing indolin-2- one from indole (in red). This
  reaction was initially shared with P450s that are not part of the DIMBOA pathway
  (BX2-like). The duplications leading to the present BX3, 4 and 5 are shown, with
  each color indicating the presumed conserved catalytic competence of each ancestral
  enzyme.
