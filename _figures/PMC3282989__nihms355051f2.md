caption: 'The recapitulation of heart development can provide useful insight for optimizing
  differentiation protocols. There have been three major families of growth factors
  that have been identified as being important regulators of cardiac development:
  the transforming growth factor beta-family (TGFβ) such as BMPs and Activin (), the
  Wnt family, and the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family [–]. While these pathways
  are able to be distinguished from each other, there may be a cooperative interplay
  between these developmental pathways []. It is becoming evident that there is a
  temporal and spatial segregation of molecular signals that are required to create
  the correct environment for cardiac differentiation. The TGFβ, Wnt and FGF families
  all play an important role on differentiation to any lineage, but are especially
  important for mesoderm formation. These signals must be delivered at appropriate
  combinations and timing, and subsequently turned off at the appropriate time to
  allow for specific differentiation. Addition of BMP4 during embryoid body differentiation
  was found to induce the development of mesoderm, or Brachyury (T) positive tissue.
  However, the Wnt/β-catenin signals play a biphasic role in mouse ES differentiation,
  as these signals must then be inhibited to promote precardiac progenitor formation
  []. If the signaling is not removed, the cells will instead form Flk-1+ mesoderm
  that moves toward a hemangioblast lineage []. Using Nodal, or adding Activin A to
  act as a surrogate for Nodal, enhanced mesendoderm formation, but a careful balance
  must be achieved, as higher concentrations of Activin A promoted formation of endoderm
  over mesoderm []. The subsequent addition of BMP 4, in addition to Activin A, is
  thought to further commit the cells down a cardiac lineage, and generate cardiomoycytes
  [, ]. However, BMPs have also exhibited biphasic activity and must be expressed
  and inhibited at appropriate intervals []. For example, the endogenous BMP inhibitor
  Noggin, when in use with mESCs, has been seen to increase cardiomyogenesis. Similarly,
  when a BMP small molecule inhibitor was used within the first 24 hours of culture,
  it robustly increased cardiomyogenesis and reduced differentiation into endothelial
  and smooth muscle lineages []. Conversely, this BMP inhibition must be removed in
  later differentiation steps as BMPs have also been shown to upregulate SMAD signaling
  and MAP3K7 signaling for proper heart development [, ]. The role of FGF, however,
  is less defined. While studies have suggested a synergistic partnership between
  members of the FGF and BMP families to promote heart induction during development,
  the precise pathway and interaction remains unclear [, ].'
