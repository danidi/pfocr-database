caption: Three pathways for methanogenesis. Methanogenesis is a form of anaerobic
  respiration using a variety of one-carbon (C-1) compounds or acetic acid as a terminal
  electron acceptor. All three pathways converge on the reduction of methyl-CoM to
  methane (CH4). Many methanogens can reduce CO2 to methane using electrons derived
  by oxidizing H2 (the hydrogenotrophic pathway, red arrows). Others can utilize C-1
  compounds such as methanol or methylamines with one molecule of C-1 compound being
  oxidized to provide electrons for reducing three additional molecules to methane
  (the methylotrophic pathway, green arrows). Still other methanogens split acetate
  into a methyl group and an enzyme-bound CO, with the CO subsequently oxidized to
  provide electrons for the reduction of the methyl group to methane (the acetoclastic
  pathway, blue arrows). In all cases, an electrochemical gradient is generated for
  use in ATP synthesis. Most methanogens possess only one of the three methanogenic
  pathways. Methanosarcina species possess all three. CoM, coenzyme M; H4SPT, tetrahydrosarcinapterin;
  MF, methanofuran.
