caption: A model for the role of TBC1D9B in autophagy. Multiple fusion of autophagosomes
  (blue) with other types of vesicles (gray) can occur during the biogenesis/maturation
  of autophagosomes in mammalian cells. The resultant vesicles, also known as amphisomes
  (green), could retain RAB molecules that are specific to the donor vesicles. Continuous
  presence of these RAB molecules may “misguide” the autophagosome to the trafficking
  pathway specified by these RAB molecules (orange) and their associated effector
  molecules (pink) and thus negatively affect autophagosome trafficking to the lysosomal
  compartment for degradation. The recruitment of TBC1D9B (red) or other TBC family
  GAP by the ATG8 homologues (yellow)  following autophagy signaling could inactivate
  the specific RAB, such as RAB11A as in the case of TBC1D9B recruitment, causing
  the conversion of the GTP status to the GDP status, and the detachment of the RAB
  and/or the effector molecule from the autophagosomes. This activity may thus prevent
  the latter to move to the recycling pathway, and allow them to go to the lysosomal
  compartment for fusion and degradation, thus promoting autophagic flux.
