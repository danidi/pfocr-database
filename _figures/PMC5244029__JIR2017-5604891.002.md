caption: Schematic representation of the main pathway of O-acetyl-GD2 ganglioside
  biosynthesis. GD2 ganglioside is synthesized by the action of N-acetyl-galactosyltransferase
  I, which transfers N-acetyl-galactosaminyl residue from UDP-N-acetyl-galactosamine
  to GD3 []. GD2 can be also formed by the action of alpha 2–8 sialyltransferase II,
  which transfers a sialic acid residue from CMP-sialic acid to GM2 []. After synthesis,
  GD2 can be converted into either GD1b or GT2. GD1b is formed by the action of galactosyltransferase
  II that transfers a galactose residue from UDP-galactose to GD2. GT2 is synthesized
  by the action of sialyltransferase III that transfers a sialic acid residue from
  CMP-sialic acid to GD2. Then, the O-acetyl group addition occurs in a postsynthetic
  fashion []. Thus, O-acetyl-GD2 can be synthesized either by the action of sialate-O-acetyltransferase,
  which transfers the O-acetyl group to GD2, or by the action of N-acetyl-galactosyltransferase
  I, which transfers N-acetyl-galactosaminyl residue from UDP-N-acetyl-galactosamine
  to O-acetyl-GD3. Cer, ceramide; GlcCer, glucosylceramide; LacCer, lactosylceramide;
