caption: LPA-induced platelet signalling during platelet shape change. Activation
  of the LPA5 receptor coupled to the heterotrimeric G13 protein stimulates Rho and
  Rho-kinase. The subsequent bifurcating pathway directed to either the myosin-binding
  subunit of MLC phosphatase or the LIM-kinase 1 leads to enhanced phosphorylation
  of MLC and stimulation of phospho-cofilin turnover, respectively. Phosphorylated
  myosin develops actin-activated ATPase activity, interacts with F-actin, and assembles
  into filaments, whereas cofilin regulates actin dynamics by enhancing both actin-polymerization
  and actin filament severing. These cytoskeleton changes underlie the folding of
  the surface membrane, the formation of pseudopods and the contractile wave centralizing
  the secretory granules during platelet shape change.
