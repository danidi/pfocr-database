caption: mTOR is the essential signaling pathway for nutrient sensing and apoptosis
  protection in the β cell. Nutrients such as amino acids and glucose activate both
  mTOR complexes in the β cell via interconnected pathways. mTORC1 is activated directly,
  whereas secreted insulin (induced by glucose metabolism and the raise in intracellular
  Ca2+) acts indirectly through mTORC2. mTORC1 is activated through Rag GTPase and
  inhibited by TSC1/2 and AMPK (elevated ATP/AMP derived from the Krebs cycle and
  mitochondrial respiration suppress AMPK). mTORC2 is activated by growth factors
  and insulin through the insulin receptor IRS1/2–PI3K–PIP3pathway and is required
  for full activation of prosurvival kinase AKT. Under physiological conditions, mTOR
  binds to the ChREBP–Mlx complex and keeps it in the cytosol. mTOR can also dissociate
  the ChREBP–Mlx complex or prevent their interaction. In both scenarios, mTOR prevents
  the ChREBP–Mlx shuttling to the nucleus and binding to the TXNIP promoter. Subsequently,
  TXNIP transcription and β cell apoptosis are suppressed. In the absence of mTOR,
  the ChREBP–Mlx complex binds to the TXNIP promoter, which leads to elevated TXNIP
  levels, oxidative stress, and apoptosis.
