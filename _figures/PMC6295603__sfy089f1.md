caption: Targeted metabolic regulation in ADPKD. A highly simplified cartoon of some
  of the major pathways that relate to the pathogenesis of PKD and that are are affected
  by some of the compounds discussed in this article. Rosiglitazone treatment activates
  PPAR-γ, causing heterodimeric binding to retinoid x receptor (RXR) followed by translocation
  to the nucleus, activating gene transcription of PPAR response element-regulated
  genes. This in turn leads to a decrease in TGF-β signaling and a subsequent reduction
  in fibrosis. Rosiglitazone also acts independently of PPAR-γ to inhibit p70S6K activation
  and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation. Treatment with 2DG leads to a reduction
  in glycolysis by inhibition of phosphoglucoisomerase. Decreased glycolytic activity
  in turn may cause the activation of AMPK and subsequent inhibition of mTORC1, cell
  growth and proliferation with an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Metformin activates
  AMPK that directly represses mTORC1 signaling via phosphorylation. Treatment with
  BPTES inhibits glutaminase (GLS1) disrupting the breakdown of glutamine to glutamate
  preventing it from being used in the TCA cycle to produce α-ketoglutarate. Fenofibrate
  treatment activates PPAR-α to bind to PPAR response elements and increase transcription
  of genes involved in fatty acid utilization, oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial
  biogenesis. Rapamycin inhibits the ability of mTORC1 to activate the S6-Kinase branch
  of its downstream pathway but has less effect on the 4E-BP1 branch. In contrast,
  mTOR kinase inhibitors or mTOR ASOs would affect both downstream branches. Dietary
  restriction simulates the effects of targeted drug therapies by reducing nutrient
  intake, leading to reductions in key regulatory pathways. Pointed arrowheads indicate
  activating effects. Blunt arrowheads indicate inhibitory effects. Dashed arrows
  indicate indirect or multistep effects.
