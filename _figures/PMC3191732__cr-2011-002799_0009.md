caption: 'Hydrolytic metabolism of 2-AG and PG-Gs. Pathway A: 2-AG may be hydrolyzed
  to AA, which is then subject to oxygenation by COX-2 or COX-1, yielding free acid
  PGs (illustrated here by PGE2). Pathway B: Oxygenation of 2-AG will produce PG-Gs
  (illustrated here by PGE2-G), hydrolysis of which will yield the corresponding free
  acid PG. The origin of the free acid PG product, through oxygenation of AA or 2-AG,
  cannot readily be distinguished.'
