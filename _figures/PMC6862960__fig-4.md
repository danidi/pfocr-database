caption: Putative mechanisms involved in fractional resurfacing-induced remodeling.
  Solid arrows denote direct involvement in specific processes, dotted arrows denote
  regulatory roles. The TGFβ pathway regulates fibroblast function both directly and
  indirectly through effects on immune cells. Both fibroblasts and immune cells also
  produce TGFβ. Paracrine signaling from apoptotic cells stimulates proliferation
  and differentiation of neighboring cells, and also modulate the inflammatory response.
  HSPs interact with TGFβ signaling and also serve as chaperones for the production
  of ECM components. Tissue biomechanics may be altered by both the microinjuries
  from fractional resurfacing and the ECM remodeling process, resulting in feedback
  regulation of fibroblast functions through mechanotransduction pathways. ECM, extracellular
  matrix; HSP, heat shock protein; TGFβ, transforming growth factor-β.
