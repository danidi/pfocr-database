caption: 'Mechanism of action proposed for the crosstalk between H1R and GR signaling
  pathways. Activation of the H1R triggers a complex dual regulatory mechanism on
  GR activity, involving both Gαq and Gβγ G‐protein subunits. While the Gαq subunit
  has an inhibitory effect via a PLC‐RAC‐mediated pathway, Gβγ enhances GR activity
  via JNK. While activation of the H1R by histamine resulted in a composite potentiating
  effect, inactivation of the Gαq‐PLC pathway by H1R inverse agonists resulted in
  a potentiation of GR activity. The enhancing effect of antihistamines occurs both
  for GR‐mediated transactivation of GRE‐dependent genes and for GR‐mediated transrepression
  of genes regulated by NF‐κB (p65‐p50). Solid lines indicate direct effects; dashed
  lines indicate indirect effects. Lines ending with arrowheads or bars indicate activating
  or inhibitory effects, respectively. GR: glucocorticoid receptor; H1R: histamine
  H1 receptor; NF‐κB: nuclear factor kappa B; TNF‐α: tumor necrosis factor‐alpha;
  LPS: lipopolysaccharide; PLC, phospholipase C; JNK: Jun kinase; I‐κB: inhibitor
  kappa B; GRE: glucocorticoid response element; NF‐κB‐RE: NF‐κB response element'
