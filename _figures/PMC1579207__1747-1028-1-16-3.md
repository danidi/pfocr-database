caption: Cadmium-induced regulation of SCFMet30. Cadmium leads to dissociation of
  Met30 from the SCF-core by preventing the Met30/Skp1 interaction and blocks Met4
  ubiquitination. The resulting activation of Met4 induces synthesis of sulfur amino
  acids and glutathione as well as a process called isozyme switching, which is part
  of the sulfur sparing response. Cadmium also leads to activation of three independent
  cell cycle arrest pathways. The Met4/Met32-dependend and the Mec1/Rad53-dependent
  pathways, as well as one so far unidentified pathway, which was indicated by genetic
  results.
