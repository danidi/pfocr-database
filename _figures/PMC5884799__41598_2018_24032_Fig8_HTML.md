caption: Multiple sclerosis pathway. IFN-γ signalling is activated by viral load and
  produced immune response; other pathways are thought to be involved in the significant
  gene response, however pathway names can be unrelated with MS at all. Gene ontologies
  can be highlighted just for those pathways were those genes have been identified.
