caption: During obesity-HTN, macrophages sense increases in extracellular glucose,
  pro-inflammatory fatty acids, hypoxia, and neurohormonal factors, leading to activation
  of pro-inflammatory NF-κB and HIF-1α pathways, which promote glycolytic and pro-inflammatory
  gene expression, leading to an M1 phenotype. Glycolysis supports activation of the
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which generates NADPH to support pro-inflammatory
  prostaglandin/leukotriene synthesis. Pyruvate entry into the mitochondria is also
  reduced, leading to a truncated tricarboxylic acid cycle that leads to accumulation
  of succinate, which supports HIF-1α activation of pro-inflammatory/glycolytic gene
  expression. Conversely, the anti-inflammatory PPARγ-PGC1β axis, which promotes OXPHOS,
  is decreased during obesity due to decreases in anti-inflammatory fatty acids such
  as unsaturated/omega-3 fatty acids. Blue arrows indicate activation, orange arrows
  indicate inhibition. ACh—acetylcholine, Ang II—angiotensin II, ETC—electron transport
