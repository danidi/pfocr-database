caption: (A) HCV-infected hepatocytes form clusters (indicated in green) in the infected
  liver (), consistent with the cell-to-cell transmission observed in hepatoma cultures
  (; ). (B) Specific HCV RNA structures are recognized by PKR, RIG-I and TLR3 in cell
  culture experiments. PKR and RIG-I signals are transmitted via MAVS, and TLR3 signals
  are transmitted via TRIF. Downstream activation of kinases, IRF-3 dependent induction
  of IFN-β, and NF-κB-dependent induction of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α
  and CXCL10 is abrogated in the presence of HCV NS3-4A, which cleaves both MAVS ()
  and TRIF (). The induction of IFNL1 transcription is indicated by a dotted line
  because this pathway has been demonstrated in other models () and not yet been confirmed
  for HCV infection. The secreted interferons bind to their respective receptors,
  which via activation of the Jak-STAT pathway amplifies the IFN response and induces
  a large set of ISGs (not shown). IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; dsRNA, double-stranded
  RNA; PKR, RNA-dependent protein kinase R; RIG-I, retinoic acid-inducible gene 1;
  TLR3, toll-like receptor 3; MAM, mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane;
  MAVS, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1; TRIF,
  Toll/IL-1 receptor domain–containing adapter inducing IFN-β; IRF-3, IFN-regulatory
  factor 3. (C) HCV persists in the presence of ISGs. IFN-β production is blocked
  in the upper right hepatocytes due to intracellular expression of HCV NS3-4A. Whether
  individual hepatocytes transiently express IFN-β and potentially IFN-λ1 in response
  to HCV RNA, e.g. in the context of an abortive intracellular infection or prior
  to accumulating sufficient NS3-4A as indicated in the upper left hepatocyte is not
  known at present. Nonparenchymal cells, e.g. Kupffer cells, pDCs and BDCA3+ mDC2s
  contribute to the production of ISG-inducing IFNs, which via binding to their respective
  receptors and activation of the Jak–STAT pathway induce ISG mRNA and proteins in
  HCV-uninfected hepatocytes (lower part of the figure). Although ISG mRNAs are induced
  in HCV-infected hepatocytes (indicated in green), HCV persists by phosphorylating
  and activating PKR. PKR blocks cap-dependent translation of host proteins but not
  IRES-dependent translation of HCV proteins (see text for details). Continuous exposure
  to IFN-α increases STAT1 expression in NK cells and results in increased pSTAT1-dependent
  cytotoxicity (CD107a expression and TRAIL production) and decreased pSTAT4-dependent
  IFN-γ production (see text for details). KC, Kupffer cell; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic
  cell; mDC, myeloid dendritic cell; NK, natural killer cell; TRAIL, tumor necrosis
  factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand.
