caption: OncomiRs miR-221 and miR-210 and their impact on cancer cells. The miRNAs
  miR-221 and miR-210 are significantly upregulated during tumor development of melanoma
  and HCC (indicated by red arrows) which leads to interference with important cellular
  pathways. MiR-221 downregulates the transcription factors c-FOS [] and AP2α [] and
  is regulated itself by c-Jun and the NFκB pathway []. NFκB regulation also leads
  to suppression of the miR-221 downstream genes Bcl-2, VEGF and MMP-9 thus inhibiting
  apoptosis []. MiR-221-associated anti-apoptotic activity is further mediated by
  targeting caspase-3 []. Regulation of Bcl-2, VEGF and MMP-9 by miR-221 can also
  induce an invasive phenotype which is further mediated by miR-221 suppressing SCD5
  and thereby promoting EMT []. Additional miR-221 targets are c-Kit, p27Kip1/CDKN1B
  and CDKN1A whose downregulation in cancer induces cell proliferation [,,]. MiR-210
  can also influence EMT and migration via inhibition of TIMP2 [] and activation of
  VMP1 []. Downregulation of SMAD4 and STAT6 by miR-210 promotes angiogenesis [].
  Further important targets of miR-210 in tumor cells are HOX1A and PTPN1 interfering
  with the immune response []. MiR-210 expression is induced during hypoxia [,] through
  regulation by HIF1α [].
