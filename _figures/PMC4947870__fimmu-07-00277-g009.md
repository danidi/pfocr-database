caption: Model for signaling in neutrophils to induce NETosis. In human neutrophils,
  cross-linking FcγRIIIb leads to activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and transforming
  growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1). TAK1 is then required for activation
  of ERK kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Activated ERK
  contributes to the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Phorbol 12-myristate
  13-acetate (PMA) can directly activate protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn leads
  to activation of the MEK/ERK pathway. These kinases finally promote NET formation.
  FcγRIIIb-induced NET formation also depends on PKC (). Thus, TAK1 might also be
  able to activate PKC (dashed arrow), but this remains to be demonstrated. Transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a potent activator of TAK1. However, this activation
  does not seem to have any effect of NET formation induced by PMA or FcγRIIIb.
