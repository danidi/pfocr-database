number: Figure 1
caption: Figure 1 represents a simplified diagram of the one-carbon metabolic pathway.
  The figure demonstrates where dietary methyl donors, identified in red, are involved
  in the one-carbon metabolic pathway and how they influence DNA methylation. DNA
  methylation depends upon the availability of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine,
  which is derived from methionine. This figure highlights the connection between
  folate, choline, methionine, betaine, and vitamins B2, B6, and B12 on DNA methylation.
  The pathways intersect at the formation of methionine from homocysteine.
