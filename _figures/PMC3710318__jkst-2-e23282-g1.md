caption: Figure 1. The steps of myogenic differentiation. Myoblasts originate from
  the mesoderm and are converted to skeletal muscle lineage myoblasts after MyoD and
  Myf5 expression. First, myoblasts enter the cell cycle and proliferate. When the
  growth factor or mitogen from myoblast cultures is withdrawn, proliferating cells
  exit from the cell cycle and initiate differentiation. Myogenin and MRF4 are involved
  in the initiation of differentiation. In this step, myoblasts changed to an elongated
  shape and are called myocytes. Myocytes fuse with neighboring cells into multinucleated
  myotubes. The multinucleated myotubes express the muscle specific proteins, MHC
  (myosin heavy chain), muscle creatine kinase (MCK) and α-actin. The mature form
  of myotubes is turned to myofiber.
