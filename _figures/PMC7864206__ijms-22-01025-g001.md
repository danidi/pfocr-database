caption: Essential molecules of the mammalian Hedgehog signaling pathway and their
  interactions. (a) In the producing cell, Hedgehog (Hh) ligands are formed as precursor
  proteins and undergo posttranslational modification within the endoplasmatic reticulum
  (ER) and Golgi apparatus. The C-terminus is cleaved and degraded by the proteasome.
  The former N-terminus is palmitoylated and conjugated with a cholesterol moiety
  by Hh acetyltransferase (HHAT), as well as autocatalytically. Secretion is facilitated
  by cell membrane-residing Dispatched 1 (DISP1) and its cofactor SCUBE2. (b) In the
  absence of Hh ligands, Patched 1 (PTCH1) prevents Smoothened (SMO) from entering
  the primary cilium. Full-length Glioma-associated oncogenes 2 and 3 (GLI2/3) transcription
  factors accumulate within the primary cilium in a complex with Suppressor of fused
  (SUFU). GLI2/3 factors are phosphorylated at their repressor domains, triggering
  proteolytical cleavage into truncated repressor proteins, which can enter the nucleus
  and inhibit the expression of Hh target genes (GLI2/3 in red). (c) Hh ligands interact
  with PTCH1, which releases repression of SMO. SMO accumulates at the top of the
  primary cilium and full-length GLI2/3 is released from its inhibitor SUFU. GLI2/3
  are further phosphorylated at their activator domains. The activated proteins (GLI2/3
  in green) enter the nucleus and activate the expression of Hh target genes, including
  GLI1 and PTCH1.
