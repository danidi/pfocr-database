caption: (A) The binding of CXCL12 to its cognate receptor, CXCR4 initiates the activation
  of Gα13 and its dissociation from Gβγ subunits. Gα13 directly activates the DBl
  family RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF (PRG), which subsequently activates the small GTPase,
  RhoA. The downstream target of RhoA, Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK), phosphorylates
  myosin light chain (MLC) leading to directional cell migration, the formation of
  invasive protrusions including membrane ruffling, and increased adhesion to the
  extracellular matrix. Integrin signaling through an alternate pathway can modulate
  RhoA activity through activation of focal adhesion kinase 1 (FAK1) which activates
  RhoA through Ras protein-specific guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (RASGRF1).
  (B) Agonist-induced heterodimerization of CXCR4 and CB2 inhibits Gα13 activation
  and dissociation from Gβγ subunits. As a result, PRG ineffectively activates RhoA,
  which in turn, fails to mediate phosphorylation of myosin light chain leading to
  abrogation of cell migration, invasion and adhesion. Signaling through alternate
  pathways, including integrin-mediated signaling, is insufficient to overcome inhibition
  caused by heterodimerization.
