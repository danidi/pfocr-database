caption: Top predictive features for IGHV-mutated CLL patients. Each node shows a
  predictive pathway features and edges connect shared members of pathways. Node fill
  uniformly indicates highest score; yellow = netDx score 3, red = netDx score 10.
  Selected features required a minimum feature score of 9 out of 10 in at least in
  50% of train/test splits.
