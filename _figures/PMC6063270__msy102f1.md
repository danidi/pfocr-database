caption: Diagram of the GAL network in the budding yeast model S. cerevisiae and the
  role of Gal4-binding sites in explaining quantitative variation in growth on galactose.
  In the absence of galactose, the transcription factor Gal4 is inhibited by the corepressor
  Gal80, which prevents the expression of the GALactose utilization genes. When galactose
  is present, Gal80 is sequestered by the co-inducer Gal3, allowing Gal4 to induce
  GAL gene expression. Other GAL genes encode the transporter Gal2 and three enzymes
  in the Leloir pathway that catabolize galactose. Glucose-1-phosphate, the end product
  of the Leloir pathway, is converted by the phosphoglucomutases Pgm1/2 into glucose-6-phosphate,
  which then enters glycolysis. For each protein, except for Gal2 (where paralogous
  hexose transporters complicated analyses), the correlation (R2) between the number
  of predicted Gal4-binding sites upstream of the gene encoding it and growth on galactose
  across diverse yeast species (see fig. 2) is color-coded according to the key.
