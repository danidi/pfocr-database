caption: Accumulation of Linseed TAG by Channeling of Acyl Groups through PC.The stepwise
  acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) by acyl-CoA:1-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase
  (G3PAT; 1) and acyl-CoA:1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (2) yields 1-acyl-glycerol-3-phosphate
  (LPA) and phosphatidic acid (PA), which is hydrolyzed by phosphatidic acid phosphatase
  (3) to give DAG. Its conversion to TAG by acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase
  (5) immediately after the primary formation of DAG by the Kennedy pathway represents
  a minor alternative for TAG synthesis in linseed (indicated by the dotted arrow).
  The major part of DAG is converted to PC in a reversible reaction catalyzed by CDP-choline:diacylglycerol
  cholinephosphotransferase (CPT; 4). PC is the substrate for acyl group desaturases
  (6). They may accept both the sn-1 and sn-2–localized acyl groups (the genuine enzymes),
  or their action may be confined to the sn-2–bound acyl chains (the heterologously
  expressed Δ6- and Δ5-desaturase). In a reversible reaction, the acyl-CoA:lyso-phosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase (8) equilibrates the sn-2–bound acyl group with the acyl-CoA pool.
  The formation of C20-polyunsaturated fatty acids by the heterologously expressed
  acyl-CoA elongase (9) occurs by elongation of Δ6-C18–polyunsaturated acyl-CoA and
  thus depends on their release from PC into the acyl-CoA pool by the LPCAT (8). The
  activities of the desaturases (6) and elongase (9) together with the reversibility
  of LPCAT (8) and CPT (4) result in a continuous change of the acyl groups of the
  acyl-CoA pool, PC, and DAG, which all participate in this equilibration. Only after
  passage through PC, a highly desaturated DAG is finally converted into TAG. This
  channeling is catalyzed by two enzymes, the DAGAT (5) mentioned before and the phospholipid:diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase (PDAT; 7) that transfers the sn-2–bound acyl group from PC to the
  sn-3 position of TAG. These major routes, deduced by labeling studies with wild-type
  linseed (; ), are supported by the acyl profiles of the various pools (acyl-CoA,
  PC, DAG, and TAG) studied in this investigation with transgenic linseed.
