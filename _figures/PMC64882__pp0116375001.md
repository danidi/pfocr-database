caption: Carotenoid biosynthetic pathway of astaxanthin in  H. pluvialis. Several
  intermediates were omitted for the  sake of simplification. The carotenoid biosynthesis
  enzymes phytoene  synthase (PSY), phytoene desaturase (PDS), ζ-carotene  desaturase
  (ZDS), lycopene cyclase (LCYB), β-carotene ketolase, and  carotenoid hydroxylase
  (CH) are indicated. The gene expression of  phytoene synthase and carotenoid hydroxylase
  (boxed) have been studied  in the present publication.
