number: Figure 2
caption: (A) Direct inhibitory mechanisms over the TCR signalosome are shown. The
  figure represents PD1-dependent proximal inhibitory mechanisms, which depend on
  the recruitment of SHP1 and SHP2 phosphatases as shown. These phosphatases inhibit
  ZAP70 and PI3K activities (blue arrows). Downstream intracellular pathways are also
  terminated, as exemplified in the figure with ERK and PKCθ. (B) Indirect inhibitory
  mechanisms over TCR signaling and T cell proliferation are shown through regulation
  of CK2 expression and activities. On the left, the PI3K-dependent signaling pathway
  activating CDK2 and inhibiting SMAD3 is shown. Briefly, PIP3 activates AKT leading
  to production of the ubiquitin ligase SCF that degrades the CDK2 inhibitor Kip1.
  Activated CDK2 triggers cell cycle progression and inactivates SMAD3 by phosphorylation.
  These pathways are negatively regulated by the PTEN phosphatase that degrades PIP3.
  During TCR activation CK2 phosphorylates PTEN with a concomitant decrease in its
  activities. When PD1 is engaged CK2 expression and activities decrease resulting
  in active PTEN that eliminates PIP3 shutting off AKT activation. (C) Regulation
  of TCR surface expression by PD1. PD1 engagement promotes expression of E3 ubiquitin
  ligases of the CBL family, as shown. As indicated, other ligases may be up-regulated
  as well. These ubiquitin ligases ubiquitylate TCR chains and PI3K, leading to the
  removal of TCRs from the T cell surface, possibly by endocytosis. Thus, T cells
  cannot respond to antigenic stimulation. (D) Metabolic control by PD1. Engaged PD1
  alters T cell metabolism from glycolysis to β-oxidation by inhibition of ERK and
  PI3K-AKT activities. PD1-stimulated T cells would then metabolically resemble long-lived
  memory T cells.
