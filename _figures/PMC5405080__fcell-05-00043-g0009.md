caption: (A) Functional p53 control of cell growth and oxidative metabolism. p53 plays
  a role in its own regulation by diminishing the inhibition of MDM2 which mediates
  p53 ubiquitination, through a feedback loop involving miR-25 and -32 (Suh et al.,
  ). p53 also has a role in inhibiting the activity of oncogenic pathways, including
  mTOR and PI3K/Akt, halting cell cycle progression whilst DNA is repaired (Budanov
  and Karin, ). This cell cycle blockade can be alleviated by MDM2 (Reifenberger et
  al., ). This also alleviates the glycolytic switch inferred by the pathways. Additionally,
  p53 also has its own roles in diminishing glycolysis both directly and indirectly
  through TIGAR transcription (Bensaad et al., ). (B) Differential response of p53
  to different forms of damage. Activation of p53 due to DNA damage (shown in green),
  results in the suppression of phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) causing inhibition of
  the glycerate reduction. This process allows activation of the non-oxidative arm
  of the PPP and production of R5P for DNA repair, instead of channeling glycolytic
  intermediates through the glycolytic pathway (Kondoh et al., ; Deberardinis et al.,
  ; Levine and Puzio-Kuter, ). Additionally, activation of p53 by oxidative damage
  (shown in blue) inhibits the degradation of G6P-dehydrogenase (G6PD), stimulating
  the oxidative PPP phase and NADPH production to counter-act ROS and oxidation (Jiang
  et al., ). These pathways provide protection from extensive DNA and oxidative damage
  in cancer cells expressing functional p53. However, under conditions where p53 has
  been activated in response to other stimuli such as energy deprivation (shown in
  orange), p53 can inhibit these pathways to free-up glycolytic intermediates for
  pyruvate formation and Kreb's cycle entry (Boros et al., ; Christofk et al., ).
