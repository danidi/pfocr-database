caption: A new family of type IV secretion system (T4SS) effectors has been identified
  that localizes to the Coxiella-containing vacuole (CCV) and might have diverse functions,
  such as CCV stability and fusogenicity. Located next to the Golgi apparatus, CBU0635
  interferes with the host secretory pathway on ectopic expression. At least three
  T4SS effectors localize to the nucleus (CaeA, CBU1314 and CBU1976) when ectopically
  expressed in host cells, and these proteins might be involved in the transcriptional
  modulation that occurs during Coxiella burnetii infection. Exogenously stimulated
  apoptosis is modulated by C. burnetii, and an ankyrin repeat-containing protein
  (AnkG) has anti-apoptotic activity through an interaction with p32, a host protein
  that is involved in pathogen-induced apoptosis. A second T4SS effector, CaeB, alters
  mitochondrial membrane permeability during exogenously stimulated apoptosis. C.
  burnetii infection also increases the synthesis of anti-apoptotic proteins BCL2-related
  protein A1 (BCL2A1; also known as BFL1) and cIAP2 (also known as BIRC3) and causes
  activation of the pro-survival kinases AKT, ERK1 and ERK2. Other effectors might
  also be involved in the modulation of apoptosis. Several T4SS effectors have F-box
  domains and are potentially involved in promoting proteasome-mediated degradation
  of proteins; these effectors include CpeC, which localizes to ubiquitin-rich compartments
  in host cells. The effector CpeB has been localized to the autophagosome, and AnkA,
  AnkB and AnkF localize to the cytoplasm. Dashed arrows represent predicted effector
  functions that have not yet been experimentally demonstrated. All T4SS effectors
  are shown as green circles. BECN1, beclin 1; LCV, large cell variant; PKA, protein
  kinase A; SCV, small cell variant.
