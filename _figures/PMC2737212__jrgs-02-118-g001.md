caption: Schematic depiction the RNAi pathway, highlighting the involvement of C.
  elegans proteins that participate in the RNAi response to exogenously introduced
  dsRNA. Exogenous dsRNA initiates RNAi by being processed into siRNA by the Dicer
  complex, which includes the RNaseIII nuclease DCR-1, the dsRNA binding protein RDE-4,
  the PAZ-PIWI protein RDE-1 and the Dicer related helicase DRH-1. RDE-1 binds siRNAs
  and is proposed to bring them to the next step of the RNAi pathway. At this point,
  siRNA is either degraded by the negative regulator ERI-1 or incorporated into RISC
  (RNAi induced silencing complex). Other components of RISC include the Tudor-SN
  related protein TSN-1, VIG-1 and possibly an unidentified PAZPIWI/Argonaute related
  protein (please see text for details). RISC then targets and cleaves the mature
  mRNA. Another complex containing either the RRF-1 (somatic) or EGO-1 (germ line)
  RdRP (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and RDE-3 uses siRNAs to amplify the target
  mRNA to produce additional dsRNA, which in turn is processed by the Dicer complex
  to form secondary siRNAs. The secondary siRNAs associate with RISC to perform transitive
  RNAi. Amplification could also be facilitated by a complex containing MUT-7 and
  RDE-2. The RRF-3 RdRP, which is not essential for RNAi, is postulated to inhibit
  RNAi by competing for components with RRF-1 or EGO-1.
