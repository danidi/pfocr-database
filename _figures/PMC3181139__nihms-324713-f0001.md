caption: Antigen presentation pathways in DCs. In the MHC class I presentation pathway,
  cytosolic antigens are targeted for proteasomal degradation. The resulting antigenic
  peptides associate with MHC class I molecules in the ER and are transported to the
  cell surface. In the MHC class II pathway, exogenous antigens are endocytosed and
  the vesicle containing antigen is fused with lysosomes, facilitating antigen degradation.
  The resulting vesicle is then fused with a vesicle containing MHC class II molecules,
  and the MHC class II molecule/antigenic peptide complexes are transported to the
  surface of the cell. In the context of DNA vaccines, linkage of antigen to HSP70
  or CRT targets antigen for entry into the ER, enhancing MHC class I presentation
  of the antigen. Linkage of antigen to LAMP-1 of Ii targets the antigen to the MHC
  class II processing pathway. The peptide-MHC complex is then routed to the endosomal/lysosomal
  compartments for improved class II antigen presentation. DC, dendritic cell; MHC,
  major histocompatibility complex; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HSP70, heat shock protein
  70; CRT, calreticulin; LAMP-1, lysosomal-associated membrane protein type 1; Ii,
  MHC class II-associated invariant chain.
