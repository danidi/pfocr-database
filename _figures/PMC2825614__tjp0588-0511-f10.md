caption: Proposed cellular signalling pathway mediating the non-genomic actions of
  DHT in adult mammalian skeletal muscle fibres Schematic diagram illustrating the
  molecular mechanism that we suggest underlies the effects of DHT in adult mammalian
  skeletal muscle fibre bundles. Our hypothesis is that DHT activates the epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR), either directly or indirectly, and this leads to
  an increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The activated ERK1/2 then phosphorylates
  MLCK which in turn phosphorylates the 20 kDa RMLCs and this increases force production
  in fast twitch fibres but decreases it in slow twitch fibres.
