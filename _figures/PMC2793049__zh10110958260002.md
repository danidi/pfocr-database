caption: A model of leptin signaling and leptin resistance. Leptin binds to the long
  form of the leptin receptor (LEPRb) and activates LEPRb-associated JAK2. JAK2 phosphorylates
  LEPRb on Tyr985/1077/1138. SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2)
  binds to phospho-Tyr985 and mediates the activation of the MAPK pathway. Suppressor
  of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) also binds to phospho-Tyr985 and inhibits leptin
  signaling in a negative feedback manner. STAT5 and STAT3 bind to phospho-Tyr1077
  and phospho-Tyr1138, respectively, and are subsequently phosphorylated and activated
  by JAK2. STAT3 and STAT5 activate their target genes, which mediate leptin's anorexigenic
  effect. JAK2 autophosphorylates on Tyr813, which binds to SH2B1. SH2B1 simultaneously
  binds to insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 and recruits IRS proteins
  to the LEPRb/JAK2 complex, which results in JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation
  of IRS-1 and IRS-2 and subsequent activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)
  pathway. Leptin also stimulates a JAK2-independent pathway involving the Src tyrosine
  kinase family members. The JAK2-dependent and -independent pathways act coordinately
  and synergistically to promote STAT3 activation. Leptin also regulates the CaMKK2/AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR)/ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) pathways; however, the molecular steps from the
  LEPRb to these 2 pathways are not clear. These diverse pathways act coordinately
  as a network to fully mediate leptin responses. LEPRb signaling is negatively regulated
  by SOCS3, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  stress but positively regulated by SH2B1.

    phosphatase 2 (SHP2) binds to phospho-Tyr985 and mediates the activation of the
    MAPK pathway. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) also binds to phospho-Tyr985
