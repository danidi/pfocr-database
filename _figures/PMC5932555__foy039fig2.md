caption: Design and application of scaffold RNAs controlling both genomic target sequence
  and regulatory function. (a) Five examples of scaffold RNAs (scRNAs) used in yeast.
  ScRNAs are engineered gRNAs with protein-interacting RNA aptamers. The protein and
  aptamer are collectively referred to RNA-binding modules. The aptamer-binding protein
  MCP, PCP and COM interact in an orthogonal manner with the aptamers MS2, PP7 and
  com, respectively. MCP, PCP and COM can be fused to activation or repression domains,
  thereby enabling scRNAs to specify genome target locus and regulatory function.
  (b) An example illustrating single-cell reprogramming of the expression of three
  genes encoding part of the violacein biosynthetic pathway. (c) An example illustrating
  single-cell reprogramming of the expression of three genes encoding proteins regulating
  metabolic flux through the mevalonate and carotenoid pathways.
