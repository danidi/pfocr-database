caption: GA-inhibited Hsp90 protective pathways in Aβ-induced neuronal toxicity and
  long-term memory impairment. GA-induced Hsp90 inhibition leads to HSF-1 release
  that subsequently transactivates Hsps, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90. Upregulated Hsp70
  have the potential to counter Aβ-induced oxidative stress by several antioxidative
  mechanisms that ultimately reduce Aβ-induce apoptosis. GA also activates p70s6k,
  a key factor in mTOR signaling pathway, which results in long-term memory improvement,
  disrupted by exogenous Aβ. P70s6k activation also reduces neuronal apoptosis by
  activation of autophagy, reduction of oxidative stress and the activation of antiapoptotic
  agents, such as Bcl-2
