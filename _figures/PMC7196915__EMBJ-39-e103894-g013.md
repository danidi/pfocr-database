caption: A, B(A) Schematic of the spatially restricted activation of ROS production
  at the plasma membrane after CIF stimulation (B) Comparison of the components of
  the cytoplasmic/nuclear signaling cascades induced by the flg22 bacterial pattern
  peptide (left) and the CIF peptides (right). Note that all of the signaling components
  in the two pathways belong to the same gene families, with the exception of the
  transcription factors. Components for which there is currently no direct experimental
  evidence are marked in gray, as are arrows indicating activation events that have
  not yet been experimentally established.
