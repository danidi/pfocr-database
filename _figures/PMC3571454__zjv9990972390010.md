caption: Models for intrinsic signaling by BST2 and for BST2 as a virus sensor. (A)
  Intrinsic signaling. BST2 is internalized into endosomal compartments and/or remains
  within the ER, where it recruits a signaling complex including TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2,
  and potentially MyD88 and TRAF2, leading to activation of NF-κB by a canonical pathway.
  The activation of NF-κB is inhibited by substitutions in the BST2 ectodomain that
  impair dimerization (C3A) or tetramerization (L70D) and by substitutions in the
  cytoplasmic domain that impair binding to the TAK1/TAB signaling complex (Y6/8A).
  HIV Vpu inhibits the activation of NF-κB in a manner dependent upon its ability
  to bind β-TrCP. (B) Virus sensing. HIV assembly and/or gene expression stimulates
  the induction of NF-κB by an as-yet-unclear mechanism and at unclear intracellular
  sites. This stimulation allows BST2 to “sense” the virus, resulting in increased
  NF-κB activity, which presumably induces the production of inflammatory cytokines
  by the infected cell. Vpu inhibits this, again dependent upon its ability to bind
  β-TrCP but also to a lesser extent upon its ability to bind BST2.
