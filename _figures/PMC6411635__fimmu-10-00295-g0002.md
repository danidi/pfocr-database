caption: Metabolic reprogramming of T cells after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
  T cells adapt to distinct stressors in order to meet their bioenergetic demand.
  After HSCT, the engagement of distinct metabolic pathways is correlated with T cell
  role and function. Glycolysis is the preferred pathway for GVHD-mediating alloactivated
  T naïve cells after exposure to host antigens, which differentiate them to their
  effector phenotype and increase the expression of Glut1 receptor. Glycolytic reactions
  also provide a bridge for macromolecule synthesis, redox balance and cell growth,
  by producing intermediate metabolites that favor PPP. The generation of pyruvate
  from glucose yields lactate in the cytoplasm or acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA
  cycle in the mitochondria. In alloactivated GVHD-mediating T cells, expression of
  glucose, amino acid, and fatty acid transporters increase leading to enhanced entry
  of these compounds (thick arrows). The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway favors glycolysis and
  suppresses FAO. mTOR also potentiates PPP in these cells. GVHD-mediating T cells
  also use amino-acids, especially glutamine, which enters the cell by the increased
  expression of Slc7a5 transporters. Glutaminolysis yields α-ketoglutarate that enters
  the TCA cycle in the mitochondria although mitochondrial metabolism does not seem
  to be the dominant metabolic profile of alloreactive T cells. In T effector memory
  cells, the main T subset involved in mediating GVL function, FAO is the dominant
  energy source and mitochondrial metabolism is significantly enhanced, leading to
  OXPHOS reactions in the ETC, where higher amounts of ATP are produced, thereby providing
  sustained energy for cell survival. T regulatory cells are protective against GVHD,
  by inhibiting predominantly alloactivated GVHD-mediating T cells but inhibit GVL-mediating
  T memory cells to a lesser extent thereby preserving GVL. Treg cells share metabolic
  features with GVL cells, as they use FAO as their preferred energy source. mTOR
  regulation appears to have a distinct effect on Treg cells, as it is necessary for
  optimizing FAO that leads to adequate Treg differentiation and function. ADP, Adenosine

  description: Metabolic reprogramming of T cells after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
