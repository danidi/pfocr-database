caption: Schematic representation of the interplay between leptin, IGF-1 and Aβ42.
  Leptin activates JAK2/STAT5 pathway (1), resulting in increased levels of p-Tyr694
  STAT5 in the cytosol (2) and its translocation into the nucleus (3). Increased levels
  of p-Tyr694 STAT5 in the nucleus leads to increased expression of IGF-1 (4), which
  through an effect on IGF-1R (5), activates the Akt/mTORC1 pathway (6). Activation
  of mTORC1 results in the increased expression levels of the transcription factor
  C-EBPα (7) and its translocation to the nucleus (8). Increased nuclear levels of
  C-EBPα result in its increased binding to the leptin promoter and augmentation in
  leptin expression (9). Aβ42 inhibits the activation of the JAK2/STAT5 pathway (10)
  and attenuates the levels of p-Tyr694 STAT5 in the cytosol and the nucleus (11),
  resulting in reduced IGF-1 expression. Aβ42 also decreases mTORC1 activation and
  signaling (12) leading to reduction in C-EBPα levels in the cytosol and nucleus
  (13), effects that reduce leptin expression.
