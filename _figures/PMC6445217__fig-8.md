caption: Proposed TCF11/Nrf1-dependent cellular adaptive mechanism. (A) Under unstressed
  conditions, protein synthesis and protein degradation/recycling are balanced, maintaining
  protein homeostasis. TCF11/Nrf1 resides in the ER membrane and is degraded by the
  ERAD pathway. (B) Cytotoxic stress leads to increased levels of oxidative damaged
  or misfolded proteins and therefore requires adaptation of the protein homeostasis
  for efficient clearance. To effectuate the increase in the proteolytic requirement,
  TCF11/Nrf1 is retrotranslocated and transferred to the nucleus. There, it binds
  to the ARE region of the promoter of proteasome subunit genes, thereby inducing
  their expression. The increased expression of the proteasome subunits finally results
  in an upregulation of newly synthesized active proteasome complexes, increasing
  the degradation capacity of the cell. ARE, antioxidant response elements.
