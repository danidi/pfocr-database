caption: Detailed view of protein secretion pathway. On translocation of the unfolded
  protein into the ER, multiple chaperones help in folding, glycosylation and formation
  of disulfide bridges. In the event of an ER overload, accumulation of unfolded proteins
  leads to ER stress. Three membrane transducers, PERK, Ire1α and ATF6, are bound
  to GRP78 under normal conditions. ER stress leads to dissociation of GRP78 and subsequent
  activation of PERK and Ire1α by dimerization and phosphorylation. Activation of
  ATF6 is by translocation to golgi complex after dissociation from GRP78 where it
  is cleaved by serine proteases to an active transcription factor ATF6p50. Downstream
  targets of each of these pathways are shown. AARE amino acid response element; ARE
  anti-oxidant response element; ERSE endoplasmic reticulum stress element; ATF/CRE
  activating transcription factor/cAMP responsive element. Abbreviations for the genes
  are explained in the text
