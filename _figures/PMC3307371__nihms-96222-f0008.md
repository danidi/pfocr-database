caption: Molecular factors and pathways that are boxed with red letters and red arrows
  show our observed effects that we speculate are an early response to exercise modulating
  synaptic proteins; Letters in blue show our observed effects that are down-regulated;
  Letters in black are generally accepted pathways for synaptic plasticity; and letters
  in red show exercise-dependent upregulation. It is unclear whether the sHSP pathway
  precedes the induction of pERK, pAkt or BDNF. The circled “X” indicates the unknown
  factor triggering the heat shock cascade (eg. glucocorticoid receptor or temperature
  change or oxidative free radical). Even rats that ran minimum distances, still showed
  induction sHSP and synaptic proteins (not shown). Pre-synaptic proteins SNAP25 and
  synaptophysin were increased as well as the post-synaptic proteins PSD-95 and NR2b,
  but the localization of the sHSP is not known. The schematic diagram of the molecular
  pathway is illustrated in the post-synaptic density. However, sHSP can be induced
  in the astrocytes after hyperthermia and play a critical role in synaptogenesis.
