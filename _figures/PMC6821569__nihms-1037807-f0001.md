caption: Panx1 and ATP play central roles in the inflammatory pathway. During injury,
  activation of Panx1 channel causes efflux of extracellular ATP, which activates
  the purinergic P2X and P2Y signaling pathway and initiates inflammation. Extracellular
  ATP can also be cleaved by CD39 to from ADP, AMP, which is then converted into adenosine
  by CD73. Adenosine binds with to A2A adenosine receptors that leads to an anti-inflammatory
  effect. Cytoplasmic calcium influx due to purinergic signaling can alter mitochondrial
  function. Intracellular ATP is necessary for maintenance of mitochondrial function,
  autophagy and cell survival. Activation of Panx1 channel causes reduced intracellular
  ATP pool which negatively affects cell survival. Panx1 channel in endoplasmic reticulum
  acts as leaky calcium channel and aids in intracellular calcium influx.
