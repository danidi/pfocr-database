caption: We hypothesize that NF1 inactivation participates in gliomagenesis via three
  distinct mechanisms. (Left) Because NF1 patients are born with an NF1 mutation,
  the majority of tumors that arise are likely to be driven by a second hit mutation
  in the remaining NF1 allele. This event would be predicted to result in an initial
  burst of proliferation and ultimately the development of pilocytic astrocytomas.
  If the p53 pathway is intact (expected in the majority of cases) tumors undergo
  senescence and are unable to progress. (Middle) However, neurofibromin can also
  be excessively destabilized by PKC and the proteasome. Heterozygous mutations in
  NF1 may further decrease protein levels in some tumors. Importantly, neurofibromin
  instability promotes tumorigenesis but is not sufficient to trigger a senescence
  response. Data generated from GBM cell lines and primary cultures further suggest
  that tumors with an intact NF1 gene, but destabilized protein, may be sensitive
  to PKC inhibitors. (Right) Heterozygous deletions or mutations in NF1 also occur.
  We hypothesize that mutations in the p53 pathway would be permissive for a second
  hit mutation in NF1. Such tumors would effectively evade the senescence response.
  Our pre-clinical studies further suggest that NF1-deficient GBMs may be sensitive
  to mTOR inhibitors.
