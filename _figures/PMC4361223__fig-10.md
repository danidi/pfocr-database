caption: A schematic diagram illustrating how DIA differentially affects metabolism
  in normal and G6PD-deficient RBCs. Control RBCs are able to produce enough NADPH
  for regeneration of GSH via GR. Pentose phosphate pathway is up-regulated, and other
  metabolic pathways are perturbed to a lesser extent (left). G6PD-deficient cells
  are impaired in their ability to produce NADPH and to regenerate GSH (right). The
  de novo GSH synthesis is significantly elevated, but is probably limited by cysteine
  availability. Methionine cycle is enhanced, reflecting desperate effort of RBCs
  to synthesize GSH. Ophthalmate is synthesized as a side product. All these events
  lead to gradual ATP depletion, and ADP and AMP accumulation. AMPK is activated,
  and increases glucose utilization via glycolysis. Apparently, PK is partially inhibited
  under oxidative stress. Metabolites marked in red (blue) ink refer to those of a
  higher (lower) level in G6PD-deficient RBCs than in normal cells. Broken lines indicate
  the normal metabolic pathways that are blocked or reduced, and bold lines indicate
  enhanced metabolic pathway. ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate;
  GR, glutathione reductase; NADPH, nicotinamide dinucleotide hydrogen phosphate.
