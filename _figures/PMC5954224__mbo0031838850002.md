caption: Role of glycosphingolipids in Aspergillus biology and pathogenesis. The filamentous
  fungus Aspergillus is ubiquitously dispersed in the environment, and the asexual
  sporulation produces airborne conidia. The inhalation of Aspergillus conidia (1)
  by a severely immunocompromised host leads to germination and extensive hyphal growth
  in the lungs (2), which can culminate in disseminated infection through the bloodstream.
  In growing conidia (1), PhCer and Δ8-9-Me-Cer are produced in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) and transported to the Golgi apparatus for synthesis of GSLs, such as GalCer,
  GlcCer, and IPC. The inhibition of steps of this pathway, by gene deletion or antifungal
  drugs, prevents germination or leads to loss of viability. In the absence of inhibition,
  IPC, GlcCer, and GalCer can be directed to the active sites of the plasma membrane,
  playing a role in polarized growth and contributing to fungal invasion (2). The
  asterisk indicates that after synthesis, IPC can achieve further complexity through
  the addition of glucosamine, mannose, and galactofuranose residues before being
  anchored in the plasma membrane.
