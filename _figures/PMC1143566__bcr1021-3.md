caption: A schematic diagram for the Notch signaling pathway. Upon binding of the
  DSL ligand, Notch signaling is modulated by fringe, and Notch receptors are activated
  by serial cleavage events involving members of the ADAM (for 'a disintegrin and
  metalloproteinase') protease family, as well as an intramembrane cleavage regulated
  by γ-secretase (presenilin). This intramembrane cleavage is followed by translocation
  of the intracellular domain on Notch to the nucleus, where it acts on downstream
  targets. CBF, C promoter binding factor; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HAT, histone
  acetyltransferase.
