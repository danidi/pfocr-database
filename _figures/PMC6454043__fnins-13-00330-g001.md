caption: (A) Ceramide (Cer) synthesis pathways and their cellular compartmentalization.
  The SMase pathway takes place at the plasma membrane, where sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed
  to Cer by smpd3 and reconverted back by sphingomyelin synthase (sms2). The de novo
  synthesis sits at the endoplasmic reticulum, where Cer is synthesized starting from
  the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine by serine palmitoyl-CoA acyltransferase
  (SPT) and then by the action of dihydrosphingosine synthase (CerS) and desaturase.
  Cer are further processed by sphingomyelin synthase (sms1) and smpd2 or phosphorylated
  to Cer-1-phopshate by (CerK) at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Within the endolysosomal
  route, a number of enzymes, namely SMases (acid SMase, A-SMase), cerebrosidases
  (acid b-glucosidase, GBA), ceramidases (acid ceramidase, A-CDase), and Cer synthases
  (glycosyl synthase, GCS), are involved in the recycling of sphingosine. (B) Cer
  cell signaling. Cer are bioactive lipids upstream several pathways and local or
  global dysregulation of Cer amount (yellow) can affect cellular biology at multiple
  levels thus contributing to PD pathogenesis. Cer directly activate PP2A thus inducing
  cytoskeletal dynamics through ERMs dephosphorylation or regulating PD-linked proteins
  (LRRK2, a-syn, Tau). Cer inhibit cell survival through PI3K/AKT and induce apoptosis
  via BAK/BAX. Cer affect also the autophagic flux via Beclin1/Bcl-2 or mTOR. Changes
  in membrane fluidity, membrane trafficking, lysosomal functionality induced by Cer
  unbalance possibly interfere with a-syn up-take and degradation. TLR4 receptor modulation
  by Cer impacts inflammatory response, Cer synthesis itself and the whole body metabolism
  (pink boxes).
