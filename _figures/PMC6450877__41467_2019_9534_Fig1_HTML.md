caption: The currently accepted bacterial F420 biosynthesis pathway. The pathway is
  composed of two branches. In the first branch tyrosine is condensed with the flavin
  biosynthesis intermediate 5-amino-6-ribitylamino-2,4-(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione by
  FbiC/CofGH to produce the riboflavin level chromophore Fo. In the second branch,
  l-lactic acid is phosphorylated in a guanosine-5ʹ-triphosphate (GTP)-dependent manner
  by the hypothetical l-lactate kinase CofB to produce 2-phospho-l-lactate (2-PL).
  This compound is subsequently guanylylated by FbiD/CofC to produce the unstable
  intermediate l-lactyl-2-diphospho-5ʹ-guanosine (LPPG). The two branches merge as
  the 2-phospho-l-lactyl moiety of LPPG is transferred to Fo through the action of
  FbiA/CofD to produce F420-0. Mature F420 is then produced through glutamylation
  of F420-0 by FbiB/CofE. “Fbi” refers to bacterial proteins, whereas “Cof” represents
  archaeal ones
