caption: 'Two primary COX enzyme isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) catalyze the rate-limiting
  step of PG formation: the conversion of AA into the intermediate metabolite PGG2,
  which is further metabolized by different synthases to generate distinct PGs. The
  specific action of the different PGs in a particular type of tissue predominantly
  depends on the cell type-specific expression of their specific receptors and on
  their biosynthesis. NSAIDs (both traditional and COX-2 selective inhibitors, named
  coxibs) act by the inhibiting COX-dependent prostanoid generation. Innovative anti-inflammatory
  and anti-cancer strategies are based on the selective delivery of drugs affecting
  COX-2 activity or expression to specific tissues or by the use of selective inhibitors
  of mPGES-1, which by suppressing PGE2 might augment the protective vascular PGI2
  biosynthesis. In addition, since in CRC COX-2 overexpression is controlled at post-transcriptional
  level through changes in its mRNA stability by miRNAs, the design of therapeutics
  affecting this pathway may lead to innovative therapeutic strategies in CRC.AA,
