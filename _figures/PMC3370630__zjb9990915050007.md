caption: Proposed MBT biosynthetic pathway. For brevity, only the MBT derivatives
  with α,β desaturation of the fatty acyl chain are shown. Fully saturated fatty acyl
  chains are likely to be formed by Rv1347c recognizing substrates tethered to Rv1344
  prior to FadE14 catalysis of the α,β desaturation. Enzymes previously noted as MBT
  tailoring enzymes are proposed to be involved in the precursor biosynthesis that
  provides the amino acid substrates for the NRPS components of the megasynthase.
  Assembly of MBT involves the function of the NRPS/PKS megasynthase, with MbtB, MbtE,
  and MbtF interacting with MbtH. Release of MBT from the megasynthase produces derivatives
  containing β-methyl oxazoline rings. The mechanism of ring demethylation is not
  yet known. ACP, acyl carrier protein; A, adenylation domain; PCP, peptidyl carrier
  protein domain; C, condensation domain; Cy, cyclization domain; TeII, type II thioesterase;
  KS, ketosynthase; AT, acyltransferase; KR, ketoreductase; E, epimerase.
