caption: Model for the apoptotic signalling pathway mediated by NGF withdrawal. Removal
  of the survival agent, NGF, activates the small GTPase Cdc42. Activated Cdc42 leads
  to activation of ASK1 which induces an increase in JNK activity. Presumably, phosphorylation
  of c-Jun activates its transcriptional activity, which then turn on the transcription
  of genes necessary for neuronal apoptosis to proceed.

  description: Model for the apoptotic signalling pathway mediated by NGF withdrawal.
    Removal of the survival agent, NGF, activates the small GTPase Cdc42. Activated
    Cdc42 leads to activation of ASK1 which induces an increase in JNK activity. Presumably,
    phosphorylation of c-Jun activates its transcriptional activity, which then turn
    on the transcription of genes necessary for neuronal apoptosis to proceed.
