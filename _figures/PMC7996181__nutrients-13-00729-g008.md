caption: The hippo pathway and the role of YAP and TAZ in mechanotransduction of SC
  activity. The core components of the hippo pathway are serine/threonine kinases
  Mammalian Ste20-like 1/2 kinase (MST1/2) and large tumour suppressor 1/2 kinase
  (LATS1/2), which act to phosphorylate YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional
  co-activator with PDZ binding motif), to determine the activation state of the pathway.
  When YAP and TAZ are unphosphorylated they are active and able to enter the nucleus
  and activate transcriptional enhancer factor, (TEAD)-mediated gene expression. After
  phosphorylation by LATS1/2 kinase, YAP binds to 14-3-3 proteins, leading to its
  cytoplasmic retention and also to its degradation. YAP activity is regulated by
  the actin cytoskeleton which inhibits YAP/TAZ phosphorylation and which is linked
  to the ECM via integrins. Actin stress fibres connect to the lamin meshwork in the
  nucleus via the LINC-complex, (Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton). Rho GPTases
  are regulated by G-protein coupled receptor signalling which in turn regulates actin
  dynamics and YAP activity (dashed lines). Actin-binding proteins, like angiomotin
  (AMOT) or neurofibromin 2 (NF2/Merlin) are also known to regulate YAP activity,
  either through LATS or by direct interaction with YAP. Akt, a key regulator of the
  IGF-1-mTOR pathway, also binds to actin stress fibres and crosstalks to the Hippo
  pathway by interacting with MST1/2 and by YAP-induced expression of a microRNA (miR-29)
  which inhibits the inhibition of Akt by targeting the phosphatase and tensin homolog,
  PTEN. Copied and modified from Fischer et al. 2016 [] with extra detail from [].
