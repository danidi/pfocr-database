caption: The 5-lipoxygenase pathway. The 5-lipoxygenase protein (5LO) inserts molecular
  oxygen into free and esterified fatty acids with the aid of 5-lipoxygenase activating
  protein (FLAP). 5-lipoxygenase acts on arachidonic acid to produce 5-HPETE, which
  is metabolized into 5-HETE or leukotriene A4, depending on the cellular milieu.
  Leukotriene A4 is then either acted on by LTA4 hydrolase to produce LTB4 or by LTC4
  synthase to produce LTC4. Leukotriene B4 may then act on leukotriene B4 receptors
  (BLT1, BLT2) which are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to initiate second messenger
  systems and produce cellular effects. Leukotriene C4 may be acted on by γ-glutamyltransferase
  1 to produce LTD4, which may be acted on by LTD4 dipeptidase to yield LTE4. Collectively
  LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 are known as the cysteinyl leukotrienes. These cysteinyl leukotrienes
  all may act on cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (CysLT1, CysLT2) which are also GPCRs
  to exert downstream effects. Collectively, leukotriene receptor activation is known
  to modulate chemokine production, immune cell activation and inflammation.
