caption: Glucose is phosphorylated upon cellular entry and isomerized to fructose-6-phosphate
  (F-6-P) prior to utilization through glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  Up to 5% of F-6-P, however, is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) by
  the rate-limiting enzyme GFPT and subsequently acetylated and charged with UDP for
  use as a donor substrate in multiple biosynthetic reactions, including O-GlcNAcylation.
  Addition of GlcNAc to ser/thr residues of target proteins is catalyzed by OGT and
  its removal by an O-GlcNAcase, which together form a single complex. These reactions
  can be manipulated using specific inhibitors, BADGP and PUGNAc, allowing for the
  systematic evaluation of the role of O-linked GlcNAcylation in our system.
