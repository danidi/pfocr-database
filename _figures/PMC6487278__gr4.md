caption: Schematic model for Cbl-b in BCR- and CD40-mediated signaling pathways Activation
  of CD40-dependent signaling pathway is mediated primarily by several TNFR-associated
  factor (TRAF) protein family members including TRAF2, 3, 5, and 6. TRAFs serve as
  adaptor proteins that connect the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 to downstream effector
  molecules, such as NF-κB, JNK and p38 MAPK. CD40 stimulation may also activate several
  protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) including Syk and Btk in B cells. Cbl-b inhibits
  the recruitment of TRAF-2 to CD40, and targets Igα, Igβ, and Syk for ubiquitination,
  thus inhibiting both BCR- and CD40-mediated signaling pathways. CD40 costimulation
  facilitates BCR-induced Cbl-b ubiquitination and degradation, thus eliminating the
  negative regulator Cbl-b from the BCR- and CD40-signaling pathways, and allowing
  optimal B cell activation to occur.
