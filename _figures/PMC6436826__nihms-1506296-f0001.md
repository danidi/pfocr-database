caption: De novo synthesis of sphingolipids starts with the condensation of serine
  and palmitoyl-CoA via the serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine.
  This is reduced to dihydrosphingosine by 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase (3KDHR).
  This becomes acylated by ceramide synthases (CerS) to dihydroceramides. Ceramide
  is generated through desaturation by the Δ4-dihydroceramide desaturase (DES). Ceramide
  can be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase (CerK) and dephosphorylated by lipid phosphate
  phosphatases (LPPs). Ceramide is converted to sphingomyelin by sphingomyelin synthases
  (SMS) and converted back to ceramide by sphingomyelinases (SMases). Ceramide can
  also be acylated by a complex of diacylglycerol acyl transferase (DGAT) and acyl-CoA
  long chain synthase (ACLS). Ceramide can also be glycosylated by glucosylceramide
  synthase (GCS). Ceramide can also be broken down to into sphingosine by ceramidases
  (CDases). Sphingosine can either be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases (SKs)
  or acylated by CerS. Sphingosine-1-phosphate is either dephosphorylated by sphingosine-1-phosphate
  phosphatases (S1PPs) or broken down to hexadecanal and ethanolamine phosphate by
  sphingosine phosphate lyase (SPL) to exit the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. The
  great diversity of sphingolipids comes from the addition of different chain length
  fatty acids as well as modification to the primary hydroxyl of ceramide. This headgroup
  complexity is most evident in the glycosphingolipids (reviewed in []).
