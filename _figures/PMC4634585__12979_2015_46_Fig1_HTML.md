caption: Vitagenes and the pathway of cellular stress response. Proteotoxic stresses
  causing accumulation of misfolded proteins trigger the cellular stress response.
  HSPs that are normally bound to HSF1 are titrate away by damaged proteins with resulting
  HSF-1 activation. Multi-step activation of HSF1 involves post-translational modifications,
  such as hyperphosphorylation, deacetylation or sumoylation, which allow HSF1 to
  trimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to heat-shock elements (HSEs)
  in the promoter regions of its target hsp genes. Nutritional antioxidants, are able
  to activate vitagenes, such as heme oxygenase, Hsp70, thioredoxin reductase and
  sirtuins which represent an integrated system for cellular stress tolerance. Activation
  of Vitagene system, with up-regulation of HO-1, Thioredoxin, GSH and Sirtuin, results
  in reduction of pro-oxidant conditions. During inflammaging, including aged-associated
  pathologies a gradual decline in potency of the heat shock response occur and this
  may prevent repair of protein damage, leading to degeneration and cell death of
  critical parenchymal cells. Phytochemicals and acetylcarnitine act through the activation
  of transcription factor Nrf2, which after binding to the antioxidant responsive
  element up-regulates vitagenes
