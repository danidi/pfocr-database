caption: Adenosine is incorporated into human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells
  by equilibrative, Na+-independent nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-sensitive nucleoside
  transporters (system es or hENT-1). In non-diabetic and diabetic cells the effect
  of insulin on es transport involves signalling through PI3-kinase. Thereafter, the
  main control mechanisms diverge between non-diabetic and diabetic cells. In non-diabetic
  cells, system es is increased by insulin by a pathway involving increased expression
  and activity of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), leading to
  increased intracellular cGMP levels. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) increases
  basal es levels in these cells, but has no effect on insulin-stimulated es levels.
  By contrast, the tonically elevated levels of es in diabetic cells are reduced by
  insulin through a pathway involving AC; inhibition of the NO/cGMP pathway also reduces
  es levels, but does not affect the ability of insulin to reduce es levels in these
  cells.
