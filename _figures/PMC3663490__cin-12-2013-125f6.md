caption: 'Graphical representation of the hereditary breast cancer signaling pathway
  and other pathways (P53, BRCA1, ATR) involved in DNA damage and repair that are
  enriched for SNPs associated with increased risk of developing breast cancer.Notes:
  Gene symbols in red font represent genes containing SNPs associated with an increased
  risk of developing breast cancer. Gene symbols in black font represent novel genes
  not reported in GWAS. Dual ring circles indicate complex regulation involving many
  genes. Lines and arrows indicate direction of regulation. Biological activities
  are indicated in the text mapped to rectangular shapes. Information on association
  of individual SNP-containing genes with individual subtypes of breast cancer is
  provided in Table B as supplementary material.'
