caption: 'Map depicting the pathway of metabolites in glycolysis, the PPP, and glutathione
  pathway of SASP- and 2DG-treated cells under hypoxia (1% O2 and 5% CO2). Cells were
  divided into 4 groups: untreated and treated with 0.3 mM SASP, 6 mM 2DG, or 0.3
  mM SASP + 6 mM 2DG. Treated cells were cultured for 16 hours under hypoxia and subjected
  to metabolomics analyses. White, light gray, dark gray, and black boxes represent
  relative ratios of untreated and 0.3 mM SASP-, 6 mM 2DG-, and 0.3 mM SASP + 6 mM
  2DG-treated cells, respectively, to untreated cells under hypoxia. The graph represents
  mitigated (Cysteine) Cys in SASP-treated cells. Lower values were detected for lactic
  acid (glycolysis pathway) and NADPH (PPP pathway) in 2DG-treated cells. Reduced
  glutathione was decreased in SASP- and SASP + 2DG-treated cells. Error bars represent
  SD (n = 3). P < .05 indicates statistical significance and is represented as ⋆.
  2DG indicates 2-deoxyglucose; NADPH, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; SASP, salazosulfapyridine.'
