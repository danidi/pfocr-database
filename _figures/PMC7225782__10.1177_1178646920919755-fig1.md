caption: Schematic depiction of the host and microbial pathways of tryptophan utilization.3-IAld
  indicates indole-3-aldehyde; AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; IDO1, indoleamine 2,
  3-dioxygenase 1; IL-22, interleukin 22.The panel shows that tryptophan utilization
  via the IDO1 pathway leads to tolerance and activation of AhR by kynurenines. The
  panel also shows that tryptophan utilization by microbes leads to the generation
  of indole derivatives, including 3-IAld, with AhR agonistic activity that results
  in the production of IL-22 and colonization resistance. The 2 pathways thus converge
  on AhR that, in turn, may potentially regulate IDO1 and ignite a self-sustained
  AhR-IDO1 activation loop. Collectively, the host and microbial pathways of tryptophan
  utilization contribute to disease tolerance and homeostasis. Details and abbreviations
  are described in the text.
