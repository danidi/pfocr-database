caption: Comparison of the intracellular pattern recognition receptors and signaling
  pathways involved in the recognition of pathogenic microorganisms by animal and
  plant cells. Recognition and signaling pathway mediated by animal and plant nucleotide
  binding domain (NBD) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) superfamily proteins (NLR) are
  shown as examples of intracellular microbial recognition. Caspase-activated recruitment
  domains (CARD), central nucleotide-binding (NACHT), pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs), microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), danger-associated
  molecular patterns (DAMPs), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), nuclear factor
  kappa B (NF-kB), interleukin (IL), NLR family pyrin domain containing (NLPR), reactive
  oxygen species (ROS).
