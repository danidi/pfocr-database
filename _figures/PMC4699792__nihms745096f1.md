caption: Nucleus Accumbens Medium Spiny Neuron postsynapse depicting elements of a
  mechanistic scheme for increased incentive effects of palatable foods and cues.
  Relative to the ad libitum fed state (above) food restriction (below) is associated
  with a decrease in basal and stimulated dopamine release which leads to compensatory
  upregulation of stimulus-induced signaling downstream of the D1 receptor. This,
  and decreased levels of the phosphatase, calcineurin, increase phosphorylation of
  GluA1 at Ser845. In addition, food restriction-induced insertion of GluA2-lacking
  Ca2+-permeable AMPARs increases excitatory synaptic strength and enables Ca2+-dependent
  signaling, a second pathway to Ser845 phosphorylation, and trafficking of GluA1-containing
  AMPARs to the extrasynaptic membrane, increasing the pool positioned for synaptic
  insertion.
