caption: The central role of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in type 2 immunity.
  Allergens or viral infection trigger the epithelium to express the stress signals
  thymic stromal lymphopoietin TSLP, interleukin-25 (IL-25) and IL-33. In response
  to these cytokines, ILC2s undergo proliferation and produce large amounts of IL-4,
  IL-5 and IL-13. Additionally, dendritic cells (DCs) are also stimulated towards
  a T helper type 2 (Th2) -inducing phenotype. IL-4 and IL-13 cooperate to activate
  B cells that produce antigen-specific IgE, which binds to the high affinity FcεRI
  on mast cells. Upon secondary antigen exposure, primed mast cells degranulate and
  release histamine, leukotrienes and prostaglandins that are responsible for airway
  hyper-responsiveness. Furthermore, IL-5 is a chemoattractant for eosinophils, which
  are well-equipped to cause inflammation. When Th2 cells come into play, ILC2s are
  stimulated further by the IL-2 they produce, resulting in a positive feedback loop.
  The ILC2s may also produce amphiregulin and can therefore play a role in restoring
  epithelial integrity after viral infection. An alternative pathway to activating
  ILC2s is possible via leukotriene D4 and a recent study has shown an inhibitory
  effect of lipoxin XA4 on ILC2s (see text for further information).
