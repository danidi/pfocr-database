caption: Synthesis, storage, and release of BDNF. a The pre-pro-BDNF is synthesized
  and sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Pro-BDNF then transits the Golgi
  apparatus and accumulates in membrane stacks of the trans-Golgi network. The trans-Golgi
  network can be thought of as a major protein sorting station inside the cell. At
  this point, two types of secretory pathways exist. Secretion via the constitutive
  pathway does not rely on extracellular signals or any triggering events. In the
  regulated pathway, fusion of the secretory granules with the plasma membrane is
  triggered by an intracellular rise in Ca2+. The binding of the pro form with sortiline
  and the mature form with carboxipeptidase E is required to address the pro-BDNF
  in the regulated pathway (modified from Fig. 2 in []; with permission. b Scheme
  of the signaling involved in postsynaptic regulated BDNF secretion. BDNF secretion
  required a postsynaptic rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. This Ca2+ rise
  can result from an influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) or NMDA
  receptors upon membrane depolarization or from activation of internal Ca2+ stores
  (IP3-R) following the activation of metabotropic glutamatergic receptors (mGluRs).
  The initial Ca2+ rise can be amplified by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ secretion via ryanodine
  receptors (Rya-Rs). Ca2+ activates CaMKII leading to the fusion of the secretory
  granules. Basal levels of PKA activation “gate” BDNF secretion
