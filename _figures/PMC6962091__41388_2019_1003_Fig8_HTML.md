caption: EBNA1 alters the cellular oxidative balance to promote cell immortalization
  and oncogenesis. EBNA1 is the only viral protein regularly expressed in all types
  of EBV carrying normal and malignant cells. The expression of EBNA1 is associated
  with a shift of the cellular redox status that correlates with transcriptional activation
  of the catalytic subunit of the NADPH oxidase NOX2. High levels of ROS are required
  for efficient expression of cellular and viral genes that sustain B-cell proliferation
  and immortalization, including the viral latent membrane protein LPM1. While inducing
  the establishment of an oxidative environment that promotes infection, EBNA1 limits
  the antiproliferative response triggered by oxidated DNA via activation of both
  the nucleotide sanitization pathway that prevents the incorporation of oxidated
  nucleotides, and repair pathways that purge DNA from oxidized bases. The persistent
  oxidative stress induced by EBNA1 is associated with genomic instability, which
  promotes carcinogenesis and renders EBV infected cells particularly sensitive to
  disturbance of the redox balance by the inhibition of antioxidant pathways
