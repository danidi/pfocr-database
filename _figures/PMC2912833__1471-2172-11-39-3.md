caption: Generation of a biological network of genes of the most significant Canonical
  Pathways for the EF·CIF (Il10-/- vs. C57) comparison. The network was generated
  by IPA using all molecules from significantly affected Canonical Pathways (Fatty
  Acid Metabolism; LPS/IL-1 mediated inhibition of RXR function; Tryptophan Metabolism;
  β-Alanine Metabolism; Valine, Leucine and Isoleucine Degradation; Antigen Presentation
  Pathway; Interferon Signaling; IL-10 Signaling; Fatty Acid Elongation in Mitochondria).
  Connections were applied based on known interactions between these genes within
  the Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. Central genes and their direct interactions
  were identified and were supported by published information. *Genes that are detected
  2 or more times on the array.Genes or gene products are represented as nodes, and
  the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a line (i.e. an
  edge). All edges are supported by at least 1 reference from the literature. Red
  and green colored nodes indicate genes with up- and down-regulated expression, respectively.
  The intensity of the colors specifies the degree of up- or down-regulation. Greater
  intensity represents a higher level of differential expression. Nodes and edges
  are displayed with various shapes and labels that present the functional class of
  genes and the nature of the relationships between the nodes, as shown in legend
  below the figure.
