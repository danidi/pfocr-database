caption: Regulation of HIF-dependent and -independent pathways by Siah2 on tumorigenesis
  and metastasis. Siah2 regulates the tumor growth stage by degradation of SPRY2 and
  subsequent activation of the Ras-ERK pathway, which is HIF-independent. Metastatic
  stage is also regulated by Siah2 through its effect on the PHD3-HIF pathway, which
  involves the growth or angiogenic ability of metastatic cells as well as maintaining
  their viability.
