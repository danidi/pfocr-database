caption: mTORC1 is activated by amino acids, such as leucine, HMB, and arginine. mTORC1
  phosphorylates substrates, such as 4EBP and S6K, and increases protein synthesis.
  Moreover, in the presence of these amino acids, mTORC1 suppresses starvation signals,
  such as autophagy. Amino acids (leucine, HMB, and arginine) can activate Akt, leading
  to mTORC1 activation and FOXO1 suppression [,,,]. FOXO1 is a transcription factor
  that induces muscle atrophy. Suppression of FOXO1 transcriptional activity leads
  to decreased autophagy. Leucine interacts with Sestrin 1 or Sestrin 2 [,], and arginine
  interacts with CASTOR1 and activates mTORC1 []. The nature of the molecules involved
  in the amino acid-mediated pathway (e.g., the differences among leucine, HMB, and
  arginine) warrants further clarification. Leu, leucine; HMB, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate;
