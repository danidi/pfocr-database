caption: A) In this model, EDC bind with equal affinity to estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1,
  ER) located in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm/nucleus, and can also act through
  the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) pathway. The EDC can also bind and
  signal through all of these receptors and disrupt estrogen signaling in this manner.
  B) Conversely, EDC may preferentially bind and activate membrane ESR1 (mESR1) relative
  to those located in the cytoplasm/nucleus, resulting in the EDC have more potent
  non-genomic effects in terms of disrupting mESR1 rather than nuclear ESR1 (nESR1)
  signaling. C) By inhibiting the DHHC-7 and -21 palmitoylacyltransferases, some EDC
  might reduce palmitoylation and shuttling of ESRs to the plasma membrane, which
  would result in decreased mESR1 signaling compared to nESR1 signaling. EDCs might
  also disrupt membrane ESR1 action by reducing expression of caveolin 1 3, which
  are essential for mESR1 action. D) EDC can potentially increase the transcription
  and translation of the depalmitoylating enzymes, acyl protein thioesterase(s) (APT1
  and APT2), leading to depalmitoylation of membrane ESR1, decreased caveolin binding,
  and reduced signaling through the mESR1 pathway.
