caption: A diagram of host factors involved in MeV inducible stress granule formation
  and autophagy. The C protein suppresses the activation of PKR, so a mutant MeV lacking
  C protein expression rather than the wild-type MeV induces the stress granule (SG)
  formation. The N protein binds to the eIF3-p40 and then promotes SG formation. As
  a suppresser of PKR, ADAR1 suppresses the PKR-dependent SG formation. The infection
  of Edmonston-MeV strain initiates an early but transient autophagy wave via the
  engagement of CD46-Cyt-1 in a Golgi-associated PDZ and coiled-coil motif-containing
  protein (GOPC)-dependent pathway. Moreover, the expression of C protein can induce
  an autophagic signaling in an immunity-related GTPase M (IRGM)-dependent manner.
  The expression of H and F proteins in cells expressing one of the cellular receptors
  is also sufficient to induce autophagy. The Edmonston-MeV strain also exploits the
  selective mitophagy via recognition of damaged mitochondria by autophagic receptor
  SQSTM1, resulting in the degradation of mitochondrion-tethered mitochondrial antiviral-signaling
  protein (MAVS) and subsequent attenuation of RIG-I/MDA5-mediated responses. The
  arrows indicate the activation of innate immune responses while the T-ended arrows
  indicate the repression by MeV.
