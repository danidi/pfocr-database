caption: Hematophagy and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Platelets adhere to collagen
  at sites of vascular injury through vWF, GPIb and specific receptors collagen receptors
  GPVI and integrin α2β1. This event is accompanied by release of secondary mediators
  (e.g., ADP, epinephrine and serotonin) and generation of TXA2. During this process,
  thrombin may be produced through exposure of tissue factor. These agonists activate
  the signaling pathway, culminating with activation of integrin αIIbβ3, which binds
  fibrinogen (, ). The target for each family of inhibitor is indicated by a number.
  The target for PAF phosphorylcholine hydrolase is not shown. The name of each inhibitor
  is shown beside each picture exemplifying a different hematophagous animal found
  in different genus and/or species. Epi, epinephrine; 5HT, serotonin.
