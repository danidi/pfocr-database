caption: Overall, pyrazole significantly up-regulate E-cadherin expression and regulated
  MMP-2 expression in A549 cells. Moreover, pyrazole inhibited the expression of TNF-α
  and NF-κB-p65 which specifically blocked NF-κB activation which was stimulated by
  TNF-α. The above anti-cancer effect was also substantiated by the role of pyrazole
  in regulating LPS-induced levels of cytokines and inflammatory mediators such as
  IL-6, TNF-α, iNOS and COX-2 in A549 cells as represented in the .
