caption: SETBP1 gene mutations avoid ubiquitin binding causing a greater stability
  of the SETBP1 protein. In absence of protein degradation, SETBP1 binds SET and the
  SETBP1-SET complex inhibits PP2A. Moreover, through its activity as a transcription
  regulator, SETBP1 acts on the expression level of the MYB, HOXA, RUNX1 genes and
  some targets of the TGF-β signaling pathway, activating a stem cell signature that
  includes apoptosis, differentiation and self-renewal. Milder effects are observed
  in the case of SETBP1 overexpression.
