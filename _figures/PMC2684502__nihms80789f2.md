caption: 'CLR-based networks of genes whose expression changed significantly due to
  aminoglycoside (gentamicin or kanamycin) treatment. In this figure, upregulated
  gene expression is shown in green, downregulated gene expression is in yellow, and
  non-perturbed gene expression is shown in light blue. Overlaid on these networks
  are the outliers from a screen of the single-deletion knockout (KO) library grown
  in the presence of 5µg/ml gentamicin (increased growth of KO, red rim; decreased
  growth of KO, blue rim; no change in growth of KO, black rim). We note that no single-knockouts
  of genes in these networks show decreased growth in the presence of gentamicin.
  (A) Network of genes showing pathway enrichment for the electron transport chain
  (ETC), tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and respiration (p < 10−11), and transcription
  factor enrichment for metabolic regulators including ArcA (p = 1.8×10−12). (B) Network
  of genes showing pathway enrichment for the response to misfolded proteins (p =
  1×10−17) and the heat shock sigma factor, σH (RpoH: p = 1.2×10−11).'
