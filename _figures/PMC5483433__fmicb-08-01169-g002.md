caption: Schematic of the potential roles of miR-M4-5p and miR-K12-11 in regulating
  the TGF-β signaling pathway and promoting tumorigenesis. (A) In normal cell metabolism
  (blue arrows), c-Myc is down regulated by the phosphorylated SMAD2/3 complex, which
  is induced by LTBP1 binding to its receptor. During GaHV2 infection (red arrows),
  miR-M4-5p suppresses the expression levels of LTBP1, leading to reduction of the
  active SMAD2/3 complex, inducing increased expression of c-Myc. The potential combination
  of c-Myc and the GaHV2-specific oncoprotein, MEQ, promotes cellular transformation.
  (B) In normal cell metabolism (blue arrows), activated SMAD5 inhibits target gene
  expression. During KSHV infection (red arrows), miR-K12-11 inhibits the expression
  of SMAD5. Through abolishing the TGF-β signaling pathway, miR-K12-11 blocks cell
  cycle arrest to promote cellular transformation. (A,B) are adapted from  and , respectively.
