caption: Genomic mutations and PD-1 signal inhibitors. (1) Genetic mutations in cancer
  cells create neo-antigens. (2) Neo-antigens are expressed on the surface of the
  cancer cells. (3) Recognition of a neo-antigen as a foreign body by an APC induces
  a T-cell response, and (4) consequently activates T cells and B cells. (5) Activated
  T cells release IFN-γ. (6) A cancer cell that is exposed to IFN-γ expresses PD-L1,
  thereby establishing an acquired immune resistance. In this particular tumor microenvironment,
  PD-1 signal inhibitors appear to be effective; thus, genome-wide mutation analysis
  (i.e., Mutanome) of cancer cells using next-generation sequencing technology and
  diversity analysis of the T-cell or B-cell repertoire (i.e., Immunome) are valuable
  next strategies for identifying predictive biomarkers []. APC, antigen-presenting
