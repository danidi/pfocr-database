caption: Mitophagy and microglia activation in Alzheimer disease. (A) Increased release
  of extra-synaptic glutamate from astrocytes, which results in extra-synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate
  (NMDA) receptors activation, accompanied by the interference of Aβ oligomers with
  those receptors and inhibition of pro-survival pathways, triggering the pro-apoptotic
  signaling pathway. This phenomenon leads to dendritic spine loss and postsynaptic
  depression. (B) Microglia activation, which is induced by Aβ oligomers, proceeds
  inflammation and neurodegeneration via interference with immunological processes
  in the brain. (C) Impaired mitophagy represented as phagophore and mitolysosme blockage
  is promoted by p-tau, which leads to an energy production decline and increased
  oxidative stress, (D), which causes APP processing by β secretase and γ secretase/PS1.
  Accumulation of Aβ and P-Tau participate in mitophagy impairment, which initiates
  a vicious cycle.
