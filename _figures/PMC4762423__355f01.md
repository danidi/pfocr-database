caption: Metabolism reprogramming in PDAC. KRAS-driven PDAC is characterized by enhanced
  glycolysis, including increased glucose uptake and lactate production. Oncogenic
  KRAS also promotes the efflux of lactate to mitigate the toxic effect of intracellular
  lactate accumulation due to elevated glycolysis. The flux of glycolysis intermediates
  was directed by oncogenic KRAS into biosynthetic pathways, including the nonoxidative
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) for nucleotide biosynthesis and the hexosamine biosynthesis
  pathway (HBP) to support glycosylation. The reprogramming of glucose metabolism
  in PDAC cells by oncogenic KRAS is mediated by up-regulation of multiple enzymes
  in a MYC-dependent manner. Oncogenic KRAS also induces a noncanonical glutamine
  metabolism pathway to maintain redox homeostasis in PDAC cells through the induction
  of aspartate transaminase 1 (GOT1) expression. The redox balance is also maintained
  by KRAS-mediated activation of NRF2, which is a master transcription factor for
  antioxidant genes. Another feature of PDAC metabolism is the activation of nutrient
  salvage pathways to fuel tumor growth. Oncogenic KRAS induces macropinocytosis and
  uptake of protein from extracellular space, which leads to lysosomal degradation
  and the release of nutrients to support the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In addition,
  KRAS-driven PDAC cells are also characterized by increased autophagy, which leads
  to the degradation of organelles and proteins and the production of amino acids
  and other components that support metabolism. The activation of autophagy is achieved
  through the MiT/TFE-mediated expression of autophagy and lysosome genes. Enzymes
  whose expression is induced in oncogenic KRAS are indicated in red. (GFPT1) Glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate
  aminotransferase 1; (ME1) malic enzyme 1; (ROS) reactive oxygen species; (RPE) ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase;
  (RPIA) ribulose-5-phosphate isomerase.
