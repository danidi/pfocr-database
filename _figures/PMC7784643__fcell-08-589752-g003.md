caption: AhR enhances intestinal barrier function. (i) AhR is identified as fulcrum
  of an enteric nervous system-specific surveillance pathway that regulates intestinal
  peristalsis in response to microbial colonization, maintaining gut homeostasis and
  host defense. (ii) AHR in ISC stabilizes gut epithelial barrier function and controls
  the regeneration of gut ILEs. (iii) AhR upregulates epithelial tight junction protein
  the tight junction between IECs. (iv) AhR is expressed by many adaptive and innate
  immune cells in the lamina propria, including macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils,
  DCs, B cells and T cells, AhR signaling is pivotal to the regulation of mucosal
  intestinal immune responses. AhR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; AMPs, anti-microbial
  peptides; RELM-β, resistin-like molecule β; Reg3-γ, regenerating Islet Derived Protein-γ;
  Reg3-β, regenerating Islet Derived Protein-β.
