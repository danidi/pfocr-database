caption: Mechano-transduction in cells is mediated through integrin activation upon
  binding to the ECM components, such as fibronectin. Syndecans (S) facilitate this
  interaction by binding the ECM with HS chains. Intracellular syndecan domains activate
  signaling with PKCα (P) and via binding to PDZ-motif proteins. Integrin activation
  recruits a host of focal adhesion components, including integrin-binding adaptor
  proteins – talin and paxillin (PX); actin binding cytoskeletal proteins VASP and
  vinculin (V); and focal-adhesion associated kinases Src, FAK and ROCK. VASP and
  zyxin (Z) facilitate actin polymerization and connect it to the focal adhesion complex.
  Phosphorylation of p130Cas by Src allows docking and activation of several signaling
  pathways, such as the MAPK, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and others.
