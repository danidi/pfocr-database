caption: Working model for GPR56 signaling in skeletal muscle. In response to mechanical
  overload, GPR56 signals through the Gα12/13 subunit to activate mTOR and downstream
  protein synthesis. GPR56 gain of function induces IGF-1 mRNA expression, which is
  dependent on a functional Gα12/13 subunit. Together, GPR56 signaling is a novel
  pathway linking mechanical loading to muscle anabolism.
