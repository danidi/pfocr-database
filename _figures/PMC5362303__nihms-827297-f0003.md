caption: Network analysis was done to determine the extent of interferon pathway activation
  in lupus nephritis kidneys at flare and after treatment. In flares that ended in
  complete response, the interferon-α, β and γ pathways were predicted to be upregulated
  (A). After treatment, only the interferon-β pathway remained upregulated (B). In
  flares that ended in non-response, the interferon-α and β pathways were predicted
  to be upregulated (C). After treatment, the interferon-α, β and γ pathways were
  all predicted to be upregulated (D).
