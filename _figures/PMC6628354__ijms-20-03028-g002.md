caption: 'An overview of proven and hypothetical oxidative stress signaling pathways,
  where PP2A is involved. Red: Pathway 1; green: Pathway 2; Blue: Pathway 3. Clear
  lines/arrows show pathways that are already elucidated, while dashed lines/arrows
  show pathways for which some evidence exists, but further research is needed for
  clarification. The central player of these players is RBOH: the pathway of its expression
  and activation is controlled at multiple steps of Pathway 3 and it is also crucial
  for the production of apoplastic ROS, that will then re-enter Pathway 1 that is
  also controlled by PP2A. There is poor information on the regulation of Pathway
  2 by PP2A. CPR5 is a phosphoregulated protein involved in SA signaling. CPK5 and
  ERK are Ca2+ activated protein kinases. OST1 (OPEN STOMATA 1) is a protein kinase
  involved in the activation of RBOH. OXI1 is a Ser/thr kinase and RLK/CRK is a large
  family of receptor-like kinases. PYR/RCAR is the ABA receptor and ABI1 and ABI2
  are the PP2Cs inactivated by ABA.'
