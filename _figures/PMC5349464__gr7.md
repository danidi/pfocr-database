caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed signaling pathway involved in
  Ang II-induced AT1R/IL-6/MMP-9-dependent cell migration. In HASMCs, Ang II induces
  MMP-9 expression via the AT1R/NADPH oxidase/ROS/NF-κB/IL-6 pathway. Moreover, CORM-2
  can inhibit cell migration via inhibition of the activation of AT1R/NADPH oxidase/ROS/NF-κB/IL-6/IL-6R/MMP-9.
