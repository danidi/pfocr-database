caption: 'Potential mechanisms of action for LINGO-1 and speculative AMIGO3 signaling
  in oligodendroglia.(A) LINGO-1 is able to bind to ErbB2 and prevent its translocation
  to the lipid rafts on oligodendroglial membranes. When ErbB2 reaches the lipid rafts,
  it is phosphorylated by local kinases and phosphatases. It is not clear how ErbB2
  is then able to transduce its downstream effects but phosphorylated ErbB2 induces
  OPC differentiation (Mi et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2014). As such, LINGO-1 is observed
  to prevent ErbB2 from activating and thus inhibits OPC differentiation. (B) Little
  is known about the role of the actin severing and capping protein, gelsolin, in
  OPC differentiation, however activated gelsolin is correlated with increased OPC
  differentiation both in vivo and in vitro. This is likely due to the alteration
  in actin filament. However, it is possible that further protein signaling could
  be transducing the effects. LINGO-1 is able to bind to and directly inhibit gelsolin,
  thereby preventing the maturation signaling (Shao et al., 2017). (C) A further possible
  mechanism seen largely in dopaminergic neurons but also in oligodendroglia, is through
  the PI3K/AKT/m-TOR signaling pathway. LINGO-1 directly inhibits EGFR signaling,
  preventing the activation of intracellular PI3K (Inoue et al., 2007). Without PI3k
  activation, PIP2 cannot be further phosphorylated to its active form and as such,
  AKT and m-TOR remain inactive. Both activated AKT and m-TOR have been shown to encourage
  OPC survival and differentiation therefore highlighting that LINGO-1 can act to
  prevent OPC differentiation (Dienstmann et al., 2014). Although the ability of AMIGO3
  to signal via these pathways has not been explored, the homologous structures of
  LINGO-1 and AMIGO3, and the fact that the proteins can replace one another in the
  NgR1 receptor complex, suggest it is highly likely that AMIGO3 functions through
  these cascades. AMIGO3: Amphoterin-induced gene and open reading frame-3; EGFR:
  epidermal growth factor receptor; ErbB2: epidermal growth factor receptor 2; LINGO-1:
  LRR and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing protein 1; m-TOR: mechanistic target
  of rapamycin; NgR1: neurite outgrowth inhibitor-66 receptor 1; OPC: oligodendrocyte
  precursor cell; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PIP2: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.'
