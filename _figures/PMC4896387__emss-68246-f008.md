caption: TNF-mediated phenotypical maturation of human DC is controlled by sTNF- or
  mTNF-activated TNFR1, but not TNFR2 and independent of TNFR crosstalk. In contrast,
  signalling by either TNFR augments DC survival, which can be enhanced by mTNF through
  either TNFR1 or TNFR2, and by sTNF through TNFR1, but not TNFR2. In contrast to
  TNFR1, TNFR2-mediated DC survival is independent on the activation of p65, however,
  both TNFR control DC survival through the Bcl-2/Bxl-xL survival pathway resulting
  in an upregulation of Bcl-xL.
