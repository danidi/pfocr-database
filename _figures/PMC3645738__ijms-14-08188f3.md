caption: The unfolded protein response in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis plants have two
  arms of the ER stress signaling pathway, an arm involving the proteolytic processing
  of membrane-associated basic leucine zipper domain (bZIP) transcription factors
  (TFs) and an arm involving RNA splicing factor, IRE1. The membrane-associated bZIP
  TFs, having a cytosol-facing TF domain, a single transmembrane domain and a canonical
  S1P site on their lumen-facing domain, are translocated to Golgi (by some means
  likely involving the COPII vesicle machinery; red question mark) and proteolytically
  processed by site-1 protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P) in response to ER stress.
  The cytoplasmic components of the released TFs (e.g., bZIP28(t)) enter the nucleus
  and activate unfolded protein response (UPR) target genes together with CCAAT-box
  binding proteins composed of NF-Y subunits. Upon ER stress, IRE1 splices bZIP60
  mRNA, causing a frameshift leading to the synthesis of a TF without a transmembrane
  domain, but having acquired a nuclear targeting signal. The spliced form of bZIP60
  (bZIP60(s)) is imported into the nucleus to activate UPR target genes. On the other
  hand, recent studies suggested that IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of specific mRNAs
  may also occur in Arabidopsis (red question mark). It is important to note that
  it is still unknown whether the activation of IRE1 and bZIP17/bZIP28 involve the
  disassociation of BiPs and whether bZIP60 functions as a TF together with NF-Y complexes
  (red question marks). K, kinase domain; R, RNase domain.
