caption: Proposed model depicting the involvement of TIPE2 in the RIG-I signaling
  pathway. In the resting state, TIPE2 promotes the maintenance of the inactive state
  of RIG-I by binding to the CARD and CTD domains. Following RNA viral infection,
  the decreased expression of TIPE2 may promote the conformational changes of RIG-I,
  which allows CARD–CARD interactions between RIG-I and MAVS. These, in turn, activate
  downstream signaling and ultimately establish the antiviral state of the host.
