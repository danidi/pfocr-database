caption: Influence of high CO2 concentration on hormone and stomatal regulation. (A)
  The hormone biosynthesis pathways and stomatal regulation mechanism according to
  Zhao []. The mazarine, green, brown, purple and wathet frame represents ABA, GA,
  SA, JA and BR synthetic pathways, respectively. The blue and yellow block represents
  advanced and early C-6 oxidation pathway in BR biosynthesis, respectively. The different
  enzymes are shown in red font. Sharp and T-shaped arrows indicate positive and negative
  regulation, respectively. (B) Expression changes in the genes involved in metabolic
  pathways in response to stress. White indicates no change, red up-regulation, and
  blue down-regulation in each treatment, as shown in the color bar for a log2 fold
  change scale. The abbreviations in the figure are shown in  from .
