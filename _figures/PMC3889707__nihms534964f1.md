caption: Systemic inflammation, which can be caused by a number of factors, involves
  both innate immune cells and T lymphocytes. The proinflammatory cytokines that are
  produced de novo by these cells affect the bioavailability of amino acid precursors
  of neurotransmitters. Specifically, peripheral proinflammatory cytokines activate
  guanosine-triphosphate cyclohydrolase-1 (GTP-CH1), which mediates synthesis of neopterin
  by macrophages. This results in a relative deficit in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4),
  an essential cofactor of aromatic amino acid hydroxylase enzymes used in the synthesis
  of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin. BH4 is also a co-factor for the synthesis
  of nitric oxide by inducible nitric oxide synthase. Proinflammatory cytokines also
  activate indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) in macrophages and dendritic cells, which
  degrades tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway. Kynurenine competes
  with tryptophan for entry into the brain. Kynurenine is further metabolized by activated
  microglia into 3-hydroxy kynurenine and quinolinic acid, which are both potent radical
  donors. Quinolinic acid acts also as an agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)
  receptors and promotes neurotoxicity. The conversion of kynurenine into kynurenic
  acid, which acts as an antagonist of NMDA receptors, takes place in astrocytes.
  However, in conditions of inflammation this potentially neuroprotective pathway
  is less effective than the pathway leading to quinolinic acid.Peripheral inflammatory
  mediators activate immune-to-brain communication pathways including afferent nerves.
  This leads to the local synthesis of inflammatory mediators that affect neuronal
  function and structure directly or via impairment of the neuronal environment, reduction
  of the synthesis of neurotrophic factors, and oxidative stress. These effects are
  rarely sufficient to cause neurotoxicity but they can easily potentiate the neurotoxic
  activity of a number of other factors. Activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis
  by proinflammatory cytokines under the combined effect of corticotrophin-releasing
  hormone and vasopressin (not shown in the graph) should normally contribute to down-regulation
  of the inflammatory response both at the periphery and in the central nervous system
  via the production of cortisol and the anti-inflammatory properties of vasopressin.
  However, this effect can be compromised by the development of cortisol resistance
  during inflammation. Adverse behavioral responses are the ultimate consequence of
  activation of these pathways. Red arrows signify the direction of change in a specific
  inflammatory mediator, enzyme or molecule following systemic inflammation, processes
  at similar levels, (e.g. both peripheral and central causes of inflammation) highlighted
  with a common color.
