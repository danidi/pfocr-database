caption: 'The posttranscriptional Gac-Rsm cascade of Pseudomonas protegens strain
  CHA0: An archetypal signal transduction pathway of γ-proteobacteria controlling
  the activity of CsrA proteins with molecular mimic sRNAs. (A) In strain CHA0, the
  GacS-GacA TCS responds to uncharacterized autoinducing signals, and promotes translation
  of various mRNAs involved in exoproduct formation and control of plant root pathogens
  (antibiotics, lipopeptides, extracellular lytic enzymes), by relieving the translational
  blockage caused by the two CsrA homologs RsmA and RsmE. This is achieved by activating
  transcription of rsmX, rsmY and rsmZ genes, thereby increasing the intracellular
  abundance of the three sponge RNAs RsmX, RsmY and RsmZ, that sequester RsmA and
  RsmE. Two accessory orphan sensor kinases, RetS and LadS, modulate the activity
  of GacS. (B) Schematic linear representation of the Gac-Rsm regulatory pathway of
  P. protegens strain CHA0. The biosynthesis of a diffusible signal compound is also
  under the control of the cascade, as a number of other phenotypes contributing to
  the antifungal ability of this strain, and it represents a positive feedback input
  for the pathway. This diagram, as well as the scheme in (A), is simplified and omits
  modulatory aspects like the requirement of RsmA/E proteins for a proper expression
  of rsmX/Y/Z genes (Valverde et al., ; Kay et al., ). The number of components in
  the posttranscriptional module formed by Rsm proteins and Rsm sRNAs, as well as
  the nature of the target mRNAs, vary between different species (see , ).'
