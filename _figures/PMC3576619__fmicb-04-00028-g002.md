caption: Models for the retrotransposition cycle of retroelements. (A) The retrotransposition
  pathway of L1 retroelements. A functional full-length L1 element contains an internal
  promoter in the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) that initiates transcription. This
  is followed by two long open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, required for retrotransposition
  in cis. A short 3′ UTR is followed immediately by a poly(A) tail, and the entire
  element is typically flanked by target site duplications. ORF1p and ORF2p preferentially
  associate with their own encoding RNAs (“cis preference”) to form a RNP complex
  in the cytoplasm as a retrotransposition intermediate, and are critical for retrotransposition
  by a “copy and paste”mechanism. L1 DNA synthesis in the nucleus is based on “target-primed
  reverse transcription (TPRT)” in which ORF2p nicks the target chromosomal DNA, and
  then uses the resultant 3′-OH to prime the reverse transcription of L1 RNA as a
  template. Human APOBEC3 proteins have been documented to associate with stress granules,
  Staufen granules, or P-bodies (gray enclosure); however, it appears that the inhibitory
  activity of human APOBEC3 proteins against L1 retrotransposition does not correlate
  with their P-body association.L1 genomic RNA and reverse-transcribed DNA are indicated
  by red and blue colors, respectively. (B) The retrotransposition pathway of LTR-type
  retrotransposons (or endogenous retroviruses, ERVs), e.g., murine IAP, MusD, and
  yeast Ty1. The life cycle of these ERVs includes the formation of virus-like particles
  (VLPs) that remain intracellular. Reverse transcription of ERVs genomic RNA occurring
  in the cytoplasm is called “extrachromosomally-primed reverse transcription (EPRT)”,
  and is a complicated, multistep process. Reverse-transcribed single-stranded DNA
  is thought to be sensitive to APOBEC-mediated deamination activity. The proviral
  copies that have escaped degradation can integrate, but exhibit G-to-A mutations
  that render them defective for subsequent rounds of retrotransposition. P-bodies
  can influence the life cycle of ERVs and HIV-1 in either a positive or negative
  manner. ERVs genomic RNA and reverse-transcribed DNA are indicated by red and blue
  colors, respectively.
