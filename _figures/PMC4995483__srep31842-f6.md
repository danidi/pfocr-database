caption: (Pathway On) The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway is activated by the core
  kinase MST1, which phosphorylates LATS1 and MOB1, leading to YAP/TAZ phosphorylation
  and their sequestration in the cytoplasm by 14.3.3 proteins. This prevents YAP/TAZ
  nuclear translocation and association with transcription factors such as SMADs,
  TCF and TEADs. (Pathway Off) Hsp27 forms a complex with MST1 and accelerates the
  proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated MST1. This prevents phosphorylation of
  LATS1 and MOB1, and phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ, which allows their nuclear translocation
  and their transcriptional activation of genes associated with malignant phenotypes.
