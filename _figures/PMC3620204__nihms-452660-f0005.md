caption: ROS-dependent signaling pathway activated by s-flow, which induces eNOS-mediated
  NO production and subsequently increases mitochondria-derived H2O2. H2O2 then activates
  MAPK such as PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2, which induces Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus,
  leading to up-regulation of the cytoprotective HO-1. (See text for details.)
