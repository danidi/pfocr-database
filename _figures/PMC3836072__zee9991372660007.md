caption: Schematic model depicting the proposed signaling pathway in LH/hCG-induced
  miR-122-mediated LHR mRNA down-regulation. Binding of ligand to LHR induces activation
  of ERK1/2 through the cAMP/PKA pathway. This leads to an increase in the expression
  of miR-122, which causes the activation of SREBPs through its interaction with unidentified
  targets. This is followed by the increased expression of LRBP and its LHR mRNA binding
  activity, which ultimately results in LHR mRNA degradation. Direct activation is
  shown by solid arrows and indirect interaction/activation is shown by broken arrows.
