caption: (A) Crz1 enters the nucleus in short stochastic bursts lasting about 2 min
  after undergoing dephosphorylation in the cytoplasm by the calcium-activated phosphatase
  calcineurin (Cn) (, ). The mechanism through which Crz1 exits the nucleus is not
  clear. (B) NFATc proteins are similar to Crz1 in that they are dephosphorylated
  by calcineurin on similar motifs and enter the nucleus, where they combine with
  other proteins to form complexes on the regulatory regions of target genes (). The
  SRR is the serine-rich region, which is multiply phosphorylated. (C) Feedback loops
  in the calcineurin/NFAT signaling pathway predict oscillation with certain parameters
  (such as concentrations of the proteins) of the pathway that might be achieved in
  specific tissues. k, reaction constant. Occ refers to occluded or inactive state
  for calcineurin. (D) NFAT target genes are activated in a stochastic manner with
  the probability of being in the on state determined by time after stimulation with
  Ca2+ ().
