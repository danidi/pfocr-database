caption: Cancer cells and activated Th cells use similar metabolic programs. Normal
  and cancer cells use distinct metabolic pathways, because of their different energy
  demands. Resting and activated Th cells also have different energy demands, because
  activated Th cells need to growth rapidly. Although cancer and activated Th cells
  are different, in general, they share a similar feature, their metabolism. The Warburg
  effect characterizes both cell types.
