number: Figure 1
caption: 'Cytosolic DNA sensing and pathway activation. HSV UL41 endoribonuclease
  breaks down. cGAS mRNA inhibits it by reaching a threshold required to activate
  cGAMP production. HSV ICP 27 protein inhibits TBK1 kinase by phosphorylating oligomerized
  STING, meaning that TRAF6 will not be recruited, subsequently inhibiting NF-κB activation.
  Additionally, HSV ICP 27 inhibits IRF3 in an alternative pathway that activates
  NF-κB. UL42 and HSV-1 γ34.5 protein inhibits the translocation of p50 and p65 subunits
  of NF-κB by inhibiting the transcription of genes involved in inflammatory response.
  UL41: Virion host shutoff (Vhs); cGAMP: Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP), Adenosine
  monophosphate (AMP); cGAS mRNA: Cyclic GAMP synthase messenger ribonucleic acid;
  ICP: Infected cell protein; TBK1: TANK-binding kinase 1; STING: Stimulator of interferon
  genes; NF-kB: Nuclear factor kappa B; IRF: Interferon regulatory factor 3.'
