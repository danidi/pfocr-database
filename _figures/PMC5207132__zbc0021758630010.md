caption: Schematic representation of proteins involved in the c-di-AMP metabolism
  of S. aureus. c-di-AMP is produced by the di-adenylate cyclase enzyme DacA, which
  is thought to form a complex with YbbR and GlmM. c-di-AMP is degraded by GdpP to
  pApA, which is further converted by the Pde2 enzyme to AMP. pApA can, in a feedback
  inhibition loop, reduce the activity of GdpP, and the activities of both GdpP and
  Pde2 are inhibited by the stringent response alarmone ppGpp. The results presented
  in this work suggest that yet another PDE Pde3, capable of degrading c-di-AMP to
  pApA, is present in S. aureus or that an alternative pathway for the production
  of pApA exists. The S. aureus DacA, GpdP, YbbR, and GlmM proteins have all been
  detected by Western blotting under standard laboratory growth conditions, and based
  on the observed phenotype of the pde2 mutant strain it is expected that these proteins
  are produced and present at the same time.
