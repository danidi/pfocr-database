caption: Community detection in the lung disease graph. Each color represents one
  community, which gathers diseases with the highest pairwise similarity in pathway
  deregulation states (see also Table ). The graph layout is generated with Fruchterman–Reingold
  algorithm where edge length is inversely correlated with node connectivity.
