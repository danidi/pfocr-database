caption: Schematic overview of the fordin-mediated signaling pathway. Based on the
  published literature and findings from the previous study, a fordin-mediated signaling
  cascade was predicted for the pro-apoptotic and antimetastatic effects in cancer
  cells. NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IκB, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase; IKK, IκB kinase;
  p-, phosphorylated; Bax, B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein; Bfl-1, B-cell lymphoma-2-related
  protein A1; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.
