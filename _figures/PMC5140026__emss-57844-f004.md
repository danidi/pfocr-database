caption: MAPK signaling and interactions among other hormonal signaling networks shape
  the amplitude of the jasmonate bursts and downstream signaling. The role of ethylene
  in cross-regulating polyamine metabolism has yet to be rigorously investigated.
  Specific JAZ proteins inhibiting MYB8 transcription are not yet known. MYB8 regulates
  induced changes in the core phenylpropanoid pathway and DH29, CV86, AT1 and yet
  unknown phenolamide-forming N-acyltransferases.
