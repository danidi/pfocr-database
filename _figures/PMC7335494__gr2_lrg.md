caption: Diets rich in proteins, lipids and carbohydrates induce the production of
  pro-inflammatory molecules that lead to the activation of several inflammatory pathways
  including JAK/STAT pathway, NF-Kβ pathway and MAPK kinase cascade. These pathways
  lead to oxidative stress, as wells as, COX-2, TNF-α, and interleukins production
  via transcriptional regulation ultimately leading to chronic inflammation. Oxidative
  stress either directly or via metabolic dysfunctions causing e.g insulin resistance,
  as well as the rest of the inflammatory molecules as a result of unhealthy diet
  promote the onset of several chronic diseases including CVD, neurodegenerative diseases,
  autoimmunity, pulmonary diseases and are-related frailty; (NF-kβ – nuclear factor
  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells heterodimer, consisting of p50,
  p65 and IkBα proteins; STAT3 – Signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; ERK/MAPK – mitogen-activated protein kinases; JNK – c-Jun N-terminal kinases;
  COX-2 – cyclooxygenase 2; TNF-α – Tumour necrosis factor alpha; IL-1/6/8 – interleukin
  1/6/8).
