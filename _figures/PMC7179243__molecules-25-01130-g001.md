caption: Key pathways of sphingolipid metabolism. De novo synthesis (1) of ceramide
  occurs mainly on the outer membrane. Ketosphinganine is formed as a result of the
  condensation of palmityl-CoA and serine. In the next stage, 3-ketosphinganine is
  rapidly converted to sphinganine. A fatty acid residue is attached to the sphinganine
  molecule, resulting in the formation of dihydroceramide. The final stage of de novo
  ceramide synthesis is desaturation, consisting in the formation of a double bond
  between carbons 4 and 5 in a dihydroceramide molecule. Then, ceramide is transported
  to the Golgi apparatus and metabolised to other sphingolipid groups. In lysosomes,
  the synthesis of ceramide from sphingosine under the influence of ceramide synthase
  is called the salvage pathway (2), where complex sphingolipids are digested to sphingosine,
  which can be transported to various cellular compartments. Ceramide may also be
  synthesized in the mitochondria-associated membranes (3).
