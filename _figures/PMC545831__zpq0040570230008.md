caption: Signaling cascades activated by glutamate NMDA/AMPA and mGlu receptors. Glutamate
  activates multiple signaling cascades by activation of NMDA/AMPA and mGlu1/5 receptors
  (A), leading to the modulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr-34 (B) and Thr-75
  (C) and the regulation of PP-1 and PKA activities. Pathways leading to increased
  phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 and increased PP-1 inhibition are shown in blue, and those
  leading to decreased phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 and decreased PP-1 inhibition are shown
  in red. Inhibition of PP-1 by phospho-Thr-34 DARPP-32 and inhibition of PKA by phospho-Thr-75
  DARPP-32 are shown in orange. (B) In the initial 15–30 s of incubation, activation
  of NMDA/AMPA and mGlu5 receptors in nNOS-positive interneurons stimulates the synthesis
  and release of NO, leading to activation in medium spiny neurons of PKG and DARPP-32
  Thr-34 phosphorylation. At 1–5 min of incubation, activation of NMDA/AMPA receptors
  induces Ca2+-dependent activation of PP-2B, resulting in the dephosphorylation of
  Thr-34. At 5–10 min of incubation, there is a gradual increase in DARPP-32 Thr-34
  phosphorylation. This increase is due, in part, to activation of a pathway involving
  mGlu5 receptor/PLC/CK1/phospho-Ser-130 DARPP-32, resulting in inhibition of dephosphorylation
  of phospho-Thr-34 by PP-2B, and, in part, to activation of signaling through the
  adenosine A2A receptor pathway. A synergistic activation of adenosine A2A receptor
  signaling involves (i) activation of an mGlu5 receptor/ERK pathway and, through
  some yet unknown mechanism, increased efficiency of A2A receptor-induced cAMP formation,
  and (ii) increased extracellular adenosine levels arising from both medium spiny
  neurons and presynaptic terminals (). (C) In the initial 5 min of incubation, activation
  of NMDA/AMPA receptors induces Ca2+-dependent activation of PP-2A, resulting in
  the dephosphorylation of Thr-75. Subsequently, activation of a pathway involving
  mGlu1 receptor/PLC/CK1/Cdk5 increases the phosphorylation of Thr-75.
