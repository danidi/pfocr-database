caption: In the absence of IL-7, the ephrins Efnb1 and Efnb2 stabilize CD127 expression
  at the cell surface. Eventually, CD127 will be internalized. Vps34 activity in the
  multivesicular bodies will recruit FYVE and GLUE containing proteins that will allow
  the recycling of a significant proportion of the CD127 chain back to the cell surface.
  Upon IL-7 binding to the IL-7R, the internalized receptor is targeted to the lysosomal
  and proeasomal degradation pathways in a Jak3-dependent manner. The Vps34-dependent
  recycling does not apply to the γc chain, which is always degraded by the lysosomal
  pathway
