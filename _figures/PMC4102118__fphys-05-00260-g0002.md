caption: Ketone body utilization in mitochondria of extrahepatic organs. When ketone
  bodies are delivered to the peripheral organs, β-OHB is oxidized back to acetoacetate
  by the mitochondrial BDH1. Then, acetoacetate gets converted to acetoacetyl-CoA
  by the mitochondrial enzyme succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase (SCOT). The succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA
  transferase uses succinyl-CoA as the CoA donor, forming succinate and acetoacetyl-CoA.
  This reaction bypasses the succinyl-CoA synthetase step of the TCA cycle, although
  it does not alter the amount of carbon in the cycle. Next, mitochondrial thiolase
  cleaves the acetoacetyl-CoA into two molecules of acetyl-CoA, which can generate
  energy by entering the TCA cycle pathway.
