caption: In response to proteotoxic insults, the cell mounts adaptive responses to
  maintain protein quality control. These stress response pathways also regulate stem
  cells. (A) The heat shock response induces ESC differentiation, protects ESCs from
  cellular stress, promotes myoblast differentiation, and supports erythropoiesis.
  (B) Activation of the UPRMT by nicotinamide riboside delays neural stem cell and
  melanocyte stem cell senescence, while dysregulation of the UPRMT also impairs hematopoietic
  and intestinal stem cell stemness and proliferation. (C) Post-transcriptional mechanisms
  of gene regulation including RNA methylation and protein synthesis can regulate
  the cellular response to oxidative stress. However, the precise nature of this relationship
  and its influence on stem cells is largely unknown. (D) The effects of UPRER activation
  on stem cells are tissue- and context-specific. Activation of the PERK branch regulates
  muscle satellite cell differentiation during homeostasis, but results in a loss
  of intestinal stem cell self-renewal during stress. Induction of ATF6 and IRE1 through
  pharmacological means supports mesodermal specification of ESCs and enhances the
  reprogramming efficiency of somatic stem cells. Activation of the PERK branch during
  homeostasis promotes the engraftment of HSCs, and during conditions of moderate
  stress promotes their survival. The IRE1 pathway provides a protective effect on
  HSCs experiencing stress. However, extreme stress induces HSC apoptosis.
