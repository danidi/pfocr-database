caption: Schematic representation of BK-induced effects on purinergic transmission
  in trigeminal ganglia. By activating its specific neuronal receptors (1), BK modulates
  P2X3 receptor function (2) (), and induces the release of CGRP (3). CGRP can either
  act autocrinally on its neuronal receptors (4), leading to the upregulation of P2X3
  receptor function (), or paracrinally on the surrounding SGCs. Activation of the
  glial CGRP receptors in turn stimulates the ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathway
  (5), and promotes P2Y receptor-mediated responses, as demonstrated by the potentiation
  of ADP- and UTP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i (6), which might be associated to the
  enhancement of purinergic sensitivity in SGCs. A significant release of pro/anti-inflammatory
  cytokines is also observed (7), which could further contribute to cell-to-cell communication
  within the ganglion. A significantly higher basal and stimulated CGRP release, likely
  responsible for the upregulation of P2X3 receptor signaling (), together with an
  increased percentage of nucleotide-responding cells after exposure to BK were detected
  in trigeminal ganglia from CaV2.1 a1 R192Q mutant KI mice, which indicates the importance
  of generating and maintaining an enhanced proalgogenic tissue state in migraine
  (see Discussion for details).
