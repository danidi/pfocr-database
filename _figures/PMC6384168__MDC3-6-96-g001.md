caption: 'l‐dopa metabolic pathway. l‐dopa is methylated by COMT through donation
  of a methyl group by S‐adenosylmethionine (SAM). This reaction results in production
  of SAH and, then, Hcy, which is catabolized through two possible metabolic pathways:
  (1) remethylation to methionine, which requires 5‐methyltetrahydrofolate (5‐CH3‐THF)
  as a methyl donor and vitamin B12 (B12) as enzymatic cofactor; (2) trans‐sulfuration
  to cysteine, which requires vitamin B6 (B6) as a cofactor. This latter pathway results
  in the formation of L‐methylmalonyl‐CoA, which is metabolized to succinyl‐CoA or,
  in case of vitB12 deficiency, to MMA. As a final result, chronic intake of l‐dopa
  can lead to accumulation of Hcy and MMA, as well as to depletion of vitB6, vitB12,
  and folate. Abbreviations: 3‐OMD, 3‐O‐methyldopa; 5,10‐CH2‐THF, 5,10‐methylenetetrahydrofolate.'
