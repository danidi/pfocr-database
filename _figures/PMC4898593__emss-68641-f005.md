caption: Signal transduction from G-protein-coupled receptors and integrins. Receptors
  for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) are members of the G-protein-coupled
  receptor (GPCR) family, and signal through Gα12 and Gα13 proteins to LSC and RHOA
  activation. LSC inhibits Gα12/13 function through its RGS domain. Chemokine receptors
  signal through Gαi2 to DOCK2 and other guanine nucleotide-exchange factors (GEFs)
  leading to the activation of RAC1 and RHOA. These GTPases transduce signals to integrin
  activation through phospholipase D (PLD) and PIP5K1C. Integrin signalling is inhibited
  by RHOH through an unknown mechanism. Integrin signalling leads to the activation
  of the αPIX GEF and thus the activation of RAC1 and PAK. In myeloid cells, integrin
  signalling also leads to activation of SRC family kinases which phosphorylate immunoreceptor
  tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing receptor subunits, such as Fc receptor
  γ-chain (FcRγ), leading to recruitment and activation of spleen tyrosine kinase
  (SYK). SYK in turn phosphorylates SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76
  kDa (SLP76) leading to assembly of a complex including PLCγ1, NCK and VAV1, and
  hence to activation of RAC1 and CDC42. It is not known if this latter pathway operates
  in lymphocytes.

  description: Signal transduction from G-protein-coupled receptors and integrins.
    Receptors for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) are members

    These GTPases transduce signals to integrin activation through phospholipase D
    (PLD) and PIP5K1C. Integrin signalling is inhibited by RHOH through an unknown
    mechanism. Integrin signalling leads to the activation of the αPIX GEF and thus

    leading to assembly of a complex including PLCγ1, NCK and VAV1, and hence to activation
    of RAC1 and CDC42. It is not known if this latter pathway operates in lymphocytes.
