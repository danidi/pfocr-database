caption: 'A proposed model for the LMW-HA-induced CD44 interaction with TLRs and MyD88/NF-κB
  signaling in breast tumor cells: The interaction between LMW-HA and CD44 induces
  a multi-molecular complex containing CD44, AFAP-110, TLR2/TLR4 and MyD88 (step 1)
  which then promotes AFAP-110-F-actin binding and cytoskeleton activation (step 2)
  resulting in tumor cell invasion. At the same time, MyD88 and NF-κB, due to LMW-HA/CD44-TLR-mediated
  activation (together with cytoskeleton function), promotes both MyD-88 and NF-κB
  nuclear translocation (step 3) and NF-κB-specific transcriptional activation (step
  4). NF-κB is known to be involved in transcription of specific target genes such
  as IL-1β (cytokine) and IL-8 (chemokine) (step 5). Consequently, the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β) and chemokines (IL-8) causes inflammatory
  responses, critical components in the tumorigenesis pathway. Taken together, these
  results clearly indicate that LMW-HA-CD44 interaction with AFAP-110 and TLRs plays
  a pivotal role in stimulating F-actin-mediated cytoskeleton function and MyD88-NF-κB
  signaling leading to the concomitant stimulation of cell invasion and pro-inflammatory
  cytokine/chemokine production in breast tumor cells.'
