caption: Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1) induces parathyroid cell proliferation
  in secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) through ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) phosphorylation.
  The mTORC1 pathway is activated in the parathyroids of rats and mice with CKD-induced
  SHP. Activated mTORC1 phosphorylates S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) that then phosphorylates
  rpS6 to induce parathyroid cell proliferation. mTORC1 also disinhibits eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor-4E (eIF-4E). Rapamycin decreases parathyroid cell
  proliferation in SHP by inhibiting mTORC1 and by reducing rpS6 activation. High
  levels of parathyroid epidermal growth factor receptor (EFGR) in SHP activates mTORC1
  through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The mTORC1 and EGFR pathways may
  act together to stimulate parathyroid cell proliferation in SHP. P designates protein
  phosphorylation, the effect of eIF-4E has not been determined (?), the dashed line
  indicates the suggested effect of MAPK on mTORC1 in the parathyroid cell. Adapted
