caption: NK-B/TXA2 regulatory axis. The model illustrates extracellular signaling
  (I), intracellular signaling (II), and effector modules (III), each consisting of
  multiple reactions, which collectively oppose angiogenesis. NK-B, which is expressed
  in neurons, erythroid cells, and the placenta, signals through NK receptors to increase
  cAMP and to suppress Ca2+ oscillations. TXA2 signaling mimics IBMX in potentiating
  NK-B−dependent cAMP induction and downstream responses that are sensitive to changes
  in cAMP levels. The functional consequences include VEGF and VEGFR down-regulation,
  decreased cell motility, and increased calreticulin synthesis. The dotted line denotes
  a putative pathway that is not yet supported by experimental evidence.
