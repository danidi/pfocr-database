caption: 'PD-1 upregulation upon TCR stimulation mediates PD-1: PD-L1 interaction
  between the T cell and the APC (or artificial APC consisting of epoxy bead coated
  with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, PD-L1-Ig and control-Ig) in the presence of TGF-β. When
  PD-L1 is present on the bead, iTreg conversion is enhanced approximately twofold
  (left). Similarly, a twofold enhancement of conversion is observed when using WT
  APCs as compared to PD-L1−/− APCS (right). Adapted from Francisco et al., J Exp
  Med 2009.'
