number: Figure 1
caption: The FG and HOG MAP kinase pathways. The two pathways are shown with factors
  that function in both pathways in black, pathway-specific factors for the FG pathway
  in green, and HOG pathway, red. The Sln1p branch of the HOG pathway is also shown.
  The Ste7p and Ste12p proteins are shown in black because they are required for activation
  of the FG and pheromone response pathways.
