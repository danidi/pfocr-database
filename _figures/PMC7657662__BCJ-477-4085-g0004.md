caption: CYB is joined by UQCRB and UQCRQ. The subcomplex joins with a tetramer of
  UQCRC1 and UQCRC2, CYC1, UQCRH and UQCR10, resulting in the first dimeric intermediate,
  pre-CIII2. UQCRFS1 receives the iron–sulfur cluster from the assembly factor LYRM7
  and is assembled into the pre-CIII2 structure with the aid of the translocase BCS1L.
  The incorporation of UQCR11 subunit occurs at later stages of complex III assembly.
  The assembly factor TTC19 clears proteolytic fragments arising from UQCRFS1 maturation.
  IMS, intermembrane space; IMM, inner mitochondrial membrane; Matrix, mitochondrial
  matrix.
