caption: Schematic representation of the signal transduction and metabolic pathways
  involved in the Ustilaginomycetes multicellular growth. Several authors have suggested
  that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase
  A (PKA) pathways are necessary for mycelium development (a simple multicellular
  structure observed in Ustilaginomycetes) (reviewed by References [,,,]). Polyamines,
  especially spermidine, are essential for the expression of the genes involved in
  the multicellular growth and the response to stress conditions [,,,]. Although the
  Rim pathway is not involved in the fungal multicellular growth, it is required to
  sense stressful environmental conditions such as pH [,,], which is one of the most
  important inducers of multicellular growth in Ustilaginomycetes [,].
