caption: The inflammatory response, including the recruitment and migration of immune
  cells to the site of infection and release of cytokines, is mediated by lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS). LPS bound to LPS-binding protein (LBP) is presented to CD14. CD14 maneuvers
  the LPS-LBP complex to TLR4, and LPS, in combination with accessory molecule MD2,
  activates TLR4 signaling. LPS induces activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor
  (TNFR)-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-p38 MAPK pathway and induces the expression of
  TNF-α and Beclin 1 by NF-κB. NF-κB inhibits TNF-α-induced autophagy. Multiple means
  to promote ROS production converge on the mitochondria or alternatively, NADPH oxidases
  such as NOX2 and NOX4. These in turn results in activation of autophagy through
  Atg4 activation, ultimately reducing the binding of Beclin 1 to Bcl-2. TRIF-dependent
  and/or MyD88-dependent TLR4 pathway is required for LPS-induced autophagy in macrophages.
  Moreover, TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of Beclin1 amplifies TLR4-induced autophagy.
  HMGB1 links sterile injury and infection-induced immunity. Stimuli that enhance
  reactive oxygen species promote cytosolic translocation of HMGB1 and thereby enhance
  autophagic flux. HMGB1 directly interacts with Beclin1, displacing Bcl-2 requiring
  the cysteines at positions C23 and C45 within HMGB1. The HMGB1/RAGE interaction
  activates parallel signaling pathways, including ERK1/2 and NF- κB activation. Mitogen-activated
  protein kinases (MAPKs), such as JNK1 and ERK1/2, also phosphorylate Bcl-2 driving
  subsequent dissociation of the Beclin 1-Bcl-2 complex. Notably, DAPK phosphorylates
  Beclin 1, promoting the dissociation of Beclin 1 from Bcl-2 like proteins, which
  in turn induces autophagy. Activation of phagocytic NADPH oxidase (NOX2) by HMGB1
  requires TLR4 expression; the activation of other NADPH oxidases and interaction
  with TLRs is less clear. Thus PAMPs (LPS) and DAMPs (HMGB1) drive autophagy/immunophagy,
  regulating immune, stromal, and tumor cell functions.
