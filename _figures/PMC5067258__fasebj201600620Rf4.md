caption: Schematic representation of inflammatory circuits in previously radiated
  arteries. Previously radiated arterial segments exhibited an increased adventitial
  inflammatory response that was characterized by macrophage accumulation in the vicinity
  of an expanded of vasa vasorum. Previous studies have associated radiation with
  activation of the NF-κB pathway (). The present study identified increased levels
  of 5-LO in radiated vs. nonradiated arterial segments, and that this enzyme was
  localized to perivascular adventitial macrophages. The 5-LO enzyme metabolizes arachidonic
  acid (AA) the LT precursor, LTA4, which is then further metabolized to the chemotactic
  and proinflammatory LTB4. In radiated arteries, adventitial LTB4 was increased compared
  with the release from arterial medium. LTB4 transduces proinflammatory effects by
  means of its high-affinity BLT1 receptor, expressed on macrophages, smooth muscle
  cells (SMCs), and endothelial cells. Blocking 5-LO/LTB4signaling may represent a
  possible therapeutic adjunct to prevent late adverse cardiovascular effects of XRT.
