caption: Mechanism for neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) induction of nonamyloidogenic and
  neurotrophic bioactivity. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22:6) is excised by phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2) to yield free DHA; in turn, free DHA is 15-lipoxygenated to generate NPD1,
  which then activates neuroprotective signaling. These events are mediated, in part,
  by shifting beta-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) processing from an amyloidogenic
  into a neurotrophic, nonamyloidogenic pathway and by inhibiting apoptosis, blocking
  inflammatory signaling, and promoting cell survival. Beta-site amyloid precursor
  protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) (β-secretase-1) activity is suppressed, and α-secretase
  distintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) activity is stimulated, thus down-regulating
  amyloid-beta 42 (Aβ42) peptide release. NPD1 signaling to BACE1 and ADAM10 may be
  mediated via other neuromolecular factors. The ADAM10 cleavage product soluble amyloid
  precursor protein alpha (sAPPα) further induces the conversion of free DHA into
  NPD1, thus constituting a positive, neurotrophic feedback loop.
