caption: 'Preferential activation of the NGF signaling pathway in shock-sensitive
  methamphetamine (METH) self-administering (SA) rats. The figure indicates that METH
  SA is accompanied by increased signaling in excitatory synapses in all rats. Yet
  contingent footshocks led to the identification of 2 METH SA phenotypes: rats that
  continued to press an active lever to receive METH (shock-resistant, SR) and those
  that reduced their lever pressing, thereby reducing their METH intake (shock-sensitive,
  SS). Both sets of rats showed increased BDNF, whereas rats that reduce their lever
  pressing exhibited increased mature nerve growth factor (NGF) levels and greater
  abundance of phopshorylated TrkA, a receptor for NGF. Importantly, the levels of
  P75NTR, another NGF receptor, were also increased only in the genetically prone
  shock-sensitive rats. In addition, several phospho-proteins that participate in
  the NGF/RAF/ERK/MSK cascade were activated only in the shock-sensitive rats. Moreover,
  the shock-sensitive rats showed increased CREB phosphorylation in the dorsal striatum.
  Phosphorylated CREB is known to recruit the histone acetyl-transferase, CREB binding
  protein (CBP), an event that leads to increased H3 histone acetylation, as observed
  in the shock-sensitive rats. These series of molecular events could have led to
  increased GABAergic tone in the dorsal striatum and subsequent suppression of METH
  SA in the shock-sensitive animals. Therefore, the development of molecules that
  can specifically activate this striatal NGF-mediated phosphorylation cascade may
  be of therapeutic benefit to METH-addicted individuals.'
