caption: 'Schematic summary of the photoneuroendocrine control of food intake and
  body weight. Photoperiodic information detected by melanopsin-expressing ganglion
  cells in the retina is relayed via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) and suprachiasmatic
  nucleus (SCN) to the pineal gland, thereby regulating the nocturnal duration of
  melatonin secretion. The box indicates key points of this pathway, SCN efferents
  project to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), where presympathetic fibers project
  to sympathetic cell soma in the intermediolateral column (IMLC) in the spinal cord.
  Preganglionic fibers terminate in the superior cervical ganglion (SCG), innervating
  postganglionic fibers which terminate in the pineal gland. Melatonin signals to
  the pars tuberalis, promoting TSHβ production in long photoperiods (LD) that binds
  to its cognate receptor in tanycytes, and upregulates type 2 deiodinase (DIO2) expression
  and possibly signaling in the retinoic acid (RA) pathway [RARα: CRBP1: CRABP2: RALDH1:].
  Thyroxine (T4) is taken up from the circulation via MCT8 transporters, and in LD
  is converted by DIO2 to tri-iodothyronine (T3), which exerts local anabolic actions
  within the mediobasal hypothalamus. In short photoperiods (SD), the long nocturnal
  duration of melatonin reduces TSHβ production, expression of type 3 deiodinase (DIO3)
  is upregulated, thus inactive metabolites of T4 such as reverse T3 (rT3) are produced
  resulting in a catabolic state.'
