caption: 'There are two cell death checkpoints in the TNFR1 pathway. In the first
  checkpoint, ubiquitination of RIP1 by the E3 ligases TRAF2, cIAP1 and cIAP2 hinders
  RIP1 from binding cell death molecules early after TNF stimulation. This checkpoint
  does not require new protein synthesis. In the second checkpoint, NFκB activation
  by ubiquitinated RIP1 leads to the production of new proteins that can block cell
  death, keeping cells alive in the long-term, which explains why cell survival is
  the default outcome of TNFR1 signaling. However, when cell death is desirable, the
  early checkpoint can be rapidly altered by ligation of the other TNFR family members,
  which trigger degradation of the E3 ligases. Non-ubiquitinated RIP1 becomes a pro-death
  signaling molecule and quickly binds caspase-8 to initiate apoptosis. If caspase
  activity is blocked, RIP1 binds RIP3 and triggers the back-up cell death pathway
  by programmed necrosis. Ubiquitination controls the switch between RIP1’s pro-life
  and pro-death activity: this resolves the NFκB paradox – ubiquitination of RIP1
  prevents TNFR1 from triggering cell death until an effective pro-survival gene expression
  program has been implemented.NFκB activated by TNFR1 drives expression of immune
  and inflammatory genes during responses to pathogens. Some pathogens attempt to
  block NFκB and dampen down inflammation, in order to prolong the survival of infected
  cells. The other TNFRs like TNFR2 can unmask the pro-death activity of RIP1 and
  trigger pro-inflammatory necrotic death. This co-operation between the TNFRs allows
  TNFR1 to circumvent the immune evasion strategies used by pathogens to block NFκB
  activity or apoptosis.'
