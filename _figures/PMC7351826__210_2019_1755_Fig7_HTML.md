caption: The hypothesis that Sal B protects myocardium through inhibiting the expression
  of HMGB1 via activating PI3k/Akt signalling pathway in myocardial I/R injury. Previous
  studies reported that myocardial I/R injury can induce the release of inflammatory
  cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6 and HMGB1, and induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis, resulting
  in the decrease of Bcl-2 and the increase of Bax (a). In our study, Sal B alleviates
  myocardial inflammation by reducing the elevation of these inflammatory cytokines
  (TNF-α, IL-18, IL-1β, HMGB1 and TLR4) during myocardial I/R injury. Additionally,
  Sal B can inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of Bcl and
  Bax. All effects of Sal B are reversed by LY294002 (b). In panel b, the red arrow
  represents the anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of Sal B through activating
  PI3K/Akt pathway on myocardial I/R injury. The black arrow represents that the effect
  of Sal B is reversed after LY294002. Sal B, Salvianolic acid B. PI3k/Akt, phosphoinositide
