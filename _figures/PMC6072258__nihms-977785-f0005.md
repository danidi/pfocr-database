caption: MIR-based mechanisms for CO and mcJMs formation. A) The DSBR model for CO
  formation. Colored arrows indicate the two possible orientations for dHJ cleavage
  resulting in a CO. Dotted strands result from DNA synthesis. The green bars represent
  the CO region, which in both cases encompass the DSB site (dotted black line). B)
  Examples of MIR1- (left) and MIR2-based (right) mechanisms for NCO and CO formation
  upon inter-sister MI. The two initial DSB ends (a and b) and the two DSB ends generated
  upon MIR (c and d) are labeled. The particular outcome of their repair depends (i)
  on the relative timing of formation and processing of the “c” and “d” DSBs, and
  (ii) the specific template and repair pathway employed. Additional examples of inter-homolog
  events and the various repair outcomes of downstream DSBs are depicted in , Supporting
  Information. Orange bars denote gapped regions prone to gene conversion. Dotted
  strands result from DNA synthesis. The green bars represent the CO regions, which
  never encompass the DSB site (dotted black line). The outcome description follows
  the nomenclature of Ref. []. C) Example of tri-parental mcJMs formation from an
  inter-homolog MI precursor. The template switches can readily occur upon DNA strand
  exchange junctions migration towards the DNA synthesis direction. All strands are
  in the parental configurations. Dotted strands result from DNA synthesis. Double-headed
  arrows indicate equivalence of the intermediates.
