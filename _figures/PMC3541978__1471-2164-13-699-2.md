caption: 'KEGG functional modules.A: A pathway module. The module M00009 comprising
  8 reactions is defined for the citrate cycle (TCA cycle) core module and represented
  as a Boolean algebra-like equation of KO identifiers or K numbers for computational
  applications. The relationship between this module and the corresponding KEGG pathway
  map is also shown by indicating corresponding K number sets in the module and EC
  numbers in the pathway map using the same index. In each K number set, vertically
  connected K numbers indicate a complex and therefore represent “And” or “+” in the
  Boolean algebra-like equation, whereas horizontally located K numbers indicate alternatives
  and represent “Or” or “,” in the equation. B: A structural complex module. The structural
  complex module M00163 comprising 12 (cyanobacteria) or 14 (plant) components is
  defined for the type I photosystem. The Boolean algebra-like equation and the corresponding
  KEGG pathway map are also shown. The KEGG pathway map shows the Thermosynechococcus
  elongatus (cyanobacteria) photosystem. Green and purple boxes indicate plant and
  cyanobacteria components, respectively.'
