caption: Proposed pathway for PQS biosynthesis. Anthranilate is activated by PqsA
  to form anthraniloyl-CoA, and this is condensed with 2-oxo-decanoyl-ACP which is
  recruited from the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway. The recruitment and condensation
  are postulated to be catalyzed by PqsB, PqsC, and PqsD. The resulting 2-heptyl-4-quinolone
  is then hydroxylated at the third carbon by the PqsH monooxygenase to produce PQS.
