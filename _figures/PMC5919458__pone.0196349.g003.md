caption: Both routes start with PRPP and are connected by AICAR. The enzymes for each
  step are depicted. The enzyme name’s color and the boxes indicate homologous proteins
  within pathways as well as the semi-enzymatic reaction. It is evident how the imidazole
  group of the ATP molecule along with the pentose of PRPP become part of AICAR, and
  goes into the purine synthesis, while the imidazole in IGP forms independently.
  The red arrow indicates the salvage pathway in which AICAR is recycled into the
  de novo synthesis of purines. The dashed arrows indicate two or more steps in the
  route, and for simplicity the cofactors and coenzymes used in these steps have been
  omitted. *The complex formed by the HisF and HisH proteins is named imidazole glycerol
  phosphate synthase (IGPS). The full names of the most relevant metabolites and enzymes
  are given in the text.
