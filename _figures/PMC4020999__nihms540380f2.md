caption: 'The glutamine-methionine bi-cycle. Cycle 1: In the methionine salvage pathway,
  the original sulfur (orange) and methyl group (green) of methionine are retained.
  The amine group of methionine is formed via a transamination reaction with glutamine
  and the C1–C4 of methionine is obtained anew from the ribose moiety of 5′-methylthioadenosine
  (MTA). Transamination of glutamine results in formation of α-ketoglutaramate (KGM),
  which exists overwhelmingly in a cyclic lactam form (2-hydroxy-5-oxoproline). Cycle
  2: The α-ketoglutarate generated from KGM by the action of ω-amidase is converted
  to glutamate by the action of glutamate dehydrogenase/α-ketoglutarate-utilizing
  aminotransferases and thence to glutamine by glutamine synthetase. As in  KGM and
  its cyclic lactam are highlighted (magenta). Modified from .'
