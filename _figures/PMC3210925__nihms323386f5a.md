caption: '(A) Schematic diagram of the complete 2PG metabolism of Synechocystis showing
  the fate of the first two carbon atoms of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate. The three photorespiratory
  pathways diverge at glyoxylate into the plant-like C2 cycle (via glycine and serine),
  the bacterial-like glycerate pathway (via tartronic semialdehyde), and the decarboxylation
  branch (via oxalate). The first two pathways re-converge at glycerate. (B) 13C enrichments
  of photorespiratory pathway intermediates after 4.2 minutes of 13CO2 labeling. Average
  enrichments were calculated as described in the caption to . The compositions of
  selected 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA), phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and glycerate (GA)
  fragment ions are listed in . The carbon atoms of serine (SER) and glycine (GLY)
  contained in the selected fragment ions were taken from : SER218 (C1-C2), SER204
  (C2-C3), GLY276 (C1-C2), GLY174 (C2).'
