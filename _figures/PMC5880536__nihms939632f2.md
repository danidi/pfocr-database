caption: Pathogenic microorganisms are sensed via Toll-like receptors (TLR) and NOD-like
  receptors (NLR) on innate immune cells (dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages), Paneth
  cells and epithelial cells. This process leads to differentiation of type 17 T helper
  (TH17) cells and type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) under the influence of transforming
  growth factor (TGF)β, IL-6 and IL-1β, and activation of the IL-23 inflammatory pathway.
  TLR and NLR signalling also leads to NF-κB and inflammasome activation, secretion
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and type 1 T helper (TH1) cell activation. Ultimately,
  these inflammatory responses lead to epithelial damage, loss of mucus-secreting
  goblet cells, and bacterial translocation, which further stimulates the inflammatory
  response. Anti-inflammatory bacteria are also sensed via TLR and NLR; however, this
  process leads to regulatory T (Treg)-cell differentiation via TGFβ, retinoic acid
  (RA) and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signalling. Treg cells exert their
  immunoregulatory function via IL-10 secretion. Moreover, NF-κB and inflammasome
  activation lead to secretion of anti-apoptotic factors and antimicrobial peptides,
  alongside recruitment of stromal and myeloid cells necessary for epithelial repair.
  Finally, IgA (produced by B cells) prevents colitogenic bacteria from penetrating
  the mucus layer.
