caption: Nucleotide excision repair pathway. Transcription coupled repair (TCR) removes
  damage from actively transcribing genes while global genome repair (GGR) removes
  damage from the remainder of the genome. In GGR damage such as ultraviolet induced
  cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) or 6–4 photoproducts (6–4 PP) are recognized
  by proteins including the XPE (DDB2) and XPC gene products. In TCR, the lesion appears
  to block the progress of RNA polymerase II in a process involving the CSA and CSB
  gene products. Following initial damage recognition the pathways converge. The XPB
  (ERCC3) and XPD (ERCC2) helicases unwind the region surrounding the lesion along
  with the XPA and XPG (ERCC5) gene products, and replication protein A (RPA). The
  XPF and XPG (ERCC5) endonucleases perform incisions to remove the lesion in a fragment
  of about 30 nucleotides. The resulting gap is filled in by de novo DNA synthesis.
  This system is coordinated so that if one part of the pathway is mutated the entire
  pathway fails to function normally. Mutations in the genes in rectangles have been
  associated with clinical disease. This diagram is modified from .
