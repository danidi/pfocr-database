caption: Proposed signaling pathway for basal and BK-mediated eNOS activation in inflamed
  endothelium. A, in healthy (control) endothelial cells, eNOS is inactive and does
  not interact with calmodulin (CaM) at resting Ca2+ levels. Conversely, eNOS associates
  with CaM at resting Ca2+ levels in HLMVEC pretreated with IL-1β and IFN-γ (cytokine-treated)
  for 16–24 h. Consequently, basal l-Arg-dependent eNOS activity is enhanced in cytokine-treated
  but not control cells. B, in cytokine-treated HLMVEC, prolonged B2R-dependent NO
  production is mediated by PTx-sensitive Gαi/o, MEK1/2-dependent JNK1/2 activation.
  The mechanism by which JNK1/2 regulates eNOS activation has yet to be determined,
  but it might involve JNK1/2-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS in a region that facilitates
  Ca2+-CaM binding, thereby reducing its dependence on increases in [Ca2+]i. B2R-mediated
  NO production inhibits migration of cytokine-treated HLMVEC, which was partially
  reversed in the presence of the ROS scavenger tempol. Impaired cell migration could
  prevent proper angiogenesis and wound healing.
