caption: Figure 1. Proposed model of Phactr4 function in regulating directional migration.
  Phactr4 is localized to the leading edge of the cell membrane where it interacts
  with PP1 to regulate various signaling pathways required for directional migration.
  Phactr4 acts through Rho-Cofilin pathway to control the actin cytoskeleton. Phactr4
  may also function through the Par Complex (Par3/Par6/aPKC) to determine cell polarity.
  Phactr4 negatively regulates integrin signaling, and it may control integrin trafficking,
  which is important for directional migration.
