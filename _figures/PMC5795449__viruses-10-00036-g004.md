caption: IDO1-mediated Tryptophan Depletion. Tryptophan is metabolized by the serotonin
  and kynurenine pathway. Iindole-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) converts tryptophan into
  kynurenine. IFN-induced IDO1 gene expression decreases tryptophan availability for
  viral replication as well as reducing melatonin/serotonin synthesis and T cell proliferation.
  1-methyl-d-tryptophan (I-MT) inhibits IDO1 and may have applications as a facilitator
  to enhance the immune response. Red arrows, downregulation; green arrows, upregulation.
  T bar, inhibition.
