caption: 'Schematic summary to test for dependence of IP-1 toxicity on cell cycle
  arrest. The image shows every aspect of the experimental system that was tested
  in our work. Our experimental results (R) show that IP-1 induces cell death only
  when cells are arrested in their cell cycle. To test this, the pheromone pathway
  was affected at different steps (e.g., S1, S2, etc.). For instance, IP-1 (red structure)
  was altered in its ability to bind Ste2p (green structure) and reduce the pheromone-like
  activity of IP-1 (indicated by S1). Also, different molecules were used to induce
  cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 or M phases: IP-1, α-pheromone, NaCl, NM-PPI, or nocodazole.
  Gene null mutants in the MAPK pathway (e.g., STE50, STE7) and other cellular programs
  induced by the pheromone (autophagy, filamentous growth) were tested for their participation
  in IP-1-induced cell death. The image indicates the inside and outside of the cell
  as well as the cell membrane. Broken arrow lines represent putative relationships
  of FIG1 that may be relevant in IP-1-induced cell death.'
