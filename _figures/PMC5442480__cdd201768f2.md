caption: Model for the interaction of PAP/ANAC017 signalling pathways and PCD suppression.
  Inhibition of mitochondrial function can lead to inhibition of the electron transport
  chain (ETC) and subsequent overproduction of various ROS. Similarly, HL and drought
  stress or chemical treatments, for example, with MV, can lead to ROS production
  in chloroplasts. Organellar dysfunction can ultimately lead to SA-dependent PCD,
  via unknown mechanisms (which may or may not involve ROS production). The MIPS1
  enzyme converts glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) into myo-inositol-1-phosphate (MI1P),
  which is the precursor for myo-inositol (MI). Impairment of MIPS1 leads to conditional
  SA-mediated PCD that requires photosynthetic activity in the chloroplasts. It is
  proposed that at least part of retrograde responses are aimed at preventing PCD.
  In one signalling pathway, organelle-derived ROS signals may recruit NAC transcription
  factors from the ER to switch on retrograde target gene expression in the nucleus
  (indicated in blue). In second pathway, organellar ROS can inhibit SAL1 function,
  resulting in accumulation of PAP (indicated in orange). PAP can translocate to the
  nucleus to inhibit exoribonucleases endonuclease function, affecting mRNA stability
  and gene expression through an unknown mechanism. At least part of the downstream
  retrograde target genes of the ANAC017 and PAP pathways appear to overlap. The target
  genes (indicated in purple) encode a variety of antioxidant proteins (e.g., alternative
  oxidase AOX), toxin transporters and positive-feedback loops to boost the NAC and
  PAP pathways, possibly by the activity of sulfotransferases that can release more
  PAP. Together, these retrograde responses may suppress PCD, most likely upstream
  of SA production. Whether the ANAC017 and PAP pathways operate independently in
  parallel, or are possibly mechanistically linked, is not clear
