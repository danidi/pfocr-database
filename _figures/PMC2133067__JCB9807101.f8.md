caption: Working model of the PTEN regulatory network. Integrins and growth factors
  can separately stimulate the Ras/ERK/MAP kinase pathway or function collaboratively.
  Integrin receptor engagement with FN stimulates FAK, Shc and c-Src, and they activate
  the pathway as described (). Growth factors can activate the pathway through autophosphorylation
  of growth factor receptors. PTEN reduces Shc phosphorylation and its interaction
  with Grb2, as well as the downstream Ras/ ERK common MAP kinase pathway for integrin-
  and growth factor–mediated signaling, and then affects cell spreading and focal
  contact formation. Activated MEK1 can partially reverse the latter effects of PTEN.
