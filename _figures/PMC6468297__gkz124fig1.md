caption: 'Cell stress-dependent regulation of alternative initiation of p53 mRNA translation.
  Alternative translation initiation of the p53 mRNA generates two isoforms, p53 full
  length (p53FL) and p53/p47. The activation of the ATM kinase (Ataxia Telangiectasia
  Mutated) following DNA damage results in the induction of p53FL synthesis from +1
  AUG. The full-length p53 includes the TA I (transactivation domain I) that is required
  for induction of p53 target genes, including the G1 cell cycle kinase inhibitor
  p21CDKN1A or pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax, Puma or Noxa of the Bcl-2 family,
  to mention just a few. The activation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathway
  following stress to the endoplasmic reticulum activates the PERK kinase and the
  initiation of the p53/47 isoform at the second in frame AUG at +120. P53/47 lacks
  TA I but retains TA II and causes G2/M arrest via induction of 14-3-3σ, or a BIK-dependent
  apoptosis by suppressing the BiP chaperone. Apart from the box I, the p53 mRNA harbours
  four other conserved domains (II to V) within the DNA binding domain (). Different
  p53 protein functional domains are indicated: trans-activation domains I & II (TA
  I & II); poly-proline rich region (PPP); oligomerization domain (OD); regulatory
  domain (RD). For a more comprehensive overview of signalling pathways activating
  p53 please see (,).'
