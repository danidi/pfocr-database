caption: An overview of the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system (UPS). (A) The UPS pathway
  begins with the ATP‐dependent activation of ubiquitin by an E1 enzyme. Ubiquitin
  is then transferred to an E2 enzyme, and finally attached to the target protein
  via an E3 enzyme. Multiple cycles of ubiquitin conjugation lead to a polyubiquitinated
  substrate that is degraded by the 26S proteasome complex, releasing short peptides.
  (B) Types of E3 ubiquitin ligase enzymes. See text for details. (C) Structure of
  the 26S proteasome. The 20S core protease is composed of four heptameric rings,
  forming three cavities. The outer rings contain α subunits and the inner rings β
  subunits. Three of the β subunits (namely β1, β2 and β5) harbour a protease activity.
  One or two 19S regulatory particles can be attached to the outer rings. The 19S
  regulatory particle is composed of two complexes, the lid and the base. The base
  contains six proteasomal ATPases attached to the α rings of the 20S proteasome.
  The Rpn10 subunit can interact either with the lid or the base and stabilizes the
  complex. Adapted from .
