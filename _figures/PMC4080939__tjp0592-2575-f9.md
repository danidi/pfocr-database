caption: 'The schematic shows an EC with a process projecting through one of several
  openings in the IEL and thus closely apposed to the underlying VSMC. The left-hand
  version shows the location on the plasma membranes of the receptors and channels
  that we studied directly (or, for the myoendothelial gap junction, inferred from
  our data). Clearly, other transmembrane receptors, channels and transporters are
  likely to contribute to the integrated functional response. The right-hand side
  summarizes the cell signalling mechanisms that from our data we propose link A2A
  receptor activation on ECs to KATP channel activation on VSMCs. Thus, ADO binds
  to the A2A receptor on ECs, resulting in cAMP production. cAMP then activates both
  CNGCs (leading to increased EC Ca2+) and via the myoendothelial gap junction, activates
  PKA in the VSMC. Ca2+ (or a Ca2+ activated signalling intermediate) also then passes
  through a myoendothelial gap junction to the VSMC. cAMP activates PKA and, separately,
  Ca2+ activates the as yet unidentified intermediate: both are required to activate
  the KATP channel and so cause VSMC relaxation. Prolonged phosphorylation of KATP
  channels by PKA results in the exclusion of PKA activation from subsequent responses
  to ADO via A2A receptors (the pre-exposure effect): A2A receptors still activate
  the CNGC pathway, enabling the Ca2+-dependent component of KATP channel activation
  to act on the phosphorylated channel to cause VSMC relaxation. AC, adenylate cyclase,
  ADO, adenosine; EC, endothelial cell; IEL, internal elastic lamina; CNGC, cyclic
  nucleotide gated channel; PKA, protein kinase A; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell.'
