caption: Unphosphorylated FMRP associates with Dicer (top left). The Dicer containing
  complex then processes pre-miRNAs into mature, double-stranded duplex miRNAs (bottom
  left). After RISC separates the duplex strands, the single-stranded mature miRNA
  binds FMRP’s target mRNA to induce translation. Conversely, when FMRP is phosphorylated,
  Dicer cannot bind and pre-miRNAs are not processed into mature miRNAs (top right).
  Without activating miRNAs, translation of the target mRNA cannot occur and the result
  is indirect suppression of translation by FMRP due to loss of Dicer binding.
