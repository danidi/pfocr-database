caption: Figure 1. Progestin-dependent activation of the senescence pathway. Cancer
  cells have increased capacity to proliferate. Cellular senescence can be triggered
  by various insults. Progesterone promote ovarian cancer cells to enter senescence
  through activation of the progesterone receptor (PR), which cooperates with FOXO1
  to induce expression of senescence-associated cell cycle inhibitors, including FOXO1,
  p15INK4b, p16INK4a, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.
