caption: 'Glucose is metabolized to pyruvate through glycolysis and can be further
  converted to lactate, which is then secreted. This process does not require oxygen
  and the net gain in energy is 2 ATP molecules per molecule glucose. Alternatively,
  pyruvate can be oxidized to Acetyl-CoA and enter the TCA cycle. The NADH and FADH2
  molecules produced in the TCA cycle are then used as electron donors in the electron
  transport chain (oxidative phosphorylation) to generate ATP. If glucose is metabolized
  completely through oxidative phosphorylation, the net energy gain is approximately
  36 ATP molecules per molecule glucose. Carbon atoms from molecules other than glucose
  can also enter the TCA cycle. Fatty acids need to be activated in the cytosol and
  transferred across the mitochondrial membrane before being oxidized in the mitochondria.
  Catabolic pathways are highlighted in green. Anabolic pathways are highlighted in
  red. In blue are shown some of the enzymes catalyzing important steps in cell metabolism.
