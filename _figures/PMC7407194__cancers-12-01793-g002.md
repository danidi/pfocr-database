caption: Mechanisms of DSB repair. (a) Following the recruitment and activation of
  ATM (ATM serine/protein kinase), the nuclease MRN (MRE11 (MRE11 homolog, double
  strand break repair nuclease)/RAD50 (RAD50 double strand break repair protein)/NBN
  (nibrin), along with its cofactor RBBP8 (RB binding protein 8) and other accessory
  proteins, such as BRCA1(BRCA1 DNA repair associated), initiates the 5′-3′ resection
  of the DNA ends, resulting in the creation of 3′-OH ssDNA tails on both ends of
  the break. Next, long range resection is achieved by EXO1 (exonuclease 1), DNA2
  (DNA replication helicase/nuclease 2) and BLM (BLM RecQ like helicase). (b) The
  ssDNA-ends are coated and stabilized by RPA (replication protein A). (c) RPA is
  replaced from ssDNA ends by RAD51 (RAD51 recombinase) in a BRCA2 (BRCA2 DNA repair
  associated)-dependent process and formation of the RAD51 multimeric filament on
  ssDNA occurs. (d) RAD51-ssDNA filament can then strand invade a homologous dsDNA,
  leading to displacement on one strand of the intact DNA duplex and formation of
  a D-loop. (e) Following strand exchange, the resulting Holliday junction is resolved.
  (f) NHEJ (Non-homologous end joining) pathway initiates with the ATM-mediated phosphorylation
  of 53BP1, required for the recruitment of the anti-resection proteins RIF1 (replication
  timing regulatory factor 1) to the DSBs (double strand breaks) and inhibition of
  DNA resection (g). 53BP1 (TP53 (tumor protein p53)-binding protein 1) promotes the
  binding of XRCC5/XRCC6 (X-ray repair cross-complementing protein 6 and 5) heterodimer
  to the two ends of the DSB. (h) DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic
  subunit) acts as a scaffold protein that tethers the broken ends together. (i) The
  LIG4 (DNA ligase 4)/XRCC4 (X-ray repair cross complementing 4)/NHEJ1 (non-homologous
  end joining factor 1) complex ligates the DNA ends. Black arrows (↑) and perpendicular
  lines (⊥) indicate activation and repression, respectively.
