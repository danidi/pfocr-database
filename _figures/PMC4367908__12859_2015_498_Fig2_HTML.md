caption: The network of molecules involved in the control of VPC fate determination
  and the cell cycle in C. elegans . Pointed arrows are positive regulatory interactions,
  and blunt arrows are negative regulatory interactions. Purple arrows are interactions
  reported in other organisms, and green arrows are predictions of our model. Orange
  nodes are part of the Notch pathway, and blue nodes are part of the Ras/MAPK pathway
  or its targets (LIN-39). Green nodes are CDK/Cyclin complexes, yellow nodes are
  CDK inhibitors, EFL-1, a transcription factor in white, and protein degradation
  complexes in gray. The external signals are represented as elongated hexagons, the
  known transcription factors as ellipses, and other proteins as rounded rectangles.
