caption: IscS and TusA connect the sulfur transfer pathway for the synthesis of Moco
  and for tRNA thiolation in E. coli. Formation of the thiocarboxylate group on MoaD
  (upper part). cPMP is converted to MPT by the transfer of two sulfur groups from
  the C-terminal thiocarboxylate of the MoaD. Regeneration of the MoaD thiocarboxylate
  group by MoeB. MoaD receives its sulfur by a persulfide-sulfur relay system consisting
  of IscS and TusA. Formation of cmnm5s2U and mnm5s2U in E. coli (lower part). Sulfur
  relay system from IscS via TusA, TusD (in the TusBCD complex), TusE to MnmA, which
  binds and activates the tRNA by adenylation. After formation, s2U is further modified
  to form cmnm5s2U or mnm5s2U by MnmG, MnmE and MnmC.
