caption: The role of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in the differentiation pathway
  of CD4+regulatory T cells. Following T-cell activation where a sufficient amount
  of IL-2 is produced to overcome the inhibitory effects of TGF-β, the costimulatory
  effects of this cytokine induce the precursors of CD4+ CD25+ T cells to become contact-dependent
  'professional' suppressor cells or induces CD4+ CD25- cells to produce immunosuppressive
  quantities of TGF-β . IFN, interferon; Tr-1, Treg 1 regulatory CD4+ cells.
