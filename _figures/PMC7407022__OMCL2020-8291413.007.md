caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed antisenescence mechanism of GA-D in
  hAMSCs. According to this model, GA-D activating PERK results in intranuclear transfer
  of NRF2, which then upregulates the expression of PRDX3 and inhibits ROS. Additionally,
  the activation of PERK also inhibits ERS by triggering UPR, overall resulting in
  inhibition of senescence.
