caption: 'Network analysis of the up-regulated gene in Ifnar−/− mice reveals a TNF
  to be a crucial regulator for antiviral immune response. The figure depicts a modular
  network formed using the upregulated genes. (A) protein-to-protein interaction (PPI)
  network was developed using the STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting
  Gene) database. The interaction was divided into four groups using the K-means clustering
  tool from the STRING database. Each group defines the essential unique function:
  group 1 includes metabolic pathway genes, group 2 comprises olfactory related gene,
  group 3 represents the protein translation gene, and group 4 contains antiviral
  response-related genes. (B) Later, group 4 genes representing the antiviral response
  were used for the interactome generation by using the STRING database. The network
  shows the maximum connectivity patterns where Jun was found to have the highest
  number of connective nodes, followed by that of TNF-α.'
