caption: 'Schematic presentation of Nag PTS and parts of the central metabolism of
  R. eutropha H16 that are relevant for this study. The reddish gene abbreviations
  (small font, italics) indicate genes being upregulated in mutant G+1 as reported
  by transcriptome experiments. The reddish protein abbreviations (large font) indicate
  proteins being increasingly synthesized in mutant G+1 in comparison to wild-type
  H16, as revealed by proteome analyses. The same applies to the greenish gene/protein
  abbreviations, but these indicate downregulation or reduced synthesis by mutant
  G+1 in comparison to wild-type H16. Bluish letters are common abbreviations of trivial
  names of the respective enzymes. Nag PTS components are as follows: nagC (outer-membrane
  protein (porin), nagE (sugar phosphotransferase system, membrane component EIICB),
  nagF (sugar phosphotransferase system, cytosolic component EIIA-HPr-EI). KDPG pathway
  and subsequent reactions leading to pyruvate are as follows: G6PD/Zwf1 (glucose-6-phosphate
  1-dehydrogenase), 6PGL (6-phosphogluconolactonase), EDD/Edd1 (phosphogluconate dehydratase),
  EDA (2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-phosphate aldolase), G3PD/CbbG1/cbbG1 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase), PGM (phosphoglycerate mutase), ENO (enolase), PK (pyruvate kinase),
  PPS (phosphoenolpyruvate kinase). PDHC (pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex)
  includes pdhA1 (pyruvate dehydrogenase/decarboxylase [E1 of PDHC]), pdhB (dihydrolipoamide
  acetyltransferase [E2 of PDHC]), pdhL (dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase [E3 of PDHC]).
  Involved in TCC and PHB metabolism are cisY (citrate synthase), PhaA (acetyl-CoA
  acetyltransferase), PhaB1 (acetoacetyl-CoA reductase), PhaC (PHB synthase), PhaP1/phaP1
  (phasin 1), phaP3 (phasin 3), PhaP4/phaP4 (phasin 4). NAD(P)-transhydrogenases include
  PntAa3,2,1/pntAa2,3 [NAD(P) transhydrogenase subunits alpha 1 of gene regions 1
  to 3], pntAb1,2,3 [NAD(P) transhydrogenase subunits alpha 2 of gene regions 1 to
  3], and pntB3 [NAD(P) transhydrogenase subunit beta of gene region 3].'
