caption: ET-1 is synthesized in human endothelial cells by a dual secretory pathway.
  ET-1 is continuously released from the small vesicles of the constitutive pathway
  to interact with ET receptors to contribute to vasomotor tone. ET-1 is also released
  from the regulated pathway in response to external stimuli from Weibel-Palade bodies
  that are unique to endothelial cells. In the human vasculature, ET-1 released abluminally
  from endothelial cells, interacts mainly with ETA receptors on the underlying smooth
  muscle, with a small population of ETB receptors also mediating constriction in
  some but not all vessels. In animals, vasoconstriction can be via ETB or a mixture
  of both depending on the vascular bed. The ET-1/ETA complex undergoes internalization
  to the endosome before recycling of the receptor to the cell surface and provides
  a mechanism whereby ETA antagonist can reverse an ET-1 response. Some ET-1 may also
  interact with endothelial ETB receptors in an autocrine manner and limit the constrictor
  response by the release of vasodilators such as nitric oxide. ET-1/ETB complex is
  internalized and degraded to the lysosome; as a result ETB antagonists are unable
  to displace receptor bound ligand. Low levels of ET-1 and Big ET-1 that has escaped
  conversion can also be detected in the plasma. Big ET-1 can also undergo further
  conversion by smooth muscle ECE to the mature peptide.
