caption: —Signatures of positive selection in the primate type 2 immune response pathway.
  (A) Overview of the type 2 immune response pathway in humans. Recognition of allergens
  by antigen presenting cells (APCs) leads to activation of naïve Th0 cells into mature
  Th2 cells. Secreted cytokines IL-13, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-10 contribute to activation
  of B-cells, granulocytes and remodeling of the lung epithelia. Together these responses
  contribute to allergic inflammation characteristic of asthma in conducting airways.
  The IgE receptor, FcεRI, is comprised of FCER1A, MS4A2, and FCER1G. Genes exhibiting
  signatures of positive selection are shown in red. (B) Summary of screen for evidence
  of positive selection among allergic immune response factors. Nine primate orthologs
  for each gene representing hominoid, Old World, and New World monkeys were analyzed
  using codeml from the PAML software package. P values and 2d statistics are shown
  for model comparisons of M7 versus M8. Genes with statistical support (P < 0.01)
  for positive selection are highlighted in red. *ECP is only present in hominoid
  and Old World monkey genomes, preventing the inclusion of New World monkeys for
  phylogenetic analyses.
