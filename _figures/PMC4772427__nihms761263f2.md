caption: 'Three mechanisms and related signaling that underlie Tat-mediated increases
  in Ca2+ influx/[Ca2+]in and hyper-excitation of mPFC pyramidal neurons. Tat, which
  is secreted by HIV-infected leukocyte, microglia and astrocytes in the brain, binds
  to (1) the ligand-gated NMDAR, (2) voltage-gated L-channel, and (3) GPCR-associated
  TRPC channel in mPFC pyramidal neurons. The NMDAR and L-channels are highly or selectively
  permeable for Ca2+, while the TRPC channel is a non-selective cation channel that
  is also permeable for Ca2+. Activity of TRPC channels is mediated by the GPCR/Gi,q/PLC/IP3pathway
  and intracellular Ca2+ release. Tat abnormally increases Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release
  in neurons by acting on the NMDAR, L-channel, and GPCR associated with TRPC channel.
  Enhanced phosphorylation of NMDAR and the L-channel also increases the Ca2+-conducting
  activity of the channels. Excessive cytosolic free Ca2+ is toxic; and enduring exposure
  to Tat (and other HIV-1 proteins and immunoinflammatory molecules) in vivo induces
  overload of Ca2+ that could disturb mitochondrial activity and other neuronal function,
  causing oxidative stress, dysregulation, over-excitation-associated injury, and
  death of neurons. Increased [Ca2+]in may also increase GSK-3β activity and reduce
  β-catenin activity, rendering the neuron more vulnerable to excitotoxicity. In response

  to the dorsal/ventral striatum, which also receives local GABA inputs from the NAc
  and CPu. Integrated dysregulation and neurotoxicity mediated by HIV-1 proteins (and
  immunoinflammatory molecules) alter the structure and function of the mPFC, and
  that may ultimately contribute to HIV-associated neuropathogenesis. Blocking or
