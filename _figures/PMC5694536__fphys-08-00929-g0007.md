caption: Schematic diagram depicting the role of Hoxa2 in proliferation and osteogenic
  differentiation of the palatal mesenchyme. (A) Hoxa2 inhibits canonical BMP signaling
  in the developing palate, which in turn restricts the expression domain of osteogenic
  markers such as Runx2, AlpI, and Sp7. (B) In wild-type, Hoxa2 expression peaks during
  early palatogenesis to control cell proliferation and to maintain mesenchymal cells
  in an undifferentiated stage by regulating BMP signaling pathway. (C) Loss of Hoxa2
  leads to upregulation of BMP signaling resulting in increased osteoprogenitor cell
  proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, possibly accounting for the failure
  in the elevation of palatal shelves resulting in manifestation of cleft palate.
