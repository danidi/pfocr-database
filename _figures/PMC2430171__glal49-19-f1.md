caption: SFKs directly interact with BCR-ABL resulting in (1) activation of SFKs [,,]
  and (2) augmentation of BCR-ABL kinase activity []. Activated SFKs work cooperatively
  with BCR-ABL in facilitating the growth and progression of leukemia [,,]. Several
  downstream effectors of SFKs have been proposed to mediate the proleukemic effects,
  such as (3) STAT5 [], which is known to activate genes involved in growth factor
  independence, differentiation, adhesion, and DNA repair [,–] and (4) AKT [], which
  is key in regulating cell proliferation and survival in BCR-ABL-dependent cells
  []. (5) Active SFKs also phosphorylate certain tyrosine residues on BCR-ABL to create
  a binding site for GRB-2. This adaptor protein may link the BCR-ABL pathway to Ras,
  which is known to activate the MEK/ERK oncogenic signaling cascade [,].
