caption: 'RDGN regulates TGF-β signaling transduction in tumor cells.Notes: TGF-β
  binds to TβR and activates SARA, which then recruits and activates intracellular
  SMAD2/3 protein. SMAD2/3 forms a heterodimer and enters into the nucleus with the
  assistance of SMAD4 protein. SMAD2/3/4 complex works as a transcription factor regulating
  the expression of targeted genes, which are associated with proliferation, CSCs’
  expansion, EMT, and apoptosis of various cancers. SIX/EYA compound acts as an activator
  of above process, while DACH1 is an inhibitor of TGF-β signaling.Abbreviations:
  CSCs, cancer stem cells; EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal transition; RDGN, retinal determination
  gene network; SARA, SMAD anchor for receptor activation; TβR, TGF-β receptor.'
