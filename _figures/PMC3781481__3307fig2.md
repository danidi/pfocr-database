caption: Classic and alternative lipogenic pathways of fructose. In the classical
  pathway, triglycerides (TG) are a direct product of fructose metabolism by the action
  of multiple enzymes including aldolase B (Aldo B) and fatty acid synthase (FAS).
  An alternative mechanism was recently shown (). Uric acid produced from the nucleotide
  turnover that occurs during the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate
  (F-1-P) results in the generation of mitochondrial oxidative stress (mtROS), which
  causes a decrease in the activity of aconitase (ACO2) in the Krebs cycle. As a consequence,
  the ACO2 substrate, citrate, accumulates and is released to the cytosol where it
  acts as substrate for TG synthesis through the activation of ATP citrate lyase (ACL)
  and fatty acid synthase. AMPD2, AMP deaminase 2; IMP, inosine monophosphate; PO4,
  phosphate.
