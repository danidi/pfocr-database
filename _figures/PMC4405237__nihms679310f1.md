caption: Importin β, importin α and an NLS-cargo assembly in the cytoplasm travel
  through the nuclear pore. The disassembly of the import complex is started by the
  binding of RanGTP to importin β, which causes release of the IBB domain. Disassembly
  of the NLS-cargo from importin α is a concerted effort of the IBB domain, the nucleoporin
  Nup50 and the importin α-recycling factor CAS. The empty importins are recycled
  back to the cytoplasm, where they are released to restart the import cycle via hydrolysis
  of RanGTP.
