caption: Model for oocyte death regulated by p53 family members. All three p53 family
  members are involved in the apoptotic pathway in primordial follicle oocytes, with
  TAp63 playing a central role. DNA damage by γ-radiation activates signaling pathways
  through TAp63, resulting in the induction of Puma and Noxa and subsequent binding
  of PUMA and NOXA proteins to BAX/BAK as described in the recent report by Kerr et
  al. (red lines). DNA damage by cisplatin also activates TAp63, which results in
  upregulation of c-Abl. The kinase activity of c-Abl (green), which can be inhibited
  by imatinib, induces TAp63-dependent expression of TAp73 and subsequent degradation
  of TAp63. c-Abl may also activate TAp73 via phosphorylation; phospho-TAp73 then
  activates the apoptosis signaling pathway. p53 may have a minor or non-essential
  role in the activation of the apoptosis signaling pathway in response to cisplatin
  (shown as dotted line). The sequence of this signaling pathway and the consequences
  on primordial oocyte survival is profound and provides new insights into targets
  that may mitigate fertility loss in the cancer setting
