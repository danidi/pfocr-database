caption: 'The scheme shows the toxin biosynthesis pathway as well as significantly
  altered genes and biological processes within a cell cycle. The revised toxin biosynthesis
  pathway is shown in the blue dotted line box (cited and modified from previous reports
  [,,]). All of the identified sxt genes are labeled with solid circles: the blue
  circles show the sxt genes with significant variations of expression within the
  cell cycle; the grey circles represent the sxt genes without exact functions in
  toxin biosynthesis of dinoflagellates. The alterations of genes and pathways indicated
  a translational or post-translational regulation of toxin biosynthesis in A. catenella.
  The abbreviations are: SAM: S-adenosyl-methionine; SAH: S-adenosyl-homocysteine;
  FAB: fatty acid biosynthesis.'
