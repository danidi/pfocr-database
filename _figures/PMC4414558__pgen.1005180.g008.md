caption: During tissue damage or pathogen infection induced midgut regeneration, the
  JAK/STAT pathway is highly activated (A). In response to extracellular signaling,
  STAT92E dimers translocate into the nucleus, bind to its consensus binding sites
  at the genomic region of wdp and then promote its transcription. Newly synthesized
  Wdp protein is transported to the cell membrane, where it interacts with Dome and
  promotes Dome internalization from the cell membrane finally into the lysosomes
  for subsequent degradation (B). Through this negative feedback manner, Wdp restricts
  the signal duration and ensures JAK/STAT signaling returns to the normal levels
  after injury in Drosophila intestines.
