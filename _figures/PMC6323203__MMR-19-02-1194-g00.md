caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis of differentially
  expressed proteins. The differential expression of C1q is more obvious in patients
  NSAA compared with normal controls. Red stars represent differentially expressed
  proteins. C1q, complement component 1q; NSAA, non-severe aplastic anemia.
