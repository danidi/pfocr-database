caption: Changes in caveolae – G α q interactions with stimulation. In the resting
  state, the receptor (R) - G α qG βγ heterotrimer – PLC β complex resides in caveolae
  (Cav) domains. Upon stimulation, the receptors move into early endosomes (EE) and
  strong interactions between G α q and G βγ are diminished. This loss in affinity
  between the G protein subunits allows activated G α q to strongly interact with
  caveolin-1 stabilizing both its localization and its activated state. Since G βγ
  does not interact with caveolin proteins, the loss of G α q and receptor interactions
  destabilizes its caveolae localization resulting in its release from caveolae.
