caption: Schematic of IFN signaling by the Jak-Stat pathway. The signaling process
  is initiated by binding of the IFN ligand to its cognate receptor subunits. IFN-α
  and IFN-β are depicted by the diamond, and IFN-γ is depicted by the sphere. IFN
  binding leads to activation of overlapping pairs of Jak and Stat transcription factors
  by tyrosine phosphorylation. The Jak-1 and Tyk-2 kinases are activated by IFN-α/β,
  which leads to the phosphorylation and dimerization of the Stat-1 (p91) and Stat-2
  (p113) proteins and subsequent translocation, along with IRF-9 (p48), to the nucleus.
  The complex of these three proteins, known as IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3),
  activates the transcription of IFN-α/β–inducible genes through the ISRE. The Jak-1
  and Jak-2 kinases are activated by IFN-γ, which leads to the phosphorylation and
  homodimerization of the Stat-1 protein and subsequent translocation to the nucleus.
  The Stat-1 dimer complex, known as GAF for gamma activation factor, activates the
  transcription of IFN-γ inducible genes through the GAS enhancer element.
