caption: Molecular pathways involved in senescence. Persistent DNA damage response
  (DDR) activates the ATM/p53/p21 pathway to stop the cell cycle, while preventing
  lysosomal acidification that inhibits autophagy, and activating NF-κB that induces
  senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). mTOR and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) can induce senescence by DDR-independent mechanisms through the p38MAPK/NF-κB/SASP
  pathway. mTOR can also inhibit autophagy by a NF-κB-independent mechanism to induce
  senescence. Altogether, cell cycle arrest, reduced autophagy, and secretion of SASP
  components mediate vascular dysfunction and accelerated aging.
