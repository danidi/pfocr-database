caption: Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 is expressed in proliferating cells, where it
  can exist both as a high-activity tetramer and a low-activity dimer. During glycolysis,
  PKM2 catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from phosphoenol pyruvate to ADP, generating
  ATP and pyruvate. At times of high glucose availability, acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) increases,
  leading to P300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF)-mediated PKM2 acetylation at Lys305.
  Acetylated PKM2 is then selectively degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA).
  The reduction in PKM2 levels allows more glycolytic intermediates to be used for
  biosynthesis, while phosphoenol pyruvate continues to be converted to pyruvate by
  low levels of PKM2 activity and by an alternative, non-ATP generating pathway.
