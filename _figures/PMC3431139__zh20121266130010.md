caption: Scheme illustrates the role of serine/threonine phosphatase 1 (PP1) binding
  to WNK4 at aa 695–699 in mediating the effect of c-Src on the SGK1-WNK4 interaction.
  A solid line and dotted line represent an enhanced and a diminished effect, respectively.
  The gray fonts mean that the particular signaling pathway is inactivated.
