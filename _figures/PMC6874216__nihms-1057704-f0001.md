caption: The biosynthetic pathway of ubiquinone (Q) in E. coli (Ubi) and S. cerevisiae
  (Coq), as well as the proposed pathway to RQ biosynthesis in organisms with an RquA
  homolog. In E. coli, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HB) is prenylated by UbiA to form 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate
  (OHB) which undergoes decarboxylation by UbiD and UbiX. Hydroxylation of the resulting
  product, 3-octaprenylphenol (OPP), is catalyzed by UbiI to form 3-octaprenyl catechol
  (compound 1). The first O-methylation is catalyzed by UbiG to convert compound 1
  to 2-octaprenyl-6-methoxyphenol (compound 2). Hydroxylation of compound 2 with UbiH
  yields demethyldemethoxyubiquinol (DDMQH2). The Q pathway in yeast can start from
  4HB or para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), and after multiple steps, catalyzed by Coq1,
  Coq2, Yah1, Arh1, Coq3 and other Coq polypeptides, results in the common intermediate,
  DDMQH2. The C-methylation of DDMQH2 with UbiE or Coq5 then produces demethoxyubiquinol
  (DMQH2). A final hydroxylation of DMQH2 by UbiF or Coq7 yields demethylubiquinol
  (DMeQH2), which can then be methylated again by UbiG or Coq3 to produce ubiquinol
  (QH2), the reduced form of Q. The R. rubrum protein, RquA, is proposed to convert
  Q to RQ. The number of isoprene units in the tail (R) is represented by the letter
  “n” and varies between species (e.g. in yeast n = 6, in E. coli n = 8, and in R.
  rubrum n = 10).
