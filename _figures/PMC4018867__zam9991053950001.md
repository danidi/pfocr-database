caption: Proposed pathway and genes for MMA utilization as the source of carbon, energy,
  and nitrogen on the basis of observed mutant phenotypes of M. extorquens DM4. MMA
  oxidation by the NMG pathway involves GMAS (EC 1.6.5.3, encoded by gmaS), NMG synthase
  (EC 2.4.2.2, encoded by mgsABC), and NMG dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.99.5, encoded by
  mgdABCD). α-Ketoglutarate and tetrahydrofolate are abbreviated as αKG and THF, respectively.
  In M. extorquens DM4, GMAS is required for growth with MMA as the carbon source.
  In the absence of gmaS, direct oxidative deamination of glutamate by NMG synthase
  (hydrolase) may yield sufficient ammonium for growth (broken lines). NMG dehydrogenase
  catalyzes the transformation of NMG to methylene  tetrahydrofolate, which subsequently
  enters the serine cycle for carbon assimilation into biomass or is oxidized into
  CO2 for energy production via enzymes encoded by mdtA, fch, ftfL, and fdh (). MMA
  utilization as a sole carbon and nitrogen source was shown to require the presence
  of both mgs and mgd (see the text).
