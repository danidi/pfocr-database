caption: Detailed diagram representing all elementary reactions. The used graphical
  convention is described Material and Methods. Activator or repressor ARFs can be
  represented using respectively high or low values for both the transcription rates
  h A and h AA. The symbol ∅ represents the empty set, introduced as usual to model
  degradation and constitutive expression of genes.
