caption: Overview of photosynthetic electron transport pathways in the chloroplast.
  Linear electron flow requires photosystems (PS) I and II working in series, leading
  to electron transfer from water to NADP+ to generate NADPH as reducing power. This
  involves electron transfer from PS II to PS I via plastoquinone (PQ), the cytochrome
  b6f complex (Cyt b6f), and plastocyanin (PC) as redox carriers. At the stromal side
  of PS I, electrons are subsequently donated to ferredoxin (Fdx), which functions
  as a mobile electron carrier distributing electrons to NADP+via Fdx-NADP-reductase
  (FNR) to produce NADPH or directly to specific processes located in the stroma,
  such as S and N assimilation, biosynthetic pathways, and reactions involved in chloroplast
  redox regulation, catalyzed by Fdx-Trx-reductase (FTR) and thioredoxins (Trxs).
  NADPH produced by FNR is used by the carbon fixation cycle and various biosynthetic
  processes as a reductant and by NADPH-dependent Trx-reductase C (NTRC) for redox
  regulation. In the thyllakoid membrane, proton-gradient-regulation-like protein
  1 (PGRL1) acts as an Fdx-PQ reductase in cyclic electron flow, reintroducing electrons
  from Fdx into the electron transport chain, as indicated by the dotted line ().
  A second pathway for cyclic electron flow around PS I involving a NADH oxidase-like
  complex is not shown for clarity. Under conditions of acceptor limitation of PS
  I, electrons from PS I will photoreduce oxygen to reactive oxygen species (ROS).
