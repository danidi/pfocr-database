caption: Potential mechanism of Fusobacterium-associated CRC. Mutant epithelial cells
  cause local intestinal barrier impairment, which gives Fusobacterium the opportunity
  for adherence and subsequent invasion into epithelial cells. Once FadA, a membrane
  protein of Fusobacterium, combines with E-cadherin and is internalized by epithelial
  cells, the β-catenin signaling pathway is activated. Phosphorylated β-catenin would
  enter the cell nucleus from cytoplasm and promote NF-κB genes, pro-inflammatory
  genes and the expression of many other oncogenes. Moreover, the microenvironment
  of malignancies is anoxic and acidic, which would be more suitable for Fusobacterium
  reproduction compared to other bacteria. The metabolites of aggregated Fusobacterium.
  Then recruit MDSCs, in turn suppressing anti-tumor immunity and promote CRC carcinogenesis.
