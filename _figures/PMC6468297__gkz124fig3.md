caption: MDM2’s switch from a negative to a positive regulator of p53 following DNA
  damage is dependent on the p53 mRNA. (A) Under normal conditions, MDM2 (in red)
  binds and catalyzes the ubiquitination of p53, targeting it for degradation via
  the 26S proteasomal pathway (of note, p53 degradation can also take place in the
  nucleus ()). (B) Following DNA damage, ATM phosphorylates MDM2 at Ser395 (in green)
  that allows MDM2 to interact with the p53 mRNA. This promotes the interaction with
  the 5S RNP complex and an increase in p53 synthesis. The p53 mRNA–MDM2 is required
  to bring ATM to the p53 polysome where it phosphorylates the nascent p53 protein
  to prevent MDM2-mediated degradation of the newly synthesized p53. A single synonymous
  mutation in the p53 mRNA at codon 22 prevents MDM2 from binding the p53 mRNA and
  prevents the stabilization of p53 following genotoxic stress.
