caption: 'Induction of interferon (IFN) and its antagonism by viral proteins. The
  nucleotidyltransferase cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) detects viral DNAs
  while the RNA helicases retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5) detect viral RNAs. These recognized pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMP) initiate a signaling cascade that results in the activation of transcription
  factors to promote the induction of IFN-α/β. Binding of viral double-stranded (ds)
  DNA to cGAS stimulates the synthesis of cGAMP, which binds directly to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER)-located stimulator of IFN genes (STING). Upon activation, STING stimulates
  TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) activity to phosphorylate IFN regulatory factor (IRF)3.
  Binding of viral single-stranded (ss)- and dsRNA stimulates ATPase activity in RIG-I-like
  receptors (RLRs – RIG-I, MDA5) and triggers major conformational changes, allowing
  their homodimerization. Upon homodimerization, RIG-I and MDA5 interact with the
  downstream adaptor protein mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), which
  leads eventually to the activation of IRF3 via IκB kinase ε (IKKε) and TBK1. The
  activation of IRF3 due to viral DNAs and RNAs, together with IRF7 and nuclear factor
  κB (NF-κB), is required for transcriptional induction of the IFN-β promoter. Viral
