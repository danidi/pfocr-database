caption: Metabolic pathways of Lactobacillus fermentum 222 and Lactobacillus plantarum
  80. The names of the genes that were present in both genomes are depicted in blue,
  those that were present in L. fermentum 222 only are depicted in yellow, and those
  that were present in L. plantarum 80 only are depicted in grey. Metabolites involved
  in the homo- and heterolactic fermentation pathways are depicted in green, those
  involved in pyruvate metabolism are depicted in purple, those involved in citrate
  metabolism are depicted in black, those involved in the proteolytic system and amino
  acid conversion pathways are depicted in orange, those involved in the arginine
  deiminase pathway are depicted in red, and those involved in the respiratory machinery
  are depicted in dark red. Enzymes and locus tags that were associated with the gene
  names are listed in Additional file . DHAP Dihydroxyacetone phosphate, PEP Phosphoenolpyruvate,
  BCAA, Branched-chain amino acid, ArAA Aromatic amino acid, GABA γ-aminobutyric acid,
  TPP Thiamine pyrophosphate
