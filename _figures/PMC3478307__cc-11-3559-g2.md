caption: Figure 2. BCAP links TLRs to PI3K. TLR ligation initiates a signaling cascade
  leading to activation of NFκB. Activation of NFκB by TLRs is mediated through recruitment
  of signaling adaptors, including MyD88. The MyD88-dependent pathway, which is utilized
  by all TLRs except TLR3, mediates assembly of a ternary complex of IRAK proteins.
  This complex then engages and activates TRAF6, which ultimately leads to activation
  of NFκB. In addition to activation of NFκB, MyD88-dependent TLR signaling also leads
  to activation of PI3K. Activation of PI3K by TLRs critically requires the TIR-domain
  containing TLR adaptor BCAP. Upon stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylated BCAP recruits
  the PI3K complex. Activated PI3K then phosphorylates its lipid substrate PtdIns(4,5)P2.
  Increased concentrations of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 leads to activation of the serine/threonine
  kinase Akt by PDPK1. Activation of the PI3K signaling axis represents a major branch
  of TLR mediated signaling and contributes to a variety of cellular outcomes, including
  regulation of the inflammatory response, cell proliferation and cell survival.
