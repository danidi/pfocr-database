caption: Bat cells mount an antiviral response to RNA viruses, but limit the expression
  of inflammatory cytokines. Infection with RNA viruses, such as Sendai virus, or
  transfecting cells with surrogate double-stranded RNA [poly(I:C)] or single-stranded
  RNA is detected by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7 and 8 or cytosolic receptors
  retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein
  5 (MDA5). Activation of these receptors activate downstream adaptor proteins, such
  as mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS). Adaptor proteins activate cellular
  kinases, such as TANK-binding kinase 1 protein (TBK1), which in-turn activate interferon
  regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) or IRF7 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NFκB) to stimulate the expression of interferons (IFNs), such
  as IFNs α, β, ω, κ, and λ, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL8, TNFα, and
  IL1β, respectively. IFNs bind to interferon α/β receptors (IFNAR; IFNAR1 and IFNAR2)
  on infected and neighboring cells to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway via
  kinases such as Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) that phosphorylate
  signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Phosphorylated
  STAT proteins (STAT1 and STAT2) merge with IRF9 and induce the expression of interferon
  stimulated genes (ISGs), such as OAS1 and Mx1. However, unlike in human cells, the
  parallel activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines is dampened in bat cells. c-Rel,
  a protein from the NFκB family of proteins binds to the TNFα promoter to inhibit
  activation of this pro-inflammatory cytokine in E. fuscus cells (). The bat NLRP3
  inflammasome activation is dampened, reducing the ability of bat cells to produce
  IL1β, a key inflammatory cytokine (). In the figure, red arrows indicate a dampened
  response in the pathway, relative to human cells. Question marks (?) highlight pathways
  and molecular homologs that have not been characterized or identified in bats. The
  data have been compiled from studies in different species and one finding may not
  represent a universal bat response. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
