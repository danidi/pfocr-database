caption: Outlines of the pathways studied. (a) Methionine (MET); (b) nitrogen catabolite
  repression (NCR); (c) pseudohypal growth/mating (HYPE); (d) regulation of early
  meiotic genes (CCYCLE); (e) pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR). The sub-networks
  enlarged from Figure 2, with the identified motifs within the pathway drawn from
  the interaction databases, are shown on the left (colors and conventions are the
  same as in Figure 2). A schematic representation of the regulation mechanisms for
  the same pathways, based on the present experimental knowledge as discussed in the
  text, is shown on the right. Full lines represent transcriptional regulation, dashed
  lines non-transcriptional regulation, and wavy lines transformations and syntheses.
  Arrowheads, positive regulation; lines ending in a terminal bar, negative regulation.
