caption: 'The actomyosin ATPase cycle and structural features of the myosin motor
  domain. (a) The Lymn–Taylor four-state model and the predominant equilibrium states
  of the actomyosin cycle. Rigor state: strongly actin-bound state (lever arm in “down”
  position). Post-rigor state: actin-detached state with bound ATP (actin-binding
  cleft “open”). Pre-power-stroke state—weakly actin-bound state; conformational state
  after the recovery step with hydrolyzed ATP; lever arm in “up” position. Start-of-power-stroke
  state: myosin re-associates with actin (binding triggers product release and initiates
  the power stroke). (b) Kinetic scheme of the actomyosin ATPase reaction. Colored
  states illustrate nucleotide-associated conformational transitions of myosin. A:
  actin; M: myosin; M*, M**: fluorescence sensitive states of myosin; T: ATP; D: ADP;
  Pi: phosphate. Strong nucleotide and actomyosin interactions are indicated with
  a dot, weak interactions with a hyphen. Equilibrium constants and rate constants
  depending on actin are given with a prime in bold italic (e.g., K’1, k’+1), all
  others in italic font style (e.g., K’1, k’+1). Equilibrium constants indexed with
  T, D, P, and A represent the affinity of the respective nucleotide state of myosin
  for actin (e.g., K’DPA). (c) Structural elements and domains in the myosin-2 motor
  involved in coupling actin binding to force generation. X-ray crystal structure
  of the D. discoideum myosin-2 motor domain (PDB: 1g8x) highlighting the W-loop in
  red as connecting element of the W-helix (green) and the transducer (cyan) and close-up
  view of the W-helix/transducer region showing amino acids T647 and T648 in the W-loop
  interacting with surrounding residues (inset). The W-helix interacts with β-sheets
  strands 3 to 7 (cyan), the relay helix (orange), the helix-loop-helix motif (blue)
  and the two connector sequences, the strut (yellow) and loop 2 (magenta). Multiple
  sequence alignment of the W-helix/transducer region for different myosin isoforms
  highlights the conservation of the W-loop throughout myosin classes.'
