caption: Schematic representation of the suggested pathway by which CAFs induce cell
  proliferation, EMT and metastasis in CRC cell. CAF-CM induces the upregulation of
  UCA1 in sw480 cells and leading to upregulation of mTOR. UCA1 in cooperation with
  mTOR regulates downstream key effectors and induces Cyclin-D1 and suppresses p27
  and miR-143, subsequently, directs the cell proliferation, EMT and metastasis of
  CRC cell
