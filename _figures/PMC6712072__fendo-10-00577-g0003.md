caption: Ceramide biosynthesis pathways and their subcellular localization. Ceramide
  is synthesized by three pathways; the de novo pathway; the sphingomyelin pathway;
  and the salvage/recycling pathway. The de novo synthesis pathway (endoplasmic reticulum),
  begins by the condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA by serine palmitoyltransferase
  into dihydrosphingosine. Next, dihydrosphingosine is converted into ceramide. In
  the salvage pathway, sphingosine is metabolized into ceramide by ceramide synthase,
  and glucosylceramide is degraded into ceramide by glucosylceramidase. The recycling
  pathway is accountable for the cycling among ceramide and complex sphingolipids.
  In the sphingomyelin hydrolysis pathway, plasma membrane sphingomyelin is hydrolyzed
  into ceramide by sphingomyelinase. Inhibitors of ceramides metabolism are shown
  in red. Cytopl, cytoplasm; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; lys, lysosome; PM, plasma

  description: Ceramide biosynthesis pathways and their subcellular localization.
    Ceramide is synthesized by three pathways; the de novo pathway; the sphingomyelin
    pathway; and the salvage/recycling pathway. The de novo synthesis pathway (endoplasmic
    reticulum), begins by the condensation of serine with palmitoyl-CoA by serine
    palmitoyltransferase into dihydrosphingosine. Next, dihydrosphingosine is converted
    into ceramide. In the salvage pathway, sphingosine is metabolized into ceramide
    by ceramide synthase, and glucosylceramide is degraded into ceramide by glucosylceramidase.
    The recycling pathway is accountable for the cycling among ceramide and complex
    sphingolipids. In the sphingomyelin hydrolysis pathway, plasma membrane sphingomyelin
    is hydrolyzed into ceramide by sphingomyelinase. Inhibitors of ceramides metabolism
