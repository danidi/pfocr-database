caption: Negative feedback loops in the SHH signaling pathway driven by SHH-binding
  proteins. The membrane proteins Gas1, Cdo, and Boc promote the activation of Smo
  and are transcriptionally inhibited by SHH signaling. Conversely, Ptc1 and Hhip1
  are transcriptionally induced by Gli activation and inhibit the transduction of
  a SHH signal to Smo.
