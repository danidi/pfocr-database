caption: The relationship between transmembrane topology and protein processing in
  the differential accumulation of NRG isoforms on the cell body versus axons of central
  neurons. This model is largely based on data obtained in cultured hippocampal neurons
  expressing low to moderate NRG levels; more widespread distribution is possible
  in neurons expressing higher levels. A, Single-pass NRGs accumulate at SSC-type
  ER-PM contact sites on cell bodies and proximal dendrites and act as local paracrine
  or autocrine signals upon ectodomain shedding. By contrast, processed dual-pass
  NRGs accumulate on axons and axon terminals where they act as distal signals to
  modulate synaptic function or to regulate neuron–glia interactions via juxtacrine
  interactions with ErbB receptors. Importantly, local and distal NRG signaling might
  occur simultaneously in neurons coexpressing both single- and dual-pass NRGs. B,
  Single-pass NRGs are trafficked through the secretory pathway as unprocessed proforms
  and accumulate at SSC-type ER-PM contact sites. Ectodomain shedding in response
  to glutamate signaling via NMDA receptors occurs at the neuronal cell surface and
  is mediated by GM6001-sensitive metalloproteinases, likely ADAM10 or ADAM17/TACE
  (; ; ). Interactions between the Ig-like domain and the extracellular matrix limit
  the spread of the ectodomain and thereby promote locally restricted signaling. By
  contrast, processing of dual-pass NRGs by BACE, likely in the trans-Golgi network
  (E) or in Golgi-associated vesicles, generates an amino-terminal fragment that accumulates
  on axons via juxtracrine ErbB interactions. Furthermore, both single- and dual-pass
  NRGs give rise to intracellular carboxyl-terminal proteolytic fragments that result
  from additional processing by γ-secretase. For CRD-NRG1, back signaling by this
  fragment has been reported to acutely regulate TRPV and α7-containing nAChRs in
  axons (; ) as well as gene expression in the nucleus (, ).
