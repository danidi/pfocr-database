caption: Engagement between the gut immune system and a probiotic (exemplified by
  Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum 35624) leads to a regulatory T-cell response.
  1. Rather than initiating an inflammatory response via the nuclear factor-kappa
  B (NF-κB) pathway, B. longum subsp. longum 35624 engages with dendritic cells (DCs)
  through toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 6. 2. This does not lead to the release
  of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-12 which would typify engagement
  with a pathogen. 3. Instead, engagement with B. longum subsp. infantis 35624 leads
  to the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β and the stimulation
  of regulatory T-cells. 4. Engagement of B. longum subsp. infantis 35624 via TLR-9
  also stimulates IL-10 secretion and regulatory T-cell proliferation. CCL-20, chemokine
  (C-C motif) ligand 20; CLR, C-type lectin receptors; DC-SIGN, dendritic cell-specific
  intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin; MDC, myeloid-derived dendritic
  cells; PDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Modified from Konieczna et al with permission.
