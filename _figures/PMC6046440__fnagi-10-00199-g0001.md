caption: Calcineurin (CN)/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATs) signaling in
  astrocytes and bidirectional interactions with cytokines. Cytokines and other inflammatory
  factors lead to Ca2+ elevations in astrocytes. Ca2+ binds to calmodulin (CaM), which
  in turn, binds to and activates CN. CN dephosphorylates NFAT transcription factors,
  leading to nuclear translocation and induction of cytokine genes. CN activity can
  be inhibited using the commercially available immunosuppressants, tacrolimus and
  cyclosporine. Physical interactions between CN and NFATs can be blocked using peptide
  based reagents like VIVIT. Many cytokines that are induced by the CN/NFAT pathway
  can stimulate astrocytes in an autocrine or paracrine manner, triggering elevations
  in intracellular Ca2+, which can lead to further CN activation. Severe Ca2+ dysregulation
  can convert CN into a constitutively active proteolytic fragment (ΔCN) via calpain
  dependent proteolysis. Hyperactivation of CN/NFAT maintains chronic neuroinflammation
  (and astrocyte activation) through continued induction (i.e., a positive feedback
  loop) of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes.
