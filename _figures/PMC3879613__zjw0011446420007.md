caption: Biological functions regulated by miR-378 and miR-378*. A, MiR-378* and miR-378
  are produced from a mirtron located in the first intron of the PGC-1β gene. B, MiR-378*
  targets are shown in blue and miR-378 targets in red. Targets of both miRs are shown
  in a shade of blue and red. Mir-378* represses cytoskeleton proteins that are involved
  in a cross-talk with OXPHOS energetic pathway. MiR-378 represses LDHA. This enzyme,
  involved in the last step of glycolysis, is required for cell proliferation. Both
  miRs repress ER proteins involved in glycosylation, Ca2+ buffering and chaperone
  activity. These pathways play a major role in the unfolded protein response (UPR).
  GRP78 is more repressed by miR-378 than by miR-378* and vice versa for PPIA. Glucose
  deprivation is known to induce GRP78 and alter glycosylation.
