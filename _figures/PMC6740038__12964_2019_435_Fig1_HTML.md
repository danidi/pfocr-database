caption: The dual roles of Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer. In normal
  cells, Nrf2 is temporarily activated when exposed to electrophiles and ROS and activates
  the transcription of genes that increase the capabilities of detoxification, antioxidant,
  and immune surveillance, preventing chemical-induced carcinogenesis. In Nrf2-addicted
  cancer cells, Keap1 is deleted or expressed at a very low level. Nrf2 is overexpressed
  and constitutively activated and promotes cancer growth and metastasis by regulating
  its downstream target genes
