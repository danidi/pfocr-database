caption: After N. bombycis oral infection, the invasive spores affected the expression
  of genes involved in the JH biosynthesis and metabolism pathway and may perturb
  the silkworm hormonal balance. In addition, the basal metabolisms of host cells
  were disturbed and spores execute the life cycle at intra-cellular. To combat proliferous
  microsporidia, the silkworm activated Toll and JAK/STAT signaling pathway and secreted
  the antimicrobial peptides. The serine protease cascade melanization pathway was
  also induced, but the secreted serpins of the invasive N. bombycis may participate
  in inhibiting the activity of silkworm serine proteases and then disturb the conversion
  of PPO to active PO. Meanwhile, the cells could also release the cellular immune
  effectors, such as lysozymes, IRPs and immunoglobulins to manage the microsporidia.
