caption: ATM-mediated DNA DSB repair pathway. DNA damage is sensed by the MRN complex
  (sensor of DSBs, consisting of MRE11, RAD50 and NBS1) and 53BP1 (sensor of changes
  in chromatin structure) which consequently activate ATM (red arrows). MDC1 binds
  to γH2AX via BRCA1 and is involved in the retention of the MRN complex to chromatin
  and accumulation of ATM, as well as mediation of the interaction between ATM and
  γH2AX. ATM phosphorylates γH2AX and activates downstream pathways leading to cell
  cycle arrest via CHK2 and inhibition of CDC2 (at the G2/M checkpoint, as applicable
  to oocyte), DNA repair (via activation of DNA strand resection which leads to homologous
  recombination) and/or apoptosis (via c-abl and TAp63α). DNA strand resection is
  necessary to invade in the homologous DNA strand. The resulting single-strand (ss)
  DNA is coated with RPA which in turn activates ATR and leads to cell cycle arrest
  (via CHK1). In germ cells, RPA is eventually replaced by Rad51 and DMC1 (the latter
  being germ-cell-specific) through a BRCA2-mediated process, which results in the
  initiation of homologous recombination. DSB sensor proteins are shown in blue, effectors
  are shown in green and transducers are shown in red. Molecules also involved in
  meiotic recombination are denoted with asterisk.
