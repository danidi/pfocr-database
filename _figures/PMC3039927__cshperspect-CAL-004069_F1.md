caption: 'Organellar Ca2+ buffering and intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. Ca2+ is stored
  within several different organelles including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), ERGIC,
  the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. A typical Ca2+ release pathway
  is shown at top: an extracellular ligand binds to its receptor, leading to production
  of IP3, which binds to the IP3R on the ER membrane, stimulating release of Ca2+
  from the ER lumen. Note that the Golgi apparatus also contains IP3R molecules and
  thus may contribute to Ca2+ release from stores; Golgi Ca2+ uptake occurs via SPCA
  pumps. As shown at left, Ca2+ released from the ER has several different fates,
  including regulation of gene transcription within the nucleus; uptake by mitochondria,
  which are typically closely apposed to the ER network and where Ca2+ can affect
  metabolism; or extrusion from the cell via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger plasma membrane proteins.
  Peroxisomes are known to maintain Ca2+ at higher levels than those of the cytoplasm,
  but how this gradient is developed and maintained is not yet known. Ca2+ levels
  are elevated in the ER, in the SR, in the ERGIC, and in the Golgi apparatus, with
  most Ca2+ bound to buffering proteins, as shown within these organelles. The store-operated
  Ca2+ entry (SOC) is also represented. In response to depleted ER Ca2+ stores, an
  ER luminal Ca2+ sensor, STIM1, oligomerizes and migrates to subplasmalemmal punctae
  where it communicates with Orai1. Orai1 functions as a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel
  that allows for Ca2+ entry from the extracellular milieu into the cytoplasm, where
  it is taken up by SERCA into the ER lumen. BiP/GRP78 binding protein/glucose-regulated
  protein of 78-kDa; CRT, calreticulin; ERGIC, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi intermediate
  complex; GRP94, glucose-regulated protein of 94-kDa; IP3, inositol trisphosphate;
  IP3R, inositol trisphosphate receptor; NCX, Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; P54/NEFA, DNA binding/EF
  hand/acidic amino acid rich region protein; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; SERCA,
  sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; SPCA, secretory pathway Ca2+-transport
  ATPase; STIM1, stromal interacting molecule 1.'
