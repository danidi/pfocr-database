caption: Proposed model of ATF2 regulation of Ha-Ras signaling. (A) Activation of
  Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling by v-Rel. The expression of v-Rel in fibroblast and lymphoid
  cells results in the induction of Ha-Ras activity. Activated Ha-Ras leads to the
  phosphorylation and activation of c-Raf (serine 338) and subsequent activation of
  MEK1/2 and ERK. The activation of ERK by this signaling cascade leads to the altered
  expression of a variety of genes. (B) ATF2 blocks Ha-Ras activation by v-Rel. The
  ectopic expression of ATF2 with v-Rel blocks v-Rel-mediated activation of Ha-Ras
  and the downstream Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. (C) The ectopic expression of ATF2 alone
  in DT40 cells has multiple effects on Ha-Ras signaling. Ectopically expressed ATF2
  is phosphorylated and activated by p38MAPK resulting in the induction of Ha-Ras
  activity. However, the activation of the downstream Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is blocked
  by phosphorylation of c-Raf at serine 259, which likely allows for binding of the
  inhibitory protein 14-3-3.
