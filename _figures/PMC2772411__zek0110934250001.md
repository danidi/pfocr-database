caption: Diagram of the CWI pathway. Stress conditions stimulate the CWI integrity
  pathway through stress sensors. There are additional stress sensors capable of activating
  the CWI pathway that are not represented in the figure, but our review focuses primarily
  on the Wsc1 and Mid2 sensors. In this simplified diagram, either the Wsc1 or Mid2
  stress sensor can bind to Rom2, which activates Rho1 as part of the upstream region
  of the pathway. Rho1 then initiates the PKC pathway by activating Pkc1. The PKC
  pathway includes the MAPK cascade of Bck1, Mkk1, Mkk2, and Slt2/Mpk1.
