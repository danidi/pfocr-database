caption: 'A schematic and simplified diagram of some salient features of AHR signalling
  pathways Black solid arrows depict the canonical pathway, dashed arrows alternative
  pathways, and the red solid arrow an example of their intersection. The blue bar
  represents AHR, pink bar ARNT, green bar AIP, brown bars a dimer of HSP90, and the
  red dot p23 (Modified from Lindén et al., ).ER: oestrogen receptor; CaMK: Ca2+/calmodulin‐dependent
  kinase; Cox2: cyclooxygenase 2; APP: acute‐phase protein; DME: drug‐metabolising
  enzyme. See text for details'
