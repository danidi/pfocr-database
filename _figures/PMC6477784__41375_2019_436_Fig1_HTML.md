caption: 'a The inflammasome as a gear or cogwheel that couples purinergic signaling
  with the complement cascade (ComC) in the process of HSPC mobilization. Pro-mobilizing
  stimuli (e.g., G-CSF) (1) release ATP from activated innate immunity Gr-1+ cells
  (2), which activates intracellular inflammasome via P2X7 purinergic receptors (3).
  As result of inflammasome activation several DAMPs are released, including Hmgb1
  and S100a9 (4), which are recognized by MBL and activate the ComC in the mannan-binding
  lectin-dependent pathway. Activation of the ComC leads to release of C5 cleavage
  fragments that are crucial for optimal release of HSPCs from BM into PB (5). In
  parallel, what is not shown in this scheme, the CoaC is also activated in an MBL-dependent
  manner. b The most important steps in the intracellular activation of NRLP3 inflammasome
  by ATP: Extracellular ATP activates P2X7 (step 1), which subsequently activates
  K+ efflux channel TWIK2 (step 2). A decrease in K+ intracellular levels triggers
  the activation of the NRLP3 inflammasome complex (step 3). In response to this caspase,
  1 cleaves pro-IL-1β and IL-18 to active ready for secretion IL-1β and IL-18 (step
  4), and in addition cleaves gasdermin that releases N-gasdermin (Step 5) that insert
  into the cell membrane to create pores (step 6) for the release of IL-1β and IL-18
  (step 7) as well as DAMPs (step 8)'
