caption: A microarray profiling of 467 human GBMs discovered that polo-like kinase
  1 (PLK1) was highly expressed in these tumors and that it clustered with the proliferative
  subtype. Patients with PLK1 -high tumors were more likely to die from their disease
  suggesting that current therapies are inactive against such tumors given their association
  with treatment failure. In brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) isolated from patients
  expressed 110–470 times more PLK1 than normal human astrocytes. Moreover, BTICs
  rely on PLK1 for survival because the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 inhibited their growth
  in tumorsphere cultures. PLK1 inhibition suppressed growth, caused G(2)/M arrest,
  induced apoptosis, and reduced the expression of SOX2, a marker of neural stem cells,
  in SF188 GBM cells. Likewise, in U251 GBM cells, PLK1 inhibition suppressed cell
  growth, downregulated SOX2, and induced cell death. Furthermore, BI2536 delayed
  tumor growth of U251 cells in an orthotopic brain tumor model, demonstrating that
  the drug is active against GBM. In conclusion, PLK1 level is elevated in GBM and
  its inhibition restricts the growth of brain cancer cells(–). The PLK pathway is
  shown in .
