caption: Regulation of mechanotransduction in the TRNs. MFB-1-dependent ubiquitination
  and removal of MEC-4 mediates the change in touch sensitivity by both integrin (green
  pathway) and insulin signaling (red pathway). Integrin signaling may increase MEC-4
  activity through additional pathways (green dotted pathway and “?”). The same pathway
  also partially contributes to less sensitivity in the posterior TRNs (blue pathway).
  Dashed lines indicate that the signaling strength is reduced in the specific conditions/cells.
  Dotted lines indicate the hypothesized pathway. In the posterior TRNs, the size
  of the labels of proteins indicates the relative abundance (or activity) of that
  protein compared with the anterior TRNs under normal conditions.
