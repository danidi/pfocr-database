caption: The metabolic pathway of 5-FU and the molecular mechanisms of S-1 that exert
  antitumor effects.One of the metabolic pathways of 5-FU begins with the process
  of phosphorylation by OPRT and further metabolized into (F)RNA. Then, (F)RNA is
  recognized as an abnormal RNA metabolism, which causes RNA dysfunction. Another
  process that causes DNA synthesis inhibition starts with phosphorylation of 5-FU
  by OPRT, then 5-FU is metabolized to FdUMP that forms ternary complex with TS. Also,
  5-FU is phosphorylated to FdUrd by TP, TP reversibly converts FdUrd into 5-FU and
  is involved in the angiogenesis. In addition, DPD can degrade 5-FU in the liver.
  OPRT, Orotate phosphoribosyl transferase; FUMP, 5-fluorouridine 5′-monophosphate;
  FUDP, 5-fluorouridine 5′-diphosphate; FUTP, 5-fluorouridine 5′-triphosphate; FdUDP,
  5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-diphosphate; FdUMP, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate;
  TS, thymidylate synthase; CH2FH4, 5,10-methylentetrahydrofolate; DPD, dihydropyrimidine
  dehydrogenase; TP, Thymidine phosphorylase; FdUrd, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine.
