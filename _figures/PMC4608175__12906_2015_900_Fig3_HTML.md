caption: Events controlled by Se2+ added papaya extract in cutaneous wound healing
  cascade. Se2+ added papaya PBS extract treatment results in the transient up-regulation
  of (TGF-β and VEGFA at earlier phase of healing (Fig. ) and consequently results
  in increased fibroblasts recruitment (Fig. , ) and angiogenesis (Table ). The expression
  of TGF-β in turn promotes synthesis of collagen and ground substances while expression
  of VEGF promotes new blood vessel formation through angiogenesis. Se2+ added papaya
  PBS extract either stops or reduces further PMNL infiltration (Fig. ) at the wound
  area thus subsides inflammatory reactions. All together these contribute to accelerated
  and improved wound healing without inflammation at later stages
