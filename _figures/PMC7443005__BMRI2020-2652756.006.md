caption: 'MicroRNA-mRNA networks in the atherosclerosis signaling pathway after TCDD
  and Aroclor1254 coexposure in ApoE−/− mice. The atherosclerosis signaling pathway
  was significantly altered after treatment with TCDD and Aroclor1254. The mRNAs with
  red meant altered genes after treatment. The solid arrow between miRNA and mRNAs
  denoted the interaction between miRNAs and mRNAs. Significantly upregulated or downregulated
  mRNAs: fold change > 2 (p value < 0.05) or fold change < 2 (p value < 0.05). Significantly
  upregulated genes or downregulated miRNAs: fold change > 1.5 (p value < 0.05) or
  fold change < 1.5 (p value < 0.05), respectively.'
