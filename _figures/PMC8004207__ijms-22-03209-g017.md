caption: Schematic diagram showing the effect of prenatal exposure to VPA on the pathological
  changes in the brains of young-adult male offspring. A single i.p. injection of
  VPA at 12.5 days of pregnancy induced a disturbance in homeostasis of microtubule-associated
  proteins (significantly decrease in the level of α/β-tubulin together with an excessive
  rise in total Tau level) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of young-adult offspring.
  Additionally, hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein (significantly increase in the
  level of pTau(Ser396) and pTau(Ser416)) was observed exclusively in the cerebral
  cortex of VPA rats. The effect of VPA on the potential molecular mechanisms responsible
  for Tau dyshomeostasis as well as the Tau-kinases activity was brain structure-specific.
  In the hippocampus, deregulation of Akt/GSK-3β/mTORC1 pathway and activation of
  CDK5 kinase have been proposed as potential triggers of a molecular cascade leading
  to Tau accumulation. In turn, in the cerebral cortex, the involvement of MAPK-ERK1/2/mTORC1
  signalling deregulation in Tau dyshomeostasis is suggested. Moreover, in addition
  to the CDK5 kinase, the involvement of ERK1/2 and p70S6K has been proposed as critical
  in the stimulation of Tau protein phosphorylation in the cerebral cortex of VPA
  offspring.
