caption: 'Targets of antifolate drugs. As indicated by red blunted arrows, bioactivated
  PAS (hydroxy-H2PteGlu), trimethoprim, and WR99210 inhibit DfrA; 4-aminobenzene sulfonamides
  and dapsone inhibit FolP1. PAS is a prodrug that is activated through the folate
  biosynthetic pathway (shown on the left). PAS differs from PABA by the presence
  of a hydroxyl group in the ortho position (circled in red). The native folate synthesis
  pathway is represented on the right. During bioactivation, PAS serves as an alternate
  substrate to PABA and is sequentially converted to hydroxy-H2Pte and hydroxy-H2PteGlu
  by FolP1 and FolC, respectively. Relevant enzymes are blue. Abbreviations: DHPPP,
  7,8-dihydropterin pyrophosphate; PABA, para-aminobenzoic acid; Glu, glutamate; H2Pte,
  dihydropteroate; H2PteGlu, dihydrofolate; H4PteGlu, tetrahydrofolate; DHPS, H2Pte
  synthase; DHFS, dihydrofolate synthase; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase.'
