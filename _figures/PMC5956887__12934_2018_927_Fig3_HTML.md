caption: Metabolic profile of aerobically growing wild-type strain C. glutamicum ATCC
  31831. Relative abundance of metabolic intermediates in C. glutamicum cells during
  aerobic growth in BT medium containing either d-glucose (open columns) or l-arabinose
  (gray columns) as the sole carbon source are shown. For the profiling experiment,
  the wild-type strain was grown aerobically to late log phase in A medium containing
  d-glucose (20 g/L) and l-arabinose (20 g/L), and the culture was then inoculated
  to an initial OD600 of 0.2 into BT medium containing either d-glucose (20 g/L) or
  l-arabinose (20 g/L) as the sole carbon source. The cells were harvested at mid
  log phase (OD600 = 1.5) and subjected to metabolic profiling. Data are presented
  as average ± standard deviation calculated from the results of triplicate individual
  experiments. Single and double asterisks indicate p values of < 0.05 and < 0.01,
  respectively
