caption: The current model of how Vmem regulates ability of cells to form tumors is
  as follows [].(A) In unperturbed embryos, polarized Vmem is generated and maintained
  by several ion channels and pumps present in the plasma membrane; this condition
  allows moderate amounts of butyrate to influx through SLC5A8 and inhibits histone
  deacetylases (HDACs). This epigenetically regulates transcription machinery thereby
  maintaining baseline level proliferation and differentiation compatible with normal
  somatic morphostasis.(B) Expression of oncogenes, or other physiological events
  (e.g., non-genetically induced depolarization, as described in [–]), results in
  the inability of SLC5A8 to import butyrate. Higher HDAC activity then leads to overproliferation
  and other neoplastic changes leading to appearance of tumor structures.(C) The effect
  can be blocked by forced hyperpolarization via molecular and/or pharmacological
  targeting of H+, K+, or Cl− ion translocators. Forced hyperpolarization of the overall
  transmembrane potential efficiently powers the uptake of Na+ through SLC5A8. This
  energetically favorable intake of Na+ drives the inward flux of butyrate through
  SLC5A8. High levels of butyrate continually block HDAC, which leads to hyperacetylation
  of important genes resulting in cell cycle arrest and suppression of tumor formation.(D)
  The bioelectric pathway is similar to that of the depolarization-induced metastasis
  (), except that the transduction mechanism involves SLC5A8 and butyrate (instead
  of SERT and serotonin), and initially regulates a chromatin modification enzyme
  (HDAC) upstream of transcriptional changes that lead to tumor formation.
