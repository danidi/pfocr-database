caption: Yin and Yang of the ATM-CHK2-p53 signaling pathway upon BRCA1 mutation-associated
  premature aging and tumorigenesis. ATM-CHK2-p53 signaling pathway senses DNA damage/genomic
  instability and acts as a gatekeeper to eliminate mutations, but, as a side effect,
  it may also lead to premature aging.
