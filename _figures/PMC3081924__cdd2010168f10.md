caption: Model for SENP2-mediated modulation of Mdm2 in regulating p53. The diagram
  illustrates the mechanism underlying the regulation of Mdm2 by the SUMO pathway
  to control the cellular level of p53. SENP2 regulates p53 through modulation of
  Mdm2. SENP2 interacts with sumoylated Mdm2 and regulates its SUMO conjugation at
  the PML body. The SENP2-dependent SUMO modification acts upstream of the binding
  of Mdm2 and p53 in the regulatory pathway. Desumoylation of Mdm2 permits its binding
  and ubiquitination of p53, which is then degraded through the proteolysis system
