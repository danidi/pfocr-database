caption: 'cis-Silencing: The Virus/Transgene and Heterochromatin siRNA Pathways.(A)
  Virus and sense transgene PTGS: Viruses and transgenes can give rise to primary
  siRNAs by direct production of dsRNA (during RNA virus replication) or aberrant
  transcripts. Once a primary pool of siRNAs is produced, the PTGS process is initiated
  and an amplification loop is established whereby siRNA-guided AGO1 cleavage of viral
  or transgene transcripts leads to the RDR6/SGS3/SDE5-dependent production of dsRNA,
  which is processed by DCL4 or DCL2 into 21- to 22-nucleotide (nt) siRNAs that bind
  to AGO1 and guide cleavage of additional viral and transgene transcripts. Therefore,
  unlike MIR and TAS genes, viruses and transgenes both produce siRNAs and are subsequently
  targeted by these siRNAs.(B) The 24-nucleotide siRNA heterochromatin pathway: Repeat
  DNA and transposons are transcriptionally silenced through DNA methylation and heterochromatin
  formation. Transcripts produced by PolIV are thought to be substrates for RDR2-mediated
  synthesis of dsRNA, which is processed by DCL3 into 24-nucleotide siRNAs. These
  siRNAs are methylated by HEN1 and loaded onto AGO4, AGO6, and AGO9, which direct
  DNA methylation through the DNA methyltransferase DRM2. DNA methylation of some
  loci also requires PolIV and the SWI2/SNF2-like chromatin remodeling factor DRD1.
  In addition to siRNA-dependent TGS, silencing of some loci is maintained in an siRNA-independent
  manner through the methyltransferase MET1, the histone deacetylase HDA6, and the
  SWI2/SNF2-like chromatin remodeling factor DDM1.'
