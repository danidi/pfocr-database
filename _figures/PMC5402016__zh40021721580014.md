caption: Proposed model for PECAM-1/PI3K-mediated activation of the integrins FAK,
  p38, COX-2, and PGI2 in ECs exposed to FSS. Based on our findings we propose that
  the shear-induced upregulation of COX-2 and release of PGI2 is mediated by a PECAM-1-mediated/PI3K
  integrin activation complex. FSS activation of PECAM-1 results in the phosphorylation
  of PI3K, which subsequently activates integrins. Upon integrin activation FAK is
  phosphorylated, leading to the downstream phosphorylation of MAPK p38. Phosphorylation
  of the MAPK signaling pathway leads to the transcription of COX-2 mRNA and posttranscriptional
  synthesis of COX-2 protein and PGI2 release in ECs exposed to FSS.
