caption: (A) Zebrafish larvae were pretreated with either vehicle control, or each
  of the compounds from the Sigma LOPAC1280 library of pharmacologically active compounds
  at a final concentration of 0.01 mM. Three hours later, at 72 hr post-fertilization
  (hpf), larvae were treated with either vehicle control or cisplatin, at a concentration
  of 0.02 mM. 48 hr later, larval neuromasts were stained with YO-PRO1 and subjected
  to fluorescence profiling using a Biosorter. Peak Height (PH) green fluorescence
  is displayed, in comparison with untreated larvae. Each compound was tested on four
  larvae and the average is displayed. The aqua point in the X represents dopamine
  hydrochloride and the red point with the X represents L-mimosine. The blue lines
  correspond to 0.9–1.1 fold of the control value and the red line corresponds to
  the average of fish treated with cisplatin alone. (B) HK-2 kidney proximal tubule
  cells were either treated with vehicle control, 0.005 mM cisplatin alone, or 0.005
  mM cisplatin + each of the compounds from the Sigma LOPAC1280 drug library at a
  final concentration of 0.01 mM. Two days later, an alamar Blue assay was performed
  according to the manufacturer’s instructions to determine cell viability. Fold change
  in viability (in comparison with vehicle control treated cells) is displayed. The
  average of two wells was used per drug. Highlighted points and lines correspond
  to those in A). (C) The dopamine biosynthesis pathway consists of intermediate molecules
  and enzymes (indicated with green ovals). The compounds that were hits in both assays
  are shown in light blue boxes. L-mimosine is able to inhibit dopamine beta-hydroxylase.
  P-fluoro-L-phenylalanine can act as a substrate for tyrosine hydroxylase. GBR-12909
  dihydrochloride (aka. Vanoxerine) is a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor. All
  these compounds could have the net pharmacological effect of increasing available
  dopamine levels.
