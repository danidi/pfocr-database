caption: Mechanisms by which mitochondrial DNA activates innate immunity. Mitochondrial
  DNA (mtDNA) released from mitochondria following cell damage and stress (e.g. cationic
  carriers) can activate TLR9 in endosomes, leading to the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine genes and increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including MMP-8,
  TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β. In addition, mtDNA escaped into the cytosol after herpes
  virus infection, can be detected by the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway, which results
  in TBK1-IRF3-dependent expression of type I interferon (IFN I) and dampening viral
  replication. However, the activation of caspases involved in the intrinsic pathway
  of apoptosis (caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9) can prevent the activation of
  IFN response. Moreover, stimulation such as ATP induces mitochondrial dysfunction
  resulting in mtDNA release into the cytoplasm, where it binds to and activates the
  NLRP3 inflammasome. Interaction with the adaptor protein Asc and procaspase-1, the
  NLRP3 inflammasome enables the recruitment and activation of caspase-1, which cleaves
  pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their bioactive mature forms. On the other hand, microtubule-associated
  protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B)/Beclin 1-mediated autophagy are involved in the
  clearance of mtDNA, and thus negatively regulating the NLRP3 inflammasome activation
