caption: 'Schematic diagram of collagen alpha-3 (VI) chains and endotrophin function
  in tumor progression and cisplatin resistance. The collagen alpha-3 (VI) chain C5
  domain fragment endotrophin regulates tumor EMT and fibrosis through a TGF-β-dependent
  pathway. Endotrophin can also promote tumor inflammation through the recruitment
  of macrophages and enhances the expression level of inflammatory cytokines, such
  as IL6 and TNF-α, or through the recruitment of endothelial cells into the tumor
  microenvironment to promote tumor angiogenesis and increase the expression level
  of angiogenesis markers, such as CD31, VEGFR2, and HIF1α. It is not clear whether
  the effect of collagen alpha-3 (VI) chain on tumor behavior is by affecting the
  collagen VI structure stability, either by affecting the signal transduction ability
  of collagen VI molecules, or both. In terms of drug resistance, endotrophin can
  induce tumor cells to resist cisplatin through the TGF-β-EMT pathway, and treatment
  with endotrophin mAb or TZDs can block this process by downregulating endotrophin
  levels and eventually give rise to increased cisplatin sensitivity. Additionally,
  COL6A3 is highly expressed in densely growing mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs)
  and promotes the 3D growth of MEFs by suppressing the Hippo signaling pathway and
  promoting the Wnt signaling pathway.Abbreviations: TGF-β, transforming growth factor
