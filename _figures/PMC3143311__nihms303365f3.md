caption: iNKT cell defects in cancer shown in red. iNKT defects can be corrected (green).
  NKT cells can contribute to anti-tumor responses through several mechanisms, but
  the dominant protective pathway described to date depends on mutual stimulation
  of iNKT cells interacting with CD1d+ APC, such as some myeloid dendritic cells in
  humans, most APC in rodents.
