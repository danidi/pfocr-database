caption: Potential fate of extracellular 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua via metabolic salvage
  pathways. Neither 8-oxodG nor 8-oxodGMP can be phosphorylated because they are not
  substrates for deoxynucleoside kinase or guanylate kinase, respectively. Therefore,
  the alternative pathway discussed by Hah et al. () relies on degradation of extracellular
  8-oxodG to 8-oxoGua, perhaps by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP). 6-Hydroxypurine
  phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase) can catalyze the formation of 8-oxoGMP, providing
  a route for the oxidized moiety, via nucleoside-phosphate kinase (NPK) and nucleoside-diphosphate
  kinase (NDK), to be incorporated into RNA. In this model, ribonucleoside-diphosphate
  reductase (RDR) is responsible for the conversion of 8-oxoGua-containing ribonucleotides
  to deoxyribonucleotide equivalents. NDK then catalyses the phosphorylation of 8-oxodGDP
  to 8-oxoGTP, a substrate for DNA polymerases, for incorporation into DNA. Potential
  sources of extracellular 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua (diet, cell death, DNA repair) are
  indicated, contributions from which may have profound implications for the cell
  and for our understanding of the true meaning of the measurement of these biomarkers
  of oxidative stress.
