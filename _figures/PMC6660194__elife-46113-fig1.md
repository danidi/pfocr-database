caption: 'PTTH initiates a signalling cascade that results in the biosynthesis of
  ecdysone. The decline of the ecdysone titre triggers the release of ETH that, in
  turn, causes the release of EH. These two hormones mutually enhance one another
  in a positive feedback loop to control and regulate pre-ecdysis behaviour. With
  the ensuing release of CCAP, caused by EH, pre-ecdysis ceases and the ecdysis motor
  program is started. Finally, bursicon responds to the increasing levels of CCAP
  and initiates post-ecdysis behaviour and cuticle tanning. This figure is based on
  the studies of  and . Animal silhouettes were obtained under Public Domain licence
