caption: The MDM2–p53 pathway, the apoptosis-sensitive phenotype induced by MYCN and
  their modulation by Nutlin-3, in neuroblastoma cells. p53 is rarely mutated in neuroblastoma.
  Rather, its inactivation occurs at the functional level, mostly via increased MDM2
  activity (A). When p53 is uncoupled from MDM2 (by means of Nutlin-3) an unmodified
  p53 accumulates in MYCN single copy cells, driving them mostly into a reversible
  cell cycle arrest (B). MYCN overexpression and MNA amplification lead to dramatic
  changes in multiple components of the MDM2–p53 pathways, modulating both pro- and
  antiapoptotic factors in a coordinated fashion, which does not result in cell growth
  inhibition or apoptosis, but rather in an apoptosis-sensitive phenotype, which strongly
  depends on p53 and HIPK2 and can be easily recruited by several sources of stress
  (C). In MNA cells, Nutlin-3 not only uncouples p53 from the MDM2 inhibition, but
  also leads to strong HIPK2 induction and consequently to commitment of p53 toward
  apoptosis (D).
