caption: Hypothetical model for the PDF-dependent cell death/tauopathy pathway activated
  by reductions in DBT or CLK activity. Red proteins are in the inactive state and
  green proteins are in the active state. (A) In wild-type genotypes, SPAG associates
  with DBT to maintain it in the dephosphorylated state. DBT maintains the caspase
  DRONC in the inactive state and allows normal CLK activity via phosphorylation and
  degradation of PER; (B) With knock-down of SPAG, DBT autophosphorylates its C terminus
  and is degraded in response to light. This allows cleavage of DRONC to activate
  it and inactivation of CLK via accumulation of high levels of PER. A dominant negative
  DBT or inactive CLK mutation may likewise activate DRONC directly and/or via a PDF-dependent
  pathway. As a consequence, tau is cleaved, DRONC is activated, PPL1 neurons die,
  age-related locomotor declines are expedited and flies die sooner. Arrows represent
  positive action, and T-bars represent negative action. X indicates degradation.
