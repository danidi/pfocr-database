caption: Selected pathways up- and downregulated by the additional hemorrhagic shock.
  Upregulated pathways (red) include cytokine and chemokine secretion, neutrophil
  chemotaxis, cell adhesion, and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway and affect
  mainly the innate immune response. Signaling pathways such as the JNK, ERK1/2 and
  MAPK cascades, and NFκB signaling were also upregulated. Downregulated pathways
  (green) affect largely the adaptive immunity, such as B- and T-cell activation as
  well as the MHC class II protein complex.
