caption: 'Proposed mechanistic link between Por deletion and up-regulation of MHC
  II expression in enterocytes. Metabolic pathways are indicated by black arrows,
  whereas signaling pathways are represented by blue dashed arrows. Genes found to
  have increased expression, at either mRNA or protein level, and metabolites found
  to have increased levels in the IE-Cpr-null enterocytes are shown in red. The GTPase
  is expected to have increased activity, due to increased prenylation (as indicated
  by square brackets). The criteria for inclusion of genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis
  pathway were p < 0.05 and fold change > 25%. The metabolic step catalyzed by CYP51
  is completely blocked (solid ×), whereas the step catalyzed by SQLE is partially
  inhibited (dashed ×), by the loss of POR, leading to accumulation of 24-dihydrolanosterol
  as well as the isoprenoids. Abbreviations and gene symbols not already listed in  or
  mentioned elsewhere include the following: Hmgcs1, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
  A synthase 1; Hmgcr, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase; Mvk, mevalonate
  kinase; FDPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthetase.'
