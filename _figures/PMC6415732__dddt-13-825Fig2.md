caption: 'Most important upstream signaling in the regulation of autophagy and apoptosis
  processes.Notes: Growth factors and nutrients stimulate the PI3K and Ras pathways,
  and their downstream effectors, such as Akt and Erk kinases, directly inactivate
  TSC1/2 complex by its phosphorylation and in this way activate mTORC1, which negatively
  regulates autophagy through inhibitory phosphorylation of Ulk1 and Ulk2 kinases.
  However, mTORC1 signaling can be suppressed by AMPK. The AMPK pathway is activated
  by the tumor suppressor LKB1 during energetic stress resulting from low energy and
  oxygen levels. The active TSC1/2 complex switches autophagy off by inactivation
  of Rheb and mTORC. Moreover, AMPK directly associates with Ulk1 to activate autophagy
  in response to multinutrient deprivation. Cells exposed to long-term stress factors
  can succumb to cell death. During apoptosis, proapoptotic proteins such as Bax and
  Bak can be activated. These proteins are responsible for the disruption of the MOMP
  and the release of other proapoptotic proteins including cytochrome c that in turn
  activates effector caspases. Activation of both processes can be initiated by accumulation
  of ROS. ROS can activate autophagy through Beclin-1 and hVps34. Increased levels
  of ROS can lead to genomic instability through direct damage to DNA. This can activate
  p53 proteins that lead to the induction of the processes of both autophagy and apoptosis.,Abbreviations:
  AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; mTORC1, mammalian targets of rapamycin complex
  1; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase; ERK, extracellular signal–regulated
  kinase.'
