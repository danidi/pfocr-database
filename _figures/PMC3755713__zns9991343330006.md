caption: Proposed circuit activated during reinstatement of cocaine seeking. The circuit
  illustrates the connectivity of regions that have been implicated in the reinstatement
  of drug seeking. Neurotransmission from the PL () and VTA converge on the NAcore,
  which sends an indirect pathway projection to the ventral pallidum, initiating drug
  seeking. In contrast, activity in the direct projections from the NAcore to the
  SN is not necessary for reinstated cocaine. Arrows indicate the direction of the
  projection. Red solid arrows indicate projections in which activity is required
  for cocaine-plus-cue-induced reinstatement, while dashed arrows identify activities
  that are not necessary for the behavior.
