caption: 'An array of cellular stressors can perturb the folding environment in the
  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leading to unfolded or misfolded protein. In response
  to the folding imbalance, cells initiate the cytoprotective unfolded protein response
  (UPR). A: The problem of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER is addressed by
  increasing the folding capacity through the up-regulation of the expression of chaperone
  proteins, attenuating translation by regulating eIF2α, and promoting the degradation
  of misfolded proteins through ER-associated degradation (ERAD). If UPR is unable
  to restore the folding balance, ER stress will eventually lead to apoptotic cell-death.
  B: The three signal transduction pathways mediating the unfolded protein response
  in higher eukaryotes. First, the PRKR-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway is initiated
  after BiP dissociation from PERK. While PERK transduces both pro-and anti-apoptotic
  signals, its main function is translation attenuation through the phosphorylation
  of eIF2α. Next, the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) pathway is activated
  following BiP dissociation. ATF6 induces the expression of chaperones e.g., BiP
  as well as apoptosis effectors such as CHOP. Lastly, the inositol-requiring kinase
  1 (IRE1) pathway is activated following BiP dissociation from IRE1. Activated IRE1
  has both an endoribonuclease and a serine-threonine kinase activity that drive can
  pro-apoptotic signals.'
