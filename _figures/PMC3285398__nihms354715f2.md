caption: 'The proposed mechanisms of interaction between TLRs and MUCs: I. Ligand-TLR
  interaction initiates signaling pathways leading to the induction of several pro-inflammatory
  cytokines MAPKs and NF-κB which are known to induce mucin gene expression. Alternatively
  these molecules can also induce TLR expression in turn regulating mucin expression
  thereby forming a self-perpetuating signaling loop. Constitutively active TLR pathways
  are commonly observed in several cancers.II. Mucins can also activate signaling
  pathways such as their interaction with receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 and other
  molecules activates signaling pathways which have common downstream signaling components
  and lead to a cross-talk with TLR signaling pathway. III. Mucins are large glycoprotein
  molecules which exhibit the receptor masking and can provide a steric hindrance
  for endogenous ligand binding to TLRs thus inhibiting their signaling pathway. IV.
  The sequestration of TLR ligands in the dense mucin matrix can have two possible
  outcomes either activation or inhibition of TLR signaling pathway. V. Altered glycosylation
  of mucin molecules can act as a ligand for TLRs and activate TLR signaling pathway.'
