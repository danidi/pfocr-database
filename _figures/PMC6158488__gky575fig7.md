caption: Regulatory mechanism of RNA silencing by LGP2. The left panel shows the RNA
  silencing pathway in the absence of LGP2. TRBP recruits TRBP-bound pre-miRNA to
  Dicer to promote miRNA maturation. Mature miRNA is loaded onto AGO protein to form
  active RISC, resulting in the repression of target genes. The right panel shows
  the inhibitory mechanism of the RNA silencing pathway in the presence of LGP2. LGP2
  interacts with the dsRNA-binding site of TRBP to prevent pre-miRNA recruitment,
  resulting in the repression of TRBP-bound pre-miRNA activity, which leads to target
  gene upregulation.
