caption: We hypothesize that BMP9 regulates the expression and secretion of matricellular
  proteins, CYR61 and CTGF, via crosstalk between the BMP (endoglin, ALK1, and SMAD1/5)
  and Hippo (Zyxin, YAP1, SMAD) signaling pathways. We suggest that the secretion
  of CYR61/CTGF regulates the composition and function of focal adhesion proteins,
  cell migration and ECM remodeling, and acts as a key effector of BMP9 signaling
  via the HHT target genes, ALK1 and endoglin.
