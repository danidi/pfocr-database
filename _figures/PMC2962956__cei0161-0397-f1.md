caption: Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling and inhibition by viral proteins. Upon
  ligation of the TLRs with their respective ligands, TIR domain-containing adaptors
  are recruited to the receptors. MyD88 is the prototypical member of the group being
  utilized by all TLRs except TLR3, which utilizes TRIF only. TLR2 requires MAL along
  with MyD88 and TLR4 requires all four adapters, including TRAM, as a bridging adapter
  to TRIF. Adaptor recruitment leads to the activation of interleukin-1 receptor-associated
  kinase (IRAK4) and the phosphorylation of IRAK1. IRAK1 and IRAK2 signal to tumour
  necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF)6, which leads to the activation
  of the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK)1-containing complex.
  This stimulates the kinase activity of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex and triggers
  the activation of NFκB, allowing its movement into the nucleus and the expression
  of proinflammatory cytokines. The pathway to IRF3 and IRF7 activation following
  TRIF stimulation from either TLR3 or TLR4 requires TRAF3 and the IKKε/TRAF family
  member-associated NF-κB activator-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) complex, resulting in
  type I IFN production. TLR7 and TLR9 activate the IRAK1/TRAF6 complex that stimulates
  IKKα phosphorylation and activation of IRF7, allowing the production of type I IFNs.
  A46R from the vaccinia virus associates with and inhibits all four adaptor proteins,
  MyD88, MAL, TRAM and TRIF. In contrast, A52R from vaccinia virus (VACV) binds to
  and inhibits IRAK2, while K7 inhibits DDX3, a component of the IKKε/TBK1 complex.
  The hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease NS3-4A cleaves and inactivates TRIF, while
  NS5A, also from HCV, sequesters MyD88.
