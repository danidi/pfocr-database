caption: Sphingolipid structure and basic metabolism. (a) Structure of d18:1/18:0
  ceramide (Cer) and sphingomyelin (SM). (b) Sphingolipid biosynthesis and breakdown.
  De novo synthesis of sphingolipids occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, producing
  ceramides from serine and palmitoyl Coenzyme A (CoA). Ceramide transfer protein
  (CERT) transfers ceramides to the Golgi, where they are converted to SM and glycosphingolipids,
  such as hexosylceramide (HexCer) and sulfatide. Sphingolipid breakdown in lysosomes
  results in the generation of sphingosine (Sph), which can be recycled back to ceramide
  in the salvage pathway or phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) or SphK2,
  forming sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). S1P can also be reutilized for sphingolipid
  synthesis in the salvage pathway or broken down in the endoplasmic reticulum by
  S1P lyase (SPL).
