caption: The schematic summary of Osx’s mission in the complex communications among
  different bone cells and its potential role in bone micro-environment. Osx affects
  the differentiation, maturation and function by regulating the different target
  genes, which were presented in the blue box. Osx directly controls the expression
  of integrin β3, which plays a mediating role in osteocyte-bone matrix interaction.
  The most abundant gap junction protein Connexin43 (Cx43) was significantly regulated
  by Osx positively. Osx decreases osteoblast activity by stimulating the expression
  of sclerostin (Sost) and Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf-related protein
  1 (Dkk1). Both of them are predominantly expressed in osteocytes. And Sost also
  functions as a secreted osteoclast-derived BMP antagonist to promotes osteoclast
  differentiation. In addition, Osx represses adipogenesis by negatively regulating
  PPARy expression and transcriptional activity, and adipocytes suppress osteoblasts
  and promote bone resorption by the recruitment of osteoclasts.
