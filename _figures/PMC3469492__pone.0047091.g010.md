caption: Alkylation damage on the leading (left half) and lagging (right half) strand
  template is repaired by a rad2, swi1, swi3 and swi7-1 dependent pathway leading
  to the formation of single-stranded regions behind but in close proximity to the
  progressing fork. These intermediates are detected by 2D-gel analysis below the
  y-arc for the wild-type strain (). The single-stranded regions lead to Holliday
  junction (HJ) formation either by formation of double-stranded breaks or by fork
  regression.
