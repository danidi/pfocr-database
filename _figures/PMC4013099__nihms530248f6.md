caption: Proposed crosstalk between polyamine and nitric oxid (NO) pathways and schematic
  presentation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) interaction partners. (a) Arginine
  is converted to ornithine by the action of arginase in the urea cycle. The enzyme
  ODC converts ornithine to putrescine and is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of
  higher polyamines (spermidine, spermine). The NO pathway enzyme sepiapterin reductase
  (SPR) converts 6-pyruvoyl tetrahydropterin to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor
  for NO synthase (NOS) which converts arginine to citrulline. In reverse, citrulline
  converts to arginine via argininosuccinate (AS) (b) ODC forms a heterodimer complex
  with SPR which activates ODC and stimulates cell proliferation. Downregulation of
  SPR in neuroblastoma (NB) cells leads to significant inhibition of ODC activity
  and reduces cell proliferation. The biological unit for both ODC and SPR proteins
  is a homodimer (in graphic depicted as an oval). (c) Antizymes (OAZs) are well known
  to interact with ODC and bind with greater affinity to antizyme inhibitors (AZINs).
  In this study, a novel concept for the field of polyamines is introduced in which
  SPR interacts with ODC and presents another means to control ODC activity, by potentially
  out-competing OAZ. Based on computational docking predictions, it is also possible
  that SPR interacts with AZIN, but the functional consequence of this association
  remains to be determined. Our discovery promises new inroads for target intervention
  and manipulation of the polyamine pathway which, given the recent explosion of clinical
  trials with DFMO in chemoprevention studies, is both timely and important.
