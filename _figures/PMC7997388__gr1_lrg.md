caption: 'A schematic representation of the human complement system. The three activation
  pathways of the system (Classical, Lectin and Alternative) are represented together
  with the Terminal pathway that eventually leads to the formation of the Membrane
  Attack Complex (MAC) after complement activation. Regulatory inhibitory proteins
  are shown in shaded boxes; complement receptors in pentagons. One positive regulator,
  properdin, which stabilizes C3bBb is not shown. Missense polymorphic variants of
  the genes encoding for C3 , C4BPα  and C5aR1  have been recently associated with
  a susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and establishment. The highlighted
  complement components, as well as their coloured associated products and processes,
  are important for the homeostasis of complement and its interactions with cellular
  immune surveillance and defence. Recent studies have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2
  virus is exploiting the Alternative pathway to gradually drain the host of complement
  and disrupt associated cellular immune responses (; ). C3and C4BPαfx2polymorphic
  variants: During SARS-CoV-2 virus infection specific point mutations in the C3 and
  C4BP proteins can hypothetically, independently or synergistically, lead to the
  strengthening of the relevant dynamics of the AP amplification loop facilitating
  a faster consumption of C3 and inefficient opsonisation. Turnover of C3 can gradually
  cripple the activation of the downstream terminal complement components. This can
  eventually lead to reduction of C5a anaphylatoxin release and limited or no formation
  of the terminal MAC attack complex. In terms of the point mutations discussed in
  the text, faster consumption of C3 can occur either through the weakening of the
  inactivation of the viral surface deposited C3/C3b by complement factor I in the
  presence of a cofactor such as FH or C4BP, or through the strengthening of the interaction
  of C3b with the activated FB (Bb) in the C3bBb C3 convertase of the Alternative
  pathway. The weakening of the C3/C3b inactivation leads not only to poor opsonisation
  and enhanced masking of the viral particles from phagocytic cells expressing the
  CR3 and/or CR4 receptors, but also from any cross-reactive B cells expressing the
  CR2 receptor. C5aR1polymorphic variants: During the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2
  virus infection and prior to any exploitation of the Alternative pathway amplification
  loop, any downstream assembly of the C5 convertase can support the release of C5a
  which is regarded as the most potent complement anaphylatoxin. Its immune pleiotropic
  potency however can be hampered by any mutations in the C5aR1 that weaken the interaction
  of the ligand with the receptor. In terms of the point mutations discussed in the
  text, the lack of efficient C5a-C5aR1 interaction can actually weaken critical immune
  defence responses at sites of infections that include chemoattraction of specialized
  immune cell types and subsets of granulocytes and neutrophils.  was adapted from
