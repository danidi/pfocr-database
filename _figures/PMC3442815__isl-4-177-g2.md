caption: Figure 2. Sphingolipid synthesis and its subcellular topology. The synthesis
  of the central sphingolipid, ceramide, begins with the de novo pathway at the surface
  of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the condensation of palmitoyl-CoA and serine
  by serine palmitoyl transferase 1 (SPT). Ceramide is transported to the golgi by
  ceramide transport protein (CERT) where glucosylceramide (GluCer) and sphingomyelin
  (SM) are synthesized. Ceramide is a precursor for subspecies ceramide-1-phosphate
  (C-1-P) and galactosylceramide (GalCer) within neutral compartments. GalCer may
  be sulphated forming sulfatide which associates with insulin crystals within granules.
  Higher glycosphingolipids (GSLs) such as gangliosides are formed at the trans-golgi
  then delivered to the plasma membrane (PM) along with ceramide and SM. SM can produce
  localized increases in ceramide via activation of the sphingomyelinase (SMase) pathway
  which causes association of ceramide with cholesterol and GSLs in subpools of the
  PM termed detergent resistant membranes. GSLs, SM and ceramide are degraded to sphingosine
  (Sph) in the late endosomes and lysosomes. Sphingosine exits the lysosome and may
  either be salvaged back into ceramide or form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P), a
  key lipid signaling intermediate, which can be terminally degraded to ethanolamine
  phosphate and hexadecenal. Dotted lines indicate salvage/recycling pathways, whereas
  solid lines signify de novo synthesis. SMase, sphingomyelinase; SMS1/2, sphingomyelin
  synthase 1/2; GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; CerS, ceramide synthase; GalTase,
  galactosyltransferase; SK, sphingosine kinase; CK, ceramide kinase; CDase, ceramidase;
  S1P lyase, sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase; SPPase, sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase.
