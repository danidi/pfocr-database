caption: Immune response, immunopathology, and mechanism of action of immunotherapeutics
  for SARS-CoV-2 infection (intracellular). Inhibitory effects represented by red
  lines, while activating effects represented by green lines. Created withBioRender.comThe
  spike protein surrounding SARS-CoV-2 engages in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
  (ACE2) and permits virus entry. Inhibitors like brilacicin () and antibodies in
  the convalescent plasma () prevent the binding of the virus to its receptor. TMPRSS2
  may help the virus to enter the cell which can be inhibited by RHB-107 () therapy.
  After binding of the virus to its receptor, it enters the endosome. It needs AAK1
  for endocytosis as a regulator (it is inhibited Baricitinib ()). After membrane
  fusion with the endosomal membrane, it releases naked RNA into the cytosol. Inside
  the cytoplasm, it translates its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to replicate
  its RNA and it undertakes gene expression. After the synthesis of protein and viral
  RNA, they accumulate inside the ER and Golgi apparatus. they leave ERGIC by exocytosis.
  it needs cyclophilin A to virion assembly which may be inhibited by Cyclosporine
  A (). Consequently, the new virions are formed and released to infect another cell.
  The endocytosis of the virus is initiated by the engagement of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2
  on the surface of the infected cell through S protein and TMPRSS2. The virus releases
  its genome into the cytosol. Naked RNA is recognized by cytosolic receptors such
  as RIG-1, MDA-5, or NLRP3. RIG-1 and MDA-5 activate IRFs that enter the nucleus.
  Once NLRP3 activated by naked RNA, eventually it causes activation of inflammasome
  which in turn leads to activation of caspase-1 (CA-1), inflammasome is inhibited
  by tranilast () while CA-1 is inhibited by thalidomide (). CA-1 drives the activation
  of IL-1B which is a potent inflammatory cytokine. When dsRNA is formed during RNA
  replication of the virus, the immune response is elicited by activation of TLR-3
  within the endosome, IRF, and NF-Κb which results in the production of inflammatory
  cytokines and interferons (IFNs). IFNs generation has an essential role in releasing
  antiviral proteins to defend healthy cells and it is augmented by interferon therapies
  (). TLR‐4 on the cell membrane surface might recognize PAMP and DAMP of the virus
  and stimulate proinflammatory cytokines via the MyD88‐dependent signaling pathway
  and NF‐κB activation. Melatonin () is believed to prevent these interactions while
  NF‐κB is inactivated by CD24FC () treatment. TLR7/TLR9 is activated upon sensing
  PAMP of SRAS-CoV-2 (i.e ssRNA), similar to the TLR4 signaling system, it can activate
  the MyD88‐dependent signaling pathway and NF‐κB. The other transcriptional activations
  of NF‐κB beside inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are ceramidase and phospholipase
  A2 (PLA2) enzymes. The former catalyzes ceramide in the cell membrane into sphingosine
  which further catabolized by shingokinase (SK) into chemotactic sphingosine 1 phosphate
  (S1P). Inhibitors like Opaganib () can inhibit the SK enzyme, it prevents the formation
  of S1P that egresses the T lymphocyte from the lymph node to the site of inflammation.
  Regarding PLA2, it degrades phospholipid (PL) in the cell membrane to form arachidonic
  acid (AA) that in turn catabolized by cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX2) enzyme into inflammatory
  prostaglandin (PG). PLA2 is inhibited by corticosteroids () and while and COX2 is
  inhibited by NSAIDs () and auranofin (). Interactions of the virus to the cell results
  in the generation large amount of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) and chemokines (IL-8
  and CXCL2) from the infected cell. The former is inhibited by levamisole () to mitigate
  cytokine storm (CS) and acute lung injury that may occur in COVID-19 patients. While
  the chemokines recruit the lymphocyte and leukocyte to the site of inflammation.
