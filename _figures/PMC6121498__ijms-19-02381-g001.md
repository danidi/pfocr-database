caption: Schematic diagram of the effects of carbon monoxide on the cardiovascular
  system. Carbon monoxide (CO) can influence the cardiovascular system through (1)
  the vasodilatory effect, (2) anti-apoptotic activity, and (3) immune-modulation
  mechanisms. The roles of CO in the cardiovascular system may be executed in conjunction
  with other gasotransmitters, such as nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S).
  The possibility of action on the cardiovascular system is represented by the dotted
  line. The upward pointing arrow and the downward pointing arrow mean activation
  and inhibition for each pathway, respectively.
