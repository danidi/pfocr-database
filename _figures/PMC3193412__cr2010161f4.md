caption: The canonical IKK-NFκB pathway. Upon canonical IKK activation, the classical
  IκBs, IκBα, -β, -ɛ, which sequester NFκB to the cytoplasm in a stoichiometric manner,
  are phosphorylated on specific N-terminal residues that function as docking sites
  for the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex SCF/βTRCP. Ubiquitinated IκBα is degraded by
  the 26S proteasome, allowing for translocation of NFκB into the nucleus. Nuclear
  NFκB activity induces the expression of IκBα and IκBɛ, providing for negative feedback.
  Free IκB proteins are rapidly degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner by the
  20S proteasome, presumably in conjunction with alternate proteasome targeting or
  activating proteins.
