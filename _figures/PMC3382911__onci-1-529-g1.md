caption: Figure 1. Proposed role of LRH-1 and glucocorticoid synthesis in tumor immune
  evasion. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells, such as T cells, macrophages (MΦ) and
  dendritic cells (DC), release factors, such as TNFα, which stimulate the activation
  of the transcription factor LRH-1 in colorectal tumor cells. LRH-1 regulates the
  transcription of cyclins, leading to tumor cell proliferation, and steroidogenic
  enzymes (cytochrome P450 enzymes, Cyp), leading to the synthesis of glucocorticoids
  (GC). Glucocorticoids in turn suppress the activation of cytotoxic T cells and innate
  immune cells. LRH-1 can also be activated via the MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway upon
  stimulation of growth factor receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF)
  receptor.
