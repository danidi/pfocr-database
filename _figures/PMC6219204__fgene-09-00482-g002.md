caption: Crosstalk of FGF10 during pancreatic cancer. Interactions of FGF10 with TGF-β
  pathway promote EMT and cancer cell invasion. The positive feedback loops between
  FGF10-SOX9, KRAS/NF-κB-SOX9, and ERBB-SOX9, respectively, are enhanced under inflammatory
  condition, which contributes to PDAC initiation and progression.
