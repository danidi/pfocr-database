caption: Regulation of cellular tension and adhesion by autophagy. (A) Contraction
  of actin stress fibers, which is mediated by myosin II, imposes tension on focal
  adhesions and contributes to their maturation. Binding of the head domains of myosin
  II to actin cross-links actin stress fibers. Phosphorylation of the myosin light
  chain leads to conformational changes in myosin II, which result in contraction
  as actin filaments slide past each other in opposite directions, thereby exerting
  tensional forces on focal adhesions. Phosphorylation of myosin light chain is regulated
  by RhoA GTPase. GTP-bound RhoA activates Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK, of
  which there are two isoforms), which directly phosphorylates myosin light chain.
  Ubiquitylation (Ub) of active RhoA targets it for p62-mediated autophagic degradation;
  degradation of RhoA by autophagy might, therefore, lead to loss of tension and disassembly
  of focal adhesions. (B) Filamin A supports focal adhesion formation by mediating
  the linkage of focal adhesions to actin. In response to tension-induced conformational
  changes of filamin A, BAG3, a co-chaperone of the chaperone-assisted selective autophagy
  (CASA) pathway, recruits an E3-ligase-containing complex to filamin A; this results
  in ubiquitylation of filamin A and binding of p62 for targeting of filamin A for
  autophagic degradation. Autophagy-dependent filamin A degradation might destabilize
  focal adhesions. (C) During cell migration, integrins are endocytosed and recycled
  back to the plasma membrane through either early endosomes, late endosomes or lysosomes,
  or are degraded at the lysosome. Autophagy has also been proposed to specifically
  direct trafficking of integrins to the lysosome for their degradation in order to
  influence cell motility. AP, autophagosome.
