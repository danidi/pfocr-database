caption: Model describing the modulation of MLP quality control at the proteasome
  by BAG6 and SGTA. The heterotrimeric BAG6 complex, composed of Bag6, TRC35 and UBL4A,
  recognises cytosolic MLPs and stimulates their ubiquitylation. It might also contribute
  to substrate delivery to the proteasome following the interaction of the Bag6 subunit
  with Rpn10 (; ). SGTA is recruited to the C-terminal region of Rpn13 through its
  central TPR domain (this study), in concert with MLPs that might bind to SGTA and/or
  the Pru domain of Rpn13, depending on their ubiquitylation status. The proteasome-associated
  deubiquitylase UCH37 also binds Rpn13 (; ; ), providing a potential molecular basis
  for a putative ‘rescue pathway’ that facilitates the deubiquitylation of previously
  modified MLPs (; ). The proximity of the Rpn10 and Rpn13 subunits () is consistent
  with the suggestion that, following delivery to the proteasome, substrates undergo
  cycles of ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation in response to the respective actions
  of the BAG6 complex and SGTA (; ; ; ). The Hsp70 and Hsp90 molecular chaperones
  could also contribute to this hypothetical quality-control process (; ).
