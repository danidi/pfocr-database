caption: Diagram of the neural circuitry underlying delay eyeblink conditioning. The
  cerebellar anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN) and Purkinje cells (Pc) in the cerebellar
  cortex receive convergent input from the conditioned stimulus (CS, green) and unconditioned
  stimulus (US, red) neural pathways. The CS pathway for an auditory CS includes the
  cochlear nuclei (CN), superior olive (not shown), lateral lemniscus (not shown),
  inferior colliculus (IC), medial auditory thalamus (MAT), basilar pontine nuclei
  (PN), mossy fiber (mf) projection to the AIN and cortical granule cells (Gc), and
  the parallel fiber (pf) projections to Purkinje cells. The US pathway includes the
  trigeminal nucleus (TN), dorsal accessory division of the inferior olive (IO), and
  the climbing fiber (cf) projection to the AIN and Pc. The output pathway for performance
  of the conditioned blink response (orange) includes the AIN projection to the red
  nucleus (RN) and its projection to facial motor nucleus (FN) which causes the eyelid
  closure conditioned response (CR). Feedback projections from the AIN to the PN,
  MAT, and IO regulate CS and US input to facilitate acquisition and maintain plasticity
  within the cerebellum. Inhibitory synapses are depicted by a flat ending. All other
  synapses are excitatory.

  description: Diagram of the neural circuitry underlying delay eyeblink conditioning.
    The cerebellar anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN) and Purkinje cells (Pc) in
    the cerebellar cortex receive convergent input from the conditioned stimulus (CS,
    green) and unconditioned stimulus (US, red) neural pathways. The CS pathway for
    an auditory CS includes the cochlear nuclei (CN), superior olive (not shown),
    lateral lemniscus (not shown), inferior colliculus (IC), medial auditory thalamus
    (MAT), basilar pontine nuclei (PN), mossy fiber (mf) projection to the AIN and
    cortical granule cells (Gc), and the parallel fiber (pf) projections to Purkinje
    cells. The US pathway includes the trigeminal nucleus (TN), dorsal accessory division
    of the inferior olive (IO), and the climbing fiber (cf) projection to the AIN
    and Pc. The output pathway for performance of the conditioned blink response (orange)
    includes the AIN projection to the red nucleus (RN) and its projection to facial
    motor nucleus (FN) which causes the eyelid closure conditioned response (CR).
    Feedback projections from the AIN to the PN, MAT, and IO regulate CS and US input
    to facilitate acquisition and maintain plasticity within the cerebellum. Inhibitory
    synapses are depicted by a flat ending. All other synapses are excitatory.
