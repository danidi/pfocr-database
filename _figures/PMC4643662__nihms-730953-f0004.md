caption: Signaling of S100A2, S100A4 and S100A6 in pancreatic-cancer cellsIn pancreatic
  cancer, the expression of S100A2, S100A4 and S100A6 has been shown to be regulated
  by the transcription factor, GLi1, an important downstream element of the sonic
  hedgehog pathway that has been implicated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The
  sonic hedgehog homolog (SHH) protein binds to its receptor, Patched (PTCH1), which
  leads to the release of inhibition of the receptor smothered (SMO) and the translocation
  to the nucleus of the glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) transcription
  factor. GLI1 controls the expression of S100A2, S100A4 and S100A6. These S100 proteins
  can interact with p53 and can also modulate its transcriptional activity. Alternatively,
  S100 proteins can be released in the extracellular media and interact with RAGE
  at the cell surface. RAGE engagement by the S100 proteins can lead to the activation
  of several MAP kinases, resulting in the transcription of NF-κB regulated genes,
  including RAGE.
