caption: Figure 1. Model for interactions between progerin and p53 pathway. This diagram,
  reproduced and enhanced from Jung et al., demonstrates the proposed interactions
  between progerin and p53 in different settings. In normal cells (left), low progerin
  activity permits a normal p53 response pathway. In HGPS cells (middle), high progerin
  expression leads to reduced p53 levels, although evidence exists that p53 can still
  be active in the presence of progerin in this context. Aging may also lead to enhanced
  progerin levels or activity, with similar consequences for p53. The fates of VHL
  and HIF-2a require further exploration. In renal cell carcinomas (right), loss of
  VHL leads to enhanced progerin and HIF-2a levels, both of which inhibit p53 through
  apparently independent pathways.
