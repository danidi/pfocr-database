caption: 'Schematic model of mitochondrial H2O2 activation of cPLA2-sphingomyelinase
  pathway as an adaptive response to provide myelin derived fatty acids as a substrate
  for ketone body generation: The cPLA2-sphingomyelinase pathway is proposed as a
  mechanistic pathway that links an early event, mitochondrial dysfunction and H2O2,
  in the prodromal/preclinical phase of Alzheimer''s with later stage development
  of pathology, white matter degeneration. Our findings demonstrate that an age dependent
  deficit in mitochondrial respiration and a concomitant rise in oxidative stress
  activate an adaptive cPLA2-sphingomyelinase pathway to provide myelin derived fatty
  acids as a substrate for ketone body generation to fuel an energetically compromised
  brain.'
