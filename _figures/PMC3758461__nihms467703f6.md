caption: Model of Plexin C1 in early stages of melanoma progression. (a) Proposed
  model of Plexin C1 signaling in melanoma. Plexin C1 suppresses R-Ras activity, which
  is expected to lower adhesion and migration of melanoma. Proliferation is also lowered,
  through signaling pathways that are Erk1/Erk2 independent. Activation of the PI3-kinase
  pathway, however, abrogates the tumor suppressive effects of Plexin C1, promoting
  cell survival. (b) R-Ras and Plexin C1 show a coordinated increase (R-Ras), and
  decrease (Plexin C1) in expression in nevi and primary melanoma in vivo. Because
  Plexin C1 suppresses R-Ras activity in melanoma and melanocytes, the final effect
  is predicted to be increased R-Ras-dependent downstream phenotypes, including enhanced
  adhesion and migration.
