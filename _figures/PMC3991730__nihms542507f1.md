caption: Multiple stress signals converge on initiation factors and inhibit global
  protein synthesis. Cap-dependent translation initiation requires cap binding, eIF4F
  complex assembly (light grey square), and ternary complex formation (light yellow
  square). Nutrient signalling mTORC1 controls eIF4F complex formation by phosphorylating
  4EBP, which releases eIF4E for cap binding. Nutrient starvation not only inhibits
  the mTORC1 signalling pathway, but also triggers GCN2 kinase activity. GCN2 phosphorylates
  eIF2α that inhibits ternary complex formation. In addition to the GCN2 kinase, other
  kinases integrate many stress conditions by phosphorylating eIF2α, forming an integrated
  stress response targeting translation initiation.
