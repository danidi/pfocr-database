caption: The most abundant effect in the snrk1α1/α2 mutant in a day-night time course
  inducing the LES was a hyperphosphorylation of RPS6 which indicated an activated
  TOR signalling pathway. Typically this pathway is shut down during LES as demonstrated
  in the wild type phosphoproteome during extended night. A proposed model for SnRK1
  regulation of TOR signalling is via interaction and phosphorylation of RAPTOR. Further
  unexpected effects were observed for chloroplastic phosphoproteins and the crosstalk
  of cytosol and mitochondria. For detailed discussion see Results and Discussion.
