caption: Metabolic pathways that generate AcP. (A) The EMP pathway produces pyruvate,
  which is converted to AcCoA. AcCoA can be fermented as acetate via the Pta-AckA
  pathway, through which AcP is made as an intermediate. In E. coli and other bacteria,
  PoxB (pyruvate oxidase) is expressed in stationary phase and directly converts pyruvate
  to acetate. Alternatively, in Streptococcus pneumoniae and other bacteria, SpxB
  (pyruvate oxidase) instead converts pyruvate to AcP. (B) The heterolactic acid pathway
  found in some lactic acid bacteria uses a phosphoketolase (EC 4.1.29) that cleaves
  xylulose-5-phosphate into glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and AcP, which can be converted
  to ethanol or acetate. (C) The Bifidobacterium shunt generates AcP in two separate
  reactions with the bifunctional phosphoketolase XFP.
