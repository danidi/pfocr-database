caption: Homologous mammalian and fungal host-defense pathways that signal through
  prion conversion. In mammals, receptors such as NLRP3 sense pathogen invasion or
  cell damage to rapidly convert its downstream apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  (ASC) into its active prion form, which then leads to cytokine secretion and cell
  death to protect the host. A homologous pathway is present in filamentous fungi,
  where activated NWD2 receptor converts the HET-S/s protein into a prion to induce
  cell death. The fungal NWD2-HET-S/s pathway is remarkably similar to the mammalian
  NLRP3-ASC pathway in both function and domain organization, suggesting that signaling
  through self-perpetuating protein conformations for host defense and cell-fate determination
  is conserved from fungi to mammals.
