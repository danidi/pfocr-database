caption: Schematic figure illustrating the signaling pathway activation with high
  tidal volume mechanical ventilation. Mechanical stretch-induced cytokine production
  and EMT were attenuated with lum−/− mice and pharmacologic inhibition of ERK1/2
  activity by PD98059. EMT = epithelial-mesenchymal transition; VILI = ventilator-induced
  lung injury. See  and  legends for expansion of other abbreviations.
