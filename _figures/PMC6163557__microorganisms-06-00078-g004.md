caption: Feedback Inhibition on Glycan Activation Pathways. The Figure shows the known
  biosynthetic pathways relating to the formation and recycling/salvage of monosaccharides
  found in glycans. The nucleotide sugars are the end products of each pathway and
  are shown in red e.g., UDP-Glc. The individual reactions, which are subject to feedback
  inhibition, are shown with a red arrow, →. The individual monosaccharides found
  in glycan structures, and which are activated to the nucleotide sugars through the
  metabolic pathways, are shown in blue e.g., Glc. The black text and black arrows
  show the intermediate monosaccharides on the pathways and their conversion steps
  in the pathways. Abbreviations are as listed at the end of the paper.
