caption: 'Lipid synthesis pathway in porcine mammary gland. Note: LCFA the enter porcine
  mammary gland, facilitated by transport proteins (mainly CD36), and are converted
  into their activated form LC-acyl-CoA, with the help of ACSL. Cytosolic LC-acyl-CoA
  is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by FABP3 and esterified there
  to glycerol-3-phosphate to produce LPA by GPAM. In the endoplasmic reticulum, PA
  can be hydrolyzed with LPIN to form DAG, which then is acylated to form TAG by DGAT.
  Newly-formed TAG forms cytoplasmic lipid droplets in the ER membrane via incorporation.
  The cytoplasmic lipid droplets are then transported to the apical membrane, and
  eventually released into porcine milk. A series of enzymes are required to facilitate
  this process, of which FASN and ACACA are considered the crucial enzymes of cellular
  fatty acid de novo synthesis. ACACA carboxylates acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA,
  which is further converted by FASN to fatty acids (C ≤ 16). The synthesized fatty
  acids then participate in TAG formation. After the initation of lactation, mRNA
  of enzymes is increased 5-fold or more are shown in light purple; those increasing
  2-fold or more are colored light red, and those expression increase or decrease
  less than 2-fold are shown in light gray. Abbreviations: ACACA, acetyl-CoA carboxylase
