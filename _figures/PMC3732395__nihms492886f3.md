caption: In the replication-dependent pathway the lesion is detected when replication
  forks are blocked by the ICL. The replication fork initially pauses 20–40 nucleotides
  from the ICLs, and then approaches to the ICL, activating the FA pathway. The FA
  core complex ubiquitinates the FANCD2-FANCI complex, a step required for the endonucleases
  to incise the lagging strand on both sides of the ICL and REV1 and Polζ to extend
  the leading strand past the ICL. It is believed that HR and possibly NER then complete
  the process and restore the intact DNA seqeunce.In G0/G1, the ICL can also be recognized
  by an RNA polymerase during transcription or, depending on its structure by the
  NER damage recognition factor XPC-RAD23B. NER proteins are thought to be responsible
  to unhook the ICL initiating repair synthesis and carrying out TLS past the unhooked
  ICL in a manner dependent on ubiquitinated PCNA and a TLS polymerase (probably Rev1
  and Polζ to bypass the lesion in an potentially error-prone manner. Finally, it
  is believed that the NER machinery eliminates the ICL remnant restoring the intact
  DNA.
