caption: ATM activation in response to DNA DSBs. ATM kinase activity increases immediately
  after DSBs occur in DNA following exposure to IR. ATM mediates the early stages
  of the rapid induction of several signaling pathways, which include activation of
  the DNA-DSB pathway, regulation of the cell-cycle checkpoint controls, activation
  of stress responses and maintenance of telomeres. ‘P’ with solid arrows indicates
  reported phosphorylation events; dashed arrows represent possible signaling steps
  and do not imply direct interaction between proteins; ‘C’ indicates sequestering
  in cytoplasm; ‘R’ indicates repair complexes; and ‘T’ indicates a role for the protein
  in telomere metabolism. BRCA1, breast cancer susceptibility gene product 1; c-Abl,
  Abelson protein tyrosine kinase; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CHK, checkpoint kinase;
  FANCD2, Fanconi anaemia protein; JNK, Jun N-terminal protein kinase; MRE11, meiotic
  recombination 11 gene product; MDM2, ‘mouse double minute 2’ (p53-binding protein);
  NBS1, Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 protein (p95); SMC1, ‘structural maintenance
  of chromosome’ 1; RAD50, a radiation-damage-repair-associated protein; TRF1, telomere-repeat-finding
  factor 1; hTERT, human catalytic unit of telomerase; hMOF, the human ortholog of
  the Drosophila MOF gene (males absent on the first); hSSB1, the human ssDNA-binding
  protein 1; KAP1, KRAB-associated protein.
