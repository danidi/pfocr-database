caption: Potential mechanism of ROS-PARP-1-RelA signaling of cytokine gene expression
  in T. cruzi-infected cardiomyocytes. ROS induced by T. cruzi infection elicit nuclear
  DNA damage and PARP-1 activation that then sustains an autocatalytic cycle of mitochondrial
  and intracellular ROS production, PARP-1 activation, and PAR formation. ROS (produced
  in response to T. cruzi infection) and by PARP-1/PAR-dependent mitochondrial alterations
  provide primary and secondary stimuli, respectively, for nuclear translocation of
  NF-κB, NF-κB activation, and cytokine gene expression. PARP-1 activation and enhanced
  PAR modification of p65-associated proteins may also signal optimal transcriptional
  activation of NF-κB-dependent pro-inflammatory gene expression.
