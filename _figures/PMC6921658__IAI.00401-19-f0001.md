caption: Immunological markers predictive or associated with stages of mycobacterial
  infection. Following exposure to mycobacterial pathogens, hosts either may have
  a successful immune response to eliminate the bacteria before an infection is established
  or may progress along the spectrum of disease. When the pathogen remains in the
  host system and is able to persist, the infection remains latent/subclinical. At
  this stage in latent bTB, the IFN-γ and proinflammatory response is also elevated
  and coupled with a decrease in anti-inflammatory IL-10. In paratuberculosis, during
  the subclinical infection stage, there is an increase in a number of proinflammatory
  cytokines. From here, the animal may successfully control the infection and eliminate
  the bacteria (termed resilience) or progress to clinical disease. An early, elevated
  IFN-γ and antibody response is observed in infected sheep that progress down a pathway
  of resilience to disease. During clinical disease, the response is primarily anti-inflammatory,
  with a decrease in key proinflammatory cytokines. A similar response is observed
  in active bTB, where the immune response favors anti-inflammatory cytokines such
  as IL-10 and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β). Elevated IP-10 levels may be
  predictive of animals that will develop active bTB.
