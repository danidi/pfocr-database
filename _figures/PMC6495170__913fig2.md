caption: Ceramide metabolism. Ceramide is the centerpiece of the sphingolipid metabolism
  and can be synthetized by different pathways. The condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA
  initiates the de novo synthesis pathway (blue box). Ceramide can be generated through
  the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the action of SMases (green box) or by hydrolysis
  of other complex sphingolipids (glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide) (yellow
  box). Different SMases have been identified according to their cation dependence
  and pH optima of action. Ceramide can be hydrolyzed to sphingosine and then reacylated
  back to ceramide in the salvage pathway (orange box). Both the de novo synthesis
  and the salvage pathways involve the action of CerS; six different CerSs have been
  described, each of them has preference for specific acyl chain length and, therefore,
  they synthetize a subset of ceramides. Dihydroceramide desaturase (DES); ceramidase
  (CDase); sphingomyelin synthase (SMS); glucosylceramide synthase (GCS); glucosylceramidase
  (GCase); ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT); galactosylceramidase (GalC).
