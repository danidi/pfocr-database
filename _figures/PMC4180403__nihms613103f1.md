caption: 'The human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family consists of four
  members: the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or HER1, as well as HER2, HER3,
  and HER4, which are transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that control cell growth
  survival, differentiation, and migration as well as other cellular responses. Of
  note, HER2 has no known ligand that triggers its activity, and HER3 predominantly
  functions as a ligand-activated dimer partner for other members of the HER2 family.
  Activation of these receptors promotes tumor growth by triggering signaling through
  commonly used growth factor pathways such as RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR.
  The use of targeted therapies to block these pathways is being explored with a view
  to improving HER2 targeted therapies and overcoming resistance to trastuzumab.Legend:
