caption: 'Near-infrared (NIR)-triggered photothermal action in MDA-MB-231 and MCF7
  cell lines: the illustration shows irinotecan hydrochloride (IT) on-demand release
  from irinotecan-loaded biotinylated carbon nanodots (CDs-PEG-BT/IT) by means of
  hyperthermia. The cross-talks among apoptosis, autophagy and necroptosis are showed.
  After internalization, CDs-PEG-BT/IT act as nanoheaters under NIR irradiation promoting
  massive irinotecan release and generating hyperthermia so as to induce cell death.
  The increased expression of several proapoptotic factors, including Tumour Necrosis
  Factor α (TNFα), caspase 3 (CASP3), caspase 7 (CASP7), and caspase 9 (CASP9), acted
  to trigger cell death via apoptosis in MDA-MB-231. Additionally, the simultaneous
  upregulation of autophagic-related genes (ATG12, ATG3, and BECN1) and necroptosis
  marker collaborating network suggests the existence of simultaneous death mechanisms
  reinforcing the antitumor effect. In MCF7 cells with increased apoptotic threshold
  because of the absence of functional CASP3 and downregulation of APAF1, CASP7, and
  CASP9, CDs-PEG-BT/IT promote the upregulation of TNFα/RIPK1-dependent pathway, thus
  overcoming apoptosis resistance through the necroptotic pathway (red arrow).'
