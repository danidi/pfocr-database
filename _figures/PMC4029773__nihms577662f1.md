caption: The JAK-STAT5 signaling pathway is activated by GH, PRL, and GM-CSF, and
  it regulates the development and/or function of preadipocytes, adipocytes, and macrophages
  in adipose tissue. Substantial evidence supports that STAT5 proteins are activated
  in preadipocytes and that they promote adipogenesis. In mature adipocytes, multiple
  STAT5 target genes have been identified, demonstrating a role for STAT5 in modulating
  key physiological properties of adipocytes. Studies also indicate that JAK-STAT5
  signaling is important in the recruitment and development of adipose tissue macrophages.
