caption: The effect of GCN-2 kinase activation on glucotoxicity, cell integrity, and
  the mesothelial to mesenchymal transition in human peritoneal mesothelial cells.
  Under high-glucose conditions, glucose influx into mesothelial cells increases,
  likely due to the upregulation of glucose transporters. The elevated intracellular
  glucose is catabolized through the Krebs cycle and produces more electron donors
  (NADH and FADH2) than the oxidative phosphorylation chain has capacity to transfer
  electrons. The extra electrons convert molecular oxygen to superoxide. ROS inhibits
  the enzyme GAPDH, leading to accumulation of upstream glycolytic products, which
  are diverted to four noxious pathways. The polyol pathway utilizes NADPH, required
  for the reduction of glutathione. The hexosamine pathway results in the O-GlcNAc-modification
  of proteins, altering their function. For instance, the modification of Sp1 increases
  the transcription of the gene for the profibrotic TGF-β1. The lipid synthesis pathway
  produces DAG, an activator of PKC kinase able to activate NF-κB, known for its role
  in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and TGF-β1. Finally, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate is converted to MGO, a precursor of AGEs. All these glucotoxic events
  increase the production of the profibrotic TGF-β1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  such as IL-8, and induce cell apoptosis and the mesothelial to mesenchymal transition—alterations
  involved in the peritoneal membrane pathology observed in PD patients with ultrafiltration
  failure. Activation of GCN-2 kinase by downregulating the expression of glucose
  transporters and glucose influx into the mesothelial cells prevents all of the above
  described glucotoxic pathways, preserves cell integrity, and prevents mesothelial
  to mesenchymal transition.
