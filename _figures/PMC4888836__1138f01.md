caption: Model for the noncanonical HDR pathways at two-ended DSBs. Single-stranded
  annealing (SSA), microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ), and synthesis-dependent
  strand annealing (SDSA) use the same end resection machinery as the GC pathway.
  SSA or MMEJ operates in the absence of 3′ single-stranded tail invasion into a homologous
  template. If the sequences revealed after resection are direct repeats, SSA is favored
  over MMEJ. Repair by SDSA occurs when the 3′ invading strand, after undergoing limited
  DNA synthesis, is displaced from the D loop by a helicase and anneals back to a
  complementary strand. Mammalian proteins required for each pathway are shown; those
  proteins for which direct evidence is currently lacking are followed by a question
  mark. For simplicity, nuclease ERCC1 is shown on only one strand.
