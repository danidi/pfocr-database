caption: 'The potential action mechanisms of Chinese medicines in treating COVID-19.
  Blue arrows: Chinese medicines (CMs) might directly inhibit SRAS-CoV-2 adsorption
  and replication by interfering virus’s binding to ACE2 and 3CL pro. CMs can also
  indirectly protect target organs by inhibiting the binding of SRAS-CoV-2 to ACE2,
  regulating the balance of ACE2 in the body through the Ang / Mas pathway. Red arrows:
  CMs might reduce the production of inflammatory mediators, protect target organs,
  and relieve the deterioration of COVID-19 by anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant
  effects through affecting the Ang / AT1R pathway. Yellow arrows: CMs might play
  an anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory role to prevent cytokine storm. Purple
  arrows: CMs also has an expectorant effect of relieving airway obstruction.'
