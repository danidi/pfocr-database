caption: 'Schematic representation summarizing the integrated effects of PFA-enriched
  diets on intermediary metabolism in the broilers. The PFA reduced hepatic lipogenesis
  (downregulation of ACCα and SCAP), enhanced lipolysis (upregulation of ATGL and
  LIPC), and stimulated muscle protein synthesis via activation of mTOR pathway, which
  in turn resulted in similar body weights despite the decreased feed intake compared
  to the control diet. Abbreviations: ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ATGL, adipose triglyceride
  lipase; LIPC, hepatic triacylglycerol lipase; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin;
  PFA, phytogenic feed additive; RPS6KB1, ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta 1; SCAP,
  sterol regulatory element–binding protein cleavage–activating protein.'

  of intermediary lipid and protein metabolism–related signaling pathways.
