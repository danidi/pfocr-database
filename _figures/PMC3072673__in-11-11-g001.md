caption: miRNA biosynthesis pathway. miRNA are initially transcribed by RNA polymerase
  II as long primary miRNAs (pri-miRNA). Pri-miRNAs are cleaved in the nucleus by
  the RNase III enzyme Drosa-DGCR8 complex, liberating the stem loop or pre-miRNA.
  The protein Exportin-5 escorts the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm, where a second RNAse
  enzyme, Dicer cleves the pre-miRNA to produce a miRNA duplex. From this miRNA/miRNA*
  duplex, the miRNAs strand is loaded iinto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC),
  and the miRNA* strand is destroyed. The final step in miRNA maturation is the loading
  of the miRNA strand into an Argonaute protein and destruction of the miRNA* strand.
  Translational repression of targeted mRNAs or mRNA degradation by RISC may occur
  within the P-body (For the details, see Text).
