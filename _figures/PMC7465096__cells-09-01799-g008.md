caption: 'The “cooperativity model of MIP-1α amplification” in THP-1 monocytic cells.
  A schematic illustration shows that palmitate-TLR4 interaction activates downstream
  signaling via the TRIF/IRF3 pathway for MIP-1α expression. While, TNF-α-TNFR1 interaction
  and TRAF2 engagement activate signaling via the NF-κB and JNK/MAPK pathways and
  lead to MIP-1α expression. Notably, ROS-mediated oxidative stress also leads to
  activation of the NF-κB and JNK/MAPK pathways and MIP-1α expression. Taken together,
  the simultaneous exposure of THP-1 cells to the three agonistic stimuli i.e., palmitate,
  TNF-α and H2O2 likely transduces a strong cooperative signaling cascade (red arrows)
  resulting in the amplified MIP-1α expression. Note: (1) This model highlights the
  novel finding that cooperative MIP-1α expression, unlike MIP-1β expression, does
  not involve the MyD88 signaling pathway (cross sign with dashed arrow); (2) The
  intracellular sources of endogenous ROS are shown by red asterisks that include
  the membrane bound NADPH oxidases, cytoplasmic xanthine oxidases, endoplasmic reticulum,
  mitochondria, and peroxisomes.'
