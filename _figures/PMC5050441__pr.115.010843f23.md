caption: Hormonal pathway. ERα and ERβ are activated by estrogens or phytoestrogens
  that cause dimerization of these receptors and translocation to the nucleus. Activation
  of ERE-responsive genes by ERα increases proliferation yet reduces menopausal symptoms
  and osteoporosis. On the other hand, ERβ decreases proliferation, while also decreasing
  menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis. Additionally, many botanicals reportedly decrease
  aromatase expression/activity to reduce synthesis of estrogen. This figure was simplified
  to represent only the classic estrogen signaling pathway.
