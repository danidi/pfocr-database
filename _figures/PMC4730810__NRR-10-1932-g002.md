caption: 'Model of neuroprotective effects of IFN-β on NPCs: neurotrophic capabilities
  of the neurotensin/NTSR1 pathway.IFN-β treatment exerts both direct and indirect
  effects on NPCs. The direct effect is through the IFNAR receptor and the indirect
  effect is through T cells for specific neurotrophins and neurotensin/NTSR1-mediated
  cross-talk between immune (T cells) and CNS (NPCs) cells. IFN-β plays important
  roles in balancing immunomodulation and neuroprotection through NT/NTSR1 signaling
  as well as other neurotrophin receptors in RRMS. IFNAR: Interferon-α/β receptor;
  IFN-β: interferon beta; NPCs: neural progenitor cells; NT: neurotensin; NTSR1: neurotensin
  high affinity receptor 1.'
