caption: Metabolic pathways to the enantiomers of 1,2-PD from the common precursor
  MG. In our engineered pathway, MG synthase converts DHAP to MG, which is then reduced
  to R-lactaldehyde by glycerol dehydrogenase. A native E. coli enzyme is responsible
  for the reduction of R-lactaldehyde to R-1,2-PD. ∗, possible activity, but not yet
  reported in literature.
