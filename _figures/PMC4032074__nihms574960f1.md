caption: a | Tools for transcriptional control. DNA-binding domains from transcription
  factors (TFs) such as LacI, TetR or GAL4 are fused to protein domains that activate
  or repress transcription in mammalian cells, . These artificial transcription factors
  regulate genes that contain their target-binding sites. Synthetic transcription
  factors based on zinc-fingers (ZFs), transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs),  and
  clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)– can be used
  to target any endogenous genomic region. b | Tools for RNA control. Aptamers can
  bind to proteins or small molecules. Addition of a protein-binding aptamer to an
  intron has been used to control the exclusion of an alternatively spliced exon (Ex2).
  When combined with ribozymes, aptamers can degrade the RNAs in which they reside.
  Similarly, aptamers placed in 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) can regulate translation.
  mRNA translation can also be controlled by placing combinations of sequences complementary
  to endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) in the mRNA 3′ UTR. c | Tools for protein turnover
  regulation. Ligand-induced protein degradation has been achieved by fusing a degradation
  recognition site (degron) to the target protein. In the presence of a ligand, the
  degron is bound by an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Alternatively, a ligand-induced
  degradation (LID) domain can be fused to the protein of interest. The LID domain
  mediates ligand-dependent degradation. This approach can also stabilize the target
  protein, by using a modified degradation domain (DD), the activity of which is blocked
  by a ligand. d | Tools for signalling pathway engineering. Rerouting the signalling
  of cell surface receptors can be achieved by engineering their ligand specificity.
  Intracellular receptor domains have been modified by fusing the intracellular receptor
  domains with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage peptide followed by an
  artificial transcription factor, . In the shown example, the TEV peptide was fused
  to a SRC-homology 2 (SH2) protein signalling domain, which leads to its recruitment
  to the receptor upon activation and subsequent release of the transcription factor.
  Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic T cell receptors that enable the
  retargeting of T cell activity towards cells with the targeted surface antigen.
  Rerouting of intracellular signalling proteins has been achieved by reengineering
  their interaction domain such that it only recognizes an engineered binding partner
  but not the natural occurring counterpart. Alternatively, proteins have been brought
  into close proximity to each other by fusing them to protein dimerization domains,
  which are either constitutively active or induced by small molecules or light, ,
  , . Inteins and split (trans-acting) inteins are proteins that can self-excise and
  ligate the peptides fused to them. e | Tools for genome engineering. Recombinases
  catalyse the recombination of a pair of short target sequences (triangles), which
  are pre-integrated into the genome. Depending on the target sequence configuration,
  DNA elements can be inserted, deleted, inverted or replaced. Nucleases fused to
  DNA-binding factors such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs),  or TALE nucleases (TALENs),
  as well as CRISPR-based systems– have been used to induce a double-strand break
  at any given DNA locus. Upon double-strand break formation, the non-homologous end
  joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination pathway induces a mutation or insertion
  of sequence fragments, respectively. GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; ORF, open
  reading frame; RTK, receptor Tyr kinase.
