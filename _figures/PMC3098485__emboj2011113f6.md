caption: α3β1-mediated stimulation of the Rac/PAK pathway is required for completion
  of the myoepithelial cell contraction/relaxation cycle. The contraction and relaxation
  of myoepithelial cells require MLC phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively.
  The binding of OT to its receptor leads to MLC phosphorylation and myoepithelial
  cell contraction via activation of the phospholipase C/Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)/MLCK
  pathway and the Rho/ROCK signalling pathways. MLCK directly phosphorylates MLC,
  whereas ROCK inhibits MLCP (). The results of our study suggest that the engagement
  of α3β1 integrin leads to the activation of the FAK/Rac/PAK pathway and MLCK inhibition,
  thereby, permitting dephosphorylation of MLC and relaxation. In α3β1 integrin-deficient
  cells, Rac activation is impaired resulting in altered MLCK/MLCP activity balance
  and sustained MLC phosphorylation, preventing the accomplishment of the contraction/relaxation
  cycle.
