caption: Schematic diagram showing the signalling pathway activated by AGE treatment
  in cardiomyocytes. RAGE activation by AGE leads to the elevation of ROS and NO via
  activation of NADPH oxidase and the p38 kinase/NFκB pathway. Elevated ROS and NO
  may interfere with the functions of calcium‐handling proteins, likely in part due
  to S‐nitrosylation.

  by increasing production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide.
