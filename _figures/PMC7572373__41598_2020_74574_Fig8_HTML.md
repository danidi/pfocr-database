caption: Hypothetical targets positioning of BeTS-dm and CiTS-dm along A. flavus secondary
  metabolism. Being ineffective on sclerotia biogenesis while highly inhibitory on
  AF accumulation, BeTS is suggested to intervene down-stream the bifurcation of secondary
  metabolism that divide AFs biosynthetic pathway from sclerotia developmental biogenesis.
  On the contrary, due to the containment effect of CiTS-dm on sclerotia and AF, its
  target could be expected enough up-stream the bifurcation to interfere with their
  production, or immediately after, in correspondence of a metabolic knot shared by
  (and controlling) both processes in A. flavus. Scheme created with Adobe Illustrator
  and Adobe Photoshop CS6.0 (Adobe Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).
