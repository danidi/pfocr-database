caption: Schematic illustration of controlled AQP2 transcription in collecting  duct
  principal cells. By binding to cis elements of the AQP2  promoter cAMP CREB and
  AP-1 (c-Fos/c-Jun) enhance AQP2 transcriptional  activity in response to protein
  kinase A-mediated vasopressin (VP)  stimulation. By binding to the TonE element(s)
  of the AQP2 promoter, TonEBP  positively regulates AQP2 transcription under both
  base-line conditions and in  response to hypertonicity. Positive AQP2 transcriptional
  regulation mediated  by both CREB/AP-1 and TonEBP is repressed after activation
  of the NF-κB  pathway in response to either LPS stimulation, characteristic of inflammatory  diseases,
  or hypertonicity. This event is mediated by p65 release from and  increased p50
  and p52 binding to κB elements of the AQP2 promoter.  Although AQP2 transcriptional
  activity is maintained at low levels under  iso-osmotic conditions in the absence
  or presence of VP, the repressive effect  of NF-κB is superseded by increased TonEBP
  activity after longer periods  of hypertonic stimulation. PKA, protein kinase A.
