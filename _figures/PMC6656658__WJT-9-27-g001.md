caption: 'Six main metabolic pathways relevant for immune cell function. (1) Glycolysis
  is a process that occurs in the cytoplasm and involves conversion of glucose into
  pyruvate, (3) Which can either enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or be transformed
  into lactate and secreted. (2) The pentose phosphate pathway, is parallel to glycolysis
  and generates ribose for nucleotides, amino acids and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate (NADPH), which is important for the synthesis of fatty acids and production
  of lipid ligands. (4) Fatty acid oxidation is a mitochondrial dependent aerobic
  process which consists on breaking down fatty acids into Acetyl-CoA units, generating
  NADH and FADH2, and driving ATP production from the E. (5) Fatty acid synthesis
  is a complex cytoplasmic process that is regulated by Acetyl-CoA, NADPH and fatty
  acid synthases to generate fatty acids. (6) Amino acid metabolism is very diverse,
  also important for cell growth and protein biosynthesis, as a consequence of the
  large number of different amino acids, which can feed different the carbon skeletons
  into pyruvate, acetyl CoA, and the citric acid cycle, which enter the TCA cycle.
