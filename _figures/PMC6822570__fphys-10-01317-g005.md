caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism of BBB damage and endothelial dysfunction.
  Increased activity of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MPP2) from ECM will cause tight
  junctions (TJs) to dissemble. TJ damage will eventually lead to basement membrane
  (BM) degradation and endothelial damage, and hence lead to endothelial dysfunction.
  BBB damage will permit the infiltration of neutrophils, monocytes, and blood components
  into the ECM. Activated neutrophils induce the activation of ROS, proteolytic enzymes,
  and cytokines, thus causing higher leukocyte–ECs adhesion and reduced cBF. Meanwhile,
  activated monocytes will be induced by cytokine and neopterin to cause inflammation
  in the ECs. Increased shear and oxidative stress from the system also will cause
  the activation of blood components and increased production of MPs, reduced TFPI,
  and increased fibrinogen accumulation, finally causing lumen narrowing to further
  reduce cBF. ROS, reactive oxygen species; cBF, cerebral blood flow; MPs, microparticles;
  TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor.
