caption: 'Schematic diagram of TLR4 signaling pathways. MyD88 and TRIF-mediated LPS/TLR4
  downstream signaling pathways leading to gene transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, iNOS and COX-2. The LPS/TLR4 signal transduction pathways are typically
  divided into MyD88-dependent and independent cascades. Following LPS stimulation,
  IRAK1 and IRAK4 are recruited to the MyD88-dependant pathway (A) and interact with
  TRAF6 proteins. TRAF6 recruits TAK1 and TABs which activate the NF-κB and/or MAPK.
  In resting states, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytosol by IKKα and IKKβ. Phosphorylation
  of the IKK complexes by TAK1 results in their proteasomal degradation and liberation
  of NF-κB which subsequently translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus where it
  can induce gene expression. Concurrently, TAK1 activates the MAPK pathway resulting
  in the phosphorylation and AP-1 which translocates to the nucleus and binds to DNA.
  Additionally, the LPS/TLR4 MyD88-independent signaling pathway involves the activation
  of TRIF (B) and signaling to TBK1, IKK and IRF3. This pathway results in interferon-related
  cytokines, and can potentiate NF-κB gene transcription. Ultimately, gene transcription
  leads to the production of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, TNF-β, iNOS and COX-2. Abbreviations:
  LPS, Lipopolysaccharide; TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; MyD88, myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88; IRAK1 and IRAK4, interleukin 1-associated kinases-1 and
  4; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor associated factor 6; TAK1, transforming growth factor-β-activated
  kinase-1; TABs, TAK1-binding proteins; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases;
  IKKα and IKKβ, inhibitory IkB kinases; AP-1, activation of the transcription factor
  activator protein 1; TRIF, TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β;
  TBK1, TANK-binding kinase; IRF3, IKK, and interferon regulatory factor 3; iNOS,
  inducible nitric oxide synthase; COX-2, cyclooxygenase 2.'
