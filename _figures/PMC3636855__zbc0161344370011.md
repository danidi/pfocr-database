caption: The proposed roles of VID28 in the Vid pathway. Vid28p is distributed in
  the Vid vesicle-enriched fraction and interacts with other vesicle proteins including
  Sec28p, Vid24p, and Vid30p. Vid vesicles may exist in two forms. When the VID28
  gene was deleted or mutated, FBPase and Vid24p were in the Vid vesicle fraction,
  but they failed to co-localize with actin patches. These results suggest that small
  vesicles were formed. However, they failed to aggregate. We propose that VID28 is
  required for Vid vesicles to aggregate to form clusters. When clusters cannot form,
  Sec28p, Vid24p, and Vid30p appear in the extracellular fraction. FBPase was in the
  extracellular fraction in both the wild-type cells and the Δvid28 cells, suggesting
  that the presence of FBPase in the extracellular fraction is independent of the
  VID28 gene. Levels of FBPase, Sec28p, Vid24p, and Vid30p in the extracellular fraction
  decreased rapidly in response to glucose. Therefore, VID28 is unlikely to be involved
  in the decline of these proteins in the extracellular fraction.
