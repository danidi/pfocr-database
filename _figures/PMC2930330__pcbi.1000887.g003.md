caption: 'The arrows show the directionality of the reactions. (A) Grey: citrate synthase
  gene currently not identified in iAI549, but the pathway is suggested to be present
  by Tang et al. ; Orange: pathways for which homologous putative genes (∼30% amino
  acid sequence identity) were tentatively identified in Dehalococcoides, but are
  suggested to be absent by Tang et al. ; Red: pathways for which putative genes are
  confirmed to be present by both iAI549 and Tang et al. . In all cases, the TCA-cycle
  of Dehalococcoides is not closed which explains their inability to use acetate as
  an energy source. (B) Dehalococcoides'' requirement of CO2 in addition to acetate
  for their in silico growth. The numbers are flux values in mmol.gDCW−1.h−1. During
  pyruvate synthesis, Dehalococcoides require 67% carbon (molar basis) from acetate
  and 33% (molar basis) from CO2. Thus, Dehalococcoides fix carbon via the pyruvate-ferredoxin
  oxidoreductase or pyruvate synthase (POR) pathway.'
