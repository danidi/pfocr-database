caption: IL-4 augments IL-31/IL-31 RA interaction leading to enhanced Ccl 17 and Ccl
  22 production in BMDCs. IL-4 induces upregulation of IL-31RA expression at the mRNA
  levels ① and the protein levels ②. IL-31RA expression initially upregulated by IL-4
  stimulation can lead upregulation of Ccl 17 and Ccl 22 production at the mRNA levels
  ③ and the protein levels ④, whereas IL-31 stimulation alone without IL-31RA upregulation
  did not upregulate Ccl 17 and Ccl 22 production ⑤. Impairment of STAT6 signaling
  pathway activation by Glyteer ⑥ inhibits upregulation of IL-31RA expression and
  Ccl 17 and Ccl 22 production induced by IL-4 in BMDCs.
