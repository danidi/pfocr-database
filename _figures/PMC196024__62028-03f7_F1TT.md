caption: Model depicting the TAP42/Ser 577-dependent pathway and a partially redundant
  uncharacterized pathway used by TOR to down-regulate GCN2 activity when nitrogen
  is plentiful. Phosphorylation of Ser 577 inhibits the GCN2 protein kinase (PK) domain
  by antagonizing tRNA binding. Treatment with rapamycin inhibits TOR, leading to
  dephosphorylation of Ser 577 by the TAP42-regulated phosphatases SIT4/PP2A. The
  ensuing activation of GCN2 and eIF2α phosphorylation down-regulates general translation
  initiation and induces GCN4 translation. The GCN4 thus produced activates amino
  acid biosynthetic genes and augments the GLN3-dependent activation of genes required
  for catabolism of poor nitrogen sources. Because rapamycin can partially induce
  eIF2α phosphorylation in tap42-11 cells at 25°C even though Ser 577 remains phosphorylated,
  we propose that a redundant pathway exists for TOR-dependent inactivation of GCN2
  that is also inhibited by rapamycin. Starvation for amino acids can lead to activation
  of GCN2 through binding of uncharged tRNA to the HisRS domain even under conditions
  of TOR-dependent Ser 577 phosphorylation.
