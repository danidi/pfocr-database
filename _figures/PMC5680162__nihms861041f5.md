caption: Inhibitory GABAergic neurons (red) maintain tonic control over DA cells (blue)
  in the VTA of the midbrain, preventing their release of DA in the NAc of the ventral
  striatum. Opiates such as morphine inhibit GABAergic neurons, thus preventing the
  release of GABA onto DA neurons. This disinhibition allows DA cells to fire and
  release their contents into the NAc, which relays positive reinforcement. We hypothesize
  that GABAergic neurons also maintain inhibitory control over SP cells (green). When
  morphine inhibits GABAergic neurons, SPergic neurons fire and release their contents
  onto DA cells, acting as a “driver” of DA function.
