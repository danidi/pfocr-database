caption: HHV-8 targets B cell subpopulations for infection. The B cell target for
  HHV-8 infection is unknown. However, evidence suggests that naïve and/or IgM memory
  B cell subsets are susceptible to HHV-8 infection. HHV-8 is endocytosed after binding
  to cell surface entry receptors. The virus then enters latency (left) or initiates
  lytic replication (Rappocciolo et al., ). Latently infected cells drive differentiation
  toward a plasmablast phenotype that is responsive to the proliferative cytokine,
  IL-6. The alternative pathway is the entry of HHV-8 into the lytic cycle to begin
  transcription of lytic-associated proteins in activated B cells (red outline). The
  lytic cycle may stop prior to virion production, resulting in an abortive replicative
  cycle as seen in DC, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. The virus in these cells
  likely enters latency or may result in B cell apoptosis. Some cells, however, will
  support full lytic cycle replication, resulting in lytic protein synthesis, and
  increases in viral DNA that correspond to infectious HHV-8 progeny and subsequent
  release through cell lysis.
