caption: Pathways for H2S production and oxidation. H2S biogenesis catalyzed by the
  trans-sulfuration pathway enzymes, CBS and CSE occurs in the cytoplasm. The AAT/MST
  pathway exists in the cytoplasm and in the mitochondrion. Sulfide is oxidized in
  the mitochondrion by SQR to generate persulfide. In the second step, the persulfide
  is oxidized by ETHE1, a dioxygenase, to generate sulfite that can either be oxidized
  by rhodanese or by sulfite oxidase. Electrons released in the SQR reaction are captured
  by ubiquinone and transferred to the electron transport chain at the level of complex
