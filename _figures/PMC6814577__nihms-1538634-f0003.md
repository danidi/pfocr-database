caption: While the neuroprotective mechanisms of opioid antagonists are not clearly
  understood, the following mechanisms are being considered. A. μ-opioid receptors
  are 7 transmembrane spanning that activate G proteins composed of α, β and γ subunits
  which convert GDP to GTP. When activated, μ-opioid receptors exhibit inhibition
  of Ca2+ influx and activation of K+ channels. Opioid antagonists block μ-opioid
  receptor activation by competitive binding. B. TLR4 signaling pathway is activated
  in microgliosis. As a result, neurotoxic mediators such as TNFα and IL-1β are released.
  Opioid antagonists are suggested to block TLR4 signaling, leading to inhibition
  of pro-inflammatory cytokine production of TNFα and IL-1β. C. NADPH (dihydronicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase is an enzyme complex involved in the induction
  of oxidative stress that consists a membrane bound gp91phox subunit and p22phox
  as well as three cytosolic proteins (p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox). During an ischemic
  stroke, the NADPH complex is activated as and the cytosolic components are translocated
  to plasma membrane to interact with the membrane bound gp91phox subunit and p22phox
  to assemble an active NADPH oxidase enzyme complex stimulating increased superoxide
  O2- generation. Opioid antagonists inhibit enzymatic activity of NADPH oxidase by
  binding to the gp91phox subunit and induce a conformational change of the NADPH
  protein complex affecting the binding affinity of the cytosolic subunits p40phox,
  p47phox, p67phox. As a result, oxidative stress that compromises BBB integrity is
  reduced
