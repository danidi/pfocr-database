caption: E3 ligases involved in  signaling. The schematic of known  components in  signaling
  illustrates that there is regulation of a single substrate (ABI5) by multiple E3
  ligases and a number of different classes of E3s act at multiple levels in the  pathway,
  including biosynthesis and downstream gene regulation. RING-type E3 ligases are
  shown as yellow pentagons, U-box-type E3 ligases as dark orange pentagons,  E3 ligases
  as orange pentagons, and CRL3-based E3 ligases as pink pentagons. AFP is depicted
  is a green square, and COP1 is a gray triangle. Known (or unknown) ligase substrates
  are blue pie wedges.
