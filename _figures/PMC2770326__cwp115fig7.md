caption: SCFA-analog hybrids enhance cellular uptake and endow analogs with novel
  activities. (A) Peracetylated, perpropionylated, and pern-butanoylated analogs are
  taken up by cells with progressively greater efficiency, presumably due to enhanced
  lipophilicity that facilitates transporter-independent cellular uptake (i.e., membrane
  diffusion). (B) Once inside a cell, the SCFA groups, such as acetate, are removed
  by nonspecific esterases regenerating the “core” sugar (C) that – in the case of
  ManNAc – enters the sialic acid pathway en route to surface glycan display (“R1”-modified
  examples of peracetylated analogs are shown in Figure ). (D) Perbutanolylated hexosamines,
  represented by Bu4ManNR1, generate n-butyrate upon esterase processing that can
  modulate transcription through HDACi activity as well as the core sugar that can
  access the sialic acid pathway (C). Along the route to complete SCFA hydrolysis,
  tributanolyated ManNAc isomers elicit dramatically different cellular effects with
  (E) “1,3,4-O-Bu3” analogs supporting high flux with negligible cytotoxicity while
  (F) “3,4,6-O-Bu3” isomers trigger a bevy of NF-κB-associated “off-target” responses.
