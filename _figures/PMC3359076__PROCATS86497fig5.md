caption: Regulation of thrombin-induced RelA/p65 nuclear translocation by the Rho-actin
  pathway. Activation of RhoA/ROCK in endothelial cells after thrombin stimulation
  of PAR-1 leads to two signaling events; one involves activation of IKK, and the
  other causes phosphorylation and thereby inactivation of cofilin-1, an actin-binding
  protein that promotes actin depolymerization. Activated IKK catalyzes phosphorylation
  and thereby degradation of IκBα to mediate the release of RelA/p65. Inactivation
  of cofilin results in dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These events
  mediate the interaction of the released RelA/p65 with actin, and this interaction
  in turn promotes, by an undetermined mechanism, the nuclear import of RelA/p65.
  The nuclear RelA/p65 binds to the promoter and induces the expression of target
  genes such as ICAM-1.
