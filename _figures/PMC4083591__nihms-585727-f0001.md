caption: Numerous polymorphisms in genes encoding regulators of nucleic acid degradation
  or mediators of pathways involved in induction of or response to IFN-I, along with
  environmental factors that lead to cellular stress or oxidative damage, generate
  a host endowed with enhanced capacity to activate the IFN-I pathway. A favored view
  is that stimulatory endogenous nucleic acids activate cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensors
  and induce IFN-I, possibly enriched in IFN-β, although an exogenous viral trigger
  remains possible. A recent study suggests that this early event might occur in nonhematopoietic
  cells (). The resulting IFN-I will prime an adaptive immune response, and in a host
  enriched in gene variants that lower the threshold for lymphocyte activation, a
  self-reactive immune response may be favored. When autoantibodies target nucleic
  acids or nucleic acid-binding proteins, immune complexes form and strongly amplify
  IFN-I production, predominantly IFN-α, through Fc receptor-dependent activation
  of pDCs mediated by endosomal TLRs. The adjuvant activity of the immune complex
  also amplifies the autoimmune response to the associated nucleic acid-binding proteins.
  Neutrophils can respond to exposure to IFN-I and immune complexes with extrusion
  of nucleic acids and associated proteins, in the form of mitochondria or neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NETs), produce IFN-I and contribute to disease flares. Neutrophils
  and pDCs can each amplify production of IFN-I by the other cell type, modify function
  of adaptive immune system cells and amplify autoimmunity. The immunologic consequences
  of this sustained viral-like response result in broad immune dysregulation, inflammation
  and tissue damage.
