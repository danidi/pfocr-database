caption: Figure describes the various roles of IL-15 in CD immunopathogenesis. Gliadin
  on entering the lamina propria activates dendritic cells to secrete IL-15. (1) IL-15
  acts on IELs on the epithelium to upregulate NKG2D and NKG2C receptors which interact
  with MICA and HLA-E ligands respectively on the epithelial cells and release perforins,
  granzymes, etc. that produce cell damage and villous atrophy. (2) IL-15 acts on
  Th1 cells to inhibit the release of regulatory T cells (Treg) and prevents development
  of oral tolerance to gluten. (3) IL-15 also activates the anti apoptotic pathway
  in IELs through JAK3 STAT5 and Bcl-xl which initiates their aberrant differentiation
  and proliferation that plays a role in development of refractory CD (RCD).
