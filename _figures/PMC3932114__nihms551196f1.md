caption: Mitochondrial ROS. The mitochondrial matrix contains the components of the
  TCA cycle and the β-oxidative pathway, which provide reduced NADH and FADH2 to the
  electron transport chain, leading to generation of a proton gradient across the
  inner mitochondrial membrane. Under high-glucose conditions, pyruvate is shuttled
  to the mitochondria, where it is oxidized by the TCA cycle to produce 4 molecules
  of NADH and 1 molecule of FADH2.
