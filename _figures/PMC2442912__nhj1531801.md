caption: The contribution of If to sinoatrial (SA) node action potentials and        autonomic
  modulation of heart rate. (A) Action potentials in the SA node        at baseline,
  and afterβ-adrenergic stimulation. The process        of slow diastolic depolarisation
  is mainly initiated by If, which is        activated upon hyperpolarisation. HCN
  channels are the proteins        underlying this current. When the threshold is
  reached, the action        potential starts as a result of the opening of T-type
  and L-type calcium        channels. Repolarisation occurs mainly due to the opening
  of        K+currents. (B) Illustration of an SA node cell and its        intracellular
  cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling pathway.        Alterations in
  cAMP result in regulation of HCN channel activity.         β1-adrenergic receptor
  stimulation increases        cAMP levels, as a result of G-protein coupled regulation
  of adenylyl        cyclase (AC) activity, whereas the opposite is a result of        M2-muscarinic
  receptor stimulation. Cyclic AMP binds to HCN        channels near the amino terminus
  and it accelerates activation kinetics.        (From Biel et al. with permission).
