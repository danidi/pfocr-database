caption: The DOXP/MEP pathway, present in higher plants, green algae, some bacteria,
  Plasmodium spp. and yeast as well as the Mevalonate pathway, present in mammals,
  higher plants, some bacteria, trypanosomatids, and yeast, generate isopentenyl diphosphate
  (IPP), which isomerizes to dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). The farnesyl diphosphate
  synthase (FPPS) catalizes the reaction of DMAPP with IPP to generate geranyl diphosphate
  (GPP), which incorporates another IPP to generate farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). FPP
  is the precursor for ubiquinones, heme a, sterols, dolichols and geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate (GGPP) through the action of GGPP synthase. Bisphosphonates (BP) inhibit
  the short chain prenyl transferases (FPPS and GGPPS).
