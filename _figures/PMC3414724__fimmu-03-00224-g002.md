caption: Role of the PI3K pathway in B cell antigen presentation functions. The Figure
  outlines the D3 phosphoinositides and PI-dependant signaling complexes implicated
  in cytoskeletal reorganization associated with B cell Ag uptake and presentation.
  The involvement of different components in different steps of Ag presentation is
  discussed in the text.
