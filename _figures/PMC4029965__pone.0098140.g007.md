caption: 'The left box lists the miRNAs in the CoMi pattern that was identified as
  a predictive marker. The right box lists the 12 metagenes identified in the study
  by Juul N, et al  on the Paclitaxel resistant pathway. We predicted that some elements
  of the CoMi pattern (e.g. hsa-miR-548b-3p on the GO Term: “Oxidation reduction”)
  have a repressive effect on some of the metagenes (e.g. GBA3, COL4A3BP and PGR)
  as shown by the three arrows from the miRNA to its target genes.'
