caption: Proposed model illustrating the relationship between HJV and HFE in regulating
  hepcidin expression in response to an acute increase in serum iron levels. Elevated
  serum iron triggers the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8, which then binds to Smad4.
  The P-Smad1/5/8-Smad4 complex then translocates to the nucleus, where it drives
  the expression of hepcidin (via the Hamp1 gene). HFE and TFR2 can sense an increase
  serum iron and transduce a signal that, ultimately, leads to the phosphorylation
  of Smad1/5/8. Our results suggest that HJV predominantly controls the phosphorylation
  of Smad1/5/8, and HFE activity is dependent on HJV. In our mouse models of hereditary
  hemochromatosis (i.e., the Hfe−/−, Hjv−/−, and Hjv−/−Hfe−/− mice), HFE deletion
  partially reduces P-Smad1/5/8 levels and hepcidin expression on stimulation with
  holotransferrin; in contrast, deleting HJV blocks this pathway completely. Moreover,
  crosstalk between the Erk/MAPK and Bmp/Smad pathways was previously believed to
  be necessary for holotransferrin-induced hepcidin expression (dashed arrows).
