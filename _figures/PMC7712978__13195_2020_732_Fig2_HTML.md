caption: The p53-Aβ feedback loop revisited. The p53 protein inhibits the amyloid
  cascade by repressing the transcription of BACE1. Additionally, p53 inhibits the
  mTOR signaling pathway, resulting in Aβ protein clearance through the induction
  of autophagy. However, Aβ peptides may prevent these neuroprotective p53 effects
  through posttranscriptional repression of p53, which leads to reduced binding of
  p53 to the promotor of the anti-aging gene, SIRT6. Aβ, amyloid beta; AICD, amyloid
  precursor protein intracellular domain; APP, amyloid precursor protein; BACE1, beta-site
  APP-cleaving enzyme 1; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; sAPPβ, soluble amyloid
  precursor protein beta; SIRT6, sirtuin-6
