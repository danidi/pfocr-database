caption: The role of SIK during TGFβ signaling. Shown is a graphic presentation of
  the TGFβ receptor-Smad pathway leading to transcriptional induction of the SIK gene
  in the nucleus and formation of a protein complex involving SIK, Smad7, Smurf2,
  and TβRI/ALK5. The hetero-tetrameric TβRII/TβRI receptor complex is shown bound
  to extracellular TGFβ. A circled P indicates established phosphorylation events.
  The individual Smad2 and Smad3 proteins are shown as a single Smad2/3 molecule for
  simplicity. On the DNA double helix, the promoter and enhancer sequences are indicated
  with distinct coloration, the promoter is shown occupied by the RNA polymerase II
  (Pol II), and the TSS of the gene is illustrated as a green arrow pointing in the
  direction of transcription.
