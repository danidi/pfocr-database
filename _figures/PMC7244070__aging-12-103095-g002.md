caption: Molecular mechanisms of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). Metformin
  (1) inhibits mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I, reducing Krebs cycle flux
  and shifting metabolism toward glycolysis, increasing the pyruvate level; (2) partly
  inhibits gluconeogenesis through the AMPK pathway, further contributing to pyruvate
  accumulation and increasing the conversion of accumulated pyruvate to lactate; and
  (3) inhibits mGPD, blocking the G3P pathway and altering the cytoplasmic redox state,
  inhibiting the conversion of lactate to pyruvate, resulting in MALA. (AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; LKB1, liver kinase B1; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate; mGPD, mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase; cGPD, cytosolic glycerophosphate
  dehydrogenase).
