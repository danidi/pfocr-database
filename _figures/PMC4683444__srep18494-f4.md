caption: (A) Drugs (left in green) that act over the different circuits defined by
  the receptor (in red) and effector (in blue) proteins, respectively. Cell functionalities
  triggered by the circuits are labeled in pale yellow. The circuits not affected
  by any of the drugs are dimmed in gray. (B) Specific circuits over which the Paclitaxel
  drug acts in both Blood and Lung cancer cell lines. The circuits affected trigger
  survival and apoptosis.
