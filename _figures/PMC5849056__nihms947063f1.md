caption: Classical pathway of complement activation initiates with antibody binding
  and recognition by the C1q/r/s complex to cleave C2 and C4 to form a C3 convertase
  (C2aC4b; blue box). Lectin pathway of complement activation initiates with Mannose
  Binding Lectin (MBL) recognition of lectins on the cell surface and subsequent activation
  of MASP-1 and MASP-2. The MBL/MASP-1/-2 complex also activates C2 and C4 forming
  the same C3 convertase as the classical pathway. The alternative pathway is initiated
  by multiple substances including negatively charged surfaces, pattern recognition
  molecules such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 to
  form C3(H2O). The alternative pathway C3 convertase forms when Factor D cleaves
  Factor B bound C3b to form C3bBb. Both C3 convertases cleave C3 to form C3b and
  release anaphylatoxin C3a. C3b may also initiate the alternative pathway leading
  to amplification of the complement response (dashed line). C3b is added to each
  convertase forming the C5 convertase. C5 convertases cleave C5 to C5b to initiate
  the common terminal pathway resulting in C5b-9 assembling as the membrane attack
  complex pore in the cell surface and resultant cell lysis. The intracellular pathway
  includes Cathepsin cleavage of C3 or C5 allowing C3a or C5a, respectively to bind
  appropriate receptors either on intracellular or extracellular membranes. Regulators
  indicated in red include classical initiation inhibitors, C1INH which inhibits the
  formation of both C1q/r/s and MBL/MASP-1/-2 and the C4b Binding Protein (C4BP) which
  inhibits C4 cleavage. The classical C3 convertase is inhibited by multiple proteins
  including CD55 (Decay accelerating factor, DAF), CD46 (Membrane Cofactor of Proteolysis,
  MCP), CR1 (Complement receptor 1), Crry (Complement receptor 1 related protein Y,
  rodents only). The alternative C3 convertase inhibitors include Factor H, CD55,
  CR1 and Crry. CD46, Factor H, CR1 and CRRY induce Factor I activity to degrade C3b
  and C4b. CD59 (Protectin) inhibits C5b-9 formation. Therapeutic compounds used in
  either animal or human studies are indicated in Red boxes. These agents inhibit
  C3 convertase activity (sCR1, Crry), bind C5 (Eculizumab or anti-C5) or antagonize
  the C3aR or C5aR1 (C3aRa or C5aRa)
