caption: 'Physiology of the VHL-HIF pathway along with proposed etiopathogenesis that
  leads to metastatic ccRCC. In normoxia, HIFα hydroxylation is carried out by PHDs
  that requires iron, ascorbate and 2-oxoglutarate. PHD proteins use oxygen to add
  hydroxyl group on one of two conserved proline residues in the Oxygen Degradation
  Domain of the α-subunit of the HIFα molecule in order to mark it for recognition
  by pVHL. pVHL then recognizes hydroxylated HIFα, ubiquitinylates it and targets
  it for proteasomal degradation. However, in hypoxia, hydroxylation step by PHDs
  does not happen, resulting in HIFα stabilization. HIFα accumulates in the cytoplasm,
  forms complex with constitutionally expressed HIFβ, and eventually translocates
  into the nucleus where is binds to HREs, thereby activating hundreds of genes related
  to adaptation to a low oxygen environment. (I) Loss of VHL activity; (II) Constitutively
  active HIF pathway: When the VHL is mutated, pVHL is non-functional, resulting in
  stabilization of HIFα, and downstream overexpression of numerous genes involved
  in angiogenesis (e.g., VEGFA), proliferation (e.g., EGFR), cell migration and invasion
  (e.g., CXCR4), metabolic shift towards glycolysis (e.g., GLUT1), survival (e.g.,
  survivin), erythropoiesis (e.g., EPO), which ultimately contribute to ccRCC tumorigenesis;
  (III) Interaction of the HIF pathway with other pathways: While HIF pathway interacts
  with and enhances the activity of other oncogenic pathways, it may also contribute
  to the genome-wide epigenetic alterations; (IV) Genome-wide epigenetic alterations:
  The epigenome patterns, established also due to mutations of multiple TSGs involved
  in epigenetic modifications, alter various oncogenic, apoptotic, cell cycle regulatory
  and mismatch repair pathways; and (V) Immune evasion: Lastly, immune evasion occurs
  in ccRCC which is suggested to be partially enhanced by genome-wide epigenetic alterations.
  All these interactions and mechanisms interplay throughout the pathogenesis and
  carcinogenesis of the metastatic ccRCC []. Abbreviations: VHL, von Hippel Lindau;
