caption: 'Schematic representation of various processes during seed filling stage
  in both monocot (top left) as well as dicot (top right) plants. The import and metabolism
  of sucrose is depicted in the figure. Sucrose enters the seed coat via the chalazal
  vein. During the pre-storage phase, sucrose is degraded through the catalytic action
  of cell-wall bound invertase, when the invertase activity is high leading to high
  ratio of hexoses to sucrose promoting growth via cell division. During storage phase
  of development, the invertase activity is low, so sucrose is taken up directly by
  the cotyledons. A low ratio of hexoses: sucrose promotes differentiation and storage
  product synthesis. Sucrose metabolism in the cotyledons is catalyzed by a cycle
  of synthesis and breakdown via sucrose-phosphate synthase and sucrose synthase.
  The figure also explains the translocation of sucrose and other nutrients from source
  (endosperm/cotyledon) to sink (embryo) during developmental stages of seed. Carbon,
  nitrogen, phosphorus, and other minerals, produced from the hydrolysis of stored
  nutrients in endosperm/cotyledon are transported to the embryo for its growth, and
  mobilized toward assimilate-transport pathway into developing seeds, and toward
  the starch and sucrose synthesis pathway. C, Carbon; N, nitrogen; P, phosphorus;
  K, potassium; SUT, sucrose transporter; AAP, amino acids protein; PEPC, AK, PEP
  carboxylase and/or aspartate kinase; AGP, ADP glucose pyro-phosphorylase; GPT, plastidic
  glucose-6-P translocator; pPGM, plastidic phospho-glucomutase; FAT, fatty acid transporter.
  Stresses such as drought and heat may affect the seed filling by influencing any
  of these or multiple processes to accelerate (as in heat) or disrupt (as in heat,
  drought) the seed filling.'
