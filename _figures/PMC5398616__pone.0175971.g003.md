caption: The network was constructed based on 16 candidate genes identified in current
  study by using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. The IPA score was set
  at 34 for relating to cell cycle, connective tissue development and function, developmental
  disorder. The 16 candidate genes from current study were marked into grey, while
  the 18 white nodes are relevant transcription factors identified by IPA algorithm.
  Solid and dashed lines indicated direct interaction and indirect interaction, respectively.
  Genes are presented as nodes and their relationship are presented as edges. The
  functions of genes are illustrated by the shape of the node. The types of the relationship
  are illustrated by the ending shapes of the edges.
