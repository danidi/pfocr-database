caption: Vanillin and vanillic acid are the monomers generated from the enzymatic
  cleavage of some of the major linkages present in lignin. Vanillin and vanillic
  acid undergo further chemical transformation through a linear set of reactions before
  cleaving into pyruvate and oxaloacetate. Pyruvate and oxaloacetate then enter the
  central metabolic pathway of SYK-6 for the generation of its cellular building blocks
  and energy. SW, softwood.
