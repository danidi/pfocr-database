caption: A | Expression of the viral proteins during hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dengue
  virus (DENV) infection recruits immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP),
  resulting in depletion of BiP from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress sensors
  cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor ATF6-α (ATF6), serine/threonine-protein
  kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1 and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-α kinase
  3 (PERK). Aa | These BiP-less sensors become activated to induce the unfolded protein
  response (UPR) pathway. HCV and DENV have developed strategies to manipulate UPR
  pathways to promote virus replication (see main text for details). B | Manipulation
  of the cellular degradation pathways. Ba | HCV, DENV and Zika virus (ZIKV) infection
  induce proteasome-mediated degradation of innate signalling proteins to dampen the
  antiviral immune response. Bb | Viral infection triggers autophagy and alters the
  autophagy flux. Bc | For instance, established DENV infection suppresses the autophagic
  flux, blocking the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. Bd | HCV non-structural
  proten 4B (NS4B) interacts with autophagy protein 5 (ATG5) and recruits the autophagosome
  membrane elongation complex (ATG5–ATG12–ATG16L1) to the membranous web, contributing
  to its formation. Be | In addition to general autophagy, selective autophagic pathways
  are hijacked during Flaviviridae infection (see main text for details). C | Subversion
  of lipid homeostasis. Ca | DENV serine protease NS3 recruits fatty acid synthase
  (FASN) to replication compartments to stimulate lipid biosynthesis. De novo synthesized
  fatty acids are incorporated into replication organelles (ROs). 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  reductase (HMGCR) is recruited to DENV ROs, where it colocalizes with NS4A. Inactivation
  of the protein kinase 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) during DENV infection
  enhances HMGCR enzymatic activity, which results in higher cholesterol levels within
  ROs. Cb | During HCV infection, both viral proteins and regulatory elements within
  the 3′ UTR of the viral genome activate the transcription of lipogenic genes through
  sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-mediated pathways (see main text
  for details). Cc | HCV NS5A and NS5B recruit and stimulate phosphatidylinositol
  4-kinase-α (PI4KA) activity, thus increasing the local concentration of phosphatidylinositol-4-
  phosphate (PtdIns4P). Lipid transfer proteins such as oxysterol-binding protein
  1 (OSBP) bind to PtdIns4P-rich membranes and release cholesterol in exchange for
  PtdIns4P. ATF4, cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor ATF-4; ATG12, ubiquitin-like
  protein ATG12; ATG16L1, autophagy-related protein 16-like 1; CBP, CREB-binding protein;
  DDX3X, ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX3X; eIF2α, eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 2 subunit 1; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; FAM134B, reticulophagy regulator
  1; IKKα, inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB kinase subunit-α; LC3, microtubule-associated
  proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (also known as MAP1LC3B); p300, histone acetyltransferase
  p300; STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1; STAT2, signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 2; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription
  3; XBP1, X-box-binding protein 1.
