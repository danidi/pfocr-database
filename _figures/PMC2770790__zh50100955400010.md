caption: Schematic representation of the proposed mechanism of induction of proasthmatic
  changes in ASM responsiveness following prolonged homologous β2AR desensitization.
  During early β2AR signaling initiated by ASM exposure to a β2AR agonist (e.g., salmeterol
  or isoproterenol), activation of PKA leads to acute uncoupling of the phosphorylated
  β2AR from Gs protein (, ) and activation of Gi-βγ signaling, a phenomenon that may
  be reflective of PKA-induced switching of β2AR coupling from Gs to Gi (, ). Activation
  of the Gi-βγ-subunit then initiates Src-mediated stimulation of the Ras/Raf1/MEK1/2
  signaling pathway, resulting in downstream ERK1/2 activation which, in turn, leads
  to phosphorylation of the transcription factors CREB and ATF1 and their induction
  of CRE-driven PDE4D5 gene transcription. The latter induction of PDE4 expression
  and action results in homologous β2AR desensitization (i.e., late β2AR hyporesponsiveness)
  that is evidenced by attenuated cAMP accumulation in response to subsequent β2AR
  agonist exposure, which is associated with impaired ASM relaxation and heightened
  ASM contractility (). The inhibitors used herein to identify the above signaling
  pathways are indicated within the boxes shown. It is important to note that this
  schematic representation of the proposed mechanism underlying prolonged homologous
  β2AR desensitization in ASM does not depict the reported acute interactions between
  PKA and PDE4 activity and between ERK and PDE4 activity and its acute feedback modulation
  by PKA activation that have been implicated in other cell types (). AC, adenylyl
  cyclase.
