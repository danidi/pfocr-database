caption: 'Schema for the PACAP feed-forward loop: a driver of gonadotropin-subunit
  gene expression in the fetal and newborn pituitary. PACAP is proposed to up-regulate
  is own expression level in gonadotrophs and folliculostellate cells through PAC1-R-activated
  cAMP/MAPK signaling. In the fetal pituitary, the high level of PACAP expression
  stimulates follistatin, which limits activin signaling resulting in low expression
  levels of GnRH-R and FSH-β. At the time of birth, the production of hypothalamic
  dopamine increases, which inhibits cAMP production and interrupts the PACAP-signaling
  pathway. PACAP levels decline, follistatin decreases, and GnRH-R and FSH-β mRNAs
  rise. Increased GnRH signaling may also contribute to the termination of the PACAP
  feed-forward loop. Results for brain dopamine are redrawn from Hooghe-Peters et
  al ().'
