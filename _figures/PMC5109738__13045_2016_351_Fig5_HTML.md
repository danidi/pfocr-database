caption: 'Proposed novel caspase-1 working models. a Experimentally identified substrates

  nuclear inflammasomes and caspase-1 cleaves its substrates in exocytotic secretory
  pathways including exosomes to propagate inflammation to neighboring and remote
  cells. A-CASP1: activated caspase-1. ① The release of extracellular vesicles (Evs)
  as a mode of intercellular communication. ② Caspase-1 by inflammasome complexes
  is directly linked to exosomes and microvesicles (EMVs) that acts as a transport
  vehicle in this pathway. ③ Exosomes and microvesicles (EMVs) can transmit signals
  and molecules to neighboring cells via a non-viral pathway of intercellular vesicle
  traffic. ④ Breast cancer cells induce pro-inflammatory activity of distant macrophages
  through circulating exosomal vesicles secreted during cancer progression—so-called
  cancer propagation. b Novel model of extracellular trafficking of caspase-1 and
  inflammasome components propagate inflammation to neighboring and remote cells'
