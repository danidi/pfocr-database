caption: Working model for functions of HO-2.(A) The binding of HO-2 to the N-terminal
  myristate of HIV-1 Gag traps the myristate moiety and prevents it from inserting
  into the membrane in its proper conformation, and thus inhibits HIV-1 virion production.(B)
  HO-2 binds to the N-terminal myristate moiety and downregulates the function of
  TRAM. HO-2 is induced by LPS-TLR4 signaling and acts as a negative feedback regulator
  of the LPSTLR4 pathway.
