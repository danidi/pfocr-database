caption: Schematic representation of Ire1 signaling. Binding immunoglobulin protein
  (BiP) binds Ire1 luminal domain and maintains it in a monomeric inactive form. In
  stressed cells, BiP is recruited to misfolded proteins and Ire1 is activated following
  conformational changes induced by dimerization of monomers in the plane of the membrane
  and trans-autophosphorylation. Higher order oligomers, which might form upon additional
  stress stimuli, reinforce Ire1 RNase activity. Activated Ire1 mediates the splicing
  of Xbp1 mRNA in higher eukaryotes (or Hac1 in yeast). Splicing of the intron from
  the Xbp1 transcript results in a frame-shift and the production of a potent transcription
  factor, Xbp1-spliced, that regulates many UPR target genes to promote protein folding
  in the ER lumen, ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of misfolded proteins and ER biogenesis.
  Ire1 can also act by alternative pathways; phosphorylated Ire1 associates with TRAF2
  and activates the JNK pathway via ASK1. In the regulated Ire1 dependent decay (RIDD)
  pathway, Ire1 degrades mRNAs localized to the ER membrane through its RNase activity
  leading to a reduction in the amount of proteins imported into the ER lumen.
