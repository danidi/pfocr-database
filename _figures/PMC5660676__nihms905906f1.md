caption: Model representation of a rat proximal convoluted tubule cell and the adjacent
  paracellular pathway. The transporters involved in regulatory volume decrease (RVD)
  and increase (RVI) are respectively shown in dark and light grey. The lateral membrane
  expresses the same transporters as the basal membrane.
