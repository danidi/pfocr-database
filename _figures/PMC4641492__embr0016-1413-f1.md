caption: (A) Upon DSB formation, the transient recruitment of hnRNPUL1 into a PAR-seeded
  protein assembly facilitates early sorting of repair factors. Sharma et al  show
  that these early pathway decisions are modulated by DDSR1, which sequesters the
  anti-recombinogenic BRCA1/RAP80 complex away for DSBs. (B) Later during the DDR,
  the ATM–NF-κB signaling axis stimulates DDSR1 transcription to reinforce its role
  in mediating repair pathway choice and to balance p53 target gene expression. (C)
  Through enhanced sequestration of the BRCA1/RAP80 complex, the increased levels
  of DDSR1 foster DSB repair by HR. The abundant DDSR1 also binds hnRNPUL1, which
  may facilitate the transition from early to advanced stages of the DDR.
