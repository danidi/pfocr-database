caption: 'Metabolic pathway model showing feed routes leading into the methylmalonyl-CoA
  pool when S. erythraea wild-type, FL2267, and MCM duplication strain, FL2385, are
  grown in an oil-based medium or a carbohydrate-based medium. Top row, oil-based
  medium: a boost in the carbon flow from succinyl-CoA (metabolite S) to mmCoA (metabolite
  M) due to a duplication of the MCM operon is shown as a thick gray arrow in FL2385
  compared to FL2267. This increase in flow into the mmCoA pool is the explanation
  currently favored for the increase in erythromycin production seen in FL2385. Other
  metabolites: x, unknown metabolite connected to the mmCoA pool via an unknown enzyme
  activity; y, z, additional metabolites connected to the mmCoA pool. Bottom row,
  carboyhydrate-based medium: a boost in carbon flow from mmCoA to succinyl-CoA is
  shown due to the duplication of the the MCM operon. Also shown is a boost in carbon
  flow from two feeder pathways involving metabolites, “y” and “z”, into the mmCoA
  pool due to postulated regulatory effects of mutR. The postulated increased carbon
  flow into the mmCoA pool from the two feeder pathways in strain FL2385 more than
  compensates for the loss of carbon via the MCM reaction such that there is an overall
  net gain in carbon flow into the mmCoA pool and therefore a net gain in erythromycin
  production.'
