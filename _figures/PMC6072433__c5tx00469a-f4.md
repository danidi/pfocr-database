caption: APAP-sensitive proteins related to protein synthesis (a). Proteins with cysteine
  SNO/SOH levels changed significantly between APAP treatment and control were used
  to map out the pathway based on manual inspection of UniProt annotations. Proteins
  are represented by their respective gene names. Changes in cysteine oxidations are
  marked with arrows. N – S-nitrosylation, S – S-sulfenylation, ↑ – min. 1.5-fold
  increase in abundance, ↓ – min. 1.5 decrease in abundance. I and G are abbreviations
  of amino acids, isoleucine and glycine respectively. The corresponding data on protein
  expression and SNO/SOH modification levels are provided in ESI Table S1. APAP-sensitive
  proteins from the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway (b). Proteins with
  cysteine SNO/SOH levels changed significantly between APAP treatment and control
  were used to map out the pathway based on manual inspection of UniProt annotations.
  Proteins are represented by their gene names. Changes in cysteine oxidations are
  marked with arrows. N – S-nitrosylation, S – S-sulfenylation, ↑ – min. 1.5-fold
  increase in abundance, ↓ – min. 1.5 decrease in abundance. Alternative routes of
  Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction are marked with dashed arrows. Protein names marked
  with arrows indicate proteins up (↑) or down (↓) regulated under APAP treatment.
  SCF – Skp, cullin, F-box containing complex (multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex);
  Ub – ubiquitination; PAF1C – RNA Polymerase-associated factor 1 complex. The corresponding
  data on protein expression and SNO/SOH modification levels are provided in ESI Table
  S1. .
