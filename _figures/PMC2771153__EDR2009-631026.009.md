caption: Schematic presentation of a model of induction of beta cell apoptosis during
  viral infections. Virus infections result in production of IFN-α and dsRNA. IFN-α
  induces expression of 2′5′AS though the classical IFN-α signal transduction pathway,
  and dsRNA can lead to induction of IFN-α/β and to expression of 2′5′AS via TLR3-mediated
  signaling pathway. In the presence of dsRNA, 2′5′AS is activated. The 2′5′A oligomers
  generated by 2′5′AS stimulate RNaseL-induced apoptosis, which results in subsequent
  beta cell autoimmunity. 2′5′AS can also promote cellular apoptosis via an enzyme
  activity-independent pathway. In genetically predisposed individuals, increased
  insulin gene expression may produce dsRNA-like molecules that contribute to enhancement
  of the activation and induction of 2′5′AS in beta cells.

  description: Schematic presentation of a model of induction of beta cell apoptosis
    during viral infections. Virus infections result in production of IFN-α and dsRNA.
    IFN-α induces expression of 2′5′AS though the classical IFN-α signal transduction
    pathway, and dsRNA can lead to induction of IFN-α/β and to expression of 2′5′AS
    via TLR3-mediated signaling pathway. In the presence of dsRNA, 2′5′AS is activated.
    The 2′5′A oligomers generated by 2′5′AS stimulate RNaseL-induced apoptosis, which
    results in subsequent beta cell autoimmunity. 2′5′AS can also promote cellular
    apoptosis via an enzyme activity-independent pathway. In genetically predisposed
    individuals, increased insulin gene expression may produce dsRNA-like molecules
    that contribute to enhancement of the activation and induction of 2′5′AS in beta
    cells.
