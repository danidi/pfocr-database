caption: HR repairs DSB using the broken strand’s sister chromatid as a template.
  As opposed to NHEJ, HR may restore the complete sequence information for damaged
  genes. However, an excess of HR may lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements. a.)
  Many forms of stress including UV and IR are known to induce A18 hnRNP which exports
  RPA transcripts to the cytoplasm (). Cytoplasmic localization likely induces RPA
  which would facilitate HR. b.) Kuroda’s group has found evidence that hnRNP P2 promotes
  homologous repair in mice through an unknown mechanism. The authors suggest that
  hnRNP P2 may provide an RNA template for HR (). c.) A simplified view of the HR
  pathway details the roles of Rad51 and RPA in preparing the damaged DNA for restoration
  using the sister chromatid as a template ().
