caption: Mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance (GCR) in sepsis. Pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and oxidative stress have shown to interfere with the GC signaling pathway
  at multiple levels. This leads to an inadequate response of the GR to both endogenous
  (cortisol/corticosterone) and exogenous GCs to tolerate collateral damage induced
  by sepsis. Vitamin C has been shown to restore the GR function by reverting the
  effect of oxidative stress on GR's ligand- and DNA-binding capacity. TF-BS, transcription
  factor binding site; GRE, GC-responsive element; NTL, nuclear translocation.
