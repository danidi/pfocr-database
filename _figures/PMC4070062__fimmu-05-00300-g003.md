caption: Cytosolic nucleic acids sensors and autophagy. (A) Autophagy negatively regulates
  type I IFNs production after viral infection. The Atg5–Atg12 conjugates directly
  interact with the CARD domains of RIG-I and IPS-1, inhibiting subsequent RLR signaling
  pathway and type I IFNs production. In another way, autophagy regulates RLR signaling
  by acting as a scavenger of dysfunctional mitochondria as well as mitochondria-associated
  IPS-1. Following dsDNA stimulation, STING is translocated from the ER to the Golgi
  apparatus and assembled with TBK1, which phosphorylates the transcription factor
  IRF3. During this process, Atg9a colocalizes with STING in the Golgi apparatus and
  controls the assembly of STING. (B) During mycobacterial clearance, ubiquitin-mediated
  autophagy targeting M. tuberculosis is shown to be activated by the SITNG-dependent
  cytosolic sensing pathway. Mycobacterial extracellular DNA, which is exposed to
  the host through ESX-1-mediated permeabilization of the phagosomal membrane, is
  recognized by the STING-dependent cytosolic pathway. The ubiquitinated bacterial
  DNA, which binds to the autophagosome-associated protein LC3 via adaptor protein
  p62 and NDP52, is targeted to the selective autophagy pathway. (C) Cytosolic DNA-sensing
  cGAS produces cGAMP, which binds to and activates the adaptor protein STING, thus
  leading to the production of type I IFNs. Direct interaction between cGAS and Beclin-1
  suppresses cGAMP synthesis. Moreover, this interaction activates PI3K III-induced
  autophagy, enhancing the autophagy-mediated degradation of pathogen DNA. cGAMP generated
  by cGAS initially activate STING-dependent type I IFN responses. However, they subsequently
  trigger negative-feedback control of STING activity through phosphorylation of STING
  by serine/threonine ULK1 (ATG1).
