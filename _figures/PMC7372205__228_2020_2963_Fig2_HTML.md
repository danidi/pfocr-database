caption: COVID-19 early stage pharmacologic intervention targeting Sars-CoV-2 cell
  entry through the ACE2/TMPRSS2 pathway. Mechanisms of action of pharmacologic agents
  acting on the ACE2/TMPRSS2 pathway that could prevent Sars-CoV-2 entry to host cell
  are summarized. These agents include (i) directly acting agents such as hrsACE2
  that imitates the soluble human enzyme ACE2; (ii) indirect ACE2 modulators including
  (a) ARBs that potentially block the binding and hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2
  to ACE2-expressing cells, (b) calmodulin antagonists that inhibit CALM-ACE2 interaction
  and increase the release of the ACE2 ectodomain, and (c) SERMs that potentially
  modulate ACE2 expression; (iii) TMPRSS2 inhibitors (camostat mesylate, nafamostat
  mesylate, antiandrogens, and potentially ICS if verified in different studies) that
  inhibit the S-mediated membrane fusion of SARS-CoV-2; and (iv) ADAM-17 enhancers
  (conjugated estrogens, 5-fluorouracil) that activate ADAM-17 and increase the release
  of the sACE2 through ACE2 ectodomain shedding. Upregulation is represented by green.
  Potential up- or down-regulation is represented by orange. Inhibition is represented
  by ⊣. AR, androgen receptor; ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ADAM-17, disintegrin
  metalloproteinase 17; ARBs, angiotensin receptor blockers; CALM, calmodulin; ERs,
  oestrogen receptors; ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; TMPRSS2, transmembrane protease,
  serine 2; SERMs, selective oestrogen receptor modulators; 5-FU, 5-fluorouracil
