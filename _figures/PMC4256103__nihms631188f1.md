caption: A schematic diagram depicting the two independent pathways involved in downregulation
  of Nrg1 protein during hyphal initiation. NRG1 transcriptional downregulation requires
  the activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway, whereas Nrg1 protein degradation requires
  release from farnesol inhibition. The function of genes indicated by white boxes
  is activated, and the function of genes in gray boxes is repressed. Red lines represent
  active regulatory relationships; gray lines represent relationships that are inactive.
