caption: Use of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) inhibitors to ameliorate
  FMRP deficiency. mGluR5 activity in amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor protein (APP) mRNA
  translation is disinhibitory, so blocking mGluR5 is not likely to alter APP translation
  levels. Secretion of secreted α form of the amyloid-β precursor protein (sAPP) may,
  nevertheless, be reduced by reducing mGluR5 stimulation of sAPP secretion in neurons.
  Reduced sAPP secretion provides lower levels of available product of the α-secretase
  pathway, reducing symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS) or autism. Bold arrows indicate
  predominant pathways.
