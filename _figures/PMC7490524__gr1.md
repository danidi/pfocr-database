caption: Alternative splicing rewires Hippo signaling during chronic liver injury
  and HCC. (A) The splicing regulator ESRP2 is important for the maintenance of a
  differentiated adult hepatocyte population via activation of the Hippo pathway.
  When Hippo signaling is active (On), the transcriptional co-regulators YAP and TAZ,
  which promote cell proliferation, are degraded (Off). This pathway is modulated
  during liver injury and recovery via the dynamic regulation of ESRP2 expression.
  Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1α, promote
  down-regulation of Esrp2 in human hepatocytes. The absence or down-regulation of
  Esrp2 leads to altered splicing and hypoactivation of Hippo kinases. This promotes
  the expression of YAP/TAZ target genes, resulting in hepatocyte hyperproliferation
  and hepatomegaly. (B) The gene NF2, which encodes the protein merlin, is a direct
  target of ESRP2, which is implicated in HCC via a mechanism involving the production
  of a tumor-promoting protein variant (Δ2-4Merlin). The Δ2-4Merlin variant up-regulates
  the expression of stem cell transcription factors (stemness genes) such as SOX2.
  Expression of SOX2 and other stemness genes induces MBNL3, a splicing factor that
  is expressed in fetal liver and HCC. A major target of MBNL3 is PXN-AS1, a long
  noncoding RNA that regulates expression of the protein paxillin. Alternative splicing
  of PXN-AS1 promotes the production of the long variant PXN-AS1-L, which stabilizes
  PXN mRNA, leading to increased paxillin expression. Paxillin regulates cell adhesion
  and migration and promotes HCC metastasis.
