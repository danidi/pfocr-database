caption: 'The 2-nt 3’ overhang of the pre-miRNA is recognized by exportin 5: RanGAP
  forming a ternary complex in the nucleus. The ternary complex transports the pre-miRNA
  into the cytoplasm by diffusing through a nuclear pore complex. The hydrolysis of
  GTP to GDP by RanGAP results in a conformational change, releasing pre-miRNA into
  the cytoplasm. The loop region of the pre-miRNA is cleaved off by Dicer: TRBP resulting
  in the 22 nt mature miRNA: miRNA duplex. The miRNA duplex is incorporated into Ago-containing
  miRISC. In the miRISC, the mature miRNA is retained, directing the miRISC to complementary
  sites in the target mRNAs.'
