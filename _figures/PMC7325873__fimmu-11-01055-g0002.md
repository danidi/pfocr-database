caption: 'Graphical representation of DENV life cycle and subversion of the innate
  immune response: The virus enters the host cell through receptor mediated endocytosis
  or antibody dependent enhancement. Once the virus is endocytosed, the viral RNA
  escapes the endosome, followed by RNA translation in ER and replication in cytoplasm.
  Then the newly replicated viral genome is assembled with the C protein to form a
  nucleocapsid which buds into ER to obtain a lipid membrane coated with prM/M and
  E proteins. The virion bunds out of ER as immature virion which is characterized
  by spiky appearance. For further maturation, the virion travel to Golgi apparatus
  where the prM protein is cleaved by the cellular endoprotease furin to form a mature
  virion which exists the cell through secretory pathways and infect new cells. The
  non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) of DENV have
  various evasion mechanisms. These evasion mechanisms include TLR, RIG-I, and MDA5
  signaling cascades disruption, suppression of IFN α/β-mediated antiviral responses,
  MITA/STING cleavage, interference with RNAi response, enhance viral replication
  by autophagy induction, inhibition the cleavage of double-stranded RNA by Dicer
  enzyme, suppression the ISGs, inhibition the upstream and downstream of MAVS pathway,
  STAT1 phosphorylation inhibition, and STAT2 degradation. Finally, the non-structural
  proteins are able to induce platelet activation, aggregation, and apoptosis that
  leads to vascular leakage and thrombocytopenia (Red arrows represent various countermeasures
  that have been developed by dengue to evade and or to hinder antiviral innate immune
  response. The cellular antiviral response against DENV is indicated with black arrows).'
