caption: '(a) An aberrantly reactivated complement-microglial axis promotes neurodegenerative
  phenotypes in the CNS. A hallmark of several neurological disorders is the complement-driven
  polarization of microglia and astrocytes towards proinflammatory phenotypes (A1
  astrocytes) which impair synaptogenesis and compromise neuronal survival, as depicted
  herein and detailed in the text. (b) C1q promotes aging-related inflammation and
  tissue injury. C1q triggers the canonical Wnt pathway, independently of complement
  activation, by binding to the Wnt receptor Frizzled (Fz) and promoting the C1s-dependent
  cleavage of the Wnt coreceptor, LDL receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6). C1q-dependent
  enhancement of Wnt signaling accelerates fibrotic changes and impairs tissue regenerative
  responses (e.g., muscle repair). (c) Factor H promotes subretinal inflammation in
  age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Under steady-state conditions, phagocytic
  cells are constantly eliminated in the subretinal space through a homeostatic mechanism
  involving the interaction of TSP-1 with integrin-associated CD47 on subretinal phagocytes.
  The AMD-associated FH variant (H402) potently inhibits the CD47-driven elimination
  of phagocytes, presumably by binding more effectively to CR3 than the non-risk isoform,
  thereby fueling chronic subretinal inflammation. Abbreviations: RPE, retinal pigmented
  epithelium; BM, Bruch''s membrane; Mφ, macrophage; TSP-1, thrombospondin-1; IAP,
  integrin-associated protein.'
