caption: Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis metabolic pathways for utilization
  of lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) and lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) and their constituent monosaccharides.
  LNT and LNnT translocate through the cell membrane facilitated by ABC transporters.
  Intracellular glycosyl hydrolases process HMO into constituent monosaccharides to
  enter the central fermentative pathway. This pathway involves the characteristic
  fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (F6PPK) activity denoted in blue. Genes encoding
  intracellular metabolic enzymes are depicted next to arrows according to their locus
  tag in the ATCC 15697 genome. Solid arrows are direct conversions with dashed arrows
  depicting the sequential actions of multiple enzymes. Predicted catabolic operations
  that feed into the F6PPK pathway and their corresponding products are denoted as
  purple. Stoichiometric coefficients of secreted metabolites, ATP, and NAD+ produced
  during metabolism are labeled in red. Experimental observations depicted in Figures
  ,  including stoichiometry are incorporated.
