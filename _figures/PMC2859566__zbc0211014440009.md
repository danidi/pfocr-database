caption: When a postmitotic neuron is subjected to cell cycle or cell death stimulation
  (such as in Alzheimer disease), the interaction between Cdk5 and p27 is lost. When
  this happens, p27 is transported into the cytoplasm. At the same time, the two atypical
  NES in the Cdk5 sequence allow its transport to the cytoplasm by the CRM-1 pathway.
  The reduction in nuclear Cdk5 and p27 deprives the postmitotic neuron of its cell
  cycle suppression activity. The stressed neurons re-enter the cell cycle, but with
  the enhanced levels of cytoplasmic Cdk5, the neurons are temporarily protected from
  cell death. As yet, it is unknown what event causes the ultimate failure of this
  temporary protection. Driving expression of exogenous nuclear Cdk5 blocks the cell
  cycle; driving exogenous cytoplasmic Cdk5 attenuates cell death.
