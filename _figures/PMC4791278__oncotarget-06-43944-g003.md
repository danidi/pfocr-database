caption: (A) Venn diagram of differentially expressed genes of LNCaP cells treated
  with 5.0 μM EB for 24 h. (B) Ingenuity pathway analysis of G2/M DNA damage checkpoint
  regulation. EB caused up-regulation of 2751 genes and down-regulation of 1743 genes.
  The canonical pathway of G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation was overlaid with
  the microarray analysis-derived gene expression changes of LNCaP cells treated with
  5.0 μM EB for 24 h. Genes in red were up-regulated and genes in green were down-regulated
  by the indicated values (fold change) relative to vehicle control (DMSO).
