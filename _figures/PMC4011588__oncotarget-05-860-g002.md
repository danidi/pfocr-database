caption: Left, a cell with a normal karyotype produces equal proportions of RPs and
  does not activate p53. Right, an aneuploid cell with an extra copy of chromosome
  1 (indicated by an arrow) expresses a disproportionate amount of RPL11 resulting
  in the activation of the p53 stress response pathway.
