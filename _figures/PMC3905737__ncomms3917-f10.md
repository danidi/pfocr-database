caption: (a) During corticostriatal pathway activation glutamate is released into
  the synaptic cleft. Astrocytes take up glutamate, which stimulates lactate efflux
  and ascorbic acid release from these cells. Ascorbic acid enters neurons through
  SVCT2. Intracellular ascorbic acid inhibits glucose consumption via specific GLUT3
  inhibition and stimulates lactate uptake in neurons. Synaptic activity produces
  reactive oxidant species (ROS) that oxidize ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid
  (DHA). DHA is released from neurons and is taken up by astrocytes through glucose
  transporters. Astrocytes can reduce oxidized ascorbic acid because they express
  specific glutathione-dependent reductases. (b) SVCT2 constantly cycles to and from
  the plasma membrane. When astrocytes release ascorbic acid, the increase in extracellular
  ascorbic acid concentration induces a decrease in the rate of SVCT2 endocytosis,
  which in turn increases SVCT2 at the cell surface. In presymptomatic stages of HD-like
  disease in mice, a failure in ascorbic acid release from glial cells can be observed.
  In contrast, in symptomatic stages of HD-like disease in mice, a failure in SVCT2
  translocation to the plasma membrane is observed. AMPAR, (2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazol-4-yl)propanoic
