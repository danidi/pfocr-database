caption: DEGs associated with the plant-pathogen interaction pathway as well as SA-
  and JA-signalling pathways in R. solani-infected OsACBP5-OEs. The KEGG database–
  was used for pathway analysis. (A) Increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration
  by the activation of CNGCs, CDPK and CaM/CML in PTI, is a regulator for production
  of ROS and NOS which results in the hypersensitive response,. Activation of FLS2
  in PTI triggers the MAPK signalling pathway that induces known defence genes for
  the generation of antimicrobial compounds such as phytoalexins, camalexin and lignin,.
  Pathogen infection induces RIN4 in ETI, which activates the disease resistant proteins
  RPM1 and RPS2. RPM1 and RPS2 then trigger a complex formed by HSP90, RAR1 and SGT1
  leading to the hypersensitive response–. SGT1 also regulates early R gene-mediated
  plant defences upon pathogen infection. Up-regulated genes are boxed in red, genes
  those are not affected are boxed in grey. Those marked with asterisks in this figure
  have been previously discussed. (B) SA triggers the accumulation NPR1 which activates
  the TGA transcription factor and PR1 resulting in plant defence,. Activation of
  JAR1 following pathogen infection catalyses the production of JA-Ile from JA. Production
  of JA-Ile is crucial for the JA-signalling pathway involving COI1, JAZ and MYC2
  leading to plant defence,. Up-regulated genes are boxed in red.
