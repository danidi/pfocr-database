caption: Scheme for the metabolic activation of 3MI by mouse OM and lung microsomal
  P450s. Pathway A represents dehydrogenation and pathway B represents epoxidation
  [The figure has been drawn on the basis of the findings in ]. Shaded areas show
  metabolites preferentially formed by CYP2A5 (blue) or CYP2F2 (green).
