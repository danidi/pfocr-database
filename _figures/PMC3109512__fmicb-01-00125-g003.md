caption: Proposed role of CnPlc1 in pathogenicity-related signaling in C. neoformans.
  1. Cyclic AMP (cAMP)/Protein kinase A (Pka) signaling pathway. A change in extracellular
  nutrient levels trigger activation of the integral membrane-associated G-protein
  coupled receptor, GPR4, causing its associated Gα subunit (Gpa1) to activate adenylyl
  cyclase (Cac1), resulting in production of cAMP. cAMP binds to regulatory subunits
  (Pkr1) of the Pka complex (not shown) to release an active form of the catalytic
  subunit (Pka1), which phosphorylates the transcription factor, Nrg1. A GTPase-activating
  protein (Crg2) negatively regulates Gpa1. Gib2, Gβ subunit. Based on studies in
  S. cerevisiae and our own published and preliminary data in C. neoformans demonstrating
  the requirement for CnPlc1 in melanin production (via LAC1 transcription), capsule
  production and secretion of virulence determinants (Chayakulkeeree et al., ), CnPlc1
  may be linked to cAMP signaling possibly by regulating the activation of Gpa1 as
  indicated by the dashed line. Lac1, Laccase 1; GXM, glucuronic acid-xylose-mannan.
  2. Ca2+/calcineurin signaling pathway. This pathway primarily regulates high temperature
  growth in C. neoformans, but not in S. cerevisiae. High temperatures may trigger
  CnPlc1 to hydrolyse PIP2, producing IP3, which potentially raises intracellular
  Ca2+ (see dashed line) by regulating Ca2+ pumps/channels in the plasma membrane
  and ER. Cytosolic Ca2+ is sensed by calmodulin (Cam1), which activates calmodulin
  kinases (CaMKs) (not shown) and the calcineurin complex (Cna1 and Cnb1) to support
  growth at 37°C. Cyclosporine A (CsA) and FK506, bind cyclophilin A and FKBP12, respectively,
  to inhibit calcineurin; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Calcineurin
  is also essential for hyphal elongation during mating and monokaryotic fruiting
  (not shown). 3. Pkc1/Mpk1 MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway conveys cell wall
  perturbation signals detected by unknown membrane sensors, to the nucleus. CnPlc1
  is essential for activation of Mpk1 in response to cell wall perturbation in a process
  that may, or may not be, mediated by activation of Pkc1 via the CnPlc1 hydrolysis
  product, DAG (see dashed line). Activated Pkc1 phosphorylates MAPKKK (Bck1) and
  subsequent phosphorylations of MAPKK (Mkk2) by Bck1 and MAPK (Mpk1) by Mkk2 to upregulate
  transcription of FKS1, which encodes β-1,3-glucan synthase. Expression of FKS1 is
  also negatively regulated by calcineurin. DAG produced by the sphingolipid synthetic
  pathway enzyme inositolphosphoceramide 1 synthase (Ipc1), and possibly by CnPlc1,
  also activates CnPkc1 to regulate melanin production independently of Mpk1 activation
  (Heung et al., ). Pkc1 is also required for host temperature growth (Gerik et al.,
  ).
