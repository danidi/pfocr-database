caption: CER can be generated intracellularly via the de novo and recycling pathways.
  In the de novo pathway, palmitoyl-CoA and serine are converted to CER, a step catalyzed
  by serine palmitoyl transferase. In the recycling pathway, CER is formed via degradation
  of sphingomyelins; these steps are mediated by a variety of sphingomyelinases. CER
  is converted sphingosine by ceramidase. Sphingosine is converted to sphingosine-1-phosphate
  by sphingosine kinase. It is noteworthy that both CER and sphingosine have been
  shown to promote cell cycle arrest and cell senescence and induce cell apoptosis.
  Interestingly, however, sphingosine-1-phosphate exerts positive modulatory effects
  on cell function including cell proliferation, motility and survival. Therefore,
  intermediates of these pathway play both positive and negative modulatory roles
  in cell function.
