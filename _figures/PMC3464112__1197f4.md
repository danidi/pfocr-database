caption: Models of PUF-8 function in gamete development. (A) PUF-8 functions at multiple
  stages in the development of gametes. These functions include promoting stem cell
  maintenance (; ), inhibition of the proliferative fate in GSCs (this work), inhibition
  of the male sexual fate (), and inhibition of dedifferentiation of male germ cells
  progressing through meiosis (). (B and C) Models of PUF-8 function in regulating
  the balance between the proliferative fate and meiotic entry. Illustration of distal
  end of gonad showing the DTC (yellow), mitotic cells (green) and meiotic cells (red).
  (B) PUF-8 may inhibit the activity of GLP-1/Notch signaling. GLP-1/Notch signaling
  levels are thought to be high at the very distal end, and lower as cells progress
  proximally. In this model, PUF-8 contributes to the lowering of GLP-1/Notch signaling
  levels, allowing cells to enter meiotic prophase. The inhibition of GLP-1/Notch
  signaling may not be direct, but rather PUF-8 may inhibit the activity of a positive
  regulator of GLP-1/Notch signaling. (C) PUF-8 may inhibit the proliferative fate
  in a pathway that is parallel to the GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. In both models
  (B and C) PUF-8 is shown to be active throughout the distal end of the gonad; however,
  it is possible that another factor or post-translational modification causes PUF-8
  not to be active in some regions where it is expressed.
