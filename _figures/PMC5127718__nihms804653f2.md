caption: '(A) TFEB and MITF localization is dependent on their phosphorylation sites
  and states. In fully fed cells, TFEB (and probably MITF too) associates with active
  RAG GTPases in the LYNUS machinery at the surface of lysosomes and becomes phosphorylated
  by mTORC-1 at multiple sites including Ser211 and Ser142 (phosphorylation indicated
  by blue circles) followed by release to the cytosol and complex formation with 14-3-3
  chaperones (indicated by black lines and arrowheads) (; ). C-TAK1 and ERK1/2 have
  also been suggested to phosphorylate MITF and TFEB at Ser173 and Ser142, respectively,
  and promote their cytosolic stabilization by complex formation with 14-3-3 proteins
  (indicated by blue lines and arrowheads). Under certain conditions such as starvation
  or cellular stress, mTORC-1 detaches from LYNUS and no longer phosphorylates TFEB
  likely leading to destabilization of TFEB-14-3-3 complexes and promoting the nuclear
  translocation of the factor (indicated by grey lines and arrowheads). MITF may be
  regulated in a similar manner (; ; ). In addition, following uptake by specific
  PM receptors, M-CSF and RANKL are also able to promote nuclear translocation of
  MITF by inhibiting C-TAK1 (which in turn destabilizes MITF-14-3-3 complexes) and/or
  promoting ERK 1/2-associated phosphorylation of the factor at Ser73 (; ). RANKL
  alone has been shown to increase TFEB nuclear levels by preventing its degradation
  via PKC-β-associated phosphorylation at multiple serine residues (phosphorylation
  indicated by yellow circles), which seems to stabilize TFEB in the cytosol (). (B).
  Following nuclear mobilization, MITF and TFEB (depicted by green and red circles/arrows,
  respectively) promote the transcription of lysosomal genes (; ; ). Newly synthesized
  lysosomal proteins pass through the ER and the Golgi and reach acidic late endosomes
  by vesicular trafficking (depicted by triangles, circles, rectangles and squares
  in the various organelles, and described in the legend). Abbreviations: M-CSF, macrophage-colony
  stimulating factor. RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand.
  LY, lysosome. MITF, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor. TFEB, transcription
  factor EB. C-TAK1, Cdc25C-associated kinase 1. MAPK, Mitogen-activated protein kinases.
