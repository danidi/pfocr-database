caption: 'MAPK–PI3K–Akt pathway and BRAFV600 mutation in melanoma.Notes: MAPK pathway
  in normal cells (left), where growth factors bound to RTK result in phosphorylation
  of Ras kinase, which further activates downstream kinases (Raf–MEK–ERK and PI3K–Akt–mTOR)
  and regulates the activities of several transcription factors responsible for cell
  growth, survival, and proliferation. BRAFV600 mutations in melanoma lead to constitutive
  activation of the MAPK pathway, which leads to uncontrolled cell survival, growth,
  and proliferation in malignant melanoma (right) that might be reversed, at least
  temporarily, by treatment with BRAF inhibitors.'
