caption: L-Methionine S-oxide (LMSO) transport and utilization pathway. The addition
  of reactions to model iMM_BT_OMV to represent transfer of LMSO by OMV from Bt to
  mouse and the enzyme found that could reduce LMSO to L-methionine in mouse. Squares
  represent reactions and circles represent metabolites, separated into their relevant
  compartments, “c,” “o,” and “cm,” in the model. Arrows show the direction of reaction
  flux; solid lines represent parts present in the original model, dash-single-dot
  lines represent parts added in OMV metabolism and dash-double-dot lines represent
  the reaction added during gap filling to link imported LMSO to mouse metabolism
  (by reduction). Reaction names and summaries are underlined.
