caption: Schematic model of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipocytes. Under
  normal conditions, insulin binds to the extracellular α subunits of the insulin
  receptor (IR), which leads to intracellular autophosphorylation of β subunits of
  the IR. Subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)
  family of proteins leads to the phosphorylation and activation of phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI-3K). Phosphorylation of PI-3K leads to the activation of the phosphoinositide-dependent
  protein kinase (PDK), which phosphorylates and activates downstream serine/threonine
  kinases protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase B (Akt/PKB). This cascade results
  in the translocation of the insulin-stimulated glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to
  the plasma membrane, where it facilitates intracellular flux of glucose. In addition
  to this PI-3K–dependent pathway, the IR can signal independently of PI-3K to stimulate
  GLUT4 translocation. In this case, IR autophoshorylation can lead to the tyrosine
  phosphorylation of c-cbl, and association of the cbl-associated protein (CAP). Subsequent
  binding of the SH2/SH3-containing adapter protein CrkII and the guanyl nucleotide
  exchange factor (C3G) activities the Rho family TC10. Activation of the TC10 plays
  a crucial role in the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. Activation
  of both the PI-3K dependent and independent pathways is necessary for insulin-stimulated
  glucose uptake in adipocytes. Thiazolidinediones (TZD) increase insulin sensitivity
  in part by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ-dependent
  transactivation of GLUT-4 and CAP genes. We contend that trans-10, cis-12 CLA (t10,c12-CLA)–induced
  insulin resistance involves antagonism of PPARγ in human adipocytes. In support
  of this concept, t10, c12-CLA diminishes the expression and TZD-induced activity
  of PPARγ (). By antagonizing PPARγ signaling, t10, c12-CLA may indirectly reduce
  GLUT4 expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.
