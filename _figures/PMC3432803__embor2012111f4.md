  IgE-mediated signals. In mice, basophils bind to IgE generated during a primary
  immune response through a high-affinity receptor (FcɛRI). In a secondary immune
  response, binding of recall antigen to IgE triggers basophil release of IL-4 and
  IL-6, which enhances the differentiation of TH2 cells secreting IL-4, IL-6, IL-10
  and IL-13 (1A). With CD40L, these cytokines enhance the activation and expansion
  of class-switched memory B cells in the context of a cognate interaction that leads
  to the generation of IgG-secreting plasma cells. Antigen-activated basophils might
  also stimulate memory B cells by delivering helper signals through IL-4, IL-6 and
  CD40L in a T-cell-independent manner (1B). This pathway might also enhance IgE production
  in mucosal B cells. (2) IgD-mediated signals. In humans, B cells from the upper
  respiratory mucosa undergo non-canonical CSR from IgM to IgD by either T-cell-dependent
  or -independent pathways. This process leads to the formation of mucosal and circulating
  plasmablasts that secrete IgD antibodies to respiratory bacteria. IgD enhances local
  and systemic immune responses by binding to mucosal and circulating basophils through
  an unknown IgD receptor (IgDR). In the presence of IgD crosslinking by antigen,
  basophils enhance CSR and antibody production by activating B cells through various
  stimuli, including CD40L, BAFF, APRIL and IL-4. Whether IgD-activated basophils
  also induce TH2 polarization remains unknown, although some data suggest this possibility.
