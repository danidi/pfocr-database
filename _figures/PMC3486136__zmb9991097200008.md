caption: Model for the regulation of cellular responses to oxidative stress by Cdc34
  oxidation. In our model, certain oxidative stress conditions promote thiol oxidation
  of a specific ubiquitin pathway E2 enzyme, Cdc34, which inhibits ubiquitinylation
  of downstream substrates (Sub). This inhibition results in cellular responses to
  oxidative stress, including, for example, a delay in cell cycle progression. In
  the model, reduced glutathione is coupled to Uba1 and Cdc34 oxidation via a negative
  feedback loop that reverses their oxidation, restoring normal regulation of downstream
  substrates when redox conditions have improved.
