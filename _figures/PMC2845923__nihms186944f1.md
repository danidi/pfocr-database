caption: An epigenetic model depicting the influence of breast cancer-associated fibroblasts
  on the non-cancerous breast epithelial cells (MCF10A). (A) After cocultured with
  cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), CST-6 (and perhaps other breast cancer-associated
  genes) became hypermethylated and silenced (marked in red). Epigenetic perturbation
  was mediated by an activation of AKT1 signaling pathway. (B) In contrast, exposure
  to normal fibroblasts (NF) confers negligible levels of epigenetic perturbations
  and AKT1 kinase activation in the same MCF10A cells (marked in light blue).
