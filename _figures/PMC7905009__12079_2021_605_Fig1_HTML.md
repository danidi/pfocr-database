caption: Canonical and non-canonical TGFβ pathway. (1, 2) In the presence of ligands,
  two type I receptors (TβRI) and two type two receptors (TβRII) form the receptor
  complex. (3) This leads to the activation of TβRI by phosphorylation in their GS
  domain or in tyrosine (tyr) residues. The coreceptor betaglycan shows high binding
  affinity for TGFβ isoforms and presents ligands to TβRII. Endoglin is another coreceptor
  involved in regulation of TGFβ response. (4I) If phosphorylation occurs in the GS
  domain, the canonical pathway is induced. This consist of activation of the R-Smads
  Smad2 or Smad3, which form a complex with the co-Smad Smad4, resulting in its internalization
  to the cell nucleus and its interaction with DNA and other transcriptional comodulators.
  (4II) The Phosphorylation of tyr residues in TβRI or TβRII results in the activation
  of noncanonical pathways, e.g., c-Src phosphorylates the tyr residues of TβRII,
  leading to recruitment and formation of Shc and the Gbr2 complex that activates
  p38. Activation of TβRI on tyr residues drives ERK activation mediated by Shc. Alternatively,
  TAK1 is activated by TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination, promoting the activation of
  the ERK or p38 pathway
