caption: 'Fatty acid overload in the hepatocyte activates the protein kinase c- epsilon
  (PKC-ε) and/or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK-1), with subsequent impairment of phosphorylation
  of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2. This results in impairment
  of the insulin signaling pathway. The decreased insulin action on glycogen synthase
  induces increased glucose secretion. Yet, fat accumulation stimulates neoglucogenesis
  further increasing the hepatic glucose secretion. The hepatocyte’s attempt to dispose
  of excessive triglyceride accumulation through increased VLDL secretion, is ineffective,
  further contributing to accumulation of liver fat. DNL: de novo lipogenesis.'
