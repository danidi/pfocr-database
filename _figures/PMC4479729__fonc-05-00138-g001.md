caption: The synthesis of glycoconjugates from glucose through the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP). After glucose entry into the cell via the glucose transport, it is
  phosphorylated into glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6P) by hexokinase (HK), mainly proceeding
  into glycolysis through conversion into fructose-6­-phosphate (Fru-6P) by Glc-6P
  isomerase. Alternatively, Glc-6P may be utilized by the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP). Glc-6P can also be diverted to glucosamine-6-phosphate by the rate-limiting
  enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT) (c). The end product
  of this pathway, uridinediphosphoglucose-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) (d) serves
  to build extracellular glycoconjugates (a), as well as, it is used for the biosynthesis
  of intracellular O-linked glycoproteins (b) by the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase.
  Alternatively, UDP-GlcNAc can undergo epimerization to generate UDP-GalNAc (e) and
  CMP-Neu5Ac (f) which can be used for the extracellular biosynthesis of glycoproteins
  and glycolipids (a) UDP-GlcNAc and its derivatives are extremely responsive to variations
  in cell nutrients as its synthesis depends on products of the metabolism of glucose
  (green), amino acids (blue), fatty acids (red), and nucleotides (orange). Thus,
  glycosylation can serve as a reporter for the functional status of multiple pathways
  and considered a metabolic sensor.
