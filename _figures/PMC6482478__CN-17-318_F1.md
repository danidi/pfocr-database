caption: 'Basic mechanisms of lithium function. Arrows with triangular heads represent
  activations, arrows with oval heads represent inhibitions. a) In the absence of
  lithium, myo-inositol (MI) and cytidine-diphosphate-diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) are
  converted by phosphatidylinositol synthase (PI synthase) into phosphatidylinositol
  (PI). Phosphatidylinositol-kinase (PIK) converts it to phosphatidylinositol-phosphate
  (PIP), which is further phosphorylated by phosphatidylinositol-phosphate-kinase
  (PIPK) to phosphatidylinositol-diphosphate (PIP2). Phosphatidylinositol-diphosphate
  can be processed by two separate pathways. The pathway of phospholipase C (PLC)
  splits it to produce inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Inositol
  triphosphate can be recycled by inositol-phosphate phosphatase 5 (IPP5), which converts
  it to inositol diphosphate (IP2). Inositol diphosphate can be subsequently dephosphorylated
  to inositol phosphate (IP), by inositol phosphate phosphatase (IPP): this is a magnesium-dependent
  and chain-limiting step, that may impair the whole inositol-phosphate cycle. Inositol
  phosphate can finally be dephosphorylated by inositol monophosphate phosphatase
  (IMP) to regenerate myo-inositol: this is also a magnesium-dependent chain-limiting
  step. Before being recycled, inositol triphosphate can bind to inositol triphosphate
  receptors (IP3R) on the endoplasmic reticulum, to promote the liberation of calcium
  into the cytosol. This free calcium rapidly binds to several proteins, among which
  calmodulin can promote the activation of calcium-dependent kinases (CaMKs) and phosphatases
  (CaN); calcium can also bind and activate protein kinase C (PKC), together with
  diacylglycerol. The pathway of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) instead produces
  phosphatidylinositol-triphosphate, which can directly bind and activate protein
  kinase B (Akt). These pathways converge, together with the contribution from G-protein
  coupled receptors (GPCR) which also comprise dopamine receptors (DR), to determine
  the activation status of the Akt/Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) complex.
  GPCRs can recruit β-arrestin, which serves as a scaffold; phosphatidylinositol-triphosphate
  activates Akt; protein kinase C inhibits GSK-3β; the calcium-dependent phosphatase
  instead activates GSK-3β. Therefore, in the absence of lithium: the inositol-phosphate
  cycle can be activated, calcium signals can be activated; the Akt/GSK-3β complex
  can be regulated. b) lithium can enter the cell through sodium channels (Na+ chnl).
  With lithium, the magnesium-dependent and chain-limiting steps of the inositol-phosphate
  cycle are blocked, with the result of an accumulation of inositol-diphosphate and
  a depletion of all other intermediates. This causes a deactivation of both PI3K
  and PLC pathways, resulting in a dramatically decreased calcium signaling. Finally,
  the Akt/GSK-3β complex does not receive any more regulating phosphorylations or
  dephosphorylations; moreover, lithium can destabilize the complex.'
