caption: Pathways of nicotine, NAD, and polyamine metabolism in tobacco. Each defined
  enzymatic step is represented by an arrow and enzyme name, whereas undefined single
  or multiple step processes are represented by broken arrows. Boxes denote enzymes
  hypothesized to be involved predominantly in the nicotine biosynthesis pathway,
  whereas enzymes predominantly associated with related primary metabolic pathways
  are not framed. QS is underlined as it contributes to both nicotine and NAD pathways.
