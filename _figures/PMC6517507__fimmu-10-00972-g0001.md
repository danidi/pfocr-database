caption: Model suggesting the relationships between Th17, Th1* and cTh1 populations
  and their potential roles in post-vaccination immunity, LTBI and active TB. (A)
  Current concepts of cTh1, Th17, and Th1* differentiation. cTh1 differentiate from
  naïve lymphocytes in the presence of IL-12 (, ). Th17 differentiate from naïve lymphocytes
  in the presence of cytokine mixture. In general, the differentiation of mouse Th17
  cells depends on IL-6/TGF-β; the generation of human Th17 is driven by IL-23/IL-1β/IL-6.
  The involvement of TGF-β in the generation of human Th17 has been suggested by some
  authors, especially at low cytokine doses (, , ). When exposed to IL-12, IL-1β,
  or/and TNF-α, Th17 convert into IFN-γ producing Th17.1 and Th1* lymphocytes (, –).
  Alternatively, Th1* may derive directly from naïve lymphocytes under the action
  of cytokines that have not yet been identified (). The concept considers Th1* and
  cTh1 as independent lineages of CD4+ T-cell differentiation. (B) Suggested pathway
  of cTh1, Th17, and Th1* differentiation. Naive cells progressively differentiate
  into Th17, Th1* and cTh1/cTh1-like lymphocytes. The depth of the differentiation
  depends on the strength of antigenic stimulation and cytokine milieu and is different
  in response to vaccination, LTBI and active TB. (C) Suggested pathway of cTh1, Th17,
  and Th1* differentiation and the predominance of different Th populations following
  vaccination, during LTBI and active TB. In response to vaccination, different populations
  of Th cells generate. Of them, Th17 have higher survival capacity and persist longer.
  Following Mtb infection, Th17 are exposed to antigen, IL-12 and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and differentiate into IFN-γ producing Th1* CXCR3+CCR6+ cells. The cells
  persist during LTBI and maintain protection against TB disease. cTh1 are generated
  in response to vaccination, LTBI and TB disease, but do not persist for a long time.
  During active TB, their magnitude increases due to their permanent generation from
  naïve lymphocytes and/or Th1*. The size of the circles indicates the relative prevalence
  and protective roles of the corresponding subsets in the indicated conditions. For
  each condition, prevalent pathways of T-cell differentiation are indicated in solid
  arrows, otherwise dashed arrows are used.
