caption: PKM2 is allosterically regulated by products of glucose derived glycolytic
  intermediates. (A) Reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibit the activity of PKM2 via
  oxidation of Cys 358. Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) derived NAPDH represses reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) through the reduction of glutathione. Ribose derived from the
  PPP contributes to the formation of the PKM2 activator SAICAR (succinylaminoimidazolecarboxamide
  ribose-5′-phosphate), a purine synthesis intermediate. (B) The glycolytic intermediate
  fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is a strong activator of PKM2. Serine can feedback to
  activate PKM2. Serine can also be converted to glycine, which contributes to the
  formation of PKM2 activator SAICAR.
