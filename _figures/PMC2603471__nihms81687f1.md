  analysis of age and oxidative stress gene signatures in oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive
  breast cancers, commonly identify tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and transforming
  growth factor-β (TGFβ) pathway nodes. Ariadne Pathway studio was used to identify
  the respective TNF- and TGFβ- regulated (direct or indirect) targets from the 126-gene
  age signature (a) and the 62-gene oxidant–oestrogen+ER signature (intersection of
  oestrogen- and ER-regulated signature and oxidant-stressed signature; b). Regulatory
  directions were determined from primary references provided by Pathway studio, with
  positive (+) regulatory directions denoted by arrow-heads and negative regulatory
  directions denoted by bars (lines without either arrowheads or bars indicate ambiguous
  regulatory direction). Unigene symbols in red ovals indicate signature genes that
  are upregulated by oxidative stress or in early-onset breast cancer; those in green
  ovals indicate signature genes that are downregulated by oxidative stress or in
  early-onset breast cancer. At least 75% of the signature genes that have been shown
  to be regulated by TNF and TGFβ (a, b) contain nuclear factor κB (NFκB) or AP1 consensus
  element binding sites within their proximal promoters, as determined by EZRetrieve
  and TFSEARCH– (see TFSEARCH in Further information). ABCC3, ATP-binding cassette
