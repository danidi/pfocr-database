caption: Model of HIV-1 extracellular Vpr action on astrocytic functions. A decrease
  in Vpr-induced intracellular ATP might be a direct consequence of Vpr binding to
  the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Indeed,
  Vpr might halt the physiological transport of ATP molecules produced during the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, lowering the cytosolic availability of ATP, with
  consequences for all cellular ATP-driven reactions. One such reaction is characterized
  by a decrease in reduced glutathione (GSH), the main cellular antioxidant, which
  is synthesized in two ATP-dependent reactions by the initial formation of cysteine–glutamate
  (Cys–Glu) (through the action of glutamyl-cysteine synthase [γ-GCS]) and the subsequent
  formation of GSH on addition of glycine (Gly) (by glutathione synthetase [GSH-S]).
  GSH functions as an electron donor in all cellular redox reactions by detoxifying
  ROS produced as byproducts of physiological cellular metabolism. Decreased concentration
  of reduced GSH may also cause a shift toward production of oxidized glutathione
  (GSSG), which then no longer acts as an electron donor and hence induces the intracellular
  accumulation of ROS. ROS buildup in astrocytes then leads to activation of the nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway,
  which induces transcription of NF-κB-dependent promoters, including the HIV long
  terminal repeat (LTR), hence increasing viral transactivation and viral particle
  production from persistently infected astrocytes. Conversely, decreased GSH synthesis
  may also be caused by impaired glutamate uptake from firing neurons, thus inducing
  excitotoxicity, and may affect the release of neuroprotective factors (lactate and
  GSH) on which neurons rely for their metabolism. This cascade of events, in turn,
  is predicted to be indicative of disease progression because patients in late-stage
  disease show increased levels of extracellular Vpr in the serum and the cerebrospinal
  fluid, which may ultimately escalate and induce neurocognitive impairment. ARE,
  antioxidant responsive element; EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; GPx, glutathione
  peroxidase; GR, glutathione reductase; PBR, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor;
