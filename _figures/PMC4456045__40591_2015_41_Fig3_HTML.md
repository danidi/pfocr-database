caption: A negative feedback cross talk between PI3Kα/Akt and NF-κB signaling pathway
  by a local brief stimulation of TLR9, a potent preconditioning tool for programming
  the subsequent responses to I/R injuries and stimulation by TLR2, TLR4, or TLR5
  ligands. TLR9 ligation with CpG-DNA leads to receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and
  subsequent activation of the p85 subunit of PI3K. The PI3K-α/Akt pathway is subsequently
  activated in response to TLR9 ligation. Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway protects
  cells against apoptosis, through up-regulation of the NF-κB pathway inhibitors TNFAIP3/TNIP1/NFKBIA/TRIM30.
  TLR9 agonist activates both NF-κB and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. TLR moderate activation
  directs to PI3K/Akt pathway through up-regulating NF-κB pathway inhibitors TNFAIP3,
  its associated protein TNIP1, NFKBIA, and also an additional inhibitor TRIM30a,
  to inhibit inflammatory pathway. Activation of PI3K/Akt signaling protects cells
  against apoptosis, through further up-regulation of the NF-κB pathway inhibitors
  TNFAIP3/TNIP1/NFKBIA/TRIM3. TLR9 signaling acts as a dominant activator of the isoform
  PI3Kα-Akt pathway during I/R injury and in the preconditioning mechanism
