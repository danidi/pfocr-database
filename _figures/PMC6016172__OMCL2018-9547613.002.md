caption: 'Pathway linked to ER stress. Schematic representations of hepatocyte in
  a fatty liver. A lipid overload, free fatty acids, and cholesterol may induce ER
  stress leading to “unfolded protein response” in order to reestablish the ER homeostasis.
  Its prolonged and repetitive activation should trigger a proapoptotic and inflammatory
  pathway resulting in an increase of oxidative stress. The activity of UPR is fundamentally
  mediated through three transmembrane stress transducers (PERK, IRE1, and ATF6),
  which regulate the expression of proinflammatory and antioxidant genes. In a prolonged
  ER stress condition, the ROS production is also increased by the overexpression
  of ERO1, an inducible ER oxidoreductase. Saturated fatty acids and ER stress can
  reduce the activity or SERCA determining a disruption of ER calcium store which
  can act on mitochondria blocking ETC and forming mPTP resulting in an uncontrolled
  transition of cytochrome C and other proapoptotic factors into the cytosol. ATF4:
  activating transcription factor 4; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; CHOP:
  C/EBP homologous protein; ER: endoplasmatic reticulum; ERO1: ER oxidoreductin 1;
  ETC: electron transport chain; IRE1: inositol-requiring signaling protein 1; IRS1:
  insulin receptor substrate 1; mPTP: mitochondrial permeability transition pore;
  PERK: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SERCA: sarco/endoplasmic
  reticulum CA2+-ATPase; UPR: unfolded protein response.'
