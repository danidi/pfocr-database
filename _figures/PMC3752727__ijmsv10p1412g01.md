caption: 'Possible mechanisms underlying the impairment of the HIF-1α pathway by hyperglycemia
  (1). A, B, C, D: the effects of MGO on HIF-1α; A: The covalent modification of HIF-1α
  leads to decreased dimerization of HIF-1α and HIF-1β, and further reduces the binding
  of HIF-1 and HRE; B: The covalent modification of p300 leads to inhibition of the
  interaction of CTAD and p300, which decreases the transactivation ability of HIF-1α;
  C: The covalent modification of HIF-1α increases its association with HSP40/70,
  which recruits CHIP and leads to HIF-1α proteasomal degradation; D: The exposure
  of RPE cells to MGO leads to destabilization of HIF-1α; E: Hyperglycemia increases
  the sensitivity of hydroxyl HIF-1α to VHL machinery; F: Hyperglycemia suppresses
  CTAD and NTAD, and finally reduces the transactivation ability of HIF-1α; G: In
  HDF and HDMEC, osmolarity is one of the mechanisms of hyperglycemia action; H: The
  impairment of HIF-1α stabilization by hyperglycemia is mediated by proteasomal degradation.
