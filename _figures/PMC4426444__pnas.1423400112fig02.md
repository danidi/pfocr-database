caption: 'Reconstructed metabolic pathways in the common ancestor of apicomplexans
  and dinoflagellates at the time of plastid gain (A) and in Hematodinium sp. (B),
  from transcriptomic data. Cytosolic MVA pathway is not present in any apicomplexan
  or dinoflagellate, but is present in ciliates and is inferred to be present at the
  time of plastid gain. Dashed lines indicate apicomplexan hybrid tetrapyrrole pathways;
  dashed circles indicate enzymes currently unidentified in transcriptomes. Enzyme
  color represents typical location and origin as follows: green, plastid; yellow,
  cytosol; red, mitochondrion. Hatched (green/white) DAP pathway indicates uncertain
  origin of this typically plastid-located pathway in Hematodinium. MVA, mevalonate
  IPP pathway; DOXP, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate IPP pathway; C15/20, isoprene
  chains 15 and 20 carbons long derived from IPP (an external source of IPP/isoprenoids
  for Hematodinium sp. is predicted); SUF, plastid-type iron-sulfur cluster pathway;
  DAP, diaminopimelate lysine pathway; C4/C5 pathways for tetrapyrrole (TP) synthesis
  differ only by the reactions to δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and their location.'
