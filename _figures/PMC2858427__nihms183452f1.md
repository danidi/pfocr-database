caption: Glutamate and three synaptic modulators (BDNF, estrogen, and adenosine) are
  released from the axon terminal (green) by patterned afferent activity. Adenosine
  binds to A1 and A2 receptors (black), estrogen to Erβ receptors (gray), and BDNF
  to TrkB receptors (white). The A1 receptors inhibit (red arrow) RhoA, but not Rac
  and Cdc42, activity. BDNF and E2 both stimulate (green arrows) RhoA; note that the
  former but not the latter also stimulates Rac. RhoA initiates a signaling cascade
  that involves activation of ROCK and its target LIM kinase; the latter phosphorylates
  and thereby inactivates (circle) cofilin, a constitutively active protein that blocks
  filament assembly. The RhoA pathway (cascade 1) thus removes a major barrier to
  actin polymerization. The resultant cytoskeletal changes are hypothesized to cause
  a modest increase in synaptic responses mediated by post-synaptic glutamate receptors
  (orange icons). Rac activates p21-activated kinase (PAK), which, through poorly
  understood mechanisms, stabilizes the newly formed filaments (cascade 2). Failure
  to engage the second pathway explains why estrogen’s effects reverse upon washout.
  LTP induction activates both cascades; estrogen’s positive activation on the first
  of these provides a route whereby the hormone enhances the potentiation effect.
  Also present are synaptic adhesion receptors, including integrins (blue). Glutamate
  receptors appear to activate integrins by causing the release of factors that stimulate
  extracellular proteases that create appropriate ligands (). Integrins also promote
  filament assembly and stabilization (). In all, estrogen is proposed to be a member
  of a family of synaptic modulatory factors whose receptors interact with other classes
  of receptors to regulate the local cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity.
