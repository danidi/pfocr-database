caption: Schematic overview of bone cells and extracellular matrix components involved
  in regulating bone homeostasis. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand
  (RANKL) binds to its conjugate receptor RANK on osteoclast cell surface to stimulate
  osteoclast differentiation and activity. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibits RANK/RANKL-binding
  to inhibit bone resorption. WNT signaling pathway stimulates osteoblast function
  and bone formation. Sclerostin (SOST) and dickkopfs (DKK1), produced by the osteocytes,
  are two WNT antagonists that promote osteoclasts differentiation. Osteonectin, produced
  by the osteoblasts, binds calcium, hydroxyapatite and collagen type I and thus regulates
  bone mineralization. Plastin-3 (PLS3), expressed by the osteocytes, may also be
  involved in the mineralization of the extracellular matrix but its role in osteoprogenitors
  and other bone cells is yet to be confirmed.
