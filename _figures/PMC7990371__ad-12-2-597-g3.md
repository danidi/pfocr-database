caption: 'The directly and indirectly anti-cancer pathways of APN. Binding to AdipoR1/2,
  APN could initiate a series of directly anti-cancer pathways, including inhibition
  of PI3K/AKT, ERK1/2, Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin, STAT3, USP2, and Bcl-2 signals; as well
  as activation of AMPK by LKB1, then up-regulates TSC2, p53/p21/p27 and promotes
  cell autophagy. Moreover, the tumorigenicity of the IGF axis has been confirmed
  to be partially through ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways, which are belonging to the downstream
  signaling of the APN. Since APN can increase insulin sensitivity, it is reasonable
  to believe that the complexity of the APN-related signaling network has been added
  by the possible indirect association between APN, insulin resistance, and the abnormal
  IGF system. The blue solid arrows and red solid arrows indicate inhibitory and stimulatory
  effects in the direct pathway, respectively. In turn, the blue dotted lines and
  red dotted lines indicate the inhibitory and stimulatory effects in the indirect
  pathway, respectively. Abbreviations: APN adiponectin, PI3K/AKT phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase/protein kinase B, ERK1/2 extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2
  Wnt wingless-type protein, GSK3β glycogen synthase kinase 3β, STAT3 signal transducer
  and activator of transcription 3, USP2 ubiquitin-specific protease 2, AMPK 5’ adenosine
  monophosphate-activated protein kinase, LKB1 liver kinase B1, TSC2 tuberous sclerosis
  complex 2, IGF insulin-like growth factor.'
