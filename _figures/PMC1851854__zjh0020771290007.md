caption: 'Model showing the iron-sensing and inflammatory pathways for Rgmc and hepcidin
  regulation. Iron-sensing pathway: Hfe/β2m and Rgmc regulate basal hepcidin expression
  independently. Iron-sensing by Rgmc does not involve modulation of Rgmc mRNA expression
  levels, but Rgmc is necessary for the regulation of hepcidin levels through the
  iron sensing-pathway. Inflammatory pathway: mRNA Rgmc down-regulation by LPS involves
  signaling through Tlr4 and consequent production of TNF-α. Down-regulation of Rgmc
  suppresses hepcidin control through the iron-sensing pathway and allows hepcidin
  induction by IL-6.'
