caption: A schematic representation of the changes that occur during the development
  of NAFLD/NASH (shown in yellow boxes) from the initial accumulation of triglycerides
  in the liver to the inflammation and fibrosis that would be seen in steatohepatitis.
  In addition, this schematic depicts the areas in which Nrf2 activation may positively
  affect this pathway and prevent the development and/or progression of this disease
  (shown in green circles). These deductions are based on many findings from the literature
  cited in the text of this review. NAFLD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; NASH,
  nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; Nrf2, nuclear erythroid 2–related factor 2; ROS, reactive
  oxygen species; SOD, superoxide dismutase.
