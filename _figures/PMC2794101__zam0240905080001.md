caption: Anaerobic metabolism of E. coli using the mixed-acid fermentation pathway
  (data from reference ). The native phosphotransferase system pathway for glucose
  uptake and the mixed-acid pathway for fermentation are shown with black arrows.
  Peripheral reactions for glucose uptake, carboxylation, and acetyl-CoA synthesis
  are shown as dotted green arrows and represent new metabolic functions that have
  been recruited for succinate production from glucose. Reactions that have been blocked
  by gene deletions or point mutations are marked with an X. pck* indicates a novel
  mutation that derepressed pck, allowing the enzyme to serve as the primary route
  for oxaloacetate production. Pyruvate (boxed) appears at two sites but is presumed
  to exist as a single intracellular pool.
