caption: (A) In rat neonatal ventricular cardiac myocytes, activation of Rap1 by Epac1,
  results in attenuation of ERK5 activation thereby impeding ERK5 induced myocyte
  growth and hypertrophy. (B) Rap1 is involved in gap junction formation, examined
  in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. Activation of the Epac-Rap1 pathway by cAMP shows
  increased accumulation of connexin-43 at cell-cell contacts, and together with cAMP
  activated A-kinase signaling, enhances gap junction mediated intercellular communication.
  (C) Rap1 isoforms are also involved in regulation of electrically evoked calcium
  induced calcium release, determined in adult mouse ventricular cardiac myocyte.
  In these cells, the Epac-Rap1 pathway is parallel to the A-kinase pathway, and is
  important for optimum β–adrenoceptor regulation of cardiac function. Arrowhead (green,
  up) denotes activation or increase, and (red, down) denotes decreased activity.
