caption: Mutations in MMR genes either inhibit (red) or impair (yellow) common steps
  in Exo1-independent or Exo1-dependent MMR as well as steps that are specific to
  Exo1-independent MMR. Recognition of mispairs by Msh2-Msh6 and recruitment of Mlh1-Pms1
  by Msh2-Msh6 are steps common to both MMR pathways and are required for the formation
  of the Mlh1-Pms1 foci MMR intermediates. At least an initial PCNA-activated endonuclease
  cleavage event by Mlh1-Pms1 is required for both downstream pathways. The activating
  PCNA could either be retained on the newly replicated DNA or loaded at a nick by
  RFC (; ). When the Exo1-dependent pathway is inactivated, mutations that partially
  reduce the activation of Mlh1-Pms1, including mutations that disrupt the localization
  of PCNA by Msh2-Msh6, cause large increases in mutation rates due to a potential
  requirement for multiple cleavage events by Mlh1-Pms1. When the Exo1-dependent pathway
  is functional, mutations that partially reduce the activation of Mlh1-Pms1 cause
  much smaller increases in mutation rates because the Exo1-dependent pathway may
  not require multiple cleavage events by Mlh1-Pms1. Although loss of the Exo1-independent
  pathway only causes a minor increase in mutation rates in the presence of Exo1,
  loss of this pathway causes increased Mlh1-Pms1 foci, suggesting that the Exo1-dependent
  pathway has slower kinetics of processing MMR intermediates when activation of Mlh1-Pms1
  is partially reduced. Because both leading and lagging strand replication leave
  nicks in the DNA as well as sites where PCNA might remain after completion of DNA
  synthesis (Discussed in ()). The repair of both leading and lagging strands generated
  during DNA replication seems likely to involve similar mechanisms.
