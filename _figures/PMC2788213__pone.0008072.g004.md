caption: 'Viral ligands are shown as diamonds, genes/proteins as circles, and complexes
  or pathways as rectangles. Green arrows indicate activation, red T-bars represent
  inhibition, black lines indicate binding, and blue lines indicate stimulation of
  gene expression. For clarity, blue lines feeding back to upstream pathway components
  were removed; many of these upstream components, however, are regulated by type
  I IFN and/or NFκB. The colour of a node reflected the H5N1:H1N1 expression ratio:
  blue nodes were not significantly differentially expressed in response to either
  virus, pink/red nodes were up-regulated more in response to H5N1 than H1N1 (red
   = >1.5-fold more in response to H5N1, pink  = 1.0-1.49-fold higher in response
  to H5N1), and the green node was down-regulated to a greater extent in response
  to H5N1. Larger nodes had a fold-change value of >10 in H5N1 infection.'
