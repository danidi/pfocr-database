caption: Regulatory loops around TGFB1 link important transcription factors and cytokines.
  Network of EZH2 as well as upstream interactors of TGFB1 among the 2121 DEGs, respectively.
  Interactions based on Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and filtered for transcription
  regulators and cytokines. All interconnections between genes shown. Genes color-coded
  by mean expression change observed in MRKH/Ctrl. Line width indicates number of
  curated interactions.
