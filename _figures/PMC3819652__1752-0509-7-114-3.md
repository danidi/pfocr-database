caption: UM1 scheme. Schematic representation of the biggest UM found in B. cuenoti
  iCG238 model, which includes all the reactions belonging to the Menaquinol Biosynthetic
  Pathway. Metabolites are represented by name labels and colored accordingly to its
  category (yellow for RNP and RNC; black for DNP and UNC); reactions are represented
  as squares with its associated EC number.
