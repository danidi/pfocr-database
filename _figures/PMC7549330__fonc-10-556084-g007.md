caption: Diagram illustrating the molecular mechanism of LINC01315 in proliferation,
  invasion, and migration of OSCC cells. LINC01315 can competitively bind to miR-211
  and attenuate the binding of miR-211 to DLG3, which promotes the binding of DLG3
  to MST1/2, leading to activation of the Hippo signaling pathway. The reduced translocation
  of YAP protein into nuclei correspondingly led to suppression of the proliferation,
  migration and invasion of OSCC cells and promotion of cell apoptosis.
