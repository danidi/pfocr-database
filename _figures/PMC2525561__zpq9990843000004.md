caption: Schematic diagram of in vivo n3 VLC-PUFA biosynthetic pathway mediated by
  ELOVL4 and other ELO families [modified after Suh and Clandinin ()]. 18:3n3, 20:5n3,
  or 22:5n3 can be converted to VLC-PUFA through consecutive enzymatic activities
  of desaturases and elongases. Although some elongases are specific for a single
  step, others are nonspecific or multifunctional and act at several steps (e.g.,
  human ELOVL5 and murine ELOVL2) (). We propose that ELOVL4 is essential for elongation
  of saturated 26:0 to 28:0 and of 26:5n3 to 28:5n3. It is also possible that ELOVL4
  is necessary for generating (C30–C38):5n3 because these fatty acids are formed only
  in ELOVL4 expressing cells. However, other ELOVLs may be responsible for elongations
  of some of these VLC-PUFA (C30–C38) by using products generated by ELOVL4 elongase
  activity. The synthesis of 34:6n3 and 36:6n3 in our study suggests desaturase activity
  on their shorter chain precursors. However, the specific desaturase(s) involved
  is not known.
