caption: Scheme of cross-talk interactions between TIM-3, Gal-9 and TLR4 signaling
  networks. IR-triggered liver damage leads to the activation of macrophages and Th1
  cells, which express Gal-9 and TIM-3, respectively. TIM-3-Gal-9 signaling negatively
  regulates Th1 cells by suppressing TLR4-NF-κB pathway via IFN-γ, which in turn stimulates
  Gal-9 and prevents macrophage activation. Diminished elaboration of pro-inflammatory
  cytokine and chemokine programs mitigates the hepatocellular damage and ultimately
  facilitates liver homeostasis.
