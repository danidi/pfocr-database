caption: As innate immune cells in the CNS, microglia are activated after SAH in vivo
  and in vitro. Microglia then initiate an inflammatory cascade to aggravate neuronal
  damage, which is an important cause of EBI. A neurosteroid, DHEA, exerts an anti-inflammatory
  effect after Hb exposure by initiating the TrkA/Akt signalling pathway and inducing
  the expression of the H3K27me3 demethylase, Jmjd3. Jmjd3 then negatively regulates
  proinflammatory genes and modulates the proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory switch,
  possibly through its downstream transcription factors
