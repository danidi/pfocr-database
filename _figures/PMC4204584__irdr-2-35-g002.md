caption: 'Therapeutic development strategies for AD (The ‘PrPC axis’). The green color
  portion of PrPC indicates the protective function of PrPC (left-hand side), and
  the red color portion of PrPC indicates PrPC as the receptor of Aβ oligomers (righthand
  side) to mediate the Aβ toxicity. The left-hand side of the figure indicates therapeutic
  strategies by enhancing the normal function of PrPC (enhancing the inhibitory effect
  on BACE1, which reduces Aβ production, and enhancing the α-cleavage, which increases
  production of the protective N1 fragment of PrPC). The right-hand side of the figure
  indicates therapeutic strategies by targeting the Aβ oligomer/PrPC-mediated toxic
  signaling pathway, which encompass measures to inhibit Aβ oligomerization, Aβ prion-like
  activity, interaction of Aβ oligomers with PrPC, Aβ oligomer/PrPC-mediated disinhibition
  of BACE1, intermediate mediators (such as caveolin-1 and NCAM), Fyn kinase, and
  prion-like activity of hyperphosphorylated Tau. (Abbreviations: Aβo: Aβ oligomers;
  N1: N1 fragment of PrPC; p-Tau: hyperphosphorylated Tau.)'
