caption: Role of adaptors in T-cell signalling. Ligation of the T-cell receptor (TCR)
  leads to the activation of Scr family protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), such as Lck,
  which phosphorylate key tyrosine residues within immunoreceptor-based tyrosine activation
  motifs (ITAMs) on CD3 and TCRζ chains. This results in the phosphorylation and activation
  of the syk family PTK zeta associated protein-70 (ZAP-70), which subsequently phosphorylates
  the linker for activation of T cell (LAT) and SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein
  of 76 kDa (SLP-76), allowing them to interact with SH2-containing proteins. SLP-76
  and its associated molecules are recruited to LAT in the plasma membrane via an
  interaction with the Grb2-related adaptor downstream of Shc (GADS). This leads to
  the SLP-76-dependent activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ1), which results in intracellular
  Ca2+ mobilization and protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Phosphorylation of SLP-76
  allows SH2-mediated binding to the adaptors Vav and Nck, leading to cytoskeletal
  reorganization. SLP-76 also binds to adhesion and degranulation promoting adaptor
  protein (ADAP) [previously termed Fyn T-binding protein (FYB)/SLP-76-associated
  protein (SLAP)] in a pathway that involves Fyn-T and binding to Src kinase-associated
  phosphoprotein of 55 kDa (SKAP-55) and SKAP-55R.
