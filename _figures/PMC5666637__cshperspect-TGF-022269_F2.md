caption: Summary of the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling pathway and
  mutations causing connective tissue disorders. TGF-β molecules (TGF-β1, -β2, and
  -β3) are secreted in latent forms that are unable to interact with the receptors.
  In the latent form, dimeric TGF-β molecules are noncovalently associated with dimeric
  latency-associated peptides (LAPs), which are made from the same gene as the corresponding
  TGF-β molecule. This complex, which is referred to as the small latent complex (SLC),
  is then covalently linked by disulfide bonds to a member of the latent TGF-β binding
  protein (LTBP) family, to form the larger complex called large latent complex (LLC).
  The LLC complex interacts noncovalently with various components of the extrcellular
  matrix (ECM), including fibrillin microfibrils and integrins, the major adhesion
  molecule linking cells to the ECM. Both fibrillin and TGF-β (TGF-β1 and -β3, but
  not TGF-β2) contain an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) domain that can bind
  integrin molecules. Cross talk between LTBP, fibrillin, and integrins is thought
  to be critical for proper localization, sequestration, and conversion of latent
  TGF-β to active TGF-β. Once activated, dimeric TGF-β binds to a tetrameric receptor
  complex formed by two type I (TβRI) and type II (TβRII) receptor subunits, leading
  to direct phosphorylation of R-Smads (Smad2 or Smad3), complex formation with co-Smad
  (Smad4), and induction or repression of target gene expression. Heterozygous inactivating
  mutations in both “positive” and “negative” regulators of this pathway have been
  identified as the cause of genetic disorders that are characterized by pathological
  alterations in the connective tissue due to misregulated expression of TGF-β gene
  targets (i.e., tissue metalloproteinases, collagen, integrins, and several other
  ECM components). The syndromes associated with these mutations, and the human gene
  mutated in each condition, are highlighted in yellow.
