caption: 'A model for the cooperation between FABP5 and PPARβ/δ which enhances prostate
  cell survival and proliferation. Upon binding to a cognate ligand, FABP5 translocates
  to the nucleus where it directly delivers the ligand to its cognate nuclear receptor,
  PPARβ/δ. Activation of PPARβ/δ results in upregulation of FABP5. A positive feedback
  loop is thus established: PPARβ/δ activation induces the expression of FABP5 which,
  in turn, enhances the transcriptional activity of the receptor. The FABP5/PPARβ/δ
  pathway induces the expression of PPARβ/δ target genes involved in cell survival,
  for example, PDK1, and growth and angiogenesis, for example, VEGF, and thus contributes
  to prostate cancer development.'
