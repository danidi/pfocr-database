caption: 'Interaction between neurotrophins and VEGF. Binding of neurotrophins like
  BDNF (brain derived growth factor) and NGF (nerve growth factor) to their respective
  receptors TrkB/A triggers PI-3kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway and leads to increased expression
  of HIF-1α protein expression. Activated mTOR leads to the phosphorylation and activation
  of ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) which in turn known to regulate HIF-1α expression
  at the translational level. HIF-1α then dimerizes with HIF-1β to form HIF complex
  which translocate to the nucleus and binds to hypoxia response elements and leads
  to the increased transcription of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in the
  brain. NGF: Nerve Growth Factor: BDNF: Brain Derived Growth Factor; TrkB/TrkA: Tropomyosin
  receptor kinase B/A; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt: serine/threonine-specific
  protein kinase also called as protein kinase B; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin;
  HIF-1α: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-α; HIF-1β: Hypoxia Inducible Factor-β; p70S6K:
  ribosomal protein S6 kinase; VFGF: Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor'
