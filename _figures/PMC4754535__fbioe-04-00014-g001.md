caption: 'Biosynthetic pathway of dihomomethionine and glucoraphanin in Arabidopsis.
  Glucoraphanin biosynthesis consists of three steps: methionine conversion to dihomomethionine
  (DHM) by two cycles in the chain elongation machinery. Followed by DHM conversion
  into 4-methylthiobutyl glucosinolate (4MTOB) by the core structure pathway, and
  finally conversion of 4MTOB into 4-methylsulfinyl GLS (4MSOB), commonly known as
  glucoraphanin. Structures for intermediates of methionine chain elongation are depicted
  with DHM as the desired intermediate for the formation of glucoraphanin. αKA = α-keto
  acid, methylthio malate intermediates after condensation (1) and after isomerization
  (2). n = number of additional methylene groups in the methionine side chain as a
  result of the condensation reaction in the chain elongation cycle: n = 1 for methionine,
  n = 2 and n = 3 for intermediates from the first and second side-chain elongation
  cycle, respectively.'
