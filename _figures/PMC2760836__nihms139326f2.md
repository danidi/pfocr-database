caption: 'Lipopeptide antigens applied to intravaginal mucosal epithelium are taken
  up by mucosal resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs), especially DCs/pDCs, which
  are activated and migrate out of the mucosal inductive sites into the mucosal effector
  sites of draining lymph nodes where antigen presentation to T cells occurs, resulting
  in a strong local mucosal immune response. The mucosal immunization with a multivalent
  lipopeptide vaccine targeting TLR-2 induces an immune mechanism that bridges innate
  immunity to the ‘asymptomatic’ epitope-specific adaptive T-cell response. DCs are
  activated through recognition of the lipopeptide by TLR-2 receptors molecules. This
  triggered activation of the MyD88-dependent pathway and leads to the production
  of inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6 and TNF-α), and to phenotypic maturation
  of APCs (i.e., upregulation of costimulatory and MHC molecules on DCs surface).
  The multiepitope lipopeptide vaccine is captured, processed and presented by MHC
  molecules on the matured DCs to T lymphocytes (signal 1: MHC/TCR interaction). This
  is not sufficient to activate naive T lymphocytes, which need an additional signal
  from costimulatory molecules (signal 2: B7/CD28), of which expression on DCs is
  induced by TLR-2 stimulation. Activated T lymphocytes become further differentiated
  to effector T lymphocytes by stimulation with cytokines such as IL-12.DC: Dendritic
  cell; HSV: Herpes simplex virus; HTL: Helper T lymphocyte; MyD88: Myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88; pDC: Plasmacytoid dendritic cell; TCR: T-cell receptor;
  TLR: Toll-like receptor.'
