caption: Lipid handling in adipose tissue macrophages in diet-induced obesity.In diet-induced
  obesity, adipose tissue macrophages are metabolically activated by free fatty acids
  (FFA) released by lipolysis of triglycerides from adipocytes or from triglyceride-rich
  lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase, through Cd36 and toll-like receptors. Accumulation
  and storage of lipids in adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) under the form of lipid
  droplets occur through the uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins by specific
  receptors such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDLR) or through the internalization
  of adipocyte-derived exosomes by macropinocytosis. In crown-like structures, necrotic-like
  adipocyte clearance by ATM in acidic lysosomal synapses through a mechanism of exophagy
  also contributes to foam cell formation. As a result, ATMs are characterized by
  an increased content of triglycerides, free cholesterol, ceramides and fatty acids,
  which can either be synthesized into other lipids (See ), be stored in lipid droplets
  or catabolized through the lysosomal pathway. The accumulation of free cholesterol
  and sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin into membrane lipid rafts promotes the recruitment
  of TLR4 at the cell surface and contributes to the activation of inflammatory signaling
  pathways. ABCA1 and ABCG1 transporters promote the efflux of lipids from ATM to
  high-density lipoproteins allowing the reduction in lipid raft formation, thus ensuring
  an optimal lipoprotein lipase activity which participates in foam-like cell formation.
  Fatty acid synthesis, elongation and desaturation are under the control of liver
  X receptor (LXR) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1) thus exerting
  an important role in the relative cellular content of saturated and polyunsaturated
  fatty acids. Increased cellular levels of free cholesterol and saturated fatty acids
  trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress, inflammation and apoptosis, which can be alleviated
  by an enrichment in polyunsaturated fatty acids through mechanisms dependent or
  independent of the GPR120 receptor. Production of eicosanoids and resolvins from
  ω-6 and ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, respectively, induces or represses inflammation
  in ATM. Increased turnover of phosphatidylcholine as well as oxidation of phospholipids
  also participate in the inflammatory status of ATM. As a whole, the rewiring of
  the lipid metabolism in ATM promotes adipose tissue inflammation and contributes
  to the establishment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. ABCA1, ATP-binding
