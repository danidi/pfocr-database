caption: Thrombin-induced ET-1 secretion in RPE is rho/ROCK1/2 dependent. Thrombin-mediated
  PAR-1 activation can simultaneously activate the Gq/11 and G12/13-dependent pathways,
  which in turn activates PLC-dependent IP3/DAG (Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate/diacylglycerol)
  production and Rho activation, respectively. IP3-dependent [Ca2+]i elevation along
  with DAG can activate protein kinase C (PKC) that may influence ET-1 synthesis in
  some cells. We demonstrate that the predominant effect of thrombin on ET-1 production
  in ARPE-19 cells was via the Rho/ROCK1/2-dependent pathway. ROCK1/2 may increase
  ppET-1 mRNA synthesis by activating the GATA family of transcription factors (i.e.,
  GATA-2/4) or by regulating the AP-1 family of transcription factors known to activate
  ppET-1 transcription. The physiological function of ET-1 secreted by the RPE is
  presently unknown. Considering some of the known actions of ET-1, it may mediate
  tissue repair by acting on its receptors in an autocrine manner or cause further
  damage to the neural retina by acting on its receptors in the inner retina.
