caption: Working model of positive and negative regulators of cell death induced by
  ER stressors. In SC medium, ER stressors (e.g., miconazole, dithiothreitol, and
  tunicamycin) activate a signaling pathway involving a mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (Slt2), a Ca2+ channel (Cch1-Mid1), calmodulin (CaM), Cmk2, calcineurin (Cn),
  Crz1, and (very weakly) Frt1/Frt2 (Frt1/2) that either inhibits a prodeath pathway
  or a toxic molecule that is dependent on the function of Hsp90. Direct interactions
  are represented by narrow black arrows, whereas indirect or undefined interactions
  are indicated by gray arrows, the strengths of which are proportional to the thicknesses.
  Pointed arrows indicate stimulatory effects, whereas blunt arrows indicate inhibitory
  effects.
