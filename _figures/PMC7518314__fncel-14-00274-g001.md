caption: Overlap between immune-signaling genes that are associated with pollution
  and SCZ. Of the immune genes that are associated with SCZ, many are also found to
  be altered either in humans or animals exposed to pollutants, offering a genetic
  point of convergence between changes in pollution-mediated inflammatory signaling
  and SCZ. Inflammatory gene expression, including TLR2, TNF-α, MHC, CRP, TLR4, IRF3,
  complement pathway, IL-6, IFN-y, CD14, IL-10, TGF-β are altered in SCZ, while TNF-α,
  TLR4, IL-6, CD14 and IL-1 are altered in SCZ and after exposure to air pollution.
  These genes are specifically enriched in microglia.
