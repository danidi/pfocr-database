caption: 'Models of FEN1 and Dna2 Okazaki fragment substrate recognition and processing.
  (A) hDna2 and hFEN1 substrate recognition model. Pol δ synthesizes until encountering
  the downstream Okazaki fragment RNA/DNA primer. Pol δ then physically separates
  the two strands of the duplex DNA to form a 5′ flap. The active site of the polymerase
  protects a 5–6 nt single-stranded region on the template creating a structure with
  a 5′-displaced flap and a single-stranded gap between the upstream and downstream
  primers, termed a gap-flap. Left arrow: short flap pathway. During short flap processing,
  the polymerase idles back or dissociates from the synthesis fragment allowing the
  5′ flap to re-anneal with the template generating a short double-flap structure.
  hFEN1 binds the double-flap substrate using three contact locations, indicated by
  ‘F’, (i) upstream dsDNA, (ii) downstream dsDNA and (iii) the 3′ 1 nt flap. Right
  arrow: long flap pathway. During long flap processing, flaps escape hFEN1 cleavage.
  hDna2 binds the long gap-flap using two contact locations, indicated by ‘D’, the
  downstream dsDNA and the long 5′ flap. Dna2 threads the long flap and begins cleaving.
  The polymerase idles back or dissociates from the synthesis fragment allowing Dna2
  to continue to cleave the long flap. hDna2 binding affinity for the 5′ flap is reduced
  and it reorients to bind the upstream DNA. This hDna2 reorientation promotes the
  re-annealing of the 5′ flap with the template, filling the single-stranded gap.
  The combination of hDna2 upstream DNA binding and the formation of the double flap
  promote hFEN1 flap base localization. hDna2 releases from the upstream DNA and the
  5′ flap allowing hFEN1 binding contacts with the upstream dsDNA and the 1 nt 3′
  flap. The 5′ flap transitions to hFEN1 and hFEN1 binds the downstream DNA. hFEN1
  is now poised to thread and cleave the substrate and generate a nicked product.
  (B) Long Flap Pathway Model. As in (A), pol δdisplaces the 5′ flap into a 5–6 nt
  gap-flap structure. Flaps escaping hFEN1 cleavage become long and are bound by hRPA.
  hDna2 binds the flap displacing hRPA. hDna2 cleaves the long flap as pol δidles
  back or dissociates from the synthesis fragment. hDna2 reorients promoting 5′ flap
  re-annealing with the template, as shown in (A). The double-flap structure formation
  and hDna2–hFEN1 protein interactions allow hFEN1 to bind the flap base. The reduced
  hDna2-binding affinity for the shortened 5′ flap permits hFEN1 acquisition of the
  flap for threading. hDna2 stimulates the cleavage activity of hFEN1 to create a
  nicked product.'
