caption: Effects of cancer cachexia on skeletal muscle energetic metabolism. This
  schematic representation is only based on animal studies. Reduced glycogen and glucose
  contents in skeletal muscle contribute to alter glycolysis flux. A decrease in mitochondrial
  content and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, together with a decreased in
  ATP synthesis from phosphocreatine system, leads to a reduced ATP content in skeletal
  muscle. Skeletal muscle proteins are degraded and subsequently processed into amino
  acids. Individual amino acids can be either exported outside the muscle fibre or
  transported into the mitochondria (anaplerotic flux). Fatty acid metabolism is not
  represented because there is currently no study available. Black arrows indicate
  variations in metabolite concentration. Dashed arrow indicates experimentally demonstrated
  reduction in the corresponding metabolic pathway. Cr, creatine; G, glucose; G‐1‐P,
  glucose‐1‐phosphate; G‐6‐P, glucose‐6‐phosphate; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation;
  PCr, phosphocreatine; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
