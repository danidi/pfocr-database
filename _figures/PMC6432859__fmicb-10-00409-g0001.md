caption: Schematic of the metabolic interaction of the engineered microbial consortia
  with K. pneumoniae S. oneidensis in a hierarchical way. Lactate was produced by
  K. pneumoniae from glucose and xylose which was fed to S. oneidensis as carbon source
  and electron donor to generate electricity in MFCs. To direct more carbon flux to
  lactate biosynthesis of K. pneumoniae, we eliminated the ethanol and acetate pathway
  via deleting phosphotransacetylase gene (pta) and alcohol dehydrogenase gene (adhE)
  and further constructed a synthesis and delivery system through expressing a lactate
  dehydrogenase gene (ldhD) and a lactate transporter gene (lldP). To increase S.
  oneidensis adhesion to the carbon electrode to compete the surface of electrode
  and further facilitate flavin-mediated electron transfer, a biosynthetic flavins
  pathway (from Bacillus subtilis) was expressed in a highly hydrophobic S. oneidensis
  strain CP-S1.
