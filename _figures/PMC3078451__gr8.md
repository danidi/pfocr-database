caption: New concept of peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) stress. Scheme of mesothelial
  cell monolayer exposed to peritoneal dialysis PDF. The current model of cytotoxic
  damage is extended with the model of sterile inflammation, which is revealed by
  pathway analysis and confirmed in experiments simulating sterile inflammation. Danger
  signals, released from injured cells, lead to sterile inflammation in adjacent cells
  via IL-1 receptor (IL-R)-mediated pathways. This sterile inflammation affects cytoprotective
  responses and exacerbates cell death on PD fluid exposure.
