caption: RhoA regulates, through its downstream effector ROCK (containing ROCK 1 and
  ROCK 2 isoforms) actin filament polymerization and organization, which in turn regulate
  various functions of pericytes. In addition, RhoA (either directly or through ROCK)
  cross talks with Rac1 pathway. There are several inhibitors of ROCK (ROCK 1, ROCK
  2 or both), which are known, from rodent or human clinical studies, to influence
  actin-related cellular functions in immune response and transplantation (, ). Because
  many of pericyte functions such as movement, contractility, interaction with vessel
  endothelium and transdifferentiation into collagen producing myofibroblasts also
  depend on actin cytoskeleton, these inhibitors, via targeting pericytes, have a
  potential to be used as the anti-inflammation and anti-chronic rejection therapeutics.
