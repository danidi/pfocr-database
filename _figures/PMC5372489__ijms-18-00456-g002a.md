caption: 'Schematic diagram of the microRNA-mRNA interaction networks in pancreatic
  islets. The networks are built based on the KEGG pathway map: T2DM pathway (KEGG
  hsa04930) (A); adipocytokine pathway (KEGG hsa04920) (B); and insulin signaling
  pathway (KEGG hsa04910) (C). The genes are indicated by circles and miRNAs by squares.
  For detailed descriptions of node shape, edge size, edge color and arrow shapes
  see inserted legend under (A). The predicted miRNA-mRNA interactions are indicated
  by light blue lines, and the thick blue lines indicate validated miRNA-mRNA interactions.
  Interactions denoted in KEGG pathways were presented as black solid or dotted lines
  indicating direct or indirect interactions, respectively. The identity of genes
  and miRNAs involved in the process are listed, and the colors indicate the expression
  level changes in T2DM islets compared to the control; red indicates a higher level
  in patients; and green represents lower levels compared to the control.'
