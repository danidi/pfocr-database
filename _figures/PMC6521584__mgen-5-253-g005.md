caption: Hypothetical sucrose, sucrose 6-phosphate and sucrose 6F-phosphate metabolic
  pathways in the Ruminococcus gnavus E1, T. thermolyticum and Lactobacillales bacteria
  (adapted from Bruel et al. and Verhaeghe et al. [24, 32]). Pathways for uptake and
  catabolism in the Ruminococcus gnavus E1 clade of (a) S6FP, (b) and (d) sucrose,
  and (c) RFO, and in the lactobacillales bacteria of (e) RFO, and (f) and (g) sucrose.
  The T. thermolyticum S6F P (a) metabolic pathway proposed by Verhaeghe et al., in
  2014, appears in green, whereas the sucrose pathways follow the (f) and (g) models.
