caption: Sanguinarine inhibits growth and invasion and induces apoptosis of gastric
  cancer cells via regulation of the DUSP4/ERK pathway. The graph located in the ceiling
  position represents lipid bilayer membranes. The molecular formula represents sanguinarine.
  The blue oval represents DUSP4 protein. The green oval below represents ERK protein.
