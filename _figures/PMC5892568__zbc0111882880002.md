caption: 'Overview of biosynthetic routes to biopolymers. The main steps in the microbial
  biosynthetic routes for cellulose, alginate, chitin, chitosan, and hyaluronan from
  glucose are briefly depicted. The solid arrow represents an enzymatic step, and
  the broken arrow represents a multistep pathway that includes a number of enzymatic
  steps. The yellow circle represents the starting material, glucose; gray circles
  represent intermediate metabolites; red circles represent a sugar nucleotide; and
  blue, orange, purple, and green circles represent product biopolymer molecules.
  Abbreviations used are as follows: AcCoA, acetyl coenzyme-A; BC, bacterial cellulose;
  F6P, fructose 6-phosphate; G1P, glucose 1-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; GDP-Man,
  GDP-mannose; GDP-ManA, GDP-mannuronic acid; GlcN-6-P, glucosamine 6-phosphate; GlcNAc-1-P,
  N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate; GlcNAc-6-P, N-acetylglucosamine 6-phosphate; M1P,
  mannose 1-phosphate; M6P, mannose 6-phosphate; OAA, oxaloacetate; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid; UDP-Glc, UDP-glucose; UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine; UDP-GlcUA, UDP-glucuronic
  acid.'
