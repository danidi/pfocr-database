caption: Six genes, AACT, HMGS, HMGRt, MVK, PMK, and PMD (in red font and inside a
  dotted rectangle, ) encoding yeast MEV pathway were integrated into the chloroplast
  genome using a biolistic approach to generate an elevated IPP pool. Six genes (ADS,
  CYP71AV1, AACPR, DBR2, IDI, and FPP) of the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway were
  integrated into the nuclear genome of homoplastomic plants () using vector pNuc-cox-ART.
  Subcellular targeting of DBR2, AACPR, and CYP71AV1 were mediated by a chloroplast
  transit peptide (). Dihydroartemisinic acid (DHAA) converts itself to artemisinin
  via photochemical oxidation, a non-enzymatic reaction. AACT, acetoacetyl CoA thiolase;
  HMGS, HMGCoA synthase; HMGRt, C-terminal truncated HMGCoA reductase; MVK, mevalonate
  kinase; PMK, phosphomevalonate kinase; PMD, mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase;
  DXP, 1-Deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate; MEP, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate; IPP,
  isopentenyl diphosphate; IDI, IPP isomerase; DMAPP, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate;
  ADS, amorphadiene synthase; FPP, farnesyl diphosphate; CYP71AV1, amorpha-4,11-diene
  C-12 oxidase; AACPR, Artemisia annua cytochrome P450 reductase; DBR2, double bond
  reductase2.
