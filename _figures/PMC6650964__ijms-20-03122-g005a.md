caption: Network analysis of the differentially expressed proteins between the Dex-treated
  and control rats identified by the IPA (ingenuity pathway analysis). (A) Brain network
  pathway converged on the central signaling pathway involving extracellular signal–regulated
  kinases (ERK1/2), janus kinase (Jnk), and Akt. The network with the highest score
  related to cell morphology, nervous system development, and function and neurological
  disease (score = 38). (B) Heart network pathway identified the involvement of Akt
  and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) signaling pathways. The network with
  the highest score related to cellular development, cellular function and maintenance,
  and connective tissue development and function (score = 43). (C) Skeletal muscle
  network pathway identified with the highest scoring network (score = 50) related
  to nucleic acid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and vitamins and mineral
  metabolism. (D) Liver network pathway was identified with the highest scoring network
  (score = 41) related to lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and nucleic
  acid metabolism. (E) Kidney network pathway was identified with the highest scoring
  network (score = 41) related to drug metabolism, organism injury, and abnormalities
  and renal damage. Nodes in green and red correspond to down- and upregulated proteins,
  respectively. Non-colored nodes were proposed by IPA and suggest potential targets
  functionally coordinated with the differential proteins. Solid lines indicate direct
  molecular interactions and dashed lines represent indirect relationships.
