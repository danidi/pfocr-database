caption: Molecular Mechanisms of Auxin and Cytokinin Interaction in the Regulation
  of Plant Meristem Development.(A) In CZ of shoot meristem, ARR7 and ARR15 act as
  integrative factors in auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways. Auxin represses the
  expression of ARR7 and ARR15 while cytokinin promotes their expression through a
  STM-dependent pathway. Both of them regulate the expression of WUS in a negative
  feedback loop, critical for stem-cell formation. During the formation of lateral
  organ primordia, a high level of auxin transported from CZ blocks the biosynthesis
  of cytokinin by suppressing KNOXI function in PZ. CZ, central zone; PZ, peripheral
  zone; P0/P1, organ primordia.(B) Auxin is transported from the shoot apex to repress
  cytokinin biosynthesis, leading to the inhibition of axillary bud growth.(C) In
  the root meristem, auxin promotes the expression of PINs through the degradation
  of SHY2 proteins, resulting in the maintenance of an auxin gradients and cell division.
  In contrast, cytokinin impedes the expression of PINs by stimulating the expression
  of SHY2, leading to auxin redistribution and cell differentiation. Auxin also plays
  an important role in the differentiation of root DSC by mediating the expression
  of WOX5 and PLT. PM, proximal meristem; EDZ, elongation differentiation zone; TZ,
  transition zone; DSC, distal stem cell.(D) In certain xylempole pericycle cells,
  the transport and perception of auxin trigger an asymmetric cell division critical
  for the LR initiation and LRP patterning. By contrast, cytokinin negatively regulates
  the LR initiation and LRP patterning by inhibiting the expression of PINs and the
  auxin distribution gradients. LR, lateral roots; LRP, lateral root primordia.
