caption: 'cGAS-STING pathway. a Three-dimensional structure of cGAS-dsDNA complex.
  b Three-dimensional structure of STING. The above structures were presented by PyMOL
  Molecular Graphics System. c cGAS-STING pathway. Cytosolic DNA sensor could be activated
  by exogenous DNA derived from bacteria, virus, or damaged/dying tumor cell. In addition,
  cGAS could sense endogenous chromosomal fragments, as well as DNA leakage from micronuclei
  and mitochondria. cGAS directly binds to tumor-derived dsDNA and subsequently catalyzes
  the production of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Following the stimulation of cGAMP, the
  conformation of STING molecule is changed from monomer to dimers. Then, STING dimers
  are translocated to perinuclear microsome from ER via Golgi apparatus. STING could
  recruit and activate TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) which further phosphorylates interferon
  regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3) and upregulates the expression of type
  I IFN. In addition, STING could activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway by binding to IκB kinase (IKK) and NF-κB-inducing
  kinase (NIK). Activated NF-κB pathway collaborates with TBK1-IRF3 pathway to induce
  the expression of type I IFN. Abbreviations: cGAMP, cyclic GMP-AMP; ER, endoplasmic
  reticulum; IKK, IκB kinase; IRF3, interferon regulatory transcription factor 3;
  MIT, mitochondria; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; TBK1, TANK-binding kinase 1'
