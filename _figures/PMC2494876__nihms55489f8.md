caption: Flow diagram illustrating 14-3-3/Bad interaction. By controlling the subcellular
  localization and function of Bad in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, 14-3-3 proteins
  constitute an important regulatory pathway of RGC death signaling during glaucomatous
  neurodegeneration. Although phosphorylated Bad normally remains sequestered in the
  cytoplasm by 14-3-3 scaffold, phosphorylation of 14-3-3 and dephosphorylation of
  Bad in ocular hypertensive eyes lead to translocation of this proapoptotic protein
  to mitochondria. Findings of this study support that the maintenance of the 14-3-3/Bad
  interaction in the cytoplasm by treatments inhibiting 14-3-3 phosphorylation and
  Bad dephosphorylation may increase RGC survival in ocular hypertensive eyes.
