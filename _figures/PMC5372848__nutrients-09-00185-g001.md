caption: Activation of the RAS/ERK and phosphoinositide cell signaling pathways following
  the binding of cell survival signals to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). The two
  pathways are triggered by the activation of RTK in the cell membrane. After the
  binding of RTK by cell survival signals, the RTK intracellular domain is phosphorylated
  and (A) through several steps it allows the binding and activation of RAS. Consequently,
  RAF, the first MAPK in this pathway, is recruited and activated and, in turn, it
  phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2, which finally activates ERK1/2 by the dual
  phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine. In turn, ERK activates a variety of substrates
  placed downwards that ultimately induce cell proliferation and survival; (B) PI3K
  is associated with the intracellular domain of RTK and activated to catalyze the
  PIP2 phosphorylation into PIP3 that recruits AKT. In this form, AKT can be activated
  by the dual phosphorylation carried out respectively by PDK1 and mTORC2. Activated
  AKT regulates the activities of downstream targets that ultimately lead to the induction
  of cell proliferation and survival. PTEN may regulate this pathway by dephosphorylating
  PIP3. See the text for more details regarding the components and reactions of the
  two signaling pathways.

  description: Activation of the RAS/ERK and phosphoinositide cell signaling pathways
    following the binding of cell survival signals to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK).
    The two pathways are triggered by the activation of RTK in the cell membrane.
    After the binding of RTK by cell survival signals, the RTK intracellular domain
    is phosphorylated and (A) through several steps it allows the binding and activation
    of RAS. Consequently, RAF, the first MAPK in this pathway, is recruited and activated
    and, in turn, it phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2, which finally activates
    ERK1/2 by the dual phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine. In turn, ERK activates
    a variety of substrates placed downwards that ultimately induce cell proliferation
    and survival; (B) PI3K is associated with the intracellular domain of RTK and
    activated to catalyze the PIP2 phosphorylation into PIP3 that recruits AKT. In
    this form, AKT can be activated by the dual phosphorylation carried out respectively
    by PDK1 and mTORC2. Activated AKT regulates the activities of downstream targets
    that ultimately lead to the induction of cell proliferation and survival. PTEN
    may regulate this pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3. See the text for more details
    regarding the components and reactions of the two signaling pathways.
