caption: GNE catalyzes the first two steps of this pathway. The respective enzymatic
  reactions are indicated in bold. Note, that UDP-GlcNAc is supplied from fructose-6-phosphate
  by the hexosamine pathway, and that CMP-Neu5Ac is formed in the nucleus. Feed-back
  inhibition of the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase activity of GNE by CMP-Neu5Ac is further
  indicated.
