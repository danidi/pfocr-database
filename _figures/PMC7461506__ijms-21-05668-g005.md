caption: A model of CBL-CIPK pathway during stimuli. CBLs combine with the Ca2+ increased
  by stimuli, and activate the CIPKs in response to relevant stresses. The solid lines
  represent the classical Ca2+/CBL-CIPK signaling. The atypical function of CBLs and
  the target protein PP2C are shown with dotted lines.
