caption: Schematic pathway of the hypothetical role of the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) in
  homeostasis balance. In physiological situations, the specific localization of the
  P2X7R in the membrane, near finetuned adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-released structures
  and distant from ATP-degrading enzymes, could provide a small extracellular concentration
  of ATP which are not enough for the activation of the receptor. However, this activation
  can take place in the presence of a positive allosteric modulator (M) binding to
  different domains of the receptor. This will facilitate the selective flux of ions
  through the P2X7R channel, thus inducing a transduction pathway which could lead
  to a cellular homeostasis response without inducing necessarily cellular damage.
