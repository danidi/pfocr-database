caption: Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) is a heterodimer consisting of p85 and p110
  subunits. PI3K becomes activated when phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK),
  or adapter proteins (P), bind to p85. K-RAS is also able to activate PI3K. Once
  PI3K is activated, the p110 catalytic subunit converts phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Akt binds to PIP3 in
  the plasma membrane and becomes activated. Akt is then able to activate mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) by blocking the ability of TSC2 to inhibit mTOR
