caption: Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are nuclear
  receptors able to function as ligand-activated transcription factors through binding
  to retinoic acid DNA response elements (RARE). Upon ligand (at-RA) binding, RAR/RXRs
  release co-repressors (CoRs) and recruit co-activators (CoAs). This figure shows
  possible mechanisms by which RA binding to its nuclear receptors can affect the
  induction of Foxp3 and IL-17. A. RA could enhance TGF-β signaling via the TGF-β
  signaling molecules, Smad2 and 3 and SBE (Smad-binding elements) and thus indirectly
  increase TGF-β-dependent Foxp3 induction. In contrast, RA may also repress different
  target genes in the TH17-development pathway, including STAT3, RORγt and IL-17.
  Conversely, the suppression of these molecules could also result in enhanced TGF-β
  induced Foxp3 expression. B. The induction of Foxp3 expression in naïve T cells
  requires both TGF-β signaling and IL-2-dependent STAT5 phosphorylation and binding
  in the Foxp3 promoter. C. STAT5 and RAR interaction may lead to coordinated transcription
  activity of target genes, therefore enhancing TGF-β-induced Foxp3 expression. D.
  IL-4 is able to inhibit TGF-β-mediated Foxp3 induction via IL-4 receptor activated
  STAT6, which directly binds to the Foxp3 promoter. RA binding to RARα/RXRα heterodimers
  can interfere with the silencing capacity of STAT6 resulting in increased Foxp3
  induction.
