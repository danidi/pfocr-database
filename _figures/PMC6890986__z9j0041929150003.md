caption: 'Mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway can
  be triggered by diverse extracellular and intracellular stress stimuli. The central
  event in the execution of this pathway is permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial
  membrane (OMM), which is tightly regulated by the B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family
  proteins. These are divided into three subfamilies according to their function and
  BCL-2 homology (BH) domains: 1) pro-survival proteins, including BCL-2, BCL-2-like-1
  long form (BCL-xL), and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1); 2) multidomain pro-cell
  death proteins, including BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and BCL-2 antagonist/killer
  1 (BAK); and 3) pro-cell death BH3-only proteins, which are further subdivided into
  “activators” and “sensitizers.” Activator BH3-only proteins [BCL-2-interacting domain
  death agonist (BID), BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM), p53 upregulated
  modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), and perhaps phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced
  protein 1 (NOXA)] directly bind and conformationally activate BAX and BAK. Conversely,
  the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins oppose these events both through sequestering the
  activator BH3-only proteins and through interacting with and inhibiting BAX and
  BAK. Sensitizer BH3-only proteins [BCL-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD), BCL-2-interacting
  killer (BIK), BCL-2-modifying factor (BMF), and Harakiri (HRK)] indirectly activate
  BAX and BAK through binding the pro-survival BCL-2 proteins, which both displaces
  the activator BH3-only proteins as well as prevents the pro-survival proteins from
  binding and neutralizing BAX and BAK. Activation of BAX and BAK drives their homo-
  and hetero-oligomerization within the OMM. This results in membrane permeabilization
  and release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria, including cytochrome c, second
  mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC)/direct inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)
  binding protein with low PI (DIABLO), and OMI/high temperature requirement protein
  A2 (OMI/HtrA2). The binding of cytochrome c and dATP to Apaf-1 promotes formation
  of the apoptosome, in which procaspase-9 is activated. Caspase-9 subsequently activates
  downstream procaspases including -3 and -7. IAPs bind and inhibit procaspase-9 and
  active caspases-3 and -7. SMAC/DIABLO and OMI/HtrA2 bind and inhibit IAPs resulting
  in activation of caspases. Caspase-8 can also cleave and activate BID (tBID), allowing
  tBID to bind and activate BAX, thereby linking the death receptor and mitochondrial
  apoptosis pathways.'
