caption: 'Mechanisms of autoinflammatory disease regulated by IL-1β (inflammasomopathies)
  and NF-κB. The NLRP3 protein interacts with ASC and caspase-1 to form a complex
  termed the inflammasome, which is a macromolecular complex that processes IL-1β
  into its active form. Mutations (denoted by asterisks) in proteins that affect the
  function of this complex such as pyrin, PSTPIP1, mevalonate kinase (MK), and NLRP7
  thus represent extrinsic inflammasomopathies. Mutations in NLRP3 clearly activate
  the molecule; however, the precise mechanism by which pyrin and PSTPIP1 mutations
  regulate inflammasome activity has not been determined. As NLRP7 is a negative regulator
  of IL-1β production, these mutations are likely to inactivate the protein, and it
  has been shown that MK mutations are also loss of function, although the pathway
  that leads from these mutations to Rac1/PI3K/PKB activation is not yet formally
  described. Preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that mutations in the IL-1
  receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) cause another extrinsic inflammasomopathy. For NF-κB
  activation disorders, NOD2 could become activated by mutations that may relieve
  autorepression of the molecule; however, there are also persuasive data showing
  that mutations inactivate the protein from tolerizing the host to the bacterial
  cell wall component muramyl dipeptide (MDP). NLRP12 is a negative regulator of NF-κB,
  and thus a proinflammatory disease would be caused by what appear to be loss-of-function
  mutations. Abbreviations used: CPPD, calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate; Aβ, amyloid-β;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; PKB, protein kinase B.'
