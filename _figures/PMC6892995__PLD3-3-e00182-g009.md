caption: Proposed model on lipid metabolism in Arabidopsis atacbp6 developing seeds.
  Proposed changes in the lipid metabolic network are displayed. PC‐derived DAG production
  (yellow box) and the Kennedy pathway (green box) represent two routes for DAG biosynthesis
  (Bates, ). In atacbp6, LPCAT1 and PLA2α were upregulated (Figure ), boosting reversible
  LPCAT activity (purple arrow) with decrease in PC (blue arrowhead) and increase
  in LPC (red arrowhead) (Figure ). Given that 18:2 (open red arrow) increased at
  the cost of 20:1 (open green arrow), leading to reduction of C58‐TAGs (open blue
  arrow), and one possibility might be that the increased reverse LPCAT1 activity
  and/or PLA2α activity had higher preference to 18:2 on PC, thus leading to more
  18:2 for TAG synthesis. G3P, glycerol‐3‐phosphate; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine;
  LPCAT, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase; DAG, diacylglycerol; PC, phosphatidylcholine;
  PLA, phospholipase A; and TAG, triacylglycerol
