caption: Consequences of the genetic manipulation of IKKβ on the metabolic phenotype
  of mice. Constitutive activation of IKKβ (CA IKKβ) in hepatocytes results in a deterioration
  of the insulin sensitivity of lean mice. At the opposite constitutive activation
  of IKKβ in adipocytes protects the mice against obesity and insulin resistance when
  fed a high-fat diet. Study of heterozygote IKKβ mice (IKKβ+/-) or of mice with a
  tissue specific inactivation of IKKβ in the central nervous system (CNS), hepatocytes,
  myeloid cells, or muscles demonstrates that activation of IKKβ/NF-κB pathway is
  a core mechanism that connects metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance in
  peripheral metabolic tissues, except muscles, and in the central nervous system.
