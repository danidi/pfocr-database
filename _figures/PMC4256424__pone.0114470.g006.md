caption: 'Dexamethasone interacts with the glucocorticoids receptor (GR) in the cytoplasm,
  promotes the translocation of GR into the nucleus, and increases L-PGDS expression,
  which stimulates conversion of PGH2 to PGD2. PGD2 then binds to DP1 receptor (DP1R)
  and initiates a series of intracellular signaling pathways, of which MEK1/pERK1
  function as the major downstream effectors. Upregulation of pERK1 confers dexamethasone
  pretreatment-induced neuroprotective effects in neonatal HI brain insult. Inhibition
  of L-PGDS, PGD2 or MEK1 via correspondent inhibitors (SeCl4, MK-0524 or PD98059)
  thus inhibits dexamethasone-induced neuroprotection, suggesting the interaction
  of glucocorticoids/GR and L-PGDS-PGD2-DP1-pERK signaling pathway underpinning the
  neuroprotective effect of dexamethasone on neonatal HI brain injury. GR: glucocorticoid
  receptor; L-PGDS: lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase; PGH2: prostaglandin H2;
  PGD2: prostaglandin D2; DP1: D prostanoid; MEK1: mitogen-activated kinase/ERK kinase
  1; pERK-42/44: phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 42/44; SeCl4:
  selenium chloride, a selective inhibitor of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase
  (L-PGDS); PD98059: a selective inhibitor of MEK1; MK-0524: a selective antagonist
  for prostaglandin D2 receptor (DP1).'
