caption: Model of regulation of BK channel activity by AKAP150 in diabetes. In diabetes,
  AKAP150 binds to Akt directly or indirectly, resulting in decreased phosphorylation
  levels of Akt at the Ser473 site. GSK3β is downstream of Akt. p‐GSK3β, which is
  the same as p‐Akt473, decreases. In addition, the GSK3β level increases in the nucleus,
  which damages the activity of the BK channel
