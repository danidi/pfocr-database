caption: Schematic representation of the sphingolipid rheostat in AD context. Ceramide
  can be generated de novo or by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinase.
  Ceramide is subsequently metabolized by ceramidase to generate sphingosine which
  in turn produces sphingosine 1-phosphate through phosphorylation by sphingosine
  kinase-1 and sphingosine kinase-2. All these reactions are reversible. Sphingosine
  1-phosphate can be catabolized into hexadecenal + phospho-ethanolamine by the action
  of sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase. Sphingosine 1-phosphate exerts intracellular signaling
  which can promote, calcium mobilization, epigenetic modulation and survival effects.
  S1P has also extracellular effects by signaling through 5 G protein-coupled receptors.
  The agonist FTY720 can bind S1P1,3,4,5. IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling pathway is able to
  activate SphK1, inducing its translocation to the plasma membrane. In AD, Aβ peptide
  is able to upregulate sphingomyelinase activity which consequently increases the
  level of ceramide. In turn, ceramide stabilizes BACE-1 which increases APP cleavage
  leading to generation of Aβ peptide []. S1P level as IGF-1R level are decreased
  in AD []. SMSyn, sphingomyelin synthase; SMase, sphingomyelinase; Cerase, ceramidase;
