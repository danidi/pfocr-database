caption: 'Pathways for the supraspinal processing of pain superimposed on key elements
  of addiction circuitry implicated in negative emotional states. Blue structures
  are involved in the “fast” processing of pain via the spinothalamic tract and arrive
  indirectly at the amygdala. Pink structures are involved in the “fast” processing
  of pain via the spinal-parabrachial-amygdala pathway and arrive directly at the
  amygdala. Yellow structures are involved in the “slower” cognitive processing of
  pain. Addiction circuitry is composed of structures involved in the three stages
  of the addiction cycle: binge/intoxication (ventral striatum, dorsal striatum, thalamus),
  withdrawal/negative affect (ventral striatum, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis,
  central nucleus of the amygdala; red structures), preoccupation/anticipation (prefrontal
  cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus). Notice significant overlap of the supraspinal
  processing of pain and addiction in the amygdala. Modified with permission from
  [] and []. ACC = anterior cingulate cortex; AMG = amygdala; BNST = bed nucleus of
  the stria terminalis; DRG = dorsal root ganglion; DS = dorsal striatum; GP = globus
  pallidus; Hippo = hippocampus; Hyp = hypothalamus; Insula = insular cortex; OFC
  = orbitofrontal cortex; PAG = periaqueductal grey; PB = parabrachial nucleus; PFC
