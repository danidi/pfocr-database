caption: 'Alteration of IDH metabolic pathway in oncogenesis. IDH1 catalyzes oxidative
  decarboxylation of isocitrate to α‐ketoglutarate as part of normal mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation. One molecule of NADP+ is reduced to NADPH in the process.
  Mutant IDH1 performs this same conversion to a lesser degree, but also catalyzes
  conversion of α‐KG to 2‐HG, an oncometabolite. 2‐HG inhibition of α‐KG‐dependent
  reactions leads to increased DNA and histone methylation by inhibition of histone
  demethylases and impaired cell differentiation.Abbreviations: 2‐HG, 2‐hydroxyglutarate;
  α‐KG, α‐ketoglutarate; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; mIDH, mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase.'
