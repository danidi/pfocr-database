caption: Isoprenoids are synthesized from the mevalonate pathway that starts from
  reaction catalyzed by the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (the
  rate-limiting reaction in cholesterol biosynthesis) which catalyzes the conversion
  of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. The pathway triggered by this reaction can lead to
  the synthesis of a key isoprenoid molecule, the farnesyl-pyrophosphate (Farnesyl-PP),
  whose formation is catalyzed by the farnesylpyrophosphate synthase (FPPS). Farnesyl-PP
  can be either converted by a series of reactions in cholesterol or can be transferred
  on target cellular proteins as Farnesyl-PP itself (reaction catalyzed by farnesyltransferase,
  FTase) or firstly converted in geranyl-geranyl-pyrophosphate (Geranyl-Geranyl-PP)
  and then transferred on cellular proteins by type I or type II geranylgeranyl-transferase
  (GGTase). FTase and GGTase-I catalyze the prenylation of substrates with a carboxy-terminal
  tetrapeptide sequence called a CAAX box, where C refers to cysteine, A refers to
  an aliphatic residue, and X typically refers to methionine, serine, alanine, or
  glutamine for FTase or to leucine for GGTase-I. Following prenylation of physiological
  substrates, the terminal three residues (AAX) are subsequently removed by a CAAX
  endoprotease, and the carboxyl group of the terminal cysteine is methyl esterified
  by a methyltransferase. At this moment prenyl substrates, such as Ras, are ready
  to be located on the inner side of the biological membranes to receive signals mediated
  by external factors. ZOL specifically inhibits the FPPS activity required for the
  synthesis of farnesyl and geranylgeranyl lipidic residues blocking prenylation of
  Ras that regulates the proliferation, invasive properties, and proangiogenic activity
  of human tumour cells.
