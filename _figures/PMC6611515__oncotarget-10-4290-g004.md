caption: 'Differentially expressed genes obtained by RNA-seq in the ERG-inducible
  LnTE3 cells were analyzed using IPA. Canonical pathway analysis revealed several
  significantly deregulated pathways including: (A) Cell Cycle Control of Chromosomal
  Replication and (B) Estrogen-Mediated S-phase Entry. Majority of the focus molecules
  are present in the differentially expressed genes. Significantly up-regulated gene
  are indicated in red and down-regulated genes are in green, and those present within
  our data set but not significant are shown in grey. Arrows indicate gene products
  which were found to be oppositely regulated.'
