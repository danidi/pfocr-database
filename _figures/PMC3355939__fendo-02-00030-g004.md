caption: Model of differential activation of signaling pathways by growth hormone
  receptor (GHR) subtypes. JAK2 activation is essential for propagation of signaling
  from both GHR1 and GHR2 to the ERK, PI3K/Akt, and STAT5 pathways (details of pathway
  elements are omitted for simplicity). Cross-talk occurs between the ERK and PI3K/Akt
  pathways, possibly through Akt activation of c-Raf in the ERK pathway.

  Receptor Subtypes of a Teleost Fish (Oncorhynchus Mykiss).
