caption: 'Rationale for targeting both the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  pathways for suppressing cancer growth. (a) The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
  pathways are both activated by upstream receptor ligation and frequently co-regulate
  many downstream targets in parallel. Thus for effective elimination of many cancers
  or prevention of aging, it may be necessary to target both signaling pathways. Activation
  of these pathways could also result in increased transcription of many genes that
  promote cellular growth and malignant transformation. (b) Inhibition of mTOR can
  result in the induction of autophagy, which is a very important mechanism of cell
  death, especially in solid tumors. (c) As described previously, both the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK
  and Ras/PI3K/ PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways regulate the activity of apoptotic proteins
  by post-translational mechanisms. Targeting this pathway may also contribute to
  the induction of apoptosis. Signaling molecules promoting phosphorylation events
  are indicated in green. Stimulatory signaling events are indicted in green lines
  with a green arrow before the target of the phophorylation. Small-molecule inhibitors
  are indicated in red. Inhibitory phosphorylation events are indicated in red lines
  with a block on the end before the target of the inhibition. Inhibitory signaling
  or proapoptotic molecules or inactivated molecules are indicated in yellow. A growth
  factor and a growth factor receptor are indicated in purple. Active transcription
  factors are indicated in purple diamonds. Inactivated transcription factors are
  indicated in yellow diamonds. (Reproduced with permission: Chappell WH, Steelman
