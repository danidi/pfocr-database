caption: The lipid A core-subunit of LPS is flipped across the inner membrane (IM)
  by MsbA after its synthesis on the cytoplasmic side. Following the attachment of
  O-antigen on the periplasmic surface (not shown), LPS is delivered to the outer
  membrane (OM) through a complex of LPS transport proteins (Lpt A-G). The chemical
  structure of the hexa-acylated lipid A from E. coli or S. typhimurium with core
  sugar units attached to the 6′-hydroxy group of the lipid A glucosamine unit is
  shown on the right.
