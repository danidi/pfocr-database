caption: Schematic model illustrating the role of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 in mediating the effect
  of dietary K+ intake on NaCl cotransporter (NCC) activity and how ion transport
  is altered in the response to dietary K+ intake to mediate sodium and potassium
  homeostasis. High K+ intake (green arrow or symbol) decreases Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channel
  activity, which subsequently inhibits the WNK-SPAK pathway and NCC activity in the
  early distal convoluted tubule (DCT1) cells. The sodium reabsorption and potassium
  excretion rates increase along the downstream segments. AT2R, angiotensin II type
  2 receptor; BK2R, bradykinin type 2 receptor; MR, mineralocorticoid receptor. The
  dotted line indicates diminished effects.
