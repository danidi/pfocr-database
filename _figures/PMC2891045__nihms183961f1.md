caption: A) In the p53-ARF-MDM2 pathway in cancer, oncogenes transcriptionally induce
  ARF, which binds and inhibits MDM2, leading to stabilization of p53. In two feedback
  loops, p53 positively regulates MDM2 transcription, and negatively regulates ARF
  transcription.B) In the p53-ARF axis in autophagy, p53 and ARF positively regulate
  autophagy in stressed cells. In contrast, in the unstressed cell, p53 negatively
  regulates ARF via transcriptional repression, and it also negatively regulates autophagy.
