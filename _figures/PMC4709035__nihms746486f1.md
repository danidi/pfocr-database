caption: Pathophysiology of Cardiac Toxicity from Various Chemotherapeutics and Role
  of Preventative Therapies. Alkylating agents inhibit DNA transcription, impairing
  protein synthesis. Human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2/ErbB)-targeted therapy inhibits
  the activation of HER2 resulting in the inhibition of a signal transduction pathway
  that ultimately impairs DNA transcription. Anthracyclines intercalate into DNA,
  impairing protein synthesis, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in
  DNA damage as well as inhibit topoisomerase II-beta (Top2B), impairing DNA repair.
  Taxanes impair microtubule function needed for cell division. Vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF)-inhibitors blocks the activation of kinases resulting in the
  downstream inhibition of angiogenesis. Dexrazoxane, an iron-chelating agent may
  decrease the formation of ROS through prevention of anthracycline-iron complex formation
  as well as inhibit the formation of Top2B–DNA cleavage complexes which impair DNA
  repair. Beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I),
  through anti-oxidant properties, may inhibit the production of ROS. ACE-I’s may
  decrease angiotensin-induced blockade of the neuregulin-1 (NRG-1)/ErbB pathway.
  Statins have also been shown to inhibit Top2B–mediated DNA damage. The various cellular
  effects of these chemotherapy agents may ultimate result in cardiovascular manifestations
  in the form of left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.
