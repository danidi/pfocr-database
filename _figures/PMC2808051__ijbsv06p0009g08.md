caption: The C. elegans pathway of mTOR production is dependent on insulin/IGF response.
  TOR homologs DAF-15 (Raptor) and LET-363 (TOR) are regulated by DAF-16 (FoxO) transcription
  factors which are also responsible for entry into dauer. A. Shows high nutrient
  conditions, with insulin signaling, through active AGE-1(PI3K) and AKT phosphorylating
  DAF-16, impeding its entry into the nucleus and allowing transcription of the TOR
  genes. B. When phosphorylation of AKT is blocked by DAF-18 (PTEN), DAF-16 is able
  to enter the nucleus, and can inhibit the transcription of TOR genes.
