caption: 'Left: In fibrotic lung, we find persistent myofibroblast activation in fibrotic
  plaques and JUN upregulation. JUN expression in fibrosis-associated fibroblasts
  (FAFs) appears to directly control the promoters and enhancers of CD47 and CD274
  (PD-L1). The direct consequence is increased expression of these immune-checkpoint
  proteins in fibroblasts and dormant macrophages which do not phagocytose, but continue
  to release chronic inflammatory cytokines. JUN also directly regulates IL-6 at the
  chromatin level. The increased expression and secretion of this potent cytokine
  leads to a suppressive adaptive immune response-chiefly T-cell exhaustion and upregulation
  of regulatory T cells. Right: Disrupting the suppression of the innate and adaptive
  immunity with CD47 and PD-L1 inhibitors as well as the proinflammatory IL-6 cytokine
  pathway stimulated phagocytic removal of pro-fibrotic fibroblasts and T-cell activation
  leading to clearance of the fibrosis in the lung.'
