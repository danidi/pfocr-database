caption: 'Functional study of rs9340803. (A) Relative luciferase activity assay performed
  with 293T cell line (repeated four times). Firefly luciferase expression was normalized
  using activity of renilla luciferase. Ratio of the normalized firefly luciferase
  expression to that of control was used to represent relative luciferase activity.
  Data represented the mean+s.d. (B) Postulated pathway diagram of estradiol-ER-cholesterol-Aβ
  formation cycle. Cholesterol-originated estrogen binds to ERα and regulates key
  enzymes in the cholesterol metabolism. Decreased ESR1 expression caused by rs9340803
  A to G variation may disrupt the balance of adequate cholesterol content in the
  cytoplasm and on the cytomembrane of neuron as a result of decreased ERα activity
  on those key enzymes, promoting more Aβ production. Red line indicates the direct
  effect of estrogen ligand and Erα through BACE and black line refers to indirect
  effect by rugulation of cholesterol content. DHEA: dehydroepiandrosterone; StAR:
  steroidogenic acute regulatory protein; TSPO: translocator protein; ARO: aromatase.'
