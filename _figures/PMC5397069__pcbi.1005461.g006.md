caption: 1. Upon substrate overload with cytosolic palmitoyl-CoA, MCKAT’s ketoacyl-CoA
  substrates start to accumulate. 2. The unfavourable equilibrium constant of the
  preceding enzyme, medium/short-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, works as an
  amplifier, leading to the accumulation of upstream CoA esters, including acyl-CoA
  esters. 3. These acyl-CoA esters are at the same time products of MCKAT and inhibit
  its already low activity further. 4. Finally, the accumulation of CoA esters leads
  to a sequestration of free CoA. CoA being a cofactor for MCKAT, its sequestration
  limited the MCKAT activity even further, thus completing the vicious cycle. 5. Since
  CoA is also a substrate for distant enzymes (such as MTP), it efficiently communicates
  the ‘traffic jam’ at MCKAT to the entire pathway.
