caption: In gastric smooth muscle, melatonin interacts with MT1 receptors, which is
  coupled to stimulation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC-β) via
  Gq. Stimulation of PLC-β activity results in the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3) and IP3-dependent Ca2+ release leading to muscle contraction.
