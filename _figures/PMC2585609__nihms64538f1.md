caption: A schematic representation of the functional domains of Stim and Orai proteins.
  a Stim proteins contain an EF-hand Ca2+ binding motif, a sterile-alpha-motif (SAM),
  glycosylation sites, 1 transmembrane domain (TM), a coiled-coil region, an ezrin–radixin–myosin-like
  domain (ERM), a serine/proline-rich region (SP), and a polylysine rich region (Lys).
  b Schematic representation of a functional STIM1 protein in the ER membrane. c Functional
  domains of Orai include four transmembrane domains (TM), with its N- and C-termini
  facing the cytoplasmic side. In addition, Orai1 includes a proline-rich domain in
  its N-terminus and a reported coiled-coil sequence in the C-terminus []. d Schematic
  representation of a subunit protein of Orai1 in the PM. The functional Orai1 protein
  channel might be an association of four subunits to form tetramers
