caption: ROS involved in vegetative apical meristem identity in the shoot apical meristem.
  WUS, WUSCHEL, a regulator maintaining stem cell identity in shoot apical meristem.  and
  H2O2 activate and repress WUS activity to balance stem cell identity and differentiation,
  respectively. DCC1, a functional thioredoxin that inhibits the accumulation of ROS
  in the cell, and creates conditions for SAM formation. TCP, TEOSINTE BRANCHED/CYCLOIDEA/PCF,
  a transcriptional regulator of the cell cycle, is inhibited by higher ROS levels
  in the SAM. TCPox (TCP in oxidated state)/TCPred (TCP in reduced state) can be regulated
  by GRX (Glutaredoxin). FtSH4 (also named AtFTSH4), an ATP-dependent mitochondrial
  protease, associated with internal oxidative stress and mitochondrial function in
  the SAM. UPB1, transcription factor UPBEAT1, plays an important role in maintaining  and
  H2O2 balance in the RAM. RSL4, ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE SIXLIKE 4, a bHLH transcription
  factor, activates ROS-related gene expression and regulates root hair elongation.
  AIM1, ABNORMAL INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM, regulates ROS levels via the SA synthesis
  pathway in the RAM. APP1, Arabidopsis thaliana P-loop NTPase1, controls ROS homeostasis
  in the stem cell niche (SCN) of the root tip. VTC1, an Enzyme Involved in Ascorbate
  Biosynthesis, regulates H2O2 levels in the RAM. BRI1, BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE
  1, and BZR1, BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1, are modified by ROS. QC, quiescent center;
  BR, brassinosteroids; SA, salicylic acid; GR, glutathione reductase; RH, root hair.
  Arrows indicate positive regulation. Bars indicate negative regulation. Unbroken
  lines indicate direct regulation, and broken lines indicate unclear mechanism.
