caption: 'Natural 5′ terminally deleted group-B enterovirus RNA forms can modulate
  type I interferon signaling pathway activation. (A) Full-length viral RNA is recognized
  by cytoplasmic sensors RIG-I or MDA5 in EV-B infections. Signaling through the adaptor
  protein MAVS leads to IRF3 activation and translocation to the nucleus. These molecules
  stimulate high level of IFN-α/β and ISG56 production for the development of effective
  antiviral responses to EV-B infections. (B) According to recent reports, deleted
  viral genomes were associated with parental complete virus in early phase group-B
  enterovirus infection. Host cell proteins recruited in viral RNP complexes or potentially
  acting as a restriction factors could provide an evolutionary advantage to the 5′
  NCR truncated viral RNA forms. Deletion in RNA domain-I (5′ terminally deleted viral
  genomes) could impair the viral genomic RNA recognition by RLRs (RIG-I or MDA5)
  immune sensors during the early phase of antiviral innate immune response resulting
  in low level of IFN-α/β and ISG56 production. IFN: interferon; RIG-I: retinoic acid-inducible
  gene-I; MDA5: melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; MAVS: mitochondria
  antiviral-signaling protein; IRF: Interferon Regulatory Factor 3; ISG56: interferon
  stimulated gene 56; 5′ NCR: 5′ non-coding region.'
