caption: 'Protein-protein interaction networks of deiminated proteins identified in
  plasma-EVs of naked mole-rat. Reconstruction of protein-protein interactions based
  on known and predicted interactions using STRING analysis. (A) Coloured nodes represent
  query proteins and first shell of interactors. (B) KEGG pathways relating to the
  identified proteins and reported in STRING are highlighted as follows: red = complement
  and coagulation cascade; dark green = Staphylococcus aureus infection; purple =
  HIF-signalling pathway; yellow = platelet activation; light blue = systemic lupus
  erythematosus (SLE); orange = oestrogen signalling pathway; dark blue = cholesterol
  metabolism; light green = vitamin digestion and absorption; pink = glycolysis/gluconeogenesis.
  Coloured nodes represent query proteins and first shell of interactors, white nodes
  are second shell of interactors. Coloured lines indicate whether protein interactions
  are identified via known interactions (curated databases, experimentally determined),
  predicted interactions (gene neighbourhood, gene fusion, gene co-occurrence) or
  via text mining, co-expression or protein homology (see the colour key for connective
  lines included in the figure).'
