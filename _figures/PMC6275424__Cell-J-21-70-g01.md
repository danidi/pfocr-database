caption: The Ras/ERK signal transduction pathway with emphasis on p120-RasGAP interactions.
  By the binding of growth factors, cytokines or hormones to tyrosinekinase receptors
  (TKR), cross phosphorylation of tyrosine residues occurs and following their dimerization,
  the Ras/ERK pathway is activated. RasGap proteinsincluding p120-RasGAP, neurofibromin
  (NF1) and RAS-P21 protein activator 2 (RASA2) are able to downregulate Ras signaling
  by the conversion of the active formof Ras to its inactive form (GTP-bound and GDP-bound
  respectively) (, ). P120-RasGAP, in a Ras-dependent manner, binds to phosphorylated
  TKRs. The Ras/ ERK pathway (shown by blue arrows) leads to differentiation, proliferation
  and migration and is involved in the development of heart valve. The inherited disordersof
  this pathway including NF1, Legius syndrome, Noonan, Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC)
  syndrome, Costello, LEOPARD, and Capillary Malformation/ArteriovenousMalformation
  (CM/AVM) are indicated. Ras-independent function of RASA1 (shown by brown arrows)
  is promoted via the interaction between p120-RasGAP andp190 RhoGAP with the latter
  acting as a GAP for the Ras superfamily protein Rho (, ). P120-RasGAP also has the
  ability to bind phosphoinositides. The PI3K/ AKT pathway (shown by green arrows)
  leads to cell survival, which protects cells against apoptosis (, ).
