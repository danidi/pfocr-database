caption: 'Signaling pathways: HN exerts its function through both extracellular receptors
  and intracellular binding partners. The proposed extracellular receptors are trimeric
  receptor complex including CNTF, WSX1, and GP130 and downstream JAK2–STAT-3 signaling
  pathway, and FPRL-1/2 G-protein-coupled receptors. HN directly binds to Aβ 17–28
  and prevents the interaction of Aβ42 with receptors. HN also binds to its intracellular
  partners including IGFBP-3, Bax, tBid, MPP8, TRIM11, and actinin-4. VSTM2L is an
  extracellular antagonist of HN.'
