caption: 'The Vick-Zimmerman pathway of JA biosynthesis from α-linolenic acid. Inhibitors
  and their putative targets are indicated. Phenidone interferes with lipoxygenase
  activity, DIECA reduces hydroperoxides to alcohols, and n-propyl gallate inhibits
  both lipoxygenase and allene oxide cyclase activity. The signaling sequence may
  be activated by pathogen infestation or herbivore feeding. The intermediates may
  have distinct and different biological activities: a, acyclic octadecanoids; b,
  cyclopentanoid C18 fatty acids; c, epi-JA and JA; d, amino acid conjugates of a,
  b, and c.'
