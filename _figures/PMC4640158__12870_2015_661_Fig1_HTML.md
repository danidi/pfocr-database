caption: 'Schematic presentation of the metabolic pathway leading to β-carotene formation
  and major downstream products. Enzymes are aligned with arrows. The three upstream
  enzymes belonging to the methylerthritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway are: deoxy-d-xylulose
  5-phosphate (DXP) synthase (DXS), DXP reductoisomerase (DXR) and geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate synthase (GGPPS). The carotenogenesis enzymes are: phytoene synthase
  (PSY); phytoene desaturase (PDS); ζ-carotene isomerase (Z-ISO); ζ-carotene desaturase
  (ZDS); carotene isomerase (CRTISO). lycopene ɛ-cyclase (ε-LCY); lycopene β-cyclase
  (β-LCY); β-carotene hydroxylase (β-OHase) carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs);
  9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs); Enzyme names and abbreviations are after
  []'
