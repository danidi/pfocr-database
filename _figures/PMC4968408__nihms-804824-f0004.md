caption: Proposed model for `multi-phase' GPCR signaling organized by the endocytic
  pathway, using the β2AR as an example. (1) β2AR-Gs coupling in the plasma membrane
  promotes cAMP production from the plasma membrane. (2) Local accumulation of β2AR-arrestin
  complexes, potentially activating MAP kinase(s) by arrestin scaffolding, occurs
  during or around the time of receptor clustering in clathrin-coated pits. (3) β2AR-Gs
  coupling occurs again in the early endosome limiting membrane, promoting a discrete
  phase of cAMP production from endosomes. The `?' indicates that it is presently
  unknown if the endosome signal requires continued agonist engagement of receptors,
  and how endosome-initiated signal strength or duration is controlled.
