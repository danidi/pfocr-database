caption: The schematic summary of the regulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway
  by tolvaptan. Tolvaptan phosphorylated PERK independently of cAMP signaling, following
  which PERK directly phosphorylates Nrf2, leading to the dissociation of Nrf2 from
  Keap1,. Once released from Keap1, Nrf2 is not degraded by proteasome and translocates
  from the cytosol to nucleus. Tolvaptan increases the transcription of an antioxidant
  enzyme HO-1 in mpkCCD cells and the outer medulla of mouse kidneys. A PERK inhibitor,
  GSK2606414, counteracted the effect of tolvaptan on HO-1 expression. Although the
  precise mechanisms remain unclear, tolvaptan may bind to membrane- and ER-localized
  V2R and modulate PERK phosphorylation. Tolvaptan activated Nrf2 via a different
  mechanism to that of BARD. As a consequence, the combination therapy of tolvaptan
  and BARD could synergistically activate the Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway.
