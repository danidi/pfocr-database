caption: Proposed scheme of the signaling pathway by TfR2 and HFE. Holotransferrin
  by binding to TfR2 in a complex with HFE, induces Erk1/2 phosphorylation. This,
  in turn, induces furin expression possibly acting also on the SMAD1/5/8 pathway.
  Furin participates in the maturation of hepcidin, and of the BMP, which induce hepcidin
  expression. It also produces the soluble form of HJV, which has an inhibitory effect
  on hepcidin expression.
