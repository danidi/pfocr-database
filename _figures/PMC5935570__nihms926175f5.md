caption: 'A: MRNA and protein levels of E-Cadherin (CDH1), a marker of metastatic
  potential show differential expression between the two races in TNBC. *: P<0.05;
  Mann-Whitney U test. B: DW tRFs and mRNAs participating in MAPK signaling. The shown
  correlations between tRFs and mRNAs are present only in Wh TNBC patients. Shown
  are tRNA loci (diamonds) that produce tRFs that are correlated with the mRNAs of
  the shown genes (circles) as well as PPIs among the protein products of these genes.
  PEBP1 is also known as RKIP and MAPK14 is known as P38. C: PPI network and DW associations
  of the corresponding mRNAs with isomiRs/tRFs of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway
  as integrated from KEGG, Pickle and UniProt databases. The shown DW associations
  correspond to an absence of co-expression in one of the states. The edges connecting
  DW transcripts are colored by the state in which the transcripts are co-expressed.
  Gene nodes are sorted based on the cellular compartment of the encoded protein,
  from extracellular (left hand-side) to nuclear (right hand-side). The full list
  of how the Wnt/β-catenin pathway genes are DW with isomiRs and tRFs is included
  in .'
