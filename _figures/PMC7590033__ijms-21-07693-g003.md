caption: 'Canonical and non-canonical signaling of CB1R. (A) Canonically, CB1R activation
  results in coupling of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-protein (Gαi/o), and the
  activation of GIRK and inhibition of calcium channels. CB1Rs also activate MAPKs,
  such as ERK1/2 and JNK, which result in the subsequent induction of Krox-24 and
  CREB respectively. In addition, CB1R stimulation also leads to the downstream activation
  of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which further results in the transcription of BDNF. (B)
  The CB1R is also involved in non-canonical signaling. Gαq/11 GPCR-mediated-mobilization
  of endocannabinoids, and subsequent activation of the CB1R in an autocrine or paracrine
  fashion (Receptor transactivation). The CB1R has also been shown to dimerize with
  other GPCRs resulting in a change in CB1R-mediated signaling, such as changes in
  MAPK activation patterns (Heterodimerization). Additionally, GPCRs that activate
  PKC, such as Gαq/11 GPCRs, have also been shown to phosphorylate CB1R and potentially
  dampen its activity in certain cell types (heterologous desensitization). Certain
  cannabinoids have been shown to couple to Gαq/11 and Gα(s) proteins, and effectively
  activate calcium channels (Gαi/o independent signaling). In addition to being membrane-bound,
  functional CB1R has also been reported to localize intracellularly, such as the
  nucleus and the mitochondria, where they are capable of signaling (intracellular
  signaling). Finally, cannabinoids have been shown to trigger an induction of CNR1
  by the activation of CB1R in various cell types (autoinduction). (AC: adenylyl cyclase;
