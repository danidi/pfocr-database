caption: In silico analysis and gene expression studies suggests functional coupling
  between FTO and the BDNF/NTRK2-signalling pathway. Ablation of C/EBPs has been shown
  to reduce the expression of transcription factors Egr1, Egr2 (early growth response
  protein 1 and 2) and Fos (proto-oncogene c-Fos) following BDNF exposure in cultured
  neuronal cells [,] linking BDNF-NTRK2 to gene transcription via C/EBPs. C/EBPβ is
  a substrate for phosphorylation by MAPK, one of three downstream pathways of BDNF-NTRK2
  signalling [,]. C/EBPs mediate the immediate early gene response of NTRK2-signalling.
  Recent findings by Wu et al. suggest FTO to attenuate epigenetic control of gene
  regulation via methylation of CpG-sites in C/EBPβ response elements (CEBPREs) [].
  In silico analysis, as well as expression studies, point to a functional coupling
  between FTO and the BDNF/NTRK2-signalling pathway, potentially mediated by the increased
  binding of C/EBPβ methylated response elements
