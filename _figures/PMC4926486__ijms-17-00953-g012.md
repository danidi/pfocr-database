caption: Mechanism of cell death in murine lung epithelial cells after repeated cycles
  of hyperoxia, radiation, and double-hit combination challenge. Hyperoxia and radiation
  exposure generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that lead to increases in DNA damage.
  Oxidative stress induces the expression of cytoprotective enzymes (HO-1 and Nqo1).
  We observed significant increases in molecular markers of DNA damage (γ-H2AX, GADD45α
  and cleaved-PARP), along with a key upstream executioners of apoptosis (cleaved
  caspase-3). (a) Additionally, we observed increased Annexin-V, a marker of apoptosis,
  and levels of apoptotic proteins (cleaved PARP, GADD45α, and cleaved caspase-3)
  and altered levels of cell signaling proteins (phopso-p53, p21, CDK1 and cyclin
  B1). Therefore, we propose that hyperoxia and radiation exposure (b) increase apoptosis
  (via ATP depletion and activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway) and G2/M cell
  cycle arrest, ultimately leading to (c) lung cell death. ↑ indicates an increase
  in gene expression or protein levels; ↓ indicates a decrease in gene expression
  or protein levels.
