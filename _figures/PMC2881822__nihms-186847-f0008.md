caption: The interaction of ERβ1 with its ligand 3β-Adiol represses an EMT by destabilizing
  HIF-1α and inhibiting VEGF-A transcription. Stimuli that induce an EMT diminish
  ERβ1 expression resulting in increased VEGF-A expression and the consequent activation
  of a VEGF-A/NRP1 signaling pathway that inhibits GSK-3β and promotes Snail1 nuclear
  localization.
