caption: Signaling mechanisms of ROS-mediated increase in leukocyte migration and
  junctional permeability. During neutrophil migration, clustering of ICAM-1 by integrins
  leads to the activation of Rac, which induces intracellular ROS generation by NADPH
  oxidases. Increased ROS generation activates tyrosine kinase activity of c-Src and
  PYK2, which phosphorylates VE-cadherin at Y645, Y658, Y731, and Y733. The phosphorylation
  of these residues destabilizes the AJs by preventing interactions with the cytoplasmic
  proteins such as beta catenin and p120 catenin. Increased ROS enhances the expression
  of P-selectin on the endothelium by enabling secretion from Weibel–Palade bodies
  (WPB). In addition, ROS is known to activate NF-κB, which induces the expression
  of cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin; enhances neutrophil
  binding on the endothelium; and increases paracellular migration. Acute exposure
  of pro-inflammatory factors such as thrombin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and VEGF
  trigger NOX-mediated ROS formation and PLC-γ/cADPR activation, which resulted in
  an increase of [Ca2+]i by TRPC/TRPM. Increase in [Ca2+]i activates calmodulin and
  kinases, which, in turn, modified constituents of AJs and reorganized actin cytoskeleton
  and resulted in junction disassembly. Agonist-mediated ROS formation also induces
  transcription of pro-inflammatory genes by canonical NFκB pathway. ROS are also
  involved in activation of different kinases, including c-Src, PYK2, FAK, and PKC,
  and thus induce phosphorylation of AJ proteins and destabilize AJs. E-Sln, E-Selectin;
