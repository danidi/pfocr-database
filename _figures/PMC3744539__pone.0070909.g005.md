caption: APE1 redox inhibitor E3330 prevents inflammatory cytokines production (IL-8
  and IL-6) triggered by FAs accumulation and TNF-α stimulation in hepatic cancer
  cell lines. In this pathway, mitochondrial impairment and resulting oxidative stress
  condition may cause the functional activation of NF-κB transcription factor through
  APE1 regulatory redox function leading to IL-8 and IL-6 gene expression.
