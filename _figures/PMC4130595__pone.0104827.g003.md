caption: The green rectangles and blue circles represent the high-risk genes and their
  regulatory miRNAs respectively. The lines between them show the downregulation of
  miRNA to genes. The ‘on-off’ symbols sited on the line mean the miRSNPs within miRNA
  target sites. The peripheral large circles or rectangles denote the pathways that
  miRSNPs may influence through their effects on miRNAs' regulations to target genes.
  The orange stars with number inside beside miRNAs stand for the number of literatures
  validating the inhibition of miRNA to its target gene in Pubmed database.
