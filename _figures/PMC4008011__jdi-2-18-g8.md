caption: Summary of pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic neuropathy. Long‐term hyperglycemia
  causes downstream metabolic cascades of polyol pathway hyperactivity, advanced glycation
  end‐products (AGE)/receptor for AGE (RAGE) reactions and increased reactive oxygen
  species (ROS). They compromise both endoneurial microvessels and neural tissues
  themselves through activation of poly‐ADP‐ribose polymerase (PARP), alterations
  of protein kinase C (PKC) and an increase in mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK),
  as well as activation of nuclear factor‐(NF)‐κB, resulting in functional and structural
  changes of peripheral neuropathy. Metabolic aberrations in the nerve elicit pro‐inflammatory
  reactions, inducing release of cytokines, suppression of neurotrophins and migration
  of macrophages, and promote the development of neuropathy. Recently, cellular factors
  derived from the bone marrow were found to produce chimeric cells in peripheral
  nerves of diabetic animals to elicit nerve injury. There is also the possibility
  that other cellular components from the bone marrow have an influence on the nerve
  pathology in diabetes. In addition, ischemia/reperfusion might also accelerate nerve
  injury, in part mediated by inflammatory reactions. Risk factors represented by
  hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking and insulin resistance are also important
  contributors to the development of neuropathy.
