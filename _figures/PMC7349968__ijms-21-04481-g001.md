caption: The sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Ceramide is the central metabolite generated
  in the sphingolipid metabolism by three distinct pathways. Ceramide de novo synthesis
  consists of Palmitoyl-CoA condensation with serine by the action of serine palmitoyl
  transferase, followed by a set of reduction and acetylation reactions to generate
  ceramide. Sphingomyelin (SM) catabolism generates ceramide through the action of
  sphingomyelinases. The salvage pathway involves N-acylation of fatty acids with
  a sphingosine backbone to produce ceramide by ceramide synthases. Ceramide can be
  further phosphorylated to ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) by ceramide kinase, or converted
  into complex glycosphingolipids by glucosylceramide or galactosylceramide synthases.
  Ceramidase is responsible of catabolizing ceramide into sphingosine, which may be
  further metabolized by sphingosine kinases to generate sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).
