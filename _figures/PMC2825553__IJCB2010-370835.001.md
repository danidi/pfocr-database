caption: Interplay of cellular stress signals with apoptosis pathways. Signaling via
  the death receptor pathway can be inhibited by downregulation or epigenetic silencing
  of death receptors (DRs) or upregulation of cFLIP by hyperoxia. In the mitochondrial
  pathway, Bcl-2 favors a prooxidant milieu that promotes survival, while the reduced
  form of cytochrome c is inhibited in its activity to trigger caspase activation
  via the apoptosome. At the postmitochondrial level, translation of XIAP and cIAP1
  is sustained via an IRES-dependent mechanism even under cellular stress conditions.
