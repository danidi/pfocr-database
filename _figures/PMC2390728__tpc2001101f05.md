caption: Schematic of the Proposed Mechanism of ATHK1 Action in Seeds and Seedlings.After
  perception of water stress by ATHK1, a phosphorelay putatively involving ARR3/ARR4
  and/or ARR8/ARR9 transmits a signal to increase the transcription of ABA biosynthetic
  genes, causing a rise in intracellular ABA levels. In vegetative tissues, increased
  ABA levels initiate the transcription of stress-responsive genes, including ATHK1
  itself. An ATHK1-responsive ABA-independent pathway of stress-responsive gene expression
  also exists. In seeds, ATHK1-mediated increased ABA levels drive the synthesis of
  seed storage proteins and affect seed desiccation tolerance.
