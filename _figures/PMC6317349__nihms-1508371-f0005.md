caption: '(A) MeHg directly interacts with the selenol group of selenocysteine. Due
  to its high electrophilicity, MeHg directly interacts with the selenol group (–SeH)
  of selenoccysteine (red arrow). Because this group is classically responsible for
  catalytic activity in several selenoproteins, loss of protein function is observed.
  (B) MeHg may impair the biosynthesis of selenocysteine. Selenocysteine (Sec) is
  crucial for the proper synthesis and functioning of selenoproteins. The biosynthesis
  of Sec occurs on its tRNA, and the pathway begins with the attachment of serine
  to Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec (event 1; catalyzed by seryl-tRNAsynthetase) in the presence
  of ATP. Phosphoseryl-tRNA kinase (event 2) phosphorylates the serine moiety to form
  an intermediate, phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec (PSer-tRNA[Ser]Sec). Sec synthase (event
  3) catalyzes the formation of Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec, which is subsequently incorporated
  into selenoproteins during protein synthesis. This metabolic step requires the presence
  of selenophosphate (H2SePO3–), whose precursor is selenide (HSe-) (event 4). MeHg
  (CH3Hg+) directly interacts with selenide (red arrow), leading to a “selenium-deficient-like”
  condition, which lead to inappropriate selenoprotein synthesis (). For additional
  details on Sec biosynthesis, see . Abbreviations: Pi, inorganic phosphate; PPi,
  inorganic pyrophosphate.'
