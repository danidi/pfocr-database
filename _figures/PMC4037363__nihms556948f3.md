caption: Nucleic acids encounter TLRs in endosomes after uptake from the extracellular
  milieu. Depending on the method of delivery into the cell (e.g. in an immune complex,
  as oligonucleotides, or encapsulated in a viral particle), nucleic acids may reach
  distinct endosomes with unique signaling properties. Early and late endosomes are
  spatially and temporally distinct from one another. TLR9 signaling from late endosomes
  leads to activation of NF-κB transcription factors and induction of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines (TNFα, IL-12p40 and IL-6) (A and B). TLR9 signaling from a distinct population
  of endosomes leads recruitment of IRF and induction of type I IFN (IFNα, IFNβ).
  One model suggests that this specialized compartment is simply early endosomes (A).
  Two other compartments capable of type I IFN induction have been described, and
  it remains unclear whether these three compartments are, in fact, distinct. The
  AP-3 complex regulates TLR9 trafficking to mature lysosome related organelles (LROs),
  compartments distinct from endosomes and lysosomes and capable of initiating type
  I interferon signaling (B). Second, a compartment for DNA-immune complex (DNA-IC)-dependent
  IFNα signaling requires components of the autophagy pathway through a mechanism
  termed LC3 associated phagocytosis (LAP). DNA-IC compartments mature using solely
  the LAP pathway and not the AP-3 dependent pathway (C). In contrast, CpG also utilizes
  autophagy pathways (mediated by ATG5 and ATG7) but also requires AP-3 for type I
  IFN signaling. While much of characterization of these compartments has focused
  on TLR9, it is likely that TLR7 populates similarly diverse and specialized endosomes.
