caption: Gene Ontology and pathway categories that are enriched (P≤0.01, Fisher's
  exact test) in misregulated genes from ASD cases compared to controls were identified
  (n=18), along with the corresponding set of genes from ASD cases. Each gene set
  is shown as a red or pink dot, depending on whether the 2nd or 3rd percentile threshold
  was used for detection (), and size is proportional to the number of genes in the
  set. Edge thickness indicates the fraction of genes shared between two sets. Groups
  of functionally related gene sets are highlighted by blond discs. The names of novel
  genes that are not already implicated in ASD and have neural-related phenotypes
  are printed in black, the names of genes already implicated in ASD are printed in
  red, and otherwise gene names are printed in pale blue. If a gene is in multiple
  categories, the number of categories is written in superscript and genes in which
  a stop codon is introduced by the SNV are labeled ‘s’.
