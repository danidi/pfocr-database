caption: Schematic illustrating the potential contributions of ADAM9 (a disintegrin
  and metalloproteinase domain-9) to various chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
  phenotypes. 1) Inhaling cigarette smoke increases the expression of ADAM9 in lung
  macrophages and bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells, either directly or indirectly
  by generating proinflammatory mediators in the lungs that induce ADAM9 expression
  by these cells; 2) ADAM9 may directly degrade lung elastin to promote emphysema
  development; 3) increases in lung macrophage counts increases lung elastin degradation
  further (by increasing the lung burden of macrophage-derived MMPs) to contribute
  to emphysema development. Increases in lung macrophage counts may also contribute
  to lung inflammation and injury by increasing the lung burden of macrophage-derived
  oxidants (that injure alveolar septal cells) and macrophage-derived proinflammatory
  mediators that amplify macrophage recruitment and activation (CCL-3) and survival
  (GM-CSF and M-CSF); 4) ADAM9 expressed by alveolar epithelial cells sheds EGFR and
  VEGFR2 from lung epithelial cells to promote alveolar septal cell death and emphysema
  development by reducing activation of the PI3K/Akt prosurvival pathway in alveolar
  septal cells; 5) Adam9 also promotes small-airway fibrosis, in part, by increasing
  α-smooth muscle actin–positive fibroblasts in the small airways, or possibly by
  increasing airway inflammation; 6) Adam9 increases airway mucus cell metaplasia
  via mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. The scissors indicate processes in
  which the ADAM9 metalloproteinase domain is likely to be involved. EGFR = epidermal
  growth factor receptor; GM-CSF = granulocyte–macrophage colony–stimulating factor;
  M-CSF = macrophage colony–stimulating factor; MMPs = matrix metalloproteinases;
  PI3K = phosphoinositide 3-kinase; ROS = reactive oxygen species; VEGFR2 = vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptor-2.
