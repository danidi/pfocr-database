caption: Mechanisms of immune suppression by Treg. (A) Treg can suppress their target
  cells through direct cell-cell interaction. CTLA4/B7 interaction between Treg and
  dendritic cells can induce IDO production by dendritic cells, and the overall effect
  of reduction in tryptophan suppresses the proliferation of effector T cells. LAG3/MHCII
  interaction between Treg and dendritic cells suppresses dendritic cell maturation.
  CD4+ effector T cells are suppressed by the HVEM/BTLA and CTLA4/B7 interaction with
  Treg. (B) Treg also demonstrates paracrine signalling to suppress its targets. IL-10
  is shown to suppress the infiltration of neutrophils in the kidney after ischaemic-reperfusion
  injury. IL-10 can also induce the conversion from M1 macrophages to M2 macrophages.
  TGF-β1 is also demonstrated to suppress the differentiation of Th1 cells and prevent
  the development of colitis. IL-35 can suppress the proliferation of CD4+ effector
  T cells. (C) Another mechanism is metabolic disruption. High affinity IL-2 receptors
  expressed by Treg depletes IL-2, and this suppresses the activation of CD8+ T cells,
  CD4+ T cells and NK cells. The ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 expressed on Treg cell
  surface catalyse the conversion of ATP to adenosine. Increased adenosine levels
  inhibit the proliferation and cytokine release by activated CD4+ effector T cells.
  The overall effect of reduction of ATP leads to reduced maturation of dendritic
  cells and reduced release of pro-inflammatory IL-1β by monocytes. (D) Treg can induce
  apoptosis on immune mediators through granzyme/ perforin pathway, and they include
  monocytes, dendritic cells, NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.
