caption: Acetyl-CoA is produced in the mitochondria from glucose and fatty acids.
  Mitochondrial acetyl-CoA then enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce
  citrate, which is exported out of the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and nucleus.
  Citrate is converted back into acetyl-CoA for use in acetylating cytoplasmic and
  nuclear proteins. Acetate also contributes to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear pool
  of acetyl-CoA, and is incorporated into acetylation of proteins. The cartoon cell
  matter were slightly modified from Servier Medical Art [].
