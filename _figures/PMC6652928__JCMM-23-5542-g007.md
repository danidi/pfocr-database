caption: The mechanism of the loss of cell polarity in CBDL rat lung. A, In the pulmonary
  microvasculature of normal rats, the cells are polarized. Endotheliocyte are arranged
  in a single layer and are regular in morphology. The cell polarity proteins are
  regular localized and the cell‐cell tight junctions are strong. PTEN and Cdc42 were
  in a relatively inactive state. B, In the pulmonary microvasculature of HPS rats,
  the cells were in a depolarized state. Cells are arranged in multiple layers and
  are irregularly shaped. The cell polarity proteins are broadly redistributed the
  cell‐cell tight junctions are weak. Cytokines from HPS rat serum induces the PTEN/AX2/Cdc42
  signalling pathway, which promotes actin cytoskeleton disassembly in the lung. Cdc42,
  as a key upstream regulator, mediates the dysregulation of cell polarity and promotes
  cell migration and cell proliferation, thereby further participating in the formation
  process of PVR associated with HPS. Bpv(pic):PTEN inhibitor,Casin:Cdc42 inhibitor
