caption: Effect of diabetes and KU-596 therapy on the TNF network in dorsal root ganglion.
  C57Bl/6N mice were rendered diabetic using two injections of streptozotocin. After
  12 weeks of diabetes, the mice were treated once per week for 4 weeks with 20 mg/kg
  of KU-596 or the drug vehicle, Captisol. Nondiabetic mice received similar treatments.
  After 16 weeks, the mice were euthanized and mRNA was isolated from the L4–L6 lumbar
  dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with three to five biologic replicates per group for RNA-Seq
  analysis. Differentially expressed genes were submitted to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  to identify and model the gene networks. The effect of diabetes on the predicted
  activation state of members of the TNF network in the absence (a) or presence (b)
  of KU-596 therapy is shown. Please see [] for additional experimental details
