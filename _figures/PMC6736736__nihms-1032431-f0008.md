caption: As cells experience zinc limitation, the Zur regulon is derepressed in three
  distinct waves. The first set of genes to be derepressed (omitted for clarity) includes
  the zinc independent r-protein paralog L31* (rpmEB). (1) L31* can then displace
  the zinc containing L31 r-protein from the ribosome. As zinc availability continues
  to decrease, (2) zagA (formerly yciC) expression is induced. Concurrently, (3) FolE
  activity begins to decline leading to a decrease in 10f-THF, the substrate for the
  purine biosynthetic enzyme PurH. As a result, (4) ZMP accumulates and is converted
  to ZTP. (5) ZTP stimulates ZagA activity and allows for ZagA interaction with FolE
  (GCYH-IA), which allows for continued folate production in the presence of zinc
  limitation. (6) If cells, continue to experience zinc limitation, the final set
  of Zur regulated genes is derepressed, which includes folEB, encoding GCYH-IB. (7)
  FolEB (GCYH-IB) is able to functionally replace the inactive FolE (GCYH-IA) and,
  as a result, (8) ZMP levels decline as the purine biosynthetic pathway is again
  functional.
