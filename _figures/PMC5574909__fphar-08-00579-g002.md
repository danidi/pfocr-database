caption: Agents that mediate an antifibrotic action in the liver via regulation of
  sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling pathway in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Hepatic
  stellate cells play a major role in liver fibrosis by triggering the progression
  of the disease. During the process of liver fibrosis, quiescent stellate cells are
  activated by several molecules like TGF-β or PDGF-β to transform in activated cells,
  which produce extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen or α-SMA. S1P is involved
  in these processes primarily via S1P formation by SphK1 and subsequently via S1P
  receptors (S1P1, S1P2, and S1P3). Several molecules that play an inhibitory action
  on the sphingolipid pathway are shown. Most of these inhibitors can be used as a
  therapy in fibrosis disease because of its beneficial effects.
