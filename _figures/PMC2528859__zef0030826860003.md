caption: Pathways of protein misfolding that lead to cell death. Nascent unfolded
  polypeptides enter the ER and interact with chaperones and catalysts of protein
  folding to mature into compact, thermodynamically favorable structures, () and ().
  Failure of this process results in persistence of misfolded polypeptide-chaperone
  complexes () or extraction of soluble, misfolded protein from the ER and degradation
  through ERAD I (). Formation of insoluble protein aggregates () requires clearance
  by autophagy (). ER stress stimuli impair polypeptide folding and induce adaptive
  increases in chaperones and catalysts within the ER lumen through UPR sensor activation.
  Chronic or overwhelming stimuli elicit a number of apoptotic signals including oxidative
  stress, JNK activation, CHOP expression, cleavage of caspase 12, and activation
  of the intrinsic mitochondrial-dependent cell death pathway ().
