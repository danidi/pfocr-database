caption: 'Schematic pathway highlighting major events in mevalonate cascade inhibition-induced
  cell death in hATF: HMG-CoA inhibition with simvastatin concomitantly induces apoptosis,
  autophagy and UPR/ER stress in hATF. Apoptosis initiation is driven by disruption
  of balance between pro and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. HMG-CoA inhibition also
  promotes UPR/ER stress as indicated by an increase in BIP/GRP78, and the activation
  of ATF4 and PERK, which in turn activate CHOP to support apoptosis. IREα1 is also
  activated, which leads to JNK phosphorylation (P-JNK) that contributes to loss of
  Bcl-2, further promoting apoptosis. IREα1 activation also triggers XBP1 splicing
  (but direct effects on apoptosis are not clear, as denoted by ‘?''). Inhibiting
  HMG-CoA also leads to leak of cathepsin (CATH)-B and CATH-L from lysosomes to augment
  apoptosis. HMG-CoA inhibition also induces autophagy flux (LC3-II accumulation),
  which has a suppressive role, negatively regulating apoptosis (cell viability, caspase-7
  and -9) and UPR (BIP/GRP78, IREα1), albeit the autophagy response is not sufficient
  to ultimately prevent cell death'
