caption: Cell cycle regulation through cyclin E. PRb exerts an inhibitory effect on
  cell proliferation. It binds to the transcription factor E2F in its hypophosphorylated
  form to inhibit the binding of E2F to its target genes. A large proportion of these
  target genes are necessary for cells to enter S phase. When mitotic stimulation
  signals induce the formation of complexes such as cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclin D-CDK4/6
  through the PI3-AKT pathway, which can be activated by SOX2 and PrPc, these complexes
  phosphorylate pRb in the early G1 phase, and phosphorylated pRb dissociates from
  E2F, allowing E2F to regulate gene expression normally. Correct assembly of the
  cyclin E/CDK2 complex and the interaction of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex with CKIs,
  such as p27 or p21, are critical for cyclin E to function. The cell cycle is also
  regulated by an important positive feedback amplification loop involving cyclin
  E that can be induced by proteins of the E2F transcription factor family. When the
  cyclin E-CDK2 complex regulates the entry of cells into S phase and increases E2F
  activity by phosphorylating E2F, it further amplifies the transcription of cyclin
  E.
