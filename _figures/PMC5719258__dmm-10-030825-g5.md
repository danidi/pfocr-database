caption: An integrated model for valve development. A model of the various molecules
  that regulate valve morphogenesis and their functional relationships. Oscillatory
  shear stress activates Klf2 expression and its downstream target genes during cardiac
  valve development in zebrafish and mice. During lymphatic valve development, oscillatory
  shear stress enhances the expression of multiple molecules, such as ITGA9, ephrin-B2
  (EFNB2), GATA2, FOXC2, CX37 and β-catenin (CTNNB1). Oscillatory shear stress also
  antagonizes CX43 expression. β-catenin is upstream of GATA2 and FOXC2. Shear-stress-activated
  GATA2 is upstream of FOXC2 and ITGA9. PROX1 expression is not regulated by oscillatory
  shear stress. However, both GATA2 and β-catenin could enhance PROX1 expression in
  an oscillatory-shear-stress-independent manner. CX37 regulates NFATC1 activity through
  the calcineurin (Cn) signaling pathway. Laminar shear stress inhibits the planar
  cell polarity molecules VANGL2 and CELSR1 through syndecan-4 (SDC4). PECAM1 acts
  in parallel with SDC4 to regulate the reorientation of valve-forming endothelial
  cells.
