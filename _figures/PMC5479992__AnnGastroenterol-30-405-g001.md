caption: Iron homeostasis. (A) Iron absorption. Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ by duodenal
  cytochrome B (Dcytb) and is transported from enteral lumen into the enterocyte by
  the divalent metaltrasporter-1 (DMT-1). Iron is transported by the ferroportin (FPN)
  to the circulation, after oxidization by hephaestin and binding to transferrin (Tf)
  (B) Cellular iron uptake takes place via the transferrin receptors (TfR) on the
  membrane of the cell and iron is internalized and released from Tf with the help
  of DMT-1 (C) The hepcidin is produced mainly in the liver after activation of the
  BMP/SMAD pathway via the interaction of transferrin with TfR2, protein HFE and the
  co-receptor hemojuvelin (HJV)BMPR, bone morphogenetic protein receptor, HAMP, hepcidin
  antimicrobial protein.
