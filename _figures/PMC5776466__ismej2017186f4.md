caption: Transcriptional changes for genes in the pathway for cobalamin synthesis
  in response to ammonia starvation, recovery from starvation, Cu limitation, and
  Cu toxicity conditions. Genes and gene clusters are shown as upregulated (red) (P<0.05),
  downregulated (blue), or not differentially regulated (white) in stressed or recovery
  conditions relative to reference cultures as described in . Gene names in gray correspond
  to enzymes not yet identified in thaumarchaeotal genomes.
