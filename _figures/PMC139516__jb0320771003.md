caption: Synthesis pathway of the iron siderophore bacillibactin. Production of bacillibactin
  starts with chorismate and proceeds through the enzymatic actions of the DhbC, DhbB,
  and DhbA proteins to DHB. This intermediate has a weak iron siderophore activity
  () and is activated by DhbE-mediated adenylation. A modular peptide synthetase then
  modifies the resulting 2,3-dihydroxybenzoyladenylate through the addition of glycine
  and threonine residues and finally esterifies three of these intermediates to form
  bacillibactin ().
