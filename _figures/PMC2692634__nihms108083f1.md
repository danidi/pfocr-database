caption: 'Two pathways of 10-CHO-THF synthesis are known; in the first pathway, formate
  is added onto THF by formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase (FTL). Alternatively, 10-CHO-THF
  is generated in two steps from 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH2-THF): through
  oxidation to 5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH=THF) by a methylene-tetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase (DH), and then hydrolysis to 10-CHO-THF by methenyl-tetrahydrofolate
  cyclohydrolase (CH). In humans 10-CHO-THF is generated in the cytosol through either
  pathway by the trifunctional DHCH/FTL protein encoded by MTHFD1, often referred
  to as C1-THF synthase. In contrast the human mitochondrion contains a bifunctional
  DHCH and a monofunctional FTL. In L. major, 10-CHO-THF is generated in the cytosol
  by a bifunctional DHCH and a monofunctional FTL.'
