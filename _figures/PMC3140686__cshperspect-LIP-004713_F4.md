caption: Overview of the biosynthetic pathways of sterols. The four-ring sterol backbone
  derives from reductive polymerizations of acetate to generate squalene, which is
  cyclized to form lanosterol, the first sterol in the pathway. The rate-limiting
  enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis is HMG-CoA reductase. The postlanosterol pathway
  involves roughly 20 steps, with some of the enzymes capable of acting on multiple
  substrates. If the carbon-24 double bond is reduced early on, the pathway procedes
  via lathosterol (and 7-dehydrocholesterol, not shown) to cholesterol, whereas reduction
  of carbon-24 only in the last step results in the generation of desmosterol as the
  penultimate cholesterol cholesterol precursor. Cholesterol serves as a precursor
  for other bioactive sterols, such as steroid hormones and oxysterols.
