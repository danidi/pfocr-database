caption: Molecular model outlining the proposed mechanism for the stimulatory effects
  of resveratrol and curcumin on IL-1β- or U0126-induced MAPK pathway inhibition and
  apoptosis in primary chondrocytes in vitro. Signal transduction through β1-integrins
  leads to the activation of the Ras-MAP Kinase signaling pathway. Activation of the
  MAPK pathway may be one of the mechanisms by which β1-integrins regulate chondrocyte
  gene expression. Previous studies have shown that activation of the MAPK pathway
  regulates the activity of a number of intracellular signaling proteins through phosphorylation.
  Erk1/Erk2, a downstream kinase of the MAPK pathway, regulates the expression and
  activity of various transcription factors. Specific inhibition of Erk1/Erk2 by U0126
  or IL-1β results in cleavage of caspase-3 in human chondrocytes in vitro. Since
  activation of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation are common features of apoptosis,
  the specific inhibition of the Ras-mitogen-activated kinase leads to chondrocyte
  apoptosis. Resveratrol and curcumin both block the inhibition effect of U0126 or
  IL-1β on the MAPK pathway in chondrocytes
