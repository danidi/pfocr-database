caption: 'Schematic of the NO/ADMA/DDAH pathway. Nitric oxide (NO) is the product
  of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). NOS catalyzes
  the conversion of the proteinogenic amino acid L-arginine (R) into NO and L-citrulline.
  All 3 isoforms of NOS (endothelial NOS, neuronal NOS and inducible NOS) are endogenously
  inhibited by asymmetrically methylated arginines (ADMA or R-Me2 and L-NMMA or R-Me).
  These endogenous inhibitors of the NO synthesis are generated and released in the
  cytosol as the product of 2 biomolecular processes: the post-translational methylation
  of arginine residues incorporated into proteins catalyzed by one members of the
  protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family of enzymes and the release of said
  methylated residues into the cytosol by proteolysis. Methylated arginine can act
  as NOS inhibitors solely in their free form. The enzyme responsible for the metabolism
  of more than 70% of circulating and intracellular ADMA and L-NMMA is dimethylarginine
  dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), which converts ADMA and L-NMMA into L-citrulline
  and dimethylamine (DMA or Me2-NH2) or monomethylamine (MMA or Me-NH2).'
