caption: Increased MAPK/NO/Notch signaling may mediate myelin decompaction (gray-dotted
  arrows and insets), by downregulation of TJ/GJ proteins involved in myelin compaction
  such as Claudin 11 (Cldn11), ZO-2 (Tjp2), and Connexin 26 (Gjb2) in pNf1 mutants.(A)
  Decreased Nf1 (blue) results in increased RAS-GTP in mature oligodendrocytes, leading
  to hyperactive MAPK signaling (RTK →RAS →pMEK →pERK). Production of NO increases
  in response to hyperactive MAPK pathway (NOS, dashed arrow). Subsequently, NO promotes
  directly or indirectly (dotted line) Notch cleavage and translocation of NICD to
  the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression. Furthermore, diffusion of NO from
  Nf1 mutant oligodendrocytes (white arrows) might affect nearby oligodendrocytes
  increasing the number of decompacted fibers (bottom). Either pharmacological treatment
  alone (MEKi, L-NAME or GSI) rescues decompaction (purple lines).(B) Absent Nf1 (red)
  results in accumulation of RAS-GTP and stronger induction (thick arrows) of MAPK
  signaling and NO production. It is possible that long-lasting transcriptional and/or
  post-transcriptional changes (dotted lines with question marks) in molecules controlling
  NO levels (for example NOS1-2) might contribute to increases in NO. Subsequently,
  NO promotes Notch activation and regulation of myelin genes. Combination of inhibitors
  (MEKi and L-NAME, purple fused lines) rescues decompaction, while single agent treatments
  (for example GSI, fading purple arrow) improves severity but does not rescue decompaction.
  Note that genetic inactivation of Notch () combined with MEKi or L-NAME, also rescues
  compaction in this setting.
