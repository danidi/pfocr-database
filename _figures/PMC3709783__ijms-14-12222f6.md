caption: UV-induced cyclobutane dimers- structure (A) and repair by the Nucleotide
  Excision DNA Repair (NER) pathway (B). The NER pathway is mediated by at least eight
  enzymes that work together to identify bulky DNA lesions that distort the structure
  of the double helix, excise the damaged portion and replace the excised region by
  DNA synthesis directed by the complementary strand. Homozygous deficiency in any
  one of the NER enzymes leads to the clinical condition known as Xeroderma Pigmentosum
  (XP). Although not shown, NER can also be initiated in actively transcribed regions
  of the genome by involvement of the Cockayne syndrome proteins A and B.
