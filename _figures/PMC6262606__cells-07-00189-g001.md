caption: Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. The NF-κB signaling cascade
  comprises two separate pathways. The canonical pathway (left) is activated by signals
  through several cell surface receptors, including the B-cell receptor (BCR), Toll-like
  receptor, and CD40. The activation results in the nuclear translocation of the heterodimers
  constituted by the canonical NF-κB subunits RELA, c-REL and p50 where they activate
  the transcription of target genes. The alternative pathway (right) is activated
  by B cell-activating receptor (BAFFR), lymphotoxin-β receptor (LT-βR), and CD40.
  Proteasomal degradation of p100 results in the generation of the major heterodimer
  of the alternative pathway RELB/p52, which translocates to the nucleus and activates
  target-gene transcription. Only RELA, RELB, and c-REL can transcribe target genes
  due to transactivation domains.
