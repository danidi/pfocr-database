caption: a Insulin signal transduction system in individuals with normal glucose tolerance
  (see text for a detailed discussion). NOS, nitric oxide synthase. b In type 2 diabetic
  participants insulin signalling is impaired at the level of IRS-1 leading to decreased
  glucose transport/phosphorylation/metabolism and impaired nitric oxide synthase
  activation/endothelial function. At the same time, insulin signalling through the
  MAP kinase pathway is normally sensitive to insulin. The compensatory hyperinsulinaemia
  (due to insulin resistance in the IRS-1/PI-3 kinase pathway) results in excessive
  stimulation of this pathway, which is involved in inflammation, cell proliferation
  and atherogenesis (see text for a detailed discussion). SHC, Src homology collagen.
