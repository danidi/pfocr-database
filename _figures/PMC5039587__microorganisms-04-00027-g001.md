caption: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway in porcine intestinal epithelial
  (PIE) cells. Upon recognition of its cognate ligand, TLR4 dimerizes and initiates
  a signaling cascade that leads to the activation of a pro-inflammatory response.
  Ligand binding can induce two signaling pathways, the myeloid differentiation primary
  response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent and MyD88-independent pathways, which induce
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs. In MyD88-dependent
  signaling, upon ligand recognition, MyD88 is recruited to, and associates, with
  the cytoplasmic domain of the TLRs. Then IL-1R-associated kinase 4 (IRAK-4) and
  IRAK-1 are recruited and activated by phosphorylation. Activated IRAK-4 phosphorylates
  IRAK-1, which subsequently associates with tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated
  factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 activates transforming growth factor (TGF)-activating kinase
  1 (TAK1). TAK1 phosphorylates IKK-b and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  kinase 6 (MKK6), leading to degradation of I-κB and thereby leading to the nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB, which results in the induction of genes involved in inflammatory
  responses. Activation of the MyD88-dependent pathway also results in the activation
  of MAPKs such as p38 and JNK, which leads to the activation of AP-1 (Jun/Fos). Various
  negative regulatory mechanisms have evolved to attenuate TLR signaling and maintain
  the immune balance, including the activity of the TLR-negative regulators TOLLIP,
  IRAK-M, SIGIRR, MKP-1, A20, and Bcl3.
