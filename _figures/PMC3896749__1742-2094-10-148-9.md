caption: 'Hypothesis for the development of tactile allodynia following nerve injury.
  TLR 2 and 4 are expressed on the surface membrane (solid outline), signal through
  the adapters TIRAP and MyD88 resulting NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine
  expression such as TNF. Alternatively, TLR4 can signal through adaptors TRAM and
  TRIF. TLR3 is expressed in the endosome (dotted outline) and signals through TRIF.
  TRIF can activate IRF3 and initiate IFNβ transcription. We hypothesize that there
  is an initial endogenous TLR activation signal following nerve injury that results
  in: i) concurrent activation of multiple TLRs; ii) the TLR2 and TLR4 TIRAP-MyD88
  pathway and production of TNF produces an ipsilateral and contralateral tactile
  allodynia; and iii) the TLR3-TRIF pathway suppresses contralateral allodynia development
  associated with interferon release (dotted square) and downstream interferon receptor
  signaling.'
