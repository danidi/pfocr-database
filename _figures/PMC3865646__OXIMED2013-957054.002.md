caption: Modulation of apoptosis by hypothermia. After a serious insult the cell can
  trigger apoptosis, a highly regulated cell death mechanism. Intrinsic Pathway. Hypothermia
  increases ATP stores and slows ion channels then maintaining the integrity of the
  membranes. Hypothermia applied together or immediately after injury decreases the
  production of ROS. These events limit the rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane
  and the release of proapoptotic molecules like cytochrome c into the cytosol. The
  hypothermia-induced increase in nitric oxide also avoids cytochrome c release and
  it is even reported that early NO production can exert a negative feedback regulation
  of iNOS []. Moreover, iNOS transcription activated by NFκB was diminished after
  hypothermia []. Since catalase is absent in mitochondria, maintaining GSH redox
  cycle is critical to avoid H2O2 accumulation. There is abundant evidence that hypothermia
  keeps GSH pool. Extrinsic Pathway. It was found that hypothermia decreases the affinity
  of the death ligands-death receptors, with the consequent inhibition of the initiator
  caspases like caspase-8 or the NFκB-family molecules.
