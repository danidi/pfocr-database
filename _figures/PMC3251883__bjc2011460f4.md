caption: Proposed mechanism for VEGFA165 induced tumour growth. VEGFA production from
  the (human) tumour cells results in an increased fraction of host-derived stromal
  and endothelial cells. These (mouse) host-derived supportive cells produce a variety
  of cytokines that act on the (human) tumour cells. As a result, genes involved in
  the TGF-β signalling pathway are differentially expressed, inducing the inhibition
  of TGF-β signalling. This, in turn, results in decreased cell cycle arrest, which
  may explain the increased growth of VEGFA overexpression in tumour. The colours
  represent higher expressed (green) and lower expressed (red) genes or cytokines
  within the VEGFA165 tumours; stimulatory effect; indirect stimulatory effect; --∣
  inhibitory effect; - - > translocation.
