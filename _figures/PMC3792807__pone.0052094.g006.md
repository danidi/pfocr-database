caption: (A) Wild type cells. 5-FU is taken up and converted to 5-FUTP, which competes
  with freshly synthesized UTP for incorporation into RNA. (B) In an arginine biosynthesis
  mutant, more carbamoyl-P is shunted into the pyrimidine biosynthesis, and the resulting
  increased in UTP reduces the amount of 5-FUTP that is incorporated into RNA. (C)
  In cells overexpressing CPA1, CPA2 or URA2, more carbamoyl-P is made, which also
  results in an increase in UTP that reduces the incorporation of 5-FUTP into RNA.
  (D) In cells overexpressing HAM1, the amount of 5-FU that is incorporated into RNA
  is reduced by dephosphorylation of 5-FUMP back to 5-FUTP. Genetic interactions suggest
  that YJL055W also may affect this process.
