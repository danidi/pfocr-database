caption: Schematic model of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced molecular mechanism mediating
  the enhancement of contextual fear memory. Stress-increased GC secretion induces
  the expression of pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (pro-BDNF) (1) and tPA (2)
  proteins. tPA, whose role is to cleave plasminogen to plasmin, allows proteolytic
  processing of pro-BDNF into BDNF (3). Mature BDNF binds to and activates TrkB receptor
  (4). TrkB phosphorylation induces further phosphorylation and activation of Erk1/2MAPKsignaling
  pathway (5) to mediate the enhancement of contextual fear memory (6). This model,
  based on several studies including our own, is discussed in the main text.
