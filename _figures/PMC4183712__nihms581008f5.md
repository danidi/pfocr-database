caption: 'Dietary LC-O3PUFAs target the metabolism of carnosine and homocarnosine,
  as evidenced by increased levels of alanine, carnosine, homocarnosine, and 4-guanidinobutanoate
  in the spinal cord of animals fed with LC-O3PUFAs. The diet rich in LC-O3PUFAs also
  altered the glutamine-glutamate cycling. A distinctive group of amino acid systems
  were affected by the diet, including threonine and tryptophan. In particular, animals
  fed with LC-O3PUFAs showed dramatic increases in the levels of kynurenines, which
  can regulate mitochondrial homeostasis and oxidative stress, inflammation, and glutamate
  excitotoxicity through NMDA receptor inhibition. Notably, the diet increased the
  levels of ornithine and urea, while decreasing glucose and glucose-6-P levels, showing
  selective alterations in the spinal cord cell bioenergetics. This support that LC-O3PUFAs
  fuel energy production largely by oxidative phosphorylation via the tricarboxylic
  acid (TCA) cycle and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) rather than glycolysis, which
  are essential pathways for the synthesis of necessary macromolecules (i.e. amino
  acids, neurotransmitters, glutathione, nucleosides and lipids required for assembling
  new cells). These pathways may represent important mechanisms by which dietary LC-O3PUFAs
  confer prophylaxis against neurodegeneration and dysfunction in SCI. This reservoir
  of protective molecules and antioxidant bioavailability is expected to make neurons
  and glia more resistant against calcium overload, glutamate toxicity, and cell death
  following SCI. Metabolites in red increased with the dietary intervention. Features
  in green decreased with the LC-O3PUFA diet when compared to controls. Putative enzymatic/receptor
  targets are highlighted in red ovals. Abbreviations: AA, amino acid (polar); GABA,
  gamma-aminobutyrate; NADPH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NMDA, N-methyl-D-aspartate;
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; R5P, ribose 5-phosphate; Thr, threonine.'
