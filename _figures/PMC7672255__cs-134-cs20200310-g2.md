caption: DOX may induce CYP1B1 via different mechanisms. First, DOX may directly or
  indirectly activate the AhR. Upon its nuclear translocation and binding to the AhR
  Nuclear Translocator (ARNT), the AhR–ARNT heterodimer activates the XRE to induce
  CYP1B1 gene transcription. DOX may also induce CYP1B1 by generating ROS and eliciting
  an inflammatory response via IL-6 and TNF-α. Estrogen can also induce CYP1B1 gene
  expression via ERα; however, the role of DOX in this pathway is not known. Induction
  of CYP1B1 leads to both cardiovascular toxicity and increased chemoresistance.
