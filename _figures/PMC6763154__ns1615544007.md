caption: 'Model of apoptotic signaling pathway linking potassium deprivation to c-Jun
  activation: site of the protective action of ZnEgr1. As shown in this schematic
  diagram, our findings indicate that ZnEgr protects granule cells from apoptosis
  induced by potassium deprivation by suppressing c-Jun activation. Because ZnEgr1
  does not protect against the apoptotic effects of c-Jun(Asp), we infer that it acts
  upstream of c-Jun activation. This inference is corroborated by studies demonstrating
  that ZnEgr1 blocks c-Jun activation triggered by potassium deprivation. Furthermore,
  we have placed ZnEgr1 downstream of MEKKs because it blocks the ability of MEKK1
  to stimulate c-Jun activation and induce apoptosis. Because these findings indicate
  that Egr1 or other Egr family members are necessary for mediating c-Jun activation
  by MEKK1, but Egr1 is not sufficient to stimulate c-Jun reporter activity on its
  own, we hypothesize that it acts in concert with JNK kinases downstream of MEKKs
  to activate c-Jun. Thus, according to this model, MEKK1 is able to stimulate c-Jun
  by triggering both induction of Egr proteins and activation of JNKs.'
