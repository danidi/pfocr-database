caption: Lipointoxication impacts crucial cellular processes. The impacts of lipointoxication
  on several crucial cellular processes have been demonstrated (and are conserved)
  in many cell types, including bronchial epithelial cells. By perturbating the overall
  membrane organization (), an SFA/UFA imbalance within PL results in the induction
  of stress pathways (Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) and MAPK pathway), altered protein
  folding, depletion of calcium stores and impaired vesicular budding in the ER. Later
  in the secretory pathway, lipointoxication is also associated with reduced vesicle
  formation at the Golgi level. Overall, these alterations result in a global disruption
  of the secretory and of the trafficking of plasma-membrane protein to their final
  destination. If sustained, lipotoxicty ultimately leads to cell death (apoptosis).
  Perturbed SFA/UFA balance has also been associated to an increased release of cytokines,
  including the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL8. See text for details.
