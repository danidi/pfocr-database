caption: Theorised DIS3L2 and let‐7 pathway mediating gastrointestinal nematode (GIN)
  resistance. In the presence of LIN28A and TUT4/TUT7 the pre‐let‐7 miRNA is uridylated
  and marked for degradation by DIS3L2. We propose that SNPs associated with DIS3L2
  alter its function such that uridylation of pre‐let‐7 becomes a reversible event.
  DIS3L2 removes the oligoU tail in this model to allow pre‐let‐7 to continue into
  the maturation pathway with TUT4/TUT7 and Dicer. Mature let‐7 miRNAs bind to the
  IL10 3′UTR and prevent/reduce IL‐10 expression, ultimately allowing the Th1 immune
  response to be favored over the Th2, resulting in decreased resistance to GIN infection.
