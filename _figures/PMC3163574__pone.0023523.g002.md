caption: Schematic of IFNγ signaling through the JAK/STAT1 pathway. Binding of IFNγ
  to its receptor results in activation of JAKs, which phosphorylate cytoplasmic monomers
  of STAT1. Phosphorylated STAT1 dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and activates
  transcription from gene promoters containing Gamma Activated Sites (GAS). Cre recombinase
  translocates to the nucleus due to the presence of a nuclear localization signal.
