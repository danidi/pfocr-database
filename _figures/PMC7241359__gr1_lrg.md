caption: Methotrexate has been recognized by the World Health Organization as an ‘essential
  medication’, principally due to its broad diversity of mechanisms of action. Methotrexate
  can be utilized at low doses to take advantage of its dynamic range of anti-inflammatory
  mechanisms (particularly beneficial in the management of rheumatoid arthritis),
  or at high doses to eradicate a range of malignancies, or in circumstances of fulminant
  inflammatory conditions where conventional approaches have been futile. In this
  figure we emphasize the pleiotropic and discretely targeted actions of high-dose
  methotrexate, as a hypothetical intervention for SARS-CoV-2 triggered PANIC Attack.
  The viral infection produces a severe variant of COVID-19 following the simultaneous
  activation of the diverse limbs of the human immune network (). As such, productive
  therapeutic strategies are likely combinations of different agents targetting distinctly
  different mechanisms of immune activation, or monotherapies endowed with a diversity
  of actions capable of counteracting the PANIC Attack triggered by SARS-CoV-2. In
  A) we showcase methotrexate as a potent inhibitor of the folate-dependent enzyme
  systems, especially those which are essential in rapidly dividing cells; such as
  those of the hyper-activated immune system, given that the cell cycle synthesis
  (S) phase requires nucleoside precursors for the synthesis of both DNA and RNA by
  the de novo pathways; and as such for RNA replication of the SARS-CoV-2 agent. Other
  body cells overcome this base synthesis blockade by utilizing the so-called salvage
  pathways, where partially assembled and partially broken down bases can be utilized
  to complete the synthesis; which are not available to rapidly dividing cells and
  microbes such as SARS-CoV-2. MTX is polyglutamated following entry into cells, a
  molecular modification which serves to prevent its efflux back out of the cell.
  Once inside the cell, this form of the molecule effectively inhibits dihydrofolate
  reductase among other folate dependent enzyme systems, which ultimately inhibits
  the de novo biosynthetic pathways for purines and pyrimidines (necessary for both
  DNA and RNA); and as such it reduces RNA replication of the virus. In B) we illustrate
  the inhibitory effects of MTX on multiple transmembrane signaling pathways involved
  in inflammation, including the JAK-STAT pathways that are activated by a host of
  inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, GM-CSF, and IFNγ. We also
  illustrate the role of the NFκB signaling pathway for a series of inflammatory mediators
  such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, and for matrix matalloproteases. MTX inhibits the production
  of these inflammatory mediators, but also liberates reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  that then trigger JNK activation, which promotes p53 activity that inhibits NFκB
  (thereby blocking the effector functions of proinflammatory cytokines). Further
  JNK activation also activates the c-Fos and c-Fun pathways that culminate in pro-apoptotic
  gene expression and increased sensitivity to apoptosis. In C) we illustrate the
  ability of MTX to block HMGB1 binding to RAGE receptor, and thereby aborting the
  multiple downstream immune effector injury mechanisms that converge to destroy the
  lung alveoli in severe COVID-19. The attenuation of immune cell maturation, migration
  and transmigration across the alveoli epithelia (utilizing matrix metalloproteinases
  which digest fibronectin, collagen, and other matrix elements that constitute the
  integrity of tissue elements), and the release of cytokines and other inflammatory
  mediators by either active release mechanisms, or via their passive release secondary
  to the expulsion from damaged or dying cells are additional alveolar injury pathways
  that are blocked by MTX. In D) we emphasize a series of risk mitigation interventions
  that are crucial when using HDMTX-LR (all of which are further discussed in the
  text).
