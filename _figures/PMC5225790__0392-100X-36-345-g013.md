caption: 'VEGF/VEGFR signalling pathway in normal vs. NF2 Schwann cells [Avastin]:
  in normal Schwann cells VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), SEMA3A (semaphorin
  3 A) and SEMAF (semaphorin F) molecules and VEGFR (VEGF receptors), NRP (neuropilin)
  and Plexin receptors are normally expressed; in NF2 Schwann cells VEGF are normally
  expressed vs. lower expressed VEGFR; in addition to that, in NF2 Schwann cells NRP
  and Plexin receptors are normally expressed vs. lower expressed SEMA3A and SEMAF
  molecules (see boxes). VEGF typically binds to VEGFR2 [Panel 1] inducing endothelial
  proliferation, migration and permeability; VEGF can also compete with SEMA3A to
  bind to Neuropilin (NRP) receptors directly or can form a bridge between VEGFR2
  and NRP potentiating its signalling via VEGFR2 [Panel 2]; SEMA3A and SEMAF bind
  NRP1 and NRP2, respectively, to induce endothelial cell regression and diminished
  permeability [Panel 3]. Thus, Avastin [an anti-VEGF antibody], when administered
  in NF2 patients acts not only via VEGFR inhibition (as VEGFR are lower expressed
  in NF2 Schwann cells) but also because it displaces VEGF from binding to NRP and
  Plexin receptor, thus allowing SEMA3A and SEMAF to bind to these receptors inducing
  endothelial cell regression and diminished permeability [see Panel 3 (from Ruggieri
  et al., 2015  and Ruggieri et al., 2015 , adapted and modified).'
