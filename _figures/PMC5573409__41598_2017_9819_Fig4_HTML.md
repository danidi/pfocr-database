caption: Diagram of P53 signaling pathway with overlaid molecular activity prediction
  after heat stress. Diagram of canonical P53 signaling pathway showing up (red) and
  down (green) regulated genes immediately after heat stress (T1) (a), and one hour
  after heat stress (T2) (b) along with predictions on biological function. Cell survival
  and glycolysis (colored orange) are predicted to be increased, while apoptosis,
  autophagy, senescence, DNA repair, and mitochondrial respiration (colored blue)
  are predicted to be decreased at both time points. Cell cycle progression is predicted
  to be increased at T2 only after heat stress (b). The pathway and the molecular
  activity prediction analyses were generated through the use of QIAGEN’s Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity).
