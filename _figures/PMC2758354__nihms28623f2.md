caption: 'Potential mechanisms regulating the duration of Erk (extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase) activation. The left part of the scheme presents transient activation of
  Erk. This pathway culminates in dual phosphorylation within the activation segment
  of the kinase, followed by translocation of Erk, as well as its substrates, the
  p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (Rsk1 and Rsk2), to the nucleus. The upstream canonical
  cascade links a growth factor-induced dimer of receptor tyrosine kinases to sequential
  activation of Ras, Raf, and Mek, which is a dual-specificity kinase that phosphorylates
  Erk. The phosphorylated form of Erk decays very rapidly, primarily through the action
  of double-specificity phosphatases. Concurrently, the phosphorylated (P), active
  receptors undergo endocytosis and they are sorted to degradation in lysosomes by
  means of a mechanism that conjugates ubiquitin molecules (Ub) to the cytoplasmic
  tail of the receptor. While in the nucleus, Erk mediates increased transcription
  of a large group of genes, including the immediate early gene c-fos, which encodes
  the short-lived Fos protein. Prolonged activation of Erk enables it to phosphorylate
  the newly synthesized Fos protein, thereby stabilizing Fos and other factors involved
  in gene expression. Several mechanisms may prolong Erk activation (right part of
  the scheme): gene amplification and autocrine loops can increase receptor numbers
  and receptor activation at the cell surface. Alternatively, mechanisms that derail
  active receptors, shunting them to a recycling endosome, extend growth factor signals.
  Recruitment of a MAPK scaffold protein, MP1, to late endosomes may also prolong
  Erk signaling. Naturally occurring mutations (represented by asterisks) of growth
  factor receptors, Ras proteins and the downstream tier, namely Raf kinases, similarly
  help sustain MAPK activation. Likewise, delayed but sustained activation of Ras
  may take place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi.'
