caption: 'Maternal high salt diet and offspring ASD. Chronic consumption of high salt
  causes microbial dysbiosis in the maternal gut (A), which can then result in maternal
  immune system dysregulation: (a) increased differentiation of Th-17 cells and concomitant
  increased IL-17, (b) increased M1 macrophage activation with related cytokines and
  chemokines release, and (c) decreased Treg cell differentiation and regulatory M2
  macrophage activation. The altered maternal gut microbiota and increased IL-17 travel
  via placental circulation to the fetus (B). In the fetal intestine, the gut microbiota
  and increasing IL-17 serum levels could cause a similar immune dysregulation as
  in the maternal side. When circulating IL-17 reaches the fetal brain and causes
  the activation of IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), several mechanisms can be triggered:
  (1) IL-17 could hamper the development of the fetal blood brain barrier (BBB), (2)
  reduction of the proliferation of neuronal stem cells (NSC) which in turn decreases
  neuro and gliogenesis, (3) dysregulation of the Act1 signaling pathway which alters
  the expression of ERK protein, and (4) IL-17 can also over-activate microglia. The
  described changes contribute to the ASD-like phenotype observed after birth (C)'
