caption: The de novo biosynthesis of sphingolipids initiates in the endoplasmic reticulum,
  where L-serine and palmitoyl-CoA are condensed to form the initial sphingoid base,
  which subsequently undergoes reduction, N-acylation and desaturation to form ceramide.
  The newly synthesized ceramide is then transported to the golgi apparatus where
  it is converted to higher order sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin (SM) and glycosphingolipids
  (GSL). These are transported to the plasma membrane where they are used as structural
  components. SM and GSL can be degraded in the plasma membrane or lysosome to form
  ceramide which can be further deacylated back to sphingosine. Sphingosine can be
  phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P can be irreversibly degraded
  by S1P lyase or be dephosphorylated by phosphatases and utilized for the salvage
  pathway (red arrows).
