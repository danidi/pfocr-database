caption: Reduced A2AAR/NO signaling pathway may involve HIF nitration. It has been
  hypothesized that nitration of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) may control the expression
  of several genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Since adenosine
  requires HIF for the induction of VEGF-promoter activity and because this receptor
  triggers an intracellular signaling involving protein nitration in normal and preeclamptic
  endothelial cells, it is unknown (?) whether HIF-nitration after A2AAR stimulation
  might control HIF-binding to a specific site (including –975 to –968; and –962 to
  –956) in the VEGF promoter.
