caption: 'Mechanisms of internalization include (a) non-endocytic pathways: diffusion/active
  transport of small molecule therapeutics across the cell membranes and fusion of
  nanoparticles with the cell membrane, and (b) endocytic pathways: clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis, caveolae-mediated endocytosis, clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis
  and macropinocytosis. In an endocytic pathway, the cargo is presented to the early
  endosomes and get sorted into recycling endosomes that are either directly recycled
  back to the cell membrane or indirectly through the endosome recycling center, or
  late endosomes that fuse with lysosomes. One aspect of the sorting results in budding
  of early endosomes to form intraluminal vesicles, a component of multivesicular
  bodies that either mature into late endosomes or are fused with the cell membrane
  followed by releasing the intraluminal vesicles and their contents as exosomes.
  Drawing of subcellular organelles is not to scale. See text for references.'
