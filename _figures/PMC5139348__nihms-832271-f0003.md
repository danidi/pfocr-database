caption: 'ROS can be produced in B cells as a byproduct of mitochondrial function
  and by NADPH oxidases. It has been suggested that the Nox2-containing NADPH oxidase
  complex is responsible for the majority of ROS production in B cells. However the
  calcium- regulated NADPH oxidase Duox1 may play a role in specific B cell subsets
  (). Furthermore, the phenotypes of mice deficient in Ncf1 (an essential part of
  the Nox2 complex) or gp91phox (catalytic subunit of Nox2) differ from mice lacking
  the voltage-gated proton channel HVN1, which plays a role in maintaining NADPH oxidase
  activity (, , ). Thus, the exact mechanism of ROS production in B cells awaits further
  clarification. ROS produced downstream of the BCR serves as a signaling molecule
  and can affect B cell activation and function. Several lines of evidence suggest
  that Syk and the PI3K signaling pathways are activated in response to ROS, however
  the exact mechanism is not completely understood yet. Mitochondrial ROS can also
  affect cell fate by inhibiting Heme synthesis. Heme is known to inhibit Bach2 function
  and thereby relieving Bach2 mediating Blimp repression. Thus, increased ROS production
  can inhibit plasma cell development and favor class switch recombination by modulating
  Bach2 function. While ROS seems to contribute to B cell signaling and is essential
  for BCR mediated proliferation, excessive ROS production can lead to cell damage
  and ultimately to cell death. Abbreviations: ALA= Aminolevulinic acid, CoPIII= coproporphyrinogen
