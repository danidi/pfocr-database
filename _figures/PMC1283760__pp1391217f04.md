caption: Determination of the genes downstream of the PLD pathway. Among the 861 genes
  that showed transcript level changes in response to 4°C versus 22°C or in response
  to 4°Cethanol versus 4°CterButOH, 93 showed transcript level changes in response
  to both 4°C versus 22°C and to 4°Cethanol versus 4°CterButOH. These genes are potentially
  cold regulated via the PLD pathway. Of these 93 genes, 20 were down-regulated by
  the cold treatment, while 73 were up-regulated.
