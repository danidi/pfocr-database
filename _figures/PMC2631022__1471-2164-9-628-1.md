caption: ECM-receptor interaction pathway enriched by human switch-like genes. Nodes
  enriched for human bimodal genes are colored orange, while nodes also identified
  as bimodal in mouse orthologs are outlined in bold. In all, the overlap between
  bimodal human and bimodal mouse orthologs contains thirteen unique genes represented
  in seven unique nodes in the ECM-receptor pathway. Nodes colored in gray were not
  identified as bimodal, while white nodes are used for genes that are not represented
  on the HGU133A array.
