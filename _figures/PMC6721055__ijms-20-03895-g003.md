caption: 'SUMOylation regulates gene expression during Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)
  response to chemo- and differentiation therapies. Upper panel: In chemosensitive
  AML cells, chemotherapeutic drugs, in particular anthracyclines, induce the production
  of ROS through the activation of NADPH oxidases. This leads to the inactivation
  of SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes via the formation of a disulfide bond between their catalytic
  cysteines. This results in the deSUMOylation of cellular proteins (in priority those
  bound to chromatin) and participates in the regulation of specific genes such as
  DDIT3 and entry of cells into apoptosis. Lower panel: in non-promyelocytic AMLs,
  SUMO participates in silencing of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) target genes. Inhibition
  of SUMOylation favors ATRA-induced activation of specific genes and leads to cell
  differentiation, arrest of proliferation, and apoptosis.'
