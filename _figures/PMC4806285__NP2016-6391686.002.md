caption: Proposed model through which chronic stress and glucocorticoids (GCs) may
  contribute to Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. The model illustrates how chronic
  stress and high GC levels can trigger AD pathology; the figure is based on experimental
  evidence obtained in cellular and animal models of AD. Extended exposure to stress/high
  GC levels activates the amyloidogenic pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP).
  This so-called misprocessing of APP involves the sequential cleavage of APP by β-
  and γ-secretases, resulting in the generation of toxic amyloid β (Aβ). Subsequently,
  the cytoskeletal protein Tau, which is mainly localized in axons (red in the representation
  of a healthy neuron), becomes aberrantly hyperphosphorylated, catalyzed by glycogen
  synthase kinase (GSK3β) and/or cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). Hyperphosphorylated
  Tau is trafficked to, and accumulates in, the somatodendritic compartment, where
  it oligomerizes and forms insoluble aggregates (red in the diseased neuron). In
  addition, the abnormal conformation adopted by Tau and caspase 3-mediated truncation
  of Tau is accompanied by dysregulation of the molecular chaperones Hsp90 and Hsp70,
  which normally serve to promote Tau degradation (left panel). This cascade of events
  causes neuronal atrophy and loss, followed by cognitive impairments.
