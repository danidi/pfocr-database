caption: Effects of hyperuricemia through the activation of the polyol pathway for
  the induction of hepatic fat accumulation. Aldose reductase (AR), a key enzyme of
  the polyol pathway, activated by uric acid through an enrichment of nuclear factor
  of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5), shifts from glucose to sorbitol, contributing to
  an increment in fructose production. This increase of endogenous fructose results
  in triglyceride accumulation in the liver through the upregulation of ketohexokinase
  (KHK) by the transcription factor, carbohydrate response element‐binding protein
  (ChREBP), activated by uric acid. In the course of promoted fructose metabolism,
  mitochondrial oxidative stress and an impairment of adenosine triphosphate production
  are induced. *It is well known that hyperglycemia‐induced polyol pathway hyperactivity
  in diabetic complications of related tissues contributes to the development of diabetic
  complications. Thus, there is the possibility that hyperuricemia‐induced polyol
  pathway hyperactivity in target cells could cause the development of diabetic complications,
  and further their progression while in a hyperglycemic condition compared with a
  non‐hyperglycemic state.
