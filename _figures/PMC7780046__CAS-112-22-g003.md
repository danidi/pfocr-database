caption: Regulation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF‐κB) signaling by N‐myc downstream‐regulated
  gene 2 (NDRG2)/protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex. A central signaling component
  of the non‐canonical pathway is NF‐κB‐inducing kinase (NIK) and the NDRG2/PP2A complex
  regulating the kinase activity of NIK by dephosphorylation reaction. Homeostatic
  activation of the NF‐κB signaling system is known to be important in the development
  of adult T‐cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). The low expression of miR‐31 in ATLL cells,
  which is involved in the repression of NIK expression, leads to increase in NIK
  protein. In addition to this phenomenon, NIK is highly phosphorylated with high
  kinase activity due to low expression of NDRG2, and dysregulation of NDRG2/PP2A
  complex was found to be an important factor in activating the non‐canonical NF‐κB
  pathway. Moreover, the downregulation of NDRG2 expression also induces activation
  of the canonical NF‐κB pathway through activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex
  by constitutive activation of AKT, which is derived from the phosphorylation of
  PTEN caused by downregulation of NDRG2 in ATLL cells. Therefore, NDRG2 is one of
  the important regulatory factors of the NF‐κB pathway. This figure has been adapted
