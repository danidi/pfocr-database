caption: A proposed cell-signaling cascade underlying the enhancement of contextual
  fear conditioning by nicotine. Nicotine acts at high-affinity β2-subunit containing
  nAChRs to directly or indirectly gate calcium through NMDA receptors. Increased
  intracellular calcium may activate PKC, PKA, or Epac, which are all known to stimulate
  ERK activation. ERK is known to activate gene transcription through various transcription
  factors. Alternatively, an unknown cascade may be recruited after nicotine binding
  to β2-subunit containing nAChRs. Activation of transcription factors may mediate
  an increase in JNK1 mRNA transcription and lead to an increase in the activation
  of JNK1. Increased JNK1 activation may lead an enhanced memory through another round
  of transcriptional activity, activation of microtubule-associated protein (MAP),
  or other unknown actions. Dashed lines represent hypothetical signaling pathways
  that nicotine may modify to enhance contextual fear conditioning, and solid lines
  represent pathways that nicotine is known to modulate to enhance contextual fear
  conditioning.
