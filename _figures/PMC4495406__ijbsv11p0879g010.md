caption: A proposed mechanism for the effects of MH on cardiac insulin resistance
  in obese mice. MH might upregulate Akt (mainly Akt2) activity to ameliorate obesity-impaired
  cardiac insulin signaling. On the other hand, MH might attenuate oxidative stress-induced
  insulin resistance by activating the Akt-Nrf2 pathway. Lastly, MH might inhibit
  expression of CD36, which decreases FA uptake, and preserve the FA oxidation pathway
  (AMPK-Sirt1-PGC-1α), subsequently reducing intracellular lipid accumulation and
  finally reversing insulin signaling.
