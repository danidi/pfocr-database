caption: 'Molecular basis of immunomodulation by CTB. MKP1 expression plays a central
  role in immunomodulation by immunomodulatory agents like CTB. Extracellular inflammatory
  insult activates MAPK, p38 and JNK pathways, leading to generation of proinflammatory
  cytokines, resulting in an inflammatory response. Proinflammatory cytokines have
  an inhibitory effect on MKP1, which leads to further activation of the inflammatory
  response pathway (left side of diagram). CTB, as well as other anti-inflammatory
  agents augment MKP1 expression, which leads to inhibition of the pro-inflammatory
  cascade, thereby attenuating the inflammatory response (right side of diagram).
  MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MKP1: MAPK phosphatase-1; JNK: JUN N-terminal
  kinase.'
