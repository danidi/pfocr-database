caption: A new feedback loop for p53 pathway. p53 and Mdm2 form a negative feedback
  regulation loop in that p53 activation induces the Mdm2 expression and the latter
  then triggers the degradation of p53 to remove p53. Here we show that p53 and Δ113p53
  also form a negative feedback loop in that activation of p53 induces the expression
  of Δ113p53 that in turn acts specifically to antagonize p53's apoptotic activity
  without inactivating p53-promoted cell cycle arrest. We propose that Δ113p53 switches
  the p53 pathway to favor cell cycle arrest in response to developmental or stress
  signals.
