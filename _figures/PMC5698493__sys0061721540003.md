caption: 'Proposed mandelalide biosynthetic pathway. The trans-AT PKS pathway consists
  of 14 modules with proposed chain shortening mediated by a monooxygenase. Butyrolactone
  formation (as in mandelalides B to K) is proposed through the action of MndR, a
  homolog of Dieckmann cyclase MenB. Modules are numbered in red, and predicted substrates
  () are shown next to the respective KS domain. A cross indicates domains predicted
  to be catalytically inactive. Abbreviations: ACP, acyl carrier protein, also denoted
  by a filled black circle; AH, acylhydrolase; AT, acyltransferase; DH, dehydratase;
  ECH, enoyl-CoA reductase; ER, enoylreductase; GT, glycosyltransferase; HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA
  synthase; K, kinase; KR, ketoreductase; KS, ketosynthase; L, phospholipase; MOX,
  flavin monooxygenase; MT, C-methyltransferase; PPT, phosphopantetheinyltransferase;
  PS, pyran synthase; TE, thioesterase.'
