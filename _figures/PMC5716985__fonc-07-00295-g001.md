caption: The mechanism of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). (A) Cellular
  changes associated with EMT. Epithelial tumor cells are shown in light brown, and
  stromal cells are shown in cyan. EMT begins with alterations in gene expression
  of epithelial cancer cells (step 2) that determine loss of the epithelial phenotype
  accompanied by alterations in nearby stromal cells (shown as a shift of stromal
  cell color from blue to red) (step 3). Loss of cell-to-cell attachment receptors
  and integrins occurs and continues to step 4 and beyond. EMT allows the cells to
  increase their invasiveness determining degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM)
  proteins, cytoskeleton reconstruction, extravasation, angiogenesis, as well as anoikis
  and drug resistance (step 5). (B) The regulatory network of EMT. Some important
  extracellular molecules in the tumor microenvironment, such as TGF-β, HGF, FGF,
  EGF, and Wnt bind to their respective receptors to induce activation of intracellular
  pathway, such as MAPK, PI3K, and Wnt/β-catenin. In turn, they regulate induction
  of EMT-inducing transcription factors (EMT-TFs), including SNAIL, SLUG, ZEB, TWIST,
  and FOXC2, which are responsible for molecular and physical changes occurring during
  EMT. Also hypoxia contributes to trigger EMT and participates in the EMT regulatory
  network through activation of HIFs.
