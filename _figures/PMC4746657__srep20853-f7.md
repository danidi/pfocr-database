caption: Relatively short-term pre-incubation of complex 1 and 2 stabilized HIF-1α
  against degradation through ROS, thereby stimulates HIF and the neurotrophic downstream
  pathways VEGF, EPO and HO-1. Long-term pre-treatment with 1 eliminates intracellular
  ROS as catalase does and up-regulates HO-1 expression, which activates anti-apoptotic
  pathways (including VEGF pathway) by promoting heme cleavage to antioxidant (CO
  and biliverdin). In comparison, the intracellular ROS generation continuously induced
  by complex 2 causes cell cytotoxicity.
