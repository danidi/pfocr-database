caption: Participation of glucose in NADPH oxidase-mediated superoxide generation.
  A proposed scheme of how glucose during the reperfusion phase of stroke may contribute
  to oxidative stress via NADPH oxidase. As glucose is metabolized through the hexose
  monophosphate shunt, it generates NADPH. In the presence of activating stimuli,
  such as ischemia and other pro-inflammatory signals, NADPH oxidase is activated
  and through electron transfer, generates superoxide (O2·−). Superoxide can then
  lead to a variety of injurious downstream processes including blood brain barrier
  (BBB) disruption, edema formation, brain hemorrhage, further inflammatory signaling
  and cell death). This pathway is blocked by 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN) or apocynin
  at the sites shown. Apocynin, by virtue of its ability to inhibit NADPH oxidase
  activation, has been shown limit damage and complications of experimental stroke.
