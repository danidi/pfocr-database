caption: Illustration of mechanism depicts that ANG II treatment increases OLA1 expression,
  which endogenously interacts with and phosphorylates GSK3β, rendering it inactive.
  Thus, β-catenin phosphorylation decreases (degradation reduces) leading to cellular
  accumulation and translocation to nucleus from cytosol resulting in transcription
  of cardiac hypertrophy response genes such as NPPA and MYH7. Sustained activation
  of these genes, which is a feature of cardiac hypertrophy, ultimately leads to heart
  failure. HW/TL- Heart Weight/Tibia Length.
