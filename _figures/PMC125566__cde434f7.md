caption: 'Fig. 7. The proposed role of HBP1 in the Wnt signaling pathway. As described
  in the background, the Wnt signaling pathway is conserved in evolution and has an
  intricate role in cancer. When Wnt proteins bind to Frizzled receptors, a signaling
  cascade is triggered where the β-catenin protein becomes stabilized and can enter
  the nucleus to activate transcription of target genes through binding target HMG-box
  proteins. Lef/TCF proteins directly bind the DNA, and when bound to β-catenin activate
  transcription of target genes such as cyclin D1 and c-myc (reviewed in ; ). In normal
  tissues, the tumor suppressor protein, APC, along with a complex containing axin
  and GSK-3β, triggers the degradation of β-catenin when Wnt signaling is turned off.
  All three components are important for preventing accumulation of β-catenin; loss-of-function
  mutations in APC and axin are associated with colorectal and hepatocellular cancers.
  In addition, stabilizing mutations in β-catenin have been identified in many human
  cancers. With the literature of the Wnt pathway as a backdrop, the work in this
  paper supports a model in which HBP1 is a suppressor of Wnt signaling and is a negative
  regulator of proliferation in normal tissues. HBP1 can block Wnt signaling from
  four points in the pathway: Wnt itself, GSK3β inhibition, β-catenin and LEF/TCF.
  The endogenous cyclin D1 and c-myc target genes are also inhibited by HBP1 expression
  in a cell with a constitutive Wnt signaling pathway. Our data indicate that the
  probable mechanism is the inhibition of DNA binding by LEF and TCF through a physical
  interaction with HBP1. The same regions of HBP1 that are necessary for suppression
  of Wnt signaling are also required for growth inhibition in cells with a constitutive
  Wnt pathway. Thus, HBP1 may have a role in tumor suppression by inhibiting the Wnt
  signaling pathway.'
