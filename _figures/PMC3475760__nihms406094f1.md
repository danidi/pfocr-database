caption: As a key downstream target of PI3K-mediated signaling pathway in response
  to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors through receptor tyrosine kinase
  (RTK), Akt plays an important role in regulation of diverse cellular processes.
  In this pathway, several key factors, such as PTEN, Foxo and p53, are the potential
  targets for microRNA silencing. At the same time, as transcription factors, Foxo
  and p53 are able to regulate microRNA expression.
