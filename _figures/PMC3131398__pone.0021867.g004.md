caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to generate a network of direct connections
  between all identified proteins with altered expression. Grey filled boxes are the
  differentially expressed proteins. Most significant sub networks were shown in the
  figure. A Lipid Metabolism, Molecular Transport, Small Molecule Biochemistry. 24
  proteins out of 36 proteins in the network were confirmed with this analysis B Cellular
  Assembly and Organization, Skeletal and Muscular System Development and Function,
  Tissue Morphology. 22 proteins out of 33 proteins in the network were confirmed
  with this analysis. C Cellular Movement, Hematopoiesis, Immune Cell Trafficking.
  21 proteins out of 35 proteins in the network were confirmed with this analysis.
  D Genetic Disorder, Metabolic Disease, Embryonic Development. 21 proteins out of
  34 proteins in the network were confirmed with this analysis. E Lipid Metabolism,
  Small Molecule Biochemistry, Cancer. 16 proteins out of 33 proteins in the network
  were confirmed with this analysis.
