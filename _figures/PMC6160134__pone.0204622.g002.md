caption: Signaling through the TGF-β family of receptors activate several pathways,
  including NF-κB, MAPK/ERK, p38, and JNK pathways. These pathways regulate phosphorylation
  of Smad proteins, which in turn regulate cell survival and apoptosis. Transcripts
  shown in red were up-regulated and stabilized following infection of L929 cells
  with reovirus isolates c87 and c8, transcripts shown in light orange were up-regulated
  and stabilized following infection with isolate c87 or c8, transcripts shown in
  dark green were stabilized (but not up-regulated) following infection with isolates
  c87 and c8, and transcripts shown in light green were stabilized (but not up-regulated)
  following infection with isolate c87 or c8. This figure was created using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis software starting with the canonical pathway related to TGF-β signaling
  (right side of the figure), which was combined with transcripts related to apoptosis
  (left side of the figure). GDF15, VEGFA, DUSP1/2, KLF5, and CITED2 transcripts were
  added manually based on their relevance to TGF-β or apoptosis signaling pathways.
