caption: Upon encountering viral dsRNA with 5′ ppp and blunt end, the RNA binding
  domain (helicase-CTD) of RIG-I forms filamentous oligomers along the length of dsRNA
  in an ATP-dependent manner (). This filament formation brings together 2CARDs into
  proximity, and induces tetramerization of 2CARD while being tethered to the core
  filament via a 50 aa flexible linker (). Tetramerization of 2CARD may also be induced
  by K63-Ubn, which stabilizes the 2CARD tetramer by bridging between adjacent 2CARDs
  and wrapping around the tetramer (). The 2CARD tetramer resembles the lock-washer
  (helical ring) structure, which serves as a helical template that nucleates the
  MAVS CARD filament. MAVS CARD is anchored to the mitochondrial outer membrane via
  a ~400 aa long linker, which contains the TRAF binding sites. Filament formation
  of MAVS CARD would bring together multiple TRAF binding sites into proximity, which
  appears to be important for efficient recruitment of TRAF molecules and activation
  of further downstream signaling pathway (; ).
