caption: The cancer-associated pyruvate kinase isozyme (PKM2) offers a modern case
  study for teaching metabolic regulation by isozyme switching, allostery and covalent
  modification. PKM2 turns off in response to tyrosine kinase signaling, oxidative
  stress and low serine concentrations, thereby promoting flux through the oxidative
  pentose phosphate and serine biosynthetic pathways (bold arrows). These fluxes,
  in turn, drive tumor growth. Solid lines indicate metabolic fluxes (for simplicity,
  stoichiometry and some cofactors and reactions are not shown). Dashed lines indicate
  regulation. The mechanism by which pyruvate kinase inhibition increases pentose
  phosphate pathway flux remains unknown. Challenging students with unanswered questions
  can motivate them to engage in metabolism research. G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; F6P,
  fructose 6-phosphate; FBP, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate; GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; ribose-P, ribose 5-phosphate.
