caption: 'Double-strand break repair in mammalian cells. NHEJ, HR, MMEJ and SSA pathways
  compete for the repair of DSBs. Proteins involved in various stages of DSB repair
  are shown in teal. References for proteins involved at different stages can be found
  in references  and –. NHEJ is involved throughout the cell cycle, and HR is involved
  after replication, when the sister chromatid is available. A simple DSB occurring
  within euchromatin will be most likely repaired by NHEJ, while more complex DSBs
  or those in heterochromatin will initiate the full DNA damage response involving
  MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex and ATM protein. MRN at the DSB recruits ATM, which
  phosphorylates BRE1A/B complex leading to relaxation of chromatin, facilitating
  repair by either NHEJ or HR. MRN recruits CtIP to initiate resection. Extensive
  resection is performed upon recruitment of EXO1 or DNA2 and the resulting single-stranded
  DNA (ssDNA) 3′-overhang is rapidly coated by RPA. The ssDNA-RPA recruits ATRIP leading
  to activation of ATR. The RPA then is displaced by Rad51 to form a nucleoprotein
  filament and initiate synapsis, a search for homologous template and DNA strand
  invasion, leading to formation of a D-loop intermediate. Synapsis is central to
  all HR reactions, and subsequent resolution of the D-loop is accomplished by at
  least three different pathways: double-strand break repair (DSBR), synthesis-dependent
  strand annealing (SDSA), and break-induced replication (BIR). An alternative pathway,
  microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), which is active throughout the cell cycle,
  anneals short homologous sequences revealed by limited resection. Single-strand
  annealing (SSA) mediates repair when perfect repeats are revealed during end resection.'
