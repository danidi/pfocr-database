caption: 'Extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. The extrinsic pathway is
  initiated by binding of death ligands (e.g., FAsL, TNFα, TRAIL) to their receptors
  (Fas, TNFR1, TRAIL), resulting in the formation of the death-inducing signaling
  complex (DISC), which contains the death receptor, an adaptor molecule (possessing
  a death domain (DD) and a death effector domain (DED)) and pro-caspase 8. Caspase-8
  is autocatalytically activated and subsequently transmits the death signal to effector
  executioner caspases such as caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis. In the extrinsic
  pathway, bot death receptor and death ligands can recruit caspase-2-mediated activation
  of pro-caspase-8 to engage apoptosis (brown dashed lines). The intrinsic pathway
  is triggered by a number of factors, including DNA damage, hypoxia, growth factor
  deprivation, and ER stress. The death signal is sensed initially by the BH3-only
  protein, which then interacts with the downstream mediators of apoptosis (BAX and
  BAK). BAX and BAK undergo conformational changes, which lead to the formation of
  mitochondrial pores or increased permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane,
  releasing apoptogenic compounds such as cytochrome c. Cytochrome c binds to APAF-1
  along with pro-caspase-9 to form the apoptosome, which then activates caspase-9
  and subsequent downstream executioner caspase such as caspase-3, -6, or -7, leading
  to apoptosis. Caspase-2 can activate BID or increase MOMP upstream of the intrinsic
  pathway of activation (black dashed lines). Abbreviations: TNF-α, tumor necrosis
  factor-α; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; FADD, Fas-associated death
  domain protein; TRADD, TNF receptor-associated death domain protein; BID, BH3 interacting-domain
  death agonist; tBID, truncated BID; BAX, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer; BAK,
  Bcl-2 associated X protein; APAF-1, apoptotic protease activating factor-1; MOMP,
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeability.'
