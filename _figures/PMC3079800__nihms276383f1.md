caption: Two distinct NF-κB activation pathways have been described. The canonical
  (classical) NF-κB pathway is activated by a large number of stimuli, including tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin(IL)-1β,lipopolysaccharide(LPS), and CD40 ligand(CD40L).
  These stimuli induce the degradation of IκBα and the nuclear accumulation of mainly
  p50–RELA (p65) dimer, which regulate the expression of immunoregulatory and anti-apoptotic
  genes. The non-canonical (alternative) NF-κB pathway is activated by receptors that
  are involved in lymphoid tissue organogenesis and lymphocyte development, such as
  Lymphotoxin β receptor(LTβR), which induces processing of p100 to p52 and the nuclear
  accumulation of p52–RELB dimmers,results in mucosal addressin cellular adhesion
  molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19), CCL20, CCL25, interleukin
  (IL)-4, IL-10 responses.
