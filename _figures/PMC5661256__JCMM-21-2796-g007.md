caption: Schematic diagram of a signalling pathway related to anti‐apoptotic or anti‐inflammatory
  effects of polydatin on LTA‐induced injury. LTA can induce NFκB activation in a
  TLR2‐dependent or TLR2‐independent manner, leading to the release of downstream
  pro‐inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, LTA can increase the level of intracellular
  ROS, which induce apoptosis via activating caspases 9 and 3. In addition, NFκB acts
  as a pro‐apoptotic regulator involved in apoptosis signalling. However, the treatment
  of PD can suppress LTA‐induced injury by attenuating ROS generation and TLR2‐NFκB
  activation.
