caption: Supposed mechanism of EVE-induced EMT. The treatment with high doses of Everolimus
  activates the EMT pathway in tubular cells. It is known that mTORC2 complex participates
  in AKT activation (S473 phosphorylation) and AKT is a central signal pathway in
  renal EMT. Therefore, high concentrations of EVE, through a massive mTORC1 inhibition,
  may lead to a down-regulation of S6K and a subsequent hyper-activation of mTORC2
  that, sustaining the phosphorylation of AKT at S473, could induce a feedback loop
  that stimulates PI3K-AKT signaling activating the cellular/molecular machinery leading
  to renal fibrosis. In particular AKT, once activated, could induce, through the
  inhibition of GSK3, the nuclear translocation of β-catenin which stimulates the
  expression of EMT-associated genes.
