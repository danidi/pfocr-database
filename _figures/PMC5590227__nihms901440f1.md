caption: Schematic of the STAT3 pathway and therapeutic targets. (1) Cytokines and
  growth factors, such as IL-6 and EGF, bind to receptors to activate phosphorylation
  and cell signaling. Curcumin inhibits cell surface signaling, (2) STAT3 molecules
  are activated by phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue by activated RTKs, such as
  EGFR, or intracellular NRTKs like JAK or Src. Inactivation by dephosphorylation
  occurs by PTPRs. Targeted therapies, including the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib,
  inhibit these pathways. (3) Spontaneous dimerization of two phosphorylated STAT3
  molecules occurs via the reciprocal phosphotyrosine-SH2 interactions, and the homodimer
  translocates to the nucleus. Golotimod, an immunomodulating peptide, inhibits homodimerization
  of STAT3 molecules in the cytoplasm. (4) pSTAT3 homodimer binds to consensus sequences
  on the promotor regions of target genes. STAT3 decoy molecules are under development
  to target this step in the STAT3 transcription pathway. (5) The resultant transcripts
  are translated into pro-proliferative, pro-survival oncogenic proteins. (6) AZD9150
  is an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the translation of STAT3 mRNA.
