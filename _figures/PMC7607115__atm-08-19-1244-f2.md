caption: The model for TERT promoter mutations, TERT expression and telomerase activation
  during the pathogenesis of TC. Oncogenic events target BRAF/RAS for their mutations
  or RET-PTC/PAX8-PPARγ for their fusion in thyrocytes. These mutations or fusions
  result in the hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway and drive the thyrocytes to over-proliferate,
  which in turn leads to premature cell senescence so-called OIS. However, the pituitary
  gland may secrete increased amounts of TSH, through which TP53 function is inhibited.
  When this happens, cells bypass senescence or M1 phase and continue to proliferate,
  causing telomere dysfunction. Shortened telomeres are a key driving-force in triggering
  TERT promoter mutations and TERT expression. This group of patients with PTC/FTC
  may undergo M2 crisis and advance to PDTC or ATC or more aggressive PTC/FTC. De
  novo PDTCs and ATCs are most likely derived from their precursor cells that have
  undergone M2, and these cells acquire widespread TP53 inactivation and robust upregulation
  of TERT expression and telomerase activity. However, the majority of PTCs/FTCs lack
  TERT promoter mutations and many of them do not express TERT, but they have relatively
  longer telomeres in the tumors, and the disease is indolent. A minority of PTCs/FTCs
  express TERT mRNA, and a fraction of them undergo M2 crisis and progress. Conceivably,
  TERT/telomerase-deficient PTCs/FTCs are transformed without experiencing M2 crisis
  and thus lack significant chromosome aberrations. TERT, telomerase reverse transcriptase;
  TC, thyroid carcinoma; OIS, oncogene-induced senescence; TSH, thyroid-stimulating
  hormone; PTC, papillary thyroid carcinoma; FTC, follicular thyroid carcinoma; PDTC,
  poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma; ATC, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
