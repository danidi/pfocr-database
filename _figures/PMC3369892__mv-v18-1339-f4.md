caption: 'Immunocytochemical localization of the adrenomedullin (ADM) receptor calcitonin
  receptor like receptor (CRLR) and receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP2). A:
  The ADM receptor CRLR-like immunoreactivity (LI) was localized near the outer segments
  of photoreceptors (diagonal arrow), in faint somata in the outer nuclear layer (ONL;
  horizontal arrow), in puncta in the outer plexiform layer (OPL; asterisk), in select
  cell somata in the inner nuclear layer (INL; arrowhead), in delicate puncta in the
  inner plexiform layer (IPL), and in numerous somata in the ganglion cell layer (GCL;
  vertical arrow). B: RAMP2-LI was localized near the photoreceptor outer segments
  (diagonal arrow), in somata in the ONL (horizontal arrow), and in somata in the
  INL (arrowhead) and GCL (vertical arrow). Scale bars=20 µm. C: western blot of mouse
  retinal homogenate probed with the same CRLR and RAMP2 antisera used for immunocytochemistry.
  Both antisera recognized single proteins with the correct molecular weights.'
