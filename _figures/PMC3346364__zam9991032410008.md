caption: Degradation of phenylalanine and biosynthesis of TDA in P. gallaeciensis.
  Phe, phenylalanine; PP, phenylpyruvate; PhAc-CoA, phenylacetyl-CoA; PhAc, phenylacetate;
  TDA, tropodithietic acid; TCA cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle. Genes investigated
  in this study are shown in bold. Unknown reactions with respect to enzyme functions
  are indicated by question marks.
