caption: 'Mechanism of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 7 in angiogenesis of hepatocellular
  carcinoma. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 7 (CXCR7) activation promotes angiogenesis
  by regulating vascular endothelial growth factor and galectin-3 in hepatocellular
  carcinoma via the mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathway. This process
  occurs through activating the also known as Protein Kinase B signaling pathway,
  and the expression of also known as Protein Kinase B target proteins, including
  human tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8, is also induced
  by CXCR7; CXCR7 can promote tumor endothelial cells migration and invasion in hepatocellular
  carcinomas by phosphorylated serial advanced technology attachment 3 at Tyr705 to
  influence the signaling pathway and its downstream genes matrix metalloproteinase
  2 and vascular endothelial growth factor. CXCR7: Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor
  7; VEGF: Vascular endothelial growth factor; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein kinases;
  Akt: Also known as Protein Kinase B, PKB; TNFα: Human tumor necrosis factor-alpha;
  IL-6: Interleukin-6; IL-8: Interleukin-8; TEC: Tumor endothelial cells; STAT3: Serial
  advanced technology attachment 3; MMP-2: Matrix metalloproteinase 2; VEGF: Vascular
  endothelial growth factor.'
