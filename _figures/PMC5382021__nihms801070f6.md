caption: 'Top panel: WT GBS induces type I IFN by a cGAS-dependent pathway following
  bacterial DNA sensing, synthesis of 2′3′ cGAMP, and activation of the STING/TBK1/IRF3
  axis. The c-di-AMP released by GBS is degraded by the CdnP cell wall-anchored ectonucleotidase
  into AMP, which is further degraded by the second ectonucleotidase NudP into adenosine
  (Ado).Bottom panel: in the absence of the CdnP ectonucleotidase (GBS ΔcdnP* mutant),
  c-di-AMP accumulation outside the bacteria activates STING independently of cGAS,
  and, together with GBS DNA sensing by cGAS, leads to type I IFN over-production.'
