caption: Histamine signaling through different receptor types converges at cellular
  calcium levels. The four major types of histamine receptors interact with different
  Gα proteins as indicated. The subsequent steps in the signaling pathway are variable.
  However, one common feature is that they all affect cellular calcium levels.
