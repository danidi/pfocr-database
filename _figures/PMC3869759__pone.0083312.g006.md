caption: Overexpression of CHIP promoted degeneration of PTEN, which can increase
  the activation of PI3K pathway to promote the phosphorylation of FoxO3. FoxO3 binding
  to bim and pten promoters was inhibited and Bim and PTEN protein levels were decreased.
  Cells demonstrated apoptosis resistance, and the phosphorylation of AKT increased
  significantly. It formed a loop to reduce the PTEN protein level constantly.
