caption: A schematic representation of a modeled signaling pathway using a G Protein
  Coupled Receptor activation as an example. (A) In an illustrated pathway, the ligand
  (1) binds to the G protein coupled receptor (2). The G protein (α,β,γ) exchanges
  GDP for GTP and dissociates into the Gαs/i and the Gβγ subunits (3, 4, 5). The activated
  αs unit activates (6) and the activated αi subunit inhibits (7) adenylyl cyclase
  (8, 9) conversion of ATP to cAMP (10). We included PMID references that support
  each step throughout the pathway. (B) In a static representation of this pathway,
  the ligand PGE2 (1) binds to the G protein coupled receptor PTGER4 (2) in an activation
  pathway (green line) and PGE2 binds to GPR44 (11) in an inhibition pathway (red
  line). In the activation pathway, activated PTGER4_act, combines with inactive G
  protein (α,β,γ) (3) to form PTGER4act_GDP_GNAS_GNBC. PTGER4 and activated Gβγ subunit
  GNBC (5) dissociate. Activated Gαs/i subunit (4) provides the activation signal
  (8) to adenlyl cyclase ADCY1 to ADCY1_act (9) for the conversion of ATP to cAMP
  (10). In an inhibition pathway, activated GPR44_act combines with the inactive G
  protein (α, β, γ) GDP_GNAI_GNBC (3) to form GPR44_act_GDP_GNAI_GNBC. GPR44 and activated
  Gβγ subunit GNBC (5) dissociate. Activated Gαs/i subunit GTP_GNAI is inhibitory
  (7) to adenlyl cyclase ADCY1 to ADCY1_act (9) for the conversion of ATP to cAMP
  (10). (C) Dynamism is assigned to the static model at every step as illustrated
  for PGE2 binding to GPR44 (5) in the Activation Connector and at the activation
  and inhibition of the Reaction (3) of adenlyl cyclase ADCY1 to ADCY1_act (1, 2,
  3) in the Input/Output Connector (4) per Michaelis Menton kinetic equations containing
  reactant concentrations and rate of reactions (Vmax). (A) Was adapted from Molecular
