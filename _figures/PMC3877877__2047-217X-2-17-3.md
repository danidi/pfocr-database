caption: Two KEGG pathways from the aye-aye data. A) KEGG pathway diagram showing
  the genes with coding mutations involved in the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction
  pathway. Eleven genes with SNPs in the top 5% by LSBL score in the West aye-aye
  population appear in this pathway, including three with non-synonymous mutations
  (LAMC2, HSPG2, and LAMA3). These genes are grouped in 5 different functional units
  distributed along the pathway (i.e., collagen, laminin, tenascin, perlecan, and
  SV2, all shown in red). B) KEGG pathway diagram for the Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor
  biosynthesis pathway showing the central role of the PIG-N gene for GPI-anchor synthesis.
