caption: Timeline of the Ad5 binding, entry, and trafficking pathway. Initial attachment
  is mediated through the fiber-CAR interaction. Subsequent binding of the penton
  base RGD motifs to integrins results in signaling cascades and endocytic uptake.
  Endosomal acidification is sensed by the incoming virion, resulting in fiber release,
  vertex disassembly, exposure of protein VI, and lysis of the endosomal membrane.
  Cytoplasmic virions can then interact with dynein for transport along microtubules
  to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). Cellular export factor CRM1 then mediates
  transfer to the nuclear pore complex (NPC) where the virion binds, disassembles,
  and releases its genome into the host cell nucleus.
