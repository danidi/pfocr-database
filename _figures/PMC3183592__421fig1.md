caption: Normal hepatic methionine metabolism. In transmethylation reactions, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
  (5-MTHF) is substrate with homocysteine in the vitamin B-12–dependent methionine
  synthase (MS) reaction to yield tetrahydrofolate (THF) and methionine. In the alternative
  betaine hydroymethyltransferase (BHMT) reaction, betaine is substrate with homocysteine
  to yield methionine and dimethylglycine (DMG). Methionine is substrate for methionine
  adenosyltransferase (MAT) to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the substrate and
  methyl donor for all methyltransferases (MT) reactions including those for DNA and
  histones. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is substrate with SAM for phosphatidylethanolamine
  methyltransferases (PEMT) to yield phosphatidylcholine (PC). Glycine-n-methyltransferase
  (GNMT) (not shown in figure) converts glycine to sarcosine. S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH) is produced by all MT reactions, and is substrate for the bidirectional enzyme
  SAH hydrolase (SAHH), which yields homocysteine in the forward direction, or SAH
  when excess homocysteine is substrate for the reverse direction. In the transsulfuration
  pathway, cystathionine β synthase (CβS) is vitamin B-6–dependent and is facilitated
  by SAM as the initial step in reduction of homocysteine to yield cystathionine,
  which is then substrate for vitamin B-6–dependent cystathionase to yield cysteine
  and α-aminobutyrate (ABU) and ultimately glutathione (GSH).
