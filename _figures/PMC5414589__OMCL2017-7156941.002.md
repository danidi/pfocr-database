caption: Schematic diagram of NF-κB pathway. The → indicates activation or induction,
  and the “⊢” indicates inhibition. Under oxidative stress conditions, p65/p50 NF-κB
  is activated. Meanwhile, IκB kinase promotes the phosphorylation of IκB, causing
  IκB to separate from NF-κB. Then, NF-κB is translocated from the cytoplasm to the
  nucleus, where it is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival.
