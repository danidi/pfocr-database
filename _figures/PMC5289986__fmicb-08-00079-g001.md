caption: LAI-1-mediated intra-species and inter-kingdom signaling of Legionella pneumophila.
  The amoebae-resistant opportunistic pathogen L. pneumophila colonizes different
  niches in the environment, including biofilms and protozoa. L. pneumophila employs
  a bi-phasic life cycle, alternating between a replicative and a stationary/transmissive
  phase. As a major regulator of the growth phase switch L. pneumophila employs the
  Lqs system, which produces, detects, and responds to the AHK (α-hydroxyketone) signaling
  molecule LAI-1 (Legionella autoinducer-1; 3-hydroxypentadecane-4-one). The Lqs system
  comprises the autoinducer synthase LqsA, the sensor kinases LqsS and LqsT, as well
  as the response regulator LqsR. The system regulates the bacterial growth phase
  switch, virulence, motility, filaments, and competence. LAI-1 not only promotes
  bacterial cell–cell communication and quorum sensing, but also modulates the migration
  of eukaryotic cells through a pathway requiring the scaffold protein IQGAP1, the
  small GTPase Cdc42 and its activator ARHGEF9. The eukaryotic LAI-1 receptor(s) is/are
  unknown [?]. Solid and dashed lines represent known/direct or hypothetical/indirect
  pathways, respectively.
