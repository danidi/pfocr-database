caption: MiRNAs serves as both effectors and modulators of the DNA damage response
  (DDR). MiRNAs modulate DDR elements from DNA damage sensing through the key ATM/ATR
  pathway, and also checkpoint elements such as p53 and cdc25a. For a detailed review
  of miRNA interaction with p53 including mutant p53 please refer to review by Suzuki
  et al. Illustrations for cellular components are courtesy of Servier Medical Art
