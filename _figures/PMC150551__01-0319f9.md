caption: Scheme of the Functional Domains of SLR1 for the GA Signaling Pathway.The
  GA signal (yellow circle) is received by the signal perception domain, which consists
  of the conserved DELLA and TVHYNP regions and the nonconserved spacer region (red).
  The SLR1 received with the GA signal is degraded rapidly and disappears in the nuclei.
  The leucine zipper domain (dark blue) is essential for dimer formation by SLR1.
  The C-terminal half of SLR1 (blue), which is shared with other GRAS family genes,
  functions as a repression domain to prevent the action of GA. The Ser/Thr/Val-rich
  region (green) may work as a regulatory domain through the target sites of O-GlcNAcylation–phosphorylation
  regulation (see text for details).
