caption: mRNA microarray analysis (microarray cohort; n = 36 GBMs) revealed SVZ-dependent
  differential gene expression of key hierarchies of the Notch pathway. Results are
  visualized comparing group II (contacting the SVZ only) and group III (involving
  the cortex only) GBMs, since this grouping discriminates most precisely between
  GBMs with and without SVZ involvement. In group II GBMs, significant overexpression
  (p < 0.05; highlighted in red) was observed for DLL3 (ligand to Notch receptors),
  NOTCH2 (Notch transmembrane receptor), and HES4 (nuclear target gene to Notch signaling;
  tissue-specific transcription repressor). For PSEN2 (presenilin2) and NCSTN (nicastrin),
  two components of the presenilin-gamma-secretase complex that is involved in cleavage
  of the intracellular Notch receptor domain, and MAML3 (mastermind like transcriptional
  coactivator 3; amplifies Notch-induced transcription), overexpression did not reach
  significance (highlighted in yellow)
