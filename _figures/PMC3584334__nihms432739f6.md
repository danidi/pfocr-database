caption: CBF and CFTR are activated through the PKA-dependent pathway. Cl− is transported
  via the basal membrane through basolateral potassium channels (NKCC-1) and secreted
  through CFTR at the apical surface. TMEM16A is a recently identified calcium-activated
  Cl− channel that also contributes to apical anion transport.[] Activators (forskolin,
  quercetin) are indicated by the blue arrows; inhibitors by the red arrows (amiloride,
  CFTRinh-172, H89). The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is the primary apical Na+
  channel. Quercetin is thought to act as a CFTR channel activator through its interactions
  with the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) rather than activation (phosphorylation)
  of the Regulatory Domain (RD).[] Quercetin also stimulates CBF through either localized
  changes in the composition of the periciliary fluid or an unknown mechanism of direct
  activation.
