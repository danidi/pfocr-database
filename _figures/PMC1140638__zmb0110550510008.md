caption: Proposed model of Tiam1 and IRSp53 signaling. IRSp53 links Tiam1/Rac signaling
  to actin. IRSp53 has a role in multiple pathways involving actin dynamics through
  interaction with at least two scaffold proteins and two Rho family GTPases. Tiam1
  directs IRSp53 to a pathway involving WAVE2 and Rac. Interaction of IRSp53 with
  Tiam1, stimulated by Ras activation, leads to preferential binding of IRSp53 to
  WAVE2 and Rac-GTP. WAVE2 assembles in a protein complex with multiple regulatory
  proteins, including Abi1 and Rac effector proteins Sra-1/Pir121 and Nap1 (Nck-associated
  protein). These proteins regulate WAVE function with respect to the Arp2/3 complex
  and actin polymerization, although their precise roles in terms of positive and
  negative regulation are still being elucidated. The generation of Rac-GTP at the
  complex by Tiam1 triggers Arp2/3-mediated polymerization of actin monomers and changes
  in actin morphology characteristic of Rac signaling.
