caption: A model of Tdrkh function in piRNA biogenesis and the Piwi-piRNA pathway.
  Mili-associated piRNA precursors (red line) are selected and loaded into Mili complexes
  and processed into intermediates. Tdrkh recruits or facilitates activity of a 3′
  exonuclease, ‘trimmer', in the nuage, which proceeds to trim the intermediates to
  mature piRNA length. In addition, in embryonic testes, Tdrkh may function in transferring
  mature piRNAs or piRNA intermediates between Mili and Miwi2 complexes. Mili- and
  Miwi2-piRNA complexes proceed to enact epigenetic regulation, transposon (Tn) repression,
  translational regulation, and possibly surveillance of genomic integrity. In response
  to indefensible attacks on genomic integrity, Tdrkh may function in sensing or transducing
  apoptotic responses to mitochondria. See Discussion for details.
