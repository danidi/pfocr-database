caption: Human telomeres consist of many kilobases of TTAGGG repeats, with a G rich
  leading strand and a C rich lagging strand. The G strand extends in the 3’ direction,
  forming the G-tail. The shelterin complex , consisting of the double stranded telomeric
  repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2, the TRF2 interacting factor RAP1, the bridging
  molecules TIN2 and TPP1 and the telomeric protection factor POT1, together covering
  the double and single stranded repeats. Shelterin members interact with a large
  number of other factors that transiently localize to telomeres, frequently in a
  cell-cycle dependent manner. These factors aid in the generation of a protective
  structure at chromosome ends, here referred to as telomeric loop, or T-loop. The
  T loop is generated by invasion of the single stranded G-overhang into the double
  stranded TTAGGG repeats. The looped structure protects telomeres on several levels.
  Invasion effectively sequesters the G-tail, and allows distinction of natural chromosome
  ends from double stranded breaks. The ATM dependent signaling cascade is inhibited
  by TRF2 and the ATR signaling pathway by POT1. Telomerase is likely inhibited by
  the complex, and it is suspected that TERRA play a role in this inhibition.
