caption: 'Nrf2-NFkB cross-talk during the tBHQ PreT model. Mitochondrial dysfunction
  caused by inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in the presence of 3-NP is
  characterized by ATP depletion along with ROS generation, causing striatal GABAergic
  cell death. tBHQ, once metabolized, plays a dual (antioxidant/pro-oxidant) role
  due by generation superoxide anion (•O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (red and blue
  stars, respectively), who oxidize Keap-1 and allow Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Nrf2
  along with small Maf binds to the ARE/EpRE (antioxidant response element/electrophiles),
  allowing the transcription of genes for antioxidants enzymes such as superoxide
  dismutase (SOD), exerting neuroprotection and maintaining cellular architecture,
  protected against neuronal cell death and reactive gliosis reactive, probably by
  decreasing ROS. The ROS produced by tBHQ metabolism also allow the activation of
  other transcription factors such as NFκB, which is sensitive to changes in redox
  state, and which initiates different cellular responses against stress in old animals.
  NFκB in the nucleus binds the IRE (inflammatory response element) permitting transcription
  of genes related to inflammatory response. Interestingly, ROS produced by tBHQ redox
  cycles might cause lipid damaged, thus playing a dual antioxidant/pro-oxidant role.
  The crosstalk mechanism between NFκB and Nrf2 illustrates the NFκB transcriptional
  activation and its putative interaction with Maf or other Nrf2 regulatory proteins.
  Conversely, Nrf2 signaling activation and consequent NFκB pathway inhibition has
  been demonstrated elsewhere . Abbreviations: P, phosphorylation; Ub, ubiquitination;
  Maf, small Maf proteins; CBP, CREB-binding protein; Cul3, (Cullin3)-based ubiquitin
