caption: A model for the regulation of early TH2 differentiation by TCR signal strength.
  When naive CD4+ T cells receive strong TCR signals (right), prolonged and intense
  activation of the Erk pathway results in not only the failure to upregulate TCR-driven
  early expression of GATA-3 but also transient inhibition of IL-2-mediated activation
  of STAT5, at least during the first 24 hours after stimulation, despite the abundant
  IL-2 production and IL-2R expression. This defect in both GATA-3 upregulation and
  STAT5 activation leads to a lack of both early production of IL-4 and subsequent
  TH2 differentiation. In contrast, when naive CD4+ T cells receive weak TCR signals
  (left), the degree of activation of the Erk pathway is not strong enough to suppress
  TCR-driven early expression of GATA-3 or to block STAT5 activation in response to
  small amounts of IL-2, which allows T cells to generate early production of IL-4
  and to undergo subsequent TH2 differentiation.
