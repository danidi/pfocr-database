caption: The generation of extracellular adenosine as a component of an anti-inflammatory
  microenvironment. Extracellular ATP arises as a result of cell death, either from
  the host or pathogen, as can itself be inflammatory. The two ectoenzymes CD39 and
  CD73 are normally co-expressed constitutively on Treg cells, but can be induced
  on the surface of many different cell types, including conventional T cells, dendritic
  cells, and macrophages, in the presence of a source of TGFβ. These enzymes sequentially
  convert extracellular ATP to AMP and then adenosine. Adenosine can then act either
  by binding to the A2A receptor on T cells and DC, which signals via cAMP or it can
  be taken up via adenosine transporters where it is rapidly converted to intracellular
  AMP by adenosine kinase. These two signaling pathways act to inhibit inflammation
  and T cell proliferation. AMP activated kinase mediated inhibition of the mTOR pathway
  can then occur downstream of either signaling pathway.
