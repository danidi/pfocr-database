caption: Role of nNOS in TDS stress. Immediately after an acute stress, NO is released
  via the action of adrenal glucocorticoids and the sequential release of glutamate
  in the hippocampus, activation of NMDA receptors, and the influx of Ca2+ leading
  to the activation of nNOS. 5HT released as a consequence of stress acts on 5HT2
  receptors activating constitutive nNOS via the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. NO
  then exerts various neuromodulatory effects () as well as promotes the cellular
  processes of plasticity and memory either via itself, or by the synthesis of its
  second messenger, cGMP. However, NO prevents this cascade from progressing indefinitely
  by inhibiting its own synthesis (nNOS), inhibiting NMDA receptor function, promoting
  GABA release that further attenuates glutamate activity and by inhibiting the expression
  of iNOS. 5HT also inhibits guanylate cyclase-cGMP, thereby also effectively down-regulating
  the NO-pathway. Raised glucocorticoids inhibit cytokine release preventing any possible
  mobilization of iNOS. Shortly after the immediate response to a stressful event,
  glucorticoids then shut down the cortisol response by feedback inhibition of the
  HPA axis. Solid lines indicate activation; broken lines indicate inhibition. (Abbreviations
  are listed at the end of the paper.)
