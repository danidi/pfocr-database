caption: The canonical nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway is triggered by signals from
  a large variety of immune receptors, which activate the kinase TGFβ -activated kinase
  1 (TAK1). TAK1 then activates a trimeric IκB kinase (IKK) complex, composed of catalytic
  (IKKα and IKKβ) and regulatory (IKKγ) subunits, via phosphorylation of IKKβ. Upon
  stimulation, the IKK complex, largely through IKKβ, phosphorylates members of the
  inhibitor of κB (IκB) family, such as the prototypical IκB member IκBα and the I
  κB-like molecule p105, which sequester NF-κB members in the cytoplasm. IκBα associates
  with dimers of p50 and members of the REL family (RELA or c-REL), whereas p105 associates
  with p50 or REL (RELA or c-REL). Upon phosphorylation by IKK, IκBα and p105 are
  targeted for ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent degradation in the proteasome, resulting in
  the nuclear translocation of canonical NF-κB family members, which bind to specific
  DNA elements, termed κB enhancers of target genes, in the form of various dimeric
  complexes, including RELA–p50, c-REL–p50, and p50–p50 (). By contrast, non-canonical
  NF- κB signalling is based on the processing of p100, an IκB-like molecule that
  predominantly, although not exclusively, regulates RELB. The non-canonical NF- κB
  pathway selectively responds to a subset of tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)
  superfamily members that target the activation of the kinase NFκB-inducing kinase
  (NIK). NIK phosphorylates and activates IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates carboxy-terminal
  serine residues of p100, triggering selective degradation of the C-terminal IκB-like
  structure of p100 and leading to the generation of p52 and the nuclear translocation
  of p52 and RELB. PRRs, pattern recognition receptors.
