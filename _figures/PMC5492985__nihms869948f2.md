caption: (A) CSL (green) interacts with NICD (dark blue) through the high affinity
  WFP tri-peptide (hidden by RBPj) and the low affinity ANK domain, positioned at
  optimal distance by the RAM domain. MAML1 (red) binds to the interface between the
  ANK and the CSL, and recruits the histone acetylases p300 (pink). P300 convers H3K27
  to H3K27ac, a modification enriched in enhancers. Details on specifically how the
  Notch TAD stimulates transcription are lacking. (B) in the absence of NICD, the
  short term consequences include recruitment of Kdm5a to the chromatin and loss of
  H3K4me3. This is a reversible state. (C) If CKII activity is low or absent, Mint/SHARP
  will instead recruit Kmt2D which will maintain chromatin in the permissive H3K27ac
  and H3K4me3 state, bookmarking the site for future Notch-mediated activation. (D)
  in cells lacking NICD and containing active CKII, RBP recruits phosphorylated Mint/SHARP,
  which bings to NCor. This complex is associated with Histone deacetylases (HDAC)
  that restore H3K27. The Ezh2 protein in the PRC2 complex than converts H3K27 to
  H3K27me3, establishing a repressed state propagated further by removal of methyl
  groups from K4 by Kdm1b.
