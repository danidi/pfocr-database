caption: Model of how linkage-specific ubiquitin chain editing by OTUD5 controls development
  and is mis-regulated in disease. During normal early embryogenesis, OTUD5 uses its
  K48 linkage–specific deubiquitylation activity to target and stabilize several key
  chromatin regulators to coordinate chromatin remodeling events at CNS precursor
  and neural crest enhancers. This allows binding of lineage-promoting transcription
  factors (TF) to drive transcriptional networks required for neuroectodermal cell
  fate commitment. Hypomorphic patient mutations in OTUD5 result in dysregulation
  of this pathway and lead to a previously unrecognized multiple congenital anomaly
  disorder we name LINKED syndrome.
