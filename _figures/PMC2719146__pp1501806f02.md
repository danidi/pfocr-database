caption: Overview of capsaicinoid biosynthesis in a cellular context. A, Capsaicinoid-producing
  cells from a hot pepper stained with crystal violet. Bar = 50 μm. This image is
  reproduced with permission from the Journal of Experimental Botany (). B, Capsaicinoid
  biosynthetic pathway modeled in this cell. Chorismate is produced from the shikimate
  pathway (step 1), which is used to synthesize Phe in the plastid (step 2). In the
  cytoplasm, associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, Phe is converted to feruloyl-CoA
  by phenylpropanoid metabolism (step 3) and is likely converted to vanillylamine
  by an unknown enzyme in an unknown compartment (step 4). Pyruvate is the precursor
  to Val (step 5), which is exported to the mitochondria and catabolized to isobutyryl-CoA
  (step 6). Isobutyryl-CoA returns to the plastid, where it is elongated to 8-methylnonenoic
  acid by the fatty acid synthase (step 7). Export from the plastid is concomitant
  with formation of the CoA thioester. The location and mechanism of the final condensation
  and export of capsaicin out of the cell (step 8) are debated. The biosynthesis of
  capsaicin is shown, other capsaicinoids are formed through variation in steps 5
  to 7, and ester forms of the molecule are likely formed by variation in steps 3
  and 4. [See online article for color version of this figure.]
