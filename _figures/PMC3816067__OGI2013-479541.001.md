caption: Hormone receptors in endometrial tumors. In ER-α dependent tumors (left side),
  estrogen induces growth factors and PR through ER-α. This creates a positive feedback
  loop between ER-α and growth factor signaling. However, progesterone (P4), when
  bound to PR, downregulates ER and PR. In addition, MAPK activation downstream of
  growth factor signaling results in phosphorylation of ER and PR and the ligand-dependent
  loss of PR and ER proteins by ubiquitination-mediated proteasomal degradation. ER-α
  and PR levels are increased again at the level of transcription by estrogen stimulation.
  Hence, the growth of these tumors is dependent upon estrogen and is limited by progesterone,
  suggesting that the patient will respond to progestin hormonal therapy. High expression
  of ER-β, if present, can inhibit the function of ER-α. For GPR30 dependent tumors
  (right panel), we hypothesize that proliferation is driven by the constitutive activation
  of one or more components of a growth factor pathway. Growth does not depend upon
  the presence of estrogen and is not limited by progesterone. Also, the classical
  steroid hormone receptors are downregulated as a result of constitutive phosphorylation
  via MAPK. This is predicted because the phosphorylation of the receptors leads to
  its targeting the proteasome for degradation. By virtue of the constitutive activation
  of a growth factor pathway, such tumors grow independently of classical hormonal
  signaling.
