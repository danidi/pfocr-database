caption: 'TRAIL-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway overview: Binding of TRAIL to
  cognate TRAIL receptor, TRAIL-R1/2 results in receptor oligomerization and recruitment
  of Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) and caspase-8 to form a functional
  death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). Upon DISC formation, caspase-8/-10 is cleaved
  and activated, which in turn can cleave and activate caspase-3 and the BH3-only
  protein Bid. Active, cleaved BID (tBid) can bind to pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK, resulting
  in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and release of mitochondrial proteins
  cytochrome c. Cytochrome c, apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1) and caspase-9
  combine with ATP to form a functional apoptosome that results in cleavage and activation
  of caspase-9, which can then cleave caspase-3. Caspase-3 can cleave a large number
  of intracellular targets resulting in the morphological and biochemical hallmarks
  of apoptosis (Stuckey and Shah, 2013 []). Upon TRAIL stimulation, MuD activation
  by caspase-3 occurs prior to Bcl-2 cleavage and Bid may be essential for the regulation
  of MuD expression and function upon TRAIL stimulation. Abbreviations: TRAIL, tumor
  necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; APAF-1, apoptotic protease
  activating factor-1; Bid; BH3-interacting domain death agonist; Bcl-2, B cell chronic
  lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2; BAK, Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer; BAX, Bcl-2-associated
  protein; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; cFLIP, cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein;
  DISC, death-inducing signaling complex.'
