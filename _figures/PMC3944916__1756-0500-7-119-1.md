caption: Glucocorticoid synthesis pathway in rodent and non-rodent mammals. Corticosterone
  (rodent) and cortisol (non-rodent mammals) are the most potent circulating GCs.
  Their production from cholesterol in adrenals correspond to the classical pathway
  of GC synthesis. There is no P450c17 enzyme in the rodent adrenal. Cell-specific
  11β-HSD-catalyzed reactions occur in peripheral tissues. During the last decade,
  expression of some or all the enzymes catalyzing GC production from cholesterol
  has been observed in some non-adrenal tissues including the developing lung.
