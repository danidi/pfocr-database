caption: 'Schematic representation of the SARS-CoV2 replication cycle and potential
  targets of CQ/HCQ. Entry of the virus can be seen in the steps numbered: Step1 is
  entry of virus, Step2 is activation of the virus, Step3 is viral replication, Step4
  is viral protein synthesis, Step5 is transport across ER and GA, Step6 is assembly
  of virions, Step7 is budding and exocytosis of virions. The plausible mode of action
  of HCQ is via the following means I. Blocking virus entry, II. Blocking viral transport,
  III. Blocking fusion of endosome-viral envelope, IV. Inhibiting MAPK pathway, V.
  Modulating M protein and VI. Interference in TLR signaling pathway'
