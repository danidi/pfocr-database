caption: 'Visualisation of differences in glycolysis, TCA-cycle, valine metabolism
  and erythromycin biosynthesis at three omics levels. Presented data is from fermentation
  time point t2. Node (label) legend: circle: gene (locus tag), blue rectangle: protein
  (protein name), yellow octangle: metabolite (metabolite name). Circle centre and
  rim colours represent log2 (fold change between HP and WT) for gene and protein
  expression, respectively (see colour key). A red arrow next to a circle indicates
  upregulation in our 2D gel experiment, and a green arrow indicates downregulation.
  Gene mutations in the HP strain are indicated by magenta coloured gene labels. The
  inset shows a schematic representation of the proposed changes in metabolic flow
  between HP and WT strains. In the HP strain, key points of entry into the TCA cycle
  are likely restricted due to downregulation of pdh, sdh, and fdh (shown as thin
  red lines). Combined with the upregulation of ilvB, this could divert the flow of
  metabolites towards the biosynthesis/degradation pathway of branched-chain amino
  acids (shown as thick blue lines), resulting in increased supply of methylmalonyl-CoA
  and propionyl-CoA, key precursors for erythromycin synthesis'
