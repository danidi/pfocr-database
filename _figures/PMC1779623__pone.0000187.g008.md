caption: 'We hypothesize that the two different populations of cells, the Insulin
  Producing Cells (IPCs) and the feminising cells (FCs), located in the pars intercerebralis
  control, by two distinct ways, the JH synthesis/release by the corpus allatum. The
  informative way (in yellow), which could be feminised, might control the level or
  the timing of the JH release, while the permissive way (in green) might control
  or allow the presence of the molecular machinery, as the transcription of the HMGCR,
  to promote the JH synthesis. In magnification: in the corpus allatum, insulin binds
  to its receptor (InR), which activates SREBP. In turn, SREBP regulates the transcription
  of hmgcr gene.'
