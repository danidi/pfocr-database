caption: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may have both growth inhibitory and stimulatory
  effects on tumours. The literature is divided on the impact that MSCs have on tumour
  growth with both (A) growth stimulatory and (B) inhibitory effects described. (A)
  Possible mechanisms for increased tumour proliferation include (i) reduced immunosurveillance
  secondary to MSC-induced T cell, B cell and natural killer (NK) cell suppression;
  (ii) promotion of motility, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells by CCL5 release;
  and (iii) interleukin 6 (IL6) release leading to STAT-3 phosphorylation and tumour
  cell proliferation. (B) Possible mechanisms for tumour inhibition include (i) promotion
  of cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis; (ii) inhibition of Akt activity; (iii)
  downregulation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB); and (iv) downregulation of the Wnt pathway
  by the release of the soluble inhibitor Dickkopf1 (DKK1), both of which reduce cancer
  cell proliferation.
