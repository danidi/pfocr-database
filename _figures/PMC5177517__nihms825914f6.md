caption: Proposed model for the mechanism of SNRK regulation of ROCK activity. ROCK
  is a major downstream effector of the small GTPase RhoA. Upon activation, ROCK can
  influence cellular contraction by phosphorylating myosin-binding subunit (MBS, also
  known as MYPT-1) of the myosin phosphatase complex. Phosphorylation of the myosin
  phosphatase complex renders the complex inactive and it is no longer able to remove
  the active phosphate group from phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC). Phosphorylated
  MLC is active and able to promote cellular contraction. SNRK regulates this process
  by modulating ROCK activity via phosphorylation of ROCK. ROCK can also influence
  ERK phosphorylation and nuclear localization as well as activate PTEN, which in
  turns inhibits the PI3K pathway resulting in the inhibition of phospho-AKT.

  description: Proposed model for the mechanism of SNRK regulation of ROCK activity.
    ROCK is a major downstream effector of the small GTPase RhoA. Upon activation,
    ROCK can influence cellular contraction by phosphorylating myosin-binding subunit

    SNRK regulates this process by modulating ROCK activity via phosphorylation of

    well as activate PTEN, which in turns inhibits the PI3K pathway resulting in the
    inhibition of phospho-AKT.
