caption: Dynamics of mitochondrial quality control. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles
  that are continuously remodelled by fusion and fission events. In this figure, mitochondrial
  fission is represented as one step of the mitochondrial life cycle involved in the
  maintenance of a pool of viable mitochondria. In this model, mitochondria can also
  employ fission to segregate defective daughter mitochondria based on a mechanism
  that requires OPA1. These defective mitochondria can follow three separate routes.
  They can be repaired through molecular quality control pathways that possibly involve
  p38, PINK1 and HtrA2. The defective mitochondria can also be selectively removed
  through autophagy using a mechanism that involves the PINK1-dependent recruitment
  of the ubiquitin ligase Parkin (1), followed by the ubiquitination of proteins such
  as VDAC1 and MFN2 (orange and green colours, respectively; purple ubiquitin) (2).
  Such ubiquitinated proteins might then work as adaptors for p62/SQSTM1 and promote
  the translocation of defective mitochondria to the autophagosome. Finally, if both
  molecular and organellar quality control mechanisms fail, mitochondria will ultimately
  release pro-apoptotic proteins (as indicated on the upper right of the figure),
  leading to cell death
