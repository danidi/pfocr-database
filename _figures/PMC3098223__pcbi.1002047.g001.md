number: Figure 1
caption: 'The commonly accepted pathway of monolignol biosynthesis, which produces
  p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), 5-hydroxyconiferyl (5H), and syringyl (S) lignin
  monomers, is presented in black, with solid arrows representing metabolic conversions
  and open arrows collectively representing all events during the transport of monolignol
  precursors into the cell wall. Important revisions suggested by the recent identification
  of two CCR isoforms—CCR1 and CCR2—are colored in red and discussed in the text.
  Arrows colored in blue represent additional reactions and transport processes that
  are probably negligible in wild-type plants but found to become significant in some
  transgenic strains. Abbreviations for enzymes: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase;
  C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA reductase;
  CAD, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl
  transferase; C3H, p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase;
  COMT, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase.'
