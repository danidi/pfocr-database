caption: Proposed neuroprotective mechanism by adjudin. Adjudin might inhibit astrocyte
  activation which could form a scar following stroke by increasing Sirt3 and Foxo3a
  expression, and inhibiting Notch1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, Foxo3a and Notch1
  signaling pathways were regulated by adjudin might via Sirt3.
