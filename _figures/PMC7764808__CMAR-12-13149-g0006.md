caption: Schematic representation of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and interaction
  between PTDC-ATO and Pirh2. (A) The human Ub conjugates to target protein by catalyzation
  of ubiquitin-protein ligases, and then subjects to degradation by 26S proteasomes.
  (B) The left, the structure of PDTC-As (III) complex; the right, the secondary sequence
  organization of the CHY-zinc-finger/RING-finger domain of Pirh2 protein; and the
  formula shows a dynamic balance between PDTC-As (III) and finger domain motifs via
  metal ion-exchange.
