caption: 'Panel 1A: This figure demonstrates a highly abstracted schematic of the
  components and interactions of the BNG model. The various states of the molecules
  are not represented, nor the individual binding sites, and the molecular interactions/reactions
  are generally depicted using the following legend:Solid Black Lines: denote molecule-to-molecule
  bindingCircular Nodes at Convergence of Solid Black Lines: denote complexescomposed
  of attached moleculesSolid Blue Arrows: denote activation processesSolid Red Arrows:
  denote inhibitory processesRed “X”s”: denote targets of inhibitionDashed Blue Arrows:
  denote transport or change in location of molecular speciesAlso, there are two points
  where pathways converge/diverge and signals can follow either path. These points
  can be seen as green “Or”s set in diamonds. These are seen at the divergence of
  the TLR-4-dimer binding to either MAL or TRAM, and at the convergence of these two
  pathways as TRAF6 is bound to either of the TRAM-TRIF-RP1 or MAL-MyD88-IRAK1-IRAK4
  complexes. The negative feedback components are A20, acting on TAK1 and Iκκ, and
  IκB, which is constitutively bound to NF-κB.Panel 1B: This figure demonstrates what
  the actual RuleBuilder rules look like for a specific section of the above pathway.
  The region represented is a portion of the TRAM-TRIF-RP1-TRAF6 arm of the signaling
  pathway, specifically the binding of the TRAM-TRIF-RP1-TRAF6 complex to the TLR-4-dimer
  and the activation by this complex of TAK1. Molecular species are represented at
  smoothed rectangles; binding sites are represented as small circles within the molecule.
  Open binding sites are shown as open circles; darkened circles represent occupied
  binding sites. The first row demonstrates the rules for binding of theTRIF-RP1-TRAF6
  complex to the TLR-4-dimer. The second row shows the activation of TAK1 by the TRAM-TRIF-RP1-TRAF6
  complex, this function denoted by the change of the activation site on TAK1 from
  “Activation∼No” to “Activation∼Yes.”'
