caption: The ingenuity pathway analysis ‘role of JAK family kinases in IL-6-type cytokine
  signalling' pathway is shown along with RA drug targets and anti-rheumatic drugs
  approved for use, in clinical trials or discontinued. Six RA drug targets were identified
  that have potential for differential responses between hips and knees, including
  IL-6, JAK1, JAK2, Tyk2, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. Among the assigned RA drugs, tocilizumab
  and tofacitinib (labelled with *) that target IL-6 and JAKs, respectively, are currently
  approved for use in RA in the United States. The network was generated through the
  use of QIAGEN's Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity)
