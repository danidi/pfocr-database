caption: Summary of the CD4+IL-10+IFN-γ+ T cell generation induced by hPMSCs. The
  hPMSCs could induce the generation of the CD4+IL-10+IFN-γ+ T cells in spleen and
  liver and downregulate the serum level of IL-27 in GVHD mice (blue line with arrowhead),
  and the high level of IL-27 in the serum of GVHD mice and the supernatant of activated
  PBMC (bold black line with arrowhead) could regulate the immunomodulatory effects
  of hPMSCs in turn. The expression of PDL2 in hPMSCs could be up regulated by IL-27
  through JAK/STAT pathway (yellow line with arrowhead). Such an effect enhanced the
  ability of hPMSCs to induce the generation of CD4+IL-10+IFN-γ+ T cells from activated
  PBMC (yellow line with arrowhead). The increased trend and the decrease were represented
  with the red and green lines with arrowhead, respectively.
