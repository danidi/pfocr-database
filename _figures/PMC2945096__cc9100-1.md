caption: Overview of glucose metabolism in mammalian cells. Glucose is known to be
  oxidized through cytoplasmic glycolysis to produce pyruvate. Pyruvate may be reduced
  into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase or it may enter the mitochondria to participate
  in the citric acid cycle and the production of ATP by the mitochondrial respiratory
  chain and ATPase. However, glucose can be involved in other pathways. Glycogen synthesis
  is a major way to store glucose in muscle and liver. In the polyol pathway, aldose
  reductase reduces toxic aldehyde to inactive alcohol and glucose to sorbitol and
  fructose. In reducing NADPH to NADP+, this enzyme may be deleterious by consuming
  the essential cofactor needed to regenerate reduced glutathione, an essential antioxidant
  factor in cells. The hexosamine pathway originates from glycolysis at the fructose-6-phosphate
  level. In this pathway, glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase is involved
  in the synthesis of glucosamine-6-phosphate, which is ultimately converted to uridine
  diphosphate (UDP)-N-acetyl-glucosamine. This glucosamine is able to activate transcription
  factors such as Sp-1 and to induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  Diacylglycerol, which activates isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC), may be produced
  from dihydroxyacetone phosphate. The PKC activation can induce several pro-inflammatory
  patterns, such as activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, and the production
  of NADPH oxidase or pro-inflammatory cytokines. The pentose phosphate pathway may
  use glucose-6-phosphate to produce pentoses for nucleic acid production. This pathway
  is also able to produce NADPH for use in lipid, nitric oxide and reduced glutathione
  production, and also the synthesis of reactive oxygen species by NADPH oxidase.
  Advanced glycation end product (AGE) synthesis is linked to high intracellular glucose
  concentrations. AGEs can induce cell dysfunction by modifying cell proteins, and
  extracellular matrix proteins, which changes signalling between the matrix and the
  cell, or by activating receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGEs), which
  induce the production of the transcription factors NF-κB and TNF-α or other pro-inflammatory
  molecules. GLUT, glucose transporter.
