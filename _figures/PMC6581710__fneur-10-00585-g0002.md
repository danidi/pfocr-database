caption: Proposed metabolic and hemodynamic changes induced by caloric restriction
  (CR). CR downregulated glucose metabolic pathway but upregulated ketogenic pathway.
  KBs are converted to acetoacetate (ACA) and then further to acetyl-CoA. The changes
  in metabolic pathway resulted in enhanced TCA cycle flux and glutamate-glutamine
  recycling between neurons and glial cells. Elevated CBF might be due to enhanced
  neuronal activities and increased levels of KBs. βHB, β-hydroxybutyrate; BBB, blood-brain
  barrier; CAT, carnitine acetyltransferase; GLUT-1, Glucose transporter 1; KBs, Ketone
  bodies; MCT1, monocarboxylate transporter 1; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
