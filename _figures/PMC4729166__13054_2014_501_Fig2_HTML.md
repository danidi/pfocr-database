caption: 'Schematic illustration of the molecular processes leading to apoptosis in
  renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. So-called death receptors such as Fas,
  TNF receptor-1 (TNFR-1), or the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors
  bind with extracellular ligands to activate downstream activator caspases []. This
  process is usually mediated by the FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain)
  receptor, and ultimately activates caspase-3 - the effector molecule. Within the
  cell, the intrinsic pathway is initiated via cellular stresses: reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), nitric oxide, decreased ATP, or cell-cell/cell-matrix perturbations
  []. In response to those stresses, BAX migrates into the mitochondria via activation
  from BH3-only proteins within the Bcl-2 family []. Once they have entered the mitochondria,
  BAX and other pro-apoptotic proteins form pores within the mitochondrial wall, allowing
  for the release of cytochrome c, which triggers caspase-dependent and -independent
  pathways [].'
