caption: 'Effect of DMSO or cumulative doses of FMN on the relaxation of rat aortas
  (precontracted by 60 mM KCl), either with or without endothelium (endo) or with
  (l-NAME).Notes: Representative traces show the vasorelaxation produced by FMN in
  KCl-precontracted aortic rings (A). Concentration–relaxation curves of FMN in intact
  or denuded aortic rings (B). Data are expressed as percentage of increasing relaxation
  level, mean ± SEM, n=4. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs control.Abbreviations: DMSO, dimethyl
  sulfoxide; FMN, formononetin; l-NAME, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; SEM, standard
  error of the mean.'
