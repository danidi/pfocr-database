caption: Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) undergoes processing by ubiquitin-like
  protein-specific proteases (Ulps) and sentrin-specific proteases (SENPs) to its
  mature form (step 1), revealing a carboxy-terminal Gly-Gly motif. SUMO is then adenylated
  by the SUMO-activating enzyme subunit 1 (SAE1)-ubiquitin-like activating enzyme
  subunit 2 (UBA2) E1 complex in an ATP·Mg2+-dependent reaction and transferred to
  the catalytic Cys of the UBA2 subunit (step 2). Following activation, SUMO is transferred
  to the catalytic Cys of the E2 conjugating enzyme, ubiquitin-like conjugating enzyme
  9 (UBC9) (step 3). It can then catalyze conjugation to a substrate in an E3 ligase-independent
  manner through recognition of SUMO consensus motifs (ΨKXE) that contain a Lys acceptor
  residue (step 4). In addition, SUMO ligases can facilitate SUMO transfer through
  distinct mechanisms. The E3 ligase may coordinate the E2~SUMO thioester in an optimal
  conformation for catalysis without directly contacting the substrate, as is the
  case for Ran-binding protein 2 (RanBP2) (step 5). The Siz and PIAS (protein inhibitor
  of activated STAT) E3 ligases contact the E2 and SUMO through their SP-RING and
  Siz/PIAS carboxy-terminal domain (SP-CTD) domains, respectively (step 6). In both
  steps 5 and 6, substrate specificity is derived from the E2 enzyme. The Siz/PIAS
  family proteins also contain a PINIT domain that can contact the substrate, as is
  the case for the substrate proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), (step 7).
  Substrate specificity imparted by E3-substrate interactions are thought to be particularly
  important for directing conjugation to non-consensus Lys residues. Substrates modified
  by SUMO can contact SUMO-binding proteins through their SUMO-interacting motifs
  (SIMs) (step 8). Deconjugation is performed by Ulp and SENP proteases and free SUMO
  may be recycled for another round of conjugation (step 9).
