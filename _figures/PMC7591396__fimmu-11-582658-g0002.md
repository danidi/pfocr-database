caption: Allorecognition pathways in transplantation. DCs instigate allograft immunity
  by presenting donor antigens to alloreactive T cells via direct, indirect, and semidirect
  recognition pathways. In the direct pathway, donor-derived DCs directly present
  intact donor (allogeneic) MHC molecules to alloreactive T cells. In the indirect
  pathway, host-derived DCs present donor-derived antigens, captured from damaged
  graft tissue or dying, donor-derived DCs, to alloreactive T cells. In the semidirect
  pathway, intact donor MHC molecules transferred to host DCs by cell-cell contact
  or extracellular vesicles are recognized. DC, dendritic cell; MHC, major histocompatibility
  complex; TCR, T-cell receptor.
