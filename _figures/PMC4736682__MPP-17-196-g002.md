caption: 'Proposed model for cyclic adenosine monophosphate–protein kinase A (cAMP–PKA)‐mediated
  transcriptional and signalling pathways in Fusarium graminearum based on transcriptomics
  analysis of the Δfac1 and Δcpk1 mutants. Environmental cues and first messengers
  are perceived by G protein‐coupled receptors, and G proteins are activated to generate
  cAMP through adenylate cyclase FAC1. cAMP then binds to the regulatory subunit of
  PKA (PKR: FGSG_09908) and releases catalytic subunits of PKA (CPK1, CPK2) that regulate
  downstream cellular functions. cAMP‐dependent processes can be FAC1 dependent (FAC1‐unique
  and FAC1–CPK1) or independent (CPK1‐unique), regulating a variety of functions (blue
  boxes) that are both basic housekeeping and specialized. All genes downstream of
  and including FAC1 and CPK1 in this network are differentially expressed in the
  Δfac1 and Δcpk1 mutants based on microarray analysis. The correlation of phenotypes
  and key regulators (protein kinases and transcription factors) is primarily based
  on F. graminearum phenome data described in FgTFPD (Son et al., ), previous kinome
  phenotype data (Wang et al., ) and the Pathogen–Host Interaction (PHI) Database
  (Winnenburg et al., ). Cellular function association is based on functional enrichment
  of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the Δfac1 and Δcpk1 mutants (Table S2)
  using FunCat (Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences, MIPS). The F.  graminearum
  gene annotation is derived from the F. graminearum genome annotation database (MIPS)
  and yeast homology information (Saccharomyces Genome Database). DON, deoxynivalenol;
  ZEA, zearalenone.'
