caption: Figure 1. Gal-3 is an important regulator of adiposity, metaflammation, and
  type 2 diabetes. Fat-enriched diets increase plasma concentration of endotoxin (metabolic
  endotoxemia) and saturated fatty acids such as palmitate, that stress macrophages
  in metabolic tissues including adipose tissue and pancreatic islets leading to increased
  production of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and chemokines which further
  attract immune cells into tissues and promote systemic inflammation. Gal-3 binds
  endotoxin and acts as a scavenger molecule for advanced glycation and lipoxidation
  end products. TLR4, the receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), mediates the innate
  immune response to bacterial pathogens, but also triggers inflammatory processes
  upon exposure to certain dietary fats by activating NFκB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome
  in macrophages leading to IL-1β secretion that causes insulin resistance. Ablation
  of Gal-3 leads to accelerated obesity and systemic inflammation, enhanced inflammation
  in adipose tissue and pancreatic islets, as indicated by increased type-1 T and
  NKT cells and pro-inflammatory macrophages in visceral adipose tissue and NLRP3
  inflammasome and IL-1β expressing macrophages in islets in high-fat diet-fed mice.
  This is associated with the increased activation of NFκB signaling pathway through
  binding of AGE to upregulated receptor for AGE (RAGE) and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  by LPS and/or palmitate resulting in increased caspase-1-dependent IL-1β production
  and IL-6 by LGALS3−/− macrophages. The increase in circulating IL-1β and the decrease
  of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-13 contribute to the development of insulin resistance
  and type 2 diabetes in Gal-3-deficient mice.
