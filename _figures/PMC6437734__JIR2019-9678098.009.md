caption: VPA induces apoptosis and inhibits IL-4 production in Tγδ lymphocytes. The
  proliferation of Tγδ lymphocytes arising from PBMC cultures, which are stimulated
  with IL-2 and zoledronic acid, is related to the promotion by the latter of the
  inhibition of the mevalonate pathway in monocytes, which upregulates pyrophosphate
  isopentenyl. This molecule is probably identified by the TCR of lymphocytes, but
  this has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, IL-2 sends proliferation and survival
  signals to these cells. However, VPA inhibits those mechanisms by promoting an increase
  in the intracellular molecules IL-4δ13 and IL-4Rα, which have a direct effect on
  the induction of apoptosis and on the inhibition of IL-4 by blocking the AP1 signaling
  pathway. One additional VPA-related effect is the increase in H3 acetylation at
  the IL-4 locus, as well as a reduction in both CD95 and NKG2D. Green arrows indicate
  the processes, molecules, or mediators in the signaling pathway that are augmented
  and/or promoted by VPA. Red arrows indicate processes, molecules, or mediators in
  the signaling pathway that are inhibited by VPA. Figure based on [].
