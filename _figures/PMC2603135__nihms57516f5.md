caption: Networks were generated using the Ingenuity tool for both proteomic and microarray
  data from this study. The networks shown were merged from three subnetworks, one
  containing RRM2 and HDAC1, one with p53, and the third with BRCA1. The protein or
  gene nodes encircled with orange line are those differentially expressed from this
  study. The lines (edges) connecting nodes are associations for proteins or genes
  based on the Ingenuity knowledgebase, which encompasses interaction, binding, activation,
  inhibition, etc. Gray lines are protein/gene associations within the initial subnetworks,
  while orange lines depict relations to linking the subnetworks. Solid lines are
  for direct and broken ones for indirect associations.
