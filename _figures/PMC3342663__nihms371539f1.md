caption: A diagram of tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent methionine transmethylation
  and transsulfuration for glutathione synthesis. The methionine cycle (transmethylation)
  involves the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine via the B12-dependent
  transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-CH3THF) via the methionine
  synthase (MS) reaction. Methionine is then activated to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM),
  the methyl donor for multiple cellular methyltransferase (MTase) reactions for the
  methylation of essential molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, phospholipids, creatine,
  and neurotransmitters. The transfer of the methyl group from SAM results in the
  demethylated product S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). The reversible hydrolysis of
  SAH to homocysteine and adenosine by the SAH hydrolase (SAHH) reaction completes
  the methionine cycle. Homocysteine can then be either remethylated to methionine
  or irreversibly removed from the methionine cycle by cystathionine beta synthase
  (CBS). This is a one-way reaction that permanently removes homocysteine from the
  methionine cycle and initiates the transsulfuration pathway for the synthesis of
  cysteine and glutathione. Glutathione is shown in its active reduced form (GSH)
  and inactive oxidized disulfide form (GSSG). Vital cell functions dependent on these
  inter-dependent pathways include proliferation (e.g., immune function, DNA synthesis
  and repair), methylation (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, phospholipids, neurotranmitters
  and creatine) and redox homeostasis (e.g., cell signaling, detoxification, stress
  response, cell cycle progression and apoptosis)
