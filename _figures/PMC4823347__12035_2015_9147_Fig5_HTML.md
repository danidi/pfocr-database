caption: Molecular signaling partners of ROCK1. This map illustrates the Rho kinase
  signaling pathway. ROCK1 is the key effector and its downstream targets are all
  important regulators of a variety of cellular functions which control cell morphology,
  cell migration, cytoskeletal reorganization, cell differentiation, and cell death.
  Each of these gene targets are altered in HD
