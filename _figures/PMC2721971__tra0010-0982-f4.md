caption: 'Formation and function of invadopodia consist of several steps, I–V, as
  depicted in this figure. I: Arf6 is activated by GEP100, bound to the ligand-activated
  EGFR, and resides at or near the plasma membrane (PM). II: GTP-Arf6 then recruits
  its effector AMAP1, which is associated with several different proteins including
  cortactin, paxillin, and perhaps also amphiphysin II (Amp II). AMAP1 is also indirectly
  associated with certain types of integrins, and acts to recruit them to the plasma
  membrane. III: AMAP1, as well as its accessary proteins, then remodel plasma membrane
  and cytoskeletal architecture to form membrane protrusions, which contain integrins.
  IV: Inactivation of Arf6 is thought to precede the onset of the phagocytosis at
  invadopodia, although this is not yet completely proofed. An ArfGAP responsible
  for the Arf6 inactivation in invadopodia is not identified. At around the same time,
  dynamin should be recruited to invadopodia, a recruitment that is presumably mediated
  by amphyphisin or some equivalent molecules. For the recruitment of dynamin by amphyphisin,
  amphyphisin needs to release the prebound AMAP1. V: Invadopodia are sites of the
  phagocytosis of degraded extracellular matrices, which bind to integrins. The Bar
  domain of AMAP1 is thought to play a crucial role for invagination of the plasma
  membrane. Dynamin is also an integral component for phagocytosis, which mediates
  the fission reaction of the endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane. A cue to
  start phagocytosis is not yet clarified. Ubiquitination of AMAP1 by Cbl is not described
  in this figure, for simplification.'
