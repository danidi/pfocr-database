caption: Innate immune responses in allotransplantation. Soon after solid organ transplantation,
  Ag-independent insults to the allograft caused by organ procurement and ischemia/reperfusion
  injury promote immunogenicity via danger signals that lead to the activation of
  donor-derived APCs. The direct pathway of allorecognition is depicted in which “passenger”
  DCs undergo functional maturation in response to danger-associated molecules and
  then traffic to the T cell areas in recipient lymphoid tissue. Thus, naive alloreactive
  T cells become stimulated, transition to effectors, and engage the graft directly.
  Other cells of the innate immune system, such as neutrophils, macrophages, and NK
  cells, rapidly infiltrate the allograft in response to inflammatory signals and
  promote further injury either by their own proinflammatory mechanisms or by supporting
  the activity of alloreactive T cells.
