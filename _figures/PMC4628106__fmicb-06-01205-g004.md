caption: Predicted geochemical cycling in the FRC subsurface based on metabolic profiles
  of pristine (FW301, left) and contaminated (FW106, right). The denitrification pathway
  genes are labeled in bold in the FW106 figure to indicate their overabundance in
  this metagenome compared to FW301. Dotted lines indicate either that the pathway
  genes were not detected in the metagenomes, detected in very low abundance, or that
  bacteria known to implement these pathways were not detected or in extremely low
  abundance (<1%). Contaminants present in high concentrations at the FW106 site are
  shown in white boxes. Partitions indicate different geochemical and electrochemical
  environments that may transiently exist at the OR-IFRC sites and do not necessarily
  represent the specific environmental partitioning present in these environments.
