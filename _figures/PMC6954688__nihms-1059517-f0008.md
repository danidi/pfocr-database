caption: DCM is a form of pathological cardiac remodeling that is associated with
  severe energy depletion leading to HF. The energy stress sensor AMP-kinase is an
  adaptive signaling pathway aiming to preserve energy in the cells. The NAMPT enzyme
  is a major, rate-limiting step for NAD+synthesis whose energetic cost equals four
  ATP molecules, including one converted to AMP, for the synthesis of one NAD+. NAMPT
  is repressed in most forms of HF through unknown regulatory mechanism. Opposite
  to this repression, Nmrk2 gene is an AMPK responsive gene that is activated in several
  models of DCM and other forms of pathological remodeling such as the pressure-overload
  cardiac hypertrophy. NMR-Kinase 2 allows the synthesis of NAD+ at a lower cost of
  2 ATP per molecule. Although NR content may be limited in rodent and human diet,
  NR can easily be provided as a nutraceutical to help the failing heart to maintain
  NAD+ levels.
