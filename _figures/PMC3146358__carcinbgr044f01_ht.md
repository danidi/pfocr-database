caption: Metabolism of AA by the 5-LO pathway. AA is initially converted by 5-LO in
  the presence of FLAP to 5-HpETE, which is either further converted to LTA4 by 5-LO
  or lost from the enzyme and converted to 5-HETE by glutathione peroxidase (GPx).
  LTA4 is the precursor for LTs (LTB4 and the cysteinyl LTs LTC4 and LTD4). 5-HETE
  is metabolized to 5-oxo-ETE by 5-HEDH in the presence of NADP+, the concentration
  of which is regulated by oxidative stress induced GSSG formation. The reduction
  of GSSG back to GSH by glutathione reductase (GRed) generates NADP+.
