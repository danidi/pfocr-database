caption: 'β-catenin: immune exclusion mediated by activation of the WNT–β-catenin
  pathway occurs when expression of CC-chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) is inhibited and
  thus basic leucine zipper transcriptional factor ATF-like 3 lineage dendritic cells
  (BATF3 DCs) are no longer recruited into the tumour microenvironment. Consequently,
  owing to a lack of CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) production by BATF3 DCs, no
  T cell priming occurs, and effector T cells are not recruited into the tumour. MYC:
  activation of MYC signalling enhances the expression of leukocyte surface antigen
  CD47 and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) on tumour cells through transcriptional
  regulation. Expression of these immune inhibitory molecules interferes with antigen
  uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) via engagement with signal regulator protein-α
  (SIRPα) and inhibits T cell function via PD1 engagement, respectively. LKB1: loss
  of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) signalling within tumour cells results in increased expression
  of various cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-33 and CXCL7. IL-6 mediates
  recruitment of neutrophils into the tumour microenvironment, an immunosuppressive
  cell type that contributes to reduced T cell infiltration and promotes T cell dysfunction.
  LKB1 mutations can also lead to activation of MYC signalling within the same tumour
  cells, providing potential crosstalk between pathways. PTEN: loss of PTEN protein
  function and thereby activation of PI3K inhibits lipidation of the autophagosome
  protein LC3 and autophagy in tumour cells, a process that can diminish T cell priming
  and also mediate resistance to T cell-mediated apoptosis. TP53: effector T cell
  exclusion from the tumour can occur owing to inactivating TP53 mutations, which
  results in reduced chemokine production by tumour cells. In particular, TP53-mutated
  tumour cells lack production of key chemokines required for the recruitment of natural
  killer (NK) cells and T cells, which is required for NK cell recruitment into the
  tumour microenvironment.'
