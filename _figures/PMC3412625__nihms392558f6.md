caption: Stroke induces the activation of vascular TLR signal, which leads to upregulation
  of proinflammatory genes via the activation of NF-κB. VELCADE inactivates NF-kB
  through either directly blocking stroke-activated TLR2 and TLR4 or indirectly repressing
  IRAK1 by VELCADE upregulated miR-146a, which consequently downregulates proinflammatory
  gene expression. Thus, VELCADE acts on a multi-level inhibition of TLR signaling
  in ischemic cerebral vessels.
