caption: Signal transduction mechanisms underlying muscarinic contraction of mouse
  intestinal smooth muscle. The M3pathway activates multiple intracellular Ca2+ mobilisation
  events, including Ca2+ influx via VDCCs and voltage-independent Ca2+-permeable channels
  and intracellular Ca2+ release. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx is initiated by depolarisation
  from opening of TRPC4 and TRPC6 cationic channels, opening of Ca2+-activated Cl−
  channels and inhibition of KATP channels, while voltage-independent Ca2+ entry is
  mediated by opening of TRPC6 cationic channels and Ca2+ store-operated Ca2+ channels.
  In addition to Ca2+ mobilisation, Ca2+ sensitisation of contractile proteins is
  elicited, thereby increasing the efficiency of contraction–[Ca2+]i coupling. The
  M2 or M2/M3 pathways induce contraction through a simple Ca2+ mobilisation mechanism
  in which Ca2+ entry via VDCCs is activated by TRPC4 channel-induced depolarisation.
  These pathways play a major role in mediating muscarinic contraction, with the M2/M3pathway
  making a relatively greater contribution at low agonist concentrations. The M2pathway
  also induces contraction indirectly by inhibiting cAMP-dependent relaxation in response
  to adenylyl cyclase-activating agonists.
