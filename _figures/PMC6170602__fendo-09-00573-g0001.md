caption: Pro-apoptotic signaling pathway induced by orexins. Interaction of orexins
  with OX1R or OX2R leads to promote the dissociation of heterotrimer Gq into αq and
  β/γ subunits. The canonical Ca2+signaling pathway stimulated by orexins results
  of phospholipase C (PLC) activation mediated by αq subunit (Left). Apoptosis induced
  by orexins is mediated, independently of canonical Ca2+signaling pathway, by the
  recruitment of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP2 leading to the activation of
  p38 cascade and activation of caspases-3 and -7 via the mitochondria apoptosis pathway
  (Right). All structures were obtained in Protein Data Bank (PDB).
