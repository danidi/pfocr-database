caption: Model of PRRSV-mediated manipulation of the AMPK–ACC1 pathway. Acetyl-CoA
  is metabolized to malonyl-CoA via ACC1, which is then transformed into palmitates
  by FA synthase (FASN). Palmitates are prolonged through FA elongase to form saturated
  FAs, which are subsequently metabolized to unsaturated FAs by desaturase. PRRSV
  infection activated AMPK, thus resulting in an increased level of phosphorylated
  ACC1 (inactive form) to block FA synthesis. Pharmacological agents targeting various
  steps of FA synthesis pathway, such as C75 (inhibitor of FASN), CP-640186 (inhibitor
  of ACC1), and A769662 (activator of AMPK), suppressed FA biosynthesis and subsequently
  inhibited the replication of PRRSV. In summary, host cells limit PRRSV infection
  via the AMPK–ACC1 pathway.
