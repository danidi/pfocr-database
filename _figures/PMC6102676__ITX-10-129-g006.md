caption: 'Mechanistic insight of OLE and RUT in preventing 6-OHDA-induced ER-stress
  in PC12 cells. 6-OHDA induces both mitochondrial dysfunction and ER-stress, leading
  to over-production of ROS and unfolded protein response (UPR). OLE and RUT attenuate
  6-OHDA induced adaptive response to survival via directly regulating mitochondrial
  functions, promoting IRE1α signaling pathway (ATF-4), reducing ER protein overload
  (via PERK, BIP, PDI downregulation); rather than apoptosis (CHOP, ROS overproduction).
  OLE and RUT can also enhance stress related pathways under serum deprivation concomitantly
  with 6-OHDA exposure, however cell viability and healthy-apoptotic cells ratio remain
  elevated. Red arrows: 8 h 100 μM 6-OHDA alone treatment; green arrows: 6 h OLE or
  RUT pre-treatment, followed by 8 h 100 μM 6-OHDA treatment. 6-OHDA: 6-hydroxydopamine;
  OLE: Oleuropein; RUT: Rutin; UPR: Unfolded protein response; PERK: Protein kinase
  R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; IRE1α: Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α;
