caption: 'Overall pathway for astaxanthin biosynthesis in Haematococcus pluvialis
  (Cunningham and Gantt ; Fan et al. ; Fraser et al. ) and possible role of PTOX in
  response of Haematococcus pluvialis to oxidative stress. Enzymes are indicated by
  their gene assignment symbols: IPI isopentenyl-diphosphate δ-isomerase, PSY phytoene
  systhase, PDS phytoene desaturase, ZDS ζ-carotene desaturase, LYC lycopene cyclase,
  CrtO β-carotene ketolase, CrtR-b β-carotene 3,3′-hydroxylase, PTOX plastid terminal
  oxidase. The genes encoding boxed enzymes were studied in this work, and the dashed
  lines represent proposed chlororespiratory reactions'
