caption: Methotrexate (MTX) transporters, metabolic pathways and intracellular enzyme
  targets. MTX transport across biological membranes is mediated by the reduced folate
  carrier (RFC1), the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) (mainly expressed in
  the proximal part of the small intestine at the apical membrane of enterocytes)
  with limited contribution of folate receptors (FR). MTX is exported from the cell
  by the ATP-binding cassette (ABCC)-family transporters. Within the cell, MTX is
  converted to polyglutamate forms in a reversible reaction mediated by folylpolyglutamate
  synthetase (FPGS) and γ-glutamyl hydrolase (GGH). Polyglutamation reduces MTX efflux
  from the cell via ABCC transporters and therefore increases intracellular half-life
  of MTX. Intracellular formation of MTX polyglutamate also plays a critical role
  in MTX activity, increasing inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and several
  folate dependent enzymes such as thymidylate synthase (TYMS), 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxide
  ribonucleotide (AICAR) transformylase (ATIC), and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase
  (MTHFR) decreasing downstream folate pathway intermediates required for nucleotide
  synthesis. DHF, dihydrofolate; THF, tetrahydrofolate; FAICAR, formyl AICAR; MS,
  methionine synthetase; dTMP, deoxythymidine monophosphate.
