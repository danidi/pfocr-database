caption: Wiring of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), which balances
  cytokine production. Pathogens as well as ischemia and other forms of injury activate
  cytokine production, which normally restores health. If the cytokine response is
  excessive, however, then these same mediators can cause disease. Efferent signals
  from the vagus nerve inhibit cytokine production via pathways dependent on the α7
  subunit of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) on macrophages and other cells. Efferent
  vagus nerve activity also increases instantaneous heart rate variability (HRV).
  A cholinergic brain network that is responsive to M1 agonists can increase the activity
  of CAP and also increase instantaneous HRV. Afferent signals carried in the vagus
  nerve can activate an efferent response that inhibits cytokine release, termed the
  inflammatory reflex (With permission from American Society for Clinical Investigation)
  (Tracey, ).
