caption: A model of warts formation on apple shoots induced by B. dothidea invasion.
  Upon invading apple shoot, B. dothidea released cutinase Bdo_10846 to digest cutin
  and suberin in epidermal and phellem cells. Unknown monomers released from hydrolyzing
  the cutin and suberin were recognized by a receptor and triggered the defense response
  through the (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, inducing the subsequent
  upregulation of pathogenesis-related (PR) gene and suberification-related (SR) genes.
  As a result, the phellogen formed phelloderm outward and phelloderm inward around
  the infection site to resist the invading of the pathogen, and suberification was
  generated in the phelloderm cells surrounding the invading hypha.
