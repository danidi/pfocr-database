caption: Role of oxidative stress in cartilage damage during OA. OA is hypothesised
  as a chronic inflammation disease that occurs with gradual changes in the immune
  system (see Pathophysiology of knee OA). IL-1β and TNF-α and other inflammatory
  factors increase in OA. This pathway leads to induction of NO synthase, production
  of larger amounts of NO and a deficiency in SOD and catalase (see Role of ROS in
  OA). The deficiency in SOD leads to higher levels of superoxide which combines with
  NO to produce peroxynitrite which can cause telomere erosion by targeting guanine
  repeats in their DNA telomeres. The net result is a decrease in the synthesis of
  collagen II. The decrease in catalase results in accumulation of peroxide to increase
  lipid peroxidation which produces 4-hydroxynonenal. The 4-hydroxynonenal increases
  factors which breakdown collagen II and also inhibits the expression of collagen
  II. The net result is the cartilage damage that occurs in OA. Note that the scheme
  shown here is only a summary
