caption: Interaction networks of As sensitivity in yeast. (A) Requirement of genes
  from the sulfur metabolic pathway for growth in the presence of MMAIII. The transcription
  factor genes MET28 and MET32, and several of their target genes involved in sulfur
  uptake and methionine metabolism are essential for growth after 15g of exposure
  to 150μM (IC20) of MMAIII. The node size is directly proportional to its connectivity
  to other genes in the network, which were omitted for clarity purposes. Only the
  interactions between MET32 and MET28 with target genes are shown. From the genes
  shown, YCR087W, CSM1, MAL33, MET32, and STP1 were also essential in AsIII. (B) Network
  of As-responsive genes involved in DNA DSB repair. Genes identified as essential
  in at least one of the arsenical treatments are shown in green nodes. The homologous
  genes in humans (if any) are shown in red font next to the yeast gene. MRX interacts
  with the Atm-homolog Tel1p via Xrs2p, an interaction that is conserved in humans
  and is supportive of its important role in DNA repair.
