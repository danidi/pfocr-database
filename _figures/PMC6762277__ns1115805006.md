caption: Models of NMDA-dependent memory formation.A, In the accepted model, an event
  is accompanied by the release of glutamate-activating NMDA receptors. The resulting
  influx of calcium leads to early plasticity (EPNMDA) supporting short-term memory
  (STM). Subsequent activation of kinases and protein synthesis (K, PS) in the cell
  leads to NMDA-dependent late plasticity (LPNMDA) that supports long-term memory
  (LTM). B, CPP blocks the EPNMDApathway (dotted line), but STM is still observed,
  suggesting the presence of an NMDA-independent early plasticity (EPX) that exists
  in parallel with the NMDA pathway. Consequently, testing at 24 hr reveals no LTM.
  Although consistent with experiment 1, this model is not consistent with experiment
  2, which showed preserved LTM at 48 hr.C, To account for the preserved LTM at 48
  hr (experiment 2), which was blocked by CPP injected on the rest day (experiment
  4), we suggest that NMDA-independent early plasticity (EPX) is followed by prolonged
  activity in a glutamatergic circuit. On day 2, CPP has worn off, and NMDA receptors
  are again available for EPNMDA and LPNMDA processes that support long-term extinction
  memory from day 3 onward. Thus, under these circumstances, NMDA receptors can be
  activated after learning to consolidate extinction memory.
