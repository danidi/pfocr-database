caption: TLRs-signaling in microglial cells in different neurodegenerative disease
  progression. Abnormal amyloid deposition in different neurodegenerative diseases
  may activate microglial cells through TLRs. Microglial activation may lead to further
  neuronal damage through secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (red), such as IL-6
  and TNF-α, or neuroprotection by secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (green),
  such as IL-10, which may prevent further neuronal death. Furthermore, recent reports
  suggest TLRs 2, 4, and 9 signaling may modulate the phagocytosis (blue) and clear
  the neurotoxic amyloid deposition (). Aβ stimulation, mononuclear cells of normal
  subjects up-regulate the transcription of β-1,4-mannosyl-glycoprotein 4-β-Nacetylglucosaminyltransferase
  (MGAT3).
