caption: Key pathways of carbon utilization in L. mexicana promastigotes (A) and amastigotes
  (B) are represented. Major carbon sources (blue box) and overflow metabolites (open
  box) detected in this study are shown. Fluxes through dotted pathways are down-regulated
  relative to the other stage. Steps inhibited by NaFAc and MSO are indicated. Abbreviations
