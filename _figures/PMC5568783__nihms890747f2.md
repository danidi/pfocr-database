caption: PERK arm of the unfolded protein response. PERK is an endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) transmembrane protein that contains a single cytosolic kinase. When its luminal
  domains are dimerized in the presence of misfolded proteins, PERK phosphorylates
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). Phosphorylation inhibits eIF2α
  activity and hence slows down global protein translation, giving the cell extra
  time to attempt to fold the backlog of proteins already present in the ER lumen.
  In contrast, translation of the transcription factor ATF4 (activating transcription
  factor 4) is selectively upregulated when the amount of active eIF2α is limiting.
  ATF4 expression transcriptionally upregulates CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein; also
  known as GADD153), which tips the ER toward homeostasis through induction of a number
  of corrective genes, including XBP1 and chaperones. Although a temporary pause in
  protein translation due to eIF2α phosphorylation can be beneficial for cells under
  ER stress, a protracted block in translation from sustained PERK signaling is incompatible
  with survival. Moreover, high levels of CHOP/GADD153 transcription factor can inhibit
  the expression of antiapoptotic BCL-2 to hasten cell death and upregulate proapoptotic
  BIM to trigger activation of the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathway. Modified
