caption: The Potential Role of Microbial Exposures and the Trained Immune Phenotype
  in Skewing the Th2 Phenotype(A) As shown by the proinflammatory response to LPS
  in allergic cells that have not had sufficient microbial exposures, causing epigenetic
  and metabolic rewiring of naive CD4 T cells, leading to improper development of
  the Th1 pathway and bias toward the Th2 phenotype. (B) The possible preventative
  role of BCG and microbial exposures in allergy, by inducing production of anti-inflammatory
  cytokines to ensure appropriate development of Th1/Th2 balance.
