caption: 'The classical cAMP-signaling pathway, prevalent in dimorphic fungi, consists
  of a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), which is associated with a trimeric complex
  of the Gα, Gβ and Gγ proteins. (A) The GPCR responds to extracellular stimuli activating
  Gα, which exchanges GDP for GTP, and dissociates from the receptor and GβGγ complex.
  (B) The Gα-protein interacts with, and activates, adenylate cyclase (AC), which
  produces the signalling molecule cAMP. The Gβ protein can also interact with AC.
  Since the expression of Gβ is up-regulated during the morphological transition to
  the yeast form [], this excess of free Gβ could act to curtail the signalling process.
  cAMP binds to Protein Kinase A (PKA), which is composed of two regulatory subunits
  (Bcy1) and two catalytic subunits (Tpk2). cAMP binds to the Bcy1 subunits inducing
  their release from the Tpk2 subunits. (C) Our data indicates that the WD/β-propeller
  proteins Gβ and TupA bind to Tpk2: Gβ binds to the C-terminal, catalytic domain,
  of Tpk2, whilst TupA, a transcriptional co-regulator, binds to the N-terminal domain
  of Tpk2. (D) Tpk2 is targeted to the nucleus, where it can interact with and phosphorylate
  transcription factors (TF) that form a transcriptional complex with RNA polymerase
  (RNAP) (lefthand figure). This complex is responsible for the expression of genes
  necessary for the morphological change (e.g. filamentous growth). TupA is also targeted
  to the nucleus, but may do so in complex with Tpk2, where it interacts with its
  target transcription factors (righthand figure). By binding to Tpk2, TupA may define
  those TFs to be phosphorylated and/or facilitate their phosphorylation; and/or facilitate
  specific interactions with the target DNA or transcription complex. Whatever the
  mechanism, the effect of TupA is to act as a strong inducer of the morphological
  change (e.g. hyperfilamentous growth). (E) The interaction of Gβ with Tpk2 facilitates
  its trafficking to the nucleus and, presumably via binding to the catalytic C-terminal
  domain, can suppress its kinase activity and the resulting filamentous gowth (lefthand
  figure). Although our data indicates that Gβ inhibits the kinase activity of Tpk2,
  the possibility that it alters the specificity of Tpk2 for target transcription
  factors cannot be excluded. We hypothesis that the TupA/Tpk2/TF complex is regulated
  by binding of Gβ, which inhibits the kinase activity of Tpk2 and/or alters its specificity
  (righthand figure). Whilst the binding of TupA and Gβ to Tpk2 could be mutually
  exclusive, which would provide a mechanism for the inhibitory action of Gβ, it seems
  likely that the complex is held together via multiple interactions (e.g. with TupA
  binding to both Tpk2 and a common TF) and that Gβ inhibits or alters the specificity
  for gene expression of the transcriptional complex. The phosphorylation of the TF
  is shown to occur before the interaction with the RNAP on the DNA for clarity, but
  phosphorylation could occur after the interaction.'
