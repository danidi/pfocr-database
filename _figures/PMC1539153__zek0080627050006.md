caption: Model for control of carbon source-dependent growth and development by GPR-4
  and heterotrimeric G proteins in N. crassa. During growth on poor carbon sources
  such as glycerol, ligand binding to GPR-4 activates a GNA-1 signaling pathway to
  modulate growth (mass accumulation), conidiation, and aerial hypha formation. A
  likely effector is adenylyl cyclase, but other downstream targets may also be regulated
  by the GPR-4/GNA-1 pathway. GNA-2 and GNA-3 also regulate mass accumulation on glycerol
  medium, through a GPR-4-independent mechanism. The ligands that bind to GPR-4 are
  currently unknown but may include sugars or other cellular metabolites.
