caption: 'Schematic illustration explaining the possible targeting and signalling
  mechanisms by which Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPs) restore the impairment
  of cardiac contractility induced by miR‐1 overexpression. LBPs restored the reductions
  of CaM and cMLCK, target proteins affected by miR‐1, and their corresponding downstream
  proteins for myocardial contraction including CaMKII, cMyBP‐C and MLC2v. LBPs might
  perform cardioprotective effects by affecting key contractile proteins directly
  or other signalling pathway. CaM: calmodulin; cMLCK, cardiac specific myosin light
  chain kinase; CaMKII, calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase II; cMyBP‐C, myosin binding
  protein‐C; MLC2v, myosin regulatory light chain 2'
