caption: Possible signaling pathways by which CHK1 inhibitors activate ERK, and mechanisms
  by which MEK1/2 and SRC inhibitors potentiate CHK1 inhibitor lethality. CHK1 inhibitors
  through mechanisms not fully understood causes activation of the ERK1/2 pathway
  downstream of RAS. SRC kinases can increase ERK1/2 activity both by promoting RAS
  activation and also downstream of RAS at the level of RAF-1 tyrosine phosphorylation.
  Inhibition of either MEK1/2 disrupts this activation of ERK1/2 leading to tumor
  cell death.
