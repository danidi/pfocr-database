caption: Development of colorectal cancer is driven by genetic alterations in the
  APC/β-catenin pathway, leading to aberrant Wnt signaling and formation of hyperplastic
  cryptic foci and early adenomas. Accumulation of genetic alterations in oncogenes
  such as KRAS/BRAF and tumor suppressors such as TP53 results in formation of late
  adenomas and carcinomas. Emerging tumor cells generate mutated neoantigens or tumor
  associated antigens (TAAs) that can trigger antitumor immune response initiated
  by dendritic cells (DCs) and mediated by CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, and other immune
  cells as indicated. This process selects for tumor cell variants that are capable
  of enduring the attack by the immune system, and also creates an immunosuppressive
  microenvironment due to activation of the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA4 pathways, as well
  as immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid-derived
  suppressor cells (MDSCs). During this process, antitumor immune response and immunosuppression
  reach equilibrium, and eventually allow tumor cells to escape from immunosurveillance.
  Both chemoprevention and immunoprevention modulate antitumor immune response and
  restore immunosurveillance through various effects on immune cells and effector
  molecules and pathways
