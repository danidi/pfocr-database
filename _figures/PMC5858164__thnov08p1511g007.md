caption: Working model of endothelial specific elevated miRNA302-367 attenuating embryonic
  hindbrain developmental angiogenesis by targeting CDC42 and CCND1 multiple pathways.
  1) Elevated expression of miR302-367 in endothelial cells inhibits cell proliferation
  through repression of CCND1 via the CCND1-CDK4/6-RB-E2F1 pathway; 2) Elevated expression
  of miR302-367 in endothelial cells reduces cell motility through repression of CDC42
  and its effectors WASP and PAK1 activation, and moreover, PAK1 activation can be
  fine-tuned by KLF2 and the adaptor protein GRB2, which futher regulates LIM-kinase
  and Cofilin for F-actin formation and filament growth, and finally influences cell
  migration.
