caption: Cardiac metabolic alterations in heart failure. In heart failure, increased
  uptake of free fatty acids and glucose into the cytosol is uncoupled from mitochondrial
  uptake and oxidation of free fatty acid and pyruvate, respectively. This provokes
  accumulation of metabolic intermediates in the cytosol which can trigger lipo- and
  glucotoxicity. Instead, utilization of ketone bodies is increased in heart failure.
  Impaired overall substrate oxidation reduces Krebs cycle (TCA) activity, oxidizing
  electron donors NADH and FADH2 for the electron transport chain (ETC). This reduces
  metabolic flux through creatine kinase (CK), thereby the phosphocreatine (PCr) to
  ATP ratio. β-Ox., β-oxidation; CPT-1/2, carnitine palmitoyltransferase type 1/2;
  FA-CoA, fatty acyl-coenzyme A; FACS, fatty acyl-coenzyme A synthetase; FAT/CD36,
  fatty acid translocase; GLUT 1/4, glucose transporters 1/4; G6P, glucose-6-phosphate;
  PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; Polyol P.,
  Polyol pathway; TAG, triacylglycerol; UDPGlcNac, UDP-glycnacylation. Red arrows
