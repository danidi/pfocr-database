caption: Schematic presentations of reaction pathways and energetic events included
  in the cross-bridge cycle. The cross-bridge cycle includes two reaction pathways.
  Reaction pathway 1 occurs under hydrophobic conditions and reaction pathway 2 occurs
  under hydrophilic conditions. ‘Gross work on actin molecule’ includes the energy
  necessary for the generation of M*after and enthalpy production. Pathways 1 and
  3 show a schematic illustration of energy balance in the cross-bridge cycle. Pathway
  1 includes the generation process of M*after from M*before and the process of enthalpy
  production. The potential of the reaction product of two pathways at the goal is
  the same; therefore, the potential difference generated by pathway 2 covers gross
  work production on the actin molecule in addition to the energy required for the
  generation of M*after (see text for details).
