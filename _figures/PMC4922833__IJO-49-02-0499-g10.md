caption: 'Mechanism underlying promotion of RANKL expression in KCOT stromal fibroblasts.
  It was demonstrated that TGF-β and IL-1α possess the latent capacity to directly
  promote osteoclast formation from osteoclast precursors and may be involved in jawbone
  resorption by inducing RANKL expression in stromal fibroblasts and promoting osteoclast
  formation. It was thus demonstrated that induction of RANKL expression in stromal
  fibroblasts occurs by two pathways: a TGF-β pathway, which is not mediated by COX-2-PGE2
  synthesis, and an IL-1α pathway. It was also demonstrated that TGF-β signals synergistically
  promote IL-1α signal-induced COX-2-PGE2 synthesis, thus promoting RANKL expression.'
