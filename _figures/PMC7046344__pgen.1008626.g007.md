caption: We proposed Rab11 participates in at least two different mechanisms, Spn-F-dependent
  and -independent, in the dendrite pruning of Drosophila C4da neurons. The Spn-F-dependent
  mechanism is likely involved in Ik2/Spn-F signaling, which consists of Ik2 kinase
  activation, Spn-F phosphorylation and dynein-dependent Spn-F dispersion. Ik2/Spn-F
  complexes could promote Rab11 activation through an unknown GEF to promote pruning.
  Rab11 was previously found essential for Neuroglian degradation in dendrite pruning,
  and this could be one of the Spn-F-independent mechanisms of Rab11 to mediate pruning.
  Moreover, we suggested that there could be unidentified downstream targets other
  than Rab11 in Ik2/Spn-F pathway to regulate pruning. EE, early endosomes; RE, recycling
  endosomes; LE, late endosomes; MVB, multivesicular bodies.
