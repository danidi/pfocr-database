caption: The butyrate pathway. Most of the dominant species of human colon microbiota
  produce acetate during the fermentation of carbohydrates. Acetate, propionate, and
  butyrate are the main short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) found in humans. The main
  pathway for acetate formation is the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate leading
  to the synthesis of an ATP molecule. In the human colon, propionate is mainly produced
  by the succinate decarboxylation pathway. Propionate is mainly synthesized by the
  species of the genus Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, and Veillonella. However, the
  synthesis of propionate via lactate (not shown), could also be important, especially
  in the case of diets rich in non-digestible oligosides. Clostridium, Eubacterium,
  Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, and Butyrivibrio have been shown to be capable, in
  vitro, of producing butyrate by the condensation of two molecules of acetyl-CoA
  with synthesis of one molecule of ATP. Acetyl-CoA is also the precursor of the synthesis
  of ethanol, produced in vitro by many species such as those of the genera Bacteroides,
  Lactobacillus, or Bifidobacterium. Faecalibacterium prauznitzii was found able to
  use acetate as a source of butyrate. Butyrate is a major metabolite in colonic lumen
  arising from bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber and has been shown to be a
  critical mediator of the colonic inflammatory response. Butyrate is a source of
  energy and it plays a critical role in homeostasis through its ability to counteract
  inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis. Patients receiving allo-HCT as treatment
  for hematologic malignancies and who have an abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria
  (left) have the highest probability to get reed of carbon-dioxide (GVHD), whereas
  those with low abundance of butyric acid bacteria (right) are more often faced to
  GVHD.
