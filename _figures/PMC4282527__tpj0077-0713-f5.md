caption: Schematic for analytical methods used to delineate between hydroxycinnamates,
  p-coumarate and ferulate, on lignin versus on polysaccharides. (a) The derivatization
  following by reductive cleavage (DFRC) method cleaves lignin ethers while leaving
  the γ-esters intact, releasing quantifiable, lignin-diagnostic acylated units, the
  monolignol dihydro-p-coumarate ester conjugates 8. (b) Mild hydrolysis cleaves arabinose
  units from arabinoxylans and, at least in large part, leaves esters intact, therefore
  releasing 5-O-p-coumaroyl arabinose 10 and 5-O-feruloyl arabinose 11. Free p-coumaric
  and ferulic acids are also released and detected/quantitated; the p-coumarate may
  derive from either its ester on lignin or arabinoxylan, but compounds 10 and 11
  are specifically derived from acylated arabinoxylan.
