caption: Principle of CRISPR gene editing. (A) Single guide RNA (sgRNA) consists of
  20-base sequence (guide sequence) specific to the target DNA 5’ of a nonvariable
  scaffold sequence. sgRNA directs Cas nuclease (here Cas9) to its genomic locus via
  Watson-Crick base-pairing and targeting of Cas9 can be easily changed by altering
  only the 20-nt guide sequence within the sgRNA. The only absolute requirement for
  the Cas nuclease-mediated cleavage is the location of the proto-spacer adjacent
  motif (PAM) sequence at the 3’ end of the DNA target sequence. Cas nucleases differ
  in their PAM requirement (5’-NGG-3’ for spCas9) and cleavage pattern, expanding
  the genomic loci which can be reached and allowing more flexibility for the design
  of target sites. (B) Repair pathways. After Cas nuclease has incorporated a sequence-specific
  double-strand break (DSB) in the genomic DNA, the cell repairs cut DNA strand using
  natural repair pathways. (i) In the absence of a donor template, the cell will repair
  DSB mainly by error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which joins
  the ends of damaged DNA together. This results typically in random insertions and
  deletions (INDELs) at the site of editing and gene knockout. (ii) Alternatively,
  HDR pathway can be activated in dividing cells by providing a separate DNA donor
  template containing sequences homologous to the regions flanking the DSB. HDR requires
  a recombination event between the damaged target and intact donor strands of DNA
  and is thus the more accurate mechanism for DSB repair. HDR can be used for generating
  specific insertions, point mutations, or deletions. DSB, double-strand break; HDR,
  homology-directed repair; INDEL, insertion-deletion; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining.
