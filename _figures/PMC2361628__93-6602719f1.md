caption: 'Notch signal transduction elements: (1) Post-translational modification
  of precursor Notch-protein includes cleavage by a Furin-like convertase and glycosylation
  by members of the Fringe family (Radical (R), Manic (M), Lunatic (L)) in the trans-Golgi.
  (2) Adherence of Notch extracellular domain (ECN) with Notch intracellular domain
  (ICN) results in mature Notch heterodimers that are transferred to the cell membrane.
  Receptor interaction with ligands of the DSL-family (Delta, Serrate, Lag3) on neighbouring
  cells is modulated by Fringe modification of ECN. (3) E3 ubiquitin ligases (Mindbomb
  and Neutralised) control the turnover of DSL-ligands on signalling cells. (4) Ligand
  availability is further regulated by the metalloprotease Kuzbanian, shedding the
  extracellular domain of the transmembrane ligand protein. (5) Successful interaction
  of extracellular ligand regions with EGF-like repeats of ECN lead to (6) successive
  cleavage of Notch transmembrane domain by the disintegrin-metalloprotease tumour
  necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) and the γ-secretase Presenillin. (7)
  ICN is released and translocates to the nucleus where it interacts with CSL1, replacing
  CSL-repressors (CoR) and forming a transcription complex with Mastermind-like factors
  (MAML) and transcriptional coactivators (CoA). (8) This transcriptional complex
  activates downstream target genes, including members of the Hairy enhancer of split
  (HES) family of transcriptional repressors (bHLH). (9) These HES proteins excert
  their function together with the Transducin-like enhancer of split (TSL) family
  of corepressors. Other target genes are tissue specific. (10) The half-life of ICN
  is regulated by E3 ligases of the Sel-10 family before proteasome degradation. (11)
  A CSL-independent Notch pathway involves the interaction of ICN with deltex, a cytosolic
  protein and positive regulator of Notch signalling. Adopted from .'
