caption: Metabolic characterization of the MEP pathway in E. coli expressing isoprene
  synthase and isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase from a plasmid. The intracellular
  metabolite concentrations, secretion rate of metabolites and isoprene production
  rate are plotted against dxs expression. The expression strength of dxs was modulated
  by randomization of its ribosome-binding site. DXP 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate,
  MEP 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate, MEcPP 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclopyrophosphate,
  ME-CDP 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol, MEP-CDP 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  2-phosphate, HMBPP 4-hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate, IPP isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate, DMAPP dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, GAP glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,
