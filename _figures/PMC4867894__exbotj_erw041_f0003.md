caption: (A) Distribution of C4cycle genes between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells.
  Preferential gene expression in the mesophyll and bundle sheath is indicated by
  blue or red color, respectively. AMK, AMP kinase; CA, carbonic anhydrase; DIT1+2,
  dicarboxylate transporter 1+2; MDH, NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase; MEP, mesophyll
  envelope protein; NADP-ME, NADP-dependent malic enzyme; PEPC, phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxylase; PEPC-PK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase protein kinase; PPA3+4, pyrophosphorylase
  3+4; PPDK, pyruvate phosphate dikinase; PPT, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphate translocator;
  PPDK-RP, PPDK regulatory protein; RubisCO, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase;
  TPT, triosephosphate phosphate translocator. (B) RNA in situ hybridization of Sorghum
  bicolor leaves with probes for transcripts related to the C4pathway. Scale bars=50
  µm.
