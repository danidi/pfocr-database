caption: Induction of SOCS expression, and domain structure of SOCS3. (A) SOCS proteins
  (CIS and SOCS1–7) are not constitutively expressed; rather, they are induced by
  cytokines, creating a negative feedback loop to prevent excessive activation of
  cytokine-induced JAK/STAT signaling. (B) SOCS proteins contain an N-terminal variable
  region, a classical SH2 domain, and a C-terminal SOCS box. The SOCS box interacts
  with components of the ubiquitin ligase machinery and mediates proteosomal degradation
  of associated proteins, most commonly, JAKs. SOCS1 and SOCS3 are unique among the
  SOCS proteins as they contain a KIR, which acts as a pseudosubstrate for JAKs, conferring
  inhibition of JAK kinase activity. KIR, kinase-inhibitory region; SOCS, suppressors
  of cytokine signaling.
