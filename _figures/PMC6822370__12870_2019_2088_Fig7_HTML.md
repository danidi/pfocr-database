caption: Possible regulation model of the lncRNA973 responses to salt-stress pathway.
  The lncRNA973 acts as a positive regulator that responses to salt-stress in cotton.
  LncRNA973 may increase the salt tolerance of cotton by inducing the expression of
  transcription factors MYB5, WRKY46, ERF62, NAC29 and other downstream genes SOD,
  CAT, POD, NHX7, P5CS, RBOHB, RBOHD, which are important salt-responsive genes. Arrows
  indicate facilitating expression and dotted line indicates an undetermined regulatory
  relationship
