caption: Modulation of epithelial barrier function by lactobacilli. Several in vitro
  studies have identified signaling pathways that are involved in the interaction
  between lactobacilli and epithelial cells. The MAPKs p38, ERK1/2, and JNK have an
  important function in the dynamic regulation of the cell cytoskeleton, tight junctions
  (TJ), and other effectors of epithelium barrier function, and these MAPKs are often
  influenced by lactobacilli (see, e.g., reference ). Given the critical role of EGF
  signaling in many aspects of gastrointestinal physiology and epithelial repair,
  some beneficial effects of probiotics are also related to interference with this
  signaling (, ). Akt (or protein kinase B) plays a central role in promoting epithelial
  cell survival by lactobacilli by the inactivation of several proapoptotic pathways,
  including caspase 9 and caspase 3, and stimulation of cell proliferation by the
  activation of cell cycle regulators (see, e.g., reference ). Akt is generally activated
  in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-dependent manner by, e.g., EGF receptor
  (EGFr) signaling or TLR signaling. Additionally, inhibition of the activation of
  the NF-κB pathway that plays a key role in inflammatory responses seems to be a
  primary target of lactobacilli by inhibiting the ubiquitination and proteasome degradation
  of IκB and thus preventing the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcription
  factor (see, e.g., reference ). Clearly, a complex network of interacting signaling
  pathways can be influenced by lactobacilli. However, there is a general lack of
  knowledge of the Lactobacillus effector molecules and their corresponding host receptors
  mediating these effects (, , , , , , , , ) (double arrows indicate cross-signaling
  events; dotted lines indicate ligand-receptor interactions that are not yet well
  defined). PKC, protein kinase C.
