caption: PELO/HBS1L detection of PF8503-stalled 80S ribosomes activates a translation
  quality control pathway that includes ASC-1 (ASCC1-3), which recognizes a K63-linked
  polyubiquitin signal on the ribosome. These steps are also triggered by HHT. After
  the 60S subunit is released from the stalled 80S ribosome, RQC may clear the stalled
  peptidyl-tRNA (LTN1/NEMF). In late steps of recycling, PF8503 bound in the exit
  tunnel may interfere with quality control functions of ZNF622 and EIF6.
