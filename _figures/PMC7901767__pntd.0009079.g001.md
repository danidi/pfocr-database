caption: 'Left: The Rag sensing pathway upstream of mTORC1 signaling based on human
  studies. Cytosolic amino acid sensors responding to levels of Leucine, Arginine
  or Methionine are shown on top and inhibit Rag activation repressors or activate
  activators. Multi-protein complexes labeled in bold on segmented circles. Lysosomal
  amino acid sensors (vATP-ase and SLC38A9) and Rag heterodimer anchoring complex
  (Ragulator) shown on the lysosome. The Rag complex integrates signals from nutrient
  sensors in addition to growth factors (FLCN/FNIP1) resulting in modifications to
  its GTP/GDP bound state. Active state RagA-RagC bind Raptor effectively recruiting
  TORC1. Note: The Rag protein dimer are overlapping on the human diagram as they
  perform the same function. This dimer consists either of RagA with RagC or of RagB
  with RagD. Right: Multiple sequence alignment of human, wildtype and cutaneous Leishmania
  RagC proteins with domain structure labeled on the human RagC sequence with GTPase
  domain (blue) and C-terminal Roadblock domain (green). The R231C polymorphism identified
  in the cutaneous isolate is highlighted in red. Sequence identity is marked with
  (*), sequence similarity is marked with (:).'
