caption: Canonical UPR pathway. The UPR is triggered by three ER stress sensors—PERK,
  IRE1α, and ATF6—which are rendered inactive by binding to GRP78 under non-stressed
  conditions. Progressive accumulation of misfolded proteins during ER stress results
  in dissociation of GRP78 from the GRP78-sensor complex, inducing dimerization of
  PERK and IRE1α as well as transport of ATF6 from the ER to the Golgi. IRE1α homodimerization
  and autophosphorylation initiates its kinase and endoribonuclease activities to
  generate an important transcription factor XBP1 s, which enters the nucleus to regulate
  the expression of a wide array of genes involved in ER function. Severe and chronic
  ER stress causes excess activation of the IRE1α kinase and RNase activities, leading
  to regulated IRE1α-dependent decay and phosphorylation of c-Jun terminal kinase
  (JNK). Similarly, PERK homodimerization and autophosphorylation induces phosphorylation
  of the α subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), which blocks formation
  of ribosomal preinitiation complexes and suppresses translation initiation, thereby
  attenuating general mRNA translation. PERK activation paradoxically promotes transcription
  initiation of the gene encoding ATF4 even when eIF2α is substantially phosphorylated,
  leading to upregulation of CHOP Once activated by ER stress, ATF6 moves to the Golgi,
  where it is cleaved by S1P and S2P proteases to generate an active form that mediates
  transcriptional induction of ER-localized molecular chaperones and folding enzymes
