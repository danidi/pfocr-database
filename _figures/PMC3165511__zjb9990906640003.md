caption: (A and B) General scheme of PAH metabolism in M. vanbaaleniiPYR-1. Hexagons,
  circles, and rhombuses indicate starting PAH, intermediates, and ring cleavage metabolites,
  respectively. In RCP, aromatic hydrocarbons are mono-oxygenated with the aid of
  epoxide hydrolase or dioxygenated to dihydrodiols, which are ring cleaved via the
  corresponding catechols. The output of the RCP, ring cleavage compounds (rhombus),
  then go through SCP, which converts them to metabolic intermediates (circle or hexagon),
  which are ready to enter another round of RCP or CAP and produce active biological
  precursors. SCP shows various numbers of steps, from one to more than five, in the
  functional order of (i) the hydroxylation of side chains of the ring cleavage compounds,
  (ii) the oxidation of the hydroxylation-generated aldehyde group to a carboxylic
  acid, and (iii) the decarboxylation of the carboxyl group from the aromatic nucleus.
  The functional linearity for the rearrangement of metabolites to enter another round
  of RCP or CAP results in the relatively low in- and out-degrees of the metabolic
  compounds. Because more benzene rings may still remain, RCP and SCP reiterate until
  the pathways produce an intermediate to enter CAP. The number of repetitions depends
  on the number of benzene rings of the HMW PAHs. Diverse PAHs are transformed into
  the common metabolic intermediate protocatechuate, which then is funneled into CAP.
  The CAP consists of a series of reactions for the conversion of protocatechuate
  to small aliphatic compounds, which can directly enter central metabolism. In M.
  vanbaaleniiPYR-1, the β-ketoadipate pathway functions for the completion of the
  pathway into the TCA cycle intermediates. Please refer to articles by Kim et al.
  () and Kweon et al. () for more information about the genes and enzymes in detail.
