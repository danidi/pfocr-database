caption: VA alters cellular iron ion homeostasis, which is an essential element for
  the maintenance of iron-sulfur clusters in mitochondria. In corroboration, VA treated
  cells exhibited reorganization of mitochondrial structures and decreased functions
  of mitochondria as evidenced by enhanced VA toxicity on non-fermentable carbon source
  medium. Also, Iron is an essential cofactor for Grx (Glutaredoxin), which converts
  GSSG to reduced glutathione (GSH), which is an essential antioxidant that scavenges
  cellular ROS and thus achieves cellular redox homeostasis. Notably, the sensitivity
  of antioxidant mutants suggests that VA treatment leads to oxidative stress in accordance
  with earlier findings. Alteration in redox homeostasis leads to genomic instability.
  Our results also suggest that VA treatment leads to genomic stress that resulted
  in degradation of Sml1, a negative regulator of RNR complex and hence dNTP synthesis.
  We have also evidenced that VA interferes with ER organization and thus resulted
  in transcriptional regulation of lipid homeostasis and suppression of unfolded protein
  response. Moreover, major MAP Kinases Hog1 (p38) of Osmotic stress and Slt2 (p44/42)
  of CWI pathway that responds to diverse stress conditions also got activated upon
  VA exposure and thus leads to transcriptional induction of stress-responsive genes
  and CWI genes. As VA is HDAC inhibitor, the entire transcriptional regulation of
  genes of diverse cellular pathways by VA might be credited to its effects through
  alteration of histone and DNA modifications.
