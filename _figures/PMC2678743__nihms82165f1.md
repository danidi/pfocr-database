caption: Three enzymes are indispensable for the synthesis of melanin (eu- and pheo-melanogenesis
  as discussed in the text). Tyrosinase (TYR) is the rate-limiting enzyme for initial
  melanogenesis; DOPAchrome tautomerase (DCT) and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1)
  are also involved in modulating eumelanogenesis. So far, no specific enzymes related
  to pheomelanogenesis have been detected. Other melanosome-specific proteins that
  help modulate melanin biosynthesis are listed.
