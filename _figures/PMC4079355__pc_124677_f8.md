caption: Genes Involved in the Flavonoid Biosynthesis and Regulatory Pathways Are
  Downregulated in atg5.A diagram of the flavonoid pathway was adapted from . The
  steps are catalyzed by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase
  (C4H), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase
  (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H), flavonol
  synthase (FLS), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS or
  LDOX), anthocyani(di)n glycosyltransferase (AGT), anthocyanin acyl transferase (AAT),
  and glutathione S-transferase (GST). PAP1, TT8, and PAP2, the main regulators of
  DFR and LDOX steps, are also shown. Genes encoding all the enzymes involved in the
  flavonoid pathway are in green typeface. Microarray data (Box 1) are presented as
  three squares for the relative gene expressions in atg5 grown under low nitrate
  for 30 d (first square), under low nitrate for 60 d (second square), and under high
  nitrate for 60 d (third square). Square colors in yellow, white, or blue indicate
  significant upregulation in atg5, no difference between atg5 and the wild type,
  or downregulation in atg5, respectively. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR performed
  on transcripts of atg5 and atg9 confirmed downregulation (red arrows) of the genes
  surrounded in blue and histograms (Box 2; mean and sd are shown on three plant replicates;
  two technical replicates showed similar results) of the relative gene expressions
  are presented in the top left box. The decreases observed in quercetin and anthocyanin
  compounds are illustrated by the representation of the histograms of A1342 and Q-3-Rha(1-2)Glc7-O-Rha
  concentrations in atg5 (black bars) and the wild type (gray bars) (Boxes 3 and 4,
  respectively; mean and sd are shown; n = 3 plant replicates).
