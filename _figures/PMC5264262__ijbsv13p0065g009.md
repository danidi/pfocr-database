caption: Model depicting the proposed mechanism by which FT-A exert antipyretic effect.
  Target-derived pyrogenic cytokines such as PGE2 and IL-8, stimulated TRPV1 activation,
  inducing Ca2+ influx, subsequently activated MAPKs signal pathway. At the nucleus,
  MAPKs signaling can increase TRPV1 expression and pyrogenic cytokines. Consequently,
  the increased TRPV1 could be transported to the membrane of the cell, and the elevated
  PGE2 and IL-8 could be secreted out of the cell, and activated TRPV1. Red arrow
  mark indicates that an inhibition or a downregulation in this study observed.
