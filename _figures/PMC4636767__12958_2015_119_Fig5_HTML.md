caption: Schematic presentation of a model highlighting the probable mode of action
  of AMA on placental development. Typically, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediated
  action in cytotrophoblasts under the influence of adequate stimuli from decidual
  cells, T-cells, B-cells, macrophages and NK cells at maternal-fetal interface results
  in elaboration of a group of cyto/chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL10, IL1, IL6,
  IL16, IL-2RA, MIF and TNF) which are associated with inflammatory and tolerogenic
  activities. Substantial evidence suggests that Toll-like receptor signaling pathway
  involving IL1, IL6, and TNF is critical during early placental development. As shown,
  many of these cytokines via specific receptors and associated molecules with down-stream
  engagement of effector moieties (e.g., NF-kB, ERK, MAPK, IP3, DAG and p53) regulate
  different cellular processes (e.g., inflammatory responses, cell survival, growth,
  proliferation, migration and apoptosis) on homotypic and heterotypic cells as shown
  by dashed arrows. The helical peptide like AMA with cationic moieties negatively
  affects the above-mentioned process at multiple levels as shown by gray arrows.
  Thus, AMA peptides putatively affect a variety of different cellular outcomes, depending
  upon the peptide concentrations and the nature of its interactions with cell membranes
  and membrane proteins, resulting in inadequacy of cellular homeostasis. The cytokines
  upregulated by AMA are shown in blue italics and down-regulated ones by AMA are
  shown in red italics. For further details, see the  section and relevant references
