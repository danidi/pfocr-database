caption: Pathway of alkane metabolism under sulfate-reducing conditions based on the
  pathway proposed by Wilkes et al. (). The numbered carbons indicate the positions
  of isotopically heavy carbon atoms (13C). The number indicates the metabolic cycle
  number, and the lowercase letter and subscript indicate the sites of additional
  label incorporation as a result of pathway cycling. Metabolites that were experimentally
  detected using 13C NMR and/or GC-MS are indicated by asterisks.
