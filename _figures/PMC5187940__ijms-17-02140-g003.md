caption: 'The effect of Pb on the signaling pathway TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB and the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines in microglial cells. LPS: lipopolysaccaride; MD-2:
  myeloid differentiation 2; TLR-4: toll like receptor 4; MyD88: myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88; IRAK: IL-1R-associated kinase; TRAF6: TNF receptor-associated
  factor-6; TAB: TAK1 binding proteins; ATF2: activating transcription factor; IKK:
  IκB kinase, TAK1: kinase transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1; MAP kinases:
  mitogen-activated protein kinases []. Microglial cells can initiate an innate immune
  response by TLRs located on their surface. Upon the stimulation of toll like receptor
  4 (TLR-4), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) binds to the
  cytoplasmatic domain of TLR-4. This is followed by the activation of IL-1R-associated
  kinase (IRAK-4), which results in the phosphorylation of IRAK-1. Activated IRAK-1
  binds to TNF receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6 factor), thus allowing the activation
  of the TAK1/TAB complex kinase transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1/
  TAK1 binding proteins. The activated TAK1/TAB complex activates IκB kinase (IKK)
  and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases). The activated IKK kinase leads
  to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB in the proteasome, and thereby the
  release of NF-κB from the NF-IKB-κB complex. The above-mentioned process enables
  the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus, where the expression of genes encoding
  pro-inflammatory cytokines is induced.'
