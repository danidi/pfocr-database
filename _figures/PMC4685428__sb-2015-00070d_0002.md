caption: 'Terpenoid biosynthesis via the MEP pathway in engineered Synechocystis.
  The native enzymes relevant for this paper are marked in blue, and the introduced
  C. forskohlii enzymes in green. Hemi-, mono- and sesquiterpenoids have not been
  identified in Synechocystis and are marked with dashed boxes. Abbreviations used:
  G3P = glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, DXP = 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate, MEP = methylerythritol-4-phosphate,
  CDP-ME = diphosphocytidylyl methylerythritol, CDP-MEP = methylerythritol-2-phosphate,
  ME-cPP = methylerythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate, HMBPP = hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate,
  IPP = isopentenyl diphosphate, DMAPP = dimethylallyl diphosphate, GPP = geranyl
  diphosphate, FPP = farnesyl diphosphate, GGPP = geranylgeranyl diphosphate, NADP(H)
  = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, CTP/CMP = cytidine tri(mono)phosphate,
  PPi = diphosphate, ATP/ADP = adenosine tri(di)phosphate, Fdred/ox = ferredoxin reduced/oxidized,
  OPP = diphosphate group.'
