caption: Sphingosine-1-phosphate signaling pathway. In this scheme the enzymes that
  participate in the synthesis, transport and degradation of S1P are represented.
  The bioactive molecule S1P can be generated through the phosphorylation of sphingosine
  by sphingosine kinases (SphK1 and SphK2). S1P is transported across the plasma membrane
  by ABC transporters and spinsters homolog 2 (Spns2). Most of characterized actions
  of S1P are mediated through binding to a family of five G protein-coupled receptors
  referred to as S1P receptor types 1–5 (S1P1-5). S1P can be dephosphorylated by the
  action of two S1P-specific phosphatases (SPP1–2) and three lipid phosphate phosphatases
  (LPP1-3). The generated sphingosine can be reutilized by SphKs to produce S1P or
  be available for the synthesis of complex sphingolipids. In addition, irreversible
  clearance of S1P to ethanolamine-1-phosphate and hexadecenal occurs by the action
  of S1P lyase (S1PL).
