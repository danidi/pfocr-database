caption: Expected inhibitory steps in the central carbon metabolism, including the
  EMP pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the TCA cycle. Metabolites framed
  by solid lines increased in the presence of fluoride; metabolites in gray boxes
  decreased in the presence of fluoride; metabolites framed by broken lines showed
  no or low detection; and metabolites in italics were not detectable by the CE-MS
  system in the present study. Metabolic reactions catalyzed by (1) enolase (2PG←→PEP),
  (2) aldolase (F1,6BP←→DHAP + G3P), (3) glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
  (G3P←→1,3BPG), and (4) phosphoglycerate kinase (1,3BPG,←→.3PG). G3P, glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate; 1,3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; 2PG, 2-phosphoglycerate. See  for
  abbreviations of other metabolites.
