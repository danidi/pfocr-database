caption: Peroxisomal lipid synthesis is required for maintaining neutrophil viability
  and membrane integrity. In healthy neutrophils, fatty acid synthase (FAS) and PexRAP
  participate in peroxisomal lipid synthesis, including the generation of ether-linked
  phospholipids that are incorporated into the plasma membrane, contributing to membrane
  integrity. Genetic ablation of FAS or PexRAP disrupts the lipid synthetic pathway,
  leading to a preferential loss of ether-linked phospholipids in neutrophils. This
  alters membrane stability, leading to the activation of ER stress, increased apoptosis,
  and ultimately neutropenia
