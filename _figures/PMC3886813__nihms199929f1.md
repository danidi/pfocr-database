caption: '(A) The structure of NFkB proteins. NF-κB proteins are defined by a C-terminal
  RHD, which can be activated by phosphorylation. p65, RelB and c-Rel contain TAD,
  which can activate NF-κB target genes. p100 and p105 lack TADs but contain AR domains
  and N-terminal DDs. RelB also contains a LZ. (B) TNF-α is one of the most potent
  activators of NF-κB,and is produced in the CNS by microglia, astrocytes, endothelial
  cells and some neurons. TNF-α binds to the TNF-α receptor and activates the IKK
  kinase, which consists of three subunits: α, β and γ. IKK phosphorylates (yellow
  circles) the inhibitory protein IκBα and targets this protein for Ub mediated degradation.
  The liberated NF-κB dimer translocates into the nucleus, undergoes phosphorylation
  (yellow circle) and/or acetylation (green circle), and binds to κB elements in the
  promoters of target genes to regulate gene expression.AR: Ankyrin repeat; DD: Death
  domain; IKK: IκB kinase; LZ: Leucine zipper domain; RHD: Rel homology domain; TAD:
  Transactivation domains; Ub: Ubiquitin.'
