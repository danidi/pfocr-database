caption: This figure summarizes the central s-resistin downregulation effects on hypothalamic
  and peripheral insulin and leptin sensitivity. Knocked down central s-resistin by
  ICV injection of lentiviral RNAi, improves hypothalamic insulin pathway increasing
  IRβ and IRS-1 activity by the up-regulation in tyrosine phosphorylation. In agreement
  with that, the inhibitory Ser307-phosphorylation of IRS-1 decreased in treated rats
  together with the JNK activity, major responsible of IRS-1 Ser-phosphorylation.
  The improvement of central insulin signalling is also supported by the fall of PTP-1B
  expression and protein activation, possibly due to the improvement of the inflammatory
  state (see below). Besides, the hypothalamus raises its leptin sensibility by increasing
  STAT-3 activation that promotes POMC expression and prevent the NPY one. The downregulation
  of TNFα, IL-6, iNOS, JNK and the transcription factor NK-κB combined with the upregulation
  of IL-10 support a decrease on the inflammatory status in the hypothalamus of treated
  rats. All these improvements in the central inflammatory state contribute equally
  to ameliorate the hypothalamic insulin and leptin signalling. Also, the reduction
  of central s-resistin decreased adipokines secretion and enhanced peripheral insulin
  sensitivity. Take together all these results indicate that s-resistin could be a
  key player implicated in the development of central insulin resistance and inflammatory
  disease.
