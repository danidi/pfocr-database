caption: Schematic illustration of the cell type-specific effects of impaired PI3K-Akt
  signaling in AD brain. The impaired PI3K-Akt signaling might be due to decreased
  PI3K subunit levels observed in the brain of AD patients or due to T2D, which alters
  insulin levels and affects PI3K-Akt pathway in the brain, augmenting AD pathogenesis.
  These alterations could have distinct effects in different cell types in the brain,
  as shown in the figure. Activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway by several extracellular
  stimuli, such as growth factors (insulin, BDNF, etc.), affects proliferation, metabolism,
  and survival in various cell types. In neurons, GSK3β activity and tau phosphorylation
  and mTOR activity affecting autophagy are influenced. Microglial transit to DAM
  phenotype, phagocytosis, and cytokine production, and formation of microglia clusters
  around Aβ plaques are affected. Inflammatory cytokines secreted by microglia activate
  astrocytes, which transit to the reactive A1 phenotype unable to support neuronal
  outgrowth and synaptogenesis. Furthermore, genetic variation in AKT2 gene alters
  glucose uptake, probably in astrocytes, potentially affecting brain energy metabolism.
