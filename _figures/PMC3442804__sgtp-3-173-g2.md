caption: Figure 2. PEA-15 function is determined by phosphorylation. Only unphosphorylated
  PEA-15 has been associated with tumor-suppressor functions so far. In this state
  PEA-15 interacts with ERK preventing ERK nuclear translocation and activation of
  nuclear targets. Phosphorylation at Ser104 by protein kinase C (PKC), which can
  be induced by phorbol esters (PMA) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), blocks ERK
  binding of PEA-15. This reverses the effects PEA-15 has on MAPK/ERK signaling, resulting
  in elevated transcription and cell proliferation. Phosphorylation at Ser116 by calcium
  calmodulin kinase II (CamKII) or AKT promotes PEA-15 binding to FADD. Thereby it
  blocks death receptor activated apoptosis. For this function PEA-15 phosphorylation
  at Ser104 is not required (*). Ser116 phosphorylated PEA-15 retains its ability
  to activate PLD1 and can thereby enhance ERK pathway activation. The phosphorylated
  states of PEA-15 have been implicated in tumor progression and have been found to
  induce higher tumor cell invasion and increased tumor cell survival.
