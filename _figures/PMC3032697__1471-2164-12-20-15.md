caption: 'Time course changes in cytokine network pathways of lungs from 9 V/null
  mice. Thirteen pro-inflammatory (A) and eleven anti-inflammatory (B) genes were
  differentially regulated in lungs of 9 V/null mice across the 4 to 28 wk period.
  IFNg-regulated pro- or IL-4-regulated anti-inflammatory genes were selected using
  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and the pathways were built using PathwayArchitect 2.0.1.
  Expression levels of pro- or anti-inflammatory genes are represented by color: red
  ≥ 1.8 fold change; white within ±1.8 fold change. The connecting lines between genes
  indicate interactions. The expression of IFNγ, IL-6, NOS2, TNFα, IL-4 and CD163
  did not meet the statistical significance, but did have antibody positivity. Theses
  are designated as: weak (orange), medium (purple), or high (red) immunohistological
  signals.'
