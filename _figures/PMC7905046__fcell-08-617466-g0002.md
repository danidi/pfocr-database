caption: The mechanism and dysfunction of MSC senescence in MDS. (1) Cells that contributed
  to MSCs, such as SSCs, neural crest-derived cells, and nes-CreER+ stromal cells,
  were reduced or depleted in MDS. In contrast, leptin receptors, which are detrimental
  to the function of MSCs, increased over time. (2) The senescence of MDS-MSCs may
  be related to increases in cell telomerase length, chromosome methylation status,
  abnormal proliferation regulation signal pathway, cell cycle arrest, and other factors.
  (3) The senescent MDS-MSCs exhibited reduced differentiation potential and stem
  cell support capacity.
