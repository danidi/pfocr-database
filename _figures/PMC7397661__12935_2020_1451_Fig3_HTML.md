caption: Interrelated regulatory of CircRNA and EMT. The biological role of circRNA
  in EMT and major interconnected regulatory networks in esophageal cancer. Several
  fundamental effectors including Vimentin, Cadherin, Snail and Claudin in this regulatory
  network. Some circRNAs via interacting with various target genes (including HMGA2,
  ENAH and AKT2) and β-catenin pathway promote EMT and initiate metastasis
