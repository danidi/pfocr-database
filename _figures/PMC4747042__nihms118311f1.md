caption: 'Panel A: Architecture of selected aerobic respiratory pathways in mycobacteria.
  Panel B: Biosynthetic pathway for menaquinone in E. coli. Enzyme names are indicated
  in bold. C: Structure of the major menaquinone species found in mycobacteria, MK-9
  (II-H2) (); calculated monoisotopic mass = 786.63148. Menaquinones are identified
  by the length and chemical structure of prenyl chain, the predominant form of menaquinone
  in mycobacteria has 9 isoprene units with the second one being saturated (indicated
  by the arrow). Hence this menaquinone is identified as MK-9 (II-H2). The fully unsaturated
  version is known as MK-9 and has a calculated monoisotopic mass of 784.61583'
