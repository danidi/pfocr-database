caption: 'Coexpression of the genes for fatty acid biosynthesis. A – Fatty acid biosynthesis
  in chloroplast. Candidate genes for enzymatic function (enzyme names in blue) are
  shown in black or red font; genes whose Locus ID is in red are co-expressed. These
  genes form connected network in Fig. 2B and encode all enzymes required for the
  biosynthesis of 18-carbon fatty acids from acetyl-CoA (sequence of reactions on
  the lighter green background), as well as genes for producing of acetyl-CoA substrate,
  and for biosynthesis of biotin and lipoic acid, obligate cofactors for the acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase and for pyruvate dehydrogenase (sequence of reactions on the lighter
  yellow background). Gene for pyruvate kinase (on yellow background, identified by
  search for genes co-expressed with MOD1), required for production of pyruvate, is
  also co-expressed with genes from the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway [see Additional
