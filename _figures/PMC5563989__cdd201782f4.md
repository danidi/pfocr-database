caption: Molecular hierarchical regulation of apoptosis, calcium, the UPR and autophagy
  by the BCL-2 family of proteins. Different pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the
  BCL-2 family regulate apoptosis, ER calcium homeostasis, the UPR and autophagy by
  a complex network of protein–protein interactions with different functional hierarchical
  organizations. (a) In a combined model of apoptosis regulation by the BCL-2 family,
  BH3-only activators may directly engage BAX or BAK, causing their homo-oligomerization
  and MOMP. Anti-apoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family bind to and sequester activator
  BH3-only proteins, inhibiting cell death. This inhibitory function may be reversed
  by sensitizer BH3-only proteins. (b) At the ER membrane, anti-apoptotic BCL-2 interacts
  with IP3R inhibiting its calcium leak channel activity, leading to low transient
  calcium release and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. This inhibition may be
  antagonized by BAX, BAK and proapoptotic BH3-only proteins, increasing ER-to-mitochondrial
  calcium transfer and triggering mPTP-driven necrosis/apoptosis. Additionally, BI-1
  also interacts with and blocks IP3R, probably downstream of BCL-2 proteins. (c)
  BAX, BAK, BCL-2 and BH3-only proteins BIM and PUMA activate IRE1α signaling upon
  ER stress. Interestingly, this function depends on the formation of a protein complex
  between BIM/PUMA and BCL-2, and can be inhibited by BAD or the BH3 mimetics ABT-737.
  BI-1 inhibits IRE1α and BAX/BAK. (d) Anti-apoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family
  inhibit autophagy through the interaction with Beclin-1. BH3-only proteins or ABT-737
  may displace this inhibitory interaction, releasing Beclin-1 and inducing autophagy.
  Interestingly, the IRE1α/JNK pathway may also induce autophagy through the phosphorylation
  and inhibition of BCL-2
