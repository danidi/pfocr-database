caption: Chimeric pathways, like this one describing the synthesis of different CDP-3,6-dideoxyhexoses,
  comprise reactions and enzymes from multiple organisms, and are not expected to
  occur in their entirety in a single organism. The title of chimeric MetaCyc pathways
  is labeled as such to ensure that the reader is aware of their special status. In
  addition, rather than a taxonomic range, the pathway comments provide a list of
  taxa known to possess parts of the pathway (not shown). Compounds are shown in red,
  enzymes in yellow, genes in purple, and EC numbers in blue.
