caption: Alteration to activity of the Akt/GSK3-β signalling pathway can explain a
  number of the changes observed in microarray analysis of flies expressing rCAG,
  rCUG and rAUUCU repeats in the nervous system. Genes for which a Drosophila orthologue
  showed altered transcript levels in microarray analysis of flies expressing at least
  one of the untranslated repeat constructs are shown in red. Activation of Akt can
  be regulated by a number of different signals, including glutamate () or neurotrophic
  (,) signals and Ca2+signalling (). Activated Akt is in turn involved in down-regulation
  of GSK3-β activity which is involved in regulation of a number of transcription
  factors, including MEF2 () and CREB (), which is an orthologue of Drosophila Nej.
  Both CREB and MEF2 have been demonstrated to play a role in the regulation of expression
  of the nuclear receptor NUR77, an orthologue of Drosophila Hr38, in a calcium-dependent
  manner (). Activation of NUR77 can also be regulated directly by Akt (). The Akt/GSK3-β
  signalling pathway is therefore able to have broad downstream transcriptional effects.
  A number of links between Akt activity and expanded repeat-containing proteins themselves
  have also been demonstrated. Akt phosphorylates HTT, ataxin-1 and the androgen receptor
  (AR) (stars), altering their interactions with other proteins (–). Phosphorylation
  of ataxin 3 by GSK3-β (star) has also been recently demonstrated to regulate nuclear
  entry and therefore may play a role in SCA3 (). Expression of expanded CUG repeats
  has also been demonstrated to alter activation of the Akt/Gsk3-β pathway in PC12
  cells ().
