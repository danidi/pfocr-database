caption: Schematic representation of the results described in this study linking Ras
  signaling to p53 inactivation in cell cycle control. (Left) In normal cells, Ras
  signaling activates the MAPK cascade, which leads to the inactivation of the p53/p21Cip1/Rb
  tumor suppressor axis by preventing acetylation of K161/162 residues. Inactivation
  of these tumor suppressors licenses cells to proliferate. (Center) In Rasless cells,
  inactivation of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway leads to activation of p53 via acetylation
  of K161/162 residues. Transcriptionally active p53 induces expression of p21Cip1,
  which, in turn, activates Rb, preventing cells from entering the cell cycle. (Right)
  Cells lacking Ras proteins and an inactive p53/p21Cip1/Rb axis (due to the absence
  of p53) undergo retroactivation of the Raf/Mek/Erk cascade, leading to sustained
  cell proliferation.
