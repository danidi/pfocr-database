caption: Signals 1 and 2 for nod‐like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) activation may be
  delivered by cGAS or TLR9. (a) The dsDNA sensor cGAS senses cytosolic mtDNA upon
  mitochondrial permeabilisation induced by apoptosis or other mitochondrial damage
  events. cGAS activates STING via a second messenger, cGAMP, to drive type I IFN
  signalling. Signalling through this cGAS/cGAMP pathway primes and activates NLRP3,
  functioning as both signal 1 and signal 2 for NLRP3 inflammasome signalling. (b)
  mtDNA is released to the extracellular environment during cell lysis. mtDNA may
  be recognised by TLR9, an endosome‐localised sensor for CpG‐rich unmethylated DNA.
  TLR9 ligation provides signal 1 for NLRP3 activity, for example by transcriptionally
  upregulating NF‐κB target genes in the inflammasome pathway (NLRP3, pro‐IL‐1β).
