caption: Rap1 promotes tumor progression via disruption of E-cadherin-mediated cell
  adhesion. Rap1 activation leads to the reduction in E-cadherin expression, resulting
  in the loss of epithelial cell–cell adhesive junctions and contact inhibition of
  proliferation. During the restoration of Rap1GAP expression in tumor cells, Rap1
  will be inactivated and thus inhibiting tumor progression. ↑ indicates upregulation
  of the pathway while ↓ indicates downregulation of the pathway.
