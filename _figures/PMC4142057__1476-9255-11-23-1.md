caption: Activation of NF-κB signaling through canonical and alternative pathways.
  Different cytokines and pathogen associated molecules (PAMs) interact with their
  specific receptors (cytokine receptors:TNF receptor, IL1 receptor; PAMs recognize
  TLRs present on outer cell membrane (TLR1,-2,-4,-5,-6, and -10) or on the endosomal
  membrane (TLR3, -7, -8 and -9) in the initial stage of NF- κB activation pathway.
  The activated receptor recruit the adapter components (not shown) such as Myd88
  and TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN- γ, except TLR3 which utilizes
  TRIF without Myd88 (Myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) to transmit
  the signal through activation of several mediators components including IRAK4 (IL1
  receptor associated kinase 4), TRAF6 (TNF receptor associated factor 6), to activate
  IKKK i.e., MEKK1 (mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase/extracellular signa l regulated
  kinase (ERK) kinase kinase 1), MEKK3 and TAK1 (transforming growth factor β activated
  kinase) to act to phosphorylate IKK complex. The activated IKK modifies the inhibitor
  I κB for its proteasomal degradation. NF- κB is released free to enter into the
  nucleus for transcriptional activation of the target genes. The canonical pathway
  is active in innate immunity, inflammation and cell survival; the alternative pathway
  mediates the humoral immunity.
