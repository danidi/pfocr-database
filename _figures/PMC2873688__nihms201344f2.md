caption: The pathway of insulin-stimulated production of reactive oxygen species.
  The generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (super oxide or H2O2), initiated
  by insulin is coupled to the NADPH oxidase system. This pathway involves the activation
  of the catalytic subunit homologue, Nox 4 (). Superoxide generated by the NADPH
  oxidase system is converted to H2O2 and plays a role in modifying the catalytic
  activity of thiol-dependent regulatory proteins. The generation of reactive oxygen
  species by insulin may be enhanced by high glucose levels that increase mitochondrial
  superoxide production and may also activate the NADPH oxidase system. (This figure
  is a modification from .)
