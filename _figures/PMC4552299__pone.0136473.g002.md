caption: 'The network is associated with hematological system development and function,
  cancer and cellular movement. Up-regulated genes in our study are marked in green
  colour; the colour intensity of the nodes indicates the degree of up-regulation.
  Transcripts in grey were not differentially expressed. Genes are represented as
  nodes, and the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as a line:
  the plain line indicates direct interaction, the dashed line indicates indirect
  interaction; the line without arrowhead indicates binding only, the line finishing
  with a vertical line indicates inhibition; the line with an arrowhead indicates
  ‘acts on’.'
