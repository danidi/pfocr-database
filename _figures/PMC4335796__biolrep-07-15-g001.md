caption: Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) exists in the cytoplasm in an inactive form bound
  by the inhibitor IκB. Proteasome-mediated degradation of IκB is linked to its phosphorylation
  by the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase (IKK) complex. This complex consists of IKKα, IKKβ,
  and IKKγ (also known as NEMO; NF-κB essential modulator). Polyubiquitination and
  degradation of IκB initiated by its phosphorylation results in the release and nuclear
  translocation of NF-κB to activate various genes for inflammatory chemokines, cytokines,
  and cell surface proteins. While the canonical pathway is required for rapid response
  following stimulation, the non-canonical pathway exhibits slower kinetics and is
  solely dependent on the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IKKα, not the trimeric IKK
  complex. NIK associates with the p100 subunit (NF-κB2) and induces its cleavage
  to its active form, p52. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor
  6 (TRAF6) activates the canonical NF-κB signaling and TNF receptor-associated factor
  3 (TRAF3) attenuates the non-canonical NF-κB signaling. NLRP6, NLRP4, NOD2, NLRC3,
  and NLRX1 have all been reported to suppress canonical NF-κB signaling, while NLRP12
  inhibits both canonical and non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways, the latter through
  degradation of NIK and the former through inhibition of IκB phosphorylation. NLRX1
  and NLRC3 associate with and inhibit TRAF6 and the IKK complex, resulting in the
  attenuation of canonical NF-κB signaling following Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation.
  NLRP4 also activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase, DTX4, causing ubiquitination of TANK-binding
  kinase 1 (TBK1), leading to the latter's degradation and reduced type I IFN.

  description: Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) exists in the cytoplasm in an inactive form
