caption: Metabolic responses of S. melonis and M. extorquens during growth on plants.
  Up-regulation of TCA cycle proteins during leaf colonization of S. melonis Fr1 (A).
  Several pathways feeding into this central metabolic cycle indicate which plant
  derived substrates might be utilized during phyllosphere growth. Pathway and involved
  proteins of oxalate metabolism by M. extorquens PA1 (B). Arrows are shown in blue
  (up-regulated) and yellow (down-regulated) if corresponding proteins are significantly
  regulated (fold change ≥ 2, p value ≤ 0.05). Fold changes indicated below the figures
  are logarithmized (log2); a star indicates a p value ≤ 0.05.
