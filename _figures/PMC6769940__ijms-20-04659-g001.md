caption: Interference of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with the nuclear factor erythroid
  2 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/ Keap1-signaling pathway. Lines labelled with
  an “X” represent blocked processes, dotted lines describe indirect processes, solid
  lines describe translocations or direct effects.HCV is associated with oxidative
  stress in liver cells that results in increased levels of ROS. ROS in HCV infected
  hepatocytes can be related to ER-stress and the UPR, mitochondrial dysregulation,
  Ca2+ redistribution, activation of NADPH oxidases and enhanced expression of CYP2E1
  and Ero1α. The increased ROS-levels further trigger phosphorylation of p62 on Ser349
  that activates Nrf2. Based on the impaired Nrf2/Keap1-signaling pathway in HCV-infected
  cells, the oxidative stress cannot be compensated. This mechanism is based on a
  core-mediated delocalization of sMaf-proteins from the nucleus to the ER-associated
  RCs, where they are trapped by binding to NS3. As a consequence, the delocalized
  sMaf-proteins bind to Nrf2 and prevent the translocation of Nrf2 into to the nucleus
  resulting in impaired expression of cytoprotective genes. In addition NS5A interferes
  with Nrf2-activation via a crosstalk with the MAPK-signaling cascade. NS5A recruits
  cRaf to the ER-associated RCs resulting in activation of cRaf and NS5A phosphorylation.
  However, despite cRaf activation no activation of the MAPK signaling cascade could
  be observed resulting in impaired Nrf2-activation. The elevated ROS-levels further
  interfere with mechanisms involved in liver regeneration. Impaired Nrf2 activation
  results in a decreased tyrosine phosphorylation and enhanced serine/threonine-phosphorylation
  of IRS-1 and -2 that may contribute to the development of insulin resistance and
  impaired liver regeneration. However, the mechanisms regulating increased ROS-levels
  in HCV-infected cells are conflicting. UPR, unfolded protein response; NOX, NADPH
