caption: Proposed signaling pathways for EZH2-related modulation of TNBC cell migration
  and invasion abilities. Schematic model presents the transcriptional repression
  of TIMP-2 by EZH2, which plays an active role in the upregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9
  activity and promotes invasion and migration of TNBC cells.
