caption: Canonical NF-κB signalling pathway (left) utilising p65/p50 and the alternative
  NF-κB signalling pathway (right) signalling through RelB. While P. aeruginosa and
  flagellin signal through TLR4 / TLR5-NF-κB (p65), P. histicola signals through TLR5
  activating the alternative NF-kB (RelB) pathway. HIF1α mediates this signalling
  through activation of IKKα. However, RelB might introduce a negative feedback on
  HIF-1a and may also inhibit IKbα. Proteins determined within the study are highlighted
  in colour.
