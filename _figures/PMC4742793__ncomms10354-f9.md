caption: Schematic showing the proposed model of integrin-β1–Wnt7a–Decorin signalling
  pathway. The green cell represents the CA*β1-expressing cell, which undergoes proliferation
  and self-renewal with upregulation of Wnt7a. Wnt7a is secreted, promoting Wnt7a
  signalling within the CA*β1-expressing cell via the CBP branch of the Wnt pathway,
  leading to proliferation and self-renewal. Wnt7a also acts on the neighbouring,
  negative cell (blue/red cell) via the LRP5/6 receptor, signalling via the p300 branch
  of the Wnt pathway. This leads to the upregulation of Decorin expression. Decorin
  is secreted and acts in an autocrine manner on the negative cell via the TGF-β receptor,
  promoting differentiation.
