caption: STING and MAVS are key adaptors in cytosolic nucleic acid–sensing pathways
  during virus infection. Their phosphorylation by TBK1 is an essential and conserved
  mechanism that leads to recruitment of IRF3 and subsequent activation of the type
  I IFN pathway. However, cells must regulate their IFN production carefully to prevent
  inflammation and autoimmunity. Therefore, the activities of STING and MAVS must
  be tightly regulated to ensure a proper innate immune homeostasis in infected host
  cells. Host protein phosphatase PPM1G, as identified in this study, dephosphorylates
  p-STING and p-MAVS and tones down the response of the cytosolic DNA– and RNA–sensing
  pathways, thereby contributing to maintenance of a balanced antiviral innate immune
  response (left). However, this system is hijacked by KSHV for immune evasion. During
  KSHV de novo infection, tegument protein ORF33 is released from KSHV virion into
  the cytoplasm. ORF33 directly interacts with STING/MAVS and recruits PPM1G, resulting
  in enhanced dephosphorylation of p-STING/p-MAVS, impaired recruitment of IRF3 and
  suppression of type I IFN pathway. When KSHV is reactivated from latency, newly
  synthesized ORF33 is also likely to facilitate viral lytic replication by recruiting
  PPM1G to dephosphorylate p-STING/MAVS, thereby suppressing host antiviral activities
  (right).
