caption: 'Boxed line-sense strand RNA. Single line-antisense strand RNA. “AUG”-functional
  translation initiation codon (could be other than AUG). “TCE”– 3’-terminal complementary
  element; “ICE”– internal complementary element, both on the antisense RNA strand.
  Yellow circle – helicase/ modifying activity complex. Blue lines (both single and
  boxed) – RNA strand modified and separated from its complement by a helicase complex.
  Red arrow – position of cleavage of the chimeric intermediate. Step 1: Synthesis
  of antisense strand; step 2: Strand separation; step 3: Folding of antisense strand
  into self-priming configuration; step 4: Extension of self-primed antisense RNA;
  step 5: Strand separation; step 6: Cleavage of the chimeric intermediate; step 7:
  End-products of RNA amplification. Steps 3’−7’ correspond to steps 3–7. Top panel:
  Conventional, genome-transcribed mRNA molecule. Middle panel: Projected stages of
  RNA-dependent mRNA amplification. “ICE” is located within a segment of antisense
  RNA corresponding to the 5’UTR of conventional mRNA; the chimeric RNA end product
  contains the entire coding content of conventional mRNA. Bottom panel: “ICE” is
  located within a segment of antisense RNA corresponding to the coding region of
  conventional mRNA. The amplified chimeric end product contains a 5’-truncated coding
  region of conventional mRNA. The translational outcome is decided by position of
  the first functional translation initiation codon; if in-frame, a CTF of conventional
  polypeptide is produced.'
