caption: 'Current model of the nutritional regulation of the cell cycle by the TORC1–Greatwall–Endosulfine–PP2A-B55
  pathway. In nitrogen-poor media, PP2A-Pab1 is inactivated by the Ppk18–Igo1 pathway.
  Inactivation of PP2A-Pab1: (1) prevents the dephosphorylation of Cdk1–cyclin B target
  proteins, including Cdc25 and Wee1 (autocatalytic loop) leading to premature entry
  into mitosis; (2) prevents the dephosphorylation and inactivation of Gad8, leading
  to the extension of the G1 phase and sexual differentiation. TORC1: Tor complex
  1. Sck1 and Sck2: S6 kinases. Ppk18: Greatwall. Igo1: Endosulfine. PP2A-Pab1: PP2A-B55.
  Gad8: Akt. Fkh2: Transcription factor forkhead 2.'
