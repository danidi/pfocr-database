caption: Anti‐ and proviral roles of autophagy in plants. Autophagy has emerged as
  a central component of antiviral immunity. During infection with an avirulent strain
  of Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), autophagy is activated upon N gene‐mediated recognition
  of the viral p50 protein and contributes to the hypersensitive response (HR). The
  mechanistic details and autophagic targets underlying the death‐promoting activity
  of autophagy in effector‐triggered immunity are still unknown. During virulent virus
  infection, selective autophagy employs the cargo receptor NBR1 to mediate the degradation
  of non‐assembled capsid protein (P4) and particles of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV).
  CaMV evades xenophagy by sequestering P4 and particles in autophagy‐resistant inclusions
  formed by the viral protein P6. NBR1 targets the RNA silencing suppressor HCpro
  of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) in association with potyvirus‐induced RNA granules,
  but the viral proteins VPg and to a lesser extent 6K2 are able to block NBR1 flux
  by as yet unknown mechanisms. NBR1 targeting of viral proteins occurs in an ubiquitin‐dependent
  (TuMV HCpro) or ‐independent manner (CaMV P4). The RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase
  (RdRp) of TuMV is inhibited via direct interaction with ATG6/Beclin1, which is proposed
  to act as cargo receptor for RdRp degradation. Other viral proteins subjected to
  autophagic destruction include the Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) silencing suppressor
  2b, potentially involving the host protein rgs‐CaM, and the virulence factor βC1
  of Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV) through ATG8 binding. Barley stripe mosaic
  virus (BSMV) subverts antiviral autophagy with the help of the γb protein, which
  disrupts ATG7–ATG8 interaction and thus impairs autophagosome formation. Different
  viruses hijack autophagy mechanisms to enhance viral pathogenicity. The TuMV VPg
  protein mediates the autophagic degradation of the host RNA silencing component
  SGS3 and its partner protein RDR6. SGS3 is also targeted during geminivirus infection
  involving the host protein NbCaM. The poleroviral protein P0 triggers ubiquitination
  and autophagic breakdown of AGO1, another component of the RNA silencing pathway.
  The movement protein NSvc4 of Rice stripe virus (RSV) induces the autophagic turnover
  of the group 1 remorin (REM1) protein through interference with its S‐acetylation,
  thereby preventing the REM1‐mediated negative regulation of viral cell‐to‐cell movement.
  Viruses like CaMV and TuMV also benefit from autophagy‐mediated suppression of disease‐associated
  host cell death, but it is unclear if and how viral proteins are involved in autophagy
  activation and which host components are targeted to mediate the cytoprotective
  effects. See also text for further details. Graphical elements are partly adapted
