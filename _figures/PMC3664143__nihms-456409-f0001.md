caption: (A) Notch receptor is activated by the binding of Notch ligands expressed
  on adjacent cells resulting in the cleavage of Notch by metalloprotease ADAM10 or
  ADAM17, followed by γ-secretase. γ-Secretase cleaves Notch to produce NICD, which
  translocates into the nucleus to activate gene transcription. (B) Notch1 fragment
  is cloned between maltose binding protein gene (MBP) and Avi-tag. The construct
  is induced with IPTG in the presence of exogenous biotin. MBP-tagged and biotinylated
  N1-Sb1 is affinity purified and the MBP-tag is removed with thrombin cleavage to
  generate biotinylated N1-Sb1. (C) N1-Sb1 is cleaved by solubilized γ-secretase at
  the S3 site to produce cleaved-N1-Sb1 (cN1-Sb1). SM320 binds to the N-terminal of
  cN1-Sb1. Protein A-acceptor beads interacts with SM320 while streptavidin-donor
  beads bind to the biotin-tag on cN1-Sb1. This multi-entities interaction brings
  the AlphaLISA donor and acceptor beads into close proximity that allows for the
  generation and detection of AlphaLISA signal.
