caption: '(A) In thyrotropes, TGFβ1 activates TGFβ receptors (TBRs) and stimulates
  Smad2/3 signaling cascade leading to repression of the TRHR gene, which reduces
  the TRH-TRHR signaling over the TSHB expression. IGSF1 (green symbols) represses
  TGFβ1 pathway, positively regulating TRHR expression and therefore enhancing TRH-TRHR
  signaling, TSHB synthesis and bioactivity (glycosylation) and TSH secretion from
  the pituitary. In the thyroid, TSH stimulates the TSHR and the synthesis of thyroid
  hormones (T4, T3) which exert a negative feedback over TSHB expression at the pituitary.
  IGSF1 deficiency (red symbols) reduces TSH synthesis and bioactivity, leading to
  central hypothyroidism. (B) In gonadotropes, activin A binds activin receptors (ActRs)
  and stimulates Smad2/3 pathway to increase FSHB transcription. FSH stimulates FSHR
  of Sertoli cells in testis, producing inhibin B, which exerts negative feedback
  over pituitary FSHB expression. IGSF1 (green symbols) inhibits activin A pathway,
  negatively regulating FSHB expression. IGSF1 is proposed here as a mediator of inhibin
  B-repressive effects on FSHB production (black double-arrow). IGSF1 deficiency (red
  symbols) leads to over-secretion of pituitary FSH, inducing proliferation of Sertoli
  cell mass (macroorchidism) and excess synthesis of Inhibin B which, however, seems
  unable to exert the negative feed-back over the synthesis of FSH at the pituitary,
  representing a state of resistance to Inhibin B. TRH: thyrotropin-releasing hormone,
