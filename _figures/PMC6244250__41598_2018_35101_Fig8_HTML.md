caption: A schematic model of the signal transduction in DCs in response to C. krusei
  mannan C. krusei mannan activates TLR2/MyD88 signal in DCs and triggers apoptotic
  death. In parallel, the signal transduction through TLR2/MyD88 interferes with the
  production of IL-12 but promotes the production of IL-6, which consequently skews
  Th1/Th17 differentiation.
