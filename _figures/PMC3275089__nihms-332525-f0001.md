number: Figure 1
caption: A schematic overview of the Aβ-Cav1.2-ptau-autophagy pathway. Three sections
  of the figure are separated by dashed lines for clarity. Soluble Aβ oligomers, soluble
  and insoluble Aβ fibrils generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing
  cause increased expression of Cav1.2 through beta 2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR)/cyclin
  AMP (cAMP) or other unknown pathways (section 1). Aβ production can be directly
  modulated by mutations in the calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) receptor
  located on the endoplasmic reticulum, or in response to treatment with dihydropyridine
  (DHP) class of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (section 2). Intracellular or extracellular
  Aβ can cause over-expression of cav1.2, increased influx of Ca2, disrupted autophagy,
  and up-regulated ptau expression (section 3). Ca2+-calpain pathway can directly
  increase ptau levels or dampen autophagy function. Pathological accumulation of
  autophagosomal vacuoles and ptau will lead to loss of spatial memory and cognition
  in AD (section 3). Isradipine (ISR) appears to block this pathway.
