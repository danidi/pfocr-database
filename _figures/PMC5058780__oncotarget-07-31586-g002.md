caption: In cancers, highly active receptor tyrosine kinases such as MET and EGFR
  phosphorylate Src that then interacts with FAK Y397 through SH2 domain. Juxtaposed
  Src phosphorylates FAK at Y576 and Y577 and possibly other sites, resulting in a
  highly active FAK both in terms of the kinase activity and as an adapter protein.
  In addition, it is also connected to RAS through GRB2 and SOS that feeds into MAPK
  pathway. The CT FAT domain interacts with paxillin that binds to the relatively
  short cytoplasmic tails of integrins. Although the FERM domain is capable of interacting
  with integrins and RTKs, the more favored interaction appears to be through paxillin
  anchored to focal adhesions.
