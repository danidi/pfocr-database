caption: Model for reversal of EMT induced by TGF-β1. To re-express epithelial proteins
  such as E-cadherin, a TβRI kinase inhibitor is needed to decrease expression of
  mesenchymal genes (e.g., ZEB1 and ZEB2), while a Rho kinase inhibitor is required
  to stabilize the epithelial cortical actin. A p38 MAPK inhibitor may also be useful
  as this drug in conjunction with the TβRI kinase inhibitor can further EMT reversal
  by reducing stress fiber actin formation.

papertitle: Complete reversal of epithelial to mesenchymal transition requires inhibition
  of both ZEB expression and the Rho pathway.
