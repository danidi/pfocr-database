caption: Diagram summarizing the signaling transduction pathways involved in RV-induced
  gene expression in primary human TBE cells infected with RV16. The replication of
  viral RNA leads to the formation of dsRNA. dsRNA activates PKR, which is responsible
  for the induction of RV-inducible genes through an unidentified mechanism (indicated
  as “?”). The activation of PKR also induces the secretion of IFN-β. The secreted
  IFN-β binds to the type I IFN receptor in an autocrine/paracrine fashion, which
  leads to the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and the stimulation of RV-inducible
  genes. Various inhibitors and antibody used in this study, and their corresponding
  inhibitory steps, are indicated in this diagram.
