caption: Rickettsia species lack the capability for de novo folate biosynthesis. (A)
  Rickettsiae use GTP cyclohydrolase I (FolE) to convert host-acquired GTP (red) to
  DHN-P3, a precursor of both queuosine (purple) and folate (aquamarine) biosynthesis.
  The classical THF synthesis pathway (aquamarine arrows), wherein DHN-P3 is dephosphorylated
  and subsequently converted to HMDHP by dihydropteridin aldolase (FolB), is disintegrating
  from Rickettsia genomes (Ψ denotes pseudogenization in over 50% of genomes). In
  the FolB bypass proposed by Hunter et al. () (gray dashed arrows), DHN-P3 is directly
  converted to HMDHP or a structurally similar molecule via PTPS-III (black box).
  Our analysis instead suggests that this enzyme is QueD (black box), which performs
  the first committed step in queuosine biosynthesis (see the text for further details).
  The one-carbon pool by folate (orange arrows) illustrates the role of host-acquired
  THF and several intermediates in the essential one-carbon transfer reactions that
  yield pyrimidine deoxynucleoside triphosphates, N-formylmethionyl-tRNA, and Ser/Gly.

  involved in queuosine and THF biosynthesis and reactions within the one-carbon pool

  the queuosine biosynthesis and one-carbon pool by folate pathways are highly conserved
  (see ).
