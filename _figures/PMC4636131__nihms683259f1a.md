caption: 'A: The seven PIs and their relative abundance in resting mammalian cells.
  The approximate relative abundance is derived from our work [, ] and that of others
  [,] in various resting mammalian cells. Indicated are experimentally confirmed cellular
  pathways involved in PI production (solid arrows). In vitro established conversions
  are indicated by dashed arrows. Only the enzymes relevant for this discussion are
  denoted. B: The two pathways for PIKfyve-catalyzed synthesis of constitutive PtdIns5P
  in resting mammalian cells. The direct pathway (1), for which evidence is detailed
  in this paper, consumes one mol ATP and uses PtdIns substrate that is in huge excess.
  The indirect pathway (2), proposed by the authors [, ], consumes 2 PIKfymol ATP
  and incorporates a third reaction of 3-dephosphorylation of the PtdIns(3,5)P2 substrate
  that in quiescent cells constitutes ~1/10 of the product PtdIns5P. The enzyme(s)
  involved in the 3-dephosphorylation reaction of PtdIns(3,5)P2 is(are) still unidentified.'
