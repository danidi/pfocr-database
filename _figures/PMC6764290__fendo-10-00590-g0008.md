caption: A hypothetical model based on scRNA-Seq depicting differences in melatonin
  synthesis between α- and β-pinealocytes. (A,B) The relative strength of a pathway
  module is indicated by opacity; greater opacity represents a more active pathway.
  (A) Conversion of N-acetylserotonin (NAS) to melatonin in α-pinealocytes is enhanced
  by higher ASMT activity and increased S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) availability,
  which is boosted by greater ATP availability. Increased ATP availability reflects
  increased ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos); this is inferred
  by greater expression of mitochondrial genes in α-pinealocytes. ATP availability
  also results from reduced consumption by protein synthesis, as inferred by decreased
  ribosomal transcriptome in α-pinealocytes. (B) β-Pinealocytes do not have the same
  enhancements as α-pinealocytes. (C) N-Acetylserotonin (NAS) that is not converted
  to melatonin in β-pinealocytes enters the α-pinealocyte by passive diffusion through
  membranes and gap junctions (shown in blue) and is converted to melatonin, thereby
  maximizing melatonin production. Reproduced from Mays et al. (). This figure and
