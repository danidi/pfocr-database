caption: Auxin regulation of gene expression. (a) Under sub-threshold auxin concentrations
  the Aux/IAA proteins heterodimerize with the ARF transcription factors, thereby
  repressing auxin-inducible gene expression. (b) The active SCFTIR1 complex, containing
  RUB-modified CUL1, is shown at the bottom. The CSN complex can cleave the RUB modifier
  from CUL1, thus facilitating CAND1 binding to CUL1 and SCF disassembly. Conjugation
  of RUB to CUL1 by the AXR1-ECR1 and RCE1 enzymes might free CUL1 from CAND1, promoting
  re-assembly of the active complex. Genetic studies have shown that all of the components
  depicted in this figure are required for optimal SCFTIR1 activity in vivo. (c) Auxin
  binding to the TIR1/AFB receptors promotes the recruitment of Aux/IAA proteins to
  the SCF complex. Subsequent Aux/IAA ubiquitinylation and proteasome-mediated degradation
  results in a decline in Aux/IAA protein levels, thus de-repressing auxin-inducible
  gene expression. In addition to genes responsible for specific auxin responses,
  the Aux/IAA genes themselves are auxin-inducible. This might represent a negative
  feedback loop that ensures a transient response, with the nascent Aux/IAA proteins
  attenuating the signaling pathway as auxin levels fall by restoring repression of
  the ARF transcription factors. DBD, DNA-binding domain; E1, ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; U, ubiquitin; R, RUB. *,AFB1, AFB2, or
  AFB3.
