caption: The antihypertensive herbal drug/formula- metabolic pathway map. Present
  metabolomics studies showed that antihypertensive herbal drugs/formulas are connected
  with carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and other
  major metabolic pathways, indicating the potential role of metabolic alternations
  induced by traditional Chinese medicine in treating hypertension. The interconnected
  network revealed that the two most prominent substance metabolisms activated by
  traditional Chinese medicine could be lipid and amino acid, as they have more frequent
  and concurrent biological information communications denoted by connecting lines.
