caption: 'A simplified scheme for the heat-stress signal transduction pathway focusing
  on major regulatory components and stress-responsive genes identified so far in
  the grapevine. Protein stress sensor molecules perceive heat-stress signals and
  transmit them through secondary messengers initiating transcription networks to
  provide stress tolerance. Abbreviations: IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; cGMP,
  3′,5′-cyclic guanosine monophosphate; CDPKs, calcium-dependent protein kinases;
  MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; HSPs, heat shock proteins; HSFs, heat
  stress transcription factors; APX, ascorbate peroxidase; DHAR, dehydroascorbate
  reductase; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
