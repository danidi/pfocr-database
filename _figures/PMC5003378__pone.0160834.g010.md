caption: UML communication diagram for the IL-1 stimulated NF-κB signalling pathway.
  Although portraying temporal interactions as per sequence diagrams (not shown),
  we believe that these diagrams are more intuitive for non-Computer Science audiences
  as they are more flexible in relation to the position of system components, thus
  allowing the positioning of components to approximate to the spatial locations within
  a Eukaryotic cell. Developed from reviews of [, ].
