caption: Sequence elements and protein components involved in the formation of poly(A)
  tails. a The specificity and efficiency of cleavage and polyadenylation are determined
  by the binding of multi-protein complexes to specific elements at the 3′ end of
  the pre-mRNA. Most pre-mRNAs contain two core elements. The canonical polyadenylation
  signal AAUAAA (or less frequently AUUAAA) upstream of the cleavage site is recognized
  by the multimeric cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) consisting
  of at least six subunits (CPSF 160, CPSF 100, CPSF 73, CPSF 30, hFip1, and WDR33).
  This RNA-protein interaction determines the site of cleavage 10–30 nt downstream,
  preferentially immediately 3′ of a CA dinucleotide. The second canonical sequence
  element is characterized by a high density of G/U or U residues which is located
  up to 30 nt downstream of the cleavage site. This downstream sequence element (DSE)
  is bound by the 64-kDa subunit of the hetero-trimeric cleavage stimulating factor
  (CSTF) that promotes the efficiency of 3′ end processing. Furthermore, multimers

  assembly of the basal 3′ end processing machinery, the endonucleolytic cleavage
  reaction is catalyzed by CPSF-73, and the cleaved mRNA is polyadenylated by nuclear
