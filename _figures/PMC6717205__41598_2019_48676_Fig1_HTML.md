caption: Schematic overview of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Glycolysis
  and mitochondrial respiration are two major energy-yielding pathways. Glucose is
  converted into pyruvate in the glycolytic pathway. The fate of pyruvate is dependent
  on many factors, of which oxygen availability is important. In anaerobic conditions,
  pyruvate is converted into lactate by LDHA in the cytoplasm. LDHB converts lactate
  into pyruvate. PFBFB3 enzymes generate fructose-2,6-biphosphate (F2,6P2), an allosteric
  activator of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) that is involved in one of the rate-limiting
  steps of glycolysis by the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) to fructose-1,6-biphosphate
  (F1,6P2). ECAR is a measure of lactic acid levels, generated by anaerobic glycolysis.
  In aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle via the PDH complex,
  and is catabolized by oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP is produced by ATP synthase
  (complex Ѵ). OCR is a measure of oxygen utilization in cells and is an indicator
  of mitochondrial function. The conversion of glucose into lactate generates 2 ATP
  per glucose molecule as compared to 36 ATP per glucose molecule when the oxidative
  phosphorylation is used. 2-NBDG; 2-[N-(7-nitobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-amino]-2-deoxy-D
