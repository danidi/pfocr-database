caption: ESR1, SP1 and their target E2F1 all have significantly lower co-expression
  with the cell cycle arrest pathway in NHMM compared to HMM. See Discussion for details.
  Blue arrows refer to literature-supported regulation in breast cancer, and red arrows
  in myeloma. “+p” stands for phosphorylation. Black dotted arrows indicate indirect
  regulation. Red and blue crosses and corresponding downward thick arrows indicate
  literature-supported knock-down of upstream genes or TrFs and the corresponding
  effects in reducing downstream genes’ activity or expression in breast cancer (blue)
  and in myeloma (red).
