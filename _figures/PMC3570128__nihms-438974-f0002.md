caption: Wnt signaling affects c-Myb stability and activity. c-Myb protein is phosphorylated
  and degraded by Wnt-1 signal via the pathway involving TAK1, HIPK2 and NLK. Wnt-1
  causes the nuclear entry of TAK1, which then activates HIPK2 and NLK. NLK directly
  binds to c-Myb DNA binding domain with HIPK2, resulting in the phosphorylation of
  c-Myb at multiple sites (indicated by P), which enhances the interaction of c-Myb
  with Fbw7, a ubiquitin ligase, and as well as the interaction with the SCF complex,
  leading to ubiquitinylation of c-Myb and degradation by the proteasome. Mutations
  in the DNA binding domain of v-Myb decrease the affinity for HIPK2, and the C-terminal
  truncation removes NLK phosphorylation and ubiquitinylation sites, helping v-Myb
  to evade this regulatory mechanism.
