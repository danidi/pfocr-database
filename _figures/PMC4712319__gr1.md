caption: 'A theoretical model of how PRDX floodgate signalling may transduce exercise-induced
  H2O2 signals in skeletal muscle. NADPH oxidase translocation and subsequent H2O2
  production may generate ‘hotspots’ of H2O2 that facilitate the oxidation of thiol-containing
  signalling proteins (e.g. a phosphatase), alongside the simultaneous inactivation
  of the PRDX thiolate. There is evidence that H2O2-mediated over oxidation as well
  as post-translational modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation (serine
  and threonine), glutathionylation, s-nitrosylation and tyrosine nitration of non-catalytic
  PRDX amino acids can prevent nucleophilic attack of the PRDX thiolate on H2O2. In
  this context, the formation of stable PRDX dimers may facilitate extracellular redox-signalling.
  Notes: Thicker arrows represent the dominant pathway during floodgate signalling;
  flat ended arrows indicate inhibition of the PRDX thiolate; dashed circle represents
  a ‘hot spot’ of hydrogen peroxide. S–S is a disulphide bond within the oxidised
  PRDX dimer. Abbreviations: SOD: superoxide dismutase; : superoxide; H2O2: hydrogen
  peroxide; PRDX: peroxiredoxin; H2O: water; –SOH: sulfenic acid: S−: thiolate.'
