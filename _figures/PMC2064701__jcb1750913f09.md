caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanisms by which Akt is activated in cancer
  cells with mitochondrial respiration injury. Genetic factors (mtDNA mutations/deletions)
  and environmental factors (hypoxic conditions) cause defects in mitochondrial respiration
  and render the cancer cells highly dependent on glycolysis for ATP generation. This
  metabolic alteration leads to an increase in NADH caused by the lack of its utilization
  by the respiratory chain and a decrease in NADPH from the PPP. The increased NADH
  effectively competes with NADPH and compromises the ability of NADPH/Trx to keep
  PTEN protein in the reduced state, leading to inactivation of PTEN and activation
  of Akt. The solid arrows indicate increased activity in the respective steps; the
  dashed arrows indicate decreased activity.
