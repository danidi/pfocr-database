caption: The serine/threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), has
  become a major focus of attention because of its critical regulatory role in diverse
  cellular processes, including cancer progression. Activation of growth factor receptors
  (GFRs) is one of the major mechanisms responsible for upregulation of Akt signaling
  which in turn include activation of oncoproteins and inactivation of tumor suppressors
  intersecting the Akt signal transduction pathway. The Akt cascade is activated by
  receptor tyrosine kinases, and other stimuli that induce the production of phosphatidylinositol
  3,4,5 triphosphates [PtdIns(,,)P3P] by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). These lipids
  serve as plasma membrane docking sites for proteins with pleckstrin-homology (PH)
  domains, including Akt and its upstream activator PDK1. Akt regulates cell growth
  through its effects on the mTOR and p70 S6 kinase pathways, as well as cell cycle
  and cell proliferation through its direct action on CDK inhibitors and levels of
  cyclin D1. Akt is a major mediator of cell survival through direct inhibition of
  pro-apoptotic signals such as Bad and the Forkhead family of transcription factors.
