caption: Hydrolysis of sphingomyelin on tumor cell plasma membranes, by platelet derived
  S-ASM, enhances tumor seeding in the lungs(A) Overview of the sphingomyelin hydrolytic
  pathway. (B) Platelet activation, in proximity to B16F10 cells, induces Asm secretion
  from platelets (1). The platelet-derived S-SMase acts on tumor cells to hydrolyze
  SM to Cer at the outer plasma membrane (2), resulting in integrin clustering and
  activation (3). Activated integrin signaling promotes tumor seeding in the lungs
  (4).
