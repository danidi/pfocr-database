caption: Schematic diagram showing the proposed mechanism underlying neuroprotective
  effect of AE leaf extract against glutamate-induced oxidative toxicity. AE leaf
  extract provides neuronal cell protection against oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis
  induced by excessive extracellular glutamate by suppressing ROS formation, inhibiting
  AIF translocation into the nucleus, and activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway
