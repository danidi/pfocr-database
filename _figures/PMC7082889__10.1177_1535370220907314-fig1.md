caption: 'Canonical miRNA biogenesis pathway and the mechanisms of dysregulation.
  MiRNA is processed sequentially by the transcription of primary transcript (pri-miRNA)
  of miRNA gene or gene containing pri-miRNA sequence (intronic miRNAs), nuclear processing
  of pri-miRNA by microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) complex, and cytoplasmic maturation
  of pre-miRNA by Dicer complex. One of the strands of miRNA duplex is then loaded
  into AGO2-containing miRNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) forming functional miRISC
  to regulate sequence-specific target inhibition. Green arrows: RNase-dependent processing
  steps.'
