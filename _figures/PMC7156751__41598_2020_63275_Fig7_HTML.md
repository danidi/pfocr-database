caption: Schematic overview of a simplified tumor environment model. Melanoma, Macrophage,
  and Fibroblast (stroma) are possibly the main cells interacting through cytokines,
  exosomes, and other signaling proteins. Herein, we postulate that some Melanoma
  cells enter in ER-stress state because Amblyomin-X was internalized, next mitochondria
  stress and cytoskeleton remodeling occur, and finally, apoptosis and survival duel
  are the final outcomes. Concomitant, IIS pathways are activated in melanoma cells,
  first by the RLR responses, possibly sensing RNA molecules originating from fibroblast
  exosomes or being transcribed from endogenous retroviral elements. IFN type I and
  NOXA transcriptions were not seen, but many cytokines (IL1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL12, IP10,
  and TNF-α) were DEGs, and their proteins were likely to have been produced and released
  to extracellular medium. Many macrophage signaling pathways were enriched, and their
  transcribed cytokines are IL1β, IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL10 (IP10), and TNF-α,
  all DEGs. Possibly the production of some of these proteins results in M1 and M2
  polarization, since STAT1, STAT3, and SOCS3 were also DEGs. These macrophage cytokine
  releases should lead to many processes, including a crosstalk to Fibroblast, but
  mainly, the feedback to RLR pathway and the inflammatory response, see text. All
  these inferences were made according to Metacore algorithms, references, and database.
