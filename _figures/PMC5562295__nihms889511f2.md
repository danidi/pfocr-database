caption: The aromatic amino acid (AAA) biosynthetic pathway of plants and microorganisms
  is tightly regulated. The many regulated enzymes (black dotted lines) all share
  a common trait in that they are located at junction points within the pathway. All
  three AAAs originate from chorismate, synthesized via the shikimate pathway (blue).
  Phenylalanine and tyrosine are then formed from a branching pathway that begins
  with chorismate mutase (orange), while tryptophan is synthesized from a pathway
  beginning with anthranilate synthase (green).
