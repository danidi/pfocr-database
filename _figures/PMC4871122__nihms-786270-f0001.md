caption: Copper is reduced from Cu2+ to Cu+ by a putative cell-surface reductase.
  It is then transported across the plasma membrane by a heteroprotein complex formed
  by the Ctr4 and Ctr5 proteins. There is a mutual dependence between Ctr4 and Ctr5
  because trafficking of either protein to the cell surface requires concomitant trafficking
  of its partner. Results obtained in yeasts S. pombe and S. cerevisiae, in addition
  to comparison of sequence homology with S. cerevisiae chaperones, suggest that copper
  chaperones in fission yeast include Atx1, Pccs and Cox17. Atx1 carries copper to
  Ccc2, a P-type ATPase in the Golgi membrane that pumps copper into the secretory
  pathway where it can be incorporated into newly synthesized copper proteins. Atx1
  is also involved in the delivery of copper to Cao1. In the mitochondrion, Cox17
  delivers copper to Cco via Sco1 and presumably Cox1101. Pccs shuttles copper to
  Sod1 in the cytosol. When the pool of cytoplasmic copper is depleted, Ctr6 participates
  in copper efflux from the vacuole, providing copper to cytosolic copper-dependent
  enzymes. In response to copper deficiency, Cuf1 is localized in the nucleus where
  it binds to CuSEs and activates transport of copper by inducing expression of ctr4+,
  ctr5+ and ctr6+ genes. In contrast, in cells undergoing a shift from low to sufficient
  copper concentrations, Cuf1 translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Brown,
