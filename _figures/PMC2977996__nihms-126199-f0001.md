caption: ssDNA and RPA act as a ligand for activation of the ATR-CHK1 checkpoint pathway.
  The figure shows a schematic of the steps required for ATR checkpoint activation.
  First, resection of the DSB generates ssDNA with a 3′ overhang. RPA rapidly coats
  the ssDNA tail and removes secondary structure. This nucleoprotein filament is recognized,
  independently, by ATR/ATRIP and by Rad17-RFC. The latter loads the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1
  complex onto ssDNA/RPA. Whether the 9-1-1 complex slides along dsDNA or along ssDNA/RPA
  is not yet proven. ATR is activated by binding to ssDNA and phosphorylates the C-terminus
  of Rad9. Together, ATR/ATRIP and the 9-1-1 complex synergize to generate maximal
  activation of CHK1. This may be facilitated by Claspin, Cut5 (not shown) and possibly
  other mediators not yet identified. ATR and/or CHK1 deliver the DNA damage response
  signal to downstream targets (not shown)
