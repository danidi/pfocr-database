caption: 'Overview of the potential Ngb neuroprotective mechanisms in neurons. The
  schematic presentation is a magnification of the boxed area in a neuron. Ngb is
  detected to detoxify harmful excesses of NO and to scavenge ROS and RNS amongst
  others by its association witch Cyt c1. Mitochondrial translocation suggested by
  the latter is exerted by HTT. Ngb has a guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor
  (GDI) activity and can prevent Gα from binding to the Gβγ complex, which promotes
  neuronal survival. Ngb also may inhibit the dissociation of RAC-1 from its endogenous
  GDI, preventing actin polymerisation and microdomain aggregation. Furthermore, Ngb
  might inhibit opening of mPTP pores of mitochondria and subsequent Cyt c (Fe3+)
  release. Ngb also converts apoptotic Cyt c (Fe3+) to Cyt c (Fe2+). Furthermore,
  Ngb might modulate the AKT/IP3 signalling pathway and associate with Na+/K+ ATPase
  in order to promote neuroprotection. Lastly, while Ngb is able to bind oxygen, its
  oxygen affinity value only attains 7.5 Torr. Given this value to be lower than the
  O2 tension within neurons, it is unlikely that Ngb exerts a respiratory function
  under basal conditions. Potentially harmful species are indicated in dark pink and
  converted nonharmful species in light pink. Ngb: neuroglobin; ROS: reactive oxygen
  species; RNS: reactive nitrogen species; ETC: electron transport chain; GDI: guanosine
  nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; Cyt c: cytochrome c; mPTP: mitochondrial permeability
  transition pore; GDP: guanosine diphosphate; RAC-1: ras-related C3 botulinum toxin
