caption: Coordinated PLD activity that matches substrate output to adhesion progression.
  The key events are as follows. a, adhesion of macrophages to collagen-covered plates
  activates both PLD1 and PLD2; in turn, these phospholipases regulate adhesion in
  a spatio-temporal way, leading to a prolonged and sustained cellular function. b,
  nascent adhesion (at ∼5 min) and established (at ∼15 min) adhesions were enhanced
  by PLD1 and PLD2, respectively. c, phosphatidic acid, a lipid second messenger,
  bound specifically to the Arp2/3 component Arp3. d, PA-Arp3 binding led to activation
  of Arp and subsequent actin polymerization and cell adhesion both in vitro and in
  vivo. PLD1 activation upon adhesion of macrophages onto collagen-coated surface
  results in PA synthesis, which directly binds and activates Arp3 and subsequent
  actin polymerization. PLD2 is activated at slightly later times, albeit in a prolonged
  manner that sustains adhesion and membrane ruffle formation. We conclude that the
  initial activation of PLD by collagen occurs as a result of nascent adhesion, and
  then a PA-Arp3-actin pathway increases focal adhesion in mature or established adhesions.
