caption: A detailed schematic of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway as related to
  flower pigmentation in the four different cultivars of P. vulgaris. Enzyme names
  and expression patterns are listed at each step. The expression level of each gene
  in each sample was averaged from three biological replicates of transcriptome sequencing.
  The color scale represents log2-transformed fold change values. Black indicates
  no change, green indicates downregulation, and red indicates upregulation. WL, HL,
  BS, and BO represent “White Lover,” “Huang Li,” “Beautiful Scenery,” and “Blue Onstar,”
  respectively.
