caption: The hypothalamic preoptic area (POA) contains temperature-sensitive neurons
  that are primarily GABAergic and elicit inhibitory effects on neurons in the dorsomedial
  hypothalamus (DMH). DMH neurons innervate sympathetic premotor neurons glutamatergically
  in the RMR that modulate sympathetic nervous system (SNS) stimulation of BAT thermogenesis.
  Cold exposure or pyrogenic infection causes decreased GABAergic signaling from the
  POA to the DMH. The resulting disinhibition (excitation) of neurons in the DMH promotes
  RMR neuronal activity, which increases sympathetic nervous activity to BAT, leading
  to increased BAT thermogenesis and body temperature. Psychological stress causes
  neuronal activation in the DMH via a yet to be identified neural signaling pathway(s),
  and such activation promotes BAT thermogenesis though increasing the RMR-SNS-BAT
  activity.
