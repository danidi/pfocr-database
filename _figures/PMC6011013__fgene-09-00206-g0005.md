caption: 'Integration of mRNA data and CNAs profiles: BMD+DAD-screening network using
  Coxnet (top) and ADMMnet (bottom) methods with mRNA expression data and the integration
  of mRNA data and CNAs profiles. Non isolated genes are represented as nodes in the
  network, then a link a drawn between two (adjacent) genes when the two genes belong
  to the same KEGG pathway. We use different colors for KEGG pathways and three colors
  to identify the type gene: orange color for genes-HEFaIMp-high, green color for
  genes-HEFaIMp-low, purple color for genes-no-HEFaIMp. Triangular-shaped nodes indicate
  the genes identified in literature as breast-cancer associated genes. The number
  of papers is also reported in the triangular nodes.'
