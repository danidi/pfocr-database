caption: Individuals with different genotypes of MDM2 SNP309 could be affected differently
  by estrogen signaling manipulation. A model has been proposed that the primarily
  female-specific hormone, estrogen, preferentially stimulated transcription of the
  MDM2 gene with the G-allele of SNP309, potentially through the direct interaction
  of the estrogen receptor (ESR) and the transcription factor SP1 on the MDM2 promoter.
  If true, this predicts that inhibition of estrogen signaling in individuals with
  the G-allele of MDM2 SNP309 would lead to a reduction of MDM2 levels and a reactivation
  of p53 activity, allowing for either better tumor suppression or tumor clearance
  compared with individuals with the T-allele.
