caption: Differentiated hepatocytes use the reversal glucose transporter, GLUT2, for
  the uptake and export of glucose. The first committed step in glucose metabolism
  is attenuated because it is catalysed by the low-affinity hexokinase, HK4 (also
  known as glucokinase). The three committed steps in glucose metabolism could be
  reversed by the gluconeogenic enzymes (dark red). Glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase)
  dephosphorylates glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) back to glucose. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase
  (FBP1) dephosphorylates fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F1,6BP) back to fructose-6-phosphate
  (F6P) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) reverses the last committed
  step in glycolysis by converting oxaloacetate (OAA) to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP),
  both in the mitochondria by the mitochondrial enzyme, PEPCK-M, and in the cytoplasm
  by PEPCK-C. In hepatocellular carcinoma the suppression of HK4 expression and the
  induction of the high-affinity hexokinase HK2 and by suppressing the expression
  of gluconeogenic (HCC), glucose metabolism is accelerated by the expression of GLUT1,
  enzymes. Unlike differentiated hepatocytes, HCC cells express relatively high levels
  of aldolase A (ALDOA), they express pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) instead of PKL, and
  they elevate the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA; shown in bold). The
  thickness of the arrows indicates relative flux. 1,3BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate;
