caption: Model of the regulation of miR-203 and IFIT1/ISG56 during Sendai virus infection.
  Cells infected with Sendai virus generate an antiviral response by producing type
  I IFN, which signals through the JAK-STAT-ISGF3 pathway to induce IFN-stimulated
  gene products including IFIT1/ISG56, miR-203, and IFN regulatory factors (IRFs).
  Both IFN production and IRF induction are sensitive to treatment with CHX. miR-203
  can be induced by IFN initially by preexisting proteins, but sustained miR-203 expression
  requires newly synthesized signaling proteins, potentially, but not limited to,
  IRF family members (IRF?). miR-203 accumulation functions to destabilize IFIT1/ISG56
  mRNA and regulate its translation. See the text for more details of the model.
