caption: 'Hcy metabolic pathways. Hcy resides at the intersections of re-methylation
  and trans-sulfuration pathways. In the re-methylation pathway, tetrahydrofolate
  (THF) is converted to methyl (CH3) THF by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).
  The methyl group is donated to Hcy, and in the presence of methionine synthase (MS),
  and B12, it is converted to Met. Met is used further in many methyl transfer reactions.
  When the diet is replete with Met, Hcy is converted via trans-sulfuration pathway
  to cystathionine by cystathionine β synthase (CBS), and then again to cysteine via
  the action of cystathionase (CSE) in the presence of B6. Finally, cysteine is converted
  to several beneficial downstream products such as glutathione (GSH), and taurine
  which are essential for brain, and retinal functions. Abbreviations: SAHH; S-adenosyl
  homocysteine hydrolase, SAH; S-adenosyl homocysteine, R; represents a carbon-based
  group, DNA; deoxyribonucleic acid, RNA; deoxyribonucleic acid.'
