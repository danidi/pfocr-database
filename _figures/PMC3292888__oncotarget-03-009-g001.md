caption: miRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The resulting
  long transcript is capped with a specially-modified nucleotide at the 5' end, polyadenylated
  with multiple adenosines and spliced. The product is called primary miRNA (Pri-miRNA).
  Drosha crops Pri-miRNA into precursor-miRNA (Pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNA hairpins are
  exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5. In the cytoplasm, the
  pre-miRNA hairpin is cleaved by the RNase III enzyme Dicer. One strand is taken
  into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where the miRNA and its target interact.
  miRNAs that bind to mRNA targets with perfect matching induce mRNA cleavage, whereas
  translational repression is induced when matching is imperfect.
