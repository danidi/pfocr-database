caption: The innate immune response and adaptive immune responses of Coronaviruses
  (CoV) infection during an infection. A, CoV infects macrophages, and then macrophages
  present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation,
  including the production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets
  (ie, Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response amplification.
  The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative
  effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However, CD8 T cells produce very effective
  mediators to clear CoV. B, Attachment of CoV to DPP4R on the host cell through S
  protein leads to the appearance of genomic RNA in the cytoplasm. An immune response
  to dsRNA can be partially generated during CoV replication. TLR‐3 sensitized by
  dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NF‐κB activation, respectively)
  are activated to produce type I IFNs and proinflammatory cytokines. The production
  of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the
  protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes, accessory proteins of CoV can interfere
  with TLR‐3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR‐3
  activation and evade the immune response. TLR‐4 might recognize S protein and lead
  to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines through the MyD88‐dependent signaling
  pathway. Virus‐cell interactions lead to the strong production of immune mediators.
  The secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines (IL‐1, IL‐6, IL‐8,
  IL‐21, TNF‐β, and MCP‐1) is promoted in infected cells in response to CoV infection.
  These chemokines and cytokines, in turn, recruit lymphocytes and leukocytes to the
  site of infection. Red lines refer to inhibitory effects. Green lines refer to activating
  effects
