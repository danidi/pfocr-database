caption: Left, Gpr161 localizes to primary cilia in a Tulp3/IFT-A-dependent manner
  []. Constitutive activity of Gpr161 leads to increase in cAMP levels in a Gαs-coupled
  manner. Gαs also functions as a negative regulator of Hh signaling in the neural
  tube []. Currently, ligands that could modulate Gpr161 activity are unknown. Gpr161
  activity in cilia could increase ciliary cAMP pools, resulting in PKA activity in
  close proximity in the basal body [], promoting Gli3 processing. Right, Shh activity
  removes Gpr161 from cilia [], possibly preventing ciliary activation of PKA. Other
  factors that modulate Shh-mediated activity include activity of PACAP receptor,
  PAC1 that can affect global PKA activity in the cerebellar granular progenitor neurons
  [], and atypical protein kinase C τ/λ (aPKC-τ/λ) that functions in a positive feedback
  circuit to phosphorylate and activate Gli1 in the context of basal cell carcinoma
  [].
