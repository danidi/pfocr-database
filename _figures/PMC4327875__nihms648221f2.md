caption: TGF-β1 ligand-binding initiates signaling events resulting in the activation
  of SMAD2/3/4 (canonical pathway). In a collateral (non-canonical) pathway, TGF-β
  utilizes the p47phox and p22phox-dependent NADPH oxidases to generate ROS necessary
  for ATM activation as well as its downstream substrate p53. p53 and SMAD, in turn,
  form a complex that binds to TGF-β target gene promoters (e.g., PAI-1), likely in
  cooperation with members of the upstream stimulatory factor family (e.g., USF2)
  of helix-loop-helix transcription factors to stimulate optimal gene expression.
  Other ROS-dependent non-SMAD elements, including c-src/EGFR/MAPK, function to recruit
  additional transcriptional elements as part of a highly-interactive canonical and
  non-canonical expression control network [adapted from 6].
