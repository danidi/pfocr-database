caption: Schematic of the PLD–PA impact on hormone signalling pathways in plant defence.
  Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from virulent pathogens are recognized
  by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are usually plasma membrane-localized
  receptor kinases such as FLS2/BRI1, to initiate plant defence responses. FLS2/BRI1
  form complex with receptor kinases such as BAK1 and BIK1 to transduce the PAMP signals
  to downstream signalling components such as transcription factor BZR1 and actin
  cytoskeleton dynamics. PLDζ-derived PA binds to PP2A or BZR1 to regulate FLS2/BRI1–BAK1–BIK1
  complex activity by dephosphorylation of the proteins. PLDζ–PA regulates both brassinosteroid
  (BR) hormone and PAMP signal perception and downstream BR signalling or plant immunity
  through the PA target BZR1. Pathogens also secret different effectors into the plant
  cell, where they are recognized by nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat resistance
  (R) proteins, to modify plant defence responses. Upon infection, PLDs (PLDα, -β,
  -γ, -δ, or -ζ) may be activated and translocated to the different membranes in different
  subcellular compartments to generate PA species with various acyl chains, which
  may impact on salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), abscisic acid (ABA), auxin,
  BR, and gibberellin (GA) signalling. PLDα1–PA regulates ABI1 activity to affect
  ABA signalling; PLDα1-PA may bind and activate NADPH oxidase or MPK6 to produce
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), and impact on JA and SA signalling. PLD-derived PA
  binds to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized ethylene (ET) receptor CTR1 to regulate
  ET signalling. PLDδ–PA interacts with cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases
  (GAPCs) to regulate ROS and to affect lipid metabolism and hormone signalling. PLDα–PA
  in the tonoplast interacts with SPHK and promotes the phytosphingosine-1-phosphate
  (phyto-1P)-mediated ABA signalling pathway and activates Ca2+ ion channel activity.
  PA in the chloroplast may be generated by PLDβ to affect JA and SA biosynthesis.
  PA participates in the synthesis of plastidic galactolipids, which can be modified
  by FAD6, FAD7, and FAD8 and then hydrolysed by phospholipase A (PLA) to generate
  C18:1. C18:2, and C18:3 to initiate JA- or SA-dependent or independent signalling
  for plant defence. Lysophospholipid (lysoPC) may activate the vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter
  to induce cytoplasmic alkalinization and to activate defence responses. The interactions
  of PLA→lysophospholipids→PLD→PA→PLA may form a regulatory cycle regulating JA/oxylipin
  signalling and other plant defence responses. PLD–PA signalling complexes thus modify
  plant hormone signalling and plant defence responses. These plant hormones regulate
  both plant growth and development and plant immunity in defence against pathogens.

    The interactions of PLA→lysophospholipids→PLD→PA→PLA may form a regulatory cycle

    complexes thus modify plant hormone signalling and plant defence responses. These
