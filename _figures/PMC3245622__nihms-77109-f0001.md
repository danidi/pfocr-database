caption: The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved in several human cancers. When
  bound, growth factor (GF) receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) recruit PI3K, a heterodimer
  with both a regulatory p85 and a catalytic p110 subunit. PI3K phosphorylates PIP2
  creating PIP3, which then activates Akt. Once phosphorylated by PIP3, Akt affects
  many cellular processes either directly (dark lines) or indirectly (dashed lines)
  through the regulation of downstream mediators. By inhibiting proteins that promote
  apoptosis, such as p53, Bad, and the FOXO family of forkhead transcription factors,
  Akt furthers cell survival. Akt also regulates survival by stimulating pro-survival
  proteins like NF-κB. Indirect activation of the mTOR pathway by Akt increases protein
  synthesis and cell growth, while the triggering of eNOS overexpression is thought
  to contribute to tumor angiogenesis. In addition, Akt is indirectly involved in
  the control of cell cycle progression through interactions with FOXO transcription
  factors, GSK3, Myc, and subsequent effects on cyclin D1 and p27KIP1 (not depicted).
