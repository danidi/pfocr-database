caption: Functions of mono-ADP-ribosylating ARTD (ADP-ribosyltransferase diphtheria
  toxin-like) enzymes and of mono-ADP-ribosylating Sirtuins in signaling. Nuclear
  functions have been reported for ARTD8, ARTD9, ARTD10, ARTD14 and for SIRT6. ARTD8
  has been described to regulate Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription
  (STAT) 6-dependent gene expression, whereas ARTD8 and ARTD9 influence STAT1-dependent
  gene expression. Besides regulating STAT transcription factors, ARTD8 as well as
  ARTD10 and SIRT6 have been linked to DNA damage repair. ARTD14 interferes with AHR/ARNT
  (aryl hydrocarbon receptor/AHR nuclear translocator) driven gene expression. Moreover,
  SIRT6 regulates retrotransposon silencing. ARTD15 is localized to either the nuclear
  envelope where it influences nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling or to the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) where it controls the unfolded protein response by modification of
  IRE1α (inositol requiring enzyme 1) and PERK (protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase).
  ARTD7, ARTD8 and ARTD12 are associated with stress granule formation. In addition,
  ARTD12 localizes to the autophagy receptor p62 and might be a player in the regulation
  of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Similarly, ARTD10 co-localizes with p62 in an ubiquitin-dependent
  manner and represses NF-κB signaling. ARTD10, ARTD12 and ARTD14 have been suggested
  to inhibit translation as well as viral replication. SIRT4 is localized to mitochondria
  and regulates glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity and glutamine metabolism. For
  more details see the text.
