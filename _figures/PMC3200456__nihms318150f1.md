caption: '(1) Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are activated upon recognition of pathogen
  associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The main TLR ligand identified in T. gondii
  is a parasite profilin-like protein (TgPRF) that can bind to and activate TLR11
  [, ]. Toxoplasma is also armed with molecules of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors
  (GPI) and glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPLs) that can be recognized by TLR2 and
  TLR4 []. (2) TLR engagement triggers MyD88-dependent signaling pathways that culminate
  with the activation of NF-kB. However, T. gondii strains that express the active
  form of the dense granule protein GRA15 are able to directly activate NF-κB through
  a MyD88-independent mechanism. (3) NF-κB activation leads to transcription of a
  series of pro-inflammatory genes, including genes for IL-1β, IL-12, IL-18, induced
  nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and some NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Nevertheless, parasite
  ROP16 is able to suppress the IL-12 response of infected macrophages stimulated
  with the TLR agonists [] and to inhibit NF-κB transcriptional activity [], possibly
  due to its ability to phosphorylate and activate STAT3/6 [], which dampens TLR-induced
  cytokine production. Parasite induced MAPK signaling pathways also modulate IL-12
  production [], and there is evidence that T. gondii ROP38 may regulate MAPK function
  []. (4) Binding of ATP to the purinergic receptor P2X7 and the subsequent efflux
  of intracellular K+ leads to activation of the inflammasome [, ]. Although it is
  not known if Toxoplasma infection affects P2X7R function, the parasite secretes
  nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases (NTPases) that could possibly control extracellular
  levels of ATP. (5) Inflammasome stimulation activates caspase-1, which cleaves the
  proforms of IL-1β and IL-18 generating bioactive cytokines. Both IL-1β and IL-18
  receptors activate NF-κB and MAPK signaling and subsequent pro-inflammatory cytokine
  production. Toxoplasma is known to induce IL-1β and IL-18 secretion, both of which
  serve to amplify IFNγ production by NK cells [, ]. It remains to be elucidated if
  the parasite can directly activate the inflammasome or modulate caspase-1 activity.
  (6) IFNγ binding to its receptor triggers the JAK/STAT pathway, leading to phosphorylation
  of STAT1. Phosphorylated STAT1 then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus, leading
  to transcription of interferon-stimulated genes, including the transcription factor
  IRF1, class II MHC and interferon regulated GTPases (IRGs). Yet, Toxoplasma infected
  cells display a marked inhibition of STAT1 dependent transcription [], and parasite
  secreted kinase ROP18 can phosphorylate and inactivate IRGs (7), preventing their
  accumulation on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and protecting the parasite
  from IRG-dependent intracellular killing [, ]. Abbreviations: IRF1, interferon regulatory
  factor 1; JAK, Janus kinases; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; STAT, signal
  transducer and activator of transcription; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
