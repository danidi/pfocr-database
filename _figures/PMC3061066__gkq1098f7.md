caption: Model demonstrating the possible mode of action of hSSB1. Our data suggests
  hSSB1 functions at the ‘top’ of the DNA DSB response pathway in mammalian cells.
  hSSB1 is required to recruit the MRN complex to small regions of ssDNA or naturally
  breathing DNA at broken DNA ends to initiate signalling and repair of DSBs.
pmcid: PMC3061066
papertitle: hSSB1 rapidly binds at the sites of DNA double-strand breaks and is required
  for the efficient recruitment of the MRN complex.
