caption: Generic transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) family signaling pathway through
  Smads compared with the Caenorhabditis elegans dauer pathway and the C. elegans
  Sma/Mab pathway. (A) The classic TGF-β signaling pathway. (B) The dauer pathway.
  Note that DAF-3, the co-Smad, negatively regulates the pathway and may reside in
  the nucleus rather than being transported with the R-Smads. DAF-5 is the SnoN/c-Ski
  ortholog and has only been shown to function in the dauer pathway and not in the
  Sma/Mab pathway. The inhibitory Smad (I-Smad) TAG-68 is noted with a question mark,
  as its role in the dauer pathway is not clearly established. (C) The Sma/Mab pathway.
  The two R-Smads, SMA-2 and SMA-3, associate with SMA-4, the co-Smad, and translocate
  to the nucleus. One characterized transcription factor, Schnurri, aids in transcription
  of downstream target genes. The I-Smad TAG-68 is noted with a question mark for
  the Sma/Mab pathway as well, as its role in this pathway is not clearly established.
