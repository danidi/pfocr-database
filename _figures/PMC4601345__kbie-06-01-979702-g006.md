caption: 'A plausible biosynthetic pathway leading to formation of phytol in N. punctiforme.
  In the above diagram enzymes I, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 shown in green are potential
  native enzymes: IPP isomerase (enzyme I) geranyl diphosphate (GDP) synthase (enzyme
  1); farnesyl diphosphate (FDP) synthase (enzyme 2); geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP)
  synthase (enzyme 4); pyrophosphatases (enzyme 5); geranylgeranyl reductase (GGR)
  (enzyme 6) and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) reductase (enzyme 7). Enzyme 3 is the foreign
  MBO synthase. GDP synthase, FDP synthase and GGDP synthase shown in gray as 1*,
  2* and 4* respectively, are bacterial class I prenyltransferases with proposed broad
  range substrates specificity. Solid black arrow represents already known or proposed
  pathways while gray arrows show plausible reactions proposed in this model. Structures
  are adopted from NCBI pubchem compound library (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).'
