caption: 'Mitotic removal of cohesin in humans: In humans, cohesins (pink) are removed
  from chromosome arms in prophase in a Plk1-dependent pathway. The residual cohesins
  from the centromeric regions are removed and the sisters separate when Separase
  cleaves the cohesin component Rad21 (green in the inset cartoon). During metaphase-to-anaphase
  transition, APC/C-Cdc20 is activated, and ubiquitinates and degrades securin (red)—the
  inhibitory chaperone of Separase. The active Separase (green) thus released cleaves
  Rad21 to disentangle the cohesin handcuff (pink) to separate the sisters (blue).'
