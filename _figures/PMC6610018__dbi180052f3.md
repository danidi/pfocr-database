caption: The interplay between the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway with mTORC1 signaling.
  Knockout of three-prime repair exonuclease 1 (Trex1), which degrades DNA in the
  cytosol, leads to the activation of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway and suppression
  of the mTORC1 activity in mice. The cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway may inhibit mTORC1
  activity through a TBK1-dependent mechanism. Conversely, the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway
  may be inhibited by mTORC1-dependent suppression of STING activity and IRF3 translocation
  or by mTORC2-mediated cGAS degradation. Of note, the kinase domain but not the kinase
  function of ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) is essential for S6K to interact
  with STING, which facilitates TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of STING and recruitment
  of IRF3 for antiviral immune responses.
