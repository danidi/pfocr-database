caption: A model of signaling pathway whereby hippocampal nNOS mediates stress-related
  depressive behaviors of glucocorticoids. Stress-induced glucocorticoids release,
  acting via MR, stimulates hippocampal nNOS expression and, in turn, leads to GR
  downregulation by cGMP-dependent and cGMP-independent mechanisms. This modification
  causes CRF upregulation in the hypothalamus, thereby modulating stress-related depressive
  behaviors.
