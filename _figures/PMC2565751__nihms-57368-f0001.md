caption: Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), the most common acute porphyria, results
  from the reduced activity of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD). PBGD is
  the third enzyme in heme biosynthesis and catalyzes the stepwise condensation of
  four molecules of porphobilinogen (PBG) to form hydroxymethylbilane (HMB, ). HMB
  can be converted to uroporphyrinogen III by intramolecular rearrangement and ring
  closure by the fourth enzyme, uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS). An alternative
  pathway is spontaneous cyclization of HMB to uroporphyrinogen I, which becomes significant
  when UROS is deficient. Uroporphyrinogen III and uroporphyrinogen I can be further
  converted to other intermediates by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) in the
  cycle of heme biosynthesis.
