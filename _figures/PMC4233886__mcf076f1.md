caption: Fig. 1. Variable outcomes of cross‐talk between ISR (induced systemic resistance)
  and IRH (induced resistance against herbivores) signalling. A, Overview of interactions.
  On the level of elicitation and production several ‘common factors’ (in green boxes)
  appear in both signalling pathways (necrosis, cell wall fragments and oxidative
  burst during elicitation; phenolics and PR proteins on the production level) and
  might represent factors leading to cross‐resistance phenomena. B, Elicitation by
  a herbivore. While inducing mainly the octadecanoid pathway, the ‘common’ elicitors
  might lead to partial induction of ISR signalling. Resources are mainly allocated
  to herbivore resistance, but some resistance against pathogens is expressed, too.
  C, Elicitation by a pathogen. The partial induction of the octadecanoid pathway
  by the ‘common’ elicitors might lead to the occurrence of some early metabolites
  such as OPDA, but later, the pathway is blocked by the inhibitory effects of SA.
  On the phenotypic level, only resistance against pathogens is expressed. D, Exogenous
  elicitation bypasses regulatory mechanisms on the elicitation and the signalling
  level. The competition between both pathways for limiting resources therefore dominates
  the outcome and leads to phenotypically visible trade‐offs when both pathways are
  induced at the same time. See text for further details.
