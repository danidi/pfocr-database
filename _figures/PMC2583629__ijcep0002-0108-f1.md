caption: 'The role of caspases in promoting the pathology associated with AD. This
  figure summarizes the contribution of caspases to the Aβ cascade hypothesis. Step
  1: activation of caspases occurs through stimulation of either the receptor-mediated
  pathway of apoptosis involving cross-linking of death receptors by Aβ (i.e., Fas),
  through the mitochondrial-mediated Aβ-induced oxidative stress, or finally by ER
  stress. Step 2: Following the activation of executioner caspases, particularly caspase-3,
  c-terminal cleavage of APP may facilitate the production of Aβ. This in turn can
  create a vicious feed-forward cycle of Aβ production and caspase-3 activation. Bcl-2
  is an anti-apoptotic protein expressed in mitochondria, which prevents the release
  of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic factors, thus preventing caspase-9 and caspase-3
  activation through an interaction with Apaf-1. Step 3: Conversely, caspase-3 cleavage
  of tau may promote tau aggregation and PHF formation thereby linking Aβ to NFTs.
  Step 4: Promotion of pathology by the activation of caspases occurs not only through
  the production of NFTs, but also by leading to Aβ deposition and plaque formation.
  Step 5: Ultimately, the activation of caspases and cleavage of critical cellular
  proteins may disrupt axonal and dendritic transport processes leading to cell death
  and neurodegeneration. Adapted and reproduced by permission from Dickson [].'
