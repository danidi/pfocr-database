caption: Citrate metabolic pathway in resting cells of Lb. casei ATCC 334. The metabolic
  scheme is based on the product profile obtained when resting cells of Lb. casei
  were allowed to convert 2 mM citrate in the presence of Ca2+ (). Indicated are the
  relative fluxes through the different parts of the scheme following pyruvate. Note
  the formation of acetate from citrate in the citrate lyase reaction. CT, citrate
  transporter; CL, citrate lyase; OAD, membrane-bound oxaloacetate decarboxylase;
  ALS, α-acetolactate synthase; ALD, α-acetolactate decarboxylase; ACP, acetylphosphatase;
  POX, pyruvate oxidase.
