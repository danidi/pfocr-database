caption: Metabolism of proliferating cells. Proliferating cells require glucose which
  is converted to pyruvate through glycolysis. Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA
  which enters the Krebs (TCA) cycle in the form of citrate. Alternatively, citrate
  is exported back to the cytosol to be used for lipid synthesis. Glucose can be also
  used as a source of carbon to produce ribose through the pentose phosphate pathway.
  Ribose-5-phosphate is then used to make RNA and DNA. Moreover, glycolytic intermediates
  such as pyruvate are used to produce non-essential amino acids such as alanine.
  Cells also require amino acids such as glutamine to make other amino acids and proteins.
  ‘Waste' is secreted in the form of lactate (mostly from glycolysis) and ammonia
  (from catabolism to amino acids)
