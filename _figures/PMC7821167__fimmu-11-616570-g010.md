caption: Schematic presentation of the functional effects of ADV on T cells. (A) ADV
  inhibits proliferation in freshly stimulated and pre-activated T cells. Inhibition
  of proliferation was associated with a decrease in the expression of activation
  markers and reduced IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-17, and IL-10 secretion. Additionally, DNA damage,
  cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis was observed. (B) ADV treatment induced
  DNA double-strand breaks (γH2AX foci expression), which led to an increase of p53-phospho-Ser15
  expression. In response to DNA damage p21 and PUMA are transactivated by p53. Subsequently,
  this caused cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and activation of the intrinsic apoptosis
  pathway.
