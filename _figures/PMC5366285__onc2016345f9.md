caption: Cartoon illustrating a novel signaling pathway for the coordinated regulation
  of Rho and Rac signaling in epithelial invasion. In this pathway, Rho-dependent
  activation of ROCK targets GIT2 to FAs, where GIT2 suppresses the activity of a
  Crk-p130Cas-DOCK5 signaling pathway required for activation of Rac and mammary epithelial
  cell invasion. The Crk-p130Cas-DOCK5 signaling pathway has non-redundant and essential
  role in epithelial invasion and metastasis, underscoring the need for tight regulation
  of this pathway by GIT2 in non-transformed cells.
