caption: Provides a schematic and abbreviated overview of the TGFβ signaling pathway
  with indication of aneurismal diseases linked to it. The TGFβ pathway and related
  vasculopathies. Following its release from the Extrcellular Matrix, TGFβ binds to
  its type II cell surface receptor (TβRII), which recruits and phosphorylates the
  type I receptor (TβRI). TβRI then recruits and phosphorylates SMAD2 and/or SMAD3.
  These P-SMADs then bind to the common SMAD (co-SMAD) SMAD4 to form a heterodimeric
  complex. This complex enters the cell nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor
  for various TGFβ-dependent genes, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF),
  plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and multiple collagens.
