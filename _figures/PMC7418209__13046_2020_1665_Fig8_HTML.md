caption: Carbonyl stress in PaC promotion induced by diabetes and mechanism of FL-926-16-mediated
  protection. Diabetes markedly accelerates tumour progression through hyperglycaemia-derived
  carbonyl stress. The increased availability of glucose feeds the glycolytic flux
  of tumour cells favouring local formation of RCS such as MGO, an inevitable side-product
  of glycolysis, and consequent AGE accumulation. In addition, circulating RCS and
  their protein adducts (i.e., AGEs) derived from non-enzymatic glycoxidation reactions
  occurring at the systemic level may also contribute to AGE accumulation in neoplastic
  lesions, which is associated with increased nuclear translocation of YAP, a key
  effector of Hippo pathway and regulator of tumour growth and invasion [, , , ].
  Quenching of RCS and inhibition of AGE formation by the RCS sequestering agent FL-926-16
  efficiently prevents hyperglycaemia-induced YAP activation and acceleration of PanIN
  progression to invasive PaC. LATS1 = large tumour suppressor kinase 1; ERK = extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; p-EGFR = phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor;
  p-YAP = phosphorylated YAP
