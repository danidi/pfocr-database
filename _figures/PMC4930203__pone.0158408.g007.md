caption: Leptin derived from adipocytes regulates tube formation through controlling
  proliferation of HDLECs. Although leptin activates the STAT3 signaling pathway,
  which is downstream signaling of Ob-R, at an early time point, STAT3 phosphorylation
  is not increased at a late time point when SOCS3 proteins are increased by leptin.
  As a result, proliferation of HDLECs is decreased, leading to inhibition of tube
  formation. Additionally, SOCS3 induced by leptin is under the regulation of STAT3.
  Leptin also enhanced expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 in HDLECs.
  IL-6 rescues the compromised proliferation and tube formation caused by leptin in
  an autocrine or paracrine manner.
