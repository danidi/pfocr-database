caption: RsaE accumulation downregulates specific metabolic pathways. The metabolic
  charts are adapted from the Kegg database (). Enzymes corresponding to downregulated
  genes by RsaE are indicated by square boxes highlighted in grey [FolD [SA0915] indicated
  on the figure was not found in this study, but was previously reported ()]; metabolites
  are shown as open circles; biochemical reactions that are demonstrated or predicted
  in N315 by arrows, respectively. The outer pathway is the TCA cycle. The inner pathway
  is the THF biosynthesis pathway. In certain organisms, these two pathways are connected
  via the glyoxylate shunt, which leads to a modified version of the TCA cycle that
  bypasses certain steps. However, connecting enzymes in N315 are not yet known.
