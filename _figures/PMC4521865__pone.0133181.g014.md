caption: Illustration of how an SM-initiated signal transduction pathway leads to
  SREBP modulation. Two cell models of membrane SM enrichment were investigated in
  this report (1) by adding exogenous sphingomyelins in the culture medium of differentiated
  cells or (2) by inhibiting N-SMase with GW4869 or GSH. In turn, SM contents increase
  in membranes (caveolae). Membrane SM accumulation promotes a rigid state of the
  membrane and caveolin accumulation and regulates the Ras-Raf-ERK MAP kinase pathway,
  inhibiting SREBP-1. By inhibiting KSR, which is the putative target of ceramide,
  SM acts to amplify the signal provided to the Raf/ERK MAP kinase cascade. In turn,
  by affecting SREBP-1, SM induces SREBP-2. The increased levels of SREBP-2 are consistent
  with increased CHOL synthesis. In SM-enriched adipocytes, a higher amount of CHOL
  is required to maintain raft and caveolae assembly. Caveolin transports the neo-synthesized
  CHOL toward the cell surface, thus increasing the caveolin-2 levels in the plasma
  membrane. In SM-depleted cells, the opposite mechanism could be effective.
