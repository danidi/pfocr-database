caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the RAS-MAPK signal transduction pathway. Receptor
  tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are the high-affinity cell surface receptors for many polypeptide
  growth factors, cytokines, and hormones. SHP2 is a ubiquitous protein-tyrosine phosphatase
  (PTP) which plays major biological functions in response to various growth factors,
  hormones or cytokines. Activation of SHP2 occurs upon interaction of phosphotyrosine
  residues from substrate or another protein with SH2 domains in these PTPs, promoting
  GRB2/SOS recruitment through direct binding to GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound
  protein 2). GRB2 binds through its SH3 domains to the guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor (SOS), activating it. Activated SOS then promotes the removal of GDP from
  a member of the RAS subfamily (most notably HRAS or KRAS). RAS can then bind GTP
  and become active. Activated RAS activates the protein kinase activity of RAF1 kinase.
  RAF1 kinase phosphorylates and activates the MAPK/ERK kinases MEK1 and MEK2. MEK1
  and MEK2 then phosphorylate and activate the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs. Activated ERKs
  translocate to the nucleus, where they phosphorylate and regulate various transcription
  factors leading to changes in gene expression. BRAF is also a member of the RAF
  kinase family of serine/threonine-specific protein kinases. BRAF is activated following
  GTP-bound RAS binding, and phosphorylates and activates the mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinases (MEK1 and MEK2). Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades
  are key signaling pathways involved in the regulation of normal cell proliferation,
  survival and differentiation. The syndromes and their mutated proteins are as indicated:
