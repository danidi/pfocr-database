caption: Pathway participation of significantly changed proteins. Proteins identified
  were mapped to KEGG pathways, and those involved in the pathways were assigned KEGG
  IDs. Each node represents a single protein indicated by PHATRDRAFT ID, and different
  colors represent the differential expression changes at the protein level. All first
  degree interactions and second degree interactions that allow the connection of
  two identified proteins are included in the figure
