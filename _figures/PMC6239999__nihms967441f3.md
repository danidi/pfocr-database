caption: Role of mucolipin-1 (TRPML1) during mTOR and TFEB signaling. As described
  in the text, in response to a low nutrient state (1) mTOR dissociates from the lysosome
  and lysosomal calcium efflux is triggered through mucolipin-1 (2), allowing for
  activation of the phosphatase calcineurin (3). Calcineurin in turn dephosphorylates
  TFEB (4), which promotes its translocation across the nuclear envelope to activate
  lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy gene expression (5). In response to a high nutrient
  state (6), mTORC1 scaffolding proteins are recruited to the lysosomal surface and
  mTORC1 docks on this lysosomal platform (7). Activated mTORC1 then phosphorylates
  TFEB (8), which promotes its association with 14-3-3 proteins sequestering TFEB
  within its cytosolic location and thereby downregulates lysosomal biogenesis/autophagy
  gene expression (9). In response to nutrient availability, mTORC1 also phosphorylates
  mucolipin-1 directly (10), which reduces its channel activity and would further
  promote cytosolic localization of TFEB in a phosphorylated state. Mucolipin-1's
  ability to respond to low nutrient states by releasing calcium (see 2, above) has
  been suggested to be due to relief of mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of mucolipin-1.
  These key roles of mucolipin-1 in the nutrient sensing pathway governed by mTORC1
  have been previously highlighted in other reviews (). (; ; ; ; Settembre et al.
  2013a).
