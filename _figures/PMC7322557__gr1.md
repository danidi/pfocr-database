caption: Molecular connections between components of circadian clocks and the immune
  system. BMAL1, in a heterodimer with CLOCK, represses the expression of CCL2, CCL8,
  S100a8, and TLR9 by binding to E-box motifs. BMAL1 also recruits the Polycomb repressor
  complex 2 (PRC2) to the promoter of these genes. The histone methyltransferase EZH2
  (a member of PRC2) induces the trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 within
  the Ccl2, Ccl8, and S100a8 promoter region leading to reduced transcription. BMAL1
  is also able to dimerize with RelB, thus blocking a subunit of the proinflammatory
  transcription factor NFκB. On the contrary, BMAL1 positively controls the antiinflammatory
  protein NRF2. The histone acetyl transferase CLOCK acetylates the RelA subunit (NFκB)
  and glucocorticoid receptors, thereby regulating their DNA binding capacity. The
  transcription of BMAL1 and CLOCK is under direct control of the repressors CRY and
  PER. Additionally, translation of BMAL1 is inhibited by miR-155. PER binds together
  with PPARγ to an E-box in the Ccr2 promoter region, downregulating its transcription.
  CRY dimerizes with the adenylyl cyclase (AC) to inhibit its function. BMAL1 upregulates
  the transcription of the two metabolic genes Nr1d1 (REV-ERBα) and RORα via E-Box
  motifs. RORα upregulates the transcription of IκBα, the major transcriptional inhibitor
  of the NFκB signaling pathway, as well as Ccl2. REV-ERBα binds histone deacetylase
  3 (HDAC3) and the nuclear hormone corepressor (NCoR) to inhibit the transcription
  of Ccl2, Il-6, Nlrp3, and Il1b while at the same time upregulating the transcription
  of Nfil3 via E-box and ROR elements.
