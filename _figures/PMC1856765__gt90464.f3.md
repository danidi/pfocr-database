caption: Apoptotic pathways. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by death receptor–ligand
  interaction (FAS/CD95 and FASL, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR1)
  and TNF, TRAIL‐R and TRAIL, and others). On receptor–ligand binding, the intracellular
  death domain of the death receptor attracts the intracellular adaptor molecule,
  Fas‐associated death domain (FADD). The adaptor molecule recruits caspases 8 and
  10, forming the death‐inducing signal complex (DISC), where they are cleaved and
  activated. In some cells, these initiator caspases are sufficient to activate effector
  caspases 3, 6 and 7 (type I cells). Some other cell types require the mitochondrial
  pathway to amplify their death signals (type II cells). In this case, caspase 8
  or 10 activates the Bcl2‐interacting domain (BID), which translocates to mitochondria
  and induces release of cytochrome c. Cytochrome c itself interacts with apoptotic
  protease‐activating factor 1 (APAF1) and the inactive form of caspase 9, termed
  the apoptosome. This complex cleaves and activates caspase 9 in an adenosine triphosphate‐dependent
  manner. Consecutively, effector caspases 3, 6 and 7 are activated. Important counter‐regulatory
  factors of apoptosis are antiapoptotic members of the Bcl family (Bcl2 and BclXL)
  and the FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP). The FLICE inhibitory protein inhibits the
  activation of initiator caspases 8 and 10. The intrinsic pathway is classically
  mediated by mitochondria. Pro‐apoptotic signals cause the perturbation of the mitochondrial
  membrane, with consecutive release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm. The activation
  of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is held in balance between pro‐apoptotic factors
  such as BAX and BAK, and inhibitory factors such as Bcl2 and BclXL. The unbalanced
  expression of either pro‐apoptotic or apoptotic factors thus perturbs the equilibrium
  of cell homeostasis towards apoptosis or enhanced survival. An important regulator
  molecule is p53, which is the guard of cell integrity. On detection of genomic DNA
  damage or high cell stress, p53 translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to
  initiate transcription of pro‐apoptotic factors.
