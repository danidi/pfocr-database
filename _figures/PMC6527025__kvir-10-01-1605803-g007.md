caption: Apoptosis Signalling in T-Helper Cells During HIV Infection.HIV proteins
  are involved in apoptosis. GP120 attachment to CD4 receptor and CCR5 or CXCR4 can
  induce the extrinsic pathway in a Fas-dependent manner. GP120 induces Bax expression
  which activates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by the release of cytochrome
  C (Cyto c) and formation of the apoptosome. Vpr causes cell cycle arrest at the
  G2 stage. Tat and Nef activate the expression of caspase 8 which changes procaspase
  3 to caspase 3 and results in DNA degradation. Tat and Vpr down regulate Bcl2 and
  BclXL.
