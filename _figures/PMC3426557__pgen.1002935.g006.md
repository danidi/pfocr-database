caption: We propose that a specific requirement for Cdk2 activity to protect cells
  from IR reflects its distinct mode of activation. Cdk2 is phosphorylated as a monomer
  by CAK, and then binds cyclin A to become active. Cdk1, in contrast, can only be
  phosphorylated by mammalian CAK in the presence of a cyclin (A or B), and only forms
  stable complexes with cyclins upon T-loop phosphorylation. This effectively couples
  Cdk1-activating phosphorylation to inhibitory phosphorylation by kinases such as
  Wee1 that also require a CDK/cyclin complex substrate , , and makes Cdk1 intrinsically
  more sensitive to restraint by DNA damage checkpoints. By evading that restraint,
  Cdk2 might take the lead role in phosphorylating Nbs1-Ser432 (and possibly other
  targets such as CtIP) early in S phase.
