caption: 'View into an erosion: mechanisms involved in osteoclastogenesis and arthritic
  bone erosion. The resorption front of local bone erosion in rheumatoid arthritis
  (RA) is illustrated. A resorption lacuna is filled with an osteoclast and surrounded
  by synovial inflammatory tissue (pannus) with fibroblast-like synoviocytes and T
  cells. Both of these cell types influence osteoclast maturation and activation,
  whereas cells of the macrophage lineage, which are not separately depicted, constitute
  the pool of osteoclast precursor cells. Potential therapeutic targets, which also
  represent essential mechanisms of osteoclast development and function, are indicated
  by black squares. Target molecules are grouped according to their functional role
  in the osteoclast (from the top): molecules, which influence the stromal cells to
  express pro-osteoclastogenic molecules (such as tumor necrosis factor [TNF], IL-1,
  IL-6, IL-11, IL-17 or prostaglandin E2 [PGE2]); receptor-ligand interactions, which
  are essential for osteoclast development and function (receptor-activator of nuclear
  factor kappa B ligand [RANKL]/receptor-activator of nuclear factor kappa B [RANK],
  macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)/c-fms, RGD-containing matrix molecules/avβ3
  integrin); signaling intermediates downstream of the receptor level (src, TRAF-6,
  PI3-K); phosphokinases in the cytoplasm (akt, JNK, p38, ERK); transcription factors
  (c-fos, c-jun, nuclear factor [NF]-κB); and effector molecules essential for osteoclast
  function (cathepsin K, matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-9, vATPase). The bar between
  the osteoclast and the bone indicates one of the complex methods of the function
  of bisphosphonates (inhibition of attachment of osteoclasts on bone), whereas other
  methods such as inhibition of the mevalonate pathway are not depicted.'
