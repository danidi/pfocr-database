caption: 'Summary of the interdependency of EGF and GLP-2 signaling to attenuate mucosal
  atrophy in a mouse TPN model. Exogenous EGF and GLP-2 treatment attenuate TPN-associated
  mucosal atrophy. Based on the results from reciprocal receptor inhibition studies
  and analyses of IEC responses in IEC-EgfrKO and IEC-pi3kr1KO mice, the requirements
  of EGFR- and PI3K/pAKT-dependent pathways in IECs for the beneficial actions of
  these 2 growth factors are summarized. Top panel: TPN alone. TPN alone reduces components
  of endogenous EGF and GLP-2 signaling in the intestinal mucosa. Importantly, TPN
  leads to a reduction in functional EGFR signaling in IECs, decreased cytoplasmic
  PI3k/pAKT signaling, and decreased p-β-catenin (S552), c-Myc, and cyclin D1 levels
  leading to mucosal atrophy. Middle panel: TPN plus exogenous EGF. Exogenous EGF
  treatment restores GLP-2 plasma levels, mucosal GLP2R expression, and EGFR protein
  levels in IECs. Exogenous EGF also may enhance the production of ErbB ligands from
  other lamina propria cells that activate other ErbB receptors on IECs (not shown).
  The beneficial actions of exogenous EGF are dependent on functional EGFR and PI3K/pAKT
  signaling in IECs. EGFR/PI3K/pAKT signaling is required for maintenance of nuclear
  p-B-catenin (S552), c-Myc, and cyclin D1 levels needed to improve IEC responses
  and attenuate mucosal atrophy. Bottom panel: TPN plus exogenous GLP-2. Exogenous
  GLP-2 treatment robustly increases GLP-2 plasma levels and restores mucosal EGF
  expression. Exogenous GLP-2 also may increase expression of other ErbB ligands in
  GLP2R-expressing lamina propria cells that activate other ErbB receptors on IECs
  (not shown). The beneficial actions of exogenous GLP-2 are dependent on functional
  EGFR signaling in IECs, but GLP-2 still can attenuate mucosal atrophy in the absence
  of PI3K/pAKT signaling in IECs. Importantly, functional EGFR signaling but not PI3k/pAKT
  signaling in IECs is required for maintenance of nuclear p-B-catenin (S552), c-Myc,
  and cyclin D1 levels needed to improve IEC responses and attenuate mucosal atrophy.
  As noted, complex cross-talk between GLP2R and EGFR/ErbB signaling with other signaling
  pathways such as IGF-1/IGF-1R likely contributes to these beneficial IEC responses.
  In IECs, IGF-1R signaling also may contribute to activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  independently of the PI3K/pAKT pathway (see  section for more details).'
