caption: 'The lymph gland primary lobe consists of three distinct cellular populations
  or zones. The medullary zone (MZ) contains blood progenitor cells while the nearby
  cortical zone (CZ) contains differentiating and mature blood cells. The posterior
  signaling center (PSC) functions as a supportive population (a niche) that expresses
  Hedgehog (Hh) and maintains the progenitor cells utilizing this ‘niche signal’.
  The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Pvr and the STAT (STAT92E) transcriptional activator
  are required in CZ cells for the proper expression and secretion of the extracellular
  enzyme ADGF-A, which keeps the extracellular adenosine levels relatively low by
  converting it to inosine. The Pvr ligand Pvf1 is made in PSC cells and is transported
  through the lymph gland to activate Pvr in CZ cells. Collectively, we refer to the
  system that generates ADGF-A from the differentiating cells as ‘equilibrium signaling’,
  which is required independently of the niche-derived Hh signaling for the maintenance
  of progenitor blood cells in the MZ. Signaling events downstream of both ADGF-A
  and Hh (dashed arrows) cause the inhibition of Protein Kinase A (PKA) within progenitor
  blood cells, thereby promoting their maintenance. The individual components are
  color coded to match the schematic of the lymph gland. The equilibrium signal ADGF-A
  is blue, originating from the CZ; the niche signal Hh is magenta, originating in
  the PSC; PKA is gray, functioning in the MZ progenitor cells. Full details of this
  molecular pathway can be found in .DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03626.003'
