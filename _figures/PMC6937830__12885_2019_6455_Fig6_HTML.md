caption: The KEGG pathway network. The nodes in network represent genes, and the edges
  represent the interaction of the two genes in the pathways. The nodes marked as
  colors in the legend represent differential methylation of the gene in the cancer
  type or a non-differentiated methylation gene obtained from the pathway. C. Enrichment
