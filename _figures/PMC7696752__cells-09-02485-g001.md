caption: The role of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs)
  in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. APP is synthesized in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and subsequently transported through the Golgi compartment to early
  endosomes (1) or the plasma membrane (2), where it can be cleaved by α-secretase
  in the non-amyloidogenic pathway. This cleavage leads to the formation of soluble
  APP α (sAPPα) and the α-C-terminal fragment (α-CTF or C83). Alternatively, APP can
  be re-internalized in endosomes (3) where the amyloidogenic cleavage by β-secretase
  preferentially occurs. Thereby, sAPPβ and β-CTF (C99) are generated. The formation
  of the APP intracellular domain (AICD) and either the P3 fragment or the amyloid
  β (Aβ) peptide from α- and β-CTF, respectively, requires cleavage by the γ-secretase
  complex. Early endosomes recycle to the plasma membrane (4), undergo retrograde
  transport to the trans-Golgi network (5) or mature into late endosomes/MVBs (6).
  The latter either fuse with lysosomes (7) or with the plasma membrane (8), resulting
  in the extracellular release of their intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) as EVs. Several
  products of the APP processing pathway have been localized to MVBs (i.e., APP itself;
  α- and β- CTF; AICD; Aβ) and EVs (i.e., APP itself; α- and β- CTF; Aβ; α-, β- and
  components of the γ-secretase complex), whereby Aβ can be localized both on the
  inside and on the surface of EVs. Figure created with BioRender.
