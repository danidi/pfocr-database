caption: Model for the two recA-lexA pathways, ALD (A) and the known SOS response
  (B), and their inhibition by the EDF-mazEF pathway. The EDF-mazEF-mediated pathway
  is activated under both severe (A, right) and moderate (B, right) DNA damage. Under
  both conditions, we observed a difference only in the level of bacterial survivors
  (A, right, versus B, right). The EDF-mazEF-mediated pathway inhibits the recA-lexA-mediated
  pathway. Therefore, in the absence of a functional EDF-mazEF-mediated pathway, the
  recA-lexA pathway is permitted. Under severe DNA damage, strong activation of RecA
  occurs, leading to the ALD pathway (A, left). On the other hand, under moderate
  DNA damage, only a moderate activation of RecA occurs, leading to the SOS response
  (B, left). For additional details regarding the ALD and SOS pathways, see the Discussion.
