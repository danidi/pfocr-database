caption: 'Metabolic pathway coverage: glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Component enzymes
  of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways predicted to be present in Toxoplasma
  from genome analysis are colored. Virtually every component of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis
  pathway predicted for Toxoplasma was identified as being expressed in tachyzoites
  by proteomic analysis. Green and blue indicate genes for which expression has been
  confirmed in tachyzoites in this study by mass spectrometric data; blue also signifies
  genes for which post-translational modification is likely as indicated by the evidence
  from two-dimensional gels. Red indicates genes for which expression of predicted
  components has not been confirmed in this study. Coverage of key metabolic pathway
  component proteins was determined using the Metabolic Pathway Reconstruction for
  T. gondii available on the KEGG Pathway site accessed via ToxoDB [].'
