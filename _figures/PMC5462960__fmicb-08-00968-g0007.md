caption: 'Location of BHP biosynthetic genes and gene clusters in the genomes of SD1,
  SD3, and SD4 Acidobacteria and a number of selected environmental genomes as determined
  by BLAST protein searches. Species were ordered as indicated by the phylogeny of
  the shc gene. Stippled lines indicate a distance between the genes. The numbers
  refer, in combination with the code below the species name, to the locus tag in
  the annotated genome from the NCBI database. These numbers typically increase by
  5 for every next gene. Color codes of genes are: orange, genes involved in the biosynthesis
  of farnesyl diphosphate; red and dark red (putative), genes involved in the biosynthesis
  of squalene; blue, genes involved in BHP biosynthesis; yellow, genes involved in
  the methylation of BHPs; dark green, genes involved in the mevalonate pathway of
  isoprenoid biosynthesis, light green, genes often of unknown function associated
  with identified gene clusters. Names of genes refer to Table . Three gene clusters
  were often encountered and these are indicated in different background colors (red,
  blue, and yellow). When these cluster are indicated with a stippled box, these clusters
  have been slightly modified by the insertion or deletion of one or a few genes.
