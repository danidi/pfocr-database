caption: Two major bile acid biosynthetic pathways are shown. The classic pathway
  is the major bile acid synthetic pathway in the liver. In this pathway, cholesterol
  is converted to 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-HOC) by the rate-limiting enzyme cholesterol
  7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), which is located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The sterol
  12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) converts the intermediate 7α-hydroxy-4 cholesten-3-one
  (C4) to 7α, 12α-dihydroxy-4- cholesten-3-one, leading to synthesis of cholic acid
  (CA). Without 12αhydroxylation by CYP8B1, C4 is eventually converted to chenodeoxycholic
  acid (CDCA). The mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) catalyzes the steroid
  side-chain oxidation in both CA and CDCA synthesis. In the alternative pathway,
  CYP27A1 converts cholesterol to 27hydroxycholesterol (27-HOC), which eventually
  is converted to CDCA. In mouse liver, most CDCA is converted to α- and β-muricholic
  acid (MCA). MCA is only found in trace amount in humans. In the large intestine,
  bacterial 7-dehydroxylase removes a hydroxyl group from C-7 and converts CA to deoxycholic
  acid (DCA) and converts CDCA to lithocholic acid (LCA). CYP3A1 and epimerases also
  convert CDCA to the secondary bile acids, including hyocholic acid (HCA), murideoxycholic
  acid (MDCA), ω-muricholic acid (ω-MCA), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) and ursodeoxycholic
  acid (UDCA). Most LCA and ω-MCA are excreted into feces.
