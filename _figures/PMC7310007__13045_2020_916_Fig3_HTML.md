caption: 'Role of STING pathway in tumor suppression. a cGAS-STING pathway and cancer-immunity
  cycle. cGAS-STING pathway functions as a tumor suppressor induced by DNA damage.
  Cytosolic DNA generated from different sources of DNA damage could be sensed by
  enzyme cGAS in a tumor cell. The cGAS then activates STING to upregulate type I
  IFN expression, which mediates tumor-suppressive effects. In addition, the cGAS-STING
  signaling allows the crosstalk between the tumor cells and immune cells nearby.
  Tumor-derived cGAMP or tumor-derived DNA could activate the activation of DCs, which
  activates the cGAS-STING pathway and promote immune cells against tumors. b cGAS-STING
  in innate immune sensing and spontaneous anti-tumor T cell responses. Tumor-derived
  DNA can induce cGAS-STING pathway activation of APCs and upregulate expression of
  type I IFNs, which increases its lymph node-homing capability and spontaneous T
  cells. Abbreviations: cGAMP, 2′,3′-cyclic GMP-AMP; CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocytes;
  IFN, interferon; NK cells, natural killer cells; SASP, senescence-associated secretory
  phenotype; TME, tumor microenvironment'
