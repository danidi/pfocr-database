caption: Signals shared after brain injury and in the NSC niche. (a) Mature astrocytes
  in the healthy brain parenchyma are polarized towards (and make contact with) the
  basement membrane (BM) surrounding blood vessels and do not divide. (b) Loss of
  signalling from the BM as seen after brain injury leads to reactive astrogliosis,
  including loss of the polarized expression of endfeet proteins, hypertrophy and
  upregulation of intermediate filaments (IMFs), and secretion of chondroitin sulfate
  proteoglycans (CSPGs). Secretion of CSPGs is triggered by fibrinogen, which activates
  transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signalling. This pathway also promotes upregulation
  of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which may inhibit axonal regeneration.
  (c) Signals triggering astrocyte proliferation after injury are fibroblast growth
  factor (FGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha
  (TGFα), which act via the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) or the mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The latter is also activated by purinergic signalling
  following the release of ATP after brain injury. Proliferating reactive astrocytes
  do not generate other glia or neurons in vivo. However, exposure to further EGF
  and FGF2 signalling in vitro confers the capacity to generate neurons, astrocytes
  and oligodendrocytes in vitro. (d) These factors, as well as vascular endothelial
  growth factor (VEGF) and sonic hedgehog (SHH), are also active in the adult neurogenic
  niches, like the SVZ, in vivo, where they also promote proliferation of neural stem
  and progenitor cells. EGFR, EGF receptor; ET1, endothelin 1; ETR, ET receptor; FGFR,
