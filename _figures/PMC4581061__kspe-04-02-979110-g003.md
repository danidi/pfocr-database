caption: Induction of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis by phthalates. When Sertoli
  cells are injured by mono-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), a signaling cascade is initiated
  resulting in the upregulation of FasL, which binds the Fas receptor, ultimately
  resulting in apoptosis of spermatocytes. TIMP2 (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase
  2), MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase 2), NFκ-B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells), TNFα (tumor necrosis factor-α).
