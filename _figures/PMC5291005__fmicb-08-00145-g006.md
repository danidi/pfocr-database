caption: Schematic representation of regulatory mechanism employed by ArgR in L. monocytogenes.
  L. monocytogenes ArgR plays a classical role of ArgR/AhrC family in feedback inhibitory
  of arginine biosynthetic pathway (highlighted in yellow) using arginine as a cofactor.
  ArgR unexpectedly represses the transcription and expression of arcA and sigB in
  the absence of exogenous arginine, preventing arginine degradation via the ADI and
  AgDI pathways (highlighted in light cyan and light red, respectively). Addition
  of arginine leads to derepression of arcA and sigB, allowing utilization of arginine
  as a nitrogen and energy source via the arginine degradation pathway.
