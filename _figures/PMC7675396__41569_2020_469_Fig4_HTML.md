caption: a | The normal resting endothelium is crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis
  through production of several anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic factors, including
  nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin I2 (PGI2; also known as prostacyclin), thrombomodulin,
  activated protein C, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin III
  (ATIII). b | In disease states, such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, increased
  oxidative stress with elevated intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  can promote the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β, IL-6 and
  TNF), decrease the bioavailability of NO and PGI2 and induce endothelial cell apoptosis,
  leading to endothelial damage and dysfunction. Furthermore, the release of pro-inflammatory
  and prothrombotic factors (such as von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombin) can
  lead to vascular inflammation, platelet aggregation and thrombosis. Simultaneous
  invasion of the endothelium by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
  — the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) — via the angiotensin-converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor can exacerbate endothelial dysfunction and damage, further
  promoting vascular inflammation and thrombosis. The dashed arrows represent complex
  molecular signalling mechanisms that remain to be defined in the context of COVID-19.
  TF, tissue factor.
