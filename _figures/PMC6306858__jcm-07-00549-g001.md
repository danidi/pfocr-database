caption: 'A primer of the inflammatory cascade. (a) Pathogens, tissue injury, and
  foreign particles induce inflammation. (b) Transmembrane TLRs and intracellular
  NLRs bind to PAMPs or DAMPs, respectively. (c) TLRs activate a MyD88-dependent signal
  transduction pathway that involves the phosphorylation of the inhibitory IκB protein
  by IKK. NF-κB is released from IκB, and it translocates to the nucleus where transcription
  is upregulated through binding to target inflammatory genes. NLRs signal the inflammasome,
  which activates caspase-1 to convert cytokines into active forms (IL-1β and IL-18),
  which then elicit inflammation after being released from the cell. (d) A variety
  of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are produced and released to promote
  effector functions of inflammation. (e) Blood-borne neutrophils and monocytes migrate
  to the site of disturbance by chemotaxis and selectively pass through endothelial
  cells to reach target sites (extravasation). This influx of cells is accompanied
  by protein-rich fluid, known as the exudate, and promotes edema (swelling). Mast
  cells and tissue-resident macrophages promote this migration by releasing histamine,
  leukotrienes, and prostaglandins, which have rapid effects upon the vasculature,
  including vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. Neutrophils release
  toxic compounds, including ROS, RNS, and various proteases, which are nonspecific
  and harm both the pathogen and host. Macrophages and dendritic cells participate
  in the phagocytosis of Ag. (f) These cells migrate to lymphoid tissue and prime
  naıve T-cells (Th0) to become polarized through the stimulation of the TCR by antigens
  bound to MHC class II receptors. Th0 cells differentiate into several different
  types of effectors and regulatory cells: Th1 cells (proinflammatory), Th2 cells
  (anti-inflammatory), Tregs (regulatory), and Th17 cells (proinflammatory). Depending
  upon the type of pathogen and other factors, the resulting Th population can be
  biased toward a proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, or regulatory phenotype. Cytokines
  produced by polarized Th1 and Th2 are mutually inhibitory, whereas cytokines produced
  by Treg cells dampen both Th1 and Th2 responses. Th17 cells are highly proinflammatory
  and are regulated by the other Th subsets. Black-arrowed and dashed lines represent
  stimulatory and inhibitory actions, respectively. (g) Resolution of inflammation
  occurs when neutrophils promote the switch of leukotrienes produced by macrophages
  and other cells to lipoxins, which initiates the termination of inflammation. Fas
  ligand, resolvins, and protectins promote the apoptosis of neutrophils. Macrophages
  phagocytose apoptotic neutrophils and cellular debris. Abbreviations: Ag, antigen;
