caption: 'Four major roles that have been reported for RAMPs: 1. RAMPs enable the
  forward-trafficking of some GPCRs to the cell surface. 2. RAMPs can alter GPCR pharmacology,
  switching ligand selectivity for some GPCRs. 3. RAMPs can influence coupling to
  GPCR signaling pathways. 4. RAMPs may alter the trafficking pathway of some GPCRs
  from the cell surface, with different RAMPs controlling receptor fate through recycling
  or degradative pathways.'
