caption: mTOR is pivotal in regulating a balance between proliferation and differentiation.
  Human islets (left panel), display a high level of insulin signaling pathway resistance
  due to chronic mTOR activation. This results in negative feedback, IRS-1/2 degradation
  and the inability of Akt to inhibit GSK-3 and engage the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
  To enhance human β-cell proliferation, pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3, in combination
  with mTOR-mediated β-catenin nuclear translocation is required. To shift this balance
  in favor of maintaining β-cell differentiation (right panel), GSK-3 inhibitors are
  removed and islets are treated with the PPARγ sparing TZD, MSDC-0160 that enhances
  AMPK activity, downregulates mTOR/S6K1-dependent negative feedback and restores
  the insulin-signaling pathway. Activation of Akt by insulin/IGF-1 results in increases
  in differentiation markers, insulin, pdx-1, nkx6.1 and nkx2.2, promotes β-cell survival
  and restores insulin content. Downregulation of mTOR also prevents β-catenin translocation
  to the nucleus, blocking DNA synthesis. Thus, DNA synthesis and differentiation
  do not occur simultaneously. MSDC-0160 may produce a unique modulation of nutrient
  sensors that give rise to signals that cause β-cells to leave the cell cycle and
  differentiate (right panel). The cycling of proliferation, followed by treatment
  with MSDC-0160 to allow restoration of insulin content, may maintain a balance between
  regenerative processes and preservation of the β-cell phenotype. Dotted line indicates
  reduced signaling levels.
