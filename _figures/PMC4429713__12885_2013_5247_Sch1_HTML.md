caption: Proposed signaling pathway by which radioactive 125I seeds inhibit epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and cell growth in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cellsProposed
  signaling pathway by which radioactive 125I seeds inhibit epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and cell growth in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. 125I seeds
  act indirectly through radiolysis of water, thereby generating ROS and producing
  DNA damage. DNA damage activates the sensory ATM/ATR kinases and finally results
  in cell growth inhibition and G2/M arrest. Moreover, ROS induced by 125I seeds can
  inhibit EMT via Cav-1 in GBM cells.
