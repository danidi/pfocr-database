caption: PPARγ agonists inhibit Stat3-mediated IL-6 gene expression in myeloma cells.
  Inactivation of IL-6-activated Stat3 by PPARγ agonists occurs in a PPARγ-dependent
  manner; however, the molecular mechanisms by which two distinct PPARγ agonists (15d-PGJ2
  and troglitazone) suppress IL-6-activated Stat3 in MM cells differ as shown in (a)
  []. Direct complex formation between phosphorylated Stat3 and PPARγ activated by
  15d-PGJ2 prevents Stat3 binding to its cognate response element (SBE) on the promoters
  of target genes ((a), left). This mode of transcriptional inactivation does not
  require binding of the activated PPARγ transcription factor to DNA in the promoter
  region and, thus, can occur in the absence of a PPRE. However troglitazone activated
  PPARγ promotes redistribution of the corepressor SMRT from PPARγ to phosphorylated
  Stat3 so that Stat3 can no longer recruit the transcriptional machinery necessary
  for gene expression ((a), right) []. High levels of IL-6 are found in MM and promote
  myeloma cell proliferation and survival and indirectly promote tumor-associated
  angiogenesis. The PPARγ agonists troglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 have been shown to inhibit
  transcription of the IL-6 promoter driven by C/EBPβ and NF-κB []. Troglitazone-activated
  PPARγ binds to C/EBPβ preventing binding to its cognate response element on the
  IL-6 promoter, which is the major mechanistic pathway of troglitazone-mediated downregulation
  of IL-6 expression. In addition activated PPARγ competes with NF-κB for the PGC-1
  coactivator, which leads to decreased NF-κB binding to the κB response element on
  the IL-6 promoter contributing to inhibition of IL-6 gene expression, albeit to
  a lesser extent than inhibition of C/EBPβ ((b), left). A slightly different mechanistic
  emphasis on PPARγ-mediated inhibition of IL-6 gene expression occurs in response
  to 15d-PGJ2. Although 15d-PGJ2-activated PPARγ inhibits C/EBPβ-mediated transactivation
  of the IL-6 promoter similarly to troglitazone-activated PPARγ, the predominant
  mode of inhibition is through 15d-PGJ2-activated PPARγ using the coactivator PGC-1
  as a bridging protein to interact with NF-κB to prevent transactivation of the IL-6
  promoter. Furthermore, 15d-PGJ2 inactivates NF-κB by inhibiting phosphorylation
  of IKK and IκB independently of PPARγ activation ((b), right). The schematics in
  this figure were adapted from [, ].
