caption: 'Eukaryotic gene expression is controlled by multiple mechanisms, and its  regulation
  is central for physiological responses to extracellular and  intracellular signals.
  An essential step in this process involves the movement  of mRNA transcripts from
  the site of synthesis in the nucleus to the  cytoplasm, where they can be translated
  into proteins. The nuclear export of  mRNA transcripts can be broken down into distinct
  stages: first, pre-mRNA is  transcribed in the nucleus, where it is processed and
  packaged into messenger  ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes; second, the mRNPs are
  targeted to and  translocate through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) that are embedded
  in the  nuclear envelope; and third, the mRNPs are directionally released into the  cytoplasm
  for translation. Recent work has revealed that there is extensive  mechanistic coupling
  between each of these steps  ().  Moreover, it has been shown that perturbations
  in the factors that are  essential for mRNA nuclear export have surprising links
  to different disease  states. In this article and its accompanying poster, we provide
  an overview of  the mRNA nuclear export  pathway.'
