caption: Model depicting the possible interaction between Ras signaling and GPI–GnT
  in C. albicans. Depending on their filamentation phenotypes, GPI–GnT mutants of
  C. albicans can be classified into two sets, hyperfilamentous and hypofilamentous.
  In each mutant, CaGpi2 expression levels alone dictate the filamentation phenotype.
  CaRas1 physically interacts with CaGpi2 to stimulate GPI–GnT activity. GTP-bound
  CaRas1 is a better activator. CaGpi2, in turn, helps activate CaRas1-dependent cAMP/PKA
  activity and promote filamentation. This does not require formation of a functional
  GPI–GnT. It is possible that physical interaction of CaRas1 with CaGpi2 assists
  ER association of CaRas1 and thereby promotes its palmitoylation as well as transport/localization
  to the PM. This perhaps increases the pool of CaRas1 available for hyphal signaling
  at the PM. At the PM, CaRas1 cycles between an active GTP-bound and an inactive
  GDP-bound form by the action of Ira2, a GAP, and Cdc25, a guanine nucleotide exchange
  factor (, ). For cAMP-dependent signaling, CaRas1-GTP needs to associate with Cyr1,
  the adenylyl cyclase, and activate cAMP production. However, this interaction is
  inhibited by Hsp90 along with its co-chaperone, Sgt1 (). As a consequence of this
  modulation, CaRas1-dependent cAMP signaling is maintained at basal levels. When
  Hsp90 levels are down-regulated, due to CaGpi2 overexpression as shown in this work
  or by CaGpi19 down-regulation (), the interaction of CaRas1 with Cyr1 is promoted
  at the cost of its interaction with Ira2. Thus, the filamentation pathway remains
  turned on even at 30 °C, resulting in a hyperfilamentous phenotype.
