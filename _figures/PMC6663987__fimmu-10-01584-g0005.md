caption: Head Start Immunity Model. Upon vaccination with C strain, the induction
  of interferon results in induction of ISGs, including the ISG15 antiviral pathway
  resulting in the induction and activation via ISGylation of a wide variety of antiviral
  effectors. These antiviral effectors accumulate over the 5 days post vaccination,
  priming the host in an antiviral state and, for example via induction of RSAD2,
  instigating the adaptive immune response. If during this window a virulent strain
  of CSFV attempts to infect the host, the multitude of antiviral effectors are already
  present within the cell and can immediately prevent the replication of the virus
  and ultimately assist in preventing the establishment of infection. Without prior
  vaccination, replication of a virulent strain of CFSV is allowed as although the
  antiviral effectors of IFN and ISG15 pathways are induced by the virulent virus
  these cannot keep pace with the replication rate of virulent strains of CSFV and
  thus are not able to sufficiently control viral replication before adaptive responses
  can be activated, leading to the onset of clinical disease.
