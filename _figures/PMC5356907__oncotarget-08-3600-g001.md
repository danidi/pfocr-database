caption: Once ejaculated, removal of cholesterol from the sperm plasma membrane by
  albumin occurs first. Then the Ca2+ and HCO3- present in the seminal fluid enter
  the sperm through different channels include Catsper and NBC, respectively. Heparin
  and progesterone can also help take up Ca2+ into cell, increase intracellular free
  calcium and pH. The transmembrane movement of HCO3- has been associated with the
  increase in pHi as observed during capacitation. One of another early happenings
  during capacitation is the production of ROS, which will trigger and regulate a
  series of events including protein phosphorylation in a time-dependent fashion.
  Then spermatoza response to ROS generate the different signaling includes reversible
  redox signaling and activation of PKA signaling pathway by induce cAMP in a dose-dependent
  way. Cytosolic and mitochondrial glucose and other lectate are important to supply
  NADH for the sperm oxidase that produces O2·- for bull sperm capacitation. The factors
  which activate secondary messenger systems like sAC, then activates PKA. The function
  of endocannabinoid family to cAMP are controversial, some support it can induce
  sAC and cAMP production while others hold opposite opinion. PKA through the activation
  of tyrosine kinases and/or the inhibition of protein phosphatases, then allows an
  increase in protein phosphorylation and stimulate capacitation or acrosomal exocytosis.
  Other researches reveal HDL and other substances in the oviduct fluid also induce
  the capacitation. The function of glucose involved in capacitation remains elusive.
  Some papers report its absence impair the capacitation while others show glucose
  per se do not influence capacitation in vitro. EGF stimulates gene transcription
  during capacitation by activate Ras/Rho, but further mechanisms also remain unknown.
  The beginning of these events seems to be initiated by the elimination of cholesterol
  from the sperm membrane. However, all these events are necessary for the sperm to
  acquire fertilization capacity.
