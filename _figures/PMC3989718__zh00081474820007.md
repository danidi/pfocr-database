caption: A partial model for the control of melatonin (MEL) secretion in pinealocytes.
  NE released from sympathetic varicosities activates β-adrenergic receptors to increase
  cellular cAMP which, in turn, increases melatonin synthesis by the enzyme arylalkylamine
  N-acetyltransferase (AANAT). The nature and function of cholinergic inputs still
  remain to be clarified. Their suggested roles are indicated in this diagram (, ,
  , ). ACh from cholinergic terminals increases intracellular Ca2+ through nAChR and
  voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC). It is suggested that the Ca2+ increase evokes
  glutamate release from pinealocytes and triggers autocrine glutamatergic signal
  inhibitory for melatonin production. We postulate a novel cross talk where sympathetic
  NE suppresses cholinergic input via downregulation of nAChR and VGCC using the canonical
  cAMP pathway in pinealocytes. Voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) limit membrane
  depolarization beyond −20 mV and may limit the generation of action potential firing
  and therefore cell electrical excitability. Straight and dashed lines are positive
  and negative controls, respectively. Circles in metabotropic and ionotropic receptors
  denote the binding sites of neurotransmitters. The diagram omits potential signals
  from mAChR.
