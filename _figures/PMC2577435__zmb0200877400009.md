caption: Signaling from LMP1 and TLR to IRF7 activation. Shown is a scheme of the
  signaling cascade from LMP1 or TLR to activation of IRF7. LMP1 recruits TRAF6 through
  TRAF2. The latter protein may act as an E3 ligase for K63-linked ubiquitination
  of RIP1, which is required for downstream ubiquitination of IRF7 by TRAF6. TLR7/9
  recruits TRAF6 through the adaptor protein MyD88. Although RIP1 is not required
  for TLR3/4 signaling for activation of IRF3 (), it may be involved in TLR3 signaling
  leading to IRF7 activation (Michelle Kelliher, personal communication). After recruitment,
  TRAF6 is auto-ubiquitinated and activated upon dimerization or oligomerization.
  Then, TRAF6 ubiquitinates and activates IRF7 through K63-Ub chains (pathway 1),
  which may recruit an IRF7 kinase (IKKα, IKKɛ, TANK-binding kinase 1, or IL-1 receptor-associated
  kinase 1) for IRF7 phosphorylation. And TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination may also regulate
  the activity of an IRF7 kinase (pathway 2). Solid arrows indicate regulatory pathways
  identified, and dashed arrows indicate pathways which are proposed but still under
  study. P, phosphorylated.
