caption: (a–e) Proposed pathways of trichothecene biosynthesis (pathways were built
  using ChemBioDraw Ultra software v.12.0). Genes encoding an enzymatic step are identified
  in red and enzymes that catalyze the reaction are identified in blue. Reactions
  in which a compound participates as a substrate are indicated in purple. *, a reduced
  [NADPH-hemoprotein reductase]; **, an oxidized [NADPH-hemoprotein reductase]. Dashed
  arrows indicate steps for which the gene function remains to be elucidated. Pathways
  were accessed on the MetaCyc Metabolic Pathway public database, super-pathway of
  trichothecene biosynthesis [https://biocyc.org/META/NEW-IMAGE?type=PATHWAY&object=PWY-7715&detail-level=1]
