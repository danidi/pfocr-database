caption: LPA-induced MIP-2 production depends on Bcl10. (A) Bcl10+/− or Bcl10−/− MEF
  cells were subcultured into 10-cm dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics
  for 48 h. The cell cultures were stimulated with or without LPA for another 24 h.
  Cultured media were collected and cleared by centrifugation for ELISA analysis.
  MIP-2 level was determined by using the MIP-2 Quantikine kit from R&D Systems. Med,
  medium. (B) A schematic model of GPCR-induced and T cell receptor (TCR)-induced
  signaling cascades. In the GPCR pathway, proximal signaling events lead to activation
  of PKC, which, in turn, may regulate CARMA3 and Bcl10. The activated CARMA3 and
  Bcl10 may directly or indirectly regulate the IKK complex. In contrast, in the TCR
  pathway, PKC phosphorylates CARMA1, which induces the formation of the CARMA1–Bcl10–MALT1
  complex, leading to activation of the IKK complex.
