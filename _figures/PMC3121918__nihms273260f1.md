caption: (1) N-linked glycosylation of PAR1 regulates surface expression and signaling.
  (2) Basal ubiquitination of PAR1 promotes retention at the cell surface and negatively
  regulates constitutive recycling. (3) Thrombin binds to and cleaves the N-terminus
  of PAR1, exposing a new N-terminus that functions as a tethered ligand, which induces
  conformational changes within the receptor that results in activation of heterotrimeric
  G proteins. (4) Activation of PAR1 results in rapid phosphorylation mediated by
  GRKs and the recruitment of arrestins, which promote the dissociation of receptor
  from G proteins. (5) After activation, PAR1 is internalized through clathrin-coated
  pits via an AP-2 dependent pathway that occurs independent of arrestins. (6) Once
  internalized, activated PAR1 is sorted from early endosomes/multivesicular bodies
  (MVBs) to lysosomes through a poorly understood process mediated by SNX1.
