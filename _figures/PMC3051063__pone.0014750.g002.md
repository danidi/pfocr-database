caption: Firstly, the key cytokine TNFα binds to its receptor, leading to the recruitment
  of its adaptors and TRAFs, to form a complex which phosphorylates and activates
  IKKK, and the phosphorylated IKKK further activates IKK, leading to the phosphorylation
  and subsequent degradation of IκBα by 26 s proteasome. The direct consequence is
  the translocation of NFκB from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, leading to transcription
  of target genes. Meanwhile, NFκB also activates its own inhibitor, IκBα, giving
  rise to a negative feedback control . By the way, four kinds of specific inhibitors
  with different targets are also described along with the qualitative NFκB pathway
  for the purpose of simulation protocols.
