caption: Molecular signalling of TRAIL. (A) Three proteolytically-cleaved tumour necrosis
  factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) proteins form a homotrimeric structure
  when binding death receptor 4 (DR4) or death receptor 5 (DR5) at the cell membrane.
  These are joined by Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and procaspase-8 to form
  the so-called death-inducing signalling complex (DISC). The DISC causes activation
  of the caspase cascade, leading to apoptosis of the cell. TRAIL may also bind the
  membrane decoy receptors (DcR1/2) or soluble osteoprotegerin (OPG), which do not
  contain a death domain, thus preventing TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis can also
  be suppressed by (FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein
  (c-FLIP), which inhibits the function of the DISC. (B) In the non-canonical signalling
  pathway, the receptor and ligand are thought to be lost, leaving FADD and caspase-8
  to be joined by receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1),
  TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit gamma
  (IKK-γ). This secondary signalling complex initiates protein kinase signalling pathways,
  leading to activation of kinases including nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells (NF-κB), p38 (mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPK), c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The effects of these kinases include survival, proliferation
  and migration.
