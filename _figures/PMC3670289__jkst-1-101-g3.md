caption: Figure 3. Coupling of gp130 (blue, right) to cardiac protective signaling.
  Similar events pertain to LIFR (orange, left), but for simplicity are not shown.
  The scaffold protein Gab1 forms a central point of a signaling complex linking JAK1-p85
  (the regulatory subunit of PI3K), SHP2-p85, and STAT3-p85. The PI3K catalytic subunit
  p110 is activated resulting in creation of phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol binding
  sites for AKT. Once at the membrane, AKT is activated by phosphorylation by phosphoinositide
  dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2).
  AKT plays a role in both the trigger and mediator phases of pre- and postconditiong.-
  The role of AKT in the mediator phase is illustrated here. AKT and ERK1/2 comprise
  the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway. Both kinases phosphorylate
  and inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β) leading to inhibition of mitochondrial
  permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, which can cause cell death. ERK1/2
  and AKT can inhibit GSK3β as well via nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) activation.
  AKT also prevents MPTP opening by activating hexokinase II (HKII). Activation of
  STAT3 constitutes the survivor activating factor enhancement (SAFE) pathway for
  cardiac ischemic protection. Long-term STAT3 is thought to induce genes that are
  protective. A mitochondrial role for STAT3 has been proposed to explain short-term
  actions and may preferentially involve STAT3 phosphorylated on S727 (green circle).
  GAB1 and SHP2 are also linked to cardiac hypertrophy caused by the IL-6 type cytokines
  via ERK5 activation.
