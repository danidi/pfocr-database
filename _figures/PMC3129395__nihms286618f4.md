caption: Molecular model of extranuclear functions of PV in promoting thyroid carcinogenesis
  via the integrin-FAK-cSrc signaling cascade. PV complexes with integrin membrane
  receptors (e.g., α5β1, see ) and actin cytoskeleton to activate signaling via intracellular
  key regulators, including cSrc and FAK. FAK undergoes autophosphorylation to provide
  binding motif for c-Src kinase. FAK is further phosphorylated by c-Src to enhance
  its activity and to recruit downstream adaptors, such as Grb2, for signal transduction.
  Activated c-Src via increasing phosphorylation subsequently activates the p38 MAPK
  pathway. Upon activation of both FAK-c-Src and p38 MAPK-ATF2 signaling pathways,
  the downstream affected genes, such as MMP-9, are therefore transactivated to increase
  expression and activity. The shown signal transduction pathway, initiated by PV
  via protein-protein interaction, promotes invasiveness and migration of thyroid
  cancer cells to undergo distant metastatic spread.
