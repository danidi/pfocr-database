caption: S1PR1 can be activated by extracellular (red arrow) and intracellular (blue
  arrow) S1P. Our in vitro data demonstrate that Memo has an important role in the
  cell-autonomous pathway activating S1PR1 by intracellular S1P. In MEFs, absence
  of Memo results in a defect in cell-autonomous activation of S1PR1 during cell migration
  induced by PDGF. In HUVECs, knockdown of Memo results in defects in survival and
  junction stabilization, both of which were rescued by addition of exogenous S1P.
