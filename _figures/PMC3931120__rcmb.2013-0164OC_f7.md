caption: 'Ingenuity Pathway Analysis on microarray results identified several significant
  biological functions (Fx) and canonical pathways (CP) associated with in utero exposure
  to secondhand smoke in either sex. The color intensity inside each gene symbol and
  in the right-hand bar inside each bracket is associated with relative fold changes
  between SOM and AOM (more saturated red = higher degree of up-regulation). The left-hand
  bar represents relative level of gene up-regulation in SOF versus AOF. Gene abbreviations:
  Arg1, arginase (liver); Ear11, eosinophil-associated RNase 11; Retnlb, resistin
  like β; Saa 1/3, serum amyloid A; Selp, selectin (platelet); Serpina3n, serine (or
  cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3N; Slc7a2, solute carrier family
  7 member 2; Timp1, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; Top2a, DNA topoisomerase
  2-α; Vcan, versican.'
