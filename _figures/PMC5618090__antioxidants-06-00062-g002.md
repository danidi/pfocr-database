caption: The pathways of synthesis and metabolism of intracellular cysteine. Cystine
  is imported in exchange for glutamate via the xc− cystine-glutamate exchanger and
  is reduced to cysteine. Cysteine is also generated from methionine as a product
  of the trans-sulfuration pathway by action of cystathionine-β-synthase (CβS) and
  cystathionine-γ-lyase (CTH), respectively. Homocysteine and cystathionine are intermediates
  of the trans-sulfuration pathway. Glutathione (GSH) is synthesised from cysteine
  and glutamate, by action of γ-glutamylcysteine synthase (GCS), forming γ-glutamylcysteine
  (γ-glucys), followed by the addition of glycine in a reaction catalysed by glutathione
  synthase (GS). Oxidation of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) is catalysed
  by cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), followed by decarboxylation to taurine. Hydrogen
  sulfide (H2S) is formed from cysteine by either CβS or CTH. α-kb, α-ketobutyrate.
