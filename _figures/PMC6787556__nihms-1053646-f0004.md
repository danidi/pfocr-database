caption: 'Based on the evidence summarized in the current review, we propose a hypothesis
  that may explain, in part, why age is the primary driver of the common neurodegenerative
  diseases. At a younger age, sufficient cellular NAD+ maintains mitochondrial quality
  to sustain normal neuronal function via the NAD+-dependent regulations of autophagy/mitophagy,
  UPRmt, proteasome degradation, and mitochondrial biogenesis. As we age, increased
  NAD+ consumption drives NAD+ depletion, leading to impaired mitochondrial homeostasis
  and neuronal function. Depending on the disease-related pathogenesis in the patient,
  age-dependent NAD+ depletion and impaired mitophagy may exacerbate the disease progression.
  This hypothesis explains why age makes people susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases,
  but it is not sufficient. Center: the mitochondrion in the center exhibits the various
  mitochondrial deficiencies observed in the four neurodegenerative diseases AD, PD,
  HD, and ALS. These include impairment of Complex I (CI) in the ETC utilizing NADH
  as an electron donor, creating NAD+. Impairments of both CI and ATP production create
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), which increase the level of oxidative stress, likely
  affecting both the ETC itself and the TCA cycle, and increasing the amount of oxidative
  damage. This can again affect the flux of Ca2+ and the membrane potential, resulting
  in dysfunctional mitochondria. Furthermore, compromised autophagy and/or mitophagy
  has been linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, resulting in accumulation
  of dysfunctional mitochondria. The four panels surrounding the mitochondrion illustrate
  the suggested explanations for NAD+ depleted and the downstream effects of NAD+
  depletion in AD, PD, HD, and ALS. See the text for detailed explanations and references.
