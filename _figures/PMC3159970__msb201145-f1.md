caption: Two different auxin signaling sensors. (A) The DII box is fused to the yellow
  fluorescent protein variant VENUS and constitutively expressed. High auxin levels
  stabilize its interaction with the auxin coreceptors TIR1/AFB, leading to polyubiquitination
  and degradation, thus providing an inverted image of an early step of auxin signaling.
  (B) Auxin-dependent degradation of Aux/IAA repressors liberates activating ARF transcription
  factors (+ARF), which then compete with ARF repressors (−ARF) for the conserved
  binding motifs present in the synthetic DR5rev promoter. The DR5 activity, thus,
  monitors the final transcriptional output of the auxin signaling pathway.
