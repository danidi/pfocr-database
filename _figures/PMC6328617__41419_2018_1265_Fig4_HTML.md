caption: a CD44v6 is able to increase the resistance of CRC cells to apoptosis. Furthermore,
  iASPP binds to p53 together with Mdm2 to limit the translocation of p53 into the
  nucleus to initiate translocation of apoptosis-related genes, such as NOXA and PUMA.
  Hence, p53-dependent apoptosis is prohibited (see ref. ) (blue line). Notably, although
  the C terminus of CD44v6 molecule contains a motif for iASPP binding, the biological
  effect of this binding remains unclear (denoted by the black question mark). In
  addition, CD44v6 maintains cell survival by competitively blocking the binding between
  Fas and their ligands (FasL), because the proximal membrane region encoded by the
  exon 6 variant provides a platform for Fas binding, which prevents caspase activation
  to limit cell apoptosis (see ref. ) (pink line). b CD44v6 is able to promote proliferation
  among CRC cells. Thus, the interaction between HA and CD44v6 is able to stabilize
  the cysteine-glutamate exchanger on the cell membrane to increase the cytoplasmic
  level of cysteine, which then results in a high production of GSH. Therefore, GSH
  is able to suppress ROS (see ref. ), protecting CRC cells against ROS-induced cell
  injury (orange line). In addition, iASPP clears intracellular ROS by binding with
  Keap1, thus enabling Nrf2 to be stabilized. Nrf2 will then translocate into the
  nucleus to initiate transcription of genes functioning in promoting cell expansion
  (see ref. ) (blue line). c CD44v6 induces chemoresistance by increasing MDR gene
  expression and MDR activity. In this process, the HA-CD44v6 interaction is able
  to recruit the PI3K protein to the cytoplasmic domain of the CD44v6 molecule through
  the GAB1 protein (see ref. ). By using this action, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
  is thereby activated. Furthermore, the genes encoding MDR and the enzyme engaging
  in the biosynthesis of HA are targets of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. MDR is
  known to pump intracellular toxins to the outside environment, thus protecting CRC
  cells against chemical agent-induced death. Moreover, by using the increased production
  of HA, the above process will be strengthened. d CD44v6 is able to induce chemoresistance
  by increasing autophagy. The activated CD44v6 will enhance the phosphorylation of
  both Akt and Erk under cytotoxic stress (see ref. ). Furthermore, the activation
  of PI3K/Akt pathway suppresses the rapamycin kinase, which always acts as a negative
  regulator of autophagy activity (yellow line). Moreover, the activated MAPK/ERK
  signaling pathway also plays an important role in autophagosome induction (see ref.
  ) (red line), which then acts on TGFβ/Smad signaling pathway to drive EMT (green
  line)
