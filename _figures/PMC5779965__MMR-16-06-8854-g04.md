caption: Confirmation of some miRNA and target gene expression and integrative pathway
  analysis. (A) Total miRNA was isolated from colon biopsies of 10 additional HIV+
  patients and 10 normal healthy individuals. The quantity of miRNA was determined
  using the fold-changes from the microarray also being shown for comparison. *P<0.05.
  (B) miRNA expression levels of two important putative genes were confirmed by RT-qPCR.
  Triplicates were performed for each sample. Expression levels were calculated using
  the ΔΔCq method, and data are presented as mean ± standard error *P<0.05. (C) An
  integrative schematic illustration was used to identify the miRNAs, target genes
  and pathways that are affected or were predicted to be affected in the patients.
  These pathways involve altered signaling pathways induced by ECM-cell interaction
  and many of them converge at the regulation of immune response-associated cytokines
  and chemokines. miRNA, microRNA; ITGA5, integrin subunit a 5; FBN1, fibrillin 1;
  N, HIV− samples; P, HIV+ samples.
