caption: Proposed schematic model showing how the crosstalk between healthy or oxidized/senescent
  red blood cells (RBCs) and immune cells may exert anti- and proatherogenic effects,
  respectively. Human healthy RBCs release protein factors with the capacity to sustain
  T cell survival and to inhibit activation-induced T cell apoptosis. Healthy RBCs
  are also able to prevent a complete DC maturation in response to LPS, thus inducing
  phenotypic and functional characteristics typical of immature/tolerogenic DCs characterized
  by high IL-10 production. Healthy RBCs under noninflammatory conditions might promote
  a shift toward the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage pathway. Thus, healthy RBCs may
  exert an immunomodulatory activity sustaining anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic
  mechanisms. Under oxidative stress or store banking conditions, RBCs acquire an
  oxidized/senescent phenotype resulting in surface antigen modification or release
  of extracellular vesicles. In this way, oxidized/senescent RBCs or RBC-derived vesicles
  are capable of augment mitogen-driven T cell proliferation and apoptosis and determine
  a T helper 1 (Th1) proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokine response. Oxidized/senescent
  RBCs, failing to control LPS-induced DC maturation, promote DC maturation toward
  a DC profile capable of inciting a proinflammatory Th1 cell response. Stored RBCs
  might polarize macrophages toward the classical M1 macrophage activation pathway
  associated with proinflammatory cytokine production. We propose that the oxidative
  injuries on RBCs likely represent dangerous signals for innate and adaptive immune
  cells, thus contributing or even triggering a damaging process worsening atherosclerotic
  disease.
