caption: Schematic representation of the amniotic fluid eicosanoid profile. All eicosanoids
  significantly increased at term; their biosynthetic pathways from arachidonic acid
  (included in the heat map; see ) are shown. Eicosanoids that showed significant
  differences between TLB and TNL groups are highlighted in bold. Intermediates of
  the biosynthetic pathways that were not detected (or were not detectable due to
  their inherent instability) are shown in square brackets. Where known, the primary
  enzymes of arachidonic acid metabolism are given in italics. Dashed arrows represent
  the metabolic step involving ≥1 enzyme.
