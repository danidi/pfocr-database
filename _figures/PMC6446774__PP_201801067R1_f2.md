caption: 'Overview of JA biosynthesis pathway and related mutants. Only the main pathway
  of oxylipin synthesis to jasmonate is shown. Several branches occur that give rise
  to many other metabolites. In addition, several enzymes are encoded by multiple
  genes from a gene family, although only one is shown. Intermediates and derivates:
  13-HPOT, 13-hydroperoxy-octadecatrienoic acid; 12,13-EOT, 12,13-epoxy octadecatrienoic
  acid; OPC-8:0, 3-oxo-2-(2-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid; JA-Ile, jasmonoyl-Ile.
  Enzymes: LOX, 13-lipoxygenase; OPR, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase; JAR, jasmonate
  response locus encoding a jasmonic acid-amido synthetase that converts JA into the
  bio-active JA-Ile. Mutants: spr2, suppressor of prosystemin response 2 mutant; coi1,
  the mutant in COI F-box protein involved in jasmonate signaling; jai, jasmonate
  insensitive, also mutant in COI.'
