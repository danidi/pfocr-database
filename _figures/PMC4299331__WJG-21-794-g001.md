caption: 'Simplified schematic model showing the hypothetical molecular mechanism
  by which the PNPLA3 I148M variant participates in the development and progression
  of nonalcoholic fatty liver fibrosis. The hedgehog signaling pathway links PNPLA3
  with the activation of hepatic stellate cells, which is considered as the central
  part of fibrogenesis. PNPLA3 protein exhibits activities of lysophosphatidic acid
  acyltransferase and acylglycerol hydrolase to maintain the TG balance in the liver.
  The “gain function” of the PNPLA3 I148M variant causes Triglyceride (TG) accumulation
  in the liver, which accelerates the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
