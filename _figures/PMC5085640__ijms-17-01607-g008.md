caption: 'Regulatory changes in the pathway of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Colored
  circle nodes correspond with the ramie genes detected in the isobaric tags for relative
  and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) data. (a) upregulated or downregulated genes in
  leaves; (b) upregulated or downregulated genes in roots. The above network model
  is generated with a cytoscape web application, based on information gained from
  up to four levels of functional analysis: fold change of gene/protein, protein-protein
  interaction, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment,
  and biological process enrichment. Circle nodes: genes/proteins; rectangle nodes:
  KEGG pathway or biological process. Pathways are colored in a gradient color from
  yellow to blue; yellow indicates a lower p-value, and blue indicates a higher p-value.
  Biological processes are colored in red. In the case of fold change analysis, genes/proteins
  are colored in red (upregulation) and green (downregulation). A default confidence
  cutoff of 400 was used: interactions with a higher confident score are shown as
  solid lines between genes/proteins; dashed lines indicate otherwise.'
