caption: Effects of each silver treatment on differentially expressed genes associated
  with photosynthesis of Scenedesmus obliquus. Shades of red, light blue and white
  indicate up-regulation of target genes of controls, no differential expression of
  genes (Unigenes) and gene products not belong to the photosynthesis of Scenedesmus
  obliquus, respectively. (a) Effects of exposure to r-Ag NCs without L- cysteine
  for 96 h on the light reaction of photosynthesis of Scenedesmus obliquus. (b) Effects
  of exposure to r-Ag NCs without L- cysteine for 96 h on the photosynthetic carbon
  reduction cycle (Calvin cycle) of Scenedesmus obliquus (Adapted from the carbon
  fixation pathway map in the KEGG database). The number in the boxes represents the
  identifier of enzyme involved in the pathway according to the principles of classification
  of Enzyme Commission. Illustrations of the light reaction and photosynthetic carbon
  reduction cycle of Scenedesmus obliquus exposed to r-Ag NCs with L- cysteine and
  Ag+ treatments are available in Table . The differentially expressed genes in photosynthetic
  pathways (light reaction and Calvin cycle) were determined by using the Kyoto Encyclopedia
  of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.
