caption: Pathway component for cell cycle G2/M DNA damage checkpoint regulation. The
  various shapes of nodes denote the different functions. A duplicated shape means
  this node contains multiple components. An arrow denotes the pathway direction.
  A line with a small circle denotes a biological result. Reproduced from Zhan and
