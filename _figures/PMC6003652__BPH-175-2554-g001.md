caption: 'Cellular signalling with NO and cGMP (modified from Murad, ). NO is synthesized
  by the oxidation of L‐arginine catalysed by NOS. NO mediates its biological effects
  by activating sGC and increasing cGMP synthesis from GTP. cGC can also be activated
  by non‐NO‐dependent activators and stimulators (BAY compounds): NO‐independent,
  haem‐dependent stimulators of sGC (BAY 41–2272, BAY 41–8523, BAY 63–2521 and BAY
  60–4552) and NO‐independent, haem‐independent sGC activators (HMR 1766, BAY 58–2667
  and BAY 60–2770). The cGMP formed activates cation channels but also cGMP‐dependent
  protein kinases (cGKs), which, in turn, activate certain proteins (myosin phosphatase,
  inositol 1,4,5‐trisphosphate receptor I (IP(3)RI)‐associated protein = IRAG, and
  vasodilator‐stimulated phosphoprotein = VASP), resulting in, for example, smooth
  muscle relaxation, platelet inhibition and cell growth/differentiation. THe effects
  of cGMP are terminated by PDE5, which breaks down its phosphodiester bond, an effect
  prevented by PDE5 inhibitors. It should be emphasized that the effects of PDE5 inhibitors
  are crucially dependent on the activity of the NO/GC/cGMP pathway.'
