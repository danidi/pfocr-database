caption: An illustration of the multi-scale visualization of biological interactions
  using VisANT’s metagraph capability. VisANT [] is an integrative software platform
  for the visualization, mining, analysis and modeling of biological networks. This
  software extends the applications of GO for network visualization, analysis and
  inference. The image shows the biological networks between the molecules that belong
  to the VEGF signaling pathway. (1) VEGF, (2) VEGFR2, (3) COX2 and (4) p33.
