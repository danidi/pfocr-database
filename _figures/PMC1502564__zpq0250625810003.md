caption: Model diagrams indicating regulation and function of E47 activity. (A) Model
  diagram depicting the effects of pre-TCR signaling on E2A function. Signals from
  the pre-TCR complex abrogate the inhibitory effect of E2A proteins on the proliferation
  and differentiation of DN3 thymocytes to the DP stage. However, pre-TCR signaling
  also induces a function of E2A proteins in the down-regulation of CD25 expression.
  The asterisk indicates novel E-protein activities in response to pre-TCR signaling.
  Genes regulated by E47 in E2A-deficient lymphomas and during β selection are indicated.
  (B) Model diagram showing a regulatory network involving cytokine receptor-mediated
  signaling, E47, and SOCS activities in a common pathway. (C) Similarities of regulatory
  networks in D. melanogaster sensory organ development and T lineage cells.
