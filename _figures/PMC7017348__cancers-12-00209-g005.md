caption: Multi-component feedback loops and multi-component signaling networks involving
  SNAIL and non-coding RNAs. (A) Negative regulation between SNAIL and miR-182. (B)
  Negative regulation between SNAIL and miR-203. (C) Negative regulation between SNAIL
  and miR-34. (D) Feedback loop between SNAIL, miR-493, and IGF1R. (E) Feedback loop
  between SNAIL, circ-ZNF652, miR-203, and miR-502-5p. (F) Signaling pathway involving
  SNAIL, β-catenin, miR-146a, and Numb. (G) Signaling pathway involving SNAIL, ZEB1,
  miR-200a, and circ-ZEB1. (H) Negative regulation between SLUG and miR-203. (I) Negative
  regulation among SLUG, miR-1, and miR-200. (J) Signaling pathway involving SNAIL,
  ZEB1, miR-200c, and FN1 ceRNA.
