caption: Crosstalk of hypoxia-induced endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) signaling
  pathways. Under hypoxic conditions, transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1α
  (HIF-1α) protein is accumulated and functionally activated, which induces the expression
  of genes associated with EndMT, such as Notch1, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β),
  and runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), and the stabilization of Snail
  and Slug. RUNX3 is likely to be a direct target of HIF-1α, which can stabilize the
  Notch-ICD. The Notch-ICD also promotes the expression of EndMT-associated genes.
  Hypoxia can also activate the TGF-β signaling pathway through Smad2/3 proteins to
  induce EndMT transcription factor expression. ICD, intracellular domain.
