caption: 'Model of mutant epidermal growth factor receptor endocytic trafficking.
  Upon ligand binding, activated wtEGFR becomes internalized and localized to endosomes.
  Internalized EGFR has been linked to Erk and Akt activation. Depending on type of
  ligand bound, ligand concentration, dimerization partner, mutational statuses and/or
  availability of other regulators, wtEGFR may recycle to cell surface or be sorted
  to lysosomes. EGFR bound to EGF is mostly targeted for lysosomes, where it becomes
  degraded. Sorting of ligand-induced wtEGFR to lysosome is mediated by E3 ubiquitin
  ligase Cbl which remains attached to receptor throughout endocytosis. Mutant EGFR,
  however, escapes ligand-induced downregulation through decreased interaction with
  Cbl, enhanced dimerization with ErbB2, which prefers recycling pathway, and/or constitutive
  interaction with Src, which antagonizes Cbl. EGFR: Epidermal growth factor receptor.'
