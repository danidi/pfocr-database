caption: '1) Ischemia and/or reperfusion damages cells and tissues by increased ROS
  and energy depletion which mediated by mitochondrial damage. 2) MB preserves mitochondria
  function, and increases intracellular O2 concentration and glucose uptake which
  culminate in restoration of ATP. 3) Increased energy production increases endogenous
  pyruvate and other glycolytic metabolites, which stabilize HIF-1α . Additionally,
  4) MB enhances nuclear translocation of HIF-1α followed by activation of HIF-1.
  5) HIF-1 activation stimulates several protein synthesis, including EPO. Activated
  EPO in turn activate mTOR signaling pathway. Activated mTOR transcriptionally increases
  HIF-1α. Therefore, MB could make HIF-1 being involved with protection of HT22 cells
  against ischemia-reperfusion injury. HIF-1α: Hypoxia inducible factor-1α;EPO: Erythroppietin;
  mTOR: mammalian target of Raoanycin; ROS: reactive oxygen species; ↓ Positive effect;
  ↓ Negative effect; * Activation.'
