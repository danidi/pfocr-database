caption: Diagram of voltage-gated calcium channel subunit topology. Voltage-gated
  calcium channel subunit topology showing major drug binding mechanisms. Channel
  inhibition can be induced by modification of channel gating (blue arrows, gating
  modifiers) by interaction with extracellular regions within one or more of the four
  voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) (e.g., peptide toxins, such as ω-agatoxin IVA; section
  III.D.2), or within the activation gates of the pore domain (PD) channel, formed
  by all four S5–S6 helices together (e.g., DHP LTCC blocker; section III.D). Direct
  block of the pore from the extracellular side (by peptide toxins such as ω-conotoxin
  GVIA; section II.D.2) or small molecules (with access from the cytoplasmic side)
  can also target regions within the ion conducting pathway and obstruct permeation
  through the pore (black arrows; pore blockers). Some drugs also act through both
  mechanisms (e.g., phenylalkylamine LTCC blockers; section II.D.1). For structural
  features, also see . The α2δ ligands (magenta arrow) can modify channel trafficking.
