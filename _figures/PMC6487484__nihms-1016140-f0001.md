caption: At sites of cell-cell contact, the extracellular domains of E-cadherin bind
  to E-cadherins on neighboring cells to provide strong cell–cell adhesion, while
  the cytoplasmic domain recruits catenins, which in turn associate with additional
  cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins, such as vinculin and centralspindlin. In response
  to force, cadherin induces the activation of Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) which
  leads to the phosphorylation of vinculin at Y822. This signaling event is necessary
  for the activation of the Rho GTPase pathway, ultimately leading to cadherin-mediated
  cell stiffening. At cell-matrix adhesions activated integrins interact with the
  extracellular matrix on the outside of the cell, which triggers activation of intracellular
  signaling and recruitment of actin binding proteins, such as talin and vinculin.
  In response to force, the integrins recruit and activate two distinct signaling
  pathways that trigger recruitment of two RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factors,
  LARG and GEF-H1. These integrin-mediated signaling events are critical for the force-induced
  activation of RhoA and the reinforcement of integrin-actin linkages at the cell-matrix
  adhesions. Abl=Abelson tyrosine kinase; ROCK=Rho associated protein kinase; MLCK=myosin
  light chain kinase; MLC=myosin light chain; GEF-H1=guanine nucleotide exchange factor
  H1; LARG= leukemia-associated Rho-GEF; ECM=extracellular matrix
