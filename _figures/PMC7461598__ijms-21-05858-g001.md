caption: Processing of APP by secretases that leads to the formation of Alzheimer’s-associated
  Aβ peptides. In the amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by β- and γ-secretases
  leading to the formation of Aβ peptides and AICD. Formation of the neurotoxic Aβ
  is the major cause of AD. In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved by α-
  and γ-secretases leading to the genesis of p3 and AICD. APP, Amyloid precursor protein;
  sAPPα, Soluble APP alpha; sAPPβ, Soluble APP beta; αCTF 83, Alpha C-terminal fragment
  83; βCTF 99, Beta C-terminal fragment 99; AICD, APP intracellular domain.
