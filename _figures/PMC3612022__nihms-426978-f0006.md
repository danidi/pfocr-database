caption: Proposed synergistic pathway to mitotic cell death in cells treated with
  a combination of paclitaxel and gefitinib or the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536. When cells
  are treated with gefitinib in combination with paclitaxel, the up-regulation of
  the active form of CDC25C enhances the transition of cells through G2 phase and
  into M phase by activating cdc2 via dephosphorylation. p53 normally suppresses CDC25C
  and enhances the G2/M checkpoint. However, this suppression is lost in p53 null
  Hec50co cells. In absence of functional p53, p38 MAPK signaling through MK2 is the
  primary mechanism which inhibits CDC25C under baseline conditions; however, in the
  presence of gefitinib and paclitaxel, CDC25C activity is further enhanced. PLK1
  is required for both the G2/M phase transition and mitosis, and the effects of BI2536
  in this study are most likely due inhibiting PLK1 in mitosis.
