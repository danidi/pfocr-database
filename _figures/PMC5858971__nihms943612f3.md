caption: Various targeted agents that inhibit different nodes of the IL-6 signalling
  pathway have been developed. Siltuximab, sirukumab, olokizumab, clazakizumab, and
  MEDI5117 are anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies. Tocilizumab and sarilumab are monoclonal
  antibodies that target IL-6R. These antibodies inhibit both the classic and trans-signalling
  pathways. By contrast, the gp130–Fc fusion protein olamkicept inhibits IL-6 trans-signalling
  but not the classic signalling pathway. Tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, pacritinib, and
  AZD1480 are small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target JAKs, preventing
  phosphorylation of STAT3. C188-9, OPB-31121, OPB-51602, and other Src homology domain
  2 (SH2) domain inhibitors interfere with STAT3 dimerization. The STAT3 antisense
  oligonucleotide AZD9150 binds to and causes the destruction of STAT3 mRNA, thus
  decreasing STAT3 expression. The cyclic STAT3 decoy contains a nucleotide sequence
  derived from the promoter of the STAT3 target gene FOS. This decoy competitively
  inhibits STAT3 binding to genomic response elements in the promoter regions of target
  genes.
