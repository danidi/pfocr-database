caption: cAMP regulates immune response of astrocytes. The increase in astrocytic
  cAMP induces A20 and IкB, both of which suppress the activation of NF-кB. cAMP increase
  can reduce the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), ICAM-1,
  NO, and C3. cAMP increase has also been shown to either increase of decrease the
  expression of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). In combination with TNFα, astrocytic
  cAMP increase can result in the increased expression of IL-1Ra and IL-6. Arrows
  indicate activating pathways. T-bars indicate inhibiting pathways.
