caption: 'The HBP pathway produces the nucleotide sugar UDP-GlcNAc in a nutrient-dependent
  manner. UDP-GlcNAc is critical for most kinds of glycosylation including N-glycosylation,
  O-GalNAc-based glycosylation and O-GlcNAcylation. In this sense, glycan structures
  are modified according to the metabolic status of the cell. The abnormal glycosylation
  which occurs in cancer cells can be attributed to abundance and availability of
  nucleotide sugars, acceptor substrates or cofactors in the same way as altered expression
  or activity, or mislocalization of glycosyltransferases. The most frequent abnormal
  glycosylations observed in CRC are increased branched- and sialylated-N-glycans,
  truncated mucin-type O-glycans, increased fucosylation and sialylation of Lewis
  antigens and increased O-GlcNAcylation. Green and red arrows indicate respectively
  increased and decreased availability of nutrients and nucleotide sugars, or expression
  or activity of glycosyltransferases in CRC. Acetyl-coA: acetyl-coenzyme A; Fru-6-P:
  fructose-6-phosphate; Glc-6-P: glucose-6-phosphate; GlcN-6-P: glucosamine-6-phosphate;
  GlcNAc-6-P: N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate; GlcNAc-1-P: N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate;
  Glu: glutamic acid; UTP: uridine triphosphate; PPi: inorganic pyrophosphate.'
