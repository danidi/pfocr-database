caption: 'Schematic of hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may
  promote T cell exhaustion and therefore Demodex proliferation, by analogy with what
  happens with tumors. This figure assembles information from tumor pathology, from
  studies on Demodex and rosacea, and from the hypothesis formulated in Fig. . In
  tumor pathology, it is known that tumors secrete VEGF, which favors their development
  through its pro-angiogenic properties, but also by favoring T cell exhaustion: when
  VEGF is bound by the VEGF receptor (VEGF-R2) present on CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes,
  inhibitory receptors, such as programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte
  antigen (CTLA-4), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin 3 domain (TIM-3), or lymphocyte
  activation gene 3 protein (LAG-3), are expressed on the lymphocyte surface []. When
  these receptors bind to their ligands, expressed by the tumors, this causes loss
  of lymphocyte function, with accumulation of regulatory T cells, reflecting T cell
  exhaustion []. In the skin, VEGF is produced by keratinocytes and fibroblasts under
  ultraviolet (UV) B induction [, ] and is increased in the dermis in rosacea, both
  in erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR) and papulopustular rosacea (PPR) []. VEGF
  may play the same role in rosacea as in tumor pathology and collaborate with the
  tolerogenic dendritic cells to induce T cell exhaustion. The PD-1 receptor, induced
  on the effector T cell surface by its synapse with VEGF, binds to the programmed
  death ligand 1 (PD-L1), expressed on the surface of tolerogenic dendritic cells:
  this synapse then causes a loss of T cell function []. Tolerogenic dendritic cells
  may be induced by the mite (Fig. ), thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) [], vitamin D3
  (1,25 D3) and/or glucocorticoids [, ], and production is also favored by VEGF [].
  The Demodex mite activates a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) pathway immune response
  [], which induces increased production of the cathelicidin peptide, LL-37, and subsequent
  angiogenesis and inflammation [, ]. As LL-37 stimulates the activity of endothelial
  cells after UV exposure and may lead to increased sensitivity to UVB radiation [,
  ], theoretically, Demodex mites may also contribute to a higher sensitivity of the
  skin to UVB. This suggests a vicious circle that includes mite proliferation, TLR2,
  LL-37, sensitivity to UVB, and VEGF, providing a physiopathogenic link between ETR
  and PPR'
