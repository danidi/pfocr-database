caption: (a) Epigenetic regulation of survivin in transformed cells. The promoter
  region of survivin is hypermehylated thus inhibiting TRAIL-dependent apoptotic signaling
  pathway. In contrast, hypomethylation of survivin promoter facilitates the binding
  of p53 repressing its transcriptional activation. (b) Epigenetic alterations represented
  in the methylation of TRAIL death receptors (DR4, DR5, DcR1, and DcR2) confer significant
  contributions to TRAIL-resistance in different type of tumors. Several DNA (Dmnt1&Dmnt3)
  and histone (KDM2B&KDM4A) methylases control the regulation of these receptors on
  the genomic level. Demethylation drugs such as azacitidine and decitabine as well
  as HDACIs like SAHA, TSA, and sodium butyrate can restore TRAIL sensitization.
