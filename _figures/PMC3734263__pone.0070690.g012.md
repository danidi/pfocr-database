caption: Following passage through the blood-brain barrier, 4-aminophenol and HMBA
  are conjugated with free fatty acids (FFA), preferentially arachidonic acid, to
  yield the potent TRPV1 activators AM404 and arvanil plus olvanil, respectively,
  a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). AM404, arvanil
  and olvanil then activate TRPV1 in brain nuclei, regulating descending antinociceptive
  pathways, possibly of serotoninergic origin, thereby reducing nociceptive neurotransmission
  in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In contrast to the other lipid metabolites,
  HPODA is produced by a FAAH-independent pathway and it does not seem to contribute
  to the antinociceptive action of 4-aminophenol, consistent with HPODA being produced
  in smaller quantities and being a less potent TRPV1 activator than AM404.
