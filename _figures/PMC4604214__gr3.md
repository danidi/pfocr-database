caption: 'Key Figure: Developmental and Disease-associated Pathways Regulated by Chromodomain
  Helicase DNA Binding Protein 7 (CHD7).CHD7 can affect the activity of several signalling
  pathways that control development. Established connections are in black and hypothetical
  interactions or associations are in blue. CHD7 regulates bone morphogenetic protein
  (Bmp4) expression  or interacts with SMAD1 to control BMP pathway genes implicated
  in heart development . CHD7 can either positively regulate orthodenticle homeobox
  2 (Otx2) expression during ear development , or repress Otx2 expression during early
  cerebellar development . The latter results in reduced fibroblast growth factor
  8 (Fgf8) expression and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. CHD7 can antagonize retinoic
  acid signalling in neuronal progenitors, and retinoic acid pathway inhibition can
  rescue inner ear defects, implying hyperactive retinoic acid signalling as a cause
  of inner ear defects . CHD7 interacts with SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 2
  (SOX2) in neural stem cells, and co-regulates the expression of the genes encoding
  Jagged 1 (Jag1), GLI family zinc finger 3 (Gli3), and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis
  viral oncogene neuroblastoma derived homolog (Mycn) , which might explain some overlapping
  phenotypes with Alagile, Feingold, and Pallister Hall syndromes, although this has
  not been proven. Noteworthy, autosomal dominant de novo mutations in SOX2 result
  in a phenotype that shares features with CHARGE syndrome such as eye and outer ear
  malformations, oesophageal atresia, hearing loss, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
  . CHD7 loss is associated with p53 pathway hyperactivation . The underlying mechanisms
  might include both direct effects of CHD7 on p53 gene expression and effects on
  rDNA transcription, leading to defects in ribosome biogenesis . CHD7 controls sema
  domain, immunoglobulin domain (Ig), short basic domain, secreted, (semaphorin) 3E
  (sema3e) expression, which may underlie defects in neural crest cell migration and
  olfactory development as well as being responsible for the clinical overlap with
  Kallmann syndrome . CHARGE and 22q11del syndromes show phenotypic overlap . The
  presumed shared developmental pathways have not been identified, but are likely
  to include shared CHD7 and T-box 1 (TBX1) target genes. CHARGE and Kabuki syndromes
  also show significant clinical overlap. The genes mutated in Kabuki syndrome, encoding
  lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) and lysine (K)-specific demethylase
  6A (KDM6A), encode histone modification enzymes that together might control CHD7
  recruitment to H3K4me1-marked enhancer regions. Therefore, CHD7, KMT2D, and KDM6A
  are expected to regulate the same target genes .'
