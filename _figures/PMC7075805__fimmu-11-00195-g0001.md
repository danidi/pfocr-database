caption: Schematic of calcium (Ca2+) regulation in a cell. Ca2+ entry is controlled
  by receptor-mediated Ca2+ (ROC) entry, transient receptor potential (TRP) channels,
  voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VOCC), and Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) activated
  by the STIM1 protein. Ca2+ efflux is mediated by plasma membrane (PM) Ca2+ ATPase
  (PMCA), Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), or Na+/Ca2+/K+ exchanger (NCKX). When the Ca2+-mobilizing
  agonist (e.g., receptor engagement by antigen) binds to ROC, it results in the activation
  of phospholipase C (PLC). PLC cleaves the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
  (PIP2) to generate the following second messengers, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate
  (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 binds to IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) located on the
  surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and activates the release of Ca2+. The
  release of Ca2+ from the ER and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) occurs through IP3R.
  When ER Ca2+ stores are depleted, STIM1 aggregates to the ER–PM junction. STIM1
  recruits the Orai1, and then the CRAC channel is activated. Influx of Ca2+ via Orai1
  induces the recruitment of TRPC1 from vesicles into the PM. SMOCs, second messenger-operated
  channels; GP, G proteins.
