caption: 'MUC1–ICAM-1 interactions regulate different heterotypic cell– cell adhesions.
  Phosphorylated MUC1-CT can contribute to Grb2–Sos-mediated activation of the Ras–ERK
  pathway or activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)-mediated signaling events. (B)
  MUC1-FGF1 interaction: FGF1 induces phosphorylation of the MUC1-CT on the YEKV motif
  via activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase c-Src which results in nuclear
  translocation of MUC1-CT to drive the transcription of β-catenin, estrogen receptor
  α (ERα) and p53 target genes. The MUC1-CT–HSP70/HSP90 interaction facilitates translocation
  of MUC1-CT to mitochondria, and attenuates activation of the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway in the response to stress. (C) MUC1-EGFR interaction: MUC1 binds to ErbB1
  (EGFR) following activation by EGF. This interaction is bridged by the secreted
  glycoprotein galectin-3. The interaction (between MUC1 and EGFR) inhibits EGF-stimulated
  ubiquitination and internalization of ErbB1, thus driving EGF-mediated downstream
  signaling events. (D) MUC1-HER2 interaction: Stimulation of BC cells with heregulin
  (HRG), a soluble ligand for HER2, leads to phosphphorylation of the MUC1-CT (at
  the YEKV motif). The phosphorylated MUC1-CT interacts with molecules such as γ-catenin
  and p120 catenin, following which the complex is translocated into the nucleus by
  Nup62, a nucleoprotein located on the nuclear pore. (E) Nuclear localization of
  MUC1-CT: The MUC1-CT interacts with the nucleoprotein Nup62, an interaction that
  regulates the transport of the MUC1-CT into the nucleus. In the nucleus, the MUC1-CT
  interacts with and regulates transcription of ERα, β-catenin, p120 catenin, STAT1
  and p53 target genes. (F) MUC4 mediated cell signaling in breast cancer cells: MUC4
  can bind to the receptor tyrosine kinase HER2 and alter its cellular signaling by
  activation of the PI3-kinase and Erk pathways. MUC4 induced phosphorylation of HER2
  leads to the inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad and an increase
  in expression of pro-survival proteins like Bcl-xL. (Abbreviations: Gal-3-Galectin
