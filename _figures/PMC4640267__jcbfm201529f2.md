caption: Schematic representation of metabolite labeling from [1-13C]glucose (Glc)
  or [2,4-13C2]β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) in neurons and astrocytes. In astrocytes,
  13C-labeled pyruvate C3 (Pyr) follows either the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH; •)
  or the pyruvate carboxylase (PC; ○) pathway, but only the PDH pathway in neurons.
  This scheme is limited to the first turn of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
  In neurons, half of the molecules of oxaloacetate (OAA) and aspartate (Asp) are
  labeled on C2 and the other half on C3 (half symbol). α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Ala,
  alanine; Ac-CoA, acetyl-CoA; Glu, glutamate; Gln, glutamine; GABA, γ-aminobutyric
  acid; Lac, lactate.
