caption: 'Regulation of CtrA levels and activity. (a) A more detailed pathway diagram
  of the regulatory network driving CtrA activation (orange) and CtrA degradation
  (blue), which was simplified in . Highlighted in brown: polar scaffolds PodJ and
  SpmX and the compartment-sensors PleD and DivK. The members of the pathways communicate
  via activation, inhibition, synthesis (of cdG), localization, transcriptional control
  (by CtrA and TacA), and degradation (by ClpXP and PdeA). Different arrowheads represent
  these distinct communication modes. (b) Snapshots of ClpXP dependent proteolysis
  as a function of cell cycle progression. Dark gray boxes represent active signaling
  function; white boxes represent a lack of activity. Divided boxes represent compartment-specific
  activity. Top: approximately 90 minutes into the cell cycle, ClpXP (purple and brown)
  degrades FtsZ (green) at the division plane. PleC phosphatase activity maintains
  low cdG levels and high CckA activity. High CckA activity maintains high CpdR~P
  levels, the inactive form. Middle: once compartmentalization completes, PleC is
  no longer present in the stalked compartment, deactivating CckA and promoting unphosphorylated
  CpdR (light brown) specifically in the stalked compartment. Unphosphorylated CpdR
  localizes ClpXP to the stalked pole and promotes degradation of the cdG phosphodiesterase,
  PdeA (dark blue). Bottom: once PdeA is degraded, cdG levels can rise again in the
  stalked compartment, allowing PopA to bind cdG and, with RcdA (light brown), direct
  CtrA (gray) to ClpXP for degradation.'
