caption: Cellular glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis and oxidative
  phosphorylation are two major energy-yielding pathways. Glucose is converted into
  pyruvate in the glycolytic pathway. The fate of pyruvate is dependent on many factors,
  of which oxygen availability is important. In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is
  converted into lactate by LDH-A in the cytoplasm. LDH-B converts lactate into pyruvate.
  ECAR is a measure of lactic acid levels, generated by anaerobic glycolysis. In aerobic
  conditions, pyruvate enters the citric acid cycle via the PDH complex, and is catabolized
  by oxidative phosphorylation, producing electrons that pass through the electron
  transport chain to pump protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Protons
  are accumulated in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and generates an electrochemical
  gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane that is used for ATP production
  by ATP synthase (complex Ѵ). OCR is a measure of oxygen utilization in cells and
  is an indicator of mitochondrial function. The conversion of glucose into lactate
  generates 2 ATP per glucose molecule as compared to 36 ATP per glucose molecule
  when the oxidative phosphorylation is used. 2-NBDG; 2-[N-(7-nitobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-amino]-2-deoxy-D
