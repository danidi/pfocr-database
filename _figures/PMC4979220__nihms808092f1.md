caption: Inflammation activates the NFκB pathway in tanycytes, specialised cells lining
  the third ventricle. Tanycytes express D2, the main T3 producing enzyme in the brain,
  the promoter of which contains NFκB responsive elements. Binding of NFκB increases
  D2 expression and activity, and this stimulates the conversion of T4 into T3. T3
  will enter adjacent neurons and bind to neuronal TRβ thereby regulating transcriptional
  activity of TRH. T3=tri-iodothyronine. TRβ=thyroid hormone receptor β. TRH=thyrotropin-releasing
  hormone. NFκB=nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells. D2=deiodinase
  type 2. T4=thyroxine.
