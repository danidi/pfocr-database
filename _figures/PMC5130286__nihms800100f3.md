caption: Working model. In this model, RPE/choroid aging induces the expression of
  miR-146a, which in turn represses the IL-6 and VEGF-A expression in RPE cells. Therefore
  miR-146a functions to alleviate the inflammatory and angiogenic response in the
  aging RPE/choroid. Regulation of IL-6 and VEGF-A is likely mediated by its target
  genes IRAK1, TRAF6, which function in the NFκB pathway.
