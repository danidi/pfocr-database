caption: 'The NO-sGC signalling pathway and potential drug targets under physiological
  and pathophysiological conditions. Under physiological conditions (A), NO, synthesised
  by NOS from l-arginine, activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) leading to the
  formation of cGMP and downstream effector mechanisms. sGC stimulators enhance the
  sensitivity of sGC to low levels of bioavailable NO. Under pathological condition
  (B) such as oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, e.g. superoxide (O2−) most
  likely derived from NADPH oxidases (NOX), affect the NO-sGC system by three mechanisms:
  Superoxide scavenges NO; superoxide induces eNOS uncoupling, reducing NO production
  and enhanced superoxide production; superoxide oxidises the NO receptor, sGC, rendering
  it unresponsive to NO activation. Potential therapeutic strategies to diminish oxidative
  stress include the application of NADPH oxidase inhibitors, eNOS recoupler such
  as BH4 or eNOS enhancer (AVE 9488), and sGC stimulators of reduced (Fe2+) or sGC
  activators of the oxidised (Fe3+) and haem-free (apo-) sGC'
