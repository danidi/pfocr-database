caption: (A) During cancer-driven emergency myelopoiesis, PD-1 is up-regulated on
  CMPs but mostly in GMPs and inhibits signaling and metabolic reprogramming mediated
  by growth factors driving emergency myelopoiesis, resulting in accumulation of immature
  myeloid cells and immunosuppressor MDSCs, and decreased systemic output of effector
  myeloid cells. (B) PD-1 ablation in myeloid cells promotes signaling and metabolic
  reprogramming mediated by growth factors of emergency myelopoiesis and leads to
  the output of effector myeloid cells with improved antigen-presenting function that
  drive T effector memory cell responses and antitumor protection. HSC, hematopoietic
  stem cell; CMP, common myeloid progenitor; GMP, granulocyte/monocyte progenitor;
  MDP, monocyte/dendritic cell progenitor; CDP, common dendritic cell progenitor;
  DC, dendritic cell; CSF, cancer-produced soluble factor.
