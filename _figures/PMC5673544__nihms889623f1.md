caption: The single-strand break induced by UV or platinum drugs (a) is recognized
  by damage-sensor molecules, such as XPC, followed by the binding of several other
  proteins, such as TFIIH, XPA, and RPA. TFIIH unwinds the DNA duplex, whereas XPA
  verifies the DNA damage by binding to the chemically altered nucleotides (b). Then,
  XPA allows for the binding of a complex of nucleases (ERCC1/XPF), which is directed
  to the damaged strand by RPA to create an incision 5’ to the lesion. After the 5’
  incision, RPA recruits a nuclease (XPG), which makes an incision on the 3’ side
  of the damaged lesion (c). Following this process, DNA polymerase synthesizes new
  DNA to replace the damage (d). XPA is deacetylated by SIRT1, leading to NER promotion
  by facilitating its interaction with RPA.
