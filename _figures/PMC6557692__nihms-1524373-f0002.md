caption: 'shows that pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α) activates the NF-κB complex
  (IκB/ReLa/p50). The activation of the NF-κB complex can cause an enhancement of
  MMP gene expression []. However, as noted, TNF-α/TNFR does not alter ADAMTS activity
  []. Other factors such as Fas Ligand (FasL) produced by macrophages can lead to
  apoptosis through pro-caspase activation []. Growth factors can also activate the
  PI3K/AKT1/mTor pathway and “cross-talk” with the TNF-α/TNFR pathway []. This, and
  other evidence suggests a complex network of interacting ligand/receptor activities
  that modulates downstream synovial fibroblast pathways associated with inflammatory
  arthritis []. was previously published: C. J. Malemud. Intracellular signaling pathways
