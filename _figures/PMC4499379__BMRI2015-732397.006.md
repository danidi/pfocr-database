caption: Cdc42-SRF signaling pathway regulates cytoskeletal genes that are important
  in the development and maintenance of cardiovascular structure and function. The
  schematic here is a simplified presentation of the cdc42 pathway with some of the
  main proteins, which are potential targets of the miRNAs from the miR-17-92 cluster
  and its paralogs, the miR-106a-363 and miR-106b-25 clusters. The targeting information
  has been obtained from the literature and from the bioinformatics search with TargetScan
  and http://www.microrna.org/ databases.
