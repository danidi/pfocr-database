caption: 'When mitochondria are damaged / depolarized, PINK1 is stabilized on the
  outer mitochondrial membrane where it auto-phosphorylates Ser228 and Ser402, signaling
  Parkin recruitment to the mitochondria. PINK1 phosphorylates Parkin at Ser65, likely
  causing a conformational change in Parkin so it can attach ubiquitin (UB) onto an
  outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) substrate. PINK1 also acts as an UB kinase and
  phosphorylates UB on Ser65, increasing binding affinity of Parkin for UB and tethering
  it to the mitochondria. This becomes a feed-forward loop allowing for further Parkin
  recruitment to damaged mitochondria and increases Parkin E3 ligase activity to further
  increase ubiquitination of outer mitochondrial membrane proteins. Autophagy adaptor
  proteins, such as NDP52 and optineurin, can bind to ubiquitinated proteins on the
  mitochondria, resulting in autophagosome recruitment to damaged mitochondria and
  their eventual degradation in the lysosome. PINK1 can also directly recruit NDP52
  and optineurin to mitochondria independent of Parkin to induce a low level of mitophagy.
  Potential targets for intervention for activation of this pathway are denoted by
  large red arrows and include: stabilization of PINK1 on the outer mitochondrial
  membrane or activation of its kinase activity, activation of USP8 to allow for mitochondrial
  translocation of Parkin, and inhibition of USP15 and / or USP30 to prevent deubiquitination
  of Parkin substrates, and activation of TOMM7 and HSPA1L or inactivation of SIAH3
  and BAG4 to promote Parkin mitochondrial translocation. Other potential therapeutic
  options include inducing a conformational change in Parkin to allow it to remain
  in its active state, creating a mimetic of PINK1 to increase phosphorylation of
  Parkin, or upregulating Parkin-independent mitophagy pathways.'
