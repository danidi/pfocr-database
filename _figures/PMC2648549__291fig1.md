caption: Intrachromosomal assay system to monitor SSA and BIR. (A) Schematic representation
  of the strains used. An HO cut site is present within the leu2 gene on chromosome
  III. Homology with only the right end of the break—the U2 end—is inserted centromere-distal
  to the cut site in direct orientation at the indicated distances. The endogenous
  HOcs at MAT, HML, and HMR loci has been deleted. Vertical bars represent the positions
  of the Asp718 restriction sites when the donor U2 is placed 25 kb away from the
  HOcs. (B) These strains can repair the break either by SSA, where the two U2 sequences
  anneal with each other, the noncomplementary tails are clipped off, and the gaps
  are filled in by new DNA synthesis; or by BIR, where the cut U2 strand-invades the
  donor U2 and a recombination-dependent replication fork is established to copy all
  the distal sequences. Repair by either mode gives rise to the same deletion product.
