caption: 'Fe-responsive proteins with relevance for photosynthesis in Cyanobacteria,
  Chlamydomonas, and land plants. Proteins that are discussed in this review for each
  species are presented (a) Fe-responsive proteins in Cyanobacteria, relatives to
  the ancestors of chloroplasts. On the outer membrane, Fe3+ is chelated by a siderophore
  and taken up through a TonB Dependent Transporter (TBDT). TonB spans the periplasmic
  space and the inner membrane to facilitate uptake through the TBDT. On the inner
  membrane, Fe is taken up as Fe3+ via the Fe Uptake Transporter, FutABC, system.
  Fe can also be taken up as Fe2+ after reduction, through Ferrous Iron Transporter
  B (FeoB). Fe is required for the photosynthetic electron transport chain. During
  Fe deficiency, Iron Stress Induced protein A (IsiA) can protect Photosystem I (PSI)
  and Ferredoxin (Fd) can be replaced by the non-Fe-requiring Flavodoxin (Fld) in
  several species. Two operons exist for Fe–S cluster assembly: Iron Sulfur Cluster
  (isc) and Sulfur Utilization Factor (suf). Fe is sequestered by ferritin molecules:
  bacterioferritin and MrgA. (b) Fe-responsive proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
  Chlamydomonas takes up Fe3+ by a ferric iron permease yeast homologue (FTR1) after
  Fe2+ is oxidized by Ferric Oxidase 1 (FOX1). Fe is sequestered in the vacuole via
  Vacuolar Iron Transporter 1 (VIT1) and can be exported from vacuoles via Natural
  Resistance Associated Macrophage-like Protein 3 (NRAMP3). Chloroplast Fe is sequestered
  by Ferritin (FER). The ROS-scavenging SuperOxide Dismutases (SOD), FeSOD and MnSOD,
  are regulated in response to Fe deficiency. (c) Fe-responsive proteins in the leaf
  mesophyll cell with a focus on chloroplast proteins. From the xylem, Fe can be loaded
  into the phloem by Oligo Peptide Transporter 3 (OPT3) or to the mesophyll cell.
  For import into the mesophyll cell, Fe is exported from the xylem by Yellow-Stripe
  Like 1/3 (YSL1/3) presumably in a Fe3+-nicocianamine (NA) complex. Fe3+ is reduced
  at the leaf plasma membrane by Ferric Reductase Oxidase 6 (FRO6) and Fe2+ is taken
  up into the cell. Fe is reduced at the chloroplast envelope by FRO7 and taken up
  into the stroma by Permease in Chloroplasts 1 (PIC1). ATP Binding Cassette (ABC)
  proteins, ABCI11, ABCI10, and ABCI12 may also take up Fe into the chloroplast. YSL4/6
  is proposed to be a chloroplast Fe exporter. Multiple Antibiotic Resistance1 (MAR1)
  may transport NA or citrate (CA) into the chloroplast to sequester free Fe. FER
  is also required to sequester Fe. Fe–S clusters are formed by the SUF pathway in
  the chloroplast and transfer molecules insert these Fe–S clusters into photosynthetic
  proteins. Heme and chlorophyll are produced in the tetrapyrrole pathway. Many enzymes
  for chlorophyll and heme production are Fe-responsive, including Genome Uncoupled
  5 (GUN5), Glutamyl-tRNA reductase 1 (HEMA1), and Copper Response Defect 1 (CRD1).
  Within the chloroplast, during Fe deficiency, ROS-scavenging molecules, Stromal
  Ascorbate Peroxidase (sAPX) and FeSOD are downregulated in Fe deficiency. Catalase
  (CAT) is maintained or slightly downregulated during Fe deficiency. Fe is sequestered
  in the vacuole, where it is imported by VIT1 and exported by NRAMP3/4. YSL4/6 may
  also be a vacuolar Fe exporter. (d) Fe requirement of photosynthetic electron transport
  chain proteins. Symbols are explained in the legend.'
