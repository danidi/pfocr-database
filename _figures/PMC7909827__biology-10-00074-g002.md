caption: 'Nutrient-secretion coupling in δ-cells. (A) Glucose stimulates δ-cell somatostatin
  secretion via both membrane potential-dependent (“Vm-dependent”) and -independent
  pathways (“Vm-independent”). Vm-dependent pathway: Glucose metabolism increases
  cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio and consequently closes KATP channels. The subsequent
  membrane depolarization leads to opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) and
  influx of [Ca2+]I to trigger exocytosis. Vm-independent pathway: ATP production
  stimulated by glucose metabolism restores luminal ER calcium levels through SERCA
  pump and elevates intracellular cAMP via adenylyl cyclase (AC). Whereas cAMP as
  a second messenger of PKA directly potentiates δ-cell exocytosis, its effect on
  activation of ryanodine receptor 3 (RyR3) and sensitization of calcium-induced calcium
  release (CICR) in sER is mediated by Epac2. Glucose also promotes somatostatin secretion
  by increasing [Na+]i via sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) and thereby
  increases [Ca2+]i through stimulation of intracellular Na+-Ca2+exchange (NCLX).
  The resultant elevation in [Ca2+]i triggers somatostatin secretion. (B) Free fatty
  acids inhibit somatostatin release by binding to non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA)-responsive
  G-protein coupled receptor 120 (GPR120) on δ-cells. Its downstream Gαi inhibits
  AC activity and decreases cAMP production, which in turn results in reduced activity
  of PKA. (C) The regulatory role of amino acids in δ-cells might resemble their actions
  in β-cells. We postulate that arginine could stimulate somatostatin secretion via
  electrogenic transport, thereby increasing membrane depolarization and [Ca2+]i through
  opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, while leucine-induced somatostatin secretion
  might involve transamination of leucine to α-ketoisocaproate, entry into tricarboxylic
  acid cycle (TCA) via acetyl-CoA, ATP generation and closure of KATP channels. GLUT,
