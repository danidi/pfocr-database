caption: Long non-coding RNA acting within the NODAL signalling pathway. The TGFβ
  family protein NODAL (green) binds to a transmembrane receptor (ActRI, ActRII).
  Binding requires the co-factor EGF-CFC2 and can be inhibited by LEFTY1/2 or DAND5
  (red). Receptor activation leads to phosphorylation of SMAD2/3, which recruits SMAD4
  and translocates across the nuclear membrane (dashed line). SMAD2/3 can be inhibited
  by SMAD7. The SMAD2/3/4 complex binds DNA in cooperation with tissue-specific transcription
  factors such as FOXH1, leading to transcription of target genes including Pitx2c,
  Nodal, Lefty2 and Smad7. mRNA are indicated in the diagram in blue, while long non-coding
  RNA (lncRNA) are indicated in green and miRNA in red. Cytoplasmic lncRNA known to
  regulate NODAL pathway genes include Gas5 (growth arrest specific), which can bind
  to and inhibit SMADs through its RNA SMAD binding element (rSBE) or act as an endogenous
  competitor to inhibit miRNAs targeting Nodal, Lefty2 or Acvr1. Nuclear lncRNA are
  illustrated in the lower part of the diagram. Fendrr (fetal-lethal noncoding developmental
  regulatory RNA) can recruit PRC2 (polycomb repressive complex 2) to the Pitx2 locus,
  leading to trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27. This inhibits binding by SMAD2/3/4
  and prevents transcription. Meg3 (maternal expressed gene) similarly recruits PRC2
  to the Smad2 locus. Smad7 expression is regulated by an enhancer RNA (eRNA) which
  promotes expression. Playrr (Pitx2 locus-asymmetric regulated RNA) mediates a chromatin-looping
  mechanism to regulate Pitx2 expression.
