caption: E2 suppressed the NFκB-induced increases of NOS2 through (1) maintenance
  of steady level of inhibitor IκBα in the cytoplasm; (2) prevention of cytosolic
  NFκB from translocation into the nucleus; and (3) interference of NFκB binding onto
  the NOS2 promoter DNA by physical association of ERβ with NFκB.
