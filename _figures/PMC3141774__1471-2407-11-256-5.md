caption: Ca 2+ signal cross talk between Epac and Gβγ. Activation of GPCR releases
  two signaling molecules, Gα and Gβγ. Gα activates cAMP production, leading to Ca
  2+ release from IP3 receptor in the ER via Epac/PLC/IP3 pathway. Ca 2+ release from
  IP3 receptor induces cell migration. On the other hand, Gβγ stimulates Ca 2+ influx
  from the extracellular space, leading to activation of calmodulin and the following
  inactivation of IP3 receptor. Finally, Gβγ inhibits Epac-induced Ca 2+ release from
  the ER, leading to inhibition of cell migration.
