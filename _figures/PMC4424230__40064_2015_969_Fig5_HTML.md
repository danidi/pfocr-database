caption: The elevation of the inflammatory indices, the proliferative signaling and
  the activation of the ROS-eliminating system. Outline of the results obtained so
  far. The level of inflammatory indices (TNF-α, GOT, GPT), the proliferative signaling
  (IL-6/STAT3 pathway), and the proliferative marker (histone H3) are investigated
  in the previous paper (Obayashi et al. ).
