caption: Catalytic cycle of Prx2. The peroxidatic cysteine thiol (-SH) of active Prx2
  can reduce H2O2 to form a sulfenic acid (-SOH). In turn, this adduct either can
  be reduced by another active Prx2 to form an intermolecular disulfide bond (S—S)
  or can be overoxidized to produce sulfinic acid (-SO2H). Both the disulfide bond
  and overoxidized form can be regenerated to their active states by coordinated action
  of the thioredoxin (Trx) pathway [NADPH, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase
  (TrxR)] or by the reductase Srxn1.
