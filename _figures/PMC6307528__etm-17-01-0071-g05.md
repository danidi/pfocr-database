caption: Crosstalk between the Rho kinase and BMP-2 signaling pathways. Crosstalk
  between the Rho kinase and BMP-2 signaling pathways occur via the phosphorylation
  of the Smad1 linker region, which leads to the degradation or phosphorylation of
  its C-terminal, resulting in its translocation into the nucleus. Linker region phosphorylation
  following the activation of the RHO kinase signaling pathway leads to Smad1 ubiquitination
  and degradation. The C-terminus phosphorylation of Smad1 induced by BMP-2 leads
  to nuclear the translocation of this protein. PDGF-BB, platelet derived growth factor-BB;
  Smad1, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 1; BMP-2, bone morphogenetic protein
  2; p, phosphorylated; ub, ubiquitination; RhoA, transforming protein RhoA; GTP,
  guanosine triphosphate; GDP, guanosine diphosphate; Co-Smads, common mediator mothers
  against decapentaplegic homologs; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase;
  ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MH, mad homology domain.
