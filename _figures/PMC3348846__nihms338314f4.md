caption: 'Cooperative role of ROS and NO in angiogenesis. (A) Generation of VEGF by
  macrophages. Both ROS (red pathways) and NO (blue pathways) generated during hypoxia/inflammation
  can decrease PHD activity, which activates the HIF pathway as well as the NF-κB
  pathway. The HIF pathway leads to transcription of VEGF. The NF-κB pathway leads
  to transcription of inflammatory cytokines. During the inflammatory response the
  NF-κB predominates, and during the resolution of the inflammatory response the HIF
  pathway predominates. NO modulates both pathways at several points, being stimulatory
  in the HIF pathway and inhibitory in the NF-κB pathway. (B) Initiation of angiogenesis:
  endothelial destabilization. VEGF derived from macrophages or recruited endothelial
  progenitor cells (EPC) interacts with VEGF receptor (VEGFR) on selected endothelial
  “tip” cells to initiate cell migration. VEGFR ligation activates both eNOS and NOX
  to generate NO and superoxide, respectively. NO (blue pathways) is involved in (1)
  loosening of the adherens junctions and (2) MMP activation and TIMP inhibition to
  facilitate degradation of the ECM. Superoxide (red pathways) is involved in (1)
  formation of lamellipodia and (2) cyclic alterations in the strength of focal adhesion
  complexes (FACs). The migratory tip cells are followed by hyperpermeable (destabilized
  junctions) stalk cells.'
