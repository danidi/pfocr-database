caption: 'Impact of high dietary protein on lipid metabolism in porcine adipose tissue
  at body weight 100 kg. ↑: up-regulation of gene expression or increased concentration
  of metabolites. ↓: down-regulation of gene expression or enzyme activity or decreased
  concentration of metabolite. +: enhanced metabolic pathway; -: diminished metabolic
  pathway. At body weight 30 kg, there were no differences except that gene expression
  of FAS was up-regulated.'
