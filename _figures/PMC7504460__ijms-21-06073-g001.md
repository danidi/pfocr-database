caption: 'Potential mechanisms of obesity-induced development of endometrial cancer
  (EC). Obesity induces increased aromatase expression and chronic low-grade inflammation
  in adipose tissues that play fundamental roles in EC development. The former results
  in increased estradiol (E2) production, and the latter triggers expression of various
  adipokines, cytokines, and chemokines, leading to insulin resistance. Insulin resistance
  causes hyperglycemia, which induces insulin synthesis in the spleen and lipogenesis
  in the liver. The former subsequently induces hyperinsulinemia, and the latter causes
  decreased expression of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), leading to enhanced
  E2 activity. Hyperinsulinemia plays central roles in promoting EC growth via decreased
  insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) 1 with enhanced insulin-like
  growth factor (IGF)-1 activity and most importantly, switching on of insulin-phosphoinositide
  3 kinase (insulin-PI3K) signaling in EC cells. Δ4A: androstenedione, 17β-HSD: 17β-Hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenases, T: testosterone, ER: estrogen receptor, adinoR1: adiponectin receptor
