caption: Known and novel roles of the p38-MK2/3 signaling pathway in cross-striated
  muscles. In this model, we summarize previously established Ca2+/calcineurin signaling-dependent
  gene expression (, ) and contractile activity-dependent induction of the p38 pathway
  () (gray arrows with two gray lines). We also highlight known effects of p38 signaling
  on, e.g., the expression of fast MyHCIId/x () and PGC-1α (), as well as reported
  downstream effects of PGC-1α (, ) (black arrows). The latter results were extended
  in the current study to show that MK2/3 deficiency results in a shift toward slow
  fiber type I and oxidative energy metabolism. MK2/3 regulates SERCA2 gene transcription
  via altered Egr-1 binding, and elevated SERCA2a induced by MK2/3 deficiency enhances
  cross-striated muscle function. Changes arising due to MK2/3 deficiency are denoted
  in red (↑, upregulation; ↓, downregulation, X, abrogation of signaling). [Ca2+]i,
  intracellular Ca2+ concentration; TFs, transcription factors; NFAT, nuclear factor
  of activated T cells; ERRα, estrogen-related receptor alpha.
