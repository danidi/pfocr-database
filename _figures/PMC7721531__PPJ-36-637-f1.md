caption: Simplified scheme of the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway. The phenylpropanoid
  biosynthetic pathway (PPP) channels carbon from L‑phenylalanine (Phe) to a large
  number of polyphenols. The general PPP beings with Phe which is converted to trans‑cinnamic
  acid (t‑CA) by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia lyase. t‑CA is then reduced to para‑coumaric
  acid (p‑CA) which is activated to yield p‑coumaroyl‑CoA. p(ara)‑Coumaroyl‑CoA is
  the branch‑point metabolite of all flavonoid and non‑flavonoid polyphenols. The
  compounds tested in this study are highlighted in red.
