caption: A green box means that one or more isoenzymes of this reaction is down-regulated
  in the phosphoketolase over-expressing strain relative to the wild type. A red box
  indicates up-regulation. A blue box shows that some genes with this function are
  up-regulated while others are down-regulated. A grey box indicates that a gene could
  not be assigned to this function. The map was adapted from a map of A. niger metabolism
  published by Andersen et al .
