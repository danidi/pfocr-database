caption: Cell surface HSPGs consists of a protein core linking several linear heparan
  sulfate (HS) chains. HS chains ensure CCN2 bind to the cell surface, and decisively
  regulate their accessibility, LRP6 phosphorylation, and Wnt activation. Co-incubation
  of LMWH with CCN2 could significantly block the adhesion of CCN2 to cell surface
  HSPG, and inhibit the function of CCN2. Oxaliplatin could upregulate CCN2 expression
  and activate Wnt signaling, while, co-incubation of CCN2 with heparin also completely
  blocked the adhesion between LRP6 and CCN2, and activation of Wnt signaling pathway
