caption: The plasticity of EZH2 in regulating MMP-mediated invasion pathway. The activation
  of HIF1-α attenuates the Ezh2/PRC2-H3K27me3 epigenetic repression of MMPs by selectively
  inhibiting the expression of EED and SUZ12. A discrete Ezh2 forms a protein complex
  with FoxM1 to promote MMP-mediated invasion pathway. The combination effects of
  inhibition of PRC2 activity and induction of Ezh2-FoxM1 complex, upon HIF1-α activation,
  enhances invasion pathway in breast cancer.
