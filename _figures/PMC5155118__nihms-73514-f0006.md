caption: 'PI3K/PLC-signaling: Upon cAMP stimulation, both PI3K and PLC are activated
  and both target PIP2. Phosphorylation of PIP2 by PI3K produces PIP3, while hydrolysis
  by PLC produces IP3 and DAG. PIP3 recruits PH domain proteins to the membrane, where
  they become functionally active. Pathway components, including CRAC, Akt/PKBR1,
  and TORC2, mediate chemotactic response. Loss of either PI3K or PLC reduces PIP3-signaling,
  but chemotaxis can proceed in the presence of a fully functional PLA2pathway ().PLA2/Ca2+-signaling:
  Upon cAMP stimulation, there is an activation of PLA2 and an influx of Ca2+. Ca2+
  influx is linked to the IP3/IplA-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.
  PLA2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipid (PL) to fatty acid, like arachidonate
  (AA), and lysophospholipid (LysoPL). AA-signaling is a primary mediator of chemotaxis,
  although Ca2+ can enhance the response. In the absence of PLA2, chemotaxis can proceed
  in the presence of a fully functional PI3K pathway ().Inhibition of PI3K, PLC, PLA2
  and Ca2+-signaling has a more severe impact than if only PI3K and PLA2 are inhibited.GC-signaling:
  Two guanylyl cyclases (GC), GCA and sGC, regulate cGMP production in response to
  extracellular cAMP signaling. GCA is constitutively membrane-bound; sGC is localized
  to the cytosol of unstimulated cells, but is recruited to the leading edge during
  chemotaxis (see ), where it becomes activated. The predominant GC activity during
  aggregation is sGC. The cGMP-binding protein GbpC acts downstream of cGMP to regulate
  myosin filament formation at the cell posterior (see ) and suppress lateral pseudopod
  formation.Cells lacking both GCA and sGC do not have detectable GC activity and
  exhibit chemotactic defects to low concentrations of cAMP. In the absence of PI3K/PLA2,
  chemotaxis can proceed in polarized cells that express fully functional GC pathways,
  but not in gca/sgc-nulls cells (). Expression of a catalytically inactive version
  of sGC that can still localize to the cell anterior can partially rescue chemotaxis
  in gca/sgc-nulls cells that are also inhibited for PI3K-and PLA2- signaling. In
  contrast, cAMP-stimulated accumulation of cGMP in the absence of anteriorly localized
  sGC is insufficient for such rescue.'
