caption: 'A combinatorial approach to suppression of cancer growth that employs 4-HPR
  and tamoxifen. Using prostate cancer cells (PC-3) as an example, 4-HPR activates
  SPT. This step forms sphinganine that is used for synthesis of ceramides, a process
  resulting in ceramide production. The addition of tamoxifen blocks cellular conversion
  of ceramide to GC, resulting in ceramide buildup (up arrows) with concurrent magnification
  of ceramide cancer suppressor effects. Tamoxifen also inhibits AC, a vital enzymatic
  junction. This inhibition leads to diminished levels of sphingosine that in turn
  limit production of mitogenic S1P. Not depicted here: the de novo pathway intermediates
  of ceramide biosynthesis and the impact of 4-HPR on dihydroceramide desaturase.
  SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase; GC, glucosylceramide; AC, acid ceramidase; P-gp,
  P-glycoprotein; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate.'
