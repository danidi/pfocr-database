caption: a) A methanol condensation cycle (MCC) which converts formaldehyde to acetyl-phosphate
  with 100% carbon efficiency. Acetate can be generated enzymatically. b) A molecular
  purge valve which dissipates reducing power in order to convert pyruvate to polyhydroxybutyrate
  (PHB) in a redox balanced way. c) A chimeric glycolysis system which converts glucose
  to lactate in a redox- and ATP-balanced route. It uses a non-phosphorylating GapN
  to maintain ATP balance. The corresponding route through standard Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  (EMP) glycolysis is shown with blue enzyme labels. d) Glucose to isoprene pathway
  which uses NADPH-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). An NADPH drain is required to maintain redox balance.
  This pathway is also ATP-balanced. G6P inhibition is also considered in this system.
