caption: Simplified model of mtFAS-dependent regulatory circuits controlling mitochondrial
  gene expression. MtFAS is needed for octanoyl-ACP production, the sole octanoate
  source for lipoic acid (LA) synthesis. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH)
  activity is part of a positive feedback loop (red and yellow circular arrow loop)
  with LA production and acetyl-CoA substrate production. The Krebs cycle and α-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase complex (α-KGDH) provide reducing power, succinate and precursors
  for heme biosynthesis. The arrows represent the flow of material and the requirement
  of products of the mtFAS pathway in LA synthesis, RPM1 RNA processing and respiratory
  complex assembly. RPM1 must be processed to assemble fully active RNase P for processing
  of the tRNA-containing RPM1 precursor RNA (second proposed positive feedback loop).
  Translation is needed for mRNA splicing, possibly resulting in mtFAS signal amplification
  (third proposed feedback loop). Some subunits of the cytochrome c reductase complex
  (III), cytochrome c oxidase complex (IV) and F1Fo ATP synthase (V) are translated
  in the mitochondria. The succinate dehydrogenase complex (II), as well as complexes
  III, IV and cytochrome c (c), require heme for their assembly and function.
