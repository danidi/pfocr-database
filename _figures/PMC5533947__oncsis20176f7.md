caption: Schematic model. In RCN1 downregulated cells, IP3R1 activation disturbs ER
  calcium homeostasis under conditions of ER stress, thus inducing UPR signaling,
  such as the PERK–CHOP pathway, and contributing to subsequent apoptosis. In addition,
  NF-κB, a transcription factor of RCN1, is activated by IRE1 and PERK during ER stress
  and then elevates the mRNA level of RCN1, constituting a feedback loop. RCN1 interacts
  with L3 of IP3R1 in a calcium-dependent manner, thereby inhibiting its function
  and ER calcium release. Therefore, RCN1 suppresses ER stress-induced apoptosis via
  calcium homeostasis and PERK–CHOP signaling.
