caption: The MRN complex or Ku70/80 heterodimer recognizes and binds directly to broken
  DNA ends. The MRN complex recruits CtIP and BRCA1/PALB2/BRCA2 to initiate its preferred
  homologous recombination (HR). At the same time, MRN complex also recruits and activates
  ATM, which is involved in the initiation a serial of phosphorylation events including
  γH2AX. As presented in , γH2AX and H2AX-dependent signal transduction events are
  required for the sustained accumulation of many DNA damage response and repair proteins
  at DSB sites to facilitate DNA repair processes. If the broken DNA ends are recognized
  by Ku70/80, it then recruits DNA-PKcs and other NHEJ components to carry out end
  joining reactions. NHEJ is now suggested to be mediated by two sub-pathways, the
  lig IV-dependent classic NHEJ pathway (C-NHEJ) and the lig IV-independent alternative
  end joining pathway (A-NHEJ). It is worth pointing out that the recruitment of MRN
  complex, 53BP1, and BRCA1 to DSB sites may facilitate NHEJ, especially the A-NHEJ
  pathway.
