caption: Potential targets of helper component proteinase (HCPro) in the antiviral
  RNA silencing pathway. Simplified schematic representation of the RNA silencing‐mediated
  defences in plants that are deployed against RNA viruses. Steps of the cascade at
  which HCPro from different potyvirids may be acting in order to block this defensive
  response are indicated. AGO, Argonaute protein; DCL, Dicer‐like protein; DRB, double‐stranded
  RNA‐binding protein; HEN1, HUA enhancer 1; RDR, RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase; RISC,
  RNA‐induced silencing complex; SGS3, supressor of gene silencing 3.
