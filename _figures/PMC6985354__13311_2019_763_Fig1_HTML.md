caption: Therapeutic targets for SCA1. Although polyQ expansion of ATXN1 underlies
  the pathophysiology of SCA1, there are many pathways that are disrupted, contributing
  to debilitating symptoms as well as disease progression. Several of these pathways
  present viable targets for disease modification and symptom improvement. ATXN1 translocates
  to the nucleus to influence gene transcription. Transcriptional targets that are
  particularly relevant to disease include potassium channels and vascular endothelial
  growth factor A (VEGF). Mutant ATXN1 can be targeted directly, or through targeting
  the kinases in the RAS-MAPK-MSK1 pathway, which enhance the stability of ATXN1 through
  its phosphorylation. Other targets relevant to disease biology are the metabotropic
  glutamate receptor (mGluR1) and proteostasis
