caption: The network of reactions that potentially participate in Cho synthesis in
  flowering plants. Note that P-bases are converted to Ptd-bases via cytidyldiphospho-base
  intermediates, which have been omitted for simplicity. Enzymes mediating the free
  base and P-base methylations are cytosolic (; ); those mediating Ptd-base methylations
  are microsomal (). The two-step chloroplastic pathway leading to GlyBet is also
  shown; this step is only present in certain species (e.g. Chenopodiaceae) and is
  absent from wild-type tobacco. Bet ald, Betaine aldehyde.
