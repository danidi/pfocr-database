caption: Toll-like receptor pathway showing M. marinum expression data. RNAseq expression
  data shows M. marinum E11-infected zebrafish at 5 dpi. The green and magenta boxes
  show up- and downregulation of the differential expression (FC >2 or <−2), respectively,
  with a P value smaller than 0.05. The asterisks show genes that are discontinued
  in current databases, the white boxes show genes that could not be identified and
  the grey boxes show genes that did not meet the expression criteria
