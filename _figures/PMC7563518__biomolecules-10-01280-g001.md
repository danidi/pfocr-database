caption: Metabolic pathways of l-tryptophan (a) and l-arginine (b). (a) l-Tryptophan
  is metabolized by two main pathways, i.e., the kynurenine pathway and the serotonin
  pathway. The kynurenine pathway (light blue arrow) converts approximately the 99%
  of ingested l-tryptophan and starts with the transformation of l-tryptophan into
  N-formylkynurenine by the enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), indoleamine
  2,3-dioxygenase 2 (IDO2), and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2). N-Formylkynurenine
  is rapidly degraded by formamidase to yield l-kynurenine, which is then converted
  into kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, or anthranilic acid via kynurenine aminotransferase
  (KATs), kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), and kynureninase, respectively. 3-hydroxykynurenine
  is converted into 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid, which is in turn metabolized by 3-hydroxyamino
  oxidase (3-HAO) into 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde. This metabolite can
  spontaneously rearrange to form quinolinic acid (QUIN), which is used for the synthesis
  of nicotinamide adenindinucleotide (NAD+) via quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase
  (QPRT). Additional lateral branches of the kynurenine pathway lead to the formation
  of other terminal products, including xanthurenic acid and cinnabarinic acid. The
  serotonin pathway (orange arrow) converts approximately the 1% of ingested l-tryptophan
  and starts with the transformation of l-tryptophan into 5-hydroxytryptophan by two
  isoforms of the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH1 and TPH2). 5-Hydroxytryptophan
  is sequentially converted into 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (serotonin), N-acetyl-5-hydroxy-tryptamine
  (N-acetylserotonin), and N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine (melatonin) by the enzymes
  aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC), arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT),
  and N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT), respectively. (b) l-Arginine is
  degraded by two major families of enzymes, i.e., nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and
  arginases (ARG). NOS exists in three isoforms (NOS1, NOS2, NOS3) and catalyzes the
  conversion of l-arginine into NO and l-citrulline, which is recycled back into l-arginine
  by the sequential action of argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) and argininosuccinate
  synthetase (ASS) (pink arrow). ARG exists in two isoforms (ARG1 and ARG2) and catalyzes
  the degradation of l-arginine into l-ornithine and urea. l- Ornithine acts as a
  substrate of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT), and
  ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) to yield putrescine, proline, and l-citrulline,
  respectively. Putrescine is sequentially converted into spermidine and spermine,
  through the sequential action of spermidine synthase (SDS) and spermine synthase
  (SMS) (green arrow).
