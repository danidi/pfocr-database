caption: 'Metabolic profile of cancer cells. Schema describing the metabolic reprogramming
  of tumor cells with increased glucose uptake and glycolysis that is uncoupled from
  oxidative phosphorylation. Cancer cell metabolism is characterized by enhanced glycolysis
  and the phosphate pentose pathway. This aerobic glycolytic phenotype, however, confers
  the generation of high amounts of lactate. Abbreviations: TCA, tricarboxylic acid;
  ETC, electron transport chain.'
