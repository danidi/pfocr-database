caption: . Gut microbiota contribute to host energy absorption through the direct/indirect
  ways. Food intake alters the composition of the gut microbiota and the gut microbiota
  influences host energy absorption directly or indirectly while the nutrients are
  traveling in the intestine. The nutrients, which are obtained from a meal, undergo
  one of three routes during the digestive processes in the intestine, in face of
  energy metabolism, or the remains of them are excreted from the body. First, the
  nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids are digested and degraded
  with digestive enzymes and then absorbed into the host. Second, gut microbiota directly
  consume nutrients as their energy source. Lastly, the nutrients can be converted
  into metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; acetate, butyrate, and
  propionate), trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), and indole propionate (IPA) by the gut
  microbiota. The gut microbiota producing metabolites are absorbed and circulated
  in the host. Acetate reduces the fat accumulation by stimulating the AMPK-peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) pathway and G-protein-coupled receptor
  43 (GPR43) in the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT), respectively []. Butyrate
  induces intestinal gluconeogenesis (IGN) via cAMP signal and decreases hepatic fat
  accumulation by GPR43 and releases phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase (p-HSL)
  by adrenergic β3 receptor (ARβ3). Moreover, butyrate activates thermogenesis in
  brown adipose tissue (BAT) and transformation to oxidative fibers in the skeletal
  muscle via the AMPK-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator
  1α (PGC1α) pathway. Propionate, a precursor of glucose in tissues, stimulates IGN
  and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Gastrointestinal microbiome-producing SCFAs release
  gut hormones (glucagon like peptide-1 [GLP-1], peptide YY [PYY], cholecystokinin
  [CCK]) from enteroendocrine cells by stimulating GPR43. The gut hormones regulate
  appetite and satiety. Besides producing SCFAs, the gut microbiota can also produce
  TMAO, which is a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease. The IPA, which is
  produced from tryptophan by the gastrointestinal microbiome, improves insulin secretion.
  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), produced by gram-negative bacteria, promote metabolic
  disease thought induction of inflammation as an endotoxin. Succinate, which fermented
  from dietary fiber by gut bacteria, activates IGN, resulting improving metabolic
  disease such as glucose homeostasis. Additionally, gut microbiota can convert primary
  bile acids into secondary bile acids in the intestine. The bile acids bind G protein-coupled
  bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) upon the enteroendocrine cell and function as farnesoid
  X receptor (FXR) agonist. FFA, free fatty acid; AA, amino acid.
