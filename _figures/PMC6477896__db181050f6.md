caption: A proposed model of how nutrition-sensing factors regulate vitamin D metabolism
  in response to fasting and diabetes. We proposed that at least two molecular pathways
  are involved in the suppression of the CYP2R1 by fasting in the liver. These same
  metabolism-regulating pathways are activated in diabetes. The first one is mediated
  by the fasting-inducible cofactor PGC-1α through nuclear receptor ERRα. The second
  one is mediated through the cortisol/GR pathway. CYP2R1 repression results in suppression
  of vitamin D 25-hydroxylation, the first bioactivation step in the liver. On the
  other hand, fasting induces CYP24A1 in the kidney through a mechanism involving
  the PGC-1α-ERRα pathway. Induction of CYP24A1 is expected to induce catabolism of
  vitamin D. Suppression of the 25-hydroxylation in the liver and induction of the
  deactivation step in the kidney may lead to a lower plasma level of 25-OH-D and,
  in turn, vitamin D deficiency.
