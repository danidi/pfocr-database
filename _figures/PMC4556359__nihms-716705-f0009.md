caption: Model of the proposed RhoA/PKD1/NF-κB signaling pathway. Disruption of cell–cell
  contacts as mediated by calcium depletion leads to the activation of RhoA. Active
  RhoA leads to the activation of the PKD1. PKD1 activation by RhoA is facilitated
  through activation of SFK (Src family kinases) and nPKC (novel PKC enzymes). The
  RhoA downstream kinase ROCK regulates both, phosphorylations mediated by SFK and
  nPKC. Active PKD1 relays the signal to the transcription factor NF-κB, which has
  been described to have important functions in cell adhesion and survival. The target
  genes for NF-κB in this signaling pathway are not defined, yet.
