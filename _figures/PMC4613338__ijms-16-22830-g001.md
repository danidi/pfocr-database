caption: Glutamine metabolism and potent targets for cancer therapy. After transporting
  into cytosol by LAT1 (l-type amino acid transporters 1), ASCT2 (system ASC amino
  acid transporters 2) and other transporters, glutamine is catalyzed by glutaminase
  and converts to glutamate and ammonia. It then provides macromolecular material
  for ammonia acid and lipid syntheses. Glutamine is also used to exchange EAAs, which
  could activate mTOR and promote cell growth. Glutamate is also used to exchange
  extracellular cysteine for GSH production. GLS is a key enzyme for glutamine metabolism,
  which can be inhibited by several inhibitors including 968, BPTES and CB-839, accompanying
  with other inhibitors of glutamine metabolism are shown in red circle. GLS, glutaminase;
