caption: cGAS and STING possess alternative functions that diverge from the uniaxial
  and canonical cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway, exerting effects that are independent from
  each other. Nuclear translocation of cytosolic cGAS has been shown to drive tumorigenesis
  through the blockade of HR repair in a STING-independent manner. Breakdown of the
  nuclear membrane in mitosis has been suggested to allow nuclear entry of cytosolic
  cGAS, which remains catalytically active and binds to centromeric satellites and
  LINE DNA repeats. On the other hand, STING can also be activated in a cGAS-independent
  manner. Etoposide-induced DNA damage recruits the DNA-damage response factors PARP-1
  and ATM, which in turn activates STING to drive canonical NF-κB and IRF3-mediated
  interferon signaling. Artwork by Terry Helms, Graphics Department, MSKCC.
