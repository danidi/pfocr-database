caption: This model assumes that excessive accumulation of certain intramyocellular
  FA-derived lipid metabolites is lipotoxic and is a cause for muscle insulin resistance.
  In this model, both the terminal catabolic pathway (CAT) of FA oxidation and the
  anabolic pathway (ANA) of TG synthesis are viewed as beneficial in removing potentially
  lipotoxic FA derivatives from myocytes. In obesity, the primary driving force for
  increased myocellular TG levels is FA overload of myocytes. Because of the increased
  intracellular FA substrates, not only are TG levels increased, but levels of lipotoxic
  FA derivatives are also increased, leading to muscle insulin resistance. Exercise
  upregulates DGAT1, which increases the TG synthesis capacity. This also increases
  TG formation but reduces FA substrate levels, resulting in decreased formation of
  lipotoxic FA derivatives. Thus, upregulation of myocellular DGAT1 is protective
  against FA-induced insulin resistance.
