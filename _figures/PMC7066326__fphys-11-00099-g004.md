caption: Graphical representation of CRY/calmodulin interaction mechanisms. (A) Light-independent,
  CaM-dependent pathway. Inactive CRY binds to CaM, which allows the formation of
  a ternary complex with INAD. (B) In the presence of light, CRY can bind INAD directly.
  In the presence of both light and calmodulin, CRY–INAD binding is strengthened,
  thus consolidating the initial light-induced response.
