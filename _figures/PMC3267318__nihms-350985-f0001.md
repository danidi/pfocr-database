caption: T cell activation leads to increased glucose, glutamine, and mitochondrial
  oxidative metabolism that are essential for cell growth and proliferation. Data
  presented by  shows Myc plays a key role in upregulation of glucose, glutamine,
  and polyamine metabolism. In addition, the Akt-mTOR pathway promotes posttranslational
  events in aerobic glycolysis, and ERRα may play a role in regulating mitochondrial
  metabolism in T cell activation.
