caption: Sirt1 controls the immune responses in macrophages. When Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) signal is ignited, reactive oxygen species (ROS) stabilize hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein and activate glycolysis-related genes accompanied by
  nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 activation. HIF-1α could further increase glycolysis
  and inhibit mitochondrial glucose oxidation. When transformed to late stage, Sirt1
  and Sirt6 are required for the switch from glycolysis to enhanced fatty acid mitochondrial
  oxidation, which also requires the enzyme Nampt. Sirt1 deacetylates and undermines
  the activation of the NF-κB pathway as well as transcription factor activator protein
  1 (AP-1). Sirt1 could also support fatty acid oxidation by deacetylating and activating
  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1β (PGC-1β), promoting
  mitochondrial biogenesis and recovering homeostasis, while Sirt6 represses glucose
  metabolism by epigenetically silencing the HIF-1α pathway, consequently promoting
  a shift towards fatty acid oxidation. Meanwhile, activation of the TLR signalling
  pathway could induce Nampt expression during the late stage of macrophage activation,
  thus causing a negative feedback effect on macrophage activation.
