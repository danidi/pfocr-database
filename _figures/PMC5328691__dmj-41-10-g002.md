caption: . The role of nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) in endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) stress resolution. In addition to the activation of three known canonical
  branches of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways, LRH-1 is recruited to the
  promoter of polo-like kinase 3 (Plk3) gene upon ER stress. Moreover, ER stress increases
  transcription of Lrh-1 gene as well as its transcriptional activity probably via
  inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) and/or activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)
  dependent manner. PLK3, an atypical kinase phosphorylates ATF2, which induces the
  expression of its target genes including beta-1,3 glucuronyltransferase 3 (B3gat3),
  cysteine rich with EFG like domains 1 (Creld1), and multiple coagulation factor
  deficiency 2 (Mcfd2). Intriguingly, like liver-specific Lrh-1 knockout (KO) (Lrh-1LKO)
  mice, Plk3 KO mice or wild-type (WT) mice with hepatic overexpression of dominant
  negative ATF2 are also defective to resolve ER stress upon tunicamycin challenge.
  Therefore, identifying other potential ATF2 targeting genes as well as PLK3 substrates
  in both cytoplasm and nucleus could enrich our understanding of this unexpected
  but essential nuclear receptor-driven ER stress resolution pathway. BiP/GRP78, binding
  protein/glucose-regulated protein 78; PERK, PKR-like ER kinase; eIF2, eukaryotic
  initiation factor 2; XBP1s, shorter spliced form of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1)
  mRNA; S1P/S2P, site 1 and site 2 proteases; ERAD, ER-associated degradation.
