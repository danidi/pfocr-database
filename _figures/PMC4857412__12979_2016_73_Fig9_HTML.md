caption: Hypothetical model of immune modulation exerted by thermal water inhalation
  in elderly and young cURTI patients. The key result is represented by the increased
  levels of IL-21 which may lead to an augmented secretion of IL-17. Subsequent recruitment
  of neutrophils may also restore reduced serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines
  in patients. Consistent levels of IL-10, mainly produced by T regulatory cells,
  may restrain the potential induction of an exaggerated inflammatory pathway
