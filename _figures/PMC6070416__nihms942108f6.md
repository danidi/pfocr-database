caption: Tunicamycin treatment leads to the activation of IRE1 that promotes splicing
  of XBP1 mRNA. This results in increased levels of the transcription factor sXBP1,
  which triggers the expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) genes that induces
  alterations in brain connectivity and social behavior. The activation of ERβ signaling
  inhibits IRE1 activation, downregulates sXBP1 and attenuates ER stress-induced changes
  in brain connectivity and social behavior.
