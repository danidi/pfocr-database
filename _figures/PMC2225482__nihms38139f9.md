caption: A model for peroxynitrite-mediated interference with the NF-κB pathway. Immune
  stimuli activate the canonical NF-κB pathway, by inducing phosphorylation and activation
  of IKKβ, in a process regulated by IKKγ. In turn, IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα, leading
  to its proteasomal degradation. NF-κB dimers (mostly p50/p65) then translocate into
  the nucleus, bind to κB consensus sequences, and activate the transcription of target
  genes. In the presence of peroxynitrite, IKKβ phosphorylation is impaired, thereby
  blocking IKKβ activation and downstream signaling (as indicated by the (−) signs).
  At the same time, peroxynitrite activates the phosphorylation of IKKα, most probably
  via the phosphorylation and activation of the upstream kinase NIK. The cellular
  targets of IKKα in this model remain to be defined.
