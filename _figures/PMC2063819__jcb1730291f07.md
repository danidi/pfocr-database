caption: Schematic representation of the newly identified NT3-activated signaling
  pathway. NT3 binding to TrkCT1 causes the recruitment of tamalin to the TrkCT1 cytoplasmic
  domain (exon 14b). In turn, tamalin activates the guanine nucleotide exchange factors
  cytohesin-2–ARNO (), which causes the switch of Arf6 from its inactive to its active
  Arf6-GTP form. Arf6-GTP induces Rac1 activation and is translocated to the membrane,
  where ruffling and actin reorganization take place. Tamalin alanine/proline (A/P),
  PDZ, leucine rich (Leu), and PDZ-binding (SQL) domains are indicated, as well as
  ARNO's pleckstrin homology (PH), coiled coil, and Sec7 homology domains.
