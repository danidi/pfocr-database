caption: LIF/Jak/STAT signaling. Cells can communicate with each other through the
  secretion of cytokines, small (8–30 kDa) soluble proteins. Upon binding of cytokines
  and growth factors to their cognate receptors, receptor-associated Jaks phosphorylate
  tyrosine residues of STATs. Phosphorylated STATs form homodimers, shuttle to the
  nucleus, and participate in transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes.
