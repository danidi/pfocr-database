caption: Model of the AR induction pathway in ‘T337’ basal cuttings. After the supplement
  of exogenous IBA, proteins related to auxin homeostasis and transport facilitated
  the auxin accumulation in apple, which promoted auxin signaling, as well as nitric
  oxide signaling. Enhanced ethylene biosynthesis promoted H2O2 accumulation and ethylene
  signaling. Meanwhile, cytokinin signal was reduced and abscisic acid signal was
  enhanced. Sugar metabolism and energy production proteins ensured adequate carbon
  skeleton and energy supply. Protein homeostasis proteins, especially proteins related
  to ubiquitinylation might participate in adventitious roots (ARs) formation through
  the regulation of phytohormone signaling. In addition, microtubule proteins, along
  with proteins related to cell wall properties, functioned in the shift from cell
  division to cell differentiation to stimulate AR formation instead of callus formation.
