caption: Schematic of proposed mechanism for enhancing antigen‐specific immune response
  by the CS‐IONzyme‐based influenza vaccine. CS‐IONzyme first enhances the adhesion
  levels of H1N1 WIV to nasal mucosa after intranasal immunization of CS‐IONzyme‐based
  influenza vaccine in mice. Next, CS‐IONzyme strongly stimulates nasal epithelial
  cells (ECs) to secrete chemokine CCL20 via toll‐like receptor (TLR) 2/4 pathway,
  which recruits more DCs into the submucosal regions to form transepithelial dendrites
  (TEDs) for H1N1 WIV uptake. After viral capture, DCs gradually reach the phenotypic
  and functional maturation and then quickly migrate into draining cervical lymph
  nodes (CLNs) for antigen presentation. Finally, the antigen‐specific immune response
  is initiated.
