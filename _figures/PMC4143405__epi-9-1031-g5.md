caption: 'Figure 5. Proposed genomic and epigenomic interactions in HNSCC: (A) Proposed
  partial pathway interplay of p53 and PAX5 in HNSCC. Downregulation of PAX5 leads
  to differentiation. When methylated, PAX5 an upstream target of p53, fails to activate
  the later which is also silenced due to mutations, and thus DNA repair, Apoptosis,
  and Growth Arrest pathways are inactive; (B) PAX1-NOTCH1 interplay through crosstalk
  of Hedgehog and Notch pathways in cell differentiation and proliferation signals.
  Notch1 induces p21 expression, either directly through the canonical pathway or
  indirectly through Hes1 and NFAT activation, leading in both cases to cell cycle
  arrest. Active Notch1 targets either the Hox family or Hes1. Hes1 is active and
  will block differentiation. The HOX family of transcription factors, downstream
  targets of Notch signaling, is frequently silenced, thus blocking the activation
  of PAX1 which is also downregulated in HNSCC and will not promote differentiation.
  PAX1 expression can also be induced by Shh through Gli2, which is active. Finally,
  proliferation is promoted through Gli2 interaction with CCND1 and CCND2.'
