caption: Simplified representation of the complement cascade. Pattern-recognition
  receptors such as C1q, MBL, ficolins (F), or properdin (P) bind to surface patches
  on microbial or apoptotic cells and initiate the formation of C3 convertase complexes,
  which all cleave C3 into C3a and C3b. In addition, low levels of C3b are constantly
  produced via spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 (tick-over). Opsonization with C3b leads
  to the local generation of additional C3 convertases (self-amplification) and the
  C5 convertase. In the terminal pathway, this C5 convertase cleaves C5 into the potent
  anaphylatoxin C5a and into C5b, which forms the lytic membrane attack complex (MAC)
  pores. Regulators of complement activation (RCA) modulate convertase activity and
  enable factor I (FI) to degrade C3b into fragments iC3b and C3d, which participate
  in signaling and link to adaptive immune responses.
