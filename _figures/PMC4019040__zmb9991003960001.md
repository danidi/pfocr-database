caption: Mechanisms of mutated and wild-type tyrosine kinase activation in cancer.
  Three prototypical mechanisms of genetically altered tyrosine kinase activation
  as evidenced through genetic alterations. Shown are examples of mutations (A), amplifications
  (B), or translocations (C) that render a kinase constitutively active and thus contribute
  to the addiction of tumor cells on pathways driven by the genetically altered kinase.
  In the absence of genetic alterations (D to F), nonmutated tyrosine kinases can
  be activated via many different mechanisms and contribute to pathway signaling.
  In all cases, this pathway addiction leads to increased tumor cell proliferation
  and survival. In some cases, highly potent therapies that inhibit (red) the altered
  protein kinase have resulted in robust clinical outcomes. RTK, receptor tyrosine
  kinase; Chr, chromosome; Ph1, Philadelphia chromosome; BCR, breakpoint cluster region;
  Ag, antigen; BTK, Bruton's tyrosine kinase; PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase
  1B.
