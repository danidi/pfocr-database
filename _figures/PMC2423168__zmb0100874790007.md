caption: A model for Cdc1p function and the link between Cdc1p and Golgi inheritance.
  (a) Cdc1p is presumed to be a lipid phosphatase, and we suggest that Per1p is needed
  to generate the substrate for Cdc1p. According to this model, inactivating Cdc1p
  causes its substrate to accumulate to toxic levels and also causes accumulation
  of a nontoxic precursor lipid. When Per1p is inactivated, only the nontoxic precursor
  accumulates, so a per1Δ mutation suppresses the lethality of cdc1 mutations. This
  nontoxic precursor may correspond to the unidentified lipid that was visualized
  in the experiment shown in Fig. . (b) In cdc1 cells, accumulation of the toxic phosphorylated
  lipid activates both Mpk1p- and Cch1p-dependent Ca2+signaling. The Ca2+signaling
  activates calcineurin. In a calcineurin-independent pathway, strong Ca2+signaling
  depolarizes actin. We speculate that strong Ca2+signaling also inhibits Golgi tethering.
  These two effects of strong Ca2+signaling synergize to cause a pronounced defect
  in Golgi inheritance.
