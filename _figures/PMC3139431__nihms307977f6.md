caption: Glutamate taken up by SGCs through the GLAST transporter is normally converted
  to glutamine via GS (see ). Introducing the GAD65 transgene into the SGC via an
  adenovirus (AdGAD65) provides the pathway for the glutamate to be converted to GABA,
  which is then released by bulk transport to inhibit nearby primary sensory neurons
  by acting on GABAA receptors.
