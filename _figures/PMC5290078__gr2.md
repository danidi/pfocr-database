caption: Macrophages activated by the classical pathway act as inflammation inducers
  and are called M1. These macrophages produce high levels of IL-2 and low levels
  of IL-10. Studies have also shown that the activation of macrophages is dependent
  on the stimulation of inflammatory cytokines produced by helper lymphocytes or NK
  cells, in particular gamma interferon (INFγ). The activated macrophages that have
  microbial and tumoricidal activity are characterized by secreting large amounts
  of cytokines and proinflammatory mediators. In this inflammatory response, these
  macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, TNFα, and also
  produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide,
  as well as reactive intermediates, such as nitric oxide. Shortly after phagocytosis,
  the macrophages die by programmed cell death, known as apoptosis. The “alternative
  activation” involves the stimulation of macrophages by molecules such as the interleukins
  IL-4 and IL-13, which leads to an increase in IL-10 anti-inflammatory cytokine levels
  and induces tissue repair (anti-inflammatory response). In the body, the proinflammatory
  immune response is usually followed by an anti-inflammatory immune response. This
  is important for tissue repair after a microbial infection or physical injury. The
  imbalance between the two responses can lead to chronic diseases such as osteoarthritis.
