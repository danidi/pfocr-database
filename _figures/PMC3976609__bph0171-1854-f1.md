caption: Some of the major bioenergetic pathways. Glycolysis, the pentose phosphate
  shunt, the Krebs cycle and gluconeogenesis are illustrated. The large blue box indicates
  the mitochondrial compartment; the cytosol is the area outside of this blue box.
  Redox (green text boxes) and energy storage (red text boxes) intermediates are indicated.
  Relationships between these pathways and some amino acids (yellow text boxes, with
  standard abbreviations used) are shown. To give a better overall feel for the connectivity
  between these pathways, some critical shuttles such as the malate-aspartate shuttle
  and citrate-malate shuttle are superficially (but incompletely) indicated. High-energy
  electrons from NADH and FADH2 feed into the respiratory pathway, and combine with
  O2 to form H2O (not shown). Fatty acid β-oxidation, which produces large amounts
  of NADH and acetyl CoA is not shown, although entry of d-β-hydroxybutyrate (a ketone
  body) carbon into the Krebs cycle is incompletely summarized in order to show its
  associated contribution to the mitochondrial redox balance.
