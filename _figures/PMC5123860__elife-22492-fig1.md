caption: 'Left: In the absence of Hedgehog protein, the transmembrane protein Patched
  (purple) inhibits the transmembrane receptor protein Smoothened (blue and grey)
  via an unknown mechanism. The findings of Luchetti et al. and Huang et al. suggest
  that Patched and Smoothened may communicate using the lipid molecule cholesterol
  (green), which is a core component of animal cell membranes (orange lines). Patched
  is similar to other proteins that transport small molecules across membranes, and
  might act to limit cholesterol access to Smoothened. In the absence of available
  cholesterol, Smoothened receptors on the cell surface are inactive. Right: Hedgehog
  protein binds to and inactivates Patched, potentially increasing cholesterol levels
  outside the cell. Cholesterol binds to a hydrophobic pocket in the Smoothened cysteine-rich
  domain (blue). Smoothened can now activate the Hedgehog signalling pathway, although
  many details of this process are not fully understood (see main article). In particular, it
  is not clear how cholesterol gains access to the Smoothened cysteine-rich domain.
  Cholesterol can be released from the membrane into the extracellular space by a
  process called desorption, but its insolubility makes this energetically unfavourable.
  Alternatively, a sterol-binding protein outside cells could deliver cholesterol
  to Smoothened.'
