caption: Model depicting regulation of exchange frequency by DNA helicases during
  DSB-induced recombination. (A) Both Mph1 and Srs2 promote the noncrossover SDSA
  pathway by minimizing the possibility of creating a dHJ. Mph1 displaces the invading
  strand after DNA synthesis has commenced, thus preventing dHJ formation and promoting
  SDSA. Mph1 may also inhibit recombination if it dissociates D-loop before invading
  strand-initiated DNA synthesis. Srs2 possibly removes Rad51 from the unpaired 3′
  DNA tail to prevent second end capture and dHJ formation. (B) When the D-loop becomes
  extended and more stable, dHJs are formed and can be resolved into crossovers and
  noncrossovers by a yet-unknown resolvase. (C) Sgs1 helicase in complex with Rmi1
  and Top3 resolves these mitotic dHJs into noncrossovers.
