caption: Biochemical steps involving P5C/γGS intermediates. The proline-glutamate
  interconversion pathway in T. cruzi involves two enzymatic steps in either the catabolic
  or biosynthetic pathway. l-Proline is oxidized to P5C by the FAD-dependent proline
  dehydrogenase (TcPRODH) (1.5.99.8) (UniProtKB code number F2WVH3). The reduction
  of P5C in proline is mediated by the enzyme P5C-reductase (TcP5CDR) (EC 1.5.1.2)
  (K4EAX2) and is coupled to NADPH oxidation. The reduction of glutamic acid into
  P5C requires two steps as follows. (i) Glutamic acid is first activated by an ATP-dependent
  kinase to produce glutamyl 1-phosphate, which is in turn converted to γGS by the
  NADPH-dependent P5C synthetase (TcP5CS) (EC 2.7.2.11) (K4E0F1). γGS is the equilibrium
  form of P5C in aqueous medium. (ii) carbonyl moiety of γGS is further oxidized to
  glutamic acid concomitantly with reduction of NAD(P)H by P5C-dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.1.1)
  () (Q4DRT8), which is the enzyme investigated in this study.
