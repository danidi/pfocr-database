caption: (A) A balanced agonist binding to a balanced receptor in an unbiased system
  may display equivalent potencies for two different pathways, such as G protein and
  βarrestin, under assay conditions with similar amplification levels. (B) Biased
  agonism, or ‘druggable’ biased signaling, is encoded through the ligand. The ligand-receptor-effector
  complex generates distinct conformation(s) that preferentially signal through certain
  pathways relative to other pathways (βarrestin biased relative to G protein in this
  example). Unlike the balanced agonist in panel (A), a βarrestin biased agonist may
  display a left shift in potency relative to the G protein pathway under the same
  assay conditions. (C) Biased receptors, such as G protein-biased receptors that
  lack C-terminal phosphorylation sites necessary for βarrestin recruitment, signal
  preferentially through one pathway relative to another (G protein biased signaling
  in this example) despite being stimulated by a balanced agonist. Similar to biased
  ligands, biased receptors will also display a left shift of one pathway relative
  to another that may not be observed at an unbiased receptor under the same assay
  conditions. (D) System bias may be due to differential expression of signaling effectors
  or other cofactors. For example, higher expression of certain GRK and/or βarrestin
  isoforms can bias signaling towards the βarrestin pathway (shown here). Alternatively,
  lack of GRKs or βarrestins can bias signaling towards the G protein pathway (not
  shown).
