caption: The recruitment of myeloid cells to atherosclerotic plaques represents a
  critical process in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. In this issue
  of Circulation Research, Dreshler and colleagues investigated the actions of Annexin
  A1, the Annexin A1 N-terminal peptide AC2-26, and its receptor, N-Formyl peptide
  receptor 2 (FPR2), on atherosclerosis in Apoe−/− mice. Ly6Chigh monocytes and Ly6Ghigh
  neutrophils (left) use several chemokine receptors and leukocyte adhesion molecules,
  in the steps of the adhesion cascade (rolling to transmigration), to migrate to
  atherosclerotic plaques. Importantly, in order for monocytes or neutrophils to roll,
  adhere, and transmigrate, membrane integrins need to activate and properly cluster,
  through outside-in activation, inside-out activation, or changes in avidity. This
  study demonstrates that Annexin A1, which is primarily present within lesional Mac2+
  macrophages and foam cells, may be released from the plaque and act on circulating
  FPR2+ monocytes and neutrophils to antagonize integrin activation, clustering, and
  therefore migration. How does Annexin A1/FPR2 signaling work? While the full pathway
  was not examined, the pathway at least involves activation of the small GTPase Rap1
  and integrin activation. So how might Annexin A1/FPR2 signaling impact Rap1-activation?
  FPR2 is a known G-protein coupled receptor and has been reported to associate with
  Gαi2, Gβ, and Gγ. Thus while the exact signaling mechanisms involved are unclear,
  several pathways could be involved. Annexin A1-FPR2-Gαi2 signaling might serve to
  antagonize Adenylate Cyclase, thereby lowering cyclic AMP levels, and antagonizing
  EPAC proteins, which are known guanine exchange factor for Rap1. These actions would
  result in a decrease in GTP-Rap1 dependent integrin activation. Alternatively, Annexin
  A1-FPR2-Gαi2 activation might promote the recruitment and activation of a RapGAP,
  which would promote hydrolysis of GTP and thereby deactivate Rap1; achieving the
  same end. All together, while additional work on the mechanisms of action is necessary,
  the results presented by Drescher and colleagues indicate that Annexin A1-might
  serve as an endogenous negative regulator of myeloid cell recruitment in early atherogenesis.
