caption: A. In daf-2/InR insulin-receptor mutants, insulin-like peptides (e.g., INS-7)
  secreted from neurons reach intestinal cells and trigger the canonical insulin-signaling
  pathway, which prevents DAF-16/FOXO from entering the nucleus. Other mechanisms
  of DAF-16/FOXO regulation include ubiquitination (RLE-1/E3 ligase) and arginine
  methylation (PMRT-1/methylase). Nuclear-localized DAF-16/FOXO activity is enhanced
  by the action of SMK-1/SMEK and HSF-1, and is inhibited by HCF-1. The transcription
  factor SKN-1/Nrf is also required for longevity in daf-2/InR mutants. Collectively,
  these factors transcriptionally regulate multiple output processes as noted. Autophagy
  is another cellular process required for daf-2/InR mutants to live long. It is not
  yet known whether autophagy is a transcriptionally regulated process in daf-2/InR
  mutants.B. TOR responds to nutrients and functions in two different complexes, TORC1
  and TORC2. In analogy with mammalian studies, TORC1 is thought to interact with
  DAF-15/Raptor as well as Rag GTPases like RAGA-1, RAGC-1, and RHEB-1/Rheb. TORC1
  and TORC1 specifically impair the activity of DAF-16/FOXO and SKN-1/Nrf, whereas
  it is not yet clear which of the two TOR complexes regulates PHA-4/FOXA (indicated
  by dashes lines). By using these transcription factors, TOR inhibits the expression
  of at least certain lipolysis-, autophagy-, and detoxification-associated genes.
  Listed as a cytoplasmic process, TOR signaling also likely modulates aging through
  a general suppression of translation. While the intestine has been linked to the
  longevity mediated by TORC1, the specific tissue requirements for TOR-dependent
  effects on aging have not yet been systematically investigated.Factors with longevity-promoting
  effects are in green and those with lifespan-limiting effects are in red. Transcription
  factors are in boxes. See text for details.
