caption: Classical view of progressive linear cascades in the asymmetry-determining
  pathway. Numerous molecular components have now been implicated in the establishment
  of L or R identity of the two embryonic halves. The functional data testing knockdown
  and overexpression of each gene, followed by examination of the expression of downstream
  steps, have given rise to a view of the pathway as a linear progressive cascade
  of repressions and inductions, with variations between species (for example, the
  activation of Nodal by Notch/Delta represents the system in mouse and chick, but
  Notch/Delta actually inhibits Nodal in zebrafish and sea urchin). A core cassette
  is the promotion of ‘left’ by left-sided Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression inducing
  Nodal and then Lefty and Pitx2, which ultimately sets the situs of the heart, while
  Activin repression of Shh on the right of the node promotes ‘right’ with the inactivation
  of Nodal and therefore derepression of Snail. Such a linear perspective predicts
  that defects in the expression of upstream genes will result in corresponding defects
  in their downstream targets, propagating errors towards organ heterotaxias. Recent
  data have indicated that this view of asymmetry is limited in two ways. Gene-regulatory
  networks on their own cannot distinguish spatial properties (cannot tell L from
  R or constrain geometry in any way), nor can they directly control the physical
  forces needed to shape organ morphogenesis. Moreover, a linear pathway does not
  correctly predict the many examples of progressive defect repair in the LR signalling
  that leads to organ situs. Thus, any such transcriptional network must be bookended
  by chiral physical elements upstream (to link the very first asymmetric transcriptional
  event to one side but not the other) and downstream (to shape the asymmetric organs);
  it must also include mechanisms for sensing aberrant gene expression and correcting
  downstream steps.
