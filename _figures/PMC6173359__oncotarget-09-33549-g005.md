number: Figure 5
caption: 2 × 103 of U251 or SH-SY5Y cell suspensions are suspended in Matrigel™/serum
  free DMEM (1:1) and plated gently around the rim of individual wells of a 24-well
  plate. Media (alone or with drug) is added gently to the center of each well and
  changed every 2–3 days. Spheres are formed and serially passaged without treatment
  for 5 generations (G) to enrich for cancer stem cells, and then drugs are added
  at G5 to potentially target those cells; or treatment is added to every generation
  and then spheres are serially propagated to investigate whether the effect is permanent
  or reversal. The SFU, expressed as %, is calculated by dividing the number of spheres
  counted by the number of input cells (2 × 103 cells) and then multiplied by 100.
