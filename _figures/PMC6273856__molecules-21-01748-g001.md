caption: 'Impact of β-CDs on reverse cholesterol transfer (RCT) and in atherosclerosis.
  As showed in , β-CD family shows promising therapeutic properties in atherosclerosis
  field. β-CDs are able to extract cholesterol and phospholipids from cell membrane
  (1) resulting in the decrease of lipid intracellular pools (2). This process leads
  to an activation of the liver X signaling (LXR) pathway (3) which in turn regulates
  the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 (4). As a consequence, the formation and lipidation
  of HDL particles are modified (5 and 6). In vitro, lipid extraction by CDs provokes
  a down-regulation of ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression and a decrease in the free cholesterol
  transfer to ApoA-I [,]. However, in tissues from ApoE−/− animals or when cells are
  cholesterol-loaded in vitro, lipid extraction induces an increase in the cholesterol
  efflux mediated by the up-regulation of these ABC transporters [] (7). Noteworthy,
  in brain, apolipoprotein E remains the main cholesterol acceptor forming HDL. CD-mediated
  activation of LXR pathway inhibits inflammatory response (8) [,]. In addition, CDs
  promote atherosclerotic size plaque reduction in vivo (9) by a HDL-independent mechanism
  which remains unclear [,]. HDL: High density lipoproteins; LXR: Liver X receptor;
