caption: Over stimulation of NMDA receptors by glutamate triggers a strong inflow
  of Ca2+; this overload of Ca2+ leading to excitotoxic cell death processes (1).
  L-Lactate is transported into the cell (2) and converted to Pyruvate by Lactate
  Dehydrogenase (LDH) (3). Pyruvate is transported into mitochondria through the Mitochondrial
  Pyruvate Carrier (MPC) to produce ATP (4). ATP is then released through pannexins
  and acts on the metabotropic purinergic receptor P2Y, likely P2Y2, in a autocrine/paracine
  manner (5). Stimulation of purinergic receptors activates the PI3K pathway (6) which,
  in turn, elicits the opening of KATP channels, hence leading to hyperpolarization
  of neurons (7), the consequence being a decrease in neuronal excitability leading
  to neuroprotection.
