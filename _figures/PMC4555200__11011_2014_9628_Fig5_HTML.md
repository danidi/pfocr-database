caption: 'Carbon-13 labelling patterns after administration of 1-13C glucose: When
  the first carbon of glucose (C1) is 13C, the resulting pyruvate maintains the 13C
  as the third carbon (C3). Glycolysis converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules
  of pyruvate and so only one of the two 3-carbon chain length pyruvate molecules
  will contain 13C. Pyruvate can be converted to lactate, by the action of lactate
  dehydrogenase. Alternatively, through the action of pyruvate dehydrogenase on pyruvate,
  acetyl-CoA is produced containing just a 2-carbon backbone with one of the carbons
  (C1, the carboxylate carbon of pyruvate) lost as carbon dioxide. The 2 carbons of
  acetyl-CoA are then condensed with oxaloacetate and continue in the TCA cycle, ultimately
  emerging as amino acid spin-offs or as carbon dioxide. The main products identifiable
  with NMR (in animal brain tissue extracts ex vivo) or MRS (in human or animal brain
  in vivo) include glutamine, glutamate, GABA and aspartate. The C1 of a glucose molecule
  will become the C4 of glutamate and glutamine on the first turn of the TCA cycle.
  Subsequent turns of the TCA cycle will result in the 13C label shifting to the C3
  or C2 of glutamate and glutamine. Hence, it is possible to determine, through the
  relative enrichment of the C4, C3, or C2 carbons, the proportion of glutamate or
  glutamine produced on the first turn of the TCA and subsequent cycles. In this way,
  13C-NMR provides a convenient way to study the transformation of the carbon skeleton
  that takes place during the metabolism of glucose. The relative proportions of 13C

  been used in numerous studies to compare pathway activities. This schematic diagram
