caption: The chemosensory two-component pathway of E. coli and S. typhimurium. Arrows
  indicate the action of one component on another. Attractants and repellents in the
  periplasm bind to specific transmembrane receptors or to soluble binding proteins
  that in turn bind to transmembrane receptors. The transmembrane receptors are coupled
  by a scaffolding protein (CheW) to a cytoplasmic histidine kinase (CheA), which
  in turn regulates two response regulators (CheB and CheY). Phosphorylation of CheB
  modulates the adaptation system in which CheR methylates specific regulatory glutamate
  side chains on the cytoplasmic surface of the receptor, whereas phospho-CheB hydrolyzes
  these modifications. The steady state level of receptor methylation provided by
  the opposing CheR and CheB reactions enables the pathway to adapt to background
  stimuli and also provides a simple chemical memory. Phosphorylation of CheY modulates
  the rotary flagellar motor as phospho-CheY docks to the motor switch apparatus,
  thereby controlling the direction of motor rotation and the swimming behavior of
  the cell. Although CheY can catalyze its own dephosphorylation, the rate of phospho-signal
  inactivation is enhanced by a phosphatase activity (CheZ) (see text for references).
