caption: Metabolic mechanisms of macrophage polarization. M1 macrophages are characterized
  by predominantly glycolytic metabolism. Glycolysis consists of breaking down a 6-carbon
  glucose molecule (where each carbon is depicted as a blue circle, white when phosphorylated)
  into 3-carbon sugars then into pyruvate, ATP, NADH, and H+. The transcriptional
  programme that supports glycolysis is mediated by HIF1 and at least in part by IRF5.
  A Glucose substrate is provided by increased expression of the glucose transporter
  GLUT1. Meanwhile several glycolytic enzymes undertake non-canonical roles to support
  M1 effector functions. The mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is disrupted,
  leading to accumulation of citrate and succinate which also enhance M1 effector
  function. The M2 macrophage has a fully intact TCA cycle, enhanced OXPHOS and increased
  mitochondrial biogenesis. ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is activated downstream of IL4
  signaling and enhances M2 effector functions through epigenetic mechanisms and producing
  substrates for lipogenesis. The sedoheptulose kinase (CARKL) represses the pentose
  phosphate pathway (PPP). Transcriptional programmes for M2 macrophage metabolism
  are mediated by PPARγ and LXR. GLUT1, Glucose transporter-1; HK, Hexokinase; NLRP3,
