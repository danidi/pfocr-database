caption: Pathway for the synthesis of ectoine and hydroxyectoine and design of a recombinant
  cell factory for the production of ectoines. (A) Biosynthetic route for ectoine
  and its derivative 5-hydroxyectoine from l-aspartate. The relevant data for the
  enzymes and metabolites involved in this process were compiled from the literature
  (, , , ). (B) The E. coli cell factory carries a low-copy-number plasmid harboring
  the ectABCD-ask_ect gene cluster from P. stutzeri A1501 () under the control of
  its authentic and osmotically inducible promoter (P_ect) (). This plasmid (pLC68)
  is a derivative of the cloning vector pHSG575 (), which carries a lac promoter (P_lac)
  that is constitutively expressed in all the E. coli strains used in this study,
  as they carry a deletion of the entire lac operon, including that of the lacI regulatory
  gene. ProP and ProU are osmotically inducible transport systems for osmostress protectants;
  ProP is a member of the MFS family (), and ProU is a binding-protein-dependent ABC
  transporter (). The presumed ectoine/hydroxyectoine efflux system is shown as a
  yellow box; its molecular identity is unknown. The trimeric OmpC and OmpF proteins
  (represented here as monomers) function as general porins that are inserted into
  the E. coli outer membrane. IM, inner membrane; OM, outer membrane.
