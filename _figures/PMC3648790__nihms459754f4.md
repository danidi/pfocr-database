caption: The counteracting writer EZH2 and eraser KDM6A/UTX form a pair in regulating
  an important epigenetic mark, methylation at H3 lysine 27. EZH2 catalyzes the methylation
  process with help from other components in the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2),
  while KDM6A, part of the Trithorax complex, removes this repressive mark. The K27me3
  mark attracts another Polycomb complex, PRC1, which ubiquitinates H2AK119, and thereby
  blocks PolII elongation. Another Polycomb complex, PR-DUB is also critical to the
  maintainance of the repression at a subset of the Polycomb genes, although it removes
  the H2AK119ub mark and thus counteracts PRC1 in that regard. Mutations and genetic
  alterations spanning a wide spectrum of human cancers hit this epigenetic pathway.
  Solid tumors show possibly neomorphic histone K27 mutations (mimicking H3K27me2),
  UTX mutation, EZH2 amplification and/or overexpression due to genomic loss of the
  repressive microRNA miR101, as well as amplification/overexpression of the PRC1
  member BMI1, and lymphoma exhibits gain-of-function mutations of EZH2, consistent
  with a gain of Polycomb repression (red boxes) in the affected malignancies. In
  contrast, myeloid malignancies and ALL, particularly early T-cell precursor ALL
  show mutations that could sabotage Polycomb repression (blue boxes). Mouse models
  show that loss of BAP1, the enzymatic unit of PR-DUB, leads to myeloid transformation,
  although BAP1 mutation in MDS is rare. Gray boxes indicate that the effect on H3K27me3
  is not clear.
