caption: Biosynthetic pathways branching from glycolysis in glucose-replete conditions.
  Glucose is the main precursor for glycolysis (blue arrows). Glycolytic enzymes are
  upregulated in many cancer types, leading to enhanced generation of glycolytic intermediates.
  These serve as precursors for numerous metabolic pathways (marked in red) necessary
  for the biosynthesis of cellular biomass (highlighted in grey). Excess glycolytic
  intermediates are converted to pyruvate and finally lactate, which is released.
  The conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, leading to full oxidation in mitochondria,
  is relatively decreased. Additionally, amino acid catabolism, primarily glutaminolysis,
  is required to meet the cancer cell’s demand for nitrogen and biosynthetic precursors.
  PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; HK2, hexokinase 2; PFK, phosphofructokinase; PKM2,
  pyruvate kinase M2; LDHA, lactate dehydrogenase A; GLS, glutaminase; TCA cycle,
  tricarboxylic acid cycle.
