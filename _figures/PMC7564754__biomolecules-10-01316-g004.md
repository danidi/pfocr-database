caption: Schematic representation of how selected polyphenols can interact with p57
  expression and activity (see  and text for details). EGCG, as well as other catechins,
  upregulates the expression of p57 in normal cells, inducing differentiation (e.g.,
  human keratinocytes), acting on CDKN1C gene transcription via members of the MAPK
  family, possibly p38. In cancer cells, the increased expression of p57 leads to
  apoptosis through a pathway probably involving JNK. Quercetin also induces apoptosis,
  upregulating CDKN1C gene expression via uncharacterized factors. Dashed green arrows
  indicate activation mediated by “indirect” interactions between the indicated polyphenols
  and p57-regulating factors.
