caption: Proposed mechanism for IL-1β-induced upregulation of IGFBP1. The mechanisms
  of IL-1β-induced upregulation of IGFBP1 mRNA transcription in the liver are complex
  and involve several distinct pathways. In a healthy state, the insulin signaling
  is the main mechanism for IGFBP1 regulation that facilitates the coordinated regulation
  of its production in accordance to the feeding state of the organisms. The pathway
  involves activation of Akt and nuclear export of FoxO-1 transcription factor. IL-1β,
  however, can negate insulin signaling and can potentially interfere with insulin-dependent
  regulation of IGFBP1 by downregulation of Akt. IL-1β can also increase IGFBP1 transcription
  by elevating nuclear FoxO-1 trough JNK activation in an insulin-independent manner.
  The results from this study delineate a novel pathway allowing for increasing IGFBP1
  mRNA and serum IGFBP1 levels in response to IL-1β through direct stimulation of
  IGFBP1 promoter activity in a manner that does not require FoxO-1 or the insulin
  response element. This novel pathway seemingly involves activation of nSMase-2 and
  ERK and can be surpassed by an active insulin pathway.
