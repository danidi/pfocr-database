caption: Schematic representation of the proposed pathway by which deficiency of FXR
  activates the STAT3 signaling pathway in the liver. FXR deficiency results in an
  increase in BA levels, which leads to inflammation and increased IL-β expression
  followed by subsequent increase in IL-6 levels in the liver of FXR−/− mice. The
  increase in IL-6 leads to JAK2 phosphorylation through glycoprotein 130 (GP130),
  which further activates STAT3 by Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylation. Upon phosphorylation,
  STAT3 molecules form homodimers and translocate to the nucleus where they induce
  activation of downstream target genes involved in liver carcinogenesis, including
  SOCS3, c-Myc, Survivin, and p21. Furthermore, SOCS3, which is the feedback inhibitor
  of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway, is a direct FXR target gene. Therefore, the abrogation
  of SOCS3 feedback inhibition further contributes to the activation of the JAK2/STAT3
  pathway in livers of FXR−/− mice.
