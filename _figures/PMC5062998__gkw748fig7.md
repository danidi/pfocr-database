caption: Schematic model of the FBW7-SOX9 pathway under basal conditions and after
  DNA damage. Under basal conditions, SOX9 protein stability is tightly controlled
  by a phosphorylation by GSK3β within the CPD motif located within the K2 domain
  of SOX9. Phosphorylated SOX9 is recognized by FBW7 that targets SOX9 for proteasomal
  degradation.
pmcid: PMC5062998
papertitle: SOX9 is targeted for proteasomal degradation by the E3 ligase FBW7 in
  response to DNA damage.
