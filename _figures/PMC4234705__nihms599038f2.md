caption: EphA2 and EphA3 promote cancer stem cell self-renewal, possibly through inhibition
  of Erk signaling in glioblastoma stem cells. EphA2-dependent motility and invasiveness
  in glioma stem cells, however, appears to be mediated through cross-talk with Akt.
  The JNK and c-JUN signaling pathway was shown to be important in EphA2-dependent
  tumor cell proliferation and motility, and is likely to regulate stemness in non-small
  cell lung cancer.
