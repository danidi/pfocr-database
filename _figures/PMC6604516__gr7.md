caption: 'Graphical signalling pathway of the effect of APPBP2 on NSCLC via PPM1D
  and SPOP.The blue lines indicate the activation of the targets according to our
  experiments or published researches. The red lines indicate the possible inhibition
  of targets according to our reasonable speculation. AR: androgen receptor. (For
