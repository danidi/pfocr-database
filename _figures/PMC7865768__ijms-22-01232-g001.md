caption: Roles of cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) in cell osmoregulation. Intracellular

  conditions of cell shrinkage due to water extrusion from the cell, a counter-response
  of regulatory volume increase (RVI) restores normal cell volume. In this condition,
  the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway is activated leading to the phosphorylation of the CCCs.
  This activates NKCC1 and inhibits KCC, leading to the NKCC1-mediated influx of Na+,
  K+, and Cl− along with water, thus restoring cell volume. On the contrary, under
  hypotonic stress conditions of cell swelling, the cell activates a regulatory volume
  decrease (RVD). The WNK-SPAK/OSR1 pathway remains inactive and NKCC1 and KCCs are
  dephosphorylated. This stimulates KCC3 but inhibits NKCC1 leading to the efflux
  K+ and Cl− along with water, and cell volume decrease. NKCC1, K+-Cl− cotransporters;
