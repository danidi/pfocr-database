caption: To initiate the study of the silicon-assisted, cross-coupling macrocyclization,
  an efficient and versatile synthetic sequence was needed to generate the cycloalkenylsiloxanes
  7a-7e ( and ) and 10 () in high yield. The cyclic alkenylsiloxanes were prepared
  in 7 steps from 4-pentyn-1-ol. The synthesis of the styryl siloxane 10 on the other
  hand required eight steps. The selection of the reaction sequence was guided by
  the stability of the products along each pathway. Because the silyl ethers and the
  siloxanes are sensitive compounds, the syntheses of these products were designed
  such that they are last compounds prepared prior to macrocyclization. The details
  of each synthetic sequence are described below.
