caption: Biosynthesis of terpenoids. The pathways have been conceptually separated
  into four modules, which is representative of the modularized method many metabolic
  engineers use to approach isoprenoid pathway engineering. Mevalonate (MVA) and methyl-D-erythritol
  phosphate (MEP) pathways lead to IPP (isopentenyl pyrophosphate) and DMAPP (dimethylallyl
  pyrophosphate) (module I). Additions of IPP produce higher-order prenyl phosphates
  (module II), dephosphorylation (often coincident with or followed by bond rearrangement
  and/or cyclisation) to form specialized terpenoid backbones (module III), chemical
  decorations, and other modifications to yield end products. Note that not all end
  products undergo decorations of the carbon skeleton.
