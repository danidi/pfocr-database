caption: Proposed regulatory mechanism of ERβ in colitis-associated colon cancer.
  In inflammatory bowel disease, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17, TNFα,
  IL-6, and IFNγ, activate the NFκB signaling pathway and increase iNOS levels. In
  turn, iNOS is involved in initiating inflammation and inducing DNA damage that activate
  β-catenin. Both NFκB and β-catenin signaling pathways enhance the progression of
  colitis-associated colonic tumorigenesis. Poor tumor prognosis is characterized
  by an increase in MUC1, and a decrease in MUC2 and Cav-1. Our results suggest a
  potential role for ERβ in the regulation of several molecules highlighted in this
  model. ERβ signals appear to suppress AOM/DSS-induced IL-17, TNFα, IL-6, IFNγ, iNOS,
  NFκB, and MUC1 represented in green, and to preserve MUC2 and Cav-1 expressions
  represented in red. Molecules represented in white were implicated in the literature
  in IBD-induced colon cancer development.
