caption: The JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Upon binding ligand, receptor-associated
  JAKs become activated and mediate phosphorylation of specific receptor tyrosine
  residues. This leads to the recruitment of specific STATs, which are then also tyrosine-phosphorylated.
  Activated STATs are released from the receptor, dimerize, translocate to the nucleus,
  and bind to members of the γ-activated site (GAS) family of enhancers.
