caption: Yeast use memory of past exposure to pheromone to decide to reenter the cell
  cycle. (A) Yeast temporarily exposed to a high pheromone concentration (top) will
  remain arrested at a lower concentration than yeast only exposed to the lower concentration
  (bottom). Cells base the decision to reenter the cell cycle on Far1 levels, which
  reflect an integration of MAPK pathway activity. (B) Yeast are able to transmit
  memory of past pheromone exposure across generations despite the mutual inhibition
  of cell cycle kinases and Far1. This is because Cdc24 anchors some Far1 in the cytoplasm,
  which is not targeted for degradation by the predominantly nuclear cell cycle kinases.
  Release of the anchored Far1 in subsequent cell cycles promotes cell cycle arrest
  in daughter cells. Yeast may have pseudohyphae morphology during arrest under the
  conditions shown here. Far1 concentration is illustrated in proportion to the darkness
  of the blue color.
