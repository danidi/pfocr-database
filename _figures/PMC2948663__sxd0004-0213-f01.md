caption: The molecular and genetic events in mammalian sex determination and differentiation.
  The bipotential genital ridge is established by several genes including NR5A1 [;
  ]. In the XY gonad the activation of SRY expression, possibly initiated by GATA4/FOG2/NR5A1/WT1,
  leads to the upregulation of SOX9 expression via a synergy with NR5A1 [, ]. In the
  XX gonad, the supporting cell precursors accumulate β-catenin in response to RSPO1/WNT4
  signalling and repress SOX9 activity []. Once SOX9 levels reach a critical threshold,
  several positive regulatory loops are initiated, including autoregulation of its
  own expression and formation of feed-forward loops via FGF9 or PGD2 signalling [].
  At later stages, FOXL2 may repress Sox9 expression []. In the testis, SOX9 promotes
  the testis pathway, including Amh activation, and it also probably represses the
  ovarian genes Wnt4 and Foxl2 [; ; ]. DMRT1 controls sex determination in some species
  of fish and may be the master sex-determining switch in birds, but its role in mammalian
  sexual development is unclear [; ]. Much of this data has been generated from studies
  in mice.
