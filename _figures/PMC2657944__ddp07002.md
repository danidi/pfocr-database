caption: Exogenous RNAi-mediated gene silencing. RNA Pol II-derived transcripts introduce
  hairpin duplexes which structurally mimic mono or polycistronic pri-miRNAs which
  are recognized and processed by Drosha/DGCR8 into pre-miRNA-like hairpins. These
  hairpins are cleaved by Dicer/TRBP following export via exportin-5. The Pol II-generated
  U1 shRNA transcripts, which contain a 3′ terminal B-box, structurally mimic pre-miRNAs
  but are likely exported by the CRM1 pathway prior to Dicer/TRBP cleavage (). RNA
  Pol III promoters express shRNAs and long hairpin RNAs (lhRNAs) with defined 5′
  and 3′ termini. U6 or H1-derived shRNAs and lhRNAs, like pre-miRNAs, consist of
  2 nt 3′ overhangs and exit the nucleus via exportin-5. lhRNAs, are processed sequentially
  by Dicer to produce up to three siRNAs (,). tRNALys3 and tRNAVal Pol III promoters
  can also be used to produced tRNA–shRNAs for processing in the nucleus by 5′ and
  3′ tRNA processing enzymes prior to export (,). If unprocessed by RNase ZL, tRNA–shRNAs
  may exit the nucleus via exportin-t (). Synthetic siRNAs or pre-miRNA mimics can
  be introduced as Dicer substrates (typically >25 bp duplexes) or as 19 bp duplexes
  for direct loading into Ago2-RISC.
