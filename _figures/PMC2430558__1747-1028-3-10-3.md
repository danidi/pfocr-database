caption: The chromosomal passenger complex generates an alternative APC/C inhibitory
  signal that amplifies the 'wait anaphase' signal from unattached kinetochores. Based
  on different sets of data (see text for details), we propose that in response to
  inappropriately attached kinetochores, the chromosomal passenger complex not only
  destabilises these attachments but also elicits an additional signal that inhibits
  the APC/C [35]. This could be via direct phosphorylation of APC/C subunits, or via
  direct control of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Ways be which the chromosomal
  passenger complex could exert direct control over the spindle checkpoint are through
  regulation of BubR1/Bub1 kinetochore levels, modulation of the mitotic checkpoint
  complex or via an as yet unknown pathway. Regardless the mechanism, this additional
  signal is thought to amplify the unattached kinetochore-derived signal, resulting
  in a robust checkpoint response when the number of unattached kinetochores is low.
