caption: Summary of TGFβ signaling during EMT. Inactive TGFβ ligand (bound to its
  N-terminal latency associated peptide) is present in the extracellular space. After
  activation, TGFβ binds to the cell surface receptors. In the ligand-bound receptor
  complex, the type II receptor (TGFβRII) phosphorylates the juxtamembrane domain
  (small box with the symbol P) of the type I receptor (TGFβRI), which causes activation
  of Smad or other signaling proteins (collectively referred to as non-Smad pathways).
  These pathways positively or negatively regulate gene transcription; examples of
  target genes are given in the figure. The products of these genes often cooperate
  with the Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways to regulate expression of a second
  tier of genes, leading to the downregulation of epithelial genes and the upregulation
  of mesenchymal genes. These genes are classified in four functional groups based
  on their primary cellular functions (bottom grey boxes). On the left side of the
  pathway, the regulatory mechanisms are highlighted.
