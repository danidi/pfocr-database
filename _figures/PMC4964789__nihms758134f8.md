caption: Proposed mechanism of E2β activation of integrin α5β1 via GPER-1 signaling.
  E2β binding to GPER-1 at the plasma membrane promotes the dissociation of heterotrimeric
  G proteins into an α subunit and a βγ subunit on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma
  membrane. The βγ subunit promotes activation of Shc and its recruitment to integrin
  α5β1 and the formation of focal adhesions. Dissociation of Shc from integrin α5β1
  is required for its subsequent centripetal movement to fibrillar adhesions and the
  release of membrane-tethered proHB-EGF
