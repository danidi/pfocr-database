caption: Schematic models of the functions of porin proteins in mitochondrial phospholipid
  metabolism. Porin proteins integrate mitochondrial phospholipid metabolism through
  two distinct functions as follows. A, porin proteins function in the Ups1-independent
  CL accumulation. Porin proteins directly or indirectly interact with the MIM protein
  Mdm31. The interaction is prerequisite for the Ups1-independent CL accumulation
  pathway involving Fmp30, Mdm31, and Mdm32. The pathway is inhibited by mitochondrial
  PE under normal conditions, and activated under low mitochondrial PE conditions
  such as in ups2Δ or psd1Δ cells. 35 designates Mdm35. B, porin proteins function
  in the Ups1-dependent CL synthesis and Ups2-dependent PE synthesis. Porin proteins
  directly or indirectly interact with Mdm35 (designated as 35), and are required
  for the function of Mdm35 in efficient import and stabilization of Ups1 and Ups2
  in the IMS (left panel). In the absence of Mdm35 (center panel) or porin proteins
  (right panel), the Ups1 and Ups2 levels are severely reduced because of the decreased
  import and the intramitochondrial proteolysis.
