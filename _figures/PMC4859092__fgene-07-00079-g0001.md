caption: Workflow of the PSF-SOM method as applied to lung diseases. Expression data
  were analyzed in terms of pathway signal flows (PSF) in a series of KEGG canonical
  pathways. The PSF values of selected sink nodes in the pathways were then clustered
  using SOM machine learning. This method provides individual “portraits” of sink-node
  activities of each disease class. Similarities between them were studied using different
  clustering methods. For details please refer to the Methods section of the manuscript.
