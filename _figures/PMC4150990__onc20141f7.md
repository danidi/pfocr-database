caption: Suggested pathway linking chronic inflammation to cancer. In inflamed tissues,
  such as colon mucosa with UC, a high amount of IL-6 is produced. IL-6 upregulates
  c-myc protein expression, which, in turn, enhances ribosome biogenesis. The enhanced
  ribosome biogenesis is responsible for an increased MDM2-mediated p53 degradation.
  This, on one hand, may favor the EMT of the epithelial cells, and, on the other
  hand, may reduce the cell response to genotoxic DNA damages. Both consequences can
  greatly favor cancer onset.
