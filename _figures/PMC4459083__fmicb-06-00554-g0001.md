caption: Overview of the scheme for producing fatty acid-derived biofuels in yeast.
  The pathways shown in blue indicate the design and construction of acetyl-CoA overproducing
  yeast strains. In S. cerevisiae, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH) was natively
  used to produce acetyl-CoA in mitochondria, while pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) was
  used to produce acetyl-CoA in cytosol. The competing pathways, glycerophosphate
  dehydrogenase (GPD) for glycerol production and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) for
  ethanol formation, were inactivated to redirect the glycolytic fluxes to acetyl-CoA
  biosynthesis. Heterologous pathways, including cytosolic pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  PFL, pyruvate:formate lyase; PFO, pyruvate:ferrodoxin oxidoreductase; PNO, pyruvate:NADP+
  oxidoreductase; engineered PDH-bypass pathway, ACL, ATP-dependent citrate lyase;
  A-ALD, acetylating aldehyde dehydrogenase; and PK, phosphoketolase pathway were
  introduced to enhance the acetyl-CoA level in the cytosol of yeast. The pathways
  shown in orange indicate the regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis by SNF1 that
  down-regulates ACC1 activity, and a cluster of repressors of inositol-1-phosphate
  synthase (INO1), in the phospholipid metabolism. The pathways shown in green indicate
  the efforts on improving the supply of NADPH by overexpressing the malic enzyme
  and NADP-GAP dehydrogenase (NADP-GAPDH) encoded by GDP1.
