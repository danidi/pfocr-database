caption: Proposed scheme of the effects of up-regulation of HO-1 by PPARγ activation
  on HMGB1-RAGE signaling pathway in ALI/ARDS. Interaction of HMGB1 with RAGE activates
  the NF-κB and MAPK pathway, resulting in the up-regulation of HMGB1, RAGE and other
  proinflammatory mediators and promoting the development of ALI/ARDS. Activation
  of PPARγ induces HO-1 expression and subsequent suppression of HMGB1-RAGE signaling
  pathway. Therefore, we hypothesize that up-regulation of HO-1 by activation of PPARγ
  might inhibit HMGB1-RAGE signaling pathway and ameliorate the development of ALI/ARDS.
