caption: Model of kaempferol cleavage in kidney cells. Inside the cells, the B-ring
  of kaempferol is cleaved via a presumptive peroxidative mechanism, to produce CoQ
  precursors (most likely 4HB) that will enter the CoQ biosynthetic pathway to produce
  CoQ. The additional supply of this ring precursor is able to increase CoQ content
  in cells.
