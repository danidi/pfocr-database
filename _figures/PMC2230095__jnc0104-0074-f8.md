caption: Proposed model for the cAMP-dependent signaling events involved in the neurotrophic
  actions of PACAP-38 on SH-SY5Y cells. PACAP-38 binding to the PAC1 receptor, which
  couples to the activation of AC, evokes an increase in the intracellular levels
  of cAMP (). This in turn leads to the activation of PKA-dependent and PKA-independent
  mechanisms that are involved in the induction of expression of neuronal proteins
  and in neuritogenesis, respectively. The PKA-dependent mechanism involves PKA phosphorylation
  of the transcription factor CREB, initiating its activation and translocation to
  the nucleus where it may be involved in the up-regulated expression of proteins
  involved in neuronal differentiation, including Bcl-2. The PKA-independent mechanisms
  involve activation of MEK and ERK as well as p38 MAP kinase that are required for
  neuritogenesis. The MEK/ERK activation possibly occurs through one or a combination
  of different mechanisms. The neuronal MAP kinase signaling cascade involves B-Raf
  as the first component () and it has been shown that the 95 kDa B-Raf kinase is
  expressed in SH-SY5Y cells (). However, it is still unclear how cAMP activates B-Raf
  (). This may occur through activation of the cAMP-dependent Rap 1 GEF, Epac, or
  through another mechanism that may be potentiated by Epac () but may or may not
  involve Rap1 (). An additional possibility is the cAMP-mediated activation of PP2A
  () may directly induce B-Raf activation (). Activated ERK is required for neuritogenesis
  as well as being involved in the up-regulated expression of GAP-43, possibly through
  translocation to the nucleus. cAMP mediates the activation of p38 MAP kinase through
  a non-canonical pathway that may be similar to that observed in Th2 cells () and
  in cardiac fibroblasts (), and which also may involve PP2A (). Activated p38 MAP
  kinase in turn is involved in the increased expression of Bcl-2, possibly through
  phosphorylating CREB () and/or other factors, as well as in neuritogenesis. The
  arrows indicate direct interactions, the dotted arrows translocation, and the dot
  dash arrows the possibility of one or a number of intermediary steps that have not
  been worked out.
