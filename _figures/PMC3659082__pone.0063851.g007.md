caption: This scheme is discussed in the text. Although the neuron is depicted as
  close by to the pharyngeal muscle, in reality, the neuronal signal (e.g., insulin
  and/or neuropeptides) may act more like a neurohormone over a greater distance.
  The depiction of the DAF-2 receptor is intended to show different binding modes
  for insulin molecules (e.g., INS-1 vs. DAF-28). Signaling downstream of DAF-2 bifurcates
  into Path 1, mediated by PIKI-1 and ARR-1, and Path 2, the classical pathway mediated
  by AGE-1 and AKT-1. INS-?? refers to additional C. elegans insulins that participate
  in this response.
