caption: The sequential action of ecto-ATPase (CD39) and ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73),
  both of which can be induced by tumor hypoxia, to degrade ATP represents a primary
  pathway of extracellular adenosine generation in the tumor microenvironment. It
  is very likely that coordinated expression and activity of CD39/CD73 (increased)
  and ecto-adenosine deaminase ADA (decreased) which in human cells can be bound to
  the cell surface by CD26 contribute to the elevated levels of extracellular adenosine
  during tumor progression. The exact roles of CD39/CD73 on the non-malignant host
  cells (e.g. Treg) in the tumor microenvironment remain unclear. High concentrations
  of adenosine suppress antitumor T cell activation, survival and effector function
  through A2AR engagement. Meanwhile, adenosine may trigger certain adenosine receptors
  (AR) on cancer cells to promote tumor cell chemotaxis and metastasis. In addition,
  adenosine can negatively modulate differentiation and function of dendritic cells
  (DCs), and further inhibit natural killer (NK) cell proliferation and cytolytic
  function.
