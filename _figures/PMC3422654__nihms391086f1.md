caption: 'Genes Associated with Outcomes in the Context of Two Fatty Acid Metabolism
  Pathways. a) Influx of Fatty Acids and Regulation of beta-Oxidation: SLC27A6 – transports
  fatty acids into cells; ACSL1, ACSL3 – converts long-chain fatty acids into fatty
  acyl-CoA esters, capturing them in the cell; MLYCD – catalyzes the breakdown of
  malonyl-CoA, a key regulator of fatty acid beta-oxidation that inhibits the transport
  of fatty acyl CoAs into mitochondria. b) Acylation/Reacylation Pathway (Lands’ Cycle):
  AGPAT3 – reacylates the sn1 position of lysophospholipids'
