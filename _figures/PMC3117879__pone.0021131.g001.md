caption: We constructed a DMSPN based on disease genes and pathway structure data.
  First, we obtained 15149 unique gene–disease associations after processing all terms
  of gene–disease associations in the Genetic Association Database (GAD). Second,
  for each disease, we used the “k-cliques” subpathway identification method to identify
  statistically significantly enriched subpathways with P-value<0.01, to generate
  disease–metabolic subpathway associations for each disease. Finally, we combined
  these disease–metabolic subpathway associations to form the DMSPN.
