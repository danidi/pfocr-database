caption: 'The anticancer mechanisms of 17-DMAG includes canonical and noncanonical
  pathways. In canonical pathway, 17-DMAG inhibits ATPase activity of HSP90 which
  stabilizes numerous oncoproteins. The client proteins which are not stabilized by
  HSP00 are degraded by the proteasome. In noncanonical pathway, 17-DMAG exerts its
  anticancer effects by altering oxidant-antioxidant balance which includes elevating
  ROS levels while decreasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes. The elevated ROS
  generation by 17-DMAG can be attributed to its quinone ring-bearing structure, which
  eventually forms ROS-generating radicals after reacting with flavin-containing reductases
  and ascorbates. In addition, HSP90 inhibition by 17-DMAG could induce ROS production,
  possibly as a consequence of elevated ER stress. Abbreviations: ER, Endoplasmic
  reticulum; HSP90, Heat shock protein 90; ROS, Reactive oxygen species.'
