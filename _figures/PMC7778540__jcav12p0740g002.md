caption: Overlapping DEGs constructed from the PPI network by STRING and MCODE plugin
  app were analyzed again with the KEGG enrichment pathway. (A) A total of 97 DEGs
  are involved in the PPI network complex. The nodes represent proteins, and the edges
  indicate the interaction of proteins. Blue circles represent downregulated DEGs,
  and red and yellow circles represent upregulated DEGs. Yellow circles are identified
  with the highest score by MCODE module analysis (degree cutoff= 2, node score cutoff=
  0.2, k-core = 2, and max. depth = 100). (B) Seven genes (CCNE2, CCNB1, CCNB2, BUB1B,
  TTK, CDC20 and PTTG1, labeled with a red star) were significantly enriched in the
  cell cycle pathway, especially in G2/M phases. Mps1 represents TTK; BubR1 represents
  BUB1B; CycB represents both CCNB1 and CCNB2; and CycE represents CCNE2.
