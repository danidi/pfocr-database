caption: (A) Based on previous studies, it is known that Ang-1 clusters Tie2 at cell-cell
  junctions in endothelial cells while providing pro-survival signals through the
  AKT and Survivin signal transduction pathway [,,]. Alternatively, Tie1 may associate
  with integrins, including either αVß3 or α5ß1, which are preferentially localized
  at the cell interface with the basement membrane containing extracellular matrix
  components. A link between Tie1 and the extracellular matrix could explain a role
  for Tie1 in vessel integrity and sheer stress that has previously been described
  [–]. (B) When Tie2 is not at junctions, it is likely capable of associating with
  integrins. Activation of integrin-associated Tie2 via Ang-1 and fibronectin may
  enrich signaling through MAPK to further facilitate endothelial cell migration and
  proliferation.
