caption: Schematic of exosome secretion in a cancer cell model. Exosomes are secreted
  via a constitutive pathway involving the Trans-Golgi Network and/or inducible pathways,
  which can be activated by a p53-mediated response to DNA damage or Rab GTPases.
  Characteristic protein and RNA components are shown for a canonical exosome. Exosomes
  released from cancer cells can be taken up by neighboring cells and are capable
  of inducing pathways involved in cancer initiation and progression.
