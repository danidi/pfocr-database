caption: Regulation of lateral root development by ABA in Arabidopsis and Medicago.
  Key control points common to both species are initiation and meristem activation.
  Emergence from the primary root is an additional control point in Medicago. ABA
  stimulates initiation in both Arabidopsis and Medicago [,], but high concentrations
  of ABA inhibit it []. Salt stress inhibits lateral root emergence by stimulating
  ABA signaling, which induces expression of HB1, which in turn represses LBD1, required
  for emergence []. Lower levels of ABA stimulate lateral root emergence, but it is
  not known what functions downstream of ABA in this process []. Meristem activation
  is a key control point in both species, with systemic nitrate signaling via the
  classic ABA biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis and requiring ABI4 and ABI5, but
  not other ABA signaling genes []. ABA treatment in the absence of an environmental
  nitrate signal also regulates meristem activation, but does not require activity
  of any of the known ABA signaling genes []. In M. truncatula, this step requires
  activity of the MtLATD/NIP (MtNPF1.7) gene [,]. ABA treatment can bypass the requirement
  for MtLATD/NIP, inducing meristem activation in the absence of gene function [].
  Elongation of the lateral root subsequent to meristem activation is regulated by
  localized nitrate in Arabidopsis and can be repressed by ABA signaling [].
