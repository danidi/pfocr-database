caption: Scheme of the signaling pathway of S1P-elicted potentiation of α1-adrenergic
  vasoconstriction. Vasoconstriction induced by α1-adrenoreceptor activation is mediated
  exclusively by Gq/11signaling, which provokes intracellular Ca2+-release through
  PLC-derived IP3 production and consequent activation of myosin light chain kinase
  (MLCK) leading to activation of the cross-bridge cycle []. Meanwhile, S1P activates
  S1P2 receptors and the associated signaling pathway, involving G12/13 proteins,
  RhoA, and ROCK. In turn, ROCK inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), resulting
  in the retention of the phosphorylated state of myosin, which maintains the active
  cross-bridge cycle and allows for the development of sustained vasoconstriction.
  Signaling molecules identified in our previous [] and present studies are highlighted.
