caption: General principle of the HSV-TK suicide gene system. (A) The HSV-TK/prodrug-system-induced
  cytotoxicity and apoptosis in tumor cell. (I) The HSV-1 TK gene coding for thymidine
  kinase is delivered to the target cell. The expression of HSV-1 thymidine kinase
  and cellular kinases allows a prodrug (GCV) to be activated as the toxic drug (GCV-TP)
  in the cell and damage the DNA of the target cell. (II) Gene therapy induces endogenous
  apoptosis by activating p53 signaling pathway in the target cell. (III) Gene therapy
  induces exogenous apoptosis. (B) The bystander effect induces the death of adjacent
  cells. With the permission of [].
