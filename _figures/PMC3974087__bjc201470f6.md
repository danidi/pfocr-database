caption: 'Schematic diagram summarising the leptin-RhoA/ROCK-ICAM-1 pathway on the
  migration of GC cells. By binding with OB-RL, leptin activates the RhoA/ROCK pathway,
  which subsequently induces the expression of ICAM-1. All of these finally promoted
  migration of GC. Abbreviation: OB-RL=leptin receptor.'

  gastric cancer cell migration.
