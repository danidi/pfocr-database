caption: Functions of the Ac/N-end rule pathway. (A) Control of protein quality and
  subunit stoichiometry. The Ac/N-end rule pathway targets misfolded proteins or unassembled
  subunit(s) of complex proteins with Ac/N-degrons. (B) Regulation of blood pressure
  via G-protein signaling. The Ac/N-end rule pathway degrades Nt-acetylated wild-type
  MQ-Rgs2. In contrast, the hypertension-related ML-Rgs2 with a Met-Ф degron is targeted
  by either the Ac/N-end rule pathway or the Arg/N-end rule pathway according to its
  Nt-acetylation status. Dual targeting of ML-Rgs2 by two branches of the N-end rule
  pathways dramatically decreases Rgs2 levels, and thereby increases blood pressure
  via augmented G-protein signaling and subsequent vasoconstriction. (C) Dysregulation
  of Nt-acetylation most likely affects protein stability, thus causing many cancers.
  (D) Control of pathogen immunity in plants. Plants contain two SNC1 (suppressors
  of nod-like protein receptor 1) variants with Met-Met-Asp (MMD) or Met-Asp (MD)
  N-termini owing to alternative translation. NatA Nt-acetylates MMD-SNC1 for degradation,
  whereas NatB Nt-acetylates MD-SNC1 for stabilization. Consequently, the steady-state
  levels of SNC1 are directly involved in plant immunity.
