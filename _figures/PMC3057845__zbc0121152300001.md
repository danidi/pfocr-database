caption: 'Statins acting on the sterol biosynthesis pathway. A, the biosynthetic formation
  of sterols, such as cholesterol, starts from acetyl-CoA and leads via the C15-intermediate
  farnesyl-PP to its various end products. The involved enzymes are numbered as follows:
  1, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; 2, HMG-CoA synthase; 3, HMG-CoA reductase; 4, mevalonate
  kinase; 5, phosphomevalonate kinase; 6, mevalonate-PP decarboxylase; 7, isopentenyl-PP
  isomerase; 8, farnesyl-PP synthase; 9, squalene synthase; 10, squalene monooxygenase;
  11, squalene epoxidase; 12, Dol-P-Man synthase; 13, protein farnesyltransferase;
  14, geranylgeranyl-PP synthase; and 15, protein geranylgeranyltransferase. At the
  point of farnesyl-PP, the pathway diverges to the formation of prenylated proteins,
  ubiquinone, or Dol. The polyisoprene Dol-P is incorporated into Dol-P-Man, a key
  intermediate in protein glycosylation and GPI anchor formation. Whereas pravastatin,
  lovastatin, and rosuvastatin lower cellular cholesterol levels by inhibiting the
  pathway at the stage of the HMG-CoA reductase, ZGA achieves this by inhibiting the
  squalene synthase. B, the chemical structure of ZGA is depicted.'
