caption: Scheme of the Synthesis and Assembly of Rubisco in Tobacco Transformants
  with a Plastid Transgene Expressing the Small Subunit Precursor (pre-SSu).The dashed
  arrows indicate steps that may be rate limiting for the production of chloroplast-synthesized
  small subunits. Arrow 1 indicates the rates of engagement of the RbcS mRNA with
  the chloroplast ribosomes and its subsequent translation. The arrows labeled 2 indicate
  possible access routes of the newly synthesized small subunits to the Rubisco assembly
  pathway. See text for details. Chaperone complexes are indicated by the paired bracket-shaped
  symbols. BSD2, product of the BUNDLE SHEATH DEFECTIVE 2 gene (); Cpn60 and Cpn21,
  chloroplast chaperonins 60 and 21; DnaJ, Hsp70, GrpE, and ClpC, chaperone proteins
  thought to be involved in import and assembly of Rubisco (; ); LSu and SSu, large
  and small subunits of Rubisco; Nα-methylase, enzyme responsible for methylating
  the α-amino group at the N terminus of the mature small subunit after cleavage of
  the transit peptide (; ); SPP, stromal processing peptidase; TIC and TOC, translocons
  of the inner and outer chloroplast membranes (); tp, transit peptide.
