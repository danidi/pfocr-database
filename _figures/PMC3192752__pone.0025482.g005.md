caption: Bile acids are the main metabolites of cholesterol (CHOL). Primary bile acids
  (blue ovals; cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)) are produced by
  endogenous enzymes in the liver and are modified by bacteria of the genus Clostridia
  colonizing the gut to form secondary bile acids (yellow ovals; lithocholic acid
  (LCA) and deoxycholic acid ). Arrows broken by double lines represent multiple enzymatic
  steps and only the genes encoding the rate limiting enzymes are listed. The bacterial
  operon baiABCDEFGHI encodes eight enzymes and a bile acid transporter that together
  form the pathway for synthesis of secondary bile acids. The amino acids glycine
  and taurine are conjugated to primary and secondary bile acids in the liver by the
  host encoded bile acid-CoA amino acid transferase (BAAT) to form tauro- and glycolithocholic
  acid (TLCA, GLCA) and tauro- and glycodeoxycholic acid (TDCA GDCA). Gut bacteria
  of genus Lactobacillus catalyze the conversion of cholesterol metabolites to coprostanol
  (COPR) and can limit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol.
