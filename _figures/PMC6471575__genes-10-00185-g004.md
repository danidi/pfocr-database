caption: The role of HKII and miR-143 in cancer. (a) In a cancer cell, aerobic glycolysis
  occurs with an increased uptake of glucose and production of lactate even in the
  presence of oxygen (in normal cells glycolysis is anaerobic) and is known as the
  “Warburg effect”. Upregulation of Hexokinase 2 (HKII) in malignant tumours catalyses
  the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) in the first step of the
  glycolysis pathway (1) with high consumption of ATP to ADP (2) to maintain the high
  rate of glycolysis required. G-6-P undergoes multiple conversions to pyruvate (3),
  which together with high lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) activity in one direction
  (4) results in lactic acid production in the cytosol, incorporation of carbon precursors
  and increased cancer cell proliferation (5). Oxidation of pyruvate in the mitochondrion
  is reduced resulting in reduced citrate production for the citric acid cycle (CAC)
  (6). HKII bound to the mitochondrial membrane can also enhance cancer by increasing
  mitochondrial resistance to cell death signals helping to reduce apoptosis (7).
  Downregulation of miR-143 has been shown to directly reduce inhibition of HKII (8)
  causing increased glycolysis and tumour proliferation. (b) In a lymphoid cell, we
  propose that in the presence of the protective MIR143 SNP rs17723799 genotype CT
  or TT, there may be increased MIR143 expression and miR-143 transcription with increased
  targeting of HKII and reduced glycolysis via the Warburg effect causing decreased
  lymphomagenesis. This hypothesis is speculative, and further functional studies
  are required. ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; CAC, citric
  acid cycle; GLUT, glucose transporter; LDH-A, lactate dehydrogenase A. (Adapted
