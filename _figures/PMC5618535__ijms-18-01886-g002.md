caption: The role of PALB2 in the DNA damage repair. Schematic representation of double
  strand break (DSB) induction and resolution throughout the HR repair pathway. Double
  strand breaks can result from different sources (as a by-product of the FA pathway,
  ionizing radiation treatment or replication fork collapse in response to replicative
  stress). After the DSB is induced, the MRN (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1) sensor complex recognizes
  and binds this structure. ATM is then recruited and activated, leading to the phosphorylation
  of H2AX (γH2AX), amplifying the initial signaling. The signal transduction leads
  to BRCA1 recruitment to the DNA damaged site, driving the HR repair by inhibition
  of 53BP1 and consequently the Non Homologous End-joining (NHEJ) pathway. At this
  point, PALB2 is found phosphorylated (pS64; in red) by Cyclin-dependent Kinases
  (CDKs), which prevents its interaction with BRCA1. Then, the 5′ DNA end resection
  is performed by C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) Interacting protein (CtIP), Exonuclease
  1 (Exo1) and DNA2 exonuclease activities. The replication protein A (RPA) caps the
  exposed ssDNA, culminating in the activation of ATR and PALB2 (pS59; in green),
  which favors PALB2-BRCA1 interaction (in contrast with pS64). Thus, BRCA1 recruits
  PALB2, BRCA2 and RAD51, promoting exchange of RPA by RAD51, nucleofilament formation
  and strand invasion. Later, the repaired DNA is resolved in a Holliday junction-mediated
  (light blue and purple arrowheads represent the crossover and non-crossover resolution
  types, respectively) or by synthesis dependent strand annealing-dependent (SDSA)
  manner.
