caption: 'The non-specific nature of airway hyperreactivity and a convergent signalling
  pathway for spasmogens: hope for a novel therapy for asthma? ASM receives diverse
  excitatory inputs from the innervation, inflammatory cells, and the epithelium,
  all of which act through distinct receptors, but a common signalling pathway. In
  asthma, the smooth muscle exhibits increased sensitivity to a wide range of excitatory
  stimuli. The non-specific nature of airway hyperreactivity suggests that some post-receptor
  mechanism(s) within the smooth muscle per se is altered. Spasmogens act through
  a convergent signalling pathway involving Ca2+-handling and RhoA.'
