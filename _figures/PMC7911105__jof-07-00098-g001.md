caption: Itaconate biosynthesis pathway in Ustilago maydis with a proposed acetate
  and formate assimilation. Pyruvate is generated from glucose through glycolysis
  taking place in the cytoplasm. It enters the mitochondria, where it is converted
  to acetyl-CoA and forms citrate together with oxaloacetate during the TCA cycle.
  Citrate is dehydrated to cis-aconitate which is transported from the mitochondria
  into the cytosol via the mitochondrial tricarboxylate transporter Mtt1. In the cytosol,
  cis-aconitate is converted into itaconate via the intermediate trans-aconitate.
  Itaconate can be further converted to 2-hydroxyparaconate (2-HP) by Cyp3. 2-hydroxyparaconate
  might be converted to itatartarate (ITT) by Rdo1. Secretion of itaconate and possibly
  2-hydroxyparaconate and itartarate into the medium is mediated by the major facilitator
  Itp1. Modified from [,]. Proposed acetate assimilation modified from [,]. Acetate
  enters the cell via passive diffusion and/or via putative acetate transporters [,,].
  It serves as a substrate for the enzyme acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) [], which converts
  acetate to acetyl-CoA in the cytosol []. Growth on acetate depends on peroxisomal
  activation to short acyl-CoAs including acetyl-CoA and its shuttling to the mitochondria
  via carnitine []. Proposed formate assimilation via formate dehydrogenases is known
  for methylotrophic microorganisms []. These enzymes are also present in U. maydis
  []. Indicated circle segments represent the number of carbon atoms per molecule.
  Blue circles indicate carbon derived from conventional glucose whereas green color
  indicates carbon possibly derived from CO2.
