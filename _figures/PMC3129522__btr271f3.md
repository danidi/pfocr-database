caption: Pathways inferred by applying algorithm InferPathway onto the E.coli metabolic
  network. Nodes are labeled by the metabolite name used in KEGG. Edges are labeled
  by the SCLself of the link, along with the reaction ID used in KEGG of one of the
  reactions that make available the transition shown in parentheses. The solid connections
  correspond to the top 9 results returned from our method. (i) Lysine Biosynthesis.
  (ii) Pentose Phosphate Pathway. (iii) Glycolysis. Dim solid connections are the
  annotated pathway and the second result returned by our method. The top result uses
  the shortcut that is shown in dark color. (iv) Methionine Biosynthesis. Dark solid
  connections are the top result returned by our method. The annotated pathway differs
  from the first result by the dashed connections. The second result differs from
  the first result by the dark solid connections. (v) TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle.
  The annotated TCA cycle is shown in dim color (the dashed links are missing from
  the result).
