caption: A model for the response to rereplication in mitotic cycling and endocycling
  cells. Overexpression of Dup results in rereplication, DNA damage, and activation
  of ATM, in mitotic cycling and endocycling cells. Active ATM is known to phosphorylate
  H2AV and also Chk2, which in turn phosphorylates p53, thereby activating its transcriptional
  activity. In mitotic cycling cells after rereplication, transcription of the proapoptotic
  genes at the H99 locus is induced by p53, and perhaps also other transcription factors
  via a p53-independent pathway (dotted arrows). In endocycling cells, proapoptotic
  gene expression is dampened, perhaps by an epigenetic silencing at the H99 locus
  (circles depict repressed chromatin). This would blunt the ability of p53 and other
  transcription factors to induce transcription of these genes in the endocycling
  cells. (Circle inset above) Unchallenged endocycling cells also have DNA damage
  at difficult-to-replicate euchromatin–heterochromatin junctions during endoreduplication,
  explaining their need to block apoptosis downstream from active ATM.
