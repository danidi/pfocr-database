caption: (A) 14-3-3 dimers bind and retain inactive B-Raf protein in the cytosol.
  (B) In response to exogenous stimuli, tyrosine kinase (TK) receptors activate the
  G protein RAS, which in turn binds the serine-threonine kinase B-Raf after inducing
  a conformational change by dephosphorylating the N-terminal 14-3-3-binding sites,
  thus allowing its recruitment to plasma membrane. Activated B-Raf then phosphorylates
  (PO4−) and activates MAPKs/MAPKKs (phospho-ERK1/2), which translocate to the nucleus
  where they regulate chromatin remodelling and gene expression. Phospho-ERK1/2 then
  phosphorylates the transactivating domain of various transcription factors within
  the promoter region of early and delayed response genes. This process coordinates
  a highly interconnected and integrated cellular signaling networks that orchestrates
  the nuclear response to the extra-cellular microenvironment.
