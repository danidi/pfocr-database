caption: 'Cellular and molecular responses to extracellular and intracellular DNA.
  The schematic shows involvement of extracellular DNases in anti-DNA responses/ SLE
  pathogenesis and intracellular DNases in interferonopathies. The major molecular
  pathways of autoantibody and autoinflammatory responses are highlighted in different
  colors as described below. Yellow: Primary cellular and molecular pathways of anti-DNA
  Ab production. DNase1L3-deficiency increases availability and uptake of cfDNA (naked
  DNA, NET-DNA, cell-free chromatin, and microparticle-associated chromatin), along
  with associated proteins potentially through self-reactive BCRs or through cell-surface
  TLRs. Internalized self-DNA causes TLR-MyD88 dependent B cell activation, differentiation,
  IFN production, and presentation of cfDNA-associated peptides to T cells. Blue:
  T cells help in anti-DNA Ab production. Costimulatory and cognate MHC-TCR interactions
  between DNA-reactive B and T cells stimulate activation, proliferation, and differentiation
  of B cells into anti-DNA Ab secreting cells. Purple: Amplification of anti-DNA Abs
  through myeloid cell help. Anti-DNA antibodies accumulate and form immune complexes
  with cfDNA which are internalized through Fc-receptors on myeloid cells i.e., DCs,
  pDCs, macrophages, further inducing IFN production through TLR-MyD88 pathway. Myeloid
  cells also present self-antigen to T cells further amplifying the B-T cell interaction
  loop and anti-DNA Ab production. Red: Undigested DNA promotes IC formation and deposition
  in target organs. DNase1 expressed in kidneys digests locally produced apoptotic
  cell-derived DNA. IC-formation is enhanced in the presence of extracellular DNA.
  ICs deposit in kidneys causing immune complex-mediated tissue damage. Green: DNases
  and signaling pathways regulating interferonopathies. DNase2 cleaves endocytosed
  apoptotic cell-derived DNA while TREX1 cleaves cytosolic DNA. Absence of DNase2
  and TREX1 trigger activation of cGAS-STING pathway causing IFN production leading
  to interferonopathies. DNase2 and TREX1 do not directly contribute to anti-DNA antibody
  production.'
