caption: Schematic diagram of ergosterol-responsive promoters for controlling the
  metabolic flux towards erogosterol biosynthesis pathway. Genes from the mevalonate
  pathway in S. cerevisiae are shown in blue; heterologous expression of ADS gene
  is shown in green; and genes from ergosterol biosynthesis pathway are shown in red.
  The ERG9 expression is put under the control of ergosterol-responsive promoter (PERG)
  to achieve dynamic control of squalene synthase availability in response to intracellular
  ergosterol levels. The pathway intermediates IPP, DMAPP and FPP are defined as isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate, dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl diphosphate, respectively.
