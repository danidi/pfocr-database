caption: Schematic that demonstrates the involvement of TG2 in TGFβ1-mediated EndMT
  and its role in capillary rarefaction. Following tissue insult, increases in fibrotic
  cytokines such as TGFβ1 has a key role in inducing EndMT. TG2 regulates TGFβ1-mediated
  EndMT via the Smad2/3 signalling pathway. During EndMT, endothelial cells lose their
  endothelial phenotype (including their tight junctions) and develop a mesenchymal
  phenotype (such as increased FN deposition and αSMA expression) to become myofibroblast-like
  cells. Induction of myofibroblasts from endothelial cells leads to capillary rarefaction
  and the laying down of a disrupted fibrotic matrix leading to organ fibrosis
