caption: Angiocrine mechanisms during fetal lung development. In this study, we examined
  the role of HGF as a downstream mediator of the VEGF signaling pathway utilizing
  SU-5416, a VEGF-R inhibitor, eNOS−/− mice, and JNJ, a selective c-Met antagonist.
  We speculate that low fetal oxygen tension increases hypoxia inducible factor 1α
  (HIF-1α) activity and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression within
  alveolar type II (AT2) cells of the fetal lung. VEGF is secreted in a paracrine
  fashion and binds the VEGF-receptor (VEGF-R) of PAEC, inducing the production of
  HGF and nitric oxide (NO). The autocrine action of NO stimulates PAEC proliferation
  and angiogenesis. HGF acts in both autocrine and paracrine fashions via the c-Met
  receptor, stimulating PAEC growth and angiogenesis, as well as AT2 cell proliferation
  and enhancing alveolarization. Exposure to hyperoxia disrupts this cellular communication
  pathway between AT2 cells and PAEC by downregulating VEGF production perhaps through
  downregulation of HIF-1α activity.
