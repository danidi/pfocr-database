number: Figure 1
caption: Schematic illustration of the integrin-linked kinase-protein kinase B (ILK-PKB)
  signaling pathway. Integrin-linked kinase forms, together with PINCH (particularly
  interesting Cys-His-rich protein) and parvin, the ILK-PINCH-parvin (IPP) complex
  and mediates signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the cytoplasm through
  integrins. The phosphorylated downstream target PKB facilitates the expression of
  stretch responsive genes such as the atrial natriuretic factor (anf), thereby effectively
  transducing signals from the cardiac stretch sensor. Reduced PKB phosphorylation
  in ILK deficient main squeeze mutant zebrafish hearts was demonstrated to lead to
  impaired cardiac contractility and heart failure []. In this context, the inhibition
  of protein phosphatases (PP) by small chemical compounds that results in an increase
  of PKB phosphorylation might be a promising therapeutic approach to treat ILK-associated
  cardiomyopathies.
