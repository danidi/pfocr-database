caption: 'Innate and adaptive immune responses in the initiation and perpetuation
  of SpAThe JAK pathway sits at the crossroads of both key innate and adaptive immune
  cell populations that are thought to be important in SpA pathogenesis. The tissue-specific
  targets of SpA-related disease, including the skeleton, skin and gut, interact with
  diverse innate immune cells to maintain tissue homeostasis. Although SpA is immunologically
  heterogeneous, there is strong evidence for adaptive immune responses that could
  be due to autoantigens or to other antigens that breech tissue barriers. JAK: Janus
  kinase; Tc: cytotoxic T cell; Th: T helper; TYK: tyrosine kinase.'
