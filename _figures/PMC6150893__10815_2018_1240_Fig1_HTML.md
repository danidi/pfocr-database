caption: Pathway of mitochondrial dysfunction in granulosa cells from primordial follicles.
  Illustrative presentation of the ‘mitochondrial dysfunction’ signalling pathway
  (n = 30) in granulosa cells from primordial follicles. Annotated genes are heavily
  involved in mitochondrial energy production and free radical scavenging mechanisms
  (see text for details). The figure was generated based on transcripts annotated
  the mitochondrial dysfunction signalling pathway using Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis
  software. Colour intensities are based on FPKM mean values where high significance
  is most intensive in colour (red)
