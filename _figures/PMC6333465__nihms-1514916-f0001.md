caption: Main signaling pathways in UPR/ER stress. The UPR has three main signaling
  branches. IRE1 pathway catalyzes the splicing of X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1)
  mRNA and cleaves special mRNAs by regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). PERK phosphorylates
  and inactivates eukaryotic translation initiator factor 2α (eIF2α) resulting in
  the repression of protein translation and the transcription of apoptotic genes.
  ATF6 is transported to the Golgi apparatus and cleaved by the Site-1 and -2 Proteases
  (SiP1, S2P). Then it migrates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of
  chaperone genes.
