caption: A scheme of cross-talk interactions in the mechanism of liver IRI between
  IRF3-dependent Type-I IFN signaling downstream of TLR4 activation and HO-1/Nrf2
  system. IFNAR deficiency promotes cytoprotection by upregulating HO-1/Nrf2, which
  also blocks STAT1-mediated IFN target genes (e.g., CXCL10) (). In addition, myeloid
  HO-1 may regulate innate immunity through its direct binding to the transcription
  factor IRF3 and modulating IFN-β expression ().
