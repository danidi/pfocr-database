caption: Simplified metabolic scheme showing the two strategies for increased NADPH
  availability in connection to the 3HB production pathway. The first strategy involves
  reducing the NADPH expenditure of the cell by providing glutamate as a second nitrogen
  source to ammonia, allowing a major NADPH sink to be bypassed. The second strategy
  involves overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (zwf) to redirect some
  of the glycolytic flux to the pentose phosphate pathway, increasing the amount of
  NADPH synthesized
