caption: (A) Schematic of the IL-6–IL-6R–STAT3 pathway and our strategy to inhibit
  the pathway. (B) Cells were stained with anti-hMSH3 antibody (green) and DAPI (blue)
  to monitor the hMSH3 localization upon various treatments. (C) Total cell extract
  was fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions for Western blotting to quantitate
  the amount of cytosolic and/or nuclear hMSH3. Histone 3 (H3) is used as a nuclear
  marker and α-Tubulin serves as a cytosolic marker. N/C=nuclear to cytosolic ratio
  for hMSH3. N/C ratios of zero are fractions smaller than 0.1, and are not truly
  zero.
