caption: A schematic diagram summarizing possible mechanisms underlying the risk associations
  of cancer with diabetes and the attenuating effects of statins, renin-angiotensin-system
  inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor
  blockers), insulin and oral anti-diabetic drugs on cancer risk. Apart from obesity-associated
  insulin resistance, which can activate cell-signaling pathways such as the insulin-like
  growth factor-1 (IGF1) pathway to increase risk of cancer, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia
  due to insufficient insulin action can activate angiotensin II, inflammatory and
  redox pathways that share multiple intracellular signals, including sterol regulatory
  element-binding proteins (SREBP), 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA-reductase (HMGCR),
  adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and nuclear factor kappa
  B (NF-KB) pathways to cause abnormal cell cycles to increase cancer risk. Treatment
  with RAS and HMGCR inhibitors together with correction of hyperglycemia including
  insulin, insulin sensitizers and insulin secretagogues can block these pathways
  at multiple sites to break the vicious cycles. ACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme
  inhibitors; ARB, angiotensin II blockers; OAD, oral anti-diabetic drugs.
