caption: Proposed model of an energy balance-responsive network associated with DNMT1
  regulation, DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation of ERα and ERβ. Obesity
  and associated energy excess results in several metabolic perturbations that are
  ameliorated by calorie restriction. To identify regulatory relationships between
  DNMT1 and other genes that were differentially expressed in our RNA-seq analysis,
  we used the Path Designer function of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). We found
  transcription factors STAT3, NF-kB and E2F to have direct relationships with DNMT1
  activation. Upstream of these relationships, IPA also linked growth factors such
  as insulin and EGF, as well as cytokines including TNF, IL-1β and IL-8, to the E2F,
  STAT3 and NF-kB signaling pathways. We propose that one consequence of obesity-associated
  growth factor and cytokine signaling is increased DNMT1 activation, which in turn
  can modulate DNA methylation and impact transcription of important genes in breast
  cancer such, as ERα and ERβ. Methylated CpG dinucleotides are indicated by red circles,
  unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are indicated by white circles.
