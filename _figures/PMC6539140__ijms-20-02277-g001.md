caption: Metabolic pathway of nitrate (NO3−), nitrite (NO2−), nitric oxide (NO), nitrosamines,
  nitrosamides, and the effect of vitamin C. Nitric oxide (NO) is mainly responsible
  for the physiological effects of beetroot juice (BRJ). The body uses arginine (C6H14N4O2)
  as a source to form NO, and for this reaction oxygen is needed. However, NO can
  also be formed after intake of nitrate-rich products such as BRJ. Ingested nitrate
  (NO3−) will be partly reduced to nitrite (NO2−) by microflora in the oral cavity.
  In oxygen-poor environments nitrate and nitrite can be reduced into NO. NO can also
  be oxidized back into nitrate and nitrite which are water soluble and can therefore
  be excreted in urine. Under acidic conditions, such as in the human stomach, nitrite
  will react with the H+ and will form HNO2 (nitrous acid). Also in the stomach, two
  molecules HNO2 can form N2O3 (dinitrogen trioxide), by proton catalysis. N2O3 plays
  a role in the N-nitrosation rate. Increasing the amount of nitrate will therefore
  lead to an increase in the N-nitrosation rate. Subsequently, HNO2 can react with
  amides to form nitrosamides (HN2O2), and N2O3 can react with amines to form nitrosamines
  (H2N2O). Both nitrosamides and nitrosamines are N-nitroso compounds and potentially
  carcinogenic. Vitamin C (C6H8O6) can inhibit the nitrosation process, because it
  reacts faster than the amine with N2O3. Vitamin C reduces 2HNO2 to NO, and is itself
  oxidized to dehydroascorbic acid. This will reduce the amount of N-nitroso compounds
  that can be formed.
