caption: Activation of the IRE1-bZIP60 mediated UPR pathway against ER stress. Under
  normal conditions, the sensor domain of IRE1 binds to the ER-luminal Binding protein
  (BiP) and the full-length bZIP60 is anchored in the ER membrane. In response to
  ER-stress, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate (MEcPP) is accumulated
  in the chloroplast and activates the Calmodulin-Binding Transcription Activator
  3 (CAMTA3)-TF, which binds to the rapid stress response element (RSRE) and up-regulates
  bZIP60 expression. A1–A6 indicates the step-wise activation process of IRE1. (A1)
  In response to ER stress, BiP dissociates from IRE1 to assist the proper folding
  of the accumulated unfolded proteins. The released IRE1 is dimerized to align its
  cytosolic kinase domains in such a way that they trans-autophosphorylate each other
  to activate the RNase function. (A2) The luminal domain of IRE1 binds to the hydrophobic
  domain of the unfolded proteins and triggers oligomerization and clustering. (A3)
  The mRNAs encoding the secretory pathway proteins are promiscuously cleaved by the
  proteins of the regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) pathway. (A4) The basic linker
  region of IRE1 mediates specific recruitment and docking of the unspliced bZIP60
  mRNA to IRE1 clusters where it is cleaved explicitly at the two conserved sites
  (CXG| XXG) present in the kissing stem–loop structure. (A5) The tRNA ligase RLG1
  catalyzes the ligation of the resulting fragments of the bZIP60 mRNA. (A6) Translation
  of the spliced bZIP60 mRNA results in the production of the active bZIP60 protein
  (bZIP60s). It translocates to the nucleus forming the bZIP28-NF-Y-TFs complex. These

  UPR-related downstream gene expression.
