caption: Proteins significantly altered by torcetrapib associated with insulin sensitivity
  or pancreatic β-cell function. Nodes represent gene symbol name, corresponding to
  protein measured. Degree of intensity of the node color (red) indicates degree of
  significance of false discovery rate P value. Dashed lines correspond to the implicated
  function of the given proteins according to the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis knowledge
  bank. Node shapes denote cytokine (□), growth factor (□), kinase (▽), peptidase
  (), transmembrane receptor (), transporter (), and other (○). ADIPO1 indicates adiponectin;
  C1Q, and collagen domain containing; APOE, apolipoprotein E, FSTL3, follistatin-like
  3; GHR, growth hormone receptor; MAPK8, mitogen-activated protein kinase-8; MMP2,
  matrix metalloproteinase-2; PRKCQ, protein kinase Cθ type; TGFB1, transforming growth
  factor-β1; and TNSFSF12, tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 12. *Given protein
  was represented in the modified aptamer assay more than once.
