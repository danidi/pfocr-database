caption: Schematic model shows the downstream signaling pathway of PIP5K1α and the
  effect of ISA-2011B inhibition. The model depicts PIP5K1α as the key kinase responsible
  for generation of PIP2. In turn, PIP2 serves as a precursor molecule required for
  PI3K activity and generation of PIP3. PIP3 is involved in the downstream activation
  of AKT, and AKT-related signaling pathways. ISA-2011B is able to enter into the
  cell and inhibit PIP5K1α. This leads to the reduced production of PIP2 and PIP3
  and a subsequent inhibition of PI3K/AKT, but sustained P27 and down-regulation of
  CDK1 and other cell cycle regulators. Inhibition of AR signaling pathways is mediated
  through CDK1 in part via a feedback loop.
