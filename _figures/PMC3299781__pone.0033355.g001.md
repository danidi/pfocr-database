caption: Onset of infection in sepsis leads to an up-regulation of inducible nitric
  oxide synthase (NOS) in response to lipopolysaccharide and pro-inflammatory cytokines.
  This consequently increases nitric oxide (NO) production, which has a multitude
  of effects on endothelial, vascular, and immune function. Asymmetric dimethylarginine
  (ADMA) is produced by the methylation of arginine residues on proteins by the enzyme
  protein-arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) and metabolized by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase
  (DDAH). ADMA competitively inhibits NOS, thereby limiting NO production.
