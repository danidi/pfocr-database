caption: Overview of the main cellular protein clearance mechanisms, the ubiquitin–proteasome
  system (UPS), and the autophagy pathway. Protein degradation by the UPS is initiated
  by the specific labeling of target proteins with ubiquitin. Attachment of a ubiquitin
  molecule requires the action of three enzymes, an ATP-dependent ubiquitin-activating
  enzyme (E1), a subsequent ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and finally a ubiquitin
  ligase (E3) that transfers the ubiquitin from E2 to a target protein. After (poly)ubiquitination,
  the target protein is recognized and degraded by the 26S proteasome. Proteasomes
  contain a 19S regulatory particle and a catalytic active core particle (20S). The
  19S regulatory particle recognizes the substrates, deubiquitinates the substrates,
  and unfolds them at the expense of ATP. The unfolded protein is translocated into
  the active chamber of the 20S particle to be degraded by the different proteases.
  The lower part of the figure represents the autophagy pathway. Autophagosomes are
  initiated by the formation of a phagophore at the outer surface of the ER through
  the action of the ATG1 complex, ATG9, and the PI3K complex. The growing phagophore
  surrounds cellular targets in either a selective or nonselective manner. Especially
  ATG8 plays a major role in substrate recognition for both the selective and nonselective
  pathways. A mature autophagosome moves toward the vacuole and fuses with it to release
  its cargo for proteolytic processing.
