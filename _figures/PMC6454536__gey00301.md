caption: A general scheme for the induction of gene expression through the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE
  signalling pathway (adapted from Kensler et al. ()). Nrf2-regulated genes are activated
  as a result of exposure to endogenous or exogenous molecules. This leads to disruption
  of Nrf2 interaction with Keap1 leading to stabilisation of Nrf2 protein and its
  nuclear accumulation. Nrf2 interacts with multiple partners in the nucleus allowing
  for transactivation of ARE-responsive genes. Induction of these genes results in
  resistance of cells to environmental stresses.
