caption: Schematic comparison of relative gene expression (to that in pale yellow
  callus) and carotenoid contents in dark orange (d-o) callus and roots. A simplified
  biosynthesis pathway of carotenoids and their precursors are shown with genes analyzed
  in this paper and listed in Suppl. Table S1. Carotenoid and α-tocopherol contents
  in d-o callus and roots are represented by dark orange and orange bars, respectively.
  The bar height is proportional to the relative content of a given compound in both
  tissues. Numbers show the compound content ratios relative to the contents in p-y
  callus. Gene expression levels, relative to the expression in pale yellow (p-y)
  callus, are represented by arrows with numbers indicating fold difference and arrow
  widths proportional to expression levels, or by a horizontal line if there is no
  significant change in expression level in comparison to p-y callus. Relative expression
  of the candidate regulatory Y gene is shown in the box with a dashed border. n.d.
  transcripts not detected. Exact expression values are given in Suppl. Table S2
