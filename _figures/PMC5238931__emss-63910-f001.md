caption: A) When BH4 levels are sufficient oxidation of L-arginine is coupled with
  the reduction of molecular oxygen to form NO and L-citrulline. When BH4 levels become
  limiting, due to either a reduced biosynthesis or due to oxidative loss, NOS enzymes
  become uncoupled and superoxide is produced as an alternative product of the enzyme.
  This production of superoxide can cause a further oxidative loss of BH4 potentiating
  a state of oxidative stress in the vasculature. B) BH4 is produced from GTP by a
  multi-step enzyme pathway. GTPCH is the rate-limiting enzyme in the majority of
  cells in the de novo production of BH4. BH4 is susceptible to oxidation, due to
  production of ROS from uncoupled eNOS or other ROS producing enzymes. BH4 can be
  reformed from the oxidised form, BH2, by the action of a salvage pathway, dependent
  on dihydrofolate reductase.
