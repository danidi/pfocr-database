caption: 'Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis pathway from acetyl-CoA and some of
  their related regulatory circuits. Under starvation conditions (nitrogen and phosphorus
  deficiency), overall reduction in the rate of protein synthesis is observed. The
  electron transfer activity is downregulated and ATP production decreases, resulting
  in an increased NADPH pool that favors the accumulation of the storage compound
  PHB. However, the synthesis of certain proteins required for acclimation process
  is enhanced upon nutrient limitation. Iron presence is required for the upregulation
  of at least one of these proteins (alkaline phosphatase enzyme). PHB precursors
  in bold in dark boxes. Related metabolic processes in bold in medium-color boxes.
  Critical enzymes in light-color boxes. Red lines indicate negative regulatory effects.
  Abbreviations: Acetil-CoA Acetil coenzima A, TCA cycle Citric acid cycle, HSCoA
  Coenzyme A, NADPH+H+ Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, NADP+
