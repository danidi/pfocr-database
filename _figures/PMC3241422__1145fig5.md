caption: The involvement of PIP2 in the delivery of actin to the Rho1–formin complex.
  (A) Profilin is an actin-binding protein that delivers actin to the actin-nucleating
  formins Bni1 and Bnr1. The profilin–actin complex is recruited to the PM by PIP2,
  where it is bound by the active Rho1–formin complex. At least one additional Rho1
  effector, Sec3, is also recruited to the PM by PIP2 (not shown). (B) Upon delivery
  of actin to the formin, PIP2 is thought to stimulate the release of actin from profilin,
  thereby driving actin polymerization.
