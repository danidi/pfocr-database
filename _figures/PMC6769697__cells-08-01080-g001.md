caption: Schematic depiction of copper and platinum distribution in tumor cell. Copper
  (Cu) and cisplatin (Pt) taken up via CTR1 (red) are transferred to chaperones ATOX1,
  CCS and COX17, which ferry Cu or Pt derivates (black dash arrows) to ATP7A/B (blue)
  in the Golgi, to Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase (magenta) in the cytosol and to cytochrome
  c oxidase (green) in the mitochondria respectively. In the Golgi ATP7A/B load Cu
  on newly synthesized cuproenzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX, orange ball), which traffics
  along the biosynthetic pathway (orange arrows). Metallated LOX is secreted to the
  cell exterior (orange arrows), where it promotes migration and invasion (orange
  dash arrow) of the malignant cell. A significant increase in intracellular Pt induces
  export of ATP7A/B (blue arrow) towards vesicular compartment and cell membrane where
  ATP7A/B drives the sequestration and efflux of excessive Pt. Bold black arrows indicate
  Pt/Cu translocation across the membrane.
