caption: Schematic representation of the Ipecac alkaloid biosynthetic pathway. Major
  reactions catalyzed by IpeOMT1, IpeOMT2, IpeOMT3 and IpeGlu1, and the probable subcellular
  compartments where each reaction is performed are shown. Dopamine is synthesized
  in cytosol and accumulated in the vacuole., In comparison, strictosidine, an intermediate
  for terpenoid-indole alkaloid biosynthesis formed by condensation of tryptamine
  and secologanin, is synthesized and stored in the vacuole., Thus, the condensation
  reactions of dopamine and secologanin and of dopamine and protoemetine are likely
  to be performed in the vacuole. Subcellular compartments of the produced Ipecac
  alkaloids, such as emetine, cephaeline, ipecoside and its methyl derivatives, have
  not yet been elucidated. See refs.  and  for spontaneous reactions leading from
  6-O-methyl-N-deacetylisoipecoside aglycon to the iminium cation and the branched
  Ipecac alkaloid biosynthetic pathway, respectively.
