caption: TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR6 are expressed at the cell surface for extracellular
  ligand recognition whereas TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 are localized in the endosomal compartment
  for the recognition of pathogen nucleic acid motifs. All TLRs, with the exception
  of TLR3, recruit MyD88, while TLR1, TLR2, TLR4 and TLR6 recruit the additional adaptors
  CD14 and TIRAP, the latter of which links the TIR domain with MyD88. In the MyD88-dependent
  pathway, MyD88 recruits the IRAK family of proteins which leads to I-κB phosphorylation,
  resulting in the release and nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which influences the
  expression of numerous inflammatory genes. TLR3 ligands initiate the TRIF-dependent
  pathway, whereas TLR4 can signal via either MyD88-dependent or TRIF-dependent pathways
  requiring the additional linker adaptor TRAM, which links the TIR domain of TLR4
  with TRIF. In the TRIF-dependent pathway, TRIF interacts with TRAF3 to activate
  IRF3 and IRF7 and initiate type I interferon production. Alternatively, TRIF can
  also bind to RIP1 and TRAF6 and activate NF-κB and MAPK for late-phase (i.e. 24
  h) induction of inflammatory gene expression.
