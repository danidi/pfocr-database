caption: Putative involvement of the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE)
  during infection. The damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), high-mobility
  group box 1 (HMGB1) and S100A12, are released during infection ([,], and unpublished
  data) and bind to and activate RAGE. It has to be determined whether other S100
  proteins and other DAMPs are RAGE ligands (indicated as purple shapes) released
  during infection. It would be interesting to investigate whether RAGE can directly
  bind to, become activated and mount a first immune reaction after ligation with
  specific PAMPs as well. Engagement of RAGE by its ligands results in receptor-dependent
  signaling and activation of NF-κB leading to a pro-inflammatory response; the signaling
  pathway is largely unknown. In addition, RAGE interacts as an endothelial (and epithelial)
  adhesion receptor with the leukocyte integrin, CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) (lower section)
  []. Furthermore, lateral (in cis) RAGE-Mac-1 interaction on the leukocyte surface
  is mediated by HMGB1 and activates Mac-1-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1
  dependent adhesion and migration and augments leukocyte recruitment [] (indicated
  by the blue line and blue "+"). Moreover, a recent report shows that endothelially
  expressed RAGE acts in concert with ICAM-1 in mediating β2 integrin-dependent leukocyte
  adhesion during acute trauma-induced inflammation [] (indicated by the green line
  and green "+").
