caption: A) ITS computation. We applied ITS to compute the similarity between GO-BPs,
  SNPs, and genes through a cascade process as described in Methods –. This began
  construction of the biomolecular network layer. B) Integration of multiscale biomolecular
  associations using GWAS diseases, SNPs, and eGenes as nodes. The associations (edges)
  between nodes were obtained by extracting GWAS disease-to-SNP, and SNP-to-eGene
  (SNPeG) relationships from the database resources described (). The biomolecular
  network was then filtered to remove SNP-SNP pairs not meeting the introduced criteria
  (Edge Legend, ). ITSSNP-SNP is computed as in  considering all the eGenes extracted
  from eQTL data and the network was further refined to include only significantly
  similar eGene-eGene pairs, i.e. ITSSNP-SNP and ITSeGENE-eGENE () False Discovery
  Rate (FDR) <0.05. Drug-eGene and Drug-indication associations extracted from Drugbank
  (drug information layer) are included to obtain the final drug-repurposing network.
  C) Network validation. The drug repurposing network is validated by querying if
  the network predicted a significantly high number of gold standard treatments for
  GWAS diseases. Two conditions of validation are proposed, one stringent and one
  more relaxed (**). D) Drug repurposing patterns. We extracted GWAS disease pairs
  and the related convergent mechanisms where at least a gold standard treatment was
  predicted for one of the two GWAS diseases. The approach predicts new candidate
  therapies by repositioning drugs across these GWAS disease pairs.
