caption: Schematic diagram of energy‐generating metabolic pathways and their regulators
  in Tregs. Upon TCR engagement and CD28 co‐stimulation, glucose enters the Tregs
  via the Glut‐1 transporter and is converted via glycolysis into pyruvate in the
  cytoplasm. Pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is converted into acetyl‐CoA, which
  drives the TCA cycle and thus energy production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).
  OXPHOS is an efficient but slow route of cellular ATP production, and also generates
  ROS as by‐products. Under anaerobic conditions, cytosolic pyruvate is converted
  into lactate, generating less ATP. Depending on a cell's requirements, glucose entering
  the cell can also drive nucleotide and NADPH synthesis via the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP). Serine either enters the cell from the extracellular space or is
  synthesized from 3‐phosphoglycerate (3PG) generated from cytosolic glucose. This
  serine then either enters one‐carbon metabolism (1CM) to produce one‐carbon (1C)
  building blocks for anabolism, or generates the ROS scavenger glutathione (GSH).
  Lipids enter T cells via the CD36 transporter and then move to the mitochondria
  where the β‐oxidation (βox) of fatty acids (FA) is initiated. FA oxidation (FAO)
  generates acetyl‐CoA, which enters the TCA cycle to drive OXPHOS and provide energy.
  The TCA cycle metabolite citrate can be shuttled out of the mitochondria and converted
  back into cytosolic oxaloacetate (OAA) and acetyl‐CoA. The latter can be used for
  protein acetylation, cholesterol synthesis via the mevalonate pathway, and FA synthesis.
  Lastly, glutamine enters T cells, enters the mitochondria, and is converted into
  glutamate and α‐ketoglutarate (α‐KG). This α‐KG enters the TCA cycle to drive OXPHOS.
