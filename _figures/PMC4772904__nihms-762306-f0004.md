caption: Dual regulation of EP4 receptor transcription by NSAIDs. The promoter region
  of EP4 receptor contains both EGR-1 and Sp-1 binding sites. EGR-1 sites are involved
  in the increased expression of EP4, while Sp-1 sites are important for sulindac
  sulfide suppression of EP4 expression. NSAIDs such as sulidac sulfide first increases
  the expression of EP4 receptor by activating EGR-1 transcription which then bind
  to EGR-1 binding site on EP4 receptor promoter and thus cause EP4 upregulation (a).
  However, prolonged incubation with sulindac sulfide then suppresses EP4 expression
  through the activation of MEK1/2-ERR1/2 pathway which results in phosphorylation
  of threonine resides in Sp-1. Phosphorylation of Sp-1 decreases in Sp-1 binding
  to its binding site on EP4 receptor promoter. Furthermore, the phosphorylated Sp-1
  can effectively block the binding of EGR-1 to its binding site on the EP4 receptor
  promoter, and hence suppression of transcription activation of EP4 receptor (b)
