caption: Contractions initially lead to activation of NADPH oxidase (probably Nox2)
  within muscle. This occurs through rapid translocation of the regulatory sub‐units
  of NADPH oxidase to a muscle membrane and assembly of the catalytic enzyme. It is
  currently unknown how contractile activity leads to activation of this enzyme. The
  NADPH oxidase generates superoxide that is rapidly converted to H2O2. Some evidence
  suggests that the major NADPH oxidases predominantly generate superoxide on the
  outside of the muscle fibre with some H2O2 generated rapidly diffusing into the
  fibre although this is not firmly established. The process by which the increased
  H2O2 leads to activation of transcriptional responses is the subject of debate,
  but the conventional view is that local concentrations of H2O2 are sufficiently
  high for it to diffuse through the cytoplasm and interact with redox‐sensitive components
  of pathways activating various transcription factors (shown as a dashed line in
  the scheme). Note that the cytoplasm contains various enzymes that can degrade H2O2
  and compounds (e.g. glutathione) with which it can react. The alternative pathway
  involves the reaction of low levels of H2O2 with a highly reactive protein (e.g.
  Prx or Trx) that is closely associated with the NADPH oxidase with subsequent formation
  of disulphides and disulphide exchange with partner proteins thus transferring oxidising
  equivalents from H2O2 to proteins with which it would not react at low concentrations.
  Subsequent activation of the TF occurring through disulphide exchange with a key
  signalling protein. This pathway has not yet been shown to occur in skeletal muscle.
  Ageing appears to influence the overall scheme leading to an inability of contractile
  activity to further activate these transcription factors, but it is currently unknown
  how this occurs. GPx, glutathione peroxidase; CAT, catalase; Prx, peroxiredoxin;
  IKK, I kappa B kinase; TF, transcription factor.
