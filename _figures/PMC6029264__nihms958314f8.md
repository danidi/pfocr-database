caption: Alternative models describing the organization of the mitochondrial sulfide
  oxidation pathway. (A) In this model, GSH is the sulfur acceptor from SQR and the
  product, GSSH, is utilized by either PDO or by rhodanese generating sulfite and
  thiosulfate, respectively. (B) In this model, sulfite is the sulfur acceptor from
  SQR and the product, thiosulfate, is utilized by rhodanese to generate GSSH, which
  is subsequently oxidized by PDO to sulfite. Sulfite is eventually oxidized to sulfate
  by sulfite oxidase. Q represents coenzyme Q.
