caption: Assignment of Enzymes to Pathways and Average Maximum Enzyme Activities across
  All the Accessions.Rubisco and NADP-GAPDH are specific for the Calvin-Benson cycle,
  AGP for starch synthesis, cFBP and SPS for sucrose synthesis, PFK, PFP, NADH-GAPDH,
  PK, and PEPC for glycolysis, G6PDH for the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP), and
  INV, SuSy, FK, and GK for sucrose breakdown and the use of hexose sugars. TPI, Ald,
  and PGK are involved in the Calvin-Benson cycle and glycolysis and TK in the Calvin-Benson
  cycle and the OPP pathway. TPI, Ald, PGK, and TK are assigned to the Calvin-Benson
  cycle because the major isoforms of these enzymes are located in the chloroplast
  stroma () and because fluxes are 10- to 100-fold higher in photosynthesis than in
  glycolysis (; ). UGP is involved in the synthesis and breakdown of sucrose, and
  PGI and PGM are involved in the synthesis and breakdown of sucrose and starch. The
  assays distinguished plastidic PGI (pPGI) and cytosolic (cPGI) (). UGP was assigned
  to sucrose synthesis. Several TCA cycle enzymes have additional functions. CS and
  NAD- and NADP-ICDH are required to generate 2-oxoglutarate, which is the C-acceptor
  during nitrate and ammonium assimilation. NADH-MDH is involved in the synthesis
  of malate and, together with NADP-MDH, in metabolite cycles that allow redox equivalents
  to be exchanged between the NADP system in the plastid and the NAD systems in the
  cytosol and the mitochondrion (). The maximum catalytic activities of each enzyme,
  averaged across all accessions, are shown by color coding (see figure for scale).
  All abbreviations are defined in Supplemental Data Set 1C online. The subscript
  “in” for Rubisco and NADP-MDH indicates “initial activity.”
