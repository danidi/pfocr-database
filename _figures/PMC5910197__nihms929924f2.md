caption: A) The RNAi pathway has emerged as the major antiviral response in mosquitoes;
  although, most of the mechanistic details of the pathway are derived from work in
  D. melanogaster or other model organisms. Recognition of viral dsRNA triggers Dicer-2
  to process dsRNA into viral siRNAs which are then loaded into the RISC complex to
  target cognate viral RNAs for sequence specific degradation. B) Virus-derived piRNAs
  exhibit hallmarks of a ping-pong-mediated mechanism for biogenesis, but these products
  have not yet been ascribed any specific role in antiviral immunity. C) There is
  some evidence to suggest that the evolutionarily conserved Imd, Toll and Jak-STAT
  pathways contribute to the antiviral response in mosquitoes, possibly in a virus
  or tissue specific role. A connection between the siRNA and Jak-STAT pathways mediated
  by Vago, a secreted protein, has been postulated. D) The mosquito has recently been
  postulated to have adaptive antiviral responses mediated by reverse transcribed
  viral DNA (vDNA), which has been proposed to enter the piRNA pathway. E) In flies,
  a mechanism for the production of a non-canonical class of viral siRNAs released
  from exosome-like vesicles in circulating hemocytes has been described. As yet,
  it remains unclear if similar mechanisms exist in mosquito vectors.
