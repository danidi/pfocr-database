caption: Pathways involved in alcohol metabolism. In the major metabolic pathway (A)
  ethanol is oxidized into acetaldehyde. This oxidative process is facilitated by
  alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which is present in high concentration in the cytosol
  of hepatocytes. In this second step, acetaldehyde enters the mitochondria where
  it is oxidized into acetate and water. This process is facilitated by mitochondrial
  aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). For both steps, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NAD+) is essential to provide the necessary energy for the conversion, which becomes
  available when NAD+ is converted into NADH + H+. A second major pathway for alcohol
  breakdown, especially active in subjects who chronically drink alcohol, is the microsomal
  ethanol oxidizing system (MEOS, see (B)). The reaction is catalyzed by CYP2E1 and
  requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) instead of NAD+ to
  convert ethanol into acetaldehyde.
