caption: The calcineurin signaling pathway in C. albicans, C. neoformans, and A. fumigatus.
  Shown is a simplified schematic of how calcineurin regulates a myriad of responses
  in C. albicans, C. neoformans, and A. fumigatus. In C. albicans, the activation
  of the Cch1-Mid1 channel leads to the accumulation of intracellular Ca2+, which
  is bound by calmodulin (encoded by CAM1), leading to the activation of calcineurin.
  The molecular chaperone Hsp90 physically interacts with the catalytic subunit of
  calcineurin, Cna1, keeping it poised for activation. Once activated, calcineurin
  dephosphorylates the transcription factor Crz1 as well as other unknown effectors
  to regulate a myriad of cellular responses. In C. neoformans and A. fumigatus, homologues
  of this signaling pathway are depicted in identical colors. Components that have
  been identified only based on sequence homology are dimmed. Drugs and signaling
  molecules are depicted as stars, whereas proteins are depicted as circles. The cellular
  responses mediated by calcineurin are listed below the pathway. (Adapted from reference  with
