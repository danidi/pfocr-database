caption: 'Schematic diagram illustrating the effects induced by expression of R321X
  in HEK293 cells. ER mis‐localization of R321X elicits the ER stress response leading
  to: (i) activation of the PERK‐CHOP signalling pathway leading to apoptosis; (ii)
  ER abnormal Ca2+ handling leading to impaired cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+signalling
  which in turn might impact Ca2+‐mediated process such as gene regulation and contraction
  in cardiac cells.'

  stress with aberrant Ca2+ handling.
