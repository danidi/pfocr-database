caption: Molecular pathways regulated by C/EBPβ during E-induced proliferation of
  uterine epithelial cells. In mouse uterine epithelial cells, the expression of C/EBPβ
  is stimulated by E and opposed by simultaneous treatment with P. C/EBPβ controls
  the entry of E-stimulated epithelial cells into the S phase of the cell cycle by
  upregulating the expression of E2F3 and cyclin E. It also promotes the nuclear localization
  of cyclin E, which enables the formation of an active cyclin E-cdk2 complex critical
  for DNA replication. The lack of C/EBPβ allows the nuclear accumulation of p27,
  which contributes to the cell cycle arrest. In E-stimulated C/EBPβ-null uterine
  epithelial cells, stalled DNA replication activates a DNA damage response pathway
  involving ATM/ATR, Chk1/Chk2, Rad18, and p53. Activated p53 maintains the block
  in DNA replication by enhancing the synthesis of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 and
  also promotes the removal of damaged cells via caspase-dependent apoptosis.
