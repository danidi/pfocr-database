caption: Upstream regulator analysis of the differential proteome of the spleen from
  11-week Npc1−/− mice. Predicted upstream regulator analysis from 11-week Npc1−/−
  mice suggest that Tcl1a is a common regulator of various deferential proteins of
  the spleen. Assignment was based on the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Knowledge Base
  Library. GPNMB = Transmembrane glycoprotein NMB, GUSB = Beta-glucuronidase, ITGAM
  = Integrin alpha-M, MMP9 = Matrix metalloproteinase-9, MPEG1 = Macrophage-expressed
  gene 1 protein, Ngp = Nucleolar GTP-binding protein 1, SNX6 = Sorting nexin = 6,
  C1QC = Complement C1q subcomponent subunit C, CELA2A = Chymotrypsin-like elastase
  family member 2A, CTSD = Cathepsin D and CTSE = Cathepsin E.
