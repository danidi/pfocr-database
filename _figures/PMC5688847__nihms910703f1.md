caption: The primary route for triacylglycerol synthesis in most mammalian tissues
  involves the sequential transfer of acyl CoAs to a glycerol 3-phosphate backbone
  by the action of acyltransferases (GPAT, AGPAT, DGAT), and removal of the phosphate
  group by the action of lipin phosphatidic acid phosphatases (PAP). This pathway
  also provides building blocks for zwitterionic and anionic phospholipids. The acyltransferases
  are membrane-resident proteins, whereas lipins may reside in the cytosol and transiently
  interact with membranes containing the lipid substrate, PA. GPAT, glycerol 3-phosphate
  acyltransferase; AGPAT, acylglycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase; DGAT, acyl CoA:diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  TAG, triacylglycerol; CL, cardiolipin; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PC, phosphatidylcholine;
  PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine.
