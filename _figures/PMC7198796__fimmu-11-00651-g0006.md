caption: 'Protein–protein interaction networks of deiminated protein candidates identified
  in alligator plasma only (not identified in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Reconstruction
  of protein–protein interactions based on known and predicted interactions using
  the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analysis.
  (A) Colored nodes represent query proteins and first shell of interactors. (B) Protein
  families (PFAM) protein domains relating to the identified proteins and reported
  in STRING are highlighted as follows: sushi repeat, serpin, low-density lipoprotein
  (LDL)-receptor domain class A, von Willebrand factor (vWF) type A domain, membrane
  attack complex (MAC)/perforin domain, thrombospondin type 1 domain, leucine-rich
  repeat N-terminal domain, and trypsin (see color code included in the figure). (C)
  Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool (SMART) protein domains relating to the
  identified proteins and reported in STRING are highlighted as follows: domain abundant
  in complement control proteins, serine proteinase inhibitors, anaphylatoxin homologous
  domain, LDL-receptor domain class A, MAC/perforin, thrombospondin type 1 repeats,
  vWF type A domain, leucine-rich repeat C-terminal domain, trypsin-like serine protease,
  leucine-rich repeats (see color code included in the figure). (D) UniProt keywords
  relating to the identified proteins and reported in STRING are highlighted as follows:
  sushi, signal, disulfide bond, protease, leucine-rich repeat (see color code included
  in the figure). (E) Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways relating
  to the identified proteins and reported in STRING are highlighted as follows: red
  = adipocytokine signaling pathway.'
