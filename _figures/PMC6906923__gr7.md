caption: Mechanism for the control of maltose uptake. A, Schematic model of the inducer
  exclusion mechanism. PTS permeases facilitate PTS sugar uptake into the cell. EIIAglc
  is dephosphorylated, interacts with NBD and RD from different monomers of MalK,
  and is anchored to the inner leaflet of the membrane. The maltose transporter MalFGK2
  is thus trapped in an inactive conformation and maltodextrins uptake is inhibited.
  Consequently, maltodextrins (e.g. maltose, maltotriose) cannot further induce the
  maltose system by promoting the expression of malA and malB genes. B, Representation
  of the MalT positive regulation. In the absence of PTS sugars, the equilibrium of
  EIIAglc is shifted towards its phosphorylated state (EIIAglc-P) which cannot interact
  with MalK; therefore, transport can occur. Under these conditions, maltose induces
  the expression of malA and malB regions through its channeling into a metabolic
  pathway mediated by MalT-inducible enzymes. MalT is released from MalK and can be
  activated by (cognate) maltotriose imported or produced from the maltodextrin metabolism.
  MalT multimerization (upon its activation) allows its binding to the malA and malB
  promoters thereby inducing gene transcription. Of note, the divergent operon that
  belongs to the malA region and contains the malT gene is not shown, since it does
  not belong to the maltose regulon. Moreover, MalT-inducible operons located in other
  loci than malA and malB are also not shown for simplicity.
