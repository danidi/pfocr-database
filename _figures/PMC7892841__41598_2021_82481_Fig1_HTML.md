caption: The CD1b lipid presentation pathway. CD1b is produced via the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and transported to the outer membrane via the trans golgi network
  (TGN). CD1b is taken back into the cells via phagocytosis and endocytosis along
  with lipid on phagocytic targets brought in via phagocytic receptors or bound to
  lipid recognising mannose receptor. Phagocytic targets are broken down in the endosome
  and lipids loaded onto CD1b in the lysosome via Saposin-C before resorting with
  bound lipid antigen to the outer membrane where lipids can be presented as an antigen
  to T cells, resulting in activation and an immune response.
