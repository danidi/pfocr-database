caption: 'Effect of exercise on miRNAs. (A) A single bout of resistance exercise in
  men reduces miR-1 expression and does not affect the expression of miR-133a and
  -206. The miR-1 can promote protein synthesis through the IGF-1/Akt signal pathway.
  The change in the expression of miR-378 is positively correlated with the improved
  quality of skeletal muscle due to resistance exercise. Similarly, miR-378 inhibits
  PGC-1β-mediated mitochondrial metabolic effects by MED13 and CRAT; (B) a single
  bout of endurance exercise in mice reduces the expression of miR-23a and increases
  the expression of miR-1, -181 and -107. Endurance training increases the expression
  of miR-21 and decreases the expression of miR-696, -709 and -720 in mice. ↑ increased;
  ↓ decreased; → unchanged; ⊥ inhibited. IGF: insulin-like growth factor; Akt: protein
  kinase B; PGC-1: peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1; MED13:
  mediator complex subunit 13; CRAT: carnitine acetyltransferase; VEGF: vascular endothelial
  growth factor.'
