caption: Schematic representation of the molecular mechanisms of estrogen receptors.
  The classical pathway of estrogen signaling is ligand-dependent activation of estrogen
  receptors (ERs) and direct genomic effects on gene regulation by binding estrogen
  response elements (ERE). The ligand-dependent indirect genomic regulation of gene
  transcription includes interaction with other transcription factors (TF). In ligand-dependent
  signaling the ligand activates either membrane-associated classical ERs and/or the
  G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR30, to initiate signaling cascades via second messengers.
  This leads to rapid physiological response without involving gene regulation. The
  ligand-independent pathway can be stimulated by other signaling pathways, such as
  growth factor signaling, and elicis both genomic and non-genomic effects. The activated
  kinases phosphorylate estrogen receptors, initiating dimerization and regulation
  of gene transcription or activation of second messengers. (Adapted from ).
