caption: Time ordered sequential events control cellular decision of migration. Schematic
  representation of events regulating the initiation, maintenance, modulation and
  stopping of cell migration. (A) The migratory response depends on a certain threshold
  of gene activity, as indicated by the dashed line, and proceeds as long as no context
  information is provided via a stop signal or the sustained activation is depleted.
  (B) Summary scheme of the model for migration. A first pulse-like HGF stimulus is
  required to transform the cell into a sensitive state for migration. To initiate
  and sustain migration, a second input preferably through the EGF-R signaling pathway
  is required. This second input can be modulated by a number of genes. Context information
  is integrated through the PKA pathway, which can stop migration at any point in
  time.
