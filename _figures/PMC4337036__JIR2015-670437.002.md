caption: 'Schematic overview of intracellular antiviral immune signaling in teleosts.
  Fishes have conserved intercellular PRRs to sense virus or viral PAMPs. TLR3 and
  TLR22 sense dsRNA and transmit signals to the downstream adaptor IRIF; endosome
  localized TLR7/8 and TLR9 recognize ssRNA and CpG DNA, respectively, and then deliver
  signal to MyD88. Like mammalian RLRs, RIG-I and MDA5 recognize dsRNA or ssRNA in
  different length and activate mitochondrion IPS-1. With no CARD domain, LGP2 is
  thought to fail to interact with IPS-1 but can transmit signal to TBK1. Studies
  also indicate that LGP2 can mediate signals of RIG-I and MDA5. Fish MITA localizes
  in ER, but it is in close vicinity with IPS-1 in mitochondrial-ER contact regions.
  MITA participates in antiviral activation of IFN or ISGs downstream of RIG-I and
  MDA5 through MITA-TBK1-IRF3 pathway. TRIF and IPS-1 transfer signal through NF-κB
  and TBK1-IRF3/7-IFN-I pathway. MyD88 signal activates IRF3/7 and NF-κB, not TBK1.
  Upon phosphorylation, IRF3 and IRF7 transmit to nucleus and induce the production
  of IFN-I which induces antiviral immune response along with the activated ISGs.
  The activated NF-κB also transmits to nucleus initiating the activation of proinflammatory
  cytokines. Cytoplasmic HMGBs can promiscuously sense immunogenic nucleic acid and
  delivery to the discriminative sensors: TLRs and RLRs.'
