caption: Interaction of integrins and TGF-β signaling pathways. (a) Integrin binding
  to latent TGF-β complexes can lead to release of active TGF-β. (b) Signaling from
  integrins or TGF-β receptors can stimulate expression of receptors or effectors
  of the other signaling pathway. (c) Activation of integrins or TGF-β receptors can
  lead to activation or inhibition of the other signaling receptor. (d) Cooperative
  signaling from integrins and TGF-β receptor may be necessary to stimulate phenotypic
  outcomes, including EMT.
