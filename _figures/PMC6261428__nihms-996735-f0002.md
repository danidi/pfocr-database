caption: Rac cycles between GDP-bound (inactive) and GTP-bound (active) states. Different
  mechanisms can lead to hyperactivation of the Rac signaling pathway in cancer. Other
  potential mechanisms for Rac signaling deregulation include the reduced degradation
  via HACE1, altered Rac localization, mutations in Rho GDIs, and oxydation/reduction
  (not depicted here).
