caption: Models of TaNPR1‐induced resistance and the potential role of TaNPR1 proteins
  during wheat–rust interactions. (a) Model of resistance conferred by NPR1‐dependent
  detection in an R protein complex by a pair of head‐to‐head NB‐ARC genes. In wild‐type
  during the absence of rust, the two NB‐ARC genes fold together in an inactive formation.
  In the presence of a rust pathogen, one of the NB‐ARC loci produces an isoform protein
  containing NPR1 as a decoy. Two types of R protein complexes will be formed. If
  rust secretes an effector to attack TaNPR1, the decoy NPR1 could be mistakenly attacked,
  and then the NPR1‐decoy R protein complex will change to an active formation to
  induce a defence response. More NB‐NPR1 isoform will be produced to distract the
  NPR1‐attacking effector. In a mutant in which a mutation results in a change in
  the R protein complex to an active formation, the defence response is activated
  by the mutation. The mutant will be resistant to all rusts, except ones that have
  effectors to suppress other components of the defence signalling pathway. (b) During
  wheat–rust interactions, rust pathogens may apply invasion strategies that target
  or not target TaG3NPR1 (shown as Yes or No, respectively, on the figure). Without
  an ineffective detection system or compromised components for inducing defence signals,
  wheat will be susceptible to the pathogens. Resistant wheat in the ‘Yes’ group of
  rusts may use TaNPR1 as a decoy (e.g. Ta7ANPR1) in detection and have an alternative
  pathway to bypass TaNPR1 once the integrity of the NPR1 is compromised by the pathogens.
  Resistant wheat in the ‘No’ group of rusts may use either NPR1‐independent (e.g.
  Sr33) or NPR1‐dependent signalling through TaG3NPR1. Whether defence signalling
  could be transduced by both NPR1‐dependent or NPRI‐independent pathways is still
  a question to be resolved.
