caption: 'A model of Src homology 2B1 regulation of leptin signaling. The Src homology
  2B1 (SH2B1) homodimers bind to JAK2, IRS1, and/or IRS2. SH2B1-JAK2 interaction increases
  JAK2 kinase activity, thus globally enhancing leptin signaling. JAK2 phosphorylates
  STAT3 which subsequently homodimerizes, translocates into the nucleus, and activates
  its target genes. SH2B1-IRS1/2 interaction allows JAK2 to phosphorylate IRS proteins
  which subsequently activate the PI 3-kinase pathway. Both the STAT3 and the PI 3-kinase
  pathways are required for leptin to control energy balance and body weight. JAK2:
  Janus kinase 2; IRS1: Insulin receptor substrate-1; STAT3: Signal transducer and
  activator of transcription 3.'
