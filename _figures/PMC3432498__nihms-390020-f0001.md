caption: Activation of the IKK-NFκB pathway by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Exposure
  of cells to IR and chemotherapeutic agents (Chemo) induces DSBs and activates both
  PARP-1 and ATM. PARP-1 recruits nuclear IKKγ, PIASy and ATM into a complex to facilitate
  IKKγ sumoylation, phosphorylation, and mono-ubiquitilation. The post-translationally
  modified IKKγ and activated ATM are then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasma.
  In the cytoplasma, ATM functions as a scaffold protein to aid the assembling of
  the signalosomes consisting of UBC13, TRAF6 and cIAP1 or UBC13, XIAP and ELKS in
  a stimulus-dependent manner. In the signalosomes, TRAF6 undergoes auto-ubiquitilation
  to recruit TAK1 and TAB2 into the IKK complex composed of IKKα/β/γ. Alternatively,
  ELKS is ubiquitilated by XIAP, which in turn promotes the formation of TAB2-TAK1-IKKα/β/γ
  complexes. The formation of these signalosomes facilitate TAK1 autophosphorylation
  and IKKβ trans-phosphorylation by TAK1, leading to the activation of IKKβ. The activated
  IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα to induce its ubiquitilation and then degradation by the
  26S proteasome, which releases NFκB (p50/p65) for nuclear translocation to initiate
  the transcription of NFκB target genes, including those encoded various anti-apoptotic
  proteins. In addition, activated IKKβ can also phosphorylate Foxo3a and other unknown
  substrates to regulate the repair of DSBs and other cellular functions in an NFκB-independent
  manner. Both NFκB-dependent and -independent effects of IKKβ can contribute to tumor
  resistance to cancer therapy by induction of the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins
  and promotion of the repair of DNA damage, respectively

  description: Activation of the IKK-NFκB pathway by radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
    Exposure of cells to IR and chemotherapeutic agents (Chemo) induces DSBs and activates
    both PARP-1 and ATM. PARP-1 recruits nuclear IKKγ, PIASy and ATM into a complex
    to facilitate IKKγ sumoylation, phosphorylation, and mono-ubiquitilation. The
    post-translationally modified IKKγ and activated ATM are then exported from the
    nucleus to the cytoplasma. In the cytoplasma, ATM functions as a scaffold protein
    to aid the assembling of the signalosomes consisting of UBC13, TRAF6 and cIAP1
    or UBC13, XIAP and ELKS in a stimulus-dependent manner. In the signalosomes, TRAF6
    undergoes auto-ubiquitilation to recruit TAK1 and TAB2 into the IKK complex composed
    of IKKα/β/γ. Alternatively, ELKS is ubiquitilated by XIAP, which in turn promotes
    the formation of TAB2-TAK1-IKKα/β/γ complexes. The formation of these signalosomes
    facilitate TAK1 autophosphorylation and IKKβ trans-phosphorylation by TAK1, leading
    to the activation of IKKβ. The activated IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα to induce its
    ubiquitilation and then degradation by the 26S proteasome, which releases NFκB
    (p50/p65) for nuclear translocation to initiate the transcription of NFκB target
    genes, including those encoded various anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, activated
    IKKβ can also phosphorylate Foxo3a and other unknown substrates to regulate the
