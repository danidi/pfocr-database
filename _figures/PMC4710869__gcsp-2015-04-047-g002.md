caption: 'Proposed mechanism for the restoration of cell surface BMPR-II expression
  and signalling using exogenous BMP9 therapy. Left panel: Under normal conditions
  an individual possesses two wild-type alleles for BMPR2. Under these circumstances
  BMP9 signalling involves signalling via the ALK1:BMPR-II ligand receptor complex
  and activation of the Smad1/4 transcriptional complex. This promotes BMPR-II mRNA
  transcription and synthesis and trafficking of newly-synthesised BMPR-II to the
  cell surface where it complexes with ALK1, which has been recycled via the endosomal
  pathway. In the presence of BMP9, this feed forward pathway continues in an autoregulatory
  loop.Middle panel: in patients with a heterozygous mutation in BMPR2 leading to
  haploinsufficiency, cell surface BMPR-II is reduced and in its place, ActRII-A can
  form a complex with available ALK1 but this does not promote autoregulatory BMPR-II
  production in response to endogenous concentrations of BMP9, which remain unchanged.
  The reduced signalling through BMPR-II leads to reduced BMPR-II levels of the receptor
  at the cell surface. Right Panel: Administration of exogenous BMP9 to PAH patients
  with a heterozygous mutation in BMPR2, increases the circulating concentration of
  BMP9 which increases signalling via the Smad1/4 complex to induce BMPR-II protein
  expression. This shifts the equilibrium of the BMPR-II:ActR-IIA ratio in favour
  of BMPR-II associating with the available ALK1 and thus restores the autoregulatory
  production of BMPR-II in response to BMP9, thus restoring normal endothelial BMP9
  signalling.'
