caption: Crucial signaling pathways in CCA metabolism. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is
  an essential modulator of cell metabolism, growth and survival in CCA. Activating
  mutations of gene coding for the p110a and p85a subunits of PI3K and loss of the
  phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) have been reported in CCA. Moreover, it has
  been shown the overexpression of downstream mTOR effectors, such as p70S6K and p-4E-BP1.
  SIRT2/cMYC pathway is overexpressed in CCA cell lines and mediates the activation
  of the PDHA1 by inhibition the OXPHOS as well as the activation of SSP that acts
  against ROS production. During CCA progression increase lactate levels while pyruvate
  levels decrease. Moreover, cMyc induces an increase of LDH and PKM2 expression,
  which afterwards reduces pyruvate levels. Being the pyruvate an HDAC3 inhibitor,
  a reduction of its levels removes HDAC3 inhibition and promotes cMyc overexpression.
  Sirt1/FOXO1 pathway is involved in autophagy and mitochondrial functions. UCP2 promotes
  CCA development through AMPK pathway. FXR expression is downregulated in human tissues
  and CCA cell lines inducing tumor progression by modulating cellular metabolism.
  PPAR-α is overexpressed in CCA patients and modulates several genes involved in
  glucose and lipid metabolism as well as immune responses. All these alterations
  induce the activation of pathways that promote CCA progression through a reprogramming
  of cellular metabolism.
