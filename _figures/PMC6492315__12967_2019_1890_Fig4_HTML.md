caption: Schematic overview for the roles of miR-24, miR-23a and miR-145 in TGF-β
  signaling in AKI. The proteolytic activity of Furin is required for the maturation
  of TGF-β. After binding with mature TGF-β, TGFβR2 phosphorylates TGFβR1 and induces
  canonical SMAD2/3 signaling. Phosphorylated SMAD2/3 interacts with SMAD4, and this
  complex translocates into the nucleus and associates with transcription factors
  (FOXO3 and SP1) to regulate target gene expression. The pro-apoptotic factors, Bim
  and Bax, are induced by TGF-β-SMADs signaling to cooperatively trigger the release
  of Cyt C from mitochondria. Cyt C, Pro-Casp9 and Apaf1 form the apoptosome, which
  can initiate intrinsic apoptosis through the caspase 9-mediated cleavage of caspase
  3/7. FasL is transactivated by the canonical TGF-β pathway, binds to Fas receptor,
  and enhances extrinsic apoptosis by autolysis of Pro-Casp8. Activated caspase 8
  also converts caspase 3/7 into active enzymes and induces cell death. SMAD2/3 transactivates
  pro-fibrotic genes that are directly involved in extracellular matrix deposition.
  PAI1 is also activated via the TGF-β-SMADs pathway; activated PAI1 reduces the production
  of plasmin and protects fibrin from degradation, thereby promoting tissue fibrosis.
  The experimentally confirmed targets of miR-24, miR-23a and miR-145 are marked.
