caption: Role of STAT3 in lung cancer. In lung cancer cells, STAT3 can be activated
  by EGFR, JAK2, Src, IL6, or others. Negative regulators of STAT3 include SOCS, PIAS,
  Protein tyrosine phosphatases, and miRNAs. In the canonical pathway, activated STAT3
  is phosphorylated at Tyr705 and functions as a transcription factor, inducing downstream
  target genes that are important for cell proliferation, induction of angiogenesis,
  prevention of apoptosis, evasion of host immune surveillance, or cancer stem cell
  self-renewal. Potential non-canonical functions of STAT3 may also operate in lung
  cancer cells. See text for more details.
