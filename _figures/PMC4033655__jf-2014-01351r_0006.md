caption: Schematic representation of the mechanisms of action of shogaols and their
  cysteine-conjugated metabolites in regulating apoptosis by p53 induction, activation
  of PUMA via p53 translocation to the mitochrondrial surface, Bcl-2 down-regulation,
  cytochrome c release, XIAP inhibition, and finally caspases 9 and 3 activation and
  cleavage.
