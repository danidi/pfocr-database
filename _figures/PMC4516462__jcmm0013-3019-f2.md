caption: Transcriptional modifications of DNA repair by UPS in response to cellular
  stressing conditions. The regulatory roles of UPS exerted on DNA repair on the transcriptional
  level are exerted (A) directly through binding of the proteasome-associated protein
  Rpn4p on promoter of MAG1 and Rad23 genes, encoding repair proteins of BER and NER
  pathway, respectively, (B) on transcription-coupled DNA repair of bulky lesions
  via degradation of the largest subunit of RNA pol II and subsequent cleavage of
  the lesion-containing DNA strand, followed by resynthesis and resumption of transcription,
  (C) on protein-DNA adducts removal, via degradation of topoisomerases, making the
  underlying lesion recognizable and subjective to further procession by different
  DNA repair pathways according to the type of the lesion, (D) on modulation of chromatin
  compaction and accessibility of DNA repair proteins by Ub de-conjugation from histones,
  (E) on inducible by PARP, removal of damaged histones, (F) on availability of DNA
  repair proteins to different sites of DNA damage after dispersal of PML-NBs, (G)
  on assembly of BRCA1 after MDC1 ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.
