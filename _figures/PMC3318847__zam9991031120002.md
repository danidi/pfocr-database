caption: Heterologous taxadiene design, implementation, and optimization. Strain MG1655
  was engineered for plasmid stabilization (ΔrecA ΔendA) and to support the T7 promoter
  (DE3). Having been previously identified and sequenced, the heterologous geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate synthase (ggpps) and taxadiene synthase (txs) genes were synthesized,
  codon optimized, and truncated to remove suspected signaling regions before being
  introduced via plasmid. Both native bottleneck MEP genes and the heterologous genes
  were designed for a range of expression levels through modifications to promoter
  (black circle preceding operon) strength (trc, T5, and T7) and gene dosage. Upstream
  and downstream pathway balancing allowed optimized taxadiene titers.
