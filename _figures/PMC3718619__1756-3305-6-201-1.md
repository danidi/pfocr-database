caption: Schematic diagram of GDP-L-fucose synthesis. GDP-L-fucose synthesis occurs
  by two cytosolic pathways, namely the de novo and salvage pathways. In de novo synthesis
  (A), GMD with coenzyme NADP+ removes one H2O-equivalent from GDP-D-mannose to form
  GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose. Then, GMER catalyzes epimerizations at C3 and C5 followed
  by an NADPH-dependent reduction of C4 to yield GDP-L-fucose. In the salvage pathway
  (B), Fuk transfers a single phosphate from ATP to free cytosolic L-fucose, yielding
  L-fucose-1-phosphate and the byproduct ADP. Next, FPGT transfers GMP from GTP to
  L-fucose-1-phosphate, producing GDP-L-fucose and pyrophosphate. Evidence presented
  here strongly supports the exclusive use of the de novo synthetic pathway in S.
