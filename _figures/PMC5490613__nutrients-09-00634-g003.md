caption: 'The toxic AGE (TAGE) theory for the pathophysiology of NAFLD and ALD: The
  chronic ingestion of an excessive daily diet (SSB and commercial products, which
  contain HFCS/sucrose) increases the levels of the sugar metabolite, glyceraldehyde
  (GA), while the chronic consumption of an excessive number of alcoholic beverages
  increases the levels of the alcohol metabolite, acetaldehyde (AA) in the liver.
  GA or AA is known to react non-enzymatically with the ε- or α-amino groups of proteins
  to form reversible Schiff bases and then Amadori products. These early glycation
  products undergo further complex reactions such as rearrangement, dehydration, and
  condensation to become irreversibly cross-linked, heterogeneous fluorescent derivatives
  termed “AGEs” (GA-AGEs or AA-AGEs). The CML/CEL or NEL pathway for the reaction
  of Amadori products may be a physiologically relevant mechanism for averting the
  generation of GA-AGEs or AA-AGEs (the predominant components of TAGE), and, thus,
  prevent potential cellular toxicity arising from the generation of TAGE in vivo.
  Furthermore, the chronic ingestion of excessive dietary AGEs (mainly Glu-AGEs) further
  promotes the enhanced generation/accumulation of GA-AGEs and expression of RAGE.
  As a result, GA-AGEs accumulate in cells, cause cell damage, and leak into the blood,
  and, thus, GA-AGE levels in circulating fluids may be considered to increase. Extracellular
  GA-AGEs induce inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer malignancy via RAGE-NOX-ROS signaling.
  The GA-AGE-RAGE axis may lead to ROS generation by NOX. Oxidative hepatic injury
  may result from the direct attack of ROS on essential biomolecules, including lipids,
  proteins, and DNA, with the subsequent activation of cell death pathways and loss
  of biological functions and hepatocyte viability. ROS may indirectly activate redox
  sensitive transcription factors, including NF-κB and activator protein-1 (AP-1),
  which trigger the production of cytotoxic, pro-inflammatory, and fibrogenic mediators
  by HSCs, thereby promoting NAFLD disease progression. AA-AGEs may also bind to RAGE
  and generate ROS, which trigger signal transduction in hepatocytes/HSCs. However,
  the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the generation of ROS by AA-AGEs remain
  unclear. Alcoholic beverages (particularly mixed liquor) contain large amounts of
  sugars and Glu-AGEs may generate/accumulate TAGE (AA-AGEs and GA-AGEs). Taken together,
  our theory suggests that TAGE are novel therapeutic targets for preventing lifestyle-related
  diseases. Therefore, inhibiting the generation/accumulation of TAGE is a promising
  target for the novel prevention of and therapeutic interventions for NAFLD and ALD.
