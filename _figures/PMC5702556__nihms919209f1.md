caption: A) Schematic representation of antipsychotic (APS) action on G-protein (Gprot)
  and β-arrestin (βarr) signaling pathways and its effect on catalepsy and psychosis.   Activation;   inhibition/antagonist;   partial
  agonist. Haloperidol (HAL) and aripiprazole (ARI) are used as representative typical
  and atypical APS, respectively. HAL and ARI act on D2 dopamine (D2R) and 5-HT2A
  serotonin receptors. Unlike HAL, ARI is a partial agonist at the D2-Gprot pathway
  and at 5-HT1A receptors, which might explain its non-cataleptic properties. Moreover,
  antagonist activity at the D2-βarr pathway and at 5-HT2A receptors might be largely
  responsible for reducing psychosis.B) Schematic representation of the various integrated
  approaches used to decipher antipsychotic action including novel techniques in development.
