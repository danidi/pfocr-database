caption: A path from H2 and CO2 to nucleic acid bases (adapted from figs. 3, 4 and
  6 of []. (a) The lower portion of the panel shows the biosynthesis of carbon backbones
  in microbes that use the acetyl-CoA pathway and the incomplete (horseshoe) reverse
  citric acid cycle. Reductive steps of CO2 fixation are indicated as H2-dependent,
  though reduced ferredoxin or NAD(P)H are the reductants in metabolism. The first
  four 2-oxoacids to arise via the route shown, and, if reductively aminated, generate
  Ala, Asp, Glu and Gly (upper portion of the panel). Muchowska et al. [] showed that
  pyruvate, oxaloacetate, 2-oxoglutarate and glyoxylate are readily reduced to the
  corresponding amino acids by hydroxylamine under mild conditions in the presence
  of native iron. Asp is the starting point for biosynthesis of five other canonical
  amino acids and pyrrolysine, Glu is the starting point for synthesis of Gln, Arg
  and Pro. (b) Asp and Gly are central to pyrimidine and purine biosynthesis, respectively
  (modified from fig. 4 of []). The involvement of CO2 in purine and pyrimidine synthesis
  is noteworthy, as is the involvement of folate-bound C1 intermediates of the acetyl-CoA
  pathway in purine synthesis, which are replaced by the simpler intermediate formyl
  phosphate in methanogens. This suggests the possibility of a small prebiotic biochemical
  network linking CO2 reduction to nucleic acid base synthesis. (Online version in
