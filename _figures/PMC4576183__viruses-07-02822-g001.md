caption: Post-transcriptional control on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Upon
  transcription, the capped and polyadenylated full-length genomic RNA is used as
  a template for the host mRNA processing machinery in order to generate fully spliced
  and partially spliced transcripts (partially spliced transcripts have been omitted
  for simplicity). In the nucleus, fully spliced transcripts form a classical messenger
  ribonucleoprotein complex (mRNP) together with host proteins such as the exon junction
  complex (EJC) and the mRNA export factor NXF1. In the cytoplasm, fully spliced mRNAs
  recruit the host translational apparatus for protein synthesis and later they are
  degraded by the mRNA turnover machinery. In the presence of the viral protein Rev,
  the unspliced genomic RNA (and partially spliced mRNAs) reaches the cytoplasm through
  the CRM1-dependent pathway avoiding the host cell surveillance mechanisms. During
  this journey to the cytoplasm, the unspliced genomic RNA forms a unique mRNP that
  favors its association with the host translational machinery. In contrast to the
  fully spliced transcripts, the unspliced genomic RNA does not undergo turnover as
  it is incorporated into viral particles.
