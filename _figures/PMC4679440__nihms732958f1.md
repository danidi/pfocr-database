caption: CFPWV, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. CVR, cerebrovascular resistance.
  WMH, white matter hyperintensities. TIE, total indirect effect. Model numbers are
  denoted by path subscripts. Residual direct effects are labeled as path A in each
  model, and the indirect effects are labeled with relevant groupings of letters B-F
  as needed. Variables were entered as z-scores standardized by sex. The effect size
  ± bootstrapped SE and bias-corrected bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals are reported
  for all paths. Models adjusted for age, height, weight, heart rate, diabetes mellitus,
  prior cardiovascular disease, use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication,
  blood glucose, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, triglycerides,
  smoking, education level, and depressive symptoms.
