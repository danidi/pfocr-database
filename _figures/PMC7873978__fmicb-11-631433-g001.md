caption: 'Schematic diagram of lipoic acid metabolism pathways in E. coli and B. subtilis.
  Both E. coli and B. subtilis have two independent pathways for lipoic acid metabolism.
  (A) Lipoylation pathways of E. coli. LplA is able to transfer both free lipoic acid
  as well as free octanoic acid to the apo-proteins in the salvage pathway. LipB and
  LipA are involved in the lipoic acid synthesis pathway of E. coli. LD: lipoly domain
  of lipoate-dependent protein. (B) Lipoylation pathways of B. subtilis. In the salvage
  pathway, LplJ can only modify GcvH and OGDH, and that LipL is necessary to lipoylate
  the E2 subunits of PDH and BCOADH (represented by E2). In the synthesis pathway,
  first, LipM specifically transfers octanoate from ACP to GcvH. Then, LipA catalyzes
  sulfur insertion to form lipoyl-GcvH and LipL transfers the lipoyl group from GcvH
  to other lipoate-requiring subunits. The lipoyl-OGDH could also serve as a lipoate
  donor for the lipoylation of PDH and BCOADH.'
