caption: An alternative menaquinone biosynthetic pathway (the futalosine pathway).
  In A. cellulolyticus and S. coelicolor, dehypoxanthinyl futalosine (DHFL) was perhaps
  formed from aminodeoxyfutalosine (AFL) via futalosine (FL). In contrast, AFL was
  directly converted into DHFL by MqnB in H. pylori.
