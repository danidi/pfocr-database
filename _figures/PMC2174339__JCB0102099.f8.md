caption: Model depicting GADD34's role in inhibiting signaling through the integrated
  stress response pathway. GADD34 is induced transcriptionally by the eIF2α kinases
  PERK and GCN2. It associates with PP1c to reduce levels of eIF2α phosphorylation
  and feed-back negatively on the pathway. ATF4 is a transcription factor that is
  activated translationally by eIF2α phosphorylation and plays a role in the transcriptional
  activation of CHOP in the integrated stress response (). We do not know if it plays
  a similar role in GADD34 activation and for this reason it is displayed by a shadowed
  font.
