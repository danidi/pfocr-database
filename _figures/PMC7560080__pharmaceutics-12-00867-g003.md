caption: ROS and low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid (LMWHA) involvement in both
  priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. ROS are rapidly produced in the
  skin following contact sensitizer treatment. ROS are responsible for triggering
  several intracellular cascades as well as promoting HA degradation. High-molecular-weight
  HA (HMWHA) is degraded into LMWHA, which is recognized by TLR2 and TLR4. Both TLR2-
  and TLR4- mediated signaling, as well as ROS, activate the NF-κB pathway, leading
  to IL1β, IL18 and NLRP3 transcription. Some allergens also induce mtROS production
  which leads to K+ efflux and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. LMWHA can activate NLRP3
  inflammasome through CD44 (expressed on the surface of macrophages). CD44-LMWHA
  complex is further internalized and degraded by endosomes/lysosomes and the released
  oligosaccharides induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. CD44, cluster of differentiation
  44. Created with BioRender.com.
