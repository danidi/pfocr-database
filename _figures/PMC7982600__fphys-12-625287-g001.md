caption: 'Schematic representation of known signaling pathways involved in FGF21 expression
  from skeletal muscle. Under physiological conditions, the expression of FGF21 from
  skeletal muscle is responsive to insulin stimulation via PI3K-Akt1 signaling pathway
  (yellow). FGF21 expression from skeletal muscle in various mitochondrial deficiency
  animal models is mainly driven by the activation of integrative stress response
  (green). Specifically, mitochondrial deficiency causes ER stresses, which leads
  to the phosphorylation of eIF2a via activation of PERK arm. Phosphorylation of elf2a
  increases ATF4, which subsequently augments transcription of the FGF21 gene. AMPK-Akt1
  signaling pathway drives the FGF21 expression from skeletal muscle when mitochondrial
  fat oxidation is inhibited (orange). The p38 MAPK/AFT2/MyoD signaling pathway is
  involved in FGF21 expression during myogenesis (blue). Increased FGF21 expression
  from 4E-BP1 activated skeletal muscle was discovered and the 4E-BP is one of the
  key downstream substrates of the mTORC1 complex (red). (Dotted line represents unknown
  mechanisms) ER: Endoplasmic reticulum; PI3K: Phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt: Protein
  kinase B; eIF: eukaryotic translation initiation factor; PERK: Protein kinase R
  (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase; ATF: Activating transcription factor; AMPK:
  Adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein
  kinases; MyoD: Myoblast determination protein 1; 4E-BP: eukaryotic translation initiation
  factor 4E-binding protein; mTORC: mammalian target of rapamycin; TSC: Tuberous sclerosis
