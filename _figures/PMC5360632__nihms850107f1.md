caption: Vitamin D-related genes are represented by the gray boxes. GC, group specific
  component (vitamin D binding protein). Vitamin D is bound to vitamin D binding protein
  (encoded by the GC gene) in the blood and transported to the liver, where it is
  converted to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). This is then transported to the kidney
  via vitamin D binding protein, where it is converted into the active metabolite
  1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]2D) by 1-alpha hydroxylase (encoded by the CYP27B1
  gene), which affects several immune modulatory pathways that can affect disease
  risk. When 1,25[OH]2D is sufficiently available, some of it is converted to the
  inactive 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (24,25[OH]2D) by 1-alpha, 25 dihydroxyvitamin
  D 24-hydroxylase (encoded by the CYP24A1 gene) in the kidney.
