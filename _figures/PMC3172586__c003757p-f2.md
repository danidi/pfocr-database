caption: . A metabolic map of central metabolism in M. tuberculosis showing the reactions
  surrounding the TCA cycle. The standard TCA cycle is shown in blue with the variant
  (SSA) pathway in yellow. Anaplerotic/gluconeogenic reactions are shown in turquoise
  with the glyoxylate shunt in red. Only enzymes mentioned in the text are indicated,
  including KOR (α-ketoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase), KGD (α-ketoglutarate
  decarboxylase), GabD1/D2 (succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase), ICL (isocitrate
  lyase) and MEZ (malic enzyme (malate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating)), PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase), PK (pyruvate kinase) and PYC (pyruvate carboxylase).
