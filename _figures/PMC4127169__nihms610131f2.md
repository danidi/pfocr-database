caption: Wnts organize presynaptic (CNS and NMJ) and postsynaptic (NMJ) specializations
  through multiple signaling pathways. Released from the presynaptic terminal, Wnt11r,
  Wnt3, and Wingless can all induce postsynaptic differentiation at the NMJ. Wnt11r
  may also be released from nearby somite cells (not depicted here). Wnt11r signals
  through the unplugged/MuSK receptor to induce clustering of acetylcholine receptors.
  Wnt3 signals through an as yet unidentified receptor to activate Rac1, which induces
  clustering of acetylcholine receptors. Wingless (Wg) is carried across the synaptic
  cleft by Evi, in the postsynaptic membrane they bind to DFrizzled-2 and through
  association with dGRIP is transported to the nucleus. Wingless also organizes the
  presynaptic compartment through the beginning of the canonical pathway (Frizzled
  and LRP to Dishevelled to GSK3β). Released from the postsynaptic target cell, Wnt3a,
  Wnt7a, and Wnt7b are presynaptic organizers in the CNS that signal through the canonical
  Wnt signaling pathway (Frizzled and LRP to Dishevelled to GSK3β to β-catenin). Wnt5a
  and lin-44, on the other hand, inhibit presynaptic development through noncanonical
  signaling pathways that remain unknown.
