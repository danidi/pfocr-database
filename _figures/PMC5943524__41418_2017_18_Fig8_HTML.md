caption: High-grade DNA damage (red) causes a hyperactivation of the p53/ACER2 pathway,
  resulting in the dominance of the pro-death signal of SPH over the pro-proliferative
  and pro-survival of S1P and thereby PCD. Low-grade DNA damage (blue) triggers a
  moderate activation of the p53/ACER2 pathway, resulting in a balance of the pro-death
  signal of SPH and pro-senescence signal of ceramides with the pro-proliferative
  and pro-survival signals of S1P and thereby cell cycle arrest and senescence
