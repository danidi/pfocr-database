caption: 'The overexpression of tRNAs regulated the progression of cancer acting on
  different ways: Ras, c-myc and TERT promoted the transcription of tRNA genes by
  binding to pol III. a The overexpression of tRNA activated the RSK1/MSK2 signaling
  pathway, thus influencing cell proliferation and cell apoptosis. b Overexpressed
  tRNA promoted the ability of invasion and metastasis by enhancing stability and
  translation of transcripts enriched for their cognate codons. c The overexpression
  of tRNA regulated the progression of cancer by increasing the secretion of integrin
  and type II collagen'
