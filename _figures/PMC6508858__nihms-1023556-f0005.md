caption: GPCR trafficking and compartmentalized signaling. The formation of GPCR-mediated
  signaling platforms provides a mechanism to sculpt specific cellular responses.
  (1) GPCRs at the plasma membrane form multiprotein complexes that participate in
  the regulation of a specific signaling pathway (pathway A). For example, AKAP interactions
  with GPCRs can scaffold the formation of complexes that regulate cAMP signaling
  by bringing in close proximity enzymes that degrade cAMP (PDEs) and kinases that
  are activated by this second messenger (PKA). (2) With prolonged agonist stimulation,
  GPCRs are phosphorylated by GRKs. The phosphorylated receptor has higher affinity
  for the cytosolic protein ARRB. (3) ARRBs are adaptors that promote clathrin-and
  dynamin-mediated endocytosis of GPCRs. (4) ARRBs scaffold the formation of multi-protein
  complexes that result in a second wave of intracellular signaling (pathway B). Genetically
  encoded biosensors have shown differences in the spatial and temporal profile of
  GPCR signaling from different subcellular locations (insets). AKAP, A-kinase anchor
  protein; GRK, G-protein receptor kinase; PDE, phosphodiesterase; PKA, protein kinase
  A.
