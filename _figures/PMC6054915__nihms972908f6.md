caption: MOG or MBP-specific T cell clones are initially activated with production
  of IL-2 by MOG or MBP-presentation by APCs. Effector cell produced IL-2 provides
  a strong secondary signal during the expansion of MOG- or MBP-specific T effectors
  in draining lymph nodes and inflamed CNS, resulting pathogenic demyelination. With
  an infusion of MBP-specific single clonal Tregs, these engineered Tregs are activated
  upon the presentation of MBP p85-99 peptide and IL-2 secreted from T effectors with
  sharing of APCs or separately in a proximal distance. Activated Tregs subsequently
  secret soluble suppressive factor(s) to enable the contactless bystander suppression
  in the local inflamed milieu, suppressing further proliferation of localized pathogenic
  T effectors by shutdown of phosphorylation of Stat5, a critical downstream signaling
  pathway of IL-2.
