caption: A Model of Paradoxical CRAF Activation by BRAF(A) In the presence of oncogenic
  RAS, BRAF is cytosolic, where it maintains itself in an inactive conformation in
  a manner that depends on its own kinase activity. CRAF is recruited to the plasma
  membrane by RAS and activates the pathway.(B) When BRAF is inhibited by genetic
  or chemical means, it is no longer autoinhibited and is recruited to the plasma
  membrane by RAS, where it binds to CRAF. Although BRAF does not itself signal, it
  can act as a scaffold to enhance CRAF activity and consequently enhance signaling
  through the pathway.(C) Pan-RAF inhibitors hyperactivate CRAF because they inhibit
  BRAF, but they simultaneously inhibit CRAF, leading to paradoxical activation of
  CRAF without pathway activation.(D) T421NCRAF (T421N) escapes the paradoxical activation
  by the pan-RAF inhibitors, because it no longer allows them to bind, so is freely
  activated due to BRAF inhibition.
