caption: Schematic diagram of the FOXM1/β-Catenin complex in human osteosarcoma cells.
  Elevated DNA methylation in the upstream region of miR-370 results in its down-regulation,
  which leads to up-regulation of FOXM1 gene. FOXM1 directly binds β-Catenin to form
  a complex and helps β-Catenin to translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,
  where the FOXM1-β-Catenin complex interacts with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer
  factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors, up-regulating the expression of downstream
  target genes of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway such as c-Myc and Cyclin D1.
