caption: 'The NF-κB signaling pathway was regulated via ERK1/2 when THP-1-derived
  macrophages were treated with the novel NP-siRNA liposomes at 12.5 μg/mL for 24
  hours.Notes: The proteomic response was determined by SILAC, and pathways were analyzed
  using IPA. Red indicates an upregulation; green indicates a downregulation. The
  intensity of green and red colors indicates the degree of down- or upregulation.
  Solid arrow indicates direct interaction.Abbreviations: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase; IPA, ingenuity pathway analysis; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; NP, nanoparticle;
  SILAC, stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture; siRNA, small interfering
  RNA.'
