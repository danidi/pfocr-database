caption: 'Model of the PI3K–Akt–TSC–TOR pathway and feedback regulation of insulin/IGF-I
  signaling. (A) Under normal conditions, insulin/IGF-I engagement of the insulin
  or IGF-I receptor (IR) leads to Tyr phosphorylation of IRS proteins and subsequent
  recruitment and activation of PI3K. PI3K activity leads to activation of Akt, which
  phosphorylates and inhibits many downstream substrates, including BAD, FOXO transcription
  factors, GSK3, and tuberin (TSC2). Through these and other targets, Akt activity
  stimulates glucose uptake and cell growth and proliferation, and inhibits apoptosis.
  Akt-directed phosphorylation of tuberin relieves its inhibition of TOR, via activation
  of the small G protein Rheb (not depicted). TOR activation by this pathway requires
  the presence of nutrients and results in activation of S6K and inhibition of 4E-BP1.
  S6K phosphorylates the ribosomal S6 protein (not depicted) and can feedback and
  inhibit IRS proteins (see S6K1: closing the loop section for details). Inhibition
  of 4E-BP1 relieves its inhibition of the translation initiation factor eIF4E. (B)
  Under atypical conditions of constitutive TOR activation, arising from chronic insulin/IGF-I
  exposure, excess nutrients (e.g., amino acids [AAs] and free fatty acids [FFAs]),
  inflammatory cytokines, or genetic loss of specific tumor suppressor genes, such
  as TSC2 (encoding tuberin), aberrantly high S6K activity shuts down insulin/IGF-I
  signaling. Therefore, although this unregulated TOR activity leads to constitutive
  eIF4E activation, it leads to insulin/IGF-I resistance through down-regulation of
  IRS protein function. This feedback inhibition prevents Akt-mediated glucose uptake
  and regulation of its downstream substrates. Dashed versus solid lines represent
  hypothetical signal strength.'
