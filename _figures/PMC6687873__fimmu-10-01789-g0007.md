caption: The IRE1α-XBP1 pathway of the UPR in CF. Activation of the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway
  in macrophages leads to splicing of XBP1 (XBP1s) which activates transcription of
  genes involved in inflammation, protein folding, autophagy and metabolism. In CF
  macrophages malfunctioning and accumulation of the misfolded CFTR induces a perpetual
  ER stress, leading to heightened levels in metabolic functions and chronic low-grade
  inflammation. TLR4 activation, through LPS, leads to a hyper-inflammatory/metabolic
  response through XBP1s exacerbating the inflammatory response.
