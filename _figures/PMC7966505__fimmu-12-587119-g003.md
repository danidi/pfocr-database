caption: Graphical demonstration of identified tryptophan pathway gene differences
  relative to generated metabolites in axSpA and HC. Genes encoding enzymes in the
  tryptophan synthesis/metabolism pathway were identified using metagenomics () and
  are represented visually here. Numerous pathways towards tryptophan synthesis were
  identified as significantly higher in HC compared to axSpA and shown with black
  arrows and listed KO names. Indolepyruvate decarboxylase, which is responsible for
  tryptophan metabolism towards IAA and I3Ald, was found to be significantly increased
  in genetic abundance in axSpA compared to HC. This gene and the resulting metabolites
  that are increased in axSpA are identified in red.
