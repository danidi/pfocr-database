caption: (a) Ingenuity pathway profiling and mapping of genes/proteins from ATM−/ATM+
  cells with or without ionizing radiation treatment. The analysis is performed using
  Ingenuity IPA. Top, top-ranked pathway profiles (well above the threshold p-value),
  in which the ratio of genes/proteins detected in the experiment over the total number
  of proteins annotated in the pathway, is given as gray squares. Purine metabolism
  (encircled on the left) is shown as the third top pathway in the study. Bottom,
  pathway map of cell cycle G2/M DNA damage check point regulation. BRCA1 and p53
  are upregulated at mRNA level 30 min after irradiation in ATCL8 cells (labeled with
  a dark triangle shape). Chk1, identified from 2D gel/MS, was increased at 3 h after
  irradiation in ATCL8 cells (encircled with a dashed line). (b) Gene networks linking
  RRM2 with DNA damage repair pathway proteins. Functional networks showing RRM2 connected
  to other major DNA repair and cell cycle proteins, such as p53, BRCA1, and HDAC1.
  Networks are generated using the Ingenuity IPA tool, and are merged from three subnetworks,
  one containing RRM2 and HDAC1, one with p53, and the third with BRCA1. The protein
  or gene nodes labeled with a dark triangle shape are those differentially expressed
  in the study. The lines (edges) connecting nodes indicate associations between proteins
  or genes, which encompass interaction, binding, activation, inhibition, etc. Solid
  lines (edges) are for direct and dashed ones for indirect associations. The figure
  is adapted from Hu et al. ().
