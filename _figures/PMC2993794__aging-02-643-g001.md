caption: The process of chronological aging ultimately relies on a cell's decision
  to stall or promote its growth in a given scenario. If growth is inhibited, for
  instance due to low nutrient availability (caloric restriction), the cell enters
  a state of low metabolic activity (quiescence), thus arresting the aging process
  (antiaging). If nutrients are available the cell activates growth progression, elevates
  metabolic rates, promotes its reproduction and progressively ages (non-quiescence
  or senescence), eventually culminating in its demise (proaging).Consequently, glucose
  availability has a major impact on longevity, specifically via the Tor-Sch9p and
  Ras2-PKA pathways, which require the serine-threonine kinase Rim15p and the transcription
  factors Gis1p, Msn2p and Msn4p to regulate expression of stress response genes.
  While longevity is promoted upon low glucose availability (↓glucose → ↓Tor/Sch9p/Ras2
  → ↑stress response), it is shortened when glucose availability is high (↑glucose
  → ↑Tor/Sch9p/Ras2 → ↓stress response). Stress response is also regulated via other
  factors like the transcription factor Yap1p or the histone deacetylase Sir2.The
  Tor1p kinase is also involved in the regulation of autophagy, a self-recycling pathway
  under nutrient starvation. Upregulation of autophagy may occur via inhibition of
  the Tor1p kinase (for instance with rapamycin) or elevation of intracellular spermidine
  levels (by external supplementation or internal regulation mechanisms still to be
  discerned). Spermidine, which induces autophagy via inhibition of histone acetyl
  transferases (HATs) and resulting histone hypoacetylation, could also regulate longevity
  via autophagy-independent alternative pathways. In addition, chronological lifespan
  is extended by increased availability of branched side chain amino acids (BCAA;
  leucine, isoleucine and valine) and a rise in synthesis and release of glycerol,
  which in turn is inhibited by sustained growth signalling (see text).On the other
  hand, under conditions where chronological aging is promoted ethanol is metabolized
  to acetate, which acts as a proaging trigger, in part by influencing internal and
  external pH as well as TOR signaling. Additionally, growth signaling leads to cell
  cycle progression and replication stress. Chronological aging-induced cell death
  has been shown to be regulated by a number of mitochondrial, nuclear and cytosolic
  lethal effectors and might also involve further factors associated with the yeast
  apoptotic machinery.
