caption: Schematic representation of the nucleus to cytoplasm NF-κB activation pathway
  in JCV infection. Infection of glial cells by JCV results in stress leading to NEMO
  sumoylation in the nucleus ① and activation of the DDR ②, which phosphorylates and
  activates ATM ③. Activated ATM binds NEMO and leads to phosphorylation of NEMO on
  Ser85 ④, which is involved in NEMO ubiquitination and export from the nucleus ⑤
  to the cytoplasm. ATM and NEMO activate IKK ⑥, which phosphorylates IκB leading
  to IκB degradation ⑦ and release of NF-κB ⑧ to migrate to the nucleus ⑨. Meanwhile,
  Rad51 is induced by the DDR ⑩ and associates with nuclear NF-κB ⑪ to activate JCV
  transcription ⑫
