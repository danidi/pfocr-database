caption: Neutrophil necroptosis triggered by various stimuli, including TNF, adhesion
  receptors, MSU crystals or phagocytosis of S. aureus. TNF-induced mouse neutrophil
  necroptosis is dependent on a RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL signaling pathway. Ligation of adhesion
  receptors, including CD44, CD11b, CD18, and CD15, can induce a human neutrophil
  necroptosis involving the RIPK3 – MLKL - p38 MAPK - PI3K axis, in which all of these
  molecular components are prerequisite for generation of ROS induced by NADPH oxidase,
  and subsequent necroptosis. However, how the RIPK3-MLKL complex activates p38 MAPK
  requires further investigation and confirmation in other cell types. MSU crystal-induced
  neutrophil necroptosis is triggered by ROS production which further activates RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL
  and subsequent cell death. The mechanism of ROS production by MSU exposure remains
  to be investigated. Phagocytosis of S. aureus can also trigger RIPK3-dependent regulated
  necrosis in human neutrophils
