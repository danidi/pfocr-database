caption: Putative mechanism of estrogen action in rat Sertoli cells. Estrogen interaction
  with classical nuclear ESRs induce translocation of these receptors to the plasma
  membrane, activation of SRC, which phosphorylates and activates EGFR, leading to
  activation of MAPK3/1 and gene transcription involved with Sertoli cell proliferation
  (pathway indicated by black arrows). Estrogen interaction with GPER leads to activation
  of SRC by βγ subunits of a G protein, activation of a metalloproteinase, which releases
  HB-EGF from the plasma membrane, leading to the activation of EGFR, MAPK3/1, and
  gene transcription involved with inhibition of Sertoli cell apoptosis (pathway indicated
  by red arrows). See text for more details.
