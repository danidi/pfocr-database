caption: 'Illustration of important relationships between metabolome, proteome, and
  genome in cancerous cells. Glycolysis breaks down glucose into pyruvate, which is
  then fermented to lactate; pyruvate flux through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  is down-regulated in cancer cells. Pathways branching off of glycolysis, such as
  the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), generate biochemical building blocks to sustain
  the high proliferative rate of cancer cells. Specific genetic and enzyme-level behaviors
  are described in the main text. Blue boxes are enzymes important in transitioning
  to a cancer metabolic phenotype; orange boxes are enzymes that are mutated in cancer
  cells. Green ovals are oncogenes that are up-regulated in cancer; red ovals are
  tumor suppressors that are down-regulated in cancer. Figure abbreviations: 2PG:
  2-phosphoglycerate; 3PG: 3-phosphoglycerate; BPG: 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate; CoA:
  coenzyme A; DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; F6P: fructose-6-phosphate; FBP: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
