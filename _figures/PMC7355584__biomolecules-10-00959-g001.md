caption: Role of ethylene signaling in seed germination under salinity stress. Ethylene
  induced by salinity stress activates the signaling pathway by inhibiting the active
  receptors and by releasing the Constitutive Triple Response1 (CTR1). Salinity-induced
  ethylene signal is transduced mainly through the classical receptors–CTR1-Ethylene-Insensitive2
  (EIN2)-EIN3 pathway to regulate many effectors involved in plant growth and salinity
  response. EIN3/EIN3-Like (EIL) promotes the entry of Constitutive Photomorphogenesis1
  (COP1) into the nucleus and degrades the Elongated Hypocotyl5 (HY5) protein, which
  inhibits seed germination by upregulating ABI5 gene expression. Degradation of HY5
  inhibits the expression of ABI5 and ultimately induced seed germination under salinity
  stress. On the other hand, EIN3/EIL also directly induces seed germination by scavenging
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) through upregulating peroxidase activities.
