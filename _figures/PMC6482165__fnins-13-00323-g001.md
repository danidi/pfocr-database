caption: Hypothalamic regulation of energy homeostasis in healthy (blue) and obesity
  (pink). The neuronal populations in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, POMC,
  and AgRP, senses and integrates peripheral adipostatic hormones (insulin and leptin),
  that circulate in levels proportionate to nutritional status and adipose tissue
  stores. Under the physiological postprandial state, insulin and leptin bind to respective
  receptors, both in POMC and AgRP neurons regulating the transcription of neuropeptides.
  Leptin and insulin signaling pathway stimulates POMC peptide transcription (activation
  of POMC neurons) and inhibits the transcription of AgRP neuropeptide (leading to
  AgRP neuronal inhibition). POMC neuronal activation involves the processing of POMC
  with the formation of α-MSH that is an agonist of MC4R in PVN neurons. PVN activation
  culminates in satiety (decreased food intake) and stimulation of energy expenditure
  (A). High-fat diet consumption and obesity induces a whole-body chronic inflammatory
  state. Proinflammatory cytokines produced during inflammation are responsible for
  hypothalamic insulin and leptin resistance, and consequently, the neuronal control
  of energy homeostasis is disrupted inducing an increase in food intake and a decrease
  in energy homeostasis (B). AgRP, agouti-related protein; Akt, protein kinase B;
