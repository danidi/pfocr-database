caption: The genetic pathomechanisms of FSHD types 1 and 2. Normal individuals have
  11 to more than 100 repeats (50–300 kb) of D4Z4 repeats on the sub-telomeric region
  of chromosome 4q35, whereas individuals with FSHD1 have a deletion of the array
  to 10 or fewer D4Z4 units (<39 kb). Contraction of D4Z4 repeats with the presence
  of a permissive 4qA haplotype or allele containing a polyadenylation signal (PAS,
  green box) then disrupts CpG methylation (hypomethylation), leading to chromatin
  relaxation at the array and allowing for the expression of a toxic transcription
  factor, DUX4 (double homeobox 4). Additionally, the DUX4 retrogene within the D4Z4
  unit lacks a stabilizing PAS but can use an additional exon immediately distal to
  the repeat that contains a polyadenylation signal (DUX4-PAS). In FSHD2, mutation
  of methylase-related genes, SMCHD1 or DNMT3B, also causes hypomethylation of D4Z4
  chromatin structure, resulting in DUX4 expression. There are several potential mechanisms
  of DUX4 involving in FSHD pathogenies. DUX4 has been implicated as being involved
  in apoptosis, myogenesis, epigenetic regulation, and regulatory signaling pathways
  in skeletal muscle and extramuscular tissues, including retinal vessels (Wnt/β-catenin
  pathway) and auditory cells (JNK pathway) [,,]. Picture modified from Lek et al.
  2015 [] and Lim et al. 2020 [].
