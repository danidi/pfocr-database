caption: BMP canonical signaling is transduced by two type I (BMPR-IA and BMPR-IB)
  and two type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, BMPR-II. BMPs bind
  to the heteromeric complex of type I and type II receptors. Subsequently, the type
  II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, which in turn facilitates phosphorylation
  of Smad1, 5 (R-Smads). R-Smads directly interact with the activated type I receptor
  and are released upon phosphorylation. Following release from the receptor complex,
  R-Smads complex with co-Smad 4 and translocate into the nucleus to modulate the
  transcription of target genes, including Id1 and Id2. Several natural extracellular
  proteins including Noggin and Chordin and the inhibitory Smads, Smad6 and Smad7,
  antagonize the BMP pathway. The small molecule dorsomorphin inhibits phosphorylation
  of Smads1, 5. Figure adapted from .
