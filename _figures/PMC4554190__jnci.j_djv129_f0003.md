caption: Illustration of data-enhanced Bayesian network inference. A) A signaling
  cascade in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) prostate cancer pathway.
  Nodes in the signaling cascade indicate proteins or protein families. Arrow with
  a solid line indicates activation. +p indicates phosphrylation. Arrow with a dashed
  line indicates indirect effect. The androgen receptor (AR) regulation of prostate
  specific antigen (PSA) is through binding to DNA and transcriptional activation
  of KLK3, which encodes PSA. B) Data-enhanced Posterior network inferred by Bayesian
  graphical model (BGM) analysis. One measurement feature is selected to represent
  each of the proteins or protein families in the signaling cascade (Supplementary
  Materials, section “Additional Results,” available online). The network includes
  only edges with the highest posterior probabilities. The numbers besides the edges
  are the posterior probabilities of including the edges inferred by BGM analysis
  (Supplementary Materials, section “Bayesian Graphical Models,” available online).
  All the other potential interaction edges have very low posterior probabilities
  (≤ 0.1) and not presented. Gene expression (GE) or protein expression (PE) in the
  parenthesis of each feature indicates gene expression or protein expression of the
  genes, respectively, which are used for analysis. Some of the protein expressions
  measure the abundances of proteins phosphrylated at specific positions. Positive
  interactions are indicated by green color and negative interactions are indicated
  by red color. Ser338, Ser217, and Ser221 indicate phosphorylations on serine-338,
  -217, and -221, respectively. GE = gene expression; PE = protein expression; Thr202
  = phosphorylation on threonine-202l; Tyr204 = phosphorylation on tyrosine-204.
