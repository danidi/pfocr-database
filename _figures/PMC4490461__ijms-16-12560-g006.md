caption: 'Schematic representations of mammalian homocysteine metabolism. Homocysteine
  metabolism is at the intersection of two main pathways: remethylation and transsulfuration
  pathway. Intracellular folate cycling is tightly connected to the remethylation
  pathway, in which methionine is activated by condensation with adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) to yield the ubiquitous methyl donor, SAM, which is transformed into SAH by
  donating its methyl group to the substrates of methylation reactions. Subsequently,
  SAH gives rise to homocysteine in a reversible reaction that favors SAH over homocysteine
  production. The transsulfuration process is catalyzed by two vitamin B6-dependent
  enzymes: CBS and CSE. Hcy can be sequentially converted into cystathionine and then
  cysteine by CBS and CSE and subsequently results in the generation of H2S and other
  by-products including homoserine, pyruvate, GSH, taurine, and serine as well. MS,
  methionine synthase; THF, tetrahydrofolate; MTHFR, methylene tetrahydrofolatereductase;
  BHMT, betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase; DMG, dimethylglycine; SAM, S-adenosyl
  methionine; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; CSE, cystathionine
  γ-lyase; GSH, glutathione.'
