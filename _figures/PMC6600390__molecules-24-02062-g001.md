caption: Possible interactions of CRP with blood cells and plasma components. Pentameric
  CRP (nCRP) bound to microbial polysaccharides or ligands exposed on damaged cells
  activates the classical complement pathway through the interaction with C1q. Both
  pro-and anti-inflammatory effects are attributed to nCRP via its interactions with
  blood cells (for details, please see ). At the site of the injured endothelium,
  circulating platelets undergo activation and spread. On the surface of the activated
  platelets, circulating cell-derived microparticles and apoptotic cell membranes,
  pentameric CRP dissociates to monomeric CRP (mCRP), which exerts pro-inflammatory
  effects by activating blood cells and by promoting inflammatory response. mCRP can
  be deposited in atherosclerotic lesions.
