caption: TGF-β signaling has been shown to regulate many epithelial cell types, however
  many of the common features of signaling through this pathway have been demonstrated
  using mammary epithelium. TGF-β has been shown to inhibit epithelial cell proliferation
  predominantly through Smad dependent regulation of p107 (Rb) activity via regulation
  of p15INK4B, p16INK4A, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 expression. In the presence of TGF-β,
  these cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors are upregulated and Rb remains hypo-phosphorylated
  thereby blocking cell cycle progression. TGF-β is also known to suppress c-myc expression
  that would otherwise provide an additional proliferative signal for the epithelium.
  However, one or more of these mediators are often mis-regulated during tumor progression
  and this can prevent the cytostatic regulation associated with TGF-β stimulation.
  In addition to cell cycle regulation, TGF-β is able to promote an epithelial to
  mesenchymal transition (EMT) that has been associated with increased motility and
  enhanced carcinoma cell invasion. Further, epithelial and carcinoma cell survival
  has also been associated with TGF-β signaling. Apoptosis induced by TGF-β can provide
  an additional level of regulation in favor of tumor suppression. The precise role
  for TGF-β in each epithelial cell population depends on the specific cell type and
  context of stimulation. Although non-transformed cells from a given organ under
  clearly defined conditions will often respond to TGF-β in a similar manner, due
  to the complex nature of parallel intrinsic and extrinsic signaling unique to the
  cancer evolution in each patient, it is often difficult to predict the proliferative,
  EMT, or apoptotic impact of TGF-β signaling in a carcinoma cell population a priori.
