caption: The two subunits of the mature NOTCH1 receptor are generated by cleavage
  by a furin protease in the trans-Golgi network soon after translation of NOTCH1
  precursor protein. The extracellular subunit responsible for ligand-receptor interaction
  and the transmembrane subunit responsible for triggering transcription activation
  interact by their respective heterodimerization (HD) domains. Upon binding to its
  ligands –Delta-like 1, 3 and 4; Jagged 1 and 2– the transmembrane portion of NOTCH1
  is sequentially cleaved by ADAM proteases and then by the γ-secretase complex. This
  final proteolytic cleavage liberates the active intracellular fragment of NOTCH1
  (ICN1), which translocates to the nucleus and activates the expression of target
  genes by forming a ternary complex with the CSL DNA binding protein and the MAML1
  transcriptional coactivator. Small molecule inhibitors of the γ-secretase block
  NOTCH1 activation by retaining the receptor at the membrane. NOTCH1 promotes cell
  growth by transcriptional upregulation of genes involved in anabolic pathways and
  also by transcriptional upregulation of MYC. In addition NOTCH1 induces the expression
  of HES1, a transcriptional repressor that promotes the upregulation of the PI3K-AKT
  signaling pathway by transcriptional downregulation of PTEN. Termination of NOTCH1
  signaling is mediated by phosphorylated-coupled degradation of the activated receptor
  in the proteasome via FBXW7-SCF.
