caption: 'Summary of the main effects of diabetes and NRG1 treatment in gastrocnemius
  muscle. The abundance of ERBB receptors is increased in diabetic db/db mice. This
  is associated with increased phosphorylation ratio of ERBB2 and decreased phosphorylation
  ratios of ERBB3 and ERBB4. Similarly, phosphorylation (activation) of the metabolic
  regulators AMPK, ACC and ACL is reduced in diabetic mice as well as Pparb and Tfam
  mRNA expression level. However, mitochondrial respiration in permeabilised fibres
  is similar in diabetic and control healthy mice. Chronic NRG1 treatment increases
  ERBB4 phosphorylation and tends to decrease ERBB3 phosphorylation. Among the regulators
  of the mitochondrial biogenesis pathway, only Pparb mRNA expression is slightly
  increased by NRG1. However, in NRG1-treated mice, complex 2-mediated mitochondrial
  respiration and complex 2 subunit abundance are increased. Effect of diabetes: red
  arrows. Effect of NRG1: green arrows. Figure was produced using Servier Medical
