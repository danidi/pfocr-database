caption: 4HPR mediates the neuronal differentiation of ARPE-19 cells by activating
  both c-Raf and MEK1/2, while the activation of its downstream targets such as SAPK/JNK
  and MAPK/ERK1/2 was regulated by MEK1/2. The activation of ERK1/2 appears to activate
  its downstream targets such as p90RSK and SAPK/JNK, and resulted in the phosphorylation
  of c-Fos and c-Jun, respectively. The activated form of c-Fos and c-Jun mediates
  the transactivation of AP-1, one of the effectors of differentiation, perhaps through
  an AP-1 response element present in the promoter of the neuronal marker calretinin.
  The question mark (?) indicates that the involvement of retinoid receptors in this
  process is not yet known.
