caption: Schematic model for MMP3 regulation of BBB permeability. MMP3 is produced
  by BMVECs in response to external factors and phosphorylates ERK, which subsequently
  disrupts tight junctions between adjacent ECs, thereby increasing BBB permeability.
  BBB integrity can be preserved via ERK inhibition or by blocking MMP3 activity with
  NNGH.
