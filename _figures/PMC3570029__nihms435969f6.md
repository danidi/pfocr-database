caption: The proposed pathway of VPO1 mediation of ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell
  apoptosis. Ox-LDL up-regulates the expression of NADPH oxidase subunit gp91phox
  and consequently increases intracellular ROS production and VPO1 expression as well
  as HOCl production. There is a positive feedback loop between VPO1/HOCl and the
  NADPH oxidase/ROS pathway, which in turn activates the p38 MAPK/caspase-3-dependent
  signaling pathway to mediate ox-LDL-induced endothelial cell apoptosis.
