caption: Figure 1. Schematisation of the potential relationship between mevalonate
  metabolism and cell cycle control in a CSC mutated for p53. The mutant form of p53
  acts as a transcription factor that induces the expression of enzymes involved in
  mevalonate metabolism. The mevalonate pathway activates RHOA, which needs to be
  geranylgeranylated to translocate to the membrane. Activated RHOA protein is known
  to regulate P27kip1 by enhancing its degradation and inhibiting its translocation
  to the nucleus where it controls the cell cycle stages that regulate stem cell fate
  by allowing equilibrium between self-renewal and committed cell fate decision.
