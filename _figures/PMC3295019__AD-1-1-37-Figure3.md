  []. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that impaired nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity
  has critical role in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction. NO production in
  endothelial cells significantly decreases in an age-dependent way. Endothelial NO
  synthase (eNOS) acts as an anti-senescent factor and aging may decrease the activity
  as well as expression level of eNOS []. Senescent human endothelial cells exhibited
  decreased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity []. Changes of intracellular eNOS
  binding proteins as well as interaction between eNOS and eNOS binding proteins may
  decrease enzyme activity in aged human endothelial cells. Clinical evidence suggests
  that low-dose aspirin may improve vascular endothelial function. This effect appears
  to be due to a direct acetylation of the eNOS protein which stimulates NO release
  []. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) transcription factor system is the major
  signaling pathway evoking the inflammatory responses. Inflammatory activation of
  microglia and astrocytes causes induction of NF-κB, and release of the inflammatory
  mediator tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α []. TNFα is a potent cytokine with an important
  role in coordinating immune and inflammatory reactions; this cytokine exerts its
  effects by binding to specific cell surface receptors, which activate a number of
  intracellular signaling cascades including the NF-κB.
