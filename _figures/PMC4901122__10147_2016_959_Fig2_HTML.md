caption: Relationship between PD-1 signal and genomic mutation. Mutated neo-antigens
  are expressed on the surface of a cancer cell in response to genomic mutation and
  amplification of a cancer cell. Recognition of a neo-antigen as a foreign body by
  an antigen-presenting cell (APC) induces a T-cell response, and consequently the
  activated T cell releases interferon (IFN)-γ. A cancer cell that is exposed to IFN-γ
  expresses PD-L1, thereby establishing an acquired immune resistance. In this type
  of tumor microenvironment, a PD-1 pathway inhibitor should be effective; thus, genome-wide
  mutation analysis (i.e., mutanome analysis) of cancer cells using next-generation
  sequencing technology and diversity analysis of the T-cell repertoire (i.e., the
  immunome) have attracted attention as strategies for identification of predictive
  biomarkers. APC antigen-presenting cell
