caption: Intracellular Ca2+signalling in alcoholic acute pancreatitis. In the pancreas,
  non-oxidative ethanol metabolism is the dominant metabolic pathway mediated by enzymes
  with fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) synthase activity, which combine ethanol and
  fatty acids to generate FAEE. In pancreatic acinar cells, FAEEs are accumulated
  in the mitochondria and their local breakdown leads to localised high concentrations
  of fatty acids. Similar to bile acids, FAEEs induce sustained [Ca2+]i elevation
  and drop of cellular ATP leading to necrosis. In addition, alcohol and fatty acids
  inhibit fluid and HCO3- secretion in the pancreatic ductal epithelia, mainly due
  to the impaired expression and function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR).
