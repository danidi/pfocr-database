caption: A suggested interaction model between EBV and P. gingivalis in the development
  of oral cancer. (1) The increase in the relative abundance of P. gingivalis leads
  to a dysbiotic oral microenvironment, in turn promoting chronic inflammation. (2)
  Products of oxidative stress are reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to
  DNA damage. (3) DNA alterations favor the establishment of EBV latency in oral epithelial
  cells. (4, 5) Butyric acid wasted by P. gingivalis inhibits HDACs, promotes histone
  acetylation, EBV IE gene expression, which in turn promotes the abortive lytic cycle
  activation in which some latent and lytic viral genes are expressed, such as BARF1.
  (6) The secreted protein BARF1 modulates host immune response, through M-CSF acting
  as a decoy receptor, promoting a reduction in macrophage activation and differentiation.
  (7) P. gingivalis, through its virulence factors, can activate EGFR/PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway (8) The sum of these factors and the inflammatory environment caused by
  host immune response contribute to the transformation process and development of
  oral cancer.
