caption: 'Metabolic pathway of vinyl chloride and the impact on toxicity. Vinyl chloride
  is primarily metabolized to chloroethylene oxide by hepatic CYP2E1. The active metabolite
  undergoes rearrangement to chloroacetaldehyde or is metabolized to glycolaldehyde
  by epoxide hydrolase. Chloroacetaldehyde can be further converted to 2‐chloroethanol
  or metabolized to 2‐chloroacetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Glycolaldehyde
  as well as glutathione conjugates of chloroethylene oxide, chloroacetaldehyde, 2‐chloroethanol,
  and 2‐chloroacetic acid are inactive metabolites. Chloroethylene oxide and chloroacetaldehyde
  are the reactive intermediate metabolites, and their formation of DNA and protein
  adducts is closely related to the carcinogenic property of vinyl chloride. In addition
  to vinyl chloride, 2‐chloroethanol is involved in the enhanced susceptibility to
  liver injury by dysregulating glucose metabolism and inducing mitochondrial damage.
  Diet‐induced obesity or a high‐fat diet can sensitize the liver for injury induced
  by sub‐ppm levels of vinyl chloride. Alcohol and a high‐fat diet also enhance susceptibility
  to liver injury by inducing CYP2E1. Abbreviation: ER, endoplasmic reticulum.'
