caption: Graphical representation of the potential apoptotic pathway induced by the
  Human-RPSA siRNA in late (DLD-1) stage colorectal cancer cell. Under normal conditions,
  TRF-1 and TRF-2 binds to telomeres and negatively regulates telomere length by forming
  the t-loop structure at the ends of chromosomes to mask the G-rich overhang. Upon
  siRNA-mediated knock-down of LRP/LR, TRF-2 protein expression levels are decreased,
  leaving the ends of chromosomes exposed and free to fuse with each other, which
  can lead to genetic instability. The knock-down of LRP/LR was also found to decrease
  telomerase activity and hTERT expression levels, causing progressive telomere shortening
  and the inactivation of the telomere capping function, further contributing to chromosomal
  end fusion and genetic instability. This leads to the G-rich overhang being exposed
  and recognised as a double stranded break by γH2AX. This results in the activation
  of the DNA damage response pathway whereby ATM kinase activated p53. This leads
  to the activation of several other pro-apoptotic proteins as well as the inactivation
  of anti-apoptotic proteins, ultimately leading to apoptotic induction
