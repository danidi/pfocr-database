caption: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways involved
  in immune escape. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression noted in
  squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck results in constitutive STAT3 activation
  through the JAK/STAT pathway. STAT3 is a known oncogenic transcription factor which
  results in tumor growth and immune suppression, in part due to the induction of
  immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth
  factor (VEGF) and interleukin 10 (IL-10). The IL-6R/CD130 signaling complex, also
  upregulated in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, is a major pathway
  in EGFR-independent STAT3 activation and may contribute to the modest response seen
  in therapy with EGFR-blocking antibodies. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) activates STAT1 phosphorylation
  which opposes the action of STAT3, EGFR overexpression activates SHP2 which conversely
  inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT1.
