caption: Tonic excitatory drive and the control of neuronal rhythms. Neurons of the
  ascending arousal systems release transmitters such as orexin, acetylcholine (ACh),
  5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA), which induce signalling
  systems to control neural rhythms that occur during the sleep/wake cycle. The tonic
  excitatory drive mechanism depends on membrane depolarization driven by different
  signalling mechanisms. Hydrolysis of the phospholipid PtdIns4,5P2 has two effects.
  First, it closes the KV 7.2/7.3 channels responsible for the M current. Switching
  off this M current depolarizes the membrane to increase neuronal activity. Secondly,
  the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) releases Ca2+ that stimulates
  the Ca2+-activated non-selective cation (CAN) channel. The CAN channel can also
  be activated by Ca2+ entering through the voltage-operated Ca2+ (VOC) channel. The
  NA and DA act through the cyclic AMP signalling pathway to enhance the activity
  of the hyperpolarizing-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel responsible
  for the depolarizing Ih current.
