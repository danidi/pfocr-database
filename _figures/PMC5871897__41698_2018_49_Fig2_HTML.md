caption: The RAS-ERK signaling pathway. Binding of EGF (epidermal growth factor) activates
  EGFR, providing the docking sites for several SH2 (src homology 2) domain-containing
  adaptor proteins such as Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2), Shc (src
  homology 2 domain-containing), PLCγ (phospholipase C γ), and p110 subunit of the
  PI3 kinase (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase). As the major route
  involving the EGFR activation by EGF binding, Grb2-SOS (son of sevenless) complex
  is recruited to the receptor through SH2 domain, allowing SOS to activate RAS by
  exchanging GDP (guanosine diphosphate) to GTP (guanosine triphosphate). GTP-bound
  RAS activates the RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcom)-MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase)-ERK
  (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase cascade by series of phosphorylations.
  Phosphorlyated ERK translocates to nucleus and activates trasncription factors,
  such as ATF (activating transcription factor), leading to expression of the target
  genes
