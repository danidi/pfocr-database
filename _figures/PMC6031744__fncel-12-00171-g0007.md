caption: Vesicle pools and endocytic pathways at rodent hippocampal synapses. A conventional
  small synapse in the hippocampus contains a single active zone, at which about 10
  vesicles are docked. These vesicles are in the RRP. An additional 16 vesicles are
  in the recycling pool, while ~240 are in the reserve pool. Synaptic vesicle recycling
  occurs on a timescale of 7–10 s at physiological temperatures as measured by optical
  imaging. This time constant matches the time constant for regeneration of synaptic
  vesicles through ultrafast endocytosis and subsequent endosomal sorting, but traditionally
  this pathway is thought to be operated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Activity
  bulk endocytosis occurs in response to intense stimulation and is completed over
  several minutes. Kiss-and-run has also been proposed but is still debated.
