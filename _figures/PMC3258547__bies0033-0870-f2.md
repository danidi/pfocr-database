caption: 'The signaling function and intracellular location of the Gap1 amino acid
  transceptor upon resupply of an amino acid to nitrogen-starved cells. A: When faced
  with nitrogen deprivation, yeast cells enter into a quiescent, resting phase, known
  as stationary phase. Under these conditions, PKA has low activity and cellular characteristics
  correlated with fermentative growth are down-regulated, whereas stationary-phase
  characteristics are up-regulated. The amino acid transceptor Gap1 is stabilized
  at the plasma membrane. Addition of amino acids to nitrogen-depleted cells causes
  rapid activation of PKA, which helps preparing the cells for both the resumption
  of fermentative growth and the down-regulation of stationary-phase characteristics.
  Amino acid-induced activation of PKA was shown to be mediated by the receptor function
  of Gap1. Deciphering the downstream signaling pathway connecting the amino acid
  transceptor to PKA, requires further research. Amino acid uptake by Gap1 also results
  in its ubiquitination, endocytic internalization, and targeting to the vacuolar
  degradation pathway. The rapid, nitrogen-induced down-regulation of Gap1 may have
  evolved as an additional regulatory mechanism, safeguarding the cell against the
  detrimental effects of overstimulation of the PKA pathway. B: The fate of Gap1-GFP
  is shown as a function of the external nitrogen supply. Under conditions of nitrogen
  depletion (24 hours), Gap1-GFP is localized at the plasma membrane and in the vacuolar
  lumen. Addition of 5 mM l-citrulline as sole nitrogen source for 60 minutes results
  in delocalization of Gap1-GFP from the plasma membrane to intracellular vesicles
  and especially to the vacuole/lysosome. The cells were simultaneously co-stained
  with the lipophylic dye FM4-64, which after endocytosis, locates at the vacuolar
  limiting membrane.'
