caption: 'PTP4A1 promotes TGFβ signaling in DFs. PTP4A1 interacts with SRC and promotes
  SRC half-life, which in turn enhances activation of the MAPK pathway. Activated
  ERK1/2 induces transcription of SMAD3 and promotes TGFβ-driven SMAD3 nuclear translocation,
  which boosts pro-fibrotic TGFβ signaling. PTP4A2, despite its high identity with
  PTP4A1, does not interact with SRC or affect the MAPK–SMAD3 pathway. However, it
  also promotes pro-fibrotic signaling, perhaps through selective activation of the
  ROCK pathway. Orange continuous connectors: TGFβ signaling pathways. Black connectors:
