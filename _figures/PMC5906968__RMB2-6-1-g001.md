caption: Schematic representation of the regulatory pathways affecting gene expression
  during mouse spermatogenesis. Spermatids are connected by intercellular bridges.
  The pathway of transcriptional control by CREM‐τ is shown in green. RNA‐binding
  proteins or poly(A)‐RNA polymerases modify the translation of transcribed mRNAs,
  which are then transferred to the cytoplasm along microtubules by the kinesin KIF17b
  (red). Some mRNAs are transferred to another cell through the intercellular bridge
  (blue). The timing of translation is regulated by RNA‐binding proteins (yellow).
  Circles indicate proteins, T.C. indicates the transcriptional complex, and the boxed
  Y and H indicate Y‐ and H‐elements on the mRNA, respectively. Bars indicate microtubule
  networks, and arrows show the direction of movement of protein and protein‐mRNA
  complexes. Doublet boxes and circles indicate cell membranes and nuclear membranes,
  respectively.
