caption: Key metabolic pathways and metabolic intermediates in Mtb immune responses.
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are notated as Mtb in green, and processes upregulated
  and downregulated by infection indicated using green arrows (➔) and red lines (=)
  respectively. (A) Glycolysis converts glucose to lactate which may act as both a
  fuel source for Mtb and have direct antimicrobial effects. GLUT1, the glucose transporter,
  is upregulated in response to Mtb infection, and hexokinase 2 (HK2) is also upregulated
  to allow an enhanced glycolytic rate. Mtb may limit the induction of glycolysis
  by negative regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1).
  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is upregulated in infected macrophages, allowing enhanced
  conversion of pyruvate to lactate, which may act as an alternative fuel source for
  Mtb or a directly toxic antimicrobial mediator. There is evidence that Mtb negatively
  regulates this process. Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) works in tandem with hypoxia inducible
  factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) to allow transcription of IL-1β. (B) The pentose phosphate
  pathway produces NADPH which is used to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
  nitric oxide (NO) which are directly antimicrobial, and NO has additional roles
  in the potentiation of glycolytic metabolism. Live Mtb may negatively regulate flux
  through this pathway to limit these actions. (C) A tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  break point leads to an accumulation of itaconate which can inhibit the Mtb enzyme
  isocitrate lyase (ICL), while also protecting the host from excessive inflammation
  by limiting the oxidation of succinate by succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and inflammatory
  gene expression. A second TCA cycle break point leads to a build-up of succinate
  which can (i) lead to the generation of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) which are directly
  antimicrobial and also support the production of IL-1β, stabilize HIF-1α to promote
  glycolysis by inhibiting prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and (iii) play a role in the
  induction of innate immune training. (D) Lipids are key cellular fuel sources exploited
  by Mtb to promote its growth and inhibit its destruction within the cell. Amino
  acids are also important in Mtb responses. Arginine can be metabolized into antimicrobial
  NO by inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) or into ornithine by arginase 1 (Arg1)
  which is anti-inflammatory. Likewise, tryptophan can be broken down into kynurenine
  by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) which is also anti-inflammatory. Glutamine
  has been shown to play roles in the production of IL-1β, generating NO and inducing
  innate immune training.
