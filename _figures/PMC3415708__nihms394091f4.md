caption: The mitochondrial dysfunction pathway was identified by the Ingenuity® Pathways
  Analysis software (https://analysisingenuity.com) as the most significantly altered
  biological function in UOK262 compared to the normal renal cell line HK-2. Genes
  transcripts up-regulated in UOK268 are highlighted in green and down-regulated are
  highlighted in red. This figure was adapted by removing the aspects of the pathway
  containing no significantly dysregulated transcripts.
