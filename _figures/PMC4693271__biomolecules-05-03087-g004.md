caption: Ubiquitination-mediated signaling cascades in canonical and non-canonical
  NF-κB pathways. In canonical pathway, binding of TNF-α to TNFR1 triggers recruitment
  of the adaptor protein TRADD, which stimulates the formation of a complex consisting
  of TRAF2, RIP1, cIAP1 and cIAP2. Additionally, cIAPs promote K63 linkage-mediated
  ubiquitination of RIP1, which in turn leads to the recruitment of LUBAC. LUBAC results
  in stabilization of the complex by further ubiquitination, thereby providing the
  docking sites of TAB2/TAB3/TAK1 and IKK complexes, as well as their activation.
  The activation of IKKβ leads to K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation
  of IκB, thus facilitating liberation of p65/p50. During non-canonical activation
  (e.g., CD40 ligation), cIAP1/2 are recruited to receptor complexes by TRAF2 where
  they target TRAF3 for K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction, thereby
  facilitating the release of NIK. The accumulated NIK phosphorylates IKKα, which
  in turn leads to a partial degradation of p100 to p52, facilitating nuclear translocation
  of RelB:p52 dimer. Under resting conditions, NIK is consistently targeted by cIAPs
  for K48-linked ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation.
