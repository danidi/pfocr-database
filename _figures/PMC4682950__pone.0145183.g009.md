caption: (1) Hyperoside decreases the Keap1 protein level, most likely by facilitating
  Keap1 protein degradation, which resulted in a drop in Nrf2 protein degradation;
  (2) MicroRNA(s), which has been proposed to target Nrf2 mRNA by binding to its 3′-UTR
  and result in decreased levels of Nrf2 protein, might be involved in hyperoside-mediated
  increases in the Nrf2 mRNA level; (3) GSK-3β possibly acts as an integrator of a
  number of kinases such as ERK, p38 and other yet undefined signaling kinase(s) in
  hyperoside-mediated Nrf2 activation. All of the above mentionedmechanisms lead to
  increases in Nrf2 nuclear accumulation and Nrf2 target gene expression. (The dashed
  line highlights that this is a strong suggestion and has not been experimentally
  proven).
