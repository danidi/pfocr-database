caption: mTORC1 as a key hub transducing the metabolic effects of glucose and fructose
  in the liver. Fructose activates mTORC1 leading to reduced gluconeogenesis and enhanced
  lipogenesis which, together with PPARα/β-oxidation activity and autophagy inhibition
  contribute to hepatic fat deposition observed in our studies after sub-chronic administration
  of fructose (for two months) in female rats. By contrast, sustained activation of
  the mTORC1-IRE1 pathway by chronic fructose supplementation could prevent fat deposition
  in the liver. Fructose-induced hyperinsulinemia, which activates mTORC1 and the
  increase in plasma adiponectin levels caused by glucose administration, which inhibits
  mTORC1 via AMPK activation, lead to a different extent of mTORC1 activation by these
  simple sugars, which seems to be responsible for the different metabolic effects
  of fructose and glucose supplementation observed in our studies performed in female
  rats.
