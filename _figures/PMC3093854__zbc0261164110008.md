caption: Proposed model for CD36 involvement in calcium influx, cPLA2 activation,
  and PGE2synthesis. UTP or thapsigargin (TG) treatment releases ER calcium via different
  mechanisms. Thapsigargin inhibits the ER calcium pump SERCA2, and UTP acts via membrane
  purinergic receptors (P2Y) to activate the inositol triphosphate pathway for ER
  calcium release. The increase in cytosolic calcium drives CD36 to the plasma membrane
  or inhibits its internalization. CD36 persistent localization at the plasma membrane
  allows the associated Src family kinase Fyn to phosphorylate and activate membrane
  calcium channels responsive to ER calcium depletion. The sustained rise in intracellular
  calcium translocates cPLA2 to nuclear and ER membranes, where it acts to release
  arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of phospholipids. The enzyme is also activated
  via CD36-dependent phosphorylation by the MAPK ERK1/2. The arachidonic acid produced
  is either released from the cell or converted by cyclooxygenases into eicosanoids,
  bioactive molecules with pleiotropic effects in inflammation. One of the major products
  formed from arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenase pathway is PGE2.
