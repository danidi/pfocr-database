caption: Schematic representation of the canonical RB/E2F pathway in cell cycle progression.
  In G1, cells can either enter S phase or exit the cell cycle into G0. Entry into
  S phase requires activation of transcriptional programs controlled by E2F activity.
  Binding of repressive complexes involving RB and E2F family members to the promoters
  of cell cycle genes silences their transcription in both G0 and G1. Repressive RB/E2F
  complexes consist of an RB family member, either E2F4 or E2F5, and additional chromatin
  modification and remodeling factors, including histone deacetylases (HDACs). In
  G0, repressive complexes generally contain p130 and the MuvB core complex (DREAM
  complex), whereas p107 predominates in G1. When cells enter S phase, Cyclin-CDK
  activity is upregulated and phosphorylates RB family proteins, promoting the dissociation
  of repressive RB/E2F complexes, and releasing “activator” E2Fs to upregulate the
  expression of cell cycle genes with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and other
  chromatin-modifying factors.
