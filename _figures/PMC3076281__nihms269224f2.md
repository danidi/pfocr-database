caption: Sphingolipid effects on intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. The two
  pathways to apoptosis are shown. The extrinsic pathway begins by ligand binding
  to cell surface receptors such as FasR or TNFR, followed by recruitment of Death
  Domain containing protein adaptors (e.g., TRADD) resulting in the formation of Death-Inducing
  Signaling Complex (DISC). This complex then activates the caspase cascade, culminating
  in cell death. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway begins when pro-apoptotic
  members of the Bcl-2 family cause mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, which binds
  to and activates Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor), resulting in subsequent
  activation of the caspase cascade. Smac/DIABLO (Second mitochondria-derived activator
  of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding protein with low pI) is also released,
  inhibiting XIAP. XIAP (X-linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) functions as an
  inhibitor of caspases 3, 7 and 9. Shown are also the influence of ceramide, A-SMase
  and S1P on different components of the pathway.

  description: Sphingolipid effects on intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways.
    The two pathways to apoptosis are shown. The extrinsic pathway begins by ligand
    binding to cell surface receptors such as FasR or TNFR, followed by recruitment
    of Death Domain containing protein adaptors (e.g., TRADD) resulting in the formation

    cytochrome c, which binds to and activates Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating
    factor), resulting in subsequent activation of the caspase cascade. Smac/DIABLO
    (Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding
    protein with low pI) is also released, inhibiting XIAP. XIAP (X-linked Inhibitor
    of Apoptosis Protein) functions as an inhibitor of caspases 3, 7 and 9. Shown
    are also the influence of ceramide, A-SMase and S1P on different components of
    the pathway.
