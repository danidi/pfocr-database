caption: A basic depiction of the classical view of the PI3K signaling network (black
  arrows) as well as the novel signaling pathway revealed in the study by Tan et al.
  () (green arrows). Tumors with hyperactive PDK1 signaling, in addition to signaling
  through the classical downstream effector AKT, induce a novel signaling pathway
  through phosphorylation of PLK1. Phosphorylation and activation of PLK1 results
  in phosphorylation of Serine 62 of MYC, leading to stabilization of MYC protein
  which promotes cellular transformation, in part through transcriptional upregulation
  of a cancer stem cell-like gene signature. As reported by Tan and colleagues (),
  therapeutic targeting of this novel signaling pathway with inhibitors of PDK1 (BX795
  or BX912) or PLK1 (BI2536 or GW843682X) promotes programmed cell death of cancer
  cells that rely on MYC hyperactivation.
