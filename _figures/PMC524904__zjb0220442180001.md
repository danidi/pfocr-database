caption: 'Pathway and operon for ethanolamine degradation. Ado-B12 serves as a coinducer
  of the operon and cofactor for EA-lyase. Degradation of ethanolamine provides both
  a carbon source and nitrogen source (). Cbi (cobinamide) is a corrinoid lacking
  upper and lower ligands that can be adenosylated by CobA to produce Ado-Cbi, a biosynthetic
  precursor of B12. All eut genes are indicated above the map with the two normal
  promoters: the major regulated promoter (PI) and the minor constitutive eutR promoter
  (PII) (, -). Transposon-associated introduced promoters are below the map.'
