caption: In canonical pathway (left), the binding of specific ligand to a receptor
  leads to the phosphorylation of IκB by IKK complex comprising of IKKα, IKKβ and
  NEMO which releases active NF-κB dimer that translocates in to nucleus to transcribe
  target genes. In non-canonical pathway (right), the binding of ligand to receptor
  leads to processing of p100/RelB via NIK mediated activation of IKK complex comprising
  of two units of IKKα. The processed p52/RelB translocates in to the nucleus to transcribe
  target genes.
