caption: Central carbon metabolism pathways in E. coli. The Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas
  (EMP), pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) in E.
  coli during growth in glucose. In the figure PTS (in blue), the non PTS glucose
  uptake system (in purple), PEP node (green) and AAA (yellow) enzymes are depicted.
  The allosteric effects that PEP has in EMP and acetate biosynthesis are in orange
  line for inhibition and blue arrow for activation.
