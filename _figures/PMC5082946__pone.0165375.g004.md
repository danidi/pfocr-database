caption: 'In the dark (not pictured), PET and phage replication are stunted because
  the cell is not receiving light energy. In the light, however, energy (hν) excites
  electrons in water to travel through the photosynthetic electron chain, with the
  terminal electron acceptor being NADP+ via ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase (FNR) in uninfected
  cells (A) and oxygen via plastoquinol terminal oxidase (PTOX) or cytochrome c oxidase
  (COX) in infected cells (B). Under phage infection, host FNR transcripts are diminished,
  and therefore the proposed terminal electron acceptor is not NADP+. Rather, cyclic
  electron flow goes through NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH) or direct to plastoquinone,
  with PTOX serving as the terminal electron acceptor. Cyanophage P-HM2 genes (filled
  viruses) are transcribed for high-light inducible proteins (HLIPs), photosystem
  II (PSII), the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and nucleotide biosynthesis; additional
  cyanophage genes not in P-HM2 (unfilled viruses) exist for modules along this metabolic
  network. NADPH is proposed to be generated from pre-existing reduced carbon (glucose)
  via the PPP. Any NADPH produced by FNR would be designated for the Calvin cycle
  by docking of FNR with GAPDH and therefore unproductive because of Calvin cycle
  inhibition by phage CP12. In this model of light-driven phage infection, therefore,
  the main source of energy (ATP) is cyclic photosynthesis and of reducing equivalents
  (NADPH) is the PPP, with ATP and NADPH consumed in the production of nucleotides
  to replicate the phage genome. Other abbreviations: PQ/PQH2, plastoquinone/plastoquinol
  (oxidized/reduced); Cyt b6f, cytochrome b6f, PCox/PCred, plastocyanin (oxidized/reduced);
  PSI, photosystem I; Fd, ferredoxin; ATPase, F1F0-ATP synthase.'
