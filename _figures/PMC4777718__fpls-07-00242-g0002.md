caption: A view of L-homoserine biosynthesis pathway page. By clicking on more- or
  less-detail, users can manipulate the information shown on the page. For example,
  the most detailed output (A) shows the structures of the compounds. The links for
  the preceding L-aspartate biosynthesis pathway as well as for the successive biosynthesis
  pathways for L-methionine and L-threonine are highlighted in green color. The top
  right side panel shows links to Omics Viewer for uploading the expression data (B),
  and for pathway comparisons across various species (C) by accessing other publicly
  available metabolic pathway databases from http://pathways.cgrb.oregonstate.edu.
