caption: 'Schematic of cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis in An. gambiae. Schematic showing
  the steps in cuticular hydrocarbon synthesis, adapted from Blomquist 1987 and Balabanidou
  et al., together with a list of putative members of each gene family in An. gambiae.
  All gene families are shown in blue and represent: FAS fatty acid synthases, elongases
  fatty acid elongases, reductases fatty acid reductases, desaturases fatty acid desaturases.
  General chemical classes at each step are shown in light red hexagons. Highlighted
  in green circles are the transcripts present in the correlation network of CYP4G16.
  The correlation network is significantly enriched for this pathway p(hypergeometric
  test) = 1.44e−12. Figure created expressly for this manuscript by Manuela Bernardi'
