caption: 'Schematic representation of FGFR1/FGF21/βKlotho complex actions in the cardiomyocytes.
  (a) FGF21 is produced mainly in the liver and adipose tissue. (b) Different cardiac
  stress stimuli activate Sirt1-PPARα pathway in the heart. It leads to production
  of FGF21 in the cardiomyocytes in an autocrine manner. (c) FGF21 creates a complex
  with membrane-bound βKlotho and FGFR1 in the cardiac cells. Activation of FGFR1/FGF21/βKlotho
  network induces cardioprotection. (d) The activation of cell survival PI3K/Akt1
  pathway leads to phosphorylation of BAD. It exerts the separation of antiapoptotic
  proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 and inhibits the activity of caspase-3. As a result, the
  apoptosis of cardiac cells is reduced. (e) FGFR1/FGF21/βKlotho signaling regulates
  genes encoding proteins involved in antioxidant pathways: UCP3 and SOD2. It decreases
  ROS production and oxidative stress in cardiac cells. (f) The main intracellular
  pathway responsible for FGFR1/FGF21/βKlotho action is ERK. PGC1α is a transcriptional
  coactivator of PPARγ, involved in the control of energy metabolism and oxidative
  stress. The activation of PGC1α represses expression of proinflammatory cytokines
  by targeting NF-κB signaling. It also enhances energy supply by regulation of cardiac
  lipid metabolism. BAD, Bcl-2-associated death promoter; ER, endoplasmic reticulum;
