caption: Proposed scheme for a second messenger pathway triggered by TGF-β1 leading
  to the induction of ZEBRA. (A) In Raji and B95-8 cells, TGF-β1 causes activation
  of PKC and/or initiation of the Raf-MEK-ERK MAPK cascade. TGF-β1 also used an activity
  determined by the method described by Gorman et al. () as an additional signaling
  pathway to mediate the induction of ZEBRA expression. (B) In Mutu I cells, the Raf-MEK-ERK
  MAPK cascade is used as signal transducer. Moreover a cross talk between pathways
  will lead to a Raf-independent MEK1,2 activation. Thick arrows represent proposed
  routes. PD98059 acts by inhibiting the activation of MEK1,2 by Raf kinase, U0126
  acts both on inactive and active forms of MEK1,2. GF-109203X is a potent inhibitor
  of PKC.
