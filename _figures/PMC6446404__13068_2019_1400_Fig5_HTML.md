caption: Simplified schematic depiction of the major signalling cascades in filamentous
  fungal cell factories. MAPK cascades are initiated at the plasma membrane by two
  main processes. Firstly, a G protein’s α subunit activates a protein activated kinase
  (PAK), which phosphorylates an MAPKKK. Secondly, in the two-component signal transduction
  system, a transmembrane histidine kinase (HK) is activated by extracellular ligands
  and a response regulator (REG) activates a histidine-containing phospho-transmitter
  (HP) that subsequently activates MAPK signalling. Alternatively, mechanosensors
  such as WSC receptors [] at the cell surface are activated by cell wall perturbation,
  which activate MAPK cascades via GTPases (e.g. Rho1) and protein kinase C (PkcA).
  Once active, a phosphorelay system between MAPKKK, MAPKK and MAPK results in phosphorylation
  of downstream transcription factors. In the PKA/cAMP pathway, a G-protein coupled
  receptor (GPCR) is activated at the plasma membrane and ultimately the G protein’s
  α subunit (α-sub) dissociates from the GPCR complex and activates an adenylyl cyclase
  (AC). This, in turn, catalyses the conversion of ATP into cAMP. Increases in concentration
  of the second messenger cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates
  various target proteins, including transcription factors. These enter the nucleus
  and regulate diverse responses. In calcium signalling, low- and high-affinity Ca2+
  influx systems are activated at the plasma membrane. Ca2+ ions bind and activate
  calmodulin (CaM), which in turn binds to subunit A of the protein calcineurin (CnaA).
  Once activated, calcineurin dephosphorylates the transcription factor CrzA, which
  causes elevated expression of genes necessary for growth and diverse stress responses.
  Depicted are exemplar transcription factors that regulate filamentous growth (BrlA,
  StuA, FlbA, CrzA), cell wall integrity (CrzA, MsnA, RlmA), adaption to carbon limitation
  (CreA) and nitrogen limitation (AreA). All pathways have critical control of filamentous
  growth, fungal morphology, and development. Gene names are taken from A. niger or
  the model organism A. nidulans. Note that extensive cross talk occurs between pathways,
  and that in this schematic not all possible membrane receptors, signalling proteins,
  or transcription factors are depicted. Interested readers are guided to excellent
  reviews which cover fungal signalling cascades in greater depth ([, ])
