caption: p38, acting downstream of cPKC, triggers endocytic internalization of the
  apical carriers presumably towards apical early endosomes (AEE), the first intracellular
  endosomal compartment receiving internalized proteins from the apical membrane,
  in a microtubule-independent manner (solid arrow). These transporters traffic to,
  and accumulate into, apical recycling endosomes (ARE), from where they can be retargeted
  to the apical membrane during the recovery of the cholestatic process, in a microtubule-dependent
  manner (dashed arrows). Activation of the PI3K/Akt/ERK1/2 signalling pathway halts
  this latter process, thus explaining the increased colocalization of Bsep/Mrp2 with
  Rab11a, an ARE marker. This prolongs the cholestatic effect of E217G by impeding
  the fast, spontaneous retargeting of intracellular transporters that would lead
  to a rapid recovery from the cholestatic injury.
