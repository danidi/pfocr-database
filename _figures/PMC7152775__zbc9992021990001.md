caption: 'Several signaling pathways affected by metabolites in the MVA pathway involved
  in the progression from NAFLD to HCC. The progression of NAFLD to HCC is classified
  into four phases: normal liver, NAFL (simple steatosis), NASH, and HCC. When NAFLD
  develops, insulin resistance occurs as PI3K-Akt is activated in the liver. Simultaneously,
  LXR-α and AMPK, sensors of metabolic state dysfunction, promote DNL and glucose
  uptake. Activation of Rac1 and Ras-FasL is involved in the development of NASH by
  promoting cirrhosis and apoptosis. Then the Ras-ERK1/2 axis mediates proliferation,
  leading to the onset of HCC. All of the above pathways are regulated by metabolites
  in the MVA pathway, and corresponding targeted therapies have been developed.'
