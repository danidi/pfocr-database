caption: Copper homeostasis and regulatory mechanisms including extra‐ and intracellular
  dissolution of pure and Fe‐doped CuO NPs. For the basal metabolism involving the
  secretory pathway, copper uptake is regulated by copper importing proteins, for
  example, CTR1. In case of elevated extracellular copper levels, CTR1 is internalized,
  while intracellular excess copper is excreted by ATPase. When overwhelmingly large
  [Cu2+] is present in the cell (case of pure CuO), the Cu‐ATPase fails to function
  (all the cells die). When it is too low (10 % Fe‐doping), the ions are easily reduced
  and transported (no effect). In the third case (6 % Fe‐doping) when the Cu2+ release
  is controlled, the complexation with the cellular constituents and the Cu2+/Cu+
  redox balance can precisely regulate the target cell apoptosis without Cu2+ diffusing
  to the normal cells. Our findings are embedded in the regulatory mechanisms of copper
  homeostasis proposed in the literature,,  see references in the figure.
