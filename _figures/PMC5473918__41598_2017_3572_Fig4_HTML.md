caption: Cascade of events involved in chitin metabolism in C. ramosus. In response
  to desiccation, C. ramosus followed the Chitin deacetylase (CDA) pathway for chitin
  degradation (step 1). Further, chitosanase generated glucosamine (step 2) which
  was utilized for restoration of the desiccated cuticle by chitin synthase (step
  3).

papertitle: High-throughput mass spectrometry analysis revealed a role for glucosamine
  in potentiating recovery following desiccation stress in Chironomus.
