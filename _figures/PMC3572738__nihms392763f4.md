caption: Cellular iron balance. A typical IRE motif consists of a hexanucleotide loop
  with the sequence 5′-CAGUGH-3′ (H could be A, C, or U) and a stem, interrupted by
  a bulge with an unpaired C residue. IREs post-transcriptional control expression
  of regulators of cellular iron metabolism in concert with IRPs. Translational-type
  IRE/IRP interactions in the 5′ UTR modulate the expression of the mRNAs encoding
  H- and L-ferritin, ALAS2, m-aconitase, ferroportin, and HIF-2α, which in turn control
  iron storage, erythroid iron utilization, energy homeostasis, iron efflux, and hypoxic
  responses, respectively. Conversely, IRE/IRP interactions in the 3′ UTR stabilize
  the mRNAs encoding TfR1, DMT1, and Cdc14A, which are involved in iron uptake, iron
  transport, and the cell cycle, respectively. Under physiological conditions, IRP1
  is regulated by a reversible ISC switch. Iron deficiency, promotes ISC disassembly
  and a conformational rearrangement, resulting in conversion of IRP1 from c-aconitase
  to an IRE-binding protein. The ISC is regenerated in iron-replete cells. Hypoxia
  favors maintenance of the ISC, while H2O2 promotes its disassembly. When the ISC
  biogenesis pathway is not operational, iron leads to ubiquitination of apo-IRP1
  by the FBXL5 E3 ligase complex (including Skp1, Cul1 and Rbx1), resulting in proteasomal
  degradation. IRP2 is stable in iron deficient and/or hypoxic cells; under these
  conditions FBXL5 undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. An increase
  in iron and oxygen levels stabilizes FBXL5 by formation of an Fe-O-Fe center in
  its hemerythrin domain, triggering the assembly of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
  together with Skp1, Cul1 and Rbx1. This complex ubiquitinates IRP2, leading to its
  recognition by the proteasome and its degradation.
