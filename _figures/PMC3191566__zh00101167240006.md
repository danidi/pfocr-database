caption: Molecular pathway by which miR-21 regulates HVSMC contraction. ANP and SNAP
  via cGMP/cGK signaling reduce the expression of miR-21, which has a feedback loop
  inhibitory effect on cGK-1. miR-21 targets (CFL-2, M-RIP, and cGK-1) and their effects
  on HVSMC contraction/relaxation are depicted. NO, nitric oxide.
