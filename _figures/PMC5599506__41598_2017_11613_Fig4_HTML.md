caption: 'Model for the effect of PEPCK and NADH on glucose metabolism. (a) Proliferating
  cells require glucose for processes including the synthesis of nucleotides (via
  the pentose-phosphate pathway), membrane lipids (via pyruvate and citrate) and energy
  (via pyruvate or the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle). Cytoplasmic NADH is produced
  in making phosphoenolpyruvate, which must be oxidised for glycolysis to continue.
  NADH can be oxidised by making lactate, but this prevents the use of pyruvate for
  lipid synthesis or energy. The glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle can oxidise NADH, but
  does so at the cost of generating elevated ROS levels. PEPCK mediates glyceroneogenesis
  (broad arrow), which uses citrate exported from mitochondria to generate glycerol-3-phosphate
  while oxidising NADH. Our model is that depletion of PEPCK decreases the levels
  of cytoplasmic NAD+ , which inhibits glycolysis unless the NAD+ can be regenerated
  by the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle. This shuttle generates reactive oxygen species,
  so its use is limited in CIN cells which are already redox stressed. The inhibitors
  used to test this model are shown with their targets. Abbreviations: DHAP: dihydroxyacetone
