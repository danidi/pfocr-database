caption: 'Genes for which a correlation with Wnt/β-catenin signaling was indicated
  by MetaCore pathway analysis. The numbers of genetic aberrations, DNA hyper- or
  hypo-methylation and/or increased or reduced mRNA expression (shown in Supporting
  Information Table ) detected among the 67 examined RCCs are indicated schematically:
  legends are shown at the left of the panel. The 36 marked genes that showed genetic
  aberration, DNA methylation alterations and/or mRNA expression alterations in one
  or more RCCs were correlated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling.'
