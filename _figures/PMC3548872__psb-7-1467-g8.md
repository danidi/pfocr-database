caption: Figure 8. Hypothetical model of ethylene and H2O2-induced stomatal closure
  responses via AHK5. The H2O2 branch of the pathway (red arrows) occurs via AHK5-
  or ETR1-activated AHP2/AHP5 signaling which leads to the activation and phosphorylation
  of ARR4, and thus resulting in stomatal closure. The stimulus which generates H2O2
  in guard cells and functions via ARR4 phosphorylation remains to be determined.
  Ethylene stimulates H2O2 production via ETR1/AHK5. Ethylene response occurs via
  AHK5-AHP1/AHP2-ARR4 pathway (blue arrows), independent of ARR4 phosphorylation or
  via ARR7. In the H2O2-independent branch (dashed lines), AHP1 or AHP3 might act
  via ARR2 which induces ARR4 transcription, followed by protein accumulation; ethylene
  signaling therefore requires ARR4 function for stomatal closure. Black arrow represents
  transcriptional control.
