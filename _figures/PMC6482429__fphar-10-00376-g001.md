caption: The molecular pathways targeted by the TCMs covered in this review are summarized.
  TGF-β receptor, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), TNF receptor, and FASL/Death receptors
  are stimulated by LPS, cisplatin, I/R, etc. These receptors are then activated by
  the downstream pathway, further triggering ROS production and an inflammatory response,
  eventually leading to kidney damage. TCMs suppress cisplatin/LPS/I/R-stimulated
  Toll-like receptors (TLR2/4), or by activating PPAR-γ, further inhibiting the NF-κB
  pathway and reducing inflammation. Additionally, apart from targeting caspase3/9,
  TCMs reduce apoptosis by inhibiting the TGF-β receptor, the ERK/JNK/P38MARK pathway
  and by promoting PI3K/AKT. In addition, TCMs inhibit autophagy by targeting inhibition
  of AMPK/mTOR. In addition to the traditional apoptosis, autophagy, programmed necrosis
  and ferroptosis are also caused during AKI. Wogonin and protocatechuic aldehyde
  can effectively inhibit RIPK1 in the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL of necroptosis. TLR2/4-mediated
  TRAF2 has a stimulant effect on RIPK3. Induction of HMGB2 by necroptosis and TLR2/4-regulated
  MyD88 aggravates the inflammatory response of acute kidney injury, while TCMs significantly
  improve this phenomenon via direct or indirect effects. Breviscapine can reduce
  ferroptosis by increasing glutathione peroxidase levels. In acute kidney injury,
  the production of ROS, the multiple roles of P53, the protective effects of eNOS,
  Nrf2, HO-1, and SIRT1/3 all become therapeutic targets of TCMs.
