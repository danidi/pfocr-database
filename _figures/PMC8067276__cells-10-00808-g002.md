caption: Major resistance mechanisms to TIL-ACT. This figure demonstrates four major
  resistance mechanisms to TIL therapy as well as strategies (highlighted in green)
  to overcome these mechanisms. Tumor cells may downregulate MHC molecules or neoantigen
  expression to avoid immune detection by neoantigen-specific T cells. Radiation therapy,
  chemotherapy, and targeted therapy are common ways to increase neoantigen generation
  and upregulate neoantigen presentation. Tumor cells and other components of the
  TME may upregulate checkpoint molecules such as PD-L1 to induce T cell exhaustion,
  a dysfunction state by which T cells cannot proliferate or secrete effector molecules.
  Exhausted T cells can regain effector function with immune checkpoint inhibitor
  treatment. Another way to bypass T cell exhaustion is by selecting for TILs that
  are less prone to exhaustion. Immunosuppressive cell types within the TME, such
  as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) or regulatory T cells (Tregs), can secrete
  factors that inhibit TIL function. These host immunosuppressive cells can be depleted
  prior to or simultaneously with adoptive cell transfer by chemotherapy or radiation
  therapy regimens as well as cell type specific inhibition. Lastly, the TME itself
  may pose barriers that exclude T cells and inhibit their migration. Experimental
  therapies that modify chemotactic and migratory pathways may restore or increase
  tumor infiltration by TILs. TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes); ACT (adoptive
  cell therapy); MHC (major histocompatibility complex); TME (tumor microenvironment);
  PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1); PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1); CTLA-4
  (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4); MDSC (myeloid-derived suppressor
  cells); Tregs (regulatory T cells).
