caption: Proposed mechanism of Th2 cell polarization by inhalation of allergen contaminated
  with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). At low levels, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces
  TNF-α production by airway structural cells, such as epithelial cells, mast cells,
  or NKT cells. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) uptake allergens, and then migrate
  to draining lymph nodes (DLN). During allergen uptake by DC, TNF-α, produced in
  response to low-level LPS, induces DC maturation, expression of costimulatory molecules,
  and upregulation of DC IL-4 expression. In DLN, mature DCs induce proliferation
  of naïve T cells (T cell priming), which subsequently differentiate into Th2 cells,
  via IL-4 and the STAT6 signaling pathway.
