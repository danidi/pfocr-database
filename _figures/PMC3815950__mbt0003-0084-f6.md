caption: 'Working model showing the proposed metabolic functions encoded by the ORFs
  of the approximately 30 kb chromosomal gene cluster (TM0055–TM0077) for the breakdown
  and utilization of acetylated glucuronoxylan by T. maritima. The ORFs which are
  proposed to encode for the individual steps of the pathway are indicated next to
  the arrows. The proposed functional assignments of the ORFs are as follows (the
  relative orientation of the ORFs is indicated with ‘+’ and ‘−’ symbols): TM0055(+),
  α‐glucuronidase (aguA); TM0056(+), ABC‐transporter periplasmic binding protein;
  TM0057(+), ABC‐transporter ATP‐binding protein; TM0058(+), ABC‐transporter ATP‐binding
  protein; TM0059(+), ABC‐transporter permease protein; TM0060(+), ABC‐transporter
  permease protein; TM0061(−), endo‐1,4‐β‐xylanase [xynA, toga‐associated and partially
  released to the extracellular medium (; )]; TM0062(−), hypothetical protein; TM0063(+),
  hypothetical protein; TM0064(+), glucuronate isomerase; TM0065(−), transcriptional
  regulator, IclR family; TM0066(−), 2‐dehydro‐3‐deoxyphosphogluconate aldolase/4‐hydroxy‐2‐oxoglutarate
  aldolase; TM0067(−), 2‐keto‐3‐deoxygluconate kinase; TM0068(−), d‐mannonate oxidoreductase;
