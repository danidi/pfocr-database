caption: 'Methylation cycle pathway: (A) Methionine and homocysteine (Hcys) are generated
  by the following enzymes: CBS = cystathionine β-synthase, MAT = methionine adenosyltransferase,
  MS = methionine synthase, SAHH = S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolasa. (B) Asymmetric
  dimethylarginine (ADMA) synthesis catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases
  (PRMT) and proteinases, and its involvement in the inhibition of nitric oxide by
  competition with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) for arginine. ADMA is degraded to citrulline
  and amines by dimethylarginine dimethylamino hydrolase (DDAH). (C) Relationship
  between the metabolic pathway from arginine to creatine, where guanidinoacetate
  acts as a methyl acceptor, and the methylation cycle. AGAT = l-arginine: glycine
  amidinotransferase, GAMT = guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase.'
