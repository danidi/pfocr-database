caption: 'TLR4 signaling cascade and evidence for modulation by neuropathic pain and
  opioids. TLR4 signaling occurs via a cascade of events. The classic TLR4 ligand
  is Gram-negative bacterial LPS (hexagon), which is transported to the cell via LPS-binding
  protein and transfers LPS to CD14 on the cell membrane. This leads to intracellular
  activation of acid sphingomyelinase, which generates ceramide. Ceramide induces
  the generation of a lipid raft containing the coreceptor MD2, TLR4, and the 70-
  and 90-kDa heat shock proteins (HSP), among other elements. Ceramide also activates
  NADPH oxidase, which leads to peroxynitrite formation. CD14 transfers LPS to MD2,
  leading to both MD2-TLR4 heterodimerization and then homodimerization of MD2-TLR4
  pairs. Recent evidence also suggests that opioids, such as morphine, can interact
  with MD2, causing a similar activation of a functional TLR4 signaling unit. Ensuing
  intracellular signaling occurs through toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing
  adaptor protein (TIRAP) to at least three parallel pathways: cell motility and cell
  survival/apoptosis occur through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway,
  and proinflammatory products such as cytokines result from activation of the NF-κB
  and MAPK pathways. The gray boxes provide summaries of the converging evidence that
  neuropathic pain and opioids interact with the TLR4 signaling cascade. IRAK, IL-1-receptor-associated
