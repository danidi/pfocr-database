caption: In this model, MALT1 protease activity, induced by the thrombin receptor
  and possibly other related GPCRs including those for histamine and LPA, cleaves
  microtubule-associated CYLD leading to microtubule instability. This serves to free
  at least two Rho GEFs which may then redistribute to the plasma membrane and associate
  with Gαq or Gα12/13 to activate RhoA. ROCK is subsequently activated and carries
  out a series of phosphorylations to promote formation of actin-myosin stress fibers.
  These stress fibers exert tension on VE-cadherins, organized into Focal Adherens
  Junctions (FAJs), to effectively disrupt the endothelial barrier. While the data
  presented here suggest that the above pathway plays a major role in the permeability
  response, it is important to note that additional, redundant pathways clearly exist
  which are similarly important.For example, microtubule stability depends not only
  on CYLD integrity, but also on a number of other microtubule binding and regulatory
  proteins including Tau, EB1, CLIP-170, MAP4, stathmin, VHL, and many others ().
  At least some of these are known to be inhibited by thrombin through mechanisms
  that are unlikely to involve MALT1. Parallel pathways for MLC phosphorylation also
  exist which do not necessarily require microtubule disruption; for example, the
  Ca2+/calmodulin dependent activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) may independently
  promote actin-myosin stress fibers (). Finally, induced permeability requires modification
  and disassembly of both tight and adherens junctions, all of which are tightly regulated
  by a host of regulatory factors (). Indeed, given the array of redundant and parallel
  pathways, it is remarkable that endothelial cells from mice harboring only a single
  codon substitution within the genome, affecting a single amino acid in the catalytic
  domain of MALT1, display such significant alterations in the endothelial permeability
  response.
