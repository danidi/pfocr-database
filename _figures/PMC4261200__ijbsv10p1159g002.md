caption: 'Synthetic metabolic pathways of flavonoids (on the left) and melanins (on
  the right). The synthesis of two antioxidant compounds starts from the same precursor
  (phenylalanine). Then, phenylalanine origins different molecules with the same biological
  functions. Flavonoid pathway are more branches compared to melanin synthesis, it
  has more enzymes and more than 9000 molecules are involved. Enzymes are reported
  with the following letter code: PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate
  4-hydroxylase; 4CL, coumarate:CoA ligase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone
  isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3b-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase; ANR, anthocyanidin reduttase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reduttase; UFGT,
  UDP-glucose flavonol-0-glucosyl transferase; PH, Phenylalanine hydroxylase; TYR,
  tyrosinase; TRYP1, tyrosinase-related protein 1; DCT, dopachrometautomerase; DOPA,
  L-3,4- dihydroxyphenylalanine; DHI, 5,6-dihydroxyindole; DHICA, indole-5,6-quinone
  carboxylic acid. In capital letters are reported theseven and the two main classes
  of flavonoids and melanins, respectively.'
