caption: a) The molecular clock.Transcription of the core clock genes Bmal1 and Clock
  (or its related gene Npas2, not shown) results in their heterodimerization in the
  cytoplasm and ensuing nuclear translocation. These helix-loop-helix transcription
  factors bind to canonical E-Box sequences (CACGTG) of clock-controlled genes (CCGs),
  driving circadian processes and their own expression. In addition, the expression
  of negative (PER and CRY) as well as positive (retinoic acid-related orphan receptor
  (ROR)) regulators of this cycle is induced. The PER/CRY complex represses binding
  of BMAL1–CLOCK to target genes, whereas ROR binding to ROR responsive elements (ROREs)
  in the Bmal1 promoter induces expression. After a period of time, the PER/CRY complex
  is degraded and BMAL1–CLOCK activates another transcription cycle. A second autoregulatory
  feedback loop is induced by transcription of REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ (encoded by Nr1d1
  and Nr1d2). The REV-ERBα–REV-ERBβ complex represses Bmal1 transcription and competes
  with ROR for binding of ROREs. While this pathway stabilizes the clock it can also
  directly drive circadian rhythms. The molecular clock does not only depend on transcriptional/translational
  feedback but is also regulated by rhythms in post-translational modifications of
  proteins such as oxidation cycles of peroxiredoxins (PRXox(idized)/PRXred(uced))
  as well as NADPH and NADH, the latter of which can modulate the binding of the BMAL1/CLOCK
  complex to DNA directly.b) Entrainment and synchronization.Circadian rhythms are
  entrained by external cues, of which light is a major contributor. Light is processed
  via the retina, leading to synchronization of rhythms in hypothalamic suprachiasmatic
  nuclei, which comprise the master clock of the organism. From here, humoral and
  neural output systems modulate clocks in peripheral tissues via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
  (HPA) axis, setting a common phase. Release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
  from the pituitary gland likely cooperates with the sympathetic nervous system (SNS)
  to regulate rhythmic release of hormones (glucocorticoids, epinephrine and norepinephrine)
  from the adrenal glands. In addition the SNS directly innervates tissues, and can
  modulate circadian rhythms locally via cyclical release of norepinephrine from nerve
  varicosities.
