caption: The innate immune response in the brain (left) is induced by meningeal damage,
  neuronal loss and axonal injury that results in substantial local release of DAMPs.
  The picture of primary brain injury comprises DAMP-induced activation of microglia
  cells and astrocytes, which generate chemokines and cytokines and ROS, as well as
  excitatory neurotransmitters (NT), and release, in an enhancing loop, additional
  DAMPs. These mechanisms can induce secondary brain injury via the recruitment and
  activation of leukocytes, which contribute not only to the clearance of damaged
  tissue but also to the progression of inflammation and the breakdown of barriers
  between cerebral compartments. Edema formation resulting from cytotoxic cell swelling,
  osmotic imbalances and impaired BBB function increases intracranial pressure (ICP)
  and decreases cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP); this leads to reduced cerebral
  blood flow (CBF) and hypoxia, which in turn cause further neuronal loss. On the
  extracerebral level (right), TBI alters a plethora of physiological processes. Inflammatory
  stimuli, together with ANS activation, can lead to systemic inflammation with deleterious
  effects. The release of brain-derived pro-coagulatory and fibrinolytic molecules
  (TF and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)) and MPs with resulting coagulatory effects,
  as well as excessive secretion of mediators and activation of leukocytes, can induce
  remote organ injury in the lungs and kidneys. Hepatic function is altered by the
  launching of an acute-phase reaction, and the gut barrier can be affected by direct
  communication via the gut-brain axis. Furthermore, modulation of immune-cell function
  and hemodynamics after TBI can occur via the release of catecholamines and glucocorticoid
  by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPAA) and the generation of inducible
  nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) by neutrophils. Splenic atrophy can result from the
  activation and population expansion of lymphocytes and their extravasation into
  the circulation. Finally, the systemic cellular defense mechanisms are modulated
  by TBI by an increased number of circulating leukocytes with enhanced production
  of ROS and prolonged survival, but with reduced phagocytic activity, and by a functional
  shift from a pro-inflammatory phenotype to an anti-inflammatory phenotype in circulating
  monocytes. Progr., progressive; SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome; AKI,
  acute kidney injury; Sympath, sympathetic ; CAP, cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway;
  GBB, gut-blood barrier; I, primary injury; II, secondary injury.
