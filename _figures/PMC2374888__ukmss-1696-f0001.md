caption: Enzymes of the cholesterol synthesis pathway regulated by SREBP-2. Enzymes
  written in blue were found to be down-regulated in cortical neurons by treatment
  with 24S-hydroxycholesterol. The EC number is given for these enzymes. Some enzymes
  have multiple names as indicated in the figure. Farnesyl-PP represents a branch
  point between cholesterol synthesis and that of non-steroidal isoprenoids. Formation
  of geranylgeranyl-PP (indicated by the red arrow) by farnesyltranstransferase (EC
  2.5.1.29) leads to the further formation of geranylgeraniol, polyprenols, dolichols
  and ubiquinone.
