caption: The interaction between NAD+ and ATP during Wallerian degeneration. (A) Increase
  of the AMP/ATP ration indicates low cellular energy level, and would induce the
  activation of AMPKK, which would further catalyze the phosphorylation of AMPK. (B)
  NAD+ is required for ATP generation, while ATP is one substrate of NAD synthesis
  from nicotinamide. (C) the proposed molecular pathway participated in axon degeneration.
