caption: Classical degradative autophagy (macroautophagy). The autophagy-related gene
  (ATG) conjugation systems (LC3-PE and ATG12–ATG5) are important for degrading the
  inner autophagosomal membrane. Phagophore elongation involves two ubiquitin-like
  conjugation systems (LC3-PE and ATG12–ATG5 conjugation). ATG7 and ATG10 operate
  sequentially to catalyze the formation of ATG12–ATG5:ATG16L1 complexes. ATG4, ATG7,
  and ATG3 cooperate to cleave the precursors of LC3-like proteins into their mature
  forms, followed by conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and recruitment
  to autophagosomes forming with the support of WD-repeat protein interacting with
  phosphoinositide (WIPI) proteins. LC3 and LC3 homologs enable autophagosomes with
  the ability to bind autophagic substrates including p62 for ubiquitinated cargo
  []. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)C1 amino-acid-sensing pathway. V-ATPase
  triggers the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity of Rag small GTP-binding
  protein in an amino-acid-dependent manner, which is followed by the recruitment
  of mTOR to lysosomal membranes. Upon its localization to the lysosome, mTORC1 kinase
  is activated by the small GTP-binding protein Rheb, which receives input from growth
  factor signaling. The lysosome is responsible for recycling amino acids and cellular
  components via degradation of proteins and other macromolecules, although acidification
  of the lysosomal lumen is dispensable for mTORC1 signaling.
