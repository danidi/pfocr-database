caption: Overview of Hippo signaling immunomodulatory functions. Hippo pathway components
  participate in a number of both canonical and non-canonical signaling mechanisms
  that regulate, or are regulated by, immune responses and immune challenges. (1)
  Through TLR signaling, different stimuli have been shown to trigger different signal
  transduction cascades. Gram-positive bacteria have been shown to suppress YAP/TAZ
  transcriptional activity, which upregulates NFkB transcriptional activity through
  IkB/cactus and expression of antimicrobial proteins. On the other hand, Mycobcterium
  tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis is associated with non-canonical MST1-IRF3 signaling
  to induce an antipathogenic response, independent of LATS1/2 and YAP/TAZ. (2) Inflammation
  as a result of insults (myocardial infarction, neuronal polyglutamine aggregates,
  or ischemia) can upregulate YAP/TAZ signaling through a number of mechanisms that
  are involved in augmenting tissue repair and mitigating deleterious cytotoxic inflammation.
  (3) Viral infection (herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), Sendai virus (SeV), vesicular
  stomatitis virus (VSV)) has been associated with both inducing and suppressing antiviral
  immunity. This mechanism involves suppression of IRF3 signaling by non-canonical
  MST1 function to dampen type I interferon response, or phosphorylation at Ser403
  and degradation of YAP2/4 to relieve YAP-mediated suppression of antiviral response.
  (4) Salmonella infection has been shown to induce inflammasome assembly through
  NLRC4 in macrophages. In B cells however, Salmonella infection inhibits YAP/TAZ
  transcriptional activity, therefore reducing expression of Nod-like receptor C4
  (NLRC4) and inhibiting pyroptosis, ultimately enhancing Salmonella survival within
  B cells. (5) SETD7 suppresses YAP/TAZ function in the midgut. Parasitic infection
  by helminths has been shown to reduce SETD7 expression, thereby relieving YAP/TAZ
  inhibition and accelerating enterocyte/enteroblast proliferation to enhance helminthic
  clearance. Solid lines represent direct interactions. Dotted lines represent mechanisms
  that are indirect or have not been fully delineated.
