caption: 'The kynurenine pathway enzyme IDO plays a central role in testicular immune
  privilege.Notes: IDO expression by Sertoli cells and by macrophages contributes
  to testicular immune privilege, resulting in tolerance to spermatozoa and to infectious
  agents. Tissue-resident macrophages express several immunosuppressive molecules,
  including IDO, arginase-1, IL-10, and TGF-β, which may further induce the production
  of Treg cells. The BTB plays an important role in the trafficking of immune cells
  and in the transport of drugs into the testes. The BTB is a physical barrier between
  the blood or lymph vessels and the lumen of the seminiferous tubules of the testis.Abbreviations:
  ATP, adenosine triphosphate; BTB, blood–testis barrier; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase;
  IL-10, interleukin-10; TGF-β, transforming growth factor beta; Treg, regulatory
  T cell.'
