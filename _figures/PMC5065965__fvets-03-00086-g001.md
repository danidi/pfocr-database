caption: The classic endogenous miRNA pathway and mechanisms of action. In the nucleus,
  pri-miRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and further processed by the Drosha
  enzyme to produce pre-miRNA, which is then transported into the cytoplasm. There
  it is cleaved by the Dicer enzyme into the miRNA duplex. The guide strand is uploaded
  onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to regulate gene expression by causing
  either target mRNA degradation or translation repression. Cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttle
  is possible for some miRNAs (e.g., miR-29b, miR-320, and miR-373). Adapted from
