caption: Diagram  showing signal pathways for EGFR transactivation in response to
  3 mM NH4Cl.  Ammonium acts on the Na,K-ATPase to activate both its activity and
  Na,K-ATPase/ouabain  signalling. The latter proceeds via Src to the EGF receptor
  (EGFR). We  have previously shown that this occurs via MEK and therefore probably  also
  via Ras and Raf [70]. We now have shown that also AKT needs to be  activated upstream
  of ERK, but where this occurs in relation to Ras and Raf is  not known with certainty.
  We have also previously shown that ERK phosphorylation  can lead to NKCC1 activation,
  but not determined the intermediate steps [47].  The swelling caused by 3 mM ammonium
  is delayed, beginning after 12 hr, a delay  caused by the requirement for ROS and
  its action on NKCC1. Since we have shown  that ROS does not operate directly via
  the EGF receptor it is suggested  that ouabain-mediated ROS stimulation, confirmed
  in the present study, in a  feed-forward reaction re-inforces the effect of ouabain,
  as suggested by Liu  et al. [46]. Literature evidence suggests that higher concentrations
  of  ammonium may also act directly on NKCC1. Such concentrations are generally not  encountered
  in hepatic encephalopathy, but occur in other hypeammonemic  conditions.From Dai
  et al. [13].
