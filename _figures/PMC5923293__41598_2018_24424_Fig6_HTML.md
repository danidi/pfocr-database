caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of miR-152-3p-target interactions in prostate
  cancer signalling. Prostate cancer signalling was among the top ten canonical pathways
  consisting of eight deregulated miR-152-3p target genes (highlighted in purple)
  i.e. FGFR3, IRS1, SOS2, HSP90AA1, KRAS, CDKN1B, CCND1 and PTEN where FGFR3 and IRS1
  are closely related to PI3K and hence shown as a group. Some of the targets for
  e.g. HSP90, KRAS and SOS exist as a complex or group of genes. The p value was represented
  as −log p = 5.57 for the analysis.
