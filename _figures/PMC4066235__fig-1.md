caption: miRNA biogenesis and radiation response. miRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus
  by RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) generating a primary miRNA transcript (pri-miR).
  DROSHA and Pasha cleave the pri-miR into the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) hairpin.
  As a hairpin, Exportin 5 exports the pre-miRNA into the cytoplasm, where it is further
  cleaved by an enzyme called Dicer and its binding partner TRBP/PACT. This final
  cleavage step results in a duplex RNA structure. The mature miRNA is separated from
  the passenger strand and loaded into the RISC. Along with RISC, the miRNA binds
  to the 3′ UTR of a target gene and mediates translational repression, or in some
  cases, mRNA degradation. In response to IR, miRNA expression is dysregulated. Although
  it remains to be proved, it seems likely that IR will result in modification of
  the biogenesis pathway. Importantly, when AGO2 and Dicer are repressed, the DDR
  is inhibited (). DDR, DNA damage response; IR, ionizing radiation; miRNA, microRNA;
  RISC, RNA-induced silencing complex; AGO2, Argonaute-2.
