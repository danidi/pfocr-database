caption: Glucose promotes EMTs in BC by regulating the functions of YAP1 and TAZ.
  A, High‐glucose levels promoted the activity of the Hippo signalling pathway in
  BC cells, an effect inhibited by MET. B, Under high‐glucose conditions, YAP1 and
  TAZ levels increased markedly, while pYAP1 levels decreased. This suggests that
  large amounts of YAP1 and TAZ are translocated into the nucleus where they enhance
  TEAD‐mediated transcription and perform their functions. C, EMTs were more common
  and GLUT1 levels were up‐regulated in BC cell lines, facilitating their invasion
  and proliferation
