caption: Summary of leptin's roles in the endocardial cushion. The spatiotemporal
  pattern of leptin and leptin receptor depicts a pathway by which myocardial-derived
  leptin ligand engages with endocardial leptin receptors to drive EMT and migration,
  which is consistent with the known cell-autonomous pathway of cardiac EMT. In an
  ex vivo functional assay, loss of leptin abrogates adhesion, EMT, cell survival,
  and migration, potentially via Akt. The leptin pathway is independent of the TGF-β/Snail-driven
  dissolution of VE-cadherin. Interestingly, the specific effector molecules disrupted
  by loss of leptin in the endocardial cushion are known mediators of adhesion, migration,
  and differentiation. Leptin's role in adhesion of endocardial cells may occur through
  αvβ3 integrin receptor, whereas leptin-driven proteolytic activity and invasion
  of mesenchymal cells may be mediated by MMP2. Furthermore, MMPs modulate growth
  factor release and receptor availability and may affect morphogen gradients across
  the cardiac jelly and, thus, signaling cascades. The potential branch points in
  the leptin signaling pathway and cross talks with other pathways remain to be uncovered.
  Ultimately, leptin signaling affects adhesion, EMT, cell survival, and migration
  within the embryonic heart.
