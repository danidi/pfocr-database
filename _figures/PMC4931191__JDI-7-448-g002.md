caption: 'Relationships between longevity genes affected by the diabetic milieu. Blue:
  positive effectors for longevity. Red: negative effectors for longevity. Black:
  key regulators. Green arrow: positive effect. Red arrow: negative effect. Purple:
  changed in diabetes. Physiological stresses (exercise and starvation) under normal
  circadian rhythm activate adenosine monophosphate‐activated protein kinase (AMPK),
  sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), CLOCK, and forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) to increase catalase and superoxide
  dismutase 2, mitochondrial (SOD2) as an adaptive response. SIRT1 also maintains
  healthy mitochondria function and mass by increasing auto(mito)phagy through suppression
  of mechanistic target of rapamycin and controlling oxidant production through suppression
  of p66Shc. AMPK and SIRT1 suppress pro‐inflammatory signaling through nuclear factor
  (NF)‐κB by reducing transcriptional activation and de‐acetylation of RelA. Physiologically,
  SIRT1 de‐acetylates substrate proteins by consuming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  (NAD+) to produce nicotinamide (NAM). This can be regulated by NAD+synthesis by
  CLOCK and energy‐sensing AMPK activity. NAD+ is also consumed by the deoxyribonucleic
  acid (DNA) repair enzyme poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) that produces NAM, a
  physiological inhibitor of SIRT1. SIRT1 positively regulates AMPK through liver
  kinase B1 (LKB1) and CLOCK activity. The diabetic milieu increases the production
  of cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), diacylglycerol (DAG) and
  ceramide. These molecules suppress AMPK and possibly SIRT1. High nutritional conditions
  along with physical inactivity and problems in circadian rhythm induce a cascade
  of events that is observed in diabetes. First, suppression of FOXO3 activity leads
  to a failure to induce anti‐oxidant enzymes. This, in addition to activation of
  p66Shc by protein kinase C (PKC)‐β, leads to oxidative stress. DNA damage caused
  by oxidative stress activates PARP, and increases NAD+ catabolism and production
  of NAM that further decreases SIRT1 and AMPK activity. Decline of the activities
  of AMPK and SIRT1 decreases NAD+synthesis. Oxidative stress and reduced activities
  of SIRT1 and AMPK favor NF‐κB activation. Reduction of autophagy or mitophagy induces
  endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial biogenesis
  is inhibited by reduction of AMPK activity. When mitochondrial damage is strong
  enough, cells cannot maintain adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels for synthesis
  of NAD+ from a substrate derived from the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), further
  decreasing SIRT1 activity. ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
