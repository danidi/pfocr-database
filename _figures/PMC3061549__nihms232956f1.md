caption: The classical and alternative selection pathways in the thymus. (a) Classical
  thymic selection. During thymic differentiation, thymocytes will undergo positive
  and negative selection and generate naive conventional T cells that reach the periphery
  and further differentiate in response to encounter with cognate non-self antigen.
  Nevertheless, some of these conventional effector T cells may have escaped negative
  selection and might respond to self antigen during inflammation. This model is called
  ‘recessive tolerance’. DN, double-negative; DP, double-positive; CTL, cytotoxic
  T lymphocyte. (b) Agonist-driven thymic selection. In addition to development by
  the conventional positive selection pathway in a, specialized T cell subsets develop
  from thymocytes that bind with high avidity to self antigens in the thymus; these
  cells leave the thymus as antigen-experienced T cells. This agonist-driven selection
  process diverts cells into a variety of subsets, such as Foxp3+ nTreg cells, double-negative
  TCRαβ+ cells, CD8αα+ TcRαβ+ IELs, invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) and the
  newly identified nTH-17 cells. This model is referred to as ‘dominant tolerance’.
