caption: Angiopoietin-2-mediated vascular sprouting in hepatocellular carcinoma. Vascular
  remodeling is crucial for the growth and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC) [,]. The formation of new blood vessels is induced by the angiogenic switch,
  which implies an intratumoral balance shift in favor of proangiogenic factors, including
  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin (Ang)-2 [,,,]. Overexpression
  of Ang-2 may be mediated by hypoxia [], VEGF overexpression [], cyclooxygenase (COX)-2
  overexpression [] and AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A (Arid1a)
  deficiency [], among others, and alters the quantitative balance between Ang-1 and
  Ang-2 expression in favor of Ang-2 []. Subsequent interaction with its receptor,
  tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin (Ig) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) homology
  domains 2 (Tie2), which are predominantly expressed on the surface of endothelial
  cells, result in vessel destabilization and, thereby, facilitates other proangiogenic
  factors, including VEGF, to induce vascular sprouting [,]. Ang-2 is thus dependent
  on VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) signaling to exert its effect on HCC angiogenesis
  and progression []. Despite the complexity of Ang-2-mediated HCC neovascularization,
  Ang-2 could potentially serve as a circulating or tissue biomarker for HCC, and
