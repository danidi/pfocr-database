caption: Model of receptor activation by IFN-α2 versus IFN-β and signaling outcomes
  The model is based on reported in vitro parameters of binary and ternary complex
  assembly (see references in text) and on the present cell-based analyses. The left
  panel shows that a short-lived ternary complex composed of IFN-α2, IFNAR2 (gray),
  and IFNAR1 (black) is fully fit to activate the Jak/Stat pathway, induce ISG expression,
  block cells in S phase, and induce a low level of apoptosis. Under the condition
  of a nonlimiting receptor, the rapidly dissociating ternary complexes release IFN-α2,
  which serially engages unoccupied receptors. This will amplify Jak/Stat activation
  and downstream events, leading to increased apoptosis. In other terms, in this model,
  the effect of IFN-α2 is not proportional to the number of occupied receptors but
  to the number of IFN-receptor associations per unit of time. In opposition, as illustrated
  in the right panel, the slowly dissociating IFN-β forms a more stable ternary complex
  than IFN-α2, which translates in a single quantum of Jak/Stat activation. However,
  it is predicted that the stable IFN-β-receptor complexes activate additional proapoptotic
  signals which determine the more potent antigrowth effect of IFN-β measured in cells
  with low-density receptors. The model could accommodate other IFN subtypes, whose
  competence to form a tight ternary complex may vary.
