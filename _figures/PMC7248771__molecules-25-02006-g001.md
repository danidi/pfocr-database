  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (EC 4.3.1.24); TAL, tyrosine ammonia lyase (EC
  4.3.1.23); C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.14.91); ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase
  (EC 6.4.1.2); 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.12); CHS, chalcone synthase
  (EC 2.3.1.74); STS, stilbene synthase (EC 2.3.1.95); CHI, chalcone isomerase (EC
  5.5.1.6); F3′H, flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase (EC 1.14.13.21); F3′5′H, flavonoid 3´5´-hydroxylase
  (EC 1.14.13.88); FNS, flavones synthase (EC 1.14.11.22); F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase
  (EC 1.14.11.9); DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (EC 1.1.1.219); ANS, anthocyanidin
  synthase (EC 1.14.20.4); LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase (EC 1.17.1.3); ANR, anthocyanidin
  reductase (EC 1.3.1.112); UFGT, UDP-glucose:flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase (EC
  2.4.1.115); GST, glutathione S-transferase (EC EC 2.5.1.18); MATE, multidrug and
  toxic compound extrusion transporter; ABC, ATP-binding cassette transporter. Phenylalanine
  is deaminated by PAL to form trans-cinnamic acid that is further converted into
  para-coumaric acid by C4H. Para-coumaric acid is conjugated with coenzyme A by the
  enzyme 4CL to obtain para-coumaroyl-CoA. The latter is condensed with three molecules
  of malonyl-CoA by CHS to generated naringenin chalcone. Subsequently, CHI stereospecifically
  converts the chalcone to its isomer naringenin. The B ring of naringenin is hydroxylated
  by F3´H or F3´5´H to produce eriodyctiol or penthahydroxy-flavanone. The (2S)-flavanones
  are next subjected to modification by the conversion of F3H into dihydroflavonols
  (dihydroquercetin, dihydrokaempferol and dihydromyricetin). Dihydrokaempferol could
  be directly oxidized by F3´H and F3´5´H to dihydroquercetin and dihydromyricetin.
  The obtained dihydroflavonols are reduced to colorless leucoanthocyanidins by DFR,
  which are then oxidized to colored anthocyanidins by the activity of ANS (synonyms
  leucocyanidin oxygenase: LDOX). Further, glycosylation is performed by UFGT, which
  occurs in the cytoplasm and produces chemically stable water-soluble pigments.'
