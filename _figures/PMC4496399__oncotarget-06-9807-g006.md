caption: Lestaurtinib inhibits the kinase activity of TrkA and phospho-TrkA-dependent
  downstream signaling including Akt. However, a phospho-TrkA-independent pathway
  that uses CD44 signaling may serve as an alternative pathway to strengthen tumor
  aggressiveness and to escape lestaurtinib inhibition.
