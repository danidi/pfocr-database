caption: The role of mTOR in CD4+ T cell differentiation. A series of genetic studies
  has revealed a central role for mTOR in regulating T helper cell differentiation.
  T cells lacking RHEB, and hence mTORC1 signaling, fail to differentiate into Th1
  and Th17 cells under polarizing conditions. This failure to differentiate is associated
  with decreased STAT activation and decreased expression of lineage-specific transcription
  factors such as T-bet and RORγt. Similarly, T cells lacking RICTOR and mTORC2 activity
  demonstrate decreased STAT6 activation, decreased PKC activity, and decreased GATA-3
  expression and thus fail to differentiate into Th2 cells under polarizing conditions.
  T cells lacking mTOR demonstrate increased SMAD3 activation and become Foxp3+ Tregs
  even under normally activating conditions. Black lines indicate the ability of mTOR
  to activate a pathway, and red lines indicate the ability of mTOR to inhibit a pathway.
