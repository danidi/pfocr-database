caption: Muscle glycogen synthesis pathway. GT, divided between an active membrane
  fraction and an inactive vesicle fraction, moves plasma glucose into the cytoplasm
  where it is phosphorylated by HK into G6P. Isomerized G6P can serve as the substrate
  for phosphofructo-kinase (PFK), the entry point into glycolysis. However, under
  conditions favoring glycogen synthesis, a majority of G6P is converted by phosphoglucomutase
  (PGM) and UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDP-GPP) into UDP-glucose. UDP-glucose
  is the substrate for GSase, which is ultimately responsible for making glycogen.
  The pathway is regulated by downstream insulin-induced effects in at least two locations.
  First, insulin is the primary determinant of the distribution of GT between membrane
  and vesicles. Second, insulin affects GSase velocity and allosteric responsiveness
  by way of phosphorylation. Additionally, G6P can induce its own consumption by allosterically
  stimulating GSase. The lower section of the diagram indicates the distribution of
  the glycogen synthetic enzymes into subsystems A and B.
