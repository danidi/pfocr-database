caption: 'Pathway map of fatty acid metabolism. The map is compartmentalized (cytoplasm,
  peroxisome, mitochondrium and nucleus) and composed from three layers: the regulation
  layer on the right, which contains the TFs (light green rectangles) and the signals
  (green and purple ellipses for metabolites and conditions, respectively) that govern
  the transcription of genes (yellow rectangles) to their corresponding transcripts
  (green rhomboids) in the middle. The metabolic layer on the left depicts the translated
  enzymes (light green rectangles) that catalyze the interconversion of substrates
  and products (green ellipses), some of which are needed or produced from other subprocesses
  (blue hexagons) of the diauxic shift.'
