caption: Ras mitogenic signaling. (A) Schematic representation of the currently accepted
  model. (B) Schematic representation of the updated model incorporating our recent
  results and demonstrating the essential role of the p53/p21Cip1 axis in Ras mitogenic
  signaling. (Left) Wild type cells, (Right) Rasless cells. (C) Knockdown/inactivation
  of the p53/p21Cip1/Rb axis induces retroactivation of the MAPK pathway in a Ras-independent
  manner. (Left) Schematic representation of the Ras signaling pathway illustrating
  that Rasless cells can proliferate in the absence of p53 as a result of retroactivation
  of the Raf/Mek/Erk signaling cascade. Similar results were observed in Rasless cells
  lacking p21 and Rb tumor suppressors (see text). (Right) Unlike Rasless cells, cells
  lacking Raf kinases (Rafless cells), Mek kinases (Mekless cells), or Erk kinases
  (Erkless cells) cannot proliferate in the absence of the p53/p21Cip1/Rb axis. Blue
  arrows indicate variation in expression levels. Red spikes indicate activated proteins.
  X indicates that the corresponding protein has been genetically ablated. Ac, acetylated
  lysine residues; P, phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues; Cyc, cyclins; Cdk, cyclin-dependent
  kinases; Rb, retinoblastoma protein; G1, gap 1 phase; S, S phase of the cell cycle.
  The dotted line indicates that we do not have experimental evidence for the existence
  of the retroactivating circuitry observed in Rasless cells in Rafless, Mekless,
  or Erkless cells. The represented active state of the E2F transcription factors
  has not been determined experimentally but is deduced from the inactive state of
  the Rb protein.
