caption: 'Competition between double-strand break repair pathways. DNA double-strand
  breaks (DSBs) are repaired by two distinct pathways, homologous recombination (HR)
  and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR is initiated by 5′ to 3′ end resection,
  forming a 3′ single-stranded tail onto which Rad51 assembles. The Rad51 nucleoprotein
  filament allows single-strand DNA invasion into a homologous duplex, typically the
  sister chromatid, to initiate repair synthesis. The newly synthesized strand is
  then displaced to anneal to the other DNA end (not shown) to complete the HR reaction.
  When a DSB and subsequent end resection occurs at sequence repeats (green lines),
  an alternative pathway, single-strand annealing (SSA), can take place. The complementary
  single strands at the repeats can anneal, giving rise to a copy number variant,
  in this case a product with a single copy of the repeat and a deletion of the intervening
  sequence. NHEJ involves the joining of DNA ends with no or little homology (microhomology).
  In this pathway, the Ku heterodimer binds to DNA ends, protecting them from end
  resection. A number of processing factors are subsequently recruited (not shown),
  which allows a variety of end structures to be joined. Mutational analysis has demonstrated
  that factors involved in HR and NHEJ likely directly “compete” at steps indicated
  by the numbers: (1) loss of canonical NHEJ factors (Ku, DNA ligase IV/XRCC4) leads
  to increased end resection and hence HR and SSA. (2) End resection mutants (e.g.,
  Sae2) have increased NHEJ. (3) Disruption of Rad51 filament formation allows DNA
  ends to be channeled into SSA.'
