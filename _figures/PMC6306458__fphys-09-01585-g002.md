caption: Regulation of CFTR by the intracellular Ca2+. Although CFTR is mainly considered
  as a cAMP regulated ion channel, several observations suggest that the intracellular
  Ca2+ can regulate CFTR activity by a complex mechanism. First of all, Ca2+ can increase
  the activity of several adenylyl cyclase (AC) isoform increasing the production
  of cAMP. In another suggested pathway Ca2+ activates CFTR, at least in part, through
  activation of the Pyk2/Src complex and tyrosine phosphorylation. Very recently Bozoky
  et al. showed that CFTR and calmodulin colocalize at the apical membrane of primary
  cells and that calmodulin interacts directly with the R domain of CFTR in a Ca2+-
  and phosphorylation-dependent manner. This interaction triggered an open probability
  of CFTR, which was similar to that due to PKA phosphorylation.
