caption: Schematic representation of PIN2 trafficking as regulated by the ‘non-genomic’
  auxin pathway and GOLVEN peptides. Note that RLKs are likely involved in both pathways
  but have yet to be identified. Arrows with chevron-shaped arrowhead represent trafficking
  pathways and arrows with triangle-shaped arrowhead represent signalling events;
  blunt-ended lines represent inhibition.
