caption: 'COX and 5-LO pathway in the metabolism of PGE2 and pLT for in vitro diagnosis
  of NSAID-triggered hypersensitivity. Simplified pictogram of eicosanoid pathways
  in the metabolism PGE2 and leukotrienes implicated for in vitro diagnosis of NSAID-triggered
  hypersensitivity. AA is enzymatically cleaved by calcium-dependent PLA2 from phospholipids
  (predominantly) or from DAG (minor amounts). AA is metabolised by the COX-pathway
  or 5-LO pathway (but also by several other pathways not figured out here). COXs
  generate PGH2, which is further processed by PGE-synthase forming PGE2 (other PGH2
  metabolising pathways not mentioned here). PGE2 binds to EP subtypes of which EP2
  and EP4 generate cAMP for signalling cascade. cAMP in turn causes negative feedback
  on the 5-LO pathway. AA is also metabolised by the 5-LO pathway (in part assisted
  by FLAP) generating LTA4. LTA4 is further processed by calcium-dependent LTA4-synthase
  forming amino acids bearing LTC4, which is exported and extracellularly metabolised
  by enzymes forming LTD4 and LTE4, collectively named pLTs All three LTs bind to
  cysLTs or GPR17 with differential selectivity. 5-LO: 5-lipoxygenase, AA: arachidonic
  acid, ASA: acetylsalicylic acid, cAMP: cyclic-adenosine monophosphate; cysLT: receptor
  of pLT, DAG: diacylglycerole, COX: cyclooxygenase, EP: PGE-receptor,GPR17: orphan
  receptor, binding pLT and nucleotides, HPETE: hydroxyperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid,
  HETE: hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid, NSAID: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
  PLA2: phospholipase A2, PG: prostaglandin, pLT: peptidoleukotrienes.'
