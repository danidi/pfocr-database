caption: There are two different ways of blocking the PD-1 pathway. By blocking PD-L1,
  the antibody blocks the binding of PD-L1 to its known receptors, PD-1 and B7.1.
  However, the antibody does not block the binding of PD-1 to its other ligand PD-L2.
  Alternatively by blocking PD-1, an anti–PD-1antibody blocks the binding of PD-1
  to both of its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. However, the anti–PD-1antibodies do not
  block the binding of PD-L1 to B7.1. These differences in blockade may or may not
  be clinically relevant. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy and possible
  toxicity differences in these two ways of blocking the same pathway.
