caption: The pivotal role of Mediator complex in the ABA signaling pathway. ABA is
  perceived by its receptors PYL/RCARs, which promotes the interaction between PP2Cs
  (negative regulators of the ABA signaling pathway) and PYLs, hence releasing the
  positive regulators SnRK2s to activate ABA downstream signaling events. Additionally,
  RAFs can directly phosphorylate SnRK2s for the activation of SnRK2s, which subsequently
  interact with and phosphorylate several downstream TFs including ABFs, ABI5 and
  RAP2.6 to transduce the ABA signals. Mediator subunits of CDK8, MED25, and MED18
  relay the signals from TFs RAP2.6, ABI5, and ABI4, respectively, and help recruit
  the RNA Pol II to the TFs-targeted promoters of ABA-responsive genes, thereby promoting
  the transcription of ABA-responsive genes.
