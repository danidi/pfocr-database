caption: Overview of Notch signaling. A, Notch signaling occurs between neighboring
  cells, in which interactions on the cell surface between a Notch receptor and a
  DSL ligand result in cleavage of Notch and release of its intracellular domain (NICD),
  which subsequently transits to the nucleus. B, in the absence of a Notch signal,
  CSL can bind corepressors, such as RITA, to repress transcription from Notch target
  genes. RITA binding to CSL can also cause CSL to be exported out of the nucleus.
  Upon activation of the Notch signaling pathway, NICD and MAM (Mastermind) form a
  ternary complex with CSL that activates transcription from Notch target genes. C,
  structure of the CSL·NICD·MAM ternary complex bound to DNA (PDB entry 2FO1). The
  structural core of CSL is composed of three domains (NTD, BTD, and CTD), which are
  colored cyan, green, and orange, respectively. A β-strand that makes hydrogen-bonding
  interactions with all three domains is colored magenta. The RAM and ANK domains
  of NICD are colored red and yellow, respectively. MAM and DNA are colored gray.
  D, domain schematics are colored similarly to the structure.
