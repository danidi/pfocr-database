caption: ATP metabolism and synthesis via the cytosolic purine salvage pathway. Under
  conditions of energy depletion, ATP is metabolized to adenosine (Ado), inosine (Ino),
  hypoxanthine (HX) and xanthine (X), which can, via equilibrative transporters, leave
  cells and enter the bloodstream. Direct cellular release of ATP and subsequent extracellular
  metabolism by ectonucleotidases (not shown) provides another source of extracellular
  adenosine and purine loss to the bloodstream. Purine salvage (green arrows) restores
  adenine nucleotide levels via adenine phosphoribosyl‐transferase (APRT, EC 2.4.2.7;
  adenine to AMP) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl‐transferase (HPRT, EC 2.4.2.8; hypoxanthine
  to inosine monophosphate, IMP). This reaction requires 5‐phosphoribosyl‐1‐pyrophosphate
  (PRPP), a product of the pentose phosphate pathway that gives rise to ribose‐5‐phosphate,
  which can also arise from the isomerization of inosine‐derived ribose‐1‐phosphate
  (Rib‐1‐P) by phosphopentomutase (EC 5.4.2.7), and the action of ribokinase (EC 2.7.1.15)
  on D‐ribose. Creatine can be converted to phosphocreatine (PCr), which acts as a
  phosphate donor to ADP to regenerate ATP, thus buffering ATP levels and preventing
  accumulation of ATP metabolites. 1, ATPases; 2, adenylate kinase (EC 2.7.4.3); 3,
