caption: TDP-1 has multiple contributions to lifespan and the cellular stress response.
  (A) Under normal conditions TDP-1 may function in the Insulin/IGFP pathway upstream
  from DAF-16 to regulate lifespan. (B) A variety of cellular stresses induce TDP-1
  expression. TDP-1 induction by oxidative stress and/or the Insulin/IGF pathway is
  dependent on DAF-16, while induction by osmotic stress is independent of DAF-16.
  Misfolded proteins activate the unfolded protein response and a secondary consequence
  of this is the generation of oxidative stress that in turn can induce TDP-1 expression
  via DAF-16. The downstream consequences of tdp-1 expression are dependent on the
  length and strength of induction. tdp-1 mutants are sensitive to stress suggesting
  that TDP-1 is essential for protection against acute stress. Genetically encoded
  proteotoxicity from proteins like mutant TDP-43 leads to chronic induction of TDP-1
  expression with negative consequences including enhanced neurodegeneration. This
  model also suggests that mutant proteins may act as a seed for the induction of
  pathological TDP-1 expression.
