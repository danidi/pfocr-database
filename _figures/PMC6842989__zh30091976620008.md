caption: Working model of digoxin inhibited liver injury in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
  (NASH). The cell metabolic stress generated from high-fat diet (HFD) intake in the
  mouse triggers pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activation that can occur partially via
  metabolites like succinate. In addition to its pyruvate kinase function, PKM2 interacts
  with hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional
  coactivator for HIF-1α, resulting in stimulation of HIF-1α-responsive genes. We
  have previously shown that chronic metabolic stress triggers cAMP pathway activation,
  which results in HIF-1α transactivation leading sustained IL-1β gene expression
  and inflammasome activation, and digoxin reduces this pathway-driven sustained inflammation.
  Thus, digoxin has the ability to improve nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic
  fatty liver disease (NASH) through the inhibition of PKM2-HIF1α pathway that targets
  both oxidative stress and proinflammatory gene expression. Labels and arrows highlighted
  in red indicate the new findings from our work.
