caption: Interaction networks of the identified circadian-regulated phosphoproteins.
  Network mapping performed by the STRING protein interaction algorithm based on the
  STRING database (). A, Photosynthesis. B, Ribosomal proteins network. C, Circadian
  regulated. D, ABA pathway. E, Chaperones. F, Nitrogen metabolism. Proteins lacking
  interactions were removed from this display. Line colors indicate the types of evidence
  for each association.
