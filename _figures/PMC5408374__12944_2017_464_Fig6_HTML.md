caption: Mechanisms of NAMPT protecting liver from high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis.
  NAMPT promotes the production of NAD+ by activating the NAD+ salvage pathway and
  in turn, the increased NAD+ as a substrate activates Sirt1 signaling pathways, alleviating
  high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in mice. On the one hand, the activation
  of Sirt1 promotes the deacetylation of SREBP1 in which the inhibition of SREBP1
  activity finally results in inhibitions of the expressions of lipogenesis genes
  including FASN and ACC. On the other hand, Sirt1 directly activates AMPKα which
  further inhibits SREBP1 activities
