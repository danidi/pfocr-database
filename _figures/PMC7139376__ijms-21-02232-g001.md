caption: Schema outlining the light and circadian signaling pathway in pregnancy.
  The retinohypothalamic tract transmits light from the eyes to the suprachiasmatic
  nucleus (SCN). In the pineal gland, melatonin synthesis follows a rhythm driven
  by the SCN. Melatonin has pleiotropic biological function whereby it regulates pregnancy
  and fetal development. The SCN also stimulates the release of glucocorticoids (GCs)
  in the adrenal gland in a light-dependent manner. GC signaling is crucial for fetal
  development. The circadian clock system consists of central and peripheral clocks,
  which are coordinated to produce daily rhythms. The molecular mechanisms responsible
  for the generation of the rhythmicity within the SCN and peripheral clocks are regulated
  by interactive transcriptional–translational feedback loops between the clock genes,
  including Per1, Per1, Cry1, Cry2, CLOCK, BMAL1, Rev-erbα, and CK1ε, and their protein
  products. The cellular circadian clock consists of positive and negative interlinked
  regulatory limbs. CLOCK and BMAL1 form a heterodimer that positively activates the
  rhythmic expression of Per, Cry, and Rev-erbα genes. The negative limb includes
  the PER and CRY proteins. After nuclear translocation of both proteins, the PER:CRY
  complex interacts with the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer and inhibits CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated
  transcription. The regulation of Bmal1 transcription is mediated mostly by REV-ERBα.
  The SCN and peripheral clocks operate with similar components and share a similar
  molecular core clock mechanism. Circadian signals can transfer from mother to fetus.
  The rhythms of melatonin and GCs provide synchronization signals for peripheral
  clocks. The interactions between light, the circadian clock, and the circadian signals
  melatonin and GCs in pregnancy ultimately impact the health of the mother and offspring.
