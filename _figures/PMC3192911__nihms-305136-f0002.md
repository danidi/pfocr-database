caption: Therapeutic tol-DC in organ allotransplantationTol DC can be either recipient-
  or donor-derived (in the case of living-donor transplantation). Recipient DC can
  be pulsed with donor antigen in various forms (donor cell lysate, exosomes, apoptotic
  bodies). During tol DC preparation, DC can be treated pharmacologically e.g. with
  dexamethasone VitD3/IL-10 to induce maturation resistance. Typical tol DC secrete
  and express cell surface regulatory molecules, that mediate the tolerogenic influence
  of tol DC on recipient T cells. As a result, tolerance to the donor antigen can
  be achieved through induction of regulatory T cells, as well as via the induction
  of anergy and deletion of effector and memory T cells. Additionally, infused tol
  DC can be reprocessed by recipient antigen-presenting cells (APC), promoting organ
  allograft survival through the indirect pathway. IDO, indoleamine dioxygenase; PD-L1,
  programed death ligand-1; HO-1, hemoxygenase-1.
