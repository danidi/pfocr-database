caption: Figure 7. In mammalian cells AMPK mediates a G2/M checkpoint in response
  to genomic stress. During cell division, activated AMPK associates with the mitotic
  apparatus in spindle fibers in prophase, the centrosomes in metaphase, mitotic spindle
  in anaphase, and the cleavage furrow in telophase. However, this association is
  not necessary for the progression of the cell cycle and mitosis in untreated cells,
  and AMPK may simply be a passenger molecule. AMPK modulates mitotic progression
  in cells undergoing genomic stress.
