caption: 'The cells responsible for bone remodeling, highlighting key signaling pathways
  that are targets for therapies recommended for the prevention of osteoporotic fracture.Notes:
  Osteocytes are embedded within mineralized bone and, in response to mechanical loading
  or microdamage, provide signals to osteoclasts to resorb. Osteoclast differentiation
  and function is dependent on the RANKL–RANK signaling pathway, which in vivo, is
  negatively regulated by OPG. Circulating PTH is a physiological regulator of plasma
  calcium and binds to PTHR on osteoblasts to indirectly stimulate osteoclast activity
  via upregulation of RANKL and downregulation of OPG expression. Calcitonin binds
  to the CTR expressed on mature osteoclasts to reversibly inhibit osteoclast function,
  although the exact physiological relevance for calcitonin is not fully understood.
  E2 has a positive effect on bone, through effects on osteoblasts and osteoclasts
  via ERα. CatK is secreted by resorbing osteoclasts across the convoluted ruffled
  border membrane and is required to degrade collagen. Osteoclast activity releases
  factors from the bone, which attract osteoblasts to the site of resorption. Osteoblast
  differentiation and function is controlled by the Wnt signaling pathway via the
  LRP5/6 and Frizzled co-receptors, which is regulated by endogenous inhibitors such
  as sclerostin, expressed by osteocytes and upregulated in response to unloading.Abbreviations:
  CatK, cathepsin K; CTR, calcitonin receptor; E2, estrogen; ERα, estrogen receptor;
  LRP5/6, lipoprotein-related protein 5/6; OPG, osteoprotegerin; PTH, parathyroid
  hormone; PTHR, PTH receptor; RANK, receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB; RANKL,
  RANK ligand.'
