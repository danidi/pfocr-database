caption: Microarray whole-genome gene expression datasets on aging (AG) and Alzheimer’s
  disease cohorts (ALZ) were collected and quality-control screened; significant genes
  were curated using two independent methods, DEG and IDCE; six curated gene sets
  were compared with known AD target genes and were used to query the KEGG pathway
  database to identify putative disrupted biological functions in AG and ALZ; differences
  in disruptions in AG and ALZ were identified at the gene level to identify novel
  AD target genes. Results on pathway analysis were discussed and compared with literature,
  and inferences drawn.
