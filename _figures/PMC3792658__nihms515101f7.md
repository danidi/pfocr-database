caption: A schematic diagram that illustrates the hypothesized neural pathways through
  which the amygdala that may mediate fear potentiated startle. Fear is induced by
  presence of the conditioning stimulus (CS) that was previously paired with the unconditioned
  stimulus (US), which is indicated by an increase in startle response in presence
  of the CS. The fear-induced increase in startle is mediated by the amygdala through
  two separate pathways, namely, the central-amygdalo-tegmento-pontine pathway and
  the medial-amygdalo-hypothalamo-periaqueducto-pontine pathway. The central-amygdalo-tegmento-pontine
  pathway involves the central amygdala (CeA), the deep layers of the superior colliculus/deep
  mesencephalic nucleus (dSC/DpMe) of the midbrain, and the nucleus reticularis pontis
  caudalis (PnC) of the brainstem. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is required in
  this pathway. The medial-amygdalo-hypothalamo-periaqueducto-pontine pathway involves
  the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus
  (VMH), the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (dlPAG) of the midbrain and the PnC.
  In this circuit substance P neurotransmission is required although we do not know
  how. We hypothesize that it modulates the release of glutamate in some but not all
  of these nuclei, including the PnC based on the work of . The startle circuit consists
  of cochlear root neurons (CN) in the auditory nerve, the PnC and the motor neurons
  in the spinal cord, where noise impinges onto the CN and subsequently elicit rapid
  startle reflex. The excitability of this circuit can be elevated by the excitatory
  inputs from the amygdala to the PnC, thus resulting in increased startle.
