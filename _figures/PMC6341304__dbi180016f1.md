caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction and diabetic retinopathy. Hyperglycemia induces
  many metabolic abnormalities, including activation of the polyol pathway and protein
  kinase C and advanced glycation formation, and also activates cytosolic Nox2. These
  abnormalities lead to increased ROS, and increased ROS, in turn, fuel in the metabolic
  abnormalities. High glucose also auto-oxidizes, further increasing ROS levels. ROS
  activate MMP-9 and inhibit antioxidant enzyme Sod2, and while activated MMP-9 damages
  the mitochondria, inactivated Sod2 impairs scavenging of mitochondrial free radicals
  produced. The activity of complex III (of ETC) is decreased, further increasing
  ROS levels. mtDNA is oxidatively modified, mismatches are increased and mismatch
  repair enzyme Mlh1 is compromised, and the transcription of mtDNA is impaired, further
  contributing to free radical accumulation. The vicious cycle of free radicals continues
  to self-perpetuate. The damaged mitochondria increase cytochrome c leakage in the
  cytosol and activate the apoptotic machinery, resulting in the formation of acellular
  capillaries and pericyte ghosts, the early histopathological lesions of diabetic
  retinopathy.
