caption: Proposed mechanisms of neoplastic transformation of small intestinal ILCs
  in refractory CD II. In RCD II patients, small intestinal IELs exhibiting an aberrant
  phenotype (Lin–, sCD3–, and iCD3+) have been proposed to represent expansion of
  ieILC1s. IL15 derived from epithelial cells and other cytokines secreted by lamina
  propria CD4+ T-helper type 1 cells (IL2, IL21, and TNF-α) have been shown to induce
  maturation arrest, proliferation, and expansion of the aberrant IELs by inducing
  granzyme B–dependent cleavage of intracellular NOTCH1 and activation of the JAK-STAT
  signaling pathway. Acquisition of JAK/STAT pathway gene mutations and decreased
  PCNA expression may facilitate development of additional genomic abnormalities that
  fuel the transformation to EATL.
