caption: 'Interaction scheme of Shh and activated β-catenin signaling. Schematic illustration
  of the hypothesized inhibition of β-catenin by canonical Shh signaling together
  with Jagged2-Notch2. Left side: If Shh binds to Ptch, it looses its inhibitory effect
  on SMO. This activates the Gli proteins for target gene translation (left side).
  The APC mutation in APCmin/+ leads to accumulation of cytosolic and nuclear β-catenin
  and leads to Wnt-specific target gene translation (middle). The activation of the
  Shh signaling is able to inhibit β-catenin downstream of the degradation complex.
  It is unknown whether this inhibition mechanism works through a novel pathway initiated
  by the receptor complex Ptch/SMO or takes place further downstream. Right side:
  JAG2 might be a second control mechanism for β-catenin via an unknown mechanism,
  as canonical Notch signaling is not required.'
