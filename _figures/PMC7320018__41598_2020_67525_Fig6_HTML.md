caption: Schematic representation of the possible roles of TBC1D9 (A) and MFGE8 (B).
  (A) TBC1D9, a GTPase activating protein, inactivates ARL8. When active, ARL8 localizes
  on the lysosomal membrane and regulates the lysosomal positioning on microtubules
  that leads to trafficking of lysosome to periphery, therefore resulting in cell
  migration. ARL8 is essential for membrane repair and extracellular matrix remodelling
  by controlling the exocytosis of lysosome. ARL8 bound lysosomes are also recruited
  to the circulating triacylglycerides and cholesterol esters, which are internalized
  by lysosomes and broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, respectively, leading
  to continuous ATP production essential for cell proliferation. A study have also
  shown that lysosomal exocytosis is essential for correct mitosis. PLK1 has a role
  in microtubule nucleation and mitosis. In the present study, a PLK1 interaction
  with TBC1D9 has been identified, which could possibly lead to inactive PLK1 by controlling
  its disassociation from its partners. This hypothesis however needs to be verified.
  (B) MFGE8 is known to interact with phosphatidylserine which is expressed in the
  apoptotic cells. After interaction, the complex binds to the integrin on the macrophages.
  This binding results in more secretion of MFGE8. MFGE8 activates effrocytosis of
  apoptotic cells. The process of effrocytosis and MFGE8 itself activates STAT3, leading
  to M2 polarization, tumor promotion and cancer stem cell activation. The apoptotic
  signaling also induces ER stress, resulting in tolerogenic phagocytosis, which also
  secretes MFGE8. This leads to EMT, invasion, mitosis by twist induction or survival
  and resistance to death by activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Upon ER stress induction,
  HIF1α is induced. This might be due to the interaction of secreted MFGE8 with HIF1α
  inhibitor OS9, therefore releasing HIF1α, resulting in tumor growth and metastasis.
  MFGE8 also binds to SEL1L, whose increased expression has been seen in metastasis
  and cancer stem cell activation. The mechanism by which MFGE8 might regulate SEL1L
  is an open question.
