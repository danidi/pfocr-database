caption: Model pathway for acyl-CoA conversion in Arabidopsis stem cuticle wax metabolism.
  Long chain acyl-CoAs serve as substrates in the synthesis of cuticle lipids ().
  The rst1 mutation primarily blocks synthesis of free aldehydes and its metabolites
  (represented by a gray bar), suggesting that the RST1 protein may function in acyl-CoA
  reduction. The secondary alcohols and ketones are metabolites of alkanes (not shown).
