caption: Hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) stimulate
  protein synthesis through both the Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway and activation of
  eIF2B, while amino acids activate mTORC1 signaling through the Rag proteins. Cell
  signaling pathways are depicted by black lines (arrows represent stimulatory pathways;
  lines with blunt ends represent inhibitory). Skeletal muscle wasting diseases, including
  sarcopenia, cachexia, disuse, sepsis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), impair signaling
  through these pathways at specific steps depicted by gray lines.
