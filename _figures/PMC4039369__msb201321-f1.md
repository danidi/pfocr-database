caption: Yeast pathway map of nucleotide degradation and ribose salvage. The pathway
  begins with the degradation of RNA. In starvation, this is triggered by macroautophagy
  (ribophagy). The resulting nucleotides are degraded into nucleosides except for
  AMP, which is first converted to IMP (). Purine nucleosides are then converted into
  ribose-1-phosphate and base, whereas pyrimidines are hydrolyzed into ribose and
  base. Both ribose and ribose-1-phosphate are converted into ribose-5-phosphate,
  which enters the nonoxidative branch of PPP. Gene annotations that are taken from
  definitive prior literature are shown in black; those confirmed by experiments in
  this study are shown in blue, and those newly assigned in this study are shown in
  red. Incorrect and missing annotations in the current genome scale metabolic model
  () (http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/yeastnet/) are listed in . The enzyme converting
  ribose to R5P remains unclear. G6P, glucose-6-phosphate; FBP, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; R5P, ribose-5-phosphate;
  X5P, xylulose-5-phosphate; Ru5P, ribulose-5-phosphate; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate.
