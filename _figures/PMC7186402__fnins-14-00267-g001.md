caption: The classic control network of ferroptosis. There are three main characteristics
  for ferroptosis, including lipid peroxidation, amino acid metabolism disorder, and
  iron accumulation. The lipid hydroperoxide metabolic pathway is mainly controlled
  by Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase (LPCAT3), and lipoxygenases (LOXs). ACSL4 catalyzes the attachment
  of arachidonic acid (AA) or adrenaline (AdA) to produce AA or AdA acyl Co-A derivatives,
  which is then esterified to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (AA-PE and AdA-PE) by
  lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3). Subsequently, AA-PE and AdA-PE
  are oxidized by LOXs to produce lipid hydroperoxide, which ultimately leads to ferroptosis.
  The amino acid metabolism disorder pathway is mainly owing to glutathione (GSH)
  peroxidase 4 (GPX4) synthesis and function blocking. GPX4 resists iron and oxygen-dependent
  lipid peroxidation by converting lipid peroxides (L-OOH) to non-toxic lipids and
  acts as the key enzyme in ferroptosis regulation. GSH is a cofactor and a synthetic
  substrate for GPX4 and is required for the lipid repair function of GPX4. GPX4 synthesized
  by GSH requires the pentose–phosphate pathway to supply ATP [through the nicotinamide
  adenosine dinucleotide hydro-phosphoric acid (NADPH) cycle]. GSH is synthesized
  by glutamate (Glu), cysteine (Cys), and glycine (Gly) and consists of ATP-dependent
  glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) and GSH synthetase (GSS) through cystine/glutamate
  reverse transport system xCT [12-channel transmembrane protein transporter vector
  family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11)/single-channel transmembrane regulatory protein solute
  carrier family 3 member 2 (SLC3A2)] or sulfur transfer pathway [methionine (Met)–homocysteine
  (Hcy)–cysteine (Cys) pathway]. When xCT/sulfur transfer pathway is inhibited, the
  synthesis of GSH and Cys decreasing, which leads to the inhibition of GPX4 synthesis
  and function to clear LOOH suppression, eventually leading to lipid peroxidation
  and inducing ferroptosis. The iron accumulation mainly caused by the loss of control
  of iron transport [membrane iron transporter (FPN), transfer iron protein receptor
  1 (TfR1), divalent metal ion transporter 1 (DMT1)] and iron storage [ferritin, degradation
  via the nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated ferritinophagy pathway],
  leading to an increase in the concentration of iron in the labile iron pool (LIP)
  and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) through Fenton reaction/mitochondrial
  damage/LOX function.
