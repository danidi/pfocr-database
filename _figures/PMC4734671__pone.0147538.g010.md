caption: Ionizing radiation promotes the neuronal differentiation of C17.2 cells via
  two independent signaling pathways, PI3K-p53 and PI3K-STAT3-mGluR1. p53 and STAT3
  may play as the downstream target of PI3K signaling in IR-induced neuronal differentiation
  of C17.2 cells. The activation of p53 via PI3K may be involved in the IR-induced
  neurite outgrowth and neuronal marker expressions. mGluR1 signaling of PI3K-STAT3
  downstream may also be involved in the IR-induced neuronal function-related protein
  expressions as well as neurite outgrowth and neuronal marker expressions.
