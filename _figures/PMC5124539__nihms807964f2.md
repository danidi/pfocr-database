caption: Pro-inflammatory pathway of IL-18 in the maturation and activation of T cell
  subsets are demonstrated by red arrows and anti-inflammatory pathway by green arrows,
  and blue arrows indicates that IL-18 has a role in a number of inflammatory cells
  activation to promote autoimmune and allergic diseases. The presented summary indicates
  that IL-18 is involved in natural killer T cells activation, induces B cell differentiation,
  and conversion of naïve T cells to Th2 cells. IL-18 can stimulate the conversion
  in vitro of Th1 cells to “super Th1 cells” that produce Th2 cytokines that promotes
  autoimmune and allergic diseases and in synergy with IL-12 activates T regulatory
  cell activity and Th1 cytokine to release anti-inflammatory cytokines.
