caption: '(A) The two-compartment model of the glutamate–glutamine cycle between neurons
  and astrocytes. The main routes of 13C labels are shown: from glucose to pyruvate/lactate
  through glycolysis, the anaplerotic pathway at astrocytic oxaloacetate, astrocytic
  and neuronal tricarboxylic acid cycles and the glutamate–glutamine cycle. Released
  neurotransmitter glutamate is transported from the synaptic cleft to surrounding
  glial end processes. Once in the astrocytes glutamate is converted to glutamine
  by glutamine synthetase. Glutamine is released by the astrocytes, transported into
  the neurons, and converted to glutamate by phosphate-activated glutaminase which
  completes the cycle. Asp, aspartate; Glc, glucose; Gln, glutamine; Glu, glutamate;
  α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; Lac, lactate; OAA, oxaloacetate; Pyr, pyruvate; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; Vcyc, glutamate–glutamine cycling rate; Vdil(Gln), astroglial dilution
  flux rate. See  for more details on this two-compartment metabolic model. (B) The
  simplified two-compartment model in which all 13C labels flow from pyruvate/lactate
  to neuronal glutamate, which is in exchange with astrocytic glutamine. This simplified
  model represents the dominant metabolic pathways for the trafficking of 13C labels
  when [1-13C] or [1,6-13C2]glucose infusion is used to introduce exogenous 13C labels
  into the brain. That is, most labels flow from pyruvate C3 to neuronal glutamate
  C4 and then to astrocytic glutamine C4. In both (A, B), the astrocytic dilution
  flux was explicitly added at the level of glutamine.'
