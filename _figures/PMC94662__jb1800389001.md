caption: Biosynthesis of CoQ in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. After formation of 3-polyprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoic
  acid (compound 1), the proposed biosynthetic pathways for CoQ in eukaryotes and
  in prokaryotes are thought to diverge. The intermediates in the pathway are 2-polyprenylphenol
  (compound 2); 2-polyprenyl-6-hydroxy-phenol (compound 3); 3,4-dihydroxy-5-polyprenylbenzoic
  acid (compound 4); 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-5-polyprenylbenzoic acid (compound 5); 2-polyprenyl-6-methoxy-phenol
  (compound 6); 2-polyprenyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol (compound 7); 2-polyprenyl-3-methyl-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol
  or 5-demethoxyubiquinol (compound 8); 2-polyprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinol
  or demethyl-QH2 (compound 9); and CoQnH2 (compound 10). In E. coli, n = 8, and compound
  2 is referred to as octaprenylphenol. E. coli gene products are identified as Ubi;
  S. cerevisiae gene products are identified as Coq.
