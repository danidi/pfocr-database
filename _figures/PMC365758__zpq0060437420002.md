caption: Genes of central carbon metabolism activated under glucose-limited (red)
  and ethanol-limited (green) conditions. Boxes are drawn around the sections of the
  metabolic chart that include the glyoxylate and TCA cycles, respectively, to highlight
  the gluconeogenic and glucose-catabolic regions of metabolism. Question marks next
  to gene names indicate uncertainty over their involvement in that step of the pathway.
