caption: Roles of IKKκ in NF-αB canonical and non-canonical pathways. IKKa preferentially
  forms heterodimer with IKKβ, but occasionally forms homodimer with IKKa itself.
  Knockdown of KKa affects both canonical and non-canonical pathways. In the canonical
  pathway it stimulates CBF-1, leading to inhibition of tumor growth. Through the
  non-canonical pathway, knockdown of KKa prevents the MAP3K14-mediated phosphorylation
  of p100, thereby inhibiting the processing of p100 to p52.
