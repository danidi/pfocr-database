caption: 'Cell-cell contact can inhibit YAP/TAZ transcriptional activity both by sequestration
  to adherins junctions (AJ) in an α-catenin dependent fashion and through E-cadherin/catentin
  dependant activation of the Hippo pathway. Additionally, AMOT can sequester YAP/TAZ
  regardless of phosphorylation status. Note: This schematic is simplified to highlight
  the major factors in cell contact inhibition of YAP/TAZ.'
