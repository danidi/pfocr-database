caption: 'Signal-transduction events in necroptosis. A) The necroptosis pathway may
  be categorized into the triggers, initiators and effectors of necroptosis. The initiator
  molecules involve cytokines like TNFα, IFNγ or viral nucleic acids which via their
  cognate receptors activate the initiator molecules. These initiators converge on
  activating RIP3, for instance via phosphorylation. Activated RIP3 is currently known
  to function via at least three downstream effectors-- MLKL PGAM5 and CaMKII, which
  are the effector molecules leading to necrosis. Protein phosphatase ppm1b is found
  to de-phosphorylate RIP3 and prevent necroptosis. Ⓟ denotes phosphorylation. B)
  The complexes involved in cell-death are depicted. Depending on the cell-type and
  cellular-context, TNFα may promote formation of a pro-survival complex (complex
  I), a pro-apoptotic complex (complex IIa) or depending on the inhibition of caspase
  8 and presence of RIP3, a pro-necroptotic complex (complex IIb). The components
  of the pro-necroptosis complex II are depicted.PKR: Protein Kinase R; TRIF: TIR-domain-containing
