caption: Metronidazole is an example of synthetic antibiotic. This drug demonstrates
  inhibitory efficacies against Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, such as Helicobacter
  pylori, and protozoa, i.e., Giardia, Lamblia, and Entamoeba histolytica []. Nitro
  fragment present in its structure undergoes reduction process by metabolic pathway
  and the reactive intermediate is able to damage nucleic acids []. The conjugates
  of metronidazole and quinolones 69, 70 were prepared by Cui and coworkers in multi-step
  synthesis (Scheme ) and evaluated in vitro against Gram-positive (S. pneumoniae,
  M. luteus, 2 strains of S. aureus, and B. subtilis) and Gram-negative (P. aeruginosa,
  E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, and E. typhosa) bacteria as well as fungi (C. albicans,
  C. mycoderma, and A. flavus). Antifungal activity of the obtained compounds was
  found to be moderate or weak. The measured MIC values were in the range of 64–512 µg/cm3
  only with small exception for the hybrids 69b and 70b, which were more potent than
  the reference drug, fluconazole. The synthesized compounds exhibited divergent activity
  in antibacterial assays. The most potent conjugates were compounds 70b and 70d (MIC
  values of 0.5–8 µg/cm3). Hybrids 69b, 70b, and 70d were further examined for their
  cytotoxic properties on A549 and normal human hepatocyte LO2 cell lines and no obviously
  reducing trends to the cell viability were observed within the concentration of
  128–256 µg/cm3. Molecular modeling studies were performed with use of the crystal
  structure of S. pneumoniae topoisomerase IV–DNA complex and the docking results
  of the target hybrids showed that the substituents on benzene ring of quinolone
  could affect the antibacterial activities. Compound 70d was tested in binding assay
  with calf-thymus DNA and exhibited stronger interferation with nucleic acid than
  norfloxacin. These conjugates exhibited also good aqueous solubility, which combined
  make them good potential drug candidates [].
