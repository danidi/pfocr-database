caption: Model for the mechanism of dietary restriction (DR). In this proposed model,
  DR inhibits the three protein kinases Tor, protein kinase A (PKA), and Sch9. This
  inhibition results in increased levels of respiration and activation of the stress
  response proteins Msn2/4. Inhibition of Msn2/4 results in loss of activity of Pnc1,
  a nicotinamide deaminase. Both events lead to the activation of Sir2, which then
  affects aging by inhibiting ERC formation and by an unknown pathway. Inhibition
  of the three kinases may also result in altered translation levels as well as higher
  levels of autophagy. The cumulative effect of all events is the extension of life
  span. The asterisks indicate that the relevance of these branches of the pathway
  is in question among different research groups. The pound sign indicates where a
  role for autophagy in regulating yeast replicative life span is possible but not
  formally demonstrated. ERCs, extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles.
