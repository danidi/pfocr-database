caption: 'Stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to assess inter-variable
  dependence and explanatory power (%), based on corrected R2 values and a p-value
  of ≤0.05 ( and ). Ceffect found in control subjects only, GSeffect found in GS subjects
  only, (All remaining unspecified correlations are valid for both study groups.),
