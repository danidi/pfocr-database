caption: PALB2 links BRCA1 and BRCA2 into a pathway of products of breast cancer susceptibility
  genes. This pathway mediates HR, and as a result, the maintenance of genome stability.
  BRCA1 binds to PALB2 through a coiled-coil motif present on each protein and recruits
  it to sites of DNA damage. PALB2 then directly binds to the N-terminus of BRCA2
  through its WD40 domain and recruits BRCA2. BRCA2 directly binds and recruits the
  RAD51 recombinase, which mediates strand invasion. PALB2 can also directly bind
  RAD51, but whether PALB2 can recruit RAD51 independent of BRCA2 is unknown. BRCA1,
  PALB2, and BRCA2 are all breast cancer susceptibility genes.
