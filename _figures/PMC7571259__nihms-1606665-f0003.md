caption: a, Schematic of pathways that regulate VEGFA expression. Of the known miRNAs
  that affect VEGFA, only miR-377 is upregulated post-ischemia. VegfA mRNA contains
  various regulatory elements, including (1) two IRESs that regulate translation,
  (2) a stress-responsive atypical riboswitch element that reacts to the binding of
  hnRNPL protein (activates translation) or interferon gamma-activated inhibitor of
  translation protein, (3) AU-rich elements (AREs) that control mRNA stability and
  (4) binding sites for miRNAs, including miR-377, miR-125a and miR-16, among others.
  b, Post-ischemic upregulation of miR-377 downregulates VEGFA, slowing growth and
  angiogenesis. A small molecule that binds pre-miR-377’s Dicer site (tan box, binding
  site for C1) and an adjacent bulge (green box, binding site for C2) can inhibit
  enzymatic processing and de-repress VEGFA, stimulating angiogenesis and proliferation.
  TargetScan-predicted binding site of miR-377’s seed sequence to Vegfa mRNA (aligned
  sequences are boxed); miR-377–3p indicates that the mature miRNA emanates from the
  3′ end of the pre-miRNA. c, Design of a selective pre-miR-377 inhibitor by linking
  C1 (tan box in b indicates the binding site in pre-miR-377) and C2 (green box in
  b indicates the binding site in pre-miR-377) via compounds C1-COOH and C2-Ak, yielding
  TGP-377. MD simulations of the binding of TGP-377 to pre-miR-377 suggest that the
  compound intercalates into the two bulges with the linker threading through the
  major groove to support binding (bottom right). Both non-canonically paired adenines
  contribute to the stability of the complex by π−π stacking with the RNA-binding
  modules.
