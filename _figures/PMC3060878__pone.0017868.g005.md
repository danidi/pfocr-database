caption: (A) Schematic diagram showing hepatic biosynthetic pathways that convert
  cholesterol into bile acids. The classical (neutral) pathway (center) is initiated
  by Cyp7A1, whereas the alternate (acidic) pathway (right) is initiated by Cyp27a1
  and Cyp7b1. According to our model, FGF19 suppresses the classical pathway through
  transcriptional regulation of Cyp7a1 and Cyp8b1, shifting BA synthesis towards production
  of CDCA or its derivatives. (B) Distinct FGFR/KLB receptor complexes mediate various
  biological activities of FGF19, FGF19v, and FGF21. In addition to the model depicted,
  FGF21 and FGF19 can also suppress Cyp7a1 expression acutely in FGFR4-independent
  manner ().
