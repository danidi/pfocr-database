caption: Schematic representation of the most significant IPA networks involving the
  proteins that were differentially regulated between the CF and control states. The
  IPA analysis found that the functional interaction networks pathway with the highest
  score (33) was related to “metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and disease
  organismal injury and abnormalities.” This pathway incorporated pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, ERK1/2, and P38 MAPK as central nodes that were deregulated in CF samples.
  The nodes in green and red correspond to down-regulated and up-regulated proteins,
  respectively. The colorless nodes were proposed by the IPA and suggest potential
  targets that are functionally coordinated with the differentially abundant proteins
  (A). The solid lines indicate direct molecular interactions, and the dashed lines
  represent indirect interactions. The diagram shows the top six canonical pathways
  ranked by the P-values obtained from the IPA (B).
