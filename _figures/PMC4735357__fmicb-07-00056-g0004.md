caption: The analysis of metabolic pathways among the microbial community. The circles
  in the figure represent the intermediates, the rectangles represent the enzymes.
  Different filled colors of rectangles represent the groups from the community, among
  which the white color indicates the absence of the corresponding enzyme in this
  group. (A) The aerobic biosynthesis pathway of Vitamin B12. The enzymes tagged by
  red rectangles are absent in Group 5, while the enzymes tagged by blue rectangles
  are absent in Group 6, but the pathway is completed with the combination of Group
  5 and 6. (B) The metabolic pathway of benzoate degradation. In the metabolic diagram,
  only Group 5 and 8 participate consistently in the process of converting benzoate
  to 3-oxoadipate, while Group 3 and 6 then catalyze it to 3-oxoadipul-CoA with EC
  2.8.3.6, which is absent in both Group 5 and 8 in our analysis. Through this kind
  of cooperation, the whole community can adapt for the complex environment.
