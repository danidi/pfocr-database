caption: 'Hippo signaling pathway and main regulators. The core of Hippo signaling
  consists of a group of kinases (MST1/2, LATS1/2) and adaptor proteins SAV1 and MOB1,
  which by phosphorylating the Hippo pathway effectors YAP, and TAZ retain them in
  the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, YAP/TAZ undergo proteosomal degradation. YAP and
  TAZ, if not retained in the cytoplasm, can translocate to the nucleus where they
  regulate the activity of several transcription factors that induce the expression
  of Hippo target genes involved in cancer development and progression. Upstream regulation
  of Hippo includes: i) FERM domain-containing proteins (NF2 KIBRA and WILLIN) that
  activate the core kinase complex, ii) Polarization and Adhesion proteins like α-catenin,
  E-cadherin, CRUMBS and SCRIBBLE complexes that can sequester YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm
  iii) GPCRs that can be divided in those signaling through GαS leading to activation
  of Hippo cascade or those signaling through other Gα subunits that favor YAP/TAZ
  nuclear translocation iv) Mechanical stress regulated by F-actin can also increase
  YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic location. Additionally, independent proteins like Rassf1a and
  several pathways regulate Hippo signaling. New molecules and drugs under development
  to modulate Hippo signaling are represented in yellow.'
