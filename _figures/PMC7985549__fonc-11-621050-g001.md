caption: Several ligands on the cell surface stimulate the production of PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol
  trisphosphate) by PI3K. These molecules act as a substrate for protein activation,
  including AKT. This protein phosphorylates GSK3, inhibiting its function (). The
  tumor suppressor gene PTEN blocks AKT activity by dephosphorylating PIP3 and PIK3
  (). In addition, Akt can activate the IκB complex (IKK), which phosphorylates IκB,
  becoming an important stimulus for NFκB (). The NFkB is translocated to the nucleus,
  promoting the production of COX-2, an enzyme associated with angiogenesis, invasion,
  and metastasis (). A complex consisting of AXIN, APC, and GSK3 is responsible for
  the destruction and negative regulation of B-catenin (). The Wnt/β-catenin signaling
  pathway is related to cell proliferation, stem cell self-renewal, and cell differentiation
  (). When active and in accumulation, B-catenin is translocated to the nucleus. Cyclin
  D1 and C-myc are oncogenes associated with cell proliferation and differentiation.
  Previous publications demonstrated they are target genes for the Wnt/B-catenin signaling
  pathway (). T-box transcription factor protein 21 (TBX21)—also known as Tbet—is
  present in tumor cells, causing local immune response dysregulation and carcinogenesis
  (). GSK3 inhibition promotes increased Tbet transcription (). Previous reports demonstrated
  that GSK3 can cause PDL1 degradation by the proteasome pathway (). GSK3, Glycogen
