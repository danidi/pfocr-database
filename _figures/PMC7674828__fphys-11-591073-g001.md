caption: 'Schematic model for the cold response pathway in plants. As explained in
  further detail in “The Cold Response Pathway: Brief Overview of Experimental Aspects”
  section, the plasma membrane is thought to be the primary target of cold sensing
  and the starting point for transmission of the cold signal into the nucleus. The
  cold stress (symbolized by a snowflake) initiates a transient increase in Ca2+,
  which takes the form of a single Ca2+ pulse or of a train of high-frequency Ca2+
  oscillations. The cold response pathway reacts to the cold stress by the expression
  of C-repeat-binding factors (CBFs, notably CBF3) that control the resistance of
  plants to cold stress through the expression of cold-regulated (COR) genes. For
  the sake of clarity, not all reaction steps are indicated in the scheme. Steps colored
  in blue and red denote reactions or interactions which contribute to enhance or
  inhibit CBF3 expression, respectively. Upon activation by calmodulin (CaM), plasma
  membrane Ca2+-regulated kinases (CRLK1/2) positively regulate cold-induced gene
  expression, through the MPK6 and MPK4 pathway. The cold signal activates the MPK4-MPK6
  cascade to regulate freezing tolerance, through phosphorylation of ICE1. A receptor-like
  cytoplasmic kinase cold-responsive protein kinase 1 (CRPK1) is activated by low
  temperature stress and phosphorylates 14-3-3 proteins; in the absence of direct
  evidence (hence the question mark), we assume that this activation, as for CRLK1,
  is mediated by CaM (see “CBF Signaling” section). To keep the scheme simple, we
  do not show the active forms CRLK1a and CRPK1a resulting from the bimolecular activation
  of CRLK1 and CRPK1 by CaM. The key components of CBF-dependent signaling, ICE1 and
  CBF, are modulated through post-translational modifications. Phosphorylated MPK6
  mediates the phosphorylation of ICE1, which leads to increased ICE1 degradation
  via ubiquitination; the latter process is enhanced by the high expression of the
  osmotically responsive gene1 (HOS1). The 14-3-3 protein kinase phosphorylates CBF3
  and, thereby, facilitates the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of CBF3. Cold stress
  induces the accumulation of CBF proteins, which elicit the expression of ZAT12.
  The latter factor exerts a negative feedback on the transcription of CBF3 mRNA.'
