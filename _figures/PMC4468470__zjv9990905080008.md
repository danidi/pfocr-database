caption: Summary of the effects of HCMV infection on the Notch signaling pathway.
  (A) HCMV infection regulates NICD1 and Jag1. The decreased levels of Jag1 and Notch1
  on the membranes of infected cells directly affects the cell-cell interactions between
  the signaling (sending and receiving) cells. The degradation and accumulation of
  NICD1 in cytoplasm will block the translocation to the nucleus for activation of
  downstream genes, which will also affect the activation of the Notch signaling pathway.
  (B) HCMV infection dysregulates NICD1 and Jag1 and affects the proliferation and
  differentiation of NPCs.
