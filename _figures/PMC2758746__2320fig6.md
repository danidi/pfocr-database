caption: Pma1 and the Rgt2/Snf3 glucose signaling pathway We propose that Pma1 acts
  as a part of the Rgt2/Snf3 signaling pathway. (A) In [gar−] glucose-grown cells,
  Pma1 associates with Mth1. The glucose signal is propagated through Snf3 and Rgt2
  to Yck1 and Yck2, which phosphorylate Mth1 and Std1. This phosphorylation marks
  Mth1 and Std1 for degredation, leaving their interacting partner, Rgt1, free in
  the cytosol, where it does not repress transcription at the HXT3 locus. (B) Under
  [GAR+] conditions, HXT3 transcription is repressed, which resembles that of cells
  grown in a carbon source other than glucose. Pma1 associates with Std1, which somehow
  facilitates the repression of HXT3, possibly by altering the affinity of Std1 for
  Rgt1. Association with Std1 has been shown previously to facilitate the binding
  of Rgt1 to DNA (). The association between Pma1 can either be transient or stable,
  but either way it aids in the establishment of an altered signaling pathway. This
  altered pathway is then maintained either by the contained association between Std1
  and Pma1 or by a feedback loop within the signaling cascade itself.
