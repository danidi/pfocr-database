caption: 'MAMP/PAMP sensing pathways in the intestine. Several PRRs are involved in
  sensing MAMPs/DAMPs in the intestine: TLRs, RLRs and NLRs. MAMPs/PAMPs are sensed
  either extracellularly by TLR1/2/4/5/6, or intracellularly by the endosomal TLRs
  3/7/8/9 and cytosolic NLRs, RLRs or the cGAS/STING pathway. The receptors (red)
  signal via adapter proteins (magenta) and further downstream signal components (yellow)
  to the final players of the respective pathway (green), leading to gene expression
  or activation of effector molecules. Ligand binding to the extracellular TLRs and
  the endosomal TLRs 7,8,9 induces signaling via the adapter MyD88, leading to the
  recruitment and complex formation of IRAK-1/2/4 with TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IKKα,
  osteopontin and IRF7. Upon phosphorylation, IRF7 is activated and translocates into
  the nucleus to induce transcription of type I and III IFN genes. MyD88 signaling
  can be inhibited by the receptor SIGIRR. In addition, MyD88 leads to the formation
  of a complex comprising IRAK-1/2/4, TRAF6 and TAK1, which activates the IKK-complex
  (comprised of IKKα, IKKβ and NEMO), triggering degradation of IκB and allowing NF-κB
  to translocate into the nucleus to induce the transcription of proinflammatory genes.
  The cytosolic sensor cGAS signals via the adapter STING, which forms a complex with
  TBK1 and IRF3. TBK1 phosphorylates and thereby activates IRF3, leading to the transcription
  of type I and III IFN genes in the nucleus. RLRs, such as RIG-I and MDA5, employ
  MAVS as signaling adapter, which triggers the formation of a signaling complex containing
  TRAF3, IKKε, TANK, NEMO, TBK1 and IRF3/7. Subsequent phosphorylation of IRF3/7 leads
  to the transcription of type I and III IFN genes. The same complex is induced by
  TRIF signaling upon ligand binding to TLR3. The signaling adapter MAVS can be inhibited
  by the NLR family member NLRX1, which plays a modulating role. The other members
  of the NLR family activate different downstream signaling cascades. NOD2 can employ
  the RLR adapter MAVS, leading to type I and III IFN gene transcription or signal
  via the aforementioned IKK-complex, leading to NF-κB dependent production of proinflammatory
  cytokines. In contrast to the other nucleic acid sensors, NLRPs do not sense pathogen-derived
  nucleic acids directly, but employ DHX helicases (NRLP6: DHX15, NLRP9b: DHX9). NLRP
  signaling requires the adapter protein ASC. Activation of the NLRP pathway leads
  to the formation of a complex containing ASC, CARD8 and pro-Casp1, resulting in
  auto-activation of pro-Casp1 into the proteolytically active Casp1. In contrast
  to the other pathways mentioned, NLRP signaling does not lead to the activation
  of transcription factors, but to the maturation of the cytokines IL-1β and IL-18
  by Casp1 mediated cleavage. Used abbreviations in alphabetical order: ASC—apoptosis-associated
  speck-like protein containing CARD; CARD—caspase activation and recruitment domain;
  cGAS—cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; DHX—DEAH-box; IKK—IκB kinase; IRAK—interleukin-1 receptor-associated
