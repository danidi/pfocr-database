caption: Simplified scheme of de novo dTMP synthesis. De novo synthesis of dCDP is
  catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase. Conversion of dCMP to dUMP is catalyzed by
  dCMP deaminase, which is positively regulated by dCTP (+) and inhibited by dTTP
  (−). Red arrows indicate the major dTTP synthesis pathway via dCMP deaminase, and
  blue arrows indicate the minor dTTP synthesis pathway via dUTPase.
