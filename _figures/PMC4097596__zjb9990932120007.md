caption: Metabolite-mediated glycolytic derepression under steady-state treatment
  with H2O2. (A) In S. aureus, ROS inactivation of GAPDH leads to a metabolic reconfiguration
  from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway, thus increasing the intracellular
  levels of FBP. Subsequently, elevated levels of FBP interact with the glycolytic
  repressor GapR, which leads to its dissociation from its own promoter. Finally,
  the glycolytic genes are derepressed. (B) In P. aeruginosa, the induced glycolysis
  increased the intracellular levels of KDPG, which binds to the glycolytic repressor
  HexR. KDPG-mediated release of HexR from the promoters of gapA and zwf results in
  the derepression of the glycolytic genes.
