caption: Depiction of DNA methylation process. DNMT transfers the methyl group to
  5′ position of cytosine in the DNA sequence. SAM acts as a methyl donor in this
  process and it is converted to SAH. SAHH converts SAH to homocysteine by the removal
  of adenosine moiety. Thereafter, homocysteine either undergoes the transsulfuration
  pathway to form GSH or remethylated through methionine synthase enzyme and form
  methionine. Subsequently, methionine adenosyl transferase adds adenosine to the
  methionine and finally forms SAM.
