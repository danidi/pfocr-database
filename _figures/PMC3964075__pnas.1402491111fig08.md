caption: A working model for the integrated regulation of Pchlide accumulation and
  hypocotyl elongation in etiolated seedlings under soil. (Left) A diagram of the
  seedlings grown in different soil environments. (Right) The model showing the signaling
  pathway that enables seedlings to grow out of soil and survive the critical dark-to-light
  transition. After germination under soil, the etiolated seedlings produce ethylene
  in response to the mechanical stress of the soil. Through the EIN3/EIL1 proteins,
  ethylene activates a PIF3–ERF1 transcriptional circuitry to synchronize tissue-specific
  developments in etiolated seedlings. The ERF1 pathway most likely regulates hypocotyl
  cell elongation so that the etiolated seedlings can better penetrate the soil cover,
  whereas the PIF3 pathway simultaneously modulates the preassembly of photosynthetic
  machinery in the cotyledon. The coupling of these two processes enables seedlings
  to rapidly acquire photosynthetic capacity without being damaged by photooxidation
  during their initial transition from dark to light.
