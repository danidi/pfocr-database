caption: Mechanism model of exogenous MT in delaying the post-harvest decay of wax
  apples. The left part displays the ROS accumulation pathway. The synthesis of ROS
  can be divided into enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways. Nonenzymatic pathways can
  directly lead to ROS accumulation. In enzymatic pathways, LOX enzyme can catalyse
  unsaturated fatty acids to form hydroperoxides and free radicals, eventually leading
  to membrane lipid peroxidation. All of the reactions will cause the decay of post-harvest
  wax apples. The right part indicates the MT action pathway. The main function of
  MT is to remove excess ROS though antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant pathway. The
  antioxidant enzyme pathway includes SOD, CAT, APX, and AsA-GSH cycles. ROS can be
  also removed through the GABA shunt pathway. The increase in JA and SA contents
  will also decrease the risk to post-harvest diseases. Red and green arrows indicate
  the up-regulation and down-regulation of expression levels under exogenous MT treatment,
  respectively. Italics represent gene expression during post-harvest preservation
  process.
