caption: The proposed model of Si-mediated alleviation of Fe deficiency in cucumber.
  In roots, Si increases Fe pools in the root apoplast (1) and enhances the accumulation
  of Fe-chelating compounds (organic acids and phenolics) in roots by stimulating
  expression of genes related to their biosynthesis (TCA cycle; shikimate and phenylpropanoid
  pathway; see ) for improved mobilization of Fe from the rhizosphere and reutilization
  of root apoplastic Fe (2), followed by the upregulated expression levels of the
  proteins involved in Strategy 1 reduction-based Fe uptake, i.e. HA1, FRO2 (in cucumber
  also known as CsFRO1; ) and IRT1 (3). Silicon also increases root to shoot movement
  of Fe complexed by citrate (and malate) via xylem (4). In leaves, Si enhances expression
  of NAS1 genes responsible for NA biosynthesis (see ) in sink leaves (5) and expression
  of YSL1 genes responsible for Fe phloem loading and phloem transport of NA-chelated
  Fe from sink to source leaves (see ), as well as for unloading of the Fe–NA complex
  arriving via the phloem in young leaves (6). CC/SE, companion cell/sieve element;
  TC, transfer cell.
