caption: The canonical inflammasome pathway is triggered by multiple pathogens and
  inflammatory agents. The presence of PAMPs and DAMPs is sensed by specific innate
  immune sensors which results in their oligomerization and ultimately inflammasome
  assembly. Innate immune sensors known to engage well‐defined inflammasomes are a
  subset of NOD‐like receptors (NLRP1b, NLRC4 and NLRP3), a member of the HIN200/AIM2‐like
  receptor family (AIM2) and a member of TRIM family (Pyrin/TRIM20). The NLRP1b inflammasome
  responds to lethal factor produced by Bacillus anthracis and assembles an inflammasome
  by recruiting caspase‐1 through its CARD domain or through ASC as an adaptor. NAIPs
  function as direct receptors for bacterial flagellin and the type 3 secretion system
  (T3SS). Ligand binding results in NAIP activation, allowing it to recruit and activate
  the NLRC4 inflammasome which can form complexes with or without recruiting ASC.
  Upon cytosolic recognition of viral, bacterial or host‐derived double‐stranded DNA,
  the AIM2 inflammasome is assembled. Activation of the Pyrin inflammasome on the
  other hand is triggered by RhoA GTPase‐inactivating modifications induced by various
  bacterial toxins. Finally, the NLRP3 inflammasome responds to intracellular damage
  induced by pathogenic or sterile insults. Potassium efflux is thought to be the
  common event associated with the diverse array of NLRP3 stimuli. While the PYD‐based
  sensors (NLRP3, AIM2 and Pyrin) require the bipartite adaptor protein ASC to recruit
  caspase‐1, the CARD‐based sensors (NLRP1b and NLRC4) can recruit caspase‐1 independently
  of ASC. Oligomerization of pro‐caspase‐1 leads to its autoactivation, and active
  caspase‐1 catalyses the maturation and secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL‐1β
  and IL‐18. Additionally, active caspase‐1 engages pyroptosis by cleaving its substrate
  gasdermin D. This lytic mode of programmed cell death coincides with the release
  of alarmins such as IL‐1α and HMGB1. The non‐canonical inflammasome pathway is activated
  when cytosolic LPS is sensed by pro‐caspase‐11 in mice (or pro‐caspase‐4/5 in humans).
  Upon oligomerization, active caspase‐11 cleaves gasdermin D to drive pyroptosis.
  In addition, active caspase‐11 induces non‐canonical activation of NLRP3 resulting
  in caspase‐1 activation and the maturation of the inflammatory cytokines IL‐1β and
  IL‐18, which are then released by gasdermin D‐induced pyroptosis. AIM2, absent in
  melanoma 2; ASC, apoptosis‐associated speck‐like protein containing a CARD; CARD,
  caspase recruitment domain; DAMP, damage‐associated molecular pattern; dsDNA, double‐stranded
  DNA; HMGB1, high‐mobility group box 1; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; NAIPs, NLR family
  apoptosis inhibitory proteins; NLR, NOD‐like receptor; NOD, nucleotide‐binding oligomerization
