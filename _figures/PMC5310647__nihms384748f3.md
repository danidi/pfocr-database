caption: Schematic of the genes involved in PCP signaling. (A) Core PCP genes, JNK
  cascade, and cytoskeletal branch. In flies, the link between Dsh and the Rho family
  GTPases is currently unknown. The involvement of MRLC is inferred from wing data.
  (B) Ft/Ds module. Note that the hierarchical relationship between Ft/Ds and the
  core PCP pathway is unclear.
