caption: Mechanistic comparison of gravitropism and thigmotropism in roots of higher
  plants. After horizontal gravistimulation, the sedimentation of amyloplasts within
  root apex cells triggers both the re‐localization of PIN3/PIN7 within root columella
  cells and the asymmetric degradation of PIN2 between the upper and lower sides of
  the root to redirect the intercellular auxin flow along the lower side towards the
  elongation zone, where auxin inhibits growth. This auxin redistribution coincides
  with the cytosolic calcium ion (Ca2+) waves, which in turn trigger the production
  of apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pH changes that may be linked to
  growth regulation. During root obstacle avoidance, it is unknown which part of the
  root is used for touch perception and which component(s)/organelles trigger the
  PIN‐mediated asymmetric auxin distribution. Ca2+ waves were observed in root thigmotropism
  and have been recognized to facilitate root bending through the downstream pH and
  ROS signals as in root gravitropism. Blocking Ca2+signaling interferes with the
  PIN‐mediated auxin redistribution during obstacle avoidance, implying the existence
  of a feedback loop between the Ca2+ wave and the auxin distribution. This can occur
  through demonstrated Ca2+ effect on PIN subcellular distribution. Both root gravitropism
  and thigmotropism rely on the TIR1/AFB‐mediated auxin signaling pathway to regulate
  differential epidermal cell elongation and ultimately the root bending.
