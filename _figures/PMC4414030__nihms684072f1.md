caption: A schematic showing that astrocyte-secreted APOE2 and APOE3, but not APOE4,
  signal to pericytes via low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1),
  suppressing the CypA–NF-kB–MMP9 pro-inflammatory pathway that causes blood-brain
  barrier (BBB) breakdown by MMP9-mediated degradation of tight junction and basement
  membrane proteins. BBB dysfunction is associated with the accumulation of several
  neurotoxins in the brain which affect neuronal function and contribute to the development
  of neurodegenerative changes. Modified from ref. .
