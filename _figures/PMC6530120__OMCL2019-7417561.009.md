caption: Model of the JNK/Sab/Src/ROS signaling pathway and the role of F2 in H9c2
  cells during H/R. H/R causes oxidative stress in mitochondria by activating JNK,
  which binds to mitochondrial outer membrane Sab protein, leading to inactivation
  of mitochondrial p-Src and increasing mitochondrial ROS production in H9c2 cells.
  F2 could inhibit H/R-induced JNK activation and ameliorate dephosphorylation of
  Src and reduce the mitochondrial ROS level.
