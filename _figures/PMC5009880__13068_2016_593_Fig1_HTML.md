caption: Overview of the principal metabolic pathways for erythritol and CA production
  in Y. lipolytica. In Y. lipolytica, glycerol is assimilated via phosphorylation
  by a glycerol kinase and subsequently is dehydrogenased to dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  by glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase. Then, the erythritol is synthetized via a pentose
  phosphate pathway in response to high osmotic stress. Citric acid synthesis occurs
  in mitochondria in the TCA cycle

  synthesis from glycerol.
