caption: The adult haemangioblast genetic regulatory network. Network summarising
  the genetic interactions programming adult haemangioblasts in the DLP as determined
  by MO knockdown. Strikingly, somitic VEGFA is absolutely essential for Flk1 receptor
  activation in haemangioblast precursors; this activation results in the establishment
  of endogenous, cell-autonomous VEGFA signalling. Importantly, Scl expression and
  haemangioblasts cannot be specified unless this endogenous VEGFA signalling synergises
  with a VEGFA-independent pathway controlled by Fli1 and Etv2. The timing and tissue
  of expression is denoted by the position of the gene on the network, whereas its
  relationships with genes expressed at the same time or later is depicted by an arrow
  from the regulating gene to the regulated gene. Arrows with chevrons indicate the
  interaction between VEGFA and its receptor, Flk1. P indicates paracrine VEGFA signalling,
  whereas A indicates endogenous autocrine signalling. The red circle represents the
  formation of a well-characterised protein complex between Scl and Lmo2.
