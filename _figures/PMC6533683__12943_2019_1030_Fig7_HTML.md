caption: NF-κB signaling pathway regulated autophagy and EMT. NF-κB activation increased
  transcriptional activation of EMT regulator genes expression via binding directly
  to the sites of EMT transcription factors, including SNAIL1, SLUG, TWIST1, and SIP1
  promoter. In addition, TNF-α–mediated stability of SNAIL protein is strengthened
  by GSK3β activity, which is dependent on NF-κB activation. Furthermore, NF-κB binding
  to MMPs promotes SNAIL transcription. NF-κB can down-regulate autophagy by inhibiting
  Beclin-1, an initiator of autophagy. However, autophagy activation suppresses ROS–NF-κB
  signaling to down-regulate MMPs expression, contributing to EMT inhibition
