caption: (a) A simplified schematic of the bile acid biosynthetic pathway. Cofactors
  are enclosed in rounded rectangles. Arrows (↓↓) denote metabolites detected with
  metabolic profiling to be significantly lower in patients relative to controls (Wilcoxon
  Rank Sum P < 0.05). Select enzymes in this pathway, bile acid CoA ligase (BAL) and
  bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT), are shown in italics. (b) A summary
  of bile acids measured in this study.
