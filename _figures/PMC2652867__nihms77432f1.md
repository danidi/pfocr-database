caption: The PML regulon model is used to explain the effects of the PML protein and
  PML nuclear bodies on survival signaling as described in the text. This is the first
  model that provides an explanation for the transcriptional independence of PML promoted
  apoptosis []. Recent data indicate that eIF4E is a node in a regulon governing cellular
  proliferation and survival []. eIF4E can promote Akt activation in a NBS1 dependent
  manner []. Furthermore, eIF4E promotes the mRNA export (and in some cases also the
  translational efficiency) of several downstream effectors of Akt as shown. Proteins
  in blue have their levels upregulated at the mRNA export level by eIF4E []. Conversely,
  PML overexpression inhibits the production of these proteins by impairing eIF4E
  dependent mRNA export of their corresponding mRNAs []. Further, PML overexpression
  impairs Akt activation by inhibiting production of NBS1 through inhibiting eIF4E
  activity []. Thus PML overexpression impairs Akt signaling at (at least) two levels
  []. Green arrows indicate that the activity of the given factor is enhanced by Akt
  and conversely, red indicates that it is inhibited. For clarity of presentation,
  the complete Akt pathway and other possible feedback loops are not depicted.
