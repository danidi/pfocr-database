caption: KSHV-induced activation of NF-κB and Notch signalling pathways involved in
  atypical spindle cell differentiation and survival. The viral proteins vFLIP and
  vGPCR mediate the atypical differentiation of endothelial cells by triggering the
  Notch signalling pathway; in addition, the vFLIP–IKKγ interaction activates the
  pro-survival NF-κB pathway.
