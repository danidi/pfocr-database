caption: 'Apoptotic signaling during SMC response to injury. The figure shows divergent
  pathways resulting in control of apoptosis, leading to different outcomes. The extrinsic
  apoptosis pathway is stimulated by signals external to the SMC, whereas the intrinsic
  apoptosis pathway is stimulated by signals internal to the SMC nucleus and /or mitochondria.
  In the extrinsic pathway, apoptosis ligands activate caspases −8 and −10 or JNK.
  The intrinsic pathway is activated by DNA damage or genetic programs and induces
  the Apaf1-caspase−9 complex directly or through the release of cytochrome c. Both
  the internal and external pathways activate caspases−3, −5, and −7 to effect apoptosis.
