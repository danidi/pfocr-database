caption: miRNA mediated regulation of Phosphate and Sulfate uptake, transport and
  assimilation in plants. (A) Phosphate (Pi) uptake is regulated by phosphate high
  affinity transporters. PHO1 and PHO2 are responsible for the xylem loading of Pi.
  PHO2 act as a negative regulator of Pi loading whereas PHO1 helps in Pi loading
  into xylem. Various miRNAs regulation under Pi starved and sufficient conditions
  are shown in orange boxes. The miR399 and isoforms act as primary regulator of Pi
  uptake, transport and assimilation by negatively regulating PHO2 under Pi starved
  conditions. Induced by phosphate starvation1 (IPS1) pairs with miR399 and causes
  its sequestration. (B) Sulfate uptake, transport and assimilation involves different
  transporters. Groups 1 and 2 sulfate transporters are involved in the sulfate uptake
  from soil to roots. Group 3 is associated with root to shoot transport of sulfate.
  The expression of various miRNAs under sulfate starved condition has been shown
  in orange boxes. miR395 has been reported to be sulfate-specific miRNA and acts
  as a primary regulator of sulfate deficient responsive pathway. Under sulfate deficient
  condition, miR395 positively regulates expression of a low affinity transporter
  AtSul2;1 to help in the sulfate uptake and transport to shoot and leaves.
