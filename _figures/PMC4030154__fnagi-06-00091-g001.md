caption: The involvement of metals and cholesterol in post-translational modification
  of APP. (A) Schematic of reported metal and cholesterol binding domains in APP770
  and Aβ in relation to other recognized motifs. APP770 is the longest isoform of
  APP with the APP751 isoform lacking the OX-2 domain and the neuron prevalent isoform
  APP695 lacking both OX-2 and Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI). Within the extracellular
  presented ectodomain of APP, the E1 region at the N-terminal contains a copper binding
  domain (CuBD) and zinc binding domain (ZnBD) that is C-terminally orientated compared
  to the growth factor domain (GFD) which incorporates a heparin binding domain (HEPBD).
  The E1 domain is followed by the acidic region (AR), KPI and OX-2 before the E2
  domain of APP, containing a HEPBD and CuBD/ZnBD that is yet to be exactly mapped
  (). The E2 domain is followed by the Aβ peptide that is partially embedded into
  the transmembrane region. Aβ also has a recognized CuBD/ZnBD as well as a Cholesterol
  binding region (CholBD) that incorporates the GXXXG motifs. (B) Proteolytic processing
  of APP predominantly follows two pathways that are initiated by separate secretases.
  The non-amyloidogenic pathway (blue arrows) initiates with the cleavage of full-length
  APP by α-secretase within the Aβ sequence. Following further cleavage by the γ-secretase
  complex, this pathway results in the generation of soluble N-terminal APP fragment
  (sAPPα) and C-terminal fragments (p3 and AICD). The alternative amyloidogenic pathway
  (red arrows) involves sequential cleavage of APP by β-secretase followed by the
  γ-secretase complex, which results in the liberation of a soluble N-terminal sAPPβ
  fragment, Aβ peptide, and AICD. Copper and zinc affect the processing of APP and
  Aβ generation on neuronal membranes through their direct influence on the enzymatic
  activity of β-, α-, and γ-secretases. The influence of cholesterol is through its
  requirement in lipid raft domains, the location for amyloidogenic processing of
  APP.
