caption: The regulatory network of lipid accumulation with significant characteristics
  in Wagyu cattle. The regulatory network comprised PPAR signaling pathway, fatty
  acid metabolism and MAPK signaling pathway in which PPAR signaling pathway and fatty
  acid metabolism were significant enrichment. The red oblongs represent the up-regulated
  genes in subcutaneous fat of Wagyu cattle. The blue oblongs represent the undifferentiated
  genes. SREBF1 and INSIG1 were reported as the target genes of PPARγ in previous
  researches. The critical part of those pathways and key genes involved were showed
  in the regulatory network. Those pathways drawn is mainly referred to the KEGG database
  (www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html)–.
