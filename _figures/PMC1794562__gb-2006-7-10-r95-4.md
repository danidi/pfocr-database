caption: Identification of a conserved metabolic network likely to be associated with
  alcohol sensitivity in flies and humans. Ethanol is converted via the alcohol dehydrogenase
  and aldehyde dehydrogenase reactions into acetate, which is subsequently conjugated
  to co-enzyme A (CoA; not shown). The biosynthetic pathway of co-enzyme A is schematically
  depicted in the red box. Acetyl-CoA produced in excess can be converted into fatty
  acids. The diagram highlights auxiliary pathways for the biosynthesis of fatty acids.
  The blue box illustrates how pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme mediate a cyclic
  metabolic pathway, which via the mitochondrial citrate and pyruvate transporters
  results in the net transport of acetyl-CoA across the mitochondrial membrane and
  generation of cytosolic NADPH, both critical substrates for fatty acid metabolism.
  An alternative metabolic pathway is the direct conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA
  via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This complex is inhibited through phosphorylation
  by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.
