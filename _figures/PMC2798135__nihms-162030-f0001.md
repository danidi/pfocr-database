caption: S. typhimurium interacts with intestinal epithelial cells from the apical
  surface and the effector protein, SipA, activates a novel signal transduction cascade
  that leads to the activation of PKC. We postulate that this PKC-dependent signal
  transduction cascade leads to the activation of iPLA2, which liberates archidonic
  acid (AA) from membranes for subsequent metabolism by the 12/15-LOX pathway culminating
  in the synthesis of HXA3 (pathway shown in blue). S. flexneri gains access to and
  interacts with the intestinal epithelium from the basolateral surface. Once inside
  the host cell, S. flexneri secretes the effector proteins OspF and OspC1 that leads
  to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. ERK1/2 activation is a prominent trigger, which
  leads to the activation of cPLA2. This enzyme releases arachidonic acid (AA) from
  membranes where ii becomes an available substrate for the 12/15-LOX pathway and
  leads to the eventual production of HXA3 (pathway shown in red).
