caption: 'Overview of mouse T cell development. (A) Stages of T cell development and
  regulatory genes active at different stages. Upper schematic: progression of stages
  from thymic entry to completion of TCR rearrangement in DP stage. For cell-surface
  markers used to define stages, see recent reviews (, ). The β-selection transition,
  in which DN3a cells pass quickly through the DN3b, DN4, and immature single positive
  (Imm SP) stages before arriving at the DP stage, is only triggered in cells that
  have successfully rearranged their Tcrb gene loci to express an in-frame TCRβ protein.
  To focus on steps leading to confirmation of T-cell identity, the figure omits alternative
  branches of T-cell development leading the TCRγδ cells and the positive and negative
  selection events that lead to functional sub-specialization after successful rearrangement
  of the Tcra locus to express TCRαβ dimers in the DP stage. Transcription factors
  and growth factor receptors listed are chosen as those known to play functional
  roles in aspects of normal or leukemic T cell development (see (, )). Gene names
  in parentheses denote expression at at lower levels or lower activity states than
  in stages where they are listed without parentheses. (B) Relationship of T-cell
  precursors to other hematopoietic fates. The figure presents a compromise view of
  the main inputs to the T-cell pathway relative to MPPs, LMPPs, and myeloid or erythroid-committed
  cell types. The yellow background and boldface type highlight stages that are in
  the pathway to generate T cells. For simplicity, pathways leading to eosinophils,
  basophils, and mast cells and the complexities of precursor relationships in the
  Innate Lymphoid Cell (ILC)—Natural Killer (NK) and Dendritic cell (DC) pathways
  are omitted. As described in the text, the roles of certain restricted progenitors
  in the erythromyeloid lineages are still controversial (dashed arrows). The main
  pathways indicated here are supported by recent single-cell analyses (, ).'
