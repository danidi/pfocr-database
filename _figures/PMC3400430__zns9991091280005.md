caption: Heuristic models of the interaction between mGluR5 and FMRP. Illustrated
  are simple logical relationships between FMRP and mGluR5-stimulated synaptic protein
  synthesis. A, a model in which FMRP or an FMRP-regulated protein specifically inhibits
  the signaling pathway that couples mGluR5 to translation. B, An alternative model
  in which signaling is unaffected in the absence of FMRP, but the consequences on
  protein synthesis are exaggerated. The results of the current investigation favor
  model B.
