caption: The mTOR signaling pathway and Rapalog therapeutic mechanisms. mTOR modulates
  a variety of cellular activities through mTORC1 and mTORC2. MTOR can respond to
  extracellular stimuli, such as cytokines, growth factors and DNA stress, which mainly
  regulate cell growth, cell cycle, and other physiological activities through PI3K/Akt/mTOR
  pathway. Normally, TSC1/TSC2 forms a dimer complex, which is an inhibitor of small
  GTPase Rheb, and Rheb is a necessary stimulating protein for mTOR activation. Hence
  the mTORC1 activity is critically inhibited by TSC1/TSC2 complex. When Akt is activated,
  it can phosphorylate ser939 and thr1462 of TSC2 and inhibit the formation of TSC1/TSC2
  complex, thus relieving the inhibition of Rheb, then activated Rheb sensitized mTOR
  function. Additionally, PI3K activates the ribosome to increase mTORC2 reaction.
  In a word, PI3K promotes the mTOR activates. Another important pathway of mTOR is
  regulated by AMPK. Firstly, AMPK directly phosphorylates Raptor to inhibit mTORC1
  activity. Raptor is the downstream molecule of AMPK, and TSC2 is not involved in
  this process. Secondly, AMPK can also activate TSC1/TSC2 complex and inhibit mTORC1
  activity as described above. Therefore, unlike the PI3K, AMPK restrains the mTOR
  function. Rapalogs can combine the FKBP12 and inhibit the kinase activity of mTORC1
  and mTORC2, ultimately regulate various biological functions of cells, that is the
  mechanism of mTOR inhibitors. Arrows indicate activation and bars represent inhibition.
