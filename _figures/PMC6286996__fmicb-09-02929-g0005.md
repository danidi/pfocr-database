caption: 'Metabolic response of E. coli pBIC-1a to imipenem exposure. Activation of
  the electron transport chain pathway dependent on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
  was observed, and is thought to generate ROS according to the model proposed by
  Kohanski et al. and Dwyer et al. (Kohanski et al., ; Dwyer et al., ). We observed
  an up-regulation of most of the TCA cycle enzymes, of many genes involved in Iron–Sulfur
  cluster biogenesis and assembly, and of several metal ions permeases that are assumed
  to fuel the Fenton reaction. Detoxification process occured to limit protein damages
  and ROS accumulation with up-regulation of superoxide dismutase sodA. Several genes
  involved in bacterial cell wall homeostasis were disturbed. Activation of the plasmidic
  murein endopeptidase mepM might modify bacterial peptidoglycan and reflect an early
  activation of bacterial lysis. Transcriptional regulators are written in bold. ↑
  means up-regulated and ↓ means down-regulated. LPS, lipopolysaccharide; OM, outer
  membrane; IM, inner membrane. Reactions of the TCA cycle: 1. Pyruvate dehydrogenase,
  2. Citrate synthase, 3. Aconitase, 4. Isocitrate dehydrogenase, 5. α-ketoglutarate
  dehydrogenase, 6. SuccinylCoA thiokinase, 7.Succinate dehydrogenase, 8. Fumarate
  reductase 9. Fumarase, 10. Malate dehydrogenase.'
