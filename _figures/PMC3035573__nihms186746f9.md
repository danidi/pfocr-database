caption: Thrombin activates both PAR1 and PAR4 following vascular injury. PAR1 activates
  Gαi/o, Gαq, and Gα12/13, whereas PAR4 activates Gαq and Gα12/13. All three of these
  G proteins play a role in platelet aggregation. Additionally, through secretion
  of the dense granules, ADP is released and acts as an autocrine signal on the P2Y12
  receptor. PAR4 signaling calcium mobilization downstream of phospholipase Cβ through
  the Gαqpathway converges with signaling through the P2Y12pathway to induce platelet
  aggregation. Finally, Rap1 activation is partially dependent on P2Y12signaling but
  may also be activated directly through PAR1 or PAR4 most likely through signaling
  in the Gαq or Gα12/13pathway.
