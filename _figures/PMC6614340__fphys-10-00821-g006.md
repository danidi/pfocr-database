caption: Signaling pathways involved in α-CGRP-induced vasodilation. (A) In NO- and
  endothelium-independent pathway, binding of α-CGRP to its receptor, CLR, increases
  intracellular cAMP level through G-protein coupled adenylate cyclase (AC). The increased
  cAMP level activates protein kinase A (PKA), and that in turn phosphorylates and
  opens K+-ATP channels and thus relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells. (B) NO-
  and endothelium-dependent vasodilatation to α-CGRP. α-CGRP through its receptors
  activates eNOS enzyme via Gαs-adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA pathway, and thus increases
  the synthesis of NO in the endothelial cells. From the endothelial cells NO freely
  diffuses to the smooth muscle cells activating guanylate cyclase and increasing
  intracellular cGMP level. These events activate and phosphorylate K-ATP channel
  that leads to relaxation of smooth muscle cells. cGMP has also been reported to
  mediate its vasodilation action through cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG), phosphodiesterases
  (PDEs), and cGMP-gated ion channels. NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway efflux intracellular
  potassium through BK-K channel, promotes hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane,
  and thereby decreases influx of calcium through L-type Ca+2 channels. PKG also can
  efflux intracellular calcium through the plasma membrane Ca+2-ATPase pump. This,
  in turn, decreases the contractile state of smooth muscle cells.
