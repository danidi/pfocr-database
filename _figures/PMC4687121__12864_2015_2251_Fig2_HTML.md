caption: Pathways implicated by the gene expression differences in YAC128 mouse striata.
  List of differentially expressed genes were generated by t-test using a nominal
  p < 0.01; DAVID was used for the pathway analysis with a pathway filter q < 0.05.
  The pathway node size is proportional to gene membership and the edges joining nodes
  are weighted by gene overlap between nodes. Terms have been clustered into groups
  that contain 90 % genetic similarity on average. The most significant term of the
  cluster has been displayed. These terms have been further clustered at a level of
  50 % average genetic similarity and colour-coded by cluster

papertitle: Similar striatal gene expression profiles in the striatum of the YAC128
  and HdhQ150 mouse models of Huntington’s disease are not reflected in mutant Huntingtin
  inclusion prevalence.
