caption: P. gingivalis has surface structures that interact with Toll-like receptor
  (TLR)-2 (specifically with the CD14–TLR2–TLR1 signaling complex) and with TLR4.
  The activation of TLR4, however, is blocked by the bacterium’s atypical lipopolysaccharide
  which acts as an antagonist; therefore, TLR4 is unlikely to induce protective responses.
  The TLR2 response is proactively modified through crosstalk with other receptors
  that are under P. gingivalis control. P. gingivalis regulates C5a receptor (C5aR)
  by virtue of Arg-specific cysteine proteinases, which attack C5 and release biologically
  active C5a. C5a stimulates intracellular Ca2+signaling which synergistically enhances
  the otherwise weak cAMP responses induced by TLR2 activation alone. Maximal cAMP
  induction requires the participation of CXC-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), which
  is activated directly by the bacterium’s fimbriae. The resulting activation of the
  cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β)
  and inhibits the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-dependent killing of the
  pathogen in macrophages. An additional pathway induced downstream of TLR2 is an
  inside-out signaling pathway, mediated by RAC1, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
  and cytohesin 1 (CYT1), which transactivates complement receptor-3 (CR3). Activated
  CR3 binds P. gingivalis and induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/ERK2
  signaling, which in turn selectively downregulates IL-12 p35 and p40 mRNA expression
  through suppression of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Inhibition of bioactive
  IL-12, and secondarily IFNγ, leads to impaired immune clearance of P. gingivalis.From
