caption: Alanine metabolism pathway in M. tuberculosis. L-alanine-dehydrogenase catalyzes
  the NAD-dependent interconversion between L-alanine and pyruvate. Under aerobic
  conditions this reaction allows for the utilization of L-alanine as a nitrogen source,
  whereas under hypoxic conditions this reaction allows for NADH recycling to NAD+.
  Separately, the initial step of peptidoglycan synthesis involves conversion of L-alanine
  to D-alanine by alanine racemase. Two D-alanine molecules are joined by D-ala-D-ala
  ligase to produce the dipeptide D-alanine-D-alanine, which is subsequently incorporated
  into the pentapeptide chain of the peptidoglycan cell wall. Both alanine racemase
  and D-ala-D-ala ligase are competitively inhibited by D-cycloserine, an analog of
  D-alanine.
