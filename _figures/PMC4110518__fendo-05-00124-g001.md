caption: The cellular origin of thyroid carcinomas is shown. According to the multistep
  carcinogenesis model, TC originates from follicular cells as a consequence of multiple
  mutations accumulated throughout their life-span. Thyrocytes could give rise to
  PTC by RAS and BRAF mutations or RET/PTC and NTRK1 rearrangements and to FTC by
  point mutations of the RAS gene and PAX8/PPARγ rearrangement. ATC derive from PTC
  and FTC after deregulation of the p53 and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In fetal cell
  carcinogenesis model, three types of fetal thyroid cells were proposed to generate
  different forms of thyroid cancer. Fetal thyroid stem cells, characterized by expression
  of the oncofetal fibronectin (OF), generate ATC, thyroblasts, which express OF and
  the differentiation marker Tg, are proposed to be the cellular origin of PTC. The
  more differentiated prothyrocytes, expressing Tg, give rise to FTC. The cancer stem
  cells model proposes TC as an SC disease. The accumulation of mutations in differentiated
  thyrocytes leads to their transformation. A subset of these cells may (in more aggressive
  tumor types) dedifferentiate and assume CSC characteristics.
