caption: 'Schematic representation of the p38MAPKsignalling pathway. A variety of
  extracellular signals, such as cellular stresses and pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  can activate the p38MAPKpathway. These lead to the initiation of a three-tiered
  MAPK phosphorylation cascade in which MAPKKKs phosphorylate the p38MAPK-specific
  MAPKKs MKK3, MKK4 or MKK6. These subsequently phosphorylate four isoforms of p38MAPK
  (α, β, δ and γ) and three alternatively spliced variants of p38α and p38β: Mxi2,
  Exip (both p38α variants, dark blue boxes) and p38β2 (p38β variant, pale blue boxes).
  Of note, only ASK1 can activate MKK4, which specifically activates p38α, and MKK6
  preferentially phosphorylates p38β. It is not known which MKKs phosphorylate the
  splice variants (dashed line). p38MAPK substrates can be isoform-specific or common
  to all isoforms. Substrates are coloured according to function: protein kinases
  (purple), transcription factors (orange) and cytosolic and nuclear proteins (green).
  Phosphorylated substrates go on to elicit varied biological responses that include
  inflammation, apoptosis, proliferation, cell-cycle regulation and differentiation.
  Dashed lines indicate potential links yet to be confirmed. Abbreviations: ASK1,
  Apoptosis signalling kinase 1; CHOP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein;

  protein kinase; p75NTR: p75 neurotrophin; STAT1, signal transducer and activator
