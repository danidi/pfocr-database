caption: Mitochondrial homeostasis is ensured through the coordination of mitochondrial
  biogenesis, dynamics, and autophagy. After appropriate stimuli (such as exercise
  stimulus), the upregulation of proliferator-activated receptor- γ co-activator 1α
  (PGC1α) and other transcription factors (TFs) activates the transcription of nuclear
  genes encoding mitochondrial proteins such as mitochondrial transcription factor
  A (TFAM). TFAM is then imported into mitochondria by the protein import machinery
  and reaches its final destination on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Here, TFAM upregulates
  the expression of genes encoding electron transport chain subunits, resulting in
  increased oxygen consumption, ATP synthesis, and mitochondrial content. Changes
  in mitochondrial morphology are under the control of fusion (mitofusin 1 (MFN1),
  MFN2, and mitochondrial dynamin-like 120 kDa protein (OPA1)) and fission (dynamin
  1-like protein (DNM1L) and mitochondrial fission 1 protein (FIS1)) proteins. These
  factors regulate mitochondrial turnover by facilitating the dilution and clearance
  of damaged organelles. Mitochondrial components are eventually recycled through
  a specialized autophagic pathway, known as mitophagy. LC3,microtubule-associated
  proteins 1A/1B light chain 3; NRF1, nuclear respiratory factor 1; NRF2, nuclear
