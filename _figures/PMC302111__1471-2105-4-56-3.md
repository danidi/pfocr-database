number: Figure 3
caption: Calvin Cycle Pathway associated with gene expressions. The green ellipse
  is EC number, colored rectangular box is gene expression computed as the mean value
  of the probes that belong to the EC number. The long text box near EC 5.1.3.1 is
  the tool tip showing the enzyme name of EC 5.1.3.1. The user can click EC to open
  a new page to explore the enzyme details.
