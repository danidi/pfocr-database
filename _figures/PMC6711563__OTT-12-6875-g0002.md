caption: (A) In an adult cell, Hh pathway is always silent or poorly activated. Patched
  1 (PTCH1) could inhibit the smoothened receptor (SMO), and then suppress the phosphorylation
  of glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI), and the dissociation from the suppressor
  of fused (SUFU), to from GLI repressor (GLIR), which translocates to the nucleus
  to suppress the expression of target genes, including Bcl-2, AKT, mTOR, VEGF. The
  link between Hh pathway and human cancers has long been recognized. (B) In a cancer
  cell, Hh is overexpressed, its ligands, such as SHh ligand, are released to bind
  with PTCH1 immediately, thereby alleviating the inhibition of SMO by PTCH. The activated
  SMO is then translocated from vesicles to the primary cilium of the cell membrane,
  in order to activate GLI, which is activated through mediating the dissociation
  of GLI proteins from the SUFU. This allows the translocation of GLI proteins to
  the nucleus where they bind DNA and regulate the transcription of their target genes.
  In addition, Itraconazole (ITZ) could inhibit the accumulation of SMO, as well as,
  ITZ could also inhibit GLI directly, these lead to the inhibition of target genes
  to treat cancer.
