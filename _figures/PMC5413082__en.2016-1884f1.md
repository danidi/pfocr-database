caption: Schematic of growth hormone and IGF-1 axis. At the hypothalamus, GHRH and
  somatostatin (SS) regulate GH release from the anterior pituitary. GH action at
  the liver stimulates IGF-1 secretion, which can act on peripheral tissues. Ghrelin
  is secreted from the stomach and promotes GH secretion through direct action at
  the pituitary or indirectly through its actions on hypothalamic regulatory hormones.
  Circulating IGF-1 from the liver enters the hippocampus and has actions described
  by Trueba-Saiz et al. (). It is unknown how circulating GH, ghrelin, or IGF-1 may
  affect hippocampal GH or GH-R. It is also unknown how circulating GH and ghrelin
  may affect the pathway described by Trueba-Saiz et al. (). Canonical signaling cascades
  are shown with solid lines. An arrowhead indicates stimulation, and a bar-headed
  lines indicates inhibition. Unknown actions of hippocampal GH and GH-R are surrounded
  by dashed lines. Additionally, unknown signaling cascades are indicated by dashed
  lines.
