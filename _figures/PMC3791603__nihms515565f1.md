caption: Hh signaling in animals. (A) Hh production is highly conserved between Drosophila
  and mammals (middle). Autocatalytic cleavage of the Hh precursor protein yields
  a cholesterol-modified signaling peptide (HhN), which is further palmitoylated by
  Skinny Hedgehog (Ski), then released from the cell by Disp (Drosophila) or Disp1
  (mammals). In Drosophila (left), the released lipophilic HhN is incorporated into
  lipophorin complexes (not shown) and distributed to other cells with the help of
  heparan sulfate proteoglycans (Dally and Dlp; also not shown). The suppressive action
  of Ptc or Ptch1 on Smo is conserved in Hh-responsive cells from Drosophila (left)
  and mammals (right). Members of the CDO receptor family (not shown), including Ihog,
  facilitate Hh binding and inhibition of Ptc or Ptch1, allowing activation of Smo.
  In Drosophila, Dlp also appears to facilitate Hh response. Smo-mediated regulation
  of Ci (Drosophila) or Gli (mammals) nuclear localization and proteolytic processing
  into a repressor (CiR or Gli3R) depends on Cos2, Fu, and Su(fu) in Drosophila, and
  proteins that function in the primary cilium in mammals. The mechanism by which
  Smo inhibits the pathway suppressor Su(fu) in mammals is unknown. (B) Tumors with
  aberrant Hh pathway activity in Gorlin’s syndrome, as well as their sporadic counterparts,
  frequently harbor mutations in Ptch1. Other tumors for which molecular lesions have
  not been defined also exhibit aberrant Hh pathway response. References for most
  of the tumors described here can be found in ().
