caption: A proposed model is that CD146 promotes angiogenesis and mesenchymal cell
  migration in melanoma. CD146 possibly induces angiogenesis through the NF-κB p50-IL-6-VEGF
  signalling pathway. In addition, CD-146 induced IL-6 positively regulates the expression
  of Wnt5a. In response to the Wnt5a signal, the CD146/Fz3/DVL2 complex is recruited
  to the tail end of the cell by means of MVB or ER where it assembles actin and myosinII
  filaments to form the WRAMP structure, which directs tail-end membrane retraction.
