caption: 'Thiamine metabolism. (A) Chemical structure of thiamine and phosphorylated
  derivatives. (B) Absorption and cellular uptake of thiamine. Dietary thiamine is
  mainly in the form of phosphate derivatives and, before absorption, these are converted
  to free thiamine by intestinal phosphatases. Mammalians utilize THTR1 and THTR2
  to transport thiamine. The THTR1 appears to function in the micromolar range, whereas
  the THTR-2 appears to function in the nanomolar range. Both transporters are expressed
  in the human small and large intestine, and the expression of THTR1 is higher than
  that of THTR2, with THTR1 found at both the apical and basolateral membranes of
  enterocytes (somewhat higher expression at the latter compared to the former domain).
  Expression of the THTR2 protein was found to be restricted to the apical membrane
  domain only [see () and references therein]. Free thiamine is converted to TPP by
  the action of TPK1 in the cytosol and dephosphorylation of TPP to TMP and thiamine
  by ACPP. At higher concentrations of thiamine, simple passive diffusion takes place
  [see () and references therein]. From blood, thiamine is taken up by either transporter
  (THTR1 or THTR2). Both carriers are widely distributed in the body, but the levels
  differ in different tissues. Once inside the target cells, thiamine is phosphorylated
  to TPP by TPK1 and to TTP by TDPK. Both TPP and TTP can be dephosphorylated by ACPP
  and THTPA, respectively. TPP in the cytosol is utilized as a cofactor for TKT, but
  it is also required as a cofactor in the mitochondrial compartment; hence, the mitochondrial
  SLC25A19 exists at the inner mitochondrial membrane. TPP must be bound to HACL1
  and HACL2 for its transport to the peroxisomes. Abbreviations: ACPP, prostatic acid
  phosphatase; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate; T, thiamine; TDPK, thiamine diphosphokinase; THTPA, thiamine triphosphatase;
  THTR, thiamine transporter; TMP, thiamine monophosphate; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate.
  (C) Pathways involving TPP-dependent enzymes. In the cytosol, TPP is the cofactor
  of transketolase (TKT), an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
  The PPP produces nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ribose
  5-phosphate (R5P), essential for antioxidant defense and fatty acid synthesis, and
  precursor in the biosynthesis of nucleotides, respectively. In mitochondria, TPP
  acts as a cofactor for branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex,
  pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. In peroxisomes,
  TPP is a cofactor for 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1 (HACL1) as part of the fatty acid
  α-oxidation pathway.'
