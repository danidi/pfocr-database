caption: Schema showing proposed outline of the signaling events post-e-cigarette
  (e-cig) inhalation. Non-nicotinized e-cig inhalation as an initiator of vascular
  inflammation and oxidative stress. The detrimental chemical species that are inhaled
  from e-cig trigger an endothelial signaling pathway that drives inflammation and
  oxidative stress and also increases the inflammatory burden of the circulating blood.
