caption: (A) CL biosynthesis occurs exclusively in the mitochondria. CL precursor,
  PA, is transported from the OMM to the IMM via Ups1/Mdm35 to initiate the CL biosynthetic
  pathway. PA is converted to PG through three subsequent enzyme-catalyzed reactions
  by Tam41, Pgs1, and Gep4. Crd1 biosynthesizes nascent CL (CLp) from PG. CLp must
  then be remodeled to form mature CL (CLm) through sequential deacylation and reacylation
  reactions catalyzed by Cld1 and Taz1, respectively. Taz1 is localized to the OMM
  and the IMM facing the IMS. (B) Structures of CLp, MLCL, and CLm. ATP, adenosine
  triphosphate; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; CTP, cytidine triphosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate;
  CDP-DAG, cytidine diphosphate-diacylglycerol; CMP, cytidine monophosphate; PA, phosphatidic
  acid; CLp, premature cardiolipin; CLm, mature cardiolipin; MLCL, monolysocardiolipin;
  PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PGP, phosphatidylglycerol phosphate; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate;
  PL, phospholipid; FA, fatty acid; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; IMM, inner
  mitochondrial membrane; IMS, intermembrane space.
