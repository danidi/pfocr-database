caption: Target sites of therapeutics along the pathogenetic pathway of celiac disease.
  Sites of action of therapeutic approaches under investigation (enclosed in black
  boxes) are shown at different levels of the pathogenetic pathway of celiac disease.
  Green arrows in the figure depict a stimulatory effect. The oligomers (G) formed
  from gluten digestion enter the lamina propria of the small intestine across the
  epithelial barrier. They do so by a paracellular pathway that involves the protein
  zonulin. Zonulin is structurally similar to the zona occludens toxin expressed by
  Vibrio cholera and regulates epithelial permeability at apical tight junctions.
  In the zonulin pathway, gluten products attach to the chemokine receptor CXCR3 on
  the luminal aspect of the intestinal epithelium that increases the formation of
  zonulin. The zonulin then relaxes the interepithelial tight junctions through the
  PAR2/EGFR (Protease activated receptor 2/Epithelial Growth Factor Receptor) pathway.
  This increased permeability in turn leads to influx of gliadin. An alternative pathway
  implicated in gliadin uptake is the transcellular pathway involving secretory IgA
  (Immunoglobluin A) and CD71. CD71 or transferrin receptor is found to be expressed
  in higher amounts on the luminal aspect of intestinal epithelial cells in CeD. The
  CD71 co- localizes with secretory IgA and has been postulated to promote transcellular
  gliadin uptake into the lamina propria in CeD. Zonulin antagonists, CXCR3 antagonists,
  and sIgA/CD71 pathway antagonists would prevent gliadin transport through either
  of these two pathways. Once the gluten immunogenic epitopes are transferred into
  the lamina propria, the HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8 bearing antigen presenting cells (APCs)
  recognize the epitopes. Consequently, APCs activate CD4+ helper T cells, setting
  off an inflammatory cascade. Cathepsins play a role in processing the antigens in
  APCs and promoting the interaction between APCs and CD4+ T cells. Cytokines like
  IFN-γ and TNF-α are released by activated CD4+ cells, which further aggravate this
  permeability and facilitate a self-propagating mechanism. T-cells also activate
  B-cells which mature to produce antibodies against gluten and tissue transglutaminase−2
  (celiac antibodies). HLA-DQ blockers, anti-cytokine therapy, and cathepsin inhibitors
  are some of the therapeutic approaches being explored. In addition, the tissue transglutaminase-2
  (tTG-2) enzyme deamidates the glutamine residues to glutamate in gliadin. The resulting
  deamidated gliadin peptides are more immunogenic. Also, by virtue of the relatively
  large size of these partially digested, negatively charged proline containing fragments,
  they tend to settle and form bonds with neighboring tissues resulting in immobilized
  neoepitopes. Thus, these peptides form immunoreactive autoantigens and enteropathy
  ensues. tTg-2 enzyme inhibitors are being explored as therapeutic options. The immunotoxicity
  is mediated by the increased production of interleukin-15 (IL-15) by the intestinal
  epithelial cells as well as by the intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) in CeD. IL-15
  upregulates the receptor NKG2D (Natural Killer Group) expression on IEL which interacts
  with MIC-A and MIC-B (MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A and B) displayed
  on epithelial cells. IELs in patients with CeD also express an NK receptor called
  CD94/NKG2C. CD94/NKG2C recognizes HLA-E, a protein that is upregulated in epithelial
  cells in response to Interferon- γ (IFN-γ). The interaction of these two ligand-
  receptor pairs activates the IELs and triggers them to kill epithelial cells through
  perforins. Among other therapeutic options, gluten from wheat may be rendered non-immunogenic
  by genetic modification. Attenuation of immunotoxicity has also been attempted using
  microwave energy application on hydrated wheat kernels or by gluten modification
  either using glutenases from fungi or bacteria or using microbial transglutaminase.
  Alternatively, gliadin in gluten may be sequestered in the intestinal lumen using
  polymeric binders, AGY or oral Immunoglobulin Y, and recombinant single chain Fragment
  variable.
