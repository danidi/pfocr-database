caption: The activation of a cell surface receptor induces the recruitment and oligomerization
  of adapter proteins and E3 ligases, such as TRAF6 or LUBAC, which in turn synthesize
  non-degradative Ub chains (K11, K63, and M1) attached to various adaptor proteins,
  or to themselves. Subsequently, TAK1 and IKK complexes are recruited to upstream
  ubiquitin polymers through ubiquitin-binding domains. After IKK complex recruitment,
  NEMO is modified with poly- and mono-ubiquitin, and IKKs are phosphorylated in their
  T-loop either by TAK1 or through trans-autophosphorylation. IKK activation results
  in phosphorylation of IκB and p65. IκB phosphorylation leads to its ubiquitin-mediated
  proteasomal degradation, enabling NF-κB dimers translocation to the nucleus, where
  they bind to DNA and induce transcription. In addition, IKKs phosphorylate a variety
  of other substrates, resulting in crosstalk with other, NF-κB independent regulatory
  systems in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Table).
