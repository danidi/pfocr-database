caption: The duplication of EsCBL10 increased the complexity of signaling in response
  to salt. In Arabidopsis, AtSOS3 and AtCBL10 interact with and activate the protein
  kinase AtSOS2, which, in turn, activates the sodium-proton exchanger AtSOS1 (AtSOS
  pathway) in the plasma membrane (PM). AtSOS1 then transports sodium out of the cell,
  preventing its toxic accumulation. AtSOS3 and AtCBL10 have additional functions
  outside of activation of the AtSOS pathway. Homologs were identified in Eutrema
  and one gene, EsCBL10, has been duplicated. EsCBL10b has an enhanced ability to
  activate the SOS pathway and complements the Atcbl10 salt-sensitive phenotype. EsCBL10a
  complements both the Atcbl10 and Atsos3 salt-sensitive phenotypes but only weakly
  activates the SOS pathway. EsSOS3 activates the SOS pathway and complements the
  Atsos3 salt-sensitive phenotype.
