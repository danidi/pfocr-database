caption: MDV DNA or tumor-derived DNA is recognized by cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS,
  which produces cGAMP for STING activation and IFN-β production. However, the MDV
  oncoprotein Meq interacts with STING and IRF7, which disrupts assembly of the STING-TBK1-IRF7
  complex, thereby leading to the inhibition of IRF7 activation and IFN-β induction
  during MDV infection. Additionally, STING is involved in the melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5 (MDA5) signaling pathway against RNA viruses as well as the innate immunity
  against bacteria. As an inhibitor of the cGAS-STING signaling, Meq could exert its
  immunomodulatory functions in the innate immune responses against not only DNA viruses
  but also RNA-related pathogens and various bacteria.
