caption: 'Graphical summary: DNA repair proteins such as DNA-PKcs can be targeted
  to improve outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancers with defects
  in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway are initially sensitive to platinum
  treatment, and also respond to Olaparib that targets the base excision repair pathway
  protein PARP. For the majority of cases, which are HR proficient, platinum-based
  chemotherapy is still utilized but resistance is likely. For patients with platinum-resistant
  disease, inhibition of DNA-PKcs, a key component of the non-homologous end joining
  pathway, represents a targeted approach to prevent the pro-survival AKT and anti-apoptotic
  signaling associated with resistance.'
