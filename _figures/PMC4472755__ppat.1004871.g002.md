caption: 'During each asexual cycle within the human blood, a small proportion of
  parasites cease to replicate asexually and instead produce sexual progeny that develop
  into nonreplicating gametocytes, capable of onward transmission to the mosquito
  vector. Commitment to the sexual pathway occurs at a low “baseline” rate during
  each asexual replication cycle [,], and the decision to switch is thought to be
  made prior to schizogony during the previous asexual replication cycle [–]. The
  switch to gametocytogenesis is governed by the essential transcription factor PfAP2-G
  (), which is epigenetically controlled byPfHda2 and PfHP1 [,]. PfHda2 likely promotes
  transcriptional silencing by removing acetyl groups on histones, thereby allowing
  methylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9). PfHP1 may subsequently bind H3K9me, leading
  to heterochromatin formation and Pfap2-g repression. The perinuclear protein Pfgdv1
  is another key player that likely operates upstream of PfAP2-G. Pfgdv1 is expressed
  in a subset of schizonts, is associated with an increased expression of genes involved
  in early gametocytogenesis, and has been shown to be critical for gametocyte production
  []. The Nima-related kinase Pfnek4 may also play a role in sexual commitment, as
  the kinase is expressed in a subpopulation of schizonts that display a higher sexual
  conversion rate []. Pfnek4 is, however, not strictly gametocyte specific and can
  be genetically deleted without affecting gametocyte formation []. Although constitutively
  silenced in asexual parasites, Pfap2-g could be prone to stochastic activation,
  resulting in a low level of gametocyte formation. Once initiated, the transcription
  of Pfap2-g may be further activated via a positive feedback loop. The baseline conversion
  rate can be altered by various factors: those that are derived from the parasites
  themselves (found within conditioned medium from high-parasitemia in vitro cultures)
  and those that are exogenous (antimalarial drugs, anemia, elevated reticulocyte
  levels, and host immune factors). Enhanced conversion by external factors is extensively
  reviewed elsewhere []. It has recently been demonstrated that the conditioned medium
  effect is the result of cellular communication within the parasite population via
  pRBC-derived microvesicles () [,].'
