caption: Schematic diagram of amino acid metabolism pathways in tea plants. P1&2,
  amino acids were derived from Glu pathway consisting of Glu, Gln, Arg, Pro and Thea.
  P3, amino acids were derived from Asp pathway consisting of Asp, Thr, Ile, Met,
  Lys, Asn. P4, amino acids were derived from pyruvate pathway consisting of Val and
  Leu. P5, amino acids were derived from aromatic amino acid pathway consisting of
  Trp, Phe and Tyr. P6, amino acids were derived from 3-phosphoglycerate pathway consisting
  of Cys, Ser and Gly. Glu, glutamate; Gln, glutamine; Arg, arginine; Pro, proline;
  Thea, theanine; Asp, aspartate; Thr, threonine; Lys, lysine; Ile, isoleucine; Aspn,
  asparagine; Val, Valine; Leu, Leucine; Trp, tryptophan; Phe, Phenylalanine; Tyr,
  Tyrosine; Cys, cysteine; Gly, Glycine; Ser, serine.
