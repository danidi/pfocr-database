caption: Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated in
  several approaches. Pathogens especially bacteria will lead to increase of DAMPs
  and PAMPs, which will be sensed by NLRP3 protein as well as other pattern-recognition
  receptors like TLRs. The recognition by TLRs will activate NF-κB pathway and allow
  the host cell to get into the primed state, where the translation of proinflammatory
  cytokines is enhanced. The open of P2X7, an ATP-gated ion channel, will lead to
  K+ efflux which can also activate NLRP3 inflammasome directly. With the presence
  of gap junction protein pannexin-1, the influx of DAMPs and PAMPs will also increase.
  For irritants with large size like MSU crystals, they will be transported through
  lipid vesicles and merge with lysosomes. The crystals will result in lysosomal rupture
  and in turn activate NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, the production of ROS is increased
  in the recognition of DAMPs and PAMPs as well as lysosomal rupture. Eventually,
  intensive oxidative stress also initiates the activation. Assembled NLRP3 inflammasome
  will cleave raw cytokine materials with activated caspase-1 and release the mature
  interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) which cause inflammation and pyroptosis.
