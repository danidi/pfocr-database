  figure shows a schematic representation of the patulin biosynthesis pathway [],
  which was fully curated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. This pathway map was reconstructed
  using the 2D structures from ChEBI, the reactions provided by Rhea and their corresponding
  enzymes as annotated in UniProtKB (identifiers for each are indicated). UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
  also provides additional data such as the subcellar location of each protein when
  known. The solid arrows indicate enzymatic reactions; the dashed arrows indicate
  transport reactions. The subcellular location of the enzymes illustrates the importance
  of compartmentalization for natural product biosynthesis []. All UniProtKB entry
  proteins involved in the patulin biosynthesis pathway can be retrieved using the
