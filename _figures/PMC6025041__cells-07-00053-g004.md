caption: Schematic representation of the main metabolic pathways influenced (positively
  and/or negatively) by transcriptional factor O-GlcNAcylation. The figure depicts,
  from a schematic point of view, the transcriptional factors whose stability, transcriptional
  activation, DNA binding ability and protein–protein interaction is regulated by
  direct O-GlcNAcylation and the metabolic pathways influenced by their O-GlcNAcylation.
  The colored square around the indicated metabolic pathways is related to the specific
  transcriptional factor that upon O-GlcNAcylation is able to control the pathway.
