caption: 1. Recognition of chitin released from fungal cell wall by LysM-RLK1 receptor.
  2. Increase of intra-cellular calcium leading to the activation of the NADPH oxidases
  AtrbohD and F at the membrane initiating the production of ROS and activation of
  a MAPK cascade(s). 3. Induction of ATL9 and insertion into the ER membrane. We propose
  that ATL9 is involved tagging an inhibitor of plant defense for degradation by the
  proteosome 4. Defense response to fungal pathogen is activated after inhibitor degradation.
  5. The ATL9 protein is rapidly degraded in the cell by either the proteosome pathway
  or a calcium-mediated pathway (similar to the mammalian protein calpain).
