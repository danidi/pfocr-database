caption: The Drosophila Hippo pathway Network. (A,A′) Compared to Wild type (A), loss
  of function of Hippo pathway genes wtsX1 (eyFLP; FRT82B cl w+/FRT82B wtsX1) causes
  significant overgrowth of the Drosophila head. (A,B) Schematic diagram of the Hippo
  pathway in Drosophila. Cells are shown with Sub-apical region and basolateral junctions.
  Hippo pathway components in Drosophila are shown in different colors, with pointed
  and blunt arrowheads indicating activating and inhibitory interactions, respectively.
  Continuous lines indicate known interactions, whereas dashed lines indicate unknown
  mechanisms. See text for further details. Crb, Crumbs; Dco, Disks overgrown; Dlg,
