caption: Model of amino acid and growth factor activation of mTORC1 mediated by PLD1-PA.
  Amino acids induce elevation of cytoplasmic PLD activity and PA production. PA-containing
  endosomes promote the transport of mTORC1 to the lysosome ( and ). It is not clear
  how exogenously supplied PA recruits mTORC1 to the lysosome as indicated by the
  question marks, but the PLD requirement for amino acid-induced mTORC1 translocation
  () suggests a role for PA in both the trafficking and activation of mTORC1. On the
  lysosome, mTORC1 binds to amino acid–activated Rags, which lock mTORC1 at the subcellular
  compartment. Amino acids also induce translocation of PLD 1 from the cytoplasm to
  the lysosome where it colocalizes with mTOR and Rheb (). Upon growth factor stimulation,
  Rheb is activated, binds to, and elevates PLD activity. Increased PA production
  at the lysosome prevents mTOR from leaving the compartment and allows complete activation
  of mTORC1 ( and ). Precancerous cells caused by loss of the TSC complex exploit
  permanent activation of the pathway Rheb–PLD–PA–mTORC1 at the lysosome to thrive
  in nutrient-poor conditions ( and ). Full activation of mTORC1 in response to amino
  acids and growth factors happens when both Rags and PA operate simultaneously ().
