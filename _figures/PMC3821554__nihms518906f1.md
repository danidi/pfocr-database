caption: The TGF-β signaling pathway is regulated at multiple points by ubiquitin-mediated
  targeting and proteasomal degradation. Receptors, adaptor proteins, Smads, co-activator/co-repressor
  and DNA binding co-factors are targeted by E3 ubiquitin ligases for ubiquitination
  and degredation by the proteasome. These protein degredation pathways impart precise
  and specific control over the cellular response to TGF-β signaling.
