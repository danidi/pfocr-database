caption: Leishmania exosomes deliver preemptive strikes targeting host cell signaling
  machinery to create an anti-inflammatory pro-parasitic environment for eventual
  Leishmania invasion and the establishment of infection. Exosomes deliver effector
  compounds, such as GP63 and EF-1α, to target host cells, including macrophages.
  This results in the activation of multiple protein-tyrosine phosphatases, e.g.,
  SHP-1 and PTP1B, which dephosphorylate key targets in critical signaling pathways
  including the IFN-γ/Jak-STAT1 pathway. This disrupts signal transduction and leads
  to inhibition of macrophage microbicidal functions. Reprinted with permission and
