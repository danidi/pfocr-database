caption: 'Model showing the role of the ecdysone signalling in Drosophila ovarian
  stem cell niche. During development (green arrow) ecdysone signalling participates
  in defining the stem cell niche size. During adulthood (black arrows) this hormonal
  pathway has a dual role in regulation of early germline differentiation: regulation
  of cell contacts and cell shape rearrangements via adjustment of adhesion complexes
  and cytoskeletal proteins in ESCs and their progeny and control of the potency of
  TGF-β signalling.'
