caption: Model illustrating the potential role of CRKL in recruiting NleH1 to inhibit
  RPS3/NF-κB signaling during A/E pathogen infection. During A/E pathogen infection,
  NleH1 is injected into host cells through the T3SS and then interacts with CRKL.
  CRKL interacts with IKKβ and may recruit NleH1 to the RPS3-NF-κB complex, where
  NleH1 can then inhibit RPS3 phosphorylation. In the absence of CRKL (indicated by
  dashed lines), NleH1 is not recruited to the IKKβ-RPS3 complex and fails to block
  RPS3 nuclear translocation. PG, peptidoglycan; TLRs, Toll-like receptors; TNFR,
  TNF receptor; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; Ub, ubiquitin; RIP, receptor-interacting
  protein; cIAP, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein.
