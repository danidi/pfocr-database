caption: Key steps in the biosynthetic pathway of HCAAs in Arabidopsis stamens. Relevant
  enzymes SAMDC, SPDS, and SHT as well as the major polyamine, spermidine are specifically
  marked. The presence of spermidine disinapoyl transferase (SDT) transcript levels
  has been confirmed in this report.
