number: Figure 1
caption: Spearman rank correlations between cytokines significantly modified by age
  (see ; p-values < 0.0001 according to a Bonferroni-Holm correction) were plotted
  to reveal signaling networks. Pro-inflammatory (pink), anti-inflammatory (blue),
  and recruitment/trafficking (gray) chemokine and cytokines, growth factors (yellow)
  and hormones (purple) are shown. Green lines link positively correlated and red
  lines link negatively correlated analyte concentrations. Note that many analyte
  pairs are repeated frequently and a few cross-compartment (serum-hippocampus, serum-cortex
  and hippocampus-cortex) networks emerge.
