caption: Proposed model depicting the impact of PC1/3 knockdown on the activation
  of TLR4. Yellow droplets in the cell membrane symbolize that KD cells exhibited
  modifications of their lipid profile. (1) After LPS treatment, TLR4 is internalized
  in the endosomes to trigger the MYD88-independent signaling resulting in the activation
  of IRF-3. (2) As a result, the level of TLR4 at the plasma membrane decreases. (3)
  In the absence of PC1/3, TLR4 is more quickly re-expressed at the cell surface as
  symbolized by the clock pictogram, i.e,. 3 h after LPS treatment. These receptors
  may translocate from endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) where they are stored
  or from the Golgi apparatus after their synthesis and maturation. (4) TLR4 receptor
  can be synthesized from a pre-existing pool of messengers. This may support the
  de novo expression of the receptor at the cell surface or the replenishment of TLR4
  stock in ERC if the receptor translocated from this compartment. (5) The re-expression
  of TLR4 at the cell surface after 3 h of LPS challenge in PC1/3 KD macrophages leading
  to a stronger activation of the pro-inflammatory NFKB pathway while the anti-inflammatory
  STAT3 pathway is downregulated. (6) As a consequence, PC1/3 KD macrophages stimulated
  with LPS secrete more pro-inflammatory cytokines and antitumor factors. After treatment
  of PC1/3 KD cells with LPS during 6 h, TLR4 is again internalized, and its amount
  at the cell surface decreased (2). (7) The increase of MYD88 level observed in PC1/3
  KD macrophages after 6 h of LPS treatment may compensate the decrease of TLR4 at
  the cell surface and maintain the activation of the signaling pathway. (8) A clear
  correlation between protein synthesis and gene expression in KD cells treated with
  LPS can not be made. Therefore, another mechanism, such as augmentation of protein
  half-life or stability, may be responsible for this increase. (9) PC1/3 KD cells
  resist to the inhibitory effect of IL-10 and clearly show a pro-inflammatory response.
