caption: 'Network analysis of apoptotic genes modulated in response to V3000 and V3034
  infections in spleen at 24 h pi. In silico network analysis of significantly modulated
  genes in the spleen was performed for the apoptotic pathway using the Ingenuity
  Pathway analysis software. Analysis showed modulation of the apoptotic pathway in
  V3000 infection (a) mediated by upregulation of inducers and downregulation of repressors
  of apoptotic pathway. In the case of V3034 infection (b), such involvement of the
  apoptotic pathway was not observed. Legends: : leads to activation, : effect not
  predicted, : upregulated, : downregulated, : not expressed; intensity of the color
  is directly proportional to the level of modulation'
