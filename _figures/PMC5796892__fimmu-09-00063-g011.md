caption: Schematic representations demonstrating the role LdISP2 in the modulation
  of host response. The model illustrates that the survival of Leishmania donovani
  parasites inside host depends on their capacity to resist the complement attack
  and to modulate the host immune response by using LdISP2. In one way, Leishmania
  ISP2 inhibit the activation of lectin pathway by interaction with MASP2. Inhibition
  of MASP2 by LdISP2 results in less production of C3 and C5 convertase leading to
  decreased membrane attacking complex (MAC) formation. Reduced MAC formation decreases
  complement-mediated lysis of the parasites. In this way, the Leishmania parasites
  defend itself from complement-mediated attack by using LdISP2. On another way, LdISP2
  inhibits utrophil elastase (NE) activity and upregulate C5aR expression. Induced
  expression of C5aR activates the PI3K/AKT pathway. Phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT decreases
  IL-12 level. L. donovani utilises theses two different strategies for its own survival
  by using LdISP2. The black arrow indicates the normal phenomena and the red arrow
  indicates the phenomena modulated by L. donovani.
