caption: Working model of Gα activation during asymmetric cell division of C. elegans
  embryos. (A) In the wild-type embryo, RIC-8 GEF activity generates Gα·GTP. (It is
  still unclear whether C. elegans RIC-8 can act directly on Gβγ-complexed Gα·GDP,
  since rat Ric-8A has been shown, at least in vitro, to act only on free Gα subunits
  []. An alternate possibility is that a distinct pool of free Gα exists or is generated
  from Gα·GDP/Gβγ heterotrimers by some as-yet unidentified player in this pathway.)
  The intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα·GTP, possibly accelerated by RGS-7 GAP activity,
  then generates Gα·GDP that binds the GoLoco motif of GPR-1/2 (the latter protein
  in complex with its critical co-factor LIN-5; []). The GPR-1/2/Gα·GDP complex is
  presumed to either modulate the (as-yet undefined) astral microtubule force generator
  or directly generate force (black arrow). (B) In the absence of RIC-8 activity,
  Gα·GTP levels are reduced, resulting in significantly lower levels of Gα·GDP required
  to form the GPR-1/2/Gα·GDP complex. This is consistent with the observations of
  reduced GPR-1/2/Gα·GDP co-immunoprecipitation from ric-8 (md1909+RNAi) C. elegans
  embryos []. (C) Combining the elimination of RIC-8 activity with RNAi-mediated knockdown
  of gpb-1 (Gβ) is observed to restore the levels of GPR-1/2/Gα·GDP complex [] and
  the magnitude of force applied to the spindle poles (fig. ). Gα·GDP freed from its
  normal heterotrimeric state has a higher spontaneous nucleotide exchange rate []
  and therefore, in this model, can cycle through the GTP-bound state, GTP hydrolysis
  and GPR-1/2 interaction (or can directly bind to GPR-1/2; not shown). (D) In this
  model, loss of RGS-7 GAP activity leads to slower conversion of Gα·GTP to the Gα·GDP
  form required for the GPR-1/2/Gα·GDP complex. This is consistent with the reduced
  anterior forces observed in loss-of-function rgs-7 mutants, although it is not known
  if RGS-7 is restricted in expression to the anterior cortex [].
