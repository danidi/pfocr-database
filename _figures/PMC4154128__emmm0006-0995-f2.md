caption: (A) Multiple repair pathways including non-homologous end joining (NHEJ),
  base-excision repair (BER), homologous recombination (HR), nucleotide excision repair
  (NER), and mismatch repair (MMR) protect the cellular genome from damage through
  conserved pathways that collectively activate the DNA damage response (DDR). (B)
  In precancerous lesions, overwhelming damage or weakened repair capacity (for example.
  loss of HR) can lead to selection for mutations that promote survival. Transformed
  cells often exhibit constitutively activated DDR and enhanced genomic instability.
  (C) Loss of a repair pathway (through inherited or incurred mutation, e.g. HR) can
  render cancer cells “addicted” or dependent on the other repair pathways (CancerHR).
  (D) Combined therapies that are effective against tumors bearing mutant repair pathways
  often inhibit a second repair pathway. This could be by targeting a general repair
  factor (e.g. PARP) or—as suggested here—the mTORC2 complex. The resulting accumulation
  of irreparable damage leads to cell death (synthetic lethality). DNA-damaging agents
  could enhance the synthetic lethality. Illustration partially adapted (with permission)
