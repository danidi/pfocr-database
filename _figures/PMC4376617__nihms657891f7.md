caption: Schematic representation of the role of T cells in the anabolic activity
  of iPTH in trabecular bone. When CD40L is expressed on T cells, iPTH stimulates
  T cells to express Wnt10b, a Wnt ligand loosely associated with cell membranes required
  to activate Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells. The Wnt10b promoter contains two
  essential CREB binding sites. Wnt10b gene expression is activated by the PPR/ GαS/cAMP/PKA
  pathway, which phosphorylates CREB proteins leading to their binding to the CREB
  sites in the Wnt10b promoter. Activation of CD40L potentiates CREB phosphorylation,
  further inducing Wnt10b gene expression. T cell produced Wnt10b activates Wnt signaling
  in SCs and OBs in the trabecular compartment of the skeleton. Wnt signaling stimulates
  OB proliferation, differentiation and survival. In addition, CD40L directly activates
  Wnt signaling in osteoblastic cells and provides proliferative and survival cues
  to SCs and OBs by activating CD40 signaling. Since T cells do not reside on the
  periosteal surface and have limited communications with osteocytes (OCY), T cell
  expressed CD40L and Wnt10b do not contribute to the activation of Wnt signaling
  in osteocytes. Therefore the anabolic effects of iPTH in cortical bone are T cell
  independent and result primarily from direct inhibition of osteocytic sclerostin
  production. It is possible that increased production of Wnt10b or other Wnt ligands
  by OCYs may contribute to the T cell and CD40L–independent effects of iPTH on cortical
  bone.
