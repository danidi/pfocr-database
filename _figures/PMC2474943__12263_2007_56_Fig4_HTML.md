caption: Potential points of action of flavonoids within JNK pathway. JNK is regulated
  by a variety of MAPKKK’s, including MEKK1/4 and apoptosis-stimulating kinase (ASK1),
  which is further regulated by GTPases and Rac1. Unlike the ERK pathway, the JNK
  cascade is strongly activated by stress signals such as UV and γ-radiation, oxidative
  stress and inflammatory cytokines. The MAPKK, MKK4/7, dually phosphorylates JNK
  within the Thr138-Pro-Tyr-185 motif (pTPpY) in the catalytic core of active JNK.
  Active JNK has been strongly linked to transcription-dependent apoptotic signalling,
  mainly through the activation of c-Jun and other AP-1 proteins including JunB, JunD
  and ATF-2
