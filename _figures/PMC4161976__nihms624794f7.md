caption: Schematic representation showing that AKT1 interacts with and phosphorylates
  SIRT6 at Ser338. Phosphorylation at this residue increases the interaction between
  SIRT6 and MDM2 and enhances the degradation of SIRT6 through an MDM2-dependent ubiquitin
  proteasome pathway, contributing to tumorigenesis and trastuzumab resistance in
  breast cancer.
