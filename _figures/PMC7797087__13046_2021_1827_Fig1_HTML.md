caption: Schematic model illustrating the cross-talk between the ET-1R axis and the
  YAP pathway. The ET-1R/β-arr1-generated signaling network instructs highly specific
  transcriptional programs through the binding of specific transcription factors (TF)
  as TEAD, NFY, and HIF-1α, that impact on the behaviour of cancer cells, promoting
  the amplification of an ET-1 autocrine vicious circuit, critically involved in tumor
  cell proliferation, survival, cell invasion and migration, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) and chemoresistance. The autocrine/paracrine release of ET-1 may
  in parallel impact on tumor microenvironment (TME) elements embedded in the extracellular
  matrix (ECM), affecting their features. ET-1 activating the ETBR expressed by endothelial
  cells (EC) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) promotes angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.
  Moreover, ET-1R/YAP may sustain the growth, migration and contraction of cancer-associated
  fibroblasts (CAF), and may favour the maturation and activity of tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAM), sustaining the production of inflammatory cytokines crucial for
  tumor metastatization. In addition, ET-1 via ETBR may interfere with the recruitment
  of the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) to the tumor. Moreover, ET-1 sustains
  the production of proteins that modify the architecture of the ECM. These knowledge
  render the ET-1R receptors suitable targets for therapeutic interventions based
  on the use of dual ET-1R antagonists, as macitentan, able to simultaneously interfere
  with the ET-1R/β-arr1-induced signaling network and YAP in tumor cells and TME elements.
