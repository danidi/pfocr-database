caption: Intracellular Par-4 binds to aPKC in the cytoplasm to inhibit NF-κB activation
  and induce apoptosis. Moreover, various apoptotic stimuli trigger the nuclear translocation
  of Par-4 where, acting via its SAC domain, it inhibits NF-κB-mediated pro-survival
  signals, and promotes apoptosis. In the nucleus, Par-4 binds to topoisomerase I
  (TOPO-I) and sequesters it from the DNA to inhibit DNA relaxation and prevent cellular
  transformation. Intracellular Par-4 is also present in the ER, either as a complex
  with GRP78 or in an unbound state. ER-stress results in translocation of the GRP78-Par-4
  complex to the plasma membrane. Secretion of Par-4 may occur following Par-4 dissociation
  from GRP78 either prior to its translocation to the cell surface (a), or after translocation
  to the cell surface (b). Alternately, intracellular Par-4 that is not bound to GRP78
  may be secreted by a separate pathway, independent of GRP78 (c). Par-4, secreted
  in response to ER stress, binds to cell-surface GRP78 and amplifies the ER stress
  pathway to induce FADD/caspase-8-dependent apoptosis. This extrinsic pathway triggered
  by extracellular (secreted) Par-4 requires the function of intracellular Par-4 for
  translocation of GRP78 from the ER to the membrane. However, the role of nuclear
  translocation of intracellular Par-4 in the action of extracellular Par-4 is not
  clear.
