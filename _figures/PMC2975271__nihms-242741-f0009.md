caption: Schematic model for regulation of mTOR pathway signaling through interaction
  of the p53 target Plk2 with TSC proteins. Our model proposes that Plk2 and TSC1
  interact to facilitate TSC1/TSC2 restraint of mTOR. Decreased mTOR activity leads
  to decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K and consequent decrease in protein translation,
  cell growth and proliferation. These events are regulated by hypoxia and DNA damage.
