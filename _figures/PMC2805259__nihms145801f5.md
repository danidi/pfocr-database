caption: 'Hypothetical model for how the translational control checkpoint is disabled
  in human lung cancer. A. Mouse: Knockout of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 leads to steady state
  translational activation of genes governing growth, proliferation, angiogenesis
  and CYP2A5, the enzyme bioactivating NNK. B. Human smokers: Exposure to NNK causes
  mutations leading to Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation. This inactivates the
  4E-BP system and creates a 4E-BP null phenocopy. A potential feed-forward loop is
  set up in which the genome-wide translational profile is shifted to activate genes
  driving growth, proliferation, angiogenesis and NNK bioactivation; so that the target
  cell is pushed further along the cancer pathway and NNK is a more potent mutagen.'
