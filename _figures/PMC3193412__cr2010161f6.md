caption: The non-canonical NFκB pathway. Receptor engagement leads to recruitment
  and activation of cIAP1/2 mediated by TRAF2 resulting in the degradation of TRAF3.
  Decreased levels of TRAF3 stabilize NIK, which in turn activates IKK1 activity.
  Degradation of IκBδ following non-canonical IKK activation releases RelA:p50 or
  RelB:p50 dimers sequestered by IκBδ. Processing of newly synthesized p100 also occurs
  and generates RelB:p52 complex, whose levels slowly build up to provide sustained
  activity of the RelB:p52 dimer. Translocation of NFκB dimers to the nucleus activates
  gene expression program.
