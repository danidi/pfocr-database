caption: The interactions of the AhR and a7nAChR with the TRYCAT and melatonergic
  pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chronic stress increase IDO and TDO, respectively,
  leading to TRYCAT induction, with differential effects on mitochondrial functioning.
  TRYCAT activation and stress-induced MAO, by decreasing serotonin availability,
  decrease melatonergic pathway activation. Increased KYNA may also compete with melatonin
  via the opposing regulation of the a7nAChR. AhR activation, via IDO induction, may
  positively feedback on TRYCAT synthesis, as well as decrease the availability of
  melatonin by increasing its metabolism. Some data indicate that the AhR decreases
  sirtuins, which may also be mediated by decreased melatonin. Both 3-OHK and 3-OH-ANA
  can modulate mitochondrial functioning. 3-OH-ANA indicates 3-hydroxyanthranillic
  acid; 3-OHK, 3-hydroxykynurenine; a7nAChR, alpha 7 nicotinic receptor; AhR, aryl
  hydrocarbon receptor; IDO, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; KYNA, kynurenic acid; MAO,
  monoamine oxidase; TDO, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase; TRYCATs, tryptophan catabolites.
