caption: 'Several types of DNA damage mechanisms can induce VRK1, stabilizing and
  activating p53-dependent transcription (black line). Among the p53-induced genes,
  Hdm2 promotes p53 degradation via ubiquitylation (blue line), and DRAM induces VRK1
  degradation in the lysosome (red line). VRK1 and DRAM are in the same late endosomal
  vesicle that fuses to lysosomes, but do not interact directly. PP: unknown phosphatase.'
