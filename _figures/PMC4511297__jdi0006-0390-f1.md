caption: Binding of cytokines to their receptors on islet cells activates a number
  of signaling pathways including transcription nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) through
  ubiquitination of elements, which should provoke cytokine-induced cell death. The
  pathway, however, might be modified by de-ubiquitinating elements, such as OTUB2.
  This modifier executes remodeling of the damaged islet cells. IκB, inhibitor of
  κB; IL-R, receptor for interleukins; OTUB2, otubain 2; NEMO, nuclear factor-κB essential
  modulator; RIP1, receptor-interacting protein 1; TNF-R, receptor for tumor necrosis
  factor superfamily; TRAF, TNF receptor-associated factor; Ub, ubiquitin.
