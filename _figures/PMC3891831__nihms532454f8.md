caption: Key steps of meiotic recombination are illustrated. We propose that the RPA-MEIOB-SPATA22
  complex coats both the D-loop and the ssDNA of the second end. In this model, the
  interaction between RPA and MEIOB-SPATA22 mediates second end capture. Most DSBs
  are repaired through the SDSA (synthesis dependent strand annealing) pathway, in
  which the D-loop collapses back to its sister chromatid. After second end capture,
  intermediates continue to form double Holliday junctions, which are resolved into
  either crossovers or non-crossovers. We propose that MEIOB removes the 3’ flaps
  resulting from the first end DNA synthesis in both dHJ and SDSA pathways.
