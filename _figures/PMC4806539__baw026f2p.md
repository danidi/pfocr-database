caption: 'Biological networks according to IPA of 1370 genes related to HNSCC. (A)
  The canonical pathway ‘Molecular mechanisms of cancer’ and the growing picture of
  molecular mechanisms in HNSCC: receptor signaling pathways are induced by hormone,
  growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins or cytokines, leading to the activation
  of different cytoplasmatic effectors and transcription factors, and promoting cell
  cycle regulation, DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell survival and proliferation. (B)

  and proinflammatory cytokines (IL6, TGFB1, TNF) identified by the present study.
