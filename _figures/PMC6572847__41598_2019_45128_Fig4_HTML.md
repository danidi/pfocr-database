  (a, b, c, d) in the enzymatic steps indicate the number of isolates in a given group
  for which the corresponding gene was detected. Colors indicate which groups are
  represented for a given enzymatic step: present in ≥1 isolate in all groups (green);
  present in ≥1 isolate in all groups except S. endobioticum (purple); present in
  ≥1 isolate in both culturable groups, but not in the obligate or facultative biotrophs
  (orange); unassigned (white). The red “X” indicates the pathway for de novo Guanidine
  triphosphate (GTP) synthesis that is blocked in S. endobioticum. Boxed in orange
  is inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (EC:1.1.1.205), and boxed in blue is Pyrimidine
  5′-nucleotidase (EC:3.1.3.5), which were both found to be present in all genomes
  analyzed except in S. endobioticum. Boxed in red is guanine that could be scavenged
  by S. endobioticum from its host allowing synthesis of GTP.'
