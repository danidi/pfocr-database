caption: A model for erythroferrone-mediated recovery from the anemia of inflammation.
  Hypoxia is sensed in the kidney, and erythropoietin levels are increased through
  an IRP1-HIF2α signaling pathway. Elevated erythropoietin causes a JAK2/STAT5 phosphorylation
  cascade, leading to the production of ERFE in early erythroblasts. Circulating erythroferrone
  suppresses hepcidin production in hepatocytes, leading to elevated ferroportin expression
  and augmenting serum iron availability for red blood cell maturation.
