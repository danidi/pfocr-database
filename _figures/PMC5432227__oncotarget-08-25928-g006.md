caption: The one-carbon metabolism pathway score was significantly increased (red)
  and the proline degradation pathway score was decreased (blue) compared to benign
  and both were associated with decreased biochemical-free survival in the MSKCC subset.
  It has been reported that the one-carbon metabolism and proline metabolism pathways
  interconnect with glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway to provide ATP, and NADH
  and NADPH (mediators of electron transfer for energy, reductive biosynthesis and
  redox defense) [, , ]. (Pink indicates upregulated pathways in MSKCC subset; grey
  indicates other heterogeneous pathways). ALDH18A1, Pyrroline-5-carboxylase synthase;
