caption: Schematic presentation showing the possible route of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13
  signaling. Endogenous IL-1β production may occur with immune challenge by cytokines,
  bacteria, and viruses, and any microtrauma in the body while epinephrine is released
  in states of stress or sympathetic nervous system activation. The pathways activated
  by these signals converge on IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 genes to induce cytokine production
  that is greater than either signal alone. IL-1β activates the NF-κB pathway which
  leads to significant amounts of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 production. Epinephrine activates
  the p38 MAPK pathway which may activate other transcription factors or stabilize
  the IL-6, 8, and 13 mRNA. From our data it is evident that IL-1β and epinephrine
  do not combine to further activate NF-κB or the promotor activity of the IL-13 gene.
  The importance of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 are listed in the figure.
