caption: Pathways for carbohydrate catabolism. (a) Three evolutionarily old and interrelated
  processes, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (blue), glycolysis (red) and the pentose
  phosphate pathway (blue) convert carbohydrates to pyruvate, yielding both energy
  as ATP and reducing equivalents, and pyruvate and other small molecules that can
  be further catabolized or consumed as biosynthetic intermediates. The very well
  conserved core pathway of glycolysis is highlighted with intense red shading. (b)
  The molecules and reactions that make up canonical glycolysis, the conversion of
  glucose to pyruvate, are shown in red. Reactions found in diverse taxa that bring
  other carbohydrates into this process are shown in black, as are three examples
  of fermentation of pyruvate and its oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA, at
  the bottom of the diagram. Boxes distinguish carbohydrate substrates that a mammal
  typically recovers from the environment (green) from ones synthesized internally
  (blue). The black outline identifies the core group of molecules and reactions shared
  by all glycolytic pathways, which differentiate them from other metabolic processes.
  (c) The kinds and components of glycolytic catabolism can be represented as an ontology.
  Glycolytic pathways (processes) are related to a core glycolytic process by is_a
  relationships (red arrows). Each form of glycolytic process has as parts (black
  arrows) specific Molecular Functions that define it and distinguish it from other
  forms of glycolysis. Core glycolysis and four other terms are shown; a complete
  set of process terms with the is_a relationships for each is given in Supplementary
  Table S1.
