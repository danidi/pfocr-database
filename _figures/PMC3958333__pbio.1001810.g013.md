caption: PDFR acts through Gs and adenylate cyclase (AC) to increase levels of cAMP
  which may directly activate a cyclic-nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel (green pathway)
  to acutely depolarize the cell and increase the action potential firing rate. cAMP
  also activates PKA, promoting TIM stability and progression of the molecular clock
  (blue pathway). Light activates CRY, which promotes TIM degradation. The molecular
  clock also controls PKA transcripts, thereby controlling signal transduction to
  the clock through a feedback mechanism.
