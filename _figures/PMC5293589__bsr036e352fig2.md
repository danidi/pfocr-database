caption: (A) The direct transcriptional pathway involves interaction of ER dimers
  with EREs within the DNA sequence to modulate gene regulation. (B) The indirect
  transcriptional pathway involves protein–protein interaction of the ER dimers with
  transcription factors (TF) to regulate gene transcription. (C) The non-transcriptional
  pathway involves a subclass of classical ERs and GPER1 to trigger signal transduction
  cascades in response to E2 stimulation.
