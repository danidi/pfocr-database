caption: Model depicts chaperone competition between protein aggregates and the CME
  pathway. (A) Under normal conditions, HSC70 is at sufficiently high levels to mediate
  CME, as well as basal protein client folding. (B) Under disease conditions, where
  protein aggregates have accumulated and cytosolic HSC70 levels have been titrated,
  CME is inhibited, but this inhibition can be restored by increasing chaperone levels.
