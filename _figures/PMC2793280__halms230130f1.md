caption: IGF-II and proteins bearing M6P are linked by the same receptor but their
  binding sites are distinct. In fact, some of the 15 homologous repeating domains
  of the extracytoplasmic region are responsible for the binding to M6P or IGF-II.
  The IGF-II binding site is contained within domain 11 (residues 1508–1566) [] and
  sequences in domain 13 contribute a 10 fold enhancement in IGF-II affinity []. Domains
  1–3 and 7–9 contain the two high affinity M6P-binding sites with essential residues
  localized within domains 3 and 9 [] (). In addition, domain 5 of CI-M6PR exhibits
  significant sequence homology to domains 3 and 9 as well as to the extracytoplasmic
  region of CD-M6PR, suggesting that CI-M6PR contains a third M6P recognition site
  that is located in domain 5 and exhibits lower affinity than the carbohydrate-binding
  sites present in the two high affinity M6P-binding domains []. Even though the binding
  sites of M6P and IGF-II are distinct, these two ligands can reciprocally inhibit
  each other []. Indeed, IGF-II has been shown to decrease binding of M6P-bearing
  lysosomal enzymes to CI-M6PR [, ]. Similarly, β-galactosidase and cathepsin D, two
  lysosomal enzymes containing M6P moieties, have been shown to decrease the binding
  of CI-M6PR to IGF-II []. These cross-interactions that partially shield other binding
  sites could be caused by a steric hindrance or a conformational change in the receptor.
  CI-M6PR has been also shown to bind with high affinity a third type of ligand, the
  retinoic acid at a site that is distinct from those of M6P and IGF-II, but the precise
  localization of the retinoic acid binding site remains unknown. Retinoic acid exerts
  diverse biological effects involved in the control of cell growth in embryogenesis
  and oncogenesis through its binding to the nuclear retinoid receptors. The interaction
  of retinoic acid with CI-M6PR may modulate a retinoic acid response pathway that
  is important for cell growth regulation []. Immuno-fluorescence techniques have
  allowed to show that retinoic acid can alter the intracellular distribution of both
  CI-M6PR and lysosomal enzymes [].
