caption: Based on our findings, there are several crucial paths, including PI3/AKT/mTOR
  as well as HIF-1α activation (in hypoxia) and inhibition (in normoxia). Based on
  the docking data, as well as the network and the functional enrichment analyses,
  we reconstructed the HIF-1α signaling pathway with adding the TSGA10 protein as
  an inhibitory factor in the formation of HIF-1α/P300/CBP transcription complex.  represents
  the main cellular events that occur subsequent to hypoxia and HIF-1α activation
  (e.g., angiogenesis, pH dysregulation, cell migration, and metastasis), normoxia
  (ubiquitin-mediated HIF-1α complex degradation) and TSGA10 activation (e.g., inhibition
  the HIF-1α/HIF-1β/P300-CBP complex activation).
