caption: 'Schematic representation of eventsm during signal transduction pathway induced
  by ABA leading to stomatal closure. Binding of ABA to its receptor (PYR/PYL/RCAR)
  blocks the function of PP2C. As a result, OST1, which stays phosphorylated, activates
  multiple components like NADPH oxidase (to generate ROS) and anion channels [quick
  anion channel 1 (QUAC1) and slow anion channel 1 (SLAC1)] to trigger anion efflux.
  The secondary messengers: ROS, NO, and cytosolic Ca2+, exert multiple effects. The
  rise in cytosolic pH, another secondary messenger, appears to stimulate NADPH oxidase,
  but neither the origin nor the mode of pH action is understood. The high levels
  of ROS can promote NO production with the involvement of mitogen-activated protein
  kinases and elevate pH and Ca2+ in the cytosol. In turn, Ca2+ can activate RBOH-D/F
  and elevate ROS levels. The rise in NO downregulates K+ inward channels and elevates
  cytosolic Ca2+ levels through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic ADP
  ribose (cADPR). An increase in Ca2+ can activate calcium-dependent protein kinases
  to facilitate a further influx of Ca2+ from outside. Ca2+-activated calcium-dependent
  protein kinases stimulate SLAC1 and S-type anion channel 3 while inhibiting K+ influx
  through K+in channels. When present, NO activates two enzymes, phospholipase C and
  phospholipase D (PLD), resulting in the synthesis of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate
  (IP3) phosphatidic acid. In turn, IP3 releases Ca2+ levels from internal stores
  of plant cells, while phosphatidic acid can stimulate NADPH oxidase and inhibit
  the inward K+ channel. ABA can stimulate the formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate
  (S1P) and phytosphingosine-1P, which activate PLD through G-protein α-subunit 1
  (GPA1). NO can promote K+ efflux channels and cytosolic alkalization while inhibiting
  K+ influx channels via calcium-dependent protein kinases. These three secondary
  messengers involved in ABA signaling, namely ROS, NO, Ca2+, and their interactions,
  play a significant role in regulating stomatal closure. Ion channels are terminal
  points of signal transduction, causing the loss of turgor in guard cells and stomatal
  closure. Further details are described in the text. Arrows (→) indicate stimulation,
  and the symbol ⊣ represents inhibition. Abbreviations used here are listed in the
