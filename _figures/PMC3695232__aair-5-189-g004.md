caption: Proposed mechanism of Th17 cell polarization by inhalation of allergen contaminated
  with endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). At high levels, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces
  VEGF production by airway structural cells, such as epithelial cells, macrophages
  or NK cells. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) uptake allergens, and then migrate to
  draining lymph nodes (DLN). During allergen uptake by DCs, VEGF (produced by high-level
  LPS) induces DC maturation and expression of costimulatory molecules via the VEGFR1-dependent
  pathway. IL-6 expression in DCs is also upregulated by VEGF via the VEGFR2-dependent
  pathway. In DLN, mature DCs induce proliferation of naïve T cells (T cell priming),
  which subsequently differentiate into Th17 cells, via IL-6 and the STAT3 signaling
  pathway.
