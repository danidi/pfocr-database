caption: 'Synthesis of the biotin pimeloyl moiety in E. coli.The pathway proceeds
  from A to D. Methyl groups are red. A. BioC-catalyzed methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-L-methionine
  (SAM) to malonyl-ACP initiates the pathway. B. Malonyl-ACP methyl ester enters the
  fatty acid synthetic cycle as the primer. Two rounds of the fatty acid chain elongation
  cycle results in pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester. C. BioH cleaves the methyl group from
  pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester is give pimeloyl-ACP which is a substrate for BioF. D.
  BioF begins assembly of the biotin rings by catalyzing the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent
  decarboxylative condensation of pimeloyl-ACP and Lalanine. Abbreviations: SAH, S-adenosyl-homocysteine;
  KAPA, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (also called 8-amino-7-oxononanois acid). The
  pathway is given in greater detail in [].'
