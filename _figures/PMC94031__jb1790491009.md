caption: Model for activation and repression of the Cpx regulon. Under nonstressed
  conditions, CpxP (circles) interacts with the sensing domain of CpxA (central portion
  of periplasmic domain of CpxA), maintaining the kinase in an off state (thick, black,
  curvy line). In response to envelope stress, CpxP is titrated away from the sensing
  domain, perhaps by preferential binding to misfolded proteins (squiggly line), which
  may also bind to the sensing domain of CpxA and activate the kinase (rectangular
  form). Activation leads to rapid amplification of the pathway through autoactivation
  of the cpxRA operon. Upon alleviation of envelope stress, high levels of free CpxP
  exist in the periplasm which rebind the sensing domain of CpxA and shutoff the response
  by downregulating the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity. H, the histidine
  residue in CpxA that is conserved with those of other HKs; H-P, phosphorylation
  of this residue; D, aspartate residue in CpxR that is conserved with those of other
  RRs; D-P, phosphorylation of this residue. The square form of CpxR symbolizes the
  phosphorylated form that is competent for transcriptional activation of the downstream
  regulon members.
