caption: Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated
  protein 5 (MDA5), and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)
  are the three major cytosolic sensors that detect RSV genomes in infected cells.
  All three sensors utilize the mitochondria antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) as
  an adaptor protein and scaffold for the transduction of downstream signaling events.
  Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can also sense RSV. While TLR4 and TLR2/6 heterodimers
  are located at the plasma membrane, TLR7 and TLR3 are located at the endosomal membrane.
  TLRs detect RSV ssRNA, dsRNA, or viral envelope protein and transduce the signaling
  via myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) or TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF). Pathogen recognition receptor signaling converges
  in the activation of interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and nuclear factor-kB
  (NF-kB). The active forms of IRFs and NF-kB then translocate into the nucleus and
  induce the expression of type I/III IFNs and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Upon secretion,
  these molecules bind to their specific receptors in an autocrine or paracrine manner
  to stimulate the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription
  (JAK-STAT) pathway and ultimately leading to the production of hundreds of interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs). RSV encodes various mechanisms to suppress these innate immune responses.
  Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and NS2 are the best understood. They form the degradasome
  (depicted as scissors) that locates to the mitochondria and degrade multiple key
  proteins within the innate immune signaling pathways. Targets of the degradasome
  include the TNF receptor associated factors (TRAFs), TANK Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1),
  RIG-I, IRF3/7, and STAT2. In addition, NS2 can suppress RLR signaling via direct
  interaction with RIG-I.
