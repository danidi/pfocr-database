caption: Schematic of the erbB2 pathway and points of small molecule intervention.,,
  Combinations that inhibit both the transcription of erbB2 and the lifetime or activity
  of the mature protein have a synergistic increase in activity against erbB2-driven
  cancer cells. Drug combinations to synergistically target disorders ranging from
  cancer to inflammation have been identified in recent years. These combinations
  often have the benefit of reduced toxicity in addition to increased selectivity
  relative to the single agents. However, applications to inhibitors of protein–protein
  interactions and, in particular, the transient and poorly characterized protein–protein
  interactions that regulate transcription have not been reported.−,
