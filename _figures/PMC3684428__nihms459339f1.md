caption: The adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR). Activation of three UPR pathways
  initiates the adaptive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. During activation
  of the UPR in mammals, BiP (immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, also known
  as GRP78) is sequestered through binding to unfolded or misfolded polypeptide chains,
  thereby leading to BiP release from the ER stress sensors for their activation.
  Unconventional cytoplasmic splicing, mediated by IRE1α, removes a 26-nucleotide
  intron from unspliced X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1) mRNA (encoding 267 amino acids)
  to produce a translational frameshift, yielding a fusion protein encoded from two
  evolutionarily conserved open reading frames (). The fusion protein, XBP1s, acts
  as a potent transcription factor for expression of UPR target genes involved in
  protein folding and export from the ER, export and degradation of misfolded proteins,
  and lipid biosynthesis, to resolve ER stress (). Upon accumulation of unfolded protein
  in the ER lumen, oligomerization of the PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) in ER membranes
  induces its autophosphorylation and kinase domain activation (, ). Activated PERK
  phosphorylates serine 51 on the α-subunit of heterotrimeric eIF2 (). When eukaryotic
  translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) is phosphorylated, the eIF2 complex shows
  increased affinity for its guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B and sequesters
  all available eIF2B. Because the cellular level of eIF2B is 10- to 20-fold lower
  than the level of eIF2, very small changes in eIF2α phosphorylation can dramatically
  change the rate of translation initiation (). Inhibition of general mRNA translation
  by the phosphorylation of eIF2α reduces accumulation of misfolded protein in the
  ER lumen (), thereby protecting the cell from diverse stimuli that perturb the ER
  homeostasis. In contrast to inhibition of general mRNA translation, the PERK/eIF2α
  pathway stimulates the translation of several specific mRNAs containing multiple
  53-upstream open reading frames, such as Atf4 and Atf5, Chop, Gadd34, and the cationic
  amino acid transporter 1 (Cat-1, an Na+-independent transporter of L-arginine and
  L-lysine) (, ). Among them, ATF4 activates transcription of the adaptive genes that
  encode functions in ER protein folding, endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation
  (ERAD), amino acid biosynthesis and transportation, and the antioxidative stress
  response (). Under ER stress, ATF6α and ATF6βare released from BiP and translocate
  to the Golgi complex, where they are cleaved by Golgi-resident proteases, first
  by S1P (site 1 protease) and then in the intramembrane region by S2P (site 2 protease),
  to release the N-terminal basic leucine zipper protein (bZIP) transcription factor
  domain (). The bZIP domain of ATF6α then translocates into the nucleus, where it
  activates the transcription of genes encoding ER-localized molecular chaperones
  and folding enzymes, ERAD, protein secretion machineries, and ER biogenesis (),
  in some cases in cooperation with XBP1s ().
