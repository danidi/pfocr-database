caption: The BCAA metabolic pathway. (A) The BCAA biosynthesis pathway. The substrates
  and enzymes catalysing each step are shown. Feedback inhibition by the end-product
  is indicated by a red line. The antagonistic effect of valine on the inhibition
  of TD by isoleucine is indicated by a green dotted line. The enzymes whose transcript
  level is increased in lib are shown in red. The numbers along the AGI gene code
  indicate the ratio of expression of that gene in lib versus the WT. (B) The BCAA
  degradation pathway. The substrates and enzymes catalysing each step are shown.
  The enzymes whose transcript level is decreased in lib are shown in blue. The numbers
  along the AGI gene code indicate the ratio of expression of that gene in lib versus
  the WT. In (A) and (B), the names of enzymes are boxed.
