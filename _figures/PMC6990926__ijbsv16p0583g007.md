caption: Proposed model of lipid metabolism regulation in HER-2 positive breast cancer.
  Aspirin and Compound C inhibit c-myc synergistically. Upon c-myc signaling inhibition,
  the SREBP1 and its target gene expression are downregulated sequentially, which
  leads to decreased lipid biosynthesis and cell growth.

  breast cancer by regulating lipid metabolism in an AMPK-independent pathway.
