caption: 'Model of AgNimB2 function in phagocytic pathways of An. gambiae. (A) The
  known BINT2 opsonin-mediated phagocytic pathway, whereby TEP4 acts upstream of BINT2
  to mediate phagocytosis of Gram-negative bacteria. One hypothesis for AgNimB2’s
  action is by binding a TEP-opsonized bacterium and mediating its phagocytosis by
  then binding a membrane-bound receptor, which will interact with intracellular signaling
  molecules to mediate phagocytosis, such as CED5L. (B) The known LRP1 opsonin-mediated
  phagocytic pathway, with TEP3 and LRIM1 acting to mediate Gram-negative bacteria
  phagocytosis, and TEP1-coated mediating Gram-negative or positive bacterial phagocytosis
  via LRP1. One hypothesis for AgNimB2’s action is by acting to stabilize and mediate
  pathogen binding of TEP1 upstream of LRP1 or another pathway. LRP: Lipoteichoic
  acid recognition protein, TEP: thioester-containing protein.'
