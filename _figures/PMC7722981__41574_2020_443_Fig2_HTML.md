caption: a | In non-stressed (‘happy’) β-cells, glucose uptake via the glucose transporter
  GLUT1 leads to pyruvate formation through glycolysis and to increased ATP production
  by mitochondria. The resulting increased cytosolic level of ATP promotes the closure
  of the potassium channels, membrane depolarization and opening of the voltage-dependent
  calcium channels. The rise in intracellular levels of calcium triggers exocytosis
  of the insulin-containing granules. In these conditions, several genes and proteins
  are upregulated to restore the cellular stock of insulin. During this process, non-translocated
  preproinsulin, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident insulin signal peptide and non-mature
  proinsulin molecules are degraded through the proteasome directly or after retro-translocation
  and are presented by HLA class I at the cell surface (normal β-cell ligandome).
  b | In type 1 diabetes mellitus pathophysiological conditions, cytokines lead to
  profound changes in gene and protein expression, mainly by activation of the STAT1,
  IRF1 and NF-κB downstream pathways, that ultimately drives hyper-expression of HLA
  class I, and also the surface expression of inhibitory receptors (that is, PDL1).
  In the stress condition, calcium uptake by the mitochondria is responsible for increased
  permeability of the mitochondria that precedes the release of pro-apoptotic factors
  (such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytochrome c (cyt c)). Calcium depletion
  in the ER leads to activation of cytosolic calcium-dependent enzymes (such as transglutaminase
  2 and peptidyl arginine deiminase) that are involved in the post-translational modification
  processes by inducing protein deamidation and citrullination, respectively. The
  recruitment of the ER chaperones (binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP)) in response
  to the accumulation of misfolded protein within the ER leads to the activation of
  the sensors (PERK, IRE1a and ATF6) expressed at the surface of the ER membrane.
  The PERK pathway attenuates mRNA translation by phosphorylation of the eIF2a translation
  initiation factor. Phosphorylation of IRE1a and translocation of ATF6 activate the
  ER accumulated protein degradation pathway and the transcription of chaperone encoding
  genes with protein products involved in degradation of misfolded proteins, and also
  restores ER homeostasis. Long-term exposure to inflammatory stress promotes additional
  coping mechanisms, including initiation of recycling programmes and selective secretion
  of proteins and small RNAs in microvesicles, and ultimately leads to the induction
  of an apoptosis programme mediated by the transcriptional activation of CHOP by
  the combined activity of PERK and ATF6. During stress, normal transcription, translation
  and degradation is affected, which generates alternative RNA splicing, defective
  ribosomal products and hybrid peptides, respectively (stressed β-cell ligandome).
  CAR, coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor; DRiP, defective ribosomal product;
  PRR, pattern recognition receptor; SASP, senescence-associated secretory phenotype;
  TLR, Toll-like receptor.
