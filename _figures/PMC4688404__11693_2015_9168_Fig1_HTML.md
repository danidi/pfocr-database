caption: 'Schematic of isoprenoid to carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in various organisms.
  The isoprenoid precursors are synthesized via the 2-Cmethyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate
  (MEP) pathway in plastids of higher plants, apicomplexa and many proteobacteria
  and via mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway in animals, fungi and certain bacteria. Though
  different at many steps, the enzyme Phytoene synthase (PSY), catalyzing the first
  commited step of isoprenoid to carotenoid biosynthesis pathway is common in most
  organisms. PSY acts at the condensation of two molecules of GGPP to form the phytoene,
  the first commited step of the carotenoid pathway. Names of compounds and pathways
  are highlighted in black and of enzymes in red. Abbreviations: IPP isopentenyl diphosphate,
  DMAP dimethylallyl diphosphate, GGPP geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, GGPS geranylgeranyl
  diphosphate synthase, PPPP prephytoene diphosphate, PSY phytoene synthase. (Color
