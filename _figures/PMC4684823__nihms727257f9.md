caption: Schematic summary depicting fluoride-induced oxidative damage and adaptive
  response. Fluoride induces ROS generation that elicits JNK/c-Jun signaling. The
  ROS-mediated JNK/c-Jun pathway induces oxidative damage, mitochondrial damage, DNA
  damage, and apoptosis. Conversely, fluoride activates SIRT1/autophagy as an adaptive
  response through the ROS-mediated JNK/c-Jun pathway to protect cells from fluoride-induced
  oxidative damage.
