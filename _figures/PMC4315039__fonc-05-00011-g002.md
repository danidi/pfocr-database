caption: Functional components of the GDR pathway. Sensing of damaged DNA, histones,
  and other DNA-binding proteins results in activation of specific kinases [e.g.,
  ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)
  proteins] (–). Access to damaged chromatin is facilitated by histone modification
  involving histone acetyltransferases/deacetylases and histone methyltransferase/demethylases
  as well as by DNA modification involving DNA methyltransferase (, , –). Certain
  transcription factors (e.g., E2F1, NR4A) stimulate genes involved in chromatin repair
  (). Translational arrest is facilitated by microRNAs (e.g., mIR-155, miR-18a) (,
  ). Cell cycle arrest (e.g., via p53, Chk1, Chk2) may be required in order to complete
  chromatin repair (–). Unsuccessful chromatin repair due to extensive damage commits
  the cell to die. Successful chromatin repair enables cells to survive and restore
  normal function. In certain cases, incorrect repair escapes quality control surveillance
  and leads to altered cell function, which may provide the cell with a survival advantage,
  but manifest as pathology at the organismal level.
