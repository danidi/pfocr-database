caption: Mitochondrial dysfunction includes a reduction in mitochondrial content and
  mitochondrial biogenesis, and/or a decrease in the expression of mitochondrial oxidative
  proteins, such as complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC), with all those
  changes likely leading to decreased substrate oxidation (A). A diminished electron
  flow through the ETC can subsequently cause electron leakage and superoxide generation,
  followed by oxidative stress and damage. In a healthy environment, mitochondria
  can respond to damage through mitophagy pathways (removal of damaged mitochondria,
  preventing cell death), or in the case of high cellular stress, with apoptosis (B),
  both aggravating the decrease in substrate utilisation, and all up leading to increased
  lipid accumulation (C). Active lipid intermediates, such as diacylglycerols (DAG)
  and ceramide (CER) then cause inhibition of the insulin signalling pathway.
