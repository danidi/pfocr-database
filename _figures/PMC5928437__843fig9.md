caption: miR-103/107 promoted ER stress-mediated apoptosis via the Wnt3a/β-catenin
  /ATF6 pathway in preadipocytes. miR-103/107 blocked wnt/β-catenin signaling by targeting
  Wnt3a, released the inhibitory effect of LEF1 on ATF6, and activated ATF6-related
  ER stress. On the other hand, ATF6 transcription inhibited Bcl2, finally inducing
  apoptosis.
