caption: Propionate is an additional carbon source which is supplied as a cosubstrate
  for the synthesis of P(3HB-3HV) in recombinant E. coli. Several pathways have been
  shown to be involved in the uptake of propionate and are important in defining the
  optimal genotype for P(3HB-3HV) production strains. Both the acetoacetate degradation
  pathway (the Ato system) and the acetate secretion pathway (Ack/Pta) have been identified
  as contributing to propionate transport.
