caption: Proposed role for NF-κB during cortical neurogenesis. NF-κB signaling is
  robustly activated in neocortical VZ progenitors, transiently downregulated during
  early stages of neuronal differentiation, and then strongly activated in more developmentally
  mature neurons in the CP. NF-κB acts in undifferentiated progenitors to prevent/delay
  neuronal differentiation, thereby supporting progenitor cell maintenance. This role
  is similar to the function of the Notch signaling pathway (dotted double-pointed
  arrow). Hes6 antagonizes NF-κB in progenitor cells that are committed to undergo
  neuronal cell lineage progression. Conversely, NF-κB antagonizes the proneuronal
  activity of Hes6 to promote preservation of the neural progenitor pool. Hes6 also
  opposes Notch signaling-mediated inhibition of neuronal differentiation.
