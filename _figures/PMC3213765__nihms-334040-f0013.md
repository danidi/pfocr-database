caption: Schematic of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway in the primary cilium.
  (A) In the absence of Shh, Ptch resides at the base of the cilium whereas Smo is
  in the cytoplasm and the pathway is off. (B) In the presence of Shh or in medulloblastoma,
  Smo becomes located to the cilium. In the absence of Ptch or when Smo or SuFu are
  mutated, Gli and the levels of targets increase. Asterisk (*) identifies proteins
  mutated in medulloblastoma.
