caption: Regulatory effect of methylation levels of bone metabolism-related genes
  on bone formation (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). RUNX2 and OSX are specific transcription factors,
  which synergistically regulate the expression of bone-specific genes, including
  those encoding ALP, type I collagen and OCN. BMP2 is a key bone growth factor that
  can stimulate MSCs to differentiate into osteoblasts by inducing the expression
  of genes such as those encoding RUNX2, OSX, and OCN. The hypermethylation of the
  BMP2 promoter region in osteoblasts leads to downregulation of bone formation markers.
  SOST, a glycoprotein mainly secreted by osteoblasts, can inhibit osteoblast differentiation
  by inhibiting Wnt signal transduction and negatively regulates bone formation. The
  hypermethylation of SOST can inhibit SOST gene translation and promote the osteoclast
  differentiation. DNA methylation can regulate the transcription and expression of
  Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway molecules, so as to regulate the differentiation
  and function of osteoblasts. OPG/RANK/RANKL is the main regulator of the balance
  between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The methylation of these gene promoter regions
  can regulate the expression of corresponding genes, thus affecting the differentiation
  and function of osteoblast/osteoclast, and finally affecting the dynamic balance
  between bone formation and bone absorption in the process of bone remodeling ().
