caption: Proposed model of neurite outgrowth pathway in postnatal SVZ/RMS-derived
  neurons. The PI3K catalyzes phosphorylation of PIP4,5 (PIP2) to produce PIP3,4,5
  (PIP3), which in turn activates Akt1 and PKCζ. It is likely that Cdc42 is preferentially
  activated directly via PIP3 to PKCζ and for Rac1 preferential activation is via
  PIP3,4,5 and Akt1 to PKCζ. Akt1 can be also activated by other kinases.
