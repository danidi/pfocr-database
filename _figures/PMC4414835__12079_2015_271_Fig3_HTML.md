caption: Haematopoiesis. Blood cell production is maintained by a small population
  of stem cells found in the bone marrow; these cells have the ability to self-renew
  or differentiate. Cells then differentiate to multi-potential and lineage committed
  progenitors; these cells can’t be distinguished morphologically, only by the use
  of clonogenic assays. The final stage of differentiation is when the cells develop
  their characteristic morphology and are released into the circulation
