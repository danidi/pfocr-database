caption: 'Central metabolic pathway requirement for UTIs. Protein designations are
  provided only for mutants that were tested in a mouse UTI coinfection model. See  and  for
  more-detailed information. The thick arrows indicate reactions required for a mouse
  UTI, and the dashed arrows indicate reactions that are not required. Double-headed
  arrows represent reversible reactions. The pentose cycle is simplified to show a
  linear sequence, when it is actually a sequence of eight reactions that interconnect
  with glycolysis. Metabolite abbreviations: DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; Fru-6-P,
