caption: FAM13A regulates the CPT1A–FAO pathway in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
  (COPD). FAM13 locus has been shown to be associated with increased expression of
  FAM13A and higher risk for COPD. FAM13 in association with SIRT1 induces the expression
  of CPT1A, a key enzyme that regulates fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in the mitochondria.
  Up-regulation of CPT1A promotes FAO and high production of ROS, leading to lung
  epithelial cell death; this is an important pathogenic mechanism that might lead
  to COPD. CAT, carnitine translocase; CoA, coenzyme A; CPT1A, carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  1; CPT2, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2; FACS, fatty acyl-CoA synthase; FADH2,
  flavin adenin dinucleotide; FAM13A, family with sequence similarity 13 member A;
  NADH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SIRT1,
  sirtuin 1; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle.
