caption: 'Pathways of contraction and relaxation in cavernosal smooth-muscle cells.
  Ca2+ influx into cells increases intracellular Ca2+ that is available to bind to
  calmodulin. This binding causes a conformational change, enabling complexing with
  MLCK, with subsequent phosphorylation of the myosin–actin complex resulting in smooth
  muscle contraction and a flaccid penis. The Rho pathway is initiated by GPCR agonist
  binding, which activates RhoGEF, facilitating RhoA–GDP conversion to RhoA–GTP, and
  dissociation from inhibitory RhoGDI. RhoA–GTP relocates to the plasma membrane,
  where it binds to ROCK, facilitating autophosphorylation of ROCK that enhances its
  ability to phosphorylate and deactivate MLCP, augmenting the contractile response
  of the cell to Ca2+. Relaxation is largely mediated by cGMP. Conversion of GTP to
  cGMP is mediated by diffusion of NO into the cell and by GCR activation. cGMP facilitates
  Ca2+ efflux by activating PKG and cGMP-gated ion channels. Interactions between
  the pathways are complex. NO can increase expression of RhoA, but cGMP causes phosphorylation
  of RhoA, preventing interaction with ROCK. ROCK can phosphorylate and inhibit eNOS,
  and reduce eNOS expression. Abbreviations: cGMP, cyclic GMP; eNOS, endothelial nitric
  oxide synthase; GCR, guanylyl cyclase receptor; GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor;
