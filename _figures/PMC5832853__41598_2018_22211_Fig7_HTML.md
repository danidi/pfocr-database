caption: 'Pathways regulated by selected HPG axis-related hormone and protein in male
  reproduction as predicted by Pathway Ontology Database and KEGG Pathway Database.
  Notes: Regulated processes are represented by backgrounds of different colors and
  shapes, and regulatory events are displayed using arrows and lines. The references
  linked to each protein were based on Pathway Ontology Database and KEGG Pathway
  Database, and are not listed.'
