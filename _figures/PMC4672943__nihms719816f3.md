caption: The neuron in Alzheimer’s disease. A) Tf binds to TfR1 with augmentation
  through HFE interaction. Clathrin coat mediated endocytosis occurs, releasing ferrous
  iron into the cytoplasm via STEAP-3 reductase and DMT1 present in the endosome.
  Tf and TfR1 are recycled back the cell surface for further Tf binding. B) Under
  healthy conditions soluble tau traffics APP to the membrane where it acts to stabilize
  ferroportin for iron export,. C) PrPc increases Non-Transferrin-Binding-Iron (NTBI)
  uptake by acting as a ferrireductase and increasing ferrous iron near the exoplasmic
  cell membrane. In AD PrPC binding to amyloid oligomers disinhibits tau expression
  via the FYN pathway leading to increased APP expression at the cell surface. FYN
  activation also causes reduced NMDA expression, which leads to synapse dysfunction
  and cell death. D) Increased cell membrane cholesterol causes elevated β-secretase
  activity, which promotes Aβ42 levels along the amyloidogenic pathway. E) Mitochondrial
  proteins help to store and reduce excessive oxidation from the TCA cycle. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction is hypothesized to increase the labile iron pool. F) High extracellular
  iron leads to the influx of iron into the neuron via Ca2+ channels, leading to toxicity.
  G) Ischemia leads to hypoxia mediated HIF and IRP alterations; TfR1 expression is
  elevated and ferroportin expression is decreased leading to increased iron intake
  and ROS/RNS production,. H) Iron induced pTau aggregation throughout the neuron
  leads to microtubule destabilization and Aβ toxicity,.
