caption: 'Modulation of gene expression by PPARs and inflammatory transcription factors:
  transactivation and transrepression mechanisms. The activation of PPARs (a) and
  inflammatory transcription factors (b) modulates gene expression via specific response
  elements (RE), resulting mainly in the upregulation of proteins involved in several
  metabolic and inflammatory pathways, respectively. The two routes may connect through
  protein-protein interaction upstream to DNA-protein interaction (c). This transrepressive
  action of a pathway on the other is a basis for the anti-inflammatory/antioxidative
  properties of PPARs, and though less often mentioned, for the anti-PPAR properties
  of inflammatory/oxidative processes. Abbreviations: COX2, cyclooxygenase 2; ICAM,
  inducible cell adhesion molecule; PPRE, PPAR-responsive element; RXRα, retinoid
  acid X receptor α. The mechanisms by which metabolic changes and anti-inflammatory
  properties induced by PPARs interfere with the Warburg''s effect and cancer development
  are considered in the text.'
