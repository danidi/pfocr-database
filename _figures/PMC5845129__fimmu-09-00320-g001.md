caption: Schematic diagram for innate immune response against influenza A virus (IAV)
  infection. Intracellular detection of IAV infection by the host pathogen recognition
  receptors (PRRs) activates transcription factors nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
  of activated B cells, interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IRF7. The PRRs
  include retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein, melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5, and toll-like receptors. Then these activated transcription factors trigger
  the expression of type I and type III interferons (IFNs). IFNs secreted by the infected
  cells interact with their receptors, which results in activation of Janus kinase-signal
  transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway that governs the expression
  of various IFN-stimulated genes.
