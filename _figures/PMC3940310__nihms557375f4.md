caption: 'The role of endogenous fatty acid metabolism in the control of hepatic gene
  transcription. The generation of fatty acids within hepatic parenchymal cells affects
  the control of at least three transcription factors, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor α(PPARα), sterol regulatory element–binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), and forkhead
  box O1 (FoxO1). The mechanisms include the production of fatty acids by de novo
  lipogenesis (DNL) and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) (18:1, ω7) and polyunsaturated
  fatty acid (PUFA) (C20–22 ω3 and ω6 PUFA) synthesis. SREBP-1 nuclear abundance is
  well suppressed by C20–22 PUFA, and hepatic conversion of essential fatty acids
  to C20–22 PUFA suppresses SREBP-1 nuclear abundance and DNL. Because this pathway
  produces both C20 and C22 PUFAs, PPARα signaling can be affected. C20 PUFAs, but
  not C22 PUFAs, are robust activators of PPARα. FoxO1 activity is not affected by
  exogenous fatty acids or endogenous production of PUFAs. FoxO1 nuclear abundance,
  however, is regulated by mechanisms that control hepatic conversion of palmitoleic
  acid (16:1, ω7) to cis-vaccenic acid (18:1, ω7). Increased hepatic production of
  18:1, ω7 induces production of rictor, a component of mTORC2. mTORC2 phosphorylates
  Akt-S473, and active Akt phosphorylates FoxO1-S256. Phospho-FoxO1 is excluded from
  nuclei and degraded in the proteasome. The outcome is suppressed expression of genes
  involved in gluconeogenesis (GNG) and hepatic glucose production (HGP). The up (
  green) and down (red ) block arrows represent induction or repression of the pathway
  or transcription factor. Abbreviations: CTE1, cytosolic thioesterase-1; CYP4A, cytochrome
  P450-4A; Elovl, fatty acid elongase; G6Pase, glucose-6 phosphatase; mRNA, messenger
  ribonucleic acid; Pck1, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.'
