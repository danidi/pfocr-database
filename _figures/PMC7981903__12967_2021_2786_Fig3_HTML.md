caption: Role of GRP78 in cellular apoptosis. In the case of strong and persistent
  ER stress, GRP78 is upregulated, which promotes the production and release of Ca2+.
  GRP78 activates UPR signaling to upregulate CHOP and induce cellular apoptosis.
  Increased [Ca2+] induces apoptosis in a mitochondrial-dependent pathway by increasing
  Bax and decreasing Bcl-2 expression. In addition, Ca2+ released into the cytoplasm
  can also activate calpain. Activated calpain promotes the cleavage of caspase-12
  and mediates apoptosis through a cascade reaction. JNK is also activated by dimerized
  IRE1 via TRAF2-ASK1 signaling to induce apoptosis. Persistent ER stress can cause
  excess ROS production, and high ROS levels can induce ER stress, forming a vicious
  cycle. GRP78 can reduce the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to inhibit apoptosis
  by stabilizing the expression and activity of Raf-1
