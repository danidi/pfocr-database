caption: Schematic representation of the ‘classical’ cytokinin phosphorelay pathway
  from receptor to gene activation (right) and its ‘non-canonical’ role, independent
  of transcription but relying on AHKs and ARRs, in PIN1 trafficking during lateral
  root initiation (left). Dashed arrows represent direct phosphorylation events; arrows
  with chevron-shaped arrowhead represent trafficking pathways and arrows with triangle-shaped
  arrowhead represent signalling events; blunt-ended lines represent inhibition.
