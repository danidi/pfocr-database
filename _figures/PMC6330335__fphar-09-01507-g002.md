caption: Sortilin and SorLA regulate IL-6 family signaling. (A) CNTF binds to CNTFRα,
  this complex engages the heterodimer gp130/LIFRβ to induce JAK/STAT pathway signaling.
  Sortilin can bind to LIFRβ and enhance this JAK/STAT signaling. Sortilin also mediates
  soluble CNTF cellular uptake, and decreases associated signaling. (B) SorLA interacts
  with CLF-1. CLF-1 can form a complex with CLC and CNTFRα. If this complex is soluble,
  SorLA binds to CLF-1 and concentrates the complex on the membrane, enhancing interaction
  with gp130/LIFRβ and JAK/STAT signaling. If this complex is anchored to the membrane,
  SorLA binds to CLF-1 and mediates endocytosis of the complex, followed by its degradation,
  decreasing associated signaling. (C) SorLA can bind to IL-6 or IL-6R. Binding of
  IL-6 to membrane anchored IL-6R, in association with gp130 homodimer, induces cis
  signaling (JAK/STAT pathway). SorLA can bind IL-6R and inhibits IL-6 binding and
  subsequent signaling. IL-6 can also engage soluble IL-6R, associated with gp130
  homodimer, and induce trans signaling (NF-kB pathway). SorLA may bind to soluble
  IL-6 and act as a stabilizer, enhancing IL-6 half-life, and thus trans signaling.
  Additionally, SorLA negatively controls IL-6 turnover by binding to IL-6 or sIL-6R
  and mediating their endocytosis, followed by lysosomal degradation.
