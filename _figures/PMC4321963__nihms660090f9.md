caption: The proposed mechanism of PNR-induced, IL-13Rα2-mediated breast cancer cell
  migration and metastasis. PNR directly binds to the promoter region of IL-13Rα2
  to activate its transcription. The increase of IL-13Rα2 protein level in conjunction
  with IL-13 treatment activate downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK
  pathway, which leads to breast cancer cell migration and metastasis.
