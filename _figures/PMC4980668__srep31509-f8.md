caption: P4 activated the cSrc/AKT signaling pathway, which in turn induced activation
  of RSK1, subsequently causing p27 phosphorylation at T198 and increasing formation
  of the p27-RhoA complex, and eventually enhanced migration of breast cancer cells.
  P4 also activated the cSrc/ERK1/2 signaling pathway to induce IκBα activation and
  NFκB nuclear translocation, which in turn up-regulated the expression of RSK1 and
  p27. The increased expression of RSK1 and p27 are not required, but might have some
  degree of contributions, for the P4-induced migration enhancement in breast cancer
  cells.
