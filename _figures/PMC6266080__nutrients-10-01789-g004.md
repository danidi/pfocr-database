caption: LPL pathway and associated proteins. Major proteins associated with LPL pathway
  are illustrated in this scheme. LPL is transported to endothelial cells, and binds
  to GPIHBP1. LPL hydrolyzes triglycerides on lipoproteins. APOC3, angiopoietin-like
  protein 3 (ANGPTL3), and angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) play as inhibitor
  of LPL. On the other hand, APOC2 and APOA5 activate LPL. The fact that those proteins
  are significantly associated with ASCVD strongly suggests that LPL pathway is associated
  with the development of ASCVD.
