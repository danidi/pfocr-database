caption: Central role of the PA phosphatase in the synthesis of TAG and membrane phospholipids
  in yeast. The structures of CDP–DAG, PA, DAG, and TAG are shown with fatty acyl
  groups of 16 and 18 carbons with and without a single double-bond where indicated.
  The PA phosphatase (PAP) plays a major role in governing whether cells utilize PA
  for the synthesis of TAG via DAG or whether they utilize PA for the synthesis of
  membrane phospholipids via CDP–DAG. The PA phosphatase reaction is counterbalanced
  by the CTP-dependent DAG kinase (DGK) reaction. When the CDP–DAG pathway for phospholipid
  synthesis is blocked, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine may be synthesized
  from the DAG derived from the PA phosphatase reaction when cells are supplemented
  with choline and ethanolamine, respectively, via the CDP-choline and CDP-ethanolamine
  branches of the Kennedy pathway. In addition to its role in lipid synthesis, PA
  signals the transcriptional regulation of phospholipid synthesis genes via the Henry
  (Opi1/Ino2/Ino4) regulatory circuit. More comprehensive pathways of lipid synthesis,
  along with details of the Henry regulatory circuit, may be found in Refs. , . CDS,
  CDP–DAG synthase; DGAT, DAG acyltransferase; PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine;
  PC, phosphatidylcholine; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; CL,
  cardiolipin; Cho, choline; Etn, ethanolamine.
