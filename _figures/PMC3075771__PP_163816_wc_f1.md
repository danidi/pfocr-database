caption: Summary of major interactions and consequences of alterations on mitochondrial
  activity on photosynthesis. Plants obtain the energy they require for growth from
  ATP produced through mitochondrial respiration and photosynthesis. The export of
  excess NAD(P)H through the “malate valve” will allow the production of ATP during
  both photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation. The ATP is also needed for the
  conversion of triose phosphate to Suc. Additionally, the malate (and fumarate) produced
  by the TCA cycle is transported to the vacuole, where it is stored. By a yet unclear
  mechanism, the mitochondrial function triggers stomatal movement by controlling
  organic acid levels in both the vacuole and the apoplast, leading to a relative
  control of carbon dioxide assimilation. It is also hypothesized that an increased
  activity of l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the conversion
  of l-galactono-1,4-lactone to ascorbate and is coupled to the mitochondrial electron
  transport chain, leads to an up-regulation of photosynthesis by an unclear mechanism
  involving the modulation of gene expression in both cytosol and chloroplast, redox
  regulation, or merely efficient removal of photosynthate to support growth requirements.
  The dotted arrow represents an unknown mechanism. AOX, Alternative oxidase; e-,
  electron; GalDH, l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase; GL, l-galactono-1,4-lactone;
  OAA, oxaloacetic acid; Pyr, pyruvate; 1, dicarboxylate transporter; I, II, III,
  and IV, cytochrome pathway complex of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.
