caption: Inhibition mechanism of BMS-345541 and Purvalanol A in HTLV-1 infected cells
  results in blocking canonical NF-κB signaling pathway and cell cycle progression.
  In the absence of drug, hyperactive IKK complex phosphorylates IκB-α resulting in
  IκB-α degradation and p65/p50 translocation. The genes transcribed by p65/50 include
  anti-apoptotic genes which are responsible for survival of virus infected cells.
  In the presence of BMS-345541, the activity of IKK complex is inhibited which results
  in decreased IκB-α phosphorylation, therefore p65/p50 are kept in cytoplasm. Hence,
  the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins are decreased which make HTLV-1 infected
  cells more susceptible and sensitive to the action of the drug. Without drugs, cyclin
  E/CDK2 phosphorylates Rb and induces Rb degradation. The free E2F then transcribes
  genes which are necessary for G1/S transition. However, Purvalanol A inhibits CDK2
  (a non-essential protein in the life cycle of a cell) activity, as previously shown
  by us, which results in decreased Rb phsophorylation and inactivated E2F. Therefore,
  the infected cells may be blocked at the G1 checkpoint and simultaneously have lower
  viral expression.
