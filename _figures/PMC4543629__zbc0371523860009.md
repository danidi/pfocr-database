caption: Model of how γ-Pcdh constant domain phosphorylation by PKC affects dendrite
  arborization. γ-Pcdhs exist in cis multimers at the neuronal membrane (). The γ-Pcdh
  constant C terminus binds to and inhibits FAK (), which leads to reduced PKC activity
  () (left side, see the heat map legend). This allows the PKC target MARCKS to remain
  hypophosphorylated and to promote dendrite arborization via interaction with actin
  filaments and the membrane (). When γ-Pcdh phosphorylation at Ser-922 (A3 isoform;
  equivalent residue numbers in other isoforms) by PKC (circled P) is increased (right
  side), their ability to inhibit FAK is reduced, which leads to higher PKC activity,
  hyperphosphorylated MARCKS, and reduced dendrite arborization (such as that seen
  in Pcdhg mutant neurons; Ref. , right side, see heat map legend). PKC phosphorylation
  of γ-Pcdhs may be mediated by distinct PKC isozymes or subcellular pools rather
  than simply as a direct negative feedback loop. This may be important for keeping
  the signaling pathway balanced and allowing for transient, developmentally related
  increases and decreases in dendrite arborization.
