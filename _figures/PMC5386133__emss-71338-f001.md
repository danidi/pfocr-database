caption: 'Loss of EC-FAK induces chemosensitivity in malignant cells via the regulation
  of angiocrine factors. A, wild-type endothelial cells (EC). Upon DNA damage, EC-FAK
  induces () activation of the NF-κB pathway causing () increased translocation of
  the NF-κB subunit p65 into the nucleus and () elevated cytokine transcription and
  secretion. This increase in cytokine secretion by tumor-associated endothelial cells
  creates a chemoresistant niche protecting tumor cells from DNA damage. B, FAK-null
  ECs: In contrast, upon DNA damage in EC-Fak–null mice with established tumors, ()
  NF-κB activity is reduced () inhibiting p65 translocation into the nucleus, thus
  () decreasing cytokine transcription and secretion. Thus, loss of EC-Fak reduces
  the angiocrine signal that protects malignant cells from DNA damage. How other pathways,
  including NOTCH–JAG1 or TP53, affect angiocrine signaling controlled by FAK is currently
  unknown.'
