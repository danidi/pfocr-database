caption: Proposed sequence of events in MS. Graphic representation of the hypothesized
  cascade of mechanisms involved in AMS imbalance in MS. Red pathways 1a (as indicated
  by arrows) shows the possible instigator in AMS imbalance. Elongation of the Ranvier's
  node might induce a re‐distribution of Nav channels (eg, the persistent firing channels
  Nav1.6). High axonal Na+ entrance might promote an NCX inversion increasing the
  intracellular Ca2+ entrance (2, blue pathway), resulting in a higher probability
  of glutamate release from axon to myelin. At the same time, myelin lipid aberrations
  (red pathway, 1b) might reduce the axonal shielding from external ions, favoring
  Ca2+ entrance in the axon (where Cav are expressed). This effect might also add
  to that shown in 1a. Higher glutamate release triggers Ca2+ increase in the myelin,
  activating PAD enzymes to citrullinate myelin proteins (black pathway, 4). Release
  of citrullinated proteins might instigate an immune response against the debris.
  Ca2+ entrance might also activate the calpain‐cathepsin axis, detrimental for lysosomes,
  which ultimately would promote dMAG formation (violet pathway, 5). This effect instigates
  myelin detachment from its axon. Finally, Ca2+ increase in the myelin can also favor
  the translocation of PLA‐Iva enzymes, which affects the lysosomal functionality
  and lead to lipid biochemical changes. The latter alteration may consequently make
  the lipid membrane more permeable to external ions (including Ca2+, brown pathway,
  6). Detachment of myelin causes the retrieved blisters (7), causing AMS instability
  and hampering the lactate‐dependent signal to axonal mitochondria, instigating virtual
  hypoxia, axonal swelling (8), and, ultimately due to insufficient axonal trophic
  support, axonal degeneration (9). AMS = axo‐myelinic synapse; dMAG = degraded myelin
  associated glycoprotein; MAG = myelin associated glycoprotein; MS = multiple sclerosis;
  PAD = peptidyl arginine deiminase.
