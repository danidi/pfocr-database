caption: In both cell types, CXCR4, SDF-1, and MMP-1 are up-regulated compared to
  normal fibroblasts. Signaling through CXCR4 leads to activation of the ERK1/2 pathway,
  which is a component of the MAPK pathway, in CAFs and the MAPK pathway in activated
  fibroblasts. Both the MAPK and ERK1/2 pathways are known to stimulate MMP-1 and
  SDF-1 levels in other cell types [,,].
