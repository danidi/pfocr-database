caption: HPV induces, yet tolerates, replication stress (RS) to promote viral replication
  through the ATR-dependent RS response. Expression of E7 induces RS that activates
  the ATR/Chk1/E2F1 pathway. Increased expression of KDM6A and KDM6B represents a
  cellular defense to E7 expression, though whether this occurs in response to E7-induced
  RS is unclear. Despite high levels of KDM6B and p16 in E7-expressing cells, HPV
  circumvents oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) through Rb degradation, promoting
  aberrant proliferation. Increased expression of KDM6A leads to elevated levels of
  p21 that facilitate tolerance to RS by inhibiting PCNA. E7 maintains CDK2 activity
  as well as PCNA expression in the face of p21 activity, resulting in hyperproliferation
  and RS that constitutively activates an ATR-dependent DDR that HPV commandeers for
  replication. Dashed gray lines represent links that have not been examined experimentally.
