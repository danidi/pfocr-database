caption: 'Various signaling cascades can affect mitochondrial physiology, mediate
  mitochondrial radical formation or are connected to apoptotic signaling. Oxidative
  stress activates PKCβ leading to serine-phosphorylation of p66Shc, which subsequently
  translocates to the mitochondrial intermembrane space and associates with the TIM-TOM
  l protein import complex. Proapoptotic stimuli release p66Shc from the complex and
  via interaction with cytochrome c hydrogen peroxide is formed, which triggers the
  permeability transition pore and initiates apoptosis. Mitochondrial translocation
  has also been reported for p53 and p21Ras. Both molecules are assumed to sequester
  antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-family, thus promoting free radical formation
  and apoptosis. Furthermore, the stability of p53 is regulated by lysine-acetylation,
  which competes with ubiquitinylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. ROS
  may inactivate SIRT1 by oxidation of an essential structural Zn-finger that may
  result in p53 accumulation and mitochondrial translocation. Another example is TNF-signaling
  involving the ceramide pathway that increases mitochondrial superoxide formation
  at complex III. Mitochondria also respond very sensitively to oxidative stimuli
  or metabolic cues with enhanced electron leakage and free radical formation. This
  may alter the composition of mitochondrial nucleoids, protein-DNA complexes, and
  increase the mtDNA mutation rate. Similar to organization of nuclear DNA, mitochondrial
  sirtuins may regulate nucleoid plasticity.Abbreviations: SIRT, sirtuin, Ac, acetylation;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; MnSOD, manganese superoxide dismutase; Gpx, glutathione
  peroxidase; mTFA, mitochondrial transcription factor A.'
