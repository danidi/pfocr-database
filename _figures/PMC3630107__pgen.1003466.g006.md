caption: Each HSR regulator, denoted by common terminology, is indicated as a box
  and is grouped according to its presence in a multi-subunit complex or functional
  pathway (i.e., the proteasome or secretory pathway). Positive or negative effects
  on HSR regulation are indicated by either a green arrow or red line respectively.
  Positive regulators are further separated from negative regulators by grey shading
  in the background. At the center of the network, HSF1 integrates signals from the
  various regulators and establishes a coordinated HSR.
