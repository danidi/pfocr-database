caption: 'Proposed model for the role of LPS in generating inflammation and its relationship
  with obesity. Concept adapted from [–]. Altered mucosal barrier function due to
  reduced expression of glucagon like peptides 1 and 2 (GLP-1 and GLP-2) leads to
  altered mucosal function and reduced synthesis of tight junction proteins, Zonula
  Occludin-1 and Zonula Occludin-2 (ZO-1, ZO-2), increasing gut permeability. This
  allows LPS to enter the systemic circulation inducing the release of proinflammatory
  cytokines. Proinflammatory cytokines result in activation of a family of kinases
  JNK and IKK (inhibitor of NFkB kinase) that increase the expression of inflammatory
  and lipid metabolism genes. Subcutaneous administration of LPS, hyperglycaemia,
  and insulin resistance induces the same pathway by increasing the endoplasmic reticulum
  and mitochondrial stress. Type-2 diabetes, hyperglycaemia, and insulin resistance
  also cause macrophage infiltration and inflammatory cytokine release leading to
  the same process. HF: high fat diet [–].'
