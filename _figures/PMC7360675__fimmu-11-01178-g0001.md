caption: 'Extracellular and intracellular regulatory mechanisms of HLA-G expression.
  Variability in the HLA-G promoter region influences HLA-G expression by sensing
  and responding to the extracellular signals. Variations in the 3′ UTR region may
  modify mRNA stability or allow posttranscriptional regulation. HLA-G is not responsive
  to proinflammatory signals acting on the NF-κB pathway and to IFN-mediated stimulation.
  The HLA-G promoter region is unique among the HLA class I genes as it interacts
  with specific transcription factors activated by extracellular stimuli induced by
  hypoxia and heat shock, hormones such as glucocorticoids and progesterone, and cytokines
  including IL-10 and GM-CSF. HLA-G expression is posttranscriptionally regulated
  by genetic variations in the 3′ UTR, which contain several target sites for miRNAs
  and can bind specific RNA-binding proteins. These different regulations concur in
  the induction or inhibition of the expression of the HLA-G protein, which by alternative
  splicing of the mRNA can be produced in different isoforms: membrane-bound or soluble.
