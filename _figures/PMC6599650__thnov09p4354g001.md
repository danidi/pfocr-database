caption: Schematic illustration of the formation of pH- and redox-responsive, methotrexate-loaded,
  APP-derived micelles via self-assembly in aqueous solution. Also depicted is the
  ability of these micelles to induce ROS production and act via the NF-κB signaling
  pathway to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. aAPP, cis-aconityl APP; APP, trisodium
  L-ascorbyl 2-phosphate 6-palmitate; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; MTX, methotrexate;
  ROS, reactive oxygen species; ss, disulfide bond.
