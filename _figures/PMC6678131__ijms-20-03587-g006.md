caption: 'Role of LOXL3 in tumor. (a) Tumor progression and metastasis: LOXL3 physically
  interacts with SNAIL in perinuclear region, preventing the SNAIL degradation and
  nuclear export. SNAIL represses the CDH1 (E-cadherin gene) transcription, which
  induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) phosphorylates
  SNAIL and upregulates LOXL3 expression. The phosphorylation at Ser11 increases the
  interaction of SNAIL and LOXL3, as well as of SNAIL and HDAC1 and 2. SNAIL and HDACs
  complex is stabilized in the nucleus and promotes upregulation of proliferation
  markers, such as AJUBA and CCND1 (cyclin D1 gene). (b) Genomic stability and sustained
  proliferation: LOXL3 interacts with proteins involved in genomic integrity, as BRCA2,
  SMC1A, NUMA1, RAD51, and MSH2, with consequent DNA repair and evasion of apoptosis.
  Additionally, interaction of LOXL3 with BRCA2, SMC1A and NUMA1 is important to mitotic
  completion, which contributes to melanocyte transformation. (c) Invasion and metastasis:
  LOXL3 expression is downstream from TGF-β signaling pathway in gastric cancer. LOXL3
  is essentially localized in the nucleus and the expression correlates with prognosis
  of patients. Created with BioRender.'
