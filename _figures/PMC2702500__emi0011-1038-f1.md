caption: 'Metabolic reconstruction of Db. autotrophicum HRM2 based on known growth
  substrates and metabolic capacities. Complete oxidation of organic substrates and
  CO2 fixation under autotrophic growth conditions proceeds via the Wood–Ljungdahl
  pathway (blue box). The sulfate reduction is given in a dark red box, heterodisulfide
  reduction is given in a dark orange box and electron transfer from Qmo to sulfate
  reduction is given in an orange box. All selenium-dependent proteins are marked
  by dark grey backgrounds and an asterisk (*). The cytoplasmic membrane is given
  in light grey. Arrows indicate metabolic flows; dashed lines indicate assumed or
  putative electron flows. For reasons of simplicity, cytochromes, multihaem proteins
  and the following proteins with one or more paralogues are displayed only once in
  the figure: Acs, CysAW, EtfAB, FdhAB, GlpAB, HdrA, HdrL, MvhD, PorABC, RnfA–E, Sat,
