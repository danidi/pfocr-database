caption: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the Cell Cycle
  Pathway in Trypanosoma cruzi-infected myoblasts. The Cell Cycle Pathway obtained
  from the KEGG platform was used as template to highlight the effect of Brazil (A),
  CL (B), Tulahuen (C), and Y (D) strain in L6E9 rat myoblasts. Blue boxes indicate
  genes that were significantly upregulated (>1.5-fold), and red boxes indicate those
  that were significantly downregulated (<-1.5-fold). Yellow boxes indicate genes
  that showed no significant alteration in infected vs. control cultures, and white
  boxes indicate genes that were absent in the analysis (i.e., those that for any
  reason did not match the exclusion criteria; e.g., a positive signal in all four
  biological replicas of each group). Distinct stimuli can regulate the expression
  of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and transcription factors (E2F5,
  and E2F1, 2, and 3) that coordinate cell cycle progression, DNA biosynthesis, and
  S-phase protein synthesis.
