caption: Systematic analysis of host-pathogen interactions. Results of genome-wide
  KEGG reaction pair network analysis summarized as a graph of metabolic reactions
  for which the corresponding gene activity is changing during infection (|log2 fold
  change| > log2 1.5 and FDR < 0.05 for at least one time point p.i. [data from three
  biological replicates per time point]). Nodes represent metabolites, and edges represent
  reactions according to the KEGG main reaction pairs. Reaction directions are indicated
  according to the KEGG kgml pathway maps (the arrows do not necessarily correspond
  to reaction reversibility). Only metabolic paths connecting changing reactions with
  length of ≥3 are shown. G1P, glucose-1-phosphate; GAP, d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate;
  S7P, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate; DSHA, 4,5-9,10-diseco-3-hydroxy-5,9,17-tri-oxoandrosta-1(10),2-diene-4-oic
  acid. Upregulated genes had a log2 fold change > log2 1.5 and FDR < 0.05 for at
  least one time point, and downregulated genes had a log2 fold change <−log2 1.5
  and FDR < 0.05 for at least one time point. Increased metabolites had a log2 fold
  change > log2 1.5 and FDR < 0.05 for at least one time point, and decreased metabolites
  had a log2 fold change <−log2 1.5 and FDR < 0.05 for at least one time point. Subgraphs
  were drawn with Cytoscape and manually classified into KEGG pathways (see  in the
  supplemental material).
