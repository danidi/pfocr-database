caption: 'The role of the endosomal Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) in remodelling of
  the infarcted heart. The study by De Kleijn et al. suggests that endosomal TLR7
  may be activated in infarct leucocytes, presumably by single-stranded RNA (ssRNA)
  released by dying cardiomyocytes, accentuating the immune response and promoting
  extracellular matrix degradation through release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
  Several important questions remain to be answered: (i) How does ssRNA find its way
  to leucocyte endosomes to activate TLR7? Receptor-mediated endocytosis and autophagic
  pathways may be implicated. Moreover, release of high-mobility group box protein
  1 (HMGB1) following infarction may prime ssRNA for endocytosis. (ii) Which cells
  exhibit TLR7 activation? TLR7 is constitutively expressed by dendritic cells and
  B lymphocytes and is markedly induced following inflammation in macrophages and
  in non-immune cell types. (iii) Which downstream signals mediate the effects of
  TLR7 in the infarcted heart? Following interaction with ssRNA in endosomes, TLR7
  dimerizes and may activate nuclear factor (NF)-κB and mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) through a myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88)-dependent
  pathway, thus inducing synthesis of cytokines and chemokines. TLR7-mediated MMP
  secretion may also play a role in mediating cardiac rupture and adverse remodelling
  of the infarcted heart. Additional symbols: IL, interleukin; TNF, tumour necrosis
  factor; IRAK, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase.'
