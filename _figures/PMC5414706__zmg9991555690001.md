caption: After agonist binding, GPCRs can be directed into distinct plasma membrane
  microdomains such as lipid rafts (Ai) or, after activation and subsequent desensitization
  (Aii), several GPCRs are known to undergo endocytosis via clathrin dependent or
  independent mechanisms (B). CCPs allow accumulation of GPCR/arrestin complexes that
  can activate arrestin-mediated mitogenic signaling (C). After internalization, GPCRs
  will accumulate in endosomal compartments where they can continue or reactivate
  heterotrimeric G protein signaling from the endosomal membrane, in addition to scaffolding
  arrestin to activate G protein-independent signal responses (D and E). Some GPCRs
  are differentially sorted to a distinct endosomal population termed pre-EEs or VEEs
  (D), via recruitment and binding of the PDZ protein GIPC at the CCP. The VEE sorts
  receptors to the regulated, sequence-directed plasma membrane recycling pathway
  and targeting of GPCRs to this compartment generates a sustained MAPK signaling
  response, although it is unknown whether other pathways, including G protein signaling,
  are activated in this compartment. Other GPCRs are directly routed to the EE, where
  they are differentially sorted between recycling and degradative/lysosomal pathways,
  leading to heterotrimeric G protein plasma membrane signal resensitization or signal
  termination, respectively. Reinsertion in to the plasma membrane of GPCRs targeted
  to the recycling pathway (F) exhibits distinct spatiotemporal patterns of insertion,
  either transient or persistent (see text), although its role in spatial control
  of signaling in addition to resensitization is unknown. G-GTP, GTP-bound form of
  the G protein; MVB, multivesicular body.
