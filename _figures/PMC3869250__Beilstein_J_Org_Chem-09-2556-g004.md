caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for antimycins. The antimycin biosynthetic
  pathway is described in detail in the text. C = condensation; A, adenylation; T,
  thiolation; KR, ketoreduction; KS, ketosynthase; AT, acyltransferase; ACP, acyl
  carrier protein; TE, thioesterase; *AntP is a pathway-specific kynureninase that
  is encoded by L- and I-form ant gene clusters.
