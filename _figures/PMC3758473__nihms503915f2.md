caption: The circadian clock mechanism involves transcription-translation feedback
  loops comprised of a set of core clock genes. In mammals, the circadian clock is
  composed of a primary negative feedback loop involving the genes, Clock/Npas2, Bmal1,
  Period1 (Per1), Per2, Cryptochrome1 (Cry1) and Cry2. CLOCK/NPAS2 and BMAL1 are basic
  helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS-domain containing transcription factors that activate
  transcription of the Per and Cry genes. The resulting PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize,
  translocate to the nucleus and interact with the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex to inhibit
  their own transcription. With time, the PER-CRY repressor complex is degraded, and
  CLOCK:BMAL1 can then activate a new cycle of transcription. The secondary autoregulatory
  feedback loop is composed of REV-ERBα that is a direct target of CLOCK:BMAL1 transcription
  activator complex. REV-ERBα feeds back to repress Bmal1 transcription and competes
  with RORa to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (RREs)
  in the Bmal1 promoter. In addition to the transcriptional activators and repressors,
  post-translational modification and degradation of circadian clock proteins are
  critical steps for determining circadian periodicity. Key kinases for PER (and CRY)
  phosphorylation are Casein kinase 1δ (CK1δ) and CK1ε. One of the roles for phosphorylation
  of clock proteins is to target them for polyubiquitination and degradation by the
  26S proteosomal pathway. Both β-TCRP1 and FBXL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes have
  been implicated in targeting the PER and CRY proteins, respectively, for degradation.
