caption: Schematic diagram of neutral lipid and phospholipid biosynthetic pathways.
  The effect of Plin2 overexpression on levels of key enzymes and lipids involved
  in TG, CE, and phospholipid synthesis is depicted. In brief, a primary de novo route
  towards neutral lipid and phospholipid biosynthesis is the Kennedy or glycerol phosphate
  pathway, which begins in the ER with G-3-P and fatty acyl-CoA catalyzed by GPAT
  to form LPA, a precursor for PA, which is then converted to DG by the enzyme PAP
  (reviewed in Refs.  and ). DG is also produced via the MG pathway (dominant in hepatocytes
  and adipocytes) where MG is converted to DG by MGAT (). Alternatively, a minor de
  novo pathway for LPA biosynthesis (and ultimately TG and phospholipids) also exists
  in peroxisomes (not depicted here) that uses dihydroxyacetone phosphate to produce
  LPA (). Once DG is formed, it can be used for TG synthesis (by way of DGAT) or go
  forward to produce PC via the enzyme CCT (, ). In the Golgi, PC is then converted
  to SM by SMS (). In the ER, CE is produced by the action of ACAT-1 () and can be
  transported to lipid droplets via CETP () or removed from the cell by SR-B1 ().
  In lipid droplets, TG are hydrolyzed by the combined action of Plin1, ATGL, CGI-58,
  and HSL to produce DG and then MG (reviewed in Ref. ). HSL can also convert CE to
  Chol () but Chol is produced via the mevalonate pathway as well, regulated by HMGR
  (). Alternatively, Chol/CE can enter the cell via the unidirectional LDLR () or
  by a minor pathway regulated by SR-B1. Upward arrows designate increased expression
  compared with control cells. Downward arrows depict decreased expression. No arrow
  signifies that no significant changes were observed. See Glossary for definitions
  of abbreviations.
