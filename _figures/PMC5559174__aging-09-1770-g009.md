caption: The normalized counts for each gene were correlated with the increase in
  calorie restriction (CR) level by Pearson correlation method. The pathway is colored
  based on a cut-off of an absolute correlation coefficient higher than 0.3. Red indicates
  a positive correlation with increasing CR level while green indicates a negative
  correlation. (A) glycolysis. (B) TCA cycle (C) fatty acid β-oxidation. (D) gluconeogenesis.
