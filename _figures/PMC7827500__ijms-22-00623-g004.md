caption: Effects of GCs on skeletal muscle cells. GCs bind to their receptor (GC receptor,
  or GR) and lead to protein catabolism (involving increased myostatin production)
  and amino acids release. Glycogen synthesis is reduced through increased GSK3 and
  reduced GC. Finally, insulin resistance is also induced by GCs through reduced Akt,
  GLUT4, and IR pathway.
