  showing metabolites detected in our study. A, Metabolites shown in bold font were
  detected in our initial liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of plasma
  and erythrocyte samples, underlining indicates metabolites with specific formulas
  detected by 13C labeling, single asterisks represent metabolites with redundant
  formulas detected by 13C labeling, italicized metabolites were confirmed by tandem
  mass spectrometry, and double asterisks represent enzyme identification numbers
  for which the P. falciparum enzyme sequences had domains matching those in enzyme
  sequences from plants. B, Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction data showing
  expression in the late asexual stage of 14 Plasmodium falciparum genes identified
  in ortholog searches (Table ). Primer pairs used are shown in Table  and indicated
  at the top of the lanes. bp, base pairs; M, 1 kb Plus DNA ladder (Invitrogen); −,
