caption: A working hypothesis for how the PGRN/PIRO axis regulates the formation of
  multinucleated osteoclasts. RANK downstream may induce endogenous PGRN expression
  on day 2 in differentiating osteoclasts (pathway I/autocrine), which would then
  act on an unknown PGRN receptor(s), triggering a second wave of downstream signaling,
  which culminates in the induction of PIRO on day 3 of differentiation. Up-regulation
  of PIRO is responsible for cell fusion. Pathway II, a paracrine way, depicts the
  provision of PGRN from other cell types stimulated by RANKL-engaged OCs, which leads
  to the activation of unknown PGRN receptor(s) expressed in differentiating osteoclasts
  to induce PIRO.
