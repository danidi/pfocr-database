caption: Schematic illustration of the mechanisms through which the nutritional supplements
  discussed in the present review may function to promote skeletal muscle adaptation.
  Leucine has been shown to independently activate the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) signaling pathway through binding to Sestrin2, which increases protein synthesis.
  Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA)—especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
  and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)—serve as a component of phospholipids in muscle membranes,
  and not only enhance protein kinase activity, but also improve mitochondrial respiratory
  sensitivity to ADP. Vitamin D is metabolized to the active form, 1,25(OH)2D3, via
  the liver and kidney, and vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired skeletal
  muscle function. Creatine has been shown to enhance resistance exercise performance,
  which stimulates anabolism through its integral role in the phosphocreatine energy
  system. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) reduce inflammation and oxidative
  stress, which may contribute to muscle loss in older adults. ADP, adenosine di-phosphate;
  ATP, adenosine tri-phosphate; A, adenosine; P, phosphate; E, energy; COX, cyclo-oxygenase;
  Leu, leucine; 4EBP1, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1.
