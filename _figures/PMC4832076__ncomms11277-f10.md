caption: Shown is the concluding summary diagram of this study. First, our findings
  suggest that PTHrP is predominantly expressed by cells in the dental follicle and
  root surface, where active cementogenensis takes place. Second, our findings collectively
  suggest that the PPR signalling in Osx+ dental mesenchymal progenitors is important
  in several critical aspects, such as cell survival, proliferation and differentiation
  into cementoblasts. Deletion of the PPR signalling in these progenitors leads to
  defects in survival, proliferation and differentiation of these cells, leading to
  truncated dental roots and dysregulated cementum formation. Furthermore, HDAC4 appears
  to be one of the major downstream mediators of the PPR signalling in dental mesenchymal
  progenitors.
