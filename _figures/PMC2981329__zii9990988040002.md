caption: Schematic of heme biosynthesis in bacteria. The first universal heme precursor
  is δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). ALA can be synthesized by one of two routes, although
  no bacteria are known to use both ALA synthesis pathways. (A) Succinyl-CoA and glycine
  are converted into ALA by ALA synthase (hemA). HemA, however, has been identified
  only in members of the Alphaproteobacteria. (B) Most bacteria synthesize ALA from
  glutamyl-tRNAGlu by the C5pathway using GtrA and HemL. (C) The rest of the heme
  biosynthesis pathway is highly conserved. ALA dehydratase (hemB) synthesizes porphobilinogen
  (PBG) from two ALA molecules. PBG deaminase (hemC) converts four PBG molecules into
  hydroxymethylbilane. Linear hydroxymethylbilane is fused into a ring by uroporphyrinogen
  III synthase (hemD) to make uroporphyrinogen III. Four carboxyl groups are removed
  by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (hemE) to make coproporphyrinogen III. Next, a
  coproporphyrinogen oxidase, either HemN (oxygen independent) or HemF (oxygen dependent),
  converts coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX. Protoporphyrinogen IX
  is then oxidized to protoporphyrin IX by a protoporphyrinogen oxidase, either HemG
  (O2 independent) or HemY (O2 dependent) (, ). Finally, ferrochelatase (hemH) catalyzes
  the protoporphyrin IX chelation of ferrous iron to form protoheme. This protoheme
  can be utilized directly or modified further before being used as a prosthetic group
  in hemoproteins.
