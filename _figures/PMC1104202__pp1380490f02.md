caption: 'The carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. The names of the major carotenoids
  present in C. reinhardtii are in bold. Pigments in brackets have not yet been observed
  in C. reinhardtii. Full enzyme names are as follows: DXS, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate
  synthase; DXR, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase; CMS, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  synthase; CMK, 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase; MCS, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; HMS, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate
  synthase; IDS, isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate synthase; IDI,
  isopentenyl diphosphate:dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase; GGPS, geranylgeranyl
  pyrophosphate synthase; PSY, phytoene synthase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; ZDS, ζ-carotene
  desaturase; CRTISO, carotenoid isomerase; LCYB, lycopene β-cyclase; LCYE, lycopene
  ɛ-cyclase; CHYB, carotene β-hydroxylase; CHYE, carotene ɛ-hydroxylase; ZEP, zeaxanthin
  epoxidase; VDE, violaxanthin deepoxidase; NSY, neoxanthin synthase; LSY, loroxanthin
  synthase; BKT, carotene β-ketolase; and GGR, geranylgeranyl reductase. In the case
  of multiple commonly used synonyms, see ; abbreviations indicative of enzymatic
  function were preferred. Throughout the text, the same abbreviations, in capital
  letters, are used for protein and gene designations, the latter being italicized.
