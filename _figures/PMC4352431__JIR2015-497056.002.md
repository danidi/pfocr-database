caption: The proposed signalling pathway of CD69. After binding a putative ligand
  (CD69L) that is most probably a membrane bound protein, the cytoplasmatic tail of
  CD69 associates with Jak3 kinase. Jak3 recruits and phosphorylates the transcription
  factor Stat5. Phosphorylated Stat5 (Stat5-P) dimerizes in the active form and translocates
  to the nucleus where it can regulate the gene transcription.
