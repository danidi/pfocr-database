caption: Model for the immune stimulatory mechanism of the rim101Δ mutant. When C. neoformans
  enters the host, it senses host environmental cues (elevated pH, increased CO2,
  high temperature) and uses the Rim101 signaling pathway to adaptively regulate various
  cellular structures. These adaptations include the organization of its cell wall
  and the production/attachment of its polysaccharide capsule. Proper cell surface
  regulation prevents recognition by innate immune receptors. Without Rim101 regulation,
  the cell wall becomes highly disorganized, resulting in increased chitosan levels,
  a dramatic increase in chito-oligomer exposure, and impaired capsule attachment.
  These cell surface defects allow enhanced detection by CARD9- and MyD88-dependent
  innate immune receptors, leading to increased inflammatory cytokine secretion by
  host immune cells.
