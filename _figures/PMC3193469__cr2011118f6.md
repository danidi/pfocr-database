caption: Model of GA-induced DELLA protein degradation and the regulation of PIF protein
  function. The formation of GA-GID1-DELLA complex in the presence of GA promotes
  the recruitment of DELLA by SCFSLY1/GID2 E3 complex. DELLA protein degradation releases
  growth-promoting transcription factors from sequestration, enabling previously inactive
  GA response genes to become activated.
