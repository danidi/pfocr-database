caption: Drug-induced protein degradation. A schematic summary of our findings is
  shown. DSF and NCX4016 undergo metabolism in cultured cells and human tissues to
  generate metabolites that can trigger cysteine-conjugating adducts (in case of DSF)
  or nitrosylate the cysteines and tyrosines as in case of NCX4016. The drugs we used
  can also perturb the thiol pool and induce protein glutathionylation. Our studies
  showed that the drug-induced modifications in redox-sensitive proteins trigger their
  degradation through the proteasomal pathway. Besides human p53, NF-κB, ALDH and
  UBE1 reported in this study, the electrophilic drugs have been shown to interact
  specifically with O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase () and glutathione S-transferase
  P1 (), which are highly expressed in human cancers. The loss of proteins may occur
  after polyubiquitination or without ubiquitin tagging as has been shown for the
  oxidized proteins (,. To what extent the proteins modified at cysteines by the drugs
  are accessible to reducing enzymes such as the glutaredoxin is not understood.
