caption: Hypothalamic actions of manganese (Mn) in the control of prepubertal luteinizing
  hormone- releasing hormone (LHRH) in the rat. Note that in the POA/RHA region, Mn
  induces IGF-1 secretion from neurons and glia to stimulate KP synthesis. Once released,
  KP binds its GPR54 receptors on LHRH neurons causing increased neuronal activity.
  LHRH neuronal dendrites travel caudally into the MBH where they release the peptide
  from their terminals directly into the hypophyseal portal vessels within the median
  eminence. In addition, Mn also acts downstream within the MBH to facilitate LHRH
  release from the nerve terminals by directly activating the sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway.
  POA/RHA, preoptic area/rostral hypothalamic area; IGF1, insulin like growth factor
  1; GPR54, G protein receptor 54; KP, kisspeptin; MBH, medial basal hypothalamus,
  sGC, soluble guanosine cyclase; cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; PKG, protein
  kinase G.
