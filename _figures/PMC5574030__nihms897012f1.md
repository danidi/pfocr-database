caption: 'An overview of central carbon metabolism. Enzymes extensively discussed
  in this review are named in blue, while discussed multienzyme complexes are boxed
  in red. Metabolites are either shown by their names or black dots. (A) Glucose is
  consumed through the central pathway of glycolysis, or generated by gluconeogenesis,
  which shuttles into energy metabolism and anabolic biosynthetic pathways. The product
  of glycolysis, pyruvate, is shuttled to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Then,
  the produced acetyl-CoA is directed to either fatty acid synthetase, or the TCA
  cycle protein complex. Meanwhile, ribose-5-phosphate and serine are produced from
  glycolytic intermediates and shunted into de novo purine biosynthesis, which is
  promoted by the purinosome. (B) L-Glutamine is converted to cytidine triphosphate
  through de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. Used acronyms: hexokinase (HK); glucose-6-phosphate
  isomerase (GPI); phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1); fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase);
  triose phosphate isomerase (TIM); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH);
  phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK); phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM); phosphoenolpyruvate
  carboxykinase (PEPCK); pyruvate kinase (PK); pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH); formylglycinamidine
  ribonucleotide synthase (FGAMS); inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH); adenylosuccinate
  synthetase (ADSS); citrate synthase (CS); acetyl-CoA oxidase (ACO); isocitrate dehydrogenase
  (DH); succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS); fumarase (FM); malate dehydrogenase (MD); carbamoyl-phosphate
  synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD); cytidine triphosphate
  synthase (CTPS).'
