caption: Mitochondrial stress response pathways. (A) Recognition and selective degradation
  of damaged mitochondria is mediated by mitophagy. The kinase PINK1 is stabilized
  specifically on damaged mitochondria where it recruits the ubiquitin ligase Parkin,
  which ubiquitinates multiple mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Ubiquitinated
  mitochondria are then engulfed by autophagosomes and trafficked to lysosomes where
  they are degraded. (B) The kinase GCN2, which is activated during mitochondrial
  dysfunction, mediates translation attenuation during mitochondrial dysfunction by
  phosphorylating the translation initiation factor eIF2α, which serves to reduce
  the influx of proteins into mitochondria. (C) Accumulation of mislocalized mitochondrial
  proteins in the cytosol stimulates proteasome activity to limit the accumulation
  of the toxic proteins in a pathway dubbed UPRam (unfolded protein response activated
  by mistargeted proteins). (D) The UPRmt is regulated by the competing organelle
  targeting sequences in the transcription factor ATFS-1. If ATFS-1 is imported into
  the mitochondrial matrix via the MTS, the transcription factor is degraded. However,
  if ATFS-1 cannot be imported due to mitochondrial dysfunction, it is trafficked
  to the nucleus, via the NLS, to activate transcription.
