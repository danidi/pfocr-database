caption: In this very simplified depiction, three main pathways, the IIS, TOR and
  mitochondrial pathway, are indicated. The pro-ageing activities of these pathways
  are conserved across species, with energy sensors, such as AMPK, as potentially
  important hubs in the complex networks that integrate them. However, it is important
  to note potential dissimilarities among species as well. Most, if not all, defects
  in the mitochondrial respiratory chain are lethal or cause disease in humans, but
  can increase lifespan in nematodes or yeast. In mammals, mitochondria play an important
  part in signalling apoptosis, which can either drive or retard ageing, depending
  on the cell type. There is evidence that many longevity signals converge on members
  of the FOXO and sirtuin protein families, which can interact. Note that SIR proteins
  can both activate and repress FOXO. Moreover, the effects of FOXO and SIR2 in cells
  can be either beneficial (for example, increasing antioxidant defence) or detrimental
  (for example, apoptosis), and may or may not promote organismal survival. For example,
  in mammals, SIRT1 dampens apoptosis by repressing FOXO, but also by repressing BAX
  activation, thereby preventing its oligomerization into the mitochondria outer membrane
  (cross), which normally triggers permeabilization of the membrane and release of
  soluble apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, into the cytosol. Apoptosis can
  be beneficial, for example, by eliminating damaged cells and preventing cancer,
  or can be detrimental, by eliminating irreplaceable cells, such as neurons.
