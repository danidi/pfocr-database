caption: 'Different models of Hedgehog pathway signaling. (A) Type I ligand-independent
  cancers harbor inactivating mutations in Patched 1 protein (PTCH) or activating
  mutations in Smoothened (SMO) leading to constitutive activation of the Hedgehog
  (Hh) pathway even in the absence of the Hh ligand. (B) Type II ligand-dependent
  autocrine cancers both produce and respond to the Hh ligand leading to support tumor
  growth and survival. (C) Type III ligand-dependent paracrine cancers secrete the
  Hh ligand which is received by the stromal cells leading to pathway activation in
  the stroma. The stroma in turn feeds back various signals such as IGF, Wnt, VEGF
  to the tumor tissue leading to its growth or survival. (D) Type IIIb reverse paracrine
  tumors receive Hh secreted from the stroma leading to pathway activation in the
  tumor cells and upregulation of survival signals. (E) Cancer stem cells (CSCs):
  Hh signaling occurs only in the self-renewing CSCs, from the Hh ligand produced
  either by the CSCs or by the stroma. CSC will give rise to more Hh pathway dependent
  CSCs or possibly may differentiate into Hh-pathway negative tumor cells comprising
  the bulk of the tumor. Reprinted from: Scales, S.J. and de Sauvage, F.J. (2009)
