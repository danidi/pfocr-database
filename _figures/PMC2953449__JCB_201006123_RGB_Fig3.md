caption: The different effects of gut- and brain-derived serotonin on the osteoblast.
  The free circulating form of gut-derived serotonin directly signals to the osteoblast
  by binding to the Htr1b receptor. This binding inhibits the phosphorylation of CREB
  by PKA, leading to decreased expression of Cyclin (Cyc) genes and decreased osteoblast
  proliferation. As a result, bone formation is slowed down. In contrast, serotonergic
  neurons of the dorsal raphe (DR) signal to VMH neurons via the Htr2c receptor to
  inhibit the synthesis of epinephrine and thereby decrease sympathetic tone. This
  decrease is relayed in osteoblasts by decreased signaling via the β2 adrenergic
  receptor (Adrβ2), which negatively controls osteoblast proliferation via a molecular
  clock gene/cyclinD1 (Cyc D1) cascade and positively regulates bone resorption via
  activation of a PKA/ATF4-dependent pathway, leading to increased synthesis of Rankl,
  an activator of osteoclast differentiation and function. The inhibition of sympathetic
  activity by brain-derived serotonin thus results in increased formation and decreased
  resorption. Solid lines, direct actions; broken lines, indirect mechanisms.
