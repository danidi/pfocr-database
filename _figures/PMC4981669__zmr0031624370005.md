caption: Possible mechanism for the antagonistic effect of Lpp and RNA in innate immune
  stimulation in monocytes and macrophages. The induction of IFN-β production by whole
  bacteria in human primary monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) is triggered
  by S. aureus RNA sensed by TLR7 and TLR8, which activates the TAK1-IKKβ-IRF5 signaling
  pathway. TLR2 activation by Lpp suppresses the RNA-induced production of IFN-β.
  As both TLR2 and TLR8 use the same adaptor molecule MyD88 in TAK1-dependent and
  TAK1-independent pathways, a depletion of MyD88 is the consequence (). Another explanation
  for TLR2's overruling the TLR8 signaling is their different locations; Lpp can immediately
  activate TLR2 at the host cell surface, while TLR8 activation usually affords phagocytosis
  and phagolysosomally mediated release of RNA, which is unfavorable in the competition
  for MyD88. IKKβ, a serine kinase which plays a key role in the NF-κB signaling pathway
  by phosphorylating inhibitors in the inhibitor/NF-κB complex; IRF5, interferon regulatory
  factor 5; Lpp, lipoproteins/lipopeptides; MyD88, myeloid differentiation primary
  response protein 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer; ssRNA, single-strand
  RNA; TAK1, ubiquitin-dependent kinase of MKK and IKK. TLR7 and TLR8 are activated
  by ribonucleoside analogs.
