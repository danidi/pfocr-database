caption: A schematic model of the anticancer mechanism of physalin B in HCT116 cells.
  Physalin B induces mito-ROS generation resulting in UPP inhibition and incomplete
  non-canonical autophagy response. Autophagosome/lysosome fusion is blocked due to
  the inhibition of functions of microtubules and F-actin microfilaments, leading
  to autophagy substrates accumulation which accelerates apoptosis. Besides, MAPK
  pathways are sustainedly activated and partially mediate autophagy response and
  apoptosis in physalin B-treated cells.

  induces incomplete autophagic response in human colon cancer cells in vitro.
