caption: Our correlative data, together with previous findings reporting in cultured
  cells a direct effect of resistin on the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α,
  are compatible with the existence of a multi-cytokine resistin pathway which is
  associated with several IR/LGI-related risk factors and major adverse cardiovascular
  events (MACE).
