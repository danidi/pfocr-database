caption: Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) canonical signaling pathway. Upon ligand binding,
  IFNγR1 and IFNγR2 oligomerize and transphosphorylate, activating Janus activated
  kinase (JAK) 1 and JAK2. These, in turn, phosphorylate IFNγR1, creating a docking
  site for the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1. Phosphorylated
  STAT1 homodimerizes in an antiparallel configuration, forming a complex gamma-activated
  factor (GAF), which translocates to the nucleus and binds to gamma-activated site
  (GAS), located at the promoters of primary response genes, increasing their transcription.
  Upon induction, transcription factor interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) binds
  to interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and enhances the transcription
  of several secondary response genes responsible for several immunomodulatory functions.
  Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins negatively regulate the IFN-γ pathway
  by inhibiting JAKs and STAT1 phosphorylation. Through dephosphorylation and deacetylation,
  the configuration of STAT1 homodimers reverts to parallel, triggering their exit
  from the nucleus.
