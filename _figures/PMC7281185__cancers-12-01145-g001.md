caption: Impact of nitric oxide (NO) in senescence-mediated signaling pathways. NO
  plays important roles in different senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
  signaling pathways. Exogenous and endogenous NO can cause DNA damage that can lead
  to protein kinase ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated protein (ATM) and Chk2 activation,
  or NF-κB activation and interleukin 6 (IL-6)/IL-8 gene transcription. All these
  changes can induce the initiation of cellular senescence programs. NO is also able
  to induce direct modifications in NF-κB, either by S-nitrosylating both p60/p65
  NF-κB subunits and leading to SASP gene transcription inhibition, or by S-nitrosylating
  the NF-κB kinase inhibitor subunit α (IKKα), which results in NF-κB inhibition.
  S-nitrosylation can also affect the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway
  by leading to the inhibition of its activation. Moreover, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2),
  a prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secretion inducer, is also an NO target. The S-nitrosylation
  of COX2 stimulates its activity and induces anti-tumor immunity suppression. Another
  group of SASP factors altered by NO are chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1 and
  CXCL12, which can transcriptionally and translationally be decreased in response
  to NO donors, thus reducing immune cell recruitment.
