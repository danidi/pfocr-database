caption: Novel therapies for age-related diseases target key cellular processes in
  ageing cells. Senolytic drugs include dasatinib, quercetin and navitoclax. Dasatinib
  and quercetin inhibit tyrosine kinases, and navitoclax inhibits anti-apoptotic family
  members of the B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) protein family. The secretory associated
  senescence phenotype (SASP) is regulated by mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR),
  and mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin can reduce the presence of SASP factors in
  senescent fibroblasts. mTOR inhibitors also promote autophagy and the apoptosis
  of fibroblasts in lungs with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Rupatadine has
  also been shown to reduce cellular senescence and, potentially, SASP by preventing
  the activation of the p53–p21 pathway and by attenuating the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein-β (C/EBPβ), a positive modulator of SASP. Inhibitors of the nuclear factor
  (NF)-κB signalling pathway inhibit SASP. Pharmacological chaperones, inhibitors
  of Ca2+ mobilization and the osmolytic compound 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) can
  rebalance proteostasis. Several therapeutic strategies are under development to
  improve mitochondrial function, including MitoQ and small molecules such as XBJ-5-131
  that act as antioxidants and radical scavengers. Specific alterations found in the
  cells of IPF lungs suggest that activators of sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), inducers of mitophagy
  and methods to increase levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) repair enzymes might
  have beneficial therapeutic effects. Oestrogen receptor modulators such as raloxifene,
  as well as androgens, have been used to induce telomerase activity and to increase
  telomere length, although further studies are needed. HDAC, histone deacetylase;
  JAK, Janus kinase; miR-21, microRNA-21; NOX4, NADPH oxidase 4; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.
