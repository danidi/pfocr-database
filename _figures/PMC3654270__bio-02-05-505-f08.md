caption: Hedgehog signaling activated the expression of myoD and myf5, which in turn
  redundantly activates expression of cited3 and mef2c. cited3 in turn activates mef2c,
  which regulates muscle differentiation and prevents cell death. It is already known
  that myoD and myf5 activates the expression of mef2c, which could be independent
  of the contribution of cited3.
