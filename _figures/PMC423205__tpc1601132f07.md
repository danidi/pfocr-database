caption: Model of the Function of the Riboflavin Pathway in the JA Signal Transduction
  Chain.S1 and S2 represent two groups of substrates that are activated by the JA
  signals (JA) for ubiquitylation and degradation via SCFCOI1-26S proteasome (SCF/COI1).
  G1 and G2 represent different sets of JA response genes that mediate distinct JA
  responses (I and II). Arrows indicate positive regulation action; blunted lines
  indicate negative regulation; the weight of each line indicates the predicted regulation
  level. The shading, which was used to mark the putative components, indicates abundance
  of these components. RIB, riboflavin pathway.
