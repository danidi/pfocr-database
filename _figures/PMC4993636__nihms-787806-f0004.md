caption: Hippo signaling is regulated by levels of F-actin, tension within the actin
  cytoskeleton, and cell attachments. Several processes that could contribute to these
  effects have been identified, some of which are illustrated here. In Drosophila,
  these include 1) inhibition of Merlin-Wts interactions by F-actin, 2) cytoskeletal
  tension dependent recruitment of Wts into a complex with Jub at adherens junctions,
  and 3) promotion of Jub-Wts binding by Jnk phosphorylation. In mammals, these include
  1) α-catenin-mediated inhibition of Src activation by integrins, 2) activation of
  MYPT1 by ILK, 3) inhibition of Sav-Lats association through a FAK-Src-PI3K-PDK1
  pathway, 4) association of Amot with F-actin, which prevents Amot from associating
  with YAP/TAZ, 5) increases in F-actin promoted by Rho, 6) activation of YAP through
  phosphorylation of YAP by Src, and 7) promotion of LATS-LIMD1 binding by Jnk phosphorylation.
  In most cases potential conservation of these processes between Drosophila and mammals
  has not yet been investigated.
