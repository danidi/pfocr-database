caption: A model for the suppression of chromothripsis by p53. The oncogenic signals
  that arise upon activation of the canonical Hh pathway are generated by the mammalian
  ortholog of Smoothened (SMO). Active SMO triggers the upregulation of the transcription
  factor GLI1, which is itself a transcriptional target of the Hh pathway. The robust
  activation of GLI1 then disrupts the Chk1-Claspin interaction and thereby triggers
  chromosome breakage, possibly at common fragile sites. In cells that retain functional
  p53, the DNA strand breaks (DSB) generated by GLI1 trigger expression of PTCH53,
  which antagonizes SMO. Thus, p53 acts to dampen a cycle that could otherwise rapidly
  lead to extensive numbers of DNA strand breaks. Chromothripsis could arise in a
  stochastic manner if this feedback loop were to be interrupted by mutational loss
  of p53.
