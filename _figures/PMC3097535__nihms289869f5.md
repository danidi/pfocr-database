caption: Connectivity of differentially expressed genes in the important signaling
  pathway following exposure of PCB 138 in human PBMC depicting the connectivity between
  genes expressed (≥1.0, t-test, p<0.001) and the important signaling pathways in
  human PBMC in vitro following exposure of PCB 138. Geometric figures in red denote
  up-regulated genes and those are green indicate down-regulation. The network shows
  genes mainly involved in cell cycle and cell signaling. Solid interconnecting lines
  shows the genes that are directly connected and the dotted lines signify indirect
  connection between the genes and cellular functions. Canonical functions that are
  highly represented are shown within the box (AMPK Signaling, Molecular mechanism
  of Cancer, Caveloar-mediated Endocytosis, Macropinocytosis, and Colorectal cancer
  metastasis signaling). Genes in uncolored notes were not identified as differentially
  expressed in our experiment and were integrated into computational generated networks
  based on evidence stored in the IPA (Ingenuity Software) knowledge memory indicating
  relevance of this network.
