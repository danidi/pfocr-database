caption: Proposed routes for raffinose utilization in S. cerevisiae. (a) Based on
  annotation in KEGG and reactions already present in the yeast models, our initial
  implementation of the raffinose utilization pathway began with the intracellular
  cleavage of the α-galactosidic bond in raffinose (blue diamond + yellow triangle
  + brown square) by the protein product of YBR184W to produce sucrose (yellow triangle
  + brown square) and galactose (blue diamond). Subsequently, the β-fructosidic bond
  in sucrose is cleaved by SUC2, resulting in the formation of glucose (yellow triangle)
  and fructose (brown square). Finally, the glucose and fructose produced from sucrose
  hydrolysis can enter glycolysis and meet cells' metabolic needs. (b) Based on literature
  citing the lack of an α-galactosidase in the strain of S. cerevisiae studied here,
  we implemented a raffinose utilization pathway lacking the α-galactosidase reaction.
  The two different pathways for raffinose utilization were each implemented separately
  in the iLL672 model, and assessed based on the relative concordance of the phenotypic
  predictions made by the different builds, with the experimentally determined gene
  deletion phenotypes. We found an increased concordance with the iLL672 build lacking
  YBR184W, suggesting that the pathway depicted in (b) is correct.
