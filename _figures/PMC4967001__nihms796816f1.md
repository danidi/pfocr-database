caption: The Rho-RNA complex undergoes several isomerization events before reaching
  a translocation-competent state. The initial complex consists of a transient interaction
  between an RNA substrate (black) and a positively charged surface of the Rho hexamer
  (blue) []. Sequence-specific contacts (yellow asterisks) between RNA and the Rho
  primary binding site lead to the ring opening and threading of the RNA through the
  central hole of the hexamer [, ]. The RNA then establishes contacts with the secondary
  binding site of Rho, leading to ring closure []. Using the energy derived from ATP
  hydrolysis, Rho translocates in a 5′ to 3′ direction until it catches up with a
  paused RNAP []. The steps of the pathway used as regulatory checkpoints in various
  gene leaders are shown with arrows and gene names in red.
