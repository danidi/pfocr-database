caption: The proliferation/differentiation balance and sex determination in the C.
  elegans germ line. (A) A wild-type adult (one day past the fourth larval stage)
  hermaphrodite dissected gonad arm stained with DAPI (blue) to visualize nuclear
  morphology, anti-REC-8 antibodies (green) to mark mitotically cycling cells, and
  anti-HIM-3 antibodies (red) to mark meiotic cells. Distal is to the left, with mitotic
  or proliferative cells existing in the distal end of the gonad arm. Cells move proximally,
  entering meiosis in the transition zone, and eventually forming first sperm, then
  oocytes. Scale bar =20 microns. (B) A simplified genetic pathway showing genes involved
  in regulating the proliferation vs. differentiation decision in the C. elegans germ
  line. Genes that promote proliferation are shown in green, while genes that inhibit
  proliferation and/or promote meiotic entry are shown in black. lag-2, glp-1 and
  lag-2, which encode components of the core Notch signaling pathway, through a number
  of intermediates, inhibit the activities of genes in two redundant downstream pathways,
  referred to as the gld-1 and gld-2 pathways. As cells move away from the distal
  end of the gonad, the gld-1 and gld-2 pathways become active, thereby promoting
  meiotic entry (differentiation) and/or inhibiting proliferation. Adapted from ()
  (C) A simplified genetic pathway showing the genetic relationships between genes
  involved in regulating sex determination in the C. elegans germ line. Genes that
  promote the male fate are shown in blue, while genes that promote the female fate
  are shown in black. Hermaphrodites first produce sperm, and then a switch is made
  during development such that adult hermaphrodites produce oocytes. Adapted from
  ().
