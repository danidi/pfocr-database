caption: Calcium signaling pathways and their effects on the calcium responsive percentage
  of chondrocytes. A) Ten treatment groups were designed to understand the roles of
  several essential pathways in the spontaneous calcium signaling of in situ chondrocytes.
  The pathways include extracellular Ca2+ source, intracellular ER calcium store,
  purinoceptors, mechanosensitive channel, TRPV4 channel, T-type VGCC (T-VGCC) and
  L-type VGCC (L-VGCC), and intercellular gap junctions on plasma membrane. The corresponding
  antagonist of each pathway is listed in black. Length scales of the components involved
  in calcium signaling are listed at the bottom for reference. B–D) Responsive percentage
  of in situ chondrocytes, defined as the number of cells with spontaneous [Ca2+]i
  peaks divided by the total number of cells in the recorded fluorescent videos. Responsive
  percentages of the antagonist-treated samples and their corresponding controls are
  compared in each plot. Data are shown as means + sd with data points overlapped.
  ***P < 0.001.
