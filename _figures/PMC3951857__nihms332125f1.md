caption: The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Wnt binds to the Lrp5 or 6 and Frizzled
  coreceptor complex which leads to the intracellular accumulation of β-catenin. β-catenin
  translocates to the nucleus where it binds to TCF/Lef transcription factors and
  regulates the expression of a number of target genes. Mutations in several components
  of the pathway have been shown to result in disease. Mutations in LRP5 can result
  in diseases of increased or decreased bone mass and vision problems. The Lrp5 receptor
  and Wnt pathway may also play a key role in aortic valve calcification. Mutations
  in APC, β-catenin and Axin have been shown to give rise to a number of different
  types of cancer. Downstream gene targets of β-catenin such as osteoprotegerin (OPG)
  and the secreted frizzled related proteins (sFRPs) are known to regulate osteoclastogenesis
  and may play a role in metastatic bone diseases that result in osteolytic lesions.
  Mutations in modulators of Wnt signaling such as the SOST gene, which produces sclerostin,
  give rise to the increased bone mass disease, sclerosteosis. These are just a few
  examples of the variety of diseases that have been attributed to the Wnt/β-catenin
  signaling pathway.
