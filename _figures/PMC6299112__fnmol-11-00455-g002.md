caption: Overview of the canonical miRNA pathway, from synthesis to degradation. miRNA
  synthesis begins with transcription of a miRNA-encoding gene, which may lie within
  a protein coding gene or within the intergenic space, to form a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA).
  Within the nucleus, stem loop structures in the pri-miRNA are recognized by DGCR8,
  which then recruits the enzyme Drosha to cleave the pri-miRNA at the base of the
  stem loop to form a precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). The pre-miRNA is then exported
  from the nucleus through Exportin-5. In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA is recognized
  by a complex containing Dicer and either TRBP or PACT. Dicer cleaves the loop structure
  from the pre-miRNA to form a double stranded structure. One of the two strands is
  then loaded into an Ago-containing complex to form the RNA-induced silencing complex
  (RISC), and the second strand is degraded. The miRNA then acts as a guide, which
  allows the RISC to recognize mRNAs containing complementary sequences. Once the
  miRNA binds the mRNA target sequence, the protein components of the RISC, particularly
  GW182, repress the translation of the mRNA. Modifications to the 3′ end of the miRNA
  can stabilize or destabilize the miRNA. The lifecycle of the miRNA ends with digestion
  by exonucleases.
