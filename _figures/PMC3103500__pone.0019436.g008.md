caption: There are certain proteins which function as transcription factor and on
  activation (by stress or infection) move into the nucleus. Nuclear localization
  of such proteins further regulates the genes that play a role in apoptosis and cell
  cycle progression. We propose that NES of 9b may remain unexposed until it binds
  to the nuclear proteins (represented as ‘nuclear protein’ = ‘X’). Our preliminary
  data shows that 9b binds with the nuclear proteins (). This interaction may be exposing
  NES of 9b leading to the export of ‘X’ proteins along with 9b using Crm1 dependent
  pathway. This event may stop host cell response against stress caused by the viral
  infection.
