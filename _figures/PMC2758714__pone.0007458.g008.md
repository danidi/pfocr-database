caption: Silica-regulated genes revealed by microarray assay were represented together
  with the enzymatic reactions they catalyze and within associated metabolic pathways.
  Protein ID, annotation and induction fold are indicated within colored boxes. Differentially
  regulated genes were highlighted in green or in red for genes upregulated in the
  presence or absence of silicic acid, respectively. N-X represent a glutamine amidotransferase
  (class II) substrate where N is a transferred ammonia from carbon-nitrogen group.
  This reaction may be involved in biosynthesis of purine, glucosamine 6-phosphate
  or asparagine. Genes involved in carbon metabolism are present, especially within
  glycolysis (p41423 and p54920). Another group of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism
  (KEGG ref 00910) are also represented such as enzymes involved in glutamate pathway
  (p47298, p51920, p22357; KEGG ref 00251) and metabolism of amino groups (p55010,
  p25521; KEGG ref 00220). Interestingly glutamate and aspartate are precursors of
  ornithine and methionine, that are involved in polyamine biosynthesis, where AdoHcyase
  (p25521) and Choline dehydrogenase (p43604) are involved.
