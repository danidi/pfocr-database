caption: Wg secreted from presynaptic motor neuron endings, binds to Fz-2 and co-receptor
  Arrow, which are localized presynaptically and postsynaptically. In the presynaptic
  cell, Wg activates a Divergent Canonical Wnt Pathway, involving Dvl activation,
  inhibition of GSK-3β activity and the regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton
  through Futsch. In the postsynaptic cell, Wg activates the Frizzled Nuclear Import
  Pathway, which involves the cleavage and nuclear import of Fz-2. GRIP is required
  for the trafficking of receptors from the postsynaptic membrane towards the nucleus.
  WNT5 is also released from the presynaptic boutons and binds to its receptor Derailed
  (DRL) on the postsynaptic membrane to regulate synaptic bouton growth.
