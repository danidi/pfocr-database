caption: Comparison of intracellular signaling in myDC and moDC after TLR stimulation
  and effect of blockade of MAPK pathways in healthy donors. (a) MAPK/Rsk/GSK3β signaling.
  (i) Activation of Rsk by both ERK and p38 following TLR ligation in murine splenic
  and bone-marrow derived DC (arrow = activation), (ii) Signaling downstream of ERK
  and p38 in all other cells after TLR ligation where Rsk is only activated by ERK,
  (iii) Rsk drives GSK3β from the active form (GSK3β*) to the inactive form (GSK3β)
  with downstream effects on IL-12p70/IL-10 secretion, (iv) Sequence of phosphorylation/activation
  of Rsk by phospho-ERK (p-ERK) and phospho-p38 (p-p38). (b) Timecourse of MK2 activation
  following TLR stimulation in myDC and moDC. Donor-matched myDC and moDC (105) were
  stimulated with poly I:C/R848 for the indicated times before Western blotting. To
  allow cell-for-cell comparison between myDC and moDC, entire samples were used in
  a single Western blot and probed for phospho-MK2 (p-MK2) with β-actin as a loading
  control. Infrared secondary antibodies were used to allow for semi-quantitative
  analysis normalized to loading control. (i) Scanned images for one donor of two.
  (ii) Normalized p-MK2 for two donors, open circles = myDC, filled circles = moDC,
  dotted line = upper p-MK2 band, solid line = lower p-MK2 band. (c) Effect of blockade
  of p38 or MEK on MK2 activation following TLR stimulation in moDC. MoDC were pre-treated
  with p38 inhibitors SB203580 10 µM (S), BIRB0796 (B) 0.1 or 1.0 µM or MEK inhibitor
  UO126 10 µM (U) for 1hr followed by poly I:C/R848 stimulation for 30 min then Western
  blotted for p-MK2 with β-actin loading control as in (b). Shown are scanned images
  for three independent donors and graphs of normalized p-MK2 (gray bars = upper p-MK2
  band, black bars = lower p-MK2 band). (d) Effect of blockade of p38, MEK or both
  on ERK, p38 and Rsk activation in moDC. MoDC were treated and analyzed as in (c)
  for phospho-ERK 1/2 (p-ERK 1/2), phospho-p38 (p-p38), phospho-Rsk (p-Rsk, T359/S363,
  T573 and S380 residues) with total Rsk as loading control. Pre-treatment was with
  p38 inhibitor BIRB0796 1.0 µM (B), MEK inhibitor UO126 10 µM (U) or both (BU). Shown
  are scanned images for three independent donors and graphs of normalised p-RskSer380
  for each donor. (e) Effect of blockade of p38, MEK or both on activation of MK2
  and Rsk at Ser380 in myDC. MyDC (three donors) were treated, harvested and analyzed
  as in (c) for p-MK2 and p-RskS380 with β-actin as loading control. Pre-treatment
  was with p38 inhibitor BIRB0796 1.0µM (B), MEK inhibitor UO126 10µM (U) or both
  (BU).
