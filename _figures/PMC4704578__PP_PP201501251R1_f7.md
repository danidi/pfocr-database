caption: Schematic diagram of how the ERF1 transcription factor might act through
  the GA biosynthetic pathway to promote germination in  and  seeds during high-temperature
  imbibition, as denoted by the dashed arrow. The LsERF1 transcription factor may
  activate the transcription of LsGA3ox1 to elevate the biosynthesis of active GA
  and alter the hormonal ratio of GA and . The presence of GA subsequently promotes
  the expression of CWRE-associated genes such as LsMAN1 to induce endosperm weakening
  for radicle protrusion. Not all biochemical steps are shown. Solid lines indicate
  interactions that have been demonstrated in prior studies. ABA8′ox, -8′-hydroxylase;
  KO, ent-kaurene oxidase; PDS, phytoene desaturase; SAM, S-adenosyl-Met.
