caption: Model for TRAP1 ATPase cycle showing the normal sequential two-step ATP hydrolysis
  mechanism observed with magnesium (solid blue arrows and text) and an alternative
  path (dashed green arrow and text) when using calcium. The open dimer binds 2 ATPs,
  which in turn stabilizes an asymmetric closed state. Calcium binding at least partially
  bypasses the magnesium-supported pathway for stepwise hydrolysis, resulting in cooperative
  ATPase activity that consequently skips the conformational switch that happens after
  the first ATP hydrolysis.
