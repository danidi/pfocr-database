caption: Ab initiates a disease process that might progress to a stage of cognitive
  impairment, but tau mediates cognitive dysfunction. In this hypothetical scheme,
  Aβ*56 (see Section 4.1) and perhaps other Aβ oligomers, cause synaptic dysfunction
  that manifests as subtle cognitive deficits in APP transgenic mice and in people
  in the asymptomatic phase of AD. Toxic Aβ oligomers surrounding plaques locally
  damage neurons, but their effects on cognition are unknown (see Section 4.2). Abnormal
  tau processing triggered by pathological forms of Aβ in AD, and by mutations in
  tau transgenic mice, cause loss of synapses and neurons and cognitive deficits severe
  enough to warrant a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or AD. The effects
  of NFTs, rather than soluble pathological forms of tau, are unknown (see Section
  4.4). It is also not known whether the same effector molecules/mechanisms responsible
  for Aβ-induced synaptic and cognitive dysfunction trigger tau abnormalities or whether
  a separate pathway is involved.
