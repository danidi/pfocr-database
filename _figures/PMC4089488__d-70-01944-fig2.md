caption: Overall structures of the SARAH dimers. Structures of the MST1–RASSF5 SARAH
  heterodimer (a, d), the MST2 SARAH homodimer (b, e) and the MST1 SARAH homodimer
  (c, f) are shown as ribbon diagrams and surface representations, respectively. For
  ease of comparison, the orientations shown in all panels are identical. For the
  MST1–RASSF5 SARAH heterodimer (a, d), the blue ribbon represents the backbone structure
  of the MST1 SARAH domain and the pink ribbon represents that of the RASSF5 SARAH
  domain. (g) Comparison of the monomer structures of the MST1 SARAH domain in the
  homodimer (light green) and in the heterodimer (blue). Note that the short h1 helix
  of the MST1 SARAH domain is missing and the length of the MST1 h2 helix is extended
  in the MST1–RASSF5 heterodimer.
