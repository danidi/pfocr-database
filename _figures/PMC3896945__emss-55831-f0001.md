caption: Pharmacological approaches for targeting mitochondrial biogenesis. a | Upstream
  sensors of energy status. Energy stress promotes the activation of AMP-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) via an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, whereas energy excess
  activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway either via an increase
  in levels of amino acids or via the activation of insulin signalling. Rapamycin,
  5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) and resveratrol (RSV) simulate energy
  crisis by inhibiting mTOR or activating AMPK. AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of co-factors
  (such as PPARγ co-activator 1α (PGC1α)) and transcription factors (such as forkhead
  box O (FOXO) proteins) is a preliminary step required for their activation. AMPK
  also increases levels of NAD+, which is a substrate for sirtuins. NAD+ levels can
  be increased either by supplying precursors or by inhibiting NAD+-consuming enzymes
  such as CD38 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). The increase in NAD+ levels
  activates sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which subsequently deacetylates PGC1α and FOXO. The
  acetylation status of PGC1α is counterbalanced by the activity of the histone acetyltransferase
  GCN5, which is activated by feeding and via the recruitment of steroid receptor
  co-activator protein 3 (SRC3). Sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) can also activate
  SIRT1 directly. b | Downstream transcriptional factors and co-factors. The balance
  between the activity of co-repressors and co-activators determines the activation
  of transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Nuclear receptors
  such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are ideal drug targets
  as they are activated upon ligand binding. Likewise, agonist ligands for retinoid
  X receptor-α (RXRα), the heterodimerization partner of the PPARs, enhance mitochondrial
  function. Also, several compounds can induce the transcriptional activity of the
  oestrogen-related receptors (ERRs). The only approach described to modulate the
  activity of the transcription factor nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) was a microRNA
  (miRNA)-based approach. Finally, a recombinant form of human mitochondrial transcription
  factor A (TFAM) was designed to stimulate the processing of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).
