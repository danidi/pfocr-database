caption: Role, regulation and inhibitors of enzyme GlmS in Escherichia coli. (A) Key
  role of enzyme GlmS in the hexosamine pathway and its inhibition by antibiotics.
  GlmS catalyzes synthesis of GlcN6P from fructose-6-phosphate and glutamine. When
  available, amino sugars such as GlcN can be taken up and converted to GlcN6P bypassing
  the need for GlmS. GlcN6P is further converted by enzymes GlmM and GlmU to UDP-GlcNAc,
  which is the last common precursor for synthesis of peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides
  (LPS). The dipeptide antibiotics Nva-FMDP and bacilysin require peptide transporters
  such as Dpp for uptake. Intracellular hydrolysis releases the active C-terminal
  moieties FMDP and anticapsin, which inhibit GlmS through covalent binding to a residue
  in the glutamine binding pocket. (B) Structures of the dipeptide antibiotics bacilysin
  and Nva-FMDP. (C) Feedback regulation of GlmS synthesis by small RNAs GlmY and GlmZ
  and adapter protein RapZ in E. coli (, ). GlmZ base-pairs with the glmS 5′-UTR enhancing
  translation and stabilizing the transcript. Alternatively, GlmZ is bound by adapter
  protein RapZ and recruited to cleavage by RNase E. The decision on the fate of GlmZ
  is made by the homologous decoy sRNA GlmY. Upon GlcN6P scarcity, GlmY accumulates
  and sequesters RapZ thereby counteracting cleavage of GlmZ by RNase E.
