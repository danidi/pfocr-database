caption: Cisplatin response pathway. RGD's interactive pathway diagrams give a detailed
  and intricate view of a growing list of regulatory, signaling, metabolic, disease
  and drug pathways. The page begins with an overview of what is known about that
  pathway (not shown in this figure), and a diagram showing the various players and
  their interactions and relationships in the functioning of the pathway. Disease
  pathways and altered pathways show the details of what can go wrong with a specific
  interaction to cause a breakdown in the function of the network. Pathway pages also
  give information about the other pathways, diseases and phenotypes with which the
  members of a particular pathway are associated.
