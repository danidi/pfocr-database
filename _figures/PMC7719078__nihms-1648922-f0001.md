caption: a, The NTV is composed of a polymer-peptide conjugate-based NT loaded with
  AP. The NTV has a spherical morphology with a diameter of about 100 nm at pH 7.4.
  b, After the NTV is internalized by DCs, the acidic endosomal environment (pH 5.6)
  will trigger fast cleavage of the PDP peptide, which will then re-assemble into
  nanosheets with sizes in the range 5–8 μm. The morphological change leads to disruption
  of the endosomal membrane and delivery of AP into the cytosol. Moreover, the cytoplasmic
  nanosheets activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, which promotes DC maturation
  and antigen processing. These two features contribute to the enhanced cross-presentation
  of AP to CD8+ T-cells and efficient antitumour immunity. PDP, pyrene-conjugated
  D-peptide; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor, pyrin-domain-containing 3.
