caption: 'Modes of Hh pathway signaling. (A) Type I Hh signaling is activated by specific
  mutations within pathway genes within tumor cells, resulting in ligand-independent
  constitutive activation. (B) Type II Hh signaling results from autocrine signaling
  from tumor cell to tumor cell. (C) Type IIIa activation results from secretion of
  Hh ligand by tumor cells, resulting in pathway activation in surrounding tumor stroma.
  (D) Type IIIb Hh signaling results from Hh ligand secretion by tumor stroma, resulting
  in activation of the pathway within tumor cells themselves.Abbreviation: Hh, Hedgehog.'
