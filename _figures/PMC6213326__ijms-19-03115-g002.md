caption: 'Model of cellular and subcellular auxin homeostasis and signaling in Arabidopsis.
  IAA biosynthesis (indicated by dark blue arrows) could be mediated by l-tryptophan
  (l-Trp)-dependent or independent biosynthetic pathways []. Tryptophan as a substrate
  for the synthesis of IAA is synthesized in stroma of chloroplast []. There are already
  four described biosynthetic pathways named according to their first intermediates
  (in dark blue rectangles []). In Arabidopsis, IAA biosynthesis is running predominantly
  via the indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPyA) pathway including: cytoplasmic TRYPTOPHAN AMIDOTRANSFERASE
  OF ARABIDOPSIS (TAA1), TAA-Related (TAR1) localized on plasma membrane (PM), and
  YUCCA4 attached to the ER membrane [,]. Free IAA levels can be modulated via conjugation
  and/or oxidation, rarely via methylation (metabolic pathways are represented by
  yellow arrows [,]. Four main families of active auxin transporters are described:
  PM localized AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) auxin influx facilitators, and perhaps
  also into the ER []; PINs efflux carriers [,]; ATP-binding cassette type B (ABCB)
  proteins [] involved in the influx or efflux of auxin [,]; and finally PIN-like
  (PILS) together with short PIN-FORMED proteins (PINs) (PIN5, 6, and 8) with confirmed
  localization at ER []. WALLS ARE THIN 1 (WAT1) is a recently described tonoplast-localized
  auxin transporter []. Similarly, NPF6.3 (NRT1.1) can control auxin influx (transport
  is marked by white arrows [,]. Nuclear TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE1/AUXIN SIGNALING
  F-BOX proteins (TIR1/AFBs) are considered as proven auxin receptors. However, the
  strong proof that putative AUXIN BINDING PROTEIN 1 (ABP1) and S-PHASE KINASE-ASSOCIATED
  PROTEIN 2A (SKP2A) receptors directly mediate auxin signaling still remains contentious

  trafficking. Solid arrows indicate known and well-described pathways, dashed arrows
