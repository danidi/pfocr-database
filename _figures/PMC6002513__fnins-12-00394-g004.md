caption: Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway. Decreased activity of AMPK
  will lead to abnormalities in mitochondrial synthesis and normal functions, such
  as oxidative respiration, as well as alterations of autophagy, which render cells
  unable to handle changes in the microenvironment. Decreased activity of AMPK will
  also cause less degradation of Aβ and more phosphorylation of tau. LKB1 and CaMKKβ
  are required for the activation of AMPK and are important for the stability of stereocilia
  in hair cells and protection of auditory cortex neurons, respectively. Although
  there is currently no evidence showing that LKB1 and CaMKKβ change in the ear or
  brain due to aging, the environment, diet or other factors, we speculate that if
  expression of LKB 1 and CaMKKβ is altered by the above factors, they would not only
  cause hearing loss but also affect downstream phosphorylation of AMPK, leading to
  AD. However, the activation of AMPK may exert a dual influence, which may have an
  opposite effect on cell death and survival.
