caption: 'Mutagenesis caused by 8-oxoguanine and mammalian defense systems. In the
  mutagenesis pathway, 8-oxoguanine (GO) accumulates in DNA, via the incorporation
  of 8-oxo-dGTP from the nucleotide pool or because of direct oxidation of DNA. This
  increases the occurrence of A:T to C:G or G:C to T:A transversion mutations after
  two rounds of replication. Red line: mutagenic pathway. In the defense systems,
  MTH1 hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP and pyrophosphate. 8-oxo-dGMP is further
  converted to nucleoside, 8-oxodeozyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), thus avoiding their incorporation
  into DNA. 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase (OGG1) removes 8-oxoG to initiate base excision
  repair (BER). OGG1 preferentially excises 8-oxoG opposite cytosine. MutY homolog
  (MUTYH) excises the adenine inserted opposite 8-oxoG in the template strand. Once
  cytosine is inserted opposite 8-oxoG during the BER initiated by MUTYH, OGG1 can
  remove the 8-oxoG residue opposite cytosine. However, adenine can be reinserted
  opposite 8-oxoG during BER (dashed red line). In mammals, the mismatch repair machinery
  recognizes 8-oxoG opposite adenine in template DNA and excises the 8-oxoG containing
  nascent strand (green line). OGG1 may enhance A to C transversion if it excises
  8-oxoG opposite cytosine that had been inserted opposite 8-oxoG paired with the
  adenine in the template DNA (dashed blue line). Blue lines: BER pathways. Modified
  from Ref. [].'
