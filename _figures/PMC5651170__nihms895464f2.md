caption: Proper tuning of TCR activation is critical for the functional regulation
  of helper T-cells, including cytokine production, lymphocyte differentiation, clonal
  expansion, and cytotoxic effector functions. The biochemical signal initiated by
  TCR triggering is dynamically regulated by protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases.
  Fine molecular coordination is required to maintain the feedback loop necessary
  to avoid lymphocyte hyper-reactivity and the breaking of immune tolerance. ACS patients
  have excessive amplification of proximal TCR-mediated signals and unbalanced downstream
  molecular phosphorylation. CREB = cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding
  protein; LCK= lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase; MAPK= mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; PTPN22 = protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22; STAT
  = signal transducer and activator of transcription; TCR = T-cell receptor; Zap70
  = zeta-chain-associated protein kinase of 70 kD. Other abbreviations as in .
