caption: Interactions between the SA and the JA/ET pathways. ET can synergistically
  induce PR1 via an unknown mechanism. SA and JA/ET are mostly antagonistic to each
  other. On the left-hand (SA) side, the cytosolic localization of NPR1 is sufficient
  for the suppression of the JA/ET response. Some components that are regulated by
  NPR1, such as WRKY62, TGAs, and glutaredoxin 480 (GRX480), can confer the suppression
  on the JA response. Some WRKYs such as WRKY50, WRKY51, and WRKY70, can suppress
  the JA response independent from NPR1. The suppression of the JA pathway by the
  SA pathway is downstream of JA synthesis, having no influence on JAZs accumulation;
  however, it results in the degradation of ORA59. On the right-hand (JA) side, JA
  can suppress the SA response by inducing ANACs, which are regulated by MYC2. ANACs
  can inhibit isochorismate synthase 1 (ICS1); however, they can enhance the basal
  transcript level of the SA methyl transferase 1 (BSMT1) and UDP-glucosyltransferase
  74F2 (UGT74F2) to elevate SA accumulation. Furthermore, EIN3 and EIL1 can suppress
  ICS1 activity by directly binding to the promoter of ICS1. Activation (closed arrowhead),
  suppression (⊥), and important genes are indicated.
