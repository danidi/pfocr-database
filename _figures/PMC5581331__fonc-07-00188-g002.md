caption: The p53 and pRB pathways during senescence. Cellular senescence is triggered
  by the activation of one of two major tumor suppressive pathways, namely the p53
  or the pRB pathway. Although the details may vary, activation of these pathways
  is marked by the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), the key enzymes
  involved in cell cycle progression. For example, stabilization of the transcription
  factor p53 in response to DNA damage (which is dependent on p19/ARF-mediated inhibition
  of MDM2, an E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets p53 for degradation) is followed by
  the p53-dependent transcription of genes involved in the orchestration of cellular
  senescence. One of these target genes, p21Cip1/WAF1, is a potent inhibitor of cyclin/CDK
  complexes, particularly cyclin E/CDK2 complexes. Similarly, p16INK4a, another inhibitor
  of CDKs that highly expressed in some senescent cells, inhibits cyclin D1/CDK4/6
  complexes. The upregulation of both types of CDK inhibitors results in the inhibition
  of CDKs and the subsequent activation of the pRB pathway, which effectively blocks
  the G1-S cell cycle transition.
