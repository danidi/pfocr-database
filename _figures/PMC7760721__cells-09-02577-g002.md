caption: Aβ peptides are derived from the processing of the βAPP (APP) through the
  amyloidogenic pathway. APP is first cleaved by β–secretase (β), generating APP C-terminal
  fragment β (CTF-β), which is then cleaved by γ–secretase complex (γ) to produce
  Aβ and APP intracellular domain (AICD). At the plasma membrane, Aβ form a cation
  channel and modulate several Ca2+ channels (VGCC, AMPAR, NMDAR and CALHM1). ER Ca2+
  deregulation occurs through presenilin (PS)-associated Ca2+ leak and/or enhanced
  IP3R- and RyR-mediated Ca2+ release, dysfunctional Sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+
  ATPase (SERCA) activity, enhanced expression of S1T driven by ER stress response
  and enhanced expression and dysfunctional IP3Rs and RyRs. SOCE is also deregulated
  in AD and implicates STIM, ORAI and TRPC. RyR2 macromolecular complex destabilization
  (PKA phosphorylation and calstabin2 (Cal2) dissociation) is linked to β2-adrenergic
  receptor activation. Pharmacological stabilization of ER Ca2+ content by S107, Dantrolene
  (Dant) blocking RyRs-mediated Ca2+ release/leak, Xestospongin C (XeC) blocking IP3R-mediated
  Ca2+ release and CD1163 (CD) activating SERCA provided beneficial effects in reversing
  several AD-related pathogenic paradigms in vitro and in vivo.
