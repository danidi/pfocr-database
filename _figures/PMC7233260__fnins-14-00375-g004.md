caption: Cellular and signaling pathway view of diurnal gene expression changes. The
  center panel shows the genes measured in a layout matching that of  in order to
  depict the gene expression according to the cellular and signaling pathways of interest.
  Average −ΔΔCT values for each gene are used to colorize the subpanels using the
  color scale shown. The three columns show the three diurnal time points (ZT3, ZT5,
  and ZT9). The top row shows data from the DVC while the bottom row shows data from
  the CeA. By definition, the average −ΔΔCT value of each gene at ZT5 is zero, and
  therefore the two brain regions share a common center panel.
