caption: 'Intercellular and intracellular signals that initiate liver regeneration.
  Three mechanisms lead to hepatocyte proliferation. In response to complement factors
  C3a, C5a, PAMPs, and DAMPs, Kupffer cells release TNF-α, IL-6, PGE2, and IL-1β.
  TNF-α induces an autocrine loop through NF-κB production by B-cells. IL-6, PGE2,
  and IL-1β bind their cognate receptors on hepatocytes (A). Platelets accumulate
  in the space of Disse and release an armament of growth factors, including HGF,
  from their α-granules. Pro-HGF is released from SECs and HSCs and is converted to
  HGF by uPA, which is activated as a result of ECM damage after PHx. Platelets also
  release serotonin, which stimulates SECs, and sphringosine-1-phosphate to stimulate
  IL-6 release (B). PGE2 and IL-1β coming from Kupffer cells stimulate amphiregulin
  production in hepatocytes. HGF binds its receptor c-Met and activates hepatocyte
  proliferation through ERK-1/2 MAPK. IL-6 binds the IL-6 receptor and activates JAK,
  which induces hepatocyte proliferation through STAT3 and through the RAS-ERK-1/2
  MAPK pathway. EGF, TGF-α, HBEGF, and amphiregulin enhance the effect of HGF through
  EGFR2. EGF is produced in the duodenum and reaches the liver through the portal
  circulation. TGF-α is produced by proliferating hepatocytes. HBEGF is released from
  monocytes and macrophages and converted to its active form by metalloproteinases.
  TNF-α (from Kupffer cells) and ROS enhance the UPR that is mediated by IRE1α. The
  UPR inhibits ER stress that in turn activates COX-2 expression. COX-2 is also stimulated
  by ROS, PAMPs, and DAMPs. Enhanced COX-2 expression increases C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ
  expression and decreases C/EBPα expression, thereby stimulating hepatocyte proliferation
  (C). Abbreviations: DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; PAMPs, pathogen-associated
