caption: Proposed pathway for the assimilation of C1 compounds by isocitrate lyase-negative
  type II methylotrophs by using the serine cycle for formaldehyde fixation. The ethylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway described here (excluding the condensation of acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate)
  is integrated in the serine cycle (upper part) and is involved in assimilation of
  acetyl-CoA and regeneration of glyoxylate during growth on C1 compounds. It is assumed
  that during growth on C2 compounds the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway () is used exclusively.
  Dotted lines indicate more than one reaction step.
