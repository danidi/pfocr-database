caption: The retrograde signaling pathway. A signal from dysfunctional mitochondria
  is transduced by Rtg2 to the heterodimeric transcription factor Rtg1–Rtg3. The phosphatase
  activity of Rtg2 may partially dephosphorylate Rtg3, facilitating the translocation
  of Rtg1–Rtg3 into the nucleus, where it induces the expression of a wide array of
  retrograde response target genes. The retrograde transcription factor is aided in
  this gene induction by the transcriptional co-activator complex SLIK (SAGA-like),
  which contains Rtg2 as an integral component. The translocation of Rtg1–Rtg3 into
  the nucleus is inhibited by Mks1, which in a complex with the 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1/2
  promotes hyperphosphorylation of Rtg3. Rtg2 can prevent this by sequestering Mks1.
  Mks1 is degraded by a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism, involving the ubiquitin ligase
  Grr1. The nutrient-sensing TORC1, one subunit of which is the WD-protein Lst8 a
  know retrograde response regulator, inhibits retrograde signaling both upstream
  and downstream of Rtg2. It negatively regulates Rtg2 and positively regulates Mks1.
