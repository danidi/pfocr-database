caption: Iron homeostasis and signaling pathways involved in hepcidin regulation.
  (A) Iron transported in the circulation (3 mg) is mostly used for hemoglobin (Hb)
  synthesis to support de novo red blood cell (RBC) production. Iron is absorbed daily
  in small amount by duodenal enterocytes (1–2 mg) to replace ordinary iron losses.
  Iron supply to the bone marrow is mostly maintained by iron recycling in reticulo-endothelial
  macrophages (20–25 mg), which engulf senescent RBCs and release iron back into circulation.
  The liver serves as major iron storage tissue (1 g), where iron accumulates in ferritins
  in a non-toxic form. Due to the lack of active iron excretion systems, iron absorption
  and recycling are tightly regulated to maintain iron homeostasis. Hepcidin orchestrates
  systemic iron fluxes through the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN) by binding it on
  the surface of iron-releasing cells (macrophages and enterocytes), inducing its
  degradation and blocking systemic iron release. (B) Hepcidin production in the liver
  is regulated by multiple and opposing signals. Elevated iron stores and inflammation
  induce hepcidin in order to prevent iron overload and deprive microrganisms of growth-essential
  iron, respectively. Whereas BMP2 is more involved in steady-state hepcidin expression,
  BMP6 production is induced by increased iron levels and triggers hepcidin transcription
  via the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) / sma and mothers against decapentaplegic
  homologue (SMAD) pathway. High concentrations of diferric transferrin (Tf-Fe2) displace
  HFE from transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1), which then forms a complex with transferrin
  receptor 2 (TFR2) and hemojuvelin (HJV) to promote BMP/SMAD signaling. HJV contributes
  to the BMP/SMAD signaling acting as BMP co-receptor and is negatively regulated
  by Matriptase 2 (TMPRSS6)-mediated cleavage. Under inflammatory conditions, interleukin
  6 (IL-6) induces hepcidin mRNA via the Jak/signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) pathway. Increased erythropoietic demand and hypoxia suppress hepcidin production,
  enabling iron supply for erythropoiesis. Hypoxia induces the renal production of
  erythropoietin (EPO) which is responsible for erythropoiesis stimulation. Increased
  EPO induces the synthesis of erythroferrone (ERFE) and growth differentiation factor
  11(GDF11) by erythroid precursors, resulting in hepcidin suppression. In hepatocytes
  ERFE and GDF11 interferes with the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway by sequestering BMP6,
  and by enhancing SMAD ubiquitin regulatory factor 1 (SMURF1) expression, respectively.
  Other erythropoietic regulators such as growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15)
  and twisted gastrulation factor 1 (TWSG1), have been implicated in hepcidin regulation,
  though not so definitely. To some extent hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) might be
  directly implicated in hepcidin downregulation. BMPR-I = Bone Morphogenic Protein
  Receptor Type 1; BMPR-II = Bone Morphogenic Protein Receptor Type 2; IL6-R = Interleukin-6
  Receptor.
