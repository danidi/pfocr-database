caption: Schematic of the hedgehog signaling pathway. Patched (Ptch) inhibits smoothened
  under physiologic conditions (left). Hedgehog (Hh) binding to ptch dissociates Ptch
  from smoothened, thereby activating smoothened (Smo), allowing for Gli activation
  and transcription of target genes (middle). Mutant ptch does not bind and repress
  Smoothened; this leads to persistent activation of Gli transcription factors (right).
  Arrows represent activation and T-bars represent inhibitory correlation.
