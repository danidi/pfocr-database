caption: Schematic model of the inhibition of PRRSV by LPS. According to our data,
  LPS stimulation leads to the activation of TLR4 and NF-κB signaling, which facilitates
  the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines and potentiates proinflammatory response.
  These proinflammatory factors activate ADAM17 to cleave CD163, resulting in the
  shedding of membrane CD163, which ultimately leads to the inhibition of PRRSV.
