caption: 'Predicted FA and TAG biosynthetic pathways in perilla seeds. Numbers after
  the genes (#W) indicate the highest WAF of its expression in developing seeds. Inside
  of bright green rectangle presents FA biosynthesis and fatty acid export from plastid.
  Inside of bright red rectangle presents glycerolipids biosynthesis for TAG formation
  in ER. Yellow circle indicate TAG in oil body. WRI1 transcription factor regulates
  ɑ-PDH, BCCP, MCMT, KASIII and EAR genes in FA biosynthesis. Red rectangles inside
  of ER represent acyl-CoA pools and reaction of desaturation by FAD2 and FAD3 in
  PC, respectively. Acyl-CoA dependent Kennedy pathway is indicated with red arrow.
