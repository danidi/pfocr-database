caption: Contribution of nSOCE components and Ca2+signaling pathways to the dysregulation
  of MSN spines in HD. (A) In wildtypes, MSN synaptic spine stability is maintained
  by the nSOCE pathway. nSOCE is gated by STIM2, which regulates ER Ca2+ levels by
  activating SOC channels in the plasma membrane, and SERCA pumps Ca2+ from the cytosol
  to the ER to refill ER Ca2+ stores. Ca2+ is released from the ER to the cytosol
  by IP3R1 and RyRs, and S1R facilitates Ca2+ flux from the ER to mitochondria via
  IP3R3. (B) In HD MSNs, supranormal synaptic nSOCE causes spine loss. mHTT sensitizes
  IP3R1 to IP3, causing excessive Ca2+ leakage from the ER. Ca2+ release from the
  ER is exaggerated by RyRs that are activated by abnormal Ca2+ release via IP3R1.
  Upon activation, S1Rs redistribute to the entire ER network where they interact
  with additional targets, including IP3R1, to affect their function. STIM2 upregulation
  compensates for the abnormal depletion of Ca2+ from the ER and causes the aberrant
  activation of nSOCE. Finally, supranormal nSOCE activates pathways and effectors
  that destabilize spines and lead to their loss in HD MSNs. Black arrows represent
  Ca2+ flux. The thick red arrows represent an increase or decrease in Ca2+ concentration.
