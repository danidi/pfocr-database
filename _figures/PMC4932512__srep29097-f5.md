caption: The TRiC/CCT complex reduces the formation of polyQ protein aggregates. VRK2
  affects TRiC protein degradation by regulating the stability of CCT4 subunits. We
  found that GSK3β interacted with VRK2 and inhibited VRK2 catalytic activity, which
  reduced HttQ103 aggregation through increased CCT4 stability.
