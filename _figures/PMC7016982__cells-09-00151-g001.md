caption: The regulation of YAP at the level of the extracellular matrix involves various
  proteins involved in stabilizing and activating YAP. Integrins sense the external
  forces and transmit this signal to talin family members which allow YAP and accessory
  proteins to act as mechanosensors within the cell.
