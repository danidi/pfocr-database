caption: Mechanism of EC barrier auto-recovery after thrombin challenge. In parallel
  with rapid activation of the Rho pathway leading to increased EC permeability, thrombin
  causes activation of Src kinase, which stimulates the Rap1-specific GEF C3G and,
  via Rap1-Tiam1, turns on the Rac1 signaling. Activation of the Rap1–Rac1 signaling
  axis downregulates the Rho pathway of barrier disruption and promotes reassembly
  of AJ complexes and endothelial monolayer barrier restoration.
