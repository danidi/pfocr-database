caption: 'Schematic representation of major functions, interrelationships among thiol
  and non-thiol compounds, and their coordination with other defense system components
  in metal(loid)-exposed plants. As discussed in the text, plant responses to heavy
  metals include: (A) metal ion binding to the cell wall and root exudates; (B) reduction
  of metal influx across the plasma membrane; (C) membrane efflux pumping into the
  apoplast (ATP-binding-cassette (ABC) and P1B-ATPase transporter); (D) heavy metal
  (HM) chelation in the cytosol by ligands such as phytochelatins (PC), metallothioneins
  (MT), organic acids, and amino acids; (E) ROS defense mechanism [Antioxidant enzymes
  (SOD: superoxide dismutase, CAT: catalase, APX: ascorbate peroxidase, GPX: glutathione
  peroxidase, GSH: glutathione reduce and GSSG: glutathione oxidase)]; (F) hormone
  signaling pathway. (G) Transport and compartmentalization in the vacuole (ABC and
  P1B-ATPase transporter, NRAMP: natural resistance associated macrophage protein,
  CAX: cation/proton exchanger). Metal ions are shown as black dots.'
