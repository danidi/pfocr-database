caption: 'Murine in vivo observations of chitin immune-stimulating effects: The experimental
  approaches have generally been based on delivering chitin particles in liquid suspensions
  by one of the following routes: (i) intranasal or intratracheal delivery followed
  by broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL) analysis and histological examinations of lung
  tissue, (ii) IP injection followed by analysis of peritoneal lavage cell composition
  or (iii) gastrointestinal delivery by oral gavage followed by histological examination
  of mucosal barrier integrity and inflammation. In the lung, recent studies established
  a profound impact of epithelial derived signals, which hitherto have not been studied
  in other tissues. Repeated delivery with large chitin particles (LCPs) well above
  phagocytosable size induced IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, which, via innate ILC2, induced
  type 2 innate immune responses characterized by tissue eosinophilia and alternative
  macrophage activation (M2). At the same time, ILC2s exerted an inhibiting effect
  on type 1 responses which would otherwise be driven by IL-17A released from γδ T
  cells (). Airway epithelial cells, upon binding of CMP, release CCL2 which further
  drive M2 (), and CMP was observed to induce the production of IL-10 in BAL macrophages
  (). Single exposure to LCPs leads to an IL-17A driven type 1 immune response which
  is strongly dependent on TLR-2. It is not known which cells are responsible for
  perceiving the chitin particles (, ). In the peritoneum single exposure to CMP leads
  to phagocytosis-dependent proinflammatory signaling characterized by induction of
  TNF-α and inducible nitric oxide synthase while downregulating IL-10 expression.
  LCP induces tissue eosinophilia and M2 characterized by arginase 1 induction by
  a signaling pathway affected by CHTR2 (). The possible signaling influence from

  colitis models, CMPs stimulated the accumulation of IL-10 producing cells, presumably
  alternatively activated macrophages, both at inflamed and non-inflamed sites. They
