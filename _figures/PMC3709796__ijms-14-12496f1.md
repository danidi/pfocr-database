caption: 'The androgen signaling pathway. The androgen receptor (AR) domains are labeled
  as: N—N-terminal domain (NTD); D—DNA binding (DBD); L—ligand binding domain (LBD).
  Locally produced dihydrotestosterone (DHT) interacts with the androgen receptor
  to facilitate release of heat shock proteins (HSP), N/C dimerization and exposure
  of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) required for interaction with importin-α
  and nuclear translocation. Inside the nucleus, the AR exists in equilibrium between
  monomers and dimers. Although it is unclear which form(s) are required for DNA binding,
  the AR exists as a dimer when bound to androgen response elements (AREs). DNA binding
  causes the N/C interactions to be lost, allowing the recruitment of transcription
  initiation and bridging factors, such as CREB binding protein (CBP), the transcription
  activator p300 and the AR-associated protein 70 (ARA70) to the AR. RNA-Polymerase
  II (RNAP2) can then transcribe AR-dependent genes.'
