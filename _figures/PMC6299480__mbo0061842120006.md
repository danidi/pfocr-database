caption: 'The HOG and PKA pathways collaborate to regulate glycogen and trehalose
  metabolism for cell wall polysaccharide precursor biosynthesis during osmotic stress
  conditions. In the absence of osmotic stress, the PkaR and PkaC1 subunits form a
  protein complex with the HOG MAPK kinases SakA and MpkC. Upon the detection of osmotic
  stress, the HOG MAPK cascade is activated, signaling to Pbs2, which in turn phosphorylates
  SakA. The active SakA acts upon the PKA regulatory subunit, resulting in the dissociation
  of PkaR from the complex and the activation of PkaC1. The MpkC-SakA-PkaC1 complex
  can now control trehalose and glycogen metabolism to counteract the osmotic stress
  via two distinct pathways: (a) indirectly, through controlling the transcription
  factor of the carbon catabolite repression CreA that regulates the expression of
  genes encoding enzymes required for glycogen and trehalose utilization; and (b)
  directly, through controlling the activity of enzymes involved in glycogen and trehalose
  metabolism. The degradation of glycogen and trehalose results in the release of
  glucose, serving as a precursor for chitin, glucan, and galactomannan biosynthesis,
  through a variety of enzymatic steps. The chitin and galactomannan biosynthetic
  pathways were predicted based on homology with Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the
  BioCyc Pathway/Genome Database Collection website. Dashed arrows depict several
  steps in the pathway. TphA, trehalase phosphorylase; TslA/B, trehalose 6-phosphate
  synthase; HxkA, hexokinase; GlkA, glucokinase; PgmA/B, phosphoglucomutase; GalF,
  UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase; Fks1, β-1,3-glucan synthase; GdbA,
  glycogen debranching enzyme; and GsyA, glycogen synthase.'
