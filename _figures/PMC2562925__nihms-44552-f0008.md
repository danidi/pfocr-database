caption: Schematic depicting the roles of p53 and wnt7b in proposed pathway for NGF-mediated
  neurite outgrowth in PC12 differentiation. Briefly, NGF through its receptor TrkA,
  promotes cytosolic translocation and phosphorylating activation at Ser15 (and other
  sites) of the p53 transcription factor during PC12 neuronal differentiation. P53
  activates transcription of wnt7b and other target loci. Wnt7b processing and secretion
  occurs with increased concomitant expression of cognate Fzd7 and Fzd9 receptors
  mediated by NGF activity (independent of p53) to ultimately generate a competent
  cell. Wnt7b stimulates JNK signaling activity via a noncanonical wnt pathway involving
  the putative receptors Fzd9 and/or Fzd7. Wnt-regulated JNK signaling promotes the
  outgrowth of neurites and morphological differentiation of the PC12 cell. See Discussion
  for further detail.
