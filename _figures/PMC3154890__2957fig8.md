caption: Schematic model of Dg function in epidermal ectoderm differentiation. The
  data established that the Notch signaling pathway activates X-dg transcription in
  inner cell precursors of the epidermal ectoderm. As a result, the inner cell precursors
  set up the laminin in the ECM, allowing the access of ligands to their receptors.
  This activates a cascade of events that promotes the intercalation of the precursors
  of ciliated cells and the expression of P63, which are required for epidermal differentiation.
