caption: Innate immunity and the mucosa. (A) Pathogenesis of leaky gut. The mucosal
  barrier normally restricts passage of luminal contents, including microbes and their
  products, but a small fraction of these materials do cross the tight junction. This
  diagram shows how DCs and macrophages react to these materials. These innate immune
  cells release cytokines that exert proinflammatory (TNF and interferon-γ) and anti-inflammatory
  (IL-13) effects. If proinflammatory signals dominate and signal to the ME, MLCK
  can be activated to cause barrier dysfunction through the leak pathway, allowing
  an increase in the amount of luminal material presented to immune cells. In the
  absence of appropriate immune regulation, immune activation may cause further proinflammatory
  immune activation, cytokine release, and barrier loss, resulting in a self-amplifying
  cycle that can result in disease. (B) Neutrophil collateral damage from neutrophil
  extracellular traps (NET) formation. Neutrophil lysis after phagocytosis. Cytolysis
  is programmed (eg, necroptosis) or caused by direct damage. Neutrophil lysis is
  caused by cytolytic toxins, pore-forming agents, physical injury, or frustrated
  phagocytosis. This can result in the formation of NETs during neutrophil lysis.
  Hydrolytic enzymes–DNA complexes are released in the NETs, enhancing the proinflammatory
  response and tissue destruction, contributing to collateral damage and disease.
  IFN, interferon; M, macrophage; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase.
