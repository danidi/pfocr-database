caption: The extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of cell death may activate during adipocyte
  hypertrophy and result in adipocyte cell death. In the extrinsic pathway, death
  receptors including Fas, TNF-R1 and TRAIL-Rs are engaged by their natural ligands.
  These receptors trigger intracellular cascades that activate death-inducing proteolytic
  enzymes, especially caspases. In the intrinsic pathway, organelle stress such as
  lysosomal permeabilization or ER stress activates pro-apoptotic proteins such as
  Bid or Bax resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction with release of several pro-apoptotic
  proteins into the cytosol including cytochrome c, which then forms an activation
  complex with apoptotic-protein activation factor-1 (Apaf-1) and caspase 9, the apoptosome.
