caption: Mineral balance in osteocyte-less (OCL) mice. Osteocyte ablation affects
  mineral metabolism in the kidney and intestinal tract. The OCL mice showed increased
  renal inorganic phosphate (Pi) excretion (suppression of Npt2a and Npt2c) by enhanced
  intestinal Pi absorption (elevation of Npt2b). The OCL mice exhibited markedly suppressed
  renal Klotho expression, possibly reflecting a disrupted FGF23–Klotho system. OCL
  causes abnormalities in the bile acid (FGF15/FXR/CYP7A1) signaling pathway in the
  intestine–liver axis and stimulates intestinal Pi absorption. Thus, osteocytes may
  be an important regulator of mineral balance in addition to bile acid metabolism.
