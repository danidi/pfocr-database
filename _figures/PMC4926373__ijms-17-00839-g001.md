caption: 'Schematic overview of DNA damaging agents, radiotherapy, DNA damage, the
  cellular response upon DNA damage, genetic variation, epigenetic regulation and
  cancer therapy response. Genotoxic agents and radiation induce DNA damage, which
  activates the DNA damage response. The DNA damage response consists of three steps
  processes: At the first time, DNA damage was recognized by DNA damage association
  proteins, then transducing damage signals to the cell, lastly, cell cycle arrest,
  DNA repair and apoptosis biological process were activated by DNA damage. Thus,
  cancer cells will be killed. DNA damage response became a therapeutic target. However,
  tumors can develop therapy resistance by activating or inhibiting various processes
  within the DNA damage response by a bidirectional regulatory pathway exists between
  DNA damage response and miRNAs, lncRNA, genetic variation in DNA repair genes, which
  will influence DNA damage response, then regulation radio(chemo)therapy response.'
