caption: 'Schematic illustration of a causal network in the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
  (IPA) environment. The figure shows the dominant e-miRNAs (comb-shaped symbols),
  their significantly associated angiogenesis functions (circles in the pink shade)
  and angiogenic factors (circles in the cyan shade). The angiogenic factors selected
  (VEGFA, VEGFR1, MMP7, and HGF) were associated to recurrent ischemic events in ICAD
  in previously published studies (Reference #21 and #22). The e-miRNAs and their
  target molecules and functions are connected through dotted lines ended with either
  an arrow or a perpendicular solid line, indicating activated or inhibitory effect,
  respectively. A biological function or molecule with a stronger association to e-miRNAs
  has a larger circular size. The relative expression levels of the e-miRNAs in non-responders
  were scaled by a diverging palette from dark green (downexpression) to dark red
  (upexpression), while the regulatory effect on the biological functions and molecules
  were scaled by the other diverging palette from dark blue (downregulation) to dark
  orange (upregulation). The specific e-miRNA expression profiles in non-responders
  is predicted by the molecular activity predictor (MAP) to inhibit all the proangiogenesis-related
  biological functions with the exception of differentiation of endothelial cells,
  resulting in a net inhibition of angiogenesis. The expression change of the molecules
  in accordance to the e-miRNA expression profile in non-responders is consistent
  with the actual findings in the previous studies. VEGFA, vascular endothelial growth
  factor A; VEGFR1, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1; MMP7, matrix metalloproteinase
