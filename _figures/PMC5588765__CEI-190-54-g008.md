caption: Graphical abstract. A nucleotide‐binding oligomerization domain‐containing
  protein 1 (NOD1) ligand, FK565, activates vascular cells, which produce large amounts
  of chemokines. Chemokine receptor‐expressing monocytes in the peripheral blood are
  recruited to FK565‐activated vascular cells. This process subsequently induces the
  differentiation of the monocytes into cardiac macrophages, which play a pivotal
  role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary arteritis. Calcineurin inhibitors exacerbate
  NOD1‐mediated coronary arteritis in a dose‐dependent manner in a murine model of
  Kawasaki disease through the activation of vascular cells and macrophages via the
  myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) pathway. [Colour figure
