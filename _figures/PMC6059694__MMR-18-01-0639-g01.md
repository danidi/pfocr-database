caption: Mechanistic overview of AD with neuronal signaling pathways. (A) General
  mechanism of tau-mediated AD is presented. A double membrane is highlighted in silver
  containing an embedded complex of β-secretase and APP (). β-secretase and APP protein
  are indicated by maroon and purple colors, respectively. The γ-secretase enzyme
  is acting to cleave APP into Aβ40 and Aβ42 subunits. The clump of Aβ40, termed amyloid
  plaques, are generated by a process termed oligomerization and interactions with
  other two enzymes, APoE and neprilysin IDE. The aggregated plaques lead to neuronal
  loss and synaptic dysfunctionality, which ultimately results in cognition deficits.
  (B) In the acetylcholine signaling pathway, acetylcholine stimulates calcium influx
  after interacting with its respective receptor at the synaptic complex. This calcium
  flux activates a series of signaling proteins, including CaMKII/IV, ERK/MAPK and
  CREB. As a result, the activated enzymatic cascade leads to altered gene expression
  and may govern cognition symptoms via LTP (–). (C) In the serotonin signaling pathway,
  activation of the 5-HT6 receptor stimulates G-proteins, which results in increased
  cAMP production via AC activation. This cAMP triggers PKA activation, which phosphorylates
  and regulates the CREB transcription factor, which subsequently leads to cognition
  dysfunction (). (D) In the glutamic acid signaling pathway, activation of the NMDA
  receptor by glutamic acid mediates calcium signaling from presynaptic to postsynaptic
  neurons. CaM and ERK1/2 protein cascades are activated, which ultimately leads to
  CREB activation and cognition dysfunction (–). AD, Alzheimer's disease; APP, amyloid
