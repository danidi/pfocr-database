caption: Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT)
  pathway of cytokine action. Cytokines bind to receptors embedded in the cell surface,
  triggering the activation of one or more JAKs. The JAK then phosphorylates the receptors,
  and when the STATs bind, they are phosphorylated by receptors. Once the STAT is
  phosphorylated, it acts on the transcription and translation of DNA within the nucleus
  to regulate gene expression. The cell will then induce a signalling pathway, upregulate
  or downregulate more cytokines, or activate other cell types [,].
