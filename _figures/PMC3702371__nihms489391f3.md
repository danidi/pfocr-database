caption: 'A zinc-mediated shift in the Bax to Bcl-2 ratio promotes the translocation
  of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, which triggers the activation
  of caspase 9 and caspase 3, cleavage of nuclear PARP and, ultimately, apoptosis.
  NF-κB activation is a major pathway contributing to prostate cancer development
  and progression. NF-κB regulates the susceptibility of malignant cells to apoptosis
  through transcriptional control of antiapoptotic genes, which act on different levels
  of the apoptotic pathway. The central mechanisms of IAP apoptotic suppression seem
  to be through direct caspase and pro-caspase inhibition. Abbreviations: IAP inhibitor
  of apoptosis protein; PARP, poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase.'
