caption: Dose-dependent response to H2O2 is regulated by distinct signaling and transcription
  factors. A peroxide-sensing two-component pathway, which regulates the MAP kinase
  module, is required for the response to low but not high concentrations of the oxidant.
  This pathway interacts with the MAPK pathway through either of the two MAPKKKs.
  A distinct peroxide-sensing pathway responds to high levels of peroxide stress in
  which both MAPKKKs are needed to relay the signal to Sty1. Thus, different sensing
  pathways are being used to respond to different intensities of the same stress.
  With increasing levels of peroxide stress more of the cellular Sty1 MAPK is phosphorylated.
  At the level of target gene expression, two transcription factors, Pap1 and Atf1,
  were found to have distinct roles in controlling the response to H2O2, inducing
  specific target genes in response to either low or high concentrations of oxidant.
