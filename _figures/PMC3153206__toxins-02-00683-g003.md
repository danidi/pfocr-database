caption: .Schematic model of the neuronal reflex controlling the intestinal secretion
  and alteration by enterotoxins. Cholera toxin (CT) triggers the release of serotonin
  (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells, mainly located in intestinal crypts, which stimulates
  enterocyte secretion through 5-HT2 receptors and activates afferent sensory neurons
  through 5-HT3, 5-HT4 receptors. The neuronal signal is relayed through the submucosal
  and myenteric plexuses leading to activation of secretomotor neurons including acetylcholine
  (ACh) and vaso-intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons. ACh stimulates M2 receptors on
  enterocytes and VIP recognizes specific enterocyte receptors. The neuronal-dependent
  intestinal secretion is negatively regulated by noradrenergic and enkephalinergic
  neurons. C. difficile ToxA stimulates primary sensory neurons leading to the release
  of substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP) and subsequently
  causing intestinal secretion and inflammation. ToxA first interacts with intestinal
  epithelial cells causing actin cytoskeleton alteration and release of cytokines,
  which are probably the stimulators of primary sensory neurons. In addition, ToxA
  attenuates the inhibitory response of noradrenergic and enkephalinergic neurons.
  The precise ToxA pathway permitting its interaction with the enteric nervous system
  is not yet known.
