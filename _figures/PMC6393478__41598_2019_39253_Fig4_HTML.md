caption: 'Upregulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway resulted in the accumulation
  of metabolites from different sub-branches under cold stress and elevated CO2 levels.
  Grape berries of ‘Superior Seedless’ after harvest (T0), after storage for 6 weeks
  at low temperature (TC) or after storage at low temperature under O2 level of 5
  kPa and CO2 levels of 15 kPa (T15). Graphs are colored according to the following
  key: flavonols (black), dihydroflavonols (green), flavan-3-ols and their derivative
  proanthocyanidins (red), stilbenoids (purple). Gene are presented in the heat-map
  analysis if in at least one of the treatments (T0, Tc or T15), genes were down-
  or upregulated with LogFC > (1.5) and FDR < 0.05. Heat-map was performed based on
  normalized read counts for the significantly regulated genes: red boxes indicate
  upregulated and green downregulated expression. Bar graphs describe changes in metabolite
  accumulation (Y-axis: relative abundance). In the heat-maps and in the bar graphs,
  samples are arranged, from left to right, as T0, TC and T15. PAL, phenylalanine
  ammonia lyase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase; STS, stilbene
  synthase; CHS, chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase;
  F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; FLS, flavonol synthase; F3′5′H, flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase;
  DFR, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase; ANS, anthocyanidin synthase; ANR, anthocyanidin
  reductase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase. PBS3 and EPS1 two putative regulatory
  genes those are associated to salicylate biosynthesis. Dashed lines represent multi-step
  or unknown metabolic process while full line represents a single known enzymatic
  step. Levels of metabolites and expression of genes were analyzed based on three
  biological replications for each treatment (n = 3). Statistical analysis is presented
  in Supplementary Table . Units for metabolite levels are in peak abundance (Abun.).'
