caption: Synaptic model of caffeine-MDMA interactions. MDMA stimulates 5-HT release
  and also provokes dopamine release, subsequent to 5-HT2 receptor activation on the
  dopaminergic nerve terminal. Increased dopamine release subsequently leads to the
  activation of postsynaptic dopamine D1 receptors, leading to D1-mediated changes
  including hyperthermia. Caffeine may interact with this process by (i) facilitating
  dopamine release via a pre-synaptic adenosine A1-dependent mechanism; (ii) inhibiting
  PDE and thereby inducing an accumulation of intracellular cAMP following dopamine
  D1 receptor activation. With respect to hyperthermic responses, results to date
  would seem to favour the latter possibility as the influence of caffeine on MDMA-induced
  dopamine release was restricted to the striatum. Via inhibition of PDE, caffeine
  prevents cAMP metabolism and augments the activity of the PKA pathway, thereby increasing
  the phosphorylation of CREB and DARPP-32 in the hypothalamus. Additional mechanisms
  may also be possible, including (iii) inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors and
  (iv) prevention of intracellular cAMP breakdown following adenosine receptor blockade.
  It appears that both PDE inhibition and adenosine receptor antagonism in combination
  are required to mimic the hyperthermic interaction between caffeine and MDMA, suggestive
  of a synergistic interaction between these two pharmacological actions of caffeine.
  Activation of pre-synaptic dopamine D2 receptors inhibits dopamine release, leading
  to opposing physiological responses to MDMA under specific conditions (i.e. hypothermia
  in singly housed rats or in low ambient temperatures). In this regard, it is proposed
  that co-administration with caffeine leads to a switch from dopamine D2 receptor
  activation to promotion of a dopamine D1 receptor-mediated response, consistent
  with an overall augmentation of dopaminergic transmission (v). With regard to postsynaptic
  dopamine D2 receptors, co-administration with caffeine inhibits adenosine A2A receptors,
  which are physiologically negatively coupled with postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptors,
  leading to an enhancement of dopamine D2-related responses (vi). Postsynaptic dopamine
  D1 and D2 receptors operate synergistically in a number of synaptic regions (vii).
  The cascade of reactions signals the convergent inter- and intracellular points
  at which the pharmacodynamic actions of caffeine and MDMA may interact and which
  may account for the profound behavioural and physiological changes, which are characteristic
  of this drug interaction.
