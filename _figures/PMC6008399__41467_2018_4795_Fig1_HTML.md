caption: 'The pathway of methanol assimilation in E. coli. Heterologous enzymes required
  for methanol assimilation in E. coli are shown in blue. Methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh)
  catalyzes the thermodynamically uphill NAD-dependent oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde
  (ΔG0′ = +34.2 kJ mol−1), which is ligated to ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) in an aldol
  reaction catalyzed by hexulose phosphate synthase (Hps). The resulting hexulose
  (H6P) is isomerized by phosphohexulose isomerase (Phi) to fructose 6-phosphate (F6P),
  which is metabolized through native E. coli central metabolism. A portion of the
  F6P must be used to regenerate Ru5P through the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle
  to enable further formaldehyde assimilation. Two major variants of this cycle are
  known, the transaldolase (Tal) and sedoheptulose bisphosphatase (SBPase), which
  are named for the enzyme that produces sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, and differ in
  their ATP requirements. The red moiety denotes the position of assimilated methanol.
  H6P: D-arabino-3-hexulo-6-phosphate, G3P: glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate'
