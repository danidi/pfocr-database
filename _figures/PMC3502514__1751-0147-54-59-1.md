caption: Activation of stress signalling pathways in the liver of sows during lactation.
  Activation of Nrf2 and NF-κB during lactation is mediated by various stimuli including
  reactive oxygen species (ROS), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cytokines,
  which are known activators of both, Nrf2 and NF-κB. Activation of Nrf2 leads to
  up-regulation of classical Nrf2 target genes such as glutathione peroxidase 1 (encoded
  by GPX1), superoxide dismutase (encoded by SOD) and cytoprotective proteins [heme
  oxygenase 1 (encoded by HO-1), NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1 (encoded by NQO1),
  peroxiredoxin 6 (encoded by PRDX6), thioredoxin reductase 1 (encoded by TXNRD1),
  glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, and polypeptide A1 (encoded by UGT1A1)]. Acivation
  of NF-κB results in the induction of acute phase proteins such as haptoglobin (encoded
  by HP), fibrinogen γ (encoded by FGG), complement factor B (encoded by CFB), C-reactive
  protein (encoded by CRP) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (encoded by LBP).
  Activation of stress signalling pathways during lactation in sows might be interpreted
  as a physiologic means to counteract the inflammatory process and to protect the
  liver against deleterious effects of inflammatory signals and ROS, which are released
  at elevated levels as a consequence of the metabolic and immunologic adaptations
  occurring during the transition from pregnancy to lactation.
