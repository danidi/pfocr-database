caption: (A,B) Top three significant networks; (C) Significant canonical pathways;
  (D) Transcriptional patterns related to the leukocyte extravasation signaling; (E)
  A heat map of the genes related to leukocyte extravasation signaling in the epididymal
  white adipose tissue (eWAT) of Taeeumjowuitang (TJ)-treated mice versus high-fat
  diet (HFD)-fed mice. The significant networks and pathways were identified by downregulated
  differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the eWAT of TJ versus HFD, using Ingenuity
  Pathway Analysis (IPA). A red-green color scale depicts normalized expression levels
  (based on Z-scores) in FPKM values. The lines between genes represent known interactions
  (solid lines represent direct interactions; dashed lines represent indirect interactions).
  White objects denote measured genes with no significant change, red shading denotes
  upregulation, and green shading downregulation in expression relative to the HFD.
  The darker the color, either red or green, the higher the fold change.
