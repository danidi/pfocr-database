caption: 'Molecules involved in canonical Fas signaling are illustrated on top and
  the normal signaling pathway on the left. Membrane-bound Fas ligand binds the pre-associated
  trimeric Fas and triggers formation of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
  by recruiting adaptor FADD (Fas-associated death domain) protein, caspase-8 (Casp8)
  and/or caspase-10 (Casp10). On the right, the identified gene mutations in ALPS
  and ALPS-like patients are linked to their clinical classifications. The percentage
  incidence for each type is shown in parenthesis. Mutations for ALPS: Type-Ia: Fas;
  Type-Ib: Fas ligand; Type-Im: somatic mutation of Fas; Type-II: Casp-10; Type-III:
  unknown genetic defect; Type-IV: N-Ras (neuroblastoma Ras, a molecule involved in
  the regulation of cytokine-withdrawal apoptosis); CEDS (Caspase-8 deficiency state):
  Casp8 homozygous gene defect. Bim stands for BCL-2-interacting mediator of cell
  death.'
