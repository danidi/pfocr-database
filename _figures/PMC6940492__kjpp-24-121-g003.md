caption: (Left) GSK3β is normally inactive when phosphorylated, for example, by its
  upstream effector, Akt, while ERM is active contributing to the maintenance of cell
  structures. (Middle) When LY294002 is present, as Akt becomes inactive, so does
  GSK3β active by less chance of phosphorylation. Interestingly, ERM also becomes
  inactive correspondingly. (Right) With S9 peptide entered, Akt is now competing
  with S9 against its phosphorylation site of GSK3β, so there is more chance that
  active (un-phosphorylated) form of GSK3β exists. Again with S9, ERM becomes inactive
  correspondingly, suggesting that it is under the regulation of Akt and GSK3β.
