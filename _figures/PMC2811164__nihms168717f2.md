caption: Summary of folate-homocysteine metabolism. The primary outputs of the pathway
  are to 1. support proliferation and DNA repair by the synthesis of nucleotides thymidine
  via thymidylate synthase (and purines from 10-Formyl THF); 2. support methylation
  of DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids through the major methyl donor, S-adenosyl methionine
  (SAM). In this part of the cycle, Hcy is converted to Met by methionine synthase,
  gaining a methyl group from methyl-THF. * In some tissues, Hcy can also be converted
  to Met from betaine through conversion of choline to betaine and transfer of a methyl
  group catalyzed by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase. DHF=dihydrofolate, THF=tetrahydrofolate,
  MTHF=methyltetrahydrofolate, Hcy=homocysteine, Met=methionine, SAH=S-adenosyl homocysteine,
  dUMP=deoxyuridine monophosphate, dTMP=deoxythymidine monophosphate, MTHFR=methyltetrahydrofolate
  reductase.
