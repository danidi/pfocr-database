caption: Modulation of neurophysiology by S1R. Normally residing at the MAM, S1R is
  released from BiP upon activation from ER calcium depletion, ER stress or agonist
  stimulation, freeing it to interact with its client proteins. Within the MAM, S1R
  regulates lipid dynamics and chaperones InsP3R3 to the MAM, facilitating calcium
  flux from the ER to mitochondria. This enhances ATP production. S1R’s actions on
  transcriptional pathways counteract oxidative stress through upregulation of antioxidants.
  Once activated, S1R redistributes to the entire ER network where it interacts with
  additional targets including InsP3R1, STIM1 and several plasma membrane ion channels
  and receptors. For example, S1R activation by pridopidine in striatal MSNs attenuates
  ER calcium release from InsP3R1 when it is hyperactive in HD from mutant Huntingtin
  protein, leading to suppression of synaptotoxic signals mediated by store-operated
  calcium entry channels (SOCCs). Conversely, nSOC pathway activity is important for
  mushroom spine stability in AD, but it is downregulated from reduced ER calcium
  leakage in AD models. In hippocampal neurons, S1R decreases ER calcium levels, possibly
  though positive regulation of presenilin leak channels (not shown). This restores
  nSOC pathway activity and promotes mushroom spine stability. S1R activation also
  limits excitotoxicity by decreasing activity of Nav and Cav channels, while promoting
  activity of some Kv channels. S1R enhances NMDAR activity, which is important for
  induction of LTP as well as activation of calcium-dependent transcription factors.
  S1R also modulates several GPCRs, which can influence several physiological processes
  including monoamine neurotransmission. Moreover, S1R activation promotes synaptic
  plasticity and neuronal survival through upregulation of BDNF expression and secretion
  as well as direct stimulation of TrkB receptors. S1R monomers are shown with the
  crystal structure adapted from , but S1R ligand-dependent oligomerization/monomerization
  may confer specificity in its diverse actions.
