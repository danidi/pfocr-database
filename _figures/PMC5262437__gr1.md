caption: 'The analytical pipeline, its application in identifying associated pathways
  with major depressive disorder (MDD) and its findings in two independent samples:
  Generation Scotland: The Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) and Psychiatric
  Genomics Consortium (PGC:MDD). (A) Design of the analytical pipeline. In the pipeline,
  pathway analysis was performed for 1035 pathways, significant pathways were analyzed
  with multilevel regional heritability analyses (RHAs) in the framework of genomic
  restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) analysis to quantify and localize the genetic
  effects on MDD. In pathway analysis, GRASS was applied to the phenotype and genotype
  data of 6455 individuals from the GS:SFHS sample. MAGENTA was applied to the summary
  data from PGC:MDD genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on 18,759 individuals.
  (B) The findings by the analytical pipeline in the two samples. The NETRIN1 signaling
  pathway was identified as an associated pathway with MDD, and the association signals
  were localized to its gene DCC and the subregion level. h2, heritability; Sig, significant;
  SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism.'
