caption: An engineered T-cell proliferation regulatory system utilizing a synthetic
  RNA device to achieve drug-mediated modulation of cell signaling and proliferation.
  (A) The common γ-chain T-cell proliferation pathway and integration of a synthetic
  controller targeted to the upstream signaling events. (B) An engineered T-cell proliferation
  regulatory system on the basis of programmable drug-mediated regulation of cytokine
  expression from a synthetic ribozyme switch. Ribozyme color scheme is as described
  in ref. .
