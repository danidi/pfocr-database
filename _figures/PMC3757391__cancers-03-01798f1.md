caption: Maintainance of DNA Methylation. (A-B)The preferential substrate for the
  maintenance cytosine methyltransferase, DNMT1, is hemi-methylated CpG sites resulting
  from newly synthesized DNA in somatic cells. DNMT1 is present at the replication
  fork, and functions with the help of partner proteins including UHRF and PCNA. (C)
  Post-replication, DNMT1 and a methyl-CpG binding protein MBD4 can be localized together
  at DNA damage sites and may be part of cellular pathway response that activates
  apoptosis. MBD4 interacts directly with both DNMT1 and MLH1 leading to recruitment
  of all three at DNA damage sites. (D) MBD4 has also been shown to recruit Fas-associated
  death domain protein (FADD), which bridges death receptors with initiator caspases.
  FADD may also be an apoptotic effector via MBD4. (E) Several active DNA demethylation
  models have been proposed. MBD4 was reported to execute active DNA demethylation
  at the CYP27B1 promoter in response to PTH (Parathyroid Hormone) signaling. Similarly
  TDG (Thymine DNA glycosylase) can also interact with Dnmt3A and Dnmt3B and function
  as 5meC glycosylase activity against hemi-methylated DNA with the same weak excision
  activity as MBD4. In zebrafish embryos Aid, Mbd4 and the DNA repair protein Gadd45a
  may cooperate to induce demethylation. Thymine glycosylases such as TDG and MBD4
  may function on deamination of 5-methyl-cytosine by repairing the resulting mismatch.
  (F) TET1 is capable of acting on both fully methylated and hemi-methylated DNA,
  producing 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in DNA, which may also act in signaling
  pathways associated with turnover and maintenance of the epigenome.
