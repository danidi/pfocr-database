caption: Functions of IL-1β signaling in cancer. The IL-1 signaling pathway is activated
  through the binding of IL-1α or IL-1β to the IL-1RI. This is followed by dimerization
  of IL-1R1 with IL-1RAcP. This interaction may be competitively inhibited by the
  IL-1RA and IL-38. Agonist binding is followed by engagement of further signaling
  intermediates with subsequent activation of transcription factors such as NF-κB
  and AP-1. Transcription of inflammatory genes is upregulated which may then result
  in pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic phenotypes.
