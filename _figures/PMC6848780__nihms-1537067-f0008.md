caption: Compared with the WT liver, the GSH-deficient (due to loss of GCLM) liver
  exhibits intrinsic metabolic changes (green shaded area) involving the metabolism
  of amino acids, lipid, fatty acids, and glucose. They represent metabolic adaptations
  largely mediated by transcriptional mechanisms. The GSH-deficient (Gclm-KO) liver
  is acetyl-CoA enriched, as a result of increased production from pyruvate oxidation
  and fatty acid oxidation, and reduced flux to de novo lipogenesis. Following chronic
  alcohol consumption, these metabolic adaptations remain functional and are supplemented
  by unique metabolic changes occurring in the ethanol-exposed Gclm-KO liver (orange
  shaded area), including increased acetyl-CoA flux to N-acetylation of amino acids
  and hexosamine biosynthesis, elevated production of glutamate (that boosts GSH biosynthesis
  and serves as an alternative sink for ethanol-derived acetyl group), induction of
  the glucuronate pathway (that contributes to ethanol metabolism), and induction
  of nucleotide biosynthesis (that feeds into hexosamine biosynthesis and glucuronic
  acid pathways). Post-transcriptional mechanisms likely play a larger role in mediating
  metabolic adaptations upon ethanol exposure. Such coordinate reprograming of hepatic
  metabolic machinery serves to protect Gclm-KO mice against alcohol-induced steatosis.
  Hepatic levels of metabolites (circles) or activities of metabolic pathways (boxes)
  in Gclm-KO mice that are higher (red outlined) or lower (blue outlined) than WT
  mice are shown. Grey bands with arrows indicate metabolic flux of metabolites. Lines
  terminated by solid diamonds indicate cellular source for downstream metabolic pathways.
