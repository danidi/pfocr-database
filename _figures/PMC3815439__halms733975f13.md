caption: In the intrinsic pathway, the pro-apoptotic protein Puma is the target of
  miR-221/222 and is regulated by p53, target of the protein SIRT1, itself regulated
  by miR-34a. Anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 is the direct target of miR-15a/16, and
  Bcl-xL is the indirect target of some members of the miR-17/92 and miR-106b/25 clusters
  that regulate the pro-apoptotic protein Bim. Several miRNAs repress the apoptosome
  proteins, such as miR-21 targeting APAF-1 and miR-133 targeting caspase-9. miR-1
  is a pro-apoptotic miRNA targeting HSP60 and HSP70, proteins that inhibit apoptosome
  formation. In the extrinsic pathway, concerning the CD95 receptor and its ligand
  CD95L (or FAS-L), miR-21 acts as a repressor of this ligand, whereas miR-182 lowers
  FADD expression. miR-21 also plays a role in caspase-3 regulation.
