caption: 'Schematic representation of glutamine and arginine biosynthetic pathway
  and the corresponding target enzymes inhibited by antimetabolite toxins produced
  by different Pseudomonas syringae pathovars. Unknown refers to the uncharacterized
  toxic activity from some strains of P. syringae pv. tomato. GS: Glutamine synthetase;
  OCT: Ornithine carbamoyltransferase; OAT: Ornithine acetyl transferase. Figure partially
  adapted from Arrebola et al. [].'
