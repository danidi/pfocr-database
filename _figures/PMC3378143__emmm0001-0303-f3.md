caption: In the fibrotic kidney or in the tumour inflammatory microenvironment TNF-α,
  Ang II, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hypoxia converge in the induction of NF-κB,
  the main inflammatory response pathway. TGF-β is first secreted to control the inflammatory
  response (dotted red line) but in a chronic inflammatory environment it behaves
  as a fibrogenic agent and as an inducer of invasiveness. Indeed, the signals released
  in response to inflammation, oxidative stress ad hypoxia in the stromal or interstitial
  cells (TAMs, CAFs, leukocytes and myofibroblasts) induce the EMT process in renal
  and carcinoma cells. TGF-β, NF-κB and hypoxia play a crucial role in the activation
  of EMT inducers in renal or carcinoma cells. NF-κB and hypoxia also contribute to
  the EMT process increasing the stability of the inducers. CAFs, cancer associated
  fibroblasts; CNS2, component of the signalosome; HIF1-α, hypoxia factor 1α; LOX,
  lysyl-oxidase; TAMs, tumour-associated macrophages.
