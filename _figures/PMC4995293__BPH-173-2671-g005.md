caption: Extracellular pH‐sensitive ion channels in the PNS. Illustration based on
  experiments performed in small‐diameter DRG neurons innervating peripheral organs.
  The scheme indicates the pathway of a signal from the sensory nerve terminals in
  an organ (in the example the heart) to the spinal cord and the brain and focuses
  on two specific locations, the peripheral nerve terminal (left) and the signalling
  along the sensory nerve axon (right). Only the ion channels that are modulated by
  pHe on the nerve terminal and along the axon are shown, indicated by the symbols
  ‘+’ (stimulation by lowering of pHe) and ‘−‘ (inhibition by lowering of pHe). Red
  symbols indicate that this modulation increases excitability, and blue symbols indicate
  that it decreases excitability. The number of symbols correlates with the pH‐dependence
  of the regulation (Table ) as indicated at the bottom of the figure.
