caption: Induction and maintenance of IDO in dendritic cells. DCs can express the
  immunosuppressive enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in response to many
  immunogenic and tolerogenic molecules. Agonists for IDO induction in DCs include
  cytokines, Toll-like Receptor (TLR) ligands, co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory molecules
  and tryptophan catabolites. DCs may also secrete factors that work in an autocrine
  fashion to elicit IDO; conversely, other cells of the immune system, such as T-cells,
  can also influence the induction of tryptophan catabolism in DCs. Although IDO can
  be induced through short-lived signals, expression of IDO in DCs is often maintained
  long term. Plausible mechanisms involved in IDO maintenance include persistent T-regulatory
  cell:DC interactions, TGFβ signaling and/or the kynurenine-aryl-hydrocarbon receptor
  (AhR) pathway.
