caption: 'There are three main approaches currently being pursued to modulate the
  FGL2–FcγRIIB pathway for clinical benefit: (1) development of rFGL2 (monomeric and
  oligomeric) to inhibit immune responses; (2) expansion of TIGIT+ Treg expressing
  high levels of FGL2, which would represent a cellular therapy for transplantation
  and autoimmune disease; and (3) development of anti-FGL2 monoclonal antibodies to
  inhibit FGL2 signaling and enhance immune responses in cancer and chronic infections.
  DC, dendritic cell; PVR, poliovirus receptor; rFGL2, recombinant FGL2; TIGIT, T
  cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains; Treg, regulatory T cell.'
