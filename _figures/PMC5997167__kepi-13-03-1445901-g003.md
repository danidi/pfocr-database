caption: 'Gene networks involved in the analyses of males with HCB exposure. The genes
  neighboring the significant CpG sites (with greater than 100% change of beta value
  per unit of HCB change and with more than 1 significant CpG site per gene) were
  subjected to pathway analyses. Left panel shows the top network involved: gene expression,
  reproductive system development and function, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction.
  Right panel shows the next top network involving cellular function and maintenance,
  cancer, organismal injury and abnormalities.'
