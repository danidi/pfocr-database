caption: Schematic diagram of EGFR-invadopodia signaling pathways altered by Abl inhibition
  in HNSCC. (a) The current invadopodia pathway depicting EGFR activation to cortactin
  phosphorylation as primarily determined in breast cancer cell lines. EGFR activation
  increases Src and Erk1/2 kinase activity, where Src stimulates Abl/Arg activation
  resulting in direct Abl/Arg cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation, while Erk1/2 directly
  phosphorylates cortactin S405/418. (b) In HNSCC, inhibition of Abl/Arg results in
  increased activation of EGFR through elevated HB-EGF synthesis and shedding, resulting
  in autocrine EGFR hyperstimulation. This leads to elevated Src activity that bypasses
  Abl/Arg and directly phosphorylates cortactin. Erk1/2 activation is also increased
  under these conditions, where the combined effect of enhanced Src and Erk1/2 activation
  increases cortactin phosphorylation and correlates with elevated HNSCC-mediated
  ECM degradation and invasion.
