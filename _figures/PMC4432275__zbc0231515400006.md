caption: Suggested model of c-Cbl regulating β-catenin. In the Wnt-off phase, c-Cbl
  exists in cytosol predominantly as monomers, but dimers are also observed. The dimerized
  species of c-Cbl binds and degrades β-catenin. Wnt-on phase is characterized by
  hypophosphorylated β-catenin, a species that interacts with c-Cbl, but not other
  E3 ligases such as β-TrCP or Jade-1. β-Catenin translocates into the nucleus to
  activate transcription of Wnt target genes (active β-catenin). In parallel, Wnt
  activation phosphorylates Tyr-731 on c-Cbl to increase its dimerization through
  the UBA domain facilitating its nuclear translocation. The dimerization also enhances
  binding and degradation of active β-catenin. Thus, in the Wnt-on phase, c-Cbl chases
  and suppresses a rapidly expanding pool of active β-catenin.
