caption: (A) IR induces multiple forms of DNA damage including DSBs that contain non-ligatable
  end groups such as 3’-phosphate and 3’-phosphoglycolate groups (indicated by ◆).
  (B) The Ku heterodimer (orange) binds the ends of the DSB, tethering the ends together.
  Recruitment of Ku to the DSB occurs independently of other known NHEJ or DSB repair
  proteins, consistent with Ku acting as the cornerstone of the NHEJ pathway. (C)
  Ku translocates inwards, allowing recruitment of DNA-PKcs (blue) such that it binds
  the extreme termini of the break (D). Recruitment of DNA-PKcs to the DSB requires
  Ku but no other NHEJ or DSB repair factors. Two DNA-PK molecules (DNA-PKcs bound
  to DNA-bound Ku) interact to tether the DSB together in what has been termed a “synaptic
  complex”. This triggers autophosphorylation (yellow circles) of DNA-PKcs in trans
  (E), inducing a conformational change that causes release of the DNA ends and/or
  release of phosphorylated DNA-PKcs from the complex. Whether DNA-PKcs is released
  prior to recruitment of the X4-L4 complex (green) and it’s associated factors (F),
  or whether it remains part of a multi-protein complex until repair is completed
  (M) is not known. Inhibition of the protein kinase activity of DNA-PKcs (step E),
  prevents dissociation of DNA-PKcs (step F), blocking access of NHEJ or other repair
  factors to the DSB, resulting in radiation sensitivity. (G) A portion of the total
  cellular DNA-PKcs interacts with the nuclease Artemis (red), but if or when Artemis
  is released from the DNA-PKcs complex (H) is not known. (I) PNK (pink) interacts
  with XRCC4 suggesting that it is recruited to the break with the X4-L4 complex (green)
  (J). XLF (yellow) and DNA pol μ and λ (purple) interact with both X4-L4 and Ku,
  suggesting that they are recruited after or at the same time as X4-L4 is recruited
  to the Ku-DNA complex (K). Other processing enzymes such as WRN and APLF (shown
  in grey) may also be recruited through interactions with DNA-bound Ku, XRCC4 and/or
  the X4-L4 complex (L). The order of recruitment of processing factors may be flexible
  and depend on the precise type of DNA damage present at the DSB. Multiple protein-protein
  and protein-DNA interactions may stabilize the formation of the complex at the DSB
  as well as aid in retention of NHEJ factors at the break. Once the ends are processed,
  the X4-L4 complex ligates the ends, repairing the break. Ligation of incompatible
  DNA ends is aided by the regulatory factor, XLF. How the various factors are released
  after repair is unknown, however, it is possible that ubiquitylation and/or proteolysis
  may be involved (N). Reactions requiring or enhanced by the presence of DNA-bound
  Ku are shown in red.
