caption: Schematic summary of the potential molecular mechanism of growth repression
  caused by kinesin family member 14 (KIF14) knockdown. KIF14 knockdown downregulates
  the expression of Skp2 and Cks1, which inhibits the proteasome-dependent p27Kip1
  ubiquitination pathway, leading to its accumulation. The increase in p27kip1 inhibits
  the expression of cyclins, including E1, D1 and B1, which leads to the suppression
  of cell cycle progression, resulting in the suppression of hepatocellular carcinoma
  tumorigenicity. Downregulated Skp2 and Cks1 may also influence cytokinesis failure.
