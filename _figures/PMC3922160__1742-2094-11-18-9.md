caption: Proposed model integrating viral and host biomarkers for disease severity
  and the effect of IFN-β in HAM/TSP. Viral tax could be driving the upregulation
  of CD80-expressing B cells in an IFN-γ/IRF-1 [,] or TNF/NF-κB [,,] dependent manner.
  HBZ downregulates tax [] and the NF-κB pathway [], thereby possibly downregulating
  CD80 expression. IFN-γ-producing CD4+CD25+CCR4+Foxp3- host cells [] could positively
  influence CD80 expression in a STAT-1/IRF-1-dependent manner. IFN-β induced downregulation
  of CD80 expression in B cells [] could be, in part, due to its antagonistic effect
  on IFN-γ [-] as well as modulation of cytokines (IL-10 and IL-12) [,] regulating
  IFN-γ. CD86 expression by IFN-β may be driven via STAT-1 or possibly via IL-10.
  HTLV-1-infected pDCs produce endogenous IFN-α [], which might upregulate B cell
  CD86 expression in vivo. The continuous arrows and inhibition lines indicate published
  data, while the discontinuous lines indicate hypothetical links drawn from this
  study. The proinflammatory molecules/cells are in shades of brown/red, while anti-inflammatory
  molecules/cells are in shades of green. Proposed biomarkers for HAM/TSP are enclosed
  in boxes.
