caption: Schematic of the Notch pathway. The Notch receptor is synthesized in the
  rough endoplasmic reticulum as a single polypeptide precursor and proteolytically
  cleaved in the trans-golgi network by the furin protease, creating a heterodimeric
  mature receptor that comprises noncovalently associated extracellular and transmembrane
  subunits. This assembly travels to the cell surface where it interacts with specific
  transmembrane ligands, such as jagged and δ-like 1. Notch activation can be repressed
  by BMP7 via an unknown mechanism. Following ligand activation and further proteolytic
  cleavage by ADAM10 and presenilin-1 (PSEN1) proteases, the Notch intracellular domain
  (NICD) is released and translocates to the nucleus where it regulates gene expression,
  converting CSL (C-promoter binding factor (CBF-1), suppressor of hairless (Su(H)),
  lin-12 and glp-1 (Lag-1)) repressor complexes into activator complexes, and inducing
  expression of the hairy-enhancer of split genes (eg, HES2 and HEY1).
