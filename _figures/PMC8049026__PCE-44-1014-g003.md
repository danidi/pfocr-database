caption: Simplified schematic overview of the signal transduction pathway of shade‐induced
  seed dormancy, early flowering, reduced branching, hyponasty and accelerated hypocotyl
  and petiole elongation. Interactions between important proteins (light green) and
  hormones (dark green) are shown and result in the different SAS responses. See main
  text for details. Arrows, positive effect; inhibitors, negative effect; solid lines,
  confirmed interactions/known signalling pathways; dotted lines, exact mechanisms
  to be elucidated. Created with BioRender.com [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
