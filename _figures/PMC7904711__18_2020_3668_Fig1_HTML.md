caption: The Shh pathway. a In the absence of SHH, SMO activity is inhibited by PTC.
  Cytosolic GLI3 is processed as a repressor (GLI3R) and inhibits transcription of
  Shh target genes. b Binding of SHH to PTC alleviates inhibition of SMO, and GLI2
  is proteolytically processed as an activator and is translocated to the nucleus,
  activating downstream transcription of SHH target genes, including GLI1
