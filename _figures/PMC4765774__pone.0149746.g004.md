caption: The N-end Rule pathway requires an adaptor protein ClpS that promotes substrate
  toward the ClpAP protease complex (A). Native proteins are modified to have N-degrons
  via the Aat transferase enzyme or other mechanisms. These proteins with N-degrons
  are similarly facilitated by ClpS to the ClpAP complex for degradation as the Ntag
  fused target proteins. Another system tags native proteins with C-degrons, tags
  signaling degradation on the C-terminus. These proteins are preferentially degraded
  in the ClpXP complex by the SspB adaptor protein but can be degraded in the ClpAP
  complex. The apparent degradation rate (β) for the Ntag-RFP construct was measured
  across different knockouts of these degradation pathway members in comparison to
  the ΔclpP strain (B). The presence of N-end Rule members (ClpA, ClpS, ClpP) was
  required for degradation as indicated by no detectable degradation rate. The absence
  of ClpX reduced degradation to zero as well. Deletion of Aat resulted in, perhaps,
  enhanced degradation, and removal of the SspB adaptor protein reduced degradation
  but did not eliminate it. Single * designates p < 0.05 and triple (***) designates
  p < 0.001. Calculations of p-values are between ΔclpP and the given condition. Values
  are mean ± s.e.m. (n = 4 to 10).
