caption: A putative transcriptional network that we have termed the “Diasporin Pathway”
  was constructed by applying the Occam’s Razor principle, i.e. the simplest explanation
  is likely correct, by minimizing the number of potential interactions that would
  still explain the results. The pathway consists primarily of the seven ECM eQTL/metastasis
  efficiency modifier candidate genes as well as a number of factors that are known
  to be modulators of metastasis. The transcriptional relationship between each gene
  was determined by using qPCR and microarray expression analysis of the highly metastatic
  Mvt-1 cell line stably transfected with one of the seven candidate genes. At this
  stage of analysis, Brd4 and Rrp1b appear to be at the heart of this network since
  both physically interact with the previously described metastasis efficiency modifier
  Sipa1.
