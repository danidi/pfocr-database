caption: A common thread in the mechanism of action of many sleep pharmacotherapies
  is NE. A pictorial representation integrating and summarizing the anatomical connections
  between noradrenergic neurons and the wake- and sleep-promoting systems, as well
  as potential sites of action of wake- and sleep-promoting drugs, is depicted in
  . For example, amphetamine directly induces release and blocks reuptake of NE, increasing
  its extracellular concentration and activating the ascending arousal pathway. And
  though the mechanism of modafinil has not been determined conclusively yet, its
  actions are blocked by α1AR antagonists, and there is some evidence that it may
  act as a NET inhibitor. In contrast, caffeine is one wake-promoting agent that does
  not appear to have a significant adrenergic component. On the other end of the sleep/wake
  spectrum, both benzodiazepines and z-drugs act to increase GABA transmission, resulting
  in inhibition of excitatory signals along arousal pathways, including those from
  the LC. NE is also involved in the synthesis of melatonin, and thus may help regulate
  the circadian as well as the homeostatic sleep processes. Finally, most antidepressants,
  including those used as insomnia treatments, affect the adrenergic system.
