caption: Schematic representation of AMF secretion and interaction with GPER-1, which
  drive EC progression. AMF is secreted through a non-classical mechanism and interacts
  with GPER-1, which results in GPER-1 activation and translocation. AMF binding with
  GPER-1 activates the PI3K signaling pathway, which enhances cell growth and suppresses
  cell apoptosis. The interaction between AMF and GPER-1 may contribute to tumor malignancy
  and provide targeted therapy for the treatment of EC
