caption: 'The aspartate-derived amino acid synthesis pathway as defined by Curien
  et al. []. Reactions are numbered according to the key. Green lines ending with
  solid arrows indicate activation of a reaction or potentiation of an allosteric
  effect, while red lines ending with daggers indicate inhibition of reactions or
  damping of an allosteric effect. Strong allosteric effects are indicated with solid
  lines, while weak effects are shown with dashed lines. The stoichiometry of each
  reaction is 1 to 1. Intermediates are abbreviated as follows: Ado-Met: S-adenosylmethionine;
  ASA: aspartate-semialdehyde; Asp: aspartate; AspP: aspartyl phosphate; Cys: cysteine;
  Hser: homoserine; Ile: isoleucine; Lys: lysine; PHser: phosphohomoserine; Thr: threonine;
  Val: valine'
