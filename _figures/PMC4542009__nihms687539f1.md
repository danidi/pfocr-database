caption: The major mediator of tumor angiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor
  A (VEGF-A, also called VEGF), specifically the circulating isoforms of VEGF — VEGF121
  and VEGF165. These isoforms signal through VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), the major
  VEGF signaling receptor that mediates sprouting angiogenesis (called kinase-insert
  domain–containing receptor [KDR] in humans and fetal liver kinase 1 [flk-1] in mice).
  The role of VEGFR-1 in sprouting angiogenesis is much less clear. VEGF is expressed
  in most types of human cancer, and increased expression in tumors is often associated
  with a less favorable prognosis. Induction of or an increase in VEGF expression
  in tumors can be caused by numerous environmental (epigenetic) factors such as hypoxia,
  low pH, inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6), growth factors (e.g., basic
  fibroblast growth factor), sex hormones (both androgens and estrogens), and chemokines
  (e.g., stromal-cell–derived factor 1). Other causes include genetic inductive changes
  such as activation of numerous different oncogenes or loss or mutational inactivation
  of a variety of tumor-suppressor genes. The binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to
  a cascade of different signaling pathways, two examples of which are shown, resulting
  in the up-regulation of genes involved in mediating the proliferation and migration
  of endothelial cells and promoting their survival and vascular permeability. For
  example, the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to dimerization of the receptor, followed
  by intracellular activation of the PLCγ–PKC–Raf kinase–MEK–mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathway and subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis and cell growth,
  whereas activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′–kinase (PI3K)–Akt pathway leads
  to increased endothelial-cell survival. Activation of src can lead to actin cytoskeleton
  changes and induction of cell migration. VEGF receptors are located on the endothelial-cell
  surface; however, intracellular (“intracrine”)–signaling VEGF receptors (VEGFR-2)
  may be present as well, and they are involved in promoting the survival of endothelial
  cells. The detailed structure of the intracellular VEGFR-2 in endothelial cells
  is not yet known, but it is shown as the full-length receptor that is normally bound
  to the cell surface. Binding of VEGF-C to VEGFR-3 mediates lymphangiogenesis. VEGF165
  can bind to neuropilin (NRP) receptors, which can act as coreceptors with VEGFR-2
  (horizontal arrow) to regulate angiogenesis. EGFR denotes epidermal growth factor
  receptor, flt-1 fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, PlGF placental growth factor, PTEN phosphatase
  and tensin homologue, S–S disulfide bond, and VHL von Hippel–Lindau.
