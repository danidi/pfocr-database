caption: p53 is activated by distinct stresses, some of which include as indicated,                                             ionising
  radiation, viral infection, metabolic stress induced by an altered                                             AMP/ATP
  ratio, and oncogene activation. The X-ray-induced Ser20 site kinase                                             is
  ATM-dependent, but its identity is unknown (highlighted by "?"). CK1 is                                             the
  DNA virus HHV-6B-induced p53 Ser20 kinase, but the upstream sensor is                                             currently
  undefined (highlighted by "?"). The Ser20 site kinase induced by                                             an
  elevated AMP/ATP ratio is AMPK, and LKB is the likely upstream sensor.                                             DAPK-1
  is the p53 Ser20 kinase induced by inappropriate oncogene                                             activation,
  and ERK or ARF are the likely upstream sensors. These data                                             support
  the formation of a model suggesting that the phosphorylation of p53                                             at
  Ser20 is triggered by distinct stress-responsive signaling cascades.                                             Future
  analysis will be required to determine the identity of all the                                             enzymes
  that mediate stress-induced phosphorylation at this site and                                             "integrate"
  the p53 response and developing disease models that deregulate                                             these
  signaling cascades.
