caption: Disrupted signaling pathways in GCB-DLBCL. Genetic lesions preferentially
  associated with GCB-DLBCL include (i) chromosomal translocations of BCL2 (up to
  35% of cases) and/or MYC (∼10% of cases), which lead to their ectopic expression
  in part by allowing them to bypass BCL6-mediated transcriptional repression; (ii)
  truncating mutations of the TNFRSF14 receptor, leading to weakened T-cell responses;
  (iii) gain-of-function mutations of EZH2 (∼20% of cases), which induce transcriptional
  silencing of various antiproliferative and tumor suppressor genes, including targets
  common to BCL6 (eg, CDKN1A and BLIMP1); (iv) point mutations in the BCL6 autoregulatory
  sequences (10% of cases). In addition, loss of PTEN expression is observed in as
  many as 55% of cases, as a consequence of genetic deletions (15%) and amplifications
  of miR17-92 (29%), resulting in activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
  Targeted agents currently in clinical trial (or, for BCL6, demonstrating activity
  in preclinical settings) are shown in red.
