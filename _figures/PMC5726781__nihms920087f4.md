caption: Schematic representation of major steps of SILAC analysis to identify phosphopeptides
  that are altered after treatment with MELK inhibitor OTSSP167 in melanoma cell lines
  (A375 and M14). B. Venn diagram showing commonly identified proteins that overlap
  with previously identified BRAFV00E and MEK targets. C. Consensus site for MELK-mediated
  phosphorylation amino acid recognition motif is shown. D. Consensus site for MELK-mediated
  phosphorylation, recognition motif based on amino acid hydrophobicity is shown.
  E. Ingenuity pathway analysis of the MELK targets identified by SILAC analysis revealed
  eight NF-κB regulatory proteins that showed downregulated phosphorylation after
  treatment with MELK inhibitor OTSSP167. F. Site of phosphorylation on NF-κB regulatory
  proteins for which reduced phosphorylation was observed in SILAC for melanoma cell
  lines, A375 and M14, after treatment with MELK inhibitor OTSSP167. See also , ,
