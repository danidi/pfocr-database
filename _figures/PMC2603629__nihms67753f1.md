caption: (A) The structures of the antimalarial compounds FR900098 and fosmidomycin.
  Both inhibit DXR, an essential enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway in
  malaria-causing parasites. (B) The initial reactions in the biosynthesis of 2-aminoethylphosphonic
  acid, fosfomycin, and bialaphos. In the first step, catalyzed by PEP mutase, phosphoenolpyruvate
  is rearranged to phosphonopyruvate, which is then decarboxylated to yield phosphonoacetaldehyde
  in a reaction catalyzed by phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase.
