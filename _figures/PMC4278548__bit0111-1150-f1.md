caption: 'Central metabolic routes and the aromatic compounds biosynthesis showing
  key metabolites and the genes involved in their transformation. (a) Central carbon
  metabolism showing RT-qPCR values of upregulated genes (1.6-fold or higher) or downregulated
  genes (−1.6-fold or lower) in parentheses for the strain PB12 pykAF−ppsA− and underlined
  in parentheses for strain PB11 pykAF−ppsA−. Reactions and deleted genes from the
  PEP–PYR node are indicated with discontinuous arrows and highlighted in boxes respectively.
  The RT-qPCR values of all the genes are presented in . The abbreviations are as
  follows: glucose (GLC), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), fructose-1,6-phosphate
  (F1,6P), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), glyceraldehyde-1,3-phosphate
  (G1,3P), 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG), phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP), pyruvate (PYR), acetate (Ace), acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), acetyl-phosphate (Ac-P),
  acetyl-AMP (A-AMP), citrate (CIT), isocitrate (ICT), glyoxylate (GOx), α-ketoglutarate
  (α-KG), succinyl-coenzyme A (SUC-CoA), succinate (SUC), fumarate (FUM), malate (MAL),
  oxaloacetate (OAA), 6-phosphogluconolactone (6PGNL), 6-phosphogluconate (6PGNT),
  ribulose-5-phosphate (RU5P), ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), xylulose-5-phosphate (X5P),
  seudoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P), erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), and 3-deoxy-c-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate
  (DAHP); (b) the common aromatic pathway leading to l-Phe, l-Tyr, and l-Trp and other
  compounds. Genetic modifications performed in this study are shown with plasmid-expressed
  genes underlined, chromosomal integrated genes in parentheses and inactivated genes
  with a cross (details in Materials and Methods and Supplementary file 1). Consecutive
  arrows indicate more than one catalytic step. The abbreviations are as follows:
  3-dehydroshikimic acid (DHS), shikimic acid (SA), shikimate 3-phosphate (S3P), chorismate
  (CHO), l-tryptophan (l-Trp), prephenate (PPA), 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP), phenylpyruvate
  (PPY), l-tyrosine (l-Tyr), l-phenylalanine (l-Phe), and l-Glutamate (l-Glu).'
