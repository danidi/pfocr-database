caption: Many human cancers including breast cancer possess an enhanced tumor-initiating
  capacity, can undergo self-renewal, partially recreate the cellular heterogeneity
  of the parental tumor, and seem to be generally more resistant than other cancer
  cells to conventional anticancer therapeutics. Over the last decade, studies have
  identified CSC in solid tumors including breast cancer that are responsible for
  tumor initiation, growth and metastasis [–]. Breast CSCs (BCSCs) are characterized
  by the expression of molecular markers (phenotype CD44+CD24−/ALDH+) []. Several
  factors could be linked to self-renewal of BCSC. Wnt, FGF (fibroblast growth factor),
  Notch, Hedgehog, and TGF-β/bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) signaling cascades
  constitute the stem-cell signaling network, which plays a key role in the maintenance
  or homeostasis of pluripotent stem cells and CSC. Human embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
  are supported by FGF and TGF-β signals, whereas mouse ESCs by LIF (leukemia inhibitory
  factor) and canonical Wnt signals []. Associations between birth weight, maternal
  levels of Insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1), breast cancer risk in progeny and
  BCSC have also been reported []. Recently, several reports have revealed that leptin
  regulates or activates certain oncogenes, such as HER2 [–], Akt [] as well as transcriptional
  factors, such as STAT3 [], NF-κB [] and Notch [–] which are critically associated
  with BCSC. In addition, leptin also activates the Notch signaling pathway [, ] that
  is important for the maintenance of SC or progenitors through the inhibition of
  differentiation [–] (See ). It is known that breast cancer cell lines contain BCSC.
  Although the percentage of CD44+/CD24− cells within cell lines does not correlate
  with tumorigenicity, these cells can form tumors and preferentially survive chemotherapy
  []. Interestingly, we have found leptin induces the expression of CD44 and ALDH1
  in several cancer cell lines []. In a recent report, leptin deficiency in murine
  mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Wnt-1 transgenic mice results in functional depletion
  of BCSCs leading to less tumor outgrowth []. More recently, Feldman et al also demonstrated
  that robust and selective expression of Ob-R is a characteristic feature of CSCs
  and of a broad array of embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells []. CSCs exhibit
  sensitized responses to leptin, including the phosphorylation and activation of
  STAT3 and induction of Oct4 and Sox2, thereby establishing a self-reinforcing signaling
  module [].
