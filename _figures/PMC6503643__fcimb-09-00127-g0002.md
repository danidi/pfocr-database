caption: HSVs modulate antiviral mechanisms related to cell death in non-immune cells.
  HSVs utilize numerous mechanisms to hamper the capacity of host cells to restrict
  viral infection. (A) The engagement of the TNFR receptor leads to the activation
  of caspase-8 eliciting apoptosis, or eventually RIP1/3 to induce necroptosis. However,
  HSV proteins ICP6 and ICP10 hamper signaling events related to these pathways, thus
  prolonging cell survival during infection. (B) Engagement of the Fas receptor with
  Fas ligand (FasL) generally leads to extrinsic apoptosis events mediated by the
  activation of caspase-8. However, HSV glycoproteins J (gJ) and gD block signaling
  events by this receptor. Additionally, the LAT transcript also interferes with caspase-8
  mediated signaling that usually leads to apoptosis. (C) However, HSV infection has
  been described to upregulate the expression of PUMA in the mitochondria of HSV-infected
  cells, which leads to BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis mediated by caspase-3. Thus, HSV
  may induce the intrinsic apoptotic pathway at later time points of infection after
  inhibiting apoptosis. (D) Another antiviral mechanism hampered by HSV infection
  is inhibition of cell-induced apoptosis due to translation arrest. Upon detection
  of viral components, host PKR triggers eIF2α phosphorylation, which inhibits its
  function and consequently mRNA translation, leading to global protein synthesis
  arrest and caspase-3 activation. However, the viral proteins US11 and γ34.5 impair
  eIF2α phosphorylation, allowing viral gene translation to ensue during infection
  and limiting apoptosis through this pathway. (E) The host protein ZAP can act as
  an antiviral factor that promotes degradation of viral mRNAs. However, its function
  is inhibited by the HSV protein UL41 (VHS), which promotes ZAP mRNA degradation.
  (F) Finally, infected cells may attempt to prevent the release of mature virion
  through a membrane protein called tetherin that is capable of binding to enveloped
  virions. As a countermeasure, the viral glycoprotein gD interacts with tetherin
  which ultimately provokes degradation of the latter. Black lines show cellular processes.
  Red lines show processes modulated by HSVs.
