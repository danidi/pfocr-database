caption: A schematic illustration of the Na+ and Ca2+signaling networks involving
  NCLX and SOCE cross talk. Ca2+ depletion of intracellular stores activates store‐operated
  Ca2+ entry (SOCE) pathway mediated through the highly Ca2+ selective, Ca2+ release‐activated
  Ca2+ (CRAC) currents. SOCE activation involves interaction upon store depletion
  of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ STIM1 with the plasma membrane channel protein
  Orai1. Upon store depletion, rise of cytosolic Na+ also occurs, apparently, reflecting
  the activation of non‐selective transient potential channel canonical (TRPC) channel
  isoforms. Cytosolic Na+ is required for powering NCLX to activate mitochondrial
  Ca2+ efflux, thus ensuring proper mitochondrial Ca2+ shuttling. This tight regulation
  by NCLX of mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ homeostasis prevents the excessive Ca2+ rise
  in mitochondrial matrix that would otherwise lead to increases in mitochondrial
  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent inhibition of SOCE via oxidation of
  a reactive cysteine at position C195 on an extracellular loop of Orai1.
