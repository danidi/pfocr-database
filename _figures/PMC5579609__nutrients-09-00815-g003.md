caption: 'PC-DHA levels depend on nutrition, liver and brain synthesis by PEMT and
  transport of LPC-DHA across the blood-brain barrier catalyzed by MFSD2A. Plasma
  PC levels and PC FA molecular species (e.g., PC-DHA) depend on hepatic PC metabolism,
  the dietary supply of choline and n-3 FA, including DHA, and PC and LPC flux between
  plasma and tissues (e.g., brain). Hepatic PEMT activity is high and the liver produces
  large amounts of PC-DHA by methylating PE for the needs of the entire organism.
  This PC-DHA is secreted by the liver into the circulation as a component of lipoproteins.
  Brain PEMT activity is relatively low and neuronal and glial PEMT produces PC-DHA
  to sustain local membranes. PC synthesis by PEMT requires three molecules of SAM
  that is synthesized from the amino acid, methionine. In addition to PC, PEMT generates
  SAH that is hydrolyzed to homocysteine. The latter can be converted back to methionine
  by two pathways: one catalyzed by betaine:homocysteine S-methyltransferase (BHMT)
  and another catalyzed by vitamin B12-requiring 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
  S-methyltransferase (MTR), in which methyltetrahydrofolate is used as a methyl donor.
  Betaine is the product of enzymatic oxidation of choline. Thus, dietary choline
  is used to produce PC directly and to convert homocysteine to methionine and subsequently
  to SAM. In this fashion the methyl groups derived from dietary choline can be utilized
  by PEMT to generate PC-DHA. Recent evidence indicates that the main source of brain
  DHA is LPC-DHA—the circulating deacylated metabolite of PC-DHA. The transport of
  LPC-DHA from plasma to the brain is catalyzed by MFSD2A. The blue arrows indicate
  flux and the black arrows represent enzymatic pathways. Protein names are in red.
  Dietary DHA is primarily stored in PE in tissues and only a small fraction is incorporated
  directly into PC. Homocysteine can also be converted to cysteine via cystathionine
  in a transsulfuration pathway that includes two vitamin B6-requiring enzymes, CBS
  and CTH. Abbreviations: BHMT, betaine:homocysteine S-methyltransferase; CBS, cystathionine-beta-synthase;
