caption: Schematic representation of stress-induced release of eHsp72. Stress (lightning
  blot) activates at least three pathways that result in the release of Hsp72 into
  the circulation. First, if trauma to the cell is overwhelming stress will activates
  the death pathway either by necrosis or apoptosis and Hsp72 is released from the
  cell. Second, stress can activate the stress response by triggering the trimerization
  and nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic HSF-1 (brown rods) to the heat shock element
  (HSE) and subsequent transcription of Hsp72 (stars). The increased intracellular
  Hsp72 chaperones peptides (Hsp72-peptide complex) and protects the cell from cell
  death under certain conditions. The Hsp72-peptide complex is expressed on the cell
  surface and released into the extracellular milieu within exosomes; Hsp72-exosomes
  (yellow circle). Hsp72-peptide complexes (Hsp72-pc) and Hsp72-exosomes (Hsp72-ex)
  make their way into the circulation and can be measured by classical sandwich ELISA.
  Antigen presenting cells bind and internalize Hsp72-pc and Hsp72-ex. Binding to
  specific receptors mediated a signal transduction cascade that results in the initiation
  of an immune response characterized by the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
  chemokines, nitric oxide and costimulatory molecules. Internalization of Hsp72-pc
  and Hsp72-ex allows the peptides to be processed and presented in the context of
  MHC class I to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). CTL's become activated and will recognize
  and destroy cells presenting the specific peptide. Circulating Hsp72-ex induces
  NK cells migration and the expression of Hsp72-pc on the surface of stressed cells
  activates NK lytic functions. Thirdly, stress in form of physical of psychological
  stress will stimulate the release of Hsp72-pc and Hsp72-ex into the circulation
  by a hitherto unknown mechanism and by a yet to be discovered tissue/organ.
