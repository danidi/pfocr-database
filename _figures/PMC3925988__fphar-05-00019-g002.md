caption: A schematic representation of the proposed neuroprotective mechanism of FtMt
  in AD (adapted from ; Antioxid Redox Signal). In the Aβ25–35-induced AD model, the
  overexpression of FtMt withdraws iron from the cytoplasmic pool, decreases LIP level,
  reduces oxidative damage through Erk/P38 kinase signaling, and prevents the release
  of cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. This in turn attenuates Aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity
  and decreases the cell apoptosis through the MAPK pathway.
