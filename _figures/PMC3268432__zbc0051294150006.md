caption: Model for the activation of GbpC. Extracellular cAMP binds to a G-protein-coupled
  receptor, cAR1, that stimulates a specific G-protein and Ras. A pathway downstream
  of Ras activation induces transient translocation of GbpC toward the membrane, which
  may be caused by either activation of the GRAM domain or formation of specific lipids
  in the membrane (blue). The produced cGMP induces an intramolecular signaling cascade
  involving GEF, Roc-COR, and activation of the kinase domain (red). The third activation
  signal comes from LRR, which are regulating substrate specificity (green). GbpC
  is only active when all three independent processes occur. Active GbpC phosphorylates
  so far unknown substrates at the cell cortex, which is important for myosin assembly
  into filaments and, subsequently, chemotaxis and cell streaming.
