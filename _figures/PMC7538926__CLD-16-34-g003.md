caption: Early figure demonstrating pathway of APAP metabolism. APAP (upper center)
  may be glucuronidated or sulfated most readily, but when these pathways are exhausted,
  the cytochrome pathway leads to N‐aminoparaquinoneimine (lower center) and its biochemical
  alternatives (mercapturic acid, left) and binding to cell proteins via S‐linkage
  (left) elucidated by Mitchell and Jollow in 1973 and amended with the identification
  of N‐aminoparaquinoneimine as the toxic intermediate bound to cell proteins elucidated
  by the Nelson group in their 1984 paper. Acetaminophen is readily disposed of by
  sulfation and glucuronidation (not shown here), with only a small (<5%) quantity
  being metabolized by CYP, unless the capacity of sulfation/glucuronidation is exceeded,
  leading to increased formation of N‐aminoparaquinoneimine. N‐aminoparaquinoneimine
  may be rapidly transformed to mercapturic acid (middle right) and excreted in urine
  as long as GSH is available. In the absence of GSH, N‐aminoparaquinoneimine binds
  to cell proteins containing sulfhydryl moieties, principally Cys. Repletion of GSH
  by NAC prevents the injury. Reproduced with permission from Drug Metabolism Reviews.
