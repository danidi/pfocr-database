caption: Thrombin-mediated activation of the cell-surface-expressed protease-activated
  receptor-1 (PAR-1) affects the MLC phosphorylation-state through multiple intracellular
  signaling pathways. The effector response of PAR-1 depends on the isoform of the
  G subunit (i.e. Gq/11 or G12/13) that is coupled to this G-protein-coupled receptor.
  These pathways include PKC-dependent signaling, IP-dependent  rise and activation
  of the -sensitization pathway via RhoA-ROCK signaling. Enhanced MLC-phosphorylation
  leads to increased actomyosin II dependent contractility and subsequently inhibition
  of Cx43 hemichannel opening. The findings in this study described that RhoA activation
  is essential to cause contractility-induced inhibition of the Cx43 hemichannel.
  References, included in the figure within italic brackets, indicate in which study
  we provide the supporting experimental data.
