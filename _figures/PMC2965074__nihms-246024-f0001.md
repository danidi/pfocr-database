caption: 'The NF-κB Signaling Pathway: This model depicts the major components of
  the classical NF-κB pathway. Engagement of a receptor by its ligand (e.g., TNF binding
  to TNFR) induces the formation of an adaptor protein complex containing adaptor
  and scaffolding proteins (e.g., TRAFs, MyD88, TIRAP) and kinases (e.g., RIP, IRAK).
  Assembly of these protein complexes facilitates the recruitment and activation of
  the IKK complex via NEMO and this in turn leads to the phosphorylation and ultimately
  ubiquitiniation and proteasomal degradation of IκB proteins (typified by IκBα).
  IκB degradation reveals a nuclear localization sequence on NF-κB proteins (e.g.,
  a p50-p65 heterodimer) allowing them to migrate to the nucleus, bind to specific
  κB-sites and regulate target gene transcription. The non-canonical NF-κB pathway
  follows a similar paradigm; however, the IκB is the C-terminus of NF-κB2/p100 and
  the resulting nuclear NF-κB species is a p52-RelB heterodimer. The non-canonical
  pathway does not require NEMO but is dependent upon IKKα and the upstream kinase
  NIK'
