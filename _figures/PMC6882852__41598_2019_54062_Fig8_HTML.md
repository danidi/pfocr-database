caption: Model of USMB-triggered enhancement of flotillin-dependent fluid-phase internalization.
  Shown is a diagram depicting ultrasound (US) and microbubble (MB) stimulation, which
  leads to activation of a signaling pathway involving Fyn and DHHC5, which in turn
  triggers an increase in flotillin-dependent internalization. This phenomenon elicits
  an enhancement of fluid-phase internalization, which leads to increased cellular
  uptake of hydrophilic drugs. In the case of genotoxic drugs such as cisplatin, USMB
  treatments lead to increased DNA damage and loss of cell viability.
