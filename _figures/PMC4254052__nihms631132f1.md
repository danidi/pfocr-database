  then binds to Argonaute (AGO2) protein and RNA inducing silencing complex (RISC)[].
  One strand of the siRNA duplex (the passenger strand) is removed by AGO2 resulting
  in RISC containing guide strand []. The activated RISC-siRNA binds to the complementary
  sequences on the mRNA and results in its cleavage and degradation []. Biogenesis
  of miRNA – The RNA polymerase II or III are responsible for the production of primary-miRNA’s
  (pri-miRNA) [, ]. In the nucleus, the resulting pri-miRNA’s are cleaved by the microprocessor
  complex Drosha []. The pre-miRNA is transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin 5(XPO5)
  and the loop structure is removed by the Dicer complex (Dicer – TAR binding protein)
  resulting in miRNA or miRNA duplexes [, ]. One strand of the duplex is incorporated
  into AGO2 and RISC which targets mRNA and results in its degradation[]. (Adapted
