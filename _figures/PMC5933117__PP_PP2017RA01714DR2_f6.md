caption: Model of rRNA biogenesis in rice. Primary transcripts generated by RNA Polymerase
  I are first processed at P in the 5′ ETS and at an unknown site in the 3′ ETS to
  generate 35S(P), which undergoes further pre-rRNA processing by alternative pathways
  distinguished by the order of ITS1 splitting and 5′ ETS removal, to generate mature
  18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNAs. In the major ITS1-first pathway, the 35SP transcript is
  split at ITS1 endonucleolytic site A3 into P-A3 and 27SA3 precursors. In the minor
  5′ ETS-first pathway, the removal of the 5′ ETS in the 35S(P) transcript occurs
  first to generate the 32S intermediate before its split at the ITS1 cleavage site
  A2. Both endo- and exonucleolytic processing occur sequential and coordinately in
  this progress. Precursors with partial transparency indicate putative intermediates
  in these pathways.
