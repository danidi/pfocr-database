caption: 'Phrenic long term facilitaion following acute intermittent hypoxia: schematic
  reperesentation of its cellular mechanisms and changes in relevant proteins following
  repetitive exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia. A. Acute intermittent hypoxia
  increases phrenic motor output, an effect referred to as pLTF (). AIH induces serotonin
  release in the vicinity of phrenic motor neurons, thereby activating 5HT-2 receptors
  and, via the PKC pathway, induces increased BDNF expression. BDNF subsequently activates
  its high affinity receptor, TrkB, possibly increasing the phosphorylation state
  and traffiking of glutamate receptors, thereby accounting for pLTF. This pathway
  is modulated by inhibitory constraints, including protein pohosphatases, which are
  in turn regulated (inhibited) by reactive oxygen species (ROS). B. Dailly acute
  intermittent hypoxia or thrice weekly AIH for 10 weeks enhances pLTF. In association,
  these treatments increase serotoninergic terminal density near phrenic motor neurons
  and, presumably, serotonin release in response to subsequent AIH. Subsequent aspects
  of this pathway are enhanced by repetitive acute intermittent hypoxia, including
  increased 5HT-2 receptor expression, increased BDNF synthesis and increased expression
  of TrkB. Figure adapted from .'
