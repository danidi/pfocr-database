caption: 'Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is recognized by glycosylated cell surface
  receptors of the host. This triggers internalization of the virus via clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis. AAV then traffics through the cytosol mediated by the cytoskeletal
  network. Owing to the somewhat low pH environment of the endosome, the VP1/VP2 region
  undergoes a conformational change. Following endosomal escape, AAV undergoes transport
  into the nucleus and uncoating. AAV can also undergo proteolysis by the proteasome.
  There are currently two classes of recombinant AAVs (rAAVs) in use: single-stranded
  AAV (ssAAV) and self-complementary AAV (scAAV). ssAAVs are packaged as either sense
  (plus-stranded) or anti-sense (minus-stranded) genomes. These single-stranded forms
  are still transcriptionally inert when they reach the nucleus and must be converted
  to double-stranded DNA as a prerequisite for transcription. This conversion can
  be achieved by second strand synthesis via host cell DNA polymerases or by strand
  annealing of the plus and minus strands that may coexist in the nucleus. Because
  scAAVs are already double-stranded by design, they can immediately undergo transcription.
  The viral inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) present in the rAAV genome can drive
  inter-molecular or intra-molecular recombination to form circularized episomal genomes
  that can persist in the nucleus. Vector genomes can also undergo integration into
  the host genome at very low frequencies, depicted by the dashed line ().'
