caption: SREBP-2 mediated activation of the entire pathway for cholesterol synthesis
  in mammalian cells. Key biosynthetic intermediates are highlighted in yellow. Red
  italics denotes the fold increase in mRNA levels for each enzyme in TgSREBP-2 liver.
  Each value is the average of the two microarray hybridizations listed in Tables  and
  . *, Desmosterol reductase was not represented on the microarray. The fold-increase
  value is from real-time PCR. †,17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-7 has not been confirmed
  as a cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme.
