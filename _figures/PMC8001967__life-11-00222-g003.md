caption: 'Mitochondrial regulation of ferroptosis. Mitochondria modulate ferroptotic
  cell death through multifaceted mechanisms. As the major compartment for cellular
  iron metabolism, mitochondria determine the ISC assembly and heme bio-synthesis,
  and thus dominate the enzymatic activities of numerous proteins containing ISC or
  heme. Mitochondria also govern cytosolic iron via ISC/IRPs or heme/HO-1 axis. The
  related mitochondrial proteins including mitoferrin, FXN, NFS1, SFXN2, FtMt, and
  CISDs thus modulate cellular iron metabolism and ferroptotic sensitivity. The mitochondrial
  glutaminolysis-TCA-ETC axis is other major pathway to determine ferroptotic cell
  death, during which the production of ROS, NADPH, and ATP regulates ferroptosis
  through distinct mechanisms. Mitochondrial GPX4/GSH also determines ferroptosis,
  which may be partially via modulating cardiolipin oxidation. mtDNA stress could
  activate the cGAS-STING pathway to facilitate autophagy mediated lipid peroxidation.
  Moreover, other mitochondria associate molecules also participate in ferroptosis
  regulation. Abbreviations: ACSF2, acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2; AMPK, adenosine
