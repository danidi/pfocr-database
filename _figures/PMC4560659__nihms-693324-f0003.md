caption: UVR8-mediated light signaling pathway in Arabidopsis. UV-B signaling begins
  with light-induced dimer dissociation. Monomeric UVR8 directly interacts with E3
  ubiquitin ligase COP1 to regulate transcription of genes involved in UV-B responses.
  In contrast to phytochromes (PHYs) and cryptochromes (CRYs), UVR8 acts as a positive
  regulator of the COP1 functions. RUP1/RUP2 are proteins that facilitate re-dimerization
  of UVR8.
