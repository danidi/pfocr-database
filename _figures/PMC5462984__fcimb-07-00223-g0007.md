caption: Model for CDT enhances radiosensitivity in PCa cells. Radiation-induced autophagy
  enhances radioresistance and leads to the activation of the survival pathway in
  DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells. A bacterial genotoxin CDT inhibits c-Myc and increase
  mTOR to impair autophagy induction, thereby rendering radioresistant PCa cells sensitive
  to radiation. This study elucidates the mechanisms by which CDT sensitizes radioresistance
  in PCa cells and provides a basis for its development as a target agent for the
  treatment of refractory PCa.
