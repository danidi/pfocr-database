caption: 'ER stress-induced inflammation in macrophages and ECs. Under ER stress conditions
  in macrophages and ECs, the three ER stress sensors, PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, can all
  activate the NF-κB pathway and induce specific inflammatory responses. In addition,
  IRE1 induces the elevation of TXNIP, thereby activating the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  which in turn promotes caspase-1 activation and IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and an
  inflammatory response. RIP1 may be involved in this activation process. Under ER
  stress, increased calcium release leads to increased intracellular production of
  ROS, which is partly attenuated by the PERK-mediated transcription factor Nrf2 antioxidant
  program, but increased ROS levels may still lead to inflammation, contribute to
  NLRP3 activation to some extent, and promote ER dysfunction. XBP1s and ATF4 induce
  the production of inflammatory cytokines IL-8, IL-6, MCP1, and TNF-α. These all
  lead to inflammation and are involved in the development of atherosclerosis. ERO1:
  endoplasmic reticulum oxidoreductin 1; IP3R1: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor
