caption: 'MUC1 modulates TNF‐α‐induced 16HBE cells necroptosis. MUC1‐CT binds RIPK1
  when it is released from an epithelial cell in response to TNF‐α. Then, it affects
  the phosphorylation of RIPK1 at Ser166. Upon activation, RIPK1 recruits RIPK3 to
  necrosome to initiate necroptosis. 16HBE: human bronchial epithelial; RIPK1: receptor‐interacting
  protein kinase‐1; RIPK3: receptor‐interacting protein kinase‐3; TNF‐α: tumor necrosis
  factor‐α [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]'
