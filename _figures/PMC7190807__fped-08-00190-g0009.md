caption: Hypothesis diagram of the regulatory mechanism of Twist1, Tie1, Tie2, Angs,
  and Akt/Foxo1 in endothelial cells. Twist1-Tie2-Akt/Foxo1 pathway combined to Angs
  signal may play an important role in hyperoxia-induced increase of pulmonary microvascular
  permeability. We hypothesize that hyperoxia impaired pulmonary vascular permeability
  may be associated with disruption of Ang1-Tie2 signaling and decreased Akt/Foxo1
  pathways that increase Ang2 production, and the Twist1 and Tie1 may be involved
  in the regulation of this process.
