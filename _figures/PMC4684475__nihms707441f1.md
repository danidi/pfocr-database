caption: NLRP3 senses PAMP and DAMP molecules leading to the recruitment of ASC and
  inflammasome assembly. The inflammasome mediates caspase cleavage, which facilitates
  the cleavage and activation of IL-18 and IL-1b which promote inflammation. Several
  druggable targets in this pathway have been established and have proven efficacious
  in an array of inflammatory diseases.
