caption: Unigenes predicted to be involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway.
  Red indicates genes with significantly increasing expressions in HAs compared with
  CK; green indicates genes with significantly decreasing expression; white indicates
  genes that were not identified in the expression profile analysis; blue indicates
  genes predicted to be involved in the pathway. HAs seedlings of Panax notoginseng
  stressed by arsenic (40 mg·L−1 Na2HAsO4·7H2O) for 14 days. CK seedlings for control
