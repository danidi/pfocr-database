caption: 'RNAi/miRNA pathway schematization and major challenges for naked siRNA delivery
  in vivo. (A) Schematization of RNA interference (RNAi): non-translated double-stranded
  RNA (dsRNA) molecules called small interfering RNA (siRNA), of exogenous or endogenous
  origin, post-transcriptional regulate gene-expression through a sequence specific
  degradation of target messenger RNA (mRNA). [1] Longer siRNA molecules (dark green)
  are cleaved by the nuclease Dicer and [2] incorporated into a multiprotein RNA-inducing
  silencing complex (RISC). [2] The duplex RNA is unwound leaving the anti-sense strand
  (light green). [3] to guide RISC to complementary mRNA (red) for subsequent endonucleolytic
  cleavage and gene silencing. [4] Short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) (violet) are sequences
  of RNA encoded by specific genes; they are introduced into the nucleus, transcribed
  and transported into the cytoplasm where they follow the same fate of siRNA. (B)
  miRNA processing: microRNA (blue) are considered as the “endogenous substrate” of
  the RNAi machinery. They are trascribed by RNA-Pol III in long primary transcripts
  (pri-miR), then processed within the nucleus into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by
  the RNase III enzyme Drosha-DGCR8. Pre-miRNA hairpins are exported from the nucleus
  in a process involving the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttle Exportin-5 (Exp.5). In cytoplasm,
  the pre-miRNA hairpin is cleaved by Dicer and loaded into RISC as for siRNA. miRNAs
  often share only partial complementarity with target mRNAs, usually in the 3′UTR,
  acting mainly as a translational repressors. (C) “Naked” siRNA pitfalls. In the
  box are reported the major obstacles for therapeutic efficacy of siRNA without modifications
  (“naked”). See text for details.'
