caption: Modulation of the NFE2L2 pathway in melanocytes. The expression of antioxidant
  enzymes in melanocytes is mediated by the NFE2L2 pathway whose activity can be enhanced
  due to the effects of ROS that mediated the release of NFE2L2 from its inhibitor
  KEAP1 or through the enhancement of its mRNA expression. Moreover, activated MAPK1
  or even α-MSH binding to its receptor MCR1 increases NFE2L2 activity where it is
  translocated to the nucleus to interact with MAF and express the enzymes. It should
  be noted that the activation of NFE2L2 necessitates its phosphorylation mainly by
  MAPK1.
