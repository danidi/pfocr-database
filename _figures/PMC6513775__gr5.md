caption: The possible site of action of A. calamus and/or its bioactive phytochemicals
  asarone (alpha (α)-and, beta (β)-asarone) in tumor cell metastasis, invasion, migration
  and angiogenesis. (A) The (β)-asarone decreases the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal
  transition (EMT) through upregulation of E-cadherin and down-regulation of vimentin
  or N-cadherin via inhibition of the expression of hnRNP A2/B1-mediated signaling
  pathway, thereby suggesting (β)-asarone may block the process of EMT process in
  cancerous cells. (B) Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in the hnRNP
  A2/B1-related cancer invasion, migration and metastasis. A. calamus and/or asarone
  suppresses the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, 9 and 14) and vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) thereby underlying the inhibitory effect on invasion,
  migration and metastasis. [Possible site of action of A. calamus and/or its bioactive
  phytochemicals asarone (alpha (α)-and, beta (β)-asarone) as observed in glioblastoma
  (U251 cells), colon cancer (LoVo cells), gastric cancer (SGC-7901, BGC-823 and MKN-28
  cells) and prostate cancer (LNCaP cells)].
