caption: Mechanisms of γδ T cells activation. Bisphosphonates (BP) and nitrogenous-BP
  (N-BP) block the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) enzyme in isoprenoid biosynthesis
  pathway in target cell or antigen presenting cells (APC) which leads to the accumulation
  of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and its metabolites. IPP and geranyl pyrophosphate
  (GPP) react with cytoplasmic tail of butyrophilin-3 subfamily molecules (e.g., BTN3A1)
  and stir a change which is detectable by γδ TCR. IPP metabolites can also be converted
  into an ATP analog (ApppI). ApppI can be presented at the cell surface and be recognized
  by the γδ TCR; however, the molecular mechanism of this process is not yet clear.
  Some of the known ligands for Vδ1 and Vδ2 T cells are shown here. Cell stress and
  bacterial pathogens induce expression of MHC class I chain-related protein A and
  protein B (MICA/MICB) molecules which react with NKG2D on Vδ1. MICA also binds to
  NKG2D on Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Several members of BTN family such as BTN3A1, BTN3A2, and
  BTN2A can bind to Vδ2 TCR and activate Vδ2 T cells. This activation is often via
  mechanisms involving multimerization of BTN molecules and exerting a synergistic
  effect. Moreover, UL16-binding protein (ULBP) which is a ligand for NKG2D receptor,
  as well as involvement of CD28 and 4-1BB receptors with their ligands provides additional
  costimulatory signals for γδ T cells.
