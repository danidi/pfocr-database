caption: Monomeric GSTP1 protects tumoral cells from apoptosis by inhibition of the
  JNK signaling pathway through the formation of a GSTP1-JNK-cJun complex that hampers
  c-Jun phosphorilation. Under stress conditions, GSTP1 may dissociate from the complex
  and dimerize, thus enabling JNK to phosphorilate c-Jun. This event may also be triggered
  by the GST inhibitor NBDHEX which binds GSTP1 and induces its release from the complex
