caption: 'sentences with expert curated information. Each rectangle depicts a single
  gene. Red indicates the gene is unregulated, blue downregulated. Arrows between
  two genes shows regulatory mechanisms: green indicates a transcription factor binding
  site match in the target promoter; open arrowhead indicates regulation; filled arrowhead
  indicates activation; blocked arrowhead indicates inhibition; blue dot on the edge
  indicates that the connection has been annotated by experts; A: Associations present
  between HIF1A and other genes at the expert level; B: Associations present between
  SMAD2 and other genes at the expert level. IN: gene is an input gene; TF: gene''s
  product is a transcription factor; ST: gene product is part of signal transduction
  pathway.'
