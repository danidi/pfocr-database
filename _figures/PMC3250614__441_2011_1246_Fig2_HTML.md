caption: TGF-β signal transduction pathway and targets for therapeutic intervention.
  TGF-β signals via heteromeric transmembrane complexes of type I and type II receptors
  (TβR) that are endowed with intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity (ALK activin
  receptor-like kinase). Upon type-II-mediated phosphorylation of the type I receptor,
  the activated type I receptor initiates intracellular signalling by phosphorylating
  receptor regulated (R)-Smad2 and Smad3. Activated R-Smads form heteromeric complexes
  with Smad4 and these complexes accumulate in the nucleus where they mediate transcriptional
  responses. Inhibitory Smad7 antagonises TGF-β/Smad signalling by competing with
  R-Smads for receptor interaction and by recruiting E3 ubiquitin ligases to the activated
  receptor complex and mediating its degradation. This pathway has been targeted by
  anti-sense molecules that inhibit TGF-β mRNA expression, by neutralising antibodies
  against TGF-β or TGF-β receptors that interfere with ligand-receptor interactions,
  by antibodies that interfere with the activation of latent TGF-β and by soluble
  extracellular domains of the type II receptor that sequester ligand binding to endogenous
  receptors and small ATP mimetics of TGF-β receptor kinases. Antagonising pathways,
  such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and epidermal growth
  factor (EGF), can inhibit TGF-β/Smad-induced responses by stimulating Smad7 expression
