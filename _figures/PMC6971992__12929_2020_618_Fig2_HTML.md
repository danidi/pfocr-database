caption: ZIKV-induced ER stress initiates host cell unfolded protein response (UPR).
  ZIKV infection induces ER stress due to the increased amount of unfolded/misfolded
  viral (red strand) and host cell (grey strand) protein aggregates in the ER lumen.
  The accumulation of these partially processed proteins leads to the overwhelming
  demand of correct protein folding. To facilitate protein folding, GRP78 (orange)
  dissociates from the stress sensors (IRE1, ATF6, and PERK) and binds to the misfolded/unfolded
  proteins. Expression of other chaperones is also elevated to address the overwhelming
  protein folding demand during ZIKV infection. Binding of misfolded protein to PERK
  (green) activates the sensor and triggers phosphorylation of eIF2⍺ that in turn
  stimulates 1) global translational block except for selective mRNA involved in UPR,
  and 2) formation of stress granules. However, ZIKV bypasses global translation block
  and inhibits stress granules formation, but the mechanistic details of these viral
  interference are still unclear. Activation of ATF6 (yellow) promotes the protein
  proteolytical processing in the Golgi apparatus into ATF6n, ATF6n nuclear translocation,
  and expression of UPR target genes including XBP1. Activated IRE1 (purple) splices
  XBP1 transcript which produces an active transcription factor (XBP1s) that stimulates
  expansion of the ER volume, and expression of CHOP and ERAD factors such as EDEM-1.
  Alternatively, IRE1 can trigger ASK1-p38 MAPK pathway that enhances CHOP apoptotic
  activities and promotes other apoptotic-related activities under severe ER stress
  condition. Blue pointed arrows denote activation, blue blunt-end arrows denote inhibition,
  and red pointed arrows denote increased expression/activity
