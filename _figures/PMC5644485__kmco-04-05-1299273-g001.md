caption: 'Mechanisms involved in p16 loss in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and
  potential therapeutic approaches to restore p16 expression. The diagram on the left
  depicts how low abundance of E6-associated protein (E6AP) promotes lung tumorigenesis
  by silencing p16 in a methylation-independent manner: in the context of low or lost
  expression of E6AP, E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) is free to stimulates cell
  division control protein 6 (CDC6) expression, which represses the INK4/ARF locus
  and contributes to p16 loss.'
