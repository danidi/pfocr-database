caption: A working model depicting that RILP interacts with RalGDS to inhibit Ral
  pathway. Normally, RalGDS activates RalA through interaction with Ras, and translocate
  the activated RalA to the plasma membrane (PM), this activation is required for
  RalA's activity for secretion and cell migration. The interaction of RalGDS with
  RILP will inhibit the activation of RalA, probably due to blockage of GEF activity
  of RalGDS by RILP, this inhibition results in the sequestering of RalGDS and/or
  RalA, and subsequently inhibits the cell migration and invasion of cancer cells
