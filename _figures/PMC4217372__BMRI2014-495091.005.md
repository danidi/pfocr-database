caption: Role of molecular chaperones in Alzheimer's disease. HSP90, HSP70, and other
  client proteins are directly involved in degradation of Aβ oligomers and phosphorylated
  tau containing microtubule and help them to degrade either proteasome pathway or
  through autophagy pathway. Failure to dephosphorylate by HSPs leads to formation
  of tau tangle, a hallmark of AD.
