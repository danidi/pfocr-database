caption: The complement system in AD. Binding of C1q and C3 to amyloid plaques can
  activate the classical and alternative pathways of complement system. No binding
  of MBL to amyloid plaques and activation of the lectin pathway has been reported.
  Activation of complement results in cleavage of C3 and C5 by specific enzymes (C3-
  and C5-convertases) followed by formation of membrane attack complex and cell lysis.
  Complement is regulated by soluble and membrane bound complement regulators shown
  in gray boxes.
