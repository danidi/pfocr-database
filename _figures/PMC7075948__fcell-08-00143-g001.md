caption: Interferon (IFN) signaling enhancement by the inhibition of the Wnt pathway
  through miR-34. TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) phosphorylation is firstly induced
  by the activation of the innate immunity in response to a viral infection (a). This
  is followed by the phosphorylation or homodimerization of the interferon regulatory
  factor 3 (IRF3) (b), which is subsequently translocated into the nucleus. Here,
  it stimulates the production of type I IFNs and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs)
  (c). At the same time, the viral infection or dsRNA treatments also activate the
  Wnt signaling pathway (d), which in turn leads to the inhibition of the Glycogen
  synthase kinase 3 beta (GS3Kβ) phosphorylation (e). This event suppresses the IFN
  pathway by interacting with TBK1 (f). This model shows that the Wnt signaling pathway
  has the ability to modulate the innate inflammatory response. By acting as an inhibitor
  of the Wnt pathway, miR-34 could enhance type I IFN signaling, therefore leading
  to a cellular antiviral status (g; ).
