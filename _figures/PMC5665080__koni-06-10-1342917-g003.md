caption: Inflammatory and immune responses to mevalonate pathway dysregulation. The
  responses induced by restricted flux have been studied using pharmacological inhibitors
  (statins and nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, N-BPs), caloric restriction mimetics
  (CRM) such as hydroxycitrate (see also ) or by genetic inactivation of geranylgeranyltransferase
  (GGTase), mevalonate kinase (MVK) or SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). Enhanced
  or uncontrolled flux can result from gain-of-function p53 mutation, sustained NFkB
  activation associated with chronic inflammation, ectopic expression of HMG-CoA reductase,
  or possibly also by futile metabolic constellations. Cell longevity resulting from
  sustained mevalonate metabolism and protein prenylation may physiologically be important
  for T cell memory establishment or pathologically manifest as malignant transformation.
  Among the various tools currently available for mevalonate pathway manipulation,
  N-BPs are unique, since they increase levels of IPP and simultaneously inhibit protein
  prenylation. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells, which are activated by increased levels of IPP and
  other mevalonate pathway intermediates, are intended to perform broad immune surveillance
  of enhanced mevalonate metabolism.
