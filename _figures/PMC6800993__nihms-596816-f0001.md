caption: The CD39/CD73 pathway modulates vascular inflammation and thrombosis in response
  to injury. Nucleotides released during cell activation/injury bind to P2 receptors
  to activate thrombo-inflammatory programs in the vasculature by binding to receptors
  on the endothelium, platelets and leukocytes. Endothelial and circulating leukocytes
  express the catabolic machinery to convert ATP/ADP into adenosine to quench the
  pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic signals and exert a potent, protective vascular
  effect. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP); adenosine diphosphate (ADP); adenosine monophosphoate
  (ADP).
