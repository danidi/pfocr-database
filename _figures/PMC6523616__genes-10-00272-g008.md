caption: A transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory system mediating the
  hepatic metabolic switch in chickens. A delayed feeding regime to retard the metabolic
  switch in broilers uncovered a complex transcriptional and post-transcriptional
  hepatic regulatory system which is triggered by nutritional/physiological cues to
  facilitate the metabolic transition in peri-hatch chickens. Red molecules have higher
  levels in broiler chicks with delayed access to feed for 48 h post-hatching compared
  to their fed from hatch counterparts and green molecules had lower levels in delayed
  fed chicks. Pathway was created using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
