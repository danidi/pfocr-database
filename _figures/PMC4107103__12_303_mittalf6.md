caption: 'A hypothetical model of molecular determinants of CLL cell survival, proliferation
  and migration in the PB, BM and LN microenvironments. Peripheral blood: CLL cells
  use different NF-κB– and MAPK-associated genes for survival and proliferation. PB-CLL
  cells express chemokine receptors, which stimulate PB-CLL migration to the LN or
  BM. Lymph nodes: CLL cells attract stromal cells to form a suitable microenvironment.
  Here, CLL cells undergo chronic activation via the BCR, BAFF/APRIL, NF-κB, MAPK
  and PI3K/Akt pathways, which leads to survival and proliferation. In addition, because
  of expression of a tolerogenic signature in LN-CLL, the immune cells are tolerogenic
  and unable to identify or kill CLL cells in LNs; Bone marrow: CLL cells attract
  stromal cells to form a suitable microenvironment. Here, CLL cells use different
  NF-κB and MAPK pathway genes for survival and proliferation.'
