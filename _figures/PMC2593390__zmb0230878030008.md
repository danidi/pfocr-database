caption: HAF and pVHL participate in two overlapping but distinct HIF-1α regulatory
  pathways. HAF regulates the basal levels of HIF-1α in an oxygen-independent pathway
  and degrades HIF-1α in normoxia and hypoxia, whereas pVHL maintains low HIF-1α levels
  only in normoxia in an oxygen-dependent pathway. Together the two parallel but complementary
  pathways determine the total levels of HIF-1α.
