caption: The proposed biosynthetic pathway of 1 based on isolated natural products
  and biochemical characterization of MycB. DFT analysis were performed on model substrates
  (1’–8’) of which the isobutyl group in 1–8 is replaced by a methyl group. Calculations
  were performed at the CPCM (water)/M06-2X/6-311+G(d,p)//M06-2X/6-31G(d) level of
  theory. The computed free energies of model compounds are shown in parenthesis.
  Calculations of stereoselectivity under uncatalyzed and catalyzed conditions are
  shown in the dash box.
