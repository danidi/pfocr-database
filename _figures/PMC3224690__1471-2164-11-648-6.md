caption: Functional network predicted from the genes expressed differentially during
  Cr (VI) stress in rice (For detail pathway please visit http://www.nbri.res.in/chromiumpathway/Cr_final.html).
  The rice variety IR-64 was germinated and allowed to grow for 5 d at 37°C and then
  transferred to Hewitt solution for growth. After 10 d of growth, seedlings of uniform
  size and growth were treated with 100 μM of Cr (VI) under standard physiological
  conditions. The microarray was performed using one-cycle target labeling and control
  reagents (Affymetrix, USA) using 5 μg RNA The hybridization data were analyzed using
  dCHIP software. The differentially expressed transcripts ranked by the magnitude
  of the moderated t-statistic determined from the statistical analysis were analyzed
  for cellular pathway and transcriptome interactions using the program Pathway Studio
  (Ariadne Genomics, USA). The pathway diagram was further filtered to show the proteins
  involved in cellular processes associated with the Cr response network.
