caption: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with mutations
  in one of two genes, PKD1 or PKD2, which encode polycystin-1 (PC1) and PC2, respectively.
  ADPKD is characterized by the presence of multiple cysts in the liver parenchyma
  that progressively dilate and grow. PC2-defective cholangiocytes are characterized
  by inappropriate production of cAMP and increased protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent
  activation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1)/ERK2 and subsequently
  mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)-increased
  production of cAMP is caused by changes in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. In PC2-defective
  cholangiocytes, store-operated Ca2+ entry is inhibited and cells respond to an acute
  reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ levels with stromal interacting molecule
  1 (STIM1)-dependent and adenylyl cyclase 5 (AC5)-dependent stimulation of cAMP production,
  which drives PKA-dependent activation of ERK1/ERK2. Defective PC2 also inhibits
  the interaction between STIM1 and Orai channels and maximizes the functional coupling
  of STIM1 to AC5, resulting in increased production of cAMP. PC2-defective cells
  respond to conditions that decrease ER Ca2+ levels and trigger oligomerization and
  membrane translocation of STIM1, with an overproduction of cAMP. In turn, cAMP activates
  the PKA–Ras–Raf–ERK pathway and stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
  production through an mTOR–HIF1α-mediated mechanism. VEGF produced by cystic cholangiocytes
  increases perivascular microvascular density and cholangiocyte proliferation through
  binding with VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Stimulation of mTOR through AKT, for example,
  by insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) ligand binding, can also activate
  ERK1/ERK2. Signalling molecules that are druggable are highlighted in bold and detailed
  in . PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; pmTOR, phosphorylated mTOR; pAKT, phosphorylated
  AKT.
