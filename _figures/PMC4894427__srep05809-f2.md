caption: Shaded nodes indicate metabolites showing a human-specific concentration,
  with undashed lines connecting compounds involved in the same metabolic reaction.
  Orange lines are connecting human-specific metabolites. The interaction network
  was generated using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) tool.
