caption: Hepatitis C virus entry into hepatocytes. ① Hepatitis C virus (HCV) LVP binds
  to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), which
  have high affinity with ApoE. SRBI plays an important role in both binding and post-binding
  steps through interaction with virion-associated lipoprotein or HCV E2. ② Binding
  of SRBI to HCV particles allows exposure of CD81 binding sites on HCV E2 and transfer
  of the virus particles to CD81. Upon interaction with HCV E2, CD81 activates Rho
  GTPase family members that promote actin remodeling, thus allowing the delivery
  of the E2-CD81 complex to come into contact with claudin-1 (CLDN1). Two RTKs, epidermal
  growth factor receptor (EGFR) and EphA2 facilitate the formation of the CD81-CLDN1
  complex by the EGFR-activated EGFR/Shc1/Grb2/HRas signaling pathway. The CD81-CLDN1
  association is also regulated by PKA in a cAMP-dependent manner to retain CLDN1
  on the plasma membrane. MKNK1 was recently identified as a host factor in HCV entry,
  which possibly acts to facilitate the downstream of EGFR. ③ The virion is primed
  by the low-pH fusion activity of CD81 and CLDN1 and translocates to the tight junctions
  in order to be endocytosed. Viral internalization is dependent on clathrin-mediated
  endocytosis. Junction protein occludin (OCLN) may contribute to this process. TfR1
  plays a role in HCV infection at the level of glycoprotein-mediated entry, acts
  after CD81, and possibly is involved in HCV particle internalization. PI3K-AKT and
  PI4K pathways are engaged in the late step of HCV entry. However the mechanisms
  are yet to investigated. ④ Following internalization, HCV fusion occurs in the early
  endosomes. Low pH environment and virion-associated cholesterol are required for
  the fusion process. NPC1L1 may play a role in the process by cholesterol transport.
  After fusion between the viral envelope and an endosomal membrane, the viral genome
  is released into the cytosol and replication take place.
