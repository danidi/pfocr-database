caption: Integrated view of Wnt pathway. All (present) genes associated with the Wnt
  pathway are denoted with by circular nodes and their fold-change values are represented
  by node color where red and green indicate higher and lower expression in ILD patient
  samples compared to controls, respectively. Bold-faced gene symbols indicate DEGs.
  Triangular nodes represent DEmiRNAs which have reciprocal expression fold-change
  values relative to their presumptive mRNA targets or that are predicted to be regulated
  by differentially expressed transcription factors (FDR<0.1, see Additional file
  ). The transcription factors used in construction of this regulatory network are
  shown as squares and their fold-changes were expressed by node border colors. Gray
  and black lines indicate protein-protein interactions and signaling information
  from the KEGG database, respectively. Red, blue and green lines with arrows represent
  predicted transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression and miRNA-mediated
  repression, respectively. Open circles represent transcription factors that were
  not used in prediction of regulatory interactions.
