caption: Cytokines secreted by monocyte subsets balance EC activation. Nonclassical/intermediate
  monocytes generate high levels of TNF once in proximity with EC, which causes upregulation
  of E-selectin expression at the EC surface. This in turn promotes secondary leukocyte
  recruitment. In normal inflammatory conditions, classical monocytes regulate the
  extent of nonclassical/intermediate monocyte–induced EC activation by secreting
  IL-6, which reduces surface expression of E-selectin via upregulation of SOCS3,
  a negative regulator of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. In disease, potential changes
  in classical and nonclassical/intermediate monocyte recruitment may alter the balanced
  control of inflammation mediated by the regulation mediated by both subsets. C,
  classical monocyte; NC/I, nonclassical/intermediate monocyte.
