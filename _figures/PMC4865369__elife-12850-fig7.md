caption: '(A) A candidate molecular pathway of action in which wntP-2 signals through
  ptk7 and fzd1/2/7 and Dvl-2 to suppress trunk identity within the anterior tail
  region. The FGFRL ndl-3 acts with the same sign as these components to suppress
  trunk regionalization and could act in a parallel pathway or modify the activity
  of the pathway through an unknown mechanism. wntP-2 and ptk7 can inhibit ndl-3 expression
  in the posterior of regenerating tail fragments and intact animals and ndl-3 promotes
  wntP-2 expression in regenerating tail fragments, suggesting the potential for feedback
  regulation within this pathway (not shown). β-catenin-1 signaling is required upstream
  for expression of ptk7, wntP-2 and ndl-3 (not shown). (B) Model relating expression
  of pathway components to patterning functions. The highest region of expression
  co-expression of wntP-2 and ptk7 occurs in the anterior tail and trunk at a location
  where these genes prevent trunk fates in animals undergoing tissue homeostatic maintenance
  and in regenerating trunk fragments that form new tail tissues. By contrast, regenerating
  head fragments lack abundant co-expression of wntP-2 and ptk7, which we suggest
  is important for enabling the normal formation of trunk regional identity and regeneration
  of associated structures. Regenerating tail fragments would initially possess high
  levels of wntP-2 and ptk7 predicted to suppress trunk identity, but undergo a regeneration
  expression regulatory program that reduces wntP-2 mRNA in this region, enabling
  trunk regeneration at a position that we suggest could be defined by a particular
  A-P location of ptk7 and wntP-2 activity present at an appropriate time in regeneration.
  According to this model, wntP-2/ptk7 signaling provides information about the presence/absence
  of the trunk region used to control regeneration outcomes.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12850.023'
