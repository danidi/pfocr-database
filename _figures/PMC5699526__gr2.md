caption: Engineered metabolic pathway for D-LA production by S. pombe. Six genes (gut2,
  pdc101, pdc202, l-ldh, adh8, adh SPBC337.11, shown in blue) were disrupted and three
  genes (d-ldh, eutE, mhpF, shown in red) were introduced. gut2, glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; l-ldh, l-lactate dehydrogenase; pdc101, pyruvate decarboxylase (SPAC1F8.07c);
  pdc202, pyruvate decarboxylase (SPAC13A11.06); adh8, alcohol dehydrogenase (SPBC1773.06c);
  eutE, ethanolamine utilization protein from E. coli; mhpF, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase
  from E. coli; d-ldh, d-lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB
  8826; BGL, beta-glucosidase from Aspergillus aculeatus. (For interpretation of the
  references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version
