caption: The coagulation cascade is a sophisticated regulatory network controlling
  the formation of fibrin fiber. Tissue factor triggers coagulation under vessel damage,
  whereas factor XII induces supplementary contact activation intrinsic pathway. HK
  – high molecular weight kininogen, PL – phospholipid surface, TM – thrombomodulin,
  APC – activated protein C, TFPI – tissue factor pathway inhibitor. The scheme is
  derived from a diagram from Enzyme Research Laboratories .
