caption: '. Hypothetical consequences of insulin deficiency and activation of the
  renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) cholesterol
  pathways. Figure illustrates how insulin deficiency and activation of the RAS and
  IGF-1-cholesterol pathways might explain the link between type 2 diabetes mellitus
  and an increased risk of cancer. The possible benefits of insulin, statins and RAS
  inhibitors in reducing the risk of cancer in individuals with different subphenotypes:
  low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels <2.8 mmol/L+triglyceride levels
  <1.7 mmol/L for those with upregulated IGF-1-cholesterol pathway; and LDL-C levels
  <2.8 mmol/L+albuminuria for those with hyperglycaemia-activated RAS pathway are
  shown. Double-headed arrow indicates crosstalk between pathways. Dashed arrow indicates
  pathway without supporting mechanistic evidence. Reprinted from Yang et al., with
