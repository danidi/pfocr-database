caption: 'Glutamate release from the Schaffer collaterals releases glutamate, which
  can activate NMDA and AMPA receptors on the postsynaptic spine (1) of a pyramidal
  neuron and also NMDA and AMPA receptors on nearby astrocytic processes (4). By some
  means, yet to be elucidated, this activation of glutamate receptors increases the
  metabolic load on the neuron and leads to an increase in intracellular adenosine
  (2), which is then rapidly transported out of the cell by the ENTs (3). In parallel
  with this, the activation of glutamate receptors on the astrocyte (4) leads to an
  increase in intracellular Ca2+ and increased exocytosis of ATP-containing vesicles
  (5). Once in the extracellular space, ATP is broken down to adenosine (6). Extracellular
  adenosine can be taken up into astrocytes via ENTs (7) as the astrocytes maintain
  very low intracellular adenosine levels as a consequence of the activity of adenosine
  kinase (ADK), which converts adenosine to AMP (8). The two parallel pathways have
  differing kinetics: the neuronal pathway of direct release (1–3) has rapid kinetics,
  while those of the indirect astrocytic pathway (4–6) are slower.'
