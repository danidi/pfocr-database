number: Figure 5
caption: (A) Following Eiger binding to Wengen a signaling complex consisting of dTRAF2-dTAB2-dTAK1
  is stabilized, which allows dTAK1 activation. Subsequently dTAK1 activates both
  Mkk4 and Hemipterous/Mkk7, which act non redundantly to activate Bsk/JNK. (B) Following
  Peptidoglycan recognition PGRP-LC recruits the scaffold protein IMD, which activates
  by a yet unknown mechanism the dTAB2-dTAK1 complex. dTAK1 subsequently activates
  directly the IKK complex and both Mkk4 and Hemipterous/Mkk7 which act non redundantly
  to activate Bsk/JNK.
