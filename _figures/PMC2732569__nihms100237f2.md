caption: This proposed model for the life cycle of a mitochondrion reflects mitochondrial
  dynamics and turnover (adapted from ()). In a healthy cell, the antagonizing events
  of mitochondrial fusion and fission are dependent upon mitochondrial membrane potential.
  Following a mitochondrial fission event, fragmented mitochondria may either maintain
  an intact membrane potential (green line) or depolarize (red line). Should mitochondrial
  membrane depolarization take place prior to fission, it is unlikely to proceed to
  fusion without repolarization. Consequences of depolarization include the production
  of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased cytosolic [Ca2+] or loss of ATP with
  subsequent effects on various types of cell death and/or impaired mitochondrial
  transport and trafficking. PINK1 lies upstream of parkin in a conserved genetic
  pathway as indicated. Exactly how this relates to mitochondrial morphology is unclear,
  but we suggest here that the major effect of PINK1/parkin might be on the turnover
  of damaged mitochondria and thus may be tangential to the fusion/fission machinery.
