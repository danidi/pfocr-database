caption: IL-2 mediated JAK-STAT signaling pathway in COVID-19 associated male infertility.This
  figure shows IL-4 JAK-STAT Pathway and their effect on male infertility, during
  the event of infection by SARS-CoV-2. The entry of SARS-CoV2 will lead to the supposed
  activation of B-cells and these wills up-regulate the Th2 cells. The Th2 cell alters
  the level of IL-4. The IL-4 alteration leads to STAT6 or STAT 3 being stimulated
  and dimer formation is seen. These dimers translocate to the nucleus and undergo
  transcription. Genes like CD36, 15 LO, and MAOA are seen to get expressed. IL-4
  alteration causes the deregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. In the case of
  the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, it will result in male inflammation.
  Here, it is hypothesized that infection by SARS-CoV-2 will cause a down-regulation
  of IL-4, which is anti-inflammatory. This will cause a down-regulation of STAT6
  or STAT3 (indicated by red dotted arrow). This will up-regulate the levels of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and cause male infertility. Overall, the deregulation of the IL-4 level
  alters the pathway involved in the STAT and causes male infertility upon COVID-19
  infection. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
