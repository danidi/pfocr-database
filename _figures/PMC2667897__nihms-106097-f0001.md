caption: TGFβ/Smad superfamily signal strength is regulated and modulated at several
  different levels, both intrinsically and through cross-talk with other signaling
  pathways. R-Smads and co-Smads continuously shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus.
  Following TGFβ ligand-mediated engagement of the type II/type I receptor complex
  and R-Smad activation, C-terminally phosphorylated R-Smads are preferentially retained
  in the nucleus, where they initiate a specific transcription program. Signal termination
  at the level of receptors results in rapid dephosphorylation of activated R-Smads
  in the nucleus by the nuclear phosphatase, PPM1A. In addition, cells adapt to their
  persistent exposure to TGFβ ligands by eliminating activated R-Smads by proteasomal
  degradation. This adaptive response may be mediated by TGFβ-initiated non-Smad-dependent
  activation of MAP kinase pathways, which phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues
  in the Smad linker regions. These phosphorylation events appear to trigger proteasomal
  degradation and prevent nuclear transport of activated R-Smads, and are turned off
  by SCP-type phosphatases. Similar mechanisms centered on R-Smad linker regions appear
  to be utilized by mitogenic and stress stimuli to counterbalance the effects of
  TGFβ signals. Conversely, MAP kinase-mediated N-terminal phosphorylation of p53
  enables its interaction with activated R-Smads, thereby enhancing their cytostatic
  functions. This pathway may serve as a negative feed-forward loop to counterbalance
  excessive mitogenic signaling.
