caption: Summary of the most reproducible deficiencies in the oxidative phosphorylation
  system (OXPHOS) and its related cellular signaling in schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar
  disorder (BD). (A) The most frequent single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported
  in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (nDNA and mtDNA, respectively) encoded subunits
  of complex I. (B) Increase and decrease in the expression of various subunits of
  the OXPHOS complexes. (C) Reduced and enhanced enzymatic activity of 3 complexes
  of the OXPHOS. (D) The respiratory chain complexes, electron transfer, and adenosine
  triphosphate (ATP) production. (E) The mitochondrial cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA)
  signaling pathway, which affects the expression of mtDNA encoded subunits of the
  OXPHOS complexes. (F) Altered glutamate NMDA receptor transmission and intracellular
  Ca2+ concentration and signaling. (G) Alterations in mitochondrial originated high-energy
  phosphates, lactate, and pH, indicating impaired energy production in cell or tissue.
  (H) Disease-related neurodevelopmental consequences of the alterations presented
  in A to G. Arrows indicate the direction of alteration. PCr, phosphocreatine.
