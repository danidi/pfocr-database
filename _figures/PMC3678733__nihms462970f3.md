caption: Visualization of curated components of pathways and inferred interacting
  proteins and small molecules. A. A diagram of the Hippo/STK signaling pathway as
  annotated in Reactome, using SBGN-like iconography to display proteins and complexes
  (rectangles) and small molecules (ovals), connected by reaction edges that distinguish
  inputs (plain end), outputs (arrowhead end) and catalysis (open-circle end) as well
  as reaction type (open box reaction node, chemical transformation; closed circle,
  binding). B. A portion of the manually annotated pathway is enlarged and overlaid
  with proteins found in high-throughput surveys () to interact with Hippo pathway
  components STK3 (MST2) or STK4 (MST1) or both. C) The manually annotated pathway
  is overlaid with small molecules from the ChEMBL database () that bind STK3 (MST2)
  or STK4 (MST1) or both.
