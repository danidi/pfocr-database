caption: A proposed mechanism of the differential actions of arecoline on cell growth
  among RWPE-1 (A), PC-3 (B), and LNCaP (C) cells. The arecoline signaling was dependent
  on the cell cycle-controlling protein pathway, such as CDK1, CDK4, p21, p27, cyclin
  B1, or cyclin D3 proteins, in the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent way. Thus,
  arecoline arrested RWPE-1 and PC-3 cells at the G2/M phase and LNCaP cells at the
  G0/G1 phase, leading to growth inhibition of all cells. The symbols of “→” and “┤”
  were presented with either stimulatory or inhibitory effect of arecoline on protein
  expression.
