caption: LPA and S1P activate specific G-protein-coupled receptors (LPA1–4 and S1P1–5,
  respectively) and initiate Ras/ERK, PI3K/Akt, and Rho/ROCK signaling pathways in
  microvessel endothelial cells. Results presented here have demonstrated that both
  Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt signaling is mediated by a Gi-dependent pathway while Rho signaling
  occurs through an alternate G-protein, possibly G12/13 or Gq as has been shown in
  previous studies (–). In addition, Gi-dependent activation of Ras/ERK and PI3K/Akt
  occur through independent pathways and are unaffected by inhibition of Rho signaling.
  These results are further supported by the finding that anastellin suppresses Ras
  activation by LPA and prevents ERK activation without affecting PI3K/Akt or Rho/ROCK
  signaling. The dashed line linking S1P receptors to G12/13 indicates that a weak
  induction by S1P was observed in MVECs.
