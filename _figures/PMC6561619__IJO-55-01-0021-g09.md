caption: Model of the molecular mechanisms involved in LRRK2 gene silencing in proliferation,
  migration, and apoptosis in TC cells. LRRK2 is upregulated with inhibition of the
  JNK pathway in TC cells. Downregulated LRRK2 exerts its inactivation effect on the
  JNK signaling pathway, successively promoting cell growth and enhancing apoptosis
  and cell cycle arrest in TC cells. LRRK2, leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; TC, thyroid
  cancer; JNK, p-JNK, phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase; c-JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase;
  MMP-9, matrix metalloproteinase-9; CDK4, cyclin-dependent kinase 4; Bcl-2, B-cell
  lymphoma-2; Bax, Bcl-2-associated X.
