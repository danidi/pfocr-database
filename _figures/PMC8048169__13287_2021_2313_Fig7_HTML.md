caption: Graphical summary of the investigated signaling pathways during osteogenic
  differentiation of DFCs. The osteogenic differentiation in DFCs can be induced by
  dexamethasone or BMP2. Induction by dexamethasone leads to downregulation of classical
  PKCs, while induction by BMP2 inhibits both classical PKCs and Akt. Activity of
  classical PKCs is sustained by PTHrP and can be inhibited by Wnt5a. In osteogenic
  differentiating cells, classical PKCs inhibit the activity of Akt, while Akt was
  shown to inhibit the NF-κB pathway and sustain the activity of β-catenin by phosphorylation
  and thereby inhibition of GSK3β. Classical PKCs stimulate the NF-κB pathway. Eventually,
  the transcription factors NF-κB and β-catenin modulate the osteogenic differentiation
  of DFCs. Furthermore, the BMP2/Smad signaling pathway, which is pivotal for BMP2-induced
  osteogenic induction, is disturbed by Akt
