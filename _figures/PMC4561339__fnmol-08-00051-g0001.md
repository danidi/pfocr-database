caption: 'A schematic diagram of the protein components involved in the myelin protein-derived
  inhibition of neurite growth. The oligodendrocyte derived proteins released from
  the cell membrane following injury include MAG, Nogo-A (Nogo-66), Oligodendrocyte
  myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) and Amino-Nogo. The multicomponent cell surface receptor
  complexes that are localized to the neuronal cell membrane include the Nogo Receptor
  1 (NgR1), Lingo-1, p75NTR, and TROY, all of which signal to change the activation
  of Rho (active Rho is indicated by RhoA-GTP). The PirB receptor also binds the myelin-derived
  inhibitory molecules but its absolute signaling pathway remains unclear. The C3
  transferase enzyme, isolated from Clostridial species, is known to block these Rho
  activation pathways and to allow for neurite outgrowth in the face of myelin-derived
  protein inhibition. (Adapted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd: J. Cereb.
