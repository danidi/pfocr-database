caption: The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator. (A) ARNT interconnects
  the HIF and AhR pathway. Under sufficient oxygen supply (normoxia), HIF-1α is hydroxylated
  at two conserved proline residues within its oxygen-dependent degradation domain
  (ODD) by prolylhydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes. This posttranslational modification
  is recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein leading to
  ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of HIF-1α. Asparaginyl hydroxylation
  residue within the C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of HIF-1α catalyzed by
  factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) prevents the recruitment of cofactors required for target
  gene expression. Hypoxia inhibits both PHD and FIH, thus leading to HIF-1α accumulation
  and nuclear translocation. Heterodimerization of HIF-1α and ARNT is mediated by
  PAS domains. Subsequently, the HIF-1α/ARNT complex (HIF-1) initiates target gene
  expression in conjunction with cofactors (that is, CBP/p300; not shown) (). By contrast,
  the AhR pathway is activated by environmental pollutants (for example, dioxin exposure),
  leading to nuclear translocation of AhR. Subsequently, AhR/ARNT complexes initiate
  the expression of target genes such as monooxygenases (). ARNT is regarded as constitutively
  expressed but can be upregulated in response to hypoxia in a cell-specific manner
  (dotted arrow; see text for details). HRE, hypoxia responsive element; NPC, nuclear
  pore complex; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; XRE, xenobiotic responsive
  element. (B) Proposed concept of hypoxia-dependent upregulation of ARNT and associated
  research questions.
