caption: 'Proposed signaling pathway. Schistosoma antigens trigger the release of
  interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 by early-responding leukocytes in the periegg granuloma,
  including dendritic cells, type 2 helper T (CD4+ Th2) cells, macrophages, and basophils.
  The IL-4 is received by the two IL-4 receptors: receptor 1 consists of the IL-4Rα
  protein and the common γ-chain protein, and receptor 2 consists of the IL-4Rα protein
  and the IL-13Rα1 protein. The IL-13 is received by the two IL-13 receptors: the
  first is the same as the IL-4 type 2 receptor, and the second is IL-13Rα2, which
  is thought to be a decoy (nonsignaling) receptor. Potential cells receiving the
  IL-4 and IL-13 stimulus includes macrophages, eosinophils, and pulmonary vascular
  cells. These cells, in turn, release transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), which
  leads to pulmonary vascular remodeling in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle and endothelial
  cells. IL-6 signaling, via the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and phospho-STAT3 and not regulated
  by IL-4/IL-13, has a suppressive effect on pulmonary hypertension due to Schistosoma
  exposure. Solid lines indicate relatively direct effects, and dashed lines indicate
  relatively indirect effects.'
