caption: 'Schematic depicting the major proinflammatory glial-mediated changes to
  inhibitory synapses within the spinal dorsal horn that facilitate central sensitization.
  As mentioned in , prolonged stimulation of astrocytes and microglia can lead to
  the increased synthesis and release of various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
  Within inhibitory synapses of the spinal cord dorsal horn, the effects of these
  mediators ultimately lead to a reduction in inhibitory neurotransmission (‘disinhibition''),
  which further facilitates central sensitization. For example: (1) IL-1β can mediate
  a decrease in the astrocytic uptake of glutamate, via a PKC-mediated suppression
  of glutamate transporter GLT-1. (2) The reduced uptake of glutamate via GLT-1 leads
  to decreased availability of glutamine for GABA synthesis. (3) IL-1β and IL-6 inhibit
  presynaptic GABA and glycine currents. (4) Last, IL-1β, PGE2, CCL2, TNFα and IFNγ
  decrease GABA and glycine receptor activity; in the case of IL-1β, this is thought
  to be mediated via a PKC-dependent pathway. IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin; PKC,
  protein kinase C; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α.'
