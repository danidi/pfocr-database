caption: A model for the action of DA synthesis pathway genes. In wild-type cells
  (middle), the surface level of Btl/FGFR is modulated by endocytosis via the action
  of Shi/dynamin, while the stability of Shi/dynamin is regulated by DA, presumably
  through a DA-receptor mediated signaling event. In Pu or ple mutants (right), or
  when DA synthesis is blocked by 3-IT, Shi/dynamin level is reduced, resulting in
  over-accumulation of Btl/FGFR and ectopic migration. In Catsup mutants, or in the
  presence of exogenously added DA, the level of Shi/dynamin is increased, resulting
  in down-regulation of surface Btl/FGFR and reduced migration.
