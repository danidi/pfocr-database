  The early protection response to respiratory viruses includes mucus, surfactants
  and antiviral peptides that can prevent initial attachment and viral entry. Respiratory
  viruses enter via the respiratory epithelium. Epithelial cells have a key role in
  initiating the immune response by recognising viral components (pathogen-associated
  molecular patterns (PAMPs)) via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and intracellular receptors.
  These cellular sensors trigger a signalling cascade resulting in the upregulation
  of type I and III interferon (IFN) and the inflammatory response. This leads to
  differentiation of dendritic cells that mediate the induction of the adaptive immunity
  and promote the recruitment of innate immunity cells, in particular neutrophils
  and natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells have the ability to kill virus-infected
  cells via perforin–granzyme-dependent mechanisms or by the Fas–Fas ligand pathway.
  Moreover, alveolar macrophages, recruited monocytes and macrophages as well as dendritic
  cells pick pathogen components and contribute to the immune response. All of these
  cells produce cytokines and chemokines that are important for the establishment
  of the adaptive responses and of the antiviral state. The adaptive response to respiratory
  viruses is mediated by both T- and B-cell compartments. T-cells contribute to the
  generation of the B-cell response. B-cells produce antibodies that may neutralise
  the respiratory viruses directly by binding to viral surface proteins that are essential
  for entry of the virus into host cells or through the ligation of Fc receptors to
  trigger the complement cascade and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
  Antibodies are in the form of IgA, mainly in the upper respiratory tract, or IgG,
  in the lower respiratory tract. Viral clearance is also mediated by CD8+-specific
  T-cells with cytolytic activity. The protective antiviral T-cell response is mainly
  mediated by IFN-γ production and is therefore biased toward a T-helper cell (Th)
  1 response, whereas other T-cell subsets such as Th2 cells and Th17 cells play a
  minor role and they may be responsible for lung tissue damage. Moreover, regulatory
  mechanisms adopted by T-cells such as interleukin (IL)-10 secretion, or upregulation
  of inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or expansion
  of the T-regulatory (Treg) cell subsets, work to balance tissue damage and viral
  clearance. TNF: tumour necrosis factor; CTL: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte; TFH: T-follicular
  helper; TGF: transforming growth factor.'
