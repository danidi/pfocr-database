caption: Ceramide (CER) synthesis and degradation pathways. De novo synthesis includes
  the condensation of serine and palmitoyl‐CoA through the action of serine palmitoyltransferase
  (SPT). The product of this reaction, 3‐ketosphinganine, is reduced to sphinganine
  (SFA) by 3‐ketosphinganine reductase. SFA can be further converted into sphinganine‐1‐phosphate
  (SFA1P) by SFA kinase or can be acylated into dihydroceramide in a reaction catalyzed
  by ceramide synthases (CERS). Subsequently, dihydroceramide desaturase (DES) reduces
  dihydroceramide (N‐acylsphinganine) to CER. Moreover, CER can be generated through
  the hydrolysis of membrane and lysosomal sphingomyelin (SM) via alkaline/neutral
  and acidic sphingomyelinases (SMase), respectively. Additionally, the salvage pathway
  allows CER formation from sphingosine (SFO) and sphingosine‐1‐phosphate (S1P). These
  reactions can be reversed by ceramidase and SFO kinase (SphK). Irreversible degradation
  of S1P occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum via the action of S1P‐lyase [Color figure
