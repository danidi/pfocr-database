caption: Probable mechanism of antiobesity activity of mistletoe. LPL converts triacylglycerides
  into free fatty acids. Free fatty acids are moved into the cell and activated to
  acyl-CoA. CPT1 converts acyl-CoA to acylcarnitine, which is transported into the
  mitochondria by CAT. CPT2 converts acylcarnitine back to acyl-CoA, and then acyl-CoA
  enters β-oxidation pathway. Acetyl-CoA goes into TCA cycle. Citrate exits mitochondria
  and is converted to acetyl-CoA, which is carboxylated to malonyl-CoA by ACC. FAS
  undergoes the reductive synthesis of palmitate which is converted to palmitiyl-CoA
  leading to formation of triacylogliceryes. Additionally, malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT-1.
  Mistletoe decreases expression of FAS, ACC, ACS and LPL and decreases SREBP-1c,
  C/EBP-α, and PPAR-γ mRNA expression
