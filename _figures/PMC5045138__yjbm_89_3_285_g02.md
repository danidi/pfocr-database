caption: During homeostatic conditions, the Keap1 proteins binds with the nuclear
  factor Nrf2, inhibiting its translocation to the nucleus and the induction of the
  transcription of Nrf2-dependent reading frames. Lactobacilli-induced ROS generation
  causes the oxidation of cysteine residues within Keap1, which results in conformation
  change of Keap1 and the release of its inhibitory acuity on Nrf2. Nrf2 is then free
  to translocate into the nucleus where it binds to a DNA site known as an anti-oxidant
  response promoter elements. Nrf2 binding to these sites eventuates in the expression
  of a battery of phase II detoxifying genes that function in cytoprotection. The
  gene products from this regulon function to protect proteins in the cytosol from
  excessive ROS induced oxidation, thereby promoting cell survival, especially in
  circumstances of simultaneous exogenous oxidative insults. Future studies will focus
  on identifying the potencies of candidate probiotic bacteria for their capacities
  to stimulate cytoprotective Nrf2 pathway signaling.
