caption: Diagrammatic representation of the signaling in abiotic stress and microtubule
  responses. (A) N-MYC DOWNREGULATED GENE (NDRG1) knock-down human mammary epithelial
  cells (hNMECs) shows decrease in tubulin acetylation as compared to cells having
  wild type levels of NDRG1(). (B) Abiotic stress activates G-protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCRs; ), phospholipase-Dα1 (PLDα1) interacts with activated Gα subunit (); PLD
  hydrolyzes membrane lipids to generate phosphatidic acid (PA). PA binds to MAP65-1,
  resulting into microtubule bundling and polymerization which helps in salt tolerance
  () it also activates MPK6, which further phosphorylates SOS1 resulting into activation
  of SOS pathway (). PA may interact with NDL1, interactor of Gβγ dimer and possible
  downstream regulator of microtubules. ABA production during cold and drought stress
  results into steeply oblique and disrupted microtubules, respectively, (; ). Solid
  lines depicts confirmed interactions, dotted line depicts hypothesized interactions
