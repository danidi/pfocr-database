caption: Recent reports have suggested that the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is activated
  in lesional psoriatic skin (; ; ; ), and that pharmacological inhibition of this
  pathway using cyclopamine may lead to rapid resolution of the disease (; ; ). The
  Hh signaling pathway is one of the major signaling pathways involved in embryonic
  development (). During physiologic Hh signaling, Hh proteins bind to the cell surface
  receptor Patched (PTCH1), thereby releasing Smoothened (SMO) from PTCH-mediated
  inhibition. SMO activation then triggers a series of intracellular events, culminating
  in alterations in gene expression mediated by the Gli family of transcription factors
  (GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3) () (). The transcripts for PTCH1 and GLI1 are reliable markers
  for both physiologic and pathologic Hh signaling activity as they are consistently
  induced when the Hh pathway is activated (; ). This pathway has been shown to be
  a crucial regulator of hair follicle growth and sebaceous gland biology (; ). On
  the other hand, sustained activation of the Hh pathway appears to be the driving
  force for BCC development ().
