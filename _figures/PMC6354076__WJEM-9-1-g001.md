caption: 'Sirtuins and metabolism. SIRTs are metabolic sensors that modulate a variety
  of metabolic pathways, including glycolysis (Warburg effect), gluconeogenesis, fatty
  acid oxidation, glutaminolysis, TCA cycle and OXPHOS. SIRTs 1, 3 and 6 restrain
  the glycolytic pathway through HIF-1α inhibition or direct effects. SIRT3 upregulates
  OXPHOS pathway by enhancing the activity of the mitochondrial complexes I, II and
  III and dampening ROS production. SIRT1 is also able to increase the fatty acid
  oxidation by activating PPAR-α and PGC1-α, while SIRT3 upregulates the fatty acid
  oxidation upon caloric restriction conditions. SIRT2 induces gluconeogenesis. SIRT3
  and 4 activates and inhibits, respectively, the glutaminolysis by regulating the
  GDH activity. SIRT5 increases glycolysis by increasing the activity of the GAPDH
  enzyme. SIRT7 can also repress HIF-1α and therefore inhibit transcription of glycolytic
  genes. At last, SIRT1 performs a positive feedback loop with AMPK, since AMPK rises
  NAD+ levels in cells, which in turn enhances SIRT1 activity and lastly leads to
  AMPK activation. AMPK suppresses glycolysis via mTORC1 inhibition and promotes fatty
  acid oxidation. In the Figure, SIRTs are represented based on their functions only
  and not by localization. AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; GAPDH: Glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GDH: Glutamate dehydrogenase enzyme; HIF-1α: Hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1-alpha; mTORC1: Target of rapamycin complex 1; NAD+: Nicotinamide adenine
  dinucleotide; OXPHOS: Oxidative phosphorylation; PGC1-α: Proliferator-activated
  receptor γ coactivator-1α; PPAR-α: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha;
  ROS: Reactive oxygen species; SIRTs: Sirtuins; TCA: Tricarboxylic acid.'
