caption: Ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin–independent selective autophagy. On the
  left, a prototypical selective autophagy receptor with an ubiquitin-binding domain
  (UBD) recognizes an ubiquitylated substrate (protein aggregate) and physically links
  the aggregate to the autophagosome via a LIR motif that binds to lipidated and autophagosome
  membrane associated ATG8 (LC3-II). On the right, FAM134B-mediated endoplasmic reticulum-phagy
  (ER-phagy), a ubiquitin-independent selective autophagy pathway is depicted. Here,
  FAM134B is an ER-membrane protein with a LIR motif that is recognized by autophagosome
  associated LC3-II in order to deliver predominantly cisternal ER to autophagosomes
  for degradation.
