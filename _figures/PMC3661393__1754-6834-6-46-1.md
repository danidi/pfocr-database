caption: Phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways. The grey box represents
  the phenylpropanoid and monolignol biosynthetic pathways that are generally accepted
  for angiosperms with indication of the 20 mutant alleles studied (in red). The general
  phenylpropanoid pathway starts with PAL and ends with CCoAOMT, whereas the monolignol-specific
  biosynthesis starts with CCR.
