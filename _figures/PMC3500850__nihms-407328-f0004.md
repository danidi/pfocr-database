caption: 'Metabolites and genes that are upregulated in induced E+R+ lung tissue vs.
  induced E-R+ tissue are shown in red (genes are outlined). Metabolites and genes
  that are downregulated in E+R+ mice are shown in green. An asterisk indicates that
  the molecule is regulated in the opposite direction in lungs treated with the BIBW
  2992 + rapamycin combination. Box plots represent results for individual metabolites.
  The Y-axis is a scaled intensity value that represents the ratio between E-R+ and
  E+R+ lungs at 2 and 8 weeks pi with doxycycline, or on the right side of the plots,
  the ratio between vehicle-treated (V) and BIBW 2992 (B), rapamycin (R), or BIBW
  2992 + rapamycin (B+R)-treated lung samples after 4 weeks of treatment. The + inside
  box represents mean value, bar inside b represents median value, the upper bar represents
  maximum of distribution, the lower bar represents minimum of distribution, and the
  circles represent extreme data points. (A) Glutathione metabolism. GPX is unchanged
  in E+R+ vs. E-R+ lungs but is downregulated in treated lungs. γ–GCS: gamma-glutamylcysteine
  synthetase; GS: glutathione synthetase; GSR: glutathione reductase; GPX: glutathione
  peroxidase; GLRX: glutaredoxin; GST: glutathione S-transferase; ROS: reactive oxygen
  species. (B) Glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways. HK2: Hexokinase 2; PFK phosphofructokinase;
  LDHA: lactate dehydrogenase; ENO: enolase 1; ALDOC: aldolase C; PKM2: pyruvate kinase
  M; PGM1: phosphoglucomutase; PGD: phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; TKT: transketolase.'
