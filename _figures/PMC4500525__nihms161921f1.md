caption: Mammalian inositol phosphate metabolism. Simplified scheme of the known inositol
  phosphate metabolic pathway in mammalian cells. Circled P, phosphate moiety; R,
  R’, fatty acid side chains. The hatched box encloses pathway components for which
  genetic data suggest relevance in lymphocytes. For more details and discussions
  of the enzymes involved and of potential cellular inositol phosphate functions,
  see previously published works (, , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). The membrane phospholipid
  phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2/PI(4,5)P2, PIP2) acts as a
  precursor for the phosphoinositide PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3), and for the second messenger
  molecules diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3/I(1,4,5)P3/IP3).
  In mammalian cells, I(1,4,5)P3 acts as a key precursor for multiple higher order,
  soluble inositol phosphates. An important step in the synthesis of several inositol
  phosphates is I(1,4,5)P3 phosphorylation into I(1,3,4,5)P4 (IP4) by either one of
  three IP3 3-kinases (IP3KA, B or C, also termed ItpkA, B, or C; ; ; ) or by IPK2/IPMK
  (; ; ). Multiple higher order inositol phosphates have been reported in lymphocytes,
  including several of those shown here. The levels of some inositol phosphates are
  modulated after antigen receptor engagement (; , ; ; ; , ; , ; ). Complementing
  known PIP3, IP3, and DAG functions in lymphocyte development and function (; ; ;
  ; ), it has been recently found that IP4 is essential for these processes through
  novel roles in antigen receptor signaling and myelopoiesis (; ; , ; , ; ; ). The
  protocols described here are thus optimized for analyses of IP3 and IP4 isomers.
