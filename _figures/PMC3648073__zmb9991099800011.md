caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the signal transduction pathway involved in
  BDNF-mediated MMP-9 expression. BDNF-induced activation of TrkB results in signal
  propagation through ERK1/2 and leads to activation of SRF/MKL-dependent transcription.
  The downstream cascade involves transcription of the c-Fos gene, leading to activation
  of MMP-9 promoter gene expression.
