caption: Potential strategies for modulating the BMP pathway. (1–3) The BMP pathway
  may be activated by exogenous natural or engineered BMP ligands or by expression
  of such ligands via gene transfer techniques (1). Ligand-induced BMP pathway activation
  may be inhibited by extracellular ligand traps, such as naturally-occurring antagonists
  or neutralizing antibodies, via delivery of recombinant protein or expression via
  gene transfer techniques (2). Endogenous extracellular BMP antagonists, such as
  Noggin or Chordin, may be inhibited via neutralizing antibodies or small molecules,
  resulting in increased BMP signaling (3). (4-5) The endogenous BMP pathway inhibitors
  FKBP12 and Casein Kinase 2 may be inactivated by delivery of FK506 and CK2.3, respectively,
  thereby increasing signal transduction (4). Alternatively, BMP receptor-mediated
  activation of the SMAD effectors may be blocked by kinase inhibitors (5). (6-7)
  Persistence of BMP signaling may be modulated by regulating the SMURF1-mediated
  ubiquitination of SMAD effector proteins by disrupting SMURF1 interaction with SMADs
  by small molecule inhibitors (6) or by increasing SMURF1 protein levels (7). (8-9)
  BMP pathway component expression may be elevated by increasing transcription or
  alleviating microRNA-mediated translational silencing (8). Alternatively, BMP pathway
  component levels may be reduced by reducing transcription and/or translation rates
  (9).
