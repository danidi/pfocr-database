caption: Mechanistic model for ATF3-mediated negative regulation of antiviral and
  autophagy pathways in the absence of type I IFN. Shown above are the antiviral and
  autophagy pathways that are triggered following the virus infection of a mammalian
  cell. Our study shows that ATF3 induced during JEV infection can bind to the promoter
  region of Stat1, Irf9, Isg15 to suppress the antiviral signaling. We also show ATF3
  binding to Atg5 promoter, thereby suppressing the cellular antiviral pathway. The
  ATF3, thus, negatively regulates the cellular antiviral signaling and autophagy
  pathway in the absence of type I IFN.
