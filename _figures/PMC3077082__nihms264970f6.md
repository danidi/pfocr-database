caption: Activation of myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88)
  signalling by mycobacteria (at least in part through TLR2) induces CCAAT/enhancer-binding
  protein β (C/EBPβ)-mediated induction of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and granulocyte
  colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) production. These signal transducer and activator
  of transcription-3 (STAT3)-activating cytokines act in both autocrine and paracrine
  manners to induce arginase 1 (Arg1) expression which is partially dependent on C/EBPβ.
  The produced arginase can inhibit inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity
  through competition for the common substrate arginine. The MYD88 pathway for arginase
  production was shown to confer a survival benefit for mycobacteria in vivo and is
  thought to counteract pathways that activate nitric oxide production, such as TLR4.
