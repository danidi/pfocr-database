caption: Schematic overview of viruses that subvert the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.
  External signals, such as growth factors, insulin and cytokines, activate phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K) through receptor-mediated binding, which leads to phosphorylation
  of PIP2 into PIP3. mTORC1 is activated via a PI3K-dependent mechanism by Vaccinia
  virus (VACV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi’s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV), Adenovirus
  (ADV), influenza A virus (IAV) and West Nile virus (WNV). Evidence suggests that
  simian virus 40 (SV40) phosphorylates Akt/mTOR potentially through PI3K. PIP3 recruits
  Akt to the plasma membrane whereby it is phosphorylated and activated by PDK1. Varicella
  zoster virus (VZV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)
  are known to activate Akt by increasing phosphorylation, while vesicular stomatitis
  virus (VSV) and rift valley fever virus (RVFV) attenuate Akt signaling. Subsequently,
  activated Akt phosphorylates the negative regulator TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis protein
  2), which results in the dissociation of the TSC complex (TSC1 and TSC2). Human
  papillomavirus (HPV) and HCMV activate mTORC1 by inhibiting or causing the degradation
  of TSC2, respectively. The activity of Akt is mimicked by herpes simplex virus type
  1 (HSV-1), which causes the phosphorylation of TSC2. ADV, SV40 and HPV have dual
  activities and stimulate mTORC1 by blocking PP2A. Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in
  brain), in its GTP-loaded state, activates mTORC1, while TSC2 acts to inactivate
  mTORC1 by hydrolyzing Rheb-GTP to Rheb-GDP. Activation of mTORC1 enables continued
  protein synthesis and suppresses autophagy. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and
  human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) have been shown to activate mTOR although
  the point at which these viruses attack the signaling pathway is unknown. Solid
  lines indicate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Dashed lines indicate clearly
  identified and wavy dashed lines represent ill-defined points at which viruses subvert
  the pathway.
