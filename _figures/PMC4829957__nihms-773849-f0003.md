caption: (A) One response pathway intrinsic to erythroblasts, and downstream from
  the EPOR, involves EPO/EPOR/JAK2/Stat5 transcriptional induction of Erythroferrone
  (ERFE), a C1q-TNF cytokine. As secreted from erythroblasts, ERFE inhibits hepcidin
  and thereby enhances Ferroportin efflux of systemic iron. ERFE therefore may assist
  iron deficient anemias, and/or ERFE inhibition may lessen iron overload as associated,
  for example, with thalassemia. (B) Via studies of an Spi2A Serpin (as an additional
  novel EPO/EPOR/JAK2/Stat5 target gene) erythroblast lysosomal membrane permeability
  has been shown to become compromised during stress erythropoiesis, especially in
  oxidative and elevated ROS contexts. Small molecule inhibitors of leached lysosomal
  executioner cathepsins B (and L) therefore represent rational new targets as anti-anemia
  agents and erythroblast cytoprotectants during such stress erythropoiesis (e.g.,
  sickle cell anemia, thalassemia). (C) Among protein tyrosine phosphatases engaged
  in erythroid precursors via the EPOR, PTPN6 as a negative effector is a potential
  target in anti-anemia contexts. As a positive effector, PTPN18 might be considered
  as a new target in a context of lessening EPOR/JAK2 activation or effects for polycythemia
  and/or myeloproliferative disease.
