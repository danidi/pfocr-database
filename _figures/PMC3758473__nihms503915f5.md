caption: Circadian system is linked to the cell division cycle via circadian control
  of gene expression and posttranslational mechanisms. The transcription of c-Myc
  and Wee1 is circadian and appears to be a direct target of the CLOCK:BMAL1. The
  expression of Wee1 is co-regulated with Per and the entry of the cell cycle into
  M phase is suppressed during the day time when the transcription of Per (and Wee1)
  is high. In addition, the PER1 protein interacts with the check-point proteins,
  ATM and Chk2; while related work has linked the TIMELESS (TIM) and CRY proteins
  with Chk1. Activation of the DNA damage pathway can also reset the phase of the
  circadian clock.
