caption: 'Schematic showing signal transduction pathways mediated by environmental
  stresses such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cytokines, hyperoxia and irradiation
  (UV). The transmission of the signalling cascade across the membrane (gray ''bridge''
  shape) is associated with the activation of upstream kinases. Small G- protein-coupled
  proteins, such as PAK and RAC, mediate the activation of MAPK kinase kinase (MEKK)
  or NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK). The pathway then bifurcates into two branches: the
  p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the IκB/NF-κB pathway. One
  pathway activates IκB kinase (IKK), thereby leading to IκB phosphorylation/degradation
  and subsequently allowing NF-κB complex to translocate to the nucleus and promote
  gene expression. The other pathway involves the phosphorylation of MAPK kinase (MKK),
  which phosphorylates and activates MAPK (p38). This pathway is selectively blocked
  by the pyridinyl imidazole SB-203580. The activation of the MAPK pathway regulates
  the downstream activation of MAPK activating kinase (MAPKAP-K2), which phosphorylates
  the small heat-shock protein 27 (Hsp27) and activates the stability of transcripts
  of cytokines bearing the AU-rich element (ARE). The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine
  (NAC) provides cysteine that feeds into the biosynthetic machinery, allowing the
  formation of glutathione (GSH) by the action of the rate-limiting enzyme, γ-glutamylcysteine
  synthetase (γ-GCS). The activity of γ-GCS is irreversibly blocked by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine
  (BSO). GSH is broken down to cysteine by the action of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase
  (γ-GT), a membrane-bound enzyme. Redox regulation of the MAPK pathway mediated by
  NAC is likely to implicate the blockading of the upstream kinase that leads to phosphorylation
  and activation of p38/(reactivating kinase, RK).'
