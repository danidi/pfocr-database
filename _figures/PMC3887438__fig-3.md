caption: The immunoregulatory effect of immune cells in different phases of sepsis.
  (A) In the early phase of sepsis, macrophages, DCs, T lymphocytes, Tregs, and NKT
  cells play pivotal roles in the maintenance of peripheral homeostasis and regulation
  of inflammatory response by releasing various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
  TNF-α and INF-γ. NKT cells also possess cytotoxic effector activity via Fas/Fas
  ligand and perforin pathway. (B) In the later phase of sepsis, inhibitory cytokines
  ensued, including IL-10 and IL-4, which limit the strength of immune cell activation
  and expansion and negatively modulate inflammation. In addition, extracellular HMGB1
  has been shown to be able to provoke inflammation, to regulate functions of macrophage
  and T lymphocytes, and to mediate immune function of DCs and Tregs. HMGB1, high
  mobility group box-1 protein; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.
