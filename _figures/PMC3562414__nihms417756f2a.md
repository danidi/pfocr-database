caption: A. Pathways for the major phospholipid components are shown including the
  de novo pathway for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. B. Cartoon illustrating
  modes of regulation and functional domains of cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase
  α (CCTα), the key enzyme required for PC synthesis. CCTα is phosphorylated and its
  activity inhibited by extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2). CCTα is also
  a protein that translocates between the cytoplasm and nucleus. This cytoplasmic/nuclear
  shuttling occurs via binding to the scaffolding protein, 14-3-3ζ. In this scenario,
  calmodulin kinase I (CaMKI) (red) phosphorylates CCTα thereby providing a phosphorylation
  dock site for 14-3-3ζ binding to the enzyme to facilitate nuclear import. Nuclear
  CCTα export is controlled by exportin 1 (CRM1) (blue). CCTα is also sensitive to
  proteolysis as it is monoubiquitinated (Ubi) at a molecular site juxtaposed near
  its nuclear localization signal (NLS). This post-translational mechanism limits
  the enzyme’s interaction with importin-α (Iα) thereby targeting the enzyme for degradation.
  Calpains also target CCTα for degradation, an effect antagonized by calmodulin (CaM).
  Many of these intermediate mechanisms are activated in cells by stimuli (TNFα, oxysterols,
  exogenous calcium). Last, CCTα regulated by both activating and inhibitory lipids.
  C. The remodeling pathway involves phospholipase A2 hydrolysis of an unsaturated
  PC yielding lyso-PC. This substrate is then re-acylated by LPCAT1 using palmitoyl-CoA
  generating dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. Adapted and modified from M. Hermansson
  et all/Progress in Lipid Research 50 (2011), 240–257.
