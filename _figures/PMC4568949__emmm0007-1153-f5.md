caption: Proteins from the biomarker signatures, including the diagnostic signature
  from Surinova et al (), were associated and interlinked by the proteins they have
  in common. Protein nodes shaded in green were previously associated with cancer
  and the ones with a highlighted border with CRC according to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.  Protein
  annotation with gene ontology (GO) biological process terms. GO terms were summarized
  in four categories and connected to the respective proteins with a line. Additional
  terms of proteins belonging to the four main categories are labeled next to the
  respective proteins or with an asterisk in the case of the complement activation
  process.
