caption: Overview of FcγR signaling pathway in antibody resistant NLC. Therapeutic
  antibody binding to cell-surface receptor, FcγR independently activates SYK/BTK
  and p110δ/AKT pathways. Activation of SIRPα by tumor cell CD47 (not shown) activates
  SHP1 phosphatase that suppresses SYK activity.
