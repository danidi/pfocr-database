caption: 'Substrates involved in caffeine biosynthesis pathways and its other related
  pathways catalysed by enzymes that were encoded by genes carrying the TAVs identified
  from this study. (a) The SAM (S‐adenosyl‐Lmethionine) cycle (the activated methyl
  cycle) in plants (adapted from Ashihara and Suzuki, ); (b) the biosynthetic pathways
  of caffeine from xanthosine (adapted from Ashihara et al., ); (c) the ‘provider
  pathways’ for xanthosine synthesis in purine alkaloid forming plants (adapted from
  Ashihara and Suzuki, ); (d) de novo biosynthetic pathway of IMP in plants (adapted
  from Ashihara and Suzuki, ); circles: location of substrates/precursors, which were
  formed in the KEGG pathways catalysed by enzymes encoded by genes carrying the TAVs
  identified from this study. Circles of the same colour indicated the alternative
  locations of the same substrate.'
