caption: SARS-CoV(-2) host cell infection, replication (Phase I) and induction of
  immune response (Phase II). Spike protein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2 binds to host
  cell membrane presented ACE2 (cellular receptor); it either enters the endocytic
  pathway (A) or fuses via TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage of the ACE2-S protein complex
  directly with the cell membrane (B). Traveling down the endosomal pathway, the maturation
  of early endosomes (EE), via late endosomes (LE) to early lysosomes (EL), and finally
  lysosomes, is accompanied by vacuolar acidification (indicated as red area). In
  late endosomes/lysosomes, the ACE2-S protein complex is cleaved via cathepsin L,
  resulting in the fusion of the viral and host cell membrane. After release into
  the cytoplasm, translation of viral RNA into the polyprotein takes place. Afterwards,
  the polyprotein is cleaved into several active non-structural proteins by the chymotrypsin-like
  protease subunit (3CLpro), including RNA depending RNA polymerase (RdRp). RdRp subsequently
  synthesizes progeny genomes and subgenomic mRNAs translated to structural proteins
  at the endoplasmatic reticulum. Both structural proteins and progeny genomes meet
  in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), resulting in
  the assembled SARS-CoV-2 virus. Finally, the nucleocapsid is released from host
  cell via exocytosis. In Phase II, SARS-CoV-2 is recognized and internalized by antigen
  presenting cells (APC), triggering an innate immune response which is accompanied
  by a release of cytokines, including Interleukin-6 (IL-6). In severe cases, a massive
  release of IL-6 leads to the cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
