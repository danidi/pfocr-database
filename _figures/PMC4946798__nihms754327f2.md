caption: The cartoon shows various sources and sinks for Ca2+ in cells. In going forward,
  these need to be considered carefully in studies of astrocytes. Changes in cytosolic
  Ca2+ are dynamically regulated through interplay between Ca2+ channels, pumps and
  transporters. A variety of Ca2+ channels exist which are expressed on both the plasma
  membrane and the membrane of organelles. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are highly
  selective plasma membrane proteins that mediate Ca2+ signals in excitable cells
  in response to membrane depolarization. A number of neurotransmitters mediate Ca2+
  signals through less-selective ligand-gated ion channels. These include cell surface
  P2X receptors activated by ATP and the NMDA class of ionotropic receptors for glutamate
  (NMDAR). Nicotinic acetylcholine (AChR) and 5-HT3 (5HT3R) receptors are Ca2+-permeable
  members of the cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels activated by acetylcholine
  and 5-HT, respectively. TRP channels constitute a large family of widely expressed
  ion channels. They are divided into 6 families in mammals. Their Ca2+ selectivity
  varies widely and they are activated by a number of intracellular and extracellular
  cues including heat (e.g. TRPV1), cold (e.g. TRPM8), pungent chemicals (TRPA) and
  Ca2+ itself (TRPP2). TRPC channels are activated upon receptor-mediated signaling
  downstream of phospholipase C signaling via diacylglycerol in some cases. Orai channels
  are highly Ca2+-selective channels activated by the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM upon depletion
  of ER Ca2+ stores. Plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) pumps and sodium-calcium exchangers
  (NCX) transport Ca2+ out of the cytosol. IP3 receptors are intracellular Ca2+-permeable
  channels localized predominately to the ER where they mediate Ca2+ signals in response
  to IP3 produced upon phospholipase C activation, which occurs downstream of GPCR
  activation. Receptor stimulation also elevates levels of, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR)
  which activates the related ryanodine receptors (RyR). The ER Ca2+ stores are filled
  by sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPases (SERCA The Golgi complex (not shown)
  also acts as a dynamic Ca2+ store housing IP3 and ryanodine receptors for Ca2+ release
  and secretory pathway ATPases (together with SERCA) for filling. In addition to
  the ER, a number of acidic organelles which include lysosomes also serve as Ca2+
  stores. These acidic Ca2+ stores express two-pore channels (TPCs), activated by
  the intracellular messenger NAADP, and TRPM2 activated by ADP-ribose (which additionally
  activates plasma membrane TRPM2). TRP mucolipins (TRPML) and P2X4 receptors are
  also expressed on lysosomes. Ca2+ is also dynamically regulated by mitochondria.
  Ca2+ is rapidly taken up by the mitochondrial uniporter (MCU) which is a Ca2+-permeable
  channel localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane. Ca2+ is slowly released back
  into the cytosol by the actions of a mitochondrially targeted sodium-calcium changer
  (NCLX). The Ca2+ concentrations for the intracellular compartments were taken from
  published work [-].
