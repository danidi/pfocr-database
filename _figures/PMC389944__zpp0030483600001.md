caption: 'Proposed biosynthetic network for AsA synthesis in plants (reactions 1–12),
  and animals (reactions 13–20). Four potential branch pathways operating in plants,
  the Man pathway, galacturonate pathway, the gulose pathway, and the MI pathway,
  are shown. Enzymes catalyzing the numbered reactions are: 1, methyl-esterase; 2,
  d-galacturonate reductase; 3, aldono-lactonase; 4, Glc-6-phosphate isomerase; 5,
  Man-6-phosphate isomerase; 6, phosphomannomutase; 7, GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase;
  8, GDP-Man-3,5-epimerase; 9, phosphodiesterase; 10, sugar phosphatase; 11, l-Gal-1-dehydrogenase;
  12, l-galactono-1,4-lactone (l-GalL) dehydrogenase; 13, phosphoglucomutase; 14,
  UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase; 15, UDP-Glc dehydrogenase; 16, glucuronate-1-phosphate
  uridylyltransferase; 17, glucurono kinase; 18, glucuronate reductase; 19, aldono
  lactonase, and 20, guluno-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase. The reaction catalyzed by MIOX,
  and the possible pathway from MI to AsA (dashed arrows), are also shown. Question
  marks indicate enzymatic reactions that have not been demonstrated in plants.'
