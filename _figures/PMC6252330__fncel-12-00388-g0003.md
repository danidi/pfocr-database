caption: Cellular and molecular regulators of glioma CSC quiescence in the niche.
  CSCs can regulate their own state by autocrine mechanism by producing differentiation
  antagonists (Germlin1) or poise themselves to active growth by synthesizing PEDF
  and EGF, or by expressing constitutively active form of EGFR (EGFRviii). CSCs can
  attract immune cells by releasing proinflammatory cytokines (MCP1 for monocytes,
  IL6 and IL8) and induce their immunosuppressive phenotype (M1 macrophages transform
  into tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), effector T cells are induced to T regulatory
  cells (T regs)) by producing TGFβ. In turn, induced tumor-associated immune cells
  favor the CSC state by producing TGFβ. Mesenchymal cells CXCL12 can activate PI3K/Akt,
  IP3 and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways via CXCR4 and PLC/MAPK
  pathway via CXCR7. IL-8 supports glioma CSCs growth and migration towards endothelial
  cells. CSCs also regulate their nutrition supply by inducing neo-vascularization
  via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. Stromal cells producing
  Wnt5a can induce CSC quiescence via Ryk receptor. Differentiated tumor cells can
  regulate CSCs state via cell-cell contact through Notch signaling.
