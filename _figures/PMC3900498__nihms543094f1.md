caption: 'The Yin and Yang of PI3K vs PTEN in the regulation of beta cell proliferation.
  This is a greatly oversimplified schematic of the receptor-to-PI3K-to-proliferation
  pathway, focusing on PI3K (in green, because it activates the mitogenic pathway)
  and PTEN (in red because it inhibits the mitogenic pathway). In this example, a
  GPCR (such the GLP-1 receptor) activates PI3K via a G-protein (such as Gq); or a
  tyrosine kinase receptor, such as the insulin receptor (IR) or IGF-1 receptor (IGFR)
  activates PI3K via adaptor proteins, or in some cases directly. This leads to a
  sequence of downstream events including generation of PIP3, its activation of PDK1,
  which phosphorylates Akt/PKB, which in turn phosphorylates, thereby inhibiting,
  TSC1 and 2; this releases the small G-protein, Rheb, so that it can phosphorylate
  and activate MTOR. Active MTOR, through a complex series of downstream events, leads
  to proliferation. Not shown in the figure, this pathway interacts with a variety
  of other mitogenic and survival pathways, including, but not limited to, the Ras/Raf/MAPK
  pathways, JAK–STAT signalling pathways and PKC signalling pathways. For readers
  who prefer more detail, Shi et al [17] provide illustrations of PTEN intracellular
  compartmentalisation and regulation of its levels and activity. In the context of
  the accompanying report by Yang et al [13], the key point is that PTEN is placed
  near the top of this pathway, and thus in a pivotal position for controlling the
  entire pathway. It balances the pro-mitogenic activity of PI3K: its loss is permissive
  for increased activity in the pathway (and thus proliferation); conversely, its
  overexpression inhibits the pathway, reducing proliferation, and serving as a tumour
  suppressor protein (inhibiting proliferation)'
