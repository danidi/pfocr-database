caption: The cross‐talk between autophagy and HCV. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces
  autophagy to enhance virus replication rather than to block it. After HCV decapsidation,
  the virus genome is transferred to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and initiates replication
  in the ER‐derived membranous web as the HCV replication platform. HCV‐induced ER
  stress disrupts ER function and results in accumulation of unfolded proteins in
  the ER. Cells adapt to ER stress by triggering an unfolded protein response (UPR)
  to restore ER homeostasis. The UPR signaling pathway includes 3 central elements,
  PKR‐like ER kinase (PERK), ATF6, and IRE1. The UPR could stimulate an autophagy
  response. Under these conditions, calcium released from the ER stimulates impaired
  mitochondrial activity connect to excessive production of ROS. Dysfunctional mitochondria
  are engulfed for degradation via mitophagy. In addition, HCV promoted dynamin‐related
  protein 1‐mediated mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Drp1) leads to mitophagy. HCV
  replication takes place in close proximity to lipid droplets (LDs), the neutral
  lipid storage organelles, and this closeness enables the downstream viral morphogenetic
  events. A selective autophagy for lipids (lipophagy) protects cells from an excessive
  lipid accumulation elicited by HCV. Upon HCV infection, the host stimulates the
  antiviral interferon‐mediated frontline. HCV employs autophagy to escape host innate
  immune surveillance by inhibiting IFNα production. Furthermore, HCV replication
  reduced ribavirin uptake, due to reduced expression of the nucleoside transporters
  ENT1 and CNT1
