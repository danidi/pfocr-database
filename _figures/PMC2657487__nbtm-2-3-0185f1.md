caption: Schematic representation of intercellular signaling associated with the PAM
  process as specified by researchers at the University of Freiburg (; ). The signaling
  indicated here is for the HOCl/hydroxyl radical signaling pathway, which is one
  of two signaling pathways. The other NO/peroxynitrite pathway is less complicated
  () and is not presented. The figure is explained in the text.
