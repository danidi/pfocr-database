caption: The JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling
  pathway. Ligand-induced activation of latent cytoplasmic JAK kinases leads to the
  docking and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of latent monomeric or N-domain-mediated
  dimeric STAT proteins, facilitating the formation of active SH2-domain-mediated
  homodimers of STAT proteins. The tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT dimers are actively
  transported to the nucleus using metabolic energy and the importin α/β and RanGDP
  complex. Once inside the nucleus, the active STAT dimers bind to the promoters of
  genes containing the consensus recognition motif (GAS motif-ttcnnngaa) and activate
  transcription of these genes. STATs can bind DNA as dimers or as N-domain-mediated
  tetramers. The active STAT protein is only released from DNA upon dephosphorylation
  by nuclear phosphatases, following cytokine withdrawal, and the inactivated protein
  is then actively exported out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the exportin Crm-1/RanGTP
  complex. Monomeric STAT proteins can also passively shuttle between the cytoplasm
  and the nucleus via carrier-free diffusion through nuclear pores facilitated by
  the interaction with nucleoporins.
