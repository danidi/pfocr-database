caption: Overview of the core cell metabolic pathways. The energy source, ATP, is
  imperative for cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and cell‐specific
  functions. ATP generation is derived from the intracellular processes, glycolysis,
  and cellular respiration. Glucose, a primary energy substrate, is imported into
  the cytosol, from the extracellular space and undergoes conversion into pyruvate
  via a series of chemical reactions collectively known as glycolysis obtaining a
  net of 2 ATP per mole of glucose. Pyruvate is converted into acetyl–CoA (Ac–CoA)
  in mitochondrial to enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which drives the electron
  transfer chain (ETC) yielding a net production of 36 ATP molecules in a process
  called oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Notably, in certain cell types, such
  as cancer and endothelial cells, glycolysis‐derived pyruvate molecules are converted
  into lactate even when ample O2 is available, a phenomenon referred to as aerobic
  glycolysis. The glycolytic flux can also be directed through the pentose phosphate
  pathway (PPP) to generate NADPH, a cofactor for redox homeostasis and cellular respiration,
  as well as ribose‐5‐phosphate, a substrate for nucleotide synthesis. Furthermore,
  alternative macromolecules can feed into the TCA cycle besides pyruvate exhibited
  by conversion of fatty acids to acetyl–CoA via β‐oxidation and by conversion of
  glutamine to α‐ketoglutarate (α‐KG) via glutaminolysis. TCA cycle citrate may also
  be exported to the cytosol where it serves as a substrate for itaconic acid synthesis
  in M1 macrophages or may be converted to acetyl–CoA for fatty acid synthesis. Nucleocytoplasmic
  acetyl–CoA is additionally required as a substrate for histone acetylation (Ac)
  of chromatin histones, which impacts chromatin structure and gene transcription.
