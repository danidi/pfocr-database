caption: The role of IDO/kynurenine in cancer immunoediting. IDO1 is an enzyme involved
  in the catabolism of tryptophan (kynurenine pathway). IDO and kynurenine can be
  secreted by tumor and tolerogenic immune cells in the microenvironment where exert
  an immunosuppressive function polarizing myeloid cell toward M2 phenotype (TAM;
  MDSC) and suppressing effector T cell functions, while stimulating expansion and
  activation of permissive Treg population, increasing immune escape mechanisms (PD-1/PD-L1;
  CTLA-4/B7-1 crosstalk). Moreover, in the extracellular space, IDO1 depletes the
  essential amino acid tryptophan from the tumor microenvironment, favoring tumor
  growth. IDO1 inhibitors in combination with Immunotherapy aim to reverse immunoediting
  (backward arrow) by inhibiting and activating local immunosuppressive and tumor
  eradication mechanisms, respectively. PD-1, programmed cell death protein 1; PD-L1,
  PD-1 ligand; CTLA-4, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4; Foxp3, forkhead box P3; TAM,
  tumor-associated macrophages; MDSC, myeloid-derived suppressive cells.
