caption: The non-canonical or alternative NF-κB pathway. In unstimulated cells, TRAF3
  constitutively recruits NIK to the TRAF2–c-IAP1/2 complex, promoting c-IAP1/2-mediated
  K48-ubiquitination and degradation of NIK. Ligation of CD40 by CD40L leads to recruitment
  of the TRAF3–TRAF2–c-IAP1/2 complex to the receptor, where TRAF2 catalyzes polyubiquitination
  of c-IAP1/2. It thereby promotes ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of c-IAP1/2 toward
  TRAF3, leading to proteasomal degradation of the latter. As a result, NIK can no
  longer be recruited to the TRAF2–c-IAP1/2 complex. This leads to stabilization and
  accumulation of newly synthesized NIK and its activation presumably via autophosphorylation,
  resulting in activation of the IKKα homodimer. Activated IKKα then phosphorylates
  p100, leading to proteasome-mediated processing of p100 to p52. The p52:RelB heterodimer
  then translocates to the nucleus and regulates transcription of target genes. CD40L
  promotes antibody isotype switching in mature B-cells, RANKL initiates osteoclastogenesis
  from precursor cells, BAFF induces immune cell survival and proliferation of B-cells,
  and LT-β regulates lymph node development. The receptors represented here on one
  cell are therefore restricted to distinct cell types and usually do not act in parallel.
