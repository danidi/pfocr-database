caption: An analogy of a tree with deep roots is used to illustrate several points
  about chromatin factors implicated in autism. Candidate gene approaches for ASD
  have justifiably prioritized the investigation of low hanging fruit (large red circles)
  for genes that encode proteins with known functions at neuronal synapses. But these
  synaptic proteins are connected to signal transduction pathways that make changes
  to gene expression patterns through chromatin dynamics within the neuronal nucleus.
  The mTOR pathway, which integrates metabolic and nutrient sensing signals into energy
  is central to the signaling pathways and to supplying energy for chromatin remodeling
  events. But just as the roots and trunk of a tree are bidirectional pathways for
  the tree, information within the nucleus stored in the form of chromatin provides
  information back to the synapse to regulate levels of synaptic proteins during synaptic
  pruning and scaling. Levels of DNA methylation (small red dots) and readers of DNA
  methylation (MECP2, MBD1, etc) may act as chromatin sensors of many environmental
  factors including diet and chemical toxins during the maturation of synapses. Furthermore,
  chromatin factors such as MACROD2 and JMJD1C have metabolic sensing properties,
  so that factors such as stress and inflammation may alter chromatin dynamics of
  neurons with long lasting effects. Thus, in the future, it will be important to
  continue to dig beneath the surface to unearth the chromatin factors and epigenetic
  pathways in the etiology of ASD in order to fully understand these complex genetic
  disorders.
