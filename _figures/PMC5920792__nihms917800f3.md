caption: (A) Growth factor activation of RTKs leads to recruitment of NEDD4 to the
  receptor complex. (B) Independent and (C) SOCS- or (D) LRIG-mediated mechanisms
  recruit CBL to the receptor complex. NEDD4 and CBL direct the ubiquitination of
  RTKs, resulting in receptor endocytosis and routing to early endosomes. RTKs can
  then either be recycled to the plasma membrane or targeted for lysosomal degradation,
  thereby attenuating receptor signaling. Dashed lines connecting the human congenital
  disorder with the protein in the pathway encoded by the causative mutated gene.
  Syndromes described in the text and/or . PVNH7, Periventricular nodular heterotopia
  7; NS-like, Noonan syndrome-like; UFS, Urofacial syndrome; GF, growth factor; P,
  phosphorylation; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; U, ubiquitination.
