caption: Differential requirement of STAT for RTK signaling. The RTK Tor induces the
  expression of its target gene tll by derepression via activating the Ras-MAPK signaling
  pathway. Additional yet unidentified activators (A) and repressors (R2), which may
  or may not be controlled by Tor, determine the transcription levels of tll in a
  combinatorial manner. The activators (A) and repressors (R2) are unevenly distributed
  in cells along the anteroposterior axis of the embryo. In the central region of
  the embryo, there are higher levels of the repressors or lower levels of activators
  than the posterior region (only one possibility is shown). Mrl (STAT) is not essential
  for tll expression under wild-type conditions. However, TorGOF activates Mrl. Activated
  Mrl is required to overcome the higher levels of repressors (R2) in tissues where
  tll is not normally expressed, resulting in developmental abnormalities. Arrow and
  bar indicate activation and repression, respectively. Dotted lines represent undermined
  events.
