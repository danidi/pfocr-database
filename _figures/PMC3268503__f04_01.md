caption: Biosynthetic pathway of ALA.In Arabidopsis and all other higher plants, algae
  and bacteria (with the exception for α-proteobacteria), ALA is synthesized from
  glutamate (Glu) via the so-called C5pathway consisting of three enzymatic steps.
  In the shaded boxes, the corresponding enzyme names are given with abbreviations
  (in parentheses).
