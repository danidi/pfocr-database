caption: Proposed model for maltose uptake and metabolism in enterococci and other
  MalT- and MapP-containing bacteria. Maltose taken up by the low affinity ABC transport
  system is metabolized via the usual maltose phosphorylase-mediated pathway. Maltose
  taken up via the PTS enters the cells as maltose-6’-P. Enterococci and streptococci
  lack a 6-P-α-glucosidase (MalA) which in other bacteria hydrolyzes maltose-6’-P
  into glucose and glucose-6-P. In contrast, enterococci and streptococci possess
  a phosphatase (MapP), which dephosphorylates intracellular maltose-6’-P to maltose,
  thereby connecting PTS-mediated maltose uptake to maltose phosphorylase-catalyzed
  metabolism.
