caption: Metabolic tracing of hypoxia-induced 12C metabolic stores of glycolytic,
  pentose phosphate pathway and amino sugar biosynthesis into de novo peptidoglycan
  biosynthesis following re-aeration at 20% O2 for 0h, 0.5h, 1h, 1.5h, 4h, 8h, and
  24h. Changes are shown in stacked bar graph format relative to accumulated levels
  observed following incubation at 1% O2 for 48h (designated 0h) for either 12C (unlabeled
  species) or total (12C + all 13C species) of indicated metabolite. Gray font indicates
  undetected intermediates. D-Glu, D-glutamate; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc,
  N-acetylmuramic acid; L-Ala, L-alanine; MurNGlyc, glycolyl N-acetylmuramic acid;
  PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pi, inorganic phosphate; UDP, uridine diphosphate. All
  values are the average ± SEM of three experimental replicates (n=3) and representative
  of 2 independent experiments.
