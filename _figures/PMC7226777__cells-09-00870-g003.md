caption: 'Cellular pathology of neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases
  and its correlation with microglial response and modulation of TSPO ligand-binding
  potentials. Neurodegeneration initiated by cellular protein modification or aggregation
  induces an inflammatory response, accompanied by activation of the M1 and/or M2
  microglial pathway. Proinflammatory (M1) microglial phenotype activated by LPS,
  Tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF-α, or Interferon gamma IFNγ stimulation is characterized
  by the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase iNOS, MHC II, and significantly
  increased TSPO BP as well as ROS overproduction and secretion of injury-mediated
  cytokines. The anti-inflammatory (M2) microglial phenotype is stimulated by interleukins
  (IL-4, IL-10, IL-13) characterized by the secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic
  factor (BDNF), Insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and anti-inflammatory cytokines
  []. Abbreviations: AD—Alzheimer disease; AMPK—5′ AMP-activated protein kinase; BDNF—brain
  derived neutrophic factor; BPAD—Bipolar affective disorder; HD—Huntington disease;
  IFNγ—Interferon gamma; IGF1—Insulin growth factor 1; IL—Interleukin; iNOS—Inducible
  nitric oxide synthase; LPS—Lipopolysaccharide; MDD—Major depressive disorder; MHCII—Major
  histocompatibility complex protein class II; PD—Parkinson disease; SCZ—Schizophrenia;
  TNF-α—Tumor necrosis factor alpha.'
