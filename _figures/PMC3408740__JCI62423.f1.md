caption: The upstream alarmin signaling pathways are potential therapeutic targets
  for immunomodulation in both acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. This has been
  achieved in animal models by directly targeting the alarmins using antibodies or
  competitive inhibitors, e.g., Box A (HMGB1), or by targeting the pattern recognition
  receptors (PRR) with antibodies or soluble decoy receptors. The convergence of S100
  proteins and HMGB1 onto their receptors may be a rate-limiting step in this pathway
  and hence represents an attractive therapeutic target. Downstream cytokine blockade,
  including of TNF-α and IL-6, is used clinically in the treatment of chronic inflammatory
  diseases such as RA and inflammatory bowel disease, but remains ineffective in a
  significant proportion of patients. Cytokine blockade has been notably unsuccessful
  in patients with acute inflammatory disorders.
