caption: Potential contributions of PCAF‐induced acetylation to the development of
  hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cancer tumour growth. A, Gli1 is a direct negative
  target of PCAF‐induced EMT promoting tumour metastasis and invasions; (B) PCAF can
  directly acetylate cytoplasmic Gli1 proteinat, preventing its nuclear translocation
  and promoter occupancy, and consequently suppressing Hedgehog signalling in HCC;
  (C) PCAF acetylate PTEN at lysine 125 and 128 to inhibit PTEN regulation of PI3K/AKT
  signalling, therefore, inhibiting the PTEN‐regulated cell cycle arrest expression
  depends on the presence of growth factors, which results in the progression of HCC;
  (D) The three enzymes in the glycolysis pathway are acetylated by PCAF, accelerating
  aerobic glycolysis and increasing the Warburg effect in HCC; (E) P53 is acetylated
  by PCAF, and this modification increases the transcription of P53, a tumour suppressor,
  therefore inhibiting liver tumour growth. Gli1, glioma‐associated oncogene homologue‐1;
  Bcl‐2, B‐cell lymphoma‐2; BAX, Bcl‐2‐Associated X Protein; GAPDH, Glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate
  dehydrogenase; PKM2, pyruvate kinase M2; PGK1, Phosphoglycerate kinase 1; Ub, ubiquitination
