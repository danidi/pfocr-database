caption: '(A) Ingenuity Pathways analysis: representative analysis of ARC identified
  proteins in obese mice (for protein details, see ). The network consists of 35 nodes
  and includes 9 differentially expressed proteins identified by our MS/MS spectra
  (in red). Note the interactions of GFAP and NEFM (discontinuous circles) with MAPK
  and STAT3 (black circles). All the identified proteins appeared in the network map.
  (B) Representative western blot of hypothalamic proteins taken from rats fasted
  for 8 h, and treated with 10 µg of sodium tungstate (W) via icv (n = 6), and western
  blot quantification. Tissues were collected 5 and 15 min after treatment. *p<0.05
  vs. untreated rats. The leptin signaling pathway was activated in the hypothalamus
  of sodium tungstate-treated animals as soon as 5 minutes after icv injection, showing
  changes in the phosphorylation state of STAT3 and MAPK, in accordance with Ingenuity
  Pathways results.'
