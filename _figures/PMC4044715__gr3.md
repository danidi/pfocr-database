caption: 'A working model of methuosis: Nascent macropinosomes generated from lamellipodial
  membrane projections enter the cell and coalesce to form large fluid-filled vacuoles.
  The latter are unable to recycle like normal macropinosomes, but rapidly mature
  to form a stable vacuole population with some characteristics of late endosomes
  (Rab7 and LAMP1). In contrast to functional late endosomes, the vacuoles do not
  sequester acidotropic markers (LysoTracker and acridine orange) or fuse with pre-existing
  lysosomes. It remains to be determined if the vacuoles have the capacity to disrupt
  protein trafficking in the clathrin-dependent pathway or merge with early endosomes
  or late multivesicular endosomes. Although there is good evidence that the macropinosome-derived
  vacuoles are distinct from autophagosomes, it will be important to determine whether
  the accumulation of vacuoles or associated changes in the metabolic state of the
  cell may have an impact on macroautophagy. A central question for future study is
  how vacuolization of macropinosomes or late endosomes leads to loss of membrane
  integrity and necrotic cell death. Contributing factors, which are not mutually
  exclusive, could include compromised mitochondrial energy metabolism, mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeability (MOMP), lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP), or ER
  stress. AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor; Cyt c, cytochrome c.'
