caption: The iterative procedure used to reconstruct the genome-scale metabolic model
  ofS. platensisC1. The draft of the metabolic network was automatically established
  using Pathway Tools software. The manual curation was performed based on a combination
  of Spirulina-related journal publications and biochemical books and databases. Missing
  reactions in the pathway were manually estimated and filled. Blast program was used
  in order to find a potential corresponding gene. The accepted network was further
  studied via a structural analysis and simulation based on the COBRA toolbox [,]
