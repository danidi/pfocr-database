caption: Schematic illustration of miR-146b function in IEC-6 cells mediating TGF-β
  signaling. It is known that the stimulatory Smad2/3 form complex with Smad4 as an
  immediate consequence of TGF-β stimuli; up-regulation of miR-146b (involving ERK1/2
  activation) directly causes the abundance of SIAH2 functional protein to decrease,
  which releases of the inhibitory Smad7 to negatively regulate the activities of
  stimulatory Smads, thus maintaining the homeostasis of TGF-β signaling pathway
