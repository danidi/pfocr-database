caption: Tim-1 regulates the initiation of the T cell immune response. Tim-1 is expressed
  at low levels on undifferentiated T cells and is upregulated after stimulation.
  Tim-1 pathway, stimulated at least in part by Tim-4 expressed by splenic APCs, enhances
  the proliferation of T lymphocytes (CD4 and CD8) and the cytokine production regardless
  of the nature of differentiated T lymphocytes (TH1 or TH2).
