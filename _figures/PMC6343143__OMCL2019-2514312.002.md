caption: 'Proposed model of estrogen-induced ROS generation increase in thyrocyte.
  Estradiol stimulates ROS production by NOX4 that is possibly located in the plasma
  membrane, endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear membrane, and mitochondria, as well as
  generates ROS through its own metabolization. ROS can reach the nucleus and promote
  several alterations that might contribute to thyroid carcinogenesis. Estrogen metabolization
  pathway also gives rise to the mutagenic DNA depurinating adducts. It is important
  to point out that the intracellular increase of ROS in response to estrogen can
  also positively modulate important carcinogenesis-related signaling pathways, such
  as ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt. DSB: double-strand break; DUOX: dual oxidase; E2: estrogen;
  NOX4: NAPDH oxidase 4; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SSB: single-strand break; TPO:
  thyroperoxidase.'
