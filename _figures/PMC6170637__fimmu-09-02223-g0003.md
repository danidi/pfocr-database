caption: Comparison of the extracellular pattern recognition receptors and signaling
  pathways involved in the recognition of pathogenic microorganisms by animal and
  plant cells. Recognition and signaling pathway mediated by animal Toll-like receptor
  (TLR)-4 and TLR5 and plant receptors XA21 and FLS2 are shown as examples of extracellular
  microbial recognition. Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR), myeloid differentiation
  primary response 88 (MyD88), TNF receptor associated factor (TRAF), interleukin-1
  receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MKK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), tumor necrosis factor alpha
  (TNF-α), interleukin (IL), Arabidopsis thaliana receptor kinase FLS2 (FLS2), rice
  receptor kinase XA21 (XA21), reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium-dependent protein
  kinase (CDPK), pathogenesis-related protein (PR).
