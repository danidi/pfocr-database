caption: Cisplatin treatment in breast cancer cells activates the ERK/MAPK pathway
  and cisplatin-activated ERK activates the related transcription factors, which bind
  to the FEN1 promoter. This eventually enhances FEN1 protein production, and FEN1
  overexpression promotes cisplatin therapy resistance via increasing DNA repair ability.
  Curcumin treatment induces a decrease of ERK phosphorylation and inactivation of
  the given transcription factors, which cannot bind to the FEN1 promoter, and results
  in FEN1 down-regulation. Finally, curcumin enhances breast cancer cell sensitivity
  to cisplatin via attenuating DNA repair ability.
