caption: Proposed pathway for the mechanism of shear stress-induced NO. Flow causes
  the release of ATP in nM-μM levels, which activate purnergic receptors causing the
  release of IP3 and DAG. IP3 then causes the ER to deplete intracellular calcium
  stores. Depletion of ER calcium stores leads to the activation of store-operated
  channels (SOCs) (known as capacitative calcium entry (CCE)), which is PKC-dependent.
  CCE then activates calcium-dependent calmodulin (Ca+2-CaM), which leads to phosphorylation
  of eNOS and production of NO.
