caption: An example of the network representation of time-series metabolome data in
  Arabidopsis using KEGGscape (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/keggscape). The datasets
  were sampled with 4-h resolution under a 16 h/8 h light/dark cycle at 20°C (Espinoza
  et al., ). We used the KEGG pathway map (ath00020), the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle, or the citrate cycle. We queried MetMask (Redestig et al., ) for a list of
  KEGG compound IDs associated with a list of predefined metabolite names and picked
  up the most pathway-mapped KEGG compound ID for each metabolite. Metabolite names
  shown in red represent detected compounds in the dataset. The diurnal changes were
  visualized on bar charts ranging from −0.3 to 0.3 in log-mean values. ZT, Zeitgeber
  time.
