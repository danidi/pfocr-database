caption: Model of somatic sex determination in C. elegans. (A) Genetic hierarchy regulating
  somatic sex determination. (Barred lines) Negative interactions; (arrows) positive
  interactions. The X/A ratio controls both X chromosome dosage compensation and sex
  determination via xol-1 and the sdc genes. The regulatory pathway branches at the
  level of the sdc genes and only the branch that controls somatic sex determination
  is shown. In XX animals, tra-2 negatively regulates the fem genes, allowing tra-1
  to promote female development. In XO animals, elevated her-1 activity inhibits tra-2
  and permits the fem genes to bring about male development by negatively regulating
  tra-1. The fem genes have additional targets in the germ line, because they are
  required for spermatogenesis irrespective of the state of tra-1 (; ). (B) Molecular
  model of somatic sex determination. (Left) A high X/A ratio prevents HER-1 synthesis,
  allowing TRA-2A to inhibit the FEM proteins and TRA-1A to direct female somatic
  development. Whether the three FEM proteins form a complex is not known. (Right)
  A low X/A ratio results in the synthesis of HER-1, a small, secreted protein that
  inactivates the membrane protein TRA-2A, thereby releasing the FEM proteins from
  negative regulation. The FEM proteins then inhibit the activity of the sequence-specific
  DNA-binding protein, TRA-1A, by an unknown mechanism to cause male development.
