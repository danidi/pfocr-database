caption: 'Schematic representation of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
  In the extrinsic pathway, ligation of receptor to death receptor causes DISC formation
  leading to caspase-8 activation. In type I cells caspase-8 directly cleaves caspase-3,
  which starts the death cascade. In type II cells an additional amplification loop
  is required, which involves tBid-mediated cytochrome c release from mitochondria
  followed by apoptosome formation. In the intrinsic pathway, stress signals from
  a variety of insults are sensed by BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins and communicated
  to multidomain pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins. The functional interplay
  of the proteins ultimately results in the activation of BAX and BAK at target organelles
  such as mitochondria and ER, which participate in apoptosis by releasing apoptogenic
  factors. Cytosolic cytochrome c triggers the formation of apoptosome, followed by
  activation of caspases-9 and -3. Function of caspase can be modulated on several
  levels. Activation of caspases at the DISC is inhibited by c-FLIP proteins; activation
  of effector caspases is inhibited by IAPs (see text for details). Smac/DIABLO and
  HtrA2/Omi neutralize the inhibition of caspases by IAPs. Smac/DIABLO, HtrA2/Omi,
  AIF and endo G may also initiate a caspase-independent cell death pathway. Abbreviations:
  FADD, Fas-associated death domain; DISC, death-inducing signalling complex; BAK,
  BCL-2 antagonist/killer; BAX, BCL-2-associated X protein; BCL-2, B-cell lymphoma
  2 protein; IAPs; inhibitor of apoptosis proteins; Apaf-1; apoptosis protease activating
  factor1 and AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor.'
