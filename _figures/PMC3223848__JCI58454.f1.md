caption: Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, trigger phosphorylation and activation
  of the IKK complex, which is composed of two catalytic kinase subunits (IKK1 and
  IKK2) and the regulatory subunit NEMO. As a consequence, the inhibitory protein
  IκB is phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and then degraded by the proteasome. The NF-κB
  dimer (e.g., p50 and p65) translocates into the nucleus and regulates target gene
  expression. Vlantis et al. overexpressed constitutively active IKK2 in IECs ().
  This led to inflammation (immune cell infiltration) and tumorigenesis via intrinsic
  and paracrine mechanisms. As depicted here, they found that overexpression of constitutively
  active IKK2 led to activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. However, it is not yet
  clear how this is regulated (directly via IKK or indirectly via NF-κB or NF-κB target
  genes).
