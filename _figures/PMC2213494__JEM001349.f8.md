caption: Model for apoptosis signaling in HSCs. The middle two arrows in each panel
  represent the two active apoptosis pathways that need to be blocked. It is currently
  unclear whether these represent two completely separate pathways, or two actions
  within one pathway. White arrows and text show the inactive pathway. Black arrows
  and text show the active signaling pathway. Bcl-2 is meant to represent antiapoptosis
  Bcl-2 family members. The top panel shows Kitl signaling in the wild-type HSCs.
  Although the proliferative signal from Kitl is conveyed, apoptosis is blocked only
  partially at best. In the middle panel, transgene-derived BCL-2, in combination
  with Kitl/c-Kit–transmitted signals, blocks apoptosis, allowing the Kitl-conveyed
  proliferation, and possibly differentiation-inducing activities to be seen. In the
  bottom panel, multifactor stimulation also completely blocks apoptosis and results
  in specific proliferation/differentiation, depending on the factor combination used.
