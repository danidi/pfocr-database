caption: Figure 1. Co-stimulatory interactions between helper T cells and acute myeloid
  leukemia cells. (A) The initial engagement between acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
  cells that harbor B7-2 (CD86) and/or B7-H2 (ICOSL) provokes T-cell responses and
  TH1/TH17 differentiation. (B) In turn, helper T-cell responses modulate the expression
  of B7 family molecules on AML cells. In particular, B7-H2 levels are decreased while
  B7-H1 (PD-L1) and B7-DC (PD-L2) are upregulated. The AML cells gain immunosuppressive
  functions, hampering helper T-cell responses and favoring the differentiation of
  regulatory T cells, especially through the PD1 pathway.
