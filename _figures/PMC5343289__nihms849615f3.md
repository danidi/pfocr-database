caption: Autophagy activity in T cells, antigen presenting cells (APCs), and dying
  cells affects T cell immunity. Autophagy in APCs such as dendritic cells delivers
  intracellular and extracellular antigens to endo-lysosomal vesicles where it can
  intersect the MHC-II presentation pathway and stimulate a CD4+ T cell response.
  Peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) in autophagosomes generate citrullinated peptides,
  thereby affecting the repertoire of antigens being presented. Extracellular antigens
  can also be delivered to the endoso-lysosome by LAP. Autophagy-mediated release
  of ATP by dying cells, such as those infected by viruses, leads to engulfment by
  the APC. Internalized antigens from the dying cell can then be cross-presented on
  MHC-I molecules to stimulate CD8+ T cells, a process mediated by autophagy or potentially
  LAP downstream of GCN2 activation. The removal of ROS producing mitochondria inhibits
  calpain-mediated processing of IL-1α, thereby decreasing Th17 differentiation of
  CD4+ T cells by secreted IL-1α. Naïve CD4+ T cells require autophagy for survival
  and proliferation, and cytokine production once activated. The establishment of
  memory by CD8+ T cells is also dependent on autophagy.
