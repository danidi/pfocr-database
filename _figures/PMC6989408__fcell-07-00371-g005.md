caption: 'Mitochondria-associated ER membranes in normal versus cancer cells. Schematic
  cartoon illustrating ER-mitochondria (MAMs) tethering proteins. MAMs regulate lipid
  transfer and play an important role in Ca2+ homeostasis by orchestrating Ca2+ shuttling
  from ER to mitochondria. Normal cells rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy
  production, and possess normal MAM configuration, which promotes apoptotic cell
  death in response to calcium overloading. Conversely in cancer cells, which use
  the glycolytic pathway to produce ATP, expression level of tethering proteins is
  altered and “aberrant” MAMs are formed. In most cases, the ER-mitochondria contact
  is reduced and, hence, also the mitochondrial calcium uptake, favoring cell survival
  and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Multiple proteins are involved in ER-mitochondria
  tethering (), those that are described in the text and the figures are: TMX1, thioredoxin
  related transmembrane protein 1; PTPIP51, protein tyrosine phosphatase-interacting
  protein 51; VAPB, VAMP-associated protein B; Mfn1/2, Mitofusin 1/2; PERK, protein
  kinase RNA-like ER kinase; GRP75, glucose-regulated protein 75; IP3R, IP3 (inositol
  1,4,5-trisphosphate) receptor; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; PACS2, phosphofurin
  acidic cluster sorting protein 2.'
