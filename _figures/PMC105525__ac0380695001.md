caption: Potential involvement of superoxide in INH action. INH is shown as a prodrug
  activated by KatG protein (catalase-peroxidase) or Mn2+ action. At the left of the
  figure is a schema showing the resting form of KatG (FeIII KatG) being converted
  to an active form by two pathways, one of which (a) requires superoxide (·O2−).
  On the right is a schema showing activation of INH by an Mn2+-dependent pathway
  that also involves superoxide (b), as indicated by inhibition by superoxide dismutase
  (SOD). This pathway is shown with a dashed line because it is unlikely to be significant
  in vivo (see text); in vivo, there may be a comparable katG-independent, peroxide-dependent
  activation (). Activated INH (INH*) blocks mycolic acid synthesis by inactivating
  InhA in M. smegmatis and AcpM-KasA in M. tuberculosis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  arise during activation of INH (, ) or from the presence of superoxide (c). The
  AhpC protein appears to limit accumulation of the macromolecular oxidative damage
  that is expected to arise from activation of INH or the presence of superoxide.
  Wavy lines indicate inhibition of a pathway; lines with a perpendicular bar indicate
  inhibition of enzymes.
