caption: Signaling mechanisms that regulate TFEB nuclear translocation. Under normal
  feeding conditions, TFEB is phosphorylated by mTORC1 on the lysosomal surface and
  is sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14‐3‐3 proteins. During starvation and physical
  exercise mTORC1 is inactivated and Ca2+ is released from the lysosome through MCOLN1.
  This leads to local calcineurin activation and TFEB dephosphorylation. Dephosphorylated
  TFEB is no longer able to bind 14‐3‐3 proteins and can freely translocate to the
  nucleus where it transcriptionally activates the lysosomal/autophagic pathway [modified
  from (Medina et al, )].
