caption: Signaling network regulating sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter (NKCC2)
  and Na/H exchanger (NHE3) in thick ascending limb (TAL) cells. A proposed signaling
  network for various stimuli that upregulate NKCC2 and NHE3 activities in TAL cells
  is shown. Parathyroid hormone (PTH), glucagon, calcitonin, vasopressin, and β-adrenergic
  agonists mainly activate the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathway, which subsequently activates
  protein kinase A (PKA). Other downstream mediators of cAMP, which phosphorylate
  T96 of NKCC2 and S552 of NHE3, are still unidentified. The low-chloride hypoosmotic
  condition also activates NKCC2 through WNK/SPAK/OSR and AMPK pathways. S87 of NKCC2
  is also found to be phosphorylated in the low-chloride condition; however, the kinase
  responsible for this phosphorylation is still unidentified.
