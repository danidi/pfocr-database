caption: 'A cartoon illustrating two independent parallel pathways in the post-mitosis
  G1 phase (G1-pm) in cell proliferation: MAPK and the Hippo pathways. This figure
  depicts the new view proposed in this work. In the first pathway, EGFR signaling
  activates Ras which turns on the MAPK pathway. This leads to the activation of transcription
  factors such as Elk1 and c-Jun. In the second parallel pathway, signaling takes
  place through the Hippo pathway. This results in phosphorylation of YAP1 and thus
  its degradation. On the left hand-side oncogenic mutant B-RafV600E is targeted by
  drug, and thus the MAPK pathway is inhibited. Drug resistance can take place by
  inactivation of the Hippo pathway. The unphosphorylated YAP1 (right hand-side, bottom)
  binds to the transcription factor TEAD. The complex binds to the DNA leading to
  transcription of genes encoding proteins acting in cell growth and division at the
  same cell cycle stage as the MAPK pathway does. Thus, MAPK and Hippo are independent
  core (parallel) pathways. An alternative strategy that the cell can adopt in drug
  resistance is activating MEK5 to take over MEK1/2 inaction. Under physiological
  conditions, MEK5 is activated by an unknown cell surface receptor (depicted by a
  question mark here). MEK5 bypasses MEK1/2 in the same (MAPK) pathway.'
