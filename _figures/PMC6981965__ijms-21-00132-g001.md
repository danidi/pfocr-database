caption: Biogenesis pathway of canonical miRNAs. miRNA biogenesis is mediated by multiple
  steps, including the transcription of primary miRNA transcripts, nuclear processing
  by Drosha, nucleocytoplasmic export by XPO5, cytoplasmic processing by Dicer, and
  formation of the RISC with Ago proteins.
