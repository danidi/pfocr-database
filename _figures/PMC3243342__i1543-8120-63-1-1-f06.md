caption: Model for the control of storage compound synthesis and accumulation in maturing
  seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana.Precursors for fatty acid synthesis are derived from
  sucrose through the glycolysis, the OPPP and the RuBisCO shunt. Fatty acids synthesised
  in the plastids are then exported toward the cytosol in the form of acyl-CoAs, acylated
  on a glycerol backbone to form triacylglycerides, which are ultimately stored in
  oil bodies. Amino acids required for the synthesis of seed storage proteins are
  either directly imported from the maternal tissues or synthesised/modified in the
  embryo. Solid arrows represent positive transcriptional regulations. Target genes
  encoding actors of the metabolic network are placed in the inner ring of the scheme.
  ACCase, heteromeric acetyl-CoA carboxylase; FA, fatty acids; OPPP, oxidative pentose
