caption: The role of LILRB4 in the development of various diseases. The expression
  of LILRB4 affects the development of various immune diseases. For example, LILRB4
  deficiency plays a detrimental role in the activation of macrophages (BMDMs) associated
  with acute lung injury by promoting the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. The loss of
  LILRB4 accelerates cardiac hypertrophy by promoting upregulation of caspase-3 activation
  via the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway. LILRB4 inhibits the
  ubiquitination of TRAF6 by recruiting SHP1, which largely reverses nonalcoholic
  fatty liver disease (NAFLD). LILRB4 deficiency promotes atherogenesis by reducing
  Shp1 phosphorylation.
