caption: 'Tsc3 regulates the balance between canonical and noncanonical SPLs by promoting
  l-alanine incorporation into the SPL de novo synthesis pathway. A: Both alanine
  and serine are utilized by the intact SPT complex to maintain a homeostasis between
  canonical and noncanonical SPLs. Serine influx into canonical SPLs is at a faster
  rate than alanine incorporation into noncanonical SPLs. B: Eliminating the Tsc3
  subunit from the SPT complex changes SPL homeostasis, with the generation of canonical
  SPLs becoming more dominant. The increased serine influx in tsc3Δ is partially due
  to the lack of alanine inhibition. The serine influx is also further boosted with
  Ypk1-dependent SPT derepression through Om1/2 deactivation and Ypk1-depenent CerS
  activation. The production of complex SPLs is not shown in these schemes. Enzymes
  in the SPL pathway are shown in gray boxes. SPL intermediate metabolites are shown
  in ovals with a blue outline. Ypk1’s action on its substrates are indicated with
  a red line (inhibition) and green arrow (activation). Steps of Ypk1-depdent increases
  in serine influx into the SPL pathway are shown with bold green arrows.'
