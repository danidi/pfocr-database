caption: Dysfunctional telomeres activate upstream checkpoint PI3 kinases, such as
  ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) or ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related),
  - (). Once activated, these kinases phosphorylate downstream factors including CHK1
  and CHK2 that in turn phosphorylates p53. Phosphorylation of p53 results in the
  displacement of the murine double minute 2 (MDM2) protein, liberating p53 from degradation
  and stimulation of the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21.
  p21 inhibits cell cycle progression by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases that
  phosphorylate and inactivate RB. In addition to promoting cell cycle arrest, dysfunctional
  telomeres can also activate p53-dependent apoptosis, since mice bearing dysfunctional
  telomeres show increased apoptosis in proliferative cells-. In the setting of a
  competent p53 pathway, dysfunctional telomeres appear to function as a potent tumor
  suppressor by engaging cellular pathways that activate replicative senescence and/or
  apoptosis to inhibit tumor formation. Therefore, it is not surprising that p53 loss
  results in a permissive environment that favors proliferation and survival of genomically
  damaged cells and the eventual progression to cancer. The role of p16Ink4a-Rb pathway
  in mediating the telomere DDR is less clear ().
