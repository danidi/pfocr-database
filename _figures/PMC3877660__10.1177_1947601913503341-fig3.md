caption: 'Schematic representation showing various signaling pathways regulating distinct
  aspects of a tumor and current status of their therapeutic exploitation. The figure
  also highlights windows that can be actively considered for future drug development.
  A tumor (central pink circle) can be thought of being therapeutically targeted at
  its 3 cardinal features: growth and survival, angiogenesis, and stem cells (red
  bars). Research, in turn, has shown that these 3 properties are being driven by
  certain major cellular signaling pathways (green closed circles), which have been
  the center of attraction for clinical intervention. All these signaling pathways
  exhibit extensive crosstalk (yellow open circle) and thus both these individual
  pathways (classically) and their interjunctions (combinatorial approach, more recently)
  have been used for drug development, as shown in the figure. For example, cilengitide
  has been shown to be both anti-angiogenic and also inhibits proliferation of glioma
  stem cells. The figure clearly shows that most drug development efforts have been
  concentrated toward the angiogenesis and growth/survival properties. However, drugs
  targeting angiogenesis and stem cells combinatorially are relatively unexplored.
  The inset box lists drugs that target generalized housekeeping properties of tumor
  cells in contrast to a specific signaling pathway.'
