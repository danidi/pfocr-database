caption: Negative regulation of the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling in Arabidopsis. (a)
  JAZs bind to transcription factors (TFs), such as JAM1 and JAM2, and compete with
  MYC2 for binding to the promoters of JA-responsive genes to repress their transcription
  []. (b) JAZ proteins (e.g., JAZ8) also interact with JASMONATE-ASSOCIATED VQ MOTIF
  GENE 1 (JAV1) and WRKY51 to form a “JJW” co-repressor complex. The JJW complex,
  in turn, binds to the promoter of JA-biosynthetic genes (e.g., AOS) and represses
  their expression, inhibiting JA biosynthesis []. (c) MYC2 is polyubiquitinated by
  PUB10 and is targeted for degradation, while it is stabilized by UBP12- and UBP13-mediated
  deubiquitination [,]. (d) The JA-signaling pathway is subjected to feedback regulation
  by a CUL3BPM E3 ligase system. The BPM proteins interact with MYC2, 3, and 4 and
  associate these proteins with the CUL3 BPM E3 ligase complex for ubiquitination
  and subsequent breakdown. This process leads to the transcription repression of
  the downstream JA-responsive genes []. Bars show repression, and L-bars indicate
  repression of gene transcription. Cross indicates the inability of proteins to bind
