caption: A hypothetical model of p53 transcriptional activity control by TAZ. When
  the Hippo pathway is activated, TAZ is phosphorylated by its upstream kinases, MST1/2
  and LATS1/2. As a result, TAZ is either degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system
  or bound to 14-3-3 and sequestered in the cytoplasm (left). However, mutations in
  or the altered expression of MST1/2 and LATS1/2 lead to increased TAZ nuclear localization
  and activation in cancer cells. Nuclear TAZ suppresses binding between p53 and p300,
  thereby inhibiting the p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Consequently, TAZ negatively
  regulates p53 functions by inhibiting p53 transcriptional activity and positively
  enhances cell proliferation (right).
