caption: 'Example of using “Effect on Metabolism” tool to see the overall proteome
  result mapped on carbon fixation metabolism. Note: Numbers in blue, red (not shown
  in this figure) and green (not shown in this figure) represent proteins found under
  temperature down-shift, up-shift and both up/down-shift conditions, respectively.
  (The pathway image files were generated from KEGG’s Color Pathway tool by inputting
  our lists of differentially expressed proteins)'
