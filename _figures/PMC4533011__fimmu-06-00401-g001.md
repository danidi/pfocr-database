caption: iNKT cell activation pathways in sepsis. Early in the course of the host
  response to bacterial pathogens involved in sepsis, the engulfment of these microbes
  by phagocytic cells generates pathogen-derived glycolipids that can be displayed
  by CD1d to induce iNKT cell activation. Phagocytic cells that have taken up bacteria
  and/or sensed PAMPs (e.g., LPS) through PRRs (e.g., TLR-4) secrete inflammatory
  cytokines. Some of these cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6) are responsible for
  clinical manifestations of sepsis, while others (i.e., IL-12 and IL-18) can activate
  iNKT cells. The latter pathway often, but not always, requires CD1d-mediated presentation
  of endogenous glycolipids to iNKT cells. SAg-secreting bacteria, such as Staphylococcus
  spp. and Streptococcus spp. participating in Gram-positive bacterial sepsis, can
  directly activate iNKT cells. It is possible that bacterial PAMPs may be detected
  by iNKT cells. Finally, during or as a result of the septic insult, host cell damage
  leads to release and/or modification of endogenous glycolipids that can be potentially
  presented by CD1d to trigger iNKT cell activation in an iTCR-dependent manner. Once
  activated, iNKT cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably IFN-γ that
  plays a pivotal role in sepsis-inflicted immunopathology. APC, antigen-presenting
  cell; CD, cluster of differentiation; DC, dendritic cell; IFN, interferon; IL, interleukin;
  iNKT, invariant natural killer T cell; iTCR, invariant T cell receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide;
