caption: Homeostatic and leukemic expression of receptors, signaling proteins, and
  transcription factors along the B cell pathway. Developmental stages are indicated
  starting with the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), the common lymphoid progenitor
  (CLP), and into the B cell pathway, stages proB, preB, and mature B cells. Normal
  gene expression along the developmental pathway is indicated with blue bars, and
  expression dependency between proteins is indicated with arrows. Most common modified
  forms of these receptors, signaling proteins, and transcription factors associated
  with acute lymphoblastic leukemia are also indicated.
