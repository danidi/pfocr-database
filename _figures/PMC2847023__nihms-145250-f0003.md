caption: At later stages of 1,25(OH)2D3-induced monocytic differentiation there is
  increased expression of the transcription factor C/EBPβ. C/EBPβ is then phosphorylated
  and translocates to the cell nucleus, where it regulates many differentiation-related
  genes. Activation of the Ras-Raf-ERK1 signal transduction pathway may contribute
  to increases in the cyclic dependent kinase inhibitors p21CIP-1/waf-1 and p27KIP-1,
  which causes cell cycle arrest. Activated Akt (pAkt) may inhibit the activation
  of ERK by binding to Raf. Increases in the cyclic dependent kinase inhibitors appear
  to be reversed by high levels of either miR-181a.
