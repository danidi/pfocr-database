caption: Structure and biosynthetic pathways of glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatin
  (PC). Three-letter abbreviations correspond to amino acid codes. (A) The biosynthetic
  pathway of GSH and PC consists of two and three reactions, respectively. First,
  a cysteine unit binds to the carboxylic group of the side chain of glutamic acid
  residue to form γ-glutamylcysteine, and this reaction is catalyzed by glutamate–cysteine
  ligase (GCL), then γ-glutamylcysteine binds to a glycine residue to form glutathione,
  and glutathione synthetase (GSHS) catalyses this reaction. PC-synthase (PCS) might
  then bind two or more GSH units to form phytochelatins. (B) Example of PC–metal
  complexes for divalent cations. M2+ denotes bivalent metal cations, whereas cysteine
  residues are indicated in red.
