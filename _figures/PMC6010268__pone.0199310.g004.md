caption: Biochemical components of glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the
  hexosamine pathway altered when bovine blastocysts were cultured in the presence
  of 3 mM (compared of 0 mM) glucose. Metabolites shown in green decreased and those
  in red increased in blastocysts exposed to 3 mM glucose, or in medium conditioned
  by these blastocysts, compared to control conditions (without glucose).
