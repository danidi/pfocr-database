caption: A murine model of the multiple actions to suppress immune surveillance of
  exosomes released from neoplastic cells. Exosomes reduce APCs (i.e., mature DCs),
  and the activity and/or proliferation of NK and T cells. In addition, cells that
  suppress the immune system, including Treg, MDSCs, and CD14+, HLA-DR–/low are increased
  in number and/or activity via the actions of exosomes. Overall these actions reduce
  the cytotoxicity against tumor cells of the immune system.
