caption: When LPS binds to TLR4 in the cell membrane, the resulting complex can lead
  to the activation of adaptor proteins including MyD88 and TIR-domain-containing
  adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF). NF-κB is phosphorylated and translocated into
  the nucleus by adaptor proteins. MyD88 and TRIF phosphorylate members of the MAPK
  pathway, and the MAPK family protein translocates transcription factors related
  to the inflammatory response into the nucleus. These translocated factors upregulate
  the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and COX-2. However, EPS could inhibit
  the LPS-induced inflammatory response by downregulating TLR4. EPS also repressed
  the expression of iNOS, which led to oxidative stress by upregulating the NRF2/HO-1
  pathways. Nevertheless, more research is required to elucidate how EPS regulates
  the expression of TLR4.
