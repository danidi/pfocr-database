caption: Ligation of PD-1 that is expressed in activated T cells by PD-L1 expressed
  on antigen-presenting cells, nonhematopoietic parenchymal cells, or tumors alters
  T-cell metabolic reprogramming by inhibiting glycolysis, amino acid metabolism,
  and mitochondrial metabolism and promoting the accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty
  acids (PUFA) and activation of fatty acid oxidation (Panel A). By restraining T
  cells from remodeling their metabolism properly, PD-1 may alter T-cell differentiation,
  leading to impaired differentiation of T effector cells (TEFF) and T memory cells
  (TM) and enhanced differentiation of T regulatory cells (Treg) and T exhausted cells
  (TEX). PD-L1 functions as an inhibitory receptor to transmit antiapoptotic signals
  to cancer cells (Panel B). Because cancer cells are highly glycolytic and have enhanced
  activation of the PI3K–Akt pathway, expression of PD-L1 might result in increased
  levels of PI3K–Akt–mTOR activation and an elevated rate of tumor-intrinsic glycolysis
  as a consequence of improved survival.
