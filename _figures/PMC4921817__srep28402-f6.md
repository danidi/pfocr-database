caption: Working model for the regulation of early embryo cleavage by SLC26A3 and
  SLC26A6 in CFTR/HCO3−-dependent activation of miR-125b. The HCO3− influx is mediated
  by SLC26A3 and SLC26A6 with an exchange of 2Cl−/ HCO3−. Apart from its reported
  role in conducting HCO3− directly, CFTR act as a Cl− channel to provide a recycling
  pathway for Cl− that is required for SLC26A3 and SLC26A6 function. The sites of
  action for inhibitors CFTRinh172, niflumate, and DIDS, as well as the intracellular
  HCO3−-dependent events, are also shown. HCO3− influx mediated by the cooperative
  action of SLC26A3, SLC26A6 and CFTR activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) which
  increase the level of cAMP. This in turn activates PKA/NFkB signaling cascade which
  increases the expression of miR125b. Expression of miR125b is required for embryo
  cleavage through suppressing the expression of p53 and p21. Vm, membrane potential;
  [pH]i, intracellular pH.
