caption: The experimental procedure and the mechanism by which the ASC-secretome promotes
  liver regeneration. The model of liver ischaemia-reperfusion combined with partial
  hepatectomy was established by laparoscopy. The ASC-secretome of miniature pigs
  was prepared and injected into the liver parenchyma immediately after the operation.
  The ASC-secretome exerted obvious anti-inflammatory and liver regenerative effects.
  The mechanism may be as shown in Fig. 5. After partial hepatectomy, the STAT3 signalling
  pathway was activated to promote the proliferation of hepatocytes. Furthermore,
  a SOCS3 negative feedback loop was activated to terminate the STAT3 signalling cascade.
  The ASC-secretome acted on SOCS3 to reduce its expression and interrupted the negative
  feedback regulation of the STAT3 signalling pathway, accelerating the process of
  liver regeneration. Cytokines in the ASC-secretome regulate inflammation and promote
  liver regeneration.
