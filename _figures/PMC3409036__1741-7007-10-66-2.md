caption: Sulfa drugs strike more than once in the folate biosynthetic pathway. Dihydropteroate
  synthase catalyzes the condensation of dihydropterin pyrophosphate and pABA to form
  dihydropteroate. Glutamate chain length depends on the cellular role of the folate
  derivative, and the final tetrahydrofolate product may have from one to six Glu
  residues. As indicated by the red lines, sulfa drugs (such as sulfamethoxazole,
  SMX) block folate production at the dihydropteroate synthase step by competing with
  pABA, and by acting as a substrate itself. The resulting sulfa-DHP derivative is
  an additional folate biosynthesis inhibitor, competing against dihydrofolate (DHF)
  for reduction by dihydrofolate reductase. E. coli are capable of transporting and
  hydrolyzing pABA-glu (a folate breakdown product) to produce free pABA and glutamate
  for de novo folate synthesis [].
