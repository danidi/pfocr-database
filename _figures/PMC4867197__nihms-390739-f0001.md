caption: The JAK/STAT signaling pathway. After cytokine binding to the cytokine receptor,
  JAK becomes activated and phosphorylates tyrosine residues of the cytokine receptor
  to create docking sites for STAT. After STAT phosphorylation and activation, STATs
  form dimers and translocate into the nucleus where they activate the transcription
  of target genes. STATs are negatively regulated by several mechanisms such as SOCS
  and PIAS. SOCS = suppressors of cytokine signaling; PIAS = protein inhibitors of
  activated STAT. (Color version of figure is available online.)
