caption: The ssDNA at sites of damage is coated by Replication protein A (RPA) and
  recruits ATR through a direct interaction with the ATR interacting protein (ATRIP).
  This RPA coated ssDNA also promotes the loading of the 9-1-1 (Rad9-Rad1-Hus1) checkpoint
  clamp by Rad17 onto the junction of the ss/dsDNA. TopBP1 is recruited via an interaction
  with the phosphorylated C-terminal tail of Rad9. TopBP1 then activates ATR kinase
  activity resulting in phosphorylation of Chk1, which is promoted by Claspin.
