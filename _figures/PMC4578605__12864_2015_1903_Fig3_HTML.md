caption: 'Depletion of Pkh affects glycogen metabolism. The complete glycogen and
  trehalose biosynthesis pathways, based on Yeast Biochemical Pathway Database (YeastCyc)
  at the SGD []. Numbers indicate the –fold induction of the specified genes in SDP8
  when incubated in the presence of 100 μg/ml doxycycline for 8 and 24 h when compared
  to CML476 wild-type cells under the same treatment. Genes considered up-regulated
  are denoted in red. ND: no valid data were obtained'
