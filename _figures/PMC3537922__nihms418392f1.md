caption: In responds to specific ligands for TLR3, TLR4, or DDX1-DDX21-DX36 (DExD/H-box
  helicase) complexes, an adaptor protein TRIF activates the transcription factors,
  IRF3, NF-κB and AP-1 to induce various genes. A dsRNA virus is recognized by TLR3
  in endosome or DExD/H-box helicase complex in cytosol. TRL3 is located in endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and move to the endosome membrane through UNC93B1. On the other hand,
  recognition of Gram-negative bacterial LPS induces TLR4 homodimerization, which
  transmits the signal through MyD88 and TRIF. During this transmission, TLR4 interacts
  with TRIF using TRAM. These interactions between TLR3 or TLR4-TRAM with TRIF are
  madiated thorough TIR:TIR hemophilic interactions, which leads to the oligomerization
  of TRIF. Activated TRIF then binds to TRAF3, leading to self ubiquitination, which
  is capable to adapt the scaffolding proteins NAP and/or TANK. In addition, an essential
  IRF kinase TBK1 is recruited to TRIF-TRAF3 complex that phosphorylate IRF3, resulting
  in nuclear translocation of IRF3. On the other hand, RIP1 associates with TRIF through
  RHIM:RHIM hemophilic interactions that is mediated by polyubiquitin by TRAF6. During
  K63 linked ubiqutinilation, RIP1 binds to IKKγ and TAK1, leading to phosphorylation
  of IKKβ. Activated IKKβ induces degradation of IKBα that allows translocation of
  NF-κB heterodimer complex of p50 and p65 to the nucleous. Meantime, TAK1 also binds
  to MAPKs and activate AP-1 transcription. Transcriptional activation of IRF-3 together
  with activated of NF-κB and AP-1 induces type I IFNs and other proinflmmatory cytokines
  and chemokines. In addition to the gene expression, TRIF signaling induces cellular
  apoptosis through RIP1-induced caspase-8 pathway and necrosis thrugh RIP3 by reactive
  oxigen species (ROS) accumulation. TRIF also interacts with small GTPases that regulate
  the surface expression of costimulatory molecues and MHC class II in professional
  APCs.
