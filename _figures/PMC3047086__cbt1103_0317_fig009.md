caption: Suggested modes of the involvement of Nrf2/ARE in the regulation of AML cell
  differentiation. Plant antioxidants, e.g., CA activate Nrf2 by releasing it from
  the inhibitory partner, Keap-1. As a result, Nrf2 binds to ARE sequences and heterodimerizes
  with small Maf proteins leading to the induction of phase II enzymes and other redox
  regulators, e.g., γGCS, responsible for glutathione synthesis, and thioredoxin.
  1,25D can further activate the Nrf2/ARE pathway, possibly by post-transcriptionally
  activating Nrf2 via phosphorylation by signaling protein kinases (PKC, MAPKs and/or
  PI-3-K). In addition, 1,25D can probably further enhance γGCS expression by Nrf2/ARE-independent
  mechanism. The resulting generation of reducing conditions can increase the activity
  of AP-1 by maintaining the cysteine residues (C in KCR) in their reduced (SH) form,
  which is required for DNA binding. Ref-1 is a redox regulator. KCR is a tripeptide
  in the DNA binding region of both Jun and Fos. Our data indicate that Nrf2 can also
  positively regulate the expression AP-1 family proteins (cJun, cFos and ATF-2),
  further upregulating the AP-1 functional activity. Activated AP-1 can increase the
  expression of VDR and, perhaps, RXRα, resulting in the enhancement of the transcriptional
  activity of VDR/RXRα complex. A possibility exists that Nrf2 may also facilitate
  VDR and RXRα expression in an AP-1-inependent manner. Eventually, the enhancement
  of VDR function by 1,25D/CA is likely to increase the sensitivity of AML cells to
  the differentiation-inducing effects of lower concentrations of 1,25D.
