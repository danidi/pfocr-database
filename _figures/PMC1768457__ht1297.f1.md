caption: 'CD14/toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) intracellular signalling complex: lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) binds to serum LPS binding protein (LBP) and is transferred to the glycosyl
  phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linked CD14 receptor, which interacts with the signalling
  receptor TLR4 and the accessory protein MD-2. Leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in the
  extracellular domain of toll family proteins have been implicated in the recognition
  of pathogens. LPS stimulates the activation of various mitogen activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) pathways, such as extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38. These pathways activate various transcription
  factors, including Elk-1, c-Jun, c-Fos, activating transcription factor 1 (ATF-1),
  ATF-2, serum response factor, and cAMP response element binding protein. In addition,
  LPS activates the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway through myeloid differentiation
  protein 88 (MyD88), interleukin 1 (IL-1) receptor associated kinase (IRAK), and
  tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Activated inhibitory
  κB kinase β(IKKβ) phosphorylates inhibitory κB (IκB) and permits nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB/Rel complexes, such as p50/p65. LPS stimulation of monocytes/macrophages
  induces many inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6,
  and granulocyte, macrophage, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulation factors),
  adhesion molecules (E selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell
  adhesion molecule 1), chemokines (IL-8, macrophage chemotactic protein 1), receptors
  (tissue factor, IL-2Rα), and inflammatory enzymes (inducible nitric oxide synthase
  and cyclo-oxygenase 2, etc). AP-1, activating protein 1; CRE, cAMP response element;
  SRE, serum response element.'
