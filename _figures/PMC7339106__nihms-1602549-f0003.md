caption: Cancer cells are known to recruit myeloid cells to the tumor microenvironment
  through the secretion of myeloid cell growth factors such as M-CSF-1. When the CD200-CD200R
  axis is intact (left panel), tumor expressed CD200 can inhibit myeloid cell expansion
  via interaction with CD200R. In the absence of CD200-CD200R interaction (right panel),
  significant expansion of myeloid cells occur. However, the types of myeloid cells
  that expand may depend on available factors driving myeloid cell differentiation
  in the tumor microenvironment.
