caption: Extrinsic apoptosis execution. Extrinsic apoptosis is a receptor mediated
  process for programmed cell death. The Type I/II phenotypes for the extrinsic apoptosis
  system were first described by . In that work they examined several cell lines and
  classified them into those that required the mitochondrial pathway to achieve apoptosis
  (Type II) and those that do not (Type I). They made several interesting conclusions.
  They found that Type II cells had relatively weak DISC formation, that both phenotypes
  responded equally well to receptor mediated cell death, that there was a delay in
  caspase activation in Type II cells, and that caspase activation happened upstream
  of mitochondrial activation in Type I cells and downstream in Type II. More recently,
  XIAP has also been put forth as a critical regulator in the choice of apoptotic
  phenotype. In  they examined hepatocytes (Type II cells) and lymphocytes (Type I
  cells) under different conditions to examine the role XIAP plays in Type I/II determination.
  They made several observations upon Fas ligand or Fas-antibody induced apoptosis
  such as higher levels of XIAP in Type II cells and higher caspase effector activity
  in XIAP/Bid deficient mice versus apoptosis resistant Bid-only knockouts. In all,
  they concluded that XIAP is the key regulator that determines the choice of pathway.
  Extrinsic apoptosis is initiated when a death inducing member of the tumor necrosis
  factor (TNF) superfamily of receptors (FasR, TNFR1, etc.) is bound by its respective
  ligand (FasL, TNF-α, etc.), setting off a sequence biochemical events that result
  in the orderly deconstruction of the cell (). The first stage of this sequence is
  the assembly of the DISC at the cell membrane ① and the subsequent activation of
  Caspase-8. Upon ligand binding and oligomerization of a receptor such as FasR or
  TRAIL, an adapter protein, like FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain),
  is recruited to the receptors cytoplasmic tail (; ; ). FADD, in turn, recruits Caspase-8
  via their respective death effector domains (DEDs), thus completing DISC formation
  (; ). Other DISC components could also be included here, such as the regulator cFlip
  (). Once recruited, proximal Procaspase-8 monomers dimerize, inducing their autoproteolytic
  activity and producing active Caspase-8 (; ; ). After Caspase-8 activation the apoptotic
  signal can progress down two distinct pathways that both lead to the activation
  of Caspase-3 and the ensuing proteolysis of downstream targets. One pathway consists
  of a caspase cascade in which active Caspase-8 directly cleaves and activates Caspase-3
  ② (), while another, more complex pathway is routed through the mitochondria. In
  the mitochondrial pathway Caspase-8 cleaves the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein
  Bid in the cytosol, which then migrates to the mitochondria ③ where it initiates
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and the release of pro-apoptotic
  factors that lead to Caspase-3 activation (; ). MOMP has its own set of regulators
  that govern the strength of apoptotic signaling through the mitochondria ④. After
  Caspase-8 activated Bid, (tBid), migrates to the mitochondria it activates proteins
  in the outer mitochondrial membrane, such as Bax, that subsequently self-aggregate
  into membrane pores and allow exportation of Cytochrome-c and Smac/DIABLO to the
  cytosol (). Bid and Bax are examples of pro-apoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 family,
  all of which share BH domain homology (). Other members of this family act as MOMP
  regulators; the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, for example, binds and inhibits both Bid and
  Bax while the pro-apoptotic Bad similarly binds and inhibits its target, Bcl-2 (;
  ; ; ). Many other pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family have been
  discovered and together regulate MOMP (). Regardless of which pathway is chosen,
  the intermediate results are Caspase-3 activation and subsequent cleavage of PARP
  ⑧, a proxy for cell death in the analyses here (; ). XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of
  apoptosis protein) is an inhibitor of Caspase-3 and has been proposed to be a key
  regulator in determining the Type I/II apoptotic phenotype of a cell (). XIAP sequesters
  Caspase-3 but also contains a ubiquitin ligase domain that directly targets Caspase-3
  for degradation. The inhibitor also sequesters and inhibits the Caspase-3 activating
  Caspase-9 residing within the apoptosome complex (; ; ). Apoptosome formation is
  initiated by Cytochrome-c exported from the mitochondria during MOMP ⑤. Cytochrome-c
  induces the protein APAF-1 to oligomerize and subsequently recruit and activate
  Caspase-9, thus forming the complex (). Another MOMP export, the protein Smac/DIABLO
  ⑥, binds and inhibits XIAP, working in tandem with Cytochrome-c to oppose XIAP and
  carry out the apoptosis inducing activity of the Type II pathway (). Finally, Procaspase/Caspase-6
  constitutes a feed forward loop between Caspase-3 and Caspase-8 ⑦ ().
