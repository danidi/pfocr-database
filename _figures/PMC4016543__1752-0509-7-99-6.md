caption: Proposed purine degradation pathway in Rubrobacter xylanophilus. The proposed
  reaction degrading allantoate to S-ureidoglycine and carbamoyl phosphate is in black.
  The reactions that are presumed to be catalyzed by the neighbouring genes (Rxyl_2848
  and Rxyl_2849) are written in light gray. The encircled P stands for phosphate,
  Pi for inorganic phosphate.
