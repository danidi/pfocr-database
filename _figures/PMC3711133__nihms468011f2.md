caption: A, Depiction of the domain organization of the αIIb and β3 subunits in an
  extended conformation. B, Pathway for activation of αIIbβ3. Inside-out signaling
  can be induced by different agonists, usually binding to a G-protein coupled receptor,
  which initiate signaling pathways that lead to the cytoplasmic tails of αIIbβ3.
  Inside-out signaling to activate the receptor begins with unclasping of the membrane
  proximal complex between the αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic tails. Talin and kindlin cooperate
  in this activation process. Their separation triggers dissociation of the transmembrane
  complex of the subunits. These changes then trigger a conformational switch in the
  integrin extracellular domain, resulting in its conversion from a bent conformation
  in its resting state to an extended conformation in which it becomes competent to
  bind soluble ligands. The subsequent outside-in signaling initiated by ligand binding
  is transmitted back to the cytoplasmic tails to trigger intracellular responses.
  Portions of this figure are adapted from reference . EGF indicates epidermal growth
  factor; MIDAS, metal ion–dependent adhesion site; and PSI, plexin-semaphorin-integrin.
