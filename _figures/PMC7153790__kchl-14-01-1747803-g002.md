caption: Effect of TRPV1 on the proliferation of VSMCs and the formation of smooth
  muscle cell-derived foam cells. Activation of TRPV1 channels in smooth muscle cells
  can increase Ca2+ inflow, increase the expression of ATP binding box transporter
  A1 (ABCA1, cholesterol efflux regulatory protein) and reduce the expression of low-density
  lipoprotein-related protein 1 (LRP 1, cholesterol inflow regulator protein) through
  CaM- and PKA-dependent mechanisms to promote the outflow of LDL and reduce VSMC
  lipid storage. It can also activate the autophagy-lysosomal pathway of VSMCs through
  the AMPK signaling pathway to recover autophagy damage by ox-LDL and ultimately
  inhibit the formation of foam cells. In addition, activation of TRPV1 can inhibit
  the proliferation of VSMCs through the cAMP/PKA pathway, and NO can enhance this
  effect by increasing the cAMP level. TRPV1 activation can inhibit the proliferation
  and migration of VSMCs by activating the antigrowth adenosine 5ʹ-monophosphate-activated
  protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. It can also inhibit the Ang II-induced
  proliferation and migration of VSMCs by deactivating the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR)-ERK 1/2 pathway.
