caption: Consensus model of the signal transduction pathway of pancreatic β-cells.
  Metabolism–secretion coupling of β-cells requires the sequential activation of glycolysis,
  mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and Ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane. Glucose
  stimulates glycolysis and pyruvate production. Pyruvate triggers mitochondrial metabolism
  and the formation of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH
  (by the TCA cycle), which is the fuel for the respiratory complexes (1,2,3,4), enabling
  ATP production by ATP-synthase (5). ATP inhibits the KATP channel, inducing membrane
  depolarization (ΔΨ↓) and Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, promoting
  insulin secretion. Ca2+ is taken up in parallel by mitochondria via the mitochondrial
  Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and facilitates sustained insulin secretion. The amplifying
  pathway of metabolism–secretion coupling is co-generated by additive coupling factors.
  Additional players contributing to Ca2+ homeostasis are mentioned in the main text.
