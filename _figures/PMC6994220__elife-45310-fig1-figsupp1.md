caption: '(A) A pathway for cis-carotene and xanthophyll synthesis. Tri-cis-ζ-carotene
  and tetra-cis-lycopene are isomerised by ZISO and CRTISO to form di-cis-ζ-carotene
  and lycopene, respectively. ziso and ccr2 mutants accumulate cis-carotenes (; ).
  In the light, photoisomerisation facilitates cis-carotene isomerisation. Norflurazon
  (NF) inhibits PDS activity. CAROTENOID CLEAVAGE DIOXYGENASE (CCD) activity may cleave
  cis-carotenes to generate an apocarotenoid signal (ACS) (; ; ; ). Chemical treatment
  of seedlings with D15 can inhibit CCD activity and enhance carotenoid accumulation
  (). Mutants that block the production of lutein (lut2; lutein-deficient 2), strigolactone
  (max4-3; more axillary branching 4) and abscisic acid (aba1-3; aba deficient 1)
  were utilised to interrogate the cause of the ccr2 leaf virescence phenotype. (B) Control
  of prolamellar body (PLB) formation and protein levels during skotomorphogenesis.
  DET1 acts as a repressor of photomorphogenesis in etiolated tissues to maintain
  high PIF3 and low HY5 protein levels, which reduce PHOTOSYNTHESIS ASSOCIATED NUCLEAR
  GENE (PhANG) expression. det1 mutants do not accumulate PORA and do not form a PLB
  within the etioplast. Upon de-etiolation, the protein levels DET1 and PIF3 decline
  and HY5 increases, which induces PhANG expression. Grey insert boxes digitally represent
  published western protein blots for PORA (), PIF3 () and HY5 () in WT and det1 mutant
  genotypes. Solid black and grey fills represents high and low protein expression,
  respectively. Green arrows and red lines represent positive and negative regulation,
  respectively. Abbreviations: GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; PSY, PHYTOENE SYNTHASE;
