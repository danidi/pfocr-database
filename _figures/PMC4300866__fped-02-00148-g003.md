caption: Structural subunits of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) and ficolins. Both MBL
  and ficolins contain a short N-terminal cysteine-rich region followed by a collagen-like
  sequence [length given in number of amino acids (aa)]. The C-terminal region is
  a carbohydrate-recognition binding domain for MBL (shown as oval forms) and a fibrinogen-like
  domain for ficolins (shown as tulip forms). The polypeptides interact through its
  collagen-like region forming triple helices (trimers), which further associate into
  higher oligomeric arrangements (tetramers to hexamers). Despite the very different
  structures, ficolin polypeptides and trimers interact in the same way as MBL, forming
  high oligomeric forms (tetramers). MBL-associated serine proteases interact with
  the collagen-like region, thereby activating the lectin pathway of complement.
