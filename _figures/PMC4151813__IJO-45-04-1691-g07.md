caption: A diagram represents the model for the FOXO3-dependent anticancer function
  of auranofin. A schematic shows that auranofin inhibits IKK-β and leads to FOXO3
  translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to upregulate the expression of
  Bax and Bim pro-apoptotic proteins, as well as to downregulate of the expression
  of Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic protein. In addition, auranofin induces the activation of
  caspase-3 protein in a FOXO3-dependent manner. As a result of this FOXO3-mediated
  apoptotic pathway, auranofin promotes cancer cell apoptosis.
