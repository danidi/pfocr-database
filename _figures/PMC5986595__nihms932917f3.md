caption: (A) FoxOs mainly function as tumor suppressors, and inhibit tumor development
  through repressing various hallmarks of cancer. (B) In certain contexts, FoxOs can
  also promote tumor growth by maintaining cancer stem cells, inducing drug resistance,
  and reactivating the PI3K-AKT pathway.
