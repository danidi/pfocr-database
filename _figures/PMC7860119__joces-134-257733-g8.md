caption: Model for modes of surface protein regulation in response to glucose. Schematic
  diagram shows the regulation of cell surface membrane protein cargoes in response
  to glucose starvation. When cells have access to glucose for maximal growth, internalisation
  occurs at a basal level through Mig1 (and Mig2) repression of endocytic adaptor
  genes YAP1801/YAP1802. Whilst resident at the surface, nutrient transporters diffuse
  in and out of eisosomes. The expression of many eisosome genes are repressed in
  glucose conditions (left). Following glucose starvation, Mig1 translocates from
  the nucleus, resulting in increased expression of YAP1801/YAP1802, which triggers
  increased cargo endocytosis and ubiquitin-mediated trafficking through the multivesicular
  body (MVB) pathway to the lysosome for degradation (right). Although most nutrient
  transporters are degraded following glucose starvation, a small reserve pool is
  sequestered in eisosomes, which are transcriptionally activated during starvation.
  Efficient cargo retention relies on Ygr130c, and eisosomes that specifically retain
  cargo during glucose starvation exhibit biochemical and biophysical changes in Pil1.
  This reserve pool of eisosomally retained nutrient transporters can be deployed
  upon a return to glucose-replete conditions for efficient recovery following the
  period of glucose starvation.
