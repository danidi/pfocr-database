caption: The enrichment map of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the GABA shunt, and the
  urea cycle intermediates in bone marrow-derived macrophages from young mice in response
  to (A) 16 hr LPS stimulation, (B) “recovery”, and (C) “tolerance” as compared to
  unstimulated macrophages. The network of metabolite interactions was built based
  on the BioCyc database and pathway published from Jha et al. The node size is proportional
  to the significance of metabolite changes compared to the control. The colors of
  the nodes indicate the log2(fold changes) of metabolite levels of each experimental
  condition compared to the control with a decrease colored in red and an increase
  colored in blue. Acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA and succinic semialdehyde are not detected
  and therefore are labelled in grey. The glycolysis pathway is labelled in orange;
  the TCA cycle is labelled in blue; the GABA shunt is labelled in green; the glutamate-argininosuccinate
  shunt is labelled in red; the urea cycle is labelled in purple.
