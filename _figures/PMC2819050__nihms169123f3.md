caption: 'This model illustrates the circadian rhythm in chicken cone photoreceptors.
  Light and dark (day and night) signals from the environment enter the photoreceptor
  through CNGCs, which are essential in phototransduction. The light/dark signals
  through the ‘circadian input’ pathway entrain the photoreceptor core oscillator
  that cause the photoreceptor to be synchronized with the environment. From the core
  oscillator through the ‘circadian output,’ the activities of different molecules,
  including CNGCs, L-VGCCs, and retinoschisin are under circadian regulation, and
  the ‘circadian output’ is composed of a series of signaling pathways. Calcium influx
  through L-VGCCs causes changes in the signaling involved in the ‘circadian input’
  pathway that regulates the core oscillator genes and cAMP signaling, and further
  regulates the gene and protein expression of AANAT and melatonin production (as
  indicated by the red dotted arrows). The circadian regulation of CNGCs and L-VGCCs
  in retinal photoreceptors represents an adaptation to enhance the stability of retinal
  circadian oscillators. It demonstrates a model that  presented, in which the elements
  that lead to entrainment or modulation of the core oscillators (e.g. CNGCs and L-VGCCs)
  can themselves be regulated by the oscillators. One feature of this model is that
  it contains additional feedback loops that can markedly enhance the stability of
  the overall oscillator system at the cellular level (photoreceptors only) and maybe
  at the retinal network level (the retinal oscillators). Dotted arrows indicate multiple
  steps currently not known, while the solid arrows represent known signaling. The
  Ras, Erk, and CaMKII signaling pathway serves as a common circadian output to regulate
  the circadian rhythms of CNGCs, L-VGCCs, and retinoschisin in photoreceptors. The
  circadian regulation of CNGCs involves tyrosine phosphorylation on an auxiliary
  subunit, in which the phosphorylation is high during the day corresponding to when
  CNGCs have a lower affinity to cGMP. The circadian phase-dependent regulation of
  CNGCs by dopamine and somatostatin is represented by brown and purple dotted arrows,
  respectively. The circadian regulation of L-VGCCs involves the regulation of L-VGCCα1
  mRNA and protein expression, as well as the plasma membrane insertion and retention
