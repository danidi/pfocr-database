caption: Metabolic feedback loops affecting gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
  Acetyl-CoA is used by the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and the type II fatty acid
  synthase (FAS), which provides the substrate for lipoate synthesis. The lipoate
  synthesis pathway proteins Lip2, Lip3, and Lip5 and the H protein (Gcv3) are required
  for activation of the lipoate-dependent complexes PDH, KDH, and GCV. An unidentified
  product of the FAS is required for activation of the ribonucleoprotein RNase P and
  the processing of RNase P component RPM1 itself. RNase P activation results in efficient
  processing of RNAs, affecting mitochondrial gene expression. Proteins are colored
  in blue and RNA in green. Red dotted arrows indicate activation steps.
