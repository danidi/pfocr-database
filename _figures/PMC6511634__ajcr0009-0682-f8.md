caption: Schematic illustration for the potential mechanisms of PC4 in AIPC progression.
  In AIPC, PC4 can promote the expression of HIF-1α and enhance β-catenin signaling.
  On one hand, β-catenin activates c-Myc and modulates p21 mediated cyclin-dependent
  kinase-pRb pathway, that accelerates G1/S phase transition to promote cell proliferation
  in AIPC. On other hand, β-catenin regulates the EMT-related gene and promotes metastasis
  in AIPC.
