caption: 'Among downstream products of COX-2 pathway, PGI is generally considered
  to have cytoprotection effects, and the imbalance of PGI/TxA2 in favor of the latter
  is one of critical mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of cancer, inflammatory disease
  and vascular disorders. The role of PGES/PGE2 is to some extent controversial, as
  PGE2 has both pro-inflammatory and immunosuppression effects depending on cell context.
  TxA2 acts through binding with TxA2 receptor (TP), thereby exerting promoting effects
  for tumor growth, inflammation and angiogenesis. Licorice and its active components
  GL and GA are considered to hold anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties through
  targeting the COX-2/TxA2 pathway. For example, GA inhibits lung tumor growth through
  suppressing expression and activity of COX-2 and TxAS and the downstream ERK/CREB
  signaling (Ref.). Abbreviations: COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; PGH2, prostaglandin H2;
  PGE2, prostaglandin E2; PGI, prostacyclin; TxA2, thromboxane A2; PGES, prostaglandin
  E synthase; PGIS, prostacyclin synthase; TxAS, thromboxane A2 synthase.'
