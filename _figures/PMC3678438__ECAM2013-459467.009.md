caption: The diagram of the cell signaling pathway which was involved in NVU protection
  of XXMD against cerebral injury following focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion.
  Reperfusion after stroke induced dysfunction of PI3K/Akt pathway and the PI3K/Akt
  inhibition led to dephosphorylation of PDK1, Akt, and GSK3β degradation, resulting
  in apoptosis. However, XXMD treatment inhibited apoptosis of different cells in
  NVU and increased expression levels of p-PTEN, p-PDK1, p-Akt, and p-GSK3β. Furthermore,
  PI3K/Akt pathway is associated with Ras/MAPK pathway. In the present study, we also
  found that XXMD upregulated the level of p-c-raf. Above all, all the observations
  in the study indicated that XXMD may exert its NVU protection partly through the
  activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.
