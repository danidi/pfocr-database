caption: In vitro- At a low concentration (10 μM) Resveratrol activates the MAPK signalling
  pathway with a subsequent increase in the expression of p-CREB leading to proliferation,
  cell survival and differentiation. Resveratrol also independently activates SIRT1
  proteins implicated in lifespan extension. However higher doses (>20 μM) inhibit
  the phosphorylation of the MAPK molecules with a parallel activation of activated
  caspase-3 inducing the apoptosis pathway. In vivo- The crosstalk between TrkA and
  p75NTR ligand has a complex role in regulating neural survival and death. Classic
  signaling modules, such as the MAPK cascade have been identified as downstream cellular
  events induced by TrkA activation. In aged rats decreased phosphorylation of TrkA
  is observed with a parallel increase in the expression of the death receptor p75NTR
  leading to neuronal cell death. Administration of Resveratrol (20 mg/kg body weight)
  turns the molecular switch around with an increase in phosphorylated levels of TrkA
  with a subsequent increase in MAPK and p-CREB leading to cell survival and maintenance.
  This is an original figure made by one of the co-authors Ankita Pandey for publication
  with this manuscript only.
