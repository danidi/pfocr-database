caption: A proposed model of the mechanism of ERK activation during CVB3 infection.
  CVB3 binds with its receptor and initiates early transient ERK phosphorylation.
  Virus replication mediates RasGAP cleavage, which triggers late-phase ERK phosphorylation.
  Subsequently, there is a positive feedback to augment ERK activation and viral replication.
