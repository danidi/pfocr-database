caption: TGFβ signal pathway can induce epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells by
  EMT, and mesenchymal cells show the potential of drug resistance and metastasis.
  In this study, miR-17, 20a, 20b can inhibit the TGFβ signal pathway by targeting
  TGFβR2, consequently, inhibition of miR-17, 20a, 20b can induce EMT and lead to
  cisplatin-resistant and migration in A549/DDP cells.
