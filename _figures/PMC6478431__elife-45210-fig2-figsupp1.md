caption: (A) Schematic representation of the expected metabolic activities of the
  pyrimidine and thiazole pathways for TPP biosynthesis in rich (LB, left) and minimal
  (GMM, right) media. Solid green lines indicate pathways with flux, whereas dashed
  gray lines represent pathways with low or no flux. Shaded circles represent molecules
  in the pathway. (B) Schematic representation of the expected metabolic flux of thiamin
  knockout strains grown in minimal medium. Other annotations are as described for
  panel A. (C) Reporter gene expression of WT B. subtilis cells and cells lacking
  the coding region for various thiamin biosynthesis genes grown in rich or minimal
  liquid media.
