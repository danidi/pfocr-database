caption: The compensatory model that is mediated by the Wnt signaling pathway and
  p53 in mESCs. Facing various stresses, p53 is activated and induces the production
  of Wnt ligands. Wnt ligands are secreted to delay the differentiation of neighboring
  cells in a paracrine manner, presumably giving them more time to divide and compensate
  the loss of stressed mESCs.
