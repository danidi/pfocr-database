caption: ROS, elicitor and hormone regulation of O3-induced CRKs. O3 enters the leaves
  through the stomata and immediately reacts with components of the cell wall to generate
  ROS. O3 and the ROS induce an active production of ROS in the apoplast which is
  at least partly depending on membrane bound NADPH oxidases (RBOH), which produce
  . Similar ROS production in the apoplast takes place after infection of a plant
  with a pathogen or treatments with pathogen derived elicitors (PAMPs). ROS is hypothetically
  perceived via a "ROS receptor" which could sense ROS directly via protein modification,
  or via sensing of modified apoplastic proteins or other molecules that react with
  ROS. The perception of ROS initiates down-stream signalling events. H2O2 is also
  able to cross the plasma membrane and enter the cells. Inside the cell, the signalling
  pathway is split into two pathways. In the ROS pathway DND1/CNGC2 mediates a required
  step of the signalling pathway and JA and ET act as positive regulators, and SA
  and NPR1 are negative regulators. In the SA pathway ROS or pathogens activate SA
  biosynthesis via ICS1; and NPR1 is a required component. Since NPR1 is a positive
  regulator of the SA pathway and a negative regulator of the ROS pathway this implies
  that the separate signalling pathway use different transcription factors and promoter
  elements to regulate CRK expression, although it might be possible that two different
  transcription factors could converge on the same promoter element. In addition the
  pleiotropic nature of the dnd1 mutant, including high SA-levels, could change the
  place of DND1/CNGC2 in the model - constitutive SA signalling in dnd1 may limit
  the possibility for O3 to activate the ROS pathway. Through the transcription factors
  EIN3 and EIL1 ET can repress SID2/ICS1 expression and SA levels. Increased ROS production
  in the chloroplast activates separate signalling pathway(s) leading to repression
  of CRK expression. One of these pathways could involve ABA and negative cross talk
  with the SA pathway.
