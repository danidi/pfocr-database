caption: Cytokine activation of the Jak–STAT pathway. Cytokine ligation and dimerization
  of plasma membrane receptors results in activation of receptor-associated Jak kinases
  and phosphorylation of receptor cytoplasmic domain tyrosine residues. STATs dock
  on these phosphotyrosine motifs by means of their Src homology 2 (SH2) domains.
  STATs are then phosphorylated on a conserved carboxy-terminus tyrosine, dimerize,
  and translocate to the nucleus to activate gene transcription. Transcriptional responses
  can be detected within a few minutes of receptor ligation. The use of a small number
  of protein:protein or protein:DNA interactions between the extracellular ligand
  and gene promoters allows specificity in signal transduction. Jak, Janus kinase;
  STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.
