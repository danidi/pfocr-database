caption: Hypothetical mechanism for the stimulation of the epidermal growth factor
  receptor (EGFR)/extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling
  pathway in cumulus cells of porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) derived from
  small follicles (< 4 mm). Intercellular communication between mural granulosa cells,
  cumulus cells, and oocytes occurs through paracrine and autocrine signals and gap
  junctional communication (GJ). In vivo, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) induces
  luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors (LHR) and EGFR that can be stimulated by LH and
  amphiregulin (AREG), epiregulin (EREG), and betacellulin (BTC), respectively. In
  vitro, developing oocytes cannot stimulate the EGFR/ERK1/2 pathway without the addition
  of dibutyryl cAMP sodium salt (dbcAMP) and oocyte-secreted factors (OSFs) leading
  to a low developmental competence of the oocyte. Addition of dbcAMP and OSFs, such
  as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP15) and growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9),
  in an AREG-stimulated IVM system promotes the EGFR/ERK1/2 signaling pathway, consequently
  with an improved developmental potential of the oocyte.
