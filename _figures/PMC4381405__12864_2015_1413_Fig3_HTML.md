caption: 'Predicted fatty acid and TAG biosynthetic pathways in P. fendleri seeds.
  Numbers after the gene are the numbers of isotigs for the corresponding genes in
  the 454 analysis of the seed cDNA library. The dashed arrows in the plastid fatty
  acid biosynthetic pathway indicate one or more cycles of acyl-chain elongation that
  is initiated by 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS) I or II. The yellow circle delineates
  reactions in acyl-CoA pools. The bright green rectangle delineates reactions involving
  desaturation or hydroxylation of PC. The acyl-CoA dependent Kennedy pathway is indicated
  with red arrows. PC-mediated TAG synthesis pathways are indicated with green (via
  PDAT), blue (via PDCT) and orange (via LPCAT) arrows. Abbreviations: BCCP, biotin
  carboxyl carrier protein subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase; BC, biotin carboxylase
  subunit of acetyl-CoA carboxylase; α-CT, α-carboxyltransferase subunit of acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; MCMT, malonly-CoA ACP transferase; KAR,
  3-ketoacyl-ACP reductase; HAD, 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dyhydratase; ER, 2-enoyl-ACP reductase;
  FAB2/SAD, stearoyl-ACP desaturase; FatA, acyl-ACP thioesterase A; FatB, acyl-ACP
  thioesterase B; LACS, long-chain acyl-CoA synthase; FAH12, Δ12 oleic acid hydroxylase;
