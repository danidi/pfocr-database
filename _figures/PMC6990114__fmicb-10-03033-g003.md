caption: Hippo pathway plays vital role in mammalian immune system. The Hippo core
  component MST1/2 and YAP can inhibit innate immunity caused by viral infection through
  the RIG-I/cGAS-TBK1/IKKε-IRF3 axis. IKKε promotes the degradation of YAP to activate
  cellular antiviral responses. Hippo pathway is also involved in adaptive immunity.
  MST1/2 enhances T cell migration by activating LFA-1 though DENND1C-RAB13 and VASP
  signaling, or via MST1-MOB1-Dock8-Rac1 axis. MST1/2 promotes regulatory T cell (Treg)
  differentiation by modulating the Foxp3 expression. YAP promotes the expression
  of Foxp3, whereas TAZ inhibits its function. Moreover, MST1/2 and/or NDR1/2 may
  inhibit the development of T cells.
