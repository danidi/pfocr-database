caption: 'Illustration of physiologic effects of genetic variants based on molecular
  systems commonly studied in systems biology. Groups of variants (a) directly affect
  regulatory (b) and proteomic (signaling) (c) machinery of the cell, leading to disruption
  in a metabolic pathway (d) that ultimately leads to a clinical trait (e) and the
  renal disease phenotype (f). Shown is a group of regulatory and non-synonymous SNPs
  and their effect: SNP A lies in the promoter region of a gene, modifying the binding
  characteristics of a transcription factor; similarly B modifies an enhancer or repressor
  for another gene; and C and D are non-synonymous, with C having an indirect regulatory
  effect because of its role as a transcription factor. The layers illustrate that
  different groups of variants may affect different parts of cellular physiology,
  but ultimately impact the same phenotype.'
