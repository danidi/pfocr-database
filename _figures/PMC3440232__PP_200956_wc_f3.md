caption: A, Downstream DELLA targets negatively regulated through confirmed protein-protein
  interactions with DELLA. B, Suggested model for DELLA modulation of PIF activity
  in response to light and the clock. In the night, GA and GID1 levels are highest,
  thus repressing DELLA’s ability to negatively regulate PIF. PIF mRNA levels rise
  during the night, leading to rapid hypocotyl growth before morning. At dawn, a drop
  in GID1 levels results in DELLA stabilization and repression of PIF, leading to
  greening and slower growth. In the day, red light actives Pfr, which phosphorylates
  PIF, leading to PIF destruction via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Lack of PIF
  blocks hypocotyl growth.
