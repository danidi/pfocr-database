caption: Model for repression of pathological cardiac gene expression by CRM1. Pathological
  cardiac hypertrophy can be triggered by a number of stress stimuli, including agonists
  that stimulate the α-adrenergic receptor (α-AR). Hypertrophic stimuli activate the
  Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates
  the NFAT transcription factor, driving it to the nucleus, where it stimulates pathological
  gene expression. Stress signals also stimulate the PKC/PKD pathway, resulting in
  phosphorylation of HDAC5, which normally binds to repress the function of the MEF2
  transcription factor. Phospho-HDAC5 is escorted from the nucleus via a CRM1-dependent
  pathway, freeing MEF2 to activate downstream target genes that promote pathological
  hypertrophy. CRM1 inhibitors such as LMB retain HDAC5 in the nucleus, thereby repressing
  MEF2-dependent transcription. Since MEF2 interacts with NFAT, nuclear retention
  of HDAC5 is also predicted to suppress NFAT target gene expression. Binding of the
  bioactive form of thyroid hormone (T3) to its receptor (TR) triggers expression
  of genes that are associated with increased cardiac contractility and nonpathological
  cardiac growth, including α-MyHC and SERCA. Nonpathological cardiac gene expression
  and growth can also be triggered by signaling via IGF receptor (IGF-R) and its downstream
  effectors, including the AKT kinase. These pathways for cardiac gene expression
  function independently of CRM1.

  description: Model for repression of pathological cardiac gene expression by CRM1.
    Pathological cardiac hypertrophy can be triggered by a number of stress stimuli,
    including agonists that stimulate the α-adrenergic receptor (α-AR). Hypertrophic
    stimuli activate the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin
    dephosphorylates the NFAT transcription factor, driving it to the nucleus, where
    it stimulates pathological gene expression. Stress signals also stimulate the
    PKC/PKD pathway, resulting in phosphorylation of HDAC5, which normally binds to
    repress the function of the MEF2 transcription factor. Phospho-HDAC5 is escorted
    from the nucleus via a CRM1-dependent pathway, freeing MEF2 to activate downstream
    target genes that promote pathological hypertrophy. CRM1 inhibitors such as LMB
    retain HDAC5 in the nucleus, thereby repressing MEF2-dependent transcription.
    Since MEF2 interacts with NFAT, nuclear retention of HDAC5 is also predicted to
    suppress NFAT target gene expression. Binding of the bioactive form of thyroid
    hormone (T3) to its receptor (TR) triggers expression of genes that are associated
    with increased cardiac contractility and nonpathological cardiac growth, including
    α-MyHC and SERCA. Nonpathological cardiac gene expression and growth can also
    be triggered by signaling via IGF receptor (IGF-R) and its downstream effectors,
    including the AKT kinase. These pathways for cardiac gene expression function
    independently of CRM1.
