number: Fig. 6
caption: 'Proposed similarities and differences in the maps of E. coli MG1655 and
  P. ananatis AJ13355 central carbon and ammonia metabolism based on the presence
  and absence of orthologous CDSs. The following color code was used: blue boxes,
  homologous CDSs; yellow boxes, CDSs in the P. ananatis genome that are not homologous
  in E. coli; orange box, CDS product that is active, due to the existence of the
  cofactor biosynthetic pathway in the P. ananatis genome, but not in E. coli K12;
  and white boxes, E. coli genes not found in the P. ananatis AJ13355 genome. Used
  abbreviations for metabolites are included as supplementary material (Table S).
  The reaction directions are indicated accordingly to previously published E. coli
  genome-scale metabolic reconstruction (Feist et al. )'
