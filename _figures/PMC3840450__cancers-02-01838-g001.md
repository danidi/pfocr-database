caption: Schematic representation of the main actors intervening in the canonical
  and noncanonical NF-κB activation pathways. Stimuli such as TNFα, lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-coupled
  antigen activate, through intermediary proteins, an IKK complex including the α
  and β catalytic subunits and the NEMO regulatory subunit. Activation of this complex
  entails phosphorylation of IκBα thus promoting its subsequent ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation. The nuclear localization signal present in the p50:RelA
  heterodimer becomes exposed, allowing its translocation to the nucleus and interaction
  with DNA target elements. The noncanonical pathway is activated by TNF family members
  such as BAFF, CD40, and lymphotoxin-α1β2 and stabilizes and activates the NIK kinase
  through inhibition of intermediary proteins including TRAF2 and TRAF3. The NIK kinase
  has the ability to activate not only the noncanonical IKKα/IKKα complex but also
  the canonical IKK complex []. The IKKα complex phosphorylates p100 on C-terminal
  serines resulting in proteasomal degradation of p100 bound to p50:RelA and p50:RelB
  dimers or proteasomal processing of p100 bound to p52. This leads to nuclear translocation
  of p50:RelA, p50:RelB, and p52:RelB heterodimers, and regulation of their target
  genes.
