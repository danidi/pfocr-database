caption: 'Protein kinase B signaling pathway. Stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases
  or G-protein-coupled-receptors activates phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
  (PIP3) which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) at the
  plasma membrane to generate PIP3. Inactive Akt in the cytosol gets recruited to
  the plasma membrane where it gets phosphorylated at T308 in the kinase domain by
  phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 and at S473 in the regulatory domain by mTORC2
  resulting in full activation; Signal termination is achieved by PTEN where it dephosphorylates
  PIP3 to PIP2; Additionally, PP2A and PHLPP have shown to regulate Akt kinase activity
  by direct dephosphorylation; Activation of Akt is known to regulate crucial transcription
  factors such as nuclear factor-kB (NF- kB), CREB, FOXO, and Nrf-2, each of which
  regulates a variety of target genes that regulate cell survival, proliferation,
  differentiation, migration, and metabolism; Akt is known to phosphorylate IkB kinase
  which phosphorylates IkB-a releasing NF-kB to translocate into the nucleus and transcribe
  genes; Activation of Akt might increase or suppress NF-kB regulated genes (IL-8,
  IL-18) depending on the stimulus. Both FOXO and CREB are known to regulate apoptosis
  and phosphorylation of these transcription factors by Akt, has shown to control
  cell survival. Nrf-2 activation by Akt increases the production of antioxidant genes
  such as HO-1 and NQO-1 that counteracts oxidative stress and inflammation. RTK:
