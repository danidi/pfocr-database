caption: Effective communication between cells is central to development, tissue and
  organism homeostasis, and host defense. Evolution has provided a number of elegant
  solutions to this problem, but among these the Jak/STAT pathway is one of the architecturally
  simplest paradigms, allowing remarkable direct communication from transmembrane
  receptors to the nucleus (). Pioneering work on the control of gene expression by
  interferons led to the discovery of this pathway; however, it is now recognized
  that a wide variety of cytokines, colony stimulating factors and hormones employ
  this mode of signal transduction ().
