caption: 'Generalized pathway of lipid metabolism.Notes: Cytoplasmic nonesterified
  fatty acids are rapidly converted to fatty acyl-CoA, which may proceed to undergo
  β-oxidation or serve as a substrate for either TAG or phospholipid synthesis. Following
  β-oxidation, acetyl-CoA enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle; the produced NADH and
  FADH2 participate in the ETC. Complex I of the ETC leaks injurious ROS.Abbreviations:
  TAG, triacylglycerol; CoA, coenzyme A; TCA, tricarboxylic acid; NADH, nicotinamide
  adenine dinucleotide; FADH2, flavin adenine dinucleotide; ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  ATP, adenosine triphosphatase; ETC, electron transport chain.'
