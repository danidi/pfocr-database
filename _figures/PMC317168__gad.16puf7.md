caption: A revised model of the pheromone response, HOG, and pseudohyphal growth pathways.
  The diagram shows feedback regulation of the Sho1p branch of the HOG pathway by
  Hog1p. Ste50p and Ste20p are shown as components of both the pheromone response
  and HOG pathways. Sho1p is shown as a sensor for both the pseudohyphal growth and
  HOG pathways. Processes that occur inappropriately in hog1 mutants (osmolarity-induced
  cross talk to the pheromone response pathway and hyperpseudohyphal growth) are shown
  as broken lines.
