caption: Mapping of gene expression changes in NK cells by IL-15 priming and hypoxia
  onto Hif-1 signaling and glycolytic pathways. Microarray analysis was performed
  on NK cells isolated from whole blood of five healthy donors and cultured at 20%
  O2 or 1% O2 for 22 h without or with IL-15 (45 ng/ml) during the final 6 h. Total
  RNA was hybridized onto human genome array chips. Data were subjected to GSEA using
  KEGG pathways applying an FDR-adjusted probability (FDR q-value) threshold of pathway
  enrichment of 0.05. By far, the strongest associations for hypoxia were seen with
  the HIF-1 signaling and glycolysis pathways after priming, although there were no
  significant associations for hypoxia without priming (). Significant mean transcriptional
  changes of >1.25-fold relative to standard culture conditions (legend on top) are
  mapped onto Hif-1 signaling (A) and glycolytic (B) pathways and the PPP (C) using
  a binary logarithmic color scale with white for no change, green for decreased,
  and red for increased mean gene expression levels. Glycolytic genes assigned to
  both KEGG pathways are included in the glycolytic pathway (B), which is further
  complemented by the SLC16A1/3 and PC genes encoding lactate transporters Mct1/4
  and pyruvate carboxylase, respectively. For the display of integer pathways and
  to avoid gaps, some genes are included even when showing non-significant or below
  threshold changes (printed in gray). In the Hif-1 signaling pathway (A), mean changes
  are also given by way of exemption for eponymous HIF1A as well as for PIK3CD and
  CDKN1A, which both appear to contribute to isoform switches. Names of genes selected
  for RT-PCR validation () are printed in bold. Where the gene name is not reminiscent
  of the protein name, the latter is added in parentheses ((A) Phd2, Hif1B, and p21/27)
  or replaces the gene name ((B) TIGAR for “TP53-inducible glycolysis and apoptosis
  regulator” encoded by the C12orf5 gene).
