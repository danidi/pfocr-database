caption: 'Schematic illustration of how autism-risk genes regulate neuronal structure
  and their sites of action. An illustration of a dendritic segment containing a dendrite
  and a dendritic spine is enlarged from the box region on the left and shown on the
  right. Microtubules (green) and actin filaments (blue) are two major cytoskeletons
  found in dendrites and dendritic spines, respectively. Autism-risk genes (in bold
  font) are categorized by their main function and color coded accordingly. (1) Cytoskeletal
  proteins (gray rounded rectangular box): MYO16, CTTNBP2, and ADNP, directly regulate
  actin and microtubule function to control dendritic spine and neurite stability.
  ELMO1 and SYNGAP1 regulate actin dynamics to control spine stability via small RhoGTPases.
  (2) Adhesion molecules (colored rectangular box): Cadherins (CDHs), protocadherins
  (PCDHs), and neurexin (NRXN)-neuroligin (NLGN) complex, as well as surface receptors,
  NTRK, GRIK, and NMDAR, act at synapses to regulate synaptic function. NCAM2 and
  CNTNAP2, also have functions in regulating neurite outgrowth. (3) Signaling molecules
  (blue ellipse shape): CDKL5, DYRK1A, and PTEN regulate several signaling pathways
  to maintain the stability of dendritic structures. (4) Scaffolding proteins (yellow
  polygon): SHANK3 and DLGAP2, locate at post-synaptic density and tightly associate
  with PSD95 and other signaling molecules to regulate spine stability and synaptic
  plasticity. (5) Synaptic proteins (pink ellipse shape): STXBP5 and PRICKLE1 not
  only regulate synaptic vesicle release, but also play a role in regulating neurite
  outgrowth. (6) Syndromic molecules (clear rectangular box): FMRP and UBE3A regulate
  the structural stability of neurons via the regulation of protein synthesis or binding
  with other molecules in dendritic spines. MECP2 mainly functions in the nucleus
  and regulates transcription of many genes to in turn affecting the structural stability
  of neurons. TSC1/2 regulates the mTOR pathway and cytoskeletal machinery to maintain
  dendritic stability.'
