caption: 'Correlations of chemical-stress-related metabolic networks with carbohydrate,
  tricarboxylate and photorespiratory metabolites. The green filled arrow represents
  a negative Pearson correlation between directly connected metabolites; red and green
  hatched arrows represent, respectively, positive and negative Pearson correlations
  between indirectly connected metabolites. For each cluster, a typical metabolite
  is shown. For each metabolite, the corresponding cluster (as defined in ) is indicated
  in brackets. Shaded metabolites are correlated to physiological parameters (). BCAA,
  branched-chain amino acid; PP, photorespiratory pathway; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
  The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) for each pair of metabolites is shown. Asterisks
  indicate significant correlations: *P≤0.05, **P≤0.001, and ***P≤0.0001. (This figure
  is available in colour at JXB online.)'
