caption: Peptide Hormones as Systemic Regulators of Nodulation.CK associated with
  nodule initiation induces NIN and production of CLE-RS peptides. CLE-RS2 is also
  induced by nitrate via NLP4. Although CLE-RS2 participates in systemic regulation,
  NLP1 locally inhibits nodulation through competition with NIN for downstream regulatory
  elements. Processed CLE-RS peptides are transported to, and perceived in, the shoot
  by HAR1. HAR1 then inhibits miRNA2111 abundance to prevent negative regulation of
  TML, establishing AON. Nitrogen starvation responses are integrated into this pathway
  by CEP/CRA2 signaling, which acts antagonistically to HAR1 on miRNA2111 levels.
