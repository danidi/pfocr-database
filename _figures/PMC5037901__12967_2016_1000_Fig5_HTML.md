caption: Study progress of stathmin and MicroRNAs. a Over-expression of miR-31 restores
  chemo-response by reducing stathmin expression; miR-101/stathmin pathway contributes
  to radioresistance in human NPC; down-regulation of miR-193b promotes migration
  and proliferation of tumor cells by targets stathmin; miR-223 regulates stathmin
  by JNK signaling pathway to regulate MPM cell motility; b up-regulation of miR193b
  reduces proliferation and migration by inhibiting stathmin and uPA; silencing of
  miR-210 promotes proliferation of cancerous cells; transfection of miR-142 and miR-223
  decreases expression of stathmin and IGF-1R to inhibit proliferation of cancerous
  cells; c microrna-9 inhibits cell proliferation, vasculogenic mimicry and tumor
  growth through controlling stathmin expression; miR-101 suppresses autophagy via
  targets stathmin and down-regulation of miR-101 is linked to the increase of cellular
  proliferation and invasiveness. miRNAs small non-coding regulatory RNAs, JNK c-JunN-terminalkinase,
