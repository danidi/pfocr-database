caption: Connections and select functions of the BG, cerebellum and cortex. This diagram
  shows the structural organization and functions of relevant pathways in the BG,
  cerebellum and cortex. During processing of an emotional stimulus, these regions
  (as well as, e.g. amygdala, hippocampus) cooperatively analyze the incoming information
  and generate an appropriate response, which includes action tendencies, physiological
  changes and subjective feelings. Green arrows indicate excitatory pathways, red
  arrows indicate inhibitory pathways, and the blue arrow indicates the dopaminergic
  pathway from the SN. SN, substantia nigra; GPi/GPe, internal/external globus pallidus;
  STN, subthalamic nucleus; PN, pontine nuclei; DCN, deep cerebellar nuclei; IO, inferior
  olive.
