caption: 'Left: Inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum-localized Porcn results in loss
  of Wnt fatty acylation. Wnt proteins devoid of their lipid moiety are not recognized
  by the Wntless (Wls) chaperone resulting in their sequestration in the secretory
  pathway. Wnt molecules in addition to regulating β-catenin/TCF activity control
  other cellular responses not depicted here. Right: Disruption of Tnks1 & 2 activity
  with chemicals results in loss of Axin protein PARylation, a biochemical change
  that promotes Axin destruction by ubiquitinylation. Thus in cells treated with Tnks
  inhibitors, Axin accumulates and accelerates the rate of β-catenin turnover. Without
  a sufficient abundance of β-catenin, the TCF/LEF proteins are unable to elicit a
  meaningful transcriptional response. The turnover rate of other proteins in addition
  to β-catenin that are regulated by Tnks and Axin are not depicted here but discussed
  in Section 3.'
