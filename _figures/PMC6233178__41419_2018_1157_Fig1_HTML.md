caption: Mitochondria undergo metabolic disorders, manifested by decreased fatty acid
  oxidation. Mitochondria can also produce ROS and further activate the NLRP3/inflammasome.
  Production of mitochondrial ROS is also related to the expression of proinflammatory
  factors. ER stress caused by misfolded proteins can start the unfolded protein reaction
  (UPR), including activation of GRP78 and downstream signaling, including the PERK–eIF2–ATF4
  pathway and ATF6 pathway. However, persistent activation of UPR can result in apoptosis.
  Autophagy plays a dual role. This process can either avoid apoptosis or aggravate
  renal fibrosis, depending on different situations. Injuries can also lead to epigenetic
  changes and changes in mRNA expression
