caption: A, activation of AMPK pathway in muscle of HFDC mice. Adiponectin/AdipR1
  signaling in muscle activates the AMPK pathway, resulting in elevated transcriptional
  activity of PGC-1α and PPARα, and consequently increased expression of their target
  genes. B, molecular mechanisms underlying the anti-atherogenic effects of flavonoids
  are different in normal and obese mice.
