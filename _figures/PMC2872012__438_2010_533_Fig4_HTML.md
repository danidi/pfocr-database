caption: Functional genetic network as defined by the bioPIXIE tool (Myers et al.
  , http://pixie.princeton.edu/pixie) with genes in genetic interaction with PLA2
  expression as input. Genes in genetic interaction with PLA2 expression are marked
  in gray. Components of the prefoldin, SWR1 and retromer complexes are circled with
  dashed, full and dotted lines, respectively

papertitle: Genetic interactions between a phospholipase A2 and the Rim101 pathway
  components in S. cerevisiae reveal a role for this pathway in response to changes
  in membrane composition and shape.
