caption: A schematic network diagram for the metabolic pathway we consider in this
  paper, from pyruvate to 3HP via malonyl-CoA. The arrows denote the direction of
  the reactions and are labelled by their respective catalytic constants (also referred
  to as turnover numbers). We only track the metabolites included in this figure and,
  specifically, not any involved in the acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA sinks. The subscript
  for a given enzyme  (for ) corresponds to the subscript of the related maximal reaction
  rate. The exception here is for the reversible reaction between malonic semialdehyde
  and 3HP, where both reactions use the enzyme . Hence,  corresponds to the pyruvate
  dehydrogenase complex (EC 1.2.4.1, EC 2.3.1.12, and EC 1.8.1.4),  corresponds to
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2),  corresponds to malonyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.2.1.75),  corresponds
  to 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.298), and  corresponds to malonate
  semialdehyde dehydrogenase (acetylating) (EC 1.2.1.18)
