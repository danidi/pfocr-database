caption: Major steps of Gln metabolism and transport in the CNS which may contribute
  to, or modulate, Gln-mediated ammonia toxicity. Ammonia (NH4+) is incorporated (“detoxified”)
  into glutamine (Gln) in astrocytes (and perhaps microglia) by the amidation of glutamate
  (Glu) to glutamine (Gln), a process catalyzed by glutamine synthase (GS). Gln accumulated
  in astrocytes i) crosses the mitochondrial membrane and is hydrolyzed by phosphate-activated
  glutaminase (PAG) to glutamate (Glu) and NH4+, and ii) exits astrocytes preferably
  by the system N (the SNAT3 transporter) which is controlled by extracellular Glu,
  and partly by system L in exchange for large neutral amino acids (NAA). The Gln
  that leaves astrocytes enters neurons mainly via system A to be converted to the
  amino acid neurotransmitters Glu and GABA, and possibly by system y+L (the y+LAT2
  transporter) in exchange of Arg, which serves the purpose of modulating the availability
  of Arg for NO synthesis and thus may influence the rate of the NO/cGMP pathway.
  A portion of Gln derived from astrocytes leaves the CNS via the L and N systems
  that are localized in capillary endothelial cells that forms the blood-brain barrier,
  some of the Gln may enter the microglial cells and modulate their function.
