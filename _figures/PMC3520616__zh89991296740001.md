caption: Upstream events in BCR signaling. (A) BCR signaling in the absence of antigen
  binding provides a tonic survival signal dependent on PI3K. In this model, the Ras
  GTPAse TC21 binds to nonphosphorylated tyrosine motifs (black boxes) in Igα and
  Igβ and activates PI3K-dependent survival signals. PI3Kα and PI3Kδ assume redundant
  functions in this pathway. (B) BCR signaling in response to antigen binding induces
  LYN- and SYK-dependent phosphorylation (phosphorylation denoted by “P” in orange
  circle) of tyrosine motifs (red boxes) on CD79A and CD79B. A number of protein kinases
  (red symbols) and the lipid kinase PI3Kδ (blue symbol) transmit survival, cell growth,
  and proliferation signals and regulate cell migration. The transcription factors
  NF-κB and NFAT are important regulators of BCR-induced gene expression changes.
  Small-molecule inhibitors of select kinases in the BCR pathway that have demonstrated
  significant clinical activity are indicated.
