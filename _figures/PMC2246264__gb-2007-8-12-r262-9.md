caption: Proposed mechanism for MnSOD-mediated mitochondria to nucleus signaling and
  crosstalk with the IIS pathway. The data suggest a model in which MnSOD catalyzed
  detoxification of superoxide results in increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide
  levels that mediate various signaling events. Such events include the activation
  of the JNK and NF-κB pathways. Pathway components that demonstrate increased expression
  due to MnSOD over-expression are highlighted in yellow. Note that genes up-regulated
  at both time points are indicated by black text, those up-regulated only at the
  first time point assayed are indicated by grey text, whereas those up-regulated
  only at the later time point are denoted by blue text. Solid lines indicate direct
  interactions, dashed lines indicate indirect interactions, dotted lines indicate
  translocation events, and '?' indicates hypothetical or speculative elements. The
  proposed retrograde signal from the mitochondria to the nucleus mediated by hydrogen
  peroxide is shown in red. Numerous genes are up-regulated as a result of these signaling
  events and some were also identified as being similarly altered in long-lived C.
  elegans IIS mutants, suggesting their role as species-general lifespan effectors.
  These genes are indicated as are the biological processes that they contribute to.
  Hydrogen peroxide reversibly inhibits PTEN [105], an upstream inhibitor of IIS,
  resulting in activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. In accordance
  with this, Pk61C gene expression levels are up-regulated as are some downstream
  components of the IIS pathway in response to MnSOD over-expression. Increased IIS
  activity results in dFOXO inactivation and since MnSOD may be a direct transcriptional
  target, this suggests that feedback regulation may occur. The proposed feedback
  loop between MnSOD and the IIS pathway is also shown in red. Crosstalk between TOR
  and its binding partner, raptor, with the mitochondrion has been suggested [111],
  although the molecular basis has not been elucidated. As shown here, hydrogen peroxide
  may participate in this mechanism. ET, electron transport; ILP, insulin-like peptide.
