caption: 'Sonic hedgehog signaling pathway. (1) ON state: SHH protein binds to PTCH1
  receptor, at the cell surface level. This event abolishes SMO inhibition that can
  move to the primary cilia to induce GLI activation through SUFU detachment. Then,
  GLI2A and GLI3A translocate to the nucleus in order to promote the transcription
  of target genes; GLI2A acts as the main activator. (2) OFF state: In the absence
  of SHH ligand, PTCH1 inhibits SMO, and GLIs are phosphorylated by PKA/CK1/GSK3 complex.
  GLI2R and GLI3R are formed and can follow two possible destinations: proteasome
  degradation or translocation into the nucleus to repress the transcription of targets
  genes. In this case, GLI3R is the major repressor.'
