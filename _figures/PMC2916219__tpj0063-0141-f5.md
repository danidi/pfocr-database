caption: A model for regulation pathways responsible for RN and AM symbioses. (a)
  In response to Nod factors, the signal generated by NFR1/NFR5 splits into two pathways,
  one of these flows into the common symbiosis pathway (pink line). The input of another
  pathway (deep pink line) is prerequisite for successful infection of rhizobia. Epistasis
  between CYCLOPS and NSP2 on the pathway remains unclear. ITs were rarely, but initiated
  in cyclops (, ), while no micro-colonies were observed in nsp2 (). Therefore, CYCLOPS
  appears to be downstream of NSP2 on the pathway leading to IT formation. One possible
  explanation is that NSP2 may be positioned on another pathway that originates from
  NFR1/NFR5. For nodule organogenesis, only one signal is sufficient for activation
  of the downstream pathway, in which LHK1, NSP1/2 and NIN are involved. CYCLOPS is
  not involved in nodule organogenesis. (b) In the AM symbiosis, a plausible AM pathway
  that bifurcates after putative receptors (grey arrow) might be converged with common
  symbiosis pathway (blue arrows).
