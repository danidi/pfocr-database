caption: 'The acquisition of photosynthesis and then its subsequent loss resulted
  in shifts as to which compartment was the main user of tetrapyrroles in the cell,
  and with it the location of principal responsibility for synthesis. The resulting
  pathway is distributed between the mitochondrion (orange), cytosol (gray) and apicoplast
  (red). Similarly, the enzymes involved are of different origins within the original
  endosymbiont []: either the red-algal plastid (pink) or cytoplasm (gray).'
