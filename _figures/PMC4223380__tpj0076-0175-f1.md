caption: Schematic representation of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in plants.The
  activities of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases 1 and 4 (CCD1 and CCD4) according
  to Huang et al. () are shown. Although CCD1 and CCD4 enzymes cleave carotenoids
  at the same positions (9,10 and 9′,10’), CCD4 enzymes are more substrate-specific
  than CCD1. Moreover, the CCD1 enzymes are located in the cytoplasm, while CCD4 enzymes
  are located in plastids.
