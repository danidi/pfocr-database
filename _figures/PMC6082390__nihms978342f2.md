caption: PC1/3 activity is essential to the leptin–melanocortin pathway. The hypothalamus
  is a key regulator of food intake and energy expenditure, responding to the action
  of peripheral hormones. Leptin is an anorexigenic hormone, produced and secreted
  by white adipose tissue, whose circulating levels are proportional to the mass of
  body fat. Leptin binds to leptin receptors on AgRP/NPY- and POMC-expressing neurons
  in the ARC of the hypothalamus. Leptin binding inhibits the synthesis of AgRP and
  stimulates the synthesis of POMC. Acting together, PC1/3 and PC2 accomplish the
  proteolytic processing of POMC to α-MSH within POMC-expressing neurons. PC1/3 is
  specifically required for the processing of proAgRP in NPY/AgRP-producing neurons.
  α-MSH and AgRP compete for the MC4R in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the
  hypothalamus. Whereas increased receptor activity by α-MSH binding generates an
  anorexigenic signal, AgRP reduces receptor activity, generating an orexigenic signal.
