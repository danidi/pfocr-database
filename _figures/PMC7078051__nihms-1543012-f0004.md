caption: Fumarate accumulates at millimolar (mM) concentration in HLRCC cells. The
  accumulated fumarate drives constitutive NRF2 activation, which promoter the transcription
  of ferritin light (FTL) and ferritin heavy (FTH1) genes. Fumarate also inhibits
  iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) ability to repress FTL and FTH1 mRNA translation,
  resulting in high intracellular ferritin level. This high intracellular ferritin
  can sequester free iron, resulting in a drop in labile iron pool. The high ferritin
  level also indirectly activates FOXM1 transcription factor, which drive a sustained
  proliferative signaling. Iron is an essential element in many cellular processes.
  HLRCC cells rely on ferritinophagy to release ferritin stored iron. Fumarate was
  also shown to indirectly inhibit AMP kinase (AMPK), which in turn indirectly inhibit
  divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) expression. This prevents the efflux of iron
  from endosome into the cytoplasm, further reduces the labile iron pool. The low
  labile iron pool, causes IRPs to repress HIF2A translation, resulting in specific
  activation of HIF1A. Red colored arrow indicates that the pathway is upregulated
  in HLRCC cells. Blue colored arrow indicates that the pathway is down regulated
  in HLRCC cells. Green colored arrow indicates that the pathway is required in HLRCC
  cells. Dotted line indicates indirect mechanism. Solid line indicates that direct
  mechanism has been reported.
