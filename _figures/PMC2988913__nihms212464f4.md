caption: Model of partner-switching pathways. (A) A model of the B. subtilis partner-switching
  regulatory pathway controlling the activity of the general stress response sigma
  factor, sigma B. See text for detailed description of the model. (B) A model of
  the predicted SypA-SypE partner-switching module controlling biofilm formation.
  SypA and SypE possess the core components of a putative partner-switching signal
  pathway. The proposed model is constructed from information of the conserved protein
  domains and current data of biofilm regulation.
