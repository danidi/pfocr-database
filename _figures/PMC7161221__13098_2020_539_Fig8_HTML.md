caption: Schematic model of the PVT1/miR-23b-3p/WT1/NF-κB pathway axis in HG-induced
  proliferation and fibrosis in MCs. HG treatment induced PVT1 expression in MCs.
  Then, the elevated expression of PVT1 repressed miR-23-3p level and thus protected
  against WT1 repression. Next, the NF-κB signaling pathway was activated. Finally,
  the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway enhanced cell proliferation and fibrosis
  of HG-induced MCs, which accelerated DN progression
