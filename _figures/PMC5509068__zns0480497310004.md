caption: DA concentration determines relative amount of inhibitory activity in PFC.
  Top left panel depicts a cortical microcircuit under conditions of low DA (state
  2), during which prolonged moderate DA release, such as during a working memory
  task, produces a situation in which extrasynaptic D1 receptors receive preferential
  activation. Bottom left panel magnifies the boxed region from the top panel to show
  the hypothesized signaling pathway downstream of the D1 receptor. D1 activation
  increases both cAMP and PKA levels, resulting in phosphorylation of K+ channels
  to decrease conductance and cause increased excitability of interneurons and increased
  GABA release onto the postsynaptic pyramidal cell. Top right panel depicts a cortical
  microcircuit under conditions of high DA (state 1), during which transient increases
  in DA preferentially activate D2 receptors. Bottom right panel magnifies the region
  contained in the box from the top panel to show the signaling cascade activated
  by high DA. Stimulation of D2 receptors transactivates the PDGFR via Gi/o to increase
  [Ca2+]i and decrease DARPP-32 activity. Downregulation of DARPP-32 results in an
  increase in PP-1/2A activity and a subsequent change in the phosphorylation state
  of the GABA receptor (likely at S408 and 409 of the β3 subunit) to decrease GABA
  currents postsynaptically. This would allow for decreased responsiveness of pyramidal
  cells to inhibitory influences and increase the likelihood of interference.
