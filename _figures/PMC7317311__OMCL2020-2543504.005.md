caption: Proposed model for curcumin-induced DNA demethylation of hGCCs. Curcumin
  at high concentration elevates the level of intracellular ROS in hGCCs, causing
  mitochondrial damage (exhibited by the decrease in Δψm), DNA damage, and apoptosis.
  DNA damage then triggers DDR and recruits ATM/ATR/DNA-PK to strand break sites to
  repair damaged DNA. ATM/ATR/DNA-PK can phosphorylate both histone γH2AX on chromatin
  flanking double strain break sites and p53, resulting in the activation of the p53
  pathway. This leads to apoptosis, with upregulation of the target genes, p21 and
  GADD45A. Expressed p21 and GADD45A may then inhibit the combination of cyclin D
  with CDK4,6 and cyclin E with CDK2 and prevent the phosphorylation of Rb by these
  cyclin/CDK complexes and, thereby, induce cell cycle arrest. Nonphosphorylated Rb
  may associate with E2F factors and inhibit the expression of E2F-regulated genes,
  including Cyclin E and DNMT1. The downregulation of DNMT1 may then lead to DNA demethylation
  after DNA is replicated in the S phase of the cell cycle.
