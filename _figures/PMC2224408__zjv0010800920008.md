caption: A model for the involvement of Akt in viral RNA synthesis. The replication
  of viral RNA and synthesis of viral mRNA require P and L complex. The phosphorylation
  status of the P protein plays a critical in viral RNA synthesis. Akt phosphorylates
  P, thus leading to the activation of P. For viruses encoding a V protein, the V
  protein can regulate viral RNA synthesis via its interaction with Akt through an
  unknown mechanism. The V-Akt1 interaction may also contribute to regulation of innate
  immune responses by the V protein. Activation of Akt1 is often through the PI3K
  pathway. However, it is not clear what activates Akt1 in virus-infected cells, since
  PI3K inhibitors had no effect on virus replication.
