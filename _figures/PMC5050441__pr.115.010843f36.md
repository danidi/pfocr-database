caption: Inflammatory pathway. Many botanicals are anti-inflammatory, inhibiting production
  of inflammatory biomarkers that are often overexpressed in breast cancer (i.e.,
  cytokines, iNOS and COX-2). Electrophilic botanicals covalently modify both IKK
  and NF-κB to inhibit phosphorylation and DNA binding, respectively. Many phytochemicals
  also inhibit COX-2 and thus the production of PGE2.
