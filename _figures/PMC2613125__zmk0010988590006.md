caption: IL-6—and depending on the presence of its soluble IL-6R—induces neural stem
  cells (NSCs) differentiation into astrocytes [via glia progenitor cells (GPC), pathway
  indicated by green arrows] and neurons [via neuronal progenitor cells (NPC), pathway
  indicated by red arrows]. During neurodegenerative processes apoptotic neurons release
  sIL-6R (purple receptor symbols) by shedding, whereas activated astrocytes release
  IL-6 (red circle). Via trans-signaling they can act on NSCs, which express (as GPCs
  and NPCs) very low or no IL-6 receptors but the common signaling receptor subunit
  gp130 (shown as green receptor-dimer symbols) that is used by all members of the
  IL-6-receptor family (; ). Although EGF and bFGF maintain NSCs' self-renewal, the
  IL-6–sIL-6R complex overrides those activities mediating NSCs differentiation. In
  contrast, classical neurotrophic factors such as NGF, BDNF, or NT-3 are unable to
  overcome EGF signaling. Increased gp130 expression on NSCs/NPCs and IL-6R-NGFR/TRKA
  (blue receptor symbols) transactivation by IL-6R/gp130 (white dotted line) enhances
  neuronal differentiation. Differentiated neurons express then various neurotrophic
  factors for their survival and proper functioning. Inhibiting the glia-differentiation
  pathway by, for instance, p-STAT-inhibitors (inhibition of nuclear transcription
  factor activity of p-STATs but not complete down-regulation of their expression)
  may turn H-IL-6 into an interesting potential therapeutic factor, acting on the
  MAPK/CREB signaling pathway, for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.
