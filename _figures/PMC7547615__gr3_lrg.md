caption: 'Mode of action of MSC''s for treating COVID-19: 1.Ifusion of MSC''s 2. MSC''s
  immunomodulation and regenerative potential in the inflamed lung after MSC''s infusion.
  a. Infused MSC''s generate T-cell tolerance thus escaping host T-cell mediated rejection.
  b. MSC’s inhibit viral entry as they lack ACE-2 and TMRSS2. c. MSC''s or exosomes
  mediate secondary microbial infection in COVID-19 patients by secreting antimicrobial
  proteins such as defensin and by activating the phagocytosis mode of macrophage.
  d. MSC''s inhibit the major pathway that is cytokine storm by modulating the immune
  cells as described in . e. MSC''s mediate the clearance of lung fluid by activating
  the Na+-K+ pump via exosomes released KGF or Lipoxin A4. f. Inhibit the apoptosis
  of epithelial/endothelial cells vis modulating hypoxia-induced factor-α and ROS.
  Downregulated cytokines and chemokines via MSC’s also reduce hypoxia conditions
  and further help in the MSC''s mediated process. g. MSC''s inhibit the cell signaling
  pathways mediated by TLR or PRR’s resultant in further modulation of cytokines and
  decreasing vascular permeability. h. Administered MSC''s-CM or exosomes or MSC''s
  also promote the process of angiogenesis via releasing several paracrine factors
  such as granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, Interleukin-3, etc. i. Lung
  fibrosis also reduce via regenerating epithelial type II cells and by MSC''s differentiated
  AT-II-like cells. The figure is made via biorender application: https://biorender.com/)'
