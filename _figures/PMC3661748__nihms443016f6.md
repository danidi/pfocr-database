caption: Diagram of proposed signaling pathways that modulate phenotypic changes in
  venous EC in response to VEGF-A.  shows the main pathway of VEGF downregulation
  of EphB4 and upregulation of dll4.  shows the delta-notch block (red X).  shows
  the possible non-canonical activation of dll4, questioning the activity of the canonical
  pathway in these cells (red ?).  shows the negative feedback of EphB4 on the VEGF
  downregulation of EphB4 and upregulation of VEGFR2 and dll4, although the proposed
  site of feedback (red dashed line) is not clearly established.
