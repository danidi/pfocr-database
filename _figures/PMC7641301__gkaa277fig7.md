caption: Schematic representation of over-regulated pathway after 48 h Forskolin stimulation.
  The AltProts have been positioned within this pathway. The Forskolin stimulates
  the cAMP pathway that involves different factors such as ARIB4B, DIXDC1 and GPR82
  as previously described. The cell mobility pathway seems tightly connected to the
  cAMP one. The tRNA modulation and the regulation of proteins synthesis are also
  downstream pathways of cAMP. AltProts are associated with different levels, both
  in the cAMP pathway and in the tRNA modulation and protein synthesis with the involvement
  of AltSETD1B and AltLINC00624. The RefProt SETD18 associated with AltSETD1B was
  described to be involved in the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene
  expression.
