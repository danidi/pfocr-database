caption: MapMan overview of significant (FDR adjusted p ≤ 0.05 & log2 fold change
  ≥2) differentially expressed loci (SDEL) involved in biotic stress pathway, unique
  to PB1+Pi9, upon M. oryzae infection. SDEL are binned to MapMan functional categories
  and values represented as log2 fold change values. Red represents up-regulated loci
  and green represents down-regulated loci. JA, jasmonic acid; SA, salicylic acid;
  bZIP, basic region-leucine zipper; ERF, ethylene response factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated
  protein kinase; PR-protein, pathogenesis-related protein.
