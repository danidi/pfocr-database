caption: 'Gene expression and metabolite levels in the distal network pathways related
  to Met- and Trp-derived GS biosynthesis. Each metabolic pathway is indicated by
  a different color: Trp and Phe biosynthesis and metabolism in blue, Met biosynthesis
  and metabolism in pink, TCA cycle in blue, sulfur assimilation and metabolism in
  yellow, and folate metabolism in green. The mRNA expression analysis was done with
  joined values obtained in overexpression plants of each clade, while metabolite
  analysis was done separately for each line (see “Materials and Methods”). All known
  enzymatic reactions are marked with black arrows, while the predicted or multiple
  reactions are marked with dotted arrows. Colored squares and circles represent statistically
  significant changes in gene expression of plants overexpressing the MYB28-like and
  ATR1-like clade genes, respectively. Putatively identified compounds are marked
  with squares, and the colored numbers represent statistically significant changes
  in the corresponding overexpression lines. Detailed information regarding each gene
  can be found in Supplemental Table S4, and metabolite profiles of the distal network
  metabolites can be found in  (and partially in Supplemental Fig. S2).'
