caption: Schematic diagram of differentially expressed proteins belonging to metabolic
  pathways/cellular processes leading to the acclimation/tolerance of Cymodocea nodosa
  in volcanic vents. The acclimation strategy combines the reduction of carbon fixation,
  gluconeogenesis, carbohydrate metabolism and protein synthesis with increasing photophosphorylation,
  cell respiration and aminoacid metabolism to maintain the high energy demand for
  leaf expansion and elongation of the mesophyll cell; the cell expansion is accomplished
  by the cell wall loosening, the vacuole enlargement and the cytoskeleton remodeling.
  Proteins belonging the oxidative stress response pathway, the Gluthatione metabolism
  and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites were also accumulated, suggesting
  that potential external stress factor other than CO2 are at play at the Vulcano
  submarine vents. Proteins and related KEGG codes, reported also in Table , are developed
  by Kanehisa Laboratories.
