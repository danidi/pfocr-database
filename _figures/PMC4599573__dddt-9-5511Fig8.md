caption: 'PLB regulates remodeling of epithelial adherens junctions pathway in SCC25
  cells.Notes: SCC25 cells were treated with 5 μM PLB for 24 hours and the protein
  samples were subject to quantitative proteomic analysis. Red indicates upregulation;
  green indicates downregulation. The intensity of green and red molecule colors indicates
  the degree of down or upregulation, respectively. Solid arrows indicate direct interaction.
  The arrow with white head indicates translocation. The arrow with gray head indicates
  activation, causation, expression, localization, membership, modification, molecular
  cleavage, phosphorylation, protein-DNA interactions, protein-RNA interactions, regulation
  of binding, transcription.Abbreviation: PLB, plumbagin.'
