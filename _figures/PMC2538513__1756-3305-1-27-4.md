number: Figure 4
caption: Schematic illustration of the involvement of c-Ski and TGF-β signaling pathway
  in nurse cell formation. Binding of TGF-β by the type II receptor on the cell surface
  initiates a cascade of signaling events. Activated type I receptor phosphorylates
  Smad2 and Smad3 in the cytoplasm, which forms a complex with Smad4. The Smad2/3/4
  complex moves to the nucleus and functionally collaborates with distinct transcription
  factors to turn on or off transcription of many TGF-β-responsive genes. C-Ski acts
  as a co-repressor to turn off the transcription, which results in the cell cycle
  arrest and transformation of Trichinella infected muscle cells. This figure referred
  the review by Shi and Massague [].
