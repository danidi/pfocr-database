caption: '[AQ27] Schematic diagram of NF-κB activation circuits and oxygen-signaling
  mechanisms in hyperoxia. Blocking reduction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to GSH,
  by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), leads to increasing intracellular
  stores of GSSG, a potent inhibitor of NF-κB transcription factor DNA binding. The
  pathway leading to the formation of GSH by the action of γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase
  (γ-GCS) is blocked by L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), inducing an irreversible
  inhibition of NF-κB activation. ROS are key components of the pathways leading to
  the activation of NF-κB, whose binding activity is obliterated by N-acetyl-L-cysteine
  (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), potent scavengers of ROS. Although
  NAC elevates [GSH], it is unknown whether this mechanism induces NF-κB activation
  independently from the antioxidant effects of this inhibitor. PDTC elevates GSSG
  concentration by GSH oxidation, a pro-oxidant effect characteristic of dithiocarbamates,
  thereby mediating NF-κB inhibition. Upon NF-κB DNA binding, cascades of hyperoxia-responsive
  genes are activated, which have the potential to modulate cellular response to oxidative
  injury.'
