caption: The hypothetical role of the p53/MDM-2 pathway in normal endothelium and
  angiosarcoma development. Expression of wt-p53 is linked to the control of angiogenesis.
  wt-p53 positively regulates genes involved in intercellular signaling such as thrombospondin-1,
  a negative regulator of angiogenesis, and it exerts negative influence on VEGF gene
  expression. Abrogation of wt-p53 in endothelial cells either by functional inactivation
  through overexpression of mdm-2 protein or by p53 mutation obviously reflects the
  loss of an important cellular growth control and angiosuppressive pathway in angiosarcomas.
  Discontinuation of wt-p53 function leads to a decrease in Thrombospondin-1 production
  and a decline in the negative transcriptional control of VEGF. This shifts the net
  balance of positive and negative angiogenic factors to neovascularisation.
