caption: A possible model of cellular functions of bifunctional Prdx6 with peroxidase
  and PLA2 activities. The peroxidase of Prdx6 acts to eliminate the increased intracellular
  H2O2 induced by a variety of stimuli and thereby has a key role in the protection
  against cellular damages in oxidative stress, as shown in the current work and many
  previous reports. Other cellular functions of the PLA2 activity of Prdx6 may be
  involved in the TNF-induced apoptosis and the proinflammatory response. PLA2 induces
  the release of AA, which is involved in the inflammatory response by its metabolic
  mediator or in apoptosis linked with a caspase-dependent pathway. In addition, PLA2
  induces the activation of IL-1β-converting enzyme and caspase-1, and in turn regulates
  the production of IL-β. IL-1β as a potential proinflammatory cytokine is involved
  in the inflammatory response
