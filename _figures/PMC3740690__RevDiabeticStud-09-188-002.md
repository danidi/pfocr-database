caption: Experimental evidence indicates that PTPN2 regulates apoptosis of pancreatic
  β-cells upon exposure to inflammatory cytokines by modulating phosphorylation of
  STAT1, which induces the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The T1D-associated variant
  rs1893217 in the PTPN2 gene has been associated with reduced IL-2 receptor signaling
  in response to IL-2, impacting the maintenance of FOXP3+ Tregs in T1D subjects.
  PTPN2 has also been shown to influence glucose homeostasis by dephosphorylating
  the insulin receptor b-chain in conjunction with the PTP1B phosphatase. In addition,
  PTPN2 impacts glucose levels by modulating STAT3 signaling downstream of the leptin
  receptor in the hypothalamus and in response to IL-6, repressing hepatic gluconeogenesis.
