caption: In resting cells, the majority of NF-κB is bound to I-κB inhibitory protein,
  often IκBκ, which masks the nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) and holds the complex
  in the cytoplasm. In the ‘conical’ or ‘classical’ NF-κB activation pathway, ligand
  binding to a cell surface receptor (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-receptor (TNFR) or
  Toll-like receptor) recruits adaptors (e.g., TRAFs and RIP) leading to the recruitment
  of an IKK complex directly onto the cytoplasmic adaptors, activating the IKK complex.
  IKK then phosphorylates IκB at two serine residues, which leads to its ubiquitination
  and degradation by the proteasome. NF-κB then enters the nucleus to turn on target
  genes. TNFR activation can also lead to the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser 276 and
  536, and recruitment of cofactors such as p/CAF (via PKCβ) to heighten transcription.
  TCR engagement leads to recruitment and activation of receptor-associated tyrosine
  kinases of the Src and Syk families. The latter phosphorylate phospholipase C and
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Phosphorylation of phosphoinositides by PI3K
  leads to membrane recruitment and activation of PDK1, which may directly phosphorylate
  and activate PKCθ to control further recruitment of CARMA1 into the signaling complex.
  Assembly of these molecules into lipid rafts and PKCθ-dependent phosphorylation
  of CARMA1 initiate recruitment of BCL10 and MALT1 and possibly TRAF6 and TAK1, leading
  to IKK activation. The general model shown here for TCR signaling can also be applied
  to BCR signaling, although a role of PDK1 in this pathway needs to be demonstrated
  and instead of PKCθ, it involves PKCβ. The non-canonical or non-classical pathway
  differs from the canonical pathway in that only certain receptor signals (e.g.,
  Lymphotoxin B (LTb), B-cell activating factor (BAFF), CD40) activate this pathway
  and because it proceeds through an IKK complex that contains two IKKα subunits (but
  not NEMO). In the noncanonical pathway, receptor binding leads to activation of
  the NF-κB-inducing kinase NIK, which phosphorylates and activates an IKKα complex,
  which in turn phosphorylates two serine residues adjacent to the ankyrin repeat
  C-terminal IκB domain of p100, leading to its partial proteolysis and liberation
  of the p52/RelB complex. This complex then enters the nucleus to turn on target
  genes. Figure adapted from Edwards et al, 2008 [].
