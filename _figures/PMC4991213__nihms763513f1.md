caption: Schematic diagram of the interacting proteins in the Toll signaling pathway.
  An inactive Spätzle precursor is cleaved after infection and binds to the Toll receptor.
  Upon Toll pathway activation, Myd88, Tube, and Pelle associate with Toll, and Cactus
  is phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of Cactus leads to degradation of Cactus at the
  proteasome, which releases the inhibition of NF-κB proteins. Once released, NF-κB
  transcription factor family members (Dif, Dorsal) enter the nucleus and can regulate
  target genes.
