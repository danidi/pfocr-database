caption: A proposed mechanism for oxidative stress-induced senescence during aging
  and the effects of melatonin treatment. Melatonin increases SIRT1, which reduces
  inflammatory and apoptotic signaling related to p53 and media vasoconstriction due
  to endothelium-dependent vasomotor tone by eNOS deacetylation and increasing NO
  bioavailability; so melatonin leads to the downregulation of oxidative stress, inhibition
  of endothelial damage, and reduction of the apoptotic pathway
