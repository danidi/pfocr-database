caption: Regulation of RANK-containing EV production. We hypothesize that when RANK
  is internalized, an element of the normal receptor life cycle, it can either be
  recycled back to the plasma membrane, where it would be available for continued
  stimulation by RANKL. This would favor bone resorption. Alternatively, it could
  be sorted into a retrograde pathway that could lead to the Golgi for reuse of RANK,
  to the lysosome for degradation, or to multivesicular bodies, some of which would
  fuse with the plasma membrane and release RANK-EVs. All the retrograde pathways
  would remove RANK from the plasma membrane surface, and thus reduce stimulation
  by RANKL. In addition, shedding of RANK-EVs would also stimulate the RANKL reverse
  pathway and bone formation. If this idea is correct, shifts in the sorting of RANK
  could have profound effects on both bone resorption and bone formation, and understanding
  the underlying mechanisms may identify new strategies for treating bone disease.
