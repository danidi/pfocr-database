caption: Lysine biosynthetic pathway (aminoadipate pathway) with the intermediate
  l-α-AAA. It has not been clarified whether the reaction from homocitric acid to
  cis-homoaconitic acid is catalyzed by homoaconitase, as is the following reaction,
  or by a specific enzyme designated homocitrate dehydrase (). Therefore, this reaction
  is labelled with a question mark. OPC is cyclized l-α-AAA and is found as by-product
  in the culture broth of penicillin fermentations. The minus signs indicate negative
  effects of l-lysine on the indicated reactions which were identified from either
  P. chrysogenum or A. nidulans. These might be mediated at the transcriptional level
  or posttranscriptionally. See the text for details.
