caption: An example of positive and negative regulation of the Ifn-signalling pathway.
  Activation of toll-like receptors, Tlr3 and Tlr4, results in the well-described
  cytokine storm of SS and SjS, including the synthesis of type 1 interferons. Signal
  transduction following activation of the Ifnα/β receptor involves the Jak /Tyk-Stat1
  /Stat2 pathway. Irf9 acts as a transcription factor that is involved in the activation
  of Trim molecules, many of which are known to interact at multiple points of viral
  infections as antimicrobial factors. A major regulator of the Infαβ signalling pathway
  is Socs, a molecule that interferes with the activation loop of Jak kinase, thereby
  preventing phosphorylation of Stat molecules. Trim8 functions as an inhibitor of
  Socs1, promoting continuation of Ifn signalling. Similarly, Trim21 stabilizes the
  function of Irf3 through blocking its interaction with Pin1, thereby promoting Ifn
  signalling.
