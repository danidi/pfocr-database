caption: Shp2 and Pten in leukemia and anemia. (A) Simplified hematopoietic lineage
  tree marked with the effects of targeted gene deletion. The red and green arrows
  indicate increases and decreases in the cell populations in Shp2 KO (SKO) and Pten
  KO (PKO), respectively. Ablation of Shp2 compromised the effect of Pten deletion
  in myelopoiesis. The blue arrow specifically denotes the combined effect of dual
  Shp2 and Pten knockout in DKO mice. The increase in BFU-E was followed by a dramatic
  decrease in CFU-E in DKO mice, which along with elevated reactive oxygen species,
  impaired survival, and other defects, eventually leads to severe anemia. (B) Pten
  deficiency promotes leukemia development and also causes mild anemia. Shp2 inhibitor
  can suppress the leukemogenic effect of Pten loss, but may trigger severe anemia
  in the background of Pten deficiency. This calls for caution and genetic screening
  for Pten mutations or deficiency in cancer patients before prescription of pharmaceuticals
  designed to suppress the Ras–Erk pathway. BFU-E = Erythroid burst-forming units;
  CFU-E = erythroid colony-forming units; MPP = multipotent progenitors; CMP = common
  myeloid progenitors; CLP = common lymphoid progenitors; MEP = megakaryocyte/erythrocyte
  progenitors; GMP = granulocyte/macrophage progenitors; Pro-L = prolymphocytes; Lym
  = lymphocytes; RBC = red blood cells.
