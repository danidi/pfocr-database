caption: Identification of RON-targeting genes. (A) ChIP assay coupled with microarray
  (ChIP-chip) was conducted to identify the potential targets of RON, which is summarized
  into a heat map of 134 genes. Starved TSGH8301 cells at the indicated time periods
  (0, 3 and 24 h) were harvested for ChIP assay with anti-RON antibody. The dye-coupled-immunoprecipitated
  DNA was hybridized onto the 185K CGI microarrays. (B) Nuclear RON targets form a
  network of interactions by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. The input was all
  134 significant genes from ChIP-chip assay. Genes depicted in green are the RON-targeting
  genes. Targets in red circles are associated with the stress-activated protein kinase/JNK
  signaling pathway, targets in blue rectangles are related to the p53 signaling pathways
  and targets in purple rectangles are associated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt
  pathway. (C) The motif logo of consensus sequence to RON-targeting genes. The potential
  nuclear RON-targeting genes with ChIP–PCR validation were collected to establish
  a dataset for the motif analysis. The putative sequence was determined by MDscan
  (Motif Discovery Scan; http://ai.stanford.edu/∼xsliu/MDscan). The motif log was
  generated on http:weblogo.berkeley.edu.
