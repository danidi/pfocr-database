caption: A schema presenting our hypothesis that interleukin-3 (IL-3) inactivates
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), initiating signalling cascades that lead
  to the generation of survival genes through both an NF-κB pathway, as well as through
  an alternate mechanism. In summary, we demonstrated that the in vitro spontaneous
  rate of apoptosis of human basophils is higher than that of eosinophils, and that
  IL-3 inhibits basophil apoptosis as well as up-regulating basophil CD69 surface
  expression via a PI3-K-dependent mechanism(s) that entails new RNA and protein synthesis,
  partially via NF-κB signalling. As basophils are active participants in allergic
  reactions, and IL-3 is one of the most abundant proinflammatory cytokines in the
  secretions from allergic tissue, IL-3-mediated inhibition of basophil apoptosis
  may exacerbate the inflammation associated with allergic disorders.
