caption: Models for SPR-1 and SPR-5 function. (A) SPR-1 and SPR-5 are part of a corepressor
  complex affecting the transcription of known members of the LIN-12/Notch pathway.
  Although no evidence exists, hop-1 transcription could, for example, be affected
  in a cell-specific way. Alternatively, the complex could repress the transcription
  of a subset of crucial genes for π cell fate which would not get activated in lin-12(−)
  or sel-12(−) mutants unless this repression is released. (B) SPR-1/CoREST and SPR-5/p110b
  are part of the LAG-1-associated corepressor complex. After ligand binding leads
  to the presenilin-dependent release of the intracellular domain of LIN-12 (yellow,
  noted “intra”), the corepressor complex is released and a coactivator complex formed,
  leading to activation of the target genes. (C) SPR-1 and SPR-5 form a distinct corepressor
  complex, which may interact with the LAG-1 repressor complex. The corepressor complex
  containing SPR-1 and SPR-5 is targeted to the DNA by a factor X, and is distinct
  from the LAG-1 complex. This complex, which can comprise more factors, may cooperate
  with the LAG-1 complex to potentiate repression. Association of LAG-1 and LIN-12(INTRA)
  might or might not release the CoREST corepressor complex as well.
