caption: 'Schematic representation of the chemical crosstalk between NO and H2S. From
  the NO• and HS• the intermediates HSNO and HNO (nitroxyl) are formed, directly influencing
  in the protein functions by two distinct pathways: (i) induction of disulfide bonds
  and (ii) conversion of thiolated groups in cysteine residues to N-hydroxysulfenamide
  (RSNHOH).'
