caption: Schematic diagram of the NF-κB signaling pathway. The figure places emphasis
  on the role of IκBα, showing the different degradation pathways and transcriptional
  activation of new IκBα synthesis. The newly synthesized IκBα is either degraded,
  binds to an NF-κB in the cytoplasm, or enters the nucleus and binds nuclear NF-κB.
  This feedback part of the pathway is indicated by red arrows.
