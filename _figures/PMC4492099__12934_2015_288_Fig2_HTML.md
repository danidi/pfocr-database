caption: Overview of the biosynthetic pathway for β-carotene production. The carotenoid
  biosynthetic pathway can be reconstructed in S. cerevisiae by overexpression of
  the native GGPP synthase encoded by BTS1, and co-overexpression of the non-native
  bifunctional phytoene synthase/lycopene cyclase encoded by crtYB, and phytoene desaturase
  encoded by crtI of X. dendrorhous. HMG1 encodes the major HMG-CoA reductase activity
  in S. cerevisiae. ERG9 encodes a farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyl transferase (squalene
  synthase) that acts in the sterol biosynthesis pathway. IPP isopentenyl diphosphate,
  DMAP dimethylallyl diphosphate, GPP geranyl diphosphate, FPP farnesyl diphosphate,
  GGPP geranylgeranyl diphosphate.
