caption: Repair of oxidative DNA lesions by the MMR pathway. Schematic representation
  of the hypothesised mechanisms of oxidative damage removal by MMR. ROS can induce
  lesions in the DNA, such as oxidation of guanine to 8-oxoG. These are recognised
  by MutSα which recruits MutL. The sliding clamp model of MMR proposes that the ternary
  MutSα/MutL complex moves along the DNA until it encounters RFC and PCNA bound to
  the 5' end of the daughter strand. RFC is consequently displaced which allows the
  recruitment EXO1 that mediates the degradation of the region containing the oxidative
  lesion. The resulting single-stranded gap is stabilised by the presence of RPA.
  Once the oxidative lesion is removed, EXO1 activity is no longer promoted by MutSα
  and is actually inhibited by MutL. A DNA polymerase (DNA Pol) synthesises new DNA
  to fill the gap and this is connected to the daughter strand by LIG1. The BER DNA
  glycosylase MUTYH has been shown to bind to MutSα via MSH6 whilst MutSα enhances
  the removal of 8-oxoG/A mismatched lesions by MUTYH. Tandem lesions of 8-oxoG and
  5-hydroxyuracil within OCDLs may be recognised by MutSα, leading to the recruitment
  of EXO1 and removal of all or part of the lesion. PCNA is then loaded onto the resulting
  3'OH ssDNA gap, possibly due to a direct interaction with MutSα. Rad6/Rad18 mediates
  the monoubiquitination of PCNA and MutSα is required for this process. Monoubiquitinated
  PCNA recruits DNA Polη, which synthesises new DNA across the damaged or undamaged
  template.
