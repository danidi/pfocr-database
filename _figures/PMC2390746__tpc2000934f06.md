caption: Models of CLV3 Signaling via Two Independent Receptor Systems.(A) Integration
  of CRN into the CLV/WUS feedback loop.(B) Speculative model of CLV3 receptor interactions.
  P, Phosphorylation. CLV3 is depicted as a hydroxylated peptide. Both receptor systems
  act to restrict stem cell fate in shoot and floral meristems, and their joint activities
  permit the formation of only two carpels (2.0 C) in the wild type.(C) Model of CLV3
  receptor complexes in crn and clv mutants. Recessive mutations in CRN (crn-1; [C1]),
  CLV1 (clv1-11; [C2]), or CLV2 (data not shown) cause stem cell accumulation to a
  similar degree, as indicated by the increased carpel number. (C3) crn and clv2 mutants
  are epistatic to each other, indicating that they act together and independently
  of CLV1. (C4) CLV1 acts separately from CRN and CLV2; therefore, the double mutant
  phenotypes are additive. (C5) Double mutants of crn-1 with the dominant allele clv1-1
  are phenotypically weaker than the combination of null alleles, suggesting that
  the clv1-1 receptor has residual signaling activity. (C6) The CRN/CLV2 pathway is
  subject to inhibition by the clv1-1 protein and therefore is only partially active.
