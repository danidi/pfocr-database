caption: Schematic overview of the Notch signaling pathway. Ligands of the Jagged
  and Delta-like families interrelate with Notch family receptors on an adjacent cell.
  The Notch receptor exists at the cell surface as a proteolytically cleaved heterodimer
  containing of a large ectodomain and a membrane-tethered intracellular domain. The
  receptor-ligand interaction makes two additional proteolytic cleavages that free
  the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the cell membrane. The NICD moves to
  the nucleus, where it procedures a complex with the RBPJ protein, dislocating a
  histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor (CoR) complex from the RBPJ protein. Components
  of an activation complex, such as MAML1 and histone acetyltransferases (HAc), are
  engaged to the NICD-RBPJ complex, leading to the transcriptional activation of Notch
  target genes
