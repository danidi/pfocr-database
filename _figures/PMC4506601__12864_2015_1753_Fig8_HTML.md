caption: Illustration of known and hypothesized BR signaling pathway. Integration
  of identified phosphoproteins, proposed the kinases and its substrates network from
  this study, as well as known BR response signals from literature, the BR phosphosignaling
  network was constructed. The crosstalk between BR response, auxin and ABA signaling
  was displayed. The orange, green and blue nodes denote the identified phosphoproteins
  in this study, the kinase, and the BR-related proteins, respectively. The interaction
  or relationships between proteins are obtained from literature and our bioinformatics
  inference
