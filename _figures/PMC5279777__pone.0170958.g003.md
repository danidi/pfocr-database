caption: The predicted pathway was constructed based on the references [, ]and the
  knowledge of mammalian species. Red background indicates significantly up-regulated
  expression, and yellow background indicates no significant differential expression.
  The arrows represent promotion, the solid lines indicate direct relationships between
  genes, and the dashed lines indicate that more than one step is involved in the
  process. After binding to flagellin, TLR5M triggers sequential recruitment of MyD88,
  members of IRAK (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase) family and TRAF6 that
  resulted in activation of nuclear factor NF- κB and AP-1, thus inducing production
  of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-α. After recognizing
  corresponding ligands (LPS, Muramyl Dipeptide, or bacterial RNA), NLRP1 or NLRP3
  can bind with their adaptor proteins ASC and capase-1 to form the inflammasome complex,
  and the latter promotes cleavage and secretion of biologically active pro-inflammatory
  cytokine IL-1β.
