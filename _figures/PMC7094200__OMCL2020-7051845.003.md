caption: 'Other signaling mechanisms regulated by RSV in a DCM heart. In high-glucose
  condition, RSV-induced cardioprotection can be divided into 6 parts: (1) RSV inhibits
  the TNF-α/NF-κB axis, subsequently suppressing iNOS and NADPH in cardiomyocytes,
  which finally decreases the ONOO− levels and the following oxidative stress. Moreover,
  the RSV-induced upregulated GSH-px and Nrf-2 also contribute to the antioxidative
  stress. (2) RSV also inhibits the TNF-α/NF-κB axis in vascular endothelial cells,
  thereby enhancing NO release and improving cardiac diastolic function. (3) RSV inhibits
  AT1R/MAPK and HMGB1/TLR4/RAGE pathways, thus conferring the anti-inflammatory effects
  in cardiomyocytes during hyperglycemia. (4) As for the antiapoptotic mechanisms,
  RSV activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and UCP2, which consequentially promotes the
  cytoplasm translocation of p-FoxO3a and inhibits the Cyto c release and MPTP opening,
  respectively. (5) Furthermore, RSV exerts antimetabolic effects via activating p-CoA
  and lipid accumulation in mitochondria. (6) In mCFs, RSV exerts antifibrotic effects
  via inhibiting the ROS/ERK/TGF-β pathway and activating PPARγ. Besides, RSV inhibits
  the FGF2 binding activity to FGFR and HSPG in mCF surface, which also reduces mCF
  proliferation in high-glucose condition.'
