caption: Proposed SLCO1B3-related mechanisms of anticancer drug resistance. ① Loss
  of Lt-SLCO1B3 contributes to taxane resistance. Taxane anticancer agents, which
  suppress microtubule dynamics and result in cell death by apoptosis, are the substrates
  of SLCO1B3. Downregulated SLCO1B3 may cause less disposition of taxane, leading
  to subsequent resistance. ② Overexpression of Ct-SLCO1B3. Overexpressed Ct-SLCO1B3
  alters the p53-dependent signaling pathway which cause reduced p53, P21WAF1, and
  PUMA expression. Additionally, Ct-SLCO1B3 has minimal transport function and leads
  to decreased disposition of anticancer drugs. ③ Overexpression of Lt-SLCO1B3 works
  against ADT therapy in prostate cancer. Intraprostatic testosterone concentration
  is decreased during androgen deprivation therapy due to the inhibited production
  of testosterone by testes. In the testosterone scavenging mechanism, testosterone
  enters into prostate tumor cells not only through SLCO1B3 transporters but also
  through simple diffusion. A positive feedback mechanism may induce the expression
  of SLCO1B3 to increase the testosterone intake of prostate tumor cells. In SLCO1B3-overexpressed
  prostate cells, more testosterone is influxed into cells. ④ Genetic variations of
  SLCO1B3 affect its transportation function. The expression of SLCO1B3 may be regulated
  by Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor (HNF) 3β, DNA methylation, and HIF-1α that varies depending
  on tissues types. The red down arrow represents the reduction of these molecules.
  The red up arrow represents the increase of these molecules. The black down arrow
  represents the reduction of these drugs. The black up arrow represents the increase
  of these drugs.
