caption: Influence of ammonium (NH4+) nutrition on methylglyoxal (MG) metabolism.
  MG production and accumulation are promoted by increased sugar concentration and
  enhanced glycolysis. MG may be produced also in chloroplasts from triose phosphate
  isomers (TPs) in the Calvin-Benson cycle (CB cycle). In tissue extracts, catabolism
  of MG in a glutathione (GSH)-dependent glyoxalase pathway comprised of glyoxalase
  I (GLXI) and glyoxalase II (GLXII) resulting in production of less toxic S-D-lactoylglutathione
  and D-lactate is enhanced. Additionally, chloroplastic isoforms of GLXI (chlGLXI)
  and GLXII (chlGLXII) have higher activity. In contrast, the cellular level of D-lactate
  remains stable. Mitochondrial metabolism of the MG-intermediates catabolic pathway
  is down-regulated. Mitochondrial glyoxalase II (mtGLXII) activity decreases. D-lactate
  is subsequently converted to pyruvate through the activity of mitochondrial D-lactate
  dehydrogenase (D-LDH) and electrons are transferred to the respiratory chain through
  cytochrome c (cyt c). In NH4+-grown plants, D-LDH activity is decreased, but not
  due to the low availability of the oxidized form of cytochrome c because cyt c protein
  levels in those plants are higher. Additionally, Complex III activity decreases
  and Complex IV activity remains stable. Pyruvate produced by D-LDH enters into the
  tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle that is enhanced to meet the demand of carbon skeletons
  for NH4+ assimilation. Over-accumulation of MG in the cell leads to formation of
  MG-derived advanced glycation end products (MAGEs). Modified proteins usually undergo
  structural and functional impairment that causes cellular dysfunction and mediates
  NH4+ toxicity. The difference in enzyme activities or metabolite levels between
  NH4+-grown and NO3–-grown plants are indicated by colors; increases are marked with
  blue, decreases with red, and lack of change with yellow letters. Results for whole
  leaf tissue extracts are presented in brackets as arrows (increases are marked with
  blue) or the equal sign (lack of change is marked with yellow).
