caption: Intramembrane proteolysis in cancer related signaling. (A) Receptor tyrosine
  kinase, ErbB4 (green) is shedded by ADAM10 or 17 and is then cleaved by γ-secretase
  releasing ErbB4 ICD (E4ICD). The ICD includes the tyrosine kinase domain and can
  either get degraded by the proteasome or translocate to the nucleus. Increased nuclear
  translocation of E4ICD in breast cancer cells boosts transcription of genes related
  to survival and growth. (B) FKBP8 (blue) is a tail anchored type-II transmembrane
  protein in the ER and a physiological inhibitor of the mTORC pathway. SPP can directly
  cleave FKBP8 and increase of SPP expression by tumor cells can lead to strong reduction
  of FKBP8 levels and a strong activation of the mTORC pathway. Through its transcriptional
  functions, mTORC can increase transcription of genes boosting cell growth, migration
  and invasion of tumor cells. (C) Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (pink) is a tail anchored
  enzyme located in the ER. HO-1 can be cleaved by SPP and the ICD released in the
  cytosol can translocate to the nucleus. Increased expression of SPP in tumor cells,
  results in increased nuclear HO-1 ICD, which boost tumor growth and survival.
