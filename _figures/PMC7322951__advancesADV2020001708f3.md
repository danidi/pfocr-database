caption: Effects of accumulated lysosomal products on cellular and tissue homeostasis.
  (1) Accumulation of GAGs in the lysosome leads to enlargement of the lysosome, followed
  by a loss of membrane integrity. Leakage of H+ out of the lysosome results in a
  higher pH and may lead to compromised activity of lysosomal hydrolases and secondary
  lysosomal storage. Furthermore, the higher pH results in impaired fusion of endolysosomes
  and autolysosomes and a reduced recycling of the M6P receptor. Finally, enlarged
  lysosomes have decreased diffusion ability inside the cell. (2) Enlargement of the
  lysosome ultimately results in lysosomal rupture with the escape of cathepsins and
  proteases in the cell. Simultaneously, lysosomal rupture leads to increased concentration
  of H+ and Ca2+ in the cytosol. Together, this results in increased reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) production, necrosis, and apoptosis of cells. (3) The dysfunctional
  lysosome leads to impaired autophagy and fusion with endolysosomes. Therefore, increased
  lifespans are seen for autolysosomes and endolysosomes. Impaired autophagy subsequently
  results in mitochondrial dysfunction. (4) The increased concentration of cytosolic
  Ca2+ and cellular stress stimulates the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs).
  This is an alternative protective route for the cell to maintain cellular homeostasis.
  (5) The accumulation of GAGs in the cell and the secondary affected mechanisms result
  in tissue alterations and destruction. Connective tissue is the most affected tissue
  in MPS patients. Studies show altered proteoglycan turnover, altered fibril spacing
  and alignment, and altered chondrocyte distribution and disruption leading to increased
  concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor
  of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). Depending on the type of GAG, undegraded GAGs lead
  to inhibition or activation of cathepsin K, which is necessary for the degradation
  of aggrecan and collagen I and II. Finally, HS and cellular stress lead to inflammation
  via activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway. DAMPs, damage associated
  molecular patterns.
