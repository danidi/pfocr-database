caption: Signaling by spindle attachment defects. Two independent pathways act to
  delay anaphase. The spindle attachment pathway senses kinetochore tension and is
  especially efficient for detecting monotelic and syntelic attachments, and the DNA
  damage pathway acts as an additional mechanism that responds to DSB generated by
  merotelic attachments. When kinetochore attachment defects are undetected, for example
  in tumors with a CIN phenotype (grey), merotelic attachments and DSB increase, leading
  to activation of the DNA damage pathway and ultimately to mitotic slippage.

papertitle: Merotelic attachments and non-homologous end joining are the basis of
  chromosomal instability.
