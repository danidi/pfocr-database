caption: Oxidative stress from UUO injury resulted in the accumulation of the damaged
  mitochondria, which can induce autophagy machinery as well as NLRP3 inflammasome
  signaling pathway. Activated NLRP3 forms a protein complex, the inflammasome, which
  induces caspase-1 activation that results in the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines IL-1β. Increased IL-1β stimulates the accumulation of MYC and upregulated
  MYC target gene, which contributes renal progressive TIF. Induced autophagy resulted
  from oxidative stress and the accumulation of the damaged mitochondria regulates
  NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathway, which attenuates the apoptosis of TECs and
  renal progressive TIF in response to UUO injury
