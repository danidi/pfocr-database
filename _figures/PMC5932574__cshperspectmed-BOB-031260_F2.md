caption: 'Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)23/FGFR1/αKlotho signaling. The FGF23 receptor
  consists of a homodimer of tyrosine kinase FGF receptors (FGFRs) (types 1c, 3c,
  or 4) and the αKlotho coreceptor. αKlotho contains two extracellular domains: a
  transmembrane domain and an intracytoplasmic domain. Homodimerization and FGF23
  binding results in transphosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase domains and initiates
  the cascade of intracellular signaling. FGFs initiate signaling through many pathways,
  including phospholipase C (PLC)-γ–protein kinase C (PKC), CRKL, Ras-mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK), and PI3-Akt. However, the most common pathway for FGF23 is
  the MAPK pathway type ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2), which
  is activated by phosphorylation of FGFR substrate-2α (FRS2α), constitutively associated
  with the juxtamembrane domain of the FGFR.'
