caption: 'Outline of the major phases of plant immune responses. Pathogen detection
  can take place through direct interactions between pathogen-associated molecular
  patterns (PAMPs) and transmembrane receptor-like kinases RLKs or pathogen effectors
  and intracellular NLRs (CNLs and TNLs). After detection CNLs and TNLs trigger different
  signaling pathways: the pathway activated by PAMP binding involves a cascade of
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and activation of WRKY transcription factors.
  A second pathway is activated by cytoplasmic proteins EDS1, PAD4, NDR1 and salicylic
  acid (SA). Both pattern triggered immunity (PTI) and effector triggered immunity
  (ETI) pathways result in a response where pathogenesis-related (PR) genes are upregulated.
  These include genes encoding defensins, chitinases, β-1,3-glucanases, protease inhibitors
  and lipid transfer proteins. As an example, transportation and secretion of defensins,
  which like other PR proteins have pathogen-killing activity, is indicated'
