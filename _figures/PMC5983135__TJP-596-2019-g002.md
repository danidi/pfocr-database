caption: A, the α1 subunit of DHPR is composed of 4 membrane domains (I–IV) that each
  contain 6 transmembrane segments. The 4 membrane domains are organized to form a
  pore that conducts Ca2+ ions and opens in response to depolarization. Domain I has
  been omitted for the sake of clarity. In each domain, segment 4 is enriched with
  positively charged residues (+) that confer voltage dependence to the channel. B,
  replacement of the second basic residue by a histidine in the S4 segment of domain
  IV for the R1239H HypoPP1 mutation and of valine by a glutamate in the S3 segment
  of domain III for the V876E HypoPP1 mutation generate an inward gating pore current
  at negative voltages through a pathway located within the voltage‐sensing domain
  and distinct from the main Ca2+ conducting pore. The gating pore current was found
  to be carried by H+ and Na+ for the R1239H and the V876E HypoPP1 mutations, respectively
  (Fuster et al. , ).
