caption: Schematic representation of the strategy used for low acetate producers.
  (A) Metabolic pathway of acetic acid production in B. animalis subsp. lactis DSM10140.
  Pathways obtained from KEGG. (B) Uptake of fluoroacetate through the central metabolism
  of bifidobacteria irreversibly inhibits aconitate hydratase, blocking anabolic pathways
  and leading to bacterial death.
