caption: Following diapedesis, neutrophils continue to follow chemotactic gradients
  to the site of injury. Neutrophils bind IL-8, (CXCL)-1,2, and other stimuli that
  activate G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). G protein subunits activate the phospholipase
  C (PLC) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. At the sensory end (purple)
  of the polarized neutrophil the PLC pathway activates downstream calcium signaling
  and protein kinase C. The PI3K pathway activates Rac which permits F-actin polymerization
  and aids in production of protrusions that improve the neutrophil ability to respond
  to sensory information. On the other end of the polarized neutrophil, the motile
  end (pink), PLC induces calcium signaling that promotes contractility and motility.
  PI3K activates RhoA leading to downstream phosphorylation of myosin light chain
  (MLC) and aids in contraction. Together these mechanisms allow the neutrophil to
  navigate to the infarct area. Created with BioRender.com
