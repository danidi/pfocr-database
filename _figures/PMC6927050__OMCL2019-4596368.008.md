caption: Schematic diagram of hypoxia-induced pyroptosis in myoblasts. Hypoxia increases
  ROS production, which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome to release activated caspase-1.
  Activated caspase-1 cleaves GSDMD into GSDMD-p30 and pro-IL-1β into mature IL-1β,
  leading to membrane rupture and inflammatory responses. Moreover, hypoxia induces
  the nuclear translocation of the key transcriptional factor HIF-1α and activates
  the NF-κB signaling pathway, regulating the transcription of myogenic and inflammatory
  genes.
