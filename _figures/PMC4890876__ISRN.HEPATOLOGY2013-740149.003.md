caption: All of animal cells may be intrinsically programmed to self-destruct. The
  activation of apoptosis causes cell death instantaneously unless the cell death
  is inhibited by survival signals. The various antiapoptotic molecules as well as
  proapoptotic factors have been identified. The apoptotic cell death requires the
  interplay of a multitude of factors. These related factors are organized in a tight
  and efficient manner in the mediation and regulation of apoptotic signaling. The
  members of IAP family and iNOS can inhibit caspases along extrinsic or intrinsic
  pathways. Bcl-2 family mainly regulates the intrinsic pathway in cytoplasm. Mitochondrial
  proteins Smac/Diablo and Prss25/HtrA2/Omi modulate IAP activity as well. Transcription
  factors such as NF-κB and p53 mediate apoptosis through up- or downregulation of
  apoptosis-related gene expression in nuclei. The detailed regulatory mechanisms
  still need to be determined.
