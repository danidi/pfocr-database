caption: 'Differential regulation of methanogenesis genes. Methanogenesis pathway
  of M. maripaludis together with corresponding bicluster membership information is
  shown. Methanogenesis from CO2 occurs in four reduction steps, two C-1 transfer
  steps, and one dehydration step. Note that the Fd that donates electrons to Fmd/Fwd
  can be reduced in two ways—by electron bifurcation from Hdr or by the Eha hydrogenase.
  Dotted arrows indicate coupling of metabolic steps with membrane ion gradients.
  Biosynthetic CO2 fixation to acetylCoA and pyruyvate is also shown. Colors in enzyme
  designations denote bicluster membership as indicated in the color key in the lower
  left corner (see  for their member genes). The main methanogenesis pathway genes
  are included in four biclusters, bc_0114 (red), bc_0009 (pink), bc_0019 (green),
  and bc_0035 (purple). The other two biclusters, bc_0133 (brown) and bc_0010 (blue),
  include genes involved in reactions that are related to methanogenesis such as electron
  bifurcation and carbon fixation (see text for details). Transcriptional changes
  of member genes of each of the biclusters are shown in Supplemental Figure S2. Genes
  encoding enzymes: (Cdh) carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetylCoA synthase; (Eha)
  energy-conserving hydrogenase A; (Ehb) energy-conserving hydrogenase B; (Fdh) formate
  dehydrogenase; (Fmd/Fwd) formyl-methanofuran dehydrogenase; (Fru/c) F420-reducing
  hydrogenase; (Ftr) formyl-methanofuran-H4-methanopterin formyltransferase; (Hdr)
  heterodisulfide reductase; (Hmd) H2-dependent methylene-H4-methanopterin dehydrogenase;
  (Mch) methenyl-H4-methanopterin cyclohydrolase; (Mcr) methyl-coenzyme M reductase;
  (Mer) methylene-H4-methanopterin reductase; (Mtd) F420-dependent methylene-H4-methanopterin
  dehydrogenase; (Mtr) methyl-H4-methanopterin-coenzyme M methyltransferase; (Por)
  pyruvate oxidoreductase; (Vhu/c) F420-nonreducing (Hdr-associated) hydrogenase.
  Metabolites: (Fd) ferredoxin; (MFR) methanofuran; (H4MPT) tetrahydromethanopterin;
  (CoM) coenzyme M.'
