caption: The influence of the Zip14 null deletion on reduced liver zinc and increased
  iron uptake is shown. Up-regulation of Zip14 by LPS via toll like receptor 4 (TLR4)
  in liver and activation of the NFKB pathway leading to increased IL6, for an autocrine
  response, and from macrophage-produced IL-6. The suppression of IR activation by
  IL-6 and cAMP-induced SOCSs is also shown. The apparent reduction in glucagon production
  in pancreatic α cells and the effect on cellular cAMP in the Zip14 KO mice are proposed.
  We hypothesize that these signaling events produce hypoglycemia by a reduction in
  gluconeogenesis.
