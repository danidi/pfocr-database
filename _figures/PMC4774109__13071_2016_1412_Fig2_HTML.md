caption: Dysfunctional humoral response during visceral leishmaniasis. The picture
  summarizes the sequence of events that lead to a suboptimal humoral response during
  visceral leishmaniasis, based primarily on data from our recent study in non-human
  primates compounded with evidence from additional studies. (1) Shortly after parasite
  inoculation, B cells are activated in a non-specific manner by soluble parasite
  products that act as B cell mitogens as well as by inflammatory mediators generated
  during the response to infection. (2) As a result, B cells with the atypical CD21−
  CD27− phenotype expand and eventually give rise to plasmablasts that produce copious
  amounts of immunoglobulin leading to the occurrence of hypergammaglobulinemia. (3)
  Some B cells appear to be activated in a specific manner via their BCR and follow
  the follicular pathway where they engage in cognate interactions with pre-Tfh cells.
  (4) If these interactions are productive, both cell types proceed to form a germinal
  center where Tfh cells promote affinity maturation of B cell for their specific
  antigen and direct the selection of the B cells clones with the highest affinity.
  B cells then exit the germinal center as high-affinity CD27+ memory B cells and
  plasma cells that produce antibodies with high affinity for the parasite. (5) However,
  the germinal center response is not sustained during the chronic phase of infection
  accompanying the decreasing numbers of Tfh cells. A strong Th1-polarizing environment
  is established in the spleen during VL, with high levels of expression of T-bet
  in CD4 T cells. Given that T-bet and the Tfh master transcription factor, Bcl-6,
  mutually repress each other’s expression, it is reasonable to speculate that the
  inflammatory environment during VL is unfavourable for the sustained differentiation
  of Tfh cells
