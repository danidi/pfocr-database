caption: Model of A3 activation of BER and MMR. Our data are consistent with A3 family
  members deaminating the extrahelical cytosine at cisplatin and carboplatin ICLs.
  The subsequent uracil induced by the A3s activates the BER pathway, specifically
  via UNG recruitment followed by APE1 incision at the abasic site. Polβ synthesizes
  DNA downstream of the ICL and preferentially misincorporates nucleotides, which
  leads to recruitment of the MMR proteins. The subsequent futile cycle of processing
  the flanking DNA at the ICLs results in blocking productive ICL DNA repair and leads
  to enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin and carboplatin.
