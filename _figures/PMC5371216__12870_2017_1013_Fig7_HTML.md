caption: Concordance between the abundance of intermediates in the biosynthesis of
  Raffinose Family Oligosaccharides (RFO) and the transcripts encoding the enzymes
  of the pathway during the dehydration-rehydration cycle in young leaf tissues of
  S. stapfianus. A single longitudinal bar directly under the compound in the pathway
  represents the metabolite abundance heat map for each compound. The data used to
  generate the metabolite heat maps are reported in Oliver et al 2011. Red shading
  indicates a statistically significant fold increase in abundance and green shading
  a statistically significant fold decrease in metabolite abundance. White indicates
  no change in metabolite abundance. For the dehydrating samples (60% RWC to DRY)
  the fold change is given in relation to the hydrated control, where red shading
  indicates a statistically significant increase in abundance compared to the hydrated
  control for the dehydrating samples. For the rehydrating samples the fold change
  is given in relation to either the dry samples (/D) or the hydrated control (/H).
  The longitudinal bars directly associated with the enzyme identity in the pathway
  represent the transcript abundance heat map for each enzyme. Each line in the heat
  map constitutes a single contig annotated as encoding the associated enzyme. Red
  shading indicates a statistically significant the log2-fold increase in abundance
  and green shading a statistically significant the log2-fold decrease in abundance.
  Black indicates no change in transcript abundance. For the dehydrating samples (80%
  RWC to DRY) the log2-fold change in abundance is given in relation to the hydrated
  control. For the rehydrating samples log2-fold change in abundance is given in relation
  to either the dry samples (/DRY) or the hydrated control (/HYD)
