caption: ER stress and UPR. Upper panel—the three transmembrane receptor proteins
  that are responsible for triggering UPR in cells experiencing ER stress. Lower panel—induction
  of asns transcription through the PERK/eIF2/ATF4 pathway. During UPR, PERK phosphorylates
  elf2α, which in turn elevates the translation of the transcription factor ATF4.
  ATF4 upregulates the transcription of several genes including that of asns.
