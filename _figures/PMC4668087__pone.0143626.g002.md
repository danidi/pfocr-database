caption: a) The siroheme biosynthetic pathway in prokaryotes. b) The biotin biosynthetic
  pathway from pimelate; yellow colored metabolites indicate root deadends. Numbers
  in brackets refer to the total number of GSMs in which the reactions were found
  blocked and present, respectively. Metabolite abbreviations can be found in .
