caption: Model for βarrs' involvement in the Toll signaling pathway in shrimp. In
  shrimp, the Toll signaling pathway is activated by bacterial challenge. The transcription
  factor Dorsal is translocated into the nucleus and ERK is phosphorylated. Several
  effector molecules (ALF-C2, CruI-1, and TNFSF) were then expressed. βarrs interact
  with Cactus to form the βarr·Cactus·Dorsal complex, which inhibits Cactus phosphorylation
  and degradation, thereby preventing Dorsal from translocating into nucleus, resulting
  in inhibition of the activation of the Toll pathway. βarrs also interact with inactive
  ERK to inhibit its phosphorylation by MEK, and subsequently inhibits Dorsal translocating
  into nucleus and Ser276 phosphorylation of Dorsal. Finally, the activation of the
  Toll pathway is limited to prevent an inappropriate inflammatory response.
