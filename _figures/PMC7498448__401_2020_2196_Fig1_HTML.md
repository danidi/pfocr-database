caption: a The two pathways through which APP can be cleaved. The non-amyloidogenic
  (α) pathway (left-hand side of diagram) involves the cleavage of APP by α-secretase,
  within the Aβ sequence, to form C-terminal fragment α (CTFα) and soluble APP α (sAPPα).
  γ-secretase then cleaves the resulting CTFα, releasing the Aβ intracellular domain
  (AICD) and the extracellular p3 fragment. The amyloidogenic (β) pathway (right-hand
  side of the diagram) involves the cleavage of APP by BACE1 to form CTFβ and sAPPβ.
  γ-secretase then cleaves the resulting CTFβ, releasing the AICD and Aβ. b Aβ monomers
  can assemble to form higher order structures, from oligomers, to protofibrils and
  eventually mature fibrils containing β-sheets which form the core component of amyloid
  plaques. Created with https://biorender.com/
