caption: Signalling mechanism of nitrate mediated auxin modulation induces lateral
  root growth; (A) (a) NRT1.1 initially senses, taken up and transport by the NRT1.1
  transporter, thereby changing its uptake affinity and modulating phosphorylation
  to activate signalling pathway. In low nitrate conditions, the phosphorylation switches
  NRT1.1 into the high-affinity system. This sensing ability of NO3− altering NRT1.1
  phosphorylation causes calcium (Ca2+) efflux by the activation of phospholipase
  C (PLC). This results in varying the expression of (TGA1/4*) and nitrate transporter
  genes (NRT2.1, NRT2.2, NRT3.1) and nitrate assimilation genes (NIA1 and NiR). (b)
  T101A/chl1 mutant triggers Ca2+-ANR1 signalling from the endosomes under high NO3−
  supply. (c) Under adequate NO3− supply, AFB3 regulates NAC4 and OBP4 expression,
  which as a result affect the root renovation. (d) Finally, as a result of nitrate
  assimilation organic nitrogen is produced, this system includes miR167 and miR393,
  which regulates AFB3 and ARF8, respectively (B) In Auxin response network; Class
  ARF directly connects to the AuxRE (red arrow). Under low nitrate conditions, AUX/IAAs
  and TPLs repress transcriptional activation by class-ARFs. The degradation of Aux/IAA
  released this inhibition by connecting auxin and TIR1/AFB. (See text for further
  details).*TGA1/4 regulatory factors mediate nitrate response inside Arabidopsis
  root, and while the link of TGA4 to PLC is not approved. Other transcription factors,
  for instance, NRG2, NLP7, connection to Ca2+signalling is currently unknown.
