caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways involving CO and other
  signaling molecules in plant growth and development. Auxin (IAA; ), hydrogen sulfide
  (H2S; ), hydrogen-rich water (HRW; ), and MRW () induce the up-regulation of heme
  oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide (HO-1/CO), thus ultimately resulting in the adventitious
  root (AR) formation through activating a series of upstream signaling molecules
  including NO synthase/nitric oxide (NOS/NO), guanylate cyclase (GC), cyclic GMP
  (cGMP), and Ca2+. HO/CO signaling system is required for wheat seed germination
  probably by activating NOS/NO (). Abscisic acid (ABA) induces CO synthetic via upregulating
  HO activity which triggers an overproduction of NO by (nitrate reductase) NR. Subsequently,
  this NO production further activates a cGMP-dependent transduction pathway, thus
  leading to stomatal closure (). Meanwhile, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) signaling might
  be involved in CO induced-stomatal closure (). The red, black, and blue lines represent
  the signaling pathways of seed germination, AR development, and stomatal closure,
  respectively. The pathways using dashed lines still not fully clear.
