caption: 'Simplified model of transcriptional regulation of central metabolic pathways
  and cellular activities. General overview (A) and details of the acetate pathway
  (B). The flow of metabolites including energy currency metabolites such as NAD(P)H
  and ATP is indicated in black. Pathway regulation by transcription and sigma factors
  is indicated in pink: activation (+, line ending arrow) and inhibition (−, line
  ending bar). Regulation of transcription and sigma factors by metabolites and low
  molecular weight signal molecules is indicated in blue: activation/stabilisation
  (+, line ending arrow) and deactivation (−, line ending bar). The list of abbreviations
  is found at the end of the Additional file : Figure S9. The construction of this
  simplified model of transcriptional regulation is based on data found in RegulonDB
  (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) [].'
