caption: 'Panel A: During normal B-cell maturation, activated B-cells form germinal
  centers (GC) (shaded circle) in order to form high affinity antibodies. Mature B-cells
  first become centroblasts, highly proliferating cells in which BCL6 expression is
  induced. These cells form the dark zone of the GC. Pictured below the centroblast
  cell is a representation of BCL6 and its three domains, the BTB, RD2 and Zinc fingers.
  BCL6 contributes to the centroblast phenotype by directly repressing the ATR, CHEK1,
  TP53 and CDKN1A genes through its BTB domain in order to facilitate proliferation
  and survival during class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. BCL6 also
  represses the PRDM1 gene mostly through its second repression domain in order to
  block further differentiation. Centroblasts eventually migrate to a more heterogeneous
  area of the GC called the light zone where they encounter T-cells and follicular
  dendritic cells (FDC). CD40 signaling by T-cells can block the function of the BCL6
  BTB domain by blocking its association with N-CoR and thus de-repress checkpoint
  genes. This presumably allows B cells damaged during affinity maturation to be weeded
  out (an apoptotic B-cell is pictured attached to a T-cells). Repression of PRDM1
  is independent of the BTB domain, which allows B-cells to sustained blockade of
  PRDM1 and thus prevents premature differentiation. When CD40 signaling is transient
  these effects are reversible so that B-cells could maintain the centroblast phenotype
  and undergo further rounds of affinity maturation. More sustained CD40 signaling
  can induce IRF4 mediated repression of BCL6 and facilitate terminal differentiation
  of GC B cells selected by the FDCs into plasma cells or memory cells. GC B cells
  that have reached this stage in the light zone are called centrocytes. BCL6 can
  also be downregulated through the ATM pathway via proteolytic degradation when genomic
  damage reaches a critical level in B-cells. Panel B: Translocations or point mutations
  of the BCL6 locus can cause it to be expression constitutively and contribute to
  malignant transformation. Exposure of DLBCL cells to BPI can block the repressor
  effect of the BCL6 BTB domain and induce expression of ATR, CHEK1, TP53 and CDKN1A
  resulting in cell death. Downregulation of MTA3 can block the repressor effect of
  the RD2 and induce PRDM1 resulting in differentiation.'
