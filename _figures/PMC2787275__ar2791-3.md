caption: 'Intracellular signaling pathways used to regulate the activity of estrogens,
  estrogen receptors, and selective estrogen receptor modulators on articular tissues.
  Pathway 1: canonical estrogen signaling pathway (estrogen response element (ERE)-dependent)
  - ligand-activated estrogen receptors (ERs) bind specifically to EREs in the promoter
  of target genes. Pathway 2: non-ERE estrogen signaling pathway - ligand-bound ERs
  interact with other transcription factors, such as activator protein (AP)-1, NF-κB
  and Sp1, forming complexes that mediate the transcription of genes whose promoters
  do not harbor EREs. Co-regulator molecules regulate the activity of the transcriptional
  complexes. Pathway 3: non-genomic estrogen signaling pathways - ERs and GP30 localized
  at or near the cell membrane might elicit the rapid response by activating the phosphatidylinositol-3/Akt
  (PI3K/Akt) and/or protein kinase C/mitogen activated protein kinase (PKC/MAPK) signal
  transduction pathways. Pathway 4: ligand-independent pathways - ERs can be stimulated
  by growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, transforming growth
  factor-β/mothers against decapentaplegic (TGF-β/SMAD), epidermal growth factor (EGF)
  and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in the absence of ligands, either by direct
  interaction or by MAP and PI3/Akt kinase-mediated phosphorylation. Since members
  of these signaling pathways are transcription factors, some of them, such as SMADs
  3/4, can elicit estrogen responses by interacting with ER in the non-ERE-dependent
  genomic pathway. ERK, extracellular signal regulated kinase; GF, growth factor;
