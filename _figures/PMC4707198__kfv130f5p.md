caption: 'Schematic illustration of Hog1-mediated posttranslational and transcriptional
  hyperosmotic stress response pathway. At low stress levels, activated Hog1 posttranslationally
  alters the activities of a suite of enzymes involved in glycerol metabolism (Pfk2,
  Tdh, Gpd1, Fps1, etc.), resulting in increased production and decreased exportation
  of intracellular glycerol. At high stress levels, Hog1 activates transcription factor
  Hot1, which transcriptionally regulates the expression of the enzymes above, resulting
  in alterations in their abundance, which helps increase intracellular glycerol concentration
  on a longer time scale. Denotations of line colors: blue, posttranslational control;
  red, transcriptional control; green, common pathway shared by both posttranslational
  and transcriptional control. Denotations of colored arrow heads: pointed, activation;
  blunted, inhibition; dotted, activation or inhibition depending on target.'
