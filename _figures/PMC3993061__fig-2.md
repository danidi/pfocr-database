caption: Cell contacts with the ECM affect the production of ROS. Detachment of cells
  from their ECM substratum and ECM deprivation, along with a lack of growth factors,
  decreases the activity of PI3K and consequently of protein kinase Akt. Transcription
  factors, repressed by Akt, are activated and upregulate the expression of PDK, especially
  PDK4, which phosphorylates/inactivates PDH. Together, with a diminished uptake of
  nutrients, glucose (Glc) and glutamine (Gln), this exacerbates fuel deprivation
  for the citric acid cycle and hence, a shortage of ATP. Likewise, lack of fuel for
  the PPP reduces the concentration of NADPH, which serves as reducing and scavenging
  agent for H2O2 and other ROS. To compensate the low levels of ATP and NADPH, peroxisomal
  FA degradation by FAO is likely turned on with a concomitant release of additional
  H2O2, which further increases the redox potential of ECM-deprived cells. The metabolic
  effect of ECM deprivation resulting in increased ROS production has recently been
  reviewed by Grassian et al. (). PI3K, phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase; PDK, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase kinases; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway;
  FA, fatty acid; FAO, fatty acid oxidase.
