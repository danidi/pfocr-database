caption: In the tumor microenvironment, PD-1/CTLA-4 molecules on activated T cells
  are up-regulated and combined to PD-L1/PD-L2 or CD80/CD86 molecules on tumor cells.
  Consequently, T cell activity is inhibited, and an immunosuppressive microenvironment
  is formed, which leads to tumor cells escaping the immune surveillance and growing
  wildly. ICIs restore anti-tumor activity of T cells by targeting and blocking PD-1
  or CTLA-4 signaling pathway. Activated T cells kill tumor cells and may attack normal
  human tissue cells, forming ICIs-related toxicities. PD-1, programmed cell death
  protein 1; PD-L1/2, programmed cell death ligand 1/2; CTLA-4, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated
  antigen-4; ICIs, immune checkpoint inhibitors; MHC, major histocompatibility complex;
  TCR, T cell receptor.
