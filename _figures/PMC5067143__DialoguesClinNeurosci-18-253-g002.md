number: Figure 2
caption: (Opposite and overleaf) Visualizing drug action. Illustration of the effect
  of afatinib on receptor tyrosine signaling (eg, EGFR) and major downstream pathways,
  such as the MAP kinase cascade and PI3K/AKT signaling. (A) Diagram of the model
  network, illustrating its complexity. Colors of nodes represent fold change in concentration
  of model species (see scale) due to inhibition by afatinib as predicted by the in
  silico model. (B) Afatinib's major target is the EGF/EGFR signaling pathway. Visualization
  of one branch of this pathway shows the strong inhibitory effect of afatinib on
  downstream network components (shown in green). ABL1, Abelson murine leukemia viral
  oncogene homolog 1; ADAM10, A Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing
  protein 10; AKT, protein kinase B; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; ERBB2,
  formerly HER2 or HER2/neu; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PI3K, phosphoinositide
  3-kinase; PLCG1, phospholipase C γ 1 SHC1, SHC (Src homology 2 domain containing)
  transforming protein 1; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.
