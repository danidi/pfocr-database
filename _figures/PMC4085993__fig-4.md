caption: Schematic representation of the proposed myelination pathway in SC. The scheme
  described the myelination pathway in SC proposed by Salis and coworkers. Question
  marks indicate the still not conclusive results obtained on the role of human transferrin
  (hTf) and low Fe3+ amount on SC differentiation (). The data presented, although
  suggestive, do not allow a definitive conclusion on the role of hTf in SC differentiation.
  To further substantiate the presented results, it would be important to assess the
  role of Fe3+ and hTf in myelinating cocultures and to determine whether this may
  impact the effectiveness of NRG1 signaling in SC differentiation and in myelination.
