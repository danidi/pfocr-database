caption: Functional relationships between selected top metabolite findings. Compounds
  measured in our study are color-coded to illustrate their significance levels in
  the haloperidol (haldol) versus control analysis. Effect directions in the haloperidol-treated
  animals are illustrated by arrows to the right of measured compounds. Ceramide synthesis
  takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, while synthesis of sphingomyelin occurs
  in the golgi body (see Small molecular Pathway Database SMPDB00034 sphingolipid
  metabolism ()). Sphingomyelin is the major component of the insulating myelin sheath
  that surrounds axons. Demyelination has been previously associated with elevated
  N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) levels, also observed in our study.
