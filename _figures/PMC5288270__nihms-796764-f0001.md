caption: Panel A depicts nucleation promotion factors (NPFs) that regulate the activity
  of ARP2/3 complex in a healthy state. NPFs include Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
  (N-WASP) protein encoded by WASL, WASP family Verprolin-homologous (WAVE) proteins,
  cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein I (CYFIP1) and cortactin that act downstream
  of Rho GTPases such as CDC42 and RAC. Activation of the ARP2/3 complex by multiple
  nucleation promotion factors results in actin nucleation and polymerization to generate
  F-actin branched filaments from existing F-actin monomers. Arrows indicate activation.
  Panel B illustrates the molecular cascades of ARP2/3 complex dysregulation in schizophrenia.
  The marked decrement in mRNA levels for CYFIP1, cortactin and N-WASP and ARP2/3
  complex subunits in DLPFC layer 3 pyramidal cells converge to decrease F-actin nucleation
  and polymerization required for spinogenesis contributing to spine deficits.
