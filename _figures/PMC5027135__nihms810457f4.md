caption: A new model of MC4R microcircuitry. The Yin–Yang model of α-MSH and AgRP
  action () suggested competitive binding of these peptides to individual MC4R sites
  (orange box), and anatomical data suggest in regions where these peptides undergo
  volume release, that competition for binding to the MC4R may occur. New subcellular
  anatomical data suggest that in the PVH, AgRP synaptic contacts predominate at cell
  bodies, while POMC synaptic contacts predominate at distal dendrites. Along with
  the fact that AgRP immunoreactive fibers are only observed in a subset of MC4R expressing
  nuclei containing POMC-immunoreactive fibers, α-MSH may this often act independently
  of AgRP (right circle). At these sites, α-MSH may be expected to signal through
  both cAMP, and Kir7.1. The ability of AgRP to act independently of α-MSH as a potent
  hyperpolarizing agonist, via regulation of Kir7.1, suggests the likely existence
  of independent AgRP sites of action (left circle). Another MC4R signaling pathway,
  involving cAMP/PKA-dependent activation of KATP channels and α-MSH-induced hyperpolarization,
  has been demonstrated in MC4R neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in
  the brainstem (bottom right). Thus, α-MSH and AgRP utilize a diversity of signaling
  modalities to regulate feeding and energy homeostasis through the MC4R. Modified,
