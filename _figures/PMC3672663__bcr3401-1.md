caption: 'Model of the canonical Hedgehog signalling pathway in mammals. (A) In the
  absence of Hedgehog (Hh) ligand, the receptor Patched (Ptch) inhibits the activation
  of Smoothened (Smo) by preventing its surface translocation into the cilium. The
  Glioma-associated (GLI) proteins are phosphorylated and processed to truncated repressor
  forms. This inactive GLI protein complex functions as a transcriptional repressor
  of Hh target gene expression. Suppressor of fused (SUFU) inhibits GLI1 and GLI2
  from entering the nucleus by sequestering the complex to the microtubules and represses
  transcription. (B) The binding of Hh ligands to Ptch releases the repression on
  Smo, leading to the movement of Smo from an intracellular vesicle to the tip of
  the primary cilium. Activated GLI proteins then translocate to the nucleus and promote
  the transcription of target genes. To note, Hh ligand binding is regulated by cell
  surface proteins: Hh-interacting protein (HHIP) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans
  (HSPGs) compete with the Hh-binding while GAS1 (Growth arrest-specific gene), Cdo
  (Commodo) and Boc (Brother of Commodo) proteins facilitate Hh-binding to Ptch.'
