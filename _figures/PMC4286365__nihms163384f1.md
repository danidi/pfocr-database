caption: 'Biosynthetic and recycling routes in MDCK cells: the new paradigm. (A and
  B) The early paradigm. Early studies suggested the concept that biosynthetic and
  recycling routes of plasma membrane (PM) proteins were totally segregated, with
  separate sorting centers. Studies with viral envelope glycoproteins as model PM
  proteins suggested the concept that the TGN was the major sorting station in the
  biosynthetic route. Here, apical and basolateral PM proteins were sorted into different
  carrier vesicles that were then targeted to and fused with the corresponding PM
  domains (routes A and B). Only lysosomal hydrolases (route C) and some receptors
  involved in immunological defense were believed to use a direct route from TGN to
  endosomes. Recycling PM proteins (e.g. low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR),
  TfR) are internalized into separate sets of apical and basolateral sorting endosomes
  (ASE and BSE), where they are segregated from soluble proteins targeted to late
  endosomes (LE) and the degradation (deg) pathway in lysosomes (Lys). They are then
  mixed in deeper common recycling endosomes (CRE), the main sorting center in the
  recycling route, and sorted into different recycling routes to the apical and basolateral
  PM (routes AR and BR1). The apical recycling route includes an intermediate compartment
  called the apical recycling endosome (ARE), which is also an intermediate in the
  apical transcytotic (AT) route of the pIgR. A fast basolateral recycling route was
  also described from BSE (route BR2). (C) The new paradigm. Studies in the past decade
  have established the existence of a variety of routes followed by newly synthesized
  PM proteins to the different sets of apical and basolateral endosomes. Many basolateral
  proteins are transported (via route B2) to CRE (e.g. VSVG, TfR in recently polarized
  MDCK) where they are sorted to the basolateral membrane (route BR1). Other PM proteins
  (e.g. LDLR, TfR in fully polarized MDCK) may bypass this compartment presumably
  using a direct route from TGN to PM (route B1). A route from CRE to BSE (route B3?)
  remains hypothetical and has been proposed for pIgR. Apical proteins can follow
  a route that traverses ARE (e.g. endolyn; route A2) or ASE (e.g. influenza hemagglutinin
  (HA); route A3).'
