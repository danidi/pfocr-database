caption: '(A) Colour coding identifies different aspects of the glycolytic, pentose-phosphate
  shunt pathway, oxidative pathway, biosynthetic routes associated with synthesis
  of various compounds including acetylcholine and amino acid neurotransmitters, and
  redox shuttling. Note that oxidizable alternative substrates (e.g., lactate, acetate,
  amino acids or ketone bodies) cannot satisfy many important upstream functions fulfilled
  by glucose metabolism. Reproduced with permission from: Dienel GA (2011) Brain lactate
  metabolism: the discoveries and the controversies. J Cereb Blood Flow Metab, doi:10.1038/jcbfm.2011.175.
  (B) Different aspects and pathways of glucose metabolism can be measured by local
  and global methods using glucose analogues or glucose labelled in specific carbon
  atoms. Oxidative pathways are assessed with many labelled precursors and by direct
  assay of oxygen consumption. Overall pathway relationships are assessed by comparison
  of oxygen and glucose or total carbohydrate utilization. Note that metabolite concentration
  changes reflect the difference between input and output, not flux through the pool.
  (C) Brain imaging and spectroscopic studies depend on signals derived from metabolic
  activity to calculate pathway rates and redox changes. Glucose analogues (DG, FDG
  and 2-NBDG) have limited metabolism, are trapped as the hexose 6-phosphate, and
  are used to assay the hexokinase step and calculate total glucose utilization rate.
  Incorporation of label from glucose into TCA cycle-derived amino acids enables calculation
  of oxidative rates and glutamate–glutamine cycling. Respiration is assayed by PET
  or MRS by assaying incorporation of labelled oxygen into water. Fluorescence of
  endogenous redox compounds (NADH, NADPH and FAD) are used to localize and quantify
  redox changes under different conditions. Lactate can be released to maintain redox
  balance or serve as an supplementary fuel when present in high concentrations. Reprinted

  to measure glucose utilization rate requires knowledge of relative rates of transport
  and phosphorylation of the analogue and of glucose at various glucose concentrations.
  DG is transported into brain faster than glucose, whereas glucose is phosphorylated
  by hexokinase faster than DG and the capacity for glucose transport into brain exceeds
  the demand for glucose. The thickness of the arrows for transport and phosphorylation
  are scaled to represent relative values for the rate constants for uptake into brain
  from arterial plasma (K1, K1*, where the asterisk denotes the glucose analogue,
  that is, tracer [14C]DG), efflux from brain to blood (k2 and k2*), and phosphorylation
  by hexokinase (k3 and k3*). The DG/Glc transport coefficient (K1*/K1) determined
  in rat brain ranges from approximately 1.3 to 1.5 (; ; ; ; ; ). The DG/Glc phosphorylation
  coefficient (k3*/k3) determined in rat brain ranges from approximately 0.22 to 0.38
  (; ; ; ; ; ). The ratio of maximal transport (Tmax) to maximal phosphorylation rate
  (Vmax) for glucose is estimated to be approximately 3:1(; ), and the ratio of Tmax
  to CMRglc is estimated to be in the range of approximately 1.5–2.5 (or higher) in
  rat and human brain (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ), whether using the standard or reversible Michaelis–Menten
  kinetic model (). The lumped constant of the [14C]DG method takes these kinetic
  differences into account, with the net result that about two glucose molecules are
  phosphorylated for each DG phosphorylated (). This means that, with no correction
  for product loss, accumulation of metabolites of glucose should exceed DG-6-P accumulation
  by approximately 2-fold due to greater phosphorylation coefficient. Note that these
  relationships are not established for neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes or
  for 2-NBDG and 6-NBDG, the fluorescent glucose analogues, so differences among cell
  types cannot be interpreted (E) Contour map showing the steady-state brain-to-plasma
  distribution ratio of the non-metabolizable analogue 3-O-methylglucose and brain
  glucose concentration. When metabolic rate is constant and plasma glucose level
  held at different but fixed levels, the relationship between glucose level and methylglucose
  distribution ratio is illustrated by the dotted lines. The red line represents the
  normal resting rat brain for which Vmax/Tmax (ratio of maximal phosphorylation to
  maximal transport capacities) is 0.34. As plasma glucose concentration (Cp) is reduced,
  brain glucose level falls and the methylglucose distribution ratio rises, particularly
  at the lowest brain glucose levels. The continuous lines illustrate the relationships
  for varying demand at fixed plasma glucose level. When plasma glucose is fixed,
  for example, at 10 mmol/l (blue line) and metabolism is increased (i.e. Vmax/Tmax
  rises), brain glucose level and methylglucose distribution ratio both decrease (the
  blue line falls below the red line). In contrast, when metabolic rate is reduced
  (e.g., by anaesthesia), brain glucose level and methylglucose distribution ratio
  rise (blue line). Reproduced with permission from: Dienel GA, Cruz NF, Adachi K,
  Sokoloff L, Holden JE (1997), Determination of local brain glucose level with [14C]methylglucose:
  effects of glucose supply and demand, Am J Physiol., 273(5 Pt 1):E839–49. The lumped
  constant for DG is relatively stable during normoglycaemia and hypoglycaemia, but
  rises when brain glucose level falls (; ); methylglucose distribution ratio can
  be used to determine brain glucose level and the appropriate value for the lumped
  constant (). Thus, supply and demand govern the relationship between glucose and
  non-metabolizable and metabolizable glucose analogues. Measured and theoretical
  values are in good agreement for deoxyglucose and methylglucose. Similar relationships
  are anticipated for the relationships between intracellular and extracellular glucose
  levels and metabolic demand. These relationships must also be established for the
  non-metabolizable fluorescent tracer 6-NBDG. The ‘lumped constant’ must be determined
  for 2-NBDG. (F) Pyruvate production and flux through the glycolytic pathway requires
  regeneration of NAD+ from NADH by means of the MAS. This pathway also shuttles TCA
  cycle intermediates and amino acids across the mitochondrial membrane, and is essential
  for trafficking of labelled intermediates from mitochondria to the larger unlabelled
  cytoplasmic amino acid pools. Lactate production removes pyruvate as an oxidative
  substrate for that cell and reduces label mixing by replacing the MAS to regenerate
  NAD+. Lactate oxidation requires the MAS activity (see A). Reprinted from Neurochem
