caption: Accumulating evidence has indicated that PPARγ is a critical effector of
  insulin-sensitizing reactions such as GLUT4 translocation, adipokine secretion,
  and lipolysis (①). In this study, we suggest a novel mechanism underlying insulin-mediated
  PPARγ activation. XBP1s is generated and activated by the insulin-stimulated IRE1α–XBP1s
  signaling pathway (②) and the nuclear translocation of XBP1s (③). XBP1s induces
  the expression of FGF21 (④), which leads to PPARγ activation and vice versa (⑤),
  and directly inhibits lipolysis by an autocrine signaling mechanism (⑥). As a feed-forward
  amplifier, XBP1s also potentiates the insulin signaling cascade (⑦). Based on these
  effects, XBP1s strongly attenuates palmitate-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes.
