caption: CXCL12 chemokine signaling. CXCL12 acts through its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7.
  CXCR4 stimulation leads to the activation of numerous signaling pathways depending
  on the cell types while CXCR7 has mainly been shown to be involved in scavenging
  CXCL12, although it can activate a MAP kinase pathway through β-arrestin in several
  systems.
