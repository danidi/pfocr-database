caption: IL-6 contributes to a positive feedback cycle of growth and invasion between
  CAFs (myofibroblasts) and its underlying tumor (afferent pathway) and between invading
  tumor and the recruitment of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts (efferent pathway). Mast
  cells participate in this cycle through a reciprocal growth relationship with fibroblasts
