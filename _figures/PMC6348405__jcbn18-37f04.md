caption: ATF4 regulates the serine synthetic and mitochondrial Folate-mediated 1C
  metabolism pathway. Several ATF4 target genes are involved in serine synthesis,
  1C unit metabolism, purine synthesis and glutathione synthesis. The expression of
  PHGDH, PSAT1 and PSPH increases serine synthesis. Serine is incorporated into glutathione
  synthesis as well as into 1C unit metabolism. Expression of xCT, CTH and CBS increases
  glutathione synthesis. The expression of SHMT2 and MTHFD2 accelerates NADPH production,
  fMet synthesis and purine synthesis, which are important for mitochondrial redox
  homeostasis, mitochondrial translation and DNA replication, respectively. SHMT2-mediated
  tRNA methylation is important for the translation of mitochondria-encoded electrophile
  transport chain. In proliferating cells, CHO-THF and CH2-THF generated in the cytosol
  is utilized for purine and thymidine synthesis, respectively. 3PG, 3-phospho-glycerate;
  3PHP, 3-phospho-hydroxypyruvate; CBS, cystathionine-β-synthase; CH2-THF, 5,10-methylene-THF;
  CH+-THF, 5,10-methenyl-THF; CHO-THF, 10-formyl-THF; CTH, cystathionase; dTMP, thymidine
  monophosphate; dTTP, thymidine triphosphate; fMet, N-formylmethionine; MTHFD2, methylene-tetrahydrofolate
  dehydrogenase 2; PHGDH, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase; PSAT1, phosphoserine aminotransferase
  1; PSer, 3-phospho-serine; PSPH, phosphoserine phosphatase; SHMT2, mitochondrial
  serine hydroxymethyl transferase 2; THF, tetrahydrofolate.
