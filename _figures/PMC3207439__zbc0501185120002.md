caption: Glycosyltransferase complexes in the O-glycosylation pathway. Schematic representation
  of the mucin-type core O-glycan structures and the enzymes involved (for enzyme
  names, see supplemental Table S1 and the KEGG pathway database). Enzyme names are
  given along their respective reaction paths. A, FRET measurements of the homomeric
  interactions were done as described in the legend to . All of the values are represented
  as percentages of FRET+ COS7 cells (mean ± S.D. from three independent measurements).
  B, heteromeric interactions. FRET measurements were done as described in the legend
  to . Localization data of all tested O-glycosyltransferases are shown in supplemental
  Fig. S5.
