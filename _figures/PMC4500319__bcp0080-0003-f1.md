caption: Overlapping mechanisms of pesticide and ischaemia-reperfusion renal injury.
  Ischaemia-reperfusion induces multiple injury pathways in renal epithelial and endothelial
  cells as well as inflammation leading ultimately to AKI –. Novel biomarkers appear
  earlier than functional markers in response to mild injury. Nephrotoxic pesticides
  cause toxicity through a similarly diverse range of injury pathways which may overlap
  with those of the ischaemia-reperfusion injury cascade. This figure suggests speculative
  primary targets for the commonly studied pesticides, paraquat (P), glyphosate (G)
  and MCPA (M). The herbicide, MCPA, induces caspase pathway as well as increase thromboxane
  A2 activity which subsequently leads to microvascular congestion and endothelial
  injury in addition to uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation ,. ToxAKI following
  paraquat is mainly attributed to increase ROS generation and inflammation ,,, while
  glyphosate surfactant causes ATP depletion via uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation,
  cytochrome C activation and macromolecular oxidation , –. ROS, reactive oxygen species;
  NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase
