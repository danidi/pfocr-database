caption: Transcription regulatory network indicates utilization of various transcription
  factors following activation of TLR7. Protein-interaction network was generated
  for expression changes in pDC stimulated with 3M-852A and 3M-011 4 hr post-stimulation.
  The network shows genes altered in expression in the data set which were transcriptionally
  regulated via IRF7, NFkB, cJun, IRF5, IRF8 through potential interaction with the
  TLR7 pathway and through ISGF3 via activation of the type 1 interferon receptor.
  Network was generated using the Analyze network (receptor) and the direct interactions
  algorithms using the whole expression data. Major hubs have been highlighted in
  bold. Remaining details of network are as described in Methods. Legend describing
  symbols in the network is found in Additional file .
