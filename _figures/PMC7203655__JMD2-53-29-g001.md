caption: 'The GABA metabolic pathway (top) and overview of approaches toward patient
  identification and treatment (bottom). Metabolites elevated in patients with succinic
  semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency (SSADHD) include GABA, SSA (succinic
  semialdehyde), and GHB (γ‐hydroxybutyric acid); conversely, glutamine (gln) appears
  decreased. For the diagram, green indicates procedures or measures either achieved
  (solid line) or partially achieved/in progress (broken line). A tier 1 (tier 2 =
  confirmation of initial screen) bloodspot assay that is amenable to current NBS
  platforms is currently required (red). Additional abbreviations: GLNase, glutaminase;
  GAD, glutamic acid decarboxylase; GABA‐T, GABA‐transaminase (also referred to as
  ABAT, or aminobutyrate aminotransferase); SSADH, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase;
  AKR7a2, aldo‐keto reductase 7a2. VGB (vigabatrin; γ‐vinylGABA; Sabril) represents
  an irreversible inhibitor of GABA‐T'
