caption: Scheme of the sandwich assay for electronic detection of nucleic acids. The
  gold electrode was coated with a SAM including (1) DNA-alkanethiols that contain
  the capture probe sequence; (2) molecular wires, which provide a pathway for electron
  transfer between the Fc and the gold in response to potential changes at the electrode;
  and (3) alkanethiols terminated in polyethylene glycol insulator, which serve as
  insulators to block access of redox species in solution to the electrode, including
  free signaling probes. A target nucleic acid is shown annealed to a capture probe
  and a Fc-labeled signaling probe []. Copyright Reproduced with permission from American
