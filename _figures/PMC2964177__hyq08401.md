caption: ErbB2 cellular signaling pathways and lapatinib mechanism of action. ErbB2
  (HER2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase activated by dimerization with itself
  or other ErbB proteins (i.e. ErbB1, ErbB3). Binding of ErbB1 ligands to ErbB1 stimulates
  heterodimerization with ErbB2 and activation of downstream signaling pathways, including
  PI3K, Akt protein kinase and mTOR, resulting in an increase in cell proliferation.
  The PTEN protein has tumor suppressor activity in this signaling pathway and loss
  of PTEN, as well as upregulation of IGF-1R signaling, is associated with trastuzumab
  resistance. Lapatinib blocks the activation of the ErbB2 signaling pathway by inhibiting
  the intracellular tyrosine kinase of ErbB1 and ErbB2 and may circumvent trastuzumab
  resistance associated with upregulation of IGF-1R signaling. Lapatinib also binds
  to the p95 truncated variant of ErbB2 (p95 ErbB2) and inhibits cell proliferation
  in trastuzumab-resistant cells expressing p95 ErbB2. ErbB1, human epidermal growth
  factor receptor 1 (EGFR); ErbB2, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ErbB2);
