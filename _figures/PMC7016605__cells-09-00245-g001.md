caption: 'Model for the role of the RhoA-ROCK pathway in the pathogenesis of TBI.
  The small GTPase RhoA is activated by RhoA-GEFs in response to various extracellular
  signals triggered by injury. Active GTP-bound RhoA binds to and stimulates the activity
  of the serine/threonine kinase ROCK1/2. Through phosphorylation of downstream effectors
  such as PTEN, LIMK, MLC, and CRMP-2, ROCK initiates signaling cascades that induce
  cytoskeletal remodeling underlying dendrite/axon retraction and synapse/spine loss
  as well as cell death, which together contribute to functional deficits. Inhibition
  of ROCK (e.g., Fasudil, Y-27632) or RhoA rescues these TBI-induced deficits. ROCK:
  Rho Kinase, GEF: guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GAP: GTPase-activating protein,
  GDI: Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog,
  LIMK: LIM kinase, MLC: myosin light chain, CRMP2: collapsin response mediator protein
  2, MAG: myelin-associated glycoprotein, OMgp: oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein,
  NgR: nogo receptor, PTPσ: protein tyrosine phosphate σ, NgR1/3: nogo receptor 1
  and 3, LAR: leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase, CSPG: chondroitin sulfate
  proteoglycans.'
