caption: SMARCD1 nearest-neighbor adjacency subnetwork with the glucocorticoid receptor
  response pathway. The orange arrow originating from cortisol to SMARCD1 indicates
  that cortisol is a controller of SMARCD1. The blue directed edge from SMARCD1 to
  SGK1 (glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1) demonstrates the known relationship between
  SMARCD1 expression and increased expression of SGK1. The gray dotted lines indicate
  that SMARCD1 co-complexes with the connected node proteins, including Nuclear Receptor
  Subfamily 3 Group C Member 1 (NR3C1), a glucocorticoid receptor
