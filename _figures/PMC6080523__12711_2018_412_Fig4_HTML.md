caption: Graphic scheme of pathways shared by genes found in network analysis for
  progressive motility. Only part of the cyclooxygenase pathway is presented. Cytosolic
  phospholipase A2 group IVA (PLA2G4A) is involved in cleaving arachidonic acid from
  phospholipids, preferentially (I). Then, the free arachidonic acid is metabolized
  to produce eicosanoids (including prostaglandins) in the process known as cyclooxygenase
  pathway (II–V). The genes prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2/COX-2, number
  II) and hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase (HPGDS, number III) are involved
  in this pathway. The COX-2 enzymes catalyze prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) synthesis from
  arachidonic acid (II), providing PGH2 for the action of HPGDS (III) and production
  of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in testes interstitial mast cells. PGH2 can also be converted
  into prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, number IV) and prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α, number V)
