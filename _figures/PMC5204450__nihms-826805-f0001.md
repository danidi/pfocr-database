caption: The regulated release of intracellular content into the external milieu can
  be regulated by activation of PI3K and its downstream effectors. Internalization
  of foreign materials through the process of endocytosis constitutes an important
  mechanism that allows the cell to maintain key functions. PI3K signaling has been
  heavily implicated in the regulation of both clathrin-dependent and -independent
  modes of endocytotic internalization. PI3K also participates in regulation of caveolae-mediated
  trafficking events and in spontaneous membrane ruffling to induce phagocytosis.
  The dependence of various endo- and exocytic processes on the PI3-kinase pathway
  demonstrates its importance as a critical regulator of key physiological processes.
