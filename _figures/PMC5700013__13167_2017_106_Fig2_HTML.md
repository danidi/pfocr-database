caption: PCSK9 in neuronal apoptosis. Figure is based on []. In the brain, hypercholesterolemia
  causes the emergence of reactive forms of oxLDL which stimulate PSCK9 synthesis.
  Under the influence of PCSK9 an NF-κB is activated through the activation of proapoptotic
  Bax proteins and caspases 3 and 9. This pathway leads to neuronal apoptosis. BBB
  brain blood barrier, NF-κB nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated
  B cells
