caption: DEGs in the ear leaf (drought/normal) at the 5DAP stage involved in the plant
  hormone signaling pathway summary of the maize plant response drought stress. DEGs
  in the ear leaf (drought/normal) at the 5DAP stage involved in the ABA (a), auxin
  (b), cytokine (c) and ethylene (d) signaling pathway. e Summary of the whole plant
  response and organ-specific response process and their correlation to the final
  yield of maize under drought conditions. All the plants were grown and treated as
  described in Fig. . The ear leaf from drought stress and control plants was collected
  for RNA sequencing. The absolute values of log2 (drought/control) ≥1 and FDR < 0.001
  were used as the criteria for DEGs. The color of the box represents up (red) and
  down (green)-regulated (drought/normal) genes, and the value in the box is the log2
  (drought/normal) of the genes in the ear leaf (drought/normal) at the 5DAP stage
