caption: 'Since the discovery of leptin, understanding of the mechanisms that control
  energy balance has rapidly advanced. Unfortunately, except for leptin replacement
  therapy in a handful of leptin deficient individuals, there is yet to emerge any
  interventions that effectively prevent or treat obesity in the general population.
  Both insulin and leptin are secreted in proportion to body fatness and serve as
  adiposity signals, acting on the same neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus
  to regulate energy homeostasis. Ghrelin, which is secreted by the stomach and duodenum,
  serves as a hunger signal at the hypothalamus and brainstem, while other peptides
  secreted by the GI tract, including PYY, act as satiation signals. The ligands leptin,
  POMC, , CART, and BDNF,, the receptors for leptin, , melanocortins,– and BDNF, and
  the enzyme PC1, have been found to have function-altering mutations associated with
  obesity in children. Mutations in the ligands and receptors for NPY, AGRP, CPE,,
  and MCH have been found to alter energy balance in rodents, but have not been as
  convincingly shown to be associated with human obesity. Lines with arrowheads indicate
  stimulatory action. Lines ending with a perpendicular end-block indicate inhibitory
  action. Abbreviations: GI, gastrointestinal; PYY, peptide YY, IR, insulin receptor;
  LR, leptin receptor, NPY, neuropeptide Y; AGRP, agouti-related protein; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin;
  CART, cocaine-amphetamine related transcript; PC1, prohormone convertase 1; CPE,
  carboxypeptidase E; MSH, melanocyte stimulating hormone; TRH, thyrotropin-releasing
  hormone; MCH, melanin concentrating hormone; GABA, gamma amino butyric acid; BDNF,
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor; TrkB, tyrosine kinase receptor B.'
