caption: Ack1 signaling pathway in normal and cancerous cells. Ack1 is rapidly activated
  in normal and cancerous cells following RTK activation. In tumors, Ack1 gene amplification
  and autoactivating somatic mutations, E346K, can also lead to its activation. Ack1
  phosphorylates AKT, at Tyr176 which facilitates AKT kinase activation and transcriptional
  suppression of FoxO-target genes, involved in cell cycle arrest, cell death, and
  DNA repair. Ack1-mediated AR activation is shown in the middle. Activated Ack1 phosphorylates
  AR at Tyr267 and Tyr363. Tyrosine phosphorylated AR translocates to the nucleus
  and transcribes AR-regulated genes in the absence of androgen. Regulation of the
  tumor suppressor, Wwox is shown to left. Activated Ack1 phosphorylates Wwox at Tyr287;
  Tyr287-phosphorylated Wwox is polyubiquitinated and degraded. Combined effect of
  Ack1 activation is cell survival and neoplasia, as seen in Ack1 transgenic mouse.
