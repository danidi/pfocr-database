caption: Schematic of a proposed biosynthetic pathway for the hydroxylacetophenones
  piceol and pungenol and their respective glucosides picein and pugenin.The proposed
  biosynthesis of piceol and pungenol involves, respectively, coumaroyl-CoA or caffeolyl
  CoA as precursors (1) (Negrel and Javelle, ). This is followed by glucosylation
  (2) to produce the glucosides picein and pungenin which are found in resistant and
  non-resistant trees. Deglucosylation by PgβGLU-1 releases the aglycons in resistant
  trees. The schematic does not account for different compartments, membranes or different
  cell types potentially involved in the formation, transport and accumulation of
  the glucosides and release of aglycons.
