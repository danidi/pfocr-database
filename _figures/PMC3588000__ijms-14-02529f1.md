caption: Biosynthesis of Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). CDP ethanolamine-Kennedy pathway
  is the only route for de novo synthesis of PE. Phosphorylation of ethanolamine by
  ethanolamine kinase (EK) to produce phosphoethanolamine (P-Etn) is followed by the
  Pcyt2-mediated production of CDP-ethanolamine. The final reaction in this pathway
  is executed by CDP-ethanolamine:1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase
  (EPT) to produce PE. The analogous enzymes of the CDP-choline brunch of the Kennedy
  pathway include, choline kinase (CK), CTP:choline cytidylyltransferase(Pcyt1) and
  CDP-choline:1,2-diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase (CPT). In the liver PE
  could be transformed into PC by the action of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase
  (PEMT). PE can also be produced in mitochondria by decarboxylation of PS by PSD.
  Mammals do not synthesize PS de novo; PS is produced by the head-group exchange
  from PE (PS synthase-2, PSS2) or PC (PS synthase-1, PSS1). In addition, PE could
  be made by fatty acid (FA) esterification of lyso-PE by lyso-PE acyltransferase
  (LPEAT).
