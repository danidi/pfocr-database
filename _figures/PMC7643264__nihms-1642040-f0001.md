caption: In response to ER stress, ATF6 is reduced to a monomer and traffics from
  the ER to the Golgi compartment, where it is cleaved by site 1 protease (S1P) and
  site 2 protease (S2P) to release the cytosolic fragment of ATF6. Cleaved ATF6 contains
  a basic leucine zipper (bZip) domain essential for the upregulation of its target
  genes in the nucleus
