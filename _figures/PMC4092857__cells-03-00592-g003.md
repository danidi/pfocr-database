caption: The activation of the DNA damage response upon CDT exposure. This picture
  depicts the DDR molecular events induced after CDT intoxication. The dotted lines
  represent well-studied events occurring during the DDR, but not yet demonstrated
  in the context of CDT exposure. CdtB-induced DNA lesions are detected by sensors,
  such as the MRN complex and RPA, resulting in the recruitment and the activation
  of the PI3K related kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM and ATR then phosphorylate hundreds
  of substrates, including H2AX, CHK1, CHK2 and p53 (black arrows). This signaling
  cascade results in the regulation of cell cycle modulators (blue lines), through
  the inhibition of CDC25C phosphatase by CHK2 and, possibly, CHK1. Phosphorylated
  CDC25C is unable to activate the cyclin B/CDK1 complex (red crosses), essential
  for mitotic entry. Moreover, the p53-dependent accumulation of p21 blocks cells
  in G1 by inhibiting the CDK2/cyclin E complex. At the same time, the DSB repair
  mechanisms (NHEJ and HR) are activated by ATM and ATR (red arrows). However, if
  the level of DNA lesions is too severe, the process of cell death is initiated (green
  arrows). Apoptotic cell death can be induced by an intrinsic pathway involving p53
  activation, leading to an increase in the BAX level, the sequestration and inactivation
  of Bcl-2, the mitochondrial release of cytochrome C and caspase 9 activation. Apoptosis
  can also be induced through the activation of the extrinsic pathway, involving caspase
  8 activation. In both cases, this leads to caspase 3 activation and apoptotic cell
  death.
