caption: Hypothetic mechanisms of cancer therapy-induced HSC senescence and LT-BM
  injury and potential strategies for therapeutic intervention. IR and chemotherapy
  may increase the production of ROS by NOXs and/or mitochondria via activation of
  the mTOR-HIF1 pathway in HSCs. ROS can induce HSC senescence by stimulating the
  p38 pathway and/or activating the p53-p21 pathway via induction of DSBs. Both pathways
  could converge at p16/Arf for the induction of HSC senescence. Therefore, mTOR and
  NOX inhibitors and selective antioxidants may have the potential to prevent and
  mitigate cancer therapy-induced HSC senescence and LT-BM injury. HSC, hematopoietic
  stem cell; LT-BM injury, long-term bone marrow injury; IR, ionizing radiation; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; NOXs, NADPH oxidases; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  HIF1, hypoxic-inducible factor-1; DSBs, DNA double strand breaks.
