caption: 'TANC protein interaction network. TANC interaction partners identified by
  low throughput data (solid lines), PPI database evidence (thinner lines) or linear
  motifs prediction. Interactions that are proved only in one paralog, but mediated
  by binding sites (linear motif or structural domain) that are identical in both
  proteins, are reported as dotted edges. TANC1 interactors only are colored in light
  blue; TANC2 interactors only in red: while TANC interactors both are in violet.
  Interactors are represented with different shapes based on specific molecular function:
  scaffold proteins (rectangles), protein kinases (rhombus); cytoskeleton proteins
  (hexagons). TANC proteins are connected with different neuronal regulative proteins,
  belonging to Planar Cell Polarity signalling (teal outline), Hippo pathway (dark
  red outline) and glutamate signalling (orange outline).'
