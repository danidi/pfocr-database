caption: A partial sphingolipid metabolic pathway with structures of selected species
  and numerically designated enzymatic reactions. The methylene subscript -(CH2)x-
  of long-chain sphingoid bases is often 13 yielding a 1, 3-dihydroxy, 18 carbon linear
  alkyl chain containing no sites of unsaturation (d18:0), but can range from 9 (d14:0)
  to greater than 17 (d22:0). The methylene subscript -(CH2)y- of the fatty acid acyl
  chain typically ranges from 11 (16 carbons total) to greater than 25 (30 carbons
  total). Enzymes of sphingolipid biosynthesis and degradation (blue and red, respectively)
  correspond to serine palmitoyltransferase – 1, 3-ketosphinganine reductase – 2,
  dihydroceramide synthases – 3, dihydroceramide desaturases – 4, sphingomyelin synthase
  – 5, glucosylceramide synthase - 6, ceramide kinase – 7, galactosylceramide transferase
  – 8, sialotransferase – 9, sialidase – 10, galactosidase – 11, sphingomyelinases
  (C-type) – 12, ceramidases – 13, β-glucoceramidase – 14, ceramide-1-phosphate phosphatase
  (putative) – 15, sphingosine/sphinganine kinases – 16, sphingosine/sphinganine-1-phosphate
  phosphatase – 17, sphinganine/sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase – 18, and dihydroceramide-4-hydroxylase
  – 19.
