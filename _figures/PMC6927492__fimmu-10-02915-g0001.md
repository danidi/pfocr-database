caption: Metabolism drives immune cell function. Glucose is metabolized by glycolysis,
  which is essential for activated NK cells, T cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs),
  M1 macrophages and granulocytes. Pyruvate can be converted to lactate and secreted
  from the cell or else it can be converted to acetyl CoA which feeds into the TCA
  cycle. The TCA cycle results in the production of reducing equivalents (NADH, FADH)
  which feed into the electron transport chain. The electron transport chain uses
  the electrons supplied by NADH and FADH to pump protons across the inner membrane.
  This force is then used to drive ATP synthase which makes ATP. Oxphos is important
  for immune cells when they are at rest, and it is also essential for activated NK
  cells, T cells, M2 macrophages and B cells. Acetyl CoA can alternatively be supplied
  by fatty acids—this form of metabolism is important for memory cells, regulatory
  cells and M2 macrophages. Glutamine can feed into the TCA cycle via glutaminolysis—this
  pathway is used by T cells and to a lesser extent, NK cells.
