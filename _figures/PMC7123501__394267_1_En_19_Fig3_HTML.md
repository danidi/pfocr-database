caption: 'Simplified scenario model illustrating the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
  pathways. Apoptosis can be instigated by two major cellular signalling pathways:
  an intrinsic pathway that is initiated inside cells by mitochondrial release of
  pro-apoptotic factors or an extrinsic pathway that is initiated at the cell surface
  by death receptors that are members of the TNF receptor gene family. The intrinsic
  pathway is controlled by members of the Bcl-2 protein family such as the BH3-only
  proteins which, when activated, stimulate pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK that form pores
  in the mitochondrial outer membrane to provide release of cytochrome C. Following,
  cytochrome C associates with Apaf1 to form an apoptosome that drives activation
  of caspase-9, which then stimulates caspase-3 and caspase-7. The extrinsic apoptotic
  pathway can be divided into two paths according to two groups of death receptors.
  The first group (Fas, TRAILR, DR4, DR5) recruits DISC followed a series of events,
  that is, caspase-8-mediated activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7. The second group
  (TNFR1, DR3, DR6) recruits the adaptor protein TRADD that links death receptor to
  TRAF2, RIPK1, cIAPs, and LUBAC, forming the signalling complex I. Further forms
  complexes IIa and IIb lead to activation of the caspase cascade that results in
  apoptosis. Apaf-1 apoptotic protease-activating factor-1, BH BCL-2 homology, CASP
