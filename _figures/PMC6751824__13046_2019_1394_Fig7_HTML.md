caption: The schematic diagram depicts the regulatory mechanism of HOTTIP in the immune
  escape of OC cells. In OC cells, high expression of HOTTIP can enhance the expression
  and secretion of IL-6 from OC cells by promoting the transcription of IL-6. The
  secreted IL-6 stimulates the expression of PD-L1 by binding to the IL-6 receptor
  on the surface of neutrophils around the cancer cells and then activates the STAT3
  pathway, thus increasing the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of neutrophils and
  inhibiting the activity of T cells, which further promotes apoptosis, thus facilitating
  the immune escape of OC cells
