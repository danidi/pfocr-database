caption: Possible neurochemical/molecular pathways for stress-induced synaptic remodeling
  in medial prefrontal cortex. Above. In an unstressed animal, increases in postsynaptic
  glutamatergic signaling (1) are associated with BDNF release (2); BDNF’s activity
  at its TrkB receptor (3) results in increased synaptogenesis via an mTOR-dependent
  pathway (4). Below. During chronic stress, increased glucocorticoid signaling (1)
  results in loss of functional NMDA and AMPA receptors (2), which decreases postsynaptic
  glutamatergic signaling (3). Concurrent reductions in BDNF release (4) in medial
  prefrontal cortex decreases TrkB signaling (5), resulting in decreased synaptogenesis
  (6).
