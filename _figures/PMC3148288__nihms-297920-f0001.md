caption: ERM proteins are scaffolds for cAMP signaling pathways. A) A generic model
  of how ERMs act as A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). cAMP is produced following
  activation of GPCRs (in yellow, 7-pass transmembrane receptors), which in turn activate
  Adenylyl Cyclase (AC) to convert ATP to cAMP (yellow triangles). cAMP activates
  PKA, a heterotetramer, by binding to the regulatory (R) subunits, releasing the
  catalytic (C) subunits to phosphorylate nearby effector proteins. All three ERM
  proteins function as AKAPs, binding to the PKA regulatory subunits through their
  central alpha helical domain. ERM activation requires PIP2 binding (red circles)
  and phosphorylation of a conserved residue within the FERM or F-actin binding domain
  (blue crescent). EBP50 (light blue), a scaffolding protein containing two PDZ domains
  and a FERM binding domain, binds to ERMs via a C-terminal domain and can interact
  with the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) through its first PDZ domain []. B)
  At the immunological synapse Ezrin mediates T cell repression by functioning as
  an AKAP. Cbp, a transmembrane adaptor protein, binds to both EBP50 and Csk, a Src
  kinase. Ezrin can bind to EBP50 and scaffold PKA to Csk. Activated PKA phosphorylates
  Csk, which in turn phosphorylates Lck, a kinase and downstream component of T cell
  activation, at a residue that renders Lck inactive. This model was adapted from
  []. C) Radixin mediates TSH mediated proliferation by scaffolding the cAMP effectors
  PKA and Epac1 to their effector Rap1, a small GTPase. Epac1, a GEF for Rap1, is
  activated by binding of cAMP which releases Epac1 auto inhibition and activate Rap1
  by catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP. Rap1 when activated localizes to the
  membrane. Activated PKA phosphorylates a residue that is crucial for Rap1’s ability
  to mediated TSH proliferation. Although schematized here, EBP50 has not been shown
  to function in this pathway. D) Ezrin’s scaffolding function is required for gastric
  acid secretion. In parietal cells Ezrin is phosphorylated within the FERM domain
  by PKA, which is activated in part through activated histamine receptors. Phosphorylated
  Ezrin is a scaffold for ACAP4, an ARF6 GAP. ARF6 regulates membrane trafficking
  and requires the ability to cycle between active (GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound)
  states for its function. Ezrin, ACAP4 and cycling ARF6 are all necessary for proper
  localization of the H+,K+-ATPase for gastric acid secretion. Although indicated
  here, EBP50 has not been shown to function in this pathway, nor has Ezrin been shown
  to scaffold PKA in parietal cells.
