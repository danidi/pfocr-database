caption: Viral miR-mediated evasion of adaptive immune responses. Antigens are presented
  by two major pathways, MHC class I and MHC class II. In MHC class I pathway, endogenous
  viral antigens are degraded via proteasome machinery, translocated to endoplasmic
  reticulum through TAP proteins and are processed by proteases like ERAP. Processed
  peptides are assembled with MHC-I complex to be presented predominantly to CD8+
  T cells. MHC class II pathway involves exogenous antigen internalization by several
  pathways, including phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, and endocytosis. Antigens are
  trafficked to a mature or late endosomal compartment where they are processed and
  loaded onto MHC-II molecules that present antigens to CD4+ T cells. Numerous viral
  miR are known to impair both MHC class I and II pathways by targeting one or more
  components of the same pathways. In addition, some critical genes (eg, MICB) are
  targeted by multiple herpesvirus miR indicating selective evolution of miR sequences
  that can interfere with antigen processing and presentation pathway. Inhibition
  by viral miR is shown as blocked line highlighted in red. By virtue of their direct
  interaction with host and viral transcripts, v-miRs can impair components of MHC
  class I (antigenic peptide transporter TAP, and protease ERAP1) and class II (cathepsin
  B); inhibit release of proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines; protect infected
  cell from CD4+/CD8+ T cell response and NK cell-mediated cytolysis; reduce highly
  antigenic viral antigens (LMP1/ LMP2A)
