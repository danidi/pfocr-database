caption: Glucose (Glc) uptaken by cells is mainly used in glycogen synthesis and glycolysis
  pathways. 2~5% of glucose fluxes into hexosamine pathway through the conversion
  of fructose-6-phosphate (Fru-6P) to glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6P) by a rate-limiting
  enzyme glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT). Subsequent acetylation
  and uridylation of GlcN-6P produce UDP-GlcNAc as a substrate for protein glycosylation.
  O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyze the addition and removal
  of O-GlcNAc on proteins, respectively.
