caption: 'Complement system and therapeutic targets in bacterial meningitis. The complement
  system is activated via multiple pathways: the classical pathway, the lectin pathway,
  and the alternative pathway. The classical pathway starts with binding of C1q to
  immune complexes such as non-specific IgM that binds to the pneumococcal C polysaccharide.
  The lectin pathway is activated through direct binding of collectins, such as mannose-binding
  lectin (MBL) and ficolins, to sugars on the bacterial surface. This results in the
  binding with the corresponding serine proteases [C1r and C1s, and MBL-associated
  serine proteases (MASP), respectively], to form complexes that facilitate cleavage
  of C2 and C4. This forms C3-convertase (C4bC2b), which catalyses the conversion
  of C3 to C3a and C3b. The alternative pathway is activated when C3b, either produced
  due to spontaneous hydrolysis or initiating pathway activation, binds to a microbe.
  This allows C3b to bind with factor B. Subsequently, factor B is cleaved into Ba
  and Bb by factor D. Bb remains bound to C3 and forms a complex (C3bBb). The serum
  protein properdin binds this complex to make it more stable. C3bBb(P) acts as another
  C3-convertase further promoting C3 conversion, thus amplifying complement system
  activation. There are several natural inhibitors of the alternative pathway including
  complement receptor 1, factor H and complement protease complement factor I. C3b
  is an opsonin that facilitates phagocytosis. When C3b binds with the C4b2b complex
  or to a C3bBb complex, it forms C5 convertase (C4b2b3b and C3bBb3b respectively).
  Because of the catalysing activity of C5 convertase, C5 is cleaved to C5a and C5b.
  C5b is the first complement component of the MAC complex. Simplified, C5b consecutively
  binds C6, C7, C8, which induced the binding and subsequent polymerization of 10
  to 16 C9 molecules, creating the pore-forming structure known as the MAC. The pores
  formed by the MAC complex enable molecules to diffuse freely in and out of the cell.
  If enough pores form, the cell will no longer be viable. C3a and C5a are anaphylatoxins
  that are produced during complement system activation both in order of production
  (from early to late) as in order of potency (from weak to active). Anaphylatoxins
  upregulate the inflammatory response by binding to its specific receptor C5aR, which
  are mainly expressed by immune cells, and result in increased blood–CSF barrier
  permeability and the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes in the CSF. Various
  complement therapeutics are available targeting C1s [TNNNT009 (True North), C1q
  (ANX005 (Annexon)], MASP-2 and 3 [OMS-721 and OMS906, respectively (Omeros)], C2
