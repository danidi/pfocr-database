caption: Functional selectivity of the adenosine A3 receptor. Ligands with a bias
  towards β-arrestin-mediated signaling versus a Gαi-dependent pathway have been identified.
  Ligands that are antagonists for Gαi-mediated cAMP inhibition such as DMPA, CCPA,
  MRS1760, and MRS542 act as partial agonists for β-arrestin translocation. Interestingly,
  amongst the compounds that act as full agonists for both pathways, i.e., NECA, MRS3558,
  IB-MECA, Cl-IB-MECA, CGS21680, and CPA, both the nonspecific agonist NECA and the
  A3R-specific agonist MRS3558 show faster β-arestin translocation rates. DBXRM, a
  full agonist for the Gαipathway, was a partial agonist for β-arrestin signaling.
  Besides these evident examples of functional selectivity, there are conflicting
  reports of the effects A3R ligands have on apoptosis and proliferation. Since in
  many of these studies very high ligand concentrations were used, care must be taken
  when drawing conclusions about biased effects on cell growth. See references in
  the text for more detailed information
