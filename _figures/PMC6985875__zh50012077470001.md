caption: 'Schematic of mitochondrial function and localization in various lung epithelial
  cells during homeostasis. A: within the mitochondria, the double membrane with a
  folded inner membrane (IMM) forms cristae. The mitochondrial matrix contains circular
  mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which provides the
  ATP required for cellular functions, occurs in this hyper-folded IMM. During OXPHOS,
  a proton gradient is established over the IMM through the flow of electrons through
  chains of enzymatic complexes (I–V), which leads to the production of reactive oxygen
  species (ROS), H2O, and as ATP. Cytochrome c and coenzyme Q facilitate the transfer
  of electrons during OXPHOS. Complexes I and III are the major sites of ROS production
  in the electron transport chain (ETC). Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core II
  (UQCRC2) is a damage-sensitive protein that contributes to ROS generation in the
  complex III of ETC. Oxidation of cardiolipin (CL), the mitochondrial-specific lipid
  in the IMM, can induce oxidative damage. B: in the upper respiratory tract, the
  airway epithelium constitutes the first physical defensive barrier against inhaled
  pathogens and toxic gases and particles, whereas the type I and type II alveolar
  epithelial cells (AEC) that cover the alveolar surface facilitate gas exchange.
  C: the mitochondrial network is highly dynamic in lung epithelial cells. Various
  processes contribute to generation and degradation of mitochondria in the cells.
  These processes include fusion, fission, mitochondrial-specific autophagy (mitophagy),
  and mitochondrial biogenesis. During fission, recognition of activated dynamin-related
  protein 1 (DRP1) by surface receptors (FIS1, MFF, MID49, and MID51) leads to fragmentation
  of the mitochondrial outer membrane (OMM) and formation of new mitochondria. Mitochondria
  can form an elongated shape by fusion, in which mitochondrial membranes tether through
  fusion proteins in the IMM such as optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) and outer membranes mitofusin
  1 (MFN1) and MFN2. Mitophagy is regulated by several proteins, including PTEN-induced
  kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin. In homeostatic conditions, translocation of PINK1 to
  the IMM triggers recruitment of E3 ligase Parkin, which leads to proteasomal degradation
  of PINK1. Upon mild stress mitochondria can undergo complete degradation by mitophagy,
  in which accumulation of PINK-1 in the OMM and subsequent ubiquitination of several
  proteins at the OMM by Parkin lead to engulfment of the damaged mitochondrion by
  autophagy compartments. Autophagy proteins LCB3, p62, ATG5/16, and beclin 1 facilitate
  the generation of phagophore and autophagosomes. Formation of new mitochondria can
  be triggered by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator1α
  (PGC-1α) and downstream transcription factors, nuclear respiratory factors 1 and
  2 (NRF1/2), and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM). Activation of several
  proteins, including AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK), and protein kinase C (PKC), may activate the PGC-1α signaling pathway
  and in turn lead to synthesis of mitochondria.'
