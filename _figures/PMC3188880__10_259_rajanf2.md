caption: Stat3 interactions in glioma biology. There is evidence for a role for Stat3
  in tumor cells, immune cells and endothelial cells within gliomas. Stat3 mediated
  proliferative/survival signals downstream of LIF or IL-6. It also possibly mediates
  differentiation downstream of BMP/mTOR activation. Several genetic and epigenetic
  mutations/interactions which impact the Stat3 pathway have been documented, including
  mutations in the EGFR, hypermethylation of SOCS and BMPR promoters and misregulation
  of several miRNAs including miR326 which affects notch signals. Stat3 also appears
  to be an important regulator of mesenchymal transformation events. These interactions
  are impacted by levels of ERK and notch signals present within the cells. Inflammation
  results in the activation of several pathways which impinge directly on levels of
  activated Stat3. These include upregulation of notch signaling and recruitment of
  OSM and IFNγ mediated signals. Stat3 plays an important role in the immunotolerance
  of the tumor by the host. It also is involved in the production of angiogenic factors
  in the tumor microenvironment, and in the mediation of VEGF signaling in endothelial
  cells within the tumor.
