caption: 'Neurosteroid synthesis in the retina. The drawing report of the metabolic
  pathway leading to estradiol synthesis within the retina (, ). The steroidogenic
  enzymes already identified for their mRNA, activity or immunolocalization are indicated
  within yellow boxes. The enzymes still lacking of identification are indicated within
  the grey boxes. Dotted lines indicate so far unclear enzymatic activities. Abbreviations:

  dehydrogenases 4; 17β-HSD5, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases 5; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone;
