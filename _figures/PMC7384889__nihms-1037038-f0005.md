caption: Wingless-type MMTV integration site family 1 (WNT1) regulates bone formation
  in several ways. In the canonical pathway, WNT1 binding to a membrane dual receptor
  complex LRP5/6-Frizzle favors β-catenin release from a degradation complex and its
  migration to the nucleus where it regulates the expression of genes involved in
  osteoblasts differentiation and activity [].Recently, a WNT1 stimulatory effect
  on bone formation, independent from LRP5 and mediated by WNT1 regulation on the
  mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) receptor, has been hypothesized (gray shade).
  The WNT1/mTORC1 complex activates protein synthesis through the phosphorylation
  of the ribosomal protein S6. Question mark refer to the presence of still unknown
  factors in the pathway.Following bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) association with
  the BMP receptor (BMPR) on osteoblast membrane, FAM46A binds to the receptor regulated
  SMAD (R-SMAD), stabilizing it and avoiding its degradation. Then, FAM46A, R-SMAD,
  and Co-SMAD form a complex that migrates to the nucleus and regulates gene expression
  activating, among others, the transcription of the BMP target genes [].
