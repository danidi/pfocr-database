caption: 'Metabolic construction of the putative pathway for AOM coupled to Fe(III)
  reduction in “M. ferrireducens“. Electrons from methane are generated through the
  “reverse methanogenesis” pathway and transferred to the menaquinone pool (MK/MKH2)
  via the Fpo and Hdr complexes, which oxidise F420H2 and CoM-SH+CoB-SH, respectively.
  CoM-SH and CoB-SH can be oxidised by the HdrDE complex [] or the cytoplasmic HdrABC–FrhB
  complex that also reoxidise ferredoxin and reduce two F420 []. Reducing equivalents
  are transferred via the menaquinone:cytochrome c oxidoreductases to MHCs located
  outside the cytoplasm to reduce the Fe(III) oxides. Abbreviations for enzymes and
  co-factors: H4MPT, tetrahydromethanopterin; MFR, methanofuran; Fwd, formyl-methanofuran
  dehydrogenase; Ftr, formylmethanofuran/H4MPT formyltransferase; Mch, methenyl-H4MPT
  cyclohydrolase; Mtd, F420-dependent methylene H4MPT dehydrogenase; Mer, F420-dependent
  methylene-H4MPT reductase; Mtr, Na+-translocating methyl-H4MPT:coenzyme M methyltransferase;
  Mcr, methyl-coenzyme M reductase; Fpo, F420H2 dehydrogenase; MK, menaquinone; CoB-SH,
  coenzyme B; CoM-SH, coenzyme M; Fd, ferredoxin; Hdr, heterodisulfide reductase;
  FrhB, F420-reducing hydrogenase subunit B; Cytb, b-type cytochrome; NrfD, polysulfide
  reductase subunit D; FeS, ferredoxin iron sulfur protein. The MHCs are denoted in
  as blue and the number of hemes are indicated as red diamonds. Normalised gene expression
  is indicated as TPM. More information on the metabolism in ANME archaea can be found
  in the previous reviews [, ]'
