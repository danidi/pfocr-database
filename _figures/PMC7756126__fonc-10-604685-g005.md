caption: 'Usage of lymphoma B-cell receptor (BCR) antigens for targeting lymphoma.
  (A) Forward targeting: Classical antibody therapy cannot differentiate between malignant
  and benign B cells. mAbs against B cell surface antigens such as CD20 bind to their
  target present on all B cells and activate complement, antibody-dependent cell-mediated
  cytotoxicity or direct cell death. The same is also true for antibodies against
  receptors with immunomodulatory functions. Independently of this, tumor cell death
  could also be induced antibody-independently by drugs that interfere with critical
  signaling pathways (such as ibrutinib, which interferes with BTK, a step in the
  BCR signaling pathway). Ag, antigen. (B) Reverse targeting: The BAR (BCR antigen
  for reverse targeting) concept is based on the highly specific interaction of a
  BCR found exclusively on malignant B cells with its highly specific target antigen;
  benign B cells do not possess this BCR. Synthetic conjugates of BCR antigen with
  a toxin (BAR toxin) bind exclusively to the malignant cells, are internalized and
  release the toxin that kills the cell. (C) CARs: Conventional CAR with CD19 scFv/CD28
  4-1BB CD3ζ CAR backbone (left); the anti CD19 scFv was exchanged by the frequent
  BCR antigen of MCL resulting in the construct SAMD14/neurabin-I/CD28 4-1BB CD3ζ
  CAR backbone (middle) or combined with anti CD19 scFv (right).'
