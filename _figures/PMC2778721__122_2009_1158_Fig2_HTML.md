caption: 'Schematic diagram of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway, adapted from
  Holton and Cornish (). Condensation of one molecule of p-coumaroyl CoA with three
  molecules of malonyl CoA is catalyzed by chalcone synthase. The chalcone is then
  processed along the pathway in a series of enzymatic reactions to form three basic
  types of anthocyanins—pelargonidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, and delphinidin-3-glucoside—after
  which varying additional modifications ultimately give rise to red, pink, and purple
  anthocyanin pigments, respectively. Some of the genes encoding pathway enzymes are:
  chs (chalcone synthase), chi (chalcone isomerase), f3h (flavanone 3-hydroxylase),
  f3′h (flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase), f3′5′h (flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase), dfr (dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase), ans (anthocyanidin synthase), and 3gt (flavonoid 3-glucosyltransferase).
  Metabolic intermediates are shown in boxes'
