caption: Model showing the function of bTRPV3 in the rumen. The ruminal epithelium
  is a multilayered, squamous epithelium of cells that are interconnected by gap junctions,
  thus forming a functional syncytium. a bTRPV3 (⓪) is a non-selective cation channel
  that can serve as a pathway for the uptake of nutrients such as Na+ and Ca2+, and
  contributes to the apical conductance for K+. Uptake of cations is stimulated by
  certain monoterpenoids such as menthol and thymol. Basolateral extrusion involves
  the sodium-potassium pump (ATP1A1,➀), basolateral K+ channels (➁), and sodium-calcium
  exchangers (➂). In the model, NH4+ is taken up by the same pathway as K+ (⓪,➁).
  Other TRP channels and exchangers may be involved (➃). b Within the ruminal lumen,
  large quantities of fermentational acids are produced, releasing protons that can
  partially be removed via efflux of NH4+ via bTRPV3 (⓪) and basolateral K+ channels
  (➁). In the liver, NH4+ is converted to non-toxic metabolites, mostly urea, but
  also some glutamine. Only glutamine can be utilized by mammalian enzymes for protein
  synthesis. Conversely, urea must be excreted. This can occur renally, resulting
  in nitrogen losses and environmental damage. Alternately, urea can be secreted into
  the rumen via urea transporters such as UT-B or aquaporin 3 (➄). After degradation
  by the microbiota within, NH3 is released and can be utilized by microbial enzymes
  for protein synthesis. NH3 also functions as a buffer, binding protons to form NH4+
  that is again removed via bTRPV3 (⓪). This “nitrogen recycling” can reach 20 mol
  day−1 in cattle. c At physiological pH gradients across the apical membrane, NH4+
  stimulates sodium transport via NHE (SLC9A3,➅) with apical recirculation of NH3
  via an unknown pathway (➆). Electrogenic transport of NH4+ across the basolateral
  membrane continues (➁). Specific staining for bTRPV3 can also be found within the
  cytosol, possibly reflecting expression of bTRPV3 or its splice variant in intracellular
  membranes such as those of the ER (➇)
