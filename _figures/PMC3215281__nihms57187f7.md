caption: '[A] The base excision repair model for expansion. Expansion can be directly
  induced under conditions of oxidation in mammalian cells. The 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine-DNA
  glycosylase [OGG1](green ball), a DNA glycosylase responsible for removal of oxidized
  guanines creates a single strand nick in the DNA. Together with the apo-endonucelase
  (APE)(blue ball) process the end to allow polymerase (Pol in red) to undertake gap-filling
  synthesis (dotted lines). The hairpins form by strand displacement together with
  any slippage that might occur during synthesis. The loading of FEN1 is inhibited
  on the hairpin since its 5’ end is hidden. The binding of MSH2/MSH3 stabilizes the
  repetitive hairpin, preventing flap removal. The slipped-stranded intermediate is
  converted into an expansion by an error-prone repair pathway. [B] The nucleotide
  excision repair model for expansion. There has been no direct data to support such
  an NER mechanism, to date. However, the hairpin can act as a complex lesion. After
  lesion recognition, a 10–20 nucleotide bubble is opened by TFIIH containing the
  XPB an XPD helicases followed by XPA binding. Strand cleavage occurs on the 5’ or
  3’ side of the lesion by ERCC1/XPF and XPG, respectively. The hairpins lesion is
  removed, but small slipped structures form during gap filling synthesis by the replication
  machinery including RFC, PCNA processivity factor, and DNA polymerases δ/ε. The
  loops are sealed into the DNA with DNA ligase I, and processed to generate an expansion.'
