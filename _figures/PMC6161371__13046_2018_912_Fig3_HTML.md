caption: Cooperation between c-Myc and YAP/TAZ or HSF1 cofactor (a) Phosphorilation
  of YAP/TAZ by Hippo signaling pathway promotes cytoplasmic localization and ubiquitin-mediated
  degradation. Unphosphorilated YAP/TAZ translocate in the nucleus where they control
  tissue growth and cell viability (b) Nuclear localizazion of YAP/TAZ was observed
  in several tumors, where they cooperate with c-Myc in the induction of tumorigenic
  pathways (c) HSF1 when trimerized and phosphorilated translocates in the nucleus
  where it binds HSEs DNA sequences to control heat shock proteins (d) In hepatocellular
  tumors, HSF1 overexpression correlates with c-Myc-dependent control of genes involved
  in tumorigenic pathways
