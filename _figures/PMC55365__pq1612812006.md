caption: Proposed model for Rac1-mediated STAT3 activation. We show that constitutively
  active small GTPases such as Rac1 stimulate the JAK/STAT3 pathway from an “inside-out”
  signaling pathway involving the induction of an autocrine IL-6 activation loop.
  The left side of the diagram is a simple illustration of an oncogenic mutation rendering
  constitutively active Ras or Rac1 (Ras*/Rac1*) signaling to one of its known downstream
  targets, the NF-κB transcription factor. NF-κB activation leads to its translocation
  to the nucleus, DNA binding, and subsequent induction of NF-κB-dependent genes such
  as IL-6. After IL-6 binds to its receptor, the JAKs are activated and in turn tyrosine
  phosphorylate STAT3 (-pY). Signal transduction by the JAK/STAT pathway for STAT3
  is depicted on the right side of the diagram. Phosphorylated STAT3 molecules form
  dimers and translocate to the nucleus to bind to promoter elements of responsive
  genes. Hence, gain-of-function mutations that render small GTPases constitutively
  active mediate STAT3 activation through the induction of an autocrine IL-6 activation
  loop.
