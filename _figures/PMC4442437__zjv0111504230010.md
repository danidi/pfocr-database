caption: Schematic of proposed mechanism for CpG-induced enhancement of the transepithelial
  transport of H9N2 WIV in nasal mucosa. CpGs first entered into the ECs, activated
  the TLR9 signaling pathway, and strongly stimulated ECs to secrete CCL20, which
  recruited more DCs into the submucosal regions. The polarity distribution of CCL20
  provided the possibility for TED formation. The presence of SIGN-R1 receptor on
  TEDs provided more possibilities for viral capture. After capture of the viruses
  and CpGs by TEDs, DCs gradually matured (phenotypic and functional maturation) and
  then quickly migrated into draining CLNs for antigen presentation. Finally, the
  antigen-specific immune response was initiated.
