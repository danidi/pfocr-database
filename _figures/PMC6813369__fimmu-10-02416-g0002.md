caption: 'Proposed role of the immunogenic cell death in pemphigus foliaceus. 1: Keratinocytes
  exposed to exogenous PF risk factors, such as mosquito saliva (, ), ultraviolet
  irradiation (), and thiol molecules (), present several stress-derived peptides
  through HLA class I molecules. These peptides are recognized by cytotoxic T CD8+
  cells and natural killer (NK) cells, which launch the immunogenic pathway. 2: This
  pathway induces damage-associated molecular patterns, including membrane exposure
  of CALR (). CALR is transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the outer cell
  membrane (), a process mediated by EIF2AK3 (). Calreticulin then interacts with
  SIRPA on the surface of dendritic cells, giving it a signal known as “eat me,” responsible
  for stimulating phagocytosis (). Relaying the opposite signal is CD47, an outer
  surface membrane protein that also interacts with SIRPA and antagonizes the activity
  of CALR, inhibiting phagocytosis (). We hypothesize that in PF the “eat me” signals
  prevail over the “don''t eat me” signals, increasing the phagocytosis of keratinocyte
  debris by dendritic cells. 3: Dendritic cells then present keratinocyte peptides,
  as those derived from desmoglein 1, to T helper cells. 4: T lymphocytes stimulate
  auto-antibody production by B lymphocytes. 5: The immunogenic cell death process
  initiated by exogenous stimuli also activates an adaptive immune response, which
  includes recruitment, and activation of both cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural
  killer cells.'
