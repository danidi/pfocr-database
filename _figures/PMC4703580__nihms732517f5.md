caption: Signaling through TREM2/DAP12 inhibits TLR responses through the DAP12 ITAM
  tyrosines, Syk and Btk/Tec. A) We hypothesize that the Lyp620R variant has the capacity
  to dephosphorylate Syk and/or the DAP12 ITAM tyrosines, resulting in partial phosphorylation
  of the DAP12 ITAM and/or Syk. This causes a reduction in the function of the TREM2/DAP12
  inhibitory pathway in monocytes and macrophages, thereby moderating TLR-induced
  NF-kB-dependent inflammatory cytokine production. B) We propose that when Lyp activity
  is inhibited, there is increased phosphorylation of DAP12 or increased signaling
  through Syk, resulting in a stronger inhibitory signal through TREM2/DAP12 and reduced
  IL-6 and TNF secretion. C) We propose that Lyp620W has a greater capacity to dephosphorylate
  DAP12 or Syk. This results in reduced DAP12 or Syk phosphorylation and a weaker
  inhibitory signal through TREM2/DAP12, leading to increased IL-6 and TNF secretion.
  Alternatively, Lyp620W may dephosphorylate a unique, distinct inhibitor than Lyp620R,
  thereby promoting TLR-induced IL-6 and TNF secretion.
