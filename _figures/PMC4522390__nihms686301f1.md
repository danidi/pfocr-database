caption: Proteins directly implicated in generating expansions in mouse models or
  human cells are shown as colored spheres. MMR refers to a complex consisting of
  the MMR proteins MutSα or MutSβ together with either MutLα or MutLγ. Red strands
  represent newly synthesized DNA. The repair of DNA damage within the repeat is initiated
  by DNA glycosylases in response to oxidized bases. This is followed by the removal
  of the abasic site by APE1 to generate a nick. (a) Repair of the nick may proceed
  via an LP BER pathway that involves Polβ, Polδ and perhaps Polε []. Strand-slippage/hairpin
  formation at the 3’ terminus of the nascent strand arising during strand displacement
  synthesis by Polδ/Polε could result in expansion if the hairpin is not removed because
  Polβ synthesis prevents proof-reading by Polδ/Polε []. Formation of a secondary
  structure on a displaced flap could also result in expansion if proper processing
  were blocked. A second LP BER pathway that involves Polβ but not Polδ/Polε may generate
  small expansions by stepwise and distributive gap-filling by Polβ and single-nucleotide
  gap formation by FEN1 []. Improper coordination between Polβ and FEN1 could lead
  to a small amount of strand displacement with the formation of a small hairpin in
  the displaced flap. FEN1 “alternate cleavage” of a short 5’ flap at the base of
  the hairpin could produce a ligatable nick that after ligation results in incorporation
  of hairpin bases into the “repaired” strand.(b) Alternatively, a nick close to a
  repeat loop-out formed during transcription or replication may allow loading of
  MutSβ/MutSα complexes and the diversion of the normal BER process to produce an
  MMR-dependent expansion. MMR proteins may also act in the LP BER-based expansion
  processes shown in (a) to stabilize secondary structures formed by the repeats and
  perhaps to prevent their removal by enzymes like FEN1. XPA, CSB and RAD52 may act
  in an auxiliary capacity in either of these pathways via the ability to stabilize
  secondary structures in the case of XPA, to facilitate incision by OGG1 in the case
  of RAD52 [] and to increase incision or to facilitate the formation of an optimal
  chromatin or transcriptional state in the case of CSB (reviewed in []). Loops generated
  at any stage of the expansion process are susceptible to oxidative damage that could
  produce result in repeated “toxic oxidation cycles” that could result in multiple
  rounds of BER-mediated expansions [].
