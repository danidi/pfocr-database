caption: Acp-group transfer catalyzed by PhTYW2. (A) Biosynthetic pathway of wybutosine.
  The chemical structures of the wyosine derivatives are shown. Modification enzymes,
  Trm5 and TYW1–4, are involved in each modification step. The chemical groups included
  in each reaction are shadowed in blue. The chemical structure of AdoMet is shown
  in the box. The methyl and acp groups are colored green and blue, respectively.
  (B) In vitro reconstitution of yW-86 synthesis using recombinant PhTYW2. RNaseT1-digested
  yeast tRNAPhe with the imG-14 intermediate (black), obtained from the ΔTYW2 strain,
  was reacted with PhTYW2 in the presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of
  AdoMet and was analyzed by LC/MS. Mass chromatographs for anticodon-containing fragments
  including imG-14 (m/z 661, black), yW-86 (m/z 678, green), and yW-173 (m/z 664,
  red) are overlaid. (C) Kinetic analysis of the acp-group transfer by PhTYW2. The
  α-carboxyl-14C labeled AdoMet and the imG-14 containing tRNAPhe were incubated at
  50 °C with recombinant PhTYW2 (closed circles) and without PhTYW2 (open circles),
  and the incorporation of α-carboxyl-14C into the tRNAPhe was quantified by scintillation
  counting. Data are represented as mean ± SE (n = 3).
