caption: (A) Subcellular localization of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in mammalian
  cells. Blue fonts indicate SREBP-2-regulated cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes. With
  the exception of HMGCR, all enzymes for the conversion of acetyl-CoA to farnesyl
  diphosphate contain functional peroxisomal targeting signals. Acetyl-CoA derived
  from peroxisomal β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids
  is channeled to cholesterol synthesis inside peroxisomes (; ). Farnesyl diphosphate
  leaves the peroxisomes and is converted either to cholesterol in the ER or to nonsterol
  isoprenoids. The conversion of acetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA also occurs in the cytoplasm.
  The mitochondrial and peroxisomal acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and the cytosolic and
  peroxisomal HMG-CoA synthase are encoded by single genes, respectively. In hepatocytes,
  the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids also partly takes place in peroxisomes.
  The primary C24-bile acids are formed from C27-bile acid intermediates by peroxisomal
  β-oxidation of the side chain, followed by conjugation of the C24-bile acids to
  glycine or taurine by the peroxisomal enzyme BAAT. Figure modified from Figure 1
  in . (B) Regulation of the SREBP-2 pathway. The precursor SREBP-2 is embedded as
  inactive transcription factor in ER membranes. In the presence of cholesterol and
  hydroxysterols (e.g., 25-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol), the SCAP-SREBP-2
  complex is retained in the ER by interaction with INSIG proteins. Whereas cholesterol
  binds to SCAP and induces a conformational change in SCAP through which it binds
  to INSIGs, hydroxysterols bind to INSIGs and cause INSIGs to bind to SCAP. In the
  absence of sterols, INSIGs dissociate from SCAP, whereupon the INSIGs are ubiquitinated
  and degraded in proteasomes. The SCAP-SREBP-2 complex is loaded into COPII-coated
  vesicles and transported to the Golgi. In the Golgi SREBPs are processed sequentially
  by Site-1 and Site-2 proteases to release the N-terminal transcription factor domain
  that then enters the nucleus and activates SRE (sterol regulatory element)-containing
  genes. Figure modified from Figure 2 in .
