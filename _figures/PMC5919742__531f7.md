caption: Cell-type expression patterns of carbon metabolism-related genes in V. carteri.
  Major pathways of central carbon metabolism are depicted as flow diagrams. Large
  shapes with colored shading and colored text labels are used to indicate subcellular
  compartments where indicated metabolic steps occur (chloroplast, mitochondrion,
  peroxisome, and cytosol). Major carbon sinks of starch and free fatty acids are
  also cartooned. Metabolites are in black lettering, chemical reactions are represented
  by solid arrows, and metabolite shuttling between subcellular compartments is represented
  by dashed arrows. Red arrows indicate a putative pathway for sugar biosynthesis
  in somatic cells. Genes encoding enzymes for indicated steps are in white lettering
  and surrounded by boxes that are color-coded according to their germ–soma expression
  patterns (color key in the upper left). Only genes with differential germ–soma gene
  expression are shown. Genes encoding subunits of a protein complex are grouped together
  in larger boxes. Paralogs inferred to have similar functions are grouped together
  in single boxes and separated by commas. Cell-type expression patterns of grouped
  paralogs were determined by computing the ratios of summed expression levels of
  paralogs in each cell-type (see Materials and Methods; Datasets S6 and S7). ECM,
  extracellular matrix; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
