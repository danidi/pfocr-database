caption: Model of proposed HEB, GATA3, and Notch1 interactions. Both HEB and E2A positively
  regulate Notch1 expression, whereas Notch1-DL signaling, in turn, induces the expression
  of HEBAlt. These interactions establish a positive-feedback loop between HEB and
  Notch1-DL signaling. E2A negatively regulates GATA3 indirectly through Gfi1b. HEB
  also provides a negative input for GATA3 expression, possibly through Gfi1b. Neither
  E2A nor HEB can compensate for the loss of the other for the proper regulation of
  GATA3. In the absence of HEB, Gfi1b expression is decreased and GATA3 expression
  is increased, while the expression of Notch1 target genes (arrow pointing to ICN)
  is decreased. Green arrow, positive regulation; red blunt arrow, negative regulation;
  dashed blunt arrow, partial inhibition; gray arrows, disrupted connections in the
  absence of HEB.
