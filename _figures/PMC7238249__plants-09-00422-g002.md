caption: Proposed model of the regulatory functions of cytokinin (CK) signaling pathway
  in plant drought adaptation. Information for this pathway was suggested from previous
  studies [,]. Numbers represent regulation processes that were found in Arabidopsis
  (1-9) and apple (10-15). Dashed lines indicate proposed processes that have not
  been experimentally validated. Arrowheads represent activation, and perpendicular
  bars indicate inhibition. CK signaling in drought stress response induced by abscisic
  acid (ABA) can be divided into two unique mechanisms at the cellular level. One
  is the indirect regulation by ABA-responsive transcription factors [MYC (myeloblastosis)
  and DREB (dehydration-responsive element binding)] via the CK metabolic gene family
  members IPTs and CKXs, to initiate the reduction of endogenous CK levels in plant.
  In the other mechanism, the inhibition of CK action can be induced by ABA-responsive
  component SnRK2, which directly phosphorylates type-A RR5 (ARR5), a negative regulator
  of CK signaling. As a result, expression of stress-responsive genes is regulated
  to confer modifications in physiological and biochemical activities in mediating
  plant responses to drought conditions.
