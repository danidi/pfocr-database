caption: MET signaling pathway in IPF. Enhanced MET activation controls genetic programs
  leading to cell growth, invasiveness and protection from apoptosis. For both the
  biological and therapeutic implications of MET activation in myofibroblasts in FF,
  its KRAS-driven pro-proliferating activity can be separated from the PI3CA-related
  pro-invasive role. The activity of branching morphogenesis depends on STAT family
  members, mainly STAT3 (Giordano et al. []). STAT3 is known to contribute to lung
  damage in IPF onset and progression (Pedroza et al. FASEB J 2016; 30(1):129–4)
