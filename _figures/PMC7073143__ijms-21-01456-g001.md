caption: Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated cell death. When physiological or pathological
  stimuli activates inflammasomes, ASC is recruited to lead to activation of caspase1.
  GSDMD is cleaved by caspase1 to release active GSDMD-N, translocating to the plasma
  membrane to induce pyroptosis. Meanwhile, GSDMD-N can also permeabilize the mitochondrial
  membrane to trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway downstream of inflammasome
  activation, inducing cell apoptosis.
