caption: (A) In rodent neurons, EphA activation leads to inhibition of ERK with resultant
  activation of TSC1/2. This suppresses mTOR activity and protein synthesis locally
  in neuritis (based on ). (B) In C. elegans, Eph homolog VAB-1 interacts with and
  inhibits PTEN activity. If this interaction were to occur in mammalian cells, it
  would increase Akt phosphorylation of TSC2, leading to increased mTOR activity and
  protein translation (based ). Whether such a mechanism occurs in mammalian cell
  is not yet known. Thick lines indicate activated interactions, and thin lines inactivated
  interactions.
