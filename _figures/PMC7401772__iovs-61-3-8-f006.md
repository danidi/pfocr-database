caption: Hypothetical scheme of the regulatory network underlying miR-19b targeted
  TSLP. miR-19b is essential in downregulating TSLP and could be stimulated to allergens
  on the ocular interface of epithelial cells and DCs. Under AC, TSLP elevation induces
  activation of the JAK/STAT3 pathway in DCs, which leads to surface expression of
  OX40L and increased expression of TSLP. These effects render DCs in an active and
  mature form. Subsequently, active DCs promote differentiation of Th2 cells to initiate
  and magnify the inflammatory response.
