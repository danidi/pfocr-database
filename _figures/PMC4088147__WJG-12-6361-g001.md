caption: Regulation of Nitric oxide (NO) and polyamine pathways. H pylori induces
  inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, arginase II and ornithine decarboxylase
  (ODC). iNOS competes with arginase for arginine. Gastric cancer relates to the high
  expression of iNOS. H pylori-induced iNOS is inhibited by spermine produced by the
  arginase-ODC pathway.

  risk of differentiated gastric cancer in a Japanese population.
