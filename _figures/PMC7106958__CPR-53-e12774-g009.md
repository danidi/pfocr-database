caption: Schematic representation of the miR‐137‐CaV3.1‐calcineurin‐NFATc3 signalling
  pathway in VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation. In this mechanism, miR‐137
  is downregulated in cerebral VSMCs under simulated microgravity conditions. As a
  direct target of miR‐137, CaV3.1 is upregulated and the T‐type VDCC currents are
  enhanced. Due to Ca2+ entry through CaV3.1 channel, the Ca2+ sensitive calcineurin
  activity is activated, more phosphorylated NFATc3 are dephosphorylated by calcineurin,
  and then translocate to nucleus to promote VSMC dedifferentiation and proliferation
