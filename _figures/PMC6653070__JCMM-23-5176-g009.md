caption: Hypothetical model of urokinase‐type plasminogen activator (uPA) system function
  in retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Upon binding to uPAR, uPA catalyses the conversion
  of plasminogen into plasmin, a serine protease involved in extracellular matrix
  (ECM) degradation and cell motility. As uPAR lacks an intracellular domain, its
  uPAR88‐92 sequence forms supramolecular complexes by interacting with transmembrane
  receptors of which the αvβ3 integrin, originally named vitronectin receptor, acts
  through multiple intracellular signalling including Rac1 to regulate the transcription
  of different genes including those encoding inflammatory factors. In the rd10 model,
  low retinal levels of HIF‐1α may prevent uPA/uPAR transcription thus resulting in
  low levels of uPA/uPAR proteins that impede plasmin function. Inflammation consequent
  to rod degeneration may induce αvβ3 integrin expression thus presumably exacerbating
  inflammatory processes. UPARANT improves RP‐associated damages possibly through
  inhibition of up‐regulated levels of αvβ3 integrin/Rac1 pathway thus suggesting
  that the drug may act downstream uPAR. αv, αv integrin subunit; β3, β3 integrin
  subunit; HIF‐1, hypoxia‐inducible factor 1; uPAR, uPA receptor
