caption: Cholesterol synthesis and metabolism in the brain. Cholesterol in neurons
  is primarily biosynthesized through Kandutsch-Russell pathway, whereas in astrocytes
  through Bloch pathway. Adult neurons essentially rely on astrocyte for cholesterol
  providing. Cholesterol uptake is via LRP1/LDLR receptors as apoE-containing cholesterol
  form. It is then converted to free cholesterol in endosome/lysosome in assistance
  of NPC1 and NPC2. Excess of cholesterol is prevented by intracellular esterification
  and storage in lipid droplets, or released as a complex with apolipoprotein-containing
  lipoprotein via ATP-binding cassette transporter, or converting to oxysterols then
  passing through BBB
