caption: Model for yeast epsin function in cell polarity and division. Yeast epsins,  Ent1
  and Ent2, bind Cdc42 GAPs Rga1 and Rga2 to activate Cdc42 signaling  towards cell
  polarity (Gic1/2-dependent) establishment pathways  (). From  this study we propose
  that epsins (particularly Ent2) affect septin  organization pathways by interacting
  with another GAP, Bem3, which is also  involved in septin ring formation. This novel
  septin-regulatory circuit would  be redundant with another pathway (X), yet to be
  identified.
