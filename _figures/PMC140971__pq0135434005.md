caption: A model of CFTR-EBP50-β2AR signaling. CFTR, β2AR, and EBP50 can exist as
  a complex at the apical surface of epithelial cells. G protein (G) can be associated
  with β2AR (data not shown; ref. ) and protein kinase A (PKA) anchored to AKAP via
  ezrin () and is likely to be in the complex. On agonist activation of the receptor,
  adenylate cyclase is stimulated through the Gs pathway (), leading to an increase
  in highly compartmentalized cAMP. This increased local concentration of cAMP leads
  to the activation of PKA, which is in close proximity to CFTR (), leading to a compartmentalized
  and specific signaling of the channel. Phosphorylation disrupts the complex, leading
  to the receptor-based activation of CFTR.
