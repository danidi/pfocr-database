caption: Initially, heat stress stimulation induces NF-κB activation, and this leads
  to an anti-apoptosis effect involving inhibition of heat stress-induced ROS accumulation
  that normally mediates the activation of MAPKs. In heat-stressed HUVECs, ERK1/2
  activation has an anti-apoptotic role, while activation of JNK and p38 is pro-apoptotic.
  The results of the present study confirm that HSP27 is an important anti-apoptotic
  protein, and NF-κB may modulate HSP27 expression levels and its translocation into
  the nucleus. In addition, HSP27 acting as a molecular chaperone may facilitate activation
  of this NF-κB pathway in HUVECs during heat stress recovery. Taken together, our
  findings suggest that this NF-κB signaling pathway involving HSP27, ROS, and MAPK
  is activated in response to heat stress and it confers a protective effect against
  heat stress-induced cell apoptosis.
