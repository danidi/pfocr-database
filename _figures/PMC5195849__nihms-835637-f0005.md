caption: Upon binding to their respective receptors, external stimuli result in a
  signaling cascade that either directly, or indirectly via upregulation of another
  protein (Y), result in changes in the GR signalling pathway. In the absence of GCs,
  these include changes in unliganded GR affinity for GCs, binding to chaperones,
  immunophillins and/or site-specific GR phosphorylation (see , as well as section
  5 for desensitizing and section 6 for priming, for details on the specific external
  signals). These changes, however, do not result in a GR-mediated transcriptional
  effect. Only upon co-stimulation with GCs, does the GR get recruited to promoters
  and elicit a transcriptional effect. In the case of priming, the modifications are
  all enhanced (green arrows), for example to increase GR phosphorylation or nuclear
  translocation, whereas in the case of desensitizing (red arrows), the modifications
  result in, for example, less GR nuclear translocation or decreased GC binding. Increased
  GR phosphorylation, can be involved in both priming and desensitization, depending
  on context. Labels are as for  and .
