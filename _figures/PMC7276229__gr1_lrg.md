caption: In the classical RAS pathway Renin, expressed from the renin gene induces
  cleavage of Angiotensinogen to Angiotensin I which is converted to Angiotensin II
  via Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Ang II activates the Angiotensin 1 receptor
  which results in an increase of blood pressure and further effects on the vascular
  system. In addition, Ang II suppresses renin synthesis via AT1R. To keep the system
  in balance a counter regulatory pathway exists. This pathway is activated through
  cleavage of Ang I to Ang1–9 via ACE2 or AT2R activation or Ang II to Ang1–7 which
  counter regulates via Mas receptor. This helps the system to stay within a homoeostatic
  balance, as long as the RAS activity is controlled.
