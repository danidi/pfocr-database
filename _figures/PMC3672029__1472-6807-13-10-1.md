caption: The aerobic and anaerobic pathways of cobalamin synthesis. CobL in the aerobic
  pathway is colored red. CbiE and CbiT, which are equivalent to CobL, are colored
  blue and red with a boxed label, respectively, in the anaerobic pathway. The chemical
  structures of cobalt-precorrin-6B, 7 and 8, which are the substrates and products
  of CbiE and CbiT, are shown at the bottom of the figure.
