caption: Sec14 and coordination of lipid metabolism with membrane trafficking. A DAG-requiring
  vesicle formation pathway is sensitive to flux through the cytidine-diphosphate
  (CDP)-choline pathway activity because PtdCho production via this mechanism occurs
  at the expense of DAG. Sec14 surveys flux by binding (sensing) the newly synthesized
  PtdCho (i.e. the accessible PtdCho pool). Sec14p initiates heterotypic exchange
  reactions and stimulates PtdIns-4-phosphate production by the Pik1p PtdIns 4-OH
  kinase. In a single vesicle budding pathway model, PIP substitutes for DAG in promoting
  vesicle budding. Alternatively, in a model where there are two pathways for vesicle
  budding, the two modes are distinguished by their threshold requirements for DAG
  and PtdIns-4-phosphate. Sec14p inactivation compromises both vesicle budding pathways.
  The activity of multiple pathways for vesicle formation in the yeast TGN/endosomal
  system is well-established []. Negative regulators of Sec14p-dependent vesicle budding
  pathways are highlighted in red -- including the proteins identified by loss-of-function
  ‘bypass Sec14p’ mutations (choline kinase, Cki1p; the choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase,
  Pct1p; choline phosphotransferase, Cpt1p, the PtdIns-4-phosphatase Sac1p, the oxysterol
  binding protein Kes1p). Positive regulators of Sec14p-dependent vesicle budding
  pathways are highlighted in blue. The interface between these two opposing is regulated
  by Sec14p-mediated heterotypic phopsholipid exchange (purple).
