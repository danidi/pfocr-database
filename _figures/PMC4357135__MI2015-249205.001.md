caption: 'The chaperone balance. Adipose tissue expansion leads to chronic release
  of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines. The low-grade inflammation can induce
  (i) activation of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory pathways leading to the blockage
  of iHSP70 and to insulin resistance, (ii) release of proinflammatory eHSP70 chronically
  from immune cells, and (iii) ROS and RNS, oxidative/nitrosative stress that leads
  to protein damage and denaturation. eHSP70 is increased as a danger signal and to
  combat the plasma oxidative damage; however, when chronically elevated, it (i) induces
  further immune activation and proinflammatory response and (ii) activates TLR and
  the inflammatory pathway leading to the reduction of HSF-1 activation and eventually
  to reduced iHSP70. Lower iHSP70 causes (i) reduced insulin sensitivity, (ii) intensification
  of the NF-κB activation and inflammation, and (iii) reduced antioxidant, antiapoptotic,
  and anti-inflammatory capacity. The long-term insulin resistance determines the
  onset of diabetes, completing this positive feedback mechanism. Lower panels: when
  the eHSP70/iHSP70 ratio chronically changes in favor of eHSP70, the “insulin sensitivity
  button” is switched off and R values ([eHSP70]/[iHSP70]) rise; exercise induces
  iHSP70 expression while the release of eHSP70 responds in an opposite manner. R
  values between 0 and 1 indicate an anti-inflammatory status and between 1 and 5
  indicate an optimum immunoinflammatory surveillance status, while R values above
  5 suggest an undesirable chronic proinflammatory status.'
