caption: Bubble plot for the enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways
  of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and
  the SIRT3-related DEGs. (A) The enriched pathways of the SIRT3-related DEGs. (B)
  The enriched pathways of the AD-related DEGs. The size of the bubble represents
  the gene number enriched in that pathway, and the color of the bubble represents
  the adjusted P-value of the pathway. The X axis represents the fold change of the
  pathway.
