caption: Pro-cancer activities of extracellular adenosine and therapeutic targets
  for improvement of cancer immunotherapy. Tissue hypoxia in tumors increases extracellular
  adenosine production through induction of CD39 and CD73. Produced adenosine transmits
  immunosuppressive signals through adenosine receptors on various immune cells. A2AR
  stimulation in effector T cells (Teff) blocks T cell receptor signaling and impairs
  effector functions including IFN-γ production and cytotoxicity. In antigen-presenting
  cells (APC), signals through A2AR and A2BR reduce Th1-type cytokine milieu and induce
  tolerogenic APC. Interaction of Teff with these APC will impair activation of cellular
  immune response against cancer cells. Adenosine enhances immunoregulatory activity
  of regulatory T cells (Treg). The qualitative and quantitative increase of Treg
  results in stronger inactivation of antitumor immune response. In addition, adenosine
  can promote proliferation, survival and metastatic activity of cancer cells. Suppression
  of adenosine pathway will be able to weaken the intensity of immunosuppression in
  tumor microenvironment and direct effect on cancer cells. Potential target molecules
  are adenosine receptors (A2AR and A2BR) and adenosine-producing enzymes (CD39 and
  CD73). Oxygen supplementation can also decrease pro-cancer effects of adenosine
  as well as adenosine-independent immunosuppression by hypoxia.
