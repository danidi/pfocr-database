caption: Akt regulates growth by phosphorylating and inhibiting the TSC1-TSC2 complex
  in drosophila. A schematic representation of genetic epistasis illustrates that
  stimulation of Akt activity, by activation of IR, PI(3)K, or loss of PTEN, results
  in TSC2 phosphorylation. This event inactivates TSC1–TSC2 complex. The inactivation
  results in increased cell growth, mediated by downstream inhibition of mTOR and
  activation of S6K.
