caption: 'Intracellular signaling proposed to be involved in the inflammatory response
  during immune-mediated joint diseases such as aseptic loosening. Extracellular and
  intracellular PRR sense various bacterial and endogenous stimuli including opsonized
  wear particles (WPs), such as polyethylene, CoCrMo, and Cr2O3, released from the
  surface of biomaterial that could trigger the production of inflammatory signals
  represented mostly by cytokines. Extracellular PRR receptors such as TLR-1, −2,
  −5, −6, and −11 are stimulated by bacterial lipoprotein, flagellin, profilin, and
  WPs such as opsonized Cr2O3 and opsonized CoCrMo triggering the activation and translocation
  of transcription factors nuclear factor κ-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
  and activator protein 1 (AP-1) to the nucleus. NF-κB is activated by a cascade initiated
  here by cytoplasmic toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain that associates with a TIR domain-containing
  adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), which recruits
  IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK)4 and IRAK2. This complex associates with
  tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 and subsequently activates
  transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), followed by activation of
  IκB kinase (IKK) complex for NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
  including JNK and p38 for AP-1. The above-described pathways involved in the activation
  of NF-κB and AP-1 are also stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), calcium- and
  zinc-binding proteins S100 [predominantly found as calprotectin (S100A8/A9)], and
  high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), all sensed by the receptor for advanced
  glycation end products (RAGE), and on ligation of TNF-α to its receptor (TNF-R).
  LPS also activates its primary extracellular receptor TLR-4. In the case of TJA,
  TLR-4 could be activated also by Co2+ ions, which induces dimerization of TLR-4
  subunits leading to MyD88 activation through TIR domain-containing adaptor protein
  (TIRAP). TLR-4 activates also interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3, a transcription
  factor involved in the regulation of expression of several proinflammatory cytokines
  through a pathway initiated by TIR-domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-β
  (TRIF)-related adaptor molecule (TRAM). This interaction recruits TRAF 3 leading
  to activation of TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK)-binding kinase-1
  (TBK1) and IKKε for activation of IRF3. After endocytosis of opsonized WP, its components
  get to the lumen of the endolysosomal network organelles, stimulating here membrane-anchored
  TLR-3, −7, −8, and −9, or WP components could be released to cytosol, for example,
  after endosomal rupture, and could interact with a nucleotide binding oligomerization
  domain (NOD) receptors or with inflammasome. inflammasomes represent a heterogenous
  group of protein complexes forming either NLRP or NALP (used as an example in the
  figure) or NLRC. NLRP abbreviates for NAIP, CIITA, HET-E and TP1 (NACHT)-, leucine-rich
  repeat (LRR)- and pyrin domains (PYD)-containing protein. NLRC abbreviates for NACHT-
  LRR- and caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein (NLRC). inflammasomes
  contain further the apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing PYD and CARD,
  which are in the NLRP involved in the binding of effector protein—pro-caspase1—through
  its CARD subdomain. NLRC bind pro-caspase 1 directly. Selected PAMP and DAMP interaction
  with LRR domain induces conformational changes leading to caspase-1 activation allowing
  cleavage of cytokine precursors pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to active IL-1β and IL-18,
  which are subsequently released from the cell. NODs are activated by bacterial flagellin,
  RNA, and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), but also by CoCrMo or Co2+ released from WP during
  endosome disruption. NLRP and NLRC are activated by biphasic manner consisting of
  (a) their transcription initiated with contribution of transcription factors NF-κB
  and probably AP-1 and IRF3, and (b) their subsequent activation, in TJA through
  CoCrMo or Co2+ wear. Bacterial and viral nucleic acids could stimulate inflammation
  through TLR-3, −7, −8, −9, which signal through IRAK4 and IRAK1 to activate TRAF
  6 but also IRF7, transcription factor involved in the regulation of transcription
  of several members of IFNα family. Nucleic acids could also stimulate inflammation
  through cytosolic helicases: retinoid acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and MELANOMA
  differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) signaling through mitochondrial membrane-associated
  adaptor IPS-1 involved in activation of TBK1/IKKε, NF-κB, and MAPK-dependent AP-1.
  Double-stranded cytosol-localized DNA is also sensed by helicases DDX41 and IFNγ-inducible
  protein 16 (IFI16) both signaling through endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated
  stimulator of interferon genes (STING), which interacts with TBK1/IKKε. All above
  pathways merge on three transcription factors NF-κB, AP-1, and IRF3 involved in
  transcription of proinflammatory cytokines IFNβ1, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α, GM-CSF, IL-8,
  IL-10, and IL-33, as well as IL-1β and IL-18. Fourth depicted transcription factor
  IRF7 is responsible for transcription of several members of IFNα family.'
