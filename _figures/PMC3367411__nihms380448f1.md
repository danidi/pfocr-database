caption: The long pentraxin PTX3 acts as a soluble multifunctional protein. The multifunctional
  properties of PTX3 involve interaction with a number of different ligands such as
  the complement component C1q, the growth factor FGF2, the extracellular matrix component
  TSG-6, late apoptotic cells and outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria.
  Interaction of PTX3 with its ligands is essential for the multifunctional properties
  exerted by this pentraxin in microbial recognition, discrimination between self
  and nonself, tissue remodelling, and tuning of the inflammatory response. Binding
  of PTX3 to plastic-immobilized C1q induces activation of the classical complement
  pathway and the angiogenic activity of FGF2 in vivo and in vitro is blocked by PTX3.
  In addition PTX3 is an integral component of the extracellular matrix and plays
  a crucial role in female fertility.
