caption: Increased basal HO-1 may confer cytoprotection against I/R injury by increasing
  Akt activity directly via phosphorylation of p85 and/or Akt by BVR and/or HO-1 itself.
  In addition the increased bilirubin production by BVR buffers intracellular ROS
  production, leading to decreased dephosphorylation of Akt. The enhanced Akt activity
  preserves metabolic stability and mitochondrial membrane potential, resulting in
  inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated by cytochrome c and caspase-9.
  The end result is enhanced cell survival in the presence of cellular stress such
  as triggered by hypoxia and reoxygenation.
