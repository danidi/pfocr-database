caption: 'The proteins encoded by the 3 major PAM splice variants (PAM-1, -2, and
  -3) are shown above the dotted line: paired basic cleavage sites are indicated by
  vertical black ovals; the pro-region is removed early in the biosynthetic pathway;
  the transmembrane domain (TMD) is marked. The major protein products resulting from
  intragranular, cell surface and endosomal endoproteolytic processing of PAM-1 are
  shown below the dotted line; cleavage sites are marked by red arrows. The major
  fate of each isoform or cleavage product is indicated to the right of the diagram.'
