caption: (A) In dendritic cells, LPS induced TLR4 signaling occurs through both MyD88-dependent
  and -independent pathways. A MyD88-dependent pathway leads to rapid activation of
  NFκB and Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and production of inflammatory
  cytokines. A MyD88-independent pathway induces slow activation of NFκB and MAP kinases
  as well as IRF-3. The activation of IRF-3 induces production of IFN-β. Secreted
  IFN-β stimulates IFN- β receptor which leads to activation of STAT1 and STAT2, resulting
  in induction of IFN-inducible genes such as IP-10 and GARG-16 in dendritic cells
  (). In astrocytes, LPS induces early recruitment of MyD88 and subsequent activation
  of MyD88-dependent pathway leading to NFκB activation. NFκB is activated after degradation
  of IkB-α, p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFκB subunits (p65 and
  p50), followed by p38-dependent transcriptional activity of the NFκB complex and
  induction of target genes including TNF-α, IL-27, IL-15, Matrix metalloproteinase
  (MMP)-9 and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1). Induction of TRIF-dependent
  IFN-β is not detected in astrocytes, but a MyD88-independent pathway induces delayed,
  MAPK, JNK and p38- mediated, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, and activation of
  downstream genes IP-10 and SOCS-1. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is involved in Egr-1,
  IL-15, and MMP-9 induction. STAT1 can exert a negative control on the expression
  of certain genes, such as MMP-9. Microglial signaling initiated by TLR4 consists
  of at least two pathways, MyD88-mediated NFκB activation and TRIF-mediated IRF-3
  activation. Activated IRF-3 induces IFN-β expression, which via IFN-β receptors
  initiates STAT1 signaling that activates IRF-1. TLR4 on NPCs exposed to LPS mediates
  signaling through both the MyD88-dependent pathway that results in NFκB activation,
  as well as through TRIF, which activates IRF-3. Neurons treated with LPS show no
  activation of NFκB, TRIF or JNK pathways (, ).(B) The TLR4 signaling complex in
  immune cells and neurons. In human and rodent immune cells, TLR4 dimers bind to
  the adaptor proteins CD14 and MD-2. An additional complex comprised of RP105 and
  MD-1 serves as an inhibitor of TLR4. In rodent neurons, TLR4 dimers bind CD14 and
  either MD-1 or MD-2 (, ).
