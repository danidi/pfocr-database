caption: Schematic model of regulation of PTPα by STEP61 during EtOH treatment in
  DMS. At basal conditions, active STEP61 gates phosphorylation of PTPα and its translocation
  to the lipid rafts fractions where Fyn and NMDAR reside. Upon EtOH exposure, GPCR
  (such as D1R and A2AR) is activated, followed by activation of adenylate cyclase
  (AC) and production of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits
  (R) of PKA releases the active catalytic subunits (C) and subsequent phosphorylation
  of STEP61 at a regulatory site (Ser221), which is known to disrupt the interactions
  between STEP61 and several of its substrates. Phosphorylation of STEP61 (inactive)
  blocks its action on dephosphorylation of PTPα at Y789. Phosphorylated PTPα translocates
  to lipid rafts (maybe through binding to some adaptor proteins, with the mechanisms
  unclear), activates Fyn by dephosphorylating its inhibitory site (Y531) and enhances
  NMDAR signaling, which is implicated in EtOH-related behaviors. The mechanisms underlying
  the region specificity (i.e. DMS versus DLS and NAc) remain unclear. We propose
  that distinct PKA regulatory and catalytic subunits and region-specific or compartment-specific
  distribution of AKAPs may be involved. GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; D1R, dopamine
