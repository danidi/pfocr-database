caption: Mitoflashes serve as an early predictor when lifespan is altered by diverse
  genetic, environmental and stochastic factors in C. elegans, and participate in
  early developmental (proliferation) and pathophysiological stress responses (hyperosmotic
  and apoptotic stress). Note that, except for a few cases, little is known about
  the specific pathways involved in mitoflash signalling. Continuous lines, activation
  (→) or inhibition (―|); dashed arrows, simplified signal pathway.
