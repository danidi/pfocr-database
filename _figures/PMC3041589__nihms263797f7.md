caption: Model of Type I and II EOC cells. Type I epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC)
  cells have high levels of IKKβ expression due to low hsa-miR-199a; therefore, when
  stimulated, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation leads to cytokine production, cell
  proliferation and induction of antiapoptotic proteins. In Type II cells expression
  of IKKβ is low due to high hsa-miR-199a expression levels, therefore an incomplete
  TLR4–MyD88–NF-κB pathway cannot respond to ligands, resulting in no cytokine production
  and chemosensitivity.
