caption: Network diagram of Sp1-interacting proteins. Different Sp1-interacting proteins
  are presented. This interaction network was created with the aid of software Pathway
  Architect 2.01 (Stratagene), and represents both the previously known and the newly
  discovered binding associations among all of these proteins.
