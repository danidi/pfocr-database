caption: 'Potential LMTK2-related neurodegenerative mechanisms in Alzheimer’s disease.
  In healthy cells, CDK5/p35 phosphorylates and activates LMTK2. Activated LMTK2 inactivates
  PP1C by phosphorylating it which leads to increased inhibitory phosphorylation of
  GSK3β. In physiological conditions, (A) CDK5/p35 and GSK3β phosphorylates tau. (B)
  GSK3β also phosphorylates KLC2 to regulate kinesin-1 based transport while (C) PP1C
  inhibits pro-apoptotic factor Bim. Alzheimer’s disease related neuronal stress (e.g.
  β-amyloid, ROS etc.) induces calpain mediated cleavage of the CDK5 activator subunit
  p35 into p25 and p10. p25 prolongs CDK5 activity. Whether CDK5/p25 can activate
  LMTK2 in the same way as CDK5/p35 is not known. This and neuronal stress related
  reduced LMTK2 expression lead to blocked LMTK2 phosphorylation pathway. Disrupted
  LMTK2 phosphorylation pathway causes PP1C dephosphorylation and activation which
  in turn activates GSK3β by removing its inhibitory serine-9 phosphorylation. (A’)
  Overactivated GSK3β and CDK5/p25 abnormally hyperphosphorylate tau. Abnormal tau
  hyperphosphorylation disrupts tau function and microtubule network, affects axonal
  transport, and forms neurofibrillary tangles. (B′) Overactivated GSK3β phosphorylates
  KLC2 resulting in cargo release and disrupted Smad2 transport, and signalling. (C′)
