caption: 'Position and potential role of IPK in the plant terpenoid metabolic network.
  Cytosolic and plastidial (highlighted in green) terpenoid metabolic pathways involved
  in the biosynthesis of sterols, sesquiterpenes, and monoterpenes in plants with
  individual enzymes depicted as boxes. The MVA pathway enzymes are highlighted in
  orange, the MEP pathway enzymes are highlighted in white, and enzymes involved in
  downstream terpenoid formation are highlighted in yellow. The enzymes with peroxisomal
  localization are depicted on a striped background. The unknown transporters involved
  in IPP and IP exchange across the plastid envelope membranes are shown in gray.
  Site of action of the MVA and MEP pathway-specific inhibitors (lovastatin and fosmidomycin,
  respectively), as well as feed-forward inhibition of FPPS by IP/DMAP, are indicated.
  The recently discovered MPD acting in the alternative MVA pathway in R. castenholzii
  and H. volcanii is shown on a gray background. Dashed lines in sterol biosynthesis
  represent multiple enzymatic steps. Abbreviations: AACT, aceto-acetyl-CoA thiolase;
  CMK, 4-(cytidine 5′-diphospho)-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase; DXS, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose
  5-phosphate synthase; GA-3P, d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; HDR, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl
  diphosphate reductase; HDS, (E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate synthase;
  HMGS, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase; HYD1, C-8,7 sterol isomerase; MCT,
  2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase; MDS, 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol
  2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase; MK, mevalonate kinase; Phos, phosphatase(s); SQS,
  squalene synthase; TPS, terpene synthases (including monoterpene synthases and sesquiterpene
  synthases).'
