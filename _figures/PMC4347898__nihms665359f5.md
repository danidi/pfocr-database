caption: 'Phosphortlated Smad3 is stabilized by ERG in prostate cells. Smad3 is phosphorylated
  by TGF-β through binding to its receptor. Phosphorylated Smad3 forms a complex with
  phosphorylated Smad2 and the co-Smad (Smad4) and translocates to the nucleus. Phosphorylated
  Smad3 is stabilized by binding to ERG in nucleus. (CF: Co-factor; P: Phosphorylated
  group).'
