caption: Pathway of intracellular signaling through IL-6 receptors. IL-6 binds to
  membrane-bound IL-6R and then associates with a secondary receptor known as gp130.
  When two of the resulting complexes combine to form a hexamer, the two gp130 molecules
  form a homodimer in the cytoplasmic region, the signal transmission system is activated,
  and the IL-6 signal is transmitted to the nucleus. Alternatively, soluble IL-6 receptor
  present in body fluids forms a complex with IL-6, and when that complex associates
  with gp130 on the cell surface, the IL-6 signal is transmitted into the cell.
