caption: Wiring diagrams for a three-module decomposition of the intrinsic apoptotic
  pathway. (A) Initiator module. (B) Amplifier module. (C) Executioner module. Ovals
  and rectangles represent proteins in different activity states. Solid and dashed
  lines represent chemical reactions and regulatory signals, respectively. An arrow
  with two tails and one head represents the association of two proteins to form a
  complex. Black balls on the tails indicate a reversible association and dissociation
  reaction. An arrow with one tail and two heads indicates a complex that splits into
  two parts, with a chemical transformation (like degradation or inactivation) of
  at least one component. Five small circles represent degradation products. In B,
  the four BAXm icons represent a tetrameric complex that opens channels in the mitochondrial
  outer membrane. See text for details.
