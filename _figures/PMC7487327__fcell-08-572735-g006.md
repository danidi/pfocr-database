caption: Model of the ZP-signaling pathway in mouse sperm. ZP glycoproteins bind to
  a yet unknown receptor (recognition), which initiates a signaling cascade. This
  cascade requires a hyperpolarized membrane potential (Vm), set by the Slo3/Lrrc52-channel
  complex, and cAMP synthesis by sAC (priming). Thereby, a pHiresponse, resting on
  Na+/H+ exchange by NHA1, and probably NHA2, is enabled that promotes Ca2+ influx
  through CatSper (signaling). Shaded objects indicate that the signaling mechanism
  and function of the molecules has not been established yet.
