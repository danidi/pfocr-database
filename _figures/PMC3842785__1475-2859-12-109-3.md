caption: Pathways used to assemble the metabolic pathway analysis models. This metabolic
  network includes 10 metabolic pathways distinguished by line color. Metabolic Models
  I-IX consist of different combinations of these pathways. Open circles represent
  amino acids detected in cell hydrolysates, whose isotope labeling patterns were
  used in the MPA. The amino acids are connected to their metabolic precursor(s) by
  dotted lines. Genes encoding proteins catalyzing all reactions in these pathways
  were found in the annotated Pt genome.
