caption: The ADGRG2 and CFTR localized at cell plasma membrane, whereas Gs and Gq
  localize at the inner surface of non-ciliated cells. Deficiency of ADGRG2 in Adgrg2-/Y
  mice, reducing the Gq protein level by half in Gnaq+/- mice or PKC inhibitor Ro
  31–8220 significantly destroyed the coupling of ADGRG2 to CFTR, thus impaired Cl-
  and H+ homeostasis and fluid reabsorption of efferent ductules. Structurally, residues
  in intracellular loops 2 and 3 of ADGRG2 are required for the specific interactions
  between ADGRG2 and Gq, which are required for CFTR and ADGRG2 coupling and fluid
  reabsorption. In addition to G protein signaling, β-arrestin-1 is also required
  for fluid reabsorption in efferent ductules by scaffolding the ADGRG2 and CFTR coupling
  and complex formation. Therefore, a signaling complex including ADGRG2, Gq, β-arrestin-1
  and CFTR that specifically localizes in non-ciliated cells is responsible for the
  regulation of Cl- and H+ homeostasis and fluid reabsorption in the efferent ductules;
  thus, these functions are important for male fertility. Moreover, activation of
  the AGTR2 could rescue the H+metabolic disorder caused by ADGRG2 deficiency, which
  restored the ability of fluid reabsorption in efferent ductules, providing a potential
  therapeutic strategy in treatment of male infertility caused by dysfunction of GPCR-CFTR
  signaling in non-ciliated cells.
