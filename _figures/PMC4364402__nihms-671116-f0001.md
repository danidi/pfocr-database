caption: Schematic depicting the cell types involved in the detection of diverse itch
  stimuli. DRG neurons (blue; left) innervate the skin and can be activated directly
  by exogenous or endogenous itch-inducing agents (pruritogens) released by keratinocytes,
  immune cells or neighboring neuronal afferent endings. However, many of these endogenous
  compounds also activate keratinocytes and various immune cells. In addition, cross-talk
  between all three cell types, via release of secreted compounds (for example, via
  neurogenic inflammation), can further modulate cellular responsiveness and itch
  pathway output. Distinct subsets of sensory neuron afferents innervate the skin
  and mediate itch signaling (right). The pruritogen histamine activates neurons via
  the histamine receptor 1 (H1) that leads to the opening of TRPV1 ion channels (red;
  top right). The pruritogens BAM8–22 and chloroquine activate neurons via MrgprC11
  and MgprA3, respectively, leading to opening of TRPA1 channels (red; middle right).
  The cytokine TSLP activates neurons via TSLPR, which leads to the opening of TRPA1
  channels (red; bottom right). The activation of TRPV1 or TRPA1 leads to neuronal
  depolarization, action potential firing and the transmission of itch signals from
  the periphery to the CNS. See  for a complete list of pruritogens and receptors
  implicated in itch.
