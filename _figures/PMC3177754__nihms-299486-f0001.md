caption: Interactions between viruses and RIG-I and MDA5 are delineated by arrows.
  Red arrows depict known requirements for RIG-I in sensing viruses while blue arrows
  denote known requirements for MDA5. Of note, members of the Flaviviridae and Reoviridae
  can trigger both MDA5 and RIG-I activation. The RNA Polymerase III pathway for generation
  of RIG-I ligands and the DNA viruses and bacteria, Legionella, known to activate
  this pathway are also shown.
