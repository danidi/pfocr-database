caption: Role of astrocytes in post-traumatic synapse loss and repair. The upregulation
  of astrocytic ephrin B1 and STAT3 phosphorylation following TBI have been found
  to coincide with a decrease in VGlut1 (a) (). The tonic release of astrocytic d-serine
  has been associated with synapse damage after TBI (b) (). Astrocytic calcineurin/NFAT
  signalling pathway induces synaptic strength loss in CA1 and a reduction in synaptic
  protein loss (PSD95 and GluR1) (c) (). MMP3 has been implicated in maladaptive synaptic
  recovery after TBI (e) (). Hevin has been shown to promote post-traumatic synaptogenesis
  which was amplified by the blockade of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway (d) (). Thrombospondin
  1 (which is regulated by STAT3) has been found to promote synapse recovery after
  motor neuron injury (f) ().
