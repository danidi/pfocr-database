caption: Simplified bacterial (left) and fungal (right) l-arabinose degradation pathway
  used for metabolic engineering of S. cerevisiae. l-Arabinose is taken up via Gal2p
  in both pathways. The further l-arabinose catabolism is linked to the central carbon
  metabolism via d-xylulose-5-P, an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway.
  In the fungal route, l-arabinose is reduced to l-arabinitol by the xylose reductase
  Xyl1p and further oxidized to l-xylulose catalyzed by the l-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase
  Lad1p. l-Xylulose is then reduced to xylitol by the l-xylulose reductase Xyl2p,
  which is further oxidized to d-xylulose by the xylitol dehydrogenase Xyl2p. The
  conversion of d-xylulose to d-xylulose-5-P by the xylulokinase Xks1p is the final
  step. In the bacterial route, l-arabinose is converted to l-ribulose by the isomerase
  AraA, phosphorylated to l-ribulose-5-P via the l-ribulokinase AraB and converted
  to d-xylulose-5-P by the l-ribulose-5-P 4-epimerase AraD. All steps of the bacterial
  route are cofactor-independent
