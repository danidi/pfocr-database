caption: 'Schematic representation of hypothetical changes in Sb(V) metabolism in
  Leishmania donovani resulting in natural Sb(V) resistance. (Circled 1) Lower expression
  of thiol biosynthetic enzymes GCS and ODC putatively leads to a lower rate of thiol
  biosynthesis, and this in turn might inhibit the activation of Sb(V) inside the
  amastigote. (Circled 2) Lower expression of AQP1 is likely to be translated into
  a lower uptake of Sb(III) emanating from the Sb(V) activation by the macrophage.
  The detoxification pathway of Sb(III) (shown in light gray), which includes complex
  formation of Sb(III) with trypanothione and subsequent sequestration and/or export,
  was not found to be involved in natural Sb(V) resistance. [Functions and full names
  of all mentioned enzymes are explained in Table . Other abbrevions used are the
  following: T(SH)2, trypanothione in dithiol form; TS2, trypanothione in disulfide
  form; Sb-TS2, conjugate Sb(III) with trypanothione].'
