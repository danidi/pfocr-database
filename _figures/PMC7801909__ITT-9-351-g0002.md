caption: Inhibitory and activating signaling via FcαRI after ligand binding. (A) Monomeric
  IgA (not complexed to an antigen) does not induce FcαRI cross-linking resulting
  in partial phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs)
  and recruitment of Src homology region 2 domain‐containing phosphatase‐1 (SHP‐1).
  This results in inhibition of ITAM signaling, and impairs phosphorylation of spleen
  tyrosine kinase (Syk), LAT and ERK, which is initiated through signaling via other
  activating Fc receptors (like IgG-mediated Fcγ receptor activation). The exact binding
  of free dIgA to FcαRI, and concomitant signaling, has not yet been resolved. (B)
  IgA immune complexes (eg IgA-coated Escherichia coli) induce cross‐linking of FcαRI,
  resulting in ITAM phosphorylation of the associated FcR γ-chain. Phosphorylated
  ITAMs subsequently function as a docking site for signaling molecules such as Syk.
  Syk plays an essential role in initiating signaling pathways, including the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAPK
  pathway. Activation of signaling pathways results in pro‐inflammatory cellular functions
  such as phagocytosis, antibody‐dependent cellular cytotoxicity, respiratory burst,
  degranulation, antigen presentation, and release of NETS, cytokines and inflammatory
  mediators. Created with BioRender.com.
