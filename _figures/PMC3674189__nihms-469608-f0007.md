caption: DPN binding to OL ERβ induces growth factor (BDNF/Trk-B and IGF-1/IGF-1R)
  activated phosphorylation of ERβ to pERβ. Such phosphorylation could facilitate
  the recruitment of unknown co-activators and various enzymes including PI3K. Ligand-mediated
  activation and autophosphorylation of Src family of tyrosine kinase initiate downstream
  signaling cascade by phosphorylation and activation. Downstream of PI3K, the pathway
  activates Akt and mTOR. Phosphorylated Akt activates a number of different pathways
  and plays an important role in decreasing apoptotic markers, such as calpain and
  caspase-3, to prevent cell death (as we have described in this report). A key target
  of p-Akt activation is mTOR, which controls protein synthesis by activating P70S6K.
  Phosphorylated P70S6K further phosphorylates S6, which is required for protein synthesis
  to induce cell survival, cell differentiation, and axon myelination.
