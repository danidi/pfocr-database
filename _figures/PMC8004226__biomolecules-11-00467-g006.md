caption: 'A network of putative senolytic compounds with their biological targets.
  (A) Interactions of tanshinone I with its phamarcological targets: TOP1, CA1,CES1,
  ACHE, PTPN6 and RAD51. (B) Interactions of preussomerin C with its phamarcological
  targets: CCR1,CCR2,CCR3,CCR6,CCR7,CCR8, CCR9, CXCL10, FOS and JUN. (C) Interactions
  of hinokitiol with its phamarcological targets: HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC4, HDAC5,HDAC6,
  HDAC8, and TYR. The compound-target network was generated with CoSE Layout in Cytoscape
  software, version 3.8.2 []. The network was constructed with several pathways involved
  in senescence represented with the nodes of different colors and compounds (Methods):
  Nodes represent compounds or targets related to senescence according to their color.
  An edge represents a relation obtained from BindingDB. Abbreviations: DNA topoisomerase
  1 (TOP1), carbonic anhydrase 1 (CA1), liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), acetylcholinesterase
  (ACHE), tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (PTPN6), DNA repair protein
  RAD51 homolog 1 (RAD51), CC chemokine receptor 1–3,6–9 (CCR1–3, 6–9), C-X-C motif
  chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), Jun Proto-Oncogene, AP-1 Transcription Factor Subunit
  (JUN), Fos Proto-Oncogene, AP-1 Transcription Factor Subunit (FOS), histone deacetylase
  1,2,4–6,8 (HDAC1,2,4–6,8), tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 6 (TYR),
  DNA damage/telomere stress-induced senescence (DD/TSIS), pentose phosphate pathway
  and glycolysis in senescent cells (PPPsc), oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), DNA
  damage response (DDR), oxidative stress-induced senescence (OSIS), glycolysis in
  senescence (Gis), senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), intrinsic pathways
  for apoptosis (IPFA) and the cell cycle (CC).'
