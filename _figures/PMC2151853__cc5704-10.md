caption: Differences in signaling pathway activation with lung stretch with mechanical
  ventilation with and without hyperoxia. Activation of the JNK pathway was involved
  in ventilator-induced neutrophil infiltration, cytokine production, and microvascular
  permeability with and without hyperoxia. Both ERK and JNK were involved in airway
  epithelial cell apoptosis with and without hyperoxia. The major difference in the
  signaling pathway activation was that ERK1/2 activation was involved in increased
  MIP-2 production and neutrophil infiltration only in mice exposed to high-tidal
  volume ventilation with hyperoxia, and not in mice exposed to high-tidal volume
  ventilation without hyperoxia. JNK activation was involved with and without hyperoxia.
  ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MIP-2,
  macrophage inflammatory protein-2.
