caption: 'One-carbon metabolism is encompassed of a complex metabolic network centered
  by the folate and methionine cycles. Serine and glycine provide one-carbon unit
  to the folate cycle. The folate cycle is coupled with the methionine (Met) cycle
  for Met regeneration catalyzed by methionine synthase (MS). Met can also be regenerated
  through betaine-homocysteine (Hcy) methyltransferase (BHMT), using betaine as the
  one-carbon donor. Met provides the essential substrate for MAT (methionine S-adenosyltransferase)s,
  generating S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). SAM methylates a wide range of substrates
  DNA, RNA, lipids and proteins including histones, and generating S-adenosylhomocystine
  (SAH). SAH is catalyzed by SAH hydrolase to Hcy. One-carbon metabolism also interacts
  with the transsulfuration pathway and the methionine salvage pathway that is coupled
  with the polyamine synthesis. In the transsulfuration pathway, serine is required
  to divert Hcy for synthesis of cystathionine, and cystathionine is then catabolized
  into cysteine, the limiting factor for glutathione (GSH) production. Cysteine also
  provides substrate for the production of taurine and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). In
  the Met salvage pathway, SAM is decarboxylated to provide the supplaminopropyl groups
  to putrescine, supporting the polyamine synthesis. The byproduct 5′-methylthioadenosine
  (MTA) is salvaged back for SAM generation, with the initial step is catalyzed by
  MTA phosphorylase (MTAP). Other abbreviations: DNMT, DNA methyltransferase, HMT,
  histone methyltransferase, GNMT, glycine N-methyltransferase, PEMT, phosphatidylethanolamine
  N-methyltransferase, NNMT, nicotinamide N-methyltransferase.'
