caption: 'CX3CR1/ Fractalkine signalling—different roles in Microglia: In Alzheimer’s
  disease, chronic neuroinflammation increases the pro-inflammatory stimuli such as
  LPS, TNF-α and IL-6 in the CNS. Microglial cells, which are maintained at the resting
  stage under normal conditions, are activated by these pro-inflammatory stimuli by
  interacting through several surface receptors. Upon pro-inflammatory activation,
  microglia release excess of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the environment to activate
  more microglial cells to target the site of inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokine,
  IL-1β secreted from inflammatory microglia activates the TLR4 signalling pathway
  of neuronal cells and is involved in hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein by activating
  p38 MAP kinases. Fractalkine (CX3CL1), constitutively expressed neuronal protein,
  is either present as soluble or membrane-bound maintains the microglia in a quiescent
  stage. The pro-inflammatory TNF-α secretion by the microglial cells activates TNF
  receptors of neuronal cells and promotes the expression of fractalkine. Fractalkine
  interacts with CX3CR1 and activates Gi protein-mediated signalling pathway that
  activates nuclear transcription factors, NFκB and NRF2. CX3CR1/CX3CL1 activation
  also inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis and microglial activation. In
  AD conditions, misfolded Tau aggregated to form oligomers and filaments that spread
  across the CNS. Also, the extracellular Tau interacts with CX3CR1 for its internalization'
