caption: Neuregulins proteolytic cleavage pattern by BACE1. The enzymatic mapping
  shows that the cleavage of Nrg1 is mediated by BACE1 at between Glu-Phe and Met-Glu.
  Then, type I Nrg1 releases its N-terminal fragment to the extracellular space, in
  which the Nrg1-ntf binds to ErbB4 receptor on nearby cells. Whereas type III Nrg1
  was cleave by BACE1 remaining tethered on the lipid bilayer via its hydrophobic
  Cys-rich domain. The second may cut may occur by either BACE1 or ADAM10/17 cleavage
  and release the EGF-domain that signal through ErbB4 in adjacent glial cells. Nrg3
  was also cleaved by BACE1, producing the EGF-domain to activity its downstream pathway.
  The Nrg1-CTF was cleaved by γ-secretase in the cytosolic space, producing C-terminal
  peptide Nrg1-ICD that may regulate neuron development.
