caption: Mitofusin‐2 (Mfn2) regulatory pathway. Peroxisome proliferator‐activated
  receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC‐1α) and PGC‐1β are positive regulators of Mfn2
  activity. Mfn2 is induced by PGC‐1α in response to exercise, cold exposure or β3
  adrenergic agonists, whereas under basal conditions PGC‐1β activates Mfn2. This
  involves activation of the Mfn2 promoter through an estrogen‐related receptor α
  (ERRα)‐binding element.
