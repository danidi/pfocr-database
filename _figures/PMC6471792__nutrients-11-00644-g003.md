caption: 'Hypothetical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heterodimeric T1R2/T1R3 taste
  receptors exist in a multimeric receptor complex with NMBR, IRβ, and Neu-1 in naïve
  IR expressing cells. Here, TIR2/TIR3 dimeric receptors are proposed to exist as
  a molecular link regulating the interaction and signaling mechanism(s) between these
  molecules on the cell surface. This molecular model uncovers a biased TIR2/TIR3
  GPCR agonist-induced IRβ transactivation signaling axis, mediated by Neu-1 sialidase
  and modification of insulin receptor glycosylation. This novel biased GPCR-signaling
  platform potentiates neuraminidase-1 (Neu-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
  crosstalk on the cell surface that is essential for the activation of the insulin
  receptor β subunit (IRβ) tyrosine kinases. Notes: Insulin-binding receptor α subunits
  (IRα), as well as GPCR agonists, potentiate biased neuromedin B receptor (NMBR)-IRβ
  signaling and MMP-9 activation to induce Neu-1 sialidase. Activated MMP-9 is proposed
  here to remove the elastin-binding protein (EBP) as part of the molecular multienzymatic
  complex that contains β-galactosidase/Neu-1 and protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA).
  Activated Neu-1 hydrolyzes α-2,3 sialyl residues of IRβ at the ectodomain to remove
  steric hindrance to facilitate IRβ subunits association and tyrosine kinase activation.
  Activated phospho-IRβ subunits phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1),
  which initiate intracellular insulin signaling via the Ras-MAPK and the PI3K-Akt
  pathway, among others. Abbreviations: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GTP,
  guanine triphosphate; IRS1, insulin receptor substrate-1; p, phosphorylation; Neu-1,
  neuraminidase-1. Taken in part from Cellular Signalling 43 (2018) 71–84. © 2018
