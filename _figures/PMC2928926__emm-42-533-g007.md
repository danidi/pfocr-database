caption: Hypothetical scheme for the development of Th2 type asthma phenotypes. When
  allergens are inhaled, airway dendritic cells (DCs) present allergens to effector
  Th2 cells, which produce cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-13 (A). These cytokines
  induce lung infiltration of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils (eosinophilic
  inflammation), via chemokine actions (B). Recruited macrophages (M2 phenotype) and
  eosinophils produce TGF-β, which induces lung fibrosis and inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness
  (C). IL-13 also induces the production of IL-12 from DCs, possibly via IL-13Rα2-mediated
  signaling, and effector Th1 cells are generated via the IL-12-IL-12Rβ2-STAT4-mediated
  pathway (D). IFN-γ produced by effector Th1 cells induces lung infiltration of inflammatory
  cells other than eosinophils (non-eosinophilic inflammation) via chemokine actions
  (E). Recruited macrophages (M1 phenotype) produce mediators that inhibit the action
  of TGF-β, which results in the enhancement of airway hyperresponsiveness (F).
