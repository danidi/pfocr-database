caption: Proposed model for the relationship between NRF2-FOCAD-FAK signaling and
  cysteine deprivation-induced ferroptosis. Lots of components of the ferroptosis
  cascade, such as GPX4, SLC7A11, and AKR1B1, could be positively regulated by NRF2.
  In addition, NRF2 negatively regulated the transcription of FOCAD gene that was
  essential for the activity of FAK, and the suppression of FAK activity reduced the
  cellular sensitivity to cysteine (Cys) deprivation-induced ferroptosis via affecting
  the mitochondrial TCA cycle and the activity of Complex I in mitochondrial ETC.
