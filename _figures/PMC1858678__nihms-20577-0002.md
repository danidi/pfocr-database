caption: Signaling pathways downstream of adiponectin in cells of the cardiovascular
  system. Adiponectin has anti-inflammatory effects due to suppression of NFκB signaling
  in monocytes/macrophages and also reduces the progression of atherosclerotic lesions
  through suppression of NFκB in endothelial cells. In addition, adiponectin signals
  through the AMPK pathway to reduce endothelial cell apoptosis and to promote nitric
  oxide production. In the heart, adiponectin activates AMPK and decreases the hypertrophic
  response through suppression of protein synthesis. COX2 activation by adiponectin
  decreases expression of TNFα in the heart. Finally, adiponectin acts in smooth muscle
  cells to prevent atherosclerotic proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells.
