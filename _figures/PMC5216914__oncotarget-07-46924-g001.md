caption: The insulin receptor (IR) in the retina is constitutively phosphorylated
  (activation; A.). Activation of the IR is negatively regulated by PTP1B and Grb14.
  PTP1B directly dephosphorylates phosphate groups on the IR, while Grb14 directly
  binds to the active site of the IR and inactivates it B. The IR overcomes the inactivation
  by both PTP1B and Grb14 through the photobleaching of rhodopsin C., which activates
  a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, by an unknown mechanism D.. Src phosphorylates
  Grb14, and the phosphorylated Grb14 binds to the active site of the PTP1B and inactivates
  it E., thereby relieving the inhibitory constraints on the IR F.. Thus, the IR becomes
  active, and regulates the downstream effector cascade, which provides neuroprotection
  to the retina. IR, insulin receptor; P, phosphorylation; Pi, inorganic phosphate;
  Grb14, growth factor receptor bound-protein 14; Src, non-receptor tyrosine kinase
  Src; PTP1B, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B.
