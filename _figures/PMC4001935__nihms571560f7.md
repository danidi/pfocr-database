caption: FoxD3 is required for Sox10 and Snail2 expression (, ) in the gene regulatory
  network that drives neural crest specification (; ). In a separate pathway (grey
  arrow), FoxD3 promotes neural crest migration through its effects on Tspan18 (),
  repressing Tspan18 expression () and relieving Tspan18-dependent maintenance of
  Cad6B () that prevents EMT (). Snail2 likewise promotes EMT by directly repressing
  Cad6B () but does not affect Tspan18 expression (). Grey arrows, pathways; arrowhead,
  promotes expression; bar, represses expression; solid line, direct binding to target
  promoter demonstrated; dashed line, regulation not necessarily direct; wavy line,
  post-translational effect; box, developmental outcome.
