caption: The targets of 2-DG. Similar to glucose, 2-DG is taken up through GLUTs and
  then is phosphorylated by HK to form 2-DG-6-P, and 2-DG competitively inhibits GLUTs.
  2-DG-6-P cannot be further metabolized via glycolysis but accumulates in the cell
  and non-competitively inhibits HK and competitively inhibits PGI. NADPH generation
  is inhibited. Only one molecule of NADPH can be generated from the conversion of
  2-DG-6-P to 2-DG-6-phosphogluconolactone. 2-DG structurally resembles mannose and
  undergoes conversion into 2-DG-GDP, which interferes with the N-linked glycosylation
  of proteins. The inhibition of N-linked glycosylation induces the accumulation of
  unfold/misfolded proteins in the ER, resulting in ER stress and constant cell apoptosis.
  Intracellular glucose can promote glycosylation because its metabolic product F-6-P
  can be used in the mannose glycosylation pathway. However, upstream glucose metabolism
  is inhibited by 2-DG, which may not allow exogenous glucose to restore the interrupted
  N-linked glycosylation. GLUTs, glucose transporters; HK, hexokinase; PGI, phosphoglucose
  isomerase; G-6-PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; GDP, guanosine diphosphate;
  MCT, monocarboxylate transporter.
