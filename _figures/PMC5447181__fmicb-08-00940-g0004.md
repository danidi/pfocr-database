caption: KEGG Pathway for flagellar assembly in C. jejuni. Multiple genes responsible
  for flagellar assembly were observed to be upregulated in the gallbladder condition
  only; image depicts 24 h in the in vivo gallbladder environment (increased differential
  expression denoted by red highlight).
