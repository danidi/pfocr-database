caption: The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism produces neuroprotective
  as well as neurotoxic metabolites that can influence MS pathology. Neurotoxic metabolites
  are circled in red, and neuroprotective metabolites in green. Tryptophan (blue box)
  may be metabolized to serotonin and melatonin in multi-step sequential reactions,
  or alternatively is metabolized via the KP. This reaction is inhibited by 1-methyl
  tryptophan (1-MT) or berberine. Kynurenine (purple box) is the initial rate-limiting
  KP product of tryptophan metabolism by the enzymes indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1)
  and tryptophan dioxygenase (orange box). Kynurenine is then converted via kynurenine
  aminotransferases (KATI/II/III) to kynurenic acid, a neuroprotective molecule as
  it antagonizes glutamate receptor-induced neurotoxicity. 3-hydroxykynurenine is
  produced by further metabolism of kynurenine, for which evidence is accumulating
  of its neurotoxic capability. This reaction is inhibited by Ro61-8048 or nicotinylalanine.
  Leflunomide (Avara®) is an immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drug. Teriflunomide
  is the active metabolite of leflunomide. These kynurenine analogs are effective
  in reducing active lesions in both rodent models and in a phase II clinical trial
  (). Kynureninase catalyzes the conversion of 3-hydroxykynurenine to 3-hydroxyanthranilic
  acid. Tranilast is a synthetic anthracillic acid derivative drug with anti-inflammatory
  action (). Sequential conversion to 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-semialdehyde is the
  penultimate step leading to enzymatic production of (neuroprotective) picolinic
  acid, and the (non-enzymatic) production of the well-known neurotoxic compound quinolinic
  acid (QUIN). Further conversion of QUIN to the essential cofactor NAD+ is catalyzed
  by quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT). Dashed boxes indicate synthetic
  compounds, some of which are in drug development, that are derivatives of the KP
  metabolite described above.
