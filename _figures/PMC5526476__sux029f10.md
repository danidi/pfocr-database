caption: Mechanism of action of lomitapide and mipomersen. Lomitapide blocks the synthesis
  of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B (ApoB) by inhibiting the triglyceride
  microsomal transfer protein (MTP), the protein responsible for the transfer of triglycerides
  (TGs), phospholipids, and cholesterol esters to the ApoB in the endoplasmic reticulum;
  mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide that reduces the hepatic secretion of
  VLDL by binding messenger RNA encoding ApoB and preventing its transcription. Reproduced
  from Ahn and Choi.
