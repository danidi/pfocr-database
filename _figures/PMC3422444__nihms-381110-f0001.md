caption: MMR pathway plays the major role introducing A:T mutations during SHM in
  B-cells. The MutSα heterodimer composed of MSH2 and MSH6 recognizes the AID-generated
  U:G mismatch. This initiates a series of processes to create a ssDNA gap around
  the original AID-induced lesion, by recruiting scaffolding proteins (e.g. PCNA),
  nucleases (e.g. EXO1), and yet unknown factors and activities such as the instigation
  of nick-directed mismatch repair. Finally, the ssDNA patch is resynthesized through
  a complex cycle of DNA polymerization, which involves the recruitment of low-fidelity
  error-prone polymerases, like Polη and Polκ, as opposed to the use of canonical
  high-fidelity polymerases like Polδ and Polε. Post-translational modifications of
  PCNA, mainly through ubiquitylation, have been shown to play a role in regulating
  the usage of these polymerases and in orchestrating the decision between error-free
  and error-prone repair.
