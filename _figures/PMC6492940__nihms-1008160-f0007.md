caption: Cellular death signaling initiates apoptosis via two primary pathways. The
  primary mechanism is initiated by the activation of caspases, which are cysteine
  proteases whose action is typically regulated by proteins such as Inhibitor of Apoptosis
  (IAP) to avoid their improper or excessive activation[]. Caspases are either present
  in or move to mitochondria, where they induce apoptosis via both intrinsic and extrinsic
  mechanisms[, ]. Intrinsically, mitochondria become permeable and release cytochrome
  c (5.1), which forms apoptosomes (multi-protein complexes which initiate caspase
  activation leading to cell death) (5.2). Extrinsically, cell death is induced by
  factors which activate a death-inducing signaling complex formed by members of the
  death receptor family of apoptosis-inducing cellular receptors[]. Caspase activity
  can be imaged using a fluorescent sensor which consists of two fluorophores (chemical
  compounds which re-emit photons upon light excitation), namely a monomeric red fluorescent
  protein (mRFP) and an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) which are bound
  to each other by a caspase-sensitive link. As the caspase is activated, the sensor
  is cleaved, the eGFP translocates to the nucleus and the mRFP remains on the membrane,
  such that both fluorophores can be imaged using CM[]. In the secondary apoptotic
  pathway, caspase-independent apoptosis begins with the release of apoptosis-inducing
  factors (AIFs) (5.4) and of endogenous G (EndoG) (5.5) enzymes which migrate to
  the nucleus, where they degrade DNA[]. This migration is initiated via externalization
  of phosphatidyl serine (PS), which under normal circumstances lies on the inner
  membrane. PS externalization (5.3) precedes many apoptotic events, including membrane
  permeabilization and AIF activation[]. AIFs initiate their action by binding to
  chromatin (5.5) and by then causing its peripheral condensation and DNA fragmentation
  (5.6)[]. The process also involves overactivation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
  proteins, which can become highly active in cells with DNA damage (5.7), thereby
  causing ATP storage depletion quicker than recovery can occur, which results in
  cell death (5.8)[]. Estrogen effects upon the injured brain involve (i) estradiol
  binding to estrogen receptors (5.9), (ii) phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI-3K) activation
  (5.10) and (iii) activation of endogenous NO synthase (eNOS) to convert L-arginine
  into citrulline (5.11). NO is a by-product of this reaction. Estrogen also contributes
  to controlling apoptosis post-TBI by increasing B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) protein
  expression (5.12)[]. This prevents the pore forming function of Bcl-2 homology domain
  3 (BH-3) proteins (5.13) and the release of other apoptotic factors like bcl-2-like
  protein (BAX) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist killer (BAK) (5.14)[]. BAX/BAK downregulation
  reduces mitochondrion membrane permeabilization (5.15) and cytochrome c activation
  (5.16)[],[], followed by reduced binding of cytochrome c to apoptotic protease activating
  factor (APAF) (5.17) and to AIF downregulation (5.18)[]. Upregulation of estrogen
  results in an inhibitory effect upon GSK-3β, induced by Wnt signaling, via the removal
  of beta-catenin from the estrogen-receptor α-GSK-3β Beta-catenin complex (5.19)
  as well as via the activation of survival pathways in neurons[, ]. GSK-3β inhibition
  causes beta-catenin translocation into the nucleus (5.20), which then coordinates
  translation via T-cell factors and lymphoid-enhancer binding factors (5.21). Testosterone,
  conversely, is produced from cholesterol via steriodogenic acute regulatory protein
  (StAR) (5.22) which is then converted into estradiol through the action of aromatase
  (5.23)[], which is a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of estrogens. TSPO
  and StAR participate in homeostatic regulation of steroidogenesis, while enhanced
  expression of TSPO in microglia and astrocytes reflects inflammatory activation
  of these cells. However,18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) contributes to this process.
