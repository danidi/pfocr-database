caption: HVEM was originally identified as entry mediator of herpes virus. HVEM signaling
  is complex as it binds KIGHt as well as LTα3 and is further complicated as LIGHT
  besides binding HVEM also binds LTRβ. This complex receptor-ligand interactions
  as well as HSV-HVEM interplay culminate in the expression of of array of signaling
  molecules, type I IFNs etc.
