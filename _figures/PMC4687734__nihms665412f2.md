caption: 'Schematic pathway of the cyclooxygenase pathway showing conversion of arachidonic
  acid to prostanoids. The fatty acid arachidonic acid is released from the membrane
  phospholipids by several forms of phospholipase A2, which have previously been activated
  by one of a range of stimuli. The free arachidonic acid is converted to the cyclic
  endoperoxides prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin H2 by the sequential COX and HOX
  actions of PGHS-1 or PGHS-2; these isoforms both have dual COX and HOX activity.
  Aspirin inhibits the conversion of free arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 by
  inhibiting the COX activity of PGHS-1 or PGHS-2. Prostaglandin H2 is converted into
  a range of prostanoids by tissue-specific isomerases; therefore, the inhibition
  of this pathway prevents (or reduces) the downstream activation of a superfamily
  of G-protein-coupled receptors by these prostanoids. Prostacyclin binds to both
  a transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor and to PPARγ, a nuclear receptor. Abbreviations:
  ASA, acetylsalicylic acid; COX, cyclooxygenase; HOX, hydroperoxidase; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal
  anti-inflammatory drugs; PGHS, prostaglandin H synthase; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ.'
