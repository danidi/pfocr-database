caption: A proposed pathway illustrating how a mitochondria-targeted drug could affect
  cell survival based on supply and demand of energy generated in mitochondria. Induction
  of a mild mitochondrial stress induced by mitochondria-targeting agents inhibits
  energy consumption through elevation of AMPK phosphorylation and decreased ATP consumption.
  In neurons, cell survival is enhanced, whereas in cancer cells, proliferation is
  inhibited. Reprinted from Langley M, Ghosh A, Charli A et al. Mito-Apocynin Prevents
  Mitochondrial Dysfunction, Microglial Activation, Oxidative Damage, and Progressive
  Neurodegeneration in MitoPark Transgenic Mice. Antioxid Redox Signal. 2017; 27 (14):1048–1066.
