caption: . The dual roles of bone cell communication factors during bone remodeling.
  The forward Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) signaling
  pathway originating from osteoblasts is known to induce osteoclast differentiation,
  and reverse RANKL signaling from osteoclasts also induces osteoblast formation.
  Several in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that some bone cell communication
  factors, such as semaphorin 3A (SEMA3A), slit guidance ligand 3 (SLIT3), and collagen
  triple-helix repeat-containing 1 (CTHRC1), stimulate bone formation while suppressing
  bone resorption, and other factors, such as semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) and sclerostin,
  inhibit bone formation while increasing bone formation. The roles of these bone
  cell communication factors in both osteoclasts and osteoblasts offer a new strategy
  for the development of bone disease therapies.
