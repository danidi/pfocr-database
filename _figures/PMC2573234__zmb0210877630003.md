caption: The mitochondrial FAS II pathway in yeast. Acyl carrier protein (ACP) ()
  is depicted as a gray oval. Acetyl-CoA is converted to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA
  carboxylase (Hfa1) (). The malonyl moiety is transferred onto ACP by malonyl-CoA:ACP
  transferase (Mct1) (). Acetyl-CoA (ACP) and malonyl-ACP are condensed by 3-ketoacyl-ACP
  synthase (Cem1) to form 3-ketoacyl-ACP (). It is not known whether acetyl-CoA or
  acetyl-ACP is utilized in the initiating condensation reaction, which is denoted
  by dotted arrows. The reduction to 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP is catalyzed by 3-ketoacyl:ACP-reductase
  (Oar1) (). The dehydration reaction producing trans-2-enoyl-ACP is catalyzed by
  3-hydroxyacyl-thioester dehydratase (Htd2) (). Trans-2-enoyl-ACP is reduced by 2-enoyl
  thioester reductase (Etr1) (). The resulting acyl-ACP molecule is condensed with
  malonyl-ACP by Cem1, cyclically elongating the acyl chain by two carbon units to
  produce octanoic acid. It is unclear whether longer fatty acids are produced by
  the mitochondrial FAS II pathway in yeast. The letter “n” in the acyl chains signifies
  the number of cycles, with n = 0 representing the product of the initiating condensation
  reaction. Boldface C's denote the carbon atoms donated by malonyl-CoA in the most
  recent condensation reaction.
