caption: In unstimulated quiescent endothelial cells, p38/p-T199NPM/PP2a form a complex
  that is quickly dissociated in response to oxidative stress (ROS). This dissociation
  happens concomitantly with activated PP2a-mediated dephosphorylation of NPM at T199.
  Following dissociation of the complex, p38 phosphorylated in response to ROS exposure
  activates its downstream effectors notably HSP27 leading to actin reorganization
  in conjunction with the activation of the ERK/DAPK1/Tropomyosin 1α chain axis (see
  text). Moreover, a pool of NPM unphosphorylated at T199 translocates to the nucleus
  where it is associated with an impaired DDR due to impaired detection of DNA damage,
  as reflected by the inhibition of DNA-PK and ATM/ChK2. This may lead to genomic
  instability, apoptosis, senescence and thereby endothelial dysfunction. (Adapted
  from 56).
