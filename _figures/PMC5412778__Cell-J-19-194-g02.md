caption: Neural ectoderm and neural crest specification in deprivation of the external
  signals.A. In the lack of external Activin/Nodal and ERK signals, the expression
  of NANOG decreases in favor of SOX2 expression. SOX2 expression, in turn, activates
  SMAD interacting protein 1 (SIP1) which blocks mesendoderm differentiation and actively
  promotes expression of neuroectoderm specific genes - PAX6, OTX2 and GBX1, B. Neural
  crest (NC) determination occurs in two distinct steps that consist of neural plate
  border (NPB) and NC specification. NC specification occurs when the WNT molecule
  binds to its receptor Frizzled (FZ) and interacts with co-receptor LRP5/6, then
  these interactions can stabilizes β-ctnn by the canonical pathway. Activation of
  ERK by its phosphorylation downstream of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signals
  also contributes to glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) inhibition and indirectly
  assists with neural plate border determination by boosting the expression of the
  MSX1, PAX3, PAX7 and ZIC1 genes. Also, Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like
  domains 3 (Lrig3) indirectly inhibit ERK activation is required for induction of
  the neural plate border. BMP signals cooperativly contribute to specify the NPB
  cells towards functional migratory NC cells by inducing expressions of the SNAIL1,
  SOX9 and FOXD3 genes, and C. Summarizing intracellular signals required for self-renewal
  and maintenance of hPSCs and its early differentiation. The major intracellular
  signals for hPSCs self-renewal and other differentiated progenies are depicted.
  High and low arrows indicate the amount of each signal inside the cells. Important
  transcribed genes are also shown for each step. For example, in the epidermis, the
  level of expression and phosphorylation of SMAD1 is high. This type of cell expresses
  the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), marked by p63, cytokeratin14 and cytokeratin18
  gene expressions.
