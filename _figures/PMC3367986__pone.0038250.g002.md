caption: Arabidopsis flowering pathway depicted by Higgins et al. (2010)  was adapted
  for this study. Arabidopsis gene symbols are shown in upper box of each node along
  with the corresponding OG ID and the total number of soybean genes in the same OG.
  Only the soybean genes that are closer to the Arabidopsis flowering genes in each
  OG are listed in each node. Arabidopsis genes in grey shades are those that are
  not assigned with putative soybean orthologues. However, based on BLAST analysis
  these genes still have homologous soybean genes, the best matching soybean gene
  in BLAST analysis is shown below these genes. Dashed-lines were used for the arrows
  or T-bars that involve grey shades. Soybean genes marked with * are those that share
  the same clade with Arabidopsis genes but have not been investigated so far as flowering
  genes. OG IDs starting with ‘OG5_AT’ are arbitrarily generated in this study and
  do not exist in OrthoMCL 5.0 database. Other conventions are same as those used
  in the  by Higgins et al. (2010) . Arrows show promoting effects, T-bars show repressing
  effects. Environmental cues are shown as lower case letters in square boxes; ‘v’
  is extended cold (vernalization); ‘ld’ is long days; ‘sd’ is short days; ‘am’ is
  ambient (non-vernalizing) temperature. Genes are shown in italics and proteins in
  non-italics in ovals. ‘Pfr’ indicates Pfr phytochrome signaling. Arabidopsis genes
  assigned to specific pathways are color-coded (photoperiod pathway in green, vernalization
  in blue and autonomous pathway in purple). Flowering pathway integrators are shown
  in red. Triple headed arrows indicate activation by red or blue light.
