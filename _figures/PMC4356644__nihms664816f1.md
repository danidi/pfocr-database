caption: Two main chaperone systems, the lectins CNX/CRT (a) and the Hsp70 chaperone
  BiP (b), aid the folding proteins for secretion (c) or if folding fails, target
  them for ERAD (d). (a) The oligosaccharyl transfer (OST) complex attaches a core
  oligosaccharide from a dolichol donor to the Asn of the Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif on nascent
  proteins during their translocation into the ER. GlcI and II remove the outer two
  glucose residues of the oligosaccharide, allowing the remaining glucose to be recognized
  by CNX/CRT. CNX/CRT assists protein folding in concert with further co-chaperones
  such as the protein-disulfide isomerase ERp57. Proteins exit the CNX/CRT cycle once
  the last glucose residue is removed by GlcII. If folded properly, the protein is
  released from the lectin chaperone cycle and is transported further along the secretory
  pathway. Incompletely folded intermediates can re-enter the CNX/CRT cycle if a single
  glucose is re-attached by the folding sensor UGT. If folding ultimately fails, proteins
  are further trimmed by ERManI and/or an EDEM resulting in removal of 4 mannose residues
  and recognition by OS-9 and XTP3-B, which then transfer the trimmed glycoprotein
  to the ERAD machinery for disposal. (b) The Hsp70 chaperone BiP binds hydrophobic
  patches exposed on nascent or incompletely folded proteins that are often non-glycosylated.
  BiP possesses low substrate binding affinity in the ATP-bound state and high affinity
  upon hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. Grp170 and Sil1 facilitate substrate release from
  BiP by stimulating the release of ADP and allowing ATP to rebind and open the lid
  on the substrate binding domain. Seven ERdj co-factors have been identified that
  interact with BiP via their J-domain and assist BiP in its functions during protein
  translocation (ERdj2), protein folding (ERdj3 and 6) and ERAD (ERdj4 and 5). The
  functions of ERdj1 and ERdj7 are not well understood, nor is the role of the large
  Hsp70, Grp170, that also binds to some incompletely folded BiP client proteins.
  (c) Once the threshold of folding set by the ERQC is met, proteins exit the ER in
  COPII-coated vesicles, a process that is initiated by Sec12 and driven by a GTPase,
  Sar1, and four major coat proteins, Sec23, Sec24, Sec13 and Sec31. (d) Once proteins
  that are clients of either chaperone system are delivered to the ERAD machinery,
  their retrotranslocation into the cytosol is facilitated by a complex of several
  transmembrane proteins including Sel1, Derlins, VIMP, Herp and Hrd1, which connect
  the machinery in the ER lumen to the protein ubiquitination machinery in the cytosol,
  allowing the ERAD client to be recognized by the p97 hexameric ATPase in the cytosol
  that provides the energy for extracting a protein from the ER for degradation by
  the 26S proteasome.
