caption: The working model. In Drosophila ovarian stem cell niche, cap cells produce
  several signaling molecules including Dpp and Wnts. Dpp promotes GSC self-renewal
  by activating downstream (indicated by pMad). Wnts function in ECs via the canonical
  signaling pathway to promote Tkv expression, which in turn removes excess of cap
  cell–produced Dpp independent of the canonical Dpp signaling pathway and prevents
  Dpp activity outside the niche. Thus, the Drosophila GSC niche helps to define its
  own niche activity.
