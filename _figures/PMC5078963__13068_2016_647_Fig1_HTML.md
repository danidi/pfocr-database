caption: Biosynthetic pathway of fatty alcohol in Yarrowia lipolytica and Lipomyces
  starkeyi. The yellow-shaded pathway from fatty acyl-CoA to fatty alcohol indicates
  the engineered steps for the fatty alcohol synthesis described in this work. ACC
  acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ACL ATP citrate lyase; G3P glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; DGA
  diacylglycerolacyltransferase; DHAP dihydroxyacetone phosphate; F-6-P fructose 6-phosphate;
  FAS fatty acid synthase; G-6-P glucose 6-phosphate; LPA lysophosphatidic acid; MaFAR
  fatty acid reductase of Marinobactor aquaeolei VT8; OAA oxaloacetate; PD pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; PL phospholipid; Pyr pyruvate; TAG triacylglycerol. The diagram is
  based on summary views of lipid biosynthesis in the recent literature described
  in the text of this paper
