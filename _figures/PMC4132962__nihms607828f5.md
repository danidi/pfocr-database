caption: a, The proposed model of protective (blue) and pathogenic (red) effects of
  lipid antigen presentation in intestinal inflammation. Bone-marrow-derived antigen-presenting
  cells (APCs) contribute to oxazolone colitis in a CD1d- and iNKT-cell-dependent
  manner. By contrast, engagement of intestinal epithelial CD1d elicits protective
  functions through cytoplasmic CD1d tail-dependent activation of STAT3, and STAT3-dependent
  transcription of Cd1d1, Il10 and Hsph1. Epithelial IL-10 and HSP110 support this
  protective self-reinforcing pathway through STAT3-dependent signalling. Interference
  with any of the elements involved in this regulatory pathway (MTP, CD1d, IL-10 or
  HSP110) is associated with uncontrolled intestinal inflammation, thus highlighting
  a critical role of this pathway in the control of intestinal inflammation. Conv.,
  conventional. b, Overview of experimental procedures.
