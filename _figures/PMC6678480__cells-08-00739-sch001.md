caption: The mechanism by which alantolactone (Ala) suppresses neuroinflammation.
  Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates a classical inflammatory pathway in microglia
  by inducing the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa
  light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathways. Ala inhibits
  the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and extracellular signal-related
  kinases (ERKs) in the MAPK pathway and thus prevents the downstream protein AP-1
  from translocating to the nucleus. By inhibiting the degradation of IκBα, Ala also
  prevents p65 from translocating to the nucleus. Ultimately, this activity attenuates
  the expression of proinflammatory factors and prevents activated microglia from
  damaging neurons. In short, Ala could play a therapeutic role in neuroinflammation.
