caption: The transduction pathways activated by recombinant somatostatin sst2(a) or
  sst2(b) receptor isoforms and proposed mechanism which determines the proliferative
  fate of the host cell. G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases
  stimulate mitogenesis in part via ERKs, which are members of the MAP kinase family.
  It is becoming evident that many of the same intermediates as those utilized by
  the receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in the mechanism of ERK activation by
  G-protein-coupled receptors. For example, ERK1 and ERK2 are regulated by Gi-coupled
  receptors through a Ras-dependent pathway by stimulating the recruitment of the
  guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS, into a plasma membrane-associated signaling
  complex, where it activates Ras by catalyzing GTP-for-GDP exchange. This recruitment
  is the consequence of receptor-mediated stimulation of tyrosine protein kinases,
  which phosphorylate adapter proteins including Shc, followed by the Grb-2-mediated
  docking of SOS to the plasma membrane. Considerable evidence supports the role of
  the Src family kinases in the Gi-mediated stimulation of ERK1 and ERK2 through a
  mechanism dependent on Gβγ release. Activation of the other MAP kinase pathways,
  such as p38, also involves a cascade of kinases downstream from Ras family members
  such as Rac, but little is known about the mechanism by which G-protein-coupled
  receptors activate these alternative signaling pathways. The proliferative response
  mediated via the sst2(b) receptor requires a sustained activation of ERK1 and ERK2
  that is βγ sensitive. However, the proliferative effect is additionally dependent
  on a parallel and distinct PI 3-K pathway, which is also mediated by βγ release.
  Substrates of PI 3-K such as p70rsk, important for protein synthesis and cell cycle
  progression, and Akt, which affords protection against apoptotic processes, are
  both phosphorylated by activated sst2(b) receptors. The sustained activation of
  ERK mediated by the sst2(a) receptor, together with a βγ-dependent prolonged activation
  of p38, which activates the transcription factor ATF-2, is required to inhibit the
  cell growth induced by bFGF. Amplification of these MAP kinase cascades by the cooperative
  effects of the bFGF and sst2(a) receptors enables the induction of p21cip1, which
  interacts with cyclin-dependent kinases associated with cyclins A, D1, D2, D3, and
  E to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinase activity and thus block cell cycle progression.
