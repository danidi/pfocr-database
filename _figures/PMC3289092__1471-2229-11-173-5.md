caption: Proposed model of SND2-mediated SCW regulation in IFs. Solid lines indicate
  known direct protein-DNA interactions. Dashed lines indicate direct or indirect
  protein-DNA interactions. Master regulator SND1 is activated by a signal transduction
  pathway proposed by Oikawa et al. [] (a). SND1 directly activates transcription
  of MYB103 and SND3 (b), and indirectly activates SND2 through an unknown intermediate
  (c; []). SND2 activates cellulose-synthesizing CesAs, either directly (d) or through
  the activation of MYB103 (e), which is known to activate SCW cellulose gene, CesA8
  []. SND2 regulates hemicellulosic genes (f; Table 1), independently to a similar
  role played by direct SND1 targets MYB46, MYB83 or C3H14 [-]. SND2 plays a role
  in lignification through activation of lignin polymerization genes LAC4 and LAC17
  (g; Table 1), but it does not regulate monolignol biosynthetic genes as is the case
  for MYB58, MYB63 and MYB85 (h) [,]. SND2 activates transcription of GPI-anchored
  FLA11/FLA12, CTL2 and other components of the signal transduction pathway (i), which
  leads to upregulation of SND1 (a).
