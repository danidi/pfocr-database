caption: Model showing the effects of the RelA T505A mutation. In WT mice, tissue
  damage and hepatocyte loss leads to compensatory wound healing and cell proliferation.
  We propose that, as a consequence of this, DNA replication stress will lead to checkpoint
  kinase activation and Chk1-mediated phosphorylation of RelA at Thr505 (although
  other kinases could also perform this role). This in turn results in suppression/modulation
  of RelA transcriptional activity. However, in RelA T505A mice this pathway is defective,
  meaning that RelA is not subject to checkpoint kinase regulation, leading to an
  enhanced proliferative response and other effects, resulting in earlier onset of
  hepatocellular carcinoma.
