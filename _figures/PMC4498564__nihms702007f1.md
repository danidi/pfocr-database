caption: 'The heme biosynthetic pathway. Reactions shown above the dashed line take
  place in the mitochondrion, whereas those below this line occur in the cytosol.
  At every step of the pathway, corresponding porphyria from the respective deficient
  enzyme is mentioned in italics and in rectangles. ALAS, aminolevulinic acid synthase;
  EPP, erythropoietic protoporphyria; ALAD, ALA dehydratase; ADP, ALAD-deficient porphyria;
  PBGD, porphobilinogen deaminase; AIP, acute intermittent porphyria; UROS, uroporphyrinogen
  III synthase; CEP, congenital erythropoietic porphyria; UROD, uroporphyrinogen III
  decarboxylase; PCT, porphyria cutanea tarda; CPO, coproporphyrinogen oxidase; HCP,
  hereditary coproporphyria; PPO, protoporphyrinogen oxidase; VP, variegate porphyria;
  FECH, ferrochelatase. Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria is the result of autosomal
  recessive UROD mutation with severe deficiency of UROD in liver and RBCs and causes
  the same phenotype as PCT with onset of disease in childhood. *ALAS, rate-limiting
  enzyme in heme biosynthesis has 2 isoforms: ALAS-1 is the general form present in
  all cells, and ALAS2 is the erythroid-specific variant present only in RBCs. †X-linked
  EPP is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in ALAS2. EPP is also caused by mutations
  in FECH.'
