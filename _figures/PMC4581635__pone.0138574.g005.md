caption: Pathway studio is utilized for finding common molecular connections between
  the proteins/transcription factors encoded by the expressed probe sets. This software
  analyses through the ResNet database for all known interactions between genes/proteins
  such as regulation and their expression. Each arrow indicates interactions between
  genes and a cell process pathway.
