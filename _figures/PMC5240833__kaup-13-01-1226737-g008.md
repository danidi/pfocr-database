caption: Genes and pathways governing D. discoideum vacuolar cell death. The cascade
  of subcellular cell death events is schematically depicted (middle). These include
  the formation of “paddle” cells, following by their rounding, biogenesis of a cellulose
  shell and extensive vacuolization. Random insertional mutagenesis and targeted mutagenesis
  identified a number of genes, here shown in green letters, encoding molecules required
  for this cell death. Details are given in the main text. These genes in turn helped
  define pathways to cell death, such as a polysaccharide pathway (right), a first
  signal pathway induced by starvation and cAMP (lower left) and second signal pathways
  (upper left). The latter include a DIF-1-induced autonomous pathway and a c-di-GMP
  pathway requiring endogenously synthesized or exogenous DIF-1. Ca2+-related drugs
  such as thapsigargin and BAPTA affect DIF-1 signaling leading to cell death.
