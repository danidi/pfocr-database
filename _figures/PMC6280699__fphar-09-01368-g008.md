caption: 'Proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of IFN-β in CF: (A) IFN-β
  triggers JAK/STATsignaling pathway activation (STAT1, STAT3, and STAT3 proteins).
  (1) IFN-β induces a pro-inflammatory response in the CF through STAT1 protein activation
  (green arrows), characterized by increased expression of the chemokines IP-10 and
  MCP-1, as well as (2) increased neutrophil migration, favored by chemokines released
  from CF.'
