caption: The stalling of replication forks is sensed as replication stress and leads
  to the exposure of ssDNA, which is recognized by RPA. In response to replication
  stress, the ATR/Chk1 pathway inhibits Cdc25 in order to establish the G2/M checkpoint
  and prevent mitotic entry. In addition, the formation of GMGs is induced upon replication
  stress in late G2 and prophase nuclei. GMGs represent assemblies of TIAR together
  with components of the transcription, splicing, and replication machineries, possibly
  reflecting active transcription at sites of stalled replication. TIAR retains CDK1
  in GMGs and contributes to CDK1 inhibition during G2/M checkpoint activation. APH,
  DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin; ATR inhibitor ATRi (ETP‐46464); Chk1 inhibitors
  Go6976 and UCN‐01 (UCN).
