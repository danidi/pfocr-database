caption: Influence of aphid infestation on the leaf content of amino acids and sugars.
  Bar charts indicate the relative concentrations of amino acids and sugars altered
  significantly in abundance in leaves in response to aphid infestation and refer
  to antisense TAO, wild-type (WT), and sense PAO plants as indicated. Black bars
  indicate concentration in the absence of aphids, and white bars indicate concentration
  in the presence of aphids; data are represented as means ± se (n = 3). The figure
  indicates compartmentation and metabolic relationships between different compounds,
  and presumed transporters are indicated as purple circles. 3-PGA, 3-Phosphoglycerate;
  TP, triose phosphates; E4P, erythrose-4-phosphate; C5, five-carbon Calvin pathway
  intermediates; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pyr, pyruvate; AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; OAA,
  oxaloacetate; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; GABA, γ-aminobutyrate; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.
  Amino acids are indicated according to their standard three-letter abbreviations.
