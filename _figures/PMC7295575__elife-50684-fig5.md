caption: Activation of Piezo1 channel by mechanical force (e.g. fluid flow) or chemical
  agonist (Yoda1) causes elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration which stimulates
  enzymatic activity of ADAM10 to cause S2 and S3 Notch1 cleavage and release of NICD
  to drive target gene expression that includes increased expression of Hes1, Dll4,
  Hey1, HeyL, Jag1, Hes2, Hes3 and Efnb2 in hepatic vasculature of the mouse. In the
  schematic we also include the suggested contributions from ADAM10/Notch1/NICD independent
  signalling from Piezo1 and non-canonical Notch1 signalling via the Notch1 transmembrane
  domain (TMD), as described and referenced in the text.
