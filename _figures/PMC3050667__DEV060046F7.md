caption: Model of a Slit/miR-218/Robo axis that regulates Vegf signaling and endocardial
  migration. Slit2 inhibits the migration of the endocardium to the midline through
  a combination of negative regulation of the Vegf signaling pathway and Slit/Robo-mediated
  repulsion signals. During midline migration, the endocardium is likely to sense
  Slit2 secreted by the floor plate; however, autocrine signaling may also play a
  role in endocardial migration. The identity of the Slit2 receptor(s) that mediates
  the negative regulation of Vegf signaling is unclear as this effect appears to be
  at least partly Robo4 independent. The Slit2/3-encoded microRNA miR-218 targets
  Robo1 (and Robo2 and Srgap2, not shown) for repression. Robo1 positively regulates
  endocardial migration, perhaps by promoting the auto-phosphorylation of Vegfr2.
  However, increased Robo1 expression in miR-218 morphants may mediate Slit/Robo-mediated
  repulsion, suggesting that miR-218 might titrate the levels of Robo1 to facilitate
  heart field migration.
