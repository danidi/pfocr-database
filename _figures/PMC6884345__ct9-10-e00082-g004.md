caption: TGFB signaling in the colonic mucosa. Following injury to the epithelial
  barrier, activity of matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) is increased. TGFB is bound
  in a latent form in the extracellular matrix. MMPs degrade the collagen matrix,
  also releasing and activating TGFB (). The canonical TGFB pathway involves activation
  of membrane-bound TGFB receptors 1 and 2, which phosphorylates SMAD 2/3 and together
  with SMAD4 before translocating to the nucleus (). TGFB promotes recruitment and
  differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, increasing production of collagen
  and TIMPs. Caveolin 1, a glycoprotein in the cell membrane, inhibits this signaling
  by internalizing the TGFB receptors (). TIMP, tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidase.
