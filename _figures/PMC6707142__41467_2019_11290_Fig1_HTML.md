caption: Engineering an orthogonal monoterpene biosynthetic pathway in yeast. The
  native yeast isoprenoid biosynthesis includes pathways responsible for the synthesis
  of sterols, dolichols, ubiquinone, as well as protein prenylation. Production of
  monoterpenoids in yeast has so far been based on utilizing the GPP synthesized as
  an intermediate in primary isoprenoid metabolism. This GPP-based non-orthogonal
  pathway (shown in gray) connects back to primary metabolism through the Erg20p-catalyzed
  conversion of GPP to FPP. Expression of SlNPPS1 in yeast cells enables the synthesis
  of the cis-isomer of GPP, NPP, which cannot be converted to FPP and links back to
  the biosynthesis of yeast isoprenoids. NPP can be utilized by engineered monoterpene
  synthases to produce different monoterpenes. The NPP-based pathway, depicted in
  green, is orthogonal to the yeast metabolism, because it branches out from the main
  pathway only at one point, following the synthesis of IPP and DMAPP. This branch
  point creates a metabolic valve, depicted here using the engineering symbol for
  a three-point valve, which can be regulated to direct fluxes to the desired products.
  This valve can be controlled dynamically to regulate fluxes between the two branches.
  We installed dynamic regulation by introducing the ergosterol-repressed promoter
  of the ERG1 gene upstream of the ERG20 gene. This valve diverts fluxes to the orthogonal
  branch when sterol levels increase. TPS terpene synthase, CYPs cytochrome P450 enzymes,
