caption: 'Schematic of the potential role of MuRF1 in atrophy induced gene expression
  pathways. A: DEN-induced gene expression. DEN induces HDAC4 expression leading to
  increased MYOG expression, which then at least partly induces MuRF1. In turn, MuRF1
  expression is necessary to support maximal HDAC4 and MYOG expression. Blunted HDAC4
  expression in MuRF1 KO mice may result in decreased inhibition of MEF2c and its
  downstream contractile protein and metabolic enzyme gene targets. Blunted MYOG induction
  in MuRF1 KO mice may also lead to the subsequent blunted induction of genes linked
  to the neuromuscular junction, such as embryonic acetylcholine receptor subunits.
  Denervation also induces FOXO transcription factor expression that in parallel regulate
  MuRF1; unlike the HDAC4/MYOG pathway, FOXO induction appears to be independent of
  MuRF1 expression in this context. B: DEX-induced gene expression. DEX binding to
  the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) suppresses the activity of AP-1 that regulates
  genes encoding extracellular matrix (ECM) components like specific collagens, but
  in a MuRF1-independent manner. DEX-bound GRs also directly induce MuRF1 and FOXO
  transcription factors, which also target MuRF1; in turn MuRF1 is required for sustained
  DEX-induced FOXO (specifically FOXO1) expression. In addition, MuRF1 is required
  for full induction of specific genes encoding key cell signaling proteins such as
  the alpha regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK3R1) or enzymes
  involved in fat storage or metabolism, such as patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing
  protein 3 (PNPLA3, or adiponutrin). Induction of other direct GR target genes like
  FK506 binding protein 5 and the metallothionein 1 and 2 genes is unaffected by MuRF1
  in this context, which is not shown in the schematic. COL1A2 and COL15A1, collagen
  1A2 and collagen 15A1, respectively. Lines with arrowheads, activation of gene expression
  or transcription factor activity; lines with blunted ends, inhibition of gene expression
  or transcription factor activity. Factors in parentheses (MEF2c, AP-1) were not
  directly assayed for the influence of MuRF1 after DEN or DEX treatment.'
