caption: Proposed platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM1) and Src signaling
  pathway activation in ARDS and in ventilator-induced lung injury. The combined effects
  of inflammatory mediators and repetitive opening and closing of alveoli during mechanical
  ventilation inflict shear stress on the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillary
  blood vessels. The resultant mechanical force is transmitted through cytoskeletal
  elements to sites of cell-to-cell adhesion, where a transmembrane protein, known
  as PECAM1, responds by activating downstream signaling pathways, including those
  involving Src and signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3). The
  STAT-3 transcription factor may play a role in initiating the inflammatory response
  seen in ventilator-induced lung injury.
