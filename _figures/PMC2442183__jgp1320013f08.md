caption: Indirect (classical) and direct (novel) mechanisms of PIP2 action on BK currents.
  Activated PLC via Gq, determined by either ligand binding to a Gq-coupled receptor
  (GPCR) or constitutive activity, cleaves PIP2 into PIP3, IP3, and DAG. IP3 releases
  Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), raising Ca2+i, whereas DAG activates
  PKC in the presence of Ca2+. BK channel modulation by PKC and Ca2+i controls the
  degree of vascular myocyte contraction. Therefore, by generating DAG and IP3, PIP2
  indirectly modulates BK channels and, thus, vascular tone. We demonstrate that PIP2
  itself and other membrane phosphoinositides directly activate BK channels, that
  is, in the absence of cell integrity or organelles or in the continuous presence
  of cytosolic messengers. This activation involves the negative charges of the phosphoinositide
  headgroup and the sequence of positive residues RKK in the cbv1 S6–S7 cytosolic
  linker. However, PIP2 activation is drastically and distinctly amplified by the
  channel accessory subunit of the β1 type, which is abundantly expressed in smooth
  muscle. In intact myocytes, inhibition of PLC by U73122 increases paxilline-sensitive
  BK currents in the presence of a PI3 kinase blocker (wortmannin), PKC inhibitor
  (Ro 31-8220), and a selective blocker of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase
  (thapsigargin). Under these conditions, PLC inhibition increases membrane PIP2 (),
  which leads to increased BK current in the intact cell (see main text).
