caption: A schematic view of PPR-induced pathways involved in stimulation of NFκB
  and MAPK signaling. TLRs (TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR7 and TLR9) do activate
  IKK and MAPK modules by binding of MyD88 to the receptor TIR domain and subsequently
  triggering IRAK, TRAF6 and TAK1. Alternatively, TIRAP (TIR domain-containing adaptor
  protein), a second TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein, is involved in the MyD88-dependent
  signaling pathway through TLR2 and TLR4. A third TIR-domain-containing adaptor,
  TRIF (TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFNβ), is essential for the
  MyD88-independent pathway. Further, the non-typical IKKs IKKε and TBK1 [TRAF-family-member-associated
  NFκB activator (TANK)-binding kinase 1] mediate activation of IRF3 downstream of
  TRIF. A fourth TIR-domain containing adaptor, TRAM (TRIF-related adaptor molecule),
  is specific to the TLR4-mediated, MyD88-independent/TRIF-dependent pathway. By contrast,
  activation of NLRs leads to the recruitment of the receptor-interacting protein
  2 (RIP2) kinase, which is essential for the activation of the IKK complex. In addition,
  activation of NOD1 leads to JNK stimulation. Finally, double strand DNA has been
  linked to inflammasome activation. This protein complex, which is composed of NLRs
  of the NALP-family and adaptor-proteins apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  (ASC), mediates the generation of IL-1β through cleavage of its precursor by caspase-1.
  Upon IKK complex activation, NFκB is freed and consequently translocate to the nucleus
  where it can bind to the promoter of its targeted genes. Similarly, once activated,
  ERK, JNK and p38 kinase translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate their
  respective transcription factors and therefore modulated gene expression. TLRs are
  connected to the PI3K/Akt pathway. Indeed, depending of the TLRs and the cells,
  PI3K has been shown to modulate transcription factor activities and cytokine production.
  Up to date, the molecular link between TLRs and PI3K are still unknown.
