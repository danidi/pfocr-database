caption: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetically heterogeneous disorder
  caused by mutations in several genes in the TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway. BMP9 binds
  to specific type I (R-I; namely ALK1) and type II (R-II) cell surface receptors
  that exhibit serine/threonine kinase activity, as well as to the auxiliary receptor
  endoglin. Upon ligand binding, the R-II transphosphorylates ALK1 (R-I), which then
  propagates the signal by phosphorylating receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) Smad1/5/8.
  Once phosphorylated, R-Smads form heteromeric complexes with Smad4 and translocate
  into the nucleus where they regulate transcriptional activity of target genes, including
  Id1. Endoglin, ALK1, BMP9, and Smad4 proteins are encoded by ENG, ACVRL1, GDF2,
  and SMAD4, whose pathogenic mutations give rise to HHT and JP/HHT, respectively.
