caption: The TORC1-Greatwall-PP2AB55δpathway and its associated factors in S. cerevisiae.
  Increased Sfp1p-targeted gene expression and decreased Gln3p-, Gat1p-, Gcn4p-, and
  Msn2/4p-targeted gene expression were observed in sake yeast cells, suggesting high
  TORC1 activity. TORC1, target of rapamycin complex 1; PP2AB55δ, protein phosphatase
  2A complexed with a regulatory subunit B55δ; SEACIT, Seh1p-associated protein complex
  inhibiting TORC1; PKA, protein kinase A; NCR, nitrogen catabolite repression; GAAC,
  general amino acid control.
