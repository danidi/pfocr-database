caption: Molecular players involved in the NRF1 pathway. This model depicts our current
  understanding of the Nrf1 pathway. During biosynthesis, Nrf1 p120 is inserted into
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane via the Sec61 pathway in a type II (Clumen/Ncytosol)
  orientation. The domains close to the C-terminus of p120 are glycosylated in the
  ER lumen. Under unperturbed conditions, p120 is ubiquitinated by HRD1, retrotranslocated
  by the action of ATPase p97, deglycosylated by NGLY1, and degraded by the proteasome.
  When the proteasome is inhibited, retrotranslocated p120 is deglycosylated and additionally
  cleaved by the protease DDI2 and the active fragment p110 migrates to the nucleus
  to induce transcription of proteasome subunit (PSM) genes. The activity of Nrf1
  p110 in the nucleus is influenced by cofactors such as small Maf (sMaf) proteins,
  TIP60, FBW7α, GSK3, β-TrCP, and USP15. Although CK2 is depicted in the nucleus,
  the compartment where it phosphorylates NRF1 is currently unclear. Details and references
  are provided in the text.
