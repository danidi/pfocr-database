caption: LPA metabolism, KLHL and KCNE3 as novel EMT controller genes. Schematic pathway
  representation of controller genes involved in the induction (blue) and in the inhibition
  (red) of EMT in AEC cell model. Moreover, biosynthetic (blue arrows) and degradative
  (red arrows) LPA pathways are showed. KLHL14 is hypothetically represented in a
  complex with Nfr2, as its homologous protein KLHL19. LPC, lysophosphatidilcoline;
  LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; iLPA, intracellular LPA; ATX, autotaxin; LPAR, LPA receptor;
  LPP, lipid phosphate phosphatases; PDL, phospholipase D; PLA2, phospholipase A2;
  PC, phosphatidylcholine; PA, phosphatidic acid; MAG, monoacylglycerol; DAG, diacylglycerol;
  KLHL14, kelch-like protein 14; Nrf2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2;
  GST, Glutathione S-transferase; NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase. See the text
  for more details.
