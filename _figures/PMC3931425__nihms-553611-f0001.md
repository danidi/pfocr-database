  See text for references.* and  show that the protein patterns observed by 2D- and
  1D-gel electrophoresis in activated eggs are regulated by CaMKII and attribute these
  changes to maternal mRNA recruitment and protein synthesis. However, it can not
  be ruled out that some of the observed changes are due to post-translational modifications.
  As such, we have placed “proteome changes” in the pathway to encompass both of these
  possibilities.
