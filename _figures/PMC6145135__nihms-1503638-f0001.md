caption: Development of a spontaneous antitumor response and a T cell–inflamed tumor
  microenvironment. Antigen presenting cells take up tumor-derived DNA. Cytosolic
  DNA activates the STING pathway, resulting in the production of type I interferons
  and recruitment and activation of Batf3-lineage DCs that express CD8α or CD103.
  In turn, an innate immune cascade is initiated leading to antigen presentation,
  cross-priming in the tumor-draining lymph nodes, and eventually recruitment of CD8+
  T cells to the tumor microenvironment. Tumor antigen-specific T cells are recruited
  by the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10. If the tumor is not eliminated, then T cells
  become dysfunctional and PD-L1 upregulation by tumor cells and immune-infiltrating
  cells is observed. The resulting adaptive immune response is damped by this counter-regulation,
  which is characteristic of a T cell–inflamed tumor microenvironment.
