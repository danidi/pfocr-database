caption: '(T)cell-inflamed and non-(T)cell-inflamed phenotypes. (A) T cell-inflamed
  phenotype. CD8α+and/or CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) are sensing the tumor and upon
  stimulation through STING pathway activation, type I interferons are produced. These
  activated DCs migrate to lymph nodes to prime tumor antigen-specific T cells. Activated
  T cells are recruited back into the tumor microenvironment via CXCL9 and CXCL10
  chemokines. Upon tumor infiltration and encounter with antigen, T cells produce
  IFNγ which leads to the upregulation of immune inhibitory mechanisms including PD-L1
  and IDO, and also to produce chemokines that recruit regulatory T cells. (B) Non-T
  cell-inflamed phenotype. In this scenario the tumor microenvironment is lacking
  activated T cells, which could potentially be caused by 4 independent mechanisms
  (indicated by the indicated STOPs): (1) Lack of DC recruitment, (2) Lack of innate
  immune activation within DCs (3) Lack of adequate priming of antitumor T cells,
  or (4) Lack of trafficking of activated T cells into the tumor site. Despite lacking
  T cells, this phenotype still contains tumor-associated macrophages.'
