caption: Hypothesized mechanism for GBA-associated lysosomal dysfunction in Parkinson
  disease. (A) In a normally functioning lysosome, GBA is associated with the inner
  part of the lysosomal membrane, and degrades glucocerebrosides to glucose and ceramide,
  thus controlling the proper composition of the membrane. The chaperone-mediated
  autophagy receptor, LAMP2A, is able to freely move out of lipid rafts, create complexes,
  and internalize SNCA into the lysosome for degradation. (B) Impaired GBA activity
  can affect the composition of the membrane, leading to an increased density of lipid
  rafts on the lysosomal membrane. In this scenario, it is more difficult for LAMP2A
  to create the complexes required for the internalization of SNCA into the lysosome,
  leading to SNCA accumulation. This effect of GBA impairment on the lysosomal membrane
  may interrupt other pathways, and affect macroautophagy and mitophagy, which will
  lead to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and increased oxidative stress.
