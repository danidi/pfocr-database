caption: 'Heparanase triggers multiple pathways that drive myeloma progression. (1)
  Enhanced expression of heparanase by myeloma cells: augments gene transcription
  by enhancing acetylation of histones, stimulates exosome biogenesis by trimming
  the heparan sulfate chains of syndecan-1 thereby priming formation of the syndecan-syntenin-ALIX
  complex, downregulates CXCL10 causing increased tumor cell proliferation and activates
  ERK via the insulin signaling pathway resulting in enhanced expression of MMP-9
  and VEGF. (2) Shedding of syndecan-1 from the myeloma surface is driven by the heparanase-mediated
  trimming of heparan sulfate and by the increase in MMP-9 secretion. The shed syndecan-1
  complexes with VLA-4 and VEGFR2 on the tumor cell surface stimulating Rac signaling
  and resulting in cell migration/invasion. (3) Via the same mechanism as in tumor
  cells, shed syndecan-1 initiates Rac signaling in endothelial cells that promotes
  angiogenesis. Increased angiogenesis also occurs when angiogenic growth factors
  (VEGF, HGF) bound to shed syndecan-1 heparan sulfate chains activate receptors on
  endothelial cells and when exosomes bearing VEGF, HGF and heparanase cargo dock
  with endothelial cells. (4) Similarly, HGF bound to shed syndecan-1 activates the
  cMet receptor on osteoblasts that via an IL-11 feedback mechanism increases RANKL
  secretion leading to osteoclast activation and osteolysis. (5) Myeloma cells having
  elevated heparanase expression exhibit resistance to commonly used anti-myeloma
  drugs, including proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib, carfilzomib) and the alkylating

  blocks the multiple pathways that are stimulated by heparanase (e.g., syndecan shedding,
  angiogenesis) resulting in decreased drug resistance and inhibition of myeloma growth
