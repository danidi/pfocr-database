caption: Compartmentalization of the β-oxidation pathway and the glyoxylate cycle.
  The enzymes of the β-oxidation (see ) as well as key enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle
  are localized to peroxisomes in S. cerevisiae. In addition to the β-oxidation enzymes,
  three peroxisomal membrane-associated proteins are required for fatty acid oxidation
  in peroxisomes, namely the ABC transporter Pxa1/Pxa2 for the import of long-chain
  acyl-CoA, Faa2 for the activation of medium chain FAs, and the transporter Ant1
  for import of ATP. The glyoxylate cycle converts two acetyl-CoA molecules into succinate
  and contributes to the export of acetyl-CoA that is produced in the β-oxidation
  cycle. Glyoxylate and the first acetyl-CoA molecule are condensed by malate synthase
  (Mls) to malate; malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) converts malate to oxaloacetate (OAA);
  and isocitrate synthase (Cit) condenses OAA and a second acetyl-CoA molecule to
  form citrate. Aconitase (Aco) catalyzes the isomerization of citrate into isocitrate,
  which is cleaved by isocitrate lyase (Icl) into succinate and glyoxylate. Glyoxylate
  can be used for the next round of the glyoxylate cycle, whereas succinate is used
  to replenish the citric acid cycle or to function as a precursor for amino acid
  or carbohydrate biosynthesis. In S. cerevisiae, citrate synthase, Cit2, and malate
  synthase Mls1 are peroxisomal enzymes, whereas Icl1 is cytosolic. This is in contrast
  to plants, filamentous fungi, and other yeast species, in which Icl is peroxisomal
  as well. Acetyl-CoA can also be exported via the carnitine shuttle, which involves
  peroxisomal Cat2. The malate shuttle is responsible for NADH export. The predicted
  small molecule transporters involved in both shuttles or in the glyoxylate cycle
  have not been identified yet.
