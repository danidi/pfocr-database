caption: 'Functional relations of differentially expressed genes with each other and
  with members of important pathways, as displayed by FunCoup online resource [].
  a Genes differentially expressed under confrontation with tumor cells and pathway
  members. Nodes: Yellow, genes of the proinflammatory signature [], and/or YAP/TAZ
  cascade [], and/or Hippo pathway []. Red, confrontation-specific DEGs. Orange: genes
  that belong to both “yellow” and “red” categories Line color denotes origin of FunCoup
  evidence for the network edges (see also “Global interaction network” in Methods):
  Red, protein-protein interactions. Blue: co-expression of mRNA. Deep green: links
  in a KEGG pathway. Multiple lines between the same two nodes indicate that multiple
  lines of evidence and were treated as single edges in NEA. Lines with FunCoup confidence
  <0.1 for the individual component are not shown. b Genes differently expressed between
  4 most and 4 least inhibitory fibroblast cultures before confrontation and pathway
  members. Yellow: the RhoA signaling pathway by PID database [] and pathway for RhoD
  regulation of cytosceletal dynamics via WHAMM []. Red, DEGs between inhibitory and
  non-inhibitory fibroblast samples. The the line color, see the legend in A'
