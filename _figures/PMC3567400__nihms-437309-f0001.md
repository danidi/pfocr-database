caption: (A) Proposed LNM biosynthetic pathway featuring LnmKLM-catalyzed β-alkylation
  of the LnmJ PKS module-8 ACP-tethered intermediate in S. atroolivaceus S-140. (B)
  Two parallel but distinct pathways for the acyl-S-ACP substrate involved in β-alkylation
  in polyketide biosynthesis, i.e., acetyl-S-ACP from malonyl-CoA by a dedicated ACP,
  AT, and KS enzymes and propionyl-S-ACP, from methylmalonyl-CoA by a dedicated ACP
  and a bifunctional AT/DC enzyme
