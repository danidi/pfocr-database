caption: The calcium channels in T cells. T cell receptor (TCR) engagement by a peptide-MHC
  on an antigen presenting cell (APC) induces protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) to activate
  phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1), which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  from plasma membrane phospholipids to generate diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3). Elevated levels of IP3 in the cytosol lead to the release of Ca2+ from IP3Rs
  located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Ca2+ depletion from the ER induces Ca2+
  influx from the extracellular space through the plasma membrane channel, ORAI1.
  Several additional channels also operate during TCR-mediated Ca2+signaling. These
  include plasma membrane IP3R activated by the ligand IP3, transient receptor potential
  (TRP) channels that can be operated by DAG and SOCE, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-responsive
  purinergic P2 (P2X) receptors, glutamate-mediated N-methyl-d-aspartate activated
  (NMDA) receptors, and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (CaV) that may be regulated
  through TCR signaling events. The mitochondria (MT) also control cytoplasmic Ca2+
  levels. Increase in intracellular Ca2+ results in activation of calmodulin–calcineurin
  pathway that induces NFAT nuclear translocation and transcription of target genes
  to direct T cell homeostasis, activation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis
  and survival. Within this complex network of Ca2+signaling, a model of the reciprocal
  regulation of CaV1 and ORAI1 in T cells has been proposed. (A) Low-level TCR signaling
  through interactions with self-antigens (i.e., self-peptides/self-MHC molecules)
  may result in CaV1 (particularly CaV1.4) activation and Ca2+ influx from outside
  the cell. This allows for filling of intracellular Ca2+ stores and initiation of
  a signaling cascade to activate a pro-survival program within the naïve T cell.
  STIM1 is not activated in this scenario and, consequently, ORAI1 remains closed.
  (B) Strong TCR signaling through engagement by a foreign peptide-MHC induces the
  downstream signaling events that result in ER Ca2+ store depletion and STIM1 accumulation
  in puncta in regions of the ER near the plasma membrane allowing interactions with
  Ca2+ channels. ORAI1 enhances STIM1 recruitment to the vicinity of CaV1 channels.
  Here, STIM1 can activate ORAI1 while inhibiting CaV1.
