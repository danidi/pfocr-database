caption: Schematic overview of CagL and CagA-mediated signal transduction pathways
  involved in H. pylori-induced cell motility and elongation. (A) H. pylori expresses
  CagL at the tip of the T4SS that directly binds to β1 integrins presented on gastric
  epithelial cells. Activated β1 integrin stimulates FAK and Src activity in early
  phases of H. pylori infections. FAK phosphorylates paxillin upon infection which
  might contribute to c-Abl-phosphorylated Crk signaling, which could be influenced
  by SFK activity via paxillin or p130CAS. FAK, SFKs and Abl kinase-mediated activation
  of Crk proteins can regulate the actin cytoskeleton through the DOCK180/Rac1/WAVE/Arp2/3
  pathway contributing to epithelial cell migration. (B) CagL-integrin binding leads
  to the translocation of the H. pylori pathogenic factor CagA into the host cytoplasm.
  CagA is rapidly phosphorylated by kinases of the Src family (SFK) and bind to a
  large number of host cells factors (X) in its phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated
  form. Tyrosine phosphorylated CagA interacts with Shp-2 and Csk to inactivate FAK
  and Src in late phases of H. pylori infection. While inactivated Src is replaced
  by activated Abl kinases to maintain CagA phosphorylation, inactive Src leads to
  tyrosine dephosphorylation of Src target molecules ezrin, vinculin and cortactin.
  Cortactin is then serine phosphorylated by H. pylori-activated ERK1/2 kinases, which
  crucially contributes to cell elongation. Black arrows, H. pylori-induced direct
  signaling pathways. Dotted arrows, H. pylori-induced or Src-mediated indirect signaling
  pathways. Grey arrows, inactivating signaling pathways. Red arrow, CagA injection
  as the central step in the regulation of focal adhesions. P, phosphorylated proteins.
  X, host cell proteins.
