caption: In the atherosclerotic lesion, in areas where nutrients are sufficient, increased
  inflammatory mediators and modified LDL cause reduced LKB1 levels through LKB1 degradation
  in macrophages. Loss of LKB1 in turn reduces serine phosphorylation (p-S53) and
  subsequent lysosomal degradation of scavenger receptor A (SRA), which associate
  with increased uptake of modified lipoproteins, increased foam cell formation, and
  increased inflammatory activation of macrophages in response to inflammatory mediators.
  Inflammatory mediators also increase glycolysis and downstream metabolic processes
  required for the macrophage to mount a full immune response. In a nutrient deprived
  state, on the other hand, glycolysis and levels of glycolytic intermediated are
  low, and the LKB1 pathway is activated to preserve cellular energy. The cell is
  impaired in its ability to respond to inflammatory stimuli. LKB1 thus may act as
  a rheostat to allow the lesional macrophage to respond appropriately depending on
  its nutritional state.
