caption: Underlying regulatory mechanisms of CCAT1 in human cancer. (A) C-Myc is able
  to directly bind to E-box element in CCAT1 promoter regions to activate CCAT1 transcription.
  (B) CCAT1, which may be activated by H3K27-acetylation, is able to serve as a scaffold
  for PRC2 and SUV39H1, and modulate the histone methylation of promoter of SPRY4,
  thereby epigenetically silencing tumour suppressor gene SPRY4. (C) CCAT1 additionally
  functions as competing endogenous RNA by sponging microRNA to free its target mRNA
  for protein production. (D) CCAT1 may activate the ERK/MAPK signalling pathway.
  CCAT1, colon cancer-associated transcript 1; ERK/MAPK, extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA; PRC2, polycomb
  repressive complex 2; SPRY4, sprouty RTK signalling antagonist 4; SUV39H1, suppressor
  of variegation 3–9 homolog 1.
