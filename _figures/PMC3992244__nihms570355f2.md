caption: Growth factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases activates PI3K (phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase) and PTEN suppresses signaling through this pathway. PI3K and mTORC2 activate
  AKT, which regulates mTORC1 activity by inhibition of the TSC1/2 complex. Independently,
  the Rag-GTPases control mTORC1 activity in response to nutrients, such as amino
  acids and glucose, at the lysosome surface. Multiple pathways downstream of active
  mTORC1 control anabolic processes, including protein and lipid synthesis and inhibit
  catabolic processes like autophagy. S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) regulates protein synthesis
  and ribosome biogenesis and 4E-BP1 regulates cap-dependent protein translation.
  Deletion of PTEN or TSC1 leads to the activation of mTORC1 and to stem cell depletion.
  Treatment with mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin, restores loss of stem cell function.
  The energy sensor AMPK becomes activated in response to glucose starvation and relative
  increases in the ratio of AMP and ADP to ATP levels. AMPK is phosphorylated and
  activated in an AMP dependent manner by the upstream master kinase LKB1 and in turn
  negatively regulates mTORC1 to promote catabolic, energy producing processes such
  as autophagy and fatty acid oxidation. Another intracellular sensor, SIRT1, becomes
  activated in response to relative increases in the ratio of NAD+ to NADH to regulate
  the activity of FOXO transcription factors. FOXO family members control expression
  of genes involved in oxidative stress, cell death, cell cycle control and metabolism,
  which are important for stem cell maintenance.
