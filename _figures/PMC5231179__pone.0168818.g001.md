caption: 'Metabolic reactions shown in solid red (down regulated) and solid green
  (up regulated) lines are regulated by salinity according to mass spectrometry (MS)
  and RT-qPCR analysis. Dashed arrows show reactions that are regulated based on MS
  data only. In addition, the regulation of activity by salinity was determined for
  the enzymes phosphofructokinase, malic enzyme, glutamate synthase, glutamate dehydrogenase,
  alanine dehydrogenase and fumarase (for details see paragraphs Carbohydrate metabolism,
  Tricarboxylic acid cycle and Ammonia assimilation).) Depicted is an overview of
  glycolysis (EMPEmbden-Meyerhof-Parnas; ED = Entner-Doudoroff) and the TCA cycle
  with the affiliated pathways of ectoine synthesis and glutamate synthesis. Pathway
  for arginine degradation via ornithine/carbamoyl-P is shown as well. Gray arrows
  show pathways that remain unchanged or escaped detection by proteome profiling (ND).
  Proteins detected by quantitative MS-analysis were considered for further investigation
  (RT-qPCR of the corresponding genes, enzyme assay) if the protein content changed
  by the factor ≥1.8 with increasing salinity. The protein content of phosphogluconate
  dehydratase and 2-keto-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase (dashed green arrows) was
  up regulated (MS-analysis) but the transcription appeared unchanged (RT-qPCR). The
  protein content of alanine dehydrogenase appeared up regulated according to the
  MS data but the transcription and enzyme activity were unchanged by salt. However,
  the activity of this enzyme was much higher than any other enzyme included in this
  study. Quantitative MS analysis revealed down regulation of glutamate dehydrogenase
  (gdh) at 1 M NaCl by the factor 1.79 (threshold 1.8) but was still further analyzed
  by enzyme assay and RT-qPCR, which proved a significant decline in enzyme activity
  and transcription at high salinity. The exact regulation factors derived from the
  MS data and the qPCR results can be found in the Supplementary Material (Figures
  A to W in  and Tables B and C in ). DABA: L-2,4-diaminobutyrate; MS: mass spectrometry.'
