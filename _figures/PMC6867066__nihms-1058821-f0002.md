caption: 'Assembly of a PIC containing Pol II and general initiation factors (yellow)
  is nucleated by binding of TFIID to the TATA element of the core promoter. A model
  for the regulation of PIC assembly and function involves, sequentially: (i) binding
  of regulatory factors to distal control elements; (ii) regulatory factor interactions
  with cofactors that modify chromatin structure to facilitate additional factor interactions;
  and (iii) regulatory factor interactions with cofactors that act after chromatin
  remodeling to facilitate, through direct interactions, recruitment or function of
  components the general transcription machinery. Solid black bars indicate direct
  interactions between the indicated factors. TAFs, TBP-associated factors. AD, activation
  domain. DBD, DNA binding domain. TSS, transcription start site. Adapted from ref.'
