caption: Proposed mixotrophic CO2 assimilation pathway in Roseobacter denitrificans.
  CO2 is taken up from the environment or supplied by the action of CO dehydrogenase.
  Carbonic anhydrase converts CO2 to HCO3−, which is then used by PEP carboxylase
  and pyruvate carboxylase. OAA is either entered into the TCA cycle or converted
  to aspartate, which can be converted to several amino acids and pyrimidine nucleotides.
  Although the assimilated carbon can be lost by the action of 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase,
  it will be maintained in TCA cycle intermediates that are recruited into other pathways.
