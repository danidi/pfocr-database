caption: Schematic representation of gene networks regulating flowering time showing
  differentially expressed genes in cid3cid4. Gene regulatory networks are based on
  previously reported work [,,,,,]. Black arrows and blunt head arrows indicate positive
  or negative effects, respectively, in the pathway. Differentially expressed genes
  between the cid3cid4 mutant and wild-type Col-0 are displayed in rectangles divided
  in two zones, each one of them in a green–yellow–red scale, upregulated genes are
  highlighted in green shades, and downregulated genes are highlighted in red shades.
  The left zone includes the values of 2 weeks-old plants, and the right zone the
  plants at bolting. Genes within the dotted rectangles did not show differential
  expression. Floral integrator genes are shadowed in violet. Floral meristem identity
  genes of the ABC model are shadowed in gray. A light gray rectangle encircles genes
  involved in photoperiodic flowering, and a gray rectangle encircles genes involved
  in the circadian clock. The dotted line below ELF4 connects to three ELF4 paralogs,
  ELF4-like1,3 and 4 whose function has not been well established. Gene code values
  of the differentially expressed genes are displayed in .
