caption: Physiological functions of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23). FGF23 is
  mainly produced in bone cells, osteoblasts, and osteocytes. One of the main target
  organs of the hormone FGF23 is the kidney. In the kidney, FGF23 acts on proximal
  and distal convoluted renal tubules. Binding of blood-borne FGF23 to FGF receptor-1c
  (FGFR1c) requires the presence of the co-receptor αKlotho. In renal proximal tubules
  (PT), FGF23 inhibits phosphate (Pi) re-uptake and expression of 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1),
  the rate-limiting enzyme for vitamin D hormone (1α,25(OH)2D3) production. The FGF23-mediated
  suppression of 1α-hydroxylase transcription involves extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase-1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation. However, the exact signaling pathway downstream
  of ERK1/2 is unknown. The inhibition of phosphate reabsorption in proximal renal
  tubules by FGF23 is mediated through activation of ERK1/2 and serum/glucocorticoid-regulated
  kinase-1 (SGK1), leading to phosphorylation of the scaffolding protein Na+/H+ exchange
  regulatory cofactor (NHERF)-1. NHERF-1 phosphorylation triggers internalization
  and degradation of the sodium-phosphate cotransporter NaPi-2a, so that less NaPi-2a
  is available in the apical membrane for phosphate uptake from urine. In distal convoluted
  tubules (DCT), FGF23 increases reabsorption of calcium and sodium by increasing
  the apical membrane abundance of the epithelial calcium channel transient receptor
  potential vanilloid-5 and of the sodium-chloride cotransporter NCC through a signaling
  cascade involving ERK1/2, SGK1, and with-no-lysine kinase-4 (WNK4). FGF23 locally
  produced by osteocytes is an auto-/paracrine inhibitor of bone mineralization by
  down-regulating tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) transcription in
  a αKlotho-independent fashion via FGFR1- or FGFR3-mediated activation of ERK1/2.
  The signaling pathway downstream of ERK1/2, leading to suppression of TNAP transcription,
  is not known. TNAP is essential for normal mineralization of bone by cleaving the
  mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate (PPi).
