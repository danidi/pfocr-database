caption: The pathway of circadian regulatory system of Arabidopsis thaliana according
  to the dynamic regulatory modeling in Table 1. The related genes are represented
  as ovals with different colors of light yellow (crytochrome), light blue (phytochrome),
  orange (biological clock genes), light green (some physiologically light-dependent
  downstream genes), and gray (other relevant genes not as target genes). There are
  three types of lines with colors of red (activation), blue (repression), and black.
  In addition to the black line representing the signal pipes from genes, the red
  lines are shown depending on the degree of activation whilst the blue lines are
  shown depending on the degree of repression. The black square symbol attached on
  the lines is the bifurcate node from the same pipe of signal. The circle symbol
  attached on the lines is the collecting nodes from different signal sources. The
  colored degree bar between activation and repression is also shown in the bottom
  of the figure.
