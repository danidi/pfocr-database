caption: Effects of type 3 deiodinase expression on Warburg phenotype. Hypoxia or
  oncogenic signals inhibit HIF-1a degradation and stabilize the nuclear association
  between HIF-1a and HIF-1b resulting in the transactivation of HIF-1 target genes.
  The activation of the M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase
  A (LDHA), and of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDHK1) that, in turn, inhibits
  the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) shunts cell metabolism from the mitochondrial
  respiration toward the fermentative glycolysis. Furthermore, the induction of max
  interactor 1 (MXI1), a transcriptional target of HIF-1 complex, inhibits mitochondrial
  biogenesis through the downexpression of nuclearly encoded mitochondrial genes.
  The coexpression of type 3 deiodinase (D3) decreases cytosolic triiodothyronine
  (T3) levels resulting in the activation of PKM2. It is also possible that D3 translocates
  from cytoplasm to the cell nucleus mediating nuclear thyroid hormone inactivation
  and local hypothyroidism. Bold arrows indicate activation, whereas the blunted lines
  indicate inhibition. Dashed arrows indicate protein translocation between cellular
  compartments. Dotted lines indicate the pathway reactions.
