caption: Diagram shows the effect of hyperoside on the oxLDL-LOX-1-ERK signaling pathway
  and VSMC proliferation. Increased blood LDL can trigger oxLDL increases in the walls
  of vein grafts and arteries. As a LOX-1 ligand, oxLDL can activate LOX-1 and its
  downstream signaling molecules, including ERK. Activated ERK leads to LOX-1 overexpression
  and promotes VSMCs viability, thereby altering vascular structure and function.
  Blocking LOX-1 and its downstream signaling molecules by hyperoside might inhibit
  vascular remodeling induced by oxLDL
