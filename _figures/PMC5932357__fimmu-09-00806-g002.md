caption: Antimicrobial autophagy is inhibited in Mycobacterium leprae infections through
  the activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway. After being inside the host
  cell, M. leprae is able to disrupt the phagosomal membrane by a mechanism that is
  dependent on the mycobacterial ESX-1 secretion system. Then, bacterial DNA activates
  the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING)/TANK-binding
  kinase 1 (TBK1) pathway and promotes interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) translocation,
  which induces IFN-β production. In response to an autocrine and/or paracrine IFN-β
  stimulus, macrophages increase OASL expression. OASL production inhibits bacterial
  clearance, blocking LC3-dependent autophagy, and promotes mycobacterial survival
  by creating a permissive microenvironment for sustainable growth and disease progression.
