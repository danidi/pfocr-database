caption: 'mTOR signaling pathway. Activated mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP1/2 and S6K1/2.
  The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1/2 causes the release of eIF4E which is then free to
  combine with the translation initiation complex, resulting in increased protein
  translation. Phosphorylated S6K1 phosphorylates eIF4B and S6 which also lead to
  increased protein translation. 4E-BP1/2: eIF4E-binding protein1/2. 40S: an eukaryotic
  small ribosomal subunit. 60S: an eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit. eIF4E/B/G/A:
  eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E/4B/4G/4A. mTOR: mammalian target of
  rapamycin. p: phosphorylated. S6K1/2, p70 ribosomal S6 Kinase 1/2'
