caption: 'a. The workflow of POA analysis, which relies on converging two lines of
  information: the intrinsic module structure which cooperatively determine the clinical
  prognosis outcome of heterogeneous patient population (blue rectangles); and the
  gene signatures for compound sensitivity resulting from in-vitro cell line screen
  (pink rectangles). b. Illustration of the ‘synergistic outcome determination’ (SOD),
  a proposed in vivo gene-gene functional interaction. SOD is defined as the synergy
  of a gene pair with respect to cancer patients'' outcome. Here gene A and gene B
  have two states: high expression or low expression level. Red triangles represent
  ‘bad outcome’ patients (shorter survival time or metastasis), and green rectangles
  represent ‘good outcome’ patients (longer survival time or non metastasis). In combination,
  the two genes are sufficient to determine the patient outcome, but each of them
  individually is uncorrelated with patient outcome. For example, given gene A state
  as ‘low expression’, all patients with A(Low) are distributed in two clusters and
  thus insufficient to determine the patients outcome. Given combination of A and
  B state, i.e., A(Low) B(high), its sufficient to determine the patient outcome as
  ‘good outcome’. c. Inter-module cooperation network construction. For each gene
  (g1∼g4 at left) in a given gene module, we identify their synergistic partner genes
  (the link from gene in module A1 to gene module B1 form a ‘Synergistically Inferred
  Nexus’, see ). Then the gene modules which are over-represented in the resulting
  gene list are identified as the ‘cooperative modules’ corresponding to the query
  gene module. d. Compound perturbation pattern. Genes associated with compound sensitivity
  (nodes within blocks) might be topologically cross-linked to the functional pathway
  (red rectangles) induced by compound perturbation. e. Disease specific inter-module
  cooperation network, nodes represent gene modules and the direct link represents
  the relationship between the ‘query module’ (A1) and its ‘cooperative module’ (B1).
  Here B1 cooperates with a large number of modules (with flow-in links), thus we
  called this special class of modules ‘gatekeeper modules’ (B1, B2) and others (without
  flow-in links) as ‘checkpoint modules’ (A1–A5). f. The Pattern of Action (POA) of
  one candidate compound generated by overlapping the disease-specific inter-module
