caption: Three apoptotic pathways (Extrinsic, intrinsic and granzyme pathways). In
  the extrinsic pathway, the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway is triggered by
  ligation of a death receptor, followed by the assembly of a caspase activation platform
  called the DISC complex. This activation platform recruits and activates caspase-8
  via adaptor molecules, and then subsequently leads to caspase 8-mediated activation
  of downstream effector caspases. In the intrinsic pathway, in response to various
  cellular stresses, pro-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl2 family mediate mitochondrial
  outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), permitting the release of pro-apoptotic
  factors such as cytochrome c into the cytosol. Cytochrome c then binds to APAF1,
  mediating its oligomerization and recruitment of caspase 9 into the apoptosome,
  which in turn leads to the activation of caspase 9 and subsequent proteolytic activation
  of effector caspases. In the granzyme B pathway, the injection of granzyme B by
  cytotoxic T-Cells can lead to the direct proteolytic activation of caspase 10, among
  other targets, which subsequently leads to the activation of effector caspases.

    In the extrinsic pathway, the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway is triggered
