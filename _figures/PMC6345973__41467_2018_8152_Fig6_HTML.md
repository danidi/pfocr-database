caption: A schematic summary of the present findings. In PCa cells, the androgen receptor
  (AR) directly activates IRE1α expression, that can also be induced by various stressors
  on the cell. IRE1α then splices XBP1 mRNA and allows for XBP1s generation. XBP1s
  transcriptionally induces c-MYC expression, a potent oncoprotein that contributes
  to tumor progression (left panel). MKC8866 or siXBP1 inhibit XBP1s expression, resulting
  in significantly decreased c-MYC levels leading to tumor regression (right panel)
