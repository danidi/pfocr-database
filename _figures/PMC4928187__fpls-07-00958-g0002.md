  the synthesis of glycolipids and PG, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate phosphatase was
  not detected in the genomic data of C. merolae. No PAP candidates were localized
  in the plastid in C. merolae. Putative FAD4 enzyme is included in this figure, although
  its localization could not be experimentally determined. In C. merolae, linoleoyl-CoA
