caption: A general overview of the signaling molecules involved in the regulation
  of autophagy in skeletal muscles. Autophagy is a multi-step process that involves
  distinct phases during which part of the cytoplasm intracellular organelles are
  sequestered within characteristic double-membraned autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes)
  that fuse with lysosomes and become autophagolysosomes. There, defective intracellular
  organelles and proteins are digested by a battery of lysosomal hydrolases. LC3 and
  the Vps34-Beclin1 complex are required, among many other proteins, for autophagosome
  formation. In skeletal muscles, ROS production influences different cell signaling
  pathways, including selective mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy). Damaged mitochondria
  removal is particularly needed during exercise when the oxidative metabolism and
  the turnover of mitochondria increase. Moreover, ROS are mainly produced by mitochondria.
  The activation of the pivotal autophagy protein LC3 is mediated by the redox-sensitive
  Atg4 protease, which cleaves LC3. Growth factors such as IGF induce the PI3K/Akt
  signaling, which activates mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 (known to activate protein
  synthesis) also inhibits autophagy, as it inhibits the formation of the Atg1 (in
  humans ULK1) complex. ULK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that forms a complex with
  different regulatory proteins such as Atg13 and Atg17. Atg13 hyper-phosphorylation
  inhibits its association with Atg1, while the Atg1–Atg13 interaction enables the
  generation of autophagosomes. mTORC2 phosphorylates and inhibits FoxO transcription
  factors, thus inhibiting autophagy. Indeed, dephosphorylated FoxOs migrate into
  the nucleus and activate the transcription of genes that control muscle mass. FoxOs
  activate both ubiquitin-proteasome genes (atrogin-1 and MuRF-1) and autophagy-lysosome
  genes such as Beclin1, LC3, Atg4, Atg12, Atg16, and Atg5. PTEN inhibits the PI3K/Akt
  signaling pathway, and, therefore, it enables autophagy. Exercise, mitochondrial
  dysfunctions, starvation, and oxidative stress increase the intracellular AMP/ATP
  ratio, thus activating the energy stress sensor AMPK, which, in turn, promotes autophagy
  by inhibiting mTORC1 through the phosphorylation of TSC2. The TSC complex, consisting
  of TSC1 and TSC2 proteins, regulates the activity of the mTORC via Rheb, a small
  GTPase. In addition, AMPK induces autophagy by triggering ULK1 phosphorylation.
  By integrating signals from upstream sensors such as mTOR and AMPK, the ULK1 complex
  plays a central role in autophagy. AMPK activates FoxO transcription factors and
  leads to the expression of LC3 and Beclin1. Through a mechanism not yet known, p38
  MAPK also seems to induce autophagy. In addition, SIRT1 can deacetylate Atg5, Atg7,
  and LC3, thus inducing autophagy; nuclear SIRT1 might induce the expression of autophagy
  genes through the activation of FoxOs. HDAC1 and 2 regulate muscle autophagy by
  controlling the expression of autophagy genes. During exercise, PGC-1α induction
  is mediated, among other things, by AMPK and p38 MAPK. Exercise up-regulates SIRT1
  that removes acetyl groups from PGC-1α, enabling its translocation to the nucleus.
  PGC-1α induction has been associated with increased autophagy, although this hypothesis
  needs further investigation. IGF, insulin growth factor; LC3, microtubule-associated
  protein 1-light chain 3; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; mTORC, mTOR complex;
  MuRF-1, muscle ring finger protein 1; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PTEN, phosphatase
  and tensin homologue; TSC, tuberosus sclerosis complex; ULK1, unc-51-like kinase1;
  Vps34, vacuolar protein sorting 34. To see this illustration in color, the reader
