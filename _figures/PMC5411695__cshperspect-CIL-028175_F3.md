caption: Hedgehog (Hh) signal transduction in the primary cilium. The primary cilium
  has several spatially distinct regions that promote normal Hh signal transduction.
  Entry into the cilium is gated at the transition zone; the EVC zone facilitates
  pathway activation in some cell types; the cilia tip compartment, defined by KIF7,
  is the site of enrichment and activation of the GLI/SUFU complex; and proteolytic
  processing to make GLI repressors that may occur at the base where protein kinase
  A (PKA) is localized and leads to formation of Gli3R. In the absence of Hh signal,
  PTCH1 and Gpr161, both negative regulators of the pathway, are present in the cilia
  membrane. Gpr161 trafficking into the cilium depends on TULP3 and intraflagellar
  transport (IFT)-A; GPR161 appears to activate Gαs, which activates adenylyl cyclase,
  which increases the levels of cAMP, thereby activating PKA. Activated PKA phosphorylates
  sites on GLI3 that promote partial proteolysis by βTrCP/Cul1 and the proteasome,
  generating Gli3 repressor (Gli3R), which moves to the nucleus and represses expression
  of Hh target genes. GLI2 and GLI3 are trafficked to the tip of the cilium in the
  absence of ligand in a complex with SuFu, and processing of GLI3 depends on it having
  transited the cilium. Binding of Hh to PTCH1 triggers its removal from the cilium,
  allowing Smoothened (SMO) to translocate into the cilium where it can activate downstream
  signaling. Gpr161 also exits the cilium after exposure to ligand. Binding of EvC
  to SMO near the base of the cilium promotes SMO activity. In the presence of ligand,
  the GLI/SUFU complex accumulates to high levels at the tip of the cilium, where
  dissociation of the complex allows formation of the activator form of GLI2.
