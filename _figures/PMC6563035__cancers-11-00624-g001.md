caption: PD-L1 reverse signaling in tumor cells and macrophages. Besides the effects
  mediated by PD-L1 triggering of PD-1 expressed by T cells, recent evidence supports
  the existence of a reverse signaling in PD-L1 expressing cells, either tumor cells
  or macrophages. In the case of neoplastic cells, it has been shown that the short
  intra-cytoplasmatic tail of the PD-L1 molecule contains some non-classical signal
  transduction motifs that mediate protection from IFNγ-induced cell death []. Similarly,
  PD-L1 reverse signaling, mediated by the binding of either cell-bound or soluble
  PD-1, has been demonstrated to support the proliferation and survival of classical
  Hodgkin lymphoma cells []. Differently from neoplastic cells, in macrophages, a
  PD-L1 cell intrinsic pathway seems to stimulate a constitutive inhibitory signal
  that, when interrupted, induces the up-regulation of activation markers, such as
  CD80, CD86 and MHC II molecules, and activates an anti-tumor phenotype in tumor-associated
  macrophages (TAMs) [].
