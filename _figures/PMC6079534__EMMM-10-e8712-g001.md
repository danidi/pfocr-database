caption: Naïve immune cells rely on glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation as the
  main metabolic pathways to generate ATP. Glycolysis is the catabolic process in
  which glucose is converted into pyruvate. Extracellular glucose is imported into
  cells by GLUT1 (SLC2A1 gene). Subsequent intracellular processing of glucose yields
  two pyruvate molecules and two ATP molecules by a series of enzymatic reactions.
  At sufficient O2 tension, pyruvate is imported in mitochondria and converted into
  acetyl‐coA and enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle, a.k.a. Kreb's cycle),
  after which each pyruvate yields 17 ATP molecules by the electron transport chain
  (ETC) and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon activation of immune cells, the glycolysis
  pathway is upregulated under the control of HIF‐1α. The metabolic pathway shifts
  from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, also referred to as the Warburg
  effect, to meet the increased energy demand in activated immune cells. Despite the
  presence of abundant O2 in the environment, glucose is then directly metabolized
  into lactate. Although energetically less favorable (glycolysis generates 2 molecules
  of ATP out of 1 molecule glucose, whereas oxidative phosphorylation provides 36
  ATP molecules), aerobic glycolysis allows higher velocity of glycolysis and thus
  faster ATP production, as well as provides important precursors for the synthesis
  of lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides required for proliferation. Interfering
  with aerobic glycolysis in immune cells has been shown to undermine their anti‐infectious
  activities, highlighting the importance of this altered metabolism in activated
  immune cells.
