caption: Type I IFN Signaling. Type-I IFNs bind to a heterodimer composed of the transmembrane
  receptor subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, which results in activation of the receptor-associated
  kinases Jak1 and Tyk2. In the canonical signaling pathway, the cytoplasmic signal
  transducers and activator of transcription (Stat) proteins are recruited to the
  receptor docking sites, phosphorylated, and dimerize to form the active transcription
  factors ISGF3 (Interferon stimulated gene factor 3), composed of phosphorylated
  Stat 1 and Stat2, and IRF9 (p48/ISGF3γ), and AAF/GAF (alpha activation factor/gamma
  activation factor), which is composed of two phosphorylated subunits of Stat1. These
  induce transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). IFN treatment
  also leads to induction of other non-canonical signaling pathways, including those
  involving p38 MAPK, Akt, and Crk. Upstream signaling from the IFNR complex leads
  to p38 phosphorylation, which modulates IFN activity and leads to growth inhibition
  of cells. CrkL and CrkII are tyrosine phosphorylated by Tyk2 after IFN treatment,
  and CrkL can also form transcription factor complexes with phosphorylated Stat5.
  Signaling pathways downstream of PI3K, involving Akt and mTOR, or PKCδ, are also
  important in mediating the biological activities of IFN.
