caption: 'Overview of potential pathways of OAT/OATP transporter trafficking. N‐glycosylation
  in the ER‐Golgi apparatus is followed by vesicular delivery to the plasma membrane.
  Subsequent internalization from the plasma membrane occurs via clathrin‐coated pits
  and caveolae that deliver transporters to the early endosome. From the early endosome
  evidence suggests that certain transporters could be delivered to the late endosome
  for lysosomal degradation, or to the recycling endosome and the Golgi apparatus
  for targeted delivery back to the plasma membrane. Individual OAT/OATP transporters
  have been detected in each of the subcellular locations indicated. However, each
  pathway has not been uniformly established for all transporters. Greater mechanistic
  detail along each of the proposed pathways is also required. Key: vertical blue
  bars indicate unglycosylated transporter monomers in the Golgi apparatus; G indicates
  N‐glycosylated transporter monomers.'
