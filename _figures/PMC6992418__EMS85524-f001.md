caption: (A) Schematic representation of YAP and TAZ (YAP/TAZ) regulatory inputs and
  biological functions. The Hippo pathway and mechanical cues are the two main pillars
  conveying a heterogeneous set of signals for YAP/TAZ regulation. Polarity and cell
  crowding can inhibit YAP/TAZ through the activation of the Hippo pathway, while
  mechanical features promoting a proficient F-actin cytoskeleton sustain YAP/TAZ
  activity. Additionally, Hippo signaling and F-actin cytoskeleton can negatively
  affect each other []. Activated YAP/TAZ enter the nucleus, where they regulate genetic
  programs required for fundamental cellular behavior (proliferation, survival, stem
  cell’s fate and plasticity) and biological processes (organ growth, tissue regeneration,
  tumorigenesis). (B) Notch signaling cascade. The Notch pathway is activated by the
  engagement of a receptor (blue) on the signal-receiving cell with the ligand (green)
  on the neighboring signal-sending cell. This transinteraction triggers two sequential
  proteolytic cleavages of the Notch receptor mediated by ADAM proteases (S2 cleavage)
  and gamma-secretase (γ-secretase) (S3 cleavage), leading to the release of the Notch
  intracellular domain (NICD) fragment. NICD then translocates to the nucleus, where
  it activates the transcription of Notch target genes together with the transcription
  factor RBPJ (yellow) and the nuclear effector Mastermind-like (MAML, purple). On
  the contrary, the interaction between ligands and receptors on the surface of the
  same cell results in cis inhibition of Notch signals.
