caption: Model of HO-1 mediated antihypertrophic effect in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Redox
  imbalance in cardiomyocytes activates IKK to phosphorylate IkB, causing its dissociation
  from NF-κB thereby exposing the nuclear localization signal. Translocation of NF-κB
  results in the activation of the hypertrophic gene program, thus leading to increased
  protein synthesis, a consequence related to increased sarcomere formation that ultimately
  causes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. HO-1 interrupts this pathway by abrogating NF-κB
  transactivation, in part through a reduction in excessive ROS accumulation. (HO-1,
  heme oxygenase-1; BVR, biliverdin reductase; ROS, reactive oxygen species; IKK,
  IkB kinase; IkB, inhibitor of kappa B; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa B; SN-50 inhibitor
  of NF-κB translocation).
