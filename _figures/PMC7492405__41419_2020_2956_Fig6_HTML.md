caption: After damage, elevated SHH ligand expression activates the SHH pathway in
  endometrial stromal cells, which causes fibrogenesis and drives a stroma-myofibroblast
  transition if the activation is sustained. For the SHH-driven fibrosis, declined
  autophagy, which is regulated by SHH pathway and might be mediated by pAKT-mTORC1,
  influences the degradation of fibrosis-related proteins (like collagen I), contributing
  to the regulatory mechanism.
