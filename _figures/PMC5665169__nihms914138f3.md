caption: a | Musashi 2 (MSI2) protein inhibits NUMB translation by binding directly
  to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of NUMB precursor-mRNA (pre-mRNA) and also competing
  with eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 γ1 (eIF4G1) for binding to poly(A)
  binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1). MSI2 also enhances the translation of crucial
  transcription factor genes such as Myc, IKAROS family zinc finger 2 (Ikzf2) and
  homeobox A9 (Hoxa9), by binding directly to the mRNA transcripts. The resulting
  NUMB inhibition and enhanced MYC, IKZF2 and HOXA9 protein expression promotes Notch
  signalling pathway activation and self-renewal programmes that are required for
  haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance and cancer stem cell (CSC) regeneration.
  b | MSI2 upregulation is observed in self-renewing normal HSCs and malignant progenitors
  (CSCs) of blast crisis chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute myeloid leukaemia
  (AML). In cooperation with BCR–ABL1 oncogene activation, which induces a chronic
  phase-like CML phenotype, MSI2 represents a second hit required to enhance CSC self-renewal
  capacity. Similar to the role for the MSI2–NUMB pathway in aggressive leukaemia,
  blocking MSI2 restores NUMB expression and inhibits CSC propagation, thus preventing
  leukaemic initiation in CML and AML. TSPAN3, tetraspanin-3.
