caption: Major signaling pathways of cranial suture fusion. Discoid domain receptors
  (DDRs) and integrins are 2 groups of proteins that regulate the compositions of
  collagens in the ECM. It is thought that the binding of collagen to DDRs inhibits
  collagen fibrillogenesis through the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).
  The integrins activate growth-promoting signaling pathways such as the Ras, ERK,
  and c-FOS cascade, signal through the JNK pathway to regulate the progression through
  the cell cycle, and inhibit apoptosis. We speculate that these pathways are involved
  in cranial suture biology.
