  neoformans. Two signal inputs to the cAMP signaling pathway are proposed in this
  model and involve nutrient transport and sensing. Fermentable carbon sources, such
  as glucose, are transported into the cell via hexose transporters and phosphorylated
  by hexose kinases to produce glucose-6-phosphate (Glu6P), which in turn regulates
  Cac1 or Gpa1 activation to engage cAMP signaling. Glucose may also be sensed by
  an unknown receptor to activate the cAMP pathway. Gpr4 may also play a role in low
  glucose concentration sensing based on the cAMP assay results. In this model, Gpr4
  is an amino acid sensor and interacts with Gpa1 to regulate downstream elements
  of the cAMP pathway. This model does not exclude that other proteins such as methionine
  permease may participate in ligand sensing via direct or indirect interactions with
  Gpr4. Hxt, hexose transporters; Hxk, hexose kinases; Glu6P, glucose-6-phosphate.
