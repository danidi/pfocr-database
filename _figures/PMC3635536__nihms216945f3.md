caption: '(A) Expression profile of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors within structures
  associated with schizophrenia (squares) and areas projecting to these structures.
  Green: excitatory receptors; Red: inhibitory receptor; MS: medial septum; NBM: nucleus
  basalis of meynert; MT: mesopontine tegmentum; SN substantia nigra pars compacta;
  VTA: ventral tegmental area. Although it has been very difficult to target specific
  muscarinic receptors with drugs, the recent identification of highly specific allosteric
  modulators of multiple receptor subtypes will make it possible to explore targeted
  pharmacotherapies. (B) Intracellular signaling associated with nicotinic receptor
  alpha 7 (nAChR α7) and the G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptor M1. nAChR α7 has
  high permeability for Ca2+ ions and channel opening promotes Ca2+ influx from the
  extracellular milieu and subsequent activation of Ca2+-associated signals. M1 signal
  is mediated by the Gq/11-PLC pathway, which includes activation of PKC and Ca2+-associated
  signaling. α7 agonists have shown potential promise in treating negative and cognitive
  symptoms, but rapid receptor desensitization makes this a difficult target.'
