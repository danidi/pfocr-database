caption: Oxidative damage cell death pathway. The inhibition of Topo IV by LVX, or
  of Topo I by SCN, causes a local increase in supercoiling, resulting in the up-regulation
  of the fatDCEB operon. The consequent increase in the iron transporter it encodes
  causes an increase in intracellular Fe2+. MOX alters the transcriptome, up-regulating
  genes from several metabolic pathways involved in the production of pyruvate. Pyruvate
  can then be converted by pyruvate oxidase (SpxB) into hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
  Fe2+ and H2O2 are the substrates of the Fenton reaction. The Fenton reaction renders
  hydroxyl radicals, which oxidatively damage DNA, proteins and lipids. Taken from
  , with modifications.
