caption: Proposed model illustrating how M. tuberculosis MmsA inhibits type I IFN
  responses. In M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages, M. tuberculosis releases the
  genomic DNA, cyclic dinucleotide, and many secreted proteins, including MmsA, into
  the cytosol. Mycobacterial genomic DNA, cyclic dinucleotide c-di-AMP, or host mitochondrial
  DNA may trigger the DNA sensor cGAS to activate the STING-TBK1-IRF3 pathway to induce
  IFN-β production. In this process, M. tuberculosis MmsA may act as a bridge linking
  p62 and STING to facilitate the p62-mediated selective autophagic degradation of
  STING, leading to the reduction of STING protein level and the subsequent phosphorylation
  of TBK1 and IRF3, which eventually blunts type I IFN responses. CTD, C-terminal
  domain; DD, dimerization domain; NTD, N-terminal domain.
