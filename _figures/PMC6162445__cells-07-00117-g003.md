caption: 'Mechanism of GPCR bias agonism involves insulin receptor activation. Bradykinin
  and angiotensin II form a complex with the neuromedin B receptor (NMBR), IRβ, and
  Neu-1. Bradykinin and angiotensin II preferentially lead to insulin-receptor signaling
  by first forming a complex with NMBR. This heterodimerization leads Gα, β, and γ
  to activate MMP-9. Upon activation, MMP-9 removes EBP, which in turn activates Neu-1.
  Crosstalk between these activated components leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent
  activation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), initiating the phosphoinositide
  3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K–AKT) pathway, in addition to others, without insulin.
