number: Fig. 2
caption: 'Synthesis of gonadal hormones. The primary gonadal hormones: progesterone,
  testosterone and estradiol are part of the same synthetic pathway as described in
  this figure. In females all steps of the synthetic pathway occur in the ovary. Since
  steroid hormones are not sequestered in vesicles they are secreted upon synthesis.
  In males, testosterone is produced by the testes. The dashed line is intended to
  indicate that testosterone from the testes can be converted to estradiol or dihydrotestosterone
  in the brain and other organs (e.g., skin) that have the necessary enzymes: aromatase
  or 5alpha-reductase (enzymes are depicted above enclosed in an oval). The brain
  is also capable of synthesizing progesterone, testosterone and estradiol de novo'
