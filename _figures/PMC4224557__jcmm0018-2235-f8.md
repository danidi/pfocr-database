caption: The postulated molecular regulation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase
  (eEF-2K)/TG2 pathway to the invasion-promoting signalling in pancreatic cancer (PaCa)
  cells. Rottlerin- or siRNA-induced down-regulation of eEF-2K constitutively suppresses
  the signalling involving TG2/β1 integrin/Src/uPAR/MMP-2-mediated degradation of
  ECM and enhancement of cell invasion/migration. eEF-2K regulates TG2, probably through
  c-Myc. The expression of c-Myc in many tumours (e.g. mammary tumours) induces altered
  gene expression reflecting an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) profile. eEF-2K/TG2–mediated
  signalling cascade plays an important role in the survival mechanisms controlling
  cellular proliferation, motility and invasion and stimulates the expression of the
  zinc finger transcriptional factors (Snail and TCF8/ZEB1). These mesenchyme markers
  repress gene transcription of epithelial markers (claudins and E-cadherin) facilitating
  EMT, further supporting the motility and invasiveness of PaCa cells.
