caption: Molecular mechanism of adipogenesis. During the process of mesenchymal stem
  cells (MSCs) commitment to adipose lineage, WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein
  2(WISP2) presented in the cytosol repressed transcriptional activator zinc finger
  protein-423 (ZFP423) through formation of a WISP2/ZFP423 complex in cytosol. Bone
  morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) phosphorylates SMAD1/5/8 to dissociate WISP2/ZFP423
  complex, making ZFP423 enter into the nucleus and further activates peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor γ (PPARγ). BMP4 inhibitor Gremlin-1 suppresses MSCs by inhibiting BMP4.
  Likewise, extracellular WISP2 inhibits PPARγ by activating β-catenin. After committed
  differentiation to adipogenic lineage, EBF transcription factor 1(EBF1), a transcription
  factor activated by CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPβ) and C/EBPδ, induces
  the activation of PPARγ. C/EBPα binds on the promoter region of PPARγ and forms
  the self-reinforcing regulatory loop to further stimulate adipogenesis. Activated
  PPARγ heterodimerizes with retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) and promotes transcription
  of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and lipid transport
