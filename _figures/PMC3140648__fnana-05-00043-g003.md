caption: Roles of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the control of basal ganglia–thalamocortical
  circuitry. Output neurons in the striatum are medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which
  consist of striatonigral/direct pathway and striatopallidal/indirect pathway neurons.
  Direct pathway neurons are GABAergic, and inhibit tonically active neurons in globus
  pallidus interna (GPi)/substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). Indirect pathway
  neurons are also GABAergic, and activate neurons in GPi/SNpr via inhibition of globus
  pallidus externa (GPe) GABAergic neurons and activation of subthalamic nucleus (STN)
  glutamatergic neurons. Direct and indirect pathway neurons induce opposing effects
  on the output neurons in GPi/SNpr, resulting in dis-inhibition and pro-inhibition
  of output, respectively, to motor areas of the thalamus and cortex. The inhibition
  of PDEs increases cAMP/PKA signaling in both direct and indirect pathway neurons.
  PDE inhibitors that predominantly act in direct pathway neurons work like dopamine
  D1 receptor agonists and activate motor function, whereas PDE inhibitors that predominantly
  act in indirect pathway neurons work like dopamine D2 receptor antagonists and inhibit
  motor function. SNpc, substantia nigra pars compacta. Reproduced with permission
