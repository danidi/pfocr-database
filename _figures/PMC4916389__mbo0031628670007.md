caption: The interconnected signaling pathway of sexual development in S. macrospora.
  On the basis of functional characterization and protein-protein interaction studies,
  STRIPAK (C) hypothetically interacts with the SIN (A), TORC2 (B), and the CWI pathway
  (D). (A) The SIN is composed of three kinases and an adjacent kinase (). Phenotypic
  analysis of STRIPAK mutants and TAP-MS data suggest a functional relationship between
  the SIN and STRIPAK in S. macrospora (). (B) TORC2 targets TAP42, and SAC7 interacts
  with PP2Ac1. SAC7 is a GTPase-activating protein and regulates the small GTPase
  RHO1, a subunit of the CWI pathway (). (C and D) Several STRIPAK and CWI pathway
  subunits interact, and cell wall stress-related growth defects in the Δpp2Ac1, Δpro22,
  and Δpp2Ac1 Δpro22 mutant strains point toward a relationship between the two pathways.
  Models of STRIPAK and CWI pathways are adapted from references 27 and 25, respectively.
  Interaction partners of PP2Ac1 are framed by bold lines. Solid gray arrows, dashed
  black arrows, dashed gray lines, and dotted gray lines indicate functions, signaling
  pathways, negative regulation, and putative translocation, respectively. GCK, germinal-center
  kinase.
