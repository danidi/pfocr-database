caption: Schematic representation of a PBPK model for describing the time profiles
  of 14C-erythromycin after intravenous 14C-erythromycin administration in a healthy
  subject. The PBPK model consisting of six organ compartments was built with pharmacokinetic
  parameters for 14C-erythromycin. The upper right panel shows the liver composed
  of two subcompartments (ES and LC) where nonlinear uptake and efflux transporters
  and linear enzymatic clearance were embedded. In the lower right panel, the metabolic
  by-product model is illustrated where the metabolite 14C-formate is converted to
  radiolabeled bicarbonate H14CO3− in the CYP3A4-mediated pathway and dissolved in
  the LC subcompartment. The series of conversion from 14C-formaldehyde to H14CO3−
  is assumed to be a rapid process and nonrate limiting. Then, 14CO2 is produced and
  exhaled in breath as a result of the first-order elimination of bicarbonate (with
  a constant kresp) from the LC subcompartment. IV, intravenous.
