caption: The molecular process of DNA damage repair associated with PARP inhibitor
  sensitivity and resistance. 1) During the repair of DSBs by NHEJ, damage is recognized
  and bound by Ku70‐Ku80 heterodimers, DNA‐PKcs and Artemis are activated, and XRCC4
  and DNA ligase‐IV are recruited to complete DNA end joining. NHEJ occurs throughout
  the cell cycle and directly ligates the ends of a DSB. The loss of the abovementioned
  crucial proteins in the NHEJ pathway might induce resistance to PARP inhibitors.
  2) During the repair of DSBs by HR, DNA lesions are recognized by the MRE11‐NBS1‐RAD50
  (MRN) complex, and DNA end resection is initiated. In a PALB2‐dependent fashion,
  BRCA2 is recruited, which loads RAD51 onto the DNA to mediate strand invasion on
  the homologous sister chromatid. HR occurs mainly in the S and G2 phases. The switch
  between HR and NHEJ depends on the activity of S phase CDKs, which phosphorylate
  CtIP in order to activate the MRN complex and stimulate DNA end resection, which
  is regulated by 53BP1, REV7 and RIF1. The abovementioned crucial proteins in the
  HR pathway might thus affect PARP inhibitor sensitivity. 3) In addition, the cell
  cycle checkpoint pathway and the FA‐BRCA1 pathway are involved in HR, and crucial
  proteins in these pathways are associated with PARP inhibitor sensitivity,
