caption: 'VIP tunes immune and inflammatory response by regulating multiple signaling
  pathways. a VIP signaling during inflammatory response (macrophage, microglia and
  DCs). Binding of VIP to its receptor induces cAMP, activates PKA and exerts several
  effects: (1) inhibition of IFNγ-induced Jak1/Jak2 phosphorylation, STAT1 activation
  and subsequent expression of IRF-1, which is critical for gene activation of various
  inflammatory genes (CD40, CXCL10, iNOS, COX2); (2) inhibition of various MAPK cascades,
  initiated by suppression of MEKK1/MEK4 and of MEKK1/MEK6 and subsequent inhibition
  of Jun-kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, respectively. This results in a change in the
  composition of the transcription factor AP-1 with c-Jun being replaced by JunB,
  and inhibition of phosphorylation/activation of TATA-box binding protein (TBP).
  Moreover, through a PKA-independent mechanism, VIP inhibits IκB-kinase (IKK) activity
  and suppresses nuclear translocation and activation of the transcription factor
  NFκB. AP1, TATA-box protein and NFκB act in concert to activate gene transcription
  of most of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as costimulatory molecules.
  Moreover, in a PKA-dependent manner, VIP stimulates cAMP-responsive element binding
  (CREB) factor to compete with NFκB for coactivators, such as p300-CBP, required
  for transcription of inflammatory genes. b VIP signaling in T lymphocytes. Binding
  of VIP to its receptors activates the cAMP/PKA pathway, which regulates cell cycle
  and activation of T lymphocytes at multiple levels. First, VIP downregulates the
  PI3K-Akt pathway and, consequently, the activity of cdk4-cyclin D complexes, which
  induce genes involved in DNA replication and progression through the S phase. VIP
  also inhibits the expression of cyclin D3. In parallel, VIP increases the levels
  of the cdk-inhibitor p27kip1 by inhibiting the Akt-mediated phosphorylation/degradation
  of p27kip1 and by inducing p27kip1 gene expression. Thus, VIP promotes the p27kip1-mediated
  inactivation of the cyclin E-cdk2 complexes that result in cell cycle arrest in
  the G1 phase. Second, VIP inhibits signaling through the Ras–Raf1–MEK1–ERK cascade
  by reducing Ras activity and by impairing Raf1–Ras interaction. This deactivates
  AP-1 and reduces its binding to the IL-2 promoter. Moreover, VIP decreases the nuclear
  translocation of NFκB and NFAT, also required for IL-2 transcription. As a critical
  growth factor for T cells, inhibition of IL-2 by VIP reduces T cell proliferation
  and induces anergy. Third, VIP increases the expression of both soluble and membrane
  forms of CTLA4, which are critically involved in the induction of Foxp3 expression
  and of suppressor activity in T cells. Arrows indicate activation. Dotted-end lines
  indicate inhibition'
