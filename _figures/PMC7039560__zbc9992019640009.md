caption: Hypothesized models for nitrogen metabolism. A, ammonia metabolism in blood,
  liver, brain, retina, and RPE. In the liver, 15NH4Cl is mostly assimilated in urea
  through urea cycle, glutamine through GS, and glutamate through GDH to synthesize
  nonessential amino acids. Urea and nonessential amino acids in the liver may be
  exported into blood to enter other tissues or excreted into urine. The assimilation
  of ammonium into glutamine is the dominant pathway in the brain, retina, and RPE.
  However, brain and retina could also utilize ammonium to synthesize asparagine.
  B, the role of nitrogen metabolism through transamination in the metabolic communication
  between RPE and retina. In the outer retina, glucose is mostly metabolized into
  lactate, which could export to RPE to fuel mitochondrial metabolism and preserve
  glucose (); pyruvate can convert into alanine coupled with glutamate oxidation,
  but alanine could not be utilized in the retinal mitochondria except the inhibition
  of MPC. In the retina, aspartate transaminase is the major pathway in the catabolism
  and anabolism of aspartate, glutamate, and other glutamate-derived amino acids.
  By readily utilizing multiple transaminases, RPE could synthesize glutamate and
  its derived amino acids and may export them to be used in the outer retina (). Red
  arrows represent the amino acid communication between retina and RPE. Dashed lines
  represent hypothesized pathways. Oxop, oxoproline; Pyr, pyruvate; Lac, lactate.
