  description: Notch activity in different contexts, exemplified here within the context
    of epithelial tissues and cells (olive-green cells, partly with brush border).
    Notch activity is important in stem cell renewal and differentiation (top-right).
    This is hijacked in some cancer cell types to maintain stem-like features such
    as unlimited proliferation and acquiring resistance to radio/chemotherapy (cells
    orange-brown color), in others to gain a mesenchymal phenotype (gray cells) that
    can resemble the phenotype of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs, dark brown)
    and may result in collective invasion, characteristic for epithelial cells. As
    tumors grow, they may become increasingly hypoxic, which triggers neo-angiogenesis.
    The vasculature (endothelial cells, turquoise) is positive for Notch receptors
    and ligands, thus the interaction of the vasculature with tumor cells is likely
    a factor in invasiveness. One of the most striking features of Notch signaling,
    via Jag1 and hyb-E/M (hybrid epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition), is its supportive
    role in circulating clusters of tumor cells that have particularly high metastatic
    potential (olive colored, rounded cells), partnering also with immune cells (stellate,
    blue cells with red nuclei). The inset shows the ligand–receptor activation between
    2 cells. Gene symbols explained in the text.
