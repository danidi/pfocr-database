caption: Roles of the Hippo pathway in effector T cell differentiation. The primary
  event of naive T cell activation is the interaction between T cell receptor (TCR)
  on T cells and an antigen loaded on antigen-presenting cells (APC). APC present
  antigenic peptides with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (for CD8+
  T cells) or class II (for CD4+ T cells) molecules. Upon activation, naive CD8+ T
  cells differentiate into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) that mediate cellular immunity
  and secrete series of cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFNγ). Naive CD4+ T cells
  differentiate into T helper (Th) cells, including effector T cells (Th1, Th2, Th17)
  and regulatory T cells (Treg). Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling
  is required for Treg lineage, while interleukin 6 (IL-6) together with TGFβ cytokines
  are essential for Th17 differentiation. Key transcription factors have also been
  identified for each T cell lineage [forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) for Treg, RAR related
  orphan receptor gamma t (RORγt, also known as RORC) for Th17]. Treg cells produce
  TGFβ and suppress effector T cell activities, maintaining immune system homeostasis
  and self-tolerance. Th17 cells produce IL-17 cytokine and are involved in chronic
  and autoimmune inflammation. MST1/2 and YAP are shown to mediate Treg differentiation
  by diverse mechanisms. TAZ acts as a critical co-activator of RORγt for Th17 differentiation.
