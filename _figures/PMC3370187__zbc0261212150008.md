caption: BMPs and SHH cooperatively provide favorable circumstances for the growth
  and/or survival of prostate cancer cells and the differentiation of stromal cells.
  A, BMPs induce the production of SHH through a Smad-dependent pathway. SHH enhances
  the BMP signals in MC3T3-E1 cells, possibly through the induction of ActR-IIB and
  Smad1. The osteoblastic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells was facilitated by SHH
  that was induced by LNCaP cells in response to BMPs. B, BMPs exhibit a growth-inhibitory
  action in LNCaP cells, whereas they promote the proliferation of LNCaP cells in
  the presence of MC3T3-E1 cells. C, BMPs provide favorable circumstances for the
  growth and/or survival of prostate cancer cells and the differentiation of bone
  stromal cells.
