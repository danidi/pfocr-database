caption: 'Tetrahydropterin structure, cofactor role, and biosynthesis. (A) The pterin
  nucleus, its levels of reduction, and the structures of compounds relevant to this
  study. (B) The requirement for a tetrahydropterin (H4-pterin) cofactor for phenylalanine
  hydroxylase (PAH) and the cofactor regeneration cycle involving pterin-4a-carbinolamine
  dehydratase (PCD) and quinonoid dihydropterin (q-H2-pterin) reductase (q-DHPR; EC
  1.5.1.34). (C) The established steps in tetrahydrobiopterin (H4-BPt) biosynthesis
  and possible routes for tetrahydromonapterin (H4-MPt) biosynthesis in relation to
  the folate pathway. H4-BPt is formed by the sequential action of 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin
  (P-H4-Pt) synthase (PTPS-II) and sepiapterin reductase (SR). H4-MPt could originate
  via the FolX-catalyzed epimerization of dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2-NPt-P3)
  to dihydromonapterin triphosphate (H2-MPt-P3), followed by dephosphorylation to
  dihydromonapterin (H2-MPt) and reduction by a dihydropterin reductase (EC 1.5.1.33),
  putatively FolM. H4-MPt also could come from the FolB-mediated epimerization of
  dihydroneopterin (H2-NPt) followed by reduction. FolB also mediates the side chain
  cleavage of H2-NPt or H2-MPt to give 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin (H2-HMPt); the
  H2-MPt cleavage is omitted for simplicity. Other abbreviations: P-ase, phosphatase;
  H2-HMPt-P2, 6-hydroxymethyldihydropterin diphosphate; pABA, p-aminobenzoate; H2-pteroate,
  dihydropteroate; H2-folate, dihydrofolate; H4-folate, tetrahydrofolate.'
