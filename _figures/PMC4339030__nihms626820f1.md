caption: Proteins are synthesized on ribosomes from the genetic information encoded
  in cellular DNA and undergo the major part of their folding in the cytoplasm after
  release from the ribosome. Newly synthesized proteins are translocated into the
  endoplasmic reticulum, where they fold into their 3D structures. Correctly folded
  proteins are transported to the Golgi complex and then delivered to the extracellular
  environment. Under certain circumstances, a folded protein is converted to a misfolded
  protein by various stresses, gene mutations or proteolysis. During normal conditions,
  misfolded proteins are detected by a quality-control mechanism and are degraded
  by the ubiquitin–proteosome pathway. A misfolded protein can be induced to form
  prefibrillar oligomers at higher concentrations and transported to form aggresomes.
  These aggregated proteins at the aggresome are targeted for degradation via macroautophagy.
  Accumulation of prefibrillar oligomers at the aggresome pathway may induce apoptosis.
  Curcumin, a potential antioxidant or anticancer compound may inhibit protein misfolding
  and/or aggregation. Protein aggregation can also be blocked by upregulation of molecular
  chaperones with heat shock protein (HSP)90 inhibitors (17-allylamino-demethoxygeldanamycin
  (AAG), 17-[dimethylaminoethylamino]-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (DMAG), STA-9090, STA-1474
  and geldamycin) or HSP70 inhibitors, such as 2-phenylethyneusulfonamide. Aggregate
  clearance can be upregulated via inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin that inhibits macroautophagy.
  Analogues of rapamycin, such as CCI-779 (temsirolimus), RAD001 (everolimus) and
  AP23573, are likely to be the first mTOR-perturbing molecules to be approved for
  anticancer use in humans. Redrawn with permission of Cambridge University Press
