caption: 'The AMPK signaling pathway is a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis
  and metabolism AMPK is regulated by diverse mechanisms and stimuli that provide
  a variety of opportunities for pharmacological intervention. (A) Indirect Activation:
  Upstream AMPK activators. LKB1 and CaMKKβ principally regulate AMPK. Stimulation
  of these pathways upstream of AMPK can activate AMPK signaling indirectly. (B) Direct
  AMPK Activators. AMPK can be directly activated by a nucleotide analog (such as
  AMP and ZMP) binding to the regulatory subunit and inducing a conformational change
  that enhances AMPK phosphorylation. (C) Downstream AMPK signaling pathways. The
  AMPK pathway can also be activated by stimulation of downstream signaling partners.
  This can mimic and/or enhance the effects of AMPK activation in response to normal
  physiological stimuli. (D) Indirect inducers of metabolic stress. Many compounds
  and stimuli induce metabolic stress, which results in the release of Ca2+ ions,
  and fluctuation in the cellular AMP/ATP ratios. These metabolites play a profound
  role in regulation of AMPK activation and can significantly enhance AMPK signaling
  under these conditions. (E) miRNA modulation of AMPK pathway. The AMPK pathway is
  the target of multiple miRNAs, which regulate the expression of key regulators in
  the pathway. Changes in miRNA expression resulting from pharmacological intervention
  or changes in blood glucose levels can release the suppression on the system resulting
  in enhance AMPK expression and activation.'
