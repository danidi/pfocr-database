caption: Schematic depicting model of mechanism of protection of cardiovascular tissues
  by EETs. These endogenous fatty acids are products of the cytochrome P450 family
  2 enzymes (CYP2). They activate at least 2 intracellular signaling systems, the
  PI3K/Akt pathway and KATP channels, based on our results (-) and as marked by solid
  arrows. In addition, they preserve mitochondrial membrane potential from depolarization
  by injurious oxidants (). Inhibition of either pathway, PI3K or KATP channels abolishes
  the protective effect of EETs. We speculate (as shown by dotted lines) that this
  may occur via complementary intermediates that are generated by PI3K and KATP channels
  (and probably other signaling systems that are activated by EETs) to act in concert.
  Therefore multiple parallel signaling pathways such as PI3K and KATP channels may
  converge, rather than act in series, to either reverse cellular injury or block
  cell death.
