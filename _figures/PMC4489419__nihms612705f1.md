caption: 'A speculative model of FGF23 gene transcriptional regulation. Four activating
  mutations or pathways (involving FGFR-1, Gαs encoded by GNAS, PTH/PTHr receptor
  and HMW-FGF-2) and four inactivating mutations (involving PHEX, DMP-1, E-NPP1 and
  ANK-1) are associated with increased FGF-23 expression in bone. Local bone-derived
  factors that are linked to mineralization are shown on the right-hand side. ANK-1
  and E-NPP1 regulate the transport and biosynthesis of pyrophosphate, and TNAP regulates
  the conversion of pyrophosphate to phosphate in the extracellular matrix mineralization
  process, whereas both PHEX and DMP-1 regulate bone mineralization through mechanisms
  that remain to be fully elucidated. Evidence exists in osteoblasts derived from
  the Hyp mouse model that defective mineralization is linked to the activation of
  FGFR-1 as well as HMW-FGF-2 integrative nuclear signaling pathways. The left-hand
  side of the figure shows systemic factors involved in FGF-23 regulation. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
  D is an important regulator of FGF-23 expression, acting through the VDR and VDRE.
  PTH can also stimulate FGF-23 through a sclerostin-dependent mechanism involving
  the Wnt–β-catenin pathway, or through stimulation of GNAS and cAMP-dependent signaling
  pathways, as well as indirectly through stimulation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
  Intrinsic and systemic factors are integrated at the levels of cis-acting elements
  in the proximal FGF23 promoter that remain to be elucidated. A question mark (?)
  indicates areas of uncertainty. Abbreviations: Hyp, mouse model of X-linked hypophosphatemic
  rickets; PO4, phosphate; PPi, pyrophosphate; TK, tyrosine kinase.'
