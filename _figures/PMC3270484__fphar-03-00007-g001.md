caption: 'The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg)–VTA pathway in aversion and reward
  mechanisms: possible role of endocannabinoids. (A) γ-Aminobutyric (GABA) neurons
  in the RMTg receive a major glutamatergic (GLU) input from lateral habenula (LHb),
  show phasic activation after aversive stimuli and inhibit ventral tegmental area
  (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons. The inset displays oscilloscope traces recorded from
  a DA neuron inhibited for ∼ 100 ms following RMTg stimulation. The graphs represent
  rate histograms recorded from RMTg and DA neurons and show increase or decrease
  in firing rate, respectively, following a painful stimulus (paw pinch). Rate histograms
  and oscilloscope traces are adapted from Lecca et al. (,). We hypothesize that pauses
  in DA neuron firing rate, which are known to encode reward omission and punishment,
  might be mediated by the RMTg and regulated by endocannabinoids (i.e., 2-arachidonoylglycerol,
  2-AG) activating presynaptic CB1 receptors. DA neurons receive also important glutamatergic
  afferents arising from various brain regions. Glutamatergic terminals are also endowed
  with presynaptic CB1 receptors. (B) Acute drug administration or reinstatement of
  drug self-administration excite DA neurons and DA release in terminal regions. On
  the other hand, addicting drugs also inhibit RMTg neurons (Lecca et al., ) and/or
  suppress RMTg-induced inhibition of DA neurons (Lecca et al., ), contributing to
  their excitation via a disinhibition mechanism. The oscilloscope traces in the inset
  show that RMTg-induced inhibition of the same DA neuron as in (A) is attenuated
  following cannabinoid administration (from Lecca et al., ). Hence, we hypothesize
  that endocannabinoids might modulate the strength of these inhibitory afferents
  via long- or short-term forms of synaptic plasticity (such as depolarization-induced
  suppression of inhibition, DSI or long-term depression of GABA afferents, LTDGABA,
  respectively). The picture is further complicated, however, by the fact that endocannabinoids
  also modulate glutamatergic afferents, inducing functionally opposite forms of synaptic
  plasticity (such as depolarization-induced suppression of excitation, DSE or long-term
  depression of glutamatergic afferents, LTD).'
