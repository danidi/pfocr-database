caption: 'The biosynthetic pathway was modified according to the pathways proposed
  in Amorphophallus konjac. GM or GGM biosynthesis is supposed to be generated from
  sucrose, mainly produced by photosynthesis in the leaf tissue (). The enzymes indicated
  in red are highly expressed in the stem. Only abbreviations of gene names are shown:
  Csl, Cellulose synthase like gene; FRK, fructokinase; Fru, fructose; Fru-6-P, Fructose-6-phosphate;
  GGP, GDP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase; GMPP, GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase; GT, glycosyltransferase;
  HXK, hexokinase; INV, invertase; MSR, mannan synthesis-related; PGI, phosphoglucose
  isomerase; PGM, phosphoglucomutase; PMI, phosphomannose isomerase; PMM, phosphomannomutase;
  RWA, Reduced Wall Acetylation proten; SuS, sucrose synthase; UGE, UDP-galactose
  epimerase; UGP, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase.'
