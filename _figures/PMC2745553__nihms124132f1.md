caption: Diagrammatic representation of the effect of Ang II and arachidonic acid
  in the control of blood pressure in relation to HO-1. The increase of HO-1 increases
  Ferritin synthesis and anti-inflammatory properties, as a result of sequestering
  iron. CO and bilirubin will increase pAKT and BCL-2, which are antiapoptotic signaling
  molecules. CO also has antiinflammatory properties. Bilirubin and CO prevent endothelial
  damage and sloughing in conditions such as hypertension via an increase in extracellular
  superoxide dismutase and attenuate oxidation of low-density protein in renal interlobar
  arteries and various renal vessels. Increase of HO-1 in the vascular system will
  attenuate the generation of various constrictor molecules, such as prostaglandin
  (PG) E2 (COX-2), 20-HETE, and CYP450. HO-1 induction decreases the levels of inducible
  proteins, including inducible NO synthase (iNOS), COX-2, and CYP4A type (prohyperten-sive),
  but not the expoxygenase pathway and the generation of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids
  (EETs), (antihypertensive) and subsequently decreases the vasoconstriction effect
  of Ang II. Finally, at the vascular level, HO-1 targeting to the endothelium may
  prevent endothelial cell death and restore vascular integrity.
