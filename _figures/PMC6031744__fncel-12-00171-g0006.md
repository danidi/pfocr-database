caption: 'Vesicle pools and endocytic pathways at the calyx of Held. A typical presynaptic
  bouton of the calyx of Held contains ~550 active zones. At each active zone, 4–10
  vesicle constitute the RRP and can fuse in response to a single 20 ms depolarizing
  pulse. An additional 10–16 vesicles are utilized following 5 min stimulation at
  2 Hz, and therefore belong to the recycling pool. Roughly 320 vesicles per active
  zone are in the reserve pool. Three endocytic pathways exist at the calyx of Held:
  a fast pathway (τfast ≈ 1–2 s) triggered by single or brief trains of action potentials,
  a slow pathway (τslow ≈ 12–23 s) triggered by 20 ms depolarizing pulses, and an
  additional fast pathway (τfast ≈ 1.1–2 s) triggered by repeated 20 ms pulses or
  high-frequency action potential trains. The fast pathway triggered by single action
  potentials likely represents ultrafast endocytosis. The slow pathway is likely operated
  by activity-dependent bulk endocytosis and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The additional
  fast pathway induced by intense stimulation might be a dynamin-independent and actin-dependent
  form of bulk endocytosis.'
