caption: 'Schematic model showing glucose sensing signaling pathways that might modulate
  neuronal activity of central olfactory areas. Two types of glucose transporters
  and their associated downstream cellular processes are observed in central olfactory
  areas. SGLT1, located in the OB, is electrogenic and combines glucose (Gluc: blue
  triangle) translocation with an influx of Na+. GLUT4, located mainly in the OB and
  PC, is non-electrogenic and is associated with the insulin pathway. Indeed, insulin
  (Ins, red triangle) binding to its receptor (IR: insulin receptor) depolarizes MCs
  through Kv1.3 channel closure and induces GLUT4 translocation to the membrane. Glucose
  intake increases as well as the mitochondrial production of ATP and the cytosolic
  protein kinase A (PKA). Activation: blue arrow, inhibition: red line. Direct and
  indirect action of one molecule: full and dotted line respectively.'
