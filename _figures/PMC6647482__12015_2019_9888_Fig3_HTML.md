caption: The interplay between purinergic signaling and ComC activation during sterile
  brain inflammation. Increase in extracellular ATP secreted level in brain tissue
  stimulates via P2X7 receptor Nlrp3 inflammasome in microglia cells. Activated microglia
  secrete IL-1, IL-18 and ROS that promote sterile inflammation in brain parenchyma.
  Microglia cells also release HMGB1 and S100a9 that as DAMPs activate MBL pathway
  of ComC activation. Release of ComC proteins cleavage fragments such as C3a and
  C5a anaphylatoxins maintains sterile inflammation state of brain
