caption: Protein trafficking of pericellular proteases. Pericellular proteases are
  synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported through the Golgi
  complex to the trans-Golgi-network (TGN). (1) Membrane-associated proteases are
  activated by furin in the TGN and reach the cell surface as active proteases. (2)
  Alternatively, membrane-associated proteases can be transported to the cell surface
  as inactive precursor proteins and are proteolytically activated in the pericellular
  space. (3) Classically secreted proteases are transported to the plasma membrane
  (PM) through the constitutive secretory pathway and are proteolytically activated
  in the pericellular space following secretion. Proteases that are typically localized
  to endosomes or lysosomes can be transported to the extracellular space through
  alternative trafficking via the secretory pathway (4) or through lysosomal exocytosis
  (5). Lysosomal proteases that reach the extracellular space via the secretory pathway
  are secreted as proenzymes and require proteolytic activation, while proteases that
  trafficked through the lysosome are activated within the lysosome and secreted as
  active enzymes. Secreted proteases can be tethered to the PM through interacting
  partners such as CD44, integrins, or annexin II (An II) (6) or through binding to
  ECM components (7). (8) Some secreted proteases are bound to specific receptors;
  e.g., uPA binds to uPAR. (9) Proteases can also be released through exosomes that
  originate from multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which leads to secretion into the extracellular
  space or transfer to adjacent cells. Accumulation or localized release of pericellular
  proteases is associated with PM microdomains such as invadopodia (actin-rich protrusions)
  (10) or caveolae (a subset of lipid rafts) (11), which are represented at higher
  magnification in the bottom panels.
