caption: MAPK signalling cascades leading to MK5 activation. Mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase kinases 1-4 (MEKK1-4), the dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK), the mixed
  lineage kinase (MLK2), the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8 (Tpl-2),
  the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), the transforming growth factor-β-activated
  protein kinase (TAK1) and the serine/threonine-protein kinase (TAO1/2) phosphorylates
  and activates dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase3/6 (MEK3/6),
  which in turn phosphorylates and activates p38 α, β, δ and γ. p38 will then phosphorylate
  and activate mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases 1/2 (MSK1/2), the MAPK-interacting
  kinase 1 (MNK1), MAPK-activated protein kinases 2/3 (MK2/3), and MAPK-activated
  protein kinase 5 (MK5). In addition to the p38 pathway MK5 can also be activated
  by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 3/4 (ERK3/4). ERK3/4 are activated by
  p21-activated kinases 1/2/3 (PAK 1/2/3). The kinase/kinases activating PAK is currently
  unknown. Dotted line indicates that although activation has been reported, it has
  to be thoroughly investigated, while solid lines indicate validated activations.
