caption: “Confidence view” of the protein-protein interaction network on String.The
  thickness of the blue line between 2 nodes indicates the level of confidence of
  association between these 2. The greater the thickness, the higher the level of
  confidence. The confidence score for each interaction indicates the prediction of
  a link between 2 nodes in the same metabolic pathway at the level of the KEGG database.
  The size differs between proteins of which the 3-dimensional structure (large sized)
  is known. Nodes whose 3-dimensional structure is not yet available are small sized.
