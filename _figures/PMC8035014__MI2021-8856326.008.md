caption: The immune regulatory activity of TCM formula ZQT in TME. ZQT induces the
  apoptosis of G-MDSCs via the STAT3/S100A9/Bcl-2/caspase-3 signaling pathway, resulting
  in a significant decrease in G-MDSCs and their immunosuppressive activity, consequently
  promoting the infiltration and killing activity of CD8+ T cells, leading to the
  inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells.
