caption: PD-1 in T-cell activation, exhaustion, and effector function. (a) T cells
  are activated via (i) binding of MHC plus peptide on an APC to the TCR and then
  (ii) binding of APC CD80/86 to T-cell CD28. In patients with cancer, tumor cells
  can also serve as APCs. Upon T-cell activation, PD-1 expression is induced. (b)
  In situations of chronic infection or persistent stimulation, PD-L1 signals through
  T-cell PD-1 to “turn off” T cells in order to minimize damage to healthy tissue
  (activation signaling is blocked). Tumor cells can upregulate PD-L1 in order to
  “turn off” T cells that might destroy them. (c) Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling
  pathway allows T cells to maintain their effector functions. In patients with cancer,
  activated tumor-specific T cells can kill tumor cells and secrete cytokines that
  activate/recruit other immune cells to participate in the antitumor response. APC,
  antigen-presenting cell; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; MHC, major histocompatibility complex;
  PD-1, programmed death-1; PD-L1, PD ligand 1; TCR, T-cell receptor. Reprinted from
