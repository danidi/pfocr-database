caption: 'Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells under hypoxia. A, low O2 levels
  promote glucose uptake, glycolysis, lactate secretion, glutamine import, and glutaminolysis.
  Glucose can be stored as glycogen macromolecules, which are essential to maintain
  ATP levels and redox balance in hypoxic conditions. In addition, glycolytic enzymes
  FBP1 and PKM2 regulate HIFα activity through direct physical interaction. Moreover,
  cells exhibit increased rates of reductive carboxylation upon O2 deficiency. For
  lipid metabolism, hypoxic cells generate citrate from glutamine, and acetyl-CoA
  from acetate to compensate for decreased supply of these molecules from the TCA
  cycle. SCD1 activity is affected directly by changes in O2 availability. However,
  hypoxia results in increased lipid uptake, which counteracts the effects of SCD1
  inhibition. The following genes are regulated by HIF: GLUTs (including GLUT1 and
  GLUT3), HK, PGM1, GYS1, PFK1, FBP1, PKM2, LDHA, PDK1, PDH, and MCT4. Also ACSS2,
  ACC, FASN, SCD1, IDH, and αKGDH protein expression/activity is directly or indirectly
  regulated by low O2 levels. One-headed arrows indicate single-direction reactions,
  and two-headed arrows represent those that are reversible. In addition, arrows with
  slashes indicate multistep reactions. B, enzymatic and cofactor requirements for
  l-2HG metabolism. The following abbreviations and names are used in figure: GLUT,
  glucose transporter; HK, hexokinase; PPP, pentose phosphate pathway; PGM1, phosphoglucomutase
  1; GYS1, glycogen synthase 1; GP, glycogen phosphorylase; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate;
