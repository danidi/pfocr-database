caption: Putative core betalain biosynthetic pathway in plants. S, spontaneous reaction;
  the primary enzymatic reactions are tyrosine hydroxylating activity (TyH), the enzyme
  for which has not been unequivocally determined; CYP76AD1, a cytochrome P450 enzyme
  that catalyzes oxidation of L-DOPA for the formation of cyclo-DOPA; and DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase
  (DOD) catalyzing the cleavage of L-DOPA needed for the formation of betalamic acid.
  Betacyanins normally accumulate as glycosides and may also be acylated. Regarding
  glucosylation at the 5-O-position, it appears that it is primarily done by cyclo-DOPA
  5-O-glucosyltransferase (5GT) prior to the conjugation that forms the betacyanin.

  the key biosynthetic gene DOD as belonging to an expanded LigB gene family that
  is conserved in betalain-producing species.
