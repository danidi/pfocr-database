caption: 'Reactive oxygen species- (ROS-) mediated inhibition of glycolysis reroutes
  flux into the oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway. The enzymes inhibited
  by ROS are shown. ROS inhibits phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) and inactivates glyceraldehyde
  3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the pyruvate kinase isoform PKM2 by directly
  targeting cysteine residues. Thus, this glycolytic inhibition promotes flux into
  the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to produce NADPH and fuel cellular
  antioxidant systems (for example NADPH is consumed by glutathione reductase (GSR)
  to recycle oxidized glutathione (GSSG)). PKM2 inhibition is unique in that it allows
  for a diversion of flux into the serine synthesis pathway. Serine not only contributes
  to the synthesis of macromolecules but is also a precursor for glutathione (GSH).
  Serine synthesis is activated by a buildup of 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG), which prevents
  3-phosphoglycerate- (3PG-) induced inhibition of the oxidative pentose phosphate
  arm. PPP: pentose phosphate pathway; HK: hexokinase; G6PD: glucose-6 phosphate dehydrogenase;
