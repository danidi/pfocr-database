caption: Cardiolipin oxidation and cytochrome c release in the mitochondrial pathway
  to apoptosis. A second, complementary model for redox signaling for apoptosis involves
  cytochrome c and the mitochondrial-specific phospholipid cardiolipin. Under normal
  conditions, cytochrome c binds cardiolipin through loose, electrostatic interactions.
  In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, a tighter interaction develops. This partially
  unfolds the cytochrome c and converts it to a peroxidase with cardiolipin as the
  substrate. Oxidized cardiolipin has a reduced affinity for cytochrome c, which then
  becomes soluble in the intermembrane space. Mitochondrial membrane lipids are reorganized
  during apoptosis. Oxidized cardiolipin appears in the outer mitochondrial membrane
  and attracts the pro-apoptotic protein tBID, thus facilitating release of cytochrome
  c and other apoptotic proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space.
