caption: Blood coagulation (Thrombosis) and atherosclerosis (arterial disease characterized
  by the deposition of plaques of fatty material on their inner walls) pathway in
  vivo showing central role played by Thrombin. X111 represent fibrin stabilizing
  factor (enzyme responsible for blood coagulation). The   Sign shows the sponge derived
  compounds.
