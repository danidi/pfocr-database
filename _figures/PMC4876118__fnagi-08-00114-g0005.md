caption: 'The Retino-Hypothalamo-Pineal (RHP) Pathway (depicted by pink dotted lines):
  The retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) (green dotted line) is the first segment of the
  RHP pathway, which connects the eye to the hypothalamus. Photons activate melanopsin-expressing
  retinal ganglion cells (mRGC) which project through the optic nerve to 2nd order
  neurons in the SCN. SCN neurons then project to 3rd order neurons in the paraventricular
  nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These neurons further project to 4th order preganglionic
  sympathetic neurons in intermediolateral zone of the thoracic lateral horns of the
  spinal cord. These neurons then project to 5th order postganglionic neurons in the
  superior cervical ganglia, which then project to 6th order cells (pinealocytes)
  in the pineal gland, thus making the neurohormone melatonin (Adapted and published
