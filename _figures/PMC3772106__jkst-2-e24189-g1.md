caption: Figure 1. Schematic overview of 25HC-mediated antiviral activity. Upon viral
  infections in cells, exposed dsRNA is sensed by TLR3 and results in the expression
  of type I IFN. Secreted type I IFN subsequently binds to its receptor, IFNAR, on
  cell surfaces and activates the JAK-STAT1 signaling pathway. Blanc et al. discovered
  that STAT1 directly regulates the expression of Ch25h. 25HC, which is catalyzed
  by Ch25h, exerts antiviral activities such as the inhibition of viral replication
  and cell-to-cell spreading.
