caption: Model of the impact of 5q deletion upon myeloid cell fate. A schematic diagram
  showing some of the factors that regulate myeloid cell fate (adapted from P. Laslo
  et al., 2006). PU.1 normally induces EGR2 and NAB2 to induce monocytic differentiation.
  CEBPA and GFI1 promote granulocytic differentiation, partially through suppression
  of EGR1, EGR2 and NAB2. Knockdown of Hnrnpa0 in murine cells leads to the suppression
  of pro-monocytic transcripts (Egr2, Nab2, Irf8, and Emr1 (F4/80)), many of which
  contain AREs (light gray boxes), and induction of pro-granulocytic genes (Cebpa,
  Gfi1, Csf3r (G-CSFR)). MAPK-induced phosphorylation of CEBPA has been shown to inhibit
  granulopoeisis. KD of Hnrnpa0 leads to a decreased expression of many genes within
  the MAPK signaling pathway, consistent with the observed shift towards granulocytic
  differentiation. Loss of EGR1 (also mapped to human 5q) also favors granulocytic
  over monocytic differentiation. Egr1 and Egr2 function in a redundant manner. In
  del(5q) patients, haploinsufficiency for both EGR1 and HNRNPA0 may synergistically
  disrupt myeloid differentiation.
