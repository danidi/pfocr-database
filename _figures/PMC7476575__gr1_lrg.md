caption: Non-photosynthetic CO2 ConversionThe reductive acetyl-CoA pathway, also known
  as the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP), converts two CO2 molecules, via the methyl
  and the carbonyl branches, into one acetic acid. The one-carbon units in the methyl
  branch are bound to and carried by tetrahydrofolate (not depicted). The CO2-derived
  acetic acid can be fed to other microbes for synthesis of more advanced products.
