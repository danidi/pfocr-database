caption: Working model of the pathways by which PTHrP functions in the exocrine pancreas.
  Pancreatic damage induced by injurious agents such as alcohol results in upregulation
  of PTHrP expression. PTHrP may be targeted directly at the transcriptional and/or
  post-transcriptional levels, or may be upregulated downstream of cytokines whose
  levels are elevated as a result of pancreatic damage, including TNF-α and TGF-β.
  PTHrP released by acinar cells in turn functions via an autocrine and/or paracrine
  pathway to induce cytokine and chemokine release, leading to an inflammatory response.
  Acinar cell-secreted PTHrP may also function by a paracrine pathway to activate
  PSCs. PSCs also release PTHrP in response to injury, leading to their activation.
  The net result is development of Acute Pancreatitis. Further exposure to risk factors,
  accompanied by release of PTHrP, would perpetuate the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic
  response. These multiple episodes of acute pancreatitis (Recurrent Acute Pancreatitis)
  may eventually lead to Chronic Pancreatitis, with chronic inflammation and scarring.
  Since a history of pancreatitis is a significant risk factor for PDA, preventing
  or limiting development of CP through prophylactic use of inhibitors of the PTHrP
  signaling pathway may reduce the risk for this cancer.
