caption: TGFβsignaling pathway in male Schistosoma mansoni showing signaling from
  the female to the male that contributes to parasite pairing (based on experimental
  data). The cartoon depicts surface-exposed tegument of the gynecophoric canal. SmTGFβtype
  II receptor (RII) binds a parasite or a host TGFβ ligand (SmInAct, hTGFβ1). The
  ligand/RII complex triggers the interaction with a type I receptor (RIA; SmTβRI),
  phosphorylates and activates it. The activated type I receptor relays the signal
  down to a R-Smad (RIA to SmSmad2), where the SmSmad2 is activated via phosphorylation.
  The activated SmSmad2 interacts with the co-Smad (SmSmad4) in the subtegument. The
  SmSmad complex translocates to the nucleus of the sub-tegumental cell, binds nuclear
  partners and the assembled transcription complex binds to the Smad binding element
  in the promoter of the target gene (SmGCP) and regulates target gene transcription.
  The SmGCP transcript is translated and the protein transported to the surface of
  the gynecophoric canal where it facilitates worm pairing. See text and [, , ] for
  further details.(modified from []).
