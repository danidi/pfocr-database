caption: The left cell represents a vegetative cell while the right a nitrogen-fixing
  heterocyst. Red color indicates pseudogenes lacking a functional counterpart in
  the NoAz genome. Orange indicates pseudogenes where a functional counterpart is
  present elsewhere in the genome. Fully functional gene(s) are illustrated (blue)
  only if their function is linked to other processes in the figure. The localization
  of pathways in vegetative cells or heterocysts is representative only for nitrogen
  fixation (heterocysts) and PSII activity (vegetative cells). Note that only a minor
  part of the nitrogen fixed in heterocysts is incorporated using the GS-GOGAT pathway
  and used for synthesis of amino acids, while most is exported to the plant as NH3.
  Sugar is provided by the plant in an as yet unknown form; putatively imported via
  the sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). Function has been lost in the glycolytic
  pathway as the pfkA gene, encoding 6-phosphofructokinase, is a pseudogene and sugar
  metabolism in the Azolla cyanobiont probably proceeds via the Oxidative Pentose
  Phosphate Pathway (OPPP). Extensive loss of function is evident among genes involved
  in uptake and transport of nutrients and NoAz has lost the capacity to both import
  and metabolise alternative nitrogen sources.  shows detailed information on genes
  indicated in the figure and their closest homologs in other filamentous heterocystous
  cyanobacteria.
