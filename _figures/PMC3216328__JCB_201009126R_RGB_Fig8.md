caption: A model of the function of PI3K signaling in invadopodia formation and cell
  invasion. p110α that is activated downstream of growth factor receptors produces
  the signaling lipid PI(3,4,5)P3 to regulate invadopodia formation and cancer cell
  invasion. PI(3,4)P2 that is generated via dephosphorylation of PI(3,4,5)P3 by synaptojanin-2
  (SJ2) may regulate invadopodia formation through the Tks5/N-WASP axis in parallel
  with PI(3,4,5)P3. PDK1 and Akt are activated by both PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 and
  act as mediators of the PI3K signaling pathway for invadopodia formation.
