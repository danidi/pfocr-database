caption: 'Outline of T-cell development pathway from bone marrow to the thymus. Lympho-hematopoietic
  progenitor cells leave the bone marrow for the thymus. Intrathymic T-cell development
  includes starting with none of CD4 and CD8 markers (double negative, DN), then gaining
  both CD4 and CD8 (double positive, DP), to losing one of them (single positive,
  SP). In the DN stage, there are four subsets: DN1, DN2, DN3, and DN4, based on the
  gain and loss of CD44 and/or CD25. DN1 contains CD117+ and CD117− subsets. The figure
  shows CD117+ DN1, which is the canonical subset giving rise to DN2. Expression of
  Bcl11b gene was shown to be increased from DN2 to DN3 stage and subsequently maintained
  at a high level based on the Li et al.''s paper (2010).'
