caption: Hedgehog pathway activation through the primary cilium. When the Hedgehog
  pathway is off, patched (PTCH1) localizes to the primary cilium and prevents Smoothened
  (SMO) from entering the cilium. Simultaneously, suppressor of fused homolog (SUFU)
  binds to and inhibits the activity of glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) transcription
  factors. Hedgehog ligands (HH) activate the pathway by binding to PTCH1, causing
  it to leave the cilium, and allowing SMO to enter. SMO in turn activates GLI proteins,
  allowing for the transcription of Hedgehog target genes
