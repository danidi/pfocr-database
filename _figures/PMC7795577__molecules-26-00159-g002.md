caption: Possible pathway of the antioxidant and neuroprotective action of the EDR
  peptide in Alzheimer’s disease, associated with impaired MAPK signaling. The EDR
  peptide can exert neuroprotective and antioxidant effects in AD by regulating the
  expression of ERK1/2, which is evidenced by experimental data. Kinases JNK, p38,
  ERK5 are involved in the regulation of oxidative stress in neurons. Currently, the
  effect of the EDR peptide on these kinases has not been studied. However, it can
  be assumed that the antioxidant properties of the EDR peptide are associated with
  direct or indirect regulation of the functions of JNK, p38 and ERK5.
