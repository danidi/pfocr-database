caption: Cif inhibits host cell cycle progression. Cif induces the accumulation of
  p21 and p27 that inhibits CDK1-CyclinB and CDK2-CyclinA/E. Since these complexes
  are responsible for G2/M and G1/S transitions, Cif provokes an accumulation of cells
  arrested in G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle.
