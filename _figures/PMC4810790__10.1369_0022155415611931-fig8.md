caption: Schematic model showing the roles of HFD-induced obesity and IL-6 knockout
  in mouse bone remodeling. IL-6 deficiency enhances bone formation by promoting osteoblastogenesis
  and suppressing bone resorption through an inhibition of osteoclastic ability and
  viability. In this process, the increase in osteoclastogenesis associated with enhanced
  osteoblastogenesis through the RANKL/OPG pathway cannot compensate for the reduced
  bone resorption that results from the decreased osteoclast activity; this, together,
  leads to the bone abnormalities observed in IL-6-/- mice. HFD-induced obesity restores
  the changes that occur in response to IL-6 deficiency through an inhibition of osteoblastogenesis
  and an increase in osteoclast action, such as osteoclastic resorptive ability and
  improved cell viability. These changes counteract the effects of IL-6 deficiency
  and thereby lead to the appearance of a relatively normal phenotype in tibial microstructure
  in IL-6-/- mice.
