caption: 'Various agonists or stimuli bind and activate their respective receptors,
  leading to the activation of the SK/S1P pathway by both known and unknown mechanisms.
  Shown are molecules implicated in the phosphorylation (ERK and PKC) and/or the activation
  (PLD) of SK. Once activated by phosphorylation or by undefined mechanisms, SK is
  thought to translocate to the plasma membrane where it comes into contact with its
  substrate, sphingosine. SK then catalyzes the formation of S1P, which can act as
  an intracellular signaling molecule, or it can be exported via ABCC transporters
  to act in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Once activated, S1PRs elicit specific
  G-protein-mediated signals and this is followed by receptor internalization. Receptors
  are then recycled or degraded. ERK: extracellular regulated kinase; PKC: protein
  kinase c; PLD: phospholipase D; SK: sphingosine kinase; S1P: sphingosine 1-phosphate;
  S1PRs: sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors.'
