caption: The canonical pathway has potential Δ4 and Δ5 subpathways. The enzymes that
  catalyze each step are indicated within the arrows. Enzymes written in black on
  a gray arrow are essential components of the canonical pathway, and some appear
  in both canonical and backdoor pathways (e.g., CYP17A1). Enzymes written in black
  on a green background are specific to the backdoor pathway. Enzymes in gray text
  will carry out the described conversion, but they may not be the principal enzyme
  involved. Other enzymes, not shown, may also be involved in components of the backdoor
  pathway []. Human CYP17A1 can convert progesterone to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, but
  17–20 lyase activity is very low with 17α-hydroxyprogesterone as substrate, and
  significant androstenedione is not produced by the Δ4pathway in humans []. Similarly,
  17OHDHP is a poor substrate for 17–20 lyase activity []. androstanediol, 5α-androstan-3α,
  17β-diol; androstanedione, 5α-androstane-3,17-dione; androstenediol, androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol;
  DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; DHT, dihydrotestosterone; 5αDHP, 5α-dihydroprogesterone;
  17OHDHP, 17α-hydroxydihydroprogesterone.
