caption: Principles of JAK/STAT signaling. Upon binding of a cytokine to its receptor
  (1) conformational changes lead to JAK auto- or transphosphorylation (2) and subsequent
  phosphorylation of the receptor by JAKs (3). This creates binding sites for STAT
  molecules, which are also phosphorylated by JAKs (4). Phosphorylated STATs dimerize
  (5) and translocate to the nucleus, where they control transcription by directly
  binding to the DNA (6).
