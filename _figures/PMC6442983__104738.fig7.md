caption: 'Proposed model for the induction of the Vps34-autophagy pathway in ETV6
  RUNX1-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) cells. The
  ETV6-RUNX1 fusion protein can transcriptionally induce the expression of various
  transcription factors, including GATA1, GATA2, HEY1, and EGR1. ETV6-RUNX1 and its
  co-factor CBFβ, together with GATA1, HEY1 and EGR1 can activate the Vps34 promoter,
  resulting in enhanced Vps34 expression in ETV6-RUNX1-positive leukemic cells. Vps34,
  in turn, can initiate autophagy by forming a core autophagy-regulating complex with
  Beclin 1 and Vps15. This complex plays an important role in: 1) the early initiation
  (in complex with Atg14L); and 2) the vesicle elongation phase (together with UVRAG)
  of autophagosome formation. Induction of autophagy allows ETV6-RUNX1-positive cells
  to maintain homeostasis by degrading and recycling damaged proteins and organelles.
  In addition, activation of the autophagy program in ETV6-RUNX1-positive cells results
  in enhanced proliferation, survival and drug resistance. Inhibition of autophagy
  in ETV6-RUNX1-positive cells, by treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or knockdown
  of Vps34, is sufficient to reduce proliferation and survival of leukemic blasts
  and to induce sensitization to L-Asparaginase.'
