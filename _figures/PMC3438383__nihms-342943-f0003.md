caption: Biosynthetic gene cluster for TDP-desosamine from Streptomyces venezuelae
  (A). Summary of results for the gene knockout experiment to determine the biosynthetic
  pathway of TDP-desosamine (5) as well as an early mechanistic hypotheses for the
  deamination reaction of DesII inspired by the mechanisms of the E1/E3 system and
  lysine 2,3-aminomutase (B). The currently accepted biosynthetic transformations
  of DesI and DesII (C). See text for additional details.
