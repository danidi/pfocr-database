caption: Cellular and molecular features of autophagy. Autophagy can be triggered
  by various stimuli, including starvation, oxidative stress, pathogens, or pathogen-derived
  products. The autophagic signaling process can also be initiated in response to
  intracellular staphylococci and their secreted toxins. Release of toxins and other
  virulence determinants presumably prevents maturation of autophagosomes thereby
  boosting staphylococcal escape from these structures. Key factors and crucial steps
  of the autophagy pathway are highlighted.
