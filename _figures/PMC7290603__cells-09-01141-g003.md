caption: Impact of tumor-derived EVs in Cancer Therapy Resistance. EVs secreted from
  the few drug resistant (DR) cancer cells (on the left) or by normal cells within
  the tumor microenvironment (on the right) can contribute to exacerbate resistance
  in otherwise drug sensitive cancer cells (centre). (a) Exacerbated production of
  EVs by drug resistant cancer cell clones carrying on their surface the same tumour
  markers. These EVs will be targeted by certain monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics
  (e.g., trastuzumab, rituximab, etc.) and act as decoy receptors, lowering the availability
  of these targeted therapies to cancer cells. Additionally, in DR EVs (b) the drug
  efflux pumps may be inverted in the membrane of exosomes due to their biogenesis,
  when compared to their normal orientation in their donor cells. This can promote
  cytoplasmatic drug-influx into those EVs that will act as a drug efflux delivery
  system. EVs from a minor fraction of cancer drug resistant clones will (c) transfer
  functional drug efflux pumps (e.g., MDR1, MRP1, BCRP) to drug sensitive recipient
  cancer cells. This will enable recipient cells to efflux the drugs reducing the
  intracellular drug concentrations to sublethal levels. DR cancer cells can (d) promote
  the induction of anti-apoptotic pathways in recipient drug sensitive cells by transferring
  anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., XIAPs, Bcl2, IAPs, Survivin, etc.). (e) Drug resistant
  clones also transfer TrpC5 protein through EVs to drug sensitive counterparts, activating
  the transcription factor NFATc3 and MDR1 gene expression. This will originate MDR1
  efflux pumps production in recipient cells. (f) DR cell-derived EVs carry miR-31-5p
  that when internalized by drug sensitive counterparts promote down-regulation of
  MLH1 and consequently inhibit the mismatch repair system. This can lead to increased
  genomic instability and an aggressive phenotype in recipient cells. (g) DR cell-derived
  EVs have increased levels of GSTP1 mRNA/proteins that improve reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) detoxification in drug sensitive cells. Within the tumour microenvironment,
  stromal cells secrete EVs that will support a drug resistance phenotype in otherwise
  drug sensitive cancer cells. Indeed, (h) EVs from Cancer-associated Fibroblasts
  (CAFs) carry lncRNAs that will activate the β-catenin pathway in recipient cells
  inducing a cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Similarly, (i) EVs shed from Mesenchymal
  Stromal Cells (MSCs) have in their cargo miR-222/miR-223 and ZEB1 mRNA or (j) EVs
  secreted by monocytes carry miR155 that enable cancer resistance to several drugs
  (e.g., gemcitabine and cisplatin).
