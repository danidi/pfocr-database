caption: Proposed mechanistic pathway of HMGB1-mediated signaling in human fetal cells.
  In Phase 1, infectious or non-infectious risk factors associated with spontaneous
  preterm birth and preterm premature rupture of the membranes cause reactive oxygen
  species (ROS) formation from mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial origins in fetal
  membrane cells (44). This ROS causes nuclear HMGB1 to translocate into the cytoplasm.
  In the cytoplasm, HMGB1 is acetylated or modified by lysosomes and secreted either
  due to cellular injury (necrosis) or through carriers. HMGB1 can also be secreted
  in the non-acetylated form. In Phase 2, a feed-forward loop can be established by
  HMGB1 to enhance the inflammatory condition of the fetal cells. Depending on the
  concentration, HMGB1 mediates an inflammatory condition to neighboring cells. Higher
  concentrations of HMGB1 induce TLR2 and lower concentrations promote TLR4-mediated
  signaling resulting in p38MAPK activation mediated through activation of MAPK series
  of signaling molecules (MAPKKK →MAPKK →MAPK) (45). p38MAPK can lead to development
  of senescence phenotype (SP) in human fetal cells. Senescing cells cause a unique
  inflammatory signature that is known as “Senescence Associated Secretory Phenotype
  (SASP)”. With SASP, a unique set of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth
  factors, angiogenic factors and matrix degrading enzymes and their inhibitors may
  be activated independently through the p38MAPK pathway or with possible involvement
  of the NF-κB pathway (34; 35). In the absence of intraamniotic infection this sterile
  inflammation may produce similar outcomes as the well-defined infection-associated
  NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, with or without intraamniotic infection, this interaction
  may also activate HMGB1 and the autocrine effect of HMGB1 will continue the vicious
  cycle of inflammatory events until delivery. Inflammation seen at term, and in cases
  with PTB and pPROM, may arise from a senescence-oriented pathway mediated through
  generation of HMGB1 by oxidative stress or tissue injury.
