caption: Interactions between central nervous system, peripheral ganglia, and the
  ICNS. Multiple interdependent feedback loops regulate regional cardiac mechanical
  and electrical function. At the level of the heart, sensory (blue) neurons provide
  input directly and indirectly through the ICNS, peripheral ganglia, and spinal cord,
  which are capable of engaging cardiocentric reflexes. Converging inputs result in
  activation of adrenergic or muscarinic receptors as well as receptors for peptide
  co-transmitters such as neuropeptide Y (not displayed). Preganglionic sympathetic
  and parasympathetic efferent fibers project (red, dashed) to the ICNS, including
  to LCNs, and postganglionic sympathetic fibers (red, solid) also directly to the
  myocardium. The ICNS acts as the final common pathway for cardiac control, though
  interactions occur at all levels. Input from chemoreceptors, baroreceptors, as well
  as neurohormonal factors such as angiotensin II and circulating epinephrine (not
  displayed), also modulate cardiac function. Ang I, angiotensin I. Ang II, angiotensin
  II. LCN, local circuit neuron. Adapted from  with permission.
