caption: Figure 2. RhoA-dependent signaling induces MV biogenesis. Schematic showing
  the RhoA signaling pathway that is responsible for promoting MV formation in human
  cancer cells. The pathway culminates with the phosphorylation of cofilin, which
  inhibits its actin-severing activity. This results in increased actin polymerization
  and the generation of MVs. The ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, and LIMK siRNAs (for knocking-down
  LIMK expression) are particularly useful reagents for blocking RhoA-induced MV formation
  in cancer cells.
