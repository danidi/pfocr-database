caption: TGF-β/Smad signal transduction pathway. TGF-β signaling is initiated when
  the TGF-β ligand binds to the extracellular domain of TβRII. TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 bind
  TβRII with a high affinity, whereas TGF-β2 requires the TGF-β co-receptor betaglycan
  (TβRIII) to “present” it to TβRII. TGF-β-associated TβRII then recruits TβRI, resulting
  in the formation of a heterotetrameric receptor signaling complex comprising one
  TGF-β ligand, one homo-dimeric TβRII, and one homo-dimeric TβRI. TβRII is a constitutively
  active kinase that phosphorylates TβRI, resulting in activation of TβRI kinase activity.
  TβRI then phosphorylates intracellular Smad2 and Smad3 proteins, which, in turn,
  form a complex with Smad4 and enter the nucleus to regulate gene transcription.
  TβRII, type II TGF-β receptor. To see this illustration in color, the reader is
