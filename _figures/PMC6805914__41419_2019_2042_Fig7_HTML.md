caption: EPHB4 promote signaling through SRC-P38MAPK-4EBP1 pathway that leads to activation
  of MYC and MYC mediated metabolism for cell growth and survival in prostate cancer
  cells. DAMPs are located intracellularly and hence are unrecognizable by the immune
  system. EPHB4 inhibition decreases cap-dependent translation of MYC by suppressing
  SRC-p38MAPK-4EBP1 pathway. Suppression of SRC-p38MAPK-4EBP1 leads to a decrease
  in GLUT3 expression, which in turn leads to a reduced uptake of glucose and a drop
  in the ATP levels. This effect induces ER stress and tumor cell death characterized
  by ICD, including phosphorylation of eIF2α, increased cell surface calreticulin
  levels, and release of HMGB1 and ATP
