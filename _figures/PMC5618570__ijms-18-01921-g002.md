caption: 'Glycans and insulin/IGF system in cancer: an integrated mechanism. In a
  normal context, high levels of bisecting GlcNAc N-glycans catalyzed by GnT-III favor
  the establishment of a stable phenotype through E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion,
  which in turn promotes MGAT3 expression establishing thereby a functional feedback
  loop. Both the stable adherens junctions and IGFBP1 expression lead to the inhibition
  of IGF1R activity, which were associated with a decrease of the AKT1/mTORC1/HIF1A/HK
  axis. In a cancer context, the high levels of β1,6-branched N-glycans, catalyzed
  by GnT-V enzyme destabilizes E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion and favors the
  activation of IGF1R-mediated signaling thus increasing the AKT1/mTORC1/HIF1A/HK
  axis. Furthermore, as a consequence of the high HK activity, the hexosamine biosynthetic
  pathway (HBP) flux become higher, increasing the GlcNAc biosynthesis and the branched
  N-glycosylation. In addition, the translocation of cytoplasmic β-catenin to nucleus
  promotes inhibition of MGAT3 expression, that concomitantly with the repression
  of IGFBP1results in a positive feedback mechanism on IGFR1 activity. OGT, O-linked
  N-acetylglucosamine transferase. GnT-III catalyzes the bisecting GlcNAc N-glycan
  structure and GnT-V catalyzes the β1,6 GlcNAc branched N-glycans.'
