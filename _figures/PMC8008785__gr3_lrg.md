caption: 'The mode of action of mRNA vaccines. (a –at the injection site) Upon endocytosis
  by muscle-resident cells, mRNA LNPs trigger a transient inflammatory response recruiting
  neutrophils, monocytes and DCs to the injection site. Local and recruited APC subsets
  transiently express the S protein mRNA and undergo maturation in response to innate
  immune sensing of the mRNA. The migration of targeted/activated APCs and direct
  lymphatic transport of mRNA LNPs and cell debris containing S proteins, brings the
  S antigen to B cells and T cells in draining lymph nodes. (b – at the cellular level)
  To avoid lysosomal degradation, mRNA must escape the endosomes and binds to ribosomes,
  known as a complex and rate-limiting process, which is facilitated by the ionizable
  LNP carrier. After translation and transport of S proteins through the endoplasmatic
  reticulum and Golgi apparatus, S proteins are exposed as prefusion-stabilized trimer
  constructs at the cell surface. This membrane-bound S antigen can efficiently be
  recognized and internalized by B cells, which leads to a series of events activating
  B cells responses towards neutralizing antibody generation against the S protein.
  Moreover, the expressed S antigens can gain access to the MHC class I antigen presentation
  pathway to prime CD8+ T cells that can eliminate infected cells, while recycling
  mechanisms allow the presentation of antigenic epitopes in MHC-II complexes to CD4+
  helper T cells, especially needed to promote the antibody production by providing
  B cell help. Abbreviations: APC; Antigen presenting cell, RBD; Receptor binding
  domain, MHC; major histocompatibility complex.'
