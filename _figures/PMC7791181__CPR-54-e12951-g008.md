caption: Working model of the target interaction axis after SCI After SCI, TGF‐β1
  expression was increased, leading to phosphorylation of the Smad2/3 protein, thereby
  promoting miR‐21a‐5p upregulation. Smad7 is an inhibitor of the TGF‐β pathway that
  can be inhibited by miR‐21a‐5p. miR‐21a‐5p overexpression alleviates Smad7 inhibition
  on the TGF‐β pathway. However, the upregulated lncENSMUST00000195880, which binds
  with miR‐21a‐5p, suppresses this positive feedback loop
