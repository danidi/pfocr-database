caption: Biological model proposed for the yeast response to stress caused by inorganic
  acids. Low external pH (pHex) inhibits the action of the β-1,3-glucanosyltransferase
  Gas1p, resulting in damage to the cell wall β-glucan layer. The damage signal is
  transduced to PKC pathway through the nanomechanical sensor Wsc1p to activate the
  cell wall integrity (CWI) genes, including GAS1. In parallel, this pathway induces
  Ca2+ uptake by Slt2p-mediated activation of the Mid1p/Cch1p channel, and the imported
  Ca2+ triggers the activation of calcineurin pathway whose function in acid response
  still unknown. However, Ca2+ uptake is counteracted by the inhibitory action low
  pHex on Ca2+ channels. In consequence, limitation of Ca2+ influx jeopardises the
  activation of the P-type ATPase ion pump Pmr1p responsible for transport of Ca2+
  and Mn2+ to the Golgi apparatus, ions that are necessary for protein processing
  and trafficking through the secretory pathway, such as those involved in cell wall
  maintenance and repair. Low pHex also inhibits the H+ efflux pump Pma1p, resulting
  in the decrease of the cytosolic pH (pHc) by the lack of extrusion of H+ produced
  by glucose metabolism. Hence, low pHc reduces the PKA pathway [,], causing reduction
  or impairment in cell growth and release of general stress response (GSR) or environmental
  stress response (ESR) that work for repairing the cellular damages and maintain
  cell survival. Symbols refer to flux of molecules (yellow arrows) through transmembrane
  transporters in the cell membrane (CM), activations (green arrows) or inhibitions
  (red T-shaped lines) within regulatory pathways, and the genetic flux (blue arrows)
  from gene transcription, mRNA transport across the nuclear envelope (NE) to the
  cytosol and protein for translation protein and trafficking inside the Golgi apparatus
  to outer face of CM.
