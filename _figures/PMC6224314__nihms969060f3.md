caption: Paclitaxel facilitates binding of NCS-1 to InsP3R, thereby inducing Ca2+
  oscillations from the ER. The increased cytosolic Ca2+ is further enhanced through
  activation of Ca2+ dependent TRPV4 channels. Ca2+ activates the Ca2+ dependent protease
  calpain, which cleaves and a number of other proteins. This creates a negative feedback
  loop and impairs signaling through the InsP3R. This leads to an attenuation of Ca2+
  oscillations. Impaired signaling and further degradation of proteins lead to axonal
  damage and cell death. Lithium and ibudilast both interact with NCS-1 and prevent
  enhanced InsP3R activity and NCS-1 protein degradation. TRPV4 inhibitor HC-067047
  reduces mechanical allodynia after paclitaxel treatment. BAPTA and other Ca2+ reducing
  agents have been shown to inhibit the pathway. Overexpression of calpastatin, an
  endogenous calpain inhibitor, as well as overexpression of NCS-1 mutations (I35H
  or I35A) were able to protect WT NCS-1 in human neuroblastoma cells.
