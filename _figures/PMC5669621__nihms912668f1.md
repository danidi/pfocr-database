caption: 'Development of POMC neurons. (a) Overview of the factors that regulate embryonic
  POMC development and postnatal maturation of POMC circuitry. Notch signaling, Shh,
  Nkx2-1, Six3, Rax and Sox2 regulate POMC neurogenesis during embryonic development.
  Some POMC-positive progenitors become NPY and Kisspeptin neurons. At birth, POMC
  neuronal projections are immature. Leptin, autophagy, and BDNF regulate POMC axon
  growth. In the adult stage, leptin, glucose, glucocorticoid, and HFD modulate synaptic
  input organization onto the POMC neurons (red, excitatory synapses; blue, inhibitory
  synapses; green, astrocytes). POMC neurogenesis also occurs in adulthood, and it
  is shown to be induced by the injections of the hNSCs and iPSCs. CNTF and HF diet
  affect adult POMC neurogenesis. (b) Outline of the Notch signaling pathway regulating
  POMC neurogenesis. The progenitor cell, via the formation of the Notch/DLL1 complex
  with a neighboring cell, inhibits its own differentiation to a POMC neuron (lateral
  inhibition) by activating the transcriptional repressor Hes1, which is induced by
  NICD/Rbpjk binding. Once the Notch/DLL1 is removed, Mash1 and Ngn2/3 can initiate
  the differentiation of the cell into a POMC neuron. Abbreviations: BDNF, brain-derived
  neurotrophic factor; CNTF, ciliary neurotrophic factor; E, embryonic day; HFD, high-fat
  diet; hNSC, hypothalamic neural stem cell; HVZ, hypothalamic ventricular zone; iPSC,
  inducible pluripotent stem cell; Ngn 2/3, neurogenin 2/3; NICD, intracellular domain
  of Notch; NPY, neuropeptide Y; NSC, neural stem cell; POMC, pro-opiomelanocortin.'
