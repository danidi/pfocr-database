caption: A simplified schematic of cholesterol and lipid synthesis including major
  regulatory elements and feedback points. Pathway members are in black, enzymes in
  red, transcription factors in blue, and hormones in green. Both cholesterol and
  lipid synthesis are regulated by AMPK and downstream factors including the ACCs
  and SREBPs. Cholesterol itself is part of a negative feedback mechanism that adjusts
  levels of the rate limiting enzymes HMGCR and SQLE. Lipid synthesis is regulated
  in part by the accumulation of lipids in adipocytes, which produce adipokines, such
  as leptin and adiponectin. In turn, these adipokines are known to regulate AMPK
  levels.
