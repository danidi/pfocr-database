caption: Model for negative feedback loop by which the ARGOS family desensitizes ethylene
  signaling. Key signaling elements of the ethylene pathway are shown, initial elements
  being localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the EIN3 transcription factor
  family being localized to the nucleus. Ethylene activates the transcriptional response
  to ethylene, stimulating expression of ARGOS family members. ARGOS family proteins
  insert into the ER where they serve to desensitize the ethylene signal output
