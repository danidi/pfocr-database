caption: 'The UPR signalling cascades triggered by dissociation of the chaperone GRP78
  from the ER transmembrane proteins PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, and activated by biomechanical
  injury, nitric oxide, and certain inflammatory mediators. Alternatively spliced,
  transcriptionally activated XBP1 (XBP1s) promotes chondrocyte maturation to procatabolic
  hypertrophic differentiation, mediated in part by cross-talk with the ATF6 pathway.
  XBP1s also drives matrix pro-catabolic responses in response to IL-1β, as does excess
  CHOP, another terminal UPR effector. CHOP also promotes chondrocyte superoxide production
  and apoptosis. Knock-out of CHOP is chondroprotective in mouse knee instability-induced
  OA in vivo.Abbreviations: ATF6, activating transcription factor 6; CHOP, C/EBP homologous
  protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GRP78, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein; IRE1,
  inositol-requiring protein 1; PERK, protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase; UPR, unfolded
  protein response; XBP1, X-box-binding protein 1; XBP1s, X-box-binding protein 1
  splicing form.'
