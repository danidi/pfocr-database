caption: The Mec1/Rad53 pathway senses ongoing DNA replication to inhibit mitotic
  entry. Ongoing DNA replication leads to exposed ssDNA and ssDNA/dsDNA junctions
  at the replication forks, which are sensed by the Mec1/Rad53 pathway, activating
  dNTP synthesis, stabilising S-phase gene expression through inhibition of Nrm1,
  and preventing mitotic entry through inhibition of Ndd1 and stabilisation of Swe1.
  The presence of ssDNA and ssDNA/dsDNA junctions allows the assembly of the ssDNA-RPA-Lcd1-Mec1
  (right) and DNA-RFC-Ctf18-Pol2-Mrc1 (left) complexes, respectively. The complexes
  are defined through (nested) Boolean AND gates of six and four bonds, respectively.
  The two complexes are thought to bring active Mec1 in proximity of Mrc1, promoting
  their interaction and phosphorylation of Mrc1, leading to the recruitment, phosphorylation
  and activation of Rad53. Active Rad53 supports DNA synthesis (through Dun1 and Sml1
  mediated derepression of Rnr1) and S-phase transcription (through inhibition of
  Nrm1, an inhibitor of the MBF transcription factor), and prevents mitotic entry
  (through inhibition of Ndd1, which is needed for CLB1/2 transcription). In parallel,
  Mec1 prevents mitotic entry through stabilisation of Swe1, a Cdk1-Clb1/2 inhibitor.
  The regulatory graph is a bipartite representation where elemental reactions (red)
  produce or consume elemental states (blue), and elemental states influence elemental
  reactions through contingencies. Complex contingencies are collected in Boolean
  nodes (AND/OR/NOT; light grey), and input/output nodes (dark grey) define the interface
  between the model and its surroundings—and between the MRN and CGM parts. The figure
  has been simplified by omitting domain and residue names in the reaction node strings
