caption: Overview of the bone metastatisation process. The primary tumour gets access
  to the circulation, also thanks to the activation of the HIF pathway, which activates
  a pro-metastatic program in a subset of cancer cells. Before metastases take place,
  a number of premetastatic factors, including extracellular vesicles, lysyl oxidase
  (LOX), heparanase, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), and osteopontin
  (OPN) educate the bone microenvironment making it suitable for metastatic engraftment.
  Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) can then extravasate and engraft in the bone thanks
  to homing factors such as very late antigen (VLA)-4 and αvβ3 integrins, C-X-C chemokine
  receptor type (CXCR)-4 and CD44. Once in the bone microenvironment, most cells entertain
  a cross-communication with bone cells, changing the physiologic “virtuous cycle”
  between osteoblasts and osteoclasts into a “vicious cycle” that favours tumour growth.
  Two types of vicious cycles are known. The osteosclerotic vicious cycle, normally
  established by prostate cancer cells, exploits osteoblasts (OBS)-stimulating factors
  (including extracellular vesicles) to increase OBS production of growth factors,
  as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage-colony-stimulating
  factor (M-CSF), that, in turn, stimulate osteoclast differentiation, further allowing
  the release of growth factors from the bone matrix. The growth factors produced
  by OBS and released by OCS then signal back to cancer cells, increasing their growth,
  thus closing the vicious cycle. The osteolytic vicious cycle is established by many
  types of tumours, including breast cancer. In this cycle, tumour cells use osteoclast-stimulating
  factors (including extracellular vesicles) and osteoclast differentiation-stimulating
  factors (including extracellular vesicles) to increase bone resorption, leading
  to the release of growth factors from the bone matrix, thus furthering tumour growth
  and restarting the vicious cycle. PTHrP is also exploited by breast cancer cells
  to induce osteoclastogenesis indirectly, through osteoblastic RANKL and M-CSF. Osteocytes
  may also take a part in the osteolytic vicious cycle, by suppressing OBS activity
  through secretion of sclerostin (SOST). A crucial factor in the vicious cycle is
  HIF, that is activated partially thanks to the low pO2 of the bone marrow microenvironment,
  and causing increased angiogenesis, OBS stimulation and OCS stimulation. A very
  small contingent of cells may undertake an alternative path and progress through
  cellular dormancy. This process requires the stimulation of many membrane and soluble
  factors, such as bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-7, that induces prostate cancer
  dormancy, or Jagged-1 which proposedly promotes dormancy through Notch-2 in breast
  cancer cells. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), endothelial cells and spindle-shaped
  N-cadherin-positive osteoblasts (SNOs) seem to be crucial in this process, but also
  other cell types may be taking part in this process too.
