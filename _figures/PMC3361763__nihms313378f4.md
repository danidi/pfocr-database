caption: Metabolic changes associated to CDK4/6 inhibition. CDK4 and CDK6 inhibition
  leads to an imbalance between the oxidative and non-oxidative branches of the pentose
  phosphate pathway towards the non-oxidative branch. Thick lines indicate enhanced
  metabolic routes. Dotted lines indicate less active metabolic routes and smaller
  font sizes indicate lower intermediate concentrations
