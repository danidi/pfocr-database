caption: (A). Integrated network of CNV-ICC-TRN and KEGG signaling pathways. Triangle
  represents TF, circle represents gene and rectangle represents signaling pathway;
  red color means gene inside CNV region, green color means gene outside CNV region.
  (B) Integrative analysis in MAPK signaling pathway. (C) Integrative analysis in
  Wnt signaling pathway. (D) Integrative analysis in TGF-β signaling pathway. In figure
  B, C, D, red edges are from CNV-ICC-TRN, and off-white edges are from signaling
  pathways.
