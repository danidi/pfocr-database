caption: The proposed signaling pathway of Tat-induced nuclear localization of ZO-1
  in human brain endothelial cells. HIV-1 protein Tat activates RhoA and downstream
  ROCK kinase, leading to phosphorylation of MLC, which then can mediate cross-linking
  F-actin into stress fibers and influence nuclear ZO-1 translocation. Stimulation
  of the Rho pathway results in phosphorylation of CREB, a transcriptional activator
  of ZO-1. In addition, exposure to HIV-1 or Tat protein stimulates MMPs and proteasome,
  which are responsible for degradation of TJ proteins, including ZO-1 (). Nuclear
  translocation may protect this pool of ZO-1 against proteolytic degradation, whereas
  the membrane pool remains vulnerable to MMP and proteasome proteolysis. Because
  membrane ZO-1 is the major form of this TJ protein, its decrease results in diminished
  levels of total ZO-1. In addition to stimulation of CREB phosphorylation by the
  Rho signaling, CREB also influences activation of MLC, indicating a close crosstalk
  between these two signaling pathways.
