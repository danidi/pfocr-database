caption: 'Leishmania spp.-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Priming: Several
  TLR-dependent mechanisms have been proposed for activating the NFκB and MAPK signaling
  to upregulate expression of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β during Leishmania spp. infection.
  Sandfly microbiota, which are released with Leishmania spp. during sandfly bites,
  promote pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 upregulation, suggesting a role for TLR, although specific
  TLR have not been examined. Leishmania spp. lipophosphoglycan (LPG) can directly
  bind TLR2 to induce MAPK signaling. Leishmania spp.-associated LRV (dsDNA leishmania
  RNA virus) can activate TLR3 signaling, although whether it directly impacts NLRP3
  and pro-IL-1β production is not clear. Leishmania spp. associated glycoproteins
  and glycosphingophospholipids can activate TLR4 signaling. Finally, Leishmania spp.
  DNA can activate TLR9 to promote IL-12 production. All these data provide evidence
  that sandfly microbiota and different leishmania antigens can activate TLR signaling
  pathway to promote NFκB and MAPK signaling, which can then promote upregulation
  of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1β. Activation: Several different mechanisms have been proposed
  on upstream events that lead to assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Leishmania spp.
  engages Dectin-1/SYK signaling to promote ROS production, which activates the NLRP3
  inflammasome. The leishmania antigen recognized by Dectin-1 to initiate this signaling
  cascade is currently unknown. Leishmania spp. LPG, once inside a cell, can indirectly
  activate caspase-11. Activated caspase-11 can then directly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome,
  which is also known as non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome. Addition of ATP during
  Leishmania spp. infection has been shown to induce LTB4 (leukotriene B4) to activate
  caspase-11-dependent non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome. Altogether, several different
  mechanisms have been proposed for providing activation signals for assembly of the
  NLRP3 inflammasome. Importantly, active caspase-11 and caspase-1 promote IL-1β,
  IL-18, and GSDMD-dependent pyroptotic cell death which play important roles in regulating
  Leishmania spp.-associated pathologies'
