caption: Schematic diagram of the signaling pathway for Ang II-stimulated VSMC migration.
  Ang II stimulates VSMC migration through activation of multiple kinases such as
  Src, PKC and PI3-K. These kinases function upstream of βPIX-Rac1 pathway which sequentially
  activates PAK1 and NAD(P)H oxidase leading to ROS production. In the present study
  we have demonstrated that βPIX-dependent Rac1 activation is critically involved
  in the Ang II signaling. Regarding PAK1 activation, only Src is considered to function
  upstream of βPIX-Rac1 (). Src can activate PAK1 via PDK1 in a βPIX-Rac1 independent
  manner (not shown) (). Although ROS is produced via Src-βPIX-Rac1-NAD(P)H oxidase,
  it can amplify its production through recycling a positive feedback loop. Thus,
  ROS generation can be sustained for several hours, which explains the mechanism
  for Ang II-stimulated VSMC migration.
