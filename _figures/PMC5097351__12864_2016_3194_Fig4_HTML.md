caption: Co-expression network fractionation within metabolic pathways after maize
  whole genome duplication. a A schematic of a hypothetical co-expression network
  after a WGD event is illustrated to define potential relationships. Maize1 and maize2
  intra-edges indicate the co-expression correlations among genes from the same subgenome.
  Subgenome inter-edges represent the co-expression relationship between genes which
  are from different subgenomes. The “lost” genes (in yellow) are those that have
  been fractionated after the recent WGD event and are missing from one of the subgenomes.
  Maize1 genes are shown in pink circles, while maize2 genes are in green circles.
  b-c Examples of co-expression networks in the stearate biosynthetic pathway where
  all genes were retained and the glycolysis IV pathway in which some duplicate pairs
  have been fractionated resulting in lost genes. Genes on the right panel encode
  enzymes corresponding to each pathway on the left
