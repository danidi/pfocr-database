caption: Pathway indifference confers drug resistance via an alternate cellular state
  that is independent of the index drug-inhibited pathway and its original oncogenic
  effectors. In BRAF-mutant melanoma, the index drug-sensitive transcriptional state
  is characterized by MAPK-dependent activity of the MITF transcription factor. Resistance
  to MAPK pathway inhibition can be achieved by transition to an NF-κB-driven, low-MITF
  transcriptional state that does not require MAPK input for its maintenance.In prostate
  cancer, alternative AR-independent cellular states are characterized by Wnt5A-driven
  and neuroendocrine-like transcriptional programs and are indifferent to inhibition
  of the AR signaling axis.
