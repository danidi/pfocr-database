caption: 'JNK (C-Jun N-terminal kinase) substrates that regulate the mitochondrial
  apoptotic pathway. JNK can have pro-apoptotic effects through direct phosphorylation
  of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) family members. The phosphorylation of Bax (Bcl-2-associated
  X protein) will activate the pro-apoptotic activity of this protein, whereas the
  phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1) will suppress their
  anti-apoptotic function. Indeed, the direct phosphorylation and activation of Bad
  (Bcl-2-antagonist of cell death), Bim (Bcl-2-like protein 11), or Bmf (Bcl-2-modifying
  factor) will inhibit the antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-2. In addition, JNK phosphorylation
  of 14-3-3 protein induces the release of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad. JNK
  phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase iTCH (itchy homolog) promotes the degradation
  of caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP (cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1β converting enzyme)
  inhibitory protein), therefore promoting caspase-8 activation and Bid (BH3 interacting-domain
  death agonist) proteolysis (tBid). JNK, activated by TNFα (tumor necrosis factor
  alfa), also promotes apoptosis through proteolysis of Bid (jBid) by an unknown protease
  (X). All these modifications in the Bcl-2 family members induce the release of cytochrome
  c and/or Smac/DIABLO (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor
  of apoptosis protein-binding protein with low pI) from the mitochondria and subsequent
  caspase activation. Symbols used: activation (), inhibition (―•). Pro-apoptotic
  members of the Bcl-2 family are represented in red and anti-apoptotic members in
  blue.'
