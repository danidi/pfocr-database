caption: The autophagy pathway. During the initial stages of autophagy, the isolation
  membrane forms a double membrane vesicle [the autophagosome] around the cargo to
  be degraded. The mature autophagosome then fuses with a lysosome to form an autophagolysosome,
  in which cargo are degraded by lysosomal enzymes and subunits are recycled. Autophagy
  is controlled by the coordinated activity of ATG proteins. Two ubiquitin-like molecules,
  LC3 and ATG12, are involved in autophagosome biogenesis. LC3 is conjugated to PE
  to form lipidated LC3-II and is associated with the autophagosome outer membrane.
  ATG12 is conjugated to ATG5 and forms a complex with ATG16L1 [ATG16L1 complex].
  The ATG16L1 complex is proposed to specify the site of LC3 lipidation for autophagosome
  formation.
