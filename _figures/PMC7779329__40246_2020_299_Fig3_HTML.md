caption: SARS-CoV-2 and relevant biological processes that involve ACE, PGR, FXIIIB,
  and tPA. SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry, facilitated by androgen-regulated
  TMPRSS2. SARS-CoV-2 can cause tissue and endothelial cell damages, activating the
  intertwined intrinsic and extrinsic blood coagulation pathways. ACE and ACE2 are
  two essential regulatory components in the RAAS. ACE can promote vasoconstriction
  through antagonizing the regulatory role of ACE2 in the RAAS and acting as a bradykininase
  in the KKS additionally activated by the intrinsic coagulation pathway. ACE2 is
  locally downregulated by SARS-CoV-2 entry and excessive ACE signaling. Progesterone
  can upregulate ACE2 via binding to the intracellular progesterone receptor. The
  result of hemostasis is the conversion of fibrin monomers to polymers catalyzed
  by Factor XIII, which, in circulation, is a heterotetrameric protein composed of
  FXIIIA and FXIIIB subunits. D-dimers constitute one of the fibrinolysis degradation
  products generated as plasmin catalyzes fibrinolysis. Plasminogen is the zymogen
  of plasmin; the transition can be facilitated by kallikrein and tPA among other
  molecules. Both plasmin and FXIIIB can activate the complement system in addition
  to their function as catalysts. The functions of proteins encoded by the ACE, PGR,
  PLAT, and F13B are integrally essential to the RAAS, KKS, and fibrinolytic systems;
  Alu variants in these genes likely contribute to the spectrum of symptoms observed
  in COVID-19 cases. ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; FXIII, Factor XIII; KKS,
  kallikrein-kinin system; PGR, progesterone receptor; RAAS, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
