caption: 'Relevance of NMDA receptor localization composed of NR1/NR2A or NR1/NR2B
  assemblies. It was proposed that NR1/NR2A receptors, which have a lower affinity
  for glutamate and glycine than NR1/NR2B receptors (), reside in the synapse, while
  NR1/NR2B receptors are located at extrasynaptic sites. However, it has been shown
  that this separation evolves only during postnatal development when the NR1/NR2B
  receptors exchange for NR1/NR2A receptors in the synapse (). This dynamic view of
  NMDA receptor subtypes was completed by the observation that NMDA receptors can
  move laterally between synaptic and extrasynaptic sites within the plasma membrane
  (; ). Groc et al. have shown that NR1/NR2A assemblies diffuse laterally more than
  two order of magnitude slower than NR1/NR2B receptors (; ; see thick purple and
  thin green arrows representing the mobility of NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B assemblies,
  respectively). The different subcellular locations of NR1/NR2A and NR1/NR2B assemblies
  determine the source of glutamate being able to activate these receptors. While
  the NR1/NR2A assemblies are activated by glutamate released in the synapse, the
  origin of glutamate activating NR1/NR2B assemblies can be: (i) the spillover of
  synaptic glutamate following high frequency stimulation (; ), (ii) the reversal
  of glutamate transporters (EAAT1-4) mainly in neurons (), (iii) the vesicular glutamate
  release from glial processes in the tripartite synapses (; ). The latter is the
  basis of glia-neuron interaction and can affect both the presynaptic and postsynaptic
  NR1/NR2B assemblies and either enhances synaptic strength or mediates slow inward
  currents, respectively (; ). Functions of synaptic NR1/NR2A and extrasynaptic NR1/NR2B
  receptors are opposing to some extent (): (i) NR1/NR2A promote, while NR1/NR2B inhibit
  AMPA receptor trafficking (), (ii) NR1/NR2A induces the neuroprotective CREB (cAMP
  response element binding protein) pathway, while NR1/NR2B shuts it down and promotes
  neuronal death (), (iii) NR1/NR2A induces long-term potentiation, while NR1/NR2B
  seems to be relevant in long-term depression (; ).'
