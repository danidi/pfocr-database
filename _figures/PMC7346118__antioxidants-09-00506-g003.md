caption: Pathways involved in polymyxin-induced nephrotoxicity and the potential nephro-protective
  mechanism of curcumin. Colistin extensively accumulates in kidney tubular cells
  via receptor-mediated uptake, megalin, peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2) and the carnitine/organic
  cation transporter 2 (OCTN2). Intracellular colistin accumulation in kidney tubular
  cells induces the production of ROS, mitochondrial dysfunction and triggers a series
  of signaling cascades (e.g., cell cycle arrest, p53, nuclear factor kappa B [NF-κB]
  and mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK], nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2 [Nrf2]/heme oxygenase-1 [HO-1] pathways). The activation of the transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 3-phosphate oxidase-4 (NOX-4)
  pathway contributes to oxidative stress by promoting ROS production. All three major
  apoptosis pathways (e.g., mitochondrial, death receptor and endoplasmic reticulum
  pathways) participated in colistin-induced nephrotoxicity. Curcumin treatment improved
  colistin-induced nephrotoxicity by targeting the NF-kB mediated inflammatory response,
  oxidative stress and upregulating the antioxidant Nrf2/HO-1 pathways.
