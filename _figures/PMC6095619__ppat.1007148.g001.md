caption: Genomic DNA form DNA viruses or reverse transcription intermediates from
  retroviruses are recognized by cGAS, which catalyzes the production of cGAMP to
  bind and activate the ER-resident adaptor protein STING. STING then forms a complex
  with TBK1 and translocates from the ER to the perinuclear lysosomal compartments
  via an autophagy-like process. The STING–TBK1 complex subsequently activates transcription
  factors IRF3 and NF-κB to induce the production of type I IFNs and inflammatory
  cytokines to establish an antiviral state. Viruses have developed numerous strategies
  to antagonize the cGAS–STING pathway. Tegument protein ORF52 from gammaherpesviruses
  inhibits cGAS binding to viral DNA, while nonstructural protein NS2B of DENV promotes
  cGAS degradation. Similarly, DENV NS2B3 protease cleaves STING and leads to its
  degradation. HBV polymerase and papain-like proteases of human coronaviruses prevent
  or remove the K63-linked Ub of STING. KSHV vIRF1 blocks the TBK1-mediated phosphorylation
  of STING, while HSV-1 ICP27 prevents the phosphorylation of IRF3 by TBK1. HPV18
  E7 protein and hAd5 E1A protein bind to STING and inhibit its activation. cGAMP,
