caption: The metabolic pathways of Mtb that interconnect glycogen, Tre and other carbohydrates.
  The scheme includes links between pathways for glycogen, Tre (wide gray arrows)
  and MGLP. The enzymes characterized in this work (ADP-Glc PPase, UDP-Glc PPase,
  GSase and Tre-6P Sase) are shown in blue boxes. The green lines indicate the allosteric
  activation of ADP-Glc PPase and Tre-6P Sase. The wide-dashed arrow symbolizes the
  gluconeogenesis pathway and →→ indicates several enzymatic steps.
