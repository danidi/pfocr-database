caption: Methionine/glutathione transsulfuration pathway. Methionine is converted
  by methionine adenosyltransferase to S-adenosylmethionine, which is then converted
  to S-adenosylhomocysteine by methyltransferase. S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase
  catalyses the reversibile hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine to homocysteine and
  adenosine. Methionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine
  methyltransferase in the presence of N5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and the cofactor
  cobalamine. The vitamin B6-dependent enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase (1) combines
  homocysteine and serine to produce cystathionine. Cystathionine is broken down to
  cysteine and α-ketobutyrat via the B6-dependent enzyme cystathionine-γ-lyase (2).
  Gamma-glutamylcysteine is synthesized from L-glutamate and cysteine via the enzyme
  γ-glutamylcysteine synthase (3). This reaction is the rate-limiting step in glutathione
  synthesis. Successively, glycine is added to the C-terminal of γ-glutamylcysteine
  via the enzyme glutathione synthase (4).
