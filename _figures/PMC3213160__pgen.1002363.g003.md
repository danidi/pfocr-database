caption: Network of canonical pathways (Wikipathways and KEGG) significantly enriched
  for genes identified by Bi-miR-34a pull-down (A) or down-regulated following miR-34a
  over-expression (B) in HCT116 and K562 cells. Each pathway is represented by a node
  in the network. The node size increases with the number of identified genes in the
  pathway and the node color represents the p-value based on the hypergeometric distribution
  (see key). Pathways that are not significantly enriched in an experiment are still
  shown, but are in gray. The number of genes shared between two pathways is represented
  by an edge whose thickness increases with the number of shared genes. The pull-down
  enriched pathways (A) suggest that miR-34a extensively targets growth factor, signal
  transduction and cell cycle control pathways. The integrated outcome of both direct
  and indirect effects of miR-34a on gene expression in (B) is suppression of expression
  of genes participating in downstream signaling, cell cycle and DNA repair pathways.
