caption: Working model. In this study, we demonstrate that Plk1 interacts with and
  directly phosphorylates G6PD to promote the formation of its active dimer, thereby
  enhancing PPP flux and macromolecule biosynthesis. Together with previous reports
  that have established multiple critical roles for Plk1 in regulation of mitosis
  and cell cycle progression, we propose that Plk1 coordinates biosynthesis with cell
  cycle progression to promote cancer development
