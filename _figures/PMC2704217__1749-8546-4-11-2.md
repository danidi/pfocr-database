caption: Insulin signal pathway and insulin insensitive. The inner part of IR reveals
  a tyrosine kinase activity and coupled with proteins of Src-homology-collagen-like
  protein (SHC) and multifunctional docking proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2. The interaction
  of insulin and IR activates its tyrosine activity and phosphorylates the coupled
  SHC and subsequently activates, in turn, a series of signal proteins, including
  the growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (Grb2), and the ras small guanosine
  5'-triphosphate-binding protein. The in turn signaling leads to an activation of
  the MAPK cascade involved in mitogenesis and the open status of a hexose transporter
  protein (GLUTs), which is located in the cell membrane and is the only pump to take
  into glucose for cells. The decreased serine/threonine phosphorylation of IR, inactivates
  hexokinase and glycogen synthase, as well as defects in the phosphorylation of glucose
  transporter protein (GLUT4) and genetic primary defect in mitochondrial fatty acid
  oxidation, leading to insulin resistance and an increase of triglyceride synthesis
  contribute to this insulin insensitivity. The action sites of hypoglycemia herbs
  are indicated with an arrow.
