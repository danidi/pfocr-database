caption: 'Outline of the molecular pharmacology and response determinants of clinical
  TOP1 inhibitors. A: Right: Chemical structures of the camptothecin derivatives used
  in the clinic. R1, R2 and R3 refer to the positions of substitutions that confer
  water solubility to irinotecan and topotecan. Camptothecins are active in lactone
  form and are readily inactivated at physiological pH in the blood and tissues by
  E-ring hydrolysis to their ring-open carboxylate form (top right), which is sequestered
  by serum albumin. Left: The clinical indenoisoquinoline derivatives, LMP400, LMP776
  and LMP744. B: Both the camptothecins and indenoisoquinolines trap TOP1CCs by binding
  at the enzyme-DNA interface. C: Replication damage induced by TOP1 inhibitors. D.
  Collision of a replication fork with a TOP1CC on the leading strand for DNA synthesis
  generates a single-ended DNA double-strand break (DSE: double-stranded end) by replication
  run-off. E. Alternatively, the colliding fork can be remodeled by replication fork
  reversal (promoted by HLTF, ZRANB3, SMARCL1, RAD51 and PCNA polyubiquitylation)
  which remodels the TOP1CC to a potentially reversible configuration. Fork restart
  is promoted by the helicase RecQ1 and the MCM10 replication helicase. PARylation
  of RecQ1 prevents its activity and thereby keep forks in the reversed configuration.
  F. Collisions of transcription and replication with trapped TOP1CCs induce the degradation
  of TOP1 by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and engage the chromatin response by
  phosphorylation of histone H2AX (γH2AX). TOP1CCs are excised by TDP1 (tyrosyl DNA
  phosphodiesterase) and the endonuclease XPF-ERCC1. The primary cytotoxic lesions
  in cancer cells result from collisions between the trapped TOP1CCs and replication
  forks. These collisions are repaired by HDR (homology directed repair) and activating
  ATR (Ataxia Telangiectasia related) and CHK1 kinases as well as PARP (poly[ADPribose]polymerase).
  Replication collisions also activate the cell death pathways by engaging p53 (TP53)
  and Schlafen 11 (SLFN11).'
