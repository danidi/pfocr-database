caption: Gas6 and TAM receptor signalling. Gas6 binds to TAM and thereby exerts its
  biological effects, including the promotion of survival, proliferation and migration
  in several cancers. (a) Gas6/Axl interaction activates the PI3K/Akt pathway and
  promotes the survival of cancer cells. Activation of Akt leads to inactivation of
  Bad and an increase in the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 via an NF-κB-dependent mechanism.
  Gas6/Mer interacts with Grb2 and promotes survival through Ras, MEK1 and upregulation
  of ERK1/2. Gas6/Mer also activates P38 MAPK to promote survival, and Gas6 binding
  at the cell surface induces dimerization and autophosphorylation of Tyro3 at its
  intracellular domain, which provides docking sites for downstream signalling molecules.
  Then, the Akt survival pathway is activated, resulting in the nuclear translocation
  of NF-κB and the upregulation of NF-κB target genes, which have a role in survival.
  (b) Gas6/Axl promote proliferation through interacting with Grb2, STAT3 and MAPK/ERK.
  The Gas6/Grb2 interaction can induce cell proliferation by activating Ras/ERK signalling.
  (c) Gas6/Axl interacts with Nck2, and Nck2 connects Axl to a ternary complex consisting
  of the PINCH protein, ILK and parvin, which is associated with migration. Gas6/Axl
  also induces migration through upregulation of Slug by ERK, and Gas6/Mer activation
  induces upregulation of FAK through PLC, which promote cell migration. Akt, protein
  kinase B; Bcl-2, B-cell lymphoma 2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase;
  FAK, focal adhesion kinase; Gas6, growth arrest-specific gene 6; Grb2, growth factor
  receptor-bound protein 2; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; MEK1, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Nck2, non-catalytic region
  of tyrosine kinase adaptor protein 2; NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer
