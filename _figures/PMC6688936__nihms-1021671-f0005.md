caption: Axiopodia in BCs cross the TJs and are in contact with the lumen. Luminal
  ANGII stimulates AGTR2 in BCs and induces the production of NO, which then diffuses
  out to reach CCs, where it produces cGMP via activation of soluble guanylate cyclase
  (sGC). cGMP triggers V-ATPase apical accumulation and increases proton secretion
  by CCs. ANGII is produced by testicular ACE (t-ACE), which is attached to the sperm
  membrane via a GPI linker.
