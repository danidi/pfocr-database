caption: Hepatic cell death pathway and liver injury in response to high fat diet
  exposure. A HFD induces multiple cell death mechanisms including both caspase-dependent
  apoptosis and RIP3-driven necroptosis in the liver. Inhibition of RIP3 exacerbates
  hepatocyte apoptosis following exposure to a HFD, and thus aggravates liver injury
  and inflammation. A high-fat diet also induces apoptosis in adipocytes. Adipocyte
  apoptosis drives monocyte/macrophage infiltration, as well as impairs glucose homeostasis.
