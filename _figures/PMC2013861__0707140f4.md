caption: Signalling pathways activated by the RXFPs. (a) RXFP1 is activated primarily
  by relaxin and appears to signal mainly via cAMP. Initially RXFP1 increases cAMP
  accumulation via Gαs and negatively modulates this via GαoB. These two pathways
  combined to affect CRE transcription. With time (dotted lines) RXFP1 recruits Gαi3
  which activates the Gβγ-PI3K-PKCζ pathway to further increase cAMP. RXFP1 also appears
  to activate GRE transcription (and possibly GR) by a currently unknown mechanism.
  (b) RXFP2 is activated by INSL3 (in addition to some relaxins, although this is
  species-specific) and both activates and negatively modulates cAMP accumulation
  by Gαs and GαoB respectively, which leads to effects upon CRE transcription. (c)
  RXFP3 is activated by relaxin-3 and inhibits forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation.
  This receptor also activated ERK1/2 by a mechanism which requires receptor internalization
  or movement into lipid-rich signalling platforms, activation of PTX sensitive G
  proteins, PKC as well as Raf and MEK1/2. PI3K activation and EGF receptor transactivation
  (if expressed in the cell) are required for full ERK1/2 phosphorylation to occur,
  however about 50% of ERK1/2 will still be phosphorylated if these entities are blocked
  with specific inhibitors, (d) RXFP4 is activated by INSL5 and is also coupled to
  the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation.
