caption: (A) The Drosophila Hippo pathway. Signaling diagram of Hippo (Hpo) kinases
  cascade and of its modulation by apical transmembrane protein complexes and proteins
  involved in cell polarity control (Arrowed or blunted ends indicate activation or
  inhibition, respectively). (B) Role of YAP in the Hpo-like pathway in human. In
  mammals the relationships between Drosophila Hpo and Wts, are conserved in Mst1/2
  (Hpo homologs) and Lats1/2 (Wts homolog). Lats1/2 phosphorylates YAP on different
  conserved motifs. Phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic retention
  are conserved in YAP, which inhibits it to enhance the transcriptional activation
  of pro-proliferation genes. Depending on the cellular context Lats1/2 phosphorylates
  YAP, increasing its transcriptional support to p73 to induce apoptosis. YAP can
  also be phosphorylated by other kinase, such as CDK1δ/ε promoting its subsequent
  protein proteasome-degradation. The retention of YAP at cytoplasmic level can also
  be exerted by sequestering the protein at the junctional level through the interaction
  with the AMOT protein.
