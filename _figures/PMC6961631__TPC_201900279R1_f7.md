caption: Autoregulation of Nodulation.Upon perception of rhizobia, the activation
  of cytokinin signaling results in increased expression of the genes encoding CLE12
  and CLE13 peptides (1), which are then modified with arabinose residues by the RDN1
  enzyme (2) and transported through the xylem to the shoot (3). Perception of the
  peptides in the shoot requires the receptor kinase SUNN, CLV2 receptor-like protein,
  and CRN pseudo-kinase (4). A second pathway involving the CRA2 receptor also controls
  nodule number by responding to a CEP peptide. Receptors in the shoot increase auxin
  and cytokinin transport to the root and the transport of miR2111(5), which affects
  TML expression (6).
