caption: The mechanism underlying sustained activation of NF-κB signaling associated
  with MIC-1 in intestinal epithelial cells infected with EPEC. EPEC infection can
  trigger prolonged NF-κB activation. Although the bacteria can regulate transient
  NF-κB activation and cytokine production via a type III secretion system during
  the early infection period, it extends p65 activation in a MIC-1-linked signaling
  pathway, which contributes to epithelial survival from bacteria-induced apoptotic
  death.
