caption: (A) The canonical view in which IRS-1 functions as a signaling mediator of
  IGF-IR to the PI3K-Akt pathway through their Tyr phosphorylation. The molecular
  basis for closed interactions between IGF-IR endocytosis and its signaling components
  has been poorly understood. (B) A proposed model for IRS-1-mediated surface retention
  of IGF-IR and sustained IGF signaling. The ability of IRS-1 to interact with AP2
  prolongs the surface retention of active IGF-IR, which is caused by the inhibition
  of AP2-dependent IGF-IR internalization. After long-term stimulation of IGF, IRS-1
  is degraded by mTORC1 feedback signal, which functions as a brake release to trigger
  the initiation of IGF-IR internalization. Accelerating IGF-IR internalization caused
  by IRS-1 depletion leads to the shift from sustained to transient Akt signaling.
