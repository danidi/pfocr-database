caption: Influenza virus enters the cell through the endocytic pathway. Fusion of
  the envelope of the virus to that of the endosome results in the release of the
  segmented genome of the virus, which is transported to the nucleus where replication
  takes place. During this entry process, some virions may not escape the endosome
  and expose the viral RNA to TLR3/7/8 present in specialized cells, which recognize
  double stranded and single stranded RNA. At late times of infection, the newly synthesized
  viral RNA segments move to the cytoplasm, where they can encounter the ubiquitously
  expressed cytoplasmic sensor RIG-I before assembly of new virions takes place. The
  presence of a 5′-triphospate and of a partial double strand structure makes the
  influenza virus RNAs optimal substrates for RIG-I activation. Viral RNAs in the
  cytoplasm can also enter the endosome through autophagic processes. TLR signaling
  by the adaptors TRIF or MyD88, and RIG-I signaling by the adaptor MAVS triggers
  signal transduction cascade that results in activation of IRF3/7 and NF-kB factors
  that translocates to the nucleus where they promote the synthesis of type I and
  type III IFN mRNAs.
