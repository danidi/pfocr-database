caption: '(A) The GPL/GL enzyme network where membrane lipids are in purple, storage
  lipids are in orange, and water‐soluble intermediates are in blue. Only key nodes
  are shown. The enzymes shown in gray are transmembrane ER proteins, while blue indicates
  a protein that reversibly associates with the ER membrane. Double arrow highlights
  the feedback loop where PtdA activates CDP–choline synthesis, which is a key control
  point for PtdCho production. Dotted lines indicate multiple reactions, and “*” indicates
  that PEMT has a restricted expression pattern in animals and its physiological importance
  is largely reported for hepatocytes. (B) Lipid synthesis organization within the
  ER system. Schematic of ER organization in a simple animal cell. There are structurally
  and/or functionally distinct domains, such as the inner and outer nuclear membrane
  (INM and ONM), and specialized contact sites between the ER and most organelles
  (not all shown). The localization of lipid enzymes within the ER system is still
  poorly defined, but some new concepts are emerging including the following: (I)
  Enzymes of the TAG pathway can relocalize from a broad distribution to concentrate
  at sites of growing lipid droplets. (II) Enzymes of PtdSer synthesis (PSS1 and PSS2)
  concentrate at mitochondria‐associated membranes that are also the sites where newly
  synthesized PtdSer is transferred to mitochondria. (III) The lipin and CCTα enzymes
  that reversibly bind membranes also carry NLS and shuttle between the cytosol and
  nucleus through nuclear pore complexes. This affects whether these enzymes interact
  with the main‐ER membrane or inner nuclear membrane. The LBR sterol reductase is
  also a well‐characterized INM resident. AGPAT, 1‐acylglycerol‐3‐phosphate O‐acyltransferase;
  CEPT, choline/ethanolamine phosphotransferase; CK, choline kinase; CDP, cytidine
  diphosphate; Cho, choline; CDS, PtdA cytidylyltransferase; EPT, ethanolamine phosphotransferase;
  G‐3‐P, glycerol 3‐phosphate; PtdGly, phosphatidylglycerol; PSS, phosphatidylserine
  synthase; MAM, mitochondria‐associated membrane.'
