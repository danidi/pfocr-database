caption: Pathways regulating NEKs in cell cycle control. (A) During interphase, NEK2
  exists in a complex with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and mammalian STE20-like protein
  kinase 2 (MST2), and is maintained in an inactive state through dephosphorylation
  by PP1 (; ). Following the onset of mitosis, PLK1 phosphorylates MST2, thereby preventing
  PP1 from binding to the MST2–NEK2 complex (). This allows NEK2 to autophosphorylate
  and become active. NEK2 then phosphorylates the inter-centriolar linker proteins
  C-Nap1 and rootletin, causing their displacement from the centrosome. (B) NEK2 might
  also localise to the kinetochore of unaligned sister chromatids during mitosis and
  carry out a role in the SAC through phosphorylating HEC1 on Ser165 and interacting
  with MAD1 (; ; ). (C) At the onset of mitosis, CDK1 phosphorylates a number of sites
  in NEK9, which primes NEK9 for subsequent phosphorylation and activation by PLK1
  (). Activated NEK9 can then phosphorylate NEK6 and NEK7, which subsequently phosphorylate
  components (Eg5, microtubules and the γ-TuRC) that are necessary for proper mitotic
  spindle formation (). (D) In response to UV-induced DNA damage, NEK10 forms a trimeric
  complex with MEK1 and RAF1. This causes activation of MEK1, which then phosphorylates
  and activates ERK1/2. This leads to cell cycle arrest; however, the pathway by which
  this occurs has not yet been clarified. DNA breaks caused by IR activate the kinases
  ATM and ATR, which phosphorylate and activate CHK1. CHK1 phosphorylates NEK11 on
  Ser273, thereby activating it, and CDC25A on Ser76, thereby priming DSG motifs (e.g.
  Ser82) in CDC25A for phosphorylation by NEK11. This promotes binding of β-TrCP,
  which leads to the ubiquitylation and degradation of CDC25A, which, in turn, prevents
  CDK1–cyclin-B activation and mitotic entry. MTs, microtubules.
