caption: Figure 1. CGI-58 and ATGL functions in adipocytes (A) and hepatocytes (B).
  (A) Within the adipocyte, triacylglycerol (TAG) hydrolysis is dynamically regulated
  by hormones to ensure appropriate metabolic adaptation to nutritional and physiologic
  cues. In the basal state, CGI-58 is primarily sequestered by perilipin-1(Plin-1)
  at the lipid droplet, ATGL is localized at the lipid droplet, and hormone sensitive
  lipase (HSL) resides in the cytoplasm. Downstream of catecholamine stimulation through
  β-adrenergic receptors (βAR), cAMP-activated protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates
  Plin-1 and HSL. Plin-1 phosphorylation results in the release of CGI-58. CGI-58
  reversibly disperses to the cytoplasm, while a small amount remains at the lipid
  droplet, interacting with ATGL to co-activate TAG hydrolysis. Meanwhile, phosphorylated
  HSL translocates to the lipid droplet and interacts closely with Plin-1, preferentially
  hydrolyzing diacylglycerol (DAG) to monoacylglycerol (MAG). In the final step of
  lipolysis, MAG is hydrolyzed by MAG lipase (MAGL), leading to glycerol release from
  the adipocyte. Based on the localization of CGI-58 in the cytoplasm during stimulated
  lipolysis, CGI-58 may have a physiological function distinct from the co-activation
  of ATGL-mediated lipolysis. The role of CGI-58 LPA acyltransferase (LPAAT) activity
  in adipocytes is not known, but CGI-58-derived PA and downstream products might
  participate in signal transduction. (B) Within the hepatocyte, CGI-58 generates
  signaling lipids to activate inflammatory kinases and dampen insulin signaling.
  Downstream of nutrient oversupply or systemic inflammation, CGI-58-derived PA could
  serve as a precursor to pro-inflammatory signaling lipids that lead to the activation
  of stress kinases such as IκB kinase (IKK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mammalian
  target of rapamycin (mTOR). CGI-58-derived PA might directly activate mTOR complex
  1(mTORC1), similar to PA generated by phospholipase D (PLD). mTORC1 activates S6
  kinase 1 (S6K1) which phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) at Ser1101
  and other residues to inhibit insulin signaling through the insulin receptor (IR).
  mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) mediates insulin action by phosphorylating Akt at Ser473.
  PA generated within the glycerolipid synthesis pathway can impair insulin signaling
  through mTORC2. CGI-58-derived PA might also inactivate mTORC2 to prevent Akt phosphorylation.
  Phosphorylated Akt inactivates forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1), a transcription
  factor that drives expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and very low
  density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. In addition to signaling lipids derived through
  CGI-58 LPAAT activity, it is possible that ATGL-mediated lipolysis could produce
  precursors to signaling lipids. Products of ATGL-mediated lipolysis can serve as
  signaling lipids to activate PPARα, a transcription factor that drives oxidative
  gene expression. CGI-58’s role in hepatic TAG mobilization and PPARα target gene
  expression is likely ATGL-dependent (blue lines). Unlike CGI-58, ATGL does not significantly
  affect hepatic insulin signaling. Thus, CGI-58’s role in the regulation of insulin
  signaling is proposed to be independent of ATGL (red lines). Direct effects are
  denoted by solid lines. Potential pathway effects are indicated by dotted lines.
