caption: 'Pathways of Asn-tRNAAsnsynthesis. The top reaction is the direct pathway,
  which synthesizes Asn-tRNAAsn with asparagine either imported or made from aspartate
  by the AsnA or AsnB enzymes. The bottom reaction is the transamidation pathway,
  which consists of a nondiscriminating AspS capable of generating the misacylated
  Asp-tRNAAsn, and a heterotrimeric Asp-tRNAAsn amidotransferase (Asp-AdT, encoded
  by the gatCAB genes). The genome of M. tuberculosis does not contain asnS, encoding
  asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase, but does contain the following genes for the transamidation
  pathway: aspS (Rv2572c), gatCAB (Rv3012c, Rv3011c, Rv3009c).'
