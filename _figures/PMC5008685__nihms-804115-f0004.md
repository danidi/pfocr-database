caption: Mechanisms of CHOP-induced apoptosis under prolonged ER stress. Sustained
  PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α and increased expression of ATH4 under prolonged
  stress conditions of the ER lead to CHOP-induced apoptotic cell death through various
  signaling pathways. CHOP transcriptionally attenuates Bcl-2 anti-apoptotic family
  of proteins and adversely activates the pro-apoptotic BH3- domain only proteins,
  such as BIM. Moreover, CHOP directly activates the expression of GADD34 genes, in
  which the products create a complex with PP1 resulting in dephosphorylation of eIF2α
  and inhibition of PERK-mediated translational attenuation. CHOP also markedly enhances
  expression of ERO1α genes. ERO1α, oxidoreductase ER enzyme, generates ER-localized
  H2O2, thus causing a hyperoxidized environment in the ER lumen. ERO1α also binds
  to the ER calcium channels IP3R1 and promotes release of calcium ions into the cell
  cytosol. As a consequence, calcium-sensing enzyme CaMKII is activated, which, in
  turn, triggers induction of NADPH oxidase subunit 2 (NOX2) and subsequent generation
  ROS, that through a positive feedback loop causes activation of CaMKII, thereby
  promoting expression of genes DDIT3 that encode transcription factor CHOP.
