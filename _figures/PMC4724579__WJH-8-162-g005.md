caption: 'Toll-like receptor 9’s signalling pathways influencing hepatocarcinoma.
  TLR9 is present not only in the cytoplasm but also on cells’ membrane. However,
  it is still controversial whether cytoplasmatic stimulation results in increased
  cell viability. Independently, membrane receptors’ stimulation results, not only,
  in up-regulation of apoptosis inhibitors such as survivin, Bcl-xL, XIAP and c-FLIP,
  but also, in a modulation of oncogenic genes with a major contribution in tumorigenesis
  and cancer progression. Additionally, a cytoplasmatic HMGB1-mtDNA interaction was
  proved to be capable of activating TLR9 and MAPK pathway as well as NF-κB leading
  to augmented survival, growth, proliferation, differentiation and migration of cancer
  cells. TLR9: Toll-like receptor 9; XIAP: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein;
  c-FLIP: Cellular FLICE-Like inhibitory protein; MAPK: Mitogen-activated protein
  kinase; NF-κB: Nuclear transcription factor kappa B; HMGB1: High mobility group
