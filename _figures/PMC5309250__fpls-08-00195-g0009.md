caption: Model of ET and H2O2 mediated pathways determining the compatible interaction
  of pear and A. alternata. When pear encounters the pathogen, ET biosynthesis (ACS,
  ACO) and ET signaling pathway (ERFs) are triggered and H2O2 and  productions are
  induced. Consequently, HR and PCD occur and the successful infection is established
  in the susceptible genotype SC1. On the other hand, the ET biosynthesis and ET signaling
  pathway is repressed. The CAT activity is induced to decompose H2O2 into water and
  oxygen. Subsequently, the resistant response of pear to the pathogen is established
  in the resistant genotype CG. R, the resistant genotype CG; S, the susceptible genotype
  SC1; Red boxes, up-regulated expression or increased level of enzyme; green boxes,
  down-regulated expression or reduced level of enzyme.
