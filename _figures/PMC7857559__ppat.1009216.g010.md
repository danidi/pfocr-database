caption: A working model depicting the coordination of MEK/ERK signaling and hr-HPV
  E6/E7 oncoprotein expression leading to progressive loss of differentiation in early
  to late hr-HPV(+) neoplastic progression (adapted from []). (A) EGFR/MEK/ERK signaling
  in the basal layer is important for hr-HPV oncogene expression, which feeds back
  into enhancing ERK1/2 signaling and dampening terminal differentiation. In contrast,
  suppressed EGFR/MEK/ERK signaling in the suprabasal layers leads to reduced E6/E7
  oncogene expression, permitting epithelial differentiation and expression of hr-HPV
  late proteins in LSIL. (B) Consistent with our data and reports that EGFR signaling
  and levels of p-ERK1/2 increase concomitant with HPV oncogene expression during
  progression from LSIL to HSIL, we find EGFR stimulation enhances E6/E7 oncogene
  expression. Our data predict that shifting the balance toward increased ERK1/2 signaling
  in suprabasal layers would cause increased E6/E7 oncogene expression and further
  loss of differentiation, fostering heightened neoplastic phenotypes in HSIL. Greater
  p-ERK1/2 signaling may result from cell-intrinsic alterations in upstream activators
  of ERK, or from cell-extrinsic factors often epidemiologically considered as risk-factors
  with hr-HPV infections progressing to HSIL and cancers. See the  for specifics on
  how estrogen, tobacco smoke, nitric oxide, epithelial wounding and Chlamydia trachomatis
  infection (infx.) contribute to enhanced p-ERK1/2 signaling in the context of an
  hr-HPV infection and may serve to enhance cellular transformation and neoplastic
  progression.
