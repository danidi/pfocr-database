caption: HHP stress induces 285 differentially expressed genes in the mutants. Among
  them, 6 genes, including sca, hth, osa, dad, ilk, and stck have a direct relationship
  with wing development. In addition, Numb, tom, sca, bun, and nedd4 genes have an
  indirectly role in D. melanogaster wing development through Notch signaling pathways.
  The sca gene is common to both. The Notch signaling pathway also affects D. melanogaster
  wing phenotype via the vg target gene, and HHP stress induces two point mutations
  in the vg gene. The two mutations are synonymous mutations. Furthermore, the four
  bases deletion in the exon 1 of vg gene resulting in the change of reading frame
  and the consequent failure to generate functional protein. An insertion sequence
  between the second and third exon of vg indirectly affect the function of protein.
  The coordinated interaction of these abnormal genes is crucial for the wing mutagenesis
  induced by HHP treatment in D. melanogaster.
