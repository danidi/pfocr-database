caption: Flowchart showing the induction of ER stress and its physiological outcomes
  during coronavirus infection. The integrated stress response pathways (including
  PERK) trigger translation shutdown and modulate apoptosis. The ATF6 pathway enhances
  the ER folding capacity, and the IRE1 pathway affects both ER folding and apoptosis
  induction. Pointed arrows indicate activation. The dotted line suggests uncharacterized
  function of GCN2 and HRI during coronavirus infection.
