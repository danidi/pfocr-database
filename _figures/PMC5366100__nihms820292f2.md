caption: Regulation of NOX by H. pylori. NOX1 is induced in gastric epithelial cells
  through a PI3K/RAC1 signaling pathway; in these cells, the production of O2•− stimulate
  the expression of APEX that blocks RAC1. In myeloid cells, the expression of NOX2
  requires a NapA/PI3K signals. DUOX2 has been shown to be induced in the gastric
  tissue of infected animals, but the subcellular localization of this enzyme remains
  unknown. PHD, peroxidase homology domain.
