caption: Schematic of the proposed model for production of IFN-β in response to extracellular
  dsRNA. In this figure, we incorporate our new findings into a diagram that depicts
  known pathways for the sensing of extracellular dsRNA. Uptake of dsRNA engages signaling
  through specific dsDNA receptors, including TLR3, PKR, and RIG-I (). In this study,
  we show that iNOS, PKR, Src, and PKGIβ are all up-regulated at the protein level
  early after dsRNA addition. We have shown previously that ADAR1 is also rapidly
  up-regulated and suppresses dsDNA sensing through the RIG-I pathway (). We now show
  that TLR3/Trif and PKR act together to up-regulate iNOS and Src to promote TLR3-Tyr(P)759
  and IFN-β production. PKR plays a dominant role in the up-regulation of both iNOS
  and Src, and we propose both TLR3-dependent and -independent roles for PKR based
  on our findings. iNOS expression is promoted by a feedforward mechanism that depends
  on cGMP/PKG.
