caption: During normoglycemia, glucose is oxidized through the glycolysis, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation for efficient generation of ATP and reducing
  power (green text). During the chronic hyperglycemia resulting from type 1 or type
  2 DM, excess glucose swamps the glycolytic pathway and inhibits the catabolism of
  glyceraldehydes, leading to the abnormal and excess shunting of the up-stream metabolic
  intermediates to other pathways (red font). These shunting pathways enhance the
  accumulation of reactive oxygen species that cause chronic oxidative stress. The
  reactive oxidative species cause micro- and macrovascular damage and induce chronic
  inflammation (referred to meta-inflammation in the case of metabolic alterations
  associated with type 2 DM). We posit that these alterations jointly contribute to
  compromised immune responses, contributing to the higher risk of DM patients to
  TB, particularly those with poor glucose control. P, phosphate group; PKC, protein
  kinase C; AGE, Advanced glycation end product; RAGE, receptor for AGE.; TCA, tricarboxylic
  acid cycle; Only selected intermediates of the glycolysis pathway are shown.
