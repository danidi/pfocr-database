caption: Negative regulation of the TRAIL-driven pathway. (A) OVAAL, a long non-coding
  RNA, has been shown to promote interaction between STK3 and Raf-1. STK3 and Raf-1
  work synchronously and activate the MEK/ERK pathway; (B) ERK has also been shown
  to stabilize MCL-1. ERK is also activated by TRAF6 and GADD34 to stabilize MCL-1.
  OVAAL is transcriptionally upregulated by c-Myc; (C) Post-translational modifications
  have been shown to effectively regulate caspase-8 and FADD. FADD is negatively regulated
  by C terminus HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP); (D) Caspase-8 is negatively regulated
  by Cullin-7; (E) ITCH involved in the negative regulation of c-FLIP.
