caption: Mechanisms underlying the life-extending and tumor-inhibiting effects of
  calorie restriction in mammals. Inhibition of the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like
  growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signal promotes activation of FoxO1, FoxO3, and Nrf2 transcription
  factors, resulting in activated target genes and inhibition of cancer and aging,
  and thus counteracting “inflammaging.” By contrast, attenuation of the GH-IGF-1
  signal reduces activity of mechanistic target of rapamycin (Mtor). In C. elegans,
  the Daf-2 pathway regulates skn-1 (mammalian Nrf2), although no evidence for this
  regulation is shown in mammals. Sirtuins (Sirts) modulate activities of key molecules
  mediating calorie restriction (CR) effects by epigenetic mechanisms, mostly deacetylation.
  Dotted and straight lines represent attenuated and strengthened signals, respectively.
  Arrows and bars represent activation and inhibition of target molecules, respectively.
