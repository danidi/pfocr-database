caption: Pathogenesis of renin-angiotensin system in acute lung injury caused by viral
  infections. The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to membranes angiotensin converting
  enzyme 2 (ACE2) of and employ type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) for
  Spike protein priming, facilitating the fusion of viral and cellular membranes.
  After SARS-CoV-2 invades cells, it activates the natural antiviral pathway, prompts
  the infected cells to secrete interferon, stimulates bystanders to up-regulate ACE2
  expression, and creates more targets for the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Occupation of
  ACE2 by the virus leads to the reduction of cell surface ACE2 levels. As the virus
  enters the cell, not limited to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, but also H5N1, H7N9 and
  EV71, the angiotensin II (Ang II) levels are significantly upregulated, a large
  amount of Ang II binds to the type 1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1R), then the inflammatory
  signaling pathways are overactivated, and then secrete various cytokines, resulting
  in cytokine storm and eventually lung injury. In the meantime, the ACE2 can cleave
  Ang II into Ang 1-7 which combines with Mas receptor (MasR) to fight against inflammation.
  ACEI and ARB can help restore the RAS balance after viral infections. Moreover,
  clinical-grade human soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) can inhibit the coronavirus invasion
  by binding to coronavirus outside the cell. The blue virus in the figure represents
  coronaviruses, and the other one represents other viruses, such as H1N1, H7N9, and
  EV71.
