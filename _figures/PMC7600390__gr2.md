caption: 'TRPM2-mediated signalling pathways in oxidative stress-induced neuronal
  death associated with ischemia/reperfusion brain damage, AD and PD.(A) Delayed neuronal
  cell death associated with ischemia/reperfusion brain damage. OS resulting from
  reperfusion, based on examining H2O2-induced delayed neuronal cell death in human
  neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, stimulates activation of PKC and NOX, and NOX-mediated
  ROS production. ROS induces activation of PARP and the TRPM2 channel, and TRPM2-mediated
  Ca2+ influx. ROS also induces lysosomal dysfunction and lysosomal Zn2+ release.
  TRPM2-dependent mitochondrial Zn2+ accumulation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction
  and cell death. The cell death mechanisms or pathways are unclear. Mitochondrial
  dysfunction also leads to ROS generation. (B) Aβ42-induced cell death in hippocampal
  neurons associated with AD. Exposure to Aβ42 at pathologically relevant concentrations
  induces a similar signalling pathway as described in (A) to cause mitochondrial
  dysfunction and release of cytochrome c. (C) MPP+-induced neuronal cell death related
  to PD, based on examining MPP+-induced cell death in SH-SY5Y cells. Exposure to
  MPP+ promotes ROS generation that activates the TRPM2 channel, likely via PARP,
  leading to intracellular Ca2+ increase, activation of calpain and pro-apoptotic
  proteins (Bak, Bid and Bad), cyt c release, and caspase-3 activation to initiate
  apoptotic cell death. Abbreviations: Aβ, amyloid-β peptide; ADPR, ADP-ribose; AD,
  Alzheimer''s disease; cyt c, cytochrome c; MPP+, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium; MPTP,
  1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; NOX, NADPH oxidase; PARP, poly(ADPR)
  polymerase; PD, Parkinson''s disease; PKC, protein kinase C; ROS, reactive oxygen
  species.'
