caption: The sketch of RAGE-NADPH-JNK pathway. AGEs-RAGE interaction induced NADPH
  oxidase/Rac1 activation and increased oxidative stress, resulted in the activation
  of the JNK pathway and ultimately led to EPCs apoptosis and dysfunction.
pmcid: PMC4891429
papertitle: Advanced glycation endproducts induce apoptosis of endothelial progenitor
  cells by activating receptor RAGE and NADPH oxidase/JNK signaling axis.
