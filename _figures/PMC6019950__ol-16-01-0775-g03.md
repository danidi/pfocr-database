caption: Signaling pathways of M3R regulates proliferation of urothelium (hypothesis
  based on previous reports). (A) It was speculated that a certain concentration of
  ACh combined to the M3R and stimulates proliferation of normal urothelium. urothelium
  release of ACh. The autocrined and paracrined ACh also combined to M3R. But M3R
  in turn inhibited urothelial proliferation when the concentration of ACh reaches
  a high level. The mechanism maintains the normal metabolism of urothelium. (B) It
  was speculated that the mechanism has changed in bladder cancer. ACh increased due
  to the autocrine and paracrine signals from the bladder urothelium and sub-urothelium
  tissues. However, the negative feedback of M3R on urothelial proliferation failed.
  The PKC pathway serves an important role in the regulation of urothelial proliferation
  of M3R according to the existed data. It is possible that the Ca2+/DG-PKC pathway
  serves a major role in physiological while the PKC/MAPK/NF-κB pathway may serve
  a major role in bladder cancer cells. M3R, M1R, muscarinic cholinergic receptor
  1; PKC/MAPK/NF-κB, protein kinase C/mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor-κB.
