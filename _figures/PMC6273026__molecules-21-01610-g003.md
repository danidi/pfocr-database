caption: Summary of the action of emerging phytochemicals for the prevention and therapy
  of HNSCC. Notably, the phytochemicals that were selected based on their efficacy
  in inhibiting proliferation of HNSCC cells or induction of their apoptosis, all
  inhibited the expression levels of EGFR in human HNSCC cells. Overexpression of
  EGFR plays a critical role in cancer cell growth and cancer cell migration/invasion.
  In general, the inhibition of cell growth and migration capacity of the HNSCC cells
  by the GSPs, GTPs and honokiol is mediated through their effect on the cell cycle
  regulatory proteins, EMT and NF-κB signaling pathway.
