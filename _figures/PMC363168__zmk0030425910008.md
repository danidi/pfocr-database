caption: Model for the role of Sit4 in the cell cycle arrest imposed by K. lactis
  zymocin's γ-toxin subunit. In the absence of γ-toxin (A), the SSD1-v pathway ()
  and Sit4-dependent dephosphorylation of the toxin-target (TOT) substrate () activate
  a key cell cycle regulator (□) required for processes preSTART. In the presence
  of γ-toxin (B), the critical protein can be sequestered and inactivated in combination
  with Sit4's dephosphorylated TOT substrate (•) to induce the G1 arrest (Tot+), irrespective
  of whether the alternative, Sit4-dispensable SSD1-v pathway would be sufficient.
  Failure to dephosphorylate TOT (C) no longer permits inactivation of the crucial
  regulator and causes sit4Δ cells to resist γ-toxicity (Tot-) at the expense of being
  G1 cell cycle delayed. The as yet elusive Elongator-specific kinase is marked by?.
