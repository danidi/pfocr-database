caption: The future of personalized cancer immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting
  and late-stage disease setting. In stage III disease the tumor of the patient will
  be analyzed for previously identified signatures associated with a higher chance
  of response on a certain neoadjuvant treatment combination. The neoadjuvant therapy
  will be based on such signatures. Most of the patients will then have a pathologic
  response, associated with RFS. Patients relapsing will be reanalyzed for their gene
  expression signature, and in combination with the initial result of the neoadjuvant
  therapy, the time to relapse and the new signature the physician can decide to retreat
  the patient with the same combination (in case of detection of the same signature,
  initially MPR, long time to relapse) or choose an alternative combination fitting
  best to the newly detected signature (in case of detection of a deviating signature,
  early relapse after non-response to the neoadjuvant therapy). In that way, personalized
  neoadjuvant therapy will also deliver support for treatment decisions in the late-stage
  situation. aCTLA-4, anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; aPD-1, anti-programmed
  cell death protein 1; CPI, checkpoint inhibitor; MPR, major pathologic response;
