caption: Schematic presentation of common molecular genetic aberrancies in parathyroid
  adenoma (PA; left) and carcinoma (PC; right). Green arrows represent activating
  events (such as activating mutations and/or protein overexpression) while red arrows
  depict deleterious events (inactivating mutations, downregulation or epigenetic
  silencing). Germline RET oncogenic mutations lead to activation of an intracellular
  Erk-RAS cascade followed by initiation of gene transcription and increased proliferation.
  Similarly, germline and somatic MEN1 inactivating mutations affect the regulation
  of the JunD transcription regulator. Moreover, germline and somatic CDC73 mutations
  affect epigenetic, transcriptional and cell cycle programs, underlying the development
  of both PAs and PCs. Additional mechanisms underlying the development of small subsets
  of PAs include mutational or epigenetic silencing of various cyclin-dependent kinase
  inhibitors (CDKIs) and up-regulation of cyclin D1 through a chromosomal inversion
  or via additional unknown mechanisms. Activating mutations in mitochondrial DNA
  (particularly NADH dehydrogenase gene family orthologs) and CTNNB1 (encoding beta-catenin)
  could underly the development of PA cases, although their specific roles as driver
  gene events are debated. For PCs, inactivating CDC73 gene mutations or promoter
  hypermethylation leads to the downregulation of parafibromin (PFIB), which regulates
  epigenetic, transcriptional and cell cycle programs. Depletion of additional cell
  cycle regulators (P53 and pRB) is also a recurrent theme in PC. Moreover, APC is
  in its normal state a negative regulator of the Wnt pathway, thereby inhibiting
  beta-catenin in the absence of upstream signaling from Frizzled type of membrane-bound
  receptors. Hypermethylation of the APC promoter has been demonstrated in PCs, thereby
  enhancing the Wnt pathway output—but APC also has DNA-binding capacity on its own
  and could possibly act independently from beta-catenin. Created with BioRender.com.
