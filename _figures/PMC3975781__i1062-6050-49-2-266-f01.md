caption: Simplified depiction of the cytokine lineage of M1 and M2 macrophages within
  their respective pathways. Monocyte polarity is influenced not only by the interaction
  between dendritic and T helper cells, but largely through the local microenvironment
  in which they invade. In this figure, the proinflammatory environment consists of
  cytokines interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis α (TNF-α).
  Input from the dendritic cell, as well as the microenvironment, helps the naïve
  T helper cell differentiate into a T helper cell of the T helper 1 (Th1) pathway.
  This Th1 cell now will further promote a proinflammatory influence on macrophage
  differentiation, creating an abundance of M1 macrophages that, in turn, produce
  IL-6 and TNF-α in the microenvironment and continuing the cycle. However, this plastic
  differentiation can allow a phenotype transition based on environmental demands.
  Manual therapy may allow for beneficial manipulation of this environment through
  the properties of mechanotransduction. In the event of a phenotypic change from
  an M1 to an M2 macrophage, anti-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 4 (IL-4), transforming
  growth factor β (TGF-β), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) will cause a shift in the microenvironment,
  influencing local dendritic cells to alter the T helper differentiation to the T
  helper 2 (Th2) pathway through IL-4 and interleukin 13 (IL-13). Then, the Th2 cells
  instead can promote macrophage differentiation, creating an abundance of M2 anti-inflammatory
  phenotype and signifying the repair and regeneration phase.
