caption: Increased skeletal muscle glycolysis in DIO mice chronically treated with
  R118. Male HFD DIO C57BL/6 mice (21 weeks old, 17 weeks on HFD) were fed using control
  HFD, HFD formulated with 200 mg/kg R118, or HFD formulated with 5 g/kg metformin
  (n = 12/group). After five weeks of treatment, liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue,
  and plasma were collected for half of the mice in each group. For the remaining
  mice, compound-formulated HFD was replaced with control HFD for 24 hours (washout),
  followed by similar sample collection. Detected changes in skeletal muscle glycolytic
  intermediates for the drug washout samples are shown mapped onto the glycolysis
  pathway. Numbers in parentheses indicate relative fold change for drug treatment
  compared to control HFD. Biochemical data were analyzed using Welch’s two-sample
  t-tests.
