caption: Impact of heteromerization on mu opioid receptor signaling and trafficking.
  Heteromerization can take place in the endoplasmic reticulum. Association with another
  opioid receptor positively modulates mu opioid receptor G protein-dependent signaling
  whereas association with a non-opioid receptor negatively regulates it. Heteromerization
  also favors the recruitment the β-arrrestin dependent pathway upon internalization
  in the endosomal compartments. Native receptor pairs for which information is available
  are indicated.
