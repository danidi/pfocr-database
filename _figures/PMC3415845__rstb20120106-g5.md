caption: 'Evolution of the PI3K-Akt pathway from a modular perspective: focusing on
  the role of the SH2 domains of p85. (a–c) These panels show a gradation of organismal
  complexity as represented by modern organisms. (a) Total absence of the PI3K system
  in the fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). (b) The limited PI3K-Akt system in the
  slime mould (Dictyostelium discoideum) responds primarily to GPCR activation, with
  no direct pTyr involvement. The N- to C-terminal order of domains in p110 (Dd_PIKA/B,
  type class IB) is Ras-binding domain (Ras_bind.), C2 domain, Helical domain (unmarked)
  and the kinase domain (catalytic). PH domain-containing Akt Ser/Thr kinase is recruited
  by the products of PI3K, PtdIns(3,4)P and PtdIns(3,4,5)P, and is activated. Akt
  directs limited downstream signalling responses. Arrows indicate directions of the
  pathways. (c) The fully evolved PI3K class I enzymes (shown with human proteins)
  are able to mediate RTK signalling via the functions of the SH2 adaptor p85 (for
  the class IA type PI3K). In N- to C-terminal order, p85 contains an SH3 domain,
  a BH domain, an SH2 domain, a p110-binding domain (p110_bind.) and a second SH2
  domain. The SH2 domains of p85 bind pTyr on membrane receptors and adaptors. The
  new class IA type p110 enzyme contains an N-terminal p85-binding domain (p85_bind.).
  The activation of class IB type p110γ remains GPCR- (and Ras-) responsive with p101
  acting as its adaptor; however, its role in Akt activation has become less prominent
  (as indicated by shading). The new catalytic class IA type of p110α/β/δ is activated
  primarily in response to RTK signalling, and mediates potent Akt activation, which
  in turn leads to a broad range of downstream pSer/pThr events.'
