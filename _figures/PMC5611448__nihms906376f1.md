caption: Enzymatic oxylipin synthesis pathways. Oxylipins are synthetized from fatty
  acids, such as linoleic acid (LA), arachidonic acid (AA), α-linolenic acid (α-LNA),
  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) through three main enzymatic
  pathways. The cyclooxygenase pathway (COX) produces prostaglandins and resolvins
  from AA and EPA. The lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway produces hydroxy-metabolites, such
  as hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (HODEs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs),
  hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acids (HOTrEs) and hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (HDOHEs).
  Leukotrienes, lipoxins and ketones, such as oxo-octadecadienoic acids (oxo-ODEs)
  and oxo-eicosatetraenoic acids (oxo-ETEs), are also synthetized through the LOX
  pathway. Finally, the cytochrome p450 pathway generates epoxy-metabolites, such
  as epoxyoctamonoemoic acids (EpOMEs), epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EpETrEs), epoxyoctadecadienoic
  acids (EpODEs), epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EpETEs) and epoxydocosapentaenoic acids
  (EpDPEs). These epoxy-metabolites can be converted via the soluble epoxide hydrolase
  (sEH) to their respective diols, dihydroxyoctadecamonoenoic acids (DiHOMEs), dihydroxyeicosatrienoic
  acids (DiHETrEs), dihydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (DiHODEs), dihydroxyeicostetraenoic
  acids (DiHETEs) and dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acids (DiHDPES). On this figure, precursors
  and their respective metabolites share the same color code. Adapted from .
