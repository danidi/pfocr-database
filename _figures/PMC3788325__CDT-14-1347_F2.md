caption: Signaling pathways in RILF. Irradiation induces TGF-β expression. Ligand
  binding to TGF-β activates type II TGF-β receptor serine/threonine kinases. TGF-β
  stimulation results in the induction of Smad proteins, which are transcription factors
  that also induce other transcription factors, including Slug, Snail, Scatter, lymphoid
  enhancing factor-1, and β-catenin. FoxM1 binds to and increases the promoter activity
  of the Snail1 gene. NRF2 binding to a Smad Binding Element (SBE) suppresses TGF-β
  target gene expression. TGF-β1 also activates non-Smad-mediated signaling pathways,
  which are associated with occludin at tight junctions, to phosphorylate Par6. Phosphorylated
  Par6 recruits Smurf1, resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of RhoA, which
  is responsible for stress fiber formation and the maintenance of apical-basal polarity
  and junctional stability. Radiation activates the MEK/ERK signaling pathway by increasing
  ROS generation. Activated ERK1/2 phosphorylates GSK3β, resulting in its inactivation
  and leading to the disassociation of GSK3β and Snail. Unbound Snail then migrates
  to the nucleus and represses E-cadherin, leading to a mesenchymal-like phenotypic
  change.
