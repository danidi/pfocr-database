caption: The APC/C collaborates with two different E2s, UBE2C and UBE2S, to assemble
  branched K11/K48 chains on cyclin A and other mitotic substrates. UBR5 collaborates
  with an unknown K11-specific E3 to form branched K11/K48 chains of a different architecture
  on a pathological mutant version of the Huntingtin protein (HTT-Q73). UBR5 has also
  been reported to synthesize branched K11/K48 chains on newly synthesized misfolded
  polypeptides. Spt23 and substrates of the ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway are
  modified with branched K29/K48 chains synthesized by Ufd4 and Ufd2. ITCH cooperates
  with UBR5 to assemble branched K48/K63 chains on the pro-apoptotic regulator TXNIP.
  Substrates are colored in green; chain branching E3s are colored in light blue;
  the color coding for ubiquitins is as described in Fig. .
