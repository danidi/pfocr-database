caption: Schematics of adrenal steroidogenic pathways. The metabolism of cholesterol
  to pregnenolone by the mitochondrial CYP11A1 is common to all three zones of the
  human adrenal. (A) The mitochondrial/microsomal enzyme HSD3B converts pregnenolone
  to progesterone, which is metabolized to 11-deoxycorticosterone by the microsomal
  CYP21. The final reactions of aldosterone synthesis are catalyzed by the mitochondrial
  CYP11B2, which converts 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone, which is hydroxylated
  at C18 to form 18-hydroxycorticosterone which is then finally converted to aldosterone.
  (B) In the zona fasciculata, the microsomal CYP17 and the mitochondrial/microsomal
  HSD3B can generate 17-hydroxyprogesterone, progesterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone.
  The microsomal CYP21 preferentially metabolizes 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol,
  which is finally metabolized to the glucocorticoid cortisol by the microsomal CYP11B2.
  CYP21 can also metabolize progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone, which CYP11B2
  converts to the glucocorticoid corticosterone, although this pathway is secondary
  in humans (although the principal pathway in rodents). (C) In the zona reticularis,
  CYP17 hydroxylates pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and then DHEA. DHEA is
  the major steroid product of the reticularis, with sulfated DHEA (DHEA-S), androstenedione,
  and testosterone serving as only minor steroidogenic products.
