caption: 'A schematic illustration of the current working hypothesis on IFNT signaling
  in ovine uterine stroma and uterine glandular epithelium compared to uterine luminal
  (LE) and supferficial glandular (sGE) epithelia. IFNT binds to a common Type I IFN
  receptor, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, containing tyrosine kinase such as JAK1 and TYK2 to
  activate the JAK/STAT cell signaling pathway. Phosphorylated STAT1 binds phosphorylated
  STAT2 to form a heterodimer and translocates to the nucleus after forming a heterotrimeric
  transcriptional complex by binding with ISGF3G, collectively termed ISGF3. In addition
  to STAT1/2 heterodimerization, Type I IFN induces formation of phosphorylated STAT1
  homodimers termed GAF. In the nucleus, ISGF3 binds to IFN-stimulated response element
  (ISRE) in promoter regions of ISGs to activate transcription in cooperation with
  several coactivators. Similarly, GAF enters the nucleus, binds to GAS elements,
  and stimulates transcription of ISGs. IFNT-induced IRF2 blocks expression of classical
  interferon stimulated genes in uterine LE/sGE. Legend: IFNT = Interferon tau; IFNAR
