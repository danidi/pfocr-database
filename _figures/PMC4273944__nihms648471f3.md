caption: The Che3pathway in Rhodospirillum centenum. (A) Under cyst non-inducing growth
  conditions, CheS3 phosphorylates CheY3 to repress cyst formation. (B) Under cyst
  inducing growth conditions, MCP3 receives a signal thus activating CheA3, which
  in turn phosphorylates a receiver domain of CheS3, leading to inhibition of the
  CheS3-CheY3 TCS.
