caption: 'Panel A shows 13C incorporation from 13C6-Glc into various metabolites via
  the PDH (pyruvate dehydrogenase) pathway; panel B shows 13C incorporation from 13C6-Glc
  into metabolites via the PCB (pyruvate carboxylase) pathway. ●: 12C; ●: 13C; ●,●
  indicates 13C derived from PDH or PCB mediated Krebs cycle reactions, respectively;
  In panel A, the labeled patterns of the first and second (in brackets) turns of
  the PDH-initiated Krebs cycle are shown. In panel B, 13C3-pyruvate (Pyr) is carboxylated
  to form 13C3-oxaloacetate (OAA), leading to the formation of 13C3-Asp, -malate,
  -fumarate, and -succinate (patterns outside brackets); the labeled structures in
  brackets are derived from the reaction of 13C3-OAA with 13C2- or unlabeled acetyl
  CoA (AcCoA) to form other labeled Krebs cycle intermediates after one cycle turn.
  α-KG: α-ketoglutarate; not all expected labeled patterns of metabolites are shown
