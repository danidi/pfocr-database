caption: Abridged general view for the interplay among Runx2/Dicer/miRNA pathway in
  osteogenesis. MiR-335-5p acts as a suppressor by targeting DKK1, which activates
  Wnt signaling and promotes osteogenic differentiation. MiRNA 17-92 cluster directly
  targets the proapoptotic factor BIM to downregulate BIM expression.
