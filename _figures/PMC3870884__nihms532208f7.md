caption: 'A. β-arr1+/+: In neurons containing β-arr1, the δOR agonist, SNC80, binds
  with δORs and activates ROCK. As β-arr1 is associated with LIMK and one of the phosphatases,
  possibly SSL, within the trans-Golgi network (TGN), this activates cofilin to enhance
  actin filament severing and turnover and regulate δOR release to the cell membrane.
  B. β-arr1−/−. Without the inhibitory control of β-arr1, LIMK phosphorylates and
  inactivates cofilin. This leaves stable actin ‘tracks’ in place to allow unregulated
  but agonist-dependent δOR release to the plasma membrane in an agonist-dependent
  manner. C. Y27632. Preventing ROCK phosphorylation of LIMK by applying Y27632 prevents
  δOR activation of the pathway and agonist-induced release of δORs to the cell membrane.'
