caption: Model of the fMAPK pathway with inputs from bud-site–selection proteins.
  In glucose-rich conditions, axial cues (Bud3p, Bud4p, Axl1p, and Axl2p; Axl2p is
  shown) regulate Cdc24p in the filamentous growth pathway through Rsr1p. Msb2p, Sho1p,
  Opy2p, and Bem4p also regulate the fMAPK pathway through Cdc42p. In glucose-limiting
  conditions, Bud8p regulates Rsr1p-dependent activation of the filamentous growth
  pathway. Glucose limitation also induces processing of Msb2p by Yps1p, which leads
  to Cdc24p activation through Sho1p and Bem4p. Msb2p, Bud8p, and Axl2p are glycosylated
  proteins; CA, cadherin-like repeats; MR, mucin repeats; UPR, unfolded protein response.
