caption: Overview about the role of ACE-2 during SARS CoV-2 infection.Angiotensin
  II can either bind to the angiotensin II receptor type I (AT1-R), where it induces
  vasoconstriction via the phospholipase C (PLC), proteinkinase C (PKC) pathway, or
  be processed by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to generate angiotensin 1–7.
  Afterwards, angiotensin 1–7 can bind to the MAS-receptor (Mas-R), which induces
  a signaling cascade subsequently leading to a vasodilatory effect. During SARS CoV-2
  infection, viral spike protein (S) on the surface of the virus binds to ACE2. After
  processing of the S-protein by the endogenous transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2),
  the viral particle is endocytosed and acidification of the endosome leads to viral
  and cellular membrane fusion and release of viral single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) into
  the cytosol. There, the ssRNA is replicated and translated into viral proteins (N,
  M, E and S). Additional viral mechanisms facilitate the downregulation of endogenous
  ACE2 and upregulation of ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM-17) expression. After
  vesicular transport to the cell surface, ADAM-17 facilitates its role as a “sheddase”
  and cleaves the extracellular domain of ACE2. Moreover, increased extracellular
  cytokine concentrations (TNFα, IFNγ, IL-4) lead to the activation of cellular proinflammatory
  pathways by different cytokine receptors. These pathways further support virus-induced
  downregulation of ACE2 and upregulation of ADAM-17.
