caption: 'Under normal conditions, optimal activation of UPP balances Nrf2 and IκB
  (endogenous inhibitor of NF-κB) levels so that there is no induction of antioxidant
  and inflammatory pathways. While in a normal healthy young person, exposure to infection,
  cigarette smoke or injury induces oxidative stress that results in optimal activation
  of proteasomal pathway via Nrf2 resulting in increased NF-κB-mediated stress response
  that is balanced by induction of protective Nrf2 response. Notably, the UPP modification
  (inherent and/or environmental insult or age-related change) induces degradation
  of both IκB and Nrf2. The lack of compensatory antioxidant gene activation and chronic
  NF-κB activation, thus resulting in persistent oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.
  The inability to regulate protein degradation machinery and aberrant-autophagy results
  in fatal disease.ARE: Antioxidant response element; HIF: Hypoxia-inducible factor;
  Nrf2: Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2; Ub: Ubiquitin; UPR: Ubiquitin
  proteasome response; VCP: Valosin containing protein; VEGF: Vascular endothelial
  growth factor.'
