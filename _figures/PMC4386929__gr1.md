caption: The mathematically modelled pathway from SPGN excitation to smooth muscle
  cell activation. The mathematically modelled pathway from SPGN excitation to smooth
  muscle cell activation. (A) The model of a SPGN from . Action potentials propagate
  down the SPGN axon to the postganglionic terminal. (B) This activates IL and IN,
  triggering the influx of calcium into the postganglionic terminal, increasing .
  Four molecules of intracellular calcium bind to a fusion protein, activating it
  (FA). Once activated, the fusion protein can bind to, and consequently activate,
  a vesicle V. The activated vesicles, VA, are assumed to be pre-docked to the synaptic
  membrane; once activated, it immediately releases its NA contents into the cleft.
  (C1) Released noradrenaline activates α1Rs on the SMC membrane, activating a G-protein
  (G). This G-protein, drives the hydrolysis of PIP2. Hydrolysed PIP2 cleaves to form
  IP3, which activates an IP3R located on the membrane of the SR. Activation of this
  receptor causes an efflux of Ca2+ from the SR (JIP3), increasing . These receptors
  also have inactivation and activation sites for . Fluxes of Ca2+ across the SR membrane
  also exist due to leakage (Jleak) and calcium pumps (Jpump). (C2) The intra-SMC
  matrix contains actin (A) and myosin (M) filaments. At rest these filaments are
  in a detached state, . When the myosin heads are phosphorylated by calcium (MP),
  they able to attach to the actin filaments, yielding the state AMP—a cross-bridge.
  This cross-bridge can then conduct a ‘power stroke’, sliding the actin filament
  and producing a contractile force.
