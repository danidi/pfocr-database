caption: 'Fas (death receptor) signaling pathway and its inhibition. Fas (or other
  death receptor) signaling is triggered on target cells by receptor tri(multi)merization
  subsequent to FasL (or other appropriate trimeric death ligand). Subsequent recruitment
  of FADD (by DD–DD interaction) and procaspase-8 or -10 (by DED–DED interaction)
  leads to upstream caspase (caspase-8 or -10) autoactivation, which initiates apoptosis
  by subsequent cleavage of downstream effector caspases (caspase-3, -6, and -7).
  Death receptor apoptosis can be inhibited at different points (red): at the receptor
  level, e.g., by soluble ligands (a) and/or decoy receptors; (b) by receptor internalization,
  e.g., by adenovirus E3-10.4/14.5K (c); by downregulation of receptor expression,
  e.g., by oncogenic H-Ras (c); during signal transduction by FLIPs (d, e, and f);
  and at the effector stage (by caspase inhibitors, e.g., cowpox-encoded CrmA, baculovirus
  p35, adenovirus 14.7, and/or IAPs [g]).'
