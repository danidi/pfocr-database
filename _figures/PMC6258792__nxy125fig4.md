caption: CREB1 signaling is predicted to be altered by ID. (A) Thirteen genes involved
  in CREB1 signaling were found to be significantly downregulated in the CID hippocampus.
  On the basis of these gene expression changes, CREB1 activity is predicted by IPA
  to be significantly decreased (z score = −3.42, P < 0.001). (B) In the FID hippocampus,
  7 CREB1-regulated genes were found to be significantly upregulated, which predicts
  a significant increase in CREB1 activity (z score = 2.61, P < 0.001). Genes outlined
  in bold are dysregulated in both CID and FID hippocampus. A list of definitions
  of gene and protein names used in this figure is included in . CID, chronically
  iron deficient; CREB1, cAMP response element-binding protein 1; FID, formerly iron
  deficient; ID, iron deficiency; IPA, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
