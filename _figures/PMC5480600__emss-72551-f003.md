caption: 'Macrophage-centered therapeutic approaches are aimed either at activating
  their antitumor activity (Panel A) or inhibiting their recruitment and functions
  related to tumor promotion (panel B).Panel A: the concerted action of microbial
  moieties (acting via TLRs) and IFNγ induces M1-like functional polarization and
  can activate macrophage killing of tumor cells; macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent
  cytotoxicity (ADCC) can mediate the therapeutic effect of therapeutic antibodies;
  interference with the SIRPα-CD47 pathway activates macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent
  phagocytosis (ADCP) and results in functional skewing of macrophages in an M1 direction
  and antitumor activity; an anti-CD40 antibody re-educates M2-like macrophages in
  the tumor microenvironment, leading to re-establishment of tumor immune surveillance.Panel
  B: Inhibition of monocyte-attracting molecules, including chemokines (e.g CCL2,
  CCL5), VEGF, CSF-1 and complement mediators (C5a) with specific monoclonal antibodies
  (e.g. carlumab, emactuzumab) or antagonists (e.g. maraviroc) prevent macrophage
  recruitment to the tumor microenvironment, reducing tumor growth and dissemination;
  inhibitors of CSF-1 have also the potential to inhibit macrophage survival; Trabectedin
  activates a caspase-dependent pathway of apoptosis, selectively in cells of the
  monocyte lineage, causing a partial depletion of circulating monocytes and TAM;
  the protective function of NAIDS, aspirin in particular, against primary cancer
  and metastasis relies on the inhibition of prostaglandin production, which have
  immunosuppressive properties; TAM contribute to suppression of adaptive immunity
  by expression of immunosuppressive molecules, such as IDO, cyclooxygenases (COX1,2),
  TGFβ and IL-10. Moreover, TAM express triggers of checkpoint blockade, such PD-L1,
  PD-L2, B7H4 and VISTA.TLR: Toll-like receptors; IFNRα: interferon receptor alpha;
  FcR: Fc receptor, mAb: monoclonal antibody; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor;
  CSF-1: colony-stimulating factor; NAIDS: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; IDO:
  indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; TGFβ: transforming growth factor β; IL-10: interleukin
