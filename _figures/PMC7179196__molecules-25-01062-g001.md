caption: Schematic representation of PPAR-α and PPAR-γ signal cascade following their
  activation by endogenous or synthetic ligands. PPAR-α endogenous and synthetic agonists,
  including PEA and the fibrates, activate PPAR-α that dimerizes with the retinoid
  X-receptor (RXR) and activates the calcium influx through transcriptional regulation
  of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which in turn promotes hippocampal
  brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) signaling cascade. PPAR-α activation also
  upregulates both the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which forms
  a complex with cholesterol and translocator protein (TSPO) allowing the entry of
  cholesterol into the inner mitochondria membrane where cholesterol is transformed
  into pregnenolone (PE), the precursors of all neurosteroids, through the cholesterol
  side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc). PE, which is translocated to cortical and
  hippocampus glutamatergic pyramidal neurons is then converted in allopregnanolone.
  Allopregnanolone enhances γ-aminobutyric acid action at GABAA receptors [,] and
  improves emotional behavior. Allopregnanolone may also exert an important anti-inflammatory
  action by binding at α2-containing GABAA receptor subtypes located in glial cells,
  through inhibition of toll-like 4 receptor/NF-κB pathway []. PPAR-γ agonists potentiate
  the PPAR-γ-induced inhibitory action on NF-κB, which is responsible for microglial
  activated status, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, NF-κB inhibits
  the hippocampal BDNF signaling cascade [,]. Thus, PPAR-γ agonists exert an anti-inflammatory
  effect, by decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, as well as
  the JAK-2/STAT3 pathway, which is involved in immunity processes. Additionally,
  activation of PPAR-γ plays a neuroprotective action by decreasing the inhibition
  on BDNF signaling pathway.
