caption: The proposed biosynthetic pathway for the production of terminally sialylated
  proteins in the periplasm of E. coli, and associated plasmid constructs. Synthesis
  of CMP-Neu5Ac is achieved by the sub-pathway constructed with overexpressed neuBCA
  genes from C. jejuni (1). Synthesis of the pentasaccharide LLOs Gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc-β-1,3-Gal-β-1,3-GlcNAc-β-pp-undecaprenol
  and Neu5Ac-α-2,6-Gal-β-1,4-GlcNAc-β -1,3-Gal-β-1,3-GlcNAc- is achieved by the sub-pathway
  constructed with GlcNAc-1-phosphate glycosyltransferase (WecA) enzyme (2), glycosyltransferases
  (LsgCDEF) (3), and the α-2,6-STase (pl-ST6) enzyme (4). The sialylated glycan is
  flipped by PglK (or Wzx) flipases from the cytoplasmic to the periplasmic side of
  the membrane (5). The final modification of the target protein with the synthesized
  glycan is achieved by PglB (6).
