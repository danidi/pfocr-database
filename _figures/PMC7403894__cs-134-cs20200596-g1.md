caption: 'HSR is a biochemical route mainly centered at the heat shock transcription
  factor-1 (HSF1) that leads to massive production of the 70 kDa family of heat shock
  proteins (HSP70). HSF1 may be directly activated by PGE2-induced rise in temperature
  (fever), by heat shock (HS), by estrogen (E2) and by the antiviral cyclopentenone
  prostaglandins (cyPGs), such as the PGE2-derivative PGA2, whose physiological production
  is enhanced at late stages of inflammation. At this time during an inflammatory
  response (approximately 48 h after stimuli), a second-wave cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2)
  expression takes place and the production of pro-inflammatory PGs is replaced with
  that of cyPGs. Since various components of the HSR, including HSP70 and HSF1, both
  directly and indirectly blocks the activation and transcribing activity of NF-κB,
  which is the master inflammatory nuclear factor, HSR is anti-inflammatory per se.
  On the other hand, the use of antipyretics/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
  (NSAIDs), while alleviating inflammation-related discomfort, severely blunts the
  resolution phase of inflammation via HSR. Of note, HSF1 depresses the production
  of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα) at gene regulatory level
  (not shown herein). Conformational changes in unfolded proteins can be relied to
  HSF1 either directly (e.g. following oxidative stress and the formation of reactive
  oxygen and nitrogen species, ROS/RNS), via alterations in glutathione (GSH)/protein
  sulphydryl redox status or, finally, after the activation of the unfolded protein
  response (UPR) protocol that activates HSF1 through sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) route. This
  branch of the HSR takes place through UPR-mediated activation of HuR (also known
  as ELAV1), an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes SIRT1 mRNA and, consequently,
  its expression. SIRT1 downstream signals can also be conveyed to the HSR pathway
  via metabolic alterations (e.g. ↑NAD+/NADH or ↑AMP/ATP ratios) and the consequent
  activation of 5′-AMP kinase (AMPK). Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), which
  constitutively inhibits HSF1 and the HSR, may be inhibited by AMPK and glutamine
  (via the hexosamine biochemical pathway, HBP), thus increasing anti-inflammatory
  HSR under energy-restriction situations, exercise or pharmacologically via the antidiabetic
  drug metformin. As HSP70 are protein chaperones that impede the formation of protein
  aggregates, the HSR is critical to avoid chronic activation of NLRP3 inflammasome
  and, consequently, low-grade chronic inflammatory diseases. Other abbreviations:
  NF-κB, nuclear factor transcription factors of the kappa light chain enhancer of
  activated B cells (κB) family; NLRP3 inflammasome, NLR [nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain (NOD)-leucine-rich repeat- and pyrin-domain (LRP) containing protein]-3 inflammasome;
  NOS, nitric oxide synthase; PGC-1α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-1
  alpha subtype; TLR, Toll-like receptors. Green arrows indicate direct stimulatory
  pathways while red lines indicate inhibition. Thicknesses of lines indicate their
  relative degree of stimulation/inhibition as compared to the other pathways.'
