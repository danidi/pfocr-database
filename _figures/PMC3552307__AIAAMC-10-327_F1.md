caption: Double-stranded and single-stranded RNA signaling pathway. Double-stranded
  RNA is recognized in the cytosol by RIG-I or in the endosome by TLR3, whereas ssRNA
  is recognized by TLR7 in the endosome. Binding of dsRNA to RIG-I recruits MDA5 and
  the complex interacts with IPS-1 present in the mitochondrial membrane. Interaction
  of IPS-1 with TRAF3, NAK-associated protein 1 (NAP1), IKKε and TBK1 results in activation
  of transcription factors (TFs) IRF3 and IRF7 and induction of type I IFN genes.
  Interaction of IPS-1 with NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), receptor-interacting
  protein 1 (RIP-1) and the IKK complex, or NIK and IKKα results in the release of
  active NF-κB and induction of various genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines
  and chemokines. In the endosome, binding of dsRNA with TLR3 results in the recruitment
  of TRIF and RIP-1 which can interact with TRAF6 or TRAF3. Interaction with TRAF6
  and IL-1 receptorassociated kinase (IRAK) leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines through activation of TFs NF-κB and activating protein 1 (AP-1). In the
  endosome, binding of ssRNA to TLR7 recruits MyD88 which can interact with TRAF6
  or TRAF3. The TLR7, MyD88, TRAF6 pathway intersects with the TLR3 TRAF6 pathway
  to induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The TLR7, MyD88, TRAF3 pathway
  results in activation of TFs IRF5 and IRF7, resulting in induction of type I IFNs
  [, ]. Apoptosis is also induced following binding of dsRNA to either TLR3 or RIG-I
  via FADD/Caspase 8 or TRAF2/Caspase9, respectively []. Influenza virus (IV) NS1
  protein can inhibit the signaling pathway by binding to dsRNA preventing its recognition
  by RIG-I/ TLR3, inhibiting RIG-I, IPS-1, nuclear translocation of IRF3 or IPS-1-induced
  apoptosis [, ]. RSV NS2 protein can also inhibit RIG-I, IRF3 and IPS-1-induced apoptosis
  [, ]. SARS-Co-V [] also inhibits IPS-1-induced apoptosis and rhinovirus (RV) []
  has been shown to inhibit IPS-1.
