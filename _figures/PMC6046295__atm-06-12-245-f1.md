caption: Mechanosignaling in normal keratinocytes and psoriasis. (A) In normal skin,
  mechanical forces can activate AP-1 (activator protein 1), YAP (Yes-associated protein)/TAZ
  [transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (WWTR1) pathway through integrin-ECM
  (extracellular matrix) interaction]. They also promote cytoplasmic β-catenin to
  activate ROCK (Rho-associated protein kinase), therefore supporting the tight junctions
  (such as E-cadherins), and provoke calcium waves, that are recognized by CaSR (calcium
  sensing receptor) and TRP (transient receptor potential) channels. This is followed
  by the proper signaling to promote proliferation of keratinocytes, control of terminal
  differentiation and expression of keratins. PC1 (polycystin-1) is an important sensor
  of mechanical forces and operates either by regulating other downstream pathways,
  such as inactivation of mTOR pathway or in cooperation with the PC2 (polycystin-2)
  by creating a calcium ion influx channel. (B) In psoriatic plaques, it has been
  found that mechanical forces activate Wnt pathway and transport of β-catenin into
  the nucleus, activate Notch pathway and decrease levels of nuclear AP-1. Also, CaSR
  and TRP channels seem to malfunction or have aberrant expression. As a result, abnormal
  destruction of tight junctions is observed, abnormal gene regulation and inflammation.
  In psoriatic plaques, it has been observed decreased expression of PC1, which leads
  to activation of the mTOR pathway and increase in migration and proliferation of
  keratinocytes.
