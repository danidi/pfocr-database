caption: (A) eIF2α phosphorylation determines the concentration of ternary complex
  and consequently the rate of translation initiation. Under normal or post-stress
  conditions (left), levels of phosphorylated eIF2α are kept at low levels in the
  cell due to expression of regulatory subunits of the phosphatase PP1 (GADD34 and
  CReP), which complex with PP1 and direct PP1 phosphatase activity to eIF2α. The
  drug salubrinal is a selective inhibitor of the PP1 complex and prevents dephosphorylation
  of eIF2α-P (). eIF2B, which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the γ subunit
  of eIF2, freely binds to and dissociates from unphosphorylated eIF2α in the eIF2
  complex. In its GTP form, eIF2 assembles into a ternary complex along with methionine-charged
  tRNA (eIF2 GTP Met-tRNAi). The ternary complex binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit
  to form the 43S preinitiation complex, which is then capable of initiating translation
  at an AUG sequence of the appropriate context on an mRNA transcript. Recognition
  of the start codon catalyzes GTP to GDP on eIF2, which is then released from the
  40S subunit for another cycle of translation initiation. When eIF2α-P levels are
  low, ternary complex concentration is high and normal mRNA transcripts with short
  5’ UTRs are translated with high efficiency. However, transcripts like BACE1 with
  long, uORF-containing, secondary structure-rich 5’UTRs are inefficiently translated.
  Under stress conditions (right), eIF2α is phosphorylated by one of four different
  kinases in response to various stimuli. In this case, eIF2B does not readily dissociate
  from phosphorylated eIF2α in the eIF2α complex, inhibiting the exchange of GDP for
  GTP on the γ-subunit of eIF2 and effectively reducing the concentration of ternary
  complex. In this case, the translation of normal mRNA transcripts is inhibited,
  while transcripts with long, uORF-containing, structured 5’UTRs are paradoxically
  translated with increased efficiency (de-repression). (B) Model for eIF2α phosphorylation-dependent
  de-repression of BACE1 mRNA translation, based on yeast GCN4 mRNA translational
  regulation (). The BACE1 5’ UTR is 453 nucleotides long, has three uORFs (numbered
  boxes), and has predicted stable secondary structure with a free energy of -215.3
  kcal/mol (). uORF2 has been shown to be the major uORF that inhibits BACE1 mRNA
  translation under normal conditions (; ). A stable stem-loop structure (indicated
  by the hair-pin) is predicted downstream of uORF 2 (). The AUGs of the three ORFs
  are in favorable contexts, and reports indicate that they are translated (De Pietri
  Tonelli et al., 2004; ; ). In our model, ribosomes would bind to the BACE1 mRNA
  cap, scan down the 5’ UTR, and initiate translation first at uORF1. After translation
  of uORF1 is terminated and the 60S subunits dissociate, a proportion of 40S subunits
  remain attached and continue to scan along the BACE1 mRNA 5’ UTR. Under normal conditions,
  levels of phosphorylated eIF2α are low (left) and ternary complex concentrations
  are high. In this case, 40S subunits are efficiently reloaded with ternary complexes,
  43S preinitiation complexes are rapidly formed, and translation reinitiation occurs
  at uORF2. A rare proline codon at the 3’ end of uORF2 (boxed P; ) and downstream
  stable secondary structure () increase dissociation of ribosomes from the BACE1
  mRNA, reducing the proportion of 40S subunits that scan through the BACE1 mRNA 5’
  UTR and reach the authentic BACE1 start codon for reinitiation. As a consequence,
  translation of the BACE1 ORF is inefficient under normal conditions. In contrast,
  under cellular stress conditions, phosphorylated eIF2α levels are high (right) and
  ternary complex concentrations are low. Translation initiation is still predicted
  to occur first at uORF1. Following termination of uORF1 translation, a proportion
  of 40S subunits remain attached and continue scanning the 5’ UTR, as in low eIF2α-P
  conditions. However, when eIF2α-P is high, decreased ternary complex availability
  causes the 40S subunit to spend more time scanning before becoming reloaded to form
  the 43S preinitiation complex. As a result, a higher proportion of 40S subunits
  scan through uORF2-3 and reach the authentic BACE1 AUG to reinitiate translation
  at the BACE1 ORF. Thus, BACE1 mRNA translation is more efficient under stress conditions
  than normal. (C) Common risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease such as age, high cholesterol,
  cardiovascular disease, traumatic brain injury, and ApoE4 genotype may lead to a
  state of impaired energy metabolism in the brain. Reduced energy availability activates
  the eIF2α-P stress-response pathway in neurons. Phosphorylation of eIF2α augments
  the translation of specific stress response proteins such as BACE1. Increased production
  of these stress-response proteins presumably enhances the ability of neurons to
  survive under low-energy conditions. However, if the stress persists, eIF2α phosphorylation
  and BACE1 levels remain chronically elevated, leading to increased Aβ production.
  Even a small increase in Aβ generation may have a significant impact on amyloid
  accumulation over the many years apparently required for AD development. Elevated
  Aβ levels may, in turn, cause neuronal dysfunction and stress, feeding back and
  further activating the eIF2α-P stress-response pathway. Over time, and in combination
  with other exacerbating factors such as impaired Aβ clearance/degradation, Aβ begins
  to accumulate in the brain and plaques form. Aβ accumulation may trigger downstream
  pathology, (e.g., tau hyperphosphorylation), ultimately leading to neurodegeneration
  associated with sporadic Alzheimer’s disease. (UPR = unfolded protein response).
