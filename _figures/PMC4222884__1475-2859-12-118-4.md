caption: 'Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and pathways for acetate and ethanol formation. (A)
  Shown is the detailed representation of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway explicitly summarizing
  the reducing equivalents required for carbon fixation. (B) Pathway showing acetate
  formation and ethanol formation from acetyl-coA. Reaction abbreviations: FDH7 (formate
  dehydrogenase), FTHFLi (formate-tetrahydrofolate ligase), MTHFC (methenyltetrahydrofolate
  cyclohydrolase), MTHFD (methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP)), MTHFR5
  (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Ferredoxin) Electron bifurcating), METR
  (Methyltetrahydrofolate:corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein methyltransferase), CODH_ACS
  (CODH/Acetyl-CoA synthase), PTAr (phospotransacetylase), ACKr (acetate kinase),
  ACALD (acetaldehyde dehydrogenase), ALCD2x (ethanol dehydrogenase). Yellow nodes
  indicate the oxidized form of reducing equivalents and blue nodes indicate the reduced
  form.'
