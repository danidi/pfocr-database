caption: 'The gene RE frequencies in the cell cycle pathway. The gene up-RE frequencies
  at each HCC stage are mapped as a grid on the cell cycle pathway (KEGG: hsa04110)
  by using a public software PathwayExplorer []. In a grid, columns represent very
  early (VE), early (E), advance (A) and very advance (VA) HCCs, respectively. Rows
  represent genes annotated with the identical function in the pathway. The representative
  gene names are labeled in the center of the grids.'
