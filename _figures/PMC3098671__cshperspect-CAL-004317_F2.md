caption: The UPR. At a normal [Ca2+]ER the ER-stress sensors are scaffolded and inactivated
  by GRP78/BiP. Protein trafficking and quality-control mechanisms work normally.
  Polypeptides are translocated through Sec61 and glycosylated. This transport is
  facilitated by the molecular chaperone GRP78/BiP. Glucosidases then prepare the
  glycoprotein for binding to the ER lectins, calreticulin, and calnexin, whereas
  oxidoreductases catalyze disulfide-bond formation. ER-resident chaperones facilitate
  the proper folding of the nascent protein and prevent its aggregation. Further deglucosidation
  releases the ER lectins and once the protein is correctly folded and processed,
  the protein leaves the ER via the coat protein (COPII)-coated vesicles to the secretory
  pathway. Misfolded proteins, in contrast, associate with various chaperones, including
  GRP78/BiP, and are removed from the ER through ERAD. In contrast, when the [Ca2+]ER
  is chronically decreased, the function of chaperones becomes disturbed and unfolded
  proteins accumulate and act as a sponge for luminal GRP78/BiP. As a consequence,
  ER-stress sensors are devoid of GRP78/BiP and become activated, yielding early adaptive
  responses promoting survival (indicated in green) or late responses promoting apoptosis
  under conditions of severe or on-going ER stress (indicated in red). Ire1 undergoes
  dimerization and activation of its kinase and endoribonuclease activity, thereby
  splicing XBP1 mRNA and yielding a potent transcriptional activator that induces
  the expression of genes involved in ERAD, protein folding (like GRP78/BiP), and
  lipid synthesis. ATF6 goes to the Golgi compartment, where it is proteolytically
  cleaved to yield a cytosolic fragment (p50) that migrates to the nucleus and activates
  the transcription of UPR genes, like GRP78/BiP and CHOP. PERK dimerizes, autophosphorylates,
  and phosphorylates eIF2α, thereby suppressing its activity and reducing the rate
  of translation initiation, while increasing the rate of translation of ATF4, a potent
  transcription factor that augments the expression of genes involved in antioxidative
  stress, amino acid metabolism, and protein chaperoning. During on-going ER stress
  or irreparable ER damage, apoptotic pathways are activated. Ire1 phosphorylates
  JNK, leading to inhibition of Bcl-2 activity and activation of Bim, and recruits,
  releases, and activates procaspases in the cytosol. Induction of CHOP via XBP1,
  ATF6 or ATF4, down-regulates prosurvival Bcl-2-family members, increases prodeath
  proteins (like Bim) and ROS, and decreases the levels of glutathione, a ROS scavenger.
  In the presence of ROS, Ca2+ transfer to the mitochondria leads to the release of
  cytochrome c. The balance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2-family members
  is disturbed, with activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
