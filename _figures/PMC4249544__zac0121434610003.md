caption: 'Central carbon metabolism, including glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway,
  and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Significantly enhanced or decreased FC of intracellular
  metabolite amounts are marked with up or down arrows (P ≤ 0.01). Alterations within
  120 min after antibiotic treatment with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, fosfomycin,
  and ampicillin and within 30 min of vancomycin treatment were taken into account.
  Data are based on mean values for quintuplicate samples. The arrows are colored
  according to the antibiotic stress: red, ciprofloxacin; green, erythromycin; blue,
  vancomycin; orange, ampicillin; and purple, fosfomycin. Metabolite abbreviations:
  glc, glucose; frc, fructose; sed, sedoheptulose; ery, erythrose; pg, phosphoglycerate;
  dhap, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; ga-3p, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; 1,3-bpg, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate;
  pep, phosphoenolpyruvate; pyr, pyruvate; ac-CoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; cit, citrate;
  acn, aconitate; isocit, isocitrate; 2-og, 2-oxoglutarate; succ-CoA, succinyl-coenzyme
  A; succ, succinate; fum, fumarate; mal, malate; gl-6p, 6-phosphogluconate; ru-5p,
  ribulose 5-phosphate; r-5p, ribose 5-phosphate; xu-5p, xylulose 5-phosphate; prpp,
