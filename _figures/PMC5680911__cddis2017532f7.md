caption: 'Simplified graphical scheme representing the effect of Caspase-8 depletion
  on hepatic apoptosis and steatosis in the pathogenesis of ALD. Left: In WT hepatocytes,
  EtOH exposure induces both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis with a favorable shift
  towards Caspase-8-dependent extrinsic signaling. In addition, Caspase-8 plays an
  unexpected and presumably non-apoptotic role in the metabolism of hepatic free fatty
  acids (FFA) and triglycerides (TG) thereby contributing to pronounced liver steatosis.
  Right: Inhibition of Caspase-8 results in abrogation of the extrinsic apoptosis
  pathway. Instead, alcohol-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) result in enhanced
  mitochondrial permeability transition, enhanced cytoplasmic cytochrome c release
  and enhanced intrinsic apoptosis signaling eventually leading to equal net apoptosis.
  However, lack of Caspase-8 is associated with reduced production of FFA and TG eventually
  leading to attenuated liver steatosis'
