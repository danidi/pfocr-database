caption: Model of the FA pathways involved in Aβ-induced neuronal dystrophy. Fibrillar
  Aβ binds to and induces the clustering of the integrin receptors, leading to the
  activation of paxillin and FAK and their translocation to the nascent FA complex.
  Paxillin binds to vinculin, which promotes microfilament stabilization at the FA
  site. PTP-PEST binds to paxillin, leading to dephosphorylation of several FA proteins,
  which prevents the stabilization of the FA contact, allowing the neuron to continuously
  respond to fibrillar Aβ stimuli. Alternatively, APP binds to Aβ fibrils, bringing
  them in contact with integrins, activating FA signaling through FE65, which binds
  to the C terminus of APP and associates with c-abl, which in turn binds and phosphorylates
  paxillin, or both. A pathway involving fyn, which is downstream of PTP-PEST, promotes
  GSK3β activity, whereas the interaction of cbl with c-abl increases CDK5 activity
  (). Both CDK5 and GSK3β hyperphosphorylate tau, leading to microtubular destabilization
  and neuronal dystrophy. An alternative pathway involving FAK activity leads to neuronal
  cell death but not neuronal dystrophy. Paxillin contains four SH2-binding domains
  (red), five Leu-rich LD domains (light blue), one Pro-rich SH3-binding domain (green)
  and four LIM domains (purple). MF, microfilaments;hyperphosp., hyperphosphorylated;
  P, phosphate groups.
