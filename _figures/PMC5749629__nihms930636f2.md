caption: Hepatic methionine metabolism is closely linked to GSH synthesis. Nearly
  half of the daily intake of methionine is catabolized in the liver via methionine
  adenosyltransferase (MAT), generating S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe), the principal
  biological methyl donor that donates its methyl group to a large variety of acceptor
  molecules in reactions catalyzed by methyltransferases (MTs). Transmethylation produces
  S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which is a potent inhibitor of all transmethylation
  reactions. SAH is hydrolyzed by SAH hydrolase, in a reversible reaction generating
  homocysteine and adenosine. The thermodynamics of SAH hydrolase favors biosynthesis
  rather than hydrolysis so that prompt removal of homocysteine and adenosine is required
  to prevent SAH accumulation. Homocysteine can be remethylated to form methionine
  or converted to cysteine (Cys) via the transsulfuration pathway, a two-step enzymatic
  process catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionase (CSE), both
  requiring vitamin B6. Remethylation of homocysteine can occur via methionine synthase
  (MS), which requires folate and vitamin B12 and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT), which requires betaine. The liver has the highest transsulfuration activity
  of all tissues, which allows methionine to be effectively utilized for GSH synthesis.
