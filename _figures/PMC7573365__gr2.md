caption: 'During atrial pacing at 900 ms cycle length (A1), a ventricular premature
  beat is delivered 700 ms after the last atrial stimulation (V2), followed by an
  atrial stimulation (A2). A2 then invariably conducted via a long slow pathway (SP)
  to the ventricle (V3). Upper panel: Surface electrocardiogram and intracardiac electrograms.
  Lower panel: Laddergram. Black and red arrows with large and small dotted lines
  depict each pathway (antegrade fast pathway [FP] and SP, retrograde FP and SP).
  Blue bar shows effective refractory periods (ERPs) of FP. Yellow bars show ERPs
  of SP. Conduction via the antegrade FP by a stimulus from high right atrium (HRA)
  (a). Conduction via the antegrade SP collided with (or interfered by) conduction
  via the retrograde SP distally (b). Conduction via the retrograde FP after V2 collided
  with conduction from the antegrade FP by a stimulus from HRA (A2) (c). Since the
  conduction via the retrograde SP by V2 terminated distally, ERP of the SP ended
  before the SP conduction of A2 arrived at the distal site of retrograde block, thus
  allowing A2 to propagate to the His via the antegrade SP (d).'
