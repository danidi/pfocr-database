caption: Model of the intrastriatal network during OGD. The scheme represents the
  involvement of the NO/cGC/cGMP signaling pathway in the ischemic LTP in the striatum.
  A D1-like-R-mediated activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in NOS positive interneuron
  determines nitric oxide (NO) production. NO increases cGMP levels within MSNs of
  the direct and indirect pathways by activating intracellular sGC. D1-like-R antagonism
  (SCH23390) or inhibition of NOS (7-Nina or L-Name) prevented i-LTP induction, while
  a NO donor (SNAP) restores i-LTP of both the A2A- and the SP-expressing MSNs. Ischemic
  LTP is prevented by inhibiting sGC with ODQ, or inhibiting PKG with Rp-8Br-PET-cGMP,
  and restored by application of the c-GMP analog 8Br-cGMP in medium spiny neurons.
