caption: Regulation of bile acid synthesis. Intermediates and endproducts of the bile
  acid pathway regulate the expression of two genes in the liver (cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase
  and sterol 12α-hydroxylase) that synthesize conjugated bile salts through intricate
  regulatory schemes involving nuclear receptors [farnesoid X receptor (FXR), short
  heterodimer partner (SHP), liver X receptor (LXR), liver receptor homolog (LRH),
  hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α)], polypeptide hormones (FGF15) produced in
  the gut, and hepatic cell surface receptors [fibroblast growth factor 4 receptor
  (FGFR4)/βKlotho]. See text for details.
