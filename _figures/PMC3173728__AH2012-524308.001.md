caption: 'In this figure we show the two main pathways to apoptosis, and their interaction
  through the molecule BID, since death receptors activate the intrinsic pathway by
  activating BID. Either BAX or BAK are required for apoptosis, where they oligomerize
  in the mitochondrial outer membrane and induce the release of cytochrome c. DISC:
  death-inducing signaling complex, FADD: FAS-associated protein with death domain,
  TRAIL: TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, APAF-1: apoptotic protease-activating
  factor, IAP: inhibitor of apoptosis proteins.'
