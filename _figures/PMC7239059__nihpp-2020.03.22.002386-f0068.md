caption: (a) Significant interactions identified by AP-MS between SARS-CoV-2 baits
  (red diamonds) and human prey proteins (orange circles) are shown as in . Chemoinformatic
  and target analysis identified approved drugs (green), clinical candidates (yellow),
  and preclinical candidates (purple) with experimental activities against the host
  proteins and processes, with representative chemicals shown. (b) Inosine Monophosphate
  Dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) regulates de novo nucleic acid biosynthesis. It is a target
  for proliferative diseases including cancer and autoimmune disorders, for instance
  by the approved drug mycophenolic acid, and as a broad spectrum antiviral by Ribavirin.
  While Ribavirin has activity against SARS in vitro, it has low tolerability, something
  that might be addressed by the more selective Merimepodib, which is in phase II
  clinical trials. (c) The mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a master
  regulator of cell proliferation and autophagy, which viruses including Influenza
  A are known to modulate,. Several proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 baits,
  including components of the Respiratory complex 1 by Nsp7, Nsp12, and Orf9c, the
  leucine importer B(0)AT2 (SLC6A15), by Nsp6 and LARP1) by N (not shown). In addition
  to Rapamycin, the mTOR pathway can be indirectly modulated by metformin, a widely
  prescribed diabetes drug, and by Sapanisertib, a drug in clinical trials for solid
  tumors.
