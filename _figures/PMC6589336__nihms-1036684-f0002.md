caption: (A) Complex layered microRNA (miR) classification circuits incorporating
  gene of interest (GOI) can be engineered via cell specific, high and/or low microRNA
  sensors. The circuit requires high levels of miR-A and low levels of miR-B and C
  for transcription of the GOI. EC, Engineered DNA Circuit (B) The dCas9 system can
  be used to implement multiplexed activation and repression of GOI’s by various effector
  proteins, including transcription activators (VP64) and repressors (KRAB), DNA demethylases
  (TET1), and chromatin remodelers (p300), either (i.) tethered directly to the Cas9
  protein, or (ii.) fused to an RNA binding domain such as MCP, Com, or PCP. M, modular
  effector domain []. (C) Bacchus and colleagues engineered “sender/receiver” and
  “processor” cells []. The genetic circuit interactions shown were successfully utilized
  to generate a two-way communication system that controls the permeability of an
  endothelial cell layer by VEGF and Ang1 expression. TRT, l-tryptophan-dependent
  transactivator; AlcR, acetaldehyde-dependent transactivator; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor; Ang1, Angiopoietin-1. (D) Morsut and colleagues developed “synNotch”
  system [] which incorporates modified Notch signaling pathway components into cells
  to create multi-layered self-organizing ring patterns. Sender cell displays GFP
  on plasma membrane that interacts with anti-GFP synNotch on receiver cell. SynNotch
  releases tTA and expresses both CD19 and red fluorescent reporter proteins. CD19
  triggers anti-CD19 synNotch receptor on the adjacent cell and induces BFP. Figures
