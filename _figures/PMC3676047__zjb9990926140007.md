caption: Schematic showing how different mutations affect the shape regeneration of
  E. coli LI spheroplasts. Through a series of reductive division events and periods
  of elongation, LI spheroplasts derived from wild-type (WT) cells produce branched
  intermediates that eventually give rise to normally shaped rod cells (far right).
  LI spheroplasts lacking Lpp or PBP6 produce mostly coccoidal cells, and only a few
  may eventually become rod shaped. Cells lacking PBP6 that become rod shaped do so
  by generating an elongated protrusion instead of by reductive division (not shown).
  LI spheroplasts lacking PBP5 produce a very high proportion of extremely aberrantly
  shaped and branched cells before reproducing their normal rod-shaped dimensions.
  LI spheroplasts lacking PBP1B, LpoB, or components of the Rcs stress pathway do
  not recover but instead enlarge and lyse. The enlarged spheroidal cells of mutants
  lacking PBP1B or LpoB contain peripheral vesicles derived by partial invagination
  of the IM, but such vesicles are absent from spheroidal cells derived from cells
  that cannot mount an Rcs response.
