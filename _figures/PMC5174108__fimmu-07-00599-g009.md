caption: 'Illustration of the likely apoptosis pathway in action following C1q binding
  to SKOV3 cells. Exogenous treatment of SKOV3 cells with C1q and individual globular
  head modules can induce upregulation of TNF-α and Fas. TNF-α stimulation triggers
  two parallel, but contrasting, pathways: the pro-apoptotic caspase () and the anti-apoptotic
  NFκB-IκB inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) pathway (). The cell survival or
  death, however, depends upon interactions among the components of these two pathways
  as well as other factors such as mitochondrial dysfunction (, ). TNF-α can bind
  to TNF type I receptor (TNFR1), which is then internalized to first form a complex
  with TNFR1-associated DEATH domain, receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1), TNF receptor-associated
  factor 2 (TRAF2), and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (c-IAP1) (complex
  I), triggering the upregulation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). A second complex (complex
  II) is later formed when complex I bind to Fas-associated protein with death domain
  (FADD), which is recruited upon activation of Fas (, ). Complex II subsequently
  causes downstream activation of apoptosis signal by activating caspase cascade,
  resulting in the cleavage of initiator caspase 8 and effector caspase 3 leading
  to apoptosis (, –). However, NF-κB upregulation may intersect apoptotic pathway
  as it can promote the induction of various cellular apoptosis inhibitors such as
  TRAF1, TRAF2, cIAP-1, c-IAP-2, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)
  (, ).'
