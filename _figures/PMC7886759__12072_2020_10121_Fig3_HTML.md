caption: Lipotoxic UPR induces hepatic cell death. Under lipotoxic condition, several
  factors are implicated in the occurrence of ER stress, including disrupted ER-to-Golgi
  protein trafficking, altered ER membrane composition and stiffness, impaired VLDL-TG
  assembly and the change of Ca2+ gradient by the decreased level of SERCA2 activity.
  PERK is activated and leads to the phosphorylation of eIF2α, subsequently causes
  the activation of downstream ATF3- and CHOP-related apoptotic signaling pathways.
  IRE1α could also be activated by toxic lipids, thus stimulates TRAF2/ASK1/JNK signaling
  pathway. On the other hand, spliced XBP1 mediates adaptive UPR, which aims to alleviate
  ER stress. Together with apoptotic UPR, the massive efflux of Ca2+ from ER could
  result in mitochondrial dysfunction and the initiation of apoptotic cell death.
