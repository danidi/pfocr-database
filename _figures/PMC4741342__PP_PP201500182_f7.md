caption: Models for biosynthetic pathways of PEN3 substrates and deduced allele-specific
  PEN3 transport activities in pen3 plants. A, PEN3 activities in the efflux of different
  Trp-derived metabolites upon attack by pathogenic fungi, including bioactive products
  of the CYP81F2/PEN2 pathway (4OH-X) against nonadapted powdery mildews and unknown
  metabolites (Y) for resistance against P. cucumerina. Dashed lines indicate putative
  steps and enzymatic components. DMT, O-demethyltransferase; 4OHI3G, 4-hydroxy-indol-3-ylmethyl
  glucosinolate; UGT, UDP-glucosyltransferase. B, Allele-specific uncoupling of a
  subset of PEN3 functions. Wild-type PEN3 transports -derived products (yellow triangles),  (green
  squares), and unknown substrates linked to  hyperaccumulation (blue circles). Differential
  hyperaccumulation of these compounds in the indicated genotypes is shown. *, Substitutions
  in mutant PEN3 variants.
