caption: FOXO activity, stability, and localization are regulated by the insulin/IGF
  signaling pathway and reactive oxygen species. Insulin/insulin-like growth factors
  activate transmembrane receptors and in turn activate the insulin receptor substrate
  (IRS) proteins. IRS proteins then stimulate downstream signaling events, resulting
  in the phosphorylation and activation of AKT. Activated AKT phosphorylates FOXO
  proteins on three sites and triggers their inactivation and nuclear exclusion. FOXO
  phosphorylation by AKT enhances binding to 14–3-3 proteins and either cytoplasmic
  sequestration and/or degradation by the proteasome. Phosphatase and tensin homolog
  (PTEN) promotes FOXO activation and nuclear localization by inhibiting the activation
  of PI3K. In contrast to inhibition by insulin/IGF signaling, reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) promote nuclear localization and activation of FOXO by activating the c-Jun
  N-terminal kinase (JNK). JNK directly phosphorylates FOXOs, thereby stimulating
  activation of transcriptional regulation. Once activated, FOXOs regulate several
  cellular processes that promote cellular homeostasis.
