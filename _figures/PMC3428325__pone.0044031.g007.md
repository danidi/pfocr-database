caption: The expression levels of unigenes involved in this pathway were confirmed
  by transcriptome analysis and quantitative PCR. Red boxes represent pathways containing
  unigenes that show up-regulated expression in mycelium, green boxes represent up-regulated
  expression in the fruiting body. Black boxes represent pathways having common expression
  levels between mycelium and fruiting body. Words in a grey shadow represent that
  no unigenes were identified in this process after G. lucidum transcriptome analysis.
