caption: 'Model of pathway induction after pathophysiologic stimulation of BSMC by
  three coordinate stimuli: strain, hypoxia, and damaged matrix. Bladder obstruction
  leads to strain injury of the bladder smooth muscle. Strain injury is associated
  with microvascular compression and consequent hypoxia as well as matrix metalloprotease
  activation and consequent alteration of the ECM. These three coordinate stimuli,
  hypoxia, strain (directly) and damaged matrix can lead to increased signaling through
  mTOR, inhibited by rapamycin, as well as parallel pathways ERK, JAK2/STAT3 and p38.
  EIF4E is strain-activated, but not in an mTOR dependent manner, suggesting that
  in BSMC strain activates EIF4E through other pathways (EGFR-dependent, p38-dependent),
  which prevent inhibition by rapamycin under strain 4EBP upstream of EIF E and downstream
  of mTOR is inhibited by in vivo obstruction in contrast to strain in vitro. (see
  Discussion). STAT3 phosphorylation is also induced by strain, but is also basally
  induced by rapamycin. Phosphorylation of S6K on the other hand is augmented by strain,
  hypoxia, and, as with S6, is inhibited by rapamycin. S6K appears to initiate the
  de-differentiating response. However, STAT3, ERK and S6K inhibition all prevent
  proliferation in response to obstruction-related stimuli in BSMC, suggesting a common
  intermediary in all three pathways.'
