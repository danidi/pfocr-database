caption: The working model of Grail in the regulation of p53-dependent functions.
  In normal conditions, the endogenous p53 abundance is too low to transcribe its
  target genes. DNA damage induces endogenous p53 expression sufficiently to transcribe
  its target genes, which include p21, PUMA, and Grail. In pathway I, increasing the
  Grail proteins are able to degrade stress-activated p53 proteins. In pathway II,
  the p53/Grail negative feedback loop is required for apoptosis induction. The downregulation
  of Grail gene expression and protein, via epigenetic modifications, fails to maintain
  the p53-dependent apoptosis. The stressed cells later enter the p21-dependent cell
  cycle G1 arrest, due to increased endogenous p53 proteins. Further silencing of
  the p21 gene results in the predominance of endogenous Grail proteins for the p53-dependent
  apoptosis. Therefore, Grail is a key protein for the regulation of p53 mediated
  functions in apoptosis and cell cycle G1 arrest
