caption: 'Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling pathways mediate responses
  to a variety of stimuli, including ROS. MAPK pathways consist of a series of kinases:
  MAPKKK, MAPKK and MAPK, which are sequentially activated by phosphorylation. Three
  groups of MAPK, p38, JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase), are preferentially activated by different MAPKK and MAPKKK. The activity
  of each kinase is also controlled by phosphatases. For example, to attenuate MAPK
  activity, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) dephosphorylate MAPK. Oligomerisation
  activates ASK1 by promoting autophosphorylation. Inactivation of phosphatases is
  an alternative mechanism to increase MAPK activity. For example, heat stress activation
  of the Sty1(Spc1) pathway in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe involves
  inactivation of the PTP Pyp1 (). Steps in pathways which have been shown to be regulated
  by peroxiredoxins (pink) and/or thioredoxin (Trx1) are also indicated.'
