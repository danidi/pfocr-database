caption: TNBS disease and treatment with resveratrol were performed as described in  legend.
  260 significantly altered miRs between TNBS+Res vs. TNBS+Veh noted in  legend were
  subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Depicted is an IPA-generated interaction
  chart showing significantly altered miRs targeting factors associated with anti-inflammatory
  T cell responses. Green colors represent downregulated miRs and Red colors represent
  upregulated miRs. The calculated fold changes between TNBS+Res and TNBS+Veh groups
  are depicted below each included miR. Purple arrows indicate predicted, highly predicted,
  and experimentally-proven interactions of the miR with target mRNA shown.
