caption: Schematic depicting the model of RyR1-dependent signaling pathways in  DC.
  KCl released from dead cells in the vicinity of DCs causes membrane  depolarization,
  which is sensed by the DHPR voltage sensor. Alternatively,  interaction of T cells
  with iDC, strong enough to activate an increase in the  [Ca2+]i via release from
  intracellular stores  and activation of Ca2+ influx, is accompanied by efflux of  K+
  to repolarize the T cell membrane potential. This K+  is released onto the iDCs
  and can be sensed by the DHPR. This leads to  activation of the RyR1 signaling pathway
  causing the rapid expression of MHC  class II molecules onto the surface of iDCs.
  The latter molecules could be  loaded with antigenic peptides and interact in situ
  with T cells to  initiate an early and rapid specific immune response. TCR, T cell  receptor;
  CRAC, Ca2+ release activated Ca2+  channel.
