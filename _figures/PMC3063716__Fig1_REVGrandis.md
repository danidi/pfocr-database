caption: In the canonical STAT3 signaling pathway, activation of cell surface growth
  factor and cytokine receptors induces specific tyrosine phosphorylation (small red
  circles) of receptor chains to create docking sites for the recruitment of latent
  cytoplasmic STAT3 (dark gray geometries), which contain SH-2 domains (shown as indentations)
  that recognize sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. After the recruitment of STAT3
  to activated receptors, STAT3 becomes activated by phosphorylation (at Y705; see
  text for details). Phosphorylation of STAT3 can be catalyzed by the intrinsic tyrosine
  kinase activity of the activated growth factor receptor (green elongated ovals)
  or by the Janus kinase (JAK) that associates with activated cytokine receptors (blue
  elongated ovals). Phosphorylated STAT3 homodimerizes, via reciprocal intermolecular
  interactions between SH-2 domains and phosphorylation sites, and dimers translocate
  into the nucleus. Passage of dimers through the nuclear pore complex (red rings)
  is facilitated through interactions with importin α5, importin α7, and importin
  β; nuclear import of nonphosphorylated STAT3 may also occur by importin α3 (not
  shown). In the nucleus, STAT3 dimers bind to promoter elements of responsive target
  genes to regulate their transcription. See  and  for specific activators and targets
  of STAT3 activity.
