caption: 'Schematic mechanisms of action for drugs involved in the three arms of the
  TORAVA trial. Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody, binds to
  human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and prevents the interaction of
  VEGF to its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells. Cancer cells tend to
  overexpress VEGF, which stimulates angiogenesis, facilitating cancer growth and
  metastasis. Bevacizumab suppresses angiogenesis by inhibition of molecular pathways
  of MAP and PI3K/AKT. Temsirolimus, an ester analogue of rapamycin, is an inhibitor
  of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) that binds to intracellular FKBP protein,
  and the protein–drug complex inhibit the activity of mTOR. mTOR is a crucial regulator
  of cell growth and proliferation through its ability to integrate signals from nutrients
  and growth factor stimuli. Inhibition of mTOR activity results in a G1 growth arrest
  in treated tumour cells. When mTOR is inhibited, its ability to phosphorylate p70S6
  kinase (p70S6k) and 4E binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), which are downstream of mTOR
  in the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway, is blocked. Interferon-α-2a, a sterile protein product
  for use by injection, binds to type I interferon receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c),
  which upon dimerisation activates two JAKs (Janus kinases): JAK1 and TYK2. These
  transphosphorylate themselves and phosphorylate the receptors. The phosphorylated
  INFAR receptor then binds to STAT1 and STAT2 (signal transducers and activators
  of transcription), which dimerise and activate multiple immunomodulatory and antiviral
  proteins. Sunitinib is an oral, smallmolecule, multi-targeted inhibitor of receptor
  tyrosine kinases (e.g., platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) and vascular
  endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)), some of which are implicated in tumour
  growth, pathologic angiogenesis, and metastatic progression of cancer. PI3K: Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate-3-kinase;
