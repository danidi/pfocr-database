caption: Metabolic engineering of the full pathway to N-formyldemecolcine (10) in
  N. benthamiana was compared to transient co-expression systems in which individual
  module 3 enzymes were removed. a) Accumulation of proposed pathway intermediates
  within dropout experiments. Gray boxes to the left of the graph indicate biosynthetic
  genes/modules included within a co-expression experiment, while white boxes indicate
  their absence. Shown for each intermediate is the mean extracted ion abundance (n=3,
  ± standard deviation) for the exact ion mass [M+H]+ (for 10, both [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+),
  as well as the retention time (r.t.) that corresponds to each compound. b) Dropout
  of GsOMT1 from the full engineered pathway leads to accumulation of a new compound
  with a mass equivalent to 2 (m/z 300.1594), as shown via LC-MS chromatograms. The
  newly identified peak is indicated via the arrow. EIC = extracted ions chromatogram.
  c) Transient co-expression of GsOMT1 or GsNMTt with module 1, module 2, and Δ24-CjNCS
  (for production of 1). Shown are the LC-MS chromatograms for the substrate (1, m/z
  286.1438), singly-methylated products (2a and 2b, m/z 300.1574) and doubly-methylated
  product (3, m/z 314.1751). d) MS/MS fragmentation spectrum of 2a/2 (collision energy
  of 20V), as well as a tabulated list and putative structures for the ion fragments.
  e) MS/MS fragmentation spectrum of 2b (collision energy of 20V), as well as a tabulated
  list and putative structures for the ion fragments. Note that fragment B (m/z 269)
  supports the placement of the methyl group on the nitrogen. For reference, compare
  to fragment B of 2a in panel “d”. f) Comparative consumption of 1 by GsOMT1 and
  GsNMTt. Gray boxes indicate the presence of a gene/module within the co-expression
  experiment, while a white box indicates its absence. n=3 for each reaction; statistical
  comparisons made using Dunnett’s test with comparison to the module 1/module 2/Δ24-CjNCS
  control. g) Proposed scheme for the initial methylations of 1. All experiments shown
  in this figure were performed once.
