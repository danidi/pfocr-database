caption: Integration of activated transcription factors with the upstream signaling
  network during CB1R-induced neurite outgrowth. (A) Pharmacological inhibition of
  transcription factor activation during CB1R stimulation. The Venn diagram (data
  from ) shows the inhibition of transcription factor activation by the PI3K inhibitor
  LY (blue), the MAPK pathway inhibitor PD (yellow), and the Src inhibitor PP2 (magenta).
  (B) Proposed decision logic for cell-state change during CB1R-stimulated neurite
  outgrowth. A set of three pOR gates connects the alpha subunits of Gi and Go (Gαi/o
  for clarity) and the Gβγ subunit to the kinases PI3K, Src, and MAPK. This study's
  results and the experimental literature () suggest that these gates are not true
  OR gates and are thus represented as pOR gates (see  for details). Stacked below
  are three AND gates that connect the kinases to the transcription factors. The components
  and connections are in black. The gray arrows and gate symbols are in gray to denote
  information flow and the abstract nature of the pOR and AND gates.
