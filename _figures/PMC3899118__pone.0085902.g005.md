caption: The figure represents an integrated network of multiple pathways interacting
  through common gene products. Specific sub-networks (gene associations within individual
  pathways) constituting the integrated network are highlighted in Supplementary  (A-R).
  The major sub-network pathways include regulation of actin cytoskeleton, calcium
  signaling, MAPK pathway, immune cell signaling, cell-cell communication, VEGF signaling
  amongst others. The network shown was extracted from the list of differentially
  expressed genes utilizing ‘Pathway Miner’. Relationships between the genes (nodes
  connected by edges) suggest co-occurrence in a biological pathway. Weight of a specific
  edge is a relative representation of the number of pathways in which the associating
  nodes (gene products) co-occur in the KEGG pathway resource. The nodes are labeled
  by gene names and colored based on the respective fold changes for specific genes
  in the original data set.
