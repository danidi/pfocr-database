caption: Figure 2. A schematic model for the fine-tuning of the flavonoid biosynthetic
  pathway. MYB11, MYB12, and MYB111 redundantly activate the expression of EBGs (A).
  TCP3 associates with these 3 R2R3-MYBs to stimulate the transcription of EBGs and
  thereby enhances flavonol production (B). The ternary R2R3-MYB/bHLH/WD40 (MBW) complex
  activates the expression of LBGs and thus controls the biosynthesis of anthocyanins
  and PAs (C). MYBL2 and SPL9 behave as negative fine-tuners of anthocyanin biosynthesis
  and disrupt the formation of the MBW complex via interacting competitively with
  bHLHs in the case of MYBL2 (D) or with R2R3-MYBs in the case of SPL9 (E). By contrast,
  TT1 acts as a positive fine-tuner of the PA biosynthesis in the endothelial cells
  of the testa (F) and TCP3 functions as a positive fine-tuner of both anthocyanin-
  and PA-specific MBW complexes (G). The 2 positive fine-tuners TT1 and TCP3 organize
  the formation of the MBW complex by synergistically associating with R2R3-MYBs.
  The counteracted or enhanced activity of the MBW complex reduces or heightens the
  biosynthesis of anthocyanins and PAs via influencing the expression of LBGs, respectively.
  Thin arrows indicate the transcription of LBGs and EBGs controlled by the ternary
  MBW complex and MYB11, MYB12, or MYB111, respectively. Hammers denote the inhibitory
  effects of MYBL2 or SPL9 on the transcription of LBGs. Thick arrows represent the
  heightened expression of EBGs or LBGs.
