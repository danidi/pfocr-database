caption: 'Aspirin and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in endometrial cancer. The activation
  of RTK induced by adipokines leads to activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in
  endometrial cancer. The direct association between ER and RTK also stimulates the
  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. The PIK3CA mutations activate the kinase activity of PI3K,
  which is antagonized by PTEN through its phosphatase function. Up-regulation of
  PI3K enhances COX-2 activity and PGE2synthesis in the setting of obesity. Thus,
  suppression of PGE2 production as would theoretically be achieved with use of aspirin,
  could be a promising strategy for the treatment of endometrial cancer. Dashed lines
  represent the suggested pathways in endometrial cancer. Abbreviations: RTK, receptor
  tyrosine kinase; PG, prostaglandin; COX, cyclooxygenase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase; PIK3CA, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit
  alpha; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate;
  mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; IL-6, interleukin-6;
  ER, estrogen receptor; and PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog.'
