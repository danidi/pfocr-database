caption: Schematic diagram of Treg cell development. tTreg cells develop in the thymus
  by two-step process. First, high-affinity tissue-restricted self-antigens presented
  by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) or bone-marrow derived antigen-presenting
  cells (BM-APCs) derive single-positive (SP) T cells into Treg pathway. Second, cytokine
  IL-2 or IL-15 derives the precursor cells into fully committed tTreg cells. pTreg
  cells develop in the periphery by environmental antigens such as microbial antigens
  or food antigens presented by mucosal tissue-resident dendritic cells (DCs). TGF-β,
  retinoic acids (RAs) and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced in the immunosuppressive
  environments promote pTreg development.
