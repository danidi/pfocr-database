caption: 'The core of the Hippo pathway. The core components of the Hippo pathway
  comprise a regulatory serine–threonine kinase module and a transcriptional module.
  In mammals, this kinase module comprises two groups of kinases: mammalian STE20-like
  protein kinase 1 (MST1) (also known as STK4) and MST2 (also known as STK3) and large
  tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) and LATS2 in combination with their activating adaptor
  proteins Salvador family WW domain-containing protein 1 (SAV1) and MOB kinase activator
  1A/B (MOB1A/B), respectively. MAP4K4 has recently been identified as an alternative
  activator of LATS independent of MST. The transcriptional module comprises the transcriptional
  coactivators Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with a
  PDZ-binding domain (TAZ) and several transcription factors, of which the most prominently
  studied are TEA domain family members 1–4 (TEAD1–4). In a classical view, when the
  upstream kinase module is activated, MST1/2 phosphorylates SAV1, MOB1A/B, and LATS1/2
  to activate the LATS1/2 kinases, which in turn directly phosphorylate YAP and TAZ
  on multiple serine residues leading to cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TAZ via a 14-3-3
  interaction. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ by LATS1/2 primes YAP/TAZ
  for proteasomal degradation. The requirement for MST1/2 to phosphorylate LATS1/2
  is cell-type dependent, suggesting the existence of additional kinases (drawn as
  a question mark) that regulate the activating phosphorylation of LATS1/2. By contrast,
  when the kinase module is inactivated, hypophosphorylated YAP/TAZ translocate into
  the nucleus and induce target gene expression.'
