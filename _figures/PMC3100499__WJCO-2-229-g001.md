caption: Schema of the metabolic pathway of glucose and 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose in
  cells. fluorodeoxyglucose has the same pathway as glucose up to the phosphorylation
  process, and does not progress further. Most malignant cells are known to have overexpression
  of the glucose transporter (*) and low activity of phosphatase(**).
