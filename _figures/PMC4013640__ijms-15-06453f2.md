caption: 'Pericyte physical and biochemical interactions at the NVU. Pericytes are
  embedded within the basal lamina structure and project elongated processes that
  wrap endothelial cells, thus establishing specialized cell-cell contacts. These
  contacts are mainly from peg-socket types, where cell-cell contacts are established
  when pericyte cell membrane protrusion-like structures (pegs) are inserted into
  endothelial cell membrane invaginations (pockets) cells (outlined by dashed circles).
  The peg-socket contacts contain cell-to-cell junction proteins, such as N-cadherin
  and CX43 hemichannels. CX43 hemichannels form gap junctions that allow the biochemical
  exchange between pericytes and endothelial cells. In parallel, several autocrine
  and paracrine signaling pathways govern the interaction between pericytes and endothelial
  cells, such as the PDGFBB/PDGFRβ signaling pathway (paracrine pathway: PDGFBB secreted
  by endothelial cells binds to PDGFRβ expressed on pericytes), the TGFβ signaling
  pathway (paracrine and autocrine pathway: TGFβ secreted by endothelial cells and
  pericytes binds to TGFβR2 expressed on both cell types), the Ang1/Tie2 signaling
  pathway (paracrine pathway: Ang1 is secreted by pericytes binds to Tie2 expressed
  on endothelial cells), and the Notch signaling pathway (cleavage-induced signaling
  pathway: the sequential proteolytic cleavage and release in the intracellular space
  of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) that translocates to the nucleus and controls
  downstream gene expression).'
