caption: Proposed model of how USP2a-driven microRNA deregulation enhances MYC protein
  expression through impairment of the MDM2–p53 pathway. p53 regulates miR-34b/c expression
  through promoter enhancement. A, when overexpressed, USP2a transcriptionally downregulates
  miR-34b/c with subsequent MYC activation through MDM2-mediated p53 inactivation.
  B, low USP2a expression triggers the upregulation of miR-34b/c with subsequent MYC
  deactivation through MDM2-mediated p53 activation.
