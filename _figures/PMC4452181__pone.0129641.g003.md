caption: This pathway was found to be a significant regulator of sAPPβ. Proteins/genes
  are coloured based on their corresponding Z* values for sAPPα (A), and sAPPβ (B).
  Genes do not behave equally across the different readouts. For example, knock-down
  of NKX2-2 (black circle), which is a homeobox transcription factor, results in a
  significant decrease of sAPPβ (Z* = –12.3) but increases sAPPα (Z* = 2.4). Hence,
  the mechanism by which this pathway would favour the production of sAPPβ over sAPPα
  could potentially be mediated by this transcription factor. C. “Maturity onset diabetes
  of the young (MODY) (KEGG)” and "Alzheimer's disease" pathways (KEGG database).
  The network illustrates how proteins from these two pathways interact with/regulate
  each other. D. Two potential mechanisms by which sAPPβ levels can be lowered. One
  hypothetical mechanism could be via NKX2-2 regulation of APP processing via an insulin-mediated
  pathway. Knock-down of NKX2-2 would result in increased insulin levels leading to
  inhibition of caspase 3 activation and hence decreased cleavage of APP by caspase
  3 at the BACE1 cleavage site[69–71]. Increased insulin levels have been associated
  with decreases of intracellular accumulation of Aβ levels, and caspase 3 has been
  shown to regulate APP processing via BACE1-related mechanisms [71–73]. Knock-down
  of caspase 3 in this study reduces sAPPβ levels. Although the insulin gene was not
  included in the screen, the knock-downs of NKX-2 and caspase 3 are consistent with
  known biology (i.e. reduction in levels of sAPPβ). An alternative hypothesis could
  be via HNF4A, a transcription factor previously characterized as binding to the
  BACE promoter [74]. Genes/proteins in the network are coloured by their corresponding
  sAPPβ Z* values.
