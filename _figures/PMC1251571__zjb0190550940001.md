caption: Schematic representation of the connection between d-lactate production and
  peptidoglycan biosynthesis in the L. plantarum double ldhD lar mutant (PG6212).
  When both d-lactate production pathways (LdhD and Lar) are disrupted (|), production
  of the d-alanyl-d-lactate depsipeptide is blocked and peptidoglycan synthesis cannot
  occur (×). The ldhD lar mutant can be rescued in the presence of d-lactate or other
  d-2-hydroxy acids. Alternatively, d-alanine can replace d-lactate by heterologous
  expression of the d-alanyl-d-alanine ligase from L. lactis. Enzymatic reactions
  potentially involved in the incorporation of d-alanine in the peptidoglycan precursors
  of the ldhD lar suppressor mutants are depicted by dashed arrows. Regulation of
  the Lar activity by d- and l-lactate is indicated by curved arrows. The UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanyl-γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate
  moiety of the peptidoglycan precursor is shown as a circle. LdhL, NAD-dependent
  l-lactate dehydrogenase; LdhD, NAD-dependent d-lactate dehydrogenase; Lar, lactate
  racemase; LpDdl, L. plantarum Ddl ligase; LcDdl, L. lactis Ddl ligase; MurF, UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-tripeptide-d-alanyl-d-lactate
  ligase; PG, peptidoglycan; VanR, resistant to high concentrations of vancomycin;
  VanS, resistant to low concentrations of vancomycin.
