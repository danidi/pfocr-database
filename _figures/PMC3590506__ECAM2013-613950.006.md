caption: Schematic model of gallic acid-induced apoptosis pathway in primary cultured
  murine lung fibroblasts. Incubation of fibroblasts with gallic acid activated ROS-mediated
  DNA damage signaling pathway by triggering both JNK and ATM-dependent activation
  of p53. The transcriptional activation of p53 upregulated the proapoptotic molecules,
  such as PUMA and Fas, consequently leading to apoptotic cell death.
