caption: This study has elucidated that a tight coupling interplay underlies CII-induced
  apoptotic remodeling. Firstly, ionizing radiation stimuli triggers activation of
  the apoptotic signaling pathway (Bcl-2 family proteins). Secondly, in the committed
  and effector phase, the molecular executioner caspase-3 becomes completely activated,
  committing the cells to evoke apoptotic changes. This phase is also accompanied
  by alterations in cellular mechanical properties, and the mechanical signals participate
  with the signals of specific cellular events to generate positive coupling feedback
  to modulate the apoptotic response process. The budding process of ABs is a remarkable
  example of this control by mechanical factors. Thirdly, a tight coupling interplay
  mechanism directs the cell toward survival or demise (Fig. 6). In the final stages,
  the ABs are rapidly phagocytosed by macrophages and parenchymal cells and degraded.
  Apoptosis completes the cycle.
