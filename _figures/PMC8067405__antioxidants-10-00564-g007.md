caption: Potential mechanism of chrysin in hyperuricemic rats. The intervention of
  chrysin can effectively inhibit xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the liver, thereby
  reducing the production of uric acid. Chrysin also reduces the reabsorption of uric
  acid by regulating uric acid-related transporters and promotes the excretion of
  uric acid in the urine, thus improving hyperuricemia. Finally, chrysin can reduce
  the IL-1β concentration by the reduction of oxidative stress and the inactivation
  of inflammasome.
