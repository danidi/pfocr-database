caption: Elevation of interleukin 6 (IL6) during inflammation stimulates hepcidin
  transcription through binding to the IL6-receptor (IL6R)-gp130 complex, which stimulates
  signaling through the phosphorylation of JAK leading to the phosphorylation of STAT3.
  The phosphorylated STAT3 dimer binds to two identified BMP responsive elements in
  the promoter region of hepcidin stimulating transcription. Elevation of iron levels
  in the body leads to the upregulation of BMP6 and Tf-saturation. BMP6 signals through
  binding to hemojuvelin (HJV), BMP receptors and neogenin (Neo) and signals through
  the SMAD4/SMAD1/5/8 pathway to stimulate hepcidin expression. Two BMP responsive
  elements in the promoter region of hepcidin have been identified. Less is known
  about the Tf-TfR2-HFE signaling pathway (see text). Mutations in HFE result in a
  blunted pSMAD response. The p38 MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway is proposed to mediate
  this response.
