caption: Proposed Biosynthetic Pathway of the Allelochemical Sorgoleone.Dihydrosorgoleone,
  the hydroquinone produced in vivo, is thought to undergo autooxidation once secreted
  into the rhizosphere to yield sorgoleone, a more stable benzoquinone. The involvement
  of one or more cytochrome P450s in the formation of dihydrosorgoleone from 5-pentadecatrienyl
  resorcinol-3-methyl ether is at present speculative, as indicated by a question
  mark. DES, fatty acid desaturase; OMT, O-methyltransferase; P450, cytochrome P450.
