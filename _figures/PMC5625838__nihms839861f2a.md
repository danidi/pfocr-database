caption: Innate immune activation by HCV RNA. A) RIG-I binds to PAMPs in HCV RNA and
  changes its conformation, activating one or more E3 ubiquitin ligases (yellow shapes).
  Ubiquitinated RIG-I may activate MAVS, which then forms prion-like aggregates that
  recruit additional ubiquitin ligases. Recent evidence suggests that MAVS on peroxisomes
  is particularly important for induction of IFNλ. Subsequent ubiquitination steps
  stimulate recruitment of enzymes that activate the downstream IRF3 and NFκB pathways.
  HCV’s NS3/4A protease can disable this pathway by cleaving MAVS near its transmembrane
  domain. B) TLR3 recognizes dsRNA within endosomal compartments, signaling via the
  adaptor, TRIF. TRIF stimulates ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, resulting in recruitment
  of enzymes that activate the IRF3 and NFκB transcription factors. HCV’s NS3-4A protease
  can disable TLR3 signaling by cleaving TRIF.
