caption: 'I. Phase I (initiation): mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)-dependent
  and mTOR-independent pathways can induce autophagy. mTOR works via Ulk1 and 2 (mammalian
  Atg1 orthologs) that in turn directs (most likely on the ER) appropriate protein
  and lipid transactions to allow formation of a nascent pre-phagophore () possibly
  corresponding to the well defined structure in yeast termed pre-autophagosomal structure
  (or phagophore assembly site; PAS). The pre-phagophore in mammalian cells may emerge
  from an ER structure termed omegasome (Ω). Contributions of the secretory pathway
  [ER-Golgi-trans Golgi network (ER-G-TGN)], plasma membrane (PM)-derived organelles
  and mitochondria (MT) have also been reported: PM, acts possibly as additional source
  of lipid bilayers or a source of regulatory effects within the endosomal system
  with which autophagosomes merge during maturation; MT may contribute as a major
  source of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) where phosphatydilserine (PS) decarboxylase
  is located on the MT inner membrane to generate PE from PS for conjugation of LC3
  (LC3-II) and as a source of regulatory reactive oxygen intermediates that may promote
  autophagosome formation; ER-G-TGN contributions are probably complex and affecting
  the process directly and indirectly at multiple stages. Another major system regulating
  autophagy is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase hVPS34, which generates phosphatidylinositol
  3-phopshate (PI3P). DFCP is a protein with two FYVE (PI3P-binding) domains and serves
  as a marker for the merger of the hVPS34/PI3P systems and TOR/Ulk at the point of
  autophagy initiation at the ER. hVPS34 is in a complex (often referred to as complex
  I) with multiple proteins, with Beclin 1 being key for autophagy altogether, and
  mAtg14 being key specifically for autophagy initiation. WIPI1 and 2 (mammalian Atg18)
  bind to PI3P and likely facilitate anteretrograde (and retrograde for recycling)
  membrane and protein flow to the nascent phagosomes. PI3P phosphatases, such as
  Jumpy/MTMR14, modulate progression of autophagy by tempering PI3P-dependent processes.
  II. Phase II (elongation and closure): Autophagic membrane is elongated to from
  a structure known as sensu stricto phagophore (or isolation membrane) based on two
  conjugation systems: (a) Atg5-Atg12 in complex with Atg16L, which acts as an E3
  enzyme (nomenclature borrowed form the ubiquitination system) topologically restricting
  and enzymatically facilitating (b) conversion of LC3 to LC3-II (lipidated at the
  C-terminus by PE). Atg16 is a Crohn''s disease risk locus in human populations and
  has also been found in complexes with clathrin at the plasma membrane (not shown).
  Elongating phagophore, also known as isolation membrane () wraps around its targets
  and eventually closes to form a sealed double membrane organelle known as sensu
  stricto autophagosome (). III. Phase III (maturation). Autophagosomes fuse with
  late endosomal and lysosomal organelles or intermediates in a process dependent
  on hVPS34 (in complex with Beclin 1 and UVRAG; referred to as complex II). This
  process is also subject to inhibition/modulation by PI3P phosphatases such as Jumpy/MTMR14.
  The fusion with lysosomal organelles heralds the dissolution of the inner membrane
  and formation of autolysosomes, where the degradation of the captured material occurs.'
