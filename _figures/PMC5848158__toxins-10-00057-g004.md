caption: 'Proposed model for total ROS management in A. parasiticus. Based on our
  current findings and previous reports we propose that aflatoxin-dependent protection
  occurs in one or a combination of the following ways: (a) utilization of ROS in
  the biochemical steps of the biosynthesis pathway [], (b) aflatoxin-dependent reduction
  of ROS in cells at exponential growth phase (current study) and (c) aflR-dependent
  reduction of ROS (current study) possibly through its gene regulatory impacts outside
  the aflatoxin pathway gene cluster [,]. Aflatoxin-dependent biochemical processes
  that sequester ROS still remain uncharacterized (green dashed arrow). Pink arrows
  indicate the sources of ROS accumulation. These include ROS generation from primary
  metabolic processes, secondary ROS generated from aflatoxin biosynthesis [], and
  ROS generated upon aflatoxin uptake by cells during stationary phase of growth (based
  on aflatoxin supplementation data from 48 h AFS10 cultures in the current study).
  The mechanisms that result in ROS accumulation upon cellular uptake of aflatoxin
  remains uncharacterized (pink dashed arrow). The model can now explain the physiological
  need of the cells to co-regulate secondary metabolism (in this case, aflatoxin biosynthesis)
  and oxidative stress response through the bZIP proteins [,,,,,,,,]. Red arrows indicate
  the contributions of the current study. The molecular mechanism of aflR-mediated
  regulation of SOD genes remains uncharacterized (red dashed arrow) and will be investigated
  in our follow up studies.'
