caption: 'Lipid metabolism of cancer. Reprogrammed cancer cells not only acquire lipid
  species by uptake of exogenous lipids through diffusion and transmembrane channel
  CD36 but also endogenously synthesize fatty acids. The precursor mass of de novo
  synthesized fatty acids is initiated by pyruvate of glycolysis metabolites and NADPH
  of the pentose phosphate pathway. Following several key enzymes involved in lipogenesis,
  acetyl-CoA is aggregated as 16-carbon saturated palmitate. By the desaturation of
  SCD-1, the saturated fatty acid is converted into monounsaturated fatty acid, but
  polyunsaturated lipids are mostly acquired by exogenous supplements. These lipids
  function as lipid mediators in cellular signaling transduction, build cellular membrane
  blocks, modify substrates by lipid modification, and are directly utilized to generate
  ATP molecules by β-oxidation. Excess lipids are also stored in lipid droplets. FASN:
