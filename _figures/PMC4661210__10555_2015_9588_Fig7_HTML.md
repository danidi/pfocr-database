caption: JNK1 exerts kinase activity on several transcription factors and BCL2 family
  proteins through phosphorylation (P) or ubiquitination (U). Proliferation and inflammation
  are induced by phosphorylating members of the JUN and ATF2 protein family, as well
  as ELK-1. The NRF2 antioxidant response is triggered via phosphorylation of NRF2
  at Ser40. Apoptosis is stimulated via the phosphorylation of BAX, BAK, BIM, BID,
  and BMF proteins as well as via p53 activation. Antiapoptotic proteins are also
  phosphorylated (and inactivated) by JNK1, which include BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL-1,
  or ubiquitinated (c-FLIP). The kinase functions of p38α/β entail a similar effect
  on the NRF2 antioxidant response pathway as reported for JNK1. Inflammation is stimulated
  via phosphorylation of the AP-1 transcription factors of the FOS and C/EBP protein
  family. Proliferation and survival are promoted via activation of JUN and ATF2.
  Translation of newly transcribed genes is facilitated by phosphorylation of MSK1,
  MNK1, and MNK2. Differentiation is mediated via MEF2 activation by p38α/β. Additionally,
  p38α/β regulate the cell cycle by phosphorylation of MK2 and MK5
