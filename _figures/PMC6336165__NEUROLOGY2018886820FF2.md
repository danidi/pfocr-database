caption: Endoglin, mutated in HHT1, is a coreceptor of ALK1 for BMP9/10 ligands, whose
  signaling inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and mural cell recruitment. This
  pathway confers a stalk cell endothelial phenotype. VEGFA signaling is proangiogenic,
  through the PI3K/AKT pathway, and confers a tip cell endothelial phenotype. The
  tumor suppressor PTEN is a mediary between these 2 pathways. To control angiogenic
  sprouting, adjacent arterial endothelial cells use cell contact Notch signaling
  to regulate tip and stalk cell phenotypes. The decoy receptor Vegfr1 is also employed
  since it competitively binds with VEGFA to lower the relative exposure of Vegfr2
  to surrounding VEGFA.
