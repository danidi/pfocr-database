caption: Terms in italics reference the labels in the figure. Metabolism of proteins,
  as annotated here, covers the full life cycle of a protein from its synthesis to
  its posttranslational modification and degradation. Protein synthesis is accomplished
  through Translation of an mRNA sequence into a polypeptide chain. Protein folding
  is achieved through the function of molecular chaperones that recognize and associate
  with proteins in their non-native state; as well as facilitate their folding by
  stabilizing the conformation of productive folding intermediates. Following translation,
  many newly formed proteins undergo Post-translational modification, essentially
  irreversible covalent modifications critical for their mature locations and functions,
  including Ubiquitination, Methionine oxidation, Carboxyterminal post-translational
  modifications, Neddylation, and Phosphorylation. Most mitochondrial proteins are
  encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytosol and then by the process of Mitochondrial
  protein import sorted and targeted to four locations, outer membrane, intermembrane
  space, inner membrane, and matrix–. Peptide hormones are synthesized as parts of
  larger precursor proteins whose cleavage in the secretory system (endoplasmic reticulum,
  Golgi apparatus, secretory granules) is annotated in Peptide hormone metabolism.
  After secretion, peptide hormones are modified and degraded by extracellular proteases.
  Two responses to protein damage are annotated in Reactome. The Unfolded Protein
  Response (UPR) is a regulatory system that protects the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)
  from overload. First, the UPR is provoked by the accumulation of improperly folded
  protein in the ER during times of unusually high secretory activity. Second, Protein
  repair enables the reversal of damage to some amino acid side chains caused by reactive
  oxygen species. Pulmonary surfactants are lipids and proteins that are secreted
  by the alveolar cells of the lung that decrease surface tension at the air/liquid
  interface within the alveoli to maintain the stability of pulmonary tissue. Nuclear
  regulation, transport, metabolism, reutilization, and degradation of surfactant
  are described in the Surfactant metabolism pathway. Amyloid fiber formation, the
  accumulation of mostly extracellular deposits of fibrillar proteins, is associated
  with tissue damage observed in numerous diseases including late phase heart failure
  (cardiomyopathy) and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
  and Huntington's. The figure has been copied under CC-BY with permission from Reactome,
