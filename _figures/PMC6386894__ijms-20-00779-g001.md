caption: Energy metabolism and lactate shuttling between astrocytes and neurons. Astrocytic
  cAMP increases glucose uptake and glycogenolysis, triggering glycolysis and energy
  production. ATP produced from glycolysis is essential for K+ uptake by Na-K-Cl cotransporter
  1 (NKCC1) and Na+/K+ ATPase. In the meantime, pyruvate in astrocytes is converted
  into lactate and shuttled to neurons via monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). Lactate
  is converted into pyruvate for energy production in neurons and deactivates the
  KATP channel, resulting in an increase in neuronal excitability. The co-product
  NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) has been shown to be important
  for N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) activation, which is important for
  synaptic plasticity. In addition, extracellular lactate can activate G-protein-coupled
  receptor 81 (GPR81) and unknown targets to either up- or down-regulate cAMP levels
  in neurons and astrocytes. Grey arrows and texts indicate that the processes shown
  are less active. Arrows indicate transference or conversion of molecules, or activating
  pathways. T-bars indicate inhibiting pathways.
