caption: Updated model for the translation of FSS to stimulated endocytosis. Our data
  support a model in which exposure to FSS increases apical endocytic capacity in
  PT cells via a pathway that requires mechanosensation by the primary cilium. Our
  previous studies demonstrated that this response requires extracellular Ca2+ and
  is mediated by release of ATP and purinergic receptor (P2R) signaling that leads
  to release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. Here we show that FSS‐stimulated
  endocytosis requires calmodulin (CaM) mediated activation of Cdc42. We hypothesize
  that Cdc42 modulates cytoskeletal dynamics that lead to increased endocytic capacity.
