caption: 'Synthesis and function of maresins (MaRs) and macrophages. (A) MaRs and
  MaR conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTRs) biosynthesis. Human macrophage 12-LOX
  converts DHA to the 13S,14S-epoxy-maresin intermediate and hydrolase or soluble
  epoxide hydrolase is converted to MaR1 and MaR2, respectively. The MCTR biosynthetic
  pathway is initiated by lipoxygenation of 14S-HpDHA, converted by lipoxygenase activity
  to the 13S,14S-epoxy-maresin intermediate. MCTR1 is catalyzed by glutathione s-transferase
  mu4 (GSTM4) and/or leukotriene C4 synthase (LTC4S). MCTR1 is converted by gamma-glutamyl
  transferase (GGT) to MCTR2, which then acts as a substrate for conversion by dipeptidase
  (DPEP) to MCTR3. (B) M1 and M2 polarization of macrophages. Bone marrow-derived
  macrophages differentiate into mononuclear cells and gradually become mature macrophages
  that can be released into circulation. IFN-γ, TNF-α, and LPS stimulate macrophages
  into M1, IL-4 and IL-13 into M2a, IC and TLR into M2b, and IL-10 into M2c; A2AR
  agonist stimulates them into M2d. M1 macrophages induce a proinflammatory response,
  whereas M2 macrophages induce an anti-inflammatory response. M1 macrophages can
  also differentiate into M2 macrophages through local cues. The M1 phenotype is proinflammatory,
  phagocytic, and bactericidal, while the M2 macrophages act to switch off inflammation.
  IFN-γ: interferon gamma; TNF-α: tumor necrosis factor alpha; LPS: lipopolysaccharides;
  IC: immune complexes; TLR: toll-like receptor; A2AR: adenosine A2A receptor; IL:
  interleukin; IL-1R: IL-1 receptor.'
