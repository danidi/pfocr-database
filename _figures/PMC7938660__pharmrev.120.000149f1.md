caption: Metabolic formation of hydroxynorketamines from ketamine. (R,S)-ketamine
  (KET) is N-demethylated to form (R,S)-norketamine (norKET), which is then further
  metabolized to form the HNKs and dehydronorketamine (DHNK). Via this pathway, (R,S)-norKET
  is hydroxylated to form the HNKs as shown [see ; ]. Ketamine additionally undergoes
  direct hydroxylation to form the 6-hydroxyketamines (HKs), which are then N-demethylated
  to form the (2,6)-HNKs (; ).
