caption: The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade regulating autophagy. Upon activation
  of PI3K, Akt is phosphorylated, which promotes the activation of mTORC1. Activated
  mTORC1 inhibits autophagy by associating with the ULK1-Atg13-FIP200 complex, thus
  inhibiting autophagosome formation. Inhibition of mTOR and the subsequent increase
  in autophagic activity may restore homeostasis in articular cartilage chondrocytes.
  Further, by simultaneously targeting the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway, a dual inhibition
  of PI3K and mTOR may be a potential approach to limit cartilage degeneration. Alternatively,
  upregulation of ULK1 may also impart chondroprotection by enhancement of autophagic
  activity. Red lines signify potential points of therapeutic intervention. Akt protein
  kinase B, mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin, NF nuclear factor, PI3K phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase
