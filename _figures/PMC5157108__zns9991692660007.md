caption: Schematic of signaling events involved in Tat-induced changes in NMDARs.
  Schematic shows the hypothesized changes in NMDAR function during exposure to HIV-1
  Tat. At baseline (A), NMDAR-mediated Ca2+signaling and synaptic number are at homeostasis.
  After exposure to Tat (B), Tat is internalized via the LRP receptor and induces
  potentiation of Ca2+-influx through NMDARs via a Src-dependent phosphorylation of
  both GluN2A and GluN2B-containing NMDARs. Prolonged potentiation (C) of GluN2A-containing
  NMDARs leads to an adapted state via an Akt-Mdm2 signaling pathway that is dependent
  on protein translation. The adapted state (D) contains fewer synapses and Ca2+ influx
  has adapted in remaining spines.
