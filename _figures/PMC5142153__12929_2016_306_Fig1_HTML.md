caption: A summary of extrinsic, intrinsic and membrane stress apoptotic pathways.
  a DNA damages lead to activation of p53 that promotes the expression of pro-apoptotic
  proteins such as BAX and consequently permeabilization of the outer membrane of
  mitochondria and release of cytochrome C followed by formation of a large multieric
  complex namely Apoptosom through participation of cytochrome C, dATP and apoptotic
  protease-activating factor-1 (APAF-1). b Activation of p53 by ionizing radiation
  leads to downstream transactivation of death receptor and death ligand that trigger
  extrinsic apoptotic pathway followed by complex formation between death receptor
  and its cognate ligand. Complex formation results in receptor trimerization and
  consequently formation of death inducing signal complex (DISC) by participation
  of FADD (Fas-associated death domain) mediated by DD (death domain). c Apoptosis
  might be prompted by production of ceramide as a second messanger which is activated
  by double strand breaks (DSBs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and as a result
  activation of sphingomyelinase followed by hydrolysis of sphyngomyelin and release
  of ceramide. The outcome of apoptosis is caspase activation which results in cell
  death due to production of apoptosome, death inducing signaling complex (DISC) and
  ceramide in intrinsic, extrinsic and memberane stress apoptotic pathways, respectively
