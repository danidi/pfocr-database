caption: A model of how CWIN-mediated sugar signalling may regulate fruit set. See
  Discussion for more details. Arrows indicate genes involved in the specified process
  that were up-regulated (red) or down-regulated (green) by elevated CWIN activity.
  Solid line indicates known pathway; dashed line indicates predicted pathways.
