caption: Summary of regulatory relationships among genes controlling protein phospho-modulation
  at egg activation. The relationships between gene activities and protein phosphorylation
  observed in our study are summarized; dashed arrows represent genetic interactions
  but do not necessarily imply a direct effect. The arrow between prage and cortex
  is fainter to indicate less certainty about their interaction, although data in
  this article suggest such an interaction. Our results show that sarah (a calcineurin
  regulator) and calcineurin act in a single pathway with cortex; prage acts downstream
  or in a parallel pathway. The subsets of proteins whose phosphorylation state is
  regulated by each of these genes/pathways are indicated in boxes.
