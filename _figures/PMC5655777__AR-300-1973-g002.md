caption: 'This schematic diagram depicts the signaling pathways that possibly drive
  BAVM pathology. In brief, TGF‐β or BMP binds to TGFβR‐II and BMPR‐II, respectively.
  Activated TGFβR‐II and BMPR‐II phosphorylate their respective type I receptor proteins.
  TGFβR‐II activates ALK‐1 and ALK‐4/5 whereas BMPR‐II activates ALK‐1 and ALK‐3/6.
  ALK‐1 will activate SMADs 2 and 3 as well as SMADs 1, 5, and 8 in their respective
  signaling pathways. Both SMAD complexes further associate with SMAD4, translocate
  to the nucleus and activate gene transcription contributing to BAVMs pathology.
  ENG is a coreceptor regulator of TGFßR‐II and BMPR‐II and attenuates the activity
  of both signaling pathways. Mutated ENG will result in constitutive activity of
  the TGF‐β signaling pathway downstream. *Indicates mutated proteins identified in
  hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Intracranial hemorrhage can be better understood
  by characterizing key molecular mechanisms responsible for the onset of BAVMs. No
  single genetic abnormality accounts for a large number of cases of the disease.
  Instead, many genes hit across different patients, each with a relatively small
  effect on ICH risk. Abbreviations: TGF‐β—transforming growth factor‐β; BMP—bone
  morphogenic protein; TGFβR‐II—transforming growth factor‐β receptor type II; BMPR‐II—bone
  morphogenic protein receptor type II; ALK—activin‐like kinase; SMAD—small body size/mothers
  against decapentaplegic.'
