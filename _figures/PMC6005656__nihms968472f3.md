caption: The thioester catabolites of cholesterol degradation are utilized in various
  metabolic pathways. Propionyl-CoA is consumed by the methylcitrate cycle and methylmalonyl-CoA
  pathway. Acetyl-CoA is a substrate for the TCA cycle and the glyoxylate cycle. Pyruvate
  is transformed into acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is converted to succinate. Various
  proteins in this metabolic network have been identified as carrying marks for acetylation
  and succinylation.
