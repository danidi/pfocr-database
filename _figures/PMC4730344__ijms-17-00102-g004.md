caption: Induction of DNA repair by EGFR signaling. Irradiation (symbolized by the
  sinuous arrows and the trefoil) results in ligand-independent dimerization of EGFR
  and autophosphorylation at the cytoplasmic domains, resulting, on the one hand,
  in activation of the classical RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway, which causes the expression
  of XRCC1 (X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1) and, thereby, the activation
  of the nucleotide excision repair. On the other hand, EGFR is internalized in complex
  with CAV1 and then released into the nucleus, where it functions as a transcription
  factor for genes required during G1/S progression and activates PRKDC (DNA-PKcs),
  which plays a pivotal role during NHEJ. AKT1 was also shown as an activator of PRKDC.
  During the G1 phase, Ku and 53BP1 bind to the DSB (double strand break as symbolized
  by a gab in the DNA) band activate ATM, which possesses a PI3K domain enabling phosphorylation
  and activation of AKT1. During the S and G2 phase, the MRN complex and BRCA1 inhibit
  Ku and 53BP1 and induce DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). Arrows symbolize
  activation or translocation to the nucleus (described in the text); bar-headed lines
  symbolize inhibition. Targets for radiosensitization are in red. See text for details.
