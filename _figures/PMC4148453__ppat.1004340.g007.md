caption: 'The lines show the interaction between the players: arrow, activation; hammerheads,
  repression; solid line, a direct influence or direct connection; dotted line, a
  putative or indirect connection. The question mark (“?”) denotes a yet-unidentified
  factor (factors) required for triggering the kinase or phosphatase activity of BfmS.
  QteE reduces LasR protein stability . QteE also blocks RhlR accumulation, and this
  effect is independent of QteE''s action on LasR . Inactivation of RpoS causes elevated
  levels of rhlI (but not rhlR) transcription . See text for details. OM, outer membrane.
  IM, inner membrane. AcP, acetyl phosphate.'
