caption: In CHF (A), fibrocystin (FPC)-defective cholangiocytes gain an immature (fetal-like)
  phenotype characterized by an over-activation of the β-catenin signaling. This enables
  cholangiocytes to secrete a range of pro-inflammatory chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL10,
  and CXCL12) and to express integrin αVβ6, the local activator of latent TGFβ, a
  major driver of liver fibrogenesis. In particular, secretion of CXCL10 is sustained
  by an autocrine/paracrine loop where the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome stimulates
  the secretion of IL-1β via the JAK/STAT3 pathway (pale green cholangiocyte) that,
  in turn, enhances the production of CXCL10. (A,B) The exuberant chemokine secretion
  by cholangiocytes orchestrates the peribiliary accumulation of macrophages, which
  are initially molded into the M1 phenotype (yellow) prevailing on the M2 (blue).
  (C) At a later stage, increase in M2 macrophages associates with the recruitment
  of myofibroblasts (brown), which result in the progressive accumulation of peribiliary
  fibrotic tissue and in the progression of the disease.
