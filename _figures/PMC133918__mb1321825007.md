caption: Dual roles of Cripto. A schematic model for the interaction of Cripto with
  Nodal, ActRIB, and ActRIIB is shown. The wavy line indicates GPI linkage, and the
  boxed F represents O-linked fucose modification of Cripto. (A) Cripto acts as a
  coreceptor for Nodal. (B) Cripto can act as a coligand together with Nodal. Following
  cleavage of the GPI linkage of Cripto, Nodal and Cripto can act together as a paracrine
  signal.
