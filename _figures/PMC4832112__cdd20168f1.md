caption: Necroptotic pathway. Necroptosis can be triggered by engagement of TNF-α
  to TNF receptor superfamily (e.g. TNFR, Fas, and DR4/DR5), Toll-like receptors (e.g.
  TLR3 and TLR4), T-cell receptors, interferon receptors, cellular metabolic and genotoxic
  stresses, or some anticancer compounds. RIP1–RIP3–MLKL complex, also called ‘necrosome',
  is a critical mediator of the necroptotic pathway that bridges the signals of upstream
  cell death receptors (or other receptors) and downstream executing molecules and
  events, such as plasma membrane permeabilization, cytosolic ATP reduction, and reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) burst. In TNF-α-induced necroptosis, TNF binds to the TNF receptors
  and engages a big complex formation called Complex I, which includes cIAP1, cIAP2,
  CYLD, RIP1, and TRAF2. cIAPs induce RIP1 polyubiquitination to inhibit Complex IIa
  in which caspase-8, FADD, and RIP1 are involved, and Complex IIb, comprising the
  caspase-8, FADD, RIP1, RIP3, MLKL formation, thus blocking RIP1-mediated apoptosis
  or necroptosis. In addition, polyubiquitinated RIP1 recruits NEMO and TAB2 that
  mediate NF-κB activation and MAPKs (i.e. ERK, JNK, p38) activation, respectively.
  Unlike the RIP1 polyubiquitination that benefit cell survival, CYLD deubiquitinates
  RIP1 and promotes the packaging of Complexes IIa and IIb. In the Complex IIa, activated
  caspase-8 cleaves and abolishes the activities of RIP1, RIP3, and CYLD, thus blocking
  necroptosis. However, when the cleavage of RIP1 and RIP3 is prevented by caspase-8
  inhibitors (e.g., zVAD) or by the genetic deletion of caspase-8 or FADD, the Complex
  IIb forms and initiates necroptosis. Necroptosis can be pharmacologically inhibited
  by Nec-1 (RIP1 kinase inhibitor), GSK-843/-872 (RIP3 kinase inhibitor), and necrosulfonamide
  (NSA, MLKL inhibitor). TNFR1, TNF receptor 1; NEMO, IKK-γ; DR4/5, death receptor
  4 or 5; TLRs, toll-like receptors; TCR, T-cell receptor; TAK1, transforming growth
  factor-β-activated kinase 1; TAB2, TAK1-binding protein 2; TRIF, Toll/IL-1 receptor
  domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-β
