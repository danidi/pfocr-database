caption: Chromophore regeneration in vertebrate and invertebrate photoreceptors. (A)
  Simplified version of the vertebrate visual cycle by which 11-cis retinaldehyde
  (Ra) is regenerated after bleach. The enzymes Lrat and Rpe65 (in white) are critical
  components of this pathway, which reside in the RPE. (B) In invertebrate rhabdomeric
  photoreceptors, opsin protein binds both cis- and trans-retinaldehyde, allowing
  photoregeneration of bleached photopigment. Rol, retinol. Opsin protein is represented
  in cartoon form by seven transmembrane α-helices.
