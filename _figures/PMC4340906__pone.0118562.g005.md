caption: 'Signaling pathways involved in vaccine up-regulation of IDO1 biosynthesis
  in human DCs were identified by Ingenuity Pathway analysis of proteins detected
  in vaccinated DCs by mass spectrometer analysis. (Red: up-regulation of the protein,
  Green: down-regulation of the protein, Grey: protein levels unchanged, White: Undetected).
  Based on calculations generated from the mass spectrometry data, the IPA program
  indicates the vaccine up-regulates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signal transduction
  pathways and down regulates TYROBP to increase IDO biosynthesis. NF-κB1: is the
  P105 precursor subunit of NF-κB which is cleaved to generate the P50 subunit of
  the canonical NF-κB transcriptional activator protein, located in the cytoplasm.
  NF-κB2: is the P100 subunit of non-canonical NF-κB, cleaved to generate the p52
  subunit, located in the cytoplasm.'
