caption: Vitamin B-12 transport by Ton-B dependent systems occurs closely to reactions
  of the 1,2-propanediol degradation pathway, which is confined by BMC-shell like
  proteins. BMC-A encoded proteins are shown in blue color. Proteins are localised
  based on prediction (all but the BMC-shell marker), microscopic evidence (of BMC,
  and ExbD*) and literature (TonB-dependent transport system, Pdu proteins). OM, outer
  membrane; CM, cytoplasmic membrane; TBDT, TonB-dependent transporter; hp, hypothetical
  protein; unchar.exo.sacch, uncharacterized protein exopolysaccharide synthesis.
  Propenediol degradation pathway and localization of Pdu proteins relative to BMC-shell
  is assumed based on characterized BMCs.
