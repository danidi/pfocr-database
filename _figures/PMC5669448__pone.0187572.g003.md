caption: The nodes represent the diseases; the edges connect the disease portraits
  sharing the highest number of spots. The portraits are provided as thumbnails to
  each node. The graph is divided into the pink and the blue clusters using the walktrap
  community search algorithm, implemented in R package “igraph” [].
