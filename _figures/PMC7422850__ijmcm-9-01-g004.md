caption: 'Anti apoptotic effect of curcumin. Curcumin prevents cell death by reducing
  both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis,
  death ligands such as TRAIL and FAS cause death receptors activation, which leads
  to the activation of pro-caspase and caspase 8 and 10, which consequently activate
  caspase 3 and 7 and lead to apoptosis. In the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis caused
  by any damage, such as DNA damage, hypoxia, etc., cytochrome C is released and results
  in the production of apoptosome, and therefore to the activation of caspasce-9,
  caspase 3 and 7, and finally apoptosis. Some proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-XL inhibit
  BAX, which leads to stability of the MOMP protein causing mitochondrial survival
  and inhibiting the apoptosis process. On the other hand, SMAC protein is an inhibitor
  of XIAP. XIAP is a caspase 3 and 7 inhibitor. Curcumin may inhibit both intrinsic
  and extrinsic apoptosis, and therefore inhibit the occurrence of cell death. FADD:
  Fas-associated protein with death domain; TRAIL: tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing
  ligand; BID: BH3 interacting-domain death agonist; Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma 2; MOMP:
  mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; SMAC: second mitochondria-derived
  activator of caspases;XIAP: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein'
