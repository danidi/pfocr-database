caption: (A); Nrp1 is expressed in GBM cells, where it along with canonical TGFβ receptors,
  serves as a co-receptor for TGFβs. Nrp1 enhances canonical TGFβ receptor signaling
  in GBM cells. In addition, Nrp1 in GBM cells can influence TGFβ receptor signaling
  in vascular endothelial cells and probably other cells in the tumor microenvironment.
  Nrp1 can also regulate VEGF-A signaling in GBM cells and in endothelial cells of
  the tumor microenvironment. (B); Targeting the VEGF-A pathway with bevacizumab disrupts
  the Nrp1-dependent balance in VEGF-A versus TGFβ signaling pathway by down-regulating
  Nrp1 expression In GBM cells, thus promoting neovascularization and tumor recurrence
  in response to VEGF-A neutralization.
