caption: A multiomics approach leveraged a cholesterol metabolizing environmental
  bacterium to understand this metabolic activity in the human gut microbiota. Hog
  sewage lagoon bacterium E. coprostanoligenes converts cholesterol to coprostanol.
  Characterization of this activity in cultures revealed the chemical logic of this
  pathway and led to the discovery of a critical enzyme, IsmA. Homologs of ismA were
  classified phylogenetically and identified in as-yet-uncultured human gut bacteria.
  Paired metagenomic–metabolomic samples revealed that ismA+ encoders have less fecal
  cholesterol and more coprostanol than nonencoders. ismA is inversely correlated
  with serum cholesterol levels, suggesting that gut bacterial cholesterol metabolism
  may reduce host cholesterol levels and risk for cardiovascular disease.
