caption: Crosstalk and regulation of innate immune cells in the esophageal cancer
  tumor microenvironment. Among the multiple innate immune cells involved in esophageal
  cancer progression, NK and γδT cells are active in the front line of anti-tumor
  defences with their powerful cytotoxicity. Mature dendritic cells (mDC) play vital
  roles in antitumour responses by boosting the function of CD8+ effector T cells,
  while chemoradiotherapy can promote DC maturity by increasing HMGB1 levels in the
  tumor microenvironment (TME). IL-17 derived from Th17 cells and MCs can activate
  CD169+ tumor infiltrating macrophages (TAMs) and effector CD8+ T cells, as well
  as recruit NK cells, CD1a+ immature DCs (iDC) and neutrophils (Neu) into the TME
  by stimulating cancer cells to release various chemokines, thereby exerting antitumour
  effects. Although the mechanism is unknown, eosinophils are also involved in the
  anti-tumor process. On the contrary, neutrophils can also promote tumor development
  by inhibiting NK cell function in response to IL-8, as well as by forming NETs after
  tumor-induced apoptosis. MCs can promote tumor cell growth through the TK1/mitogenic
  kinin pathway. Importantly, tumor cells can escape from innate immune surveillance
  by promoting TAM progression to a suppressive M2 phenotype, which inhibits CD8+
  T cell function by transforming DCs into an immunosuppressive phenotype (isDC) and
  recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells to inhibit the cytotoxic effects of
  CD8+ T and NK cells.
