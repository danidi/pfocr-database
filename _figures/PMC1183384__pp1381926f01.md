caption: Pyrimidine de novo synthesis pathway. The orotate pathway of pyrimidine de
  novo synthesis is the formation of UMP from carbamoyl phosphate, Asp, and phosphoribosyl
  pyrophosphate. The pathway consists of the six enzymatic reactions catalyzed by
  carbamoyl phosphate synthase (CPSase), Asp transcarbamoylase (ATCase), dihydro orotase
  (DHOase), dihydro orotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), and, finally, UMP synthase (UMPSase).
