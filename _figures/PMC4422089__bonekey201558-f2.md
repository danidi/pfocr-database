caption: Vicious cycle between osteoclasts and cancer cells in the bone. Bone-derived
  growth factors, (GFs) such as insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and transforming
  growth factor-β (TGF-β), promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis and stimulate
  epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and production of bone-modifying cytokines
  such as parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and
  interleukin-11 (IL-11) in bone-colonizing cancer cells, supporting the ‘Seed and
  Soil' theory proposed by Paget. These bone-modifying factors further stimulate osteoclastic
  bone resorption via activation of receptor activator of the nuclear factor-κB (RANKL)/RANK
  pathway in osteoblasts and osteoclasts, thereby further increasing the release of
  bone-stored growth factors, thus establishing ‘vicious cycle' between bone-resorbing
  osteoclasts and bone-colonizing cancer cells. Some bone-colonizing cancer cells
  reside in stromal cell niche via cell–cell contact mediated by cell adhesion molecules
  (CAMs) and stay dormant or undergo EMT and acquire further aggressiveness. Sensory
  neurons innervate bone. Role of osteocytes in bone metastasis needs to be elucidated.
  CAM, cell adhesion molecule, CNS, central nervous system, EMT, epithelial–mesenchymal
  transition, RANK, receptor activation of NF-κB, RANKL, receptor activation of NF-κB
  ligand.
