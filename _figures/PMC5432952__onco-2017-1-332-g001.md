caption: 'Showing the TRAIL signalling pathway: A) the apoptotic pathway induced by
  TRAIL; and B) the resistance to TRAIL induced apoptosis. Binding of TRAIL and trimerisation
  of TRAIL death receptors leads to recruitment of FADD, an adaptor molecule that
  is capable of caspase-8 recruitment and activation. Apoptosis is either induced
  through direct caspase-8-mediated caspase-3 activation or through an amplification
  loop involving the mitochondria and the cleavage of the BH3-only protein Bid by
  caspase-8, cFLIP interferes with the generation of active caspase-8, attenuating
  the role of DISC. Adapted from Naoum et al., 2016.'
