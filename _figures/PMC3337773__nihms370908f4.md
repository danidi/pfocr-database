caption: (A) Analysis of metabolism is similar in principle to the analysis of traffic
  patterns, with many of the same uncertainties. The high “flux” on a four-lane highway
  leads to a low density of cars, all of which travel unimpeded southward. Upon exiting
  the highway, drivers experience reduced flux because of the traffic light, akin
  to mutation or under-expression of a metabolic enzyme. This causes an increased
  density of cars north of the light. Flux downstream of the block is unimpeded. Note
  that red cars on the two-lane road also merge with black cars, leading to a reduced
  fraction of red cars downstream of the intersection. The sum effect of these factors
  on overall flux is demonstrated by counting the cars that pass the checkered flags.
  On the highway, 1000 cars, all red, pass in one hour. On the two-lane road, only
  200 cars pass, and only half are red.(B) Simple schematic of metabolic flux analysis.
  Glucose labeled with 13C at positions 1 and 6 (red asterisks) is given via injection
  or oral administration to a subject, which metabolizes it. After a period of time,
  tissue or body fluids are sampled to determine the abundance of various metabolites,
  the fraction of the metabolite that contains 13C, and the position(s) of 13C within
  the molecule. Data are acquired using mass spectrometry or NMR spectroscopy. Mathematical
  models are then applied to translate the data into metabolic flux. In this example,
  labeling of lactate and acetyl-CoA are examined. The pathways producing these two
  metabolites diverge at pyruvate. LDH, a highly active enzyme, rapidly converts pyruvate
  to lactate, resulting in a very high enrichment in the lactate pool in a short time.
  Meanwhile, two factors conspire to reduce enrichment in acetyl-CoA. First, this
  pathway involves PDH, a highly regulated and less active enzyme. Second, entry of
  carbon from unlabeled nutrients contributes to the acetyl-CoA pool, reducing the
  fraction of acetyl-CoA molecules containing 13C from glucose.
