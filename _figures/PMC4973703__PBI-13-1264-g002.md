caption: 'Schematic diagram of the main lipid classes and biochemical pathways involved
  in the production of TAG in developing seeds. Indicated are the omega‐3 and omega‐6
  LC‐PUFAs percentages (%) in main lipid fractions of Camelina sativa seeds from line
  AP5#1_5 (T3). The relative sizes of the different pools are not directly reflected
  by the size of each node—the predominant major lipid class is TAG, followed by DAG.
  The major phospholipid species is PC, and then PE, although all phospholipids are
  minor components compared to neutral lipids. The acyl‐CoA pool is a very small but
  highly dynamic pool. Fluxes between the different pools are bidirectional (apart
  from the terminal synthesis of TAG) and consequently can only be inferred from these
  steady‐state measurements. CPT, CDP‐choline: diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase;
  DGAT, acyl‐CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; EPT, CDP‐ethanolamine:diacylglycerol
  ethanolaminephosphotransferase; G3P, glycerol‐3‐phosphate; GPAT, acyl‐CoA:glycerol
  3‐phosphate acyltransferase; LACS, long‐chain acyl‐CoA synthetase; LPA, lysophosphatidic
  acid; LPAT, acyl‐CoA:lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase; LPCAT, acyl‐CoA:lysophosphatidylcholine
  acyltransferase; PA, phosphatidic acid; PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase; PDAT,
  phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase; PDCT, phosphatidylcholine:diacyglycerol
  cholinephosphotransferase; PEM, phosphatidylethanolamine N‐methyltransferase; PLA

  synthase.'
