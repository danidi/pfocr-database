caption: 'Fluid state activation of the alternative pathway leads to C3b that can
  indiscriminately bind to host or pathogen surface. On the right (pathogen), complement
  activity propagates without the disruption of regulatory proteins. On the left (host),
  plasma proteins in conjunction with surface-bound regulators actively inhibit complement
  propagation by disrupting complement interaction at different points of the alternative
  pathway. Abbreviations: C3, complement component 3; C3(H2O), thioester-hydrolyzed
  form of C3; C3(H2O)Bb, initial C3 convertase of AP; C3a, anaphylatoxin fragment
  from C3; C3b, activated fragment from C3; iC3b, inactivated C3b; nfC3b, nascent
  fluid phase C3b; nhC3b, nascent host C3b; npC3b, nascent pathogen C3b; fC3b, fluid
  phase C3b; fC3bBb, fluid phase C3 convertase, C3bBb, C3 convertase; C3bBbP, C3 convertase
  with properdin; C3bBbP*, C3 convertase with properdin* released from neutrophils;

  CD59, Protectin. Lines and colors: solid lines with an arrow tip denote activation
  and dashed lines with a straight tip denote inhibition. Red line color denotes inhibition.
  The rest of line colors denote clusters of reactions involving different C3b molecules,
  i.e. nhC3b (orange), nfC3b (light blue), npC3b (purple), fC3b (dark blue).'
