caption: 'Overview of the mechanism of action of statins. Statins interfere with the
  mevalonate synthesis pathway by inhibiting the action of the enzyme HMG-CoA. This
  inhibition results in reduced cholesterol as well as other several isoprenoid molecule
  synthesis, attenuation of Rac and Rho isoprenylation and subsequent reduction in
  Rac mediated NADPH oxidase activity and Rho mediated increase in eNOS activity,
  thus improving NO bioavailability in endothelial cells.Abbreviations: eNOS: endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase, NADPH: Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, PP: pyro-phosphate.'
