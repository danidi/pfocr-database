caption: Mechanical signaling and tissue growth. (A) Force generation and force transmission
  occur at apical adherens junctions (left) and basal focal adhesion sites (right).
  At apical junctions, the contractile actomyosin cortices of two neighboring cells
  are mechanically coupled via the E-cadherin adhesion complex. The adaptor complex,
  which links E-cadherin to the cortex, includes proteins, such as vinculin, which
  is mechanosensitive. At basal sites of adhesion, force balance between the contractile
  actomyosin and the ECM is sensed at sites of focal adhesion, which involves integrin
  dimers and associated proteins coupling to actin filaments. (B) Force sensation
  is then converted into a structural reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, increased
  external force promoting polymerized actin. (C) The polymerized state of the actin
  cytoskeleton is then sensed by the transcription activators YAP/TAZ-Yki, a downstream
  component from the Hippo pathway– or myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A,
  a component of the serum response factor (SRF) pathway, which both shuttle to the
  nucleus to promote growth. (D) Mechanical signaling can also affect growth in the
  absence of cytoskeletal reorganization. Force sensation at focal adhesions leads
  to the phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which induces expression
  of cyclin D. The SRF pathway has also been proposed to sense the level of adhesion
  with the ECM in an actin-independent way, via Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and
  p38. Also involved in this regulation and shown on the figure are the SRF cofactors
  (Sap and Net) at the SRF-binding consensus element (CArG).
