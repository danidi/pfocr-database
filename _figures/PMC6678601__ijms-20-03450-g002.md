caption: A simplified view of the phytochrome-mediated photomorphogenesis in A. thaliana.
  For simplicity, we use PIF3 as a representative of PIFs, HY5 as a representative
  of the master transcription factors of photomorphogenesis, and SPA1 as a representative
  of the SPA proteins. In the dark (left panel), phytochromes are biosynthesized as
  the inactive Pr forms, staying in the cytoplasm. Meanwhile, PIF3 proteins accumulate
  in the nucleus and regulate the expression of genes to prevent photomorphogenesis
  (shown as a blue T bar) by promoting skotomorphogenesis (shown as a red arrow).
  In addition, the COP1-SPA1 complex constantly degrade the expressed HY5 proteins
  via the ubiquitin 26S proteasome pathway to prevent photomorphogenesis (shown as
  a dotted black arrow). In the light (right panel), the photoactivated Pfr forms
  of phytochromes translocate into the nucleus (in the case of phyA, FHY1 and FHL
  are the facilitators for the import), where they can interact with downstream signaling
  components. They inactivate PIF3 by inducing protein degradation and the COP1-SPA1
  complex by inducing its dissociation and subsequent nuclear exclusion of COP1, which
  all contribute to the accumulation of the master transcription factors for photomorphogenesis,
  such as HY5. Finally, HY5 induces the expression of light-responsive genes for photomorphogenic
  development. Movements of proteins are also shown as dotted arrows.
