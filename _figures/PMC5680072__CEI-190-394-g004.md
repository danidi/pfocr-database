caption: 'A schematic presentation of the influence of C4B gene number on host immune
  functions and microbiota in paediatric inflammatory bowel disease. (a) The complement
  system can be initiated in three distinct ways: the classical, the lectin or the
  alternative pathway. (b) These pathways merge to activate C3 to C3a and C3b and
  continue as a common terminal pathway. (c) If the complement system is activated
  fully it leads to the removal of bacteria through bacteriolysis by the membrane
  attack complex or phagocytosis of C3b/iC3b‐opsonized bacteria by neutrophils or
  macrophages. The genetically normal situation with the presence of one to two C4B
  genes in children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in this study is linked
  to a stronger complement activation, intestinal inflammation and lower diversity
  in microbiota. Patients without C4B genes have less complement activation, intestinal
  inflammation and healthier type microbiota. Thereby, they seem to be protected from
  the inflammatory state and disturbed microbiota. C4 is shown in red. Complement
  activation was measured from bacteria‐stimulated IBD patient serum by analysing
  C3a and soluble terminal complement complex (SC5b‐9) levels (shown in green). C3a = C3
  activation product, an anaphylatoxin; C4 = complement component 4; TCC = terminal
  complement complex including complement proteins C5b–C9. TCC indicates both the
  soluble form (SC5b‐9) and the complement membrane attack complex (MAC).'
