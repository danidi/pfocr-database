caption: AhR downstream pathway in the cytoplasm. (A) ① IS can activate the classic
  function of AhR, increasing the expression of target proteins such as CYP1A1 and
  CYP1B1. ② IS can inhibit the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK through the AhR
  pathway in the cytoplasm. The binding of IS to AhR initiates a cytoplasmic signaling
  pathway that inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK, which then reduces
  the expression of Runx2 to impede osteoblast differentiation. (B) ① RSV, an AhR
  antagonist, blocks the activation of AhR and then diminishes the expression of CYP1A1
  and CYP1B1. ② RSV can restore the reduction in ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation
  due to IS and then ameliorate the expression of Runx2 to promote osteoblast differentiation.
  P in red circle means phosphorylation of the substance. Upward red arrow indicates
  increase. Downward red arrow indicates decrease. Dotted blue or red arrow indicates
  weakened.
