caption: Model of PfEMP1 head structure divergence. The PfEMP1 head structure has
  diverged into three major binding groups under selection for EPCR-binding, CD36-binding,
  or to form rosettes with uninfected erythrocytes. The proportion of different head
  structure types in the 3D7 reference genome isolate and their predicted binding
  properties is shown. Note there may be some binding exceptions (e.g. only a subset
  of CIDRα1 domains bind EPCR, see ). CD36 binding is the most common PfEMP1 adhesion
  trait and is associated with mild malaria. EPCR-binding and rosetting is linked
  to group A head structures. Group A PfEMP1 tend to be expressed in early childhood
  infections or malaria naïve, and are also associated with severe malaria. Under
  normal circumstances, protein C (PC) binds to EPCR and is activated by the thrombin
  (T)/thrombomodulin (TM) complex. Activated protein C (APC) that is released into
  the plasma has anti-coagulant activity and the APC/EPCR complex activates the protease
  activated receptor 1 (PAR1) to mediate intracellular signaling. The protein C-EPCR
  signalling pathway has anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and endothelial cytoprotective
  activities that help maintain vascular integrity (). The loss of EPCR at sites of
  P. falciparum IE sequestration () and EPCR-binding parasites () may combine to interfere
  or subvert these pathways and contribute to disease pathogenesis.
