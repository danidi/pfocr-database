caption: 'Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)''s telomere-dependent and independent
  functions.The telomerase is composed of an RNA component, telomerase RNA or telomerase
  RNA component (TERC), which serves as a template for telomeric DNA synthesis, and
  a catalytic subunit, TERT. TERT besides its canonical function in telomere elongation
  has also a role as a transcriptional modula-tor of the Wnt-β-catenin (β-cat) signalling
  pathway. TERT acts as a cofactor in the β-cat transcription complex; in this complex,
  TERT interacts with BRG1, a chromatin remodeling factor, to regulate the Wnt/β-cat
  signalling pathway. TERT is not only acti-vated by the Wnt/β-cat pathway, but β-cat
  could also be directly regulated by TERT induction, which results in maintenance
  of telomere length. In the mitochondria, TERT also plays a role in regulating apoptosis
  in-duced by oxidative damage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Oxidative stress triggers
  nu-clear export of TERT to the mitochondria. CEN: Centromere.'
