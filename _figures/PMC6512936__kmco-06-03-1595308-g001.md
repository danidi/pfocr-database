number: Figure 1
caption: Therapeutic effects of FASN inhibition.The FASN inhibitor IPI-9119 (IPI)
  induces a metabolic reprogramming that affects lipid synthesis and membrane composition
  resulting in the induction of ER stress response [i.e., Protein kinase R (PKR)-like
  endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) arm]. This is associated with global protein
  synthesis and more specifically AR pathway deregulation. Precision medicine approaches
  to select the best candidates for treatment can be based on metabolic imaging (e.g.,
  11C-acetate) or DNA sequencing to identify genetic alterations that induce dependence
  on de-novo lipid synthesis. The PET/computerized tomography fused image included
  in the figure was kindly provided by Prof. Umar Mahmood (Massachusetts General Hospital,
  Boston, MA). Black arrows indicate metastatic sites. AR = androgen receptor, AR-V7
  = androgen receptor, splicing variant V7, ER = endoplasmic reticulum, FASN = fatty
  acid synthase, mCRPC = metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, PET = positron
  emission tomography.
