caption: 'Wild-type and mutant VSV induce apoptosis via distinct pathways, but cross-talk
  does occur.Notes: Wild-type VSV M protein-mediated shutdown of host gene expression
  induces the intrinsic apoptotic pathway involving the release of cytochrome C from
  mitochondria into the cytosol. Formation of the apoptosome allows for the activation
  of caspase-9 and downstream caspases, which culminates in the death of the infected
  cell. VSV∆M51 induces apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway as a consequence of the
  detection of viral replication intermediates by double-stranded RNA-regulated protein
  kinase (PKR) and/or via type I interferon signaling. Downstream effects of PKR signaling
  induce the dimerization of FasR and Daxx to facilitate the phosphorylation of ASK-1.
  Phosphorylated ASK-1 activates the JNK signaling cascade, leading to the upregulation
  of proapoptotic factors and increased surface expression of death receptors (eg,
  the death-inducing signaling complex, DISC, which can activate caspase-3). Additionally,
  the production of viral proteins induces the endoplasmic reticulum stress response
  and leads to the activation of caspase-12. Blue arrows indicate points of cross–talk
  between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The dashed arrows in the figure indicate
  multi-step processes.Abbreviations: ASK, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; Daxx,
  Fas death domain-associated-xx; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; IFN, interferon; MAC,
  mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel; MKK4, mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase 4; pASK, phosphorylated ASK; pJNK, phosphorylated JNK; PKR, RNA-regulated
  protein kinase; pMKK4, phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4;
