caption: Proposed model for the observed inhibitory effects of α-catulin and α-catenin
  on the activation of cyclin D1 transcription. The cyclin D1 promoter is activated
  by serum via a Ras-mediated pathway which signals to the EtsB binding site and by
  a β-catenin-mediated signaling pathway (inducible by LiCl) which signals to the
  TCF-1 binding site. α-Catenin likely inhibits β-catenin-mediated activation through
  its direct interaction with β-catenin, as proposed by others (). We propose that
  α-catulin may inhibit Ras-induced cyclin D1 promoter activation via attenuation
  of Rho-mediated signaling downstream of Ras.
