caption: The complement cascade is initiated via pattern recognition proteins (PRPs)
  of the classical pathway (CP) and lectin pathway (LP) or via tick-over of the alternative
  pathway (AP). Formation of C3 convertases by any route leads to cleavage of C3 and
  opsonization of the activating surface with C3b. The AP also drives amplification
  of the initial complement response as C3b interacts with factor B (FB) and factor
  D (FD) to form new convertases. Insufficiently restricted opsonization enables generation
  of AP C5 convertases that cleave C5 and initiate the terminal pathway (TP), which
  leads to formation of membrane attack complexes (MACs). Regulator of complement
  activation (RCA) family proteins attenuate convertase assembly and shape immune
  responses by acting as cofactors for the regulatory protease factor I (FI) that
  degrades C3b to iC3b and C3dg. C3b and its degradation products bind to complement
  receptors and stimulate phagocytosis and/or immune signalling. The release of anaphylatoxins
  (C3a and C5a) during complement activation mediates the attraction and priming of
  immune cells and helps to orchestrate downstream inflammatory responses. Therapeutic
  complement inhibition can be achieved by preventing initiation in a pathway-specific
  manner, by controlling the activation and amplification of the response at the level
  of C3 or at the level of the CP and LP C3 convertase or by modulating specific effector
  pathways or functions. Major targets for complement therapeutics include C3, C5
  and C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1). Ab, antibody; Bb, cleavage product formed from the degradation
  of FB; C2b, cleavage product formed from the degradation of C2; C3aR, C3a receptor;

  of C4; C4b, cleavage product formed from the degradation of C4; CR1–4, complement
