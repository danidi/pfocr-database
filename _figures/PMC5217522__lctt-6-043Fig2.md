caption: 'Possible explanation for opposing Notch-1 effects on NSCLC cells.Notes:
  Overexpression of constitutively active proteins is susceptible to experimental
  artifacts, the extent of which can be greatly modulated by environmental conditions.
  Here we postulate that overexpression of Notch-1IC may sensitize NSCLC cells grown
  in normoxia, while the same genetic manipulation may have opposite effects under
  hypoxia due to the interactions between Notch-1IC and HIF-1α detailed in the text.
  A tentative mechanistic explanation of the latter effect is the observed autocrine
  feedback loop between IGF-1, IGF-2, and the IGF-1R mediated by Notch-1 in hypoxic
  NSCLC cells.Abbreviations: HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; IGF, insulin-like growth
  factor; IGF-1R, IGF-1 receptor; NSCLC, non-small-cell lung carcinoma.'
