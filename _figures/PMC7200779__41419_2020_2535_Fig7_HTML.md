caption: SVEP1 is one of the most important cell adhesion molecules as well as extracellular
  matrix proteins that participates in cell-cell adhesion. There are several subclones
  with different characteristics in HCC. Some of them are highly expressing miR-1269b
  which is the key cause of SVEP1 degradation. Notably, decreased expression of SVEP1
  in HCC further leads to the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which may
  be the potential mechanism for the recurrence and metastasis of HCC.
