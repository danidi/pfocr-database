caption: Regulation of Fe deficiency responses in photosynthetic organisms. (a) Regulation
  of Fe deficiency responses in Cyanobacteria. Fe Uptake Regulator (Fur) is the master
  regulator of Fe responses and acts as a transcriptional repressor under sufficient
  Fe. Fur represses the Fe uptake machinery as well as Iron Stress Induced protein
  A (IsiA). During Fe deficiency Fur is degraded by the protease complex, Filamentous
  H 1/3 (ftsH1/ftsH3). The expression of the Sulfur Utilization Factor (suf) operon
  is fine-tuned by the combined action of SufR and the small RNA called Iron Stress
  Activated RNA 1 (IsaR1). SufR protein, when bound to an Fe–S cluster, represses
  the suf scaffold to avoid excess Fe–S formation. IsaR1 is induced by Fe deficiency
  and represses transcripts for the sufBCD scaffold during Fe deficiency together
  with Cytochrome-b6f (Cyt-b6f) complex and Ferredoxin (Fd1). Ferredoxin C2 (FdC2)
  is hypothesized to regulate IsiA. (b) Regulation of Fe deficiency adjustment in
  Chlamydomonas. The Fe uptake machinery is regulated transcriptionally by Fe-responsive
  Elements in the promoters of the genes for the ferric iron permease (FTR1) and Ferric
  Oxidase 1 (FOX1) and by phosphorylation via the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase
  (MAPK) pathway. Light Harvesting Complex A3 (Lhca3) undergoes N-terminal processing
  (N-TP) during Fe deficiency. Translation of PsaA1 (TAA1) stabilizes PSI under normal
  Fe conditions but the TAA1 protein is degraded during Fe deficiency, but TAA1 mRNA
  remains. (c) Regulation of Fe deficiency acclimation in the chloroplast. Fe deficiency
  responses are regulated by Basic Helix Loop Helix (bHLH) transcription factors,
  and possibly Ethylene Response Factor (ERF) transcription factors. The bHLH transcription
  factors, IAA-Leucine Resistant 3 (ILR3) and Popeye (PYE) interact to repress ferritin
  (FER) and NEET. The ubiquitin ligase, Brutus (BTS) negatively regulates bHLH transcription
  factors. Iron Dependent Regulatory Sequence (IDRS) elements in the promoter of Ferritin
  (FER1) mRNA repress FER expression under Fe deficiency. The PAP/SAL signaling pathway
  may influence responses to Fe deficiency. 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (PAP)
  is a signaling molecule that can move between cellular compartments and inhibit
  exonucleases (XRNs). SAL1 enzyme regulates levels of PAP. XRNs can degrade Ethylene
  Response Factor 1 (ERF1) mRNA resulting in less ERF1 protein accumulation. Targets
  of ERF1 in Fe deficiency have not presently been identified. During Fe deficiency,
  the Ironman/Fe Uptake Inducing Peptide (IMA/FEP) signaling peptides are transported
  in the phloem in order to signal upregulation of Fe uptake in the root.
