caption: 'Inflammasome and metabolism in systemic sclerosis. Molecular pathways involved
  in the metabolic regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in SSc: TCA cycle, fatty acid
  imbalance, and amino-acid metabolism. In SSc, a complex biological loop in which
  the TGF-β1 rich microenvironment, the upregulated glutamine metabolism, and the
  fatty acid dysregulation, could lead to both inflammasome activation with IL-1β
  release and myofibroblasts differentiation, thus foraging the inflammation-driven
  fibrosis. Succinate is formed in the TCA cycle; its levels increase the TGF-β1-induced
  HIF-1α expression, promoting fibroblast differentiation. High levels of succinate
  can support IL-1β expression by stabilizing HIF-1α for IL-1β transcript expression
  to occur. This process is inhibited by itaconate. TGF‐β1 itself is able to enhance
  succinate production, thus foraging this biological loop. SSc fibroblasts have an
  increased glutaminase expression, and an altered glutamine metabolism is an ubiquitous
  trait in SSc. The glutammate-glutamine pathway activates the NLPR3 inflammasome.
  Fatty acid metabolism has been implicated in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome:
  metabolic imbalance itself act as a cue to activate an inflammatory response, though
  the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), which directly
  activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. PUFAs, particularly ω-3 PUFA, regulate NLRP3 inflammasome
  activation, acting as potent inhibitors of both caspase-1 activation and IL-1β release.
  Fatty acid metabolism is dysregulated in SSc, and intradermal adipose tissue is
  atrophied and replaced by collagen-rich fibrous tissue in SSc. SSc, systemic sclerosis;
  TGF-β1, transforming-growth factor beta-1; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha;
  TCA, tricarboxylil acid; IL-1β, interleukin-1 beta; PUFAs, long-chain polyunsaturated
