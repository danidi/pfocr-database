  and CD25 expression on AML blasts is an adverse prognostic marker. In addition,
  CD25 is highly expressed on tumor-promoting CD4+FOXP3+regulatory T cells (Treg cells)
  (not depicted). Anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment may eliminate leukemic
  blasts, LSCs, and Treg cells, leading to enhanced host antileukemic adaptive immunity.
  The tumor necrosis factor superfamily members CD70 and CD27 are both expressed on
  AML blasts. Their interaction in an auto- and/or paracrine manner induces the Wnt
  pathway leading to a stem cell-like phenotype, symmetric cell division, and accumulation
  of blasts. Blocking the CD70/CD27 interaction induces asymmetric cell division and
  differentiation in AML blasts. The most well-studied antibody target in AML and
  myelodysplastic syndrome is CD33. Numerous unconjugated and conjugated anti-CD33
  mAbs have been developed, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO). Anti-CD45 radioimmunoconjugates,
  such as BC8, are designed to kill CD45-expressing AML blasts and act as conditioning
  drugs to ablate endogenous hematopoietic and immune cells before allogeneic hematopoietic
  stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). They may help to reduce conditioning chemotherapy
  and total body irradiation doses, allowing elderly patients to undergo aHSCT. CD56
  (neural cell adhesion molecule) is aberrantly expressed on AML blasts and other
  hematological neoplasms. High CD56 expression correlates with adverse prognosis
  in AML. Natural killer cells (NK cells), an important pillar in the combat against
  cancer, also express high levels of CD56 (not shown). IMGN779, an anti-CD56 antibody–drug
  conjugate (ADC), led to increased infections and infection-related deaths in a trial
  of small cell lung cancer and was discontinued by the manufacturer. CD123, the interleukin-3
  receptor α chain, is expressed on LSCs in AML and chronic myeloid leukemia. Many
  anti-CD123 mAbs are currently under clinical development. Their mechanisms of action
  include direct toxicity (ADCs; SGN-CD123A, IMGN632) and enhanced antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) via NK cells (CSL362/JNJ-56022473/talacotuzumab,
  KHK2823). CD157 is another target for NK cell-mediated ADCC.
