caption: 'Scheme of the Flavonoid Biosynthetic Pathway of Arabidopsis Leading to the
  Synthesis of Anthocyanins, Flavonols, and Proanthocyanidins.Enzymes are indicated
  in uppercase letters, with the corresponding genetic loci given in lowercase italic
  letters. Mutants for regulatory genes are indicated in brackets. Enzymes encoded
  by flavonoid EBGs are underlined, and those encoded by flavonoid LBGs are boxed.
  Abbreviations are as follows: ban, banyuls; CHI, chalcone isomerase; CHS, chalcone
  synthase; C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase; DFR, dihydroflavonol
  4-reductase; F3H, flavanone 3-hydroxylase; F3′H, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase; FLS,
  flavonol synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase;
  PAL, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase; pap1-D, production of anthocyanin pigment1-dominant;
  tt, transparent testa; ttg1, transparent testa glabrous1.'
