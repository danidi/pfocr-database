caption: 'mTOR shapes antigen-presenting cell (APC), natural killer (NK) cell, T cell,
  B cell and endothelial cell homeostasis, growth and function. Depicted is the role
  of mTOR in cells known to be key mediators in the pathogenesis of cell- and antibody-mediated
  rejection. While our knowledge of mTOR function in T cells and DC is extensive,
  less is known about how mTOR modulates B cells, Tfh and NK cells. As a result of
  the pivotal role of mTOR in metabolic programming of all immune cells, global inhibition
  of this pathway with pharmacologic inhibitors will modulate the immune response
  in a manner that remains incompletely understood. Given the importance of complement
  in AMR, C3a and C5a receptor engagement on endothelial cells may affect their proliferation
  via mTOR-dependent events. Abbreviations: PC=plasma cell; APC encompasses dendritic
  cells and macrophages; PD-L1, programmed death ligand-1; VCAM, vascular cell adhesion
  molecule.'
