caption: Scheme of the mechanism by which pioglitazone (PIO) regulates hepatic metabolites,
  lipids and related gene‐expression patterns (italicized). All metabolites, lipids
  and related gene‐expression patterns in the PIO‐treated groups compared to the control
  groups are illustrated in the heat map. Pioglitazone down‐regulates hepatic de novo
  synthesis of fatty acids and disrupts uptake and transport of exogenous fatty acids,
  which may contribute to reduced availability of fatty acids for TG and phospholipid
  biosynthesis in the liver. In addition, pioglitazone treatment lowers the function
  of PLA2, but not LPCAT, leading to decreased production of lysophospholipids. Pioglitazone
  also increases fatty acid oxidation. These changes may contribute to the decreased
  accumulation of lipid in the liver. The pathway was modified from KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg).
  FFA, free fatty acid; FA transporter, fatty acid transporter.
