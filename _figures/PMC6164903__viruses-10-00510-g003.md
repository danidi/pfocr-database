caption: Innate immune response against baculovirus infection in mammalian non-immune
  cells. Baculovirus infection activates the RIG-I/IPS-1/TBK1/IRF3 or cGAS/STING/TBK1/IRF3
  signaling pathway and induces Type I IFN production. Baculovirus DNA is recognized
  by cytoplasmic sensor RIG-I or cGAS [], followed by activation of the IPS-1- or
  STING-mediated signaling pathway. The induction of Type I IFN production by IRF3
  suppresses transgene expression by baculovirus [].
