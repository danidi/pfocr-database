caption: Negative feedback loops at the core of transcriptional oscillators. (A) Diagram
  of a simple negative feedback loop for oscillatory behavior. An activator “A” increases
  activity of a repressor “R,” which in turn decreases activity of the activator.
  (B) Major factors driving daily oscillations of the circadian clock, whereby CLOCK/BMAL1
  drive expression of the inhibitory factors CRY/PER. (C) Stress and DNA damage activation
  of the p53 pathway, whereby 5–9 h. ultradian oscillations in p53 activity drive
  expression of p53 inhibitor MDM2. (D) Hes1 expression is driven by Notch signaling
  and feedback inhibited by Hes1, with an oscillation of ∼2–3 h.
