caption: Model of the mechanism of action of P2X receptors in cardiac myocytes. Stimulation
  of cardiac P2X4R activates eNOS. This is accomplished by a localized increase in
  calcium near eNOS, binding to local calmodulin and leading to increased eNOS activity.
  A calcium gradient is set up by diffusion, with minor amounts reaching the SR. NO
  production can lead to stimulation of two principal downstream effectors, soluble
  guanylyl cyclase with cyclic GMP accumulation and activation of protein kinase G
  (PKG) as well as S-nitrosylation of myocardial proteins. These two downstream effectors
  represent both PKG-dependent and independent pathways, which are known to exert
  a salutary effect in heart failure and in ischemia/reperfusion injury.
