caption: Hypothesis that links sildenafil to TRPC6. Sildenafil inhibits PDE5A, thereby
  indirectly increasing cellular cGMP levels. cGMP signaling activates PKG-1 and subsequently
  PPAR-γ, which inhibits TRPC6 transcription and expression. This leads to reduced
  TRPC6 channel expression at the membrane of the podocyte, thereby reducing TRPC6–mediated
  Ca2+ influx and eventually, podocyte injury in the context of glomerular disease.
  We propose that this pathway can be modulated by blocking PKG-1 with KT5823, activating
  PPAR-γ with pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, or inhibiting PPAR-γ with GW9662.
