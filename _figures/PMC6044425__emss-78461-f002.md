caption: Schematic representation of the N-linked protein glycosylation pathway. N-linked
  protein glycosylation takes place in the ER. It starts with the assembly of the
  core glycan on the lipid dolichol. Different saccharides are added to the lipid
  sequentially by different enzymes. The first stage of oligosaccharide assembly takes
  place on the cytoplasmic face of the ER, where a series of glycosyltransferases
  uses a cytoplasmic pool of soluble nucleotide sugar donors as substrates for dolichol
  glycosylation. These nucleotide-monosaccharides are synthesized by multiple cytosolic
  enzymes, one of which is GFPT1 (involved in the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc). The first
  sugar—N-acetylglucoseamine (GlcNAc)—is added to dolichol by the enzyme DPAGT1. The
  second GlcNAc is transferred by the Alg13/Alg14 complex, where Alg13 is a catalytic
  subunit and Alg14 is an anchoring subunit that targets Alg13 to the ER membrane.
  Addition of the first mannose is carried out by Alg1, while Alg2 and Alg11 sequentially
  add four more mannose residues. Next, the resulting Dol-P-P-GlcNAc2 Man5 intermediate
  is flipped so that the oligosaccharide is facing inside the ER lumen. This step
  is carried out by an as yet unknown mechanism. Addition of subsequent sugar moieties
  is carried out inside the ER lumen. Here, the monosaccharide donor substrates are
  dolichyl-phosphate–linked monosaccharides Dol-P-mannose and Dol-P-glucose, which
  are synthesized on the cytoplasmic face of the ER by Dpm1/2/3 and Alg5 enzymes,
  respectively. Extension of Dol-P-oligosaccharide is carried out by Alg3, Alg9, and
  Alg12, which add four mannose residues. The final three glucose residues are added
  by Alg6, Alg8, and Alg10, completing the assembly of the core glycan. The core glycan
  is then transferred to asparagine residues of nascent proteins by the multimeric
  oligosaccharyl transferase complex (OST). The core glycan can then be modified inside
  the ER and Golgi to yield the final complex saccharide structure found on the mature
  proteins. Mutations in many of the enzymes of the N-linked protein glycosylation
  pathway have been associated with diseases. In this figure, genes in which mutations
  are known to lead to the development of CDG disorders are shown in blue. Genes in
  which mutations cause development of CMS are enclosed in red boxes.
