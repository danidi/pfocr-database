caption: Schematic representation of the two modes of Gq/11-coupled receptor mechanisms
  in SCG neurons. Both pathways involve activation of Gq/11 G-proteins, PLC, and PIP2
  hydrolysis. The “mode 1” pathway suppresses M current (IM) and Ca2+ current (ICa)
  attributable to depletion of PIP2. Mode 1 does not elicit [Ca2+]i signals. The “mode
  2” pathway does elicit [Ca2+]i signals and concurrently stimulates PIP2synthesis
  via NCS-1. Released Ca2+ binds to NCS-1 and to CaM. Ca2+/CaM binds to M channels,
  resulting in their inhibition.
