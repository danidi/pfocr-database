caption: As part of the intercellular endocytic communication pathway, TLR-binding
  microRNA transmitted via extracellular vesicles serve adaptive and maladaptive stress
  responses. Environmental stress (1) promotes secretion of extracellular vesicles
  and microRNA, (self-) antigen and danger-associated molecule release (2). After
  uptake by innate immune cells, specific GU-rich extracellular vesicle-encapsulated
  microRNA sequences can stimulate TLR-7/8 signaling in the endosome of recipient
  cells. Subsequent activation of the NF-κB pathway exacerbates inflammation through
  cytokine secretion, expression of co-stimulatory molecules (3) and self-induction
  of TLR-binding microRNA expression and extracellular vesicle secretion (4).
