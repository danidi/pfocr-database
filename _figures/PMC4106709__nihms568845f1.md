caption: Hexokinase and mTORC1 cooperate to sense disequilibrium between glucose uptake
  and utilization and direct the balance of cell growth and autophagy to maintain
  cellular homeostasis. When intracellular glucose concentrations are limiting, Hexokinase-II
  (HK-II) binds mTORC1 and inhibits its activity, suppressing cell growth and promoting
  autophagy. By contrast, when glucose uptake exceeds the rate of metabolism through
  one of three pathways (glycolysis, glycogen synthesis and/or pentose phosphate pathway),
  the accumulation of G6P disrupts the interaction between HK-II and mTORC1 to promote
  cell growth and suppress autophagy.
