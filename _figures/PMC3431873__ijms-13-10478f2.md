caption: Generation of free radicals in aging and Parkinson’s disease (PD). A major
  source of free radicals is mitochondria (mt), mitochondrial complex inhibition either
  by toxins or aging hampers the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which causes incomplete
  oxygen reduction, thereby generate reactive species including deleterious superoxide
  anion (O2−) which is converted to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and then finally to hydroxyl
  radical (·OH) through the Fenton reaction which involves Fe2+ or Cu2+ (not shown).
  ·OH is a potent inducer of membrane lipid peroxidation. Oxyradicals can also be
  generated in response to calcium influx. Nitric oxide (NO) interacts with O2− to
  form peroxynitrite (NO3−), Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species
  (RNS) contribute to oxidative and nitrosative stress, respectively, which finally
  causes neurodegeneration. Mitochondrial activity is lost or mitochondrial DNA is
  damaged during aging, which could lead to generation of ROS. Cytoprotective pathways
  are activated with the generation of free radicals. Activation of the Nrf2 pathway
  provides protection by regulating redox balance, whereas the NF-κB pathway causes
  increased cytokine release which is included in positive feedback to initiate the
  inflammatory cascade and also through influx of calcium ions inside the extracellular
  space.
