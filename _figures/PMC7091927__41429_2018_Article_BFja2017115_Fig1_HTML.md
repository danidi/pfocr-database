caption: Life cycle of influenza virus and anti-influenza virus drugs. Influenza virus
  is incorporated into the cell via endocytotic pathway and viral ribonucleoprotein
  complex (vRNP) which consists of viral genome RNA, viral polymerases and nucleoprotein
  is released into the cytoplasm. vRNP is transported into the nucleus where transcription
  and replication occur. In replication step, complementary RNA is synthesized, and
  then, progeny vRNPs are synthesized from complementary RNP (cRNP). Progeny vRNPs
  are transported to cytoplasm by binding to matrix protein 1 (M1) and nuclear export
  protein (NEP). Budding of progeny virion is occurred under plasma membrane with
  viral membrane proteins (HA, NA and M2). Amantadine and rimantadine inhibit M2 ion
  channel activity, and therefore, inhibit release of vRNP into cytoplasm. VX-787
  and S-033188 inhibit transcription of viral mRNA by binding to viral polymerase
  complex. Favipiravir and ribavirin inhibit viral RNA synthesis. Zanamivir, oseltamivir,
  peramivir and laninamivir octanoate all inhibit neuraminidase activity of NA by
  binding to the active center of the enzyme, and therefore, inhibit release of progeny
  virion from the cell surface. A Full color version of this figure is available at
  Journal of Antibiotics online.
