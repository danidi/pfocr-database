caption: Surfactant metabolism. The contents of the lamellar body, including surfactant
  proteins and lipids, are secreted into the alveoli, where they form a phospholipid-rich
  film that is essential for preventing alveolar collapse. Approximately half of the
  alveolar surfactant pool is cleared through a GM-CSF-dependent alveolar macrophage
  pathway. Most of the remaining surfactant is taken up by the type II epithelial
  cell and recycled to the lamellar body, via the multivesicular body/late endosome
  (MVB/LE), for resecretion, while a portion is degraded in lysosomes. Biosynthesis
  of surfactant proteins and lipids is integrated with the recycling/degradation pathways
  to maintain intracellular and alveolar surfactant pool size. Mutations resulting
  in decreased GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor) signaling
  lead to increased alveolar surfactant pool size. Mutations in genes encoding SP-B
  and ABCA3 lead to altered lamellar body structure and loss of surfactant function.
  Mutations in genes encoding SP-C and possibly SP-A lead to misfolded protein that
  is degraded by the proteasome; failure to clear misfolded protein causes cytotoxicity
  and, ultimately, interstitial lung disease (ILD). Mutations in the gene encoding
  telomerase are also associated with cell death and ILD. Mutations in the gene SCL34A2
  disrupt phosphate transport and are associated with formation of microliths in the
  alveolar airspaces. Biosynthetic pathways are shown in blue and catabolic pathways
  are colored red; the width of the arrow indicates the relative contribution of each
  pathway to metabolism.
