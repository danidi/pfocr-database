caption: 'A model to depict Tollip cooperating with Smad7 to mediate degradation of
  the TGF-β receptor complex. Tollip is recruited to TGF-β receptor complex by its
  interaction with Smad7 via its C2 domain. Tollip then forms a complex with ubiquitinated
  TβRI via its two ubiquitin-associated domains: CUE and TBD. The complex is trafficked
  to the endosomes through the endosomes-targeting domain of Tollip and then undergoes
  protein degradation.'
