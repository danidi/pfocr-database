caption: 'Schematic diagram showing the major routes of nitric oxide (NO) biosynthesis.
  NO synthesis occurs through (I) reductive mechanism or (II) oxidative mechanism.
  (I) NO reductive mechanism mostly occurs in plasma membrane, chloroplasts, apoplast,
  peroxisomes, cytoplasm, and mitochondria through reduction of nitrate (NO3−) or
  nitrite (NO2−) by nitrate reductase (NR). NO production through nitrate substrate
  is reduced by cytosolic nitrate reductase (cNR) and plasma membrane-bound nitrate
  reductase (PMNR), whereas NO production through nitrite substrate is reduced by
  plasma membrane-bound nitrite: NO reductase (PM-NiNOR), mitochondrial electron transfer
  chain-dependent enzymatic nitrite: NO reductase (Mt-NiNOR), XOR. In an acidic environment,
  nitrite produces NO through several reversible reactions. Polyamines induce NO production
  through reductive and oxidative mechanisms. (II) The oxidation of L-Arg takes place
  in chloroplasts and leaf peroxisomes. In chloroplasts, the oxidation of L-Arg requires
  nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and calcium ions (Ca2+), whereas
  in leaf peroxisomes, the oxidation of L-Arg requires flavin mononucleotide (FMN),
  flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), calmodulin, and Ca2+. Hydroxylamine acts as a
  substrate in the oxidative mechanism; however, its pathway in NO production remains
  unclear. NOS, NO synthase.'
