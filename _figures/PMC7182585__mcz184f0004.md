caption: Signalling interactions between ABA and mitochondrial ROS. (A) Under salt
  stress conditions, proline (Pro) and mitochondrial ROS are involved in regulatory
  loops involving ABA pathway phospholipase Dα1 (PLDα1) (; ). Depending on stress
  conditions, proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) can be downregulated () or upregulated
  (; ) by proline. Phospholipase Dα1 appears to be regulated by stress-related factors
  that remain to be identified (). (B) The ABA-insensitive-4 (ABI4) transcription
  factor integrates mitochondrial retrograde signals, in particular ETC-derived ROS
  (; ), with chloroplast retrograde signals and ABA signalling (; ; ). (C) According
  to in vitro studies, ABA may act on ATP/ADP and ROS dynamics through inhibition
  of mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) (; ). Decrease in ADP availability
  in mitochondria is associated with the activation of ROS production (; ; ; ; ).
