caption: GCN2 pathway of amino–acid sensing and interaction with mTORC1. GCN2 specifically
  recognizes “uncharged” tRNAs not covalently bound to cognate amino acids. With amino
  acid deficiency, uncharged tRNAs accumulate and bind to GCN2. GCN2 then phosphorylates
  (P) and inhibits eIFα2 and protein synthesis. Studies have shown that amino acid
  deficiency can inhibit mTORC1, either through ATF4 and Sestrin2 or independent of
  these 2 mediators. Inhibition of mTORC1 represses protein and lipid synthesis and
  promotes autophagy. ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; eIFα2, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2α GCN2, general control non-derepressible 2; mTORC1, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin complex 1; tRNA, transfer RNA.
