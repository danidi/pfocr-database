caption: Proposed model for how LMNB1 K134 acetylation can stabilize the nuclear lamina
  and act as a molecular toggle for DNA DSB repair at the nuclear periphery. (A) In
  the presence of WT LMNB1, the lamina is accessible and DNA damage repair factors
  can be recruited to the nuclear periphery. 53BP1 foci can activate the cNHEJ pathway
  for rapid DNA repair and subsequently, cell cycle progression. During herpesvirus
  infection, the nuclear lamina can be disrupted to facilitate viral capsid nuclear
  egress. (B) In cells expressing LMNB1 K134 acetyl mimic, intra-laminar associations
  are favored and the lamina is inaccessible to damaged chromatin. Because 53BP1 recruitment
  to damaged DNA is impaired, the G1/S checkpoint is persistently activated, and DNA
  repair may be slowly accomplished by compensatory pathways. During herpesvirus infection,
  the nuclear lamina is stabilized, impeding viral capsid nuclear egress.
