caption: 'Participation of DNA damage-sensitive RNA1 in homologous recombination.
  DNA damage-sensitive RNA1 (DDSR1) is involved in regulation of homologous recombination
  (HR) pathway via its attachment to breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and heterogeneous nuclear
  ribonucleoprotein U like 1 (hnRNPUL1) (2A). In the absence of DDSR1 (2B) cell proliferation,
  DNA damage response (DDR) signaling and DNA repair capacity by HR are defective.
  The latter has been shown by abnormal assembly of BRCA1 and ubiquitin interaction
  motif containing 1 (UIMC1 or RAP80) at double strand break (DSB) sites. DDSR1 cooperates
  with BRCA1 and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U like 1 (hnRNPUL1), an RNA-
  binding protein participating in DNA end excision. HR is started by a 5′–3′ degradation
  of one strand at both sides of the break, making stretches of single-stranded DNA
  (ssDNA) that is then coated by the ssDNA binding protein complex RPA. This process
  is called DNA-end resection (57). Ub: ubiquitination, CtIP: CtBP-interacting protein,
