caption: Summary of NDR/LATS kinase signalling functioning downstream of Ste20-like
  kinases and upstream of the Hippo effectors YAP/TAZ. Classically, the core cassette
  of the mammalian Hippo pathway includes the Ste20-like serine/threonine protein
  kinases MST1/2 and the AGC serine/threonine protein kinases LATS1/2. Active MST1/2-LATS1/2
  signalling through LATS1/2-mediated phosphorylation of YAP/TAZ can inhibit the transcriptional
  co-activators YAP and TAZ, two major effectors of Hippo signalling. However, the
  list of kinases functioning as part of the Hippo core cassette has been expanded
  recently. In addition to MST1/2, members of the Ste20-like MAP4K kinase family can
  perform the activating phosphorylation of LATS1/2, consequently resulting in YAP/TAZ
  inhibition through LATS1/2-mediated phosphorylation. Moreover, the AGC serine/threonine
  NDR1/2 kinases can act as YAP kinases. Noteworthy, as outlined in more detail in
  the main text, MAP4K4 can also function upstream of NDR1/2, and NDR1/2 as well as
  LATS1/2 kinases phosphorylate additional substrates besides YAP.
