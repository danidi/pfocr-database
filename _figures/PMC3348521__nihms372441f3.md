caption: Schematic diagram showing the various pathways underpinning oestrogen negative
  feedback in the rodent. The principal pathway involves indirect modulation of gonadotrophin-releasing
  hormone (GnRH) neurones through oestrogen receptor (ER)α. A second pathway that
  involves direct and indirect ERβ-dependent modulation is shown. Genes reported to
  be regulated by oestradiol through ERβ in GnRH neurones are shown in the inset.
  Within GnRH neurones, oestradiol is considered to modulate the phosphorylation status
  of cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein, providing another mechanism for
  transcriptional regulation. Two ion channels modulated by ERβ-dependent signalling
  within or outside the GnRH neurone are the voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC)
  and calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa). Together, these pathways may help
  suppress pulsatile luteinising hormone secretion (bottom right).
