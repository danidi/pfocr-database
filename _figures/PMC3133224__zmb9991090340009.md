caption: Molecular interplay between FBXL2, its substrate CCTα, and CaM controls phosphatidylcholine
  (PC) synthesis. (A) CCTα is a dimeric lipogenic enzyme normally bound and stabilized
  by CaM that is activated by membrane binding (e.g., to the Golgi complex). (B) P.
  aeruginosa increases intracellular Ca2+ (red dots) that recruits FBXL2 to membrane-bound
  CCTα (lower right); the activated SCF E3 ligase complex (Skp1-Cullin 1-FBXL2) binds
  and ubiquitinates CCTα, the rate-limiting enzyme required for phosphatidylcholine
  synthesis. The monoubiquitinated CCTα is targeted for disposal via the endosome-lysosome
  pathway. (C) Excess CaM competitively rescues CCTα from ubiquitination by directly
  binding to the FBXL2 E3 ligase via its carboxyl-terminal domain.
