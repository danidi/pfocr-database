caption: Peripheral and central lipid dysmetabolism contributes to AD pathology. Lipid
  dysregulation is a major risk factor for AD. (i) Lipogenesis. LRP2 clears Aβ across
  the BBB by ApoE- and ApoJ-mediated Aβ crosstalk. Peripheral Aβ clearance might be
  mediated by ApoE, ApoJ, and LRP1. Early inflammation in AD inactivates the lipogenic
  pathway to initiate the substrate flux for glucose production, leading to severe
  hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. ApoE4 increases the number of lipid droplet
  and enhances fatty acids oxidation. (ii) Lipolysis. Aβ stimulates lipolysis via
  the PKA and ERK1/2 pathways, phosphorylating HSL and stimulating leptin and IL-6
  secretion, resulting in fatty acid release to trigger lipid deposition and insulin
  resistance. (iii) Ketogenesis. Acetyl-CoA is the substrate of acetoacetate, which
  finally produces β-HB. IL-6-induced p38/NF-κB activation also induces β-HB production.
  β-HB crosses the BBB to serve as brain bioenergy instead of glucose under hypometabolic
  conditions in AD. The brain bioenergy deficit induced by insulin resistance and
  hyperglycemia aggravate AD pathology. ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  1/2; HSL, hormone sensitive lipase; NF-κB, nuclear factor-kB; PKA, protein kinase
  A. Color images are available online.
