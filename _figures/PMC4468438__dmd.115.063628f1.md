number: Fig. 1
caption: The major pathways for the metabolism of IFO. The therapeutic activation
  pathway is depicted vertically. The hydroxylation of IFO occurs on the 4′ carbon
  and is catalyzed by multiple P450s as indicated. Once hydroxylated, the drug exists
  in equilibrium with the open ring form of the compound, aldoifosfamide. Aldoifosfamide
  undergoes spontaneous β-elimination to produce isophosphoramide mustard and acrolein
  in equimolar amounts. The inactivation pathway of IFO is depicted horizontally.
  Numerous P450s can catalyze the N-dechloroethylation of IFO as indicated in the
  figure. N-dechloroethylation can occur at the 2′ or the 3′ carbons resulting in
  the formation of dechloroethylifosfamide and chloroacetaldehyde, both of which are
  toxic.
