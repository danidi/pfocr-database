caption: 'The pathway is divided in two blocks of sequential enzymes all from P. somniferum.
  The thebaine block includes the enzymes involved in the synthesis of thebaine from
  (R)-reticuline: PsSAS, salutaridine synthase; PsCPR, cytochrome P450 reductase;
  PsSAR, salutaridinol reductase; PsSAT, salutaridinol acetyltransferase. The morphine
  block is composed of enzymes involved in the synthesis of morphine from thebaine:
  PsT6ODM, thebaine 6-O-demethylase; PsCOR, codeinone reductase; PsCODM, codeine-O-demethylase.
  Boxed text identifies intermediates used as feeding substrates to test for functional
  expression of the assembled pathways in yeast.'
