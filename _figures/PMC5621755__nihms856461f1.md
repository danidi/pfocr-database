caption: Schematic illustration of the repression of the canonical AhR signaling pathway
  by AhRR. The ligand-activated AhR translocates into the nucleus, dimerizes with
  ARNT and binds on DRE sequences in the promoter region of AhR target genes, including
  CYP1A1 and AhRR. The increased expression of AhRR inhibits AhR activity as a result
  from the competition with AhR for dimerization with ARNT. Alternatively, the formation
  of an AhRR/ARNT complex may inhibit AhR function through binding on DRE sequences,
  which does not involve the competition for dimerization with ARNT.
