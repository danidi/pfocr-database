caption: 'Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathways of L. gasseri HHuMIN
  D. Solid arrows indicate that the metabolism pathways of glycine, serine, and threonine
  are effective and dashed arrows indicate invalid: sdaA/sdaB/tdcG L-serine dehydratase,
  glyA/SHMT glycine hydroxymethyltransferase, AGXT alanine-glyoxylate transaminase,
  glxK/garK glycerate 2-kinase, serA/PHGDH D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, serC/PSAT1
  phosphoserine aminotransferase, serB/PSPH phosphoserine phosphatase, thrH/phosphoserine
  homoserine phosphotransferase, CBS cystathionine beta-synthase, CHO1/pssA CDP-diacylglycerol–-serine
  O-phosphatidyltransferase, trpA tryptophan synthase alpha chain; and trpB, tryptophan
  synthase beta chain. Whole genome sequencing of L. gasseri HHuMIN D was performed
  by Chunlab, Inc. (Seoul, Korea), which used PacBio Sequel Systems (Pacific Biosciences,
  Menlo Park, CA, USA) and analyzed using CLgenomics™ and EZBioCloud Apps programs
  (Chunlab, Seoul, Korea). Biosynthetic pathways of glycine, serine, and threonine
  were analyzed by matching with the KEGG pathway using complete genome sequencing
  of L. gasseri HHuMIN D via CL Genomics™ (ChunLab, Seoul, South Korea, 2004). The
  activities of related genes and substances produced can be inferred through the
  biosynthetic pathways provided by KEGG'
