caption: 'Schematic of the amino acid modulator arm of the mammalian target of rapamycin
  (mTOR) pathway. The canonical mTOR pathway (gray) and its relationship to the amino
  acid modulatory arm of the mTOR pathway is depicted. Several amino acid sensors
  (green) have been defined. The amino acid sensors SAMTOR, Sestrin 1/2, and CASTOR
  impact mTORC1 signaling by directly or indirectly disinhibiting the GATOR1 complex
  (blue). SLC38A9 functions as both an amino acid sensor and amino acid transporter
  coupled to the Ragulator-RAG GTPase complex. Within the amino acid modulatory arm,
  multiple proteins have been linked to cortical malformations and epilepsy including
  known variants in the components of GATOR1: DEPDC5, NPRL3, NPRL2 and multiple components
  of the KICSTOR complex: KPTN, SZT2, and C12 orf66'
