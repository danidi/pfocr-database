caption: (A) The overall reaction scheme involving the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC),
  the fatty acid synthase (FAS) and the thioesterase (TE). (B) Biotinylation of the
  biotin carboxyl carrier protein (AccB) is catalyzed by BirA. The resulting holo-AccB
  participates in ACC-catalyzed carboxylation of acetyl-CoA. (C) Production of saturated
  fatty acids from acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA, catalyzed by the 9-component FAS (FabA,
  FabB, FabD, FabF, FabG, FabH, FabI, FabZ, ACP) and the TE (TesA). (D) Unsaturated
  fatty acids are synthesized via the isomerization of a common intermediate, trans-2-decenoyl-ACP,
  in a reaction catalyzed by FabA, a dual-function isomerase and dehydratase. Subsequent
  elongation of the cis-3-decenoyl-ACP product traps the cis-olefin, leading to eventual
  release of monounsaturated fatty acids.
