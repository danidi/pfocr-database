caption: '(A–E) Show calcium/calmodulin binding and phosphorylation reactions of a
  ring of six functionally coupled subunits of the CaMKII holoenzyme. A gray subunit
  stands for dephosphorylated and a green subunit surrounded by a dotted line for
  phosphorylated. (A,B) The calcium/calmodulin complex—C, blue circle—can bind to
  a dephosphorylated (A) or a phosphorylated subunit (B) with dissociation constants
  K 5 = k −5 / k 5 or K 9 = k −9 / k 9, respectively. Note that the calmodulin binding
  (A,B) and the autophosphorylation steps (shown in C–E) are assumed to take place
  independently of the phosphorylation state of other subunits in the ring (here depicted
  as dephosphorylated, i.e., in gray). Subunits shown in dotted gray can be either
  dephosphorylated or phosphorylated.(C–E) The three possible intersubunit phosphorylation
  steps: in all three cases, the catalytic subunit and the substrate subunit are labeled
  with cat. and sub., respectively. Unlabeled subunits are depicted as dephosphorylated,
  but the three phosphorylation steps are assumed to proceed independently of their
  phosphorylation state.(C) Initiation step: calmodulin has to bind to the two interacting
  subunits, i.e., to the substrate and the catalyst, in order to phosphorylate the
  substrate subunit at Thr286 (shown in green and surrounded by a dotted line).(D)
  Calmodulin is bound to the phosphorylated catalyst and the subunit to be phosphorylated.(E)
  The phosphorylated subunit stays active as catalyst after calmodulin dissociation
  and phosphorylates the substrate subunit bound with calmodulin. k 6, k 7, and k
  8 denote the respective autophosphorylation rates of the three steps described above.(F)
  Protein signaling cascade governing PP1 activity. Interactions shown with a circle
  at the end of a line indicate stimulation—whereas lines ending with a bar stand
  for inhibition of target activity. Calcium/calmodulin—C, blue circle—directly phosphorylates
  CaMKII (blue line). Furthermore, the dephosphorylation of CaMKII by protein phosphatase
  1 (PP1) is indirectly controlled by calcium/calmodulin via a protein signaling cascade
  (red lines). Calcium/calmodulin-directed phosphorylation of inhibitor 1 via cyclic-AMP
  and PKA increases CaMKII activity by inhibiting PP1. This CaMKII stimulating pathway
  is depicted in red dashed lines. On the contrary, activation of calcineurin activates
  PP1 by dephosphorylating inhibitor 1, which in turn leads to increased CaMKII dephosphorylation.
  This pathway, shown in red dotted lines, decreases CaMKII activity.'
