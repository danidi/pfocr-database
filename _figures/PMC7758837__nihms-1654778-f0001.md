caption: Numerous potential therapies for Parkinson disease (PD) are at various stages
  of preclinical and clinical testing. These agents target many aspects of PD pathogenesis.
  Therapies in bold are at advanced stages of testing. Several basic pathophysiological
  pathways are depicted, including those that lead to Lewy bodies, and those involving
  inflammatory factors, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. A synapse
  to the right illustrates the potential spread of pathological α-synuclein to nearby
  cells. Bars indicate either inhibition or decrease and arrows indicate activation
  or increase. Arrows are also used for a sequence of events in a pathway. The exclamation
  marks inside the mitochondrion represent a dysfunctional mitochondrion. AKT, protein
  kinase B; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; DJ1, protein deglycase DJ1; DRP1, dynamin-1-like
  protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GBA, glucocerebrosidase; GDNF, glial cell-derived
  neurotrophic factor; LAG3, lymphocyte-activation gene 3; LRRK2, leucine- rich repeat
  kinase 2; Mdivi-1, mitochondrial division inhibitor 1; MIRO, mitochondrial Rho GTPase
  1; MitoQ, mitoquinone; PINK1, PTEN-induced kinase 1; PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator-activated
  receptor-γ; siRNA, small interfering RNA.
