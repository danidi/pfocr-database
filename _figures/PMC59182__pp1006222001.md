caption: A partial diagram of the phenylpropanoid pathway showing intermediates and
  enzymes involved in isoflavone synthesis, as well as some branch pathways. The enzymes
  in bold are encoded by genes expressed as transgenes in this study. Genes encoding
  the underlined enzymes have been shown to be activated in maize by C1 and R. Dotted
  arrows represent multiple steps. Enzymes are indicated in italics.
