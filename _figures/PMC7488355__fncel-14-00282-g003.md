caption: Potential association between Alcohol Use Disorder and manifestation of Alzheimer’s
  disease (AD). Chronic alcohol intake triggers oxidative stress, increases amyloid
  precursor protein (APP), presenilin (PS1) and nicastrin expression that serves as
  a basis for amyloid β (aβ) production and aβ aggregates. Chronic alcohol intake
  reduces phosphorylation of proteins associated with mTOR/AKT pathway and increases
  total tau expression. Chronic alcohol activates CDK5 and Glycogen synthase kinase-3
  β (GSK3β) and hyperphosphorylates Tau protein into Tau tangles. Aggregates of aβ
  directly causes neurodenegeration and also through tau tangles. Hyperphosphorylation
  of tau proteins results in loss of microtubule stability, causing neurodegeneration.
