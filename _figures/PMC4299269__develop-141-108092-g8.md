caption: Oncogenic Ras promotes overgrowth by stimulating Eiger/TNF exocytosis and
  activating JNK-JAK-STAT non-autonomous proliferation signaling. Eiger normally activates
  JNK to trigger cell death. JAK-STAT signaling on the other end promotes cell proliferation
  (black arrows). Sec15 blocks Eiger-induced cell death (green inhibition arrow) by
  promoting (top green arrow) the exocytosis of Eiger to the surrounding wild-type
  cells (top red arrow). This results in JNK activation in the surrounding wild-type
  (WT) cells, which non-autonomously activates the JAK-STAT pathway (bottom red arrow)
  to promote oncogenic Ras tumor growth.
