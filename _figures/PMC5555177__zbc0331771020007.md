caption: Proposed model depicting the role of PP1c-Gβ1 and PP1c-PLCβ3 complexes in
  GPCR-induced platelet activation. A multiprotein complex of Gβ1 and PP1c exists
  presumably in the vicinity of GPCR. Engagement of GPCR with thrombin or ADP leads
  to the disruption of this complex. A new signal-induced complex of PP1c-PLCβ3 with
  a concomitant dephosphorylation of PLCβ3 Ser1105 occurs. Based on previous findings,
  dephosphorylation of PLCβ3 may aid in signal transmission. Forced disruption of
  PP1c-Gβ1 complex prior to thrombin stimulation reduced platelet aggregation. Collectively,
  these studies suggest that PP1 facilitates thrombin signaling by coupling with Gβ1
  and PLCβ3 in the GPCR pathway.
