caption: a | Mechanisms of acquired resistance. treatment with kinase inhibitors can
  select for mutations that block drug binding (left panel). this was first demonstrated
  for the T315I mutation in BCR–ABL in chronic myeloid leukaemia. treatment with a
  kinase inhibitor can induce upregulation of a second kinase that substitutes for
  the drug target (centre panel). The receptor tyrosine kinase MET (also known as
  hepatocyte growth factor receptor) has been shown to be overexpressed in lung cancer
  cells that acquire resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors.
  Tumour cells can respond to treatment with a kinase inhibitor by down-regulating
  the phosphatase that normally dephosphorylates the substrates of that kinase (right
  panel). This has the effect of decreasing the cellular potency of the kinase inhibitor.
  this mechanism has been observed in acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors in breast
  cancer cells. b | Mechanisms of intrinsic resistance. Many tumours express multiple
  oncogenic kinases that signal redundantly to promote cell survival (left panel).
  For example, some gliomas show constitutive activation of multiple receptor tyrosine
  kinases. Mutational activation of a downstream pathway component can reduce the
  effectiveness of a kinase inhibitor (right panel). KRAS mutations are associated
  with resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung and colorectal cancer–. IGF1R, insulin-like
