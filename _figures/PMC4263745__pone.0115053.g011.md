caption: 'Mechanistically, CSE activated intracellular Caspase-12, which negatively
  regulated NOD1 signaling by suppressing NOD1 and NF-κB and inducing RIP2. As a part
  of downstream effectors of the signaling pathway, hBDs production was subsequently
  inhibited and the defense response to pathogens was dampened. CS: cigarette smoke;
  CSE: cigarette smoke extract.'
