caption: Innate immune response during ADE and non-ADE dengue infection. Canonical
  non-ADE mediated entry occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Upon entry, the
  DENV particles are internalized in endosomes and are recognized by the pathogen
  recognition receptors TLR-3 and 7. Release of viral RNA from endosomes is recognized
  by RIGI and MDA5 which triggers production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and
  IL-8. This activates the JAK/STAT pathway resulting in expression of IFN-γ, IL-12,
  and Nitric Oxide radicals. Virus entry via FcγR-antibody in dengue-ADE caused expression
  of TANK and SARM which inhibits TLR signaling. Production of anti-inflammatory cytokines
  IL-10 and IL-6 ensues and expression of SOCS3 as a result inhibits JAK/STAT pathway.
  This results in inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production and causing a
  TH-2 biased immune response and increased “burst” size.
