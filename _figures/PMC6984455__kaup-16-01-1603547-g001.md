caption: 'Brief mechanisms of Ub-dependent and Ub-independent mitophagy. (a) Initiation
  and mitochondrial labeling: Upon mitochondrial depolarization, PINK1 accumulates
  on the OMM of mitochondria and recruits the E3 ligase PRKN for ubiquitination of
  OMM proteins which are then recognized by mitophagy receptors. While mitophagy receptors
  including FUNDC1, BNIP3/BNIP3L, BCL2L13 and FKBP8 are directly increased to tag
  selected mitochondria in response to mitochondrial depolarization, hypoxia or during
  reticulocyte development in a Ub-independent pathway. (b) Nucleation and extension:
  Early ATG proteins such as ULK1 and other core machinery are recruited for nucleation,
  extension of phagophore membrane and LC3 conjugation. (c) Closure: Mitophagy receptors
  bind to LC3 bound on the phagophores for further expansion and closure to form mitophagosomes.
  4) Maturation: mitophagosomes fuse with lysosomes for mitochondrial degradation.'
