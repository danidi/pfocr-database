caption: 'ABP1 signaling pathway in leaf pavement cells. In leaf pavement cells, auxin
  in the apoplast is sensed by secreted ABP1, which binds to its PM-localized receptor,
  TMK, to activate two intertangled downstream pathways: ROP2-RIC4 and ROP6-RIC1.
  The former contributes to lobe outgrowth through the stabilization of cortical actin
  microfilaments, which suppresses PIN2 endocytosis; the latter, via KTN1, inhibits
  indentation outgrowth through the reorganization of cortical TMs, which suppresses
  the endocytosis of PIN1 and possibly other PINs as well. SPK1 may also contribute
  to the ROP6-RIC1 pathway as it does in the root. Dotted lines and question marks
  indicate potential signaling and signaling components, respectively.'
