caption: Biosynthetic pathway and regulation of cysteine synthesis in Pantoea ananatis
  and related bacteria. The major metabolites and enzymes responsible for cysteine
  biosynthesis from glucose and thiosulfate or sulfate are indicated by solid lines.
  The key regulatory effects provided by feedback inhibition of SAT (encoded by cysE)
  and 3-PGDH (encoded by serA) by cysteine and l-serine, respectively, as well as
  transcriptional regulation by the master regulator of sulfur metabolism, CysB, are
  indicated by dotted lines. NAS, N-acetylserine; OAS, O-acetylserine; PAPS, 3-phosphoadenosine
  5-phosphosulfate; 3-PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; 3-PGDH, 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase;
  SAT, serine acetyltransferase; Sbp, sulfate-binding protein; Ser, serine.
