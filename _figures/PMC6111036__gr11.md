caption: D5R mutation induces dilated cardiomyopathy that is related to oxidative
  stress. D5R deficiency causes an increase in NADPH oxidase activity (I), and prevents
  the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus (II), resulting in a failure of the transcription
  of a number of antioxidative genes via masculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (MAF) and
  antioxidant response elements (ARE). Antioxidant proteins include NAD(P)H quinone
  1 dehydrogenase (NQO1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO1). Oxidative stress accelerates
  the signaling of the ERK1/2 and JNK pathway, impairing the balance between apoptosis
  (BCL2 associated X, apoptosis regulator [BAX]) and anti-apoptosis (B aggressive
  lymphoma protein 2 (BAL2, PARP14 gene). Phospholamban (PLN) is also stimulated which
  inhibits cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA, encoded
  by ATP2A2), which in turn causes cardiac remodeling and finally, dilated cardiomyopathy.
  D5R deficiency also allows Kelch-like ECH Associated Protein 1 (Keap1) to target
  Nrf2 in the cytoplasm for ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome.
