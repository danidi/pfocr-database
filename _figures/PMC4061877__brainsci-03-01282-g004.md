  (A) Transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β1), secreted by resident microglial and
  astroglial cells, stimulates astrocytes in MS lesions to re-express the Notch ligand
  Jagged1 []. Contact-mediated activation of canonical Notch signaling by ligand Jagged
  1 inhibits oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) differentiation and impermissive
  for proliferation []. (B) The denuded axon impermissive for myelination through
  surface expression of inhibitory molecules, such as PSA-NCAM [], and interactions
  between axonal LINGO-1 binding to oligodendroglial Nogo-A [,,] prevent further myelination.
  (C) Activation of a non-canonical Notch signaling pathway triggered by axonal ligands
  including F3/contactin-1 in OPC [,]. (D) Axonal laminin and L1 bind oligodendroglial
  integrin (and then dystroglycan receptor) and contactin-2 promoting oligodendrocyte
  survival and myelination []. Additional abbreviations: L1, axonal cell adhesion
  molecule; MAG, myelin-associated glycoprotein; MOG, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein;
  NgR1; Nogo-receptor 1; OPC, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell; PSA-NCAM, polysialic
