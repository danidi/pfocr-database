caption: A mechanism for integrated regulation of motility and adhesion in T cells
  and its role for transendothelial migration. (a) CXCL12 and integrin ligands up-regulate
  the cell surface expression of thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) and lipoprotein receptor-related
  protein 1 (LRP1). The LRP1 induces motogenic signalling through Janus kinase (JAK)
  whereas intact TSP-1 induces adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)
  and fibronectin through its C-terminal domain via CD47. This ‘adhesion pathway’
  is triggered by interaction of LRP1-associated calreticulin with the N-terminal
  domain of TSP-1. Interaction of the N-terminal domain of TSP-1 with LRP1 concomitantly
  induces cleavage of TSP-1, which accelerates the dominant LRP1-directed motogenic
  pathway through a 130 000 MW TSP-1 fragment and inhibits the triggering of adhesion.
  Enhancement of the cell surface expression of intact TSP-1 by shear flow enhances
  the adhesion pathway. Processing of TSP-1 to a 110 000 MW fragment and reducing
  expression of LRP1 and associated calreticulin inhibits adhesion. Based on the findings
  in Fig.  TSP-1 is implied to appear as an independent component within the plasma
  membrane but, owing to limited space, TSP-1 is placed over the membrane. (b) The
  possible influence of cell surface-expressed TSP-1 and LRP1 induced by CXCL12 and
  integrin ligands on transendothelial migration. Free-floating cells up-regulate
  cell surface expression of intact TSP-1. After initial rolling, loosely attached
  cells in close proximity of the endothelium are activated by CXCL12, which induces
  cell surface expression of LRP1 and enhances TSP-1 expression. LRP1-calreticulin
  promotes firm adhesion/spreading to ICAM-1 through intact TSP-1 and CD47 and the
  association of CD47 to LFA-1. Adhesion and spreading on the endothelium is inhibited
  by TSP-1 cleavage. LRP1 and 130 000 MW TSP-1 stimulate migration through the endothelium
  via JAK signalling. Integrins may bypass the need for chemokine signals to initiate
  transendothelial migration. Subendothelial chemokines or chemokines in endothelial
  junctions stimulate diapedesis. LRP1-dependent TSP-1 cleavage makes the motogenic
  LRP1–JAK pathway dominate over the pro-adhesive TSP-1-CD47 pathway.
