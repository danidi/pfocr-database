caption: 'Schematic representation of the most significant Ingenuity pathway analysis
  (IPA) networks from differentially regulated proteins between the hypothyroid and
  euthyroid states: IPA analysis found the functional interaction networks pathway
  with the highest score of 28 related to “neurological disease, immunological disease,
  metabolic disease” showing tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6 as central nodes
  that were dysregulated in hypothyroidism. Nodes in green and red correspond to down
  and up regulated proteins respectively. Colourless nodes were proposed by IPA and
  suggest potential targets functionally coordinated with the differential proteins.
  Solid lines indicate direct molecular interactions and dashed lines represent indirect
  relationships.'
