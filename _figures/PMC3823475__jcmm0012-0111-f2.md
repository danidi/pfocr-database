caption: Schematic representation of membrane VEGF receptors expressed by astroglial
  tumour cells. Known receptor types are indicated and identified ligands/ligand isoforms
  are listed directly in the figure above. Cell membrane (GC membrane) receptors of
  the VEGF tyrosine kinase receptor family consist of seven Ig-like domains, transmembrane
  region and an intracellular tyrosine kinase binding domain interrupted by a kinase-insert
  sequence. The aberrant sFlt-1 receptor form lacking one Ig-like domain as a result
  of VEGFR1 truncation is also shown. The neuropilin receptor acts as a co-receptor
  for VEGFR2, enhancing binding and biological activity of VEGF165. Ligand binding
  through electrostatic interactions with specific sequences of sulphation within
  the HS chains leads to receptor dimerization and tyrosine domain phosphorylation,
  thereby activating the corresponding signalling pathway.
