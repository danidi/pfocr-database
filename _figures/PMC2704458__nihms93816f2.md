caption: Drug-induced signaling events are depicted for cocaine/amphetamine, ethanol,
  and an inhalant, benzyl alcohol. Cocaine and amphetamine can increase cAMP levels
  in striatum, which activates protein kinase A (PKA) and leads to phosphorylation
  of its targets. This includes the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB),
  the phosphorylation of which induces its association with the histone acetyltransferase,
  CREB binding protein (CBP) to acetylate histones and facilitate gene activation.
  This is known to occur on many genes including fosB and c-fos in response to psychostimulant
  exposure. ΔFosB is also upregulated by chronic psychostimulant treatments, and is
  known to activate certain genes (e.g., cdk5) where it recruits the SWI-SNF chromatin
  remodeling enzyme, BRG1, and represses others (e.g., c-fos) where it recruits HDAC1.
  This repression of c-fos also involves increased repressive histone methylation,
  which is thought to occur via the induction of specific histone methyltransferases.
  It is not yet known how cocaine regulates histone demethylases (HDM) or DNA methyltransferases
  (DNMTs). Cocaine also activates the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade,
  which through MSK1 can phosphorylate CREB and histone H3 at serine 10. Cocaine promotes
  H3 phosphorylation via a distinct pathway, whereby PKA activates protein phosphatase
  2A, leading to the dephosphorylation of serine 97 of DARPP32. This causes DARPP32
  to accumulate in the nucleus and inhibit protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) which normally
  dephosphorylates H3. Chronic exposure to psychostimulants is also known to increase
  glutamatergic stignaling from the prefrontal cortex to the NAc. Glutamatergic signaling
  elevates Ca2+ levels in NAc synapses and activates CaMK (calcium/calmodulin protein
  kinases) signaling, which, in addition to phosphorylating CREB, also phosphorylates
  HDAC5. This results in nuclear export of HDAC5 and increased histone acetylation
  on its target genes (e.g., NK1R [NK1 or substance P receptor). Acute ethanol has
  been shown to reduce histone acetylation by increasing HDAC activity, while withdrawal
  from chronic ethanol increases histone acetylation by reducing HDAC activity. The
  organic solvent, benzyl alcohol, which is used to study the tolerance effects of
  inhalants, rapidly induces histone acetylation on the Ca2+-activated K+ channel,
  slo, to facilitate CREB-dependent transcription. Figure was modified with permission
