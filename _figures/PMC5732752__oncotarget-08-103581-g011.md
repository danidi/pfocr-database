caption: E5 expression results in enhanced EGFR surface expression and activation,
  through a process that might require endosome recycling (1). This increases ERK/MAPK
  activity (2), resulting in activation of substrates, which include cell cycle associated
  proteins e.g. cyclin B (3). EGFR can suppress keratinocyte differentiation, by inhibiting
  a number of targets including the KGFR pathway. KGFR transcription is suppressed
  in E5 expressing cells (4) and KGFR signalling is markedly reduced (5). As a consequence,
  targets of KGFR including Akt are suppressed, culminating in loss of expression
  of a number of spinous associated differentiation markers e.g. cytokeratin 1 (K1)
  (6). As a result keratinocyte differentiation is impaired in cells expressing E5.
