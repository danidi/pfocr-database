caption: 'Scheme of the rational construction of mycobacterial strains producing steroidal
  intermediates from natural sterols by metabolic engineering approaches. Based on
  the knowledge of the catabolic pathway of sterols in actinobacteria, the redirection
  of metabolic flux toward the accumulation/synthesis of C-19 (red) or C-22 (gray)
  steroidal intermediates can be addressed via single/multiple gene deletions. The
  metabolic flux can be also redirected to the synthesis of new steroidal compounds
  by incorporating heterologous enzymatic activities (pink) (e.g., 17β-hydroxysteroid
