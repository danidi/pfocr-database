caption: Schematic illustration of the eCBs action on CB receptors. 2-AG is synthetized
  in the postsynaptic dendritic compartment, whereas AEA synthesis may occur post-
  and pre-synaptically. eCBs are released into extracellular and act as retrograde
  messengers. Activation of CB1 receptors are associated with Gi-dependent inhibition
  of adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, which evoked a decrease of the production of
  cAMP and resulted in modulation of neurotransmitter release. Via the G-protein,
  activation of the CB1 receptor activates MAPK pathway, affecting intracellular gene
  expression, cell division, differentiation and apoptosis.
