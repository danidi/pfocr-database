caption: 'A schematic representation of pathways summary showing identified kinases
  in BTV infected cells. A, Protein kinase A (PKA) activity may contribute to apoptosis
  inhibition and arrest of cell proliferation, extending the duration of viral replication.
  Validation experiments confirmed the importance of PKA activity for BTV replication.
  B, BTV infection induces autophagy. Death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) activity
  was identified and may contribute to autophagy induction during BTV infection. C,
  PAS Domain Containing Serine/Threonine Kinase (PASK) activity increased during BTV
  infection, possibly increasing translation efficiency during viral protein synthesis.
  D, Apoptosis is known to be controlled during BTV infection. Several kinases were
  identified as regulated by BTV infection which may contribute to the inhibition
  of apoptosis, these include ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (p70S6K), ribosomal
  protein S6 kinase A1 and 3 (RPS6KA1 and 3), p21-activated protein kinase 2 (PAK2),
  protein kinase C delta type (PKCD) activation and polo-like kinase 3 (PLK3). Inset
  shows various symbols: phosphorylation events, pathway activation, inhibition and
  down-regulation. A yellow shadow shows known kinase activity and a purple shadow
  depicts novel kinase activity.'
