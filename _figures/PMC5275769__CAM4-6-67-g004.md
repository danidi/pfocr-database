caption: miRNAs enriched with OSCC target mRNAs of the neurotrophin signaling pathway.
  Eleven miRNAs were identified as enriched by at least 2× and FDR of <0.007 in OSCC
  versus normal epithelium. mRNAs targeted by one of these miRNAs are in yellow rectangles,
  whereas those targeted by at least two miRNAs are in gold. An examination of expression
  of the pathway mRNAs in the TCGA dataset revealed 5 that were decreased to at least
  0.5× and one that was unexpectedly increased to 2x. Not all are shown in this simplified
  pathway diagram but all are identified in table . OSCC, Oral squamous cell carcinoma.
