caption: 'Potential role played by PDKs in malignant gliomas. Glucose entering the
  cell is metabolized by glycolysis to pyruvate. Most of the pyruvate in non-cancerous
  cells enters the mitochondria under aerobic conditions and a small fraction is metabolized
  to lactate. PDH in mitochondria converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which enters
  the TCA cycle. On the other hand, in glioma cells, the oxidative (mitochondrial)
  pathway of glucose utilization is suppressed, and most of the pyruvate is converted
  into lactate. Hence, the relative activities of LDH and PDH determine the fate of
  pyruvate. PDK, which can be inhibited by DCA, inhibits PDH through phosphorylation
  and regulates its activities. HIF-1 induces PDK, which inactivates PDH resulting
  in suppression of the TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiration. Moreover, HIF-1 also
  stimulates glycolysis and the expression of LDH, thereby facilitating the conversion
  of pyruvate into lactate. DCA: dichloroacetate, HIF: hypoxia-inducible factor, LDH:
  lactate dehydrogenase, PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDK: pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase, TCA: tricarboxylic acid.'
