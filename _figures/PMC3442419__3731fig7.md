caption: Schematic of the mechanism of chondrocyte integration of cues provided by
  ECM stiffness and TGFβ. 1) Chondrocyte differentiation is specifically induced on
  0.5-MPa substrates. 2) This response is mediated through the ROCK pathway. 3) Autocrine
  TGFβ1 expression is required for chondroinduction, the expression of which is inhibited
  on stiffer substrates through a ROCK-dependent mechanism. 4) Whereas Smad3 phosphorylation
  and nuclear localization are increased on 0.5-MPa substrates, softer substrates
  that express autocrine TGFβ fail to activate this downstream effector. 5) Exogenously
  added TGFβ elicits a synergistic response in combination with 0.5-MPa substrates.
  6) This synergistic interaction acts through a p38-MAPK–dependent mechanism, possibly
  through TGFβ activation of TAK1.
