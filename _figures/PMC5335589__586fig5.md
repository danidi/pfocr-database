caption: The extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade was investigated in our
  study. ESRD damage leads to elevated TF levels and initiation of the extrinsic pathway
  and, consequently, platelet activation and secretion and predominance of a pro-coagulant
  pathophenotype, as assessed by elevated levels of fibrinogen, F1+2, TAT, and vWf.
  Constant consumption of factor X leads to failure of platelet activation and predominance
  of a pro-bleeding pathophenotype, as assessed by poor platelet response to ADP and
  epinephrine stimulus and decreased levels of CD62p on the platelet membrane.
