caption: Potential therapeutic targets that regulate YAP/Hippo activity in mesothelioma.
  (I) Activation of EGFR, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), leads to phosphorylation
  and activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 signaling in cancer cells. Inhibitors of MEK1/2
  and ERK1/2 have been shown to reduce YAP-TEAD mediated transcriptional activity
  in cancer cells; (II) activation of certain GPCR, specifically Gα12/13, Gαq11, Gαs,
  turns on Rho/ROCK1/2 signaling in cancer cells. ROCK1/2 inhibition has been shown
  to promote YAP phosphorylation at S127, reduce YAP-TEAD mediated transcriptional
  activity, and suppress cell proliferation of mesothelioma; (III) CDK1 can directly
  phosphorylate YAP and promote YAP nuclear accumulation, suggesting that CDK1 is
  a potential target in cancer treatment; (IV) interrupting the YAP/TEAD interaction
  by Verteporfin has been shown to reduce YAP-TEAD mediated transcriptional activity
  and inhibit cell proliferation of mesothelioma; (V) CDK9 drives transcription-elongation
  process, and has been shown to suppress YAP-TEAD mediated transcriptional activity
  in cancer cells, suggesting CDK9 can be a potential therapeutic target for mesothelioma.
