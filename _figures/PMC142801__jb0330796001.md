caption: Synthesis of purines, pantothenate, and thiamine. PurF is the first gene
  in the purine biosynthetic pathway whose end products are adenosine and guanosine.
  AIR is an intermediate in the synthesis of purine and thiamine. The APB pathway
  for synthesizing AIR feeds into the purine pathway at the formation of PRA. The
  APB pathway requires an active oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (gnd and zwf
  gene products), the PurD, PurG, and PurI proteins, and the panE gene product. The
  panE gene was previously called the apbA gene. A mutation in this gene blocks the
  APB pathway and thereby blocks the synthesis of AIR and the synthesis of thiamine.
  Also, addition of pantothenate stimulates the APB pathway in an unknown manner (question
  mark). Since growth stimulation by pantothenate requires an active pur pathway between
  PRA and AIR (data not shown), the pantothenate may feed into the purine pathway
  at the PRA step, although there may be other explanations. HMP-PP, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine
  pyrophosphate; THZ-P, thiazole monophosphate; TMP, thiamine monophosphate.
