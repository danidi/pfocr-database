caption: Proposed SA metabolic pathways enriched with the newly discovered S3H in
  Arabidopsis. The SA 3-hydroxylase (S3H) indicated in bold reported here is induced
  by accumulating SA (indicated by a black arrow) and it catalyzes the SA to form
  2,3-DHBA that will be subsequently conjugated by sugars by unknown enzymes to produce
  the storage form 2,3-DHBA sugar conjugates. The SA may also be converted to 2,5-DHBA
  (by an unknown enzyme) that is then converted to its sugar conjugates. In addition,
  SA can be catalyzed to produce its storage form salicylic sugar conjugates by enzymes
  UGT74F1 and UGT74F2. The methytransferase BSMT1 is responsible for the production
  of the functional form methylsalicylic acid from SA and methylesterases 1, 2, 4,
  7, and 9 are responsible for the reverse reaction from methylsalicylic acid to SA.
  Anabolically, two routes including the IC pathway and PAL pathway have been implicated
  in SA synthesis. In Arabidopsis the ICS pathway plays the main role and the PAL
  pathway plays a minor role, either directly or indirectly, in the production of
  SA. The ICS1 and ICS2 are responsible for converting chorismate to isochorismate.
  The enzyme from isochorimate to SA is yet to be discovered.
