caption: The sphingolipid metabolic pathway. De novo biosynthesis begins with the
  condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA and various fatty acyl-CoAs. Ceramide can
  be generated through (a) de novo biosynthesis, (b) degradation of sphingomyelin
  (SM) or glucosyl-ceramides and galactosyl-ceramides, or (c) acylation of sphingosine
  (SPH). Ceramide can be phosphorylated into ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) or hydrolyzed
  to form SPH, which is phosphorylated into sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P can
  be either dephosphorylated to form SPH or irreversibly cleaved into phosphoethanolamine
  and hexadecenal. SPT denotes serine palmitoyltransferase.
