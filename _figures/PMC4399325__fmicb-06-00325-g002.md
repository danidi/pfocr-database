caption: Schematic representation of the cell wall integrity (CWI) signaling pathway
  in A. fumigatus and colony growth of indicated deletion mutants on agar plates in
  comparison to the wild type. The picture shows those elements that were experimentally
  proven to be part of the A. fumigatus CWI pathway, plus some important elements,
  whose action was predicted based on data reported in other organisms (Fks1, Rho1,
  and PkcA). Once phosphorylated, MpkA translocates in the nucleus, where specific
  transcription factors (TFs) are activated. The deletion of genes constituting the
  central MAPK module have identical phenotypes, resulting in a compact colony and
  sensitivity to all cell wall (CW)-acting compounds (, ; ; ).
