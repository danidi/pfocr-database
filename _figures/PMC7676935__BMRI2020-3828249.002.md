caption: 'Summary of the possible signaling pathway between gut microbiota-bile acids
  axis and IBS-D. The metabolic disorder of the gut microbiota-bile acid axis could
  lead to the higher secretion levels of secondary BAs, which activate a series of
  signaling pathways in the intestinal epithelium, resulting in VH, damage of intestinal
  mucosal barrier function, increased intestinal motility, and increased intestinal
  bile acid excretion, thus promoting the occurrence of IBS-D. On the one hand, the
  reduced expression of FXR can not only upregulate the NGF/TRPV1 signaling pathway
  to cause VH but also downregulate FGF19/15 that can regulate the JNK1/2 and ERK1/2
  signaling pathway to make an inhibition on intestinal barrier function and promote
  autophagy. On the other hand, the increased secondary BAs can activate TGR5 on EC
  cells to up-regulate the expression of 5–HT and CGRP, causing increased colonic
  motility. At the same time, 5-HT could upregulate the release of 5-HT3R to cause
  VH and transmit stimulus to the spinal cord, the process of which may be involved
  in the brain-gut interaction. Abbreviations: BAs: bile acids; FXR: farnesoid X receptor;
  NGF: nerve growth factor; TRPV1: transient receptor potential vanilloid 1; VH: visceral
  hypersensitivity; FGF19/15: fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19/15; JNK: c-Jun N-terminal
