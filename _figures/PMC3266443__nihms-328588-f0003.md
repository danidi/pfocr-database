caption: (Upper part) Conventional growth factor-induced cell migration is sensitive
  to the anti-motility signal of TGFβ, which is abundantly present in wounded tissues
  or at tumor site. Unless mutations take place along the TGFβ signaling pathway,
  growth factors will not be able to be effective on the cells in vivo. (Lower part)
  eHsp90 is the first ligand-like peptide that is able to continue promoting cell
  migration in the presence of TGF-beta. The mechanism of action remains to be studied.
  This finding explains 1) why eHsp90 is more effective than growth factors in skin
  wound healing and 2) cancers without mutation in TGFβ signaling pathway progress.
