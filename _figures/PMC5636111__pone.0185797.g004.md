caption: This sub-network focuses on the module characterized by a series of receptors
  and enzymes regulating Calcium/cAMP homeostasis and involved in the non-canonical
  Ca+2/WNT signaling pathway. Among them, the most perturbed are the EGFR receptor
  and its target phospholipase PLCB3, and the routes ITPR1-CAMK2A-CALM2-PPP3CC and
  ITPR1-CAMK2A-EP300-TCF7L2. JUN is a large sink between this module and the MAPK-JNK
  one. Nodes and edges are labelled according to the conventions followed in .
