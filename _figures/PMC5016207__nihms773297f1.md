caption: Steroidogenesis in murine fetal testes. (A) A schematic drawing that illustrates
  the synthetic pathway from cholesterol to androstenedione (adione) in murine fetal
  Leydig cells (FLCs). Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) transfers cholesterol
  from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the enzyme P450 side-chain
  cleavage (P450scc) resides. Thereafter, pregnenolone (P5) is transferred to smooth
  endoplasmic reticulum, where androstenedione is synthesized. Reaction 1 mediated
  by P450scc; reaction 2, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD); and reaction 3,
  cytochrome P450 17β-hydroxylase (P450c17). (B) The synthetic pathway from androstenedione
  to testosterone (T) in murine fetal Sertoli cells. Reaction 4, mediated by 17β-hydroxysteroid
  dehydrogenase (17β-HSD). Since 17β-HSD is not expressed in mouse FLCs but fetal
  Sertoli cells (FSCs), reaction 4 takes place only in FSCs to produce T in immature
  mice. P5, pregnenolone; P4, progesterone; 17OHP4, 17β-hydroxyprogesterone; 17OHP5,
  17β-hydroxypregnenolone; adione, androstenedione; T, testosterone. GC, germ cell;
  FSC, fetal Sertoli cell; FLC, fetal Leydig cell; PMC, peritubular myoid cell; AR,
  androgen receptor; BM, basal membrane; VEC, vascular endothelial cell.
