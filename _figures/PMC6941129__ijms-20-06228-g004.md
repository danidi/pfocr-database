caption: Regulation of the G1/S transition by the Greatwall-Endosulfine-PP2A/Cdc55
  pathway in budding yeast. In early G1, Rim15 activity peaks resulting in inhibition
  of the PP2A/Cdc55 phosphatase. As a result, Sic1 is phosphorylated at Thr173 by
  Mpk1. This phosphorylation stabilizes the Sic1 protein, which interacts with Clb5/CKS/Cks1
  and inactivates the Cdk1/Clb5. This drop in phosphatase activity also helps maintaining
  Whi5 in a phosphorylated and inactive state, which allows for transcription of Cln1
  and Cln2 cyclins. As cells progress through G1, the activity of Rim15 decreases,
  and the PP2A/B55 phosphatase activity rises, causing the dephosphorylation of Sic1.
  Dephosphorylated Sic1 can then be phosphorylated first by Cln-CDK and then by Clb5,6/CDK/Cks1.
  CDK-dependent phosphorylation promotes the ubiquitylation and degradation of Sic1.
  The increase in Cln2 and Cln3 synthesis results in further Whi5 phosphorylation
  and inactivation by the CDK-Cyclin complexes, leading to the activation of the SBF
  transcription factor and START becomes irreversible.
