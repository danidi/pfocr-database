caption: 'An integrated picture for gene network of interactions between soybean and
  race1 of Phytophthora sojae. A: Incompatible interaction. B: Compatible interaction.
  Red = up-regulation of a pathway. Purple = down-regulation of a pathway. Grey = no
  significant change in pathway. Yellow = up-regulation of genes. Blue = down-regulation
  of genes. Dotted lines indicate interactions of pathways inferred from Arabidopsis
  studies.'
