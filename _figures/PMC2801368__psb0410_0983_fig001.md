caption: A model on sugar sensing and signaling from extra- to intra-cellular compartments
  mediated by cell wall invertase, its inhibitor and G-proteins. Glucose generated
  by interaction between invertase and its inhibitor in apoplasm may be sensed by
  AtRGS1. The GTP-bound active form of Gα can transmit glucose signal into the cytoplasm
  via direct interaction with AtRGS1 and THF1, and induce sugar responses. The active
  form of Gα can also regulate chloroplast development and photosynthesis in a THF1-independent
  pathway via controlling nuclear gene expression. A Golgi-localized hexose transporter
  (SGB1) has been genetically identified to mediate Gβγ signaling. CW; cell wall.
  PM; plasma membrane. N; nucleus.
