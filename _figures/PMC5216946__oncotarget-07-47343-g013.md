caption: Following interaction with the ovarian tumor environment, circulating tumor
  cells acquire a p53 Mutation. Mutant p53 binds and activates transcription factors
  such as NF-Y and SREBP2 which bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE) in the
  HMGCR promoter. Along with specificity protein 1 (SP1), NF-Y and SREBP2 increase
  transcription of HMGCR, which upregulates the Mevalonate pathway. Increased Mevalonate
  stimulates the formation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). IPP can then lead to
  the formation of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). FPP
  can lead to synthesis of cholesterol through squalene and can also lead to prenylation
  of RAS. Our data suggest that cholesterol is not involved in the reprogramming of
  metastatic ascites cells. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) is responsible for
  prenylation of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins and subsequent activation
  of Hippo pathway proteins YAP and TAZ. Statin treatment blocks the enzyme HMG-CoA
  reductase (HMGCR) and its ability to produce mevalonate, effectively inhibit downstream
  process of this pathway.
