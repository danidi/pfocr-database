caption: The speculative mechanism involved in the detrimental effect induced by the
  CX3CL1/CX3CR1-mediated microglial activation in the brain of ischemic mice. Ischemia
  (bilateral common carotid artery stenosis, BCAS) might stimulate neurons to express
  and release CX3CL1 and microglia to express CX3CR1 and hence increase the interactions
  of CX3CL1 with CX3CR1. This, in turn, activates microglia p38MAPK/PKC signaling
  pathway and then increase TNF-α and IL-1β production in microglial cells in ischemic
  mice. The increased harmful cytokines, in the end, led to a detrimental effect in
  the brain of ischemic mice, and also promote further increase in CX3CL1 expression
  and induce a progressive cell damage and death in the brain.
