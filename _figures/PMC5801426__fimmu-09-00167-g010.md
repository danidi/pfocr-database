caption: Scheme summarizing the IFN-τ promoted the MHC class I (MHC-I) expression,
  and then alleviated the inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced
  bovine endometrial epithelial cells. The mechanism was that bta-miR-148b/152 could
  promote TLR4-triggered inflammatory responses by targeting bovine MHC-I heavy chain,
  and the MHC-I molecule negatively regulated TLR4-induced inflammatory reactions
  may through the Fps-SHP-2 pathway.
