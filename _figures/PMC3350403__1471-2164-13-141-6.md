caption: Overview of prominent metabolic and medically relevant features of C. resistens
  DSM 45100 deduced from the complete genome sequence. Metabolic features associated
  with carbohydrate metabolism, histidine utilization, sulfate reduction, fatty acid
  metabolism, mycolic acid biosynthesis, and pilus formation are shown. Relevant proteins
  assigned to these processes are labeled by yellow boxes; relevant transport systems
  are shown as blue circles. The predicted virulence factors are probably secreted
  by the machinery of the general secretory pathway (Sec system). The role of the
  predicted virulence factors in ensuring the availability of exogenous fatty acids
  for growth of C. resistens is remarkable. The presence of pJA144188 in C. resistens
  DSM 45100 is indicated and the encoded antibiotic resistance proteins are listed.
  The role of the Tet(W) protein in ribosomal protection of C. resistens DSM 45100
  is highlighted, as it is most likely responsible for the clinically relevant resistance
  to minocycline.
