caption: Effects of CoV-mediated complement activation and potential site of therapeutic
  inhibition. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to activate the complement pathway.
  Complement activation can occur through three distinct pathways (classical, MBL,
  and alternative) that converge at the C3 component. C3 can be converted into C3a
  and C3b. C3b mediates pathogen opsonization and activates the conversion of C5 into
  C5a and C5b. C5b mediates the formation of the membrane attack complex, which leads
  to cell lysis. C3a and C5a are known pro-inflammatory molecules that promote immune
  cell recruitment to the site of infection. Complement response to CoV is largely
  unclear, as it may be protective or pathogenic. Recent evidence suggests that eculizumab,
  a monoclonal antibody against C5, can be utilized to inhibit complement in response
  to CoV in order to reduce potential tissue damage and prevent disease exacerbation
