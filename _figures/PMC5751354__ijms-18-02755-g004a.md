caption: Mechanisms influencing the mitochondrial metabolism and the Warburg effect.
  (A) Environmentally driven metabolic “choice”. In cells proliferating under hypoxic
  pressure with activated HIF-1, the electron transport chain is inhibited because
  of the lack of oxygen as electron acceptor. HIF-1-induced inactivation of PDH-1
  helps ensure that glucose is diverted away from mitochondrial acetyl-CoA-mediated
  citrate production. The alternative pathway for maintaining citrate synthesis involves
  reductive carboxylation, thought to rely on a reverse flux of glutamine-derived
  α-ketogluturate via isocytrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2). The reverse flux in mitochondria
  can be maintained by NADH conversion to NADPH by the mitochondrial transhydrogenase,
  with the resulting NADPH driving α-ketoglutarate carboxylation. Citrate/isocitrate
  exported to the cytosol may be metabolized oxidatively by isocytrate dehydrogenase-1
  (IDH1), and contributes to the production of cytosolic NADPH. (B) Mutational events
  that “chain” cells to particular metabolic pathways. Oncogenic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations
  can cause gain of function in cancer cells. Somatic mutation at a crucial arginine
  residue in cytoplasmic IDH1 or mitochondrial IDH2 are frequent early mutations in
  glioma and acute myeloid leukaemia which cause an unusual gain of novel enzymatic
  activity. Instead of isocitrate being converted to α-ketoglutarate, with production
  of NADPH, α-ketoglutarate is metabolised to 2-hydroxyglutarate with the consumption
  of NADPH. 2-hydroxyglutarate can compete for α-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes including
  histone demethylases and DNA hydroxylases, thereby altering both metabolism and
  epigenetic phenotypes. (C) “Chance” deterioration events in ageing. SIRT3 regulates
  multiple pathways involved in energy and ROS production. Some mitochondrial metabolic
  processes activated by SIRT3 include acetate metabolism-mediated direct deacetylation
  of acetyl-CoA synthetase (AceCS2), the TCA cycle via direct deacetylation of SDH,
  and ROS production induced by direct acetylation of the respiratory chain complexes
  I, II and III. Thin solid black arrow, alternative reductive carboxylation pathway;
