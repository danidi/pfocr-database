caption: Modified chlorambucil (Chb‐M') as a safe lead compound of novel anticancer
  drug therapy. Chb‐M' targets the consensus Runt (Runt domain)‐related transcription
  factor (RUNX)‐binding sequences on the genome DNA and achieves “cluster regulation
  of RUNX,” which offers efficient antitumor activity through potentiating the pro‐apoptotic
  p53‐mediated cell death pathway. CBFβ, core‐binding factor β. Modified from Morita
  K, Suzuki K, Maeda S, et al. Genetic regulation of the RUNX transcription factor
  family has antitumor effects. J Clin Invest. 2017;127:2815–2828, by permission of
