caption: The altered metabolic pathways in the CPP group as compared with the control
  group. ↑ represents significantly elevated concentration of metabolites in the CPP
  group, whereas ↓ represents significantly lowered concentration of metabolites in
  the CPP group as compared with the control group. A, catecholamine metabolic pathway.
  B, tryptophan metabolic pathway. C, TCA cycle.
