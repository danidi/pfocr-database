caption: Asbestos causes necrotic cell death in HM, which leads to the release of
  HMGB1 into the extra cellular space. HMGB1 release causes macrophages accumulation,
  inflammatory response, and especially the secretion of TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha activates
  NF-kB pathway, which increases HM survival after asbestos exposure. This allows
  HM with asbestos-induced DNA damage to divide rather than die and, if key genetic
  alterations accumulate, to eventually develop into MM.
