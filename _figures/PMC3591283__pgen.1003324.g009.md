caption: A. DAF-19 is engaged in multiple independent signaling pathways that regulate
  tph-1 expression in ADF neurons. Based on the genetic interaction of DAF-19 and
  ATF-7 in the TIR-1 signaling pathway, we speculate that DAF-19 interacts with different
  cofactors at different cis-elements of the tph-1 promoter in response to different
  environmental cues. DAF-19 may simultaneously interact with multiple cofactors to
  confer additive upregulation of tph-1 in response to multiple aversive cues. B.
  DAF-19 regulates TIR-1 targets in response to pathogenic bacterial infection, but
  is not required for TIR-1 to regulate AWC neuron development. However, pathogenic
  bacterial infection may trigger the TIR-1-DAF-19/ATF-7 pathway via cell-specific
  mechanisms.
