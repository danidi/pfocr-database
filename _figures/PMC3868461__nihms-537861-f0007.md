caption: 'Scheme of metabolic pathways in BSF (a) and PCF (b) trypanosomes. Arrows
  indicate steps of glucose, proline, and threonine metabolism and glycerolipid biosynthesis;
  dashed arrows indicate steps for which no evidence of flux is available . Abbreviations:
  A, ATPase (a) or ATP synthase (b); AcCoA, acetyl-CoA; Cit, citrate, CoASH, coenzyme
  A; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; FAS II, type II fatty acid biosynthesis pathway;
  GAP, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; GPDH, glycerol 3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase; KG, 2-ketoglutarate; Mal, malate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Pyr,
  pyruvate; Resp. Ch., respiratory chain; TCA, tricarboxylic acid cycle; UQ, ubiquinone.
  Enzymes are: 1, pyruvate dehydrogenase; 2, acetyl-CoA thioesterase; 3, acetate:succinate
  CoA-transferase; 4, succinyl-CoA synthetase; 5, F0F1-ATP synthase; 6, acetyl-CoA
  synthetase; TAO, trypanosome alternative oxidase; 7, threonine dehydrogenase; 8,
  proline dehydrogenase. Activities potentially stimulated by Ca2+ are indicated.'
