caption: Proposed model for the molecular mechanism of SlMIXTA‐like mediated primary
  metabolic regulation in tomato. SlMIXTA‐like directly binds to proSlDAHPS to induce
  its expression. Enhanced DAHPS activities direct carbon flux towards shikimate pathway
  and downstream phenylpropanoid pathway.
