caption: Proposed biosynthetic pathway for mycobacterial LM/LAM. AcPIM4 is proposed
  as the branch point on the pathways leading to AcPIM6, LM, and LAM. Normally it
  is thought that linear mannan backbone (pathway B) is substituted at C-2 by Manp
  residues (dotted arrow) to form the native branched LM, which is subsequently arabinosylated
  to form mature LAM. However, in the absence of the α(1→2) branching enzyme, MSMEG4250,
  linear mannan formed from pathway A or B can be directly arabinosylated to form
  mutLAM.
