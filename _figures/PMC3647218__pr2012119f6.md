caption: Model for an inflammatory and hypoxic microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1
  (mPGES-1)-mediated pathway to respiratory depression and autoresuscitation failure.
  During a systemic immune response, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
  is released into the peripheral bloodstream. It binds to its receptor (IL-1R) located
  on endothelial cells of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Activation of IL-1R induces
  the synthesis of PGH2 from arachidonic acid (AA) via COX-2 and the synthesis of
  prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from PGH2 via the rate-limiting enzyme mPGES-1. Moreover,
  hypoxia in itself activates mPGES-1 and the activation is additive to that of IL-1R.
  PGE2 is released into the brain parenchyma and binds to its EP3R located in the
  respiratory control regions of the brainstem, e.g., nucleus of tractus solitarius
  (NTS) and the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). This results in depression of
  central respiration-related neurons and breathing, which may fatally decrease the
  ability to gasp and autoresuscitate during hypoxic events.
