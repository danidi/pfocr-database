caption: The glycolysis gene Gpi1 is required for homeostatic TH17 cells in normal
  tissue whereby high oxygen levels allow pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and OXPHOS
  to compensate for the loss of Gpi1. In hypoxic inflamed tissue, the loss of OXPHOS
  occurs, thus making Gpi1 essential for the survival of pathogenic TH17 cells. Hence,
  metabolic redundancy varies according to the microenvironment, and Gpi1 may be a
  therapeutic target in certain settings
