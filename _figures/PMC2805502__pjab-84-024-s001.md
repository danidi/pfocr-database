caption: Working hypothetical metabolic fate of glycolytic (glucose) and gluconeogenic
  (glutamine) substrates on biosynthesis of renal tubular sulfolipids. Cer-h, ceramide
  with hydroxy fatty acids; GalCer-h, galactosylceramide with hydroxy fatty acids;
  Glc, glucose; Glc 1-p, glucose 1-phosphate; Glc 6-p, glucose 6-phosphate; Gln, glutamine.
  Symbol, ⊗, with dashed arrows indicates comparatively inactive pathway in the isolated
  renal proximal tubules from well-fed rat. Sulfated lipids are indicated by hatching.
