caption: 'Role of integrins in tumor cell proliferation. (1) The crosstalk between
  integrins and growth factor receptors (summarized in ) promotes cancer cell proliferation.
  For instance, in ovarian cancer cells c-Met is activated via phosphorylation upon
  binding of α5β1 to fibronectin []. This activation leads to activation of Src and
  FAK and promotes proliferation and invasion []; (2) Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)
  leads to an increased expression of integrins such as α2β1 and αvβ3 [,]; (3) The
  oncogene MYC (v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) can bind to promoter
  elements of α1β1 and leads to enhanced transcription of this integrin []; (4) Integrins
  can interact with transmembrane receptors such as CD98hc. CD98hc modulates integrin
  signaling by o conferring integrins with “stiffness” that allows them to trigger
  their signaling pathway []. (Of note, the DNA cartoon was designed by Freepik).
