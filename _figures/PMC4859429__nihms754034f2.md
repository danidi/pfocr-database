caption: '(A) Schematic of androgen synthesis and pre-receptor control of DHT metabolism
  in normal prostate tissue. (B) Differential changes in steroidogenic enzymes in
  primary prostate cancer vs normal prostate tissue: increased tumor expression of
  reductive enzymes HSD17B3 and AKR1C3 and decreased expression of the oxidative enzyme
  HSD17B2, favoring production of active androgens from inactive diones; a decrease
  in tumoral SRD5A2 and increase in SRD5A1; decreased expression of both AKR1C2 and
  AKR1C1 with increased expression of HSD17B10, favoring production of DHT. Expression
  of HSD17B6 is low in untreated primary PCa, but increased in men treated with androgen
  deprivation (upward arrow with*). (C) Altered expression of genes mediating DHT
  production and catabolism in CRPC: variably increased expression of STAR, CYP17A
  and HSD3β2, involved in de novo steroid synthesis; consistently increased expression
  of AKR1C3 and SRD5A1, mediating conversion of adrenal androgens to downstream steroids;
  paradoxical increase in expression of genes involved in DHT catabolism including
  AKR1C1, AKR1C2, UGT2B15 and 17; increased expression of HSD17B10 in conjunction
  with increased AKR1C2, suggesting activity via a testosterone bypass pathway (thick
  arrows) with steroid flux directed to DHT via androstanedione, androsterone and
  3α-diol. (↑ denote increased gene expression and ↓ denote decreased gene expression)'
