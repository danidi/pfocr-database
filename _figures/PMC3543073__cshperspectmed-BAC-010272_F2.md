caption: Three examples of chromatin-modifying complexes and their mode of action.
  (A) The nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase NuRD (or Mi-2) complex contains
  different subunits involved in nucleosome remodeling (CHD3/CHD4), histone deacetylation
  (HDAC1/HDAC2), histone demethylation (LSD1), and binding to transcription factors
  and histones. Additionally, MBD2 recruits NuRD to methylated DNA, whereas MBD3 (whose
  MBD region is mutated and does not bind methylated DNA) interacts with transcription
  factors. The function and targeting of the complex to specific loci depends on the
  combinatorial assembly of the different subunit isoforms. Most often, recruitment
  of the NuRD complex by a tissue-specific transcription factor to gene promoters
  mediates transcriptional repression. In the case of the transcription factor c-Jun
  of the AP1 family, recent studies suggest that its recruitment to the NuRD complex
  involves MBD3 interaction with unphosphorylated c-Jun. On activation of the JNK
  pathway, c-Jun phosphorylation mediates MBD3/c-Jun dissociation, resulting in derepression
  of transcription of target genes (e.g., cell-cycle and cell-differentiation genes)
  (). Abbreviations are listed in . (B) Mammalian PcG proteins form two multiprotein
  complexes, polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2). PRC2 contains
  a histone-methyltransferase subunit (EZH2, not shown) that generates H3K27me3. PRC1
  binds H3K27me3 and catalyzes ubiquitinylation of H2AK119. An early event in chromosome
  X inactivation in mammalian females is the recruitment of PRC2 by the XIST long
  coding RNA, inducing H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub along the inactive X chromosome. PRC2
  has the ability to recruit DNMTs to some of its target genes, thereby stimulating
  de novo DNA methylation. (C) The BAHD1-associated chromatin-silencing complex has
  been discovered by the study of the bacterial protein LntA from L. monocytogenes.
  Two-hybrid screen, coimmunoprecipitation, and colocalization experiments (), as
  well as tandem-affinity purification (), identified components associated to BAHD1,
  i.e., HP1, MBD1, KAP1, histone methyltransferase (SETDB1), and deacetylases (HDAC1/2).
  Our data suggest that BAHD1 acts as a silencer by tethering chromatin regulators
  and modifying enzymes to sequence-specific transcription factors (TF), enabling
  local chromatin compaction. BAHD1-associated heterochromatin sites are enriched
  in H3K27me3, but the relationship with PRC2 is unknown. Like for NuRD, the function
  and targeting of the BAHD1 complex to specific genes likely depend on the combinatorial
  assembly of the different subunits, in response to signals to which cells are submitted.
  On Listeria infection, the BAHD1 complex assembles at promoters of a set of interferon-stimulated
  genes (ISGs), as shown in .
