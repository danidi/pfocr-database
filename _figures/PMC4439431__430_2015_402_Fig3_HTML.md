caption: Metabolism of a macrophage activated by immune signals. Upon activation of
  TLRs, the cell releases downstream IFN and at the same time, TBK1-IKKε kinases are
  activated leading to iNOS, Akt and NF-KB activation. This leads to increased glycolysis
  through activation of HK-II. NO production is also up-regulated from iNOS and blocks
  generation of ATP by mitochondria, and this also leads in up-regulation of glycolysis
  in order to produce ATP from pyruvate fermentation. Part of the pyruvate produced
  by glycolysis is imported to mitochondria where it gets converted to citrate and
  shuttled to the cytosol and used for fatty acids synthesis required by the cell
  for its activation. At the same time due to direct signalling by IFN, the mevalonate–sterol
  pathway is down-regulated. In the arachidonic pathway, COX2 is activated by NF-KB
  and prostanoids produced by are used as signals in an autocrine and paracrine way
  to regulate the immune response. Repression arrows indicate specific drug inhibitors.
  The key differences to note in comparison Fig.  are TLR activation alone involving
  HK-II activation by Akt and that TLR agonist is the activator and not virus. TLR
  Toll-like receptor, IFN interferon, GLUT glucose transporter, TCA cycle tricarboxylic
  acid cycle, HK-II hexokinase-II, Akt protein kinase B, NO nitric oxide, NSAIDS non-steroidal
