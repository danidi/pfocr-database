caption: 'Involvement of IAP proteins and IAP antagonists in the apoptosis and NF-κB
  pathways [, ]. a) Role of IAPs in the apoptosis pathway: IAPs negatively regulate
  both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Certain chemotherapeutic agents activate
  intrinsic apoptosis through activation of Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins,
  which leads to the release of cytochrome C and Smac from mitochondria and the activation
  caspase-9 and caspase-3/7. Activation of death receptors such as DR5 or Fas causes
  receptor trimerization and recruits Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD),
  triggering the caspase-8-mediated extrinsic pathway. Extrinsic death signals can
  crosstalk with the intrinsic pathway through truncated BID (tBID). XIAP negatively
  regulates both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways by inhibiting both caspases-3 and
  -9. Smac promotes apoptosis by binding XIAP. Melanoma IAP (ML-IAP) blocks apoptosis
  by depleting Smac from XIAP. IAPs are also involved in the regulation of NF-κB pathway.
  Activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR-1) induces the formation of
  complex 1, consisting of TNFR-associated via death domain (TRADD), receptor-interacting
  serine/threonine-protein kinase 1(RIPK1), TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and cIAP1/2.
  cIAPs ubiquitinate but do not degrade RIPK1, which leads to the ubiquitination and
  proteasomal degradation of Inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) and the translocation of p50
  and the transcription factor RELA (p65) to the nucleus. Thus, cIAPs positively regulate
  the TNF-α-mediated activation of canonical NF-κB. In the non-canonical NF-κB pathway,
  cIAPs cause ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NF-κB-inducing kinase
  (NIK) and inhibit the non-canonical NF-kB signaling. b) Birinapant (BNT), as an
  IAP antagonist, binds to the BIR3 domains of cIAP1/2 and causes auto-ubiquitination
  and proteasomal degradation of the cIAPs. NIK is stabilized and non-canonical NF-κB
  signaling is activated. Loss of TRAF2-bound cIAP1/2 causes subsequent inhibition
  of canonical NF-κB activation, as well as formation of complex II (RIPK1, FADD,
  caspase-8 complex) and induction caspase-8-mediated apoptosis. Birinapant also releases
  activated caspases from XIAP and ML-IAP sequestration and induces both intrinsic
  and extrinsic apoptosis pathways.'
