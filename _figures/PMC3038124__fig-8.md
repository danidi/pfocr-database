caption: ROS-FOXO pathway as a regulator of aging and age-related diseases. In response
  to oxidative stress, FOXO transcription factors were implicated in regulating aging
  and contributing to multiple age-related diseases. One potential mechanism of how
  FOXOs impact these processes is by increasing the antioxidant capacity of cells
  or inducing cell death.
