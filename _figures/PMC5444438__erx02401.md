caption: Phenylalanine synthesis, arogenate dehydratases, and stromules. (A) Phenylalanine
  can be synthesized in plants using either the prephenate (top) or the arogenate
  (bottom) pathway (; ). Prephenate is either decarboxylated/dehydrated to phenylpyruvate
  (PP) by a prephenate dehydratase (PDT) and PP is then transaminated by a phenylpyruvate
  aminotransferase (PPAT) to phenylalanine. Alternatively the two enzymatic steps
  are reversed, whereby prephenate is transaminated to arogenate by a prephenate aminotransferase
  (PAT) and arogenate is then decarboxylated/dehydrated to phenylalanine by an arogenate
  dehydratase (ADT). (B) A. thaliana ADT constructs were cloned in different lengths.
  The full-length (F) sequence represents the entire ADT ORF while an N-terminal construct
  only includes the transit peptide (TP). (C) Schematic diagram of a chloroplast showing
  the formation of stromules. Stromules are stroma-filled protrusions of the outer
  and inner membrane from chloroplasts. They can differ in length, forming long thread-like
  extensions or globular structures.
