caption: Molecular interactions during pheromone induced cell polarization. (A) Polarized
  growth is initiated toward the activated pheromone receptor through a complex signaling
  network. Cdc24 accumulates in the region of activated pheromone receptor (Gβγ) through
  interactions with the adaptor protein, Far1. The scaffold protein of the MAPK pathway,
  Ste5, binds both to Gβγ and Bem1, whereas Bem1 binds to Far1, further linking Cdc24
  and Cdc42 to this site. Activation of Ste20, an upstream member of the MAPK pathway,
  is dependent on Cdc42, ensuring that MAPK activation and accumulation of Cdc42 occur
  at the same location. Activation of the kinase Fus3 plays a role in formin activation,
  which leads to an increase in nucleation of actin cables and possibly increased
  local transport of pheromone receptor and growth machinery. (B) Far1 plays a key
  role in determining if Cdc24 will localize to the presumptive bud site or the site
  of accumulated pheromone receptor. In cells undergoing pheromone response, a Far1-Cdc24
  complex is exported from the nucleus. In the cytosol, Far1 plays a role in inhibition
  of CDK1, contributing to cell cycle arrest, whereas the Far1-Cdc24 complex localizes
  to the site of accumulation of pheromone receptor. In budding cells, Cdc24 is exported
  from the nucleus while Far1 undergoes proteolysis triggered by CDK1 phosphorylation.
  Cdc24 then reaches the plasma membrane likely because of interactions with Rsr1
  and/or Bem1.
