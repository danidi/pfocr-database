caption: Rho1 regulators and effectors. Rho1 localization and activity are regulated
  through the cell cycle and in response to cell wall stress by cell-surface sensors,
  a family of GEFs (Rom1, Rom2, and Tus1), and a set of GAPs (Bem2, Sac7, Lrg1, and
  Bag7). Six known Rho1 effectors control cell wall biogenesis through polymer synthesis,
  polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, directed secretion, and transcription.
