caption: The conversion of glucose into TGs is nutritionally regulated, and both insulin
  and glucose signaling pathways are activated in response to dietary carbohydrates
  to synergistically induce gene expression. The transcription factor SREBP-1c mediates
  the effect of insulin on GK, ACC, FAS, ELOVL6, SCD1, and GPAT. LXRs are also important
  regulators of TG synthesis, through the direct transcriptional activation of ACC,
  FAS, and SCD1 but also indirectly via the insulin-mediated transcriptional activation
  of SREBP1-c. ChREBP, which is induced by glucose, is required for the induction
  of L-PK, which is exclusively dependent on glucose. The induction of ACC, FAS, ELOVL6,
  and SCD1 genes is under the synergistic action of ChREBP and SREBP-1c in response
  to glucose and insulin, respectively. The direct effect of ChREBP on GPAT expression
  is not clearly established. ChREBP is also a direct transcriptional target of LXRs,
  and glucose was recently shown to bind and activate LXRs, thereby indicating that
  LXRs are part of the glucose signaling pathway. However, in our point of view, the
  relevance of a potential regulation by LXRs of glucose-sensitive genes needs to
  be demonstrated in a physiological context. The transcriptional regulation of DGAT
  in liver is, to our knowledge, still largely unknown.
