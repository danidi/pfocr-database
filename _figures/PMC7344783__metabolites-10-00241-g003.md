caption: Metabolic pathway showing the production and itaconate via the TCA cycle
  and metabolism to pyruvate via itaconyl-CoA and citramalyl-CoA. Cis-aconitate is
  produced from citrate and isocitrate by aconitase (AC). This is converted to itaconate
  by cis-aconitate decarboxylase (cADC) which is then converted to itaconyl-CoA via
  succinate thiokinase (STK). Itaconyl-CoA is converted to citramalyl-CoA by methylglutaconyl-CoA
  hydratase (MGTK) which is then converted to pyruvate and acetyl CoA [].
