caption: The possible feedback loop between PTX3 and TNF-α via NF-κB signaling pathway
  in inflammation. In the progression of inflammation, including RA, the pro-inflammatory
  cytokine TNF-α mainly binds to TNFR1 that activates NF-κB signaling. The major step
  is the translocation of the dimer (p50 and p65) into nucleus once IκB-α is inactivated
  and degraded. The transduction of downstream genes mediated by TNF-α involves abundant
  inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β and IL-6) and chemokines (e.g. MCP-1 and CXCL-1).
  Also, the production of biomarker PTX3 is stimulated by TNF-α. However, whether
  the interaction between PTX3 and TNF-α exists remains unveiled. The TNF-α/TNFR/NF-κB/PTX3
  axis may contribute to a feedback loop co-regulating inflammation.
