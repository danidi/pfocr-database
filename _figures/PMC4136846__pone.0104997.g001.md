caption: '(A) The classic model of starch biosynthesis according to which (a) the
  starch biosynthetic process takes place exclusively in the chloroplast, segregated
  from the sucrose biosynthetic process taking place in the cytosol, and (b) AGP exclusively
  catalyzes the synthesis of ADPG. (B) Suggested “additional/alternative” model of
  starch biosynthesis wherein (a) ADPG is produced in the cytosol by enzyme(s) such
  as SuSy and then is transported to the chloroplast by the action of an ADPG translocator,
  and (b) pPGM and AGP play an important role in the scavenging of glucose units derived
  from starch breakdown. Starch to glucose conversion would involve the coordinated
  actions of amylases, isoamylase and disproportionating enzyme –. According to this
  interpretation of transitory starch biosynthesis starch accumulation in leaves is
  the result of the balance between de novo starch synthesis from ADPG entering the
  chloroplast and breakdown, and the efficiency by which starch breakdown products
  are recycled back to starch by means of pPGM and AGP. Thus, this view predicts that
  the recovery towards starch biosynthesis of the glucose units derived from the starch
  breakdown will be deficient in pPGM and AGP mutants, resulting in a parallel decline
  of starch accumulation and enhancement of soluble sugars content since starch breakdown
  derived products (especially glucose) will leak out the chloroplast through the
  very active glucose translocator . The enzyme activities involved are numbered as
  follows: 1, 1′, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase; 2, 2′, fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase;
  3, PPi:fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase; 4, 4′, PGI; 5, 5′, PGM; 6, UDPG
  pyrophosphorylase; 7, sucrose phosphate synthase; 8, sucrose-phosphate-phosphatase;
  9, AGP; 10, SS; 11, starch phosphorylase; 12, SuSy; 13, plastidial hexokinase ,
  . FBP: fructose bis-phosphate; UDPG: UDP-glucose.'
