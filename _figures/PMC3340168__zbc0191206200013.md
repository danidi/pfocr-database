caption: Apoptotic and necrotic targets modulate viability of epithelial responder
  cells by eliciting multiple recognition-dependent signaling pathways. The recognition
  of dead cells, either apoptotic (A) or necrotic (B), by non-professional phagocytes
  such as kidney PTECs is coupled with multiple signaling events that modulate cell
  viability. Alterations in responder cell viability occur through synergistic changes
  in proliferation and survival. Apoptotic and necrotic targets produce opposite effects
  on PTEC viability. Apoptotic targets decrease responder cell viability through a
  combination of decreased proliferation and increased apoptotic death. In contrast,
  necrotic targets increase viability by increasing proliferation and decreasing responder
  cell death. These recognition-dependent responses to apoptotic and necrotic targets
  are elicited by directionally opposite responses in the activity of multiple pathways
  and signaling elements, including β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity and
  activity of the kinases Akt, GSK3β, ERK1/2, and p38. Pathways and signaling elements
  can be grouped into those that are Akt-dependent (within the keystone outline) and
  those that are Akt-independent (outside the keystone). For example, in response
  to apoptotic targets, proapoptotic effects include decreased inhibition of Bad (Akt-dependent)
  and increased activity of caspase-8 (Akt-independent), whereas antiproliferative
  effects include decreased abundance of cyclin D1 (Akt-dependent) and decreased activity
  of ERK1/2 (Akt-independent). Arrowheads beside the boxed signaling element indicate
  the overall effect of the target on the activity of the signaling element irrespective
  of phosphorylation status. The arrow connecting p38 and GSK3β for apoptotic targets
  (A) is dashed to indicate that this pathway is counter-regulatory and opposes the
  proapoptotic effects of Akt inhibition. The effect of Akt inhibition predominates
  over that of p38 activation with respect to GSK3β activity. lef, lymphoid enhancer
  factor.

  description: Apoptotic and necrotic targets modulate viability of epithelial responder
    cells by eliciting multiple recognition-dependent signaling pathways. The recognition
    of dead cells, either apoptotic (A) or necrotic (B), by non-professional phagocytes
    such as kidney PTECs is coupled with multiple signaling events that modulate cell
    viability. Alterations in responder cell viability occur through synergistic changes
    in proliferation and survival. Apoptotic and necrotic targets produce opposite
    effects on PTEC viability. Apoptotic targets decrease responder cell viability
    through a combination of decreased proliferation and increased apoptotic death.
    In contrast, necrotic targets increase viability by increasing proliferation and
    decreasing responder cell death. These recognition-dependent responses to apoptotic
    and necrotic targets are elicited by directionally opposite responses in the activity
    of multiple pathways and signaling elements, including β-catenin-dependent transcriptional
    activity and activity of the kinases Akt, GSK3β, ERK1/2, and p38. Pathways and
    signaling elements can be grouped into those that are Akt-dependent (within the
    keystone outline) and those that are Akt-independent (outside the keystone). For
    example, in response to apoptotic targets, proapoptotic effects include decreased
    inhibition of Bad (Akt-dependent) and increased activity of caspase-8 (Akt-independent),
    whereas antiproliferative effects include decreased abundance of cyclin D1 (Akt-dependent)

    the signaling element irrespective of phosphorylation status. The arrow connecting
    p38 and GSK3β for apoptotic targets (A) is dashed to indicate that this pathway
    is counter-regulatory and opposes the proapoptotic effects of Akt inhibition.
    The effect of Akt inhibition predominates over that of p38 activation with respect
    to GSK3β activity. lef, lymphoid enhancer factor.
