caption: Reduced activity of the pentose phosphate pathway enzyme transaldolase has
  several consequences, including inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, induction
  of a mitochondrial stress response, alterations in redox homeostasis, and activation
  of a starvation-like metabolic response. Lifespan extension in response to transaldolase
  deficiency appears to be mediated by both MAPK signaling and HLH-30 mediated induction
  of autophagy and activation of FMO-2.
