caption: Schematic diagram illustrating inhibition of HMGB1-TLR4 signaling pathway
  by dexamethasone in renal ischemia reperfusion injury. HMGB1 was shown to passively
  release from damaged or necrotic cells and bind to TLR4 on inflammation cells during
  renal ischemia reperfusion injury. Activation of TLR4 by HMGB1 causes EKR and IκBα
  phosphorylation and interaction with NF-κB p65 subunit, promoting p65 acetylation
  and translocation to the nucleus. Activated p65 in nucleus binds with DNA and leads
  to HMGB1 acetylation and active release out of inflammation cells together with
  other inflammatory factors, for instance, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. Released inflammatory
  factors bind to their receptors on renal tubular cells. This ligand-receptor interaction
  forms an inflammatory cascade vicious circle and lead to further damage. It is possible
  that administration with dexamethasone activates glucocorticoid receptor, which
  then inhibits ERK and IκBα phosphorylation and decreases p65 acetylation, thereby
  inhibits HMGB1-TLR4 pathway during kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury. Dex, dexamethasone;
  GR, glucocorticoid receptor; R, receptor; Circled plus denotes possible role in
  activating the kinase cascade; Circled minus denotes suppression of the possible
  kinase cascade; Circled P denotes phosphorylation; Squared Ace denotes acetylation.
