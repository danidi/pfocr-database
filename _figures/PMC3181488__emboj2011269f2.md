caption: The signal-receiving cell—modulation of developmental signalling by intracellular
  trafficking. The ER serves as the compartment for folding of the Wnt LRP5/6 receptor
  by Boca, and modification and folding of Notch by Ofut1 and Ero1. Lateral trafficking
  of Smo to the cilium upon activation by Hh facilitates activation of the intracellular
  signalling pathway. Recruitment to the early endosome of receptor tyrosine kinases
  including FGFR, PVR and EGFR by Cbl can serve to attenuate or facilitate their signalling
  and redistribution. An endosomal compartment that contains Tkv, Notch and Sara,
  controls their distribution between daughter cells upon cell division. FGFR is trafficked
  from endosomes to the plasma membrane by the kinesin motor KIF16B. The endosome
  is also the compartment where productive cleavage of Notch by γ secretase takes
  place, to trigger signalling. The late endosome/MVB provides a site to trap GSK3,
  thus modulating Wnt signalling. Trafficking from the late endosome/MVB to the lysosome
  for degradation serves as a critical point of control, where trafficking of FGFR
  is facilitated by Cbl, and trafficking of Notch and Fz is facilitated by Phyl.
