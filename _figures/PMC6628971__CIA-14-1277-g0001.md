caption: 'Molecular mechanisms of the cGAS/STING pathway as a senescence-associated
  DNA damage sensor and inflammation trigger. DNA is exposed to both exogenous and
  endogenous harmful factors, such as chemicals, radiation and different kinds of
  metabolic products. DNA damage includes nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
  damage. The cGAS/STING pathway is a cytoplasmic DNA sensor, and activation of the
  cGAS/STING pathway leads to two independent downstream pathways: type I IFNs through
  IRF3 and proinflammatory responses through NFκB16. Both the IRF3- and NF-κB-dependent
  pathways lead to the production of inflammatory growth factors and cytokines, leading
  to SASP.Abbreviations: SASP, senescence-associated secretory phenotype; RPE, retinal
  pigmented epithelium; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ROS, reactive oxygen species.'
