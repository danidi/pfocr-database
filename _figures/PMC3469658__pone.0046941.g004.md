caption: The merged network was generated from the list of transcripts differentially
  expressed in 4 week-old NOD mice compared to both control strains, NON and C57BL/6.
  The list was selected from a hierarchical cluster of 189 genes that had highly significant
  expression differences between strains at 4 weeks. The genes derived from our uploaded
  gene list (focus genes) are represented by gray icons. White icons represent genes
  (or endogenous chemicals) derived solely from the IPA knowledge base and that could
  be algorithmically connected to the focus genes.
