caption: ICAM-1-targeted nano- and micro-carriers are both efficiently internalized
  by cells due to sphingomyelinase (SMase)-dependent generation of ceramide at carrier-binding
  sites on the plasmalemma, which is associated with CAM-mediated endocytosis (left
  panel). Ceramide improves carrier engulfment and membrane invagination, and acts
  as a second messenger toward actin re-organization, helping in endocytosis. In contrast,
  targeting drug carriers to receptors associated with more size-restrictive pathways,
  e.g., clathrin-associated M6PR, often enables intracellular transport of nano- but
  not micro-carriers (middle panel). Surface-functionalization of said carriers with
  elements mimicking the CAM-mediated pathway, namely exogenous SMases (such as NSM
  in this study), does not impact binding but supplies ceramide and actin re-organization,
  improving endocytosis of nano- and micro-carriers even when targeted to receptors
  different from ICAM-1 (right panel).
