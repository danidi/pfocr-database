caption: Summary of signaling pathways for cPLA2α activation and eicosanoid production
  stimulated by engagement of C. albicans cell wall components with receptors in resident
  peritoneal macrophages. Our results suggest that β-glucans (green) and mannans (orange)
  of the C. albicans cell wall engage Dectin-1 and -2 on mouse peritoneal macrophages
  to promote increases in [Ca2+]i and activation of MAPKs, respectively. MyD88, through
  an as yet unidentified receptor, also contributes to the early activation of MAPKs
  and phosphorylation of cPLA2α on Ser-505. Calcium binds to the N-terminal C2 domain
  on cPLA2α and promotes translocation of cPLA2α from the cytosol to intracellular
  membrane to access phospholipid substrate. Phosphorylation on Ser-505 enhances the
  release of AA by increasing the catalytic activity of cPLA2α. Dectin-1, -2, and
  MyD88 contribute to the early release of eicosanoids, but the MyD88 pathway is preferentially
  used to mediate COX2 expression and the late response of eicosanoid production in
  resident peritoneal macrophages.
