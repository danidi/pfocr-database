caption: Sesamin metabolic pathway and proposed reaction mechanism. (A) Proposed sesamin
  metabolic pathway in strain no. 22. (B) DNA sequence of region encoding SesA and
  its flanking region. The thfl gene exhibits 60% amino acid sequence identity with
  that of Mycobacterium bovis (UniProtKB accession code P0A5T7), and the thf2 gene
  exhibits 69% amino acid sequence identity with that of Clavibacter michiganensis
  (UniProtKB accession code B0RD2). (C) Proposed reaction mechanism for SesA. In C,
  “B” represents a base.
