caption: De-novo sphingolipid synthesis pathway. De-novo ceramide synthesis involves
  several steps. Serine Palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the initial conjugation
  of palmitoyl-CoA with L-serine to form 3-keto-sphinganine which is subsequently
  reduced to sphinganine (SA). SA is acetylated by ceramide synthase (CerS) and desaturated
  by ceramide desaturase (DES) to form ceramide. The degradation pathway starts with
  the deacetylation of ceramide by ceramidase. The sphingosine (SO) formed is then
  phosphorylated by SO-Kinase and finally degraded to hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine
  by the action of the sphingosine-1-phospate lyase (SO1P-lyase).
