caption: Balanced modulation of LBP-effect by LBP blockade and G-CSF pretreatment
  in sepsis. (a) on one hand, LBP promotes bacterial clearance, but on the other hand,
  it contributes to the sensitization of inflammatory response via activation of NF-κB
  signaling pathway. (b) Interfering with the LBP-mediated inflammatory response by
  LBP blockade reduces the inflammatory injury and improves outcome after septic insult.
