caption: Ubiquitin-ligase based receptors. (A) Under subthreshold auxin concentrations,
  auxin-responsive genes are repressed by Aux/IAA proteins heterodimerizing with ARF
  transcription factors. Upon an auxin stimulus, the TIR1 F-box protein subunit of
  the SCFTIR1 ubiquitin-ligase binds auxin, enabling the recruitment of Aux/IAA proteins
  to the SCF complex for ubiquitination. Subsequent Aux/IAA degradation by the 26S
  proteasome derepresses the ARF transcription factors. (B) JAZ proteins negatively
  regulate jasmonate response by repressing MYC2 transcriptional activity. Upon binding
  jasmonate, the SCFCOI1 ubiquitin-ligase targets JAZ proteins for ubiquitin-mediated
  proteolysis, derepressing MYC2. (C) DELLA proteins repress GA response by negatively
  regulating PIF3, PIF4, and presumably other transcription factors that control the
  expression of GA-inducible genes. DELLA proteins also promote the expression of
  several GA-repressible genes, several of which encode GA biosynthetic enzymes and
  components of the response pathway including the GID1 receptors. Upon binding GA,
  the GID1 receptor interacts with DELLA. The GID1-GA-DELLA complex is then recognized
  by the SCFGID2 ubiquitin-ligase, which targets DELLA for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
  The red arrows in A–C indicate the effects of the respective hormone on the Aux/IAA,
  JAZ, and DELLA repressors.
