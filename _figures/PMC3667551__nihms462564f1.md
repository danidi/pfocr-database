caption: Inositol polyphosphate biosynthetic pathway. IP3K or IPMK phosphorylates
  IP3 to generate IP4 [Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 or Ins(1,4,5,6)P4]. Further sequential phosphorylation
  of IP4 by IPMK and IP5K yields IP6 (, , , –, ). IP6Ks pyrophosphorylate the 5 position,
  generating 5-PP-IP4 from IP5, 5-PP-IP5 (5-IP7) from IP6, and 1-/3-,5-(PP)2-IP4 (1,5-IP8)
  from 1-/3-PP-IP5 (, , , ). 5-IP7 is the predominant inositol pyrophosphate in mammals.
  PP-IP5Ks, the human Vip1 isoforms, pyrophosphorylate the 1 or 3 position to yield
  1-/3-PP-IP5 (depicted as 1-IP7 for simplicity) from IP6, or 1-/3-,5-(PP)2-IP4 (1,5-IP8)
  from 5-IP7, and physiologically, they are primarily involved in generating IP8.
  DIPPs dephosphorylate inositol pyrophosphates to IP6 or IP5 (, ).
