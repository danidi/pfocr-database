caption: Schematic representation of dietary factors, one-carbon metabolism, methionine
  cycle in DNA methylation. One-carbon metabolism is the best understood pathway of
  dietary regulation of DNA methylation. Folic acid is converted to dihydroflate (DHF)
  and then to tetrahydrofolate and finally to methylene tetrahydrofolate (MTHF). 5,
  10-MTHF is required for the synthesis of nucelic acids, and 5- MTHF is required
  for the formation of methionine from homocysteine via folate- and B12-dependent
  methionine synthase reaction. Methionine adenosyl transferase transfers adenosine
  to methionine and generates S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is the main methyl
  donor. Subsequently, SAM is converted to S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), which has
  high binding affinity to methyltransferases (MTase). A dietary supply of vitamins
  B12, B6, and folic acid via several steps regenerate SAH to SAM. Methylene tetrahydrofolate
  (MTHF) can direct folic acid (FA) to nucleotide synthesis as an important path for
  DNA synthesis, cell growth, and DNA repair or for conversion of homocysteine to
  methionine. DNA-methyl transferases (MTase) methylates the CpG island which recruits
  the methyl binding domain (MBD) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the methylated
  DNA and leads to histone deacetylation, condensation of chromatin, loss of transcription
  factor binding, and silencing of the gene expression in cancer and other premalignant
  conditions.
