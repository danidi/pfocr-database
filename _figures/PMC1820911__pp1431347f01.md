caption: 'Scheme of the flavonoid pathway leading to synthesis of anthocyanins, flavonols,
  and PAs. The enzymes involved in the pathway are shown as follows: CHS, chalcone
  synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3′H, flavonoid-3′-hydroxylase; F3′5′H, flavonoid-3′,5′-hydroxylase;
  F3H, flavanone-3β-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin
  dioxygenase; FLS, flavonol synthase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin
  reductase; and UFGT, UDP-Glc:flavonoid-3-O-glucosyltransferase. The F3′H and F3′5′H
  enzymes, which hydroxylate flavanones and dihydroflavonols, were omitted to clarify
  the scheme of the flavonoid pathway (see ). Note that Arabidopsis lacks LAR.'
