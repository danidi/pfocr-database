caption: AHR activation and nuclear translocation results in induction of XRE- and
  NC-XRE-driven target genes. In cycling cells, prolonged activation of the AHR results
  in enhanced p21cip1 expression and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)
  activity, thus preventing pRb inactivation resulting in cell cycle arrest. Induction
  of CYP1A1—which is enhanced by the AHR interaction with pRb—results in metabolic
  clearance of receptor ligands and subsequent inactivation of the AHR. This in turn,
  silences p21cip1 expression allowing CDK2 to inactivate pRb by hyperphosphorylation,
  thus facilitating G1 phase cell cycle progression. The equilibrium between the XRE
  and NC-XRE pathways and consequent effects on AHR activity thus influences passage
  through G1 phase.
