caption: Postsenescence survival in telomerase-deficient (tlc1Δ) budding yeast cells
  is controlled by three distinct Rad52-based homologous recombination pathways. When
  both the Rad50 pathway (which amplifies the telomeric TG1-3 sequences) and the Rad51
  pathway (which amplifies the subtelomeric Y′ sequences) have been genetically inactivated,
  there remains a third pathway, operating with a much lower efficiency than the other
  two, which exclusively amplifies the TG1-3 sequences. The lower number of survivors
  in tlc1Δ clb2Δ rad51Δ cells than in tlc1Δ rad50Δ rad51Δ cells suggests that Clb2
  controls both the Rad50 pathway and the third, unknown (X) pathway. The fact that
  there are still survivors in tlc1Δ clb2Δ rad51Δ cells but none in tlc1Δ rad52Δ cells
  suggests that another component, Y (unknown), controls pathway X. On the other hand,
  it is also clear that the Rad50 pathway is more sensitive than the Rad51 pathway
  to the absence of Clb2, as indicated, for instance, by the absence of survivors
  in the tlc1Δ clb2Δ rad51Δ strain grown in liquid cultures under standard conditions
  (Fig. ) or on plates (Fig. ). However, the Rad51 pathway, although not absolutely
  requiring Clb2 for telomeric recombination (tlc1Δ clb2Δ rad50Δ cells can generate
  survivors under standard conditions [Fig.  and ]), functioned less efficiently in
  the absence of Clb2 (Fig.  and ). The DNA damage checkpoint, which is activated
  in response to telomerase loss (see references in the text), represents a possible
  link with Cdc28/Clb2.

  description: Postsenescence survival in telomerase-deficient (tlc1Δ) budding yeast
    cells is controlled by three distinct Rad52-based homologous recombination pathways.
    When both the Rad50 pathway (which amplifies the telomeric TG1-3 sequences) and
    the Rad51 pathway (which amplifies the subtelomeric Y′ sequences) have been genetically
    inactivated, there remains a third pathway, operating with a much lower efficiency
    than the other two, which exclusively amplifies the TG1-3 sequences. The lower
    number of survivors in tlc1Δ clb2Δ rad51Δ cells than in tlc1Δ rad50Δ rad51Δ cells
    suggests that Clb2 controls both the Rad50 pathway and the third, unknown (X)
    pathway. The fact that there are still survivors in tlc1Δ clb2Δ rad51Δ cells but
    none in tlc1Δ rad52Δ cells suggests that another component, Y (unknown), controls
    pathway X. On the other hand, it is also clear that the Rad50 pathway is more
    sensitive than the Rad51 pathway to the absence of Clb2, as indicated, for instance,
    by the absence of survivors in the tlc1Δ clb2Δ rad51Δ strain grown in liquid cultures
