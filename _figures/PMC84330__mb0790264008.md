caption: Model for Btk-dependent TFII-I function. A fraction of TFII-I is constitutively
  associated with Btk in the cytoplasm of wild-type resting B cells. Upon signaling
  through the Ig receptor, Btk is activated (Btk#), leading to tyrosine phosphorylation
  of TFII-I either directly or indirectly. While Btk# may localize to the plasma membrane
  to bind phospholipids, trigger calcium signaling, and activate diacyl glycerol (DAG),
  tyrosine-phosphorylated TFII-I is released from Btk# and translocates to the nucleus,
  where it is serine phosphorylated, perhaps through a Ras-dependent pathway. Although
  tyrosine phosphorylation of TFII-I may not be necessary for its nuclear import,
  it may be required for its maximal transcriptional activity. In xid B cells, TFII-I
  may not be constitutively associated with Btk and thus, increased amounts are in
  the nucleus.
