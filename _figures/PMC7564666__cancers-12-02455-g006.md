caption: Protein Expression of Let-7a Target Genes are Altered in a LASP1-Ago2 Interaction-Dependent
  Manner. (A) Western blotting of Bone-Un LASP1 KO cell lines with re-introduced LASP1
  and its mutants for Ago2 expression and eIF4G2 (n = 3). (B) Western blotting of
  additional Let-7a targets vinculin (n = 3), CCR7 (n = 3), and cyclin D1 (n = 3).
  (C) Model of the CXCR4-LASP1-Ago2 pathway in the presence or absence of CXCL12.
  In the absence of CXCL12, LASP1 is phosphorylated on S146 and remains bound to CXCR4,
  while Ago2 can freely use Let-7a to repress motility-related targets. In the presence
  of CXCL12, CXCR4 is stimulated which induces dephosphorylation of LASP1 on S146
  and phosphorylation on the Y171 site. Once phosphorylated on Y171 LASP1 can bind
  to Ago2 and alter Let-7a driven RNAi. Two of the multiple possibilities of how LASP1
  could prevent Let-7a driven RNAi are illustrated; first, where LASP1 binds to Let-7a-bound
  Ago2 and interferes with target binding; second, where LASP1 binds to Ago2 and prevents
  Ago2 binding to Let-7a. Uncropped version of the Western Blots is available in .
