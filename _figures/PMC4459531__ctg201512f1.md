caption: Serrated Pathway to Colorectal Cancer. Schematic comparing the mutational
  changes involved from normal mucosa to colorectal cancer. The top half represents
  the conventional pathway to colorectal cancer, with the most frequent mutational
  events described. The bottom half demonstrates common events in the serrated pathway.
