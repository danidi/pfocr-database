caption: The EGF receptor signaling pathway generated by using the data contained
  in HPRD. The graph was drawn by using Pajek program and further manipulated manually
  (). The major signaling molecules involved in the EGF receptor pathway are labeled
  in red boxes. The interactors of the major proteins are shown as small circles.
  The graphs are generated in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which allows the user
  to zoom in without any loss of resolution. Clicking any node links to the corresponding
  molecule page in HPRD.
