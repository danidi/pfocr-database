caption: (A) The classical pathway of IL-12 and IL-23 secretion. First, IL-12p40 is
  induced in dendritic cells by inflammatory signals (PAMPs and/or DAMPs). Depending
  on the nature of the insult (e.g. type of pathogen, site of injury etc.), subsequent
  signals from NK, T or NKT cells (IFNγ, CD40L etc.,) can synergize to induce the
  expression of p35 or p19 on these DCs. These collective signals lead to the intracellular
  assembly of IL-12 (p40 plus p35) or IL-23 (p40 plus p19) and the secretion of these
  covalently linked heterodimers. (B) The alternative pathway. The induction of gene
  expression in this pathway is mechanistically identical to the classical pathway
  i.e. p40 is rapidly induced in response to PAMPs or DAMPS. However, the free p40
  monomer secreted in the extracellular milieu will pair and bind with various potential
  partners available locally leading to the generation of new heterodimeric cytokines
  extracellularly (p40 plus X, where X is any one of many binding partners). The versatility
  of p40 monomer binding to various partners can be due to the nature of tissue in
  which immune response is being generated - e.g. skin epithelial cells may potentially
  have different binding partners for p40 monomer than those of intestinal villi,
  capillary endothelium or Liver hepatocytes. In addition (not shown) the specific
  pathogen or injury to the stromal tissues may also result in the release of different
  binding partners, and thereby influence the particular binding partner available
  at any given time. This allows p40 to form complexes tailored to each local context
  - and then convey that information by binding to IL-12Rβ containing receptors on
  other immune cells downstream of DC activation.
