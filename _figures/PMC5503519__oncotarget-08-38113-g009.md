caption: IL-4/IL-13 bind to the Type II IL-4 receptor activating the JAK1/STAT6 signaling
  pathway, triggering GATA3 nuclear translocation that drives NOX1 expression. GATA3
  binding to the NOX1 promoter initiates transcription that is dependent on serine
  phosphorylation (S308). Increased expression of full-length NOX1 (NOX1-L) promotes
  ROS production which can inhibit PTP activity and increase cyclin D3 levels, leading
  to enhanced cell cycle traverse through S-phase and increased colon cancer cell
  proliferation. Human colon cancers, when compared to adjacent uninvolved colonic
  epithelia, demonstrate significantly higher levels of NOX1 and IL-4Rα mRNA, consistent
  with this model.
