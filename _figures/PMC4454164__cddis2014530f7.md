caption: Proposed mechanism for RSV in the regulation of mtROS homeostasis through
  Sirt3 signaling pathway in HUVECs. RSV triggers AMPK-PGC-1α signaling pathway, which
  is required for ERRα-dependent Sirt3 transcription and subsequent enrichment within
  the mitochondria, thereby leading to deacetylation and activation of mitochondrial
  enzymes involved in mtROS regulation as well as stimulation of mitochondrial ETC
  efficiency by upregulation of mtDNA-encoded gene expression and ATP synthesis, finally
  contributing to mtROS homeostasis in HUVECs. I, complex I; II, complex II; III,
  complex III; IV, complex IV; V, ATP synthase enzymes; Q, CoQ; Cytc, cytochrome c
