caption: Proposed mechanism for the regulation of opioid receptor functional competence
  by activation of BK signaling, based on , , ,, , and the present study. BK, acting
  via bradykinin B2 receptors, activates PLC to produce inositol trisphosphate (IP3)
  and diacylglycerol (DAG). The B2-selective antagonist, d-Arg-l-Arg-l-Pro-l-Hyp-Gly-l-(2-thienyl)Ala-l-Ser-d-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarbonyl-l-(2α,3β,7aβ)-octahydro-1H-indole-2-carbonyl-l-Arg
  (HOE 140), but not the B1-selective antagonist, Lys-[Leu8]des-Arg9-BK, prevents
  BK from eliciting functional competence. Agonists at other Gq-coupled receptors,
  such as the protease-activated receptor 2, will also induce functional competence.
  DAG activates PKC. Inhibitors of PKC, such as Bis or 5,6,7,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-12H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4-c]carbazole-12-propanenitrile
  (Go 6976), prevent the induction of functional competence by BK and activators of
  PKC, such the phorbol ester, phorbol dibutyrate (PdBu), promote functional competence.
  Activation of PKC in turn increases phospholipase A2-mediated AA release, which
  is metabolized by a COX. Inhibitors of COX, such as Indo, prevent induction of functional
  competence by BK and PdBu. Application of exogenous AA induces functional competence,
  which is not blocked by inhibitors of PKC; however, inhibition of COX blocks functional
  competence induced by PdBu, suggesting that the phospholipase A2 (PLA2)-AA-COX pathway
  is downstream from PKC. As indicated by the dashed lines, the COX-generated AA metabolite
  that promotes functional competence is not known. Inhibitors of the RGD-binding
  class of integrins also block induction of functional competence by BK, suggesting
  that RGD-binding integrins are necessary for production of functional competence
  by BK. It is not known whether integrins are an intermediary in BK signaling or
  act in parallel with BK to promote functional competence of opioid receptors systems.
  The effect of BK on the opioid receptor signaling system seems to be at the receptor-G
  protein level because BK pretreatment enhances opioid agonist-stimulated GTP[γ35S]
  binding.
