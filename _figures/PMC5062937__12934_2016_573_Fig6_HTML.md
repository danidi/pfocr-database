caption: Key compounds of the leucine, valine and isoleucine metabolism—microarray
  studies. The SBGN style metabolic network depicts reversible (double headed arrow)
  and irreversible (single headed arrow) reactions catalyzed by the corresponding
  enzymes (rectangular square). Enzymes are enriched with color-coded fold change
  values of time resolved expression data of the respective genes. The colors represent
  upregulation (blue) and downregulation (red) of genes in cells shifted to medium
  containing 1-butanol as the carbon source compared to cells grown with glucose.
  Metabolites or enzymes occurring multiple times in the metabolic network are decorated
  with a clone marker (e.g. NAD+) (produced using VANTED [, ])
