caption: Gene Expression Model for the Preferential Galactose Uptake in Yeast Cells.
  (A) Genetic construct of the transcriptional control of the yeast-enhanced green
  florescent protein expression in the galactose utilization pathway of yeast. (B)
  The complete gene expression pathway includes (fast) reversible transformations
  among different promoter configurations and subsequent irreversible RNA and protein
  synthesis pathways. The reduced model assumes pseudo-equilibrium among the promoter
  configurations, and thus only describes dynamics of processes in the dashed boxes.
