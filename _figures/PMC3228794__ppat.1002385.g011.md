caption: In this model, the rice blast fungus responds to external physical cues from
  the rice leaf surface that are detected by receptors such as Pth11 and are transmitted
  via the heterotrimeric G-protein leading to Mac1 adenylate cyclase activation. This
  activates the cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase A, CpkA, which in turn acts upstream
  of MoSom1, a transcriptional regulator that acts through a set of transcription
  factors including MoStu1, MoCdtf1 and others to bring about infection-assocaited
  development.
