caption: Intercellular communication between adjacent epithelial cells via cell–cell
  signaling receptors. (a) E-cadherin signaling. E-cadherins form extracellular homophilic
  complexes between neighboring cells. p120 catenin binds to the juxtamembrane domain
  of E-cadherin and stabilizes E-cadherin by preventing clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
  β-catenin binds to E-cadherin. α-catenin shuttles between β-catenin and epithelial
  protein lost in neoplasm (EPLIN), and connects the E-cadherin complexes to F-actin.
  (b) Delta-Notch signaling. Notch binds to its ligand (Delta or Jagged) on adjacent
  cells, proteolytically releasing the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD moves
  to the nucleus and interacts with DNA-binding protein RBP (recombination signal-binding
  protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region) along with several coactivators to regulate
  gene expression. Multiple Notch target genes, such as Hairy/enhancer of split (Hes)
  and lunatic fringe (Lfng), are negative regulators of the Notch pathway. These feedbacks
  can give rise to oscillations in gene expression. (c) Eph–ephrin signaling. Eph–ephrin
  binding on neighboring cells leads to bidirectional phosphotyrosine signaling. Eph-expressing
  cells activate Eph RTK activity together with other tyrosine kinases, such as ABL,
  for each forward signaling. In ephrin-expressing cells, other RTKs such as insulin-like
  growth factor receptor (IGF1R) are transactivated. Ephrin-induced reverse signaling
  is critical for boundary formation.
