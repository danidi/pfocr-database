caption: CQ excites TRPA1 and TRPC3, sensitizes TRPV1, and inhibits TRPM8 through
  different signaling mechanisms. Binding of CQ to the CQ receptor MrgprA3 causes
  activation of Gαq and release of Gβγ. The released Gβγ then activates the TRPA1
  channel, leading to opening of the channel and calcium influx. Meanwhile, activated
  Gαq activates PLCβ, leading to excitation of the TRPC3 channel and calcium influx.
  Activated Gαq also stimulates PKC and increases phosphorylation of TRPV1, leading
  to the sensitization of TRPV1 and subsequently enhanced itch. Activated Gαq also
  directly inhibits TRPM8 by binding to TRPM8 without the need to involve the PLC
  pathway. Inhibition of TRPM8 probably also contributes indirectly to enhanced pain
  and itch.
