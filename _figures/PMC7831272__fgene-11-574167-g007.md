caption: A proposed model on the epigenetic regulation mechanisms of histone H3K27
  acetylation causing the FLHS in laying hens. Mediated by histone-modifying enzyme,
  HELP could have an impact on histone modification of H3K27ac and chromatin structure,
  leading to the dysregulation of genes related to lipid and energy metabolism (PCK1,
  APOA1, ANGPTL4, and FABP1) and immune response (FGF7, PDGFRA, and KIT), and PPAR
  signaling pathway, which may cause the excessive accumulation of fat in liver tissue
  and induce the development of the FLHS.
