caption: Proposed model showing the role of ECM proteoglycans bgn and fmod in controlling
  the fate of tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPC). In this model Bgn and Fmod bind
  to growth factors such as BMP. This growth factor binding is lost when bgn or fmod
  is depleted and can affect the differentiation fate of TSPC by stimulating the BMP
  signalling pathway. In this model, the increased BMP activity causes TSPC to differentiate
  into osteoblasts and form bone. The normal ECM-rich niche controls this BMP activity
  so that TSPC can differentiate into tenocytes that form tendon. Forced treadmill
  exercise can either increase or decrease the differentiation of TSPC towards bone
  or tendon in a mechanism depending on the exercise regime.
