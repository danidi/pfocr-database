caption: Energy conservation as high-energy phosphate bonds from carbon oxidation
  and carbon reduction [modified from ]. (A) Mechanism of the D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase reaction in the glycolytic (oxidative) direction to generate the mixed
  anhydride bond in 1,3-bisphospho-D-glycerate. R = CH(OH)CH2OPO32–. The vertical
  arrow underscores the oxidative nature of the reaction in the energy-conserving
  direction. (B) Synthesis of acyl phosphate from H2 and CO2 as it occurs in the acetyl
  CoA pathway. Modified from  and . The reactions are drawn from data compiled in
  , in , in , and in . Some methanogens can generate reduced ferredoxin via an energy-conserving
  hydrogenase, Ech, which does not entail bifurcation, but operates at the expense
  of an ion gradient, the generation of which demands bifurcation at the Mvh–Hdr complex
  () in methanogens without cytochromes.
