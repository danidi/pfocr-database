caption: This diagram is consistent with only one turn through the TCA cycle. Key
  amino acids that interact within these pathways are also illustrated. LDH, lactate
  dehydrogenase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; CS, citrate synthase; ACO2, aconitase;
  IDH2/3, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2/3; OGDHc, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex;
  SS, succinate synthase; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; FH, fumarate hydratase; MDH2,
  malate dehydrogenase; PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Full filled circles are the
  carbons which would have a 13C label is from 1,6-13C2 glucose. If label can be in
  one of two locations, the circles are half filled for visual clarity. A second succinyl-CoA
  which is unlabeled is included to highlight lack of label on first pass from carbons
  from the propionate pathway. In addition, unlabeled amino acids are also included
  in the figure to remind that those pools will include additional amino acids that
  have not been labeled. (B) Novel alternative propionate excretion pathway to form
  oxalate occurs in PCC mutant C. elegans. Percentages indicate levels relative to
  glycerate, which is the most predominant peak on GC/MS analysis (). Results were
  consistent in both PCC mutant strains.
