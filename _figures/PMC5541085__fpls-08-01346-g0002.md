caption: A schematic representation of the regulation of transcription factors under
  abiotic stress condition with or without Si supplementation. (A) Model displaying
  the OsDREB2A regulation in ABA-independent pathway to combat stress. (B) Regulation
  of OsNAC5 transcription factor in ABA-dependent pathway to trigger stress tolerance
  related genes. (C) The OsRDCP1 mediated stress tolerance response via the ubiquitin-proteosome
  degradation pathway. (D) Improvement of glycine betaine biosynthesis by OsCMO to
  combat ROS generation. The black standard arrows represent the up-regulation of
  gene in the presence of Si and red dotted arrows indicate the down-regulation of
  gene and corresponding functions upon stress in Si- plant. DRE, Dehydration responsive
  element; DREB2A; dehydration-responsive element binding protein 2A; NAC, no apical
  meristem (NAM), Arabidopsis thaliana activating factor (ATAF), and cup-shaped cotyledon
  (CUC) regulons; OsRDCP1, Oryza sativa RING domain containing protein; OsCMO, Oryza
  sativa choline monooxygenase; SNAC1, stress-responsive NAC protein, OsLEA3, Oryza
  sativa late embryogenesis abundant protein; E1, ubiquitin activating; E2, ubiquitin
  conjugating; E3,ubiquitin ligating enzymes, ATP, adenosine triphosphate; ADP, adenosine
  diphosphate. The diagram was conceived based on the interpretation from the following
  literatures (Mizoi et al., ; Nakashima et al., ; Khattab et al., ).
