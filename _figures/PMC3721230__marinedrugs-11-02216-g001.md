caption: Mechanisms of action of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a sepsis inducer. LPS
  is recognized by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) on animal’s immune cells. Recognition
  is aided by two accessory proteins known as CD14 and MD-2. Stimulation of TLR-4
  triggers reaction with the adaptor molecule MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response
  protein 88). The MyD88-depending signaling pathway leads to the activation of nuclear
  factor-κβ (NF-κβ), which regulates the expression of target genes that encode pro-inflammatory
  mediators. The overstimulation of receptors may lead to uncontrolled general inflammation
  and eventually to sepsis.
