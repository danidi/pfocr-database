caption: (a) The prior knowledge pathway was derived by removing unidentifiable proteins
  in the original network published for the DREAM 4 challenge. The width of each edge
  is proportional to its prior confidence score. (b) The signaling pathway learned
  by our method in which the green edges were inferred and added into the prior network.
  (c) The signaling pathway learned in ref.  in which the green edges were inferred
  although not in the prior network. (d) The curves of the best LSE and model complexity
  (measured by the number of edges) with regard to γ, as well as the LSE and MSE values
  for the measured proteins.
