caption: Tumor epithelium promotes the downregulation of p62 in stromal fibroblasts
  leading to reduced mTORC1 activity and c-Myc expression, which results in impaired
  metabolic detoxification and the subsequent release of ROS and IL-6. An autocrine
  pathway promotes TGFβ and the induction of CAF phenotype that further increases
  epithelial invasion and tumorigenesis.
