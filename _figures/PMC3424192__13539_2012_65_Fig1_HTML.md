caption: Illustration of pituitary–gonadal axis in healthy individuals (a) and in
  cancer patients (b). Increased ghrelin, decreased leptin, and medications (opioids
  and glucocorticoids) suppress LH production, thereby causing central hypogonadism.
  Increased inflammation, certain chemotherapeutic agents, and changes in ghrelin
  and leptin may also contribute to hypogonadism by downregulating testicular production
  of testosterone directly. Dashed lines indicate a decrease in the pathway
