caption: H2S and NO in ischemic vascular remodeling. Ischemia transiently enhances
  H2S generation by CSE. H2S increases VEGF production and post-translationally modifies
  VEGFR1 and eNOS, which can lead to elevated NO availability. NO in turn improves
  angiogenesis and arteriogenesis through cytokines and monocyte recruitment. Importantly,
  H2S enhances nitrite (NO2−) reduction via XO, which is a more reliable pathway of
  NO production under hypoxia. H2S can activate the cGC/cGMP/PKG pathway by acting
  on sGC and phosphodiesterase, which not only contributes to angiogenesis and arteriogenesis
  but may also serve as a negative feedback by PKG-dependent phosphorylation of CSE.
  cGMP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; PKG,
  cGMP-dependent protein kinase; sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; VEGF, vascular endothelial
  growth factor; VEGFR1, VEGF receptor 1; XO, xanthine oxidase. To see this illustration
