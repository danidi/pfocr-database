caption: The cytochrome oxidase activity data from the lesioned hemispheres were applied
  to an anatomical network model of motor control, and patterns of functional connectivity
  were determined based on interregional metabolic activity correlations. The vehicle-injected
  control group was used as a reference for functional connectivity in the network
  of interest. The striatal damage induced by rotenone (Rot) resulted in a general
  functional disconnection (thinner arrows) in the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor
  loop, with a pattern characterized by 1) decoupling between the subthalamic nucleus
  (STh) and the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr), 2) decoupling between thalamic
  regions (VA/VL) and the secondary motor cortex (M2), 3) decoupling between M2 and
  the striatum (CPu), and 4) emergence of a strong functional correlation between
  CPu and SNr (i.e. descending striatonigral pathway). MB co-treated subjects (Rot/MB)
  showed strengthening of functional influences in the indirect striatal, thalamocortical
  and corticostriatal pathways compared to Rot, a pattern suggestive of MB-induced
  network normalization that was similar to control. Arrow direction is given by the
  anatomical connectivity model and arrow thicknesses represent the magnitude of the
  interregional correlation coefficients (r) (i.e. an index of the degree of functional
  coupling). Thicker lines represent higher functional coupling, whereas thinner lines
  represent lower coupling. Solid arrows represent positive (+r), whereas segmented
  arrows represent negative (−r) interregional metabolic activity correlations. *
  = significant difference from control. • = significant difference from Rot group.
