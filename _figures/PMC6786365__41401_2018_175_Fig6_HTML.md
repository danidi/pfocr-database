caption: Rationale for the investigation of the CD31-TFPI-Tg or CD31-Hir-Tg mice.
  Tissue factor (TF) and downstream coagulation proteases can exert direct influences
  on the inflammatory cascade. Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) has a cornerstone
  role in transforming coagulation protease activity into inflammatory signals and
  thrombin is the main ligand to PAR1. A predominant mechanism by which the fusion
  proteins, human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (hTFPI) or hirudin, inhibit inflammation
  is to inhibit the development of local chemokine gradients, particularly CCL2, which
  in vivo is dependent on thrombin signaling through endothelial cell (EC)-expressed
  PAR1. The fact that both strains showed the same protective response implies that
  the predominant effect of the hTFPI fusion protein is to inhibit thrombin generation
