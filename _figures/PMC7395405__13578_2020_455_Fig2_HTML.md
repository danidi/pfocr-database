caption: 'The exosome pathway. These small vesicles (30–120 nm) of endocytic origin
  are formed by inside budding of the membrane of late endosomes, generating multivesicular
  bodies (MVBs), and are released into the extracellular matrix by fusion of the MVBs
  with the plasma membrane (secretion pathway). Alternatively, MVBs may fuse with
  lysosomes for hydrolysis of exosomes (degradation pathway) or back-fuse with the
  plasma membrane for recycling such molecules (back-fusion pathway). Exosome cargo
  may consist of endocytosis, Golgi apparatus, and cytoplasm. Various molecules contribute
  to biogenesis of exosomes, including the ESCRT machinery, tetraspanins and lipids
  (ceramide). It is still unclear whether these mechanisms simultaneously generate
  the same MVB or not. Various Rab-GTPase proteins (Rab7, Rab11, Rab27a,-b, and Rab35)
  are involved in the intracellular trafficking of MVBs/exosome. Furthermore, SNAREs
  have been proposed to facilitate the fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane. EE:
