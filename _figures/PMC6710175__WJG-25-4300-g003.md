caption: 'Mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma development in the Mat1a knockout
  mouse. Multiple mechanisms are known to influence hepatocellular carcinoma development
  in the Mat1a-KO mouse. These include: oxidative stress due to lower GSH levels and
  higher CYP2E1 expression; mitochondrial dysfunction due to reduced PHB1 and increased
  mitochondrial CYP2E1 levels; increased sumoylation, stabilizing MATα2, which acts
  as a transcription factor to enhance BCL-2 transcription as well as directly interacting
  with BCL-2 leading to its stabilization; enhanced activation of the LKB1/AMPK pathway
  which leads to the cytoplasmic translocation of HuR from nucleus and subsequent
  stabilization of cyclins; aberrant activation of ERK which promotes uncontrolled
  cell growth; enhanced genomic instability due to DNA hypomethylation and impaired
  DNA repair machinery and increased number of liver cancer stem cells with tumorigenic
  potential.'
