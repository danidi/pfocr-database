caption: 'Competitive displacement of DMP1 by ASARM peptide modulates PHEX–DMP1-mediated
  FGF23 expression (see central osteoblast in green). Specifically, DMP1 and PHEX
  interact and signal a down regulation of FGF23 as discussed in the text. ASARM disrupts
  this binding (PHEX + DMP1), resulting in an up-regulation of FGF23 signaling as
  discussed in . This in turn leads to major changes in bone mineralization, bone
  turnover, vitamin D metabolism with hypophosphatemia. Recent evidence indicates
  that this also impacts fat energy metabolism pathways as depicted in the scheme
  and discussed in the text. Profound changes in fat mass, weight, glucose metabolism,
  insulin sensitivity, leptin levels, serotonin levels, sympathetic tone, aldosterone
  levels, vascularization, and sympathetic tone, occur in mice with defects in PHEX,
  DMP1, FGF23, MEPE, and ASARM expression. ,,,–,,,,– Index: SNS, sympathetic nervous
  system; Adrβ2, Osteoblast β2 adrenergic receptors (responsive to epinephrine/norepinephrine);
  Gla-OCN, γ-carboxylated osteocalcin (inactive form); Unc-OCN, γ-de-carboxylated
  osteocalcin (active form); Esp, Gene for OST-PTP (tyrosine phosphatase) that phosphorylates
  and inactivates the insulin receptor. This directly/indirectly results in reduced
  active osteocalcin (reduced γ-decarboxylation); Tcirg1, Osteoclast proton (H+) pump.
  Increases resorption lacuna acidity (acidic ASARM-peptides likely contribute) and
  thereby increases active osteocalcin (Unc-OCN) by acidic γ-decarboxylation; ASARM,
  Acidic Serine Aspartate Rich MEPE associated peptide or motif.'
