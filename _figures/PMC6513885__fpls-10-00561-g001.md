  defense. A stress signal is recognized by numerous sensors and is transferred by
  several cellular biochemical pathways. Abiotic and biotic stresses result in ROS
  production. The stress-signaling pathway gives also rise to intracellular PAs, which
  are secreted/oxidized in the apoplast by PAOs in order to supply H2O2 and several

  level created: ① when low (H2O2 below a specific threshold), it is powerfully scavenged
