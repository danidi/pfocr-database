caption: The mechanism map shows that down-regulation of miR-135b induced apoptosis
  and inhibited proliferation and CDDP resistance of GC cells by inactivating the
  MAPK signaling pathway and increasing the expression of MST1.

  resistance and proliferation and induces the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through
  MST1-mediated MAPK signaling pathway.
