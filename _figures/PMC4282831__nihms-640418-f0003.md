caption: Depending on their activation state, macrophages/microglia can differentially
  modulate endothelial cell growth. M1 macrophages are anti-angiogenic, whereas M2
  macrophages promote angiogenesis. The effect of macrophages on endothelial cells
  can be contact-dependent or through secretion of angiogenic factors. Complement
  factor B (cfB), a component of the alternative complement pathway, in combination
  with the complement inhibitor (CD55), selectively inhibits pathological neovessel
  formation. In hypoxic conditions, CD55 is downregulated in endothelial cells therefore
  allowing the specific targeting of neovessels by cfB. Complement components can
  also modulate macrophage activation. Complement components C3 and C5 polarize macrophages
  to an M1 anti-angiogenic phenotype. Activation of microglial cells upon exposure
  to ischemia induces the secretion of IL-1β and subsequent production of Semaphorin-3a
  (Sema-3A) by retinal neurons. Sema-3A induces degeneration of the retinal vasculature.
  The adaptive immunity may promote angiogenesis through autoantibodies or secretion
  of IL-17 by T cells. Ocular angiogenesis can be further regulated through the remodeling
  of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Activation of ECM-stimulated pathways through
  neuropilin-1 (NRP1) signaling also promotes angiogenesis in the eye.
