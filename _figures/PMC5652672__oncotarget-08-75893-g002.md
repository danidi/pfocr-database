caption: 'Section (A) demonstrates activation of androgen receptor (AR) by testosterone
  (T) under normal conditions. Signals from dihydrotestosterone cause dimerization
  of AR and relocation to the nucleus initiating metabolic activities and growth.
  Section (B) demonstrates activation of AR mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors.
  Dimerization of the tyrosine kinase receptor leads to activation of PI3K and phosphorylation
  of AKT. Phosphorylated AKT can then cause dimerization of AR leading to relocation
  of AR to the nucleus initiating metabolic activities and growth. Normally functional
  PTEN inhibits the AR dimerization initiated by phosphorylated AKT. Truncation and
  frameshift mutations in PTEN as seen in this cohort lead to the loss of this PTEN
  inhibition. Thus, somatic mutations in PTEN result in lack of sensitivity to androgen
  deprivation therapy. Abbreviations: AR - Androgen receptor; Akt - V-Akt Murine Thymoma
  Viral Oncogene Homolog; Chr - Chromosome; DHT - Dihydrotestosterone; K (red circle)
  - Kinase; PIP3 - Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-Triphosphate; PTEN - Phosphatase and
  Tensin Homolog; T – Testosterone.'
