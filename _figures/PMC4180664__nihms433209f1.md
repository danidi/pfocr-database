caption: Saturated free fatty acids (FFAs) such as palmitate not only represent the
  substrate for de novo ceramide biosynthesis, but also signal via the toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) to activate inhibitor of kB-kinase (IKKβ) which stimulates transcript levels
  of enzymes involved in ceramide biosynthesis e.g., serine palmitoyl transferase
  long chain base 1 (Sptlc1) and 2 (Sptlc2) and dihydroceramide desaturase (des1).
  The dashed line indicates that ceramide disrupts the association between inhibitor
  2 of protein phosphatase 2A (I2PP2A) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by binding
  to I2PP2A. PP2A translocates to the cell membrane and associates with endothelial
  nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). PP2A association with eNOS decreases the association
  between eNOS and protein kinase B (Akt) and between eNOS and heat shock protein
  90 (Hsp90). PP2A promotes the dephosphorylation of Akt that colocalizes with eNOS
  and /or decreases eNOS phosphorylation at serine (S) 1177 and S617 directly. This
  impairs NO bioavailability and leads to vascular dysfunction. Adiponectin might
  modify the effects of ceramide accumulation by binding to adiponectin (Adipo) R1
  and Adipo R2 receptors and increasing ceramidase activity. Ceramidases hydrolyze
  ceramide to form sphingosine leading to an increase sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP)
  to ceramide ratio. Evidence exists that signaling via this pathway increases NO
  production. Neither this pathway, nor the potential metabolism of ceramide via adiponectin,
  have been evaluated in vivo in the context of obesity and endothelial dysfunction.
