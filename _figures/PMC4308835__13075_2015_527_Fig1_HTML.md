caption: Overview of nuclear factor-κ B activation pathways. Schematic representation
  of the canonical and non-canonical nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathways. The canonical
  NF-κB pathway can be activated by a variety of different stimuli, like tumor necrosis
  factor-α and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of the canonical pathway via Toll-like
  receptor or cytokine receptor signaling depends on the inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK)
  complex, which is composed of the kinases IKKα and IKKβ, and the regulatory subunit
  IKKγ (NEMO). Activated IKK phosphorylates the inhibitory subunit IκBα to induce
  its degradation, allowing NF-κB dimers (p50-p65) to translocate to the nucleus and
  bind to DNA to induce NF-κB target gene transcription. The non-canonical pathway
  (right) is activated by specific stimuli like B cell activating factor, lymphotoxin
  β, LIGHT and CD40L. NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) is stabilized and activates and
  recruits IKKα into the p100 complex to phosphorylate p100, leading to p100 ubiquitination.
  Processing of p100 generates the p52/RelB NF-κB complex, which is able to translocate
  to the nucleus and induce gene expression.
