caption: 'Potential metabolic functions of MCCase.  MCCase catalyzes the ATP-dependent
  carboxylation of MC-CoA to form  MG-CoA. This reaction may be required in the catabolism
  of Leu to  acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA (reactions 1–6). MCCase may also function  to
  convert mevalonate (MVA) to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA (via  isopentenyl pyrophosphate
  [IPP] and 3-methylcrotonoic acid) by the  “mevalonate shunt.” A third function of
  MCCase may be as part of an  isoprenoid catabolic pathway (via geranoyl-CoA). Reactions
  4 to 6 are  common to all three processes. The products of these processes,  acetoacetate
  and acetyl-CoA, can be further metabolized to isoprenoids,  polyketide derivatives
  (e.g. flavonoids, stilbenoids), and fatty acids,  to Glc in tissues engaging the
  glyoxylate cycle, or respired to  CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The enzymes
  of Leu  catabolism are: (a) branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase, (b)  BCKDH
  complex, (c) branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, (d) MCCase,  (e) MG-CoA hydratase,
  and (f) HMG-CoA lyase. The asterisks denote  the carbon atom expected to be radioactively
  labeled when  NaH14CO3 is supplied for the MCCase reaction.'
