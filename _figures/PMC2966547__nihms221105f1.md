caption: Homocysteine metabolic pathways. Homocysteine can be metabolised by three
  metabolic pathways in tissues. (1) Remethylation to methionine using 5-methyltetrahydrofolate
  (5-MTHF) as methyl donor, catalysed by the vitamin B12-dependent action of methionine
  synthase (MS). THF is then re-cycled to form 5-MTHF, catalysed by 5,10-methylene
  tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Methionine then acts as the precursor for the
  ATP-dependent synthesis of the primary methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which
  is involved in various methylation reactions, producing homocysteine and methylated
  acceptor(s). (2) Betaine can be utilized as an alternative methyl donor to generate
  methionine and dimethylglycine (DMG), catalysed by betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase
  (BHMT). (3) Homocysteine can enter the transsulphuration pathway being converted
  to cysteine through the action of cystathionine β-synthase (CβS)
