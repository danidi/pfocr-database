caption: Simplified KEGG pathway “Proteoglycans in Cancer” with H3K4me3 and H3K27me3
  enriched genes. The KEGG pathway was down-loaded into Cytoscape (3.5.1) using the
  CytoKegg (1.0.1) application. ChIP-seq data was overlaid on the pathway with H3K4me3
  results shown in blue rectangles and H3K27me3 results shown in red ovals. Blue filled
  nodes indicate a predicted down-regulation with ethanol based on the ChIP-seq results
  and pink filled nodes indicate a predicted up-regulation. Proteoglycans play several
  crucial roles in modulating neuronal migration, axonal regeneration, and synaptic
  plasticity.
