caption: Schematic representation of the mechanism of the antithrombosis effect by
  miR-148a inhibition. Depicted is the ITAM-Syk pathway and the proposed role of TULA-2,
  miR-148a, and anti–miR-148a. Anti–miR-148a indirectly ameliorates ITAM-Syk–mediated
  platelet activation by upregulating TULA-2 expression, which further inactivates
  Syk and its downstream effectors.
