caption: Hepatic lipid homeostasis is regulated by LRP6. Recognition of apolipoprotein
  by the receptor at neutral pH initiates the internalization of ligands, followed
  by distribution to endosomes. Released ligand particles travel further to lysosomes,
  where digestive enzymes degrade the ligands. When LRP6 signaling malfunctions, the
  IGF1-Sp1-mTOR-SREBP1/2 pathway is stimulated. Activation of SREBP1c (required for
  de novo lipogenesis and adipogenesis) and SREBP-2 (which activates cholesterol and
  LDLR biosynthesis) boost adipogenesis and VLDL assembly, resulting in hyperlipidemia
  and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases. CE, cholesterol ester; TG, triglyceride;
  FFA, free fatty acid; ARH, autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia protein; PCSK9,
  proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9; SREBP, sterol regulatory element-binding
  protein; Fz, frizzled protein. IGF1, insulin-like growth factor 1; Sp1, specificity
  protein 1; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; ACC1, acetyl CoA carboxylase;
  FAS, fatty acid synthase; SCD1, stearoyl CoA desaturase; ELOVL6, elongation of long-chain
  fatty acids family member 6; ACAT, acetyl-Co A acetyltransferase; MTP, microsomal
  triglyceride transfer protein.
