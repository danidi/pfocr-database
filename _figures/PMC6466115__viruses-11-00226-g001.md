caption: 'Biosynthesis pathway of histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) by stepwise addition
  of monosaccharides to precursor structures. The FUT2 (secretor) gene encodes an
  α1,2-fucosyltransferase which adds a fucose residue in α1,2 linkage to the terminal
  galactose of the H type 1 precursor. Non-secretors, having a non-functional FUT2
  enzyme, cannot synthesize the H type 1 antigen from its precursor and lack α1,2-linked
  fucose HBGAs in the intestinal mucosa and other secretions. The synthesis of the
  A and B antigens by the corresponding enzymes requires the presence of the H type
  1 antigen, adding an N-acetylgalactosamine (A) or a galactose (B) in a α1,4 linkage
  on the galactose residue of the H type 1 antigen. The Lewis antigens are synthesized
  with the FUT3 enzyme which adds a α1,4-linked fucose residue on the N-acetylglucosamine
  of the H antigen or the H antigen precursor, generating Lewis a or Lewis b antigens
  respectively. Abbreviations: Gal: galactose; GlcNAc: N-acetylglucosamine; Fuc: fucose.'
