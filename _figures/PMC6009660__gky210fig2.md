caption: Regulatory network generated by TGMI algorithm for the Arabidopsis thaliana
  lignin biosynthesis pathway using the microarray data generated from hypocotyledonous
  stem tissues under the short-day condition. Green nodes represent pathway genes.
  All other nodes are TFs regardless of what colors they are. Light coral nodes represent
  positive known pathway regulators in current knowledgebase with the literature evidence
  being provided.
