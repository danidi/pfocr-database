caption: Diagram of high-dose SrRan-induced hASC apoptosis by ERK/p53-mediated pathways
  and subsequent Bcl-2 family-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. SrRan activates ERK
  phosphorylation, which may increase phosphorylation of its target gene P53. Activation
  of P53, in turn, downregulates predicted target genes, anti-apoptotic protein, and
  Bcl-2, and upregulates the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX in hASCs
  in OM, and causes mitochondrial apoptosis
