caption: Red color is for parts of the structure derived from acetate; green, from
  glycine and l-serine; blue, from l-proline. A = adenylation domain, KS = ketide
  synthase, AT = acyltransferase, GT = glycine transferase, ST = serine transferase,
  HBP = 4-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-2,2′-bipyrrole, 2-UP = 2-undecylpyrrole subunit,
  MBC = 4-methoxy-[2,2′-bipyrrole]-5-carboxaldehyde subunit.
