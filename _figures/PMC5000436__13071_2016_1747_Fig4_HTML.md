caption: 'The levels of enzymes involved in the tick hemoglobinolytic pathway vary
  in a tissue-specific manner in response to A. phagocytophilum infection. Differential
  expression/representation of tick hemoglobinolytic enzymes in response to A. phagocytophilum
  infection was obtained from Ayllón et al. [] and represented by pondering mRNA (transcriptomics
  RNAseq and real-time RT-PCR) and protein (proteomics) data. In tick midguts, the
  hemoglobinolytic pathway operating in the endosomal digestive vesicle was revised
  by Sojka et al. []. In tick salivary glands, these enzymes are also produced and
  may function under different conditions. Abbreviations: AMP, hemoglobin-derived
  antimicrobial peptides (Hemocidins and other); HRG1, Heme-responsive gene 1; HELP,
  Heme-binding lipoprotein; VG1, Vitellogenin 1; VG2, Vitellogenin 2'
