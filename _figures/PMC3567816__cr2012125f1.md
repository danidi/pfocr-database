caption: A summary of the newly proposed inflammasome activation pathway including
  PKRs' recently found role. The activation of several inflammasomes results in the
  release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and alarmins including IL-1β, IL-18 and HMGB1.
  PKR was shown to interact with the NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes, however,
  the mechanisms of inflammasome regulation remain elusive. Several questions remain
  unanswered, such as whether PKR modulates downstream inflammasome signaling, by
  interacting with the common adaptor protein ASC or pro-caspase-1.
