caption: 'Example of synthetic lethality: PARP inhibition in cells deficient in homologous
  recombination (HR). (a) In normal cells, repair pathways, including base excision
  repair (BER) and HR, are intact. Single-strand breaks (SSBs) are readily repaired
  by BER, with the participation of PARP1, and double-strand breaks (DSBs) are reliably
  repaired by HR, with the participation of BRCA1 and BRCA2. (b) Cells with mutations
  in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are deficient in HR. Other repair pathways, including the BER
  pathway, are able to minimize the number of lesions that become DSBs. (c) Normal
  cells treated with PARP inhibitors may become deficient in BER. Therefore, more
  SSBs go unrepaired. During replication, the replication fork may stall, resulting
  in the conversion of SSBs into DSBs. HR can repair these DSBs in an error-free manner.
  (d) When PARP inhibitors are delivered to cells deficient in HR (for example, BRCA-mutated
  cells), synthetic lethality can result. Inhibition of BER by PARP inhibitors results
  in the conversion of unrepaired SSBs into DSBs. These DSBs cannot be repaired by
  HR in an error-free manner and can therefore result in cell death. PARP, poly(ADP-ribose)
  polymerase.'
