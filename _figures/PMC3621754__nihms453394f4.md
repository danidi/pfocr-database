caption: MUC1-C cycles from the cell membrane to endosomes and then back to the cell
  membrane (; ). Alternatively, with overexpression in breast cancer cells, MUC1-C
  accumulates in cytoplasm where it forms homodimers that are mediated by the CQC
  motif in the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain (). MUC1-C dimerization is necessary for
  transport into the nucleus by importin-β (). In the nucleus, MUC1-C associates with
  transcription factors, such as STAT1/3, NF-κB RelA and ERα, and contributes to transactivation
  of their target genes (). MUC1-C is also transported to the mitochondrial outer
  membrane where it blocks activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway ().
