caption: Mechanistic model for HSPB5/client interactions along an aggregation pathway.
  A, the aggregation pathway of destabilized αLac as defined by DLS (based on Ref.
  ). Under nonstress conditions, HSPB5 interacts only with small (monomeric) early-lag-phase
  species in a highly transient manner. These interactions are sufficient to prolong
  the lag phase and onset of irreversible aggregates. B, in response to conditions
  associated with cellular stress (heat, acidosis, phosphorylation), polydisperse
  HSPB5 undergoes alterations in its oligomeric distribution and/or conformational
  state(s), signified by HSPB5**. The precise nature of the alterations depends on
  the perturbation, as both larger and smaller particle distributions are observed
  across the different HSPB5 mutants. Regardless, HSPB5** can interact with both early-
  and late-lag-phase species, in modes distinct from WT HSPB5, to further prolong
  the onset of rapid and irreversible aggregation.
