caption: Five important processes in inflammation are combined into one interconnected
  pathway network. (TNF-α, green) TNF-α is part of the very extensive NF-κβ pathway
  []. TNF-α starts multiple signaling cascades by recruiting the tumor necrosis factor
  receptor 1 (TNFR1), which is subsequently recruiting the TNFR1 associated death
  domain (TRADD) []. TRADD on one side activates the caspase cascade which leads to
  apoptosis and ROS production []. On the other side, the core component complex IKKα/β
  (Iκα/β kinase) of the NF-κβ pathway is activated. The β part subsequently phosphorylates
  Iκβ which in turn activates NF-κβ []. This leads to translocation of NF-κβ dimers
  to the nucleus and upregulation of (among others) IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and manganese
  superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) [–]. (IL-6, pink) IL-6 is an important activator of
  the Janus kinase signal transducer and an activator of transcription []. The JAK/Stat
  pathway is involved in the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in inflammation,
  cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [,]. IL-6 binds to the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R),
  which in turn associates with the gp130 protein complex on the cell membrane and
  phosphorylates JAK. Only a few cell types express the IL-6R on the cell membrane,
  however, all cells have a soluble form of this receptor (sIL-6R) and the gp130 dimer,
  meaning that JAK/Stat signaling can be activated in essentially all cell types.
  The complexation of IL-6 with gp130 and consequently the phosphorylation of Stat3
  is needed for a controlled inflammatory response [,]. Activated Stat3 dimerizes
  and translocates to the nucleus, where (among others) c-Myc and c-reactive protein
  (CRP) are upregulated []. Furthermore, activated Stat3 stimulates NF-κβ [] and the
  Ras oncogene which is important in both the development of cancer [,] and stimulation
  of inflammation []. (IL-8, yellow) IL-8 is a pro-inflammatory chemokine whose expression
  is primarily regulated by NF-κβ. IL-8 binds to G-coupled protein receptor CXCR1/2,
  which in turn stimulates the Ras oncogene and promotes the nuclear translocation
  of Stat3 []. It is the most powerful human neutrophil chemoattractant and stimulates
  tumor growth. Furthermore, TNF-α and ROS are potent inducers of IL-8 production
  []. (ROS, blue) At an inflammatory site, ROS (which include superoxide radicals,
  nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide []) are produced continuously (the oxidative
  burst) as one of the first lines of attack against pathogens []. ROS production
  is vital in acute inflammation, however, a too high production of ROS can cause
  DNA repair failure [] and modifications in proteins [], and are carcinogenic [].
  Intracellularly, most ROS are produced by the mitochondrial electron transport chain
  (ETC), which is also stimulated in response to TNF-α []. These ROS are important
  for apoptosis as well as cell maintenance, but also stimulate NF-κβ, inflammation
  and cancer []. ROS can also activate platelets []. (Platelets, orange) Platelets
  are derived from megakaryocytes, do not have a nucleus and are essential for hemostasis
  and thrombosis. However, platelets are also loaded with immune modulators, and can
  drive the inflammatory response. Platelets express NADPH oxidase (NOX) and are an
  important source of ROS []. Upon activation by thrombin or ROS, α-granules are secreted
  which contain (among others) fibrinogen, P-selectin and EGF (15)⁠. f = fibrinogen,
  Psel = P-selectin, EGF = endothelial growth factor, α = α-granules, β3 = β-integrin
  receptors, LPS = lipopolysaccharide, Plt = platelet, Nu = nucleus.
