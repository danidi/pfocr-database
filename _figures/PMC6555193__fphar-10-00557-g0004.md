caption: Cancer pathway gene set targeted only by natural products for a cancer driver
  target. Another Reactome functional interaction network (TP53 Regulates Transcription
  of Genes Involved in G1 Cell Cycle Arrest) targeted only by NPs at <100 nM (green
  border). No FDA-approved cancer drugs target this pathway with < 100 nM evidence.
  Cancer drivers are shown in yellow. In this pathway the NP target is also a cancer
  driver. Dashed lines are predicted interactions.
