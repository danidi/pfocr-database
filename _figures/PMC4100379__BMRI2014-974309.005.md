caption: The proposed mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of MLN4924 in prostate
  cancer cells. MLN4924 inactivates CRLs by inhibiting cullin neddylation and thus
  induces accumulation of CRLs substrates. These consequently trigger a series of
  critical cellular effects including DNA damage response, G2 cycle arrest, and apoptosis,
  which are responsible for growth suppression of prostate cancer cells. DDR, DNA
  damage response.
