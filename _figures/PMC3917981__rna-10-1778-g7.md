caption: Figure 7. Application of a translational regulator to construct complex genetic
  circuits. The following three examples use the crRNA-taRNA, a riboregulator that
  controls translation initiation (, Isaacs et al., 2004), to engineer different synthetic
  systems. (A) An adaptor that converts regulators from translational to transcriptional.
  By fusing an adaptor to a translational regulator, the translational regulator becomes
  transcriptional regulator. The adaptor consists of a Ribosomal Binding Site (RBS),
  an Open Reading Frame (ORF) of a short leader peptide (tnaC), and a transcription
  termination region. By fusing this element to the translational regulator (e.g.,
  crRNA-taRNA), translation of the adaptor is controllable (not shown). In the absence
  of the adaptor, regulation of GFP is at the translation initiation level by RBS
  sequestration. In contrast, by merging the adaptor, regulation of GFP is at the
  transcriptional elongation level; in this case, when the upstream translational
  regulator turns off synthesis of the adaptor, the transcription terminator in this
  element is exposed and arrests transcription of GFP (at the mRNA level). Likewise,
  when the translational regulator turns on synthesis of the adaptor, translation
  of GFP is activated at the protein level. (B) Riboregulated Transcription Cascade
  (RTC) with the ability to count. By arranging 3 genes controlled by the translational
  regulator (crRNA-taRNA) into a transcriptional cascade a genetic circuit is built
  with the ability to count. When PBAD promoter is not induced, the crRNA element
  present in each gene blocks translation of the T7 and T3 RNA Polymerase (RNAP),
  and GFP. In contrast, when PBAD is induced with arabinose, the level of fluorescence
  generated correlates with the number of pulses of arabinose fed into the system.
  (C) Switchboard for multi-sensing and metabolic pathway control. A series of rationally
  designed orthogonal variants of the crRNA-taRNA system (cr1, cr2…crn; taRNA1, taRNA2…taRNAn)
  are fused to multiple gene reporters (Reporter 1, Reporter 2…Reporter n) for simultaneous
  and independent regulation. The complex genetic circuit is arranged in parallel
  (each pair of crRNA-taRNA variants is under the control of a different promoter)
  to be able to sense multiple inputs and convert them into a measurable output (e.g.,
  enzymatic and/or fluorescence reads).
