caption: MicroRNA pathway in ESCs (embryonic stem cells). MiRNA genes can be organised
  in clusters as that of mir-290. Their biosynthesis starts in the nucleus when the
  RNA POL II generates a long primary transcript, with hairpin stem-loop structure,
  named pri-miRNA. The stem-loop cropping mediated by DROSHA/DGCR8 complex converts
  the pri-miRNA into a pre-miRNA, that reaches the cytoplasm through the EXPORTIN
  5-mediated transport. Here, a processing of the pre-miRNA terminal loop by the endonuclease
  DICER generates a small miRNA duplex as intermediate. The mature miRNA strand is
  guided by RISC to bind the mRNA target, promoting its degradation/destabilization.
  MiRNAs orchestrate important functions as cell cycle regulation, self-renewal and
  differentiation of ESCs.
