caption: (A) Under high glucose supply, most cancer cells perform glycolysis for biosynthesis,
  lactate is released. In many cancers, this aerobic glycolysis is facilitated by
  a downregulation of FBP1, since FBP1 inhibits glycolysis and glycolytic gene expression
  via enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. In some tumors, PCK1 or PCK2 act under
  high or moderate glucose concentrations to regulate TCA cycle flux. (B) Under glucose
  deprivation, many cancer cells exhibit abbreviated forms of gluconeogenesis via
  PCK1 or PCK2 and to some extent FBPase, which allows feeding of biosynthetic pathways
  from lactate or glutamine, if glucose is missing. This promotes cancer cell survival
  in the hostile, glucose-deprived microenvironment of solid cancers. Additionally,
  PCK1/2 have a regulatory function on the TCA cycle flux. PCK1/2 and/or FBP1/2 expression
  occurs in a context-dependent manner and is highly heterogenous among different
  cancers.
