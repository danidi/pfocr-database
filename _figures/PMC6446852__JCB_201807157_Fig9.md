caption: 'Working model. Two optic lobe neuroepithelial cells are represented in which
  the subapical region (SA) appears in green, the AJs in red, and the basolateral
  region (BL) in blue. Reverse Eph signaling at the level of the SA would be relevant
  for aPKC activation, and in turn, this would be key to fully activate P-myosin II
  (Sqh in Drosophila), which impinges on mitotic spindle orientation by contributing
  to the correct cortical localization of Cno, Dlg1, and Mud during mitosis. Forward
  Eph signaling would activate Rho-Rok signaling, which in turn would have two effects:
  (1) phosphorylate and activate myosin II (Sqh) and (2) keep the PI3K–Akt1 signaling
  pathway inhibited.'
