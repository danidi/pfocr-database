caption: Possible life cycle of SARS‐CoV‐2 and potential intervention strategy. Diagram
  showing the possible transmission, infection, and pathogenesis cycle of SARS‐CoV‐2.
  In the infection phase, SARS‐CoV‐2 attaches to the cellular receptor via the spike
  (S) protein or the transmembrane glycoprotein CD147 to enter the host cell by the
  endosomal pathway. At this point, the S protein is activated and cleaved by transmembrane
  protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to trigger membrane fusion. Then, SARS‐CoV‐2 releases
  its nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm to induce translation of ORF1a/b into the large
  replicase polyproteins 1a (pp1a) and pp1ab and replicates its genomic RNA. Subsequently,
  pp1a and pp1ab produce various non‐structural proteins (nsps), in which the RNA‐dependent
  RNA polymerase (RdRP), papain‐like protease (PLpro), and 3C‐like protease (3CLpro)
  are encoded. These replicases synthesize the full‐length negative‐sense antigenome
  template to produce new genomic RNA and further form the assembled virion, which
  is then released into the extracellular space by exocytosis. Uncontrolled replication
  promotes SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, leading to immune disturbances and inflammatory cytokine
  storms and eventually resulting in multiorgan functional damage, particularly in
  the lungs
