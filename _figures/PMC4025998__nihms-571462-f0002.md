caption: 'Schematic diagram of mechanism of white matter damage in SHR-SP. Hypoxia
  is postulated to be a key factor that triggers a series of molecular events. Generally
  there is hypertension, diabetes or other vasculopathic processes that restrict perfusion
  of the vulnerable deep white matter. Pyrol hydroxylase (PHD) is induced, leading
  to persistence of the HIF-1α. Multiple genes are activated, particularly MMP-2,
  which breaks down myelin and disrupts the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Vasogenic edema
  and oligodendrocytes death are the consequence of the hypoxia. Another pathway that
  includes the activation of inflammatory components induces MMP-3, MMP-9, and cyclooxygenase-2
  (COX-2), contributing to the tissue damage. The entire process occurs slowly through
  the stages characterized as three “hits”: 1) Hypertension damages blood vessels,
  limiting blood flow to deep white matter; 2) Hypoxia initiates the molecular injury
  cascade as well as the repair mechanisms, such as angiogenesis and erythropoesis;
  and 3) An inflammatory response completes the injury process.'
