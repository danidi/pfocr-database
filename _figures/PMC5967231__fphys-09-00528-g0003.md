caption: 'Simplified representation of the biosynthetic pathways of melatonin in plants
  and animals. Tryptophan is the common precursor of melatonin in all species. (A)
  In plants (green), melatonin is synthesized under two pathways: (1) tryptophan-tryptamine-serotonin-N-acetyl
  serotonin-melatonin pathway (under normal growth conditions); (2) tryptophan-tryptamine-serotonin-5-methoxytryptamine-melatonin
  pathway (upon senescence, when plants produce large amounts of serotonin); (B) In
  animals (red); tryptophan is converted in serotonin via hydroxytryptophan; (C) In
  both plants and animals (white), melatonin production from serotonin is the same
  two-step process and includes the conversion of serotonin to N-acetylserotonin by
  the rate-limiting enzyme AA-NAT (arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase) also called
  as serotonin N-acetyltransferase followed by the conversion of N-acetylserotonin
  to melatonin by acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase. CO2, carbon dioxide; TPH, tryptophan
  hydroxylase; AAAD, aromatic amino acid decarboxylase; SNAT, serotonin N-acetyltransferase;
  ASMT, N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase; TDC, tryptophan decarboxylase; T5H,
  tryptamine 5-hydroxylase.'
