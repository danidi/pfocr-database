caption: Redox regulation of signaling pathway leading to T-cell activation/proliferation.
  ROS are required for trigering different signaling pathways, which are required
  for proper activation and maturation of T cells. MAPK are known to activate Linker
  of activated T cells (LAT), which is responsible for TCR engagement. ERK-MAPK forms
  a negative feedback loop and represses LAT. NrF2 is required for activation of DCs.
  NFκB is required for maturation of APCs. FoxO1 is responsible for maintenance of
  naïve T cells by regulating L-selectin (CD62L) and CCR7. p38-MAPK is required for
  T-cell activation. All the above signaling pathways require ROS for activation.
  APCs, antigen-presenting cells; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinases; FoxO,
  forkhead transcription factors of class O; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase;
  NFκB, nuclear factor kappa B; NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2.
