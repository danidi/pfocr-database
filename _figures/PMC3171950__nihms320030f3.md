caption: '(A) KSHV latently infected endothelial cells within early KS lesions display
  an activated ATM/Chk2-mediated DDR, likely mediated through v-cyclin-driven cellular
  proliferation, centrosome duplication and LANA targeting of growth suppressive pathways.
  Later, KSHV latent infection is characterized by attenuated ATM/Chk2 signaling,
  which may be a result of selection of mutated DDR pathway components, disruption
  of cellular checkpoints, and LANA binding to p53. (B) KSHV lytic replication likely
  activates ATM, similarly to . To promote KSHV replication, the viral lytic product
  vIRF1 interacts with ATM and manipulates p53 function.ATM: Ataxia-telangiectasia
  mutated kinase; DDR: DNA damage response; KS: Kaposi’s sarcoma; KSHV: Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated
  herpesvirus; LANA: Latency-associated nuclear antigen.'
