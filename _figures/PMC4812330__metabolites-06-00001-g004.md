caption: Summary of major fluxes during defatting of steatotic HepG2s. Values shown
  are representative fluxes (reaction number is shown) for each major pathway from  estimated
  by MFA during defatting under normoxic conditions with basal medium (DMEM), medium
  supplemented with defatting agents, and under hyperoxic conditions with medium supplemented
  with defatting agents.
