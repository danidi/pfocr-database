caption: 'Proposed signalling model of the essential role of PI3Kγ in MCP-1-stimulated
  aortic smooth muscle cell as an amplifier of PDGF-induced cell migration. In aortic
  SMC migration, PI3Kγ is the major PI3K isoform implicated in MCP-1-induced PKB (Akt)
  phosphorylation. Moreover, PI3Kγ could play a role as an amplifier of PDGF-induced
  SMC migration by an autocrine/paracrine pathway. MCP-1 mRNA level is increased upon
  PDGF stimulation leading to MCP-1 secretion and CCR2 activation. Dashed lines indicate
  potential signalling mechanism not fully established at this time. Abbreviation:
  TKR, tyrosine kinase receptor; PDGF-RE, PDGF-responsive-element.'
