caption: Under normal conditions (i.e., steady-state myelopoiesis), Rb protein is
  de-phosphorylated via cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p21-dependent feedback
  mechanism and thus cannot interact with the C/EBPα protein, allowing it to bind
  and inactivate the miR-21 and miR-181b promoters. During sepsis, Rb is phosphorylated
  by a cyclin D1-cdk4 protein complex and interacts with and displaces the C/EBPα
  protein, thus allowing the Stat3 and C/EBPβ proteins to bind and activate the miR-21
  and miR-181b promoters. This differential regulatory pathway requires an IL-6-mediated
  signal.
