caption: Chemotherapy treatments cause inflammation and mucositis in the intestinal
  epithelium of cancer patients. The cartoon representing a healthy epithelium (A)
  shows a wide diversity of symbiotic bacteria in the lumen and some inactive immune
  cells in the lamina propia. Both spaces are separated by a mucosal barrier. When
  patients are treated with chemotherapy (B), the mucosal barrier is damaged and pathogenic
  bacteria coexist with symbiotic bacteria in gut microbiota. Then, intestinal epithelial
  cells suffer DNA damage and tissue injury/cell apoptosis mediated by the increase
  of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and cytokines signaling cascades. Cells affected
  by DNA damage release Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs), which together
  with Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) released by pathogenic bacteria,
  are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). This signal is transmitted by the
  NFκB pathway, leading to the release of cytokines such as IL-1B, which enhance neutrophil/macrophage
  infiltration. ROS levels are increased in macrophages and neutrophils producing
  proinflammatory cytokines, tissue injury and apoptosis. On the other hand, B-lymphocytes
  produce IgA against the pathogenic bacteria. When the mucosal barrier is broken
  and the tissue injury advances (C), pathogenic bacteria interact with immune cells,
  increasing ROS production and provoking the activation of TNF- α as well as cytokines
  production, such as IL-12, also triggering inflammation.
