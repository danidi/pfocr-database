caption: The Wnt signaling and its implications in the development of prostate cancer.
  (a) In an inactive state, the protein β-catenin is sequestered in a complex in the
  presence of Axin, GSK3β, CK1α, and APC. This complex allows ubiquitination of β-catenin
  and its subsequent degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner, maintaining this
  pathway inactive in the absence of Wnt. (b) After binding of Wnt to Frizzled receptor
  complex (which includes the adaptor molecules LRP5/LRP6), this allows the recruitment
  of Dishevelled (DVL) and Axin; the recruitment of Axin disrupts the inactivation
  complex and releases β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus and functions
  as a transcription factor, inducing expression of several genes related to proliferation,
  such as c-myc and cyclin D1. (c) In the PCa environment, β-catenin can combine with
  AR proteins, whose levels are typically increased in PCa, enhancing their function
  as transcription factors and leading to increased gene expression of pro-survival
  and proliferative factors.
