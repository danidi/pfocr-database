caption: Divergence in the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway. Humans convert AIR
  to CAIR using the enzyme AIR carboxylase with CO2 as the one-carbon source (top).
  Microbes convert AIR to N5-CAIR using the enzyme N5-CAIR synthetase and HCO3− as
  the one-carbon source along with ATP. The conversion of N5-CAIR to CAIR is conducted
  by the enzyme N5-CAIR mutase (bottom).
