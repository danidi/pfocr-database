caption: Simplified pathway for the synthesis of the GPI-core (based on Cardoso et
  al., ). Gene names are annotated with bold letters, followed by their current annotation
  in the TriTrypDB. In brackets are the T. cruzi locus identifiers of complete genes,
  followed by the haplotype to which they belong (P = Non-Esmeraldo; S = Esmeraldo).
  Sequences that have been identified as incomplete or pseudogenes are not included.
  Because the T. cruzi CL Brener sequences for GPI13 are incomplete for both haplotypes
  (TcCLB.503979.10-P and TcCLB.507667.11-S), the ID for the complete GPI13 gene for
  the T. cruzi Dm28c is used. Similarly, for the choline/ethanolamine kinase 2, for
  which both CL-Brener alleles encode for pseudogenes (TcCLB.487739.20-P; TcCLB.508805.30-S/TcCLB.511181.160-S)
  and therefore the full sequence from the T. cruzi Dm28c strain is used. Sequences
  classified as highly druggable (druggability index >0.7) according to the Target-Pathogen
  database (http://target.sbg.qb.fcen.uba.ar/patho/) are shown with green letters.
  Known drug classes that block enzymes within this pathway are identified by yellow
  boxes with blue letters. With a red box are highlighted the enzymes known to be
  essential in T. cruzi, and in orange boxes are highlighted enzymes that are essential
  in other trypanosomes. Enzymes that have been genetically manipulated to evaluate
  their potential role as therapeutic targets in T. cruzi (§), T. brucei (*), or Leishmania
  (♯) have been annotated with a symbol.
