caption: Overview of RIP3-dependent necrosis and inflammation. Ligation of TNF to
  TNF-R1 leads to the formation of complex I, where RIP1 is ubiquitinated by cIAP1/2
  and LUBAC. Deubiquitination of RIP1 by CYLD converts the signal from cell survival
  to cell death by facilitating the formation of complex II. Fas ligand and TRAIL
  also induce complex II formation. Active caspase-8 in this complex induces apoptosis
  and inhibits necrosis by cleaving RIP1, RIP3, and CYLD. When caspase-8 is inhibited,
  the amyloid RIP1/RIP3 necrosome is formed. Necrosome formation causes necrosis through
  the mitochondrial pathway mediated by MLKL, recruitment of PGAM5L and PGAM5s, and
  activation of Drp1. PGAM5 and Drp1 also mediate necrosis induced by ROS and calcium
  ionophore. TLR3 and TLR4 activation by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)
  such as dsRNA and LPS lead to RIP3 binding to TRIF and necrosis. For the T-cell
  receptor (TCR), the mechanism that activates RIP3-dependent necrosis is still unknown.
  Membrane rupture results in the release of DAMPs to an extracellular space where
  innate immune cells such as macrophages and DCs are located. These innate immune
  cells recognize DAMPs during infection or tissue damage to elicit an inflammatory
  cytokine response. Besides necrosis, RIP3 can also drive IL-1β production in caspase-8-deficient
  DCs or when IAP proteins are eliminated by SMs. (APC) Antigen-presenting cells;
  (MHC) major histocompatibility complex.
