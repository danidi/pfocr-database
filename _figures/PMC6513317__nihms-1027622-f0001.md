caption: 'TBI results in multiple pathological cascades involving acute cell loss,
  axonal injury, blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption, oxidative stress, inflammation,
  vascular damage and ischemia (1). There is considerable overlap in acute pathology
  in severe, rmTBI, and blast TBI despite the different injury mechanisms. All are
  characterized in part by accumulation of aggregation-prone molecules, however, the
  primary pathology of each depends on activation and propagation of different aggregated
  molecules chronically after TBI. Specifically, severe TBI is more closely associated
  with the activation of amyloidogenic pathway due to altered amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor
  protein (APP) metabolism and accumulation of Aβ peptides (2a), with secondary development
  of over-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) pathology, while the pathology of rmTBI and blast
  TBI is driven primarily by p-tau protein (2b) and secondary development of amyloidosis
  at more advanced age. In addition, aggregates of other proteins (ubiquitin; α-synuclein;
  transactive response DNA binding protein 43, TDP-43) can be initiated by all forms
  of TBI and contribute to the mixed proteinopathy of AD (3a) or dementia pugilistica,
  chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and parkinsonism (3b). Development and progression
  of these pathologies can be influenced by genetic factors (a) and aging (b,c), inflammation
  and comorbidities (c; vascular disease, depression, substance abuse), as well as
  defective clearance mechanisms involving dysregulation of ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal
  hydrolase isozyme L1 (UCH-L1) and the proteasome. Chronic neuronal injury combined
  with toxic intracellular inclusions ultimately results in cell death, loss of synapses
  and circuits, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms (4). Early intervention
  to prevent the initiation and/or propagation of pathological protein aggregates
  may be the key to breaking the link between TBI and chronic neurodegenerative diseases.
