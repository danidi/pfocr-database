caption: 'Some perifosine-specific genes are connected by common pathways leading
  to MAPK signalling pathway and apoptosis. Signal transduction pathways: ASP Akt
  signalling pathway; PSS, phosphatidylinositol signalling system; WSP: Wnt signalling
  pathway; VSP vascular endothelial growth factor signalling pathway; MSP, MAPK signalling
  pathway. Cell communication pathways: TJ, tight junction; AJ, adherens junction;
  FA, focal adhesion. Immune systems: TSP, T-cell receptor signalling pathway; BSP,
  B-cell receptor signalling pathway. The relationships among pathways were retrieved
  from the KEGG database (Release 45.0, January 1, 2008).'
