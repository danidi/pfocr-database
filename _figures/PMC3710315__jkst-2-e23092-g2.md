caption: Figure 2. Adipocytes are central players in responding to and producing STAT
  activating hormones. Adipose tissue is largely comprised of adipocytes but also
  contains preadipocytes and infiltrating immune cells, including NK cells, T cells
  and macrophages. Adipocytes are highly responsive to many hormones and growth factors
  that utilize the JAK-STAT pathway. The receptors for these ligands are indicated
  in the diagram. Infiltrating immune cells also produce cytokines that act in a paracrine
  fashion to activated STAT signaling in adipocytes. Adipocytes also have important
  endocrine properties and four JAK-STAT activating hormones have been shown to be
  produced from adipocytes.
