caption: Ornithine-urea cycle. This pathway is derived from that identified in diatoms.
  CPS, carbamoyl phosphate synthase; OTC, ornithine carbamoyltransferase; AsuS, argininosuccinate
  synthase; AsL, argininosuccinate lyase; Arg*, arginase (depicted twice, because
  it produces both ornithine and urea); Ure, urease.
