caption: TrkB inhibition decreases proliferation and survival pathways leading to
  a reduction of tumor growth and increased apoptosis and differentiation features
  in medulloblastoma (MB) cells. Scheme depicting mouse xenografted with MB cells.
  In the absence of TrkB antagonist, MB cells continue to grow at high proliferation
  rates. Treating mice with TrkB antagonist, ANA-12, promotes delay in tumor growth
  in vivo and cellular changes consistent with growth arrest, apoptosis and differentiation
  mediated by downregulation of ERK pathway, decreased KI67 and Nestin expression
  markers and increased expression of p21 and TUBB3 genes (modified from []).
