caption: 'Diagram showing effects of 4-HNE on Keap1- and GSK3β-mediated Nrf2 degradation.
  (A) Diagram showing the effects of 4-HNE on the “conforming cycle” in Keap1-mediated
  Nrf2 degradation. Left panel: under normal conditions, Keap1 binds to Nrf2 and guides
  it to the proteasome. At the proteasome, Keap1 is disassociated from Nrf2 and is
  recycled to bind newly synthesized Nrf2. Right panel: we discovered that 4-HNE interrupts
  both Keap1-Nrf2 binding and their disassociation, leading to a decrease in both
  Nrf2 degradation and Keap1 recycling; the latter then results in accumulation of
  newly synthesized Nrf2 which binds EpRE. We also showed that the inhibitory effect
  of 4-HNE on Keap1-Nrf2 binding is dependent on C288. (B) Diagram showing the effects
  of 4-HNE on GSK3β-mediated Nrf2 degradation via both direct and indirect pathways.
  In the indirect pathway, both 4-HNE and 4-HHE decrease PTEN activity, which further
  induces Akt phosphorylation and activation. Activated p-Akt inactivates GSK3β by
  phosphorylating S9 of GSK3β. We also discovered the direct pathway, in which 4-HNE
  directly inactivates GSK3β by adducting the C199 residue.'
