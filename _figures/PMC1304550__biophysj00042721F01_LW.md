caption: Downstream signaling elements in the cytoplasmic compartment. Shown are the
  details of the MLC phosphorylation/dephosphorylation module. The simulation system
  contains dynamic regulation of MLCK activity through Ca2+-CaM and MLCP activity
  through phosphorylation by Rho kinase and inhibition by phosphorylated CPI-17. CPI-17
  is phosphorylated by PKC that is activated by DAG produced by activated phospholipase
  C. RhoA that is generated by G-protein exchange with receptor activated G proteins
  activates Rho kinase, and cG kinase is activated by cGMP.
