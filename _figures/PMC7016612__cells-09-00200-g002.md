caption: DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) response pathway. (A) Homologous recombination
  (HR) repair pathway to combat DNA DSBs. Detection and recognition of DNA DSBs by
  the meiotic recombination 11-Rad50-nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 (MRN) complex (MRE11-RAD50-NBS1)
  triggers phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Activation of ATM
  results in the phosphorylation of several DNA damage response (DDR) kinases such
  as histone protein, H2A variant, H2AX, at Serine 139 to generate γH2AX, checkpoint
  kinase 2 (Chk2) and p53 (TAp63α in primordial oocytes), mediating the effects of
  ATM on DNA damage repair, cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. p63 induces cell-cycle
  arrest by activating the transcription of p21, which may hinder cell cycle progression
  through inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and Cdk 4 activity. Mediator
  DNA damage checkpoint protein 1 (MDC1) binds to γH2AX via breast cancer susceptibility
  gene 1 (BRCA1) and forms foci that co-localise with γH2AX. In oocytes, the DNA strand
  resection is activated and leads to homologous recombination (HR). Activation of
  HR generates single-strand DNA (ssDNA) at multiple steps and requires a specific
  factor, replication protein A (RPA). The ssDNA binding protein complex RPA in oocytes
  is replaced by Rad51 and meiotic cDNA1 (Dmc1). (B) Activated Chk2 promotes degradation
  of cell division cycle (Cdc25) and ultimately provokes cell cycle arrest through
  phosphorylation of Cdk2 and 4. Alternatively, in response to excessive or irreparable
  DNA damage, p63 may induce a cascade of apoptotic signalling pathway that requires
  transcriptional induction of p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and NOXA
  [,]. Apoptosis is controlled by the balance between pro-apoptosis B-cell lymphoma
  2 (Bcl2) and anti-apoptosis B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-associated X (BAX) activity. (C)
  An interplay of dimeric to the tetrameric formation of TAp63α. Phosphorylation of
  TAp63α ultimately transforms the inactive dimeric form of TAp63α to the active tetrameric
  form (figure adapted from [,,]).
