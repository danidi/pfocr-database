caption: 'RefSeq IDs for 33 of the top 56 sites that mapped to genes were uploaded
  onto the “Core Analysis” tool of IPA. The second-highest scoring molecular interaction
  network was constructed by 35 nodes, 12 of which were located on the input list
  (shaded nodes), and is associated with the cell cycle, cellular function and maintenance,
  and connective tissue development and function. The nodal relationships are indicated
  by solid lines (direct interaction) and dashed lines (indirect interactions), with
  or without filled arrows indicating functional interaction or merely physical association,
  respectively. Additionally, filled arrows that are preceded by a terminal bar indicate
  inhibition as well as functional interaction. The shape of each node indicates the
  class of molecule: horizontal ovals are transcription factors, squares are growth
  factors, vertical rectangles are ion channels while horizontal rectangles are nuclear
  receptors, inverted triangles are kinases, vertical diamonds are enzymes while horizontal
  diamonds are peptidases, trapezoids are transporters, and circles correspond to
  “other” molecules. In alphabetical order, this network consists of BUD31, CECR1,
  Collagen(s), CPN1, CRY1, DHX8, FAM110B, FGF2, GIN1, GRIK4, HNF4A, INO80D, KNG1,
  LPIN3, MAP3K3, MPRIP, MRTO4, NOC3L, PPARA, PRICKLE4, PRSS3, RSF1, RUVBL2, SLC31A1,
  SLC35A1, SLC35A5, SLC39A1, SMARCA5, SPAST, TGFB1, TSKU, UXT, WRNIP1, XPNPEP2, and
