caption: Polarized trafficking of Wnt proteins and receptors. Wnt3a, Wnt5a and Wnt5b
  are secreted basolaterally, and Wnt11 is secreted apically. Wnt1 is secreted in
  both ways. Wnt receptor frizzled2 is localized to the basolateral membrane, and
  Frizzled7 is localized to both apical and basolateral membranes. Wnt co‐receptors
  are localized to specific membrane domains (e.g. basolateral membrane, LRP6 and
  Ror2; apical membrane, Ryk). DKK1 is secreted apically. Fz, Frizzled; Ryk, receptor‐like
  tyrosine kinase.
