caption: An integrated network for phenylpropanoid regulation in the grape berry.
  Circle, diamond, square, and triangle nodes represent enzyme-coding genes, transcription
  factors (TFs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and micro RNAs (miRNAs), respectively.
  Gray and light blue solid edges connecting circle and square nodes depict positive
  and negative RNA-Seq-derived co-expression correlations, respectively. Dashed and
  dotted lines depict predicted miRNA-gene interaction and lncRNA-gene co-location
  (within 100 kb). Clusters I, II and III connect genes belonging to the early phenylpropanoid
  and flavonoid (ePP and Fla) sub-pathways. Cluster IV shows a dense group containing
  predominantly PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE (PAL) and STILBENE SYNTHASE (STS) genes
  that are largely co-expressed with positive co-expression correlations. Purple edges
  represent positive co-expression correlations between TFs and early phenylpropanoid
  pathway genes. Pie chart colors represent the presence of selected TF-binding sites
  (based on cis-regulatory element enrichment analysis) in promoter regions of the
  corresponding enzyme-coding genes. Light blue border edges depict STS genes located
  in chromosome 10.
