caption: Summary of the strategy of MAH related to mucosal epithelial cell adhesion
  and invasion. (A) Biofilm formation and eDNA export, which greatly contributes to
  colonization, persistence and drug resistance, are important survival strategies
  for MAH. MAH lipoprotein (LprB) and GPL-related genes are involved in biofilm formation,
  and biofilms are involved in adhesion to mucosal epithelium and non-biological surfaces
  including PVC pipes, shower heads, and hot tubs. (B) MAH binds to host proteins
  such as vimentin, and attaches to epithelial cells, and planktonic bacteria are
  rapidly recruited to form microaggregates. Furthermore, the MAH microaggregates
  interact with the host protein filamin A through MIP-1 and further manipulate the
  host cytoskeleton to efficiently invade the host epithelium. (C) MAH can effectively
  invade mucosal epithelial cells by cytoskeletal rearrangement of host cells by activating
  the Cdc42 signaling pathway by fadD2, cipA, and other downstream transcriptional
  regulators. CipA, a domain similar to the PXXP motif of the human piccolo protein;
  eDNA, extracellular DNA; Fad2, fatty acyl coenzyme A synthase; GPL, glycopeptidolipid;
  LrpB, leucine-responsive regulatory protein B; MBP-1, microaggregate binding protein
  1; MIP-1, microaggregate invasion Protein-1.
