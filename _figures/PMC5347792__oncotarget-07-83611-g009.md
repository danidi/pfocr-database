caption: Gal-1 (purple arrow) can modulate the non-canonical Hedgehog pathway by increasing
  the transcription of Gli-1 without the altering the expression of sonic hedgehog
  (SHH) or smoothened (SMO). Accumulated Gli-1 translocates to the nucleus, resulting
  in activation of EMT-related genes, leading to the EMT switch in cancer cells. A.
  Earlier studies suggested autocrine signaling by the SHH ligand was functionally
  important in the context of Ras activation (green arrow) in gastric cancer cells.
  SHH signaling in cancer cells was thought to occur via canonical hedgehog signaling,
  whereby SHH binds to Ptch and induces SMO signaling resulting in activation of Gli-1.
  Previous studies demonstrated Gli-1 can be upregulated by Ptch in the presence of
  SHH, which establishes a negative feedback loop (orange arrow). Silencing Gal-1
  B. abrogated these effects, including the negative feedback loop and the ability
  of SHH to bind to PTCH resulting in activation of SMO.
