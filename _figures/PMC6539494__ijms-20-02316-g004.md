caption: IPA analysis of the genes whose expressions were significantly altered when
  all cells were considered indicated that (A) TP53 is the primary response to radiation
  exposure in human T cells after 2 Gy gamma irradiation, and (B) activation of the
  STAT1/IRF1 signaling pathway in the irradiated cells.
