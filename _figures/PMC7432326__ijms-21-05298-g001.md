caption: Mode of 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) action inside and outside the cell.
  (1) During unstressed conditions, heat shock factor (HSF)1 exists as a monomer in
  complex with cytoplasmic Hsp70. Upon cellular stress (e.g., inflammation), HSF1
  accumulates in the nucleus and binds to the heat shock element (HSE) that is found
  in the upstream regulatory regions of the Hsp70 gene. (2) Intracellular Hsp70 blocks
  NF-κB activation. (3) Acting as damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), extracellular
  Hsp70 interacts with TLR2/4 and activates the inflammatory pathway via NF-κB in
  antigen presenting cells (APC). (4) Extracellular Hsp70 leads to Treg expansion.
  Hsp70-derived peptides are delivered to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
  class II molecules and presented on the cell surface for recognition by Treg. (5)
  Extracellular Hsp70 stimulates the humoral autoimmune response and production of
  the anti-Hsp70 autoantibodies. (6) Extracellular Hsp70 enhances immunosuppressive
  function of Treg cells via the TLR2 signaling pathway. Dotted lines illustrate translocation
  of Hsp70 across the cell membrane.
