number: Figure 14
caption: (a) Synthesis of polyacrylamide/chitosan (PAM/CS) interpenetrating (PAM/CS
  IPN) hydrogels; (b) polypyrrole was absorbed into the IPN hydrogel, fixed on CS
  chains, and accumulated in the zone of CS entanglement; (c) polypyrrole (PPy) was
  polymerized in situ in the hydrogel under the controlling of CS molecular templates;
  PPy-conductive pathway (purple line) intertwisted along CS chains (purple line),
  and PPy nanorods aggregated on the chain entanglement zone of CS hydrogels for repairing
  full thickness defects on rats. (d) Schematics of hydrogel implantation and conductive
  properties of the hydrogel. (e) H&E (histomorphological evaluation) staining of
  wound sections after 21 days; S, sample; BV, blood vessel. (f) PPy–PAM/CS hydrogel
  was connected to a circuit and illuminated an LED; (g) conductivity of the PPy–PAM/CS
  hydrogel with different contents of PPy [].
