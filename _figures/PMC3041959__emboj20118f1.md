caption: Schematic of proposed Atg1/myosin/Atg9 signalling pathway. Upon activation
  by starvation, Atg1/Ulk1 phosphorylates and activates Sqa/ZIPk, which in turn phosphorylates
  Sqh/MLC to activate myosin II. Myosin drives trafficking of Atg9-containing membranes,
  which derive from fission of the trans-Golgi network (TGN), to the sites of autophagosome
  nucleation, the isolation membrane. Note that this model combines the data from
  Drosophila and human cells, and some details have not yet been confirmed in both
  organisms.
