caption: 'The energy is produced in mitochondria from oxygen and glucose through a
  cascade of events: glycolysis → pyruvate decarboxylation → citric-acid cycle → oxidative
  phosphorylation. During glycolysis, glucose in the cytosol is broken down into pyruvate.
  In the anaerobic pathway, pyruvate is converted into lactate, while in the high-energy
  production aerobic pathway, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-coenzyme A, which enters
  the citric acid cycle. Acetyl-coenzyme A is first converted to citrate, then to
  α-ketoglutarate; α-ketoglutarate converts to succinyl-coenzyme A, and then succinate;
  succinate is transformed to fumarate, and then malate; malate is converted to oxaloacetate.
  The process of oxidative phosphorylation uses NADH2 and FADH2, produced in the glycolysis
  and in the acid citric cycle. NADH2 and FADH2 transfer electrons to the ETC, where
  oxidative phosphorylation occurs. NADH+H transfers the electrons to the complex
  I of ETC, while the FADH2 produced in mitochondrial matrix carries electrons to
  ETC complex II. The electrons pass from ETC complex I and complex II to coenzyme
  Q, and then to ETC complex III, and eventually to complex IV, where they are combined
  with O2 to generate H2O. In each electron passage, there is energy production and
  hydrogen ions are transported to the intermembrane space, generating an electrochemical
  gradient. Through ETC complex V the hydrogen ions go back to matrix using the electrochemical
  gradient to produce ATPs.ETC: Electron transport chain.'
