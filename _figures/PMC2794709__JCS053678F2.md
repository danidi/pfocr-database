caption: O-GlcNAc and phosphate regulate the insulin signaling pathway  at the plasma
  membrane. (A) In the basal state, OGT is concentrated  in the nucleus of the insulin-responsive
  cell. (B) Upon insulin (I)  binding to its receptor (IR), active PI3K catalyzes
  the phosphorylation of the  plasma-membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate  [PtdIns(4,5)P2;
  PIP2] to  PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3), driving the translocation of OGT  from the nucleus
  to the plasma membrane by its binding to  PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. OGT is then tyrosine
  phosphorylated by  active IR. This occurs simultaneously with the activation of
  other molecules  of the pathway such as phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1),
  IRS-1 and  Akt, which is mediated in part by phosphorylation events. (C) Active  OGT
  can now O-GlcNAcylate substrates of the pathway, including IR,  IRS-1, Akt and OGT
  itself. O-GlcNAcylation of IRS-1 occurs in  parallel with its phosphorylation at
  several serine residues that are known to  inactivate IRS-1. Comparatively, O-GlcNAcylation
  of Akt inhibits its  (activating) phosphorylation at a threonine residue, thereby
  inhibiting its  kinase activity. Thus, the overall effect of O-GlcNAcylation of  insulin
  signaling molecules leads to attenuation of the pathway.
