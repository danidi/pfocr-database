caption: Model illustrating the regulation of RBR3 expression by the RBR1/E2F pathway
  and the roles of the maize pocket proteins in cell-cycle control. In RepA-expressing
  callus, the block on E2F/DP is relieved as RBR1 is inhibited. As a result, S-phase
  genes are up-regulated, leading to cell proliferation. RBR3 is also up-regulated,
  but it also might be inhibited by RepA. It remains to be determined whether RBR3
  can interact with E2F family members and with which specificities. The intriguing
  up-regulation of RBR3, as a result of RepA expression, also suggests an alternative
  and potentially novel positive role of RBR3 in the cell cycle (large arrow).
