caption: Schematic diagram of MT1G as a tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer cells through
  regulating the PI3K/Akt and Rb/E2F pathways.MT1G restoration inhibited phosphorylation
  of Akt, leading to inhibition of cell growth. MT1G decreased Mdm2 expression through
  inhibiting the activity of Akt kinases. MT1G increased the stability of p53 and
  E-cadherin by the decreased ubiquitination of Mdm2, contributing to induction of
  cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and suppression of cell migration and invasion.
  MT1G also influenced cell growth, such as cell cycle progression and cell death,
  through inhibiting phosphorylation of Rb.
