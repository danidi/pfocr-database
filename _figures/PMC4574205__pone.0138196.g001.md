caption: Possible pathways leading to the formation of the ketocarotenoids canthaxanthin
  and astaxanthin, which can be formed from β-carotene through reactions catalyzed
  by ketolase and hydroxylase enzymes. The crtB gene encodes a phytoene synthase enzyme
  that catalyzes the formation of phytoene. A “*” indicates a β-carotene ketolase,
  such as the ketolases encoded by the crtW or bkt1 genes used in this study. This
  enzyme can use different substrates, so its final products depend on the substrates
  available.
