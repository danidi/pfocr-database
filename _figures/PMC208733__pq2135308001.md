caption: Regulation of the Foxa and Foxo transcription factors through PI3-kinase
  signaling. Protein kinases of the Akt/PKB and SGK families (for review, see ref.
  ) downstream of 3′ polyphosphoinositides generated by PI3-kinase mediate phosphorylation
  and cytoplasmic localization of Foxa2 and three Foxo isoforms. Thus, insulin, IGF-1,
  and other regulators of PI3-kinase attenuate transcriptional activity of these proteins.
  Foxa2 regulates gene expression in the context of Foxa1 and Foxa3 actions, which
  are not regulated by PI3-kinase. Overlapping but distinct specificities of the Foxa
  and Foxo proteins for promoter sequences provide a complex network of transcriptional
  signals that can finely modulate sets of genes (A, B, C, and D) in a metabolic or
  developmental pathway.
