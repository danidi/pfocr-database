caption: Immune activation, induced by mutant huntingtin, occurs both peripherally
  and centrally in HD. A cell-autonomous effect of the mutant protein may be responsible
  for the innate immune response. The NF-κB signaling pathway that triggers IL-6 release
  is known to be up-regulated by mutant huntingtin (reference ), and microglia-derived
  toxicity can influence disease progression (references  and ). We find that the
  innate immune response detectable in plasma very early in the disease is strongly
  linked to disease progression and recapitulated in HD striatum, that human monocytes
  express mutant huntingtin, and that monocytes, macrophages, and microglia overexpress
  IL-6 when stimulated. Early innate immune activation could be a target in the development
  of disease-modifying therapies.
