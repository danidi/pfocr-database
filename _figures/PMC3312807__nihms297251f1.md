caption: 'The cellular response to DNA damage is initiated by proteins that sense
  the damage and signal to mediator proteins. Mediator proteins reinforce the signaling
  by a cascade of post-translational modifications including phosporylation, acetylation,
  ubiquitination, and SUMOylation, and there is extensive crosstalk between these
  modifications. Together, signaling from these DNA damage response proteins coordinate
  cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. All of these nodes are targeted by viruses, underscoring
  the importance of gaining control of this pathway. Studying where viruses interface
  with the DNA damage response will likely reveal new nodes or regulators of this
  important cellular pathway.Abbreviations: Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1), Human
  T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1), Simian Virus 40 (SV40), Human Immunodeficiency
  Virus 1 (HIV-1), Adenovirus (AAV), Minute Virus Mice (MVM), Human Papillomavirus
  (HPV), Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)'
