caption: Schematic diagram of proposed Ca2+signaling in ECs exposed to shear stress.
  Shear stress, mainly via ATP binding to P2Y2R, is thought to activate the G protein/PLC/IP3pathway.
  IP3 activates the IP3R and causes Ca2+ release from the ER, which at high concentrations
  may deactivate the IP3R in the subcellular region between ER and mitochondria. Both
  [Ca2+]mt uptake via the MCU and [Ca2+]mt release via the mNCX may differentially
  regulate the activation of IP3R locally and, thus, play a role in shaping the first
  [Ca2+]i transient and, in particular, the subsequent oscillations. [Ca2+]mt release
  is thought to also help refill the ER store via the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum
  Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA).
