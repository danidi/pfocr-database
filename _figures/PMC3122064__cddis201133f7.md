caption: Simplified model showing the role of the MDM2/p53 axis in regulating the
  sensitivity to cisplatin and Nutlin-3 in wild-type p53-expressing TC cells. P53
  is a transcriptional activator of p21, Fas and MDM2. Cisplatin sensitive TC cells
  have low levels of p21 and cisplatin-resistant TC cells, due to higher CDKN1A expression
  levels and lower levels of Oct4 and miR-106b family members, high levels of cytoplasmic
  p21, which is a key determinant of resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Cisplatin-induced
  apoptosis in TC cells also involves activation of the Fas death receptor pathway
  via elevated Fas membrane expression. High cytoplasmic p21 levels inhibit Fas death
  receptor-mediated apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant TC cells. Moreover, cisplatin-induced
  DNA damage activates p53 and enhances release of p53 from MDM2–p53 complex, while
  sustained MDM2–p53 complex formation is found in cisplatin-resistant cells. Interfering
  in MDM2–p53 complex formation by Nutlin-3 treatment (or suppression of MDM2) substantially
  induces Fas expression, resulting in apoptosis of both cisplatin sensitive and resistant
  TC cells. Cisplatin in combination with Nutlin-3 further enhances Fas expression
  and sensitises cisplatin-sensitive and resistant TC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis.

  description: Simplified model showing the role of the MDM2/p53 axis in regulating
    the sensitivity to cisplatin and Nutlin-3 in wild-type p53-expressing TC cells.
    P53 is a transcriptional activator of p21, Fas and MDM2. Cisplatin sensitive TC
    cells have low levels of p21 and cisplatin-resistant TC cells, due to higher CDKN1A
    expression levels and lower levels of Oct4 and miR-106b family members, high levels
    of cytoplasmic p21, which is a key determinant of resistance to cisplatin-induced
    apoptosis. Cisplatin-induced apoptosis in TC cells also involves activation of
    the Fas death receptor pathway via elevated Fas membrane expression. High cytoplasmic
    p21 levels inhibit Fas death receptor-mediated apoptosis in cisplatin-resistant
    TC cells. Moreover, cisplatin-induced DNA damage activates p53 and enhances release
    of p53 from MDM2–p53 complex, while sustained MDM2–p53 complex formation is found
    in cisplatin-resistant cells. Interfering in MDM2–p53 complex formation by Nutlin-3
    treatment (or suppression of MDM2) substantially induces Fas expression, resulting
    in apoptosis of both cisplatin sensitive and resistant TC cells. Cisplatin in
    combination with Nutlin-3 further enhances Fas expression and sensitises cisplatin-sensitive
    and resistant TC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Dotted lines indicate interaction
