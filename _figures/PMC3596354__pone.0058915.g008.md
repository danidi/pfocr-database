caption: In malignant HaCaT cells exposed to CaA, p38 decreases the DNA-binding activity
  of NF-κB to the snail promotor, which results in the transcriptional down-regulation
  of snail. Such molecular process causes the inhibition of CSCs-like properties and
  migratory capacity of malignant HaCaT cells.
