caption: Membrane breaches in dysferlin-deficient skeletal muscle release damage-associated
  molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), which include endogenous TLR ligands such as
  ssRNA and ATP. These ligands bind to their respective receptors (ssRNA to TLR-7/8
  and ATP to P2x7 receptor; step 1). Signalling through these receptors activates
  the inflammasome pathway in skeletal muscle as well as immune cells, leading to
  the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF OPN (step 2). These
  cytokines activate immune cells and exacerbate the inflammatory response and damage
  to skeletal muscle, leading to a self-sustaining disease.
