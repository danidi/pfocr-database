caption: 'Comparison of Nrf1 and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)
  activation pathway. The SREBP precursor is inserted into the ER, and both the amino-terminal
  transcription factor domain and the carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain are located
  in the cytoplasmic compartment. When the cellular demand for sterols rises, the
  SREBP precursor protein travels to the Golgi apparatus and is processed by site-1
  protease (S1P) and site-2 protease (S2P). Then, the transcription factor domain
  released from the membrane enters the nucleus and induces the transcription of target
  genes. In contrast, the transcription activation domain of Nrf1 is initially in
  the ER lumen, which is topologically distinct to SREBP and other ER-resident transcription.
  Inhibition of NGLY1 results in the accumulation of glycosylated, unprocessed Nrf1.
  Inhibition of DDI2 leads the generation of a deglycosylated but unprocessed DDI2
  that enters the nucleus while inactive. Thus, Nrf1 needs the proper sequential treatment
  for its activation. The transcription activation domain is represented as pink square.
  TM: transmembrane, PS: processing site.'
