caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the signaling pathways involved in 8-PK's
  inhibition of RANTES production in H1N1-infected A549 cells. After viral ssRNA binding
  to TLR, the adaptor protein MyD88 couples TLR and IRAK. Subsequently, MyD88 mediates
  a signaling cascade in TLR-triggered cells that leads to activation of IKK-IκB-NFκB
  pathways and control inflammatory genes expression include RANTES. The core IKK
  complex consists of the kinases IKKα and IKKβ and the regulatory IKKγ/NEMO protein.
  The activation of IKKα/β depends on phosphorylation of serines at their activation
  loop. This process probably involves phosphorylation by recruit upstream kinases
  such as TAK1 leading to the rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ultimately
  proteolytic degradation of IκB, which frees NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus,
  where it regulates RANTES gene transcription. The suppression of H1N1-induced RANTES
  production by 8-PK may occur through downregulate IκB degradation and NF-κB nuclear
  translocation. Whether 8-PK interfere undefined upstream TAK1-IKK events to suppress
  RANTES production needed further study. An alternative pathway regulating RANTES
  production is via PI3K pathway. This leads to the activation of Akt, a cytosolic
  serine/threonine kinase that acts downstream of PI3K, and subsequently phosphorylation
  of IRF-3, a transcription factor that regulate RANTES gene expression. We found
  that 8-PK also can target at PI3K to block PI3K-mediated Akt phosphorylation and
  downregulate subsequently either NF-κB nuclear translocation or IRF-3 phosphorylation
  in A549 cells reciprocally to suppress RANTES production. ssRNA, single strand RNA;
