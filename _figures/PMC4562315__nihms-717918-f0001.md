caption: The core inhibitory kinase module is composed of two groups of kinases, the
  mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1) and MST2, and the large tumour suppressor
  1 (LATS1) and LATS2, in combination with their activating adaptor proteins, salvador
  family WW domain-containing protein 1 (SAV1), MOB kinase activator 1A (MOB1A) and
  MOB1B. The transcriptional module is composed of the transcriptional co-activators
  yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralogue, transcriptional co-activator with
  PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), and the TEA domain family members (TEAD1–TEAD4). When the
  upstream kinase module is activated, LATS1 and LATS2 phosphorylate YAP and TAZ,
  which leads to inhibition of the transcriptional activity through 14-3-3-mediated
  cytoplasmic retention of YAP and TAZ priming them for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal
  degradation,. Neurofibromin 2 (NF2) is an additional and potent activator of LATS1
  and LATS2 (indicated by the dashed arrow) but is devoid of kinase activity. A yet
  unidentified kinase (or several of them) may directly phosphorylate LATS1 and LATS2
  on the key activation site(s) in a MST1- and MST2-independent manner (indicated
  by the dashed arrow); when this site is not phosphorylated, the Hippo–LATS pathway
  is ‘off’. When YAP and TAZ are not phosphorylated by LATS kinases, they translocate
  to the nucleus and bind to sequence specific transcription factors TEAD1–TEAD4 (and
  other transcription factors, such as SMAD, RUNX, TP73, TBX5 and PAX), which enables
  the transcription of target genes encoding proteins that are involved in cell proliferation
  and survival,. AMOTL2, angiomotin-like protein 2; AREG, amphiregulin; BIRC5, baculoviral
  IAP repeat-containing protein 5; CTGF, connective tissue growth factor; CYR61, cysteine-rich
  angiogenic inducer 61; TF, transcription factor.
