caption: Narni-Mancinelli et al. showed that CFP is a self-derived ligand for natural
  cytotoxicity receptor NKp46. CFP-coated plates activated an alternative signaling
  pathway, which did not induce degranulation but rather the secretion of chemokine
  Xcl1. These data suggest that microbes opsonized with CFP stimulate NK cells to
  release Xcl1, which induces an antibacterial response (left image). These authors
  also showed that NKp46 was required for the control of Neisseria meningitidis infection
  in vivo. In a traditional scenario, NKp46 binding to target cells triggers a cytotoxic
  response through the phosphorylation of its associated ITAM-bearing signal adapter
  proteins CD3ζ and FcεRIγ (right image). A kinase of the Src family phosphorylates
  ITAMs, which recruit tyrosine kinases Syk and ZAP70. Reorganization of the cytoskeleton
  and Ca2+-dependent degranulation results in the polarized release of lytic granule
  content. Reflecting the lack of an identified non-pathogen-derived NKp46 ligand
  on infected cells or tumor cells, the activation of NK cells by NKp46 has primarily
  been studied using antibodies to either crosslink NKp46 (right image) or block NKp46-dependent
  target-cell killing. Selected genes either upregulated (Up) or downregulated (Down)
  after stimulation with CFP (left image) or anti-NKp46 antibody (right image) are
  listed. CFP, complement factor P; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation
  motif; NK, natural killer.
