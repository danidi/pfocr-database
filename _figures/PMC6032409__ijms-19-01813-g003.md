caption: The signaling pathway that results in the production of tumor necrosis factor
  alpha (TNF-α) in macrophages after the stimulation by lead and lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS). Lead increases the expression of TNF-α in LPS-treated cells via post-transcriptional
  mechanisms. It thus increases the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is uptaken
  by the CD14 receptor (cluster of differentiation 14) and its co-receptor TLR 4 (Toll-like
  receptor TLR 4). The diagram shows some of the transmitters potentially mediating
  the regulation of TNF-α expression. The signal is transmitted via the MyD88 adapter
  protein (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88). One of the activated
  pathways is the MAPK pathway. MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase),
  MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases), and activator protein 1 (AP-1) are activated.
  The NF-κB factor (nuclear factor kappa B) activation pathway is also stimulated
  by the regulation of IKKs (IκB kinase) activity. The resulting AP-1 and NF-κB lead
  to enhanced transcription of TNF-α mRNA. PI3K–AKT pathway is also activated. Attachment
  of LPS to the receptor leads to the phosphorylation of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase),
  which then activates AKT (protein kinase B). There is a mutual adjustment between
  the NF-κB and PI3K–AKT signaling pathways. The activation of the above-mentioned
  signaling pathways by LPS and Pb results in enhanced TNF-α synthesis.
