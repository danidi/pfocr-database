caption: Glutamate metabolism pathway as described for S. cerevisiae (http://www.yeastgenome.org/).
  Genes indicated in red are up-regulated in C. parapsilosis following addition of
  farnesol, the expressions of genes indicated in black are not reproducibly altered,
  and genes indicated in gray are not present on our arrays.
