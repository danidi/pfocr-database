caption: The glyoxylate cycle as proposed by Kornberg and Krebs 50 years ago. The
  citric acid cycle is modified to bypass the two decarboxylation steps by the action
  of its two key enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. This allows the net
  synthesis of malate from two molecules of acetyl-CoA.
