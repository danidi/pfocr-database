caption: Hyperglycemia-induced pathways leading to epigenetic alteration. Schematic
  representation of hyperglycemia-induced epigenetic modifications. Hyperglycemia
  first enhances oxidative damage, which activates several pathways such as the hexosamine
  pathway, PKC, AGE/RAGE pathway. All these pathways contribute to the modifications
  of the histone code and activate the NF-κB transcription factor. Moreover, they
  are inducing alterations in DNA methylation. These modifications lead to epigenetic
  alteration, which contribute to maintaining the metabolic memory, leading to neurovascular
  dysfunction in DR.
