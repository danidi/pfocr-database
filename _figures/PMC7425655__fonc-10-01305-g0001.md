caption: Summary of melanin chemiexcitation pathway. NOS and NOX enzymes are upregulated
  by UV exposure or endogenous factors, leading to generation of NO·, and O2·−, which
  instantly combine to produce ONOO−. The peroxynitrite oxidizes melanin an excited
  triplet state melanin-carbonyl which has energy equivalent to a UV photon. The melanin
  monomer 5,6-dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid (DHICA) is used as an example. This
  carbonyl donates its energy to DNA through radiationless transfer, generating pyrimidine
  dimers in the dark. The remaining carbonyl molecule implements reactive carbonyl
  species (RNS). Complete details of the chemiexcitation pathway are explained in
  Premi et al. ().
