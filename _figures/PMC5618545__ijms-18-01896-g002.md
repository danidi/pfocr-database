caption: Once residing at the plasma membrane, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
  regulator (CFTR) forms a complex with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2 (NHERF2)
  and lysophosphatidic acid receptor 2 (LPA2), which couples the LPA2-mediated signaling
  with CFTR channel activity in a compartmentalized manner. Upon activation of LPA2,
  adenylyl cyclase (AC) is inhibited through Gipathway, leading to a decreased cAMP
  level in proximity to CFTR and consequently inhibiting CFTR channel function. For
  clarity, only the major signaling molecules involved in this macromolecular complex
  are depicted here.
