caption: 'Biosynthetic pathways for thiamine and GSH. (A) Our current understanding
  of thiamine biosynthesis in S. enterica. Enzymes for each of the reactions are indicated
  above the relevant arrows. Enzymes that have not been demonstrated but are predicted
  to function at certain steps in thiamine biosynthesis are in parentheses. The nitrogen
  and carbon atoms donated by tyrosine are boxed in the THZ structure. The position
  of ThiH with respect to ThiG, -F, and -S is based partially on work reported here.
  (B) The GSH biosynthetic pathway. Abbreviations: PRPP, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate;
  Gln, glutamine; AIR, 5-aminoimidazole ribotide; THZ-P, 4-methyl-5-β-hydroxyethyl-thiazole
  monophosphate; HMP-PP, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine pyrophosphate;
  TMP, thiamine monophosphate; TPP, thiamine pyrophosphate.'
