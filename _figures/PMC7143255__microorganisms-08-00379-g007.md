caption: The WG diet induced metabolism of SCFA and metabolism of fatty acids. (a)
  Propanoate; (b) Acetate; (c) Fatty acid. All of the highlighted enzymes were increased
  by the WG diet. The drawing of the pathways was adapted from KEGG pathway databases.
  Some steps from the original pathways are not presented in the figures.
