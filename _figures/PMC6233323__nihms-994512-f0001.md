caption: 'Canonical Notch signaling takes place between two juxtaposed cells (left:
  signal sending cell, right: signal receiving cell). Different steps of signal activation
  and functions of molecules depicted here are described in detail in the main text.
  Note that some players depicted here only regulate Notch signaling in specific contexts.
  Abbreviations for proteins shown are based on FlyBase gene symbol nomenclature (also
  see ).'
