caption: (A) HCV entrance into the host cell using PI3K/Akt pathway. Hepatitis C virus
  uses a pH-dependent way in order to enter the intracellular environment of the host.
  The virus causes the lipids on the cellular surface to cluster (depicted in the
  figure through a yellow lining of the membrane), thus triggering the process of
  endocytosis mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (). (B) miR-199a-5p proposed
  effect on PI3K/Akt pathway during HCV infection. HCV infection activates the PI3K
  member of the signaling pathway with the help of a viral protein known as Non-structural
  protein 5A (NS5A) (a). PI3K is a heterodimer formed by the two subunits, p85 and
  p110. The first one to be phosphorylated is the p85 subunit, followed by p110. This
  process represents the catalyst of the conversion between phosphatidylinositol 4,5
  -bisphosphate (PIP2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 -trisphosphate (PIP3) (b). PIP3
  then activates Protein kinase B (Akt) through phosphorylation (c). Signals produced
  by the virus in order to survive determine an inhibitory phosphorylation, mediated
  by the Akt, of the intracellular agents causing apoptosis, such as BCL2 associated
  agonist of cell death (BAD), which in turn leads to the suppression of the Caspase
  Cascade (d). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1),
  an important transcription factor (e), stops it from translocating into the nucleus,
  therefore leading to an inhibition upon the pro-apoptotic genes expression (f).
  Prior studies have demonstrated the fact that the overexpression of miR-199a-5p
  plays an important role in enhancing the pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway. Their results
  have shown that by decreasing the miR-199a-5p levels, the phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt)
  levels are also significantly diminished, therefore leading to the proposed mechanism
  through which miR-199a-5p exerts its actions by promoting Akt phosphorylation (g;
  ; ; ).
