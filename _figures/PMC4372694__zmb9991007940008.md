caption: Role of the UPR in regulating Msb2p cleavage and activation of the filamentous-growth
  pathway. (Left) During growth in glucose-replete conditions, Msb2p is fully glycosylated.
  As a result, Msb2p is not efficiently processed and MAPK activity is low. (Right)
  During growth in poor carbon sources (like galactose) or in cells experiencing a
  protein glycosylation deficiency, Msb2p becomes underglycosylated. Underglycosylated
  Msb2p is recognized by Ire1p, a major regulator of the UPR. Ire1p regulates expression
  of YPS1 (dashed arrow), resulting in elevated cleavage of Msb2p and activation of
  the filamentous-growth pathway. The proteolytically processed form of Msb2p is turned
  over by Rsp5p and ESCRT to attenuate the filamentous-growth pathway.
