caption: Mechanism of stress-induced tumor progression and dissemination. Stress facilitates
  the development of immunotolerance by activation of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal
  axis which results in decreased cytotoxicity of natural killer cells (NK cells)
  and reduced cellular immune responses to the tumor antigens. At the same time, activation
  of the sympathetic nervous system induces profound alterations in tumor cells and
  in the tumor microenvironment both directly by sympathetic nerve endings innervating
  the organ in which the tumor develops and indirectly via the liver and adipose tissue.
  Red arrows represent communication via the general circulation, dashed blue arrows
  represent communications via nerves, and blue arrows represent communication within
  the tumor microenvironment. NK, natural killer; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal translation
  of cancer cells; DNA, deoxyribonucleic acid; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; HIF-1α,
  hypoxia inducible factor-1α; PI3/AKT, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase
  B signaling pathway; PKM2, M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase. [Adapted from Cole et
