caption: The fatty acid synthesis pathway of E. coli, its intersection with V. harveyi
  AasS and incorporation of acyl chains into complex lipids. Unsaturated fatty acid
  synthesis is shown below the bracket at the lower right of the figure. Unsaturated
  fatty acids are not found in lipid A unless the cells are grown at low temperatures
  (, ).
