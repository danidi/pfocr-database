caption: Cellular levels of amino acids can be increased by increased expression and
  cell membrane retention of amino acid transporters, which is downstream of receptor
  tyrosine kinase signalling mediated by growth factors. In addition, mechanistic
  target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) senses growth factor signalling and the presence
  of amino acids to promote the utilization of amino acids by activating protein translation.
  CASTOR1, Sestrin2, and SAMTOR are amino acid sensor proteins for arginine, leucine,
  and methionine (through S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)), respectively. These sensors
  control the activity of the GATOR2–GATOR1 complexes, negatively regulating the activity
  of RAG GTPases and hence inhibiting mTORC1 localization to the lysosome and activation.
  The suppressive functions of these sensors are diminished in the presence of the
  amino acids that they sense, leading to the activation of mTORC1. When amino acid
  levels are low, general control nonderepressible (GCN2) is activated by the increase
  of uncharged tRNAs and results in the inhibition of global protein translation (not
  shown). Paradoxically, GCN2 activation leads to increased expression of activating
  transcription factor 4 (ATF4). ATF4 mediates integrated stress response that includes
  the upregulation of genes that mediate amino acid uptake, synthesis and utilization
  (translation) to eventually support cell adaptation and recovery from stress. Note
  that ATF4 increases the expression of a variety of tRNA synthetases that allows
  the cell to better capture the limited amount of cellular amino acid for protein
  translation, which facilitates the production of proteins that are critical in stress
  adaptation and recovery. Cells can also acquire amino acids through macropinocytosis
  of extracellular proteins followed by their lysosomal degradation. Macropinocytic
  utilization is inhibited by mTORC1 and is promoted in cancer via oncogenic RAS and
  phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Certain cancers have also been associated
  with upregulation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), leading to increased
  serine synthesis. These cancers depend on PHGDH for growth and interference with
  de novo serine biosynthesis could be explored as a potential strategy in cancer
  treatment. Cancer associated adaptations are highlighted in red.ASNS, asparagine
  synthetase; PSAT1, phosphoserine aminotransferase 1; RHEB, Ras homolog enriched
  in brain; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; x(c)(−), cystine–glutamine antiporter.
