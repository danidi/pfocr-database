caption: Differential expression of mTOR and HIF-1α pathways between leiomyoma, HLRCC
  and leiomyosarcoma. Hypoxia up-regulates HIF-1α expression through inhibition of
  the prolyl hydroxylases PHD1 and PHD2. In addition, hypoxia activates the TSC1/TSC2
  (hamartin/tuberin) complex via sensing proteins such as AMPK or REDD1. The TSC1/TSC2
  complex functions as a GTPase activator for Rheb, promoting Rheb inactivation. As
  mTOR activity is dependent on stimulation by Rheb, this leads to mTOR inactivation
  and resultant down-regulation of HIF-1α protein expression. Thus, the mTOR pathway
  provides a negative feedback mechanism of HIF-1α activation under hypoxic conditions.
  mTOR and EGR-1 are potent inducers of HIF-1α activation, and are both down-regulated
  in leiomyoma tissue, explaining HIF-1α down-regulation despite tumor hypoxia in
  leiomyomas. Lack of HIF-1α expression is likely responsible for the reduced vascularity
  of these fibroid tumors. In HLRCC fibroids, accumulation of fumarate due to FH mutation
  leads to PHD1 and PHD2 inactivation and resultant HIF-1α overexpression, which is
  likely responsible for the increased vascularity of these tumors. AMPK up-regulation
  and AKT down-regulation in HLRCC fibroids suggests that mTOR activity is reduced
  in these tumors. In leiomyosarcoma, up-regulation of AKT and ERK inhibit the TSC1/TSC2
  complex, leading to mTOR activation, contributing to tumor progression and metastases.
  In addition to mTOR activation, hypoxia likely leads to the observed HIF-1α overexpression
  in leiomyosarcomas, which in turn contributes to the increased vascularity of these
  tumors. PHD1, prolyl hydroxylase 1; PHD2, prolyl hydroxylase 2; AMPK, AMP-activated
  protein kinase; REDD1, regulated in development and DNA damage response 1; Rheb,
  RAS homologue enriched in brain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; RAS, rat sarcoma; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin;
  EGR-1, early growth response-1; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; FH, fumarate
  hydratase; HLRCC, hereditary leiomyomatosis.
