caption: 'The proposed mechanism of the anti-cancer effect of SSPH I in vitro model
  of HCC. The lysosomal function was impaired by SSPH I, resulting in the autophagosome–lysosome
  fusion, consequently, exerting antiproliferative action and induces caspase-dependent
  apoptosis in HepG2 cells. The mechanism was verified using the autophagy inhibitor
  CQ, ROS inhibitor NAC, and MEK inhibitor U0126. The obtained results indicated that
  the inhibition of autophagy-dependent apoptosis of HCC cells by SSPH I could be
  attributed to the increase in ROS and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway.Abbreviations:
  HCC, human hepatocellular carcinoma; CQ, chloroquine; NAC, N-acetyl-cysteine; ROS,
  reactive oxygen species; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase.'
