caption: A PtdIns(3)P-mediated signaling pathway that drives the degradation of apoptotic
  cells. (A) Diagram of the pathway. The phagocytic receptor CED-1 and its adaptor
  CED-6 recruit the large GTPase DYN-1 to phagosomal surfaces, an event resulting
  in the robust production of phagosomal PtdIns(3)P, which in turn recruits LST-4,
  SNX-1, and SNX-6 from cytosol to phagosomal surfaces. These PtdIns(3)P effectors
  act in two parallel and partially redundant pathways to induce the extension of
  membrane tubules from phagosomes. In addition, LST-4 interacts with DYN-1 (Dynamin)
  and stabilizes its association with phagosome, which recruits and stabilizes the
  association of RAB-7 with phagosomes. Both RAB-7 and phagosome tubules facilitate
  efficient endosomes/phagosome and lysosomes/phagosome fusions and ultimately result
  in the degradation of apoptotic cells. (B) A model indicating the two distinct PtdIns(3)P
  effector complexes on phagosomal surfaces. One complex include SNX-1 and SNX-6 (may
  also contain VPS-29), in which SNX-1 interacts with PtdIns(3)P and brings SNX-6
  onto phagosomes. In the second complex, LST-4, perhaps as homodimers, interacts
  with both PtdIns(3)P and DYN-1, which are enriched on phagosomes, and stabilize
  the association of the whole complex with phagosomes. (C) Model proposing that the
  PtdIns(3)P effectors use their BAR domains to induce and/or stabilize the formation
  of phagosomal tubules, which facilitates the recruitment and fusion of intracellular
  organelles to phagosomes.
