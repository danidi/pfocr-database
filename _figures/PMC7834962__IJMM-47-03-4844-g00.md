caption: 'IFN-related signaling pathways modulated by OncoTherad, zinc, vitamin D
  and glutamine during viral infections. (A) Viral PAMPs are recognized by TLRs, triggering
  signaling pathways mediated by TRIF and MyD88. The TRIF/IRF3 pathway activates the
  expression of IFNs that, when interacting with their receptors, activate the JAK/STAT
  pathway and the expression of genes with important antiviral functions. On the other
  hand, the MyD88/NF-κB pathway is responsible for the expression of pro-inflammatory
  genes, such as cytokines, which, when in excess, contribute to the cytokine storm
  characterized by uncontrolled inflammation. SARS-CoV-2 is known for inducing cytokine
  storm associated with severe forms of COVID-19, as well as for inhibiting the production
  of IFNs and evading the IFN-related antiviral defense system. (B) The compounds
  OncoTherad, zinc, vitamin D and glutamine can contribute to the organism''s antiviral
  defenses by several mechanisms: OncoTherad increases the TLR4/TRIF/IRF3/INF signaling
  pathway; zinc inhibits viral replication, activates STAT1, stimulates IFN production
  and induces the antiviral responses mediated by IFN-stimulated genes; vitamin D
  inhibits NF-κB and the expression of its pro-inflammatory target genes, as well
  as stimulates immune cells and the expression of catelicidin with antiviral activity;
  and glutamine is essential for the proliferation of immune cells and the production
  of IFN. Together, these compounds can help to attenuate inflammation associated
  with the cytokine storm and to increase the organism''s antiviral status. The green
  arrows represent activation, the red truncated lines indicate inhibition and the
  blue arrows indicate activation of gene expression. Glu, glutamine; IFN, interferon;
  IFNr, interferon receptor; JAK/STAT, Janus-activated kinase/signal transducer and
