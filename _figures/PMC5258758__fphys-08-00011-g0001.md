caption: 'Possible mechanism of connexin responses associated with acute exposure
  to fatty acids (FAs). FAs induce connexin (Cx) responses by interacting with membrane
  receptors, such as members of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), for example,
  GPR40 (free fatty acid receptor 1, FFAR1) or GPR120 (FFAR4), which are activated
  by medium- and long-chain FAs (Ichimura et al., ). The activation of these FFARs
  could involve an intracellular signaling pathway associated with different protein
  kinases (e.g., PKC, MAPK or AKT). Then, the activated kinase could induce at least
  two different effects: (1) modification of the open probability of Cx hemichannels
  (HCs) and/or gap junction channels (GJC), and/or (2) modification of Cx abundance
  in the cellular membrane (as HCs or GJCs) by changing the relative amount and distribution
  of intracellular Cx. In this model, the intracellular signaling associated with
  FFAR activation is lost after a wash out with a FA-free solution. A direct interaction
  between FAs and Cxs cannot be ruled out (?).'
