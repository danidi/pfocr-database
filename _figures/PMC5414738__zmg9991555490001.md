caption: Key proteins in the regulation of GPCR signaling are arrestins, PDZ proteins,
  and non-PDZ proteins, which all interact with the carboxyl terminal tail or the
  intracellular loops (mainly, but not exclusively, the third loop), respectively.
  Agonist activation of GPCRs leads to receptor phosphorylation which enables, yet
  is not always required, arrestin binding. A, Arrestin serves as adapter to link
  GPCRs to the endocytic machinery. Arrestin per se can also interact with multiple
  MAPKs and therefore is an important regulator of GPCR signaling. Furthermore, GPCR
  signaling from endosomes has been reported recently. B, The second group of proteins
  important for GPCR signaling is PDZ proteins. PDZ proteins have been shown to regulate
  various signaling pathways, such as the activation of ERK1/2, enhance or abolish
  the interaction with G proteins, hence modulating G protein-mediated signaling,
  facilitate the interaction with arrestin and PLC, and can activate Rho GTPase. The
  third group of scaffolding proteins that control GPCR signaling is the group of
  non-PDZ proteins. DAG, diacylglycerol. C, Non-PDZ proteins that interact with GPCRs
  have the ability to bind PDZ proteins but can also associate with PKA, Jak2 (to
  activate the Jak/STAT signaling pathway) and orchestrate Ras/Raf signaling cascades.
