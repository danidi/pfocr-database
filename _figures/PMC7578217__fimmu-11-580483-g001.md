caption: Depiction of an autoreactive (islet-specific) T cell with a TCR with both
  autoantigen specificity and cross-reactivity to allogenic MHC molecules. In response
  to an islet allograft, this type of heterologous TCR can recognize a host MHC-restricted,
  graft-derived autoantigen peptide presented by host APC (right side). Alternatively,
  the same TCR may also directly recognize a native donor MHC molecule plus an unidentified
  peptide expressed by the graft (left side). As such, the same T cell has the potential
  to interact with the islet graft through either a host MHC-restricted (autoreactive)
  or donor MHC-restricted (alloreactive) recognition pathway.
