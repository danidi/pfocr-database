caption: 'Flux is given as average flux of all strains and is expressed as a molar
  percentage of the average glucose uptake rate of all strains (8.6 mmol g−1 h−1,
  calculated from the individual rates in ). Open arrows indicate flux toward biomass.
  For reversible reactions, the direction of net flux is indicated by a dashed arrow.
  The errors given for each flux reflect the corresponding 90% confidence intervals.
  The full flux data sets are presented in Supporting Information. Metabolic and isotopic
  steady states are ensured by constant stoichiometry, kinetics, and the constant
  13C-labeling patterns of recruited metabolites during cultivation (see , ). Abbreviations
  are as follows: Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EDP), Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMPP),
  pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glyoxylate (Gly) shunt, and tricarboxylic acid
  (TCA) cycle.'
