caption: A) The Fatty Acyl-ACP Reductase (FAAR)/Aldehyde Deformylating Oxygenase (ADO)
  involves first a reduction of a fatty acyl substrate to a fatty aldehyde followed
  by an oxidative conversion to an alkane with the release of formate . The OLS (olefin
  producing) pathway involves a polyketide synthase that first elongates a fatty acyl-CoA
  by two carbons from malonyl-CoA via ketosynthase (KS) and acyl transferase (AT)
  domains followed by reduction to the β-hydroxyacid by a ketoreductase (KR). The
  ST activates the β-hydroxy group via sulfonation, and then the thioesterase (TE)
  acts on this substrate to catalyze decarboxylation and loss of sulfate to form the
  terminal alkene.
