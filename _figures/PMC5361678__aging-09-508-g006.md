caption: Our data show that resveratrol down-regulates ERα and lowers the chymotrypsin-like
  activity of the 20S proteasome in HER2+/ERα+ breast cancer, leading to an increased
  accumulation of Δ16HER2, which efficiently couples to HER3 and activates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR
  pathway. In particular, Δ16HER2/HER3 heterodimers trigger the mTORC1/p70S6K/4EBP1
  signaling axis inducing an up-regulation of protein synthesis and cell growth. On
  the other hand, resveratrol inhibits mTORC2 and promotes phosphorylation of PTEN,
  reducing its catalytic activity, thereby enhancing PI3K-mediated AKT activation,
  while feedback loops compensate it.
