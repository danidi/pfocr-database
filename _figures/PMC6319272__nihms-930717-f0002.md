caption: 'Resistance exercise activates mechanical (blue), hormonal (green) and metabolic
  (red) elements to induce anabolic responses in skeletal muscle. These diverse inputs
  have all been demonstrated to influence the phosphorylation and activity of the
  Hippo pathway core kinases, adaptor proteins and effectors (YAP and TAZ) in epithelial
  cells. We hypothesise that in skeletal muscle during resistance exercise, these
  external stimuli may act through the core Hippo pathway kinases (Mst1/2, Map4k1–4,
  6, 7, Lats1/2 and NDR1/2), to regulate the activity of Yap, Taz and Tead to promote
  satellite cell activation, protein synthesis and myofiber growth. Factors that limit
  growth are shown in white; factors that promote growth in grey.Abbreviations: Mammalian
  Ste-20 like kinase 1 and 2 (Mst1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase
  kinases (Map4k) 1–4, 6 and 7, Large Tumour Suppressor kinase 1 and 2 (Lats1/2) and
  the related kinases NDR1/2, WW-domain containing 1 (Sav1) and MOB1A/1B (Mob), Yes-associated
  protein (Yap) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (Taz).'
