caption: The extrinsic apoptosis pathway. (a) Fas and DR4/5 are activated by the binding
  of their respective ligands FasL and TRAIL; the receptors then bind to FADD via
  the death domain (DD). Then, the death effector domain (DED) of FADD binds to procaspase-8/10,
  forming the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) to facilitate the autoproteolytic
  cleavage of procaspase-8/10, which induces the activation of the caspase cascade
  and ultimately results in apoptosis. (b) In particular cells, activated caspase-8
  cleaves the pro-apoptotic protein Bid to create truncated Bid (tBid), and this results
  in the activation of the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signalling pathway. (c)
  TNFR1, EDAR and DR3/6 are activated by the binding of their respective ligands.
  TNFR1 recruits TRADD, an adaptor protein that binds to TNF receptor-associated factors
  (TRAFs), receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP1) and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis
  (cIAPs), forming the initial membrane pro-survival complex (complex I), which stimulates
  the MAPK/JNK and NF-κB pathways to facilitate cell survival or apoptosis. (d) Complex
  I forms two types of cytoplasmic apoptotic complexes, TRADD-dependent complex IIA
  and RIP1-dependent complex IIB, which activate caspase-8, thus initiating apoptosis
