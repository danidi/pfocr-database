caption: Hh signaling pathway in vertebrate. (A) In the absence of Hh ligands, low
  levels of PI(4)P intact with Ptch. Ptch represses Smo activity by preventing its
  accumulation within cilia. Smo associates with SENP family members leading to its
  ubiquitination and degradation. Glis associate with SuFu and Kif7 to form the complex
  in the cytoplasm associated with microtubules. PKA, Cklα and Gsk3β promote phosphorylation
  of Glis to suppress their transcriptional activity (GliR). (B) In the presence of
  Hh ligands, inhibition of Smo by Ptch was relieved, leading to the translocation
  and accumulation of Smo at cilia. PI(4)P directly binds Smo which then triggers
  Smo phosphorylation. Sumoylation and cholesterol modification on D95 are also required
  for Hh signaling pathway activation. Glis dissociate the SuFu-Gli complex. Glis
  were in their active forms (GliA). GliA enters into the nucleus to regulate gene
  expression.
