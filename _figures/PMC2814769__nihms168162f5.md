caption: The cilium/basal body may function as a regulatory switch to control the
  balance between the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways. In the canonical pathway
  (A, left), a Wnt ligand binds to the co-receptors Frizzled and LRP. This inhibits
  the activity of the β-catenin destruction complex possibly through the Dishevelled
  (Dvl) protein and leads to stabilization of β-catenin., which accumulates in the
  nucleus and with LEF and TCF activates target genes. In the noncanonical pathway
  (A, right), Wnt binds to a frizzled receptor, independent of LRP. This activates
  a membrane form of Dvl which regulates downstream targets. The noncanonical Wnt
  signal activates Inversin, which resides in multiple locations in the cell including
  the cilium or at the base of the cilium. Inversin induces the degradation of cytoplasmic
  but not the membrane form of Dvl. In a ciliated cell (A), both the canonical and
  noncanonical pathways are operative and the strength of the canonical pathway (A
  right) is thought to be influenced by the noncanonical Wnt pathway (A, left). In
  the absence of cilia (B), the model would suggest that noncanonical pathway is unable
  to efficiently antagonize the activity of the canonical.
