caption: 'The RAS Signalling Pathway (90% of JMML cases involve mutations in the RAS
  pathway): N/KRAS proteins (in Pink) alternate between “ACTIVE” and “INACTIVE” states.
  They are activated in response to signals transferred by surface receptors resulting
  in the recruitment of guanine exchange factors (GEFs), which stimulates binding
  of GTP to RAS in place of GDP. The RAS is interrupted by GTPase-activating a protein
  (GAPS) which hydrolyses GTP to GDP. Mutations of RAS (*) prevent the conversion
  of RAS-GTP to RAS-GDP - resulting in its constitutive stimulation and hence activation
  of downstream effectors to induce cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival;
  PTPN11 gene encodes for Src homology region 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine
  phosphatase 2 (SHP2). SHP2 binds to RAS and dephosphorylates it, allowing it to
  bind to RAF and, hence activating the downstream effectors. It can also bind to
  GRB2 which in turn can bind GEFs and convert RAS-GDP to RAS-GTP. Gain-of-function
  mutations in PTPN11 (*) increase its phosphatase activity resulting in constitutive
  activation of the RAS pathway; CBL helps in the regulation of the RAS pathway by
  inhibiting GRB2 and downregulating JAK2. In the presence of mutations in CBL (*),
  GRB2 activity becomes unchecked resulting in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
  pathway; NF-1 can bind to RAS-GTP and converts it to RAS-GDP. When NF-1 is mutated
  (*), GAP activity is reduced which leads to increased levels of RAS-GTP and hence
  activation of downstream pathways.'
