caption: The cytokine receptor is a transmembrane protein comprising an extracellular
  ligand binding domain (ECD), a single pass transmembrane domain (TMD), and an intracellular
  domain (ICD). The ECD folds into two fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains, D1 and
  D2. The γc receptors are members of the cytokine receptor homology class I (CRH)
  family that include receptors for growth hormone, erythropoietin, prolactin, and
  various interleukins (, ). The defining features of the CRH I family include conserved
  cysteine residues (depicted by yellow bars) involved in disulfide bonds in the D1
  domain and a WSXWS primary sequence motif (depicted by red bars) in the D2 domain.
  During the initiation step, the cytokine or interleukin (IL) in this case interacts
  with the ECD of its α-/β-chain receptor forming the site 1 interface. This leads
  to the intermediate step where the 1:1 complex can associate with the shared common
  gamma-chain (γc) receptor. The binding of the γc receptor involves an interface
  between the interleukin and γc called site 2a and an interface between D2 regions
  of the α-/β-chain and γc receptors called site 2b. The bringing together of the
  α-/β-chain and γc receptors by the interleukin activates the classical janus kinase
  and signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway and other
  signaling pathways.
