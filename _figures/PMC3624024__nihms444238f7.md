caption: FKBP10 serves as an ERAD partitioning factor for mutant lysosomal enzymes.
  In the model, the newly synthesized unfolded mutant lysosomal glycoenzyme encounters
  either FKBP10 or calnexin in the ER, resulting in its degradation or folding, respectively.
  FKBP10 bound-lysosomal glycoenzyme appears to associate with OS-9 that delivers
  misfolded lysosomal enzyme to the ERAD machinery for cytosolic dislocation and proteasome-mediated
  degradation. In the competitive pathway, the calnexin bound-lysosomal enzymes are
  folded into their native state, which enables LIMP-2 (or an equivalent trafficking
  receptor) binding and lysosomal trafficking.
