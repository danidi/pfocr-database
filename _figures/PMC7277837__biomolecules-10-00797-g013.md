caption: 'Hypothesized pathway for the production of prokaryotic glycolipids in C.
  muelleri. Two pathways can produce DAG: one is located in the chloroplast (prokayotic
  pathway), the other in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (eukaryotic pathway). The
  20:5n-3-CoA used for glycolipids synthesis is produced in the ER and collected from
  it to form prokaryotic DAG. This DAG can be further used to create glycolipids (configuration
  sn-1: 20:5n-3 and sn-2: 16:3n-4). The eukaryotic pathway in the ER could also explain
  the similar concentration dynamics observed between 20:5n-3 and 18:4n-3. CoA: co-enzyme
  A. DAG: diacylglycerol, DGD: digalactodiacylglycerol synthase, DGDG: digalactodiacylglycerol,
  G3P: glycerol-3-phosphate, GPAT: acyl-CoA-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase,
