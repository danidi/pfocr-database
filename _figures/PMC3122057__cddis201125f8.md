caption: Proposed schematic of the roles of NIK and SMG1 in sensitive versus resistant
  cells in response to SMC and TNFα treatment. In SMC sensitive cells (left side),
  removal of the cIAPs by SMC treatment prevents ubiquitination of RIP1, allowing
  RIP1 to bind and activate the death complex II that includes caspase-8 and FADD
  (A). Degradation of SMG1 allows for the activation of JNK in response to TNFα, leading
  to proteasomal downregulation of c-FLIP possibly through the ITCH-mediated pathway
  (B). As c-FLIP is downregulated, caspase-8 activation is able to proceed and apoptosis
  ensues. In SMC-resistant cells (right side), the level of SMG1 persists in spite
  of SMC and TNFα treatment, blunting the activation of JNK (C) and thereby preventing
  proteasomal degradation of c-FLIP. In addition, depletion of cIAPs by SMC treatment
  allows NIK to accumulate, resulting in activation of both the classical and alternative
  NF-κB pathways (D), which may elevate transcriptional levels of c-FLIP. SMG1 and
  NIK functions appear to converge by sustaining the protein expression level of c-FLIP,
  thereby preventing caspase-8 activation and repressing SMC-mediated apoptosis. Silencing
  of both SMG1 and NIK converts SMC-resistant cells to become sensitive to SMC treatment
  in response to TNFα
