caption: Model for endosomal pH regulation of Aβ production. APP can be consecutively
  cleaved by α- and γ-secretases (non-amyloidogenic pathway), mainly at the cell surface.
  Alternatively, APP is internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis to reach endosomes
  and the trans-Golgi network, where it undergoes amyloidogenic processing by β- and
  γ-secretases. Endosomal pH is precisely tuned by a balance of proton pumping (acidification)
  through the V-ATPase and proton leak (alkalization) via NHE6. NHE6 expression alkalinizes
  the endosomal lumen, blocks trafficking of APP from the endosome to TGN, and limits
  Aβ production.
