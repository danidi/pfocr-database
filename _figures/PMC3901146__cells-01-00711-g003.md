caption: 'Role of IAPs in DNA damage response. Genotoxic stress-induced DNA strand
  breaks are very quickly detected by sensor molecules that activate cell cycle checkpoints
  and DNA repair mechanisms. They also induce IRES-dependent up-regulation of XIAP
  and cIAP1. MDM2 is dephosphorylated and exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
  where it physically interacts and stimulates XIAP IRES. cIAP1 and XIAP are regulators
  of DNA damage-mediated NF-κB activating pathway. The sensor protein ATM is translocated
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it interacts with TRAF6 and favors its Ubc13-mediated
  K63 ubiquitination. These Ub chains are a signal for the recruitment of cIAP1, TAB2/TAK1
  complex and IKK complex. TAK1 induces the phosphylation of IKKβ, cIAP1 mediates
  IKKγ mono-ubiquitination while LUBAC induces its linear ubiquitination. All of these
  post-translational modifications are required for NF-κB activation. XIAP controls
  this process by regulating TAK1 activation and association with the IKK complex.
  An auto-ubiquitination and degradation of cIAPs and XIAP have also been described,
  allowing the assembly of Ripoptosome leading to caspase-dependent or independent
  cell death. UPS: ubiquitin-proteasome system.'
