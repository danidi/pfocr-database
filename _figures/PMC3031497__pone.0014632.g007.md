caption: 'Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, see Methods), we summarized the known
  regulatory interaction of "cancer initiating genes" with the "potential regulator
  genes" and transcription factors (blue arrows). When no direct connection was found,
  we searched for indirect connections through mediator genes. If more than one such
  gene was found, we connected representative interactions (green arrow). Finally,
  we connected the genes in the lists to known cancer related pathways, based on the
  IPA database. First row: the list of "cancer initiating genes" which are located
  on 20q13. Second row: mediators - genes that have protein-protein interaction with
  the "cancer initiating genes" or are regulated by these genes and are also known
  regulators of the "potential regulator genes". Third row: The transcription factors
  that were found by POC. 4th row: the "potential regulator genes". 5th row: the list
  of cancer pathways as defined by IPA and the "potential regulator genes" from our
  analysis that belong to these pathways. We filtered out the"potential regulator
  genes" and transcription factors for which no direct or through one mediator connection
  to our "cancer initiating genes" were found.'
