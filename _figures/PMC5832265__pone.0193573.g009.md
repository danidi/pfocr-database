caption: TNF through TNFRp75 triggers IL-12/23p40 secretion by DCs. This IL-12/23p40
  production is controlled by TNF/TNFRp55 pathway involving IL-10 and other unknown
  mechanisms. In the absence of the regulatory TNF/TNFRp55 circuit, DCs increase IL-12/23p40
  secretion, driving the adaptive response to chronic Th1 and Th17 programs. Black
  spots represent inflammatory cytokines, and grey spots represent regulatory cytokines.
