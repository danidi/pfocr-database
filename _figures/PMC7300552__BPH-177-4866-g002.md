caption: Crosstalk between kallikrein–kinin system (KKS), coagulation, fibrinolysis,
  and complement cascade. KKS (black box and arrows) consists of tissue and plasma
  kallikrein, which act on high‐MW kininogen (HMWK) and low‐MW kininogen (LMWK) to
  generate bradykinin (BK) and kallidin (Lys‐BK). BK and Lys‐BK, and their metabolites
  [des‐Arg10]kallidin ([Lys‐des‐Arg9]BK) and [des‐Arg9]BK), act via two G‐coupled
  receptors, B1 and B2 receptors, resulting in increased vascular permeability, vasodilation,
  oedema formation and ultimately hypotension. Plasma kallikrein, which is induced
  by the reciprocal activation of the factor XIIa (FXIIa) and plasma prekallikrein,
  also influences the fibrinolytic pathway by activating plasminogen into plasmin
  and leading to fibrin degradation and D‐dimer generation (yellow box and arrows).
  Beyond its role in KKS, FXIIa starts the intrinsic coagulation pathway (red arrows).
  Blood coagulation consists of an intrinsic and extrinsic (grey arrows) pathways,
  both resulting in activation of the coagulation factor X (FX), which subsequently
  leads to thrombin and fibrin generation (common pathway; blue arrows). The coagulation
  cascade is also a starting point for the complement system (pink box and arrows).
  FXIIa binds C1q component of the complement triggering the classic pathway; moreover,
  plasmin activation, which is also promoted via B2 receptor signalling, triggers
  C3 cleavage inducing the activation of both lecithin and extrinsic pathways of the
  complement
