caption: Mitochondrial role in the development of insulin resistance and T2DM. This
  schematic shows primary mitochondrial defects to the left of the hatched line in
  the center of the cell and the development of mitochondrial deficits in response
  to environmental cues and aging to the right of the hatched line. In primary disruption
  in the mitochondrial metabolic capacity, FAO is diminished, fat intermediates accumulate
  and DAG, which appears to be the primary intermediate that then activates protein
  kinase C isoforms. These in turn phosphorylate and inactivate numerous kinase substrates
  in the insulin signaling pathway. The reduced insulin sensitivity exacerbates the
  metabolic perturbations by reducing glucose uptake and possibly by further down-regulation
  of the mitochondrial biogenesis program. The etiologies of primary mitochondrial
  defects are labeled 1–3. The etiologies of secondary disruption of mitochondrial
  dysfunction are labeled 4–7. High-fat diet can promote mitochondrial biogenesis;
  alternatively nutrient overload, which may include both glucose and fats, enhances
  both lipid intermediates that facilitate oxidative damage and impair insulin signaling.
  Furthermore, the nutrient overload presents excess reducing equivalents to the ETC
  that can result in increased ROS generation. The oxidative damage, in turn, disrupts
  the mitochondrial oxidative capacity, which then recapitulates the phenotype of
  primary mitochondrial deficits promoting insulin resistance. Ox PHOS, Mitochondrial

    This schematic shows primary mitochondrial defects to the left of the hatched
