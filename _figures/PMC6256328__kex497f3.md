caption: 'Hypothesized relationship between OA development and three promising metabolic
  pathways and related markersBCAA metabolic pathway is altered because of either
  joint injury or articular cartilage pathology, whereas arginine catabolism is increased
  to activate arginine–proline pathway for cartilage repair or alternatively relatively
  selective utilization of arginine by other metabolic or biosynthetic process concurrent
  with OA process. Inflammatory factors either as an OA initiation factor or caused
  by OA disease process activate PC to lysoPC pathway, which mediates joint pain.
  Metabolism-related diseases such as diabetes alter both BCAA and PC to lysoPC metabolic
  pathways or mediate low-grade inflammation via lipopolysaccharide to contribute
  to OA, or alternatively both OA and diabetes share the same pathway. BCAA: branched
  chain amino acid; lysoPC: lysophosphatidylcholine; PC: phosphatidylcholine.'
