caption: '(A) IPA graphical representation of the molecular relationships between
  the significantly regulated genes to the predicted canonical pathways in response
  to the leaf treatment in HepG2 cells. The network is displayed graphically as nodes
  (genes) and edges (the biological relationships between the nodes). Nodes in red
  indicate up-regulated genes while those in green represent down-regulated genes.
  Various shapes of the nodes represent functional class of the proteins. Edges are
  displayed with various labels that describe the nature of the relationship between
  the nodes. Name of genes with their corresponding abbreviations are as follows:
  ADH6, Alcohol dehydrogenase 6; ALDH6A1, Aldehyde dehydrogenase 6 family, member
  A1; ALDH9A1, Aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family, member A1; ANXA3, Annexin A3; CYP24A1,
  Cytochrome P450, family 24, subfamily A, polypeptide 1; DHCR24, 24-dehydrocholesterol
  reductase; EPHX1, Epoxide hydrolase 1; FGA, Fibrinogen alpha chain; FGG, Fibrinogen
  gamma chain; GSTM4, Glutathione S-transferase mu 4; IFNGR1, Interferon gamma receptor
  1; KNG1, Kininogen 1; LEAP2, Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide; LSS, Lanosterol
  synthase; MVK, Mevalonate kinase; MX1, Myxovirus resistance 1; SERPINC1, Serpin
  peptidase inhibitor, clade C (antithrombin), member 1; SERPIND1, Serpin peptidase
  inhibitor, clade D (heparin cofactor), member 1, SERPINE1, Serpin peptidase inhibitor,
  clade E (Nexin, Plasminogen activator inhibitor, type 1), member 1; TM7SF2, Transmembrane
  7 superfamily member 2. (B) IPA graphical representation showing the effect of significantly
  regulated genes, ALDH6A1, ALDH6 and GSTM4 in the detoxification process of 4-HNE
  and MDA. This figure demonstrates that the three genes are involved in the xenobiotic
  metabolism signaling pathway as on one of the top canonical pathway generated by
  IPA. The process is displayed graphically as nodes (genes) and edges (the biological
  relationships between the nodes). Nodes in red indicate up-regulated genes. Various
  shapes of the nodes represent functional class of the proteins. Edges are displayed
  with various labels that describe the nature of the relationship between the nodes.
  (C) IPA graphical representation of the molecular relationships between KNG1, SERPINE1,
  SERPINC1, SERPIND1 and Fibrinogen that are involved in “Coagulation System”, the
  top predicted canonical pathway in HepG2 cells affected by the methanol leaf extract
  of T. indica. The network is displayed graphically as nodes (genes) and edges (the
  biological relationships between the nodes). Nodes in red indicate up-regulated
  genes. Various shapes of the nodes represent functional class of the proteins. Edges
  are displayed with various labels that describe the nature of the relationship between
  the nodes. Name of genes/proteins with their corresponding abbreviations are as
  follows: A2M, Alpha-2-macroglobulin; BDK, Bradykinin; BDKR, Bradykinin receptor;
  F2, Coagulation factor II (thrombin); F2a, Coagulation factor IIa (thrombin); F2R,
