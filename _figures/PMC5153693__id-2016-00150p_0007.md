number: Figure 6
caption: Metabolic impact of genetic silencing of pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis
  enzymes in ATc-regulated cKD mutant strains. Steps in the biosynthetic pathway that
  were subject to transcriptional silencing are indicated in orange diamonds with
  black lettering; other steps are shown as pink diamonds with gray lettering. Relative
  metabolite abundances (based on ion intensities) are indicated in heatmap format
  below each pathway intermediate, with columns indicating the duration of silencing
  (1.5 or 3 days) and rows denoting the specific gene silenced. Asterisks indicate
  metabolites for which levels varied in direction between two independent experiments
  after 3 days of silencing. Primary data are included in Figures S6 and S7.
