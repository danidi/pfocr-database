caption: DNA damaging (orange) or proteasome inhibiting (blue) drugs illicit apoptosis
  signaling through select member(s) of BH3-only pro-apoptotic protein family (BIM,
  NOXA (blue), PUMA, BAD, HRK (orange), BID, and MS-1). These proteins then carry
  the apoptosis signal to mitochondria, where they impact the free pool of effector
  pro-apoptotic proteins. When dissociated from anti-apoptotic proteins, the effector
  proteins cause mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) triggering the
  mitochondrial apoptosis signal. In this assay, BH3-only mimetic peptides artificially
  reproduce this signaling pathway and the MOMP signal from the drug associated BH3
  only protein is subsequently analyzed. The extent of MOMP is measured by flow cytometry
  using a mitochondrial potentiometric dye, JC-1. Thus, BH3 profiling surveys how
  likely the drugs are to complete the apoptotic signal. This was performed in ex
  vivo experiments at pretreatment as described previously.
