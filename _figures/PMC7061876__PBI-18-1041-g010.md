caption: A proposed model for SlPIF4 positively regulating tomato cold tolerance by
  integrating light and temperature signals. Briefly, L‐R/FR and low temperature induce
  SlPIF4 protein accumulation via a phyA‐dependent pathway under cold stress. SlPIF4
  not only directly activates CBF expression but also associates with the promoter
  of the SlGAI4 gene and activates its transcription, promoting ABA and JA biosynthesis
  and CBF expression. Thus, SlPIF4 is a positive regulator in L‐R/FR‐induced cold
  tolerance in tomato. SlGAI4, a DELLA protein, acts downstream of SlPIF4 and positively
  regulates L‐R/FR‐induced cold tolerance. Interestingly, when large amounts of SlGAI4
  protein accumulate during cold stress, it represses SlPIF4 accumulation in a negative
  feedback manner.
