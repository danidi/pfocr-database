caption: Schematic overview of the involvement of SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 (SOG1)
  in acute responses of A. thaliana leaves to cadmium (Cd) exposure. SOG1 regulates
  the Cd-induced DNA damage response, controlling cell cycle progression, DNA repair
  and cell death. Additionally, it regulates the Cd-induced oxidative signaling pathway,
  as it affects the extent of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, ethylene signaling
  and glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis. The involvement of SOG1 in Cd-induced oxidative
  signaling possibly results from its direct interaction with the promoter of OXIDATIVE
  SIGNAL-INDUCIBLE 1 (OXI1). The latter is responsible for activation of a mitogen-activated
  kinase (MPK) signaling cascade, ultimately inducing ethylene biosynthesis. Whether
  Cd exposure activates SOG1 through (ROS-induced) DNA damage or through an alternative
  mechanism remains to be elucidated (indicated in dashed arrows). ACS, 1-amino-cyclopropane-1-carboxylate
  synthase; RBOH, respiratory burst oxidase homolog.
