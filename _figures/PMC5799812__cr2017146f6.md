caption: A convergent model for the pathogenesis of ANKL. IL10 stimulates STAT3 signaling
  in both JAK-STAT-mutated and wild-type patients. The JAK-STAT pathway, EBV-derived
  RNA and additional mechanisms (not shown) contribute to the high level of plasma
  IL10 expression. Activated STAT3 signaling leads to the MYC-driven transcription
  program that sustains aberrant activation of nucleotide synthesis and glycolysis.
  Mutations in JAK-STAT pathway or TET2 genes cooperate with the JAK/STAT-MYC-biosynthesis
  axis and accelerate leukemogenesis in ANKL. Known inhibitors were tested to show
  the functional importance of specific target genes or pathways.
