caption: Interplay between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the
  bradykinin (BK) system and chymase. The classical RAAS consists of renin, which
  produces angiotensin (Ang) I from a circulating angiotensinogen. Ang I is then converted
  by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to Ang II, the main vasoconstrictor, sodium-retaining,
  proinflammatory, and profibrotic effector of RAAS. Recently, new components of RAAS,
  namely, ACE2, Ang-(1–7) and its Mas-receptor (MasR), were identified. ACE2 converts
  Ang I into Ang-(1–9), and in turn to Ang-(1–7) by ACE. Moreover, ACE2 can directly
  convert Ang II to Ang-(1–7). Additional pathway for Ang-(1–7) involves neural endopeptidase-neprilysin
  (NEP), which converts Ang I directly into Ang-(1–7). In contrast to Ang II, Ang-(1–7)
  exerts vasodilatory, antiproliferative, and antifibrotic activity, via MasR, thus
  counterbalancing the adverse effects of Ang II mediated by AT1R. The right side
  of the scheme describes bradykinin (BK) synthesis from kininogen, a process mediated
  by kallikreins. BK acts via BKB-2R, where it induces vasodilation, natriuresis,
  antithrombosis, pain, and chymase upregulation. BK is metabolized into inactive
  metabolites by kininase. In addition, [des-Arg9]-BK, a 9 aa peptide produced by
  the serine protease kallikrein from inactive circulating or tissue-bound preprotein
  kininogen or from BK by ACE, acts on target organs via BKB-1R, where it induces
  inflammation, coagulation, and pain. SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 and
  eventually generates Ang-(1–7) depletion, leading to unopposed vasoconstriction
  and inflammation. In addition, ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 infection upregulates
  [des-Arg9]-BK, thus aggravating its inflammatory and coagulopathy actions. Furthermore,
  depletion of Ang-(1–7) characterizing patients with COVID-19 likely enhances BK
  degradation into inactive metabolites, but still associated with [des-Arg9]-BK levels
  due to ACE2 depletion, thus aggravating the deleterious effects mediated by BKB-1R.
  Chymase, expressed in different cell types, including mast cells, cardiac fibroblasts,
  and vascular endothelial cells, is a major non-ACE of tissue Ang II generation from
  Ang-(1–12) and Ang I, especially in the heart and blood vessels. Chymase also activates
  transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) by converting
  their precursors into active forms, involved in tissue inflammation and fibrosis,
  leading to structural injury and organ remodeling as well as enhanced coagulation.
