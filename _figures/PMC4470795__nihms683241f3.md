caption: Combined proteomics and metabolomics data of human RCC tissue was overlayed
  onto a stylized KEGG-based pathway diagram. Green, metabolite; orange, enzyme; black
  dot arrow, metabolism; red, upregulated pathway; blue arrow, downregulated pathway.
  ACSL, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor;
  CPT, carnitine palmitoyltransferase; HADH, carnitine palmitoyltransferase alpha
  subunit; HADHA, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase; EHHADH, enoyl-CoA, hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl
  CoA dehydrogenase; SCEH, short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase; MCAD, medium-chain specific
  acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; VLCAD, very long-chain specific acyl-CoA dehydrogenase;
  ACAT, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase.
