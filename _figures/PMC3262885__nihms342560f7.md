caption: In naïve cells (left panel), stimulation of the TCR causes the IKK mediated
  phosphorylation of IκBα which is subsequently ubiquitinated and degraded. This allows
  the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 and translocation into the nucleus. Once in
  the nucleus, p65 is phosphorylated at Ser276 and Ser311 and acetylated at Lys310.
  In anergic cells (right panel), degradation of IκB, phosphorylation at Ser536 and
  Ser276, and nuclear translocation occur normally. By contrast, p65 is not phosphorylated
  at Ser311 nor acetylated at Lys310 in anergic T cells.
