caption: A schematic diagram illustrating the interplay between TLX and the BMP-SMAD
  signaling pathway in the regulation of neurogenesis and astrogenesis. TLX directly
  modulates the expression of the BMP ligands, which bind and activate the type I
  (RI) and type II (RII) receptors. These events result in phosphorylation of regulatory
  SMADs and their dimerization with the common cofactor SMAD4. The SMAD complex acts
  as a transcriptional activator to induce the expression of downstream targets, which
  promote astrogenesis and inhibit neurogenesis.
