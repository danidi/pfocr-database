caption: In the chick heart AVC, TGFβ2 binds to TBRIII expressed by endothelial cells.
  This signaling pathway through pSMAD2/3 turns on the expression of RUNX2-I and SNAI2
  (), two factors required for EMT activation. RUNX2-I induces the expression of EMT-related
  transcription factors and VEGF receptors independently of SNAI2 with the exception
  of ZEB1 and ZEB2. Expression of these molecules is followed by delamination of endothelial
  cells and expression of αSMA and POSTN.
