caption: Emerging therapies to inhibit the development of brain edema after traumatic
  brain injury (TBI). On the left, the novel molecular pathway of brain edema formation
  proposed by Laird et al, which hypothesizes that in areas of necrosis, HMGBl release
  from neurons binds to TLR4 receptors on microglia and leads to elaboration of IL
  6. IL 6 triggers upregulation of AQP4 water channels in astrocytes with water uptake
  across the blood brain barrier and astrocyte swelling. On the right, a second pathway
  involves upregulation of the SUR1 channel on neurons, astrocytes, and cerebrovascular
  endothelium. This monovalent cation channel is normally absent but is upregulated
  after TBI. Emerging therapies targeting both pathways (identified by 0). For the
  HMGB1 TLR4 cascade (left), potential therapies include (1) the HMGBl binding agent
  glycyrrhizin or release inhibitor ethyl pyruvate, (2) inhibitors of TLR4 signaling
  (VGX 1027 or resatorvid), or (3) AQP4 antagonists. The prototype therapy targeting
  the SURl channel pathway (right) is glibenclamide. HMGB-1, high mobility box protein
  1; TLR4, toll like receptor 4; IL 6, interleukin 6; AQP4, aquaporin 4; SURl, sulfonylurea
  receptor 1.
