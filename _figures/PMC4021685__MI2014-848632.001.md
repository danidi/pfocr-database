caption: 'Schematic simplified demonstration of the main mechanisms supposed to be
  involved in fatty acid and TNF family interaction at different levels of colon epithelial
  cell organisation. Fibre fermentation product butyrate is transported by SMCT into
  the cells, where it may inhibit histone deacetylation, activate transcription factor
  PPARγ, inhibit NFκB, and affect ΔΨmt and expression and balance of pro- and antiapoptotic
  members of Bcl-2 family proteins. Dietary PUFAs of the n-6 (LA, AA-plant oils) and
  n-3 series and (EPA and DHA, fish and algal oils) transported into the cells by
  FAT/CD36 are stored in lipid droplets in TAG form or incorporated into plasma and
  mitochondrial membrane lipids thus modulating composition and structure of lipid
  rafts and caveolae. PUFAs are released from membrane phospholipids by PLA2 and metabolized
  by COX and LOX enzymes to various types of products such as LTs and PGs. PUFAs can
  also modulate ceramide production and their metabolism is source of ROS and RNS
  and induces lipid peroxidation. Incorporation of PUFAs into mitochondrial cardiolipins
  influences mitochondrial metabolism and induction of apoptosis. EPA and DHA activate
  PPARγ and inhibit NFκB, thus suppressing iNOS expression and RNS production. TNF
  family cytokines TNF-α, TRAIL, and FasL bind to their receptors TNFR1 and 2, DR4
  and DR5, or FasR (CD95), respectively. Programmed cell death is regulated by formation
  of DISC consisting of FADD and procaspase-8, whose activation may be inhibited by
  cFLIP. Cleavage of Bid protein to tBid mediates connection between extrinsic and
  intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. Changes in mitochondria (involving
  cardiolipin modulation), mitochondrial transition pore opening, decrease of ΔΨmt,
  and production of ROS influence the activation of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins
  of the Bcl-2 family and release of proapoptotic proteins (e.g., cytochrome c) into
  the cytosol. Subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, cleavage of PARP,
  and execution of apoptosis can be inhibited by IAPs. TNF-α activates NFκB via pathway
  involving TRADD, RIP, TRAF2, and IKK proteins. The interaction between epithelial
  cells and cells of immune system, which are the source of inflammatory mediators
  (IFNγ, IL, and PGE2), is also indicated. The dashed arrows-simplified signalling
