caption: Roles of notch signaling in development and neurological disorders.The illustration
  depicts the canonical notch signaling pathway (center) and involvement in developmental
  processes (left) as well as adult neurological disorders (right). Neighboring cells
  possess the notch ligand (jagged or delta) and the target cell contains the notch
  receptor. Activation of notch upon ligand binding will release the notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) as a result of its cleavage by γ-secretase. NICD then translocates
  into the nucleus where it can interact with CSL and convert CSL from a transcriptional
  repressor to transcriptional activator. This conversion occurs by direct protein-protein
  interactions between NICD, SKIP and CSL, which leads to SMRT/HDAC dissociation.
  Notch/CSL recruit HATs to assist chromatin remodeling, and RBPJk and mastermind
  to activate specific targets. Notch signaling plays an important role during CNS
  development (left). During neural stem cell (NSC) divisions, numb is concentrated
  in the apical cell while notch is concentrated in the basal cell. NSC survival is
  promoted by notch-2, delta like ligand (Dll) 4, as well as numb and numblike. NSCs
  undergo precocious neuronal differentiation (blue cells) as a result of a compromised
  notch-1, presenilin (PS) 1 or 2, Dll1, RBPjκ, HES 1 or 2, numb, or numb like activity.
  In addition, a radial glia/NSC cell fate can be influenced by over-expression of
  either notch 1 or 3. Notch signaling has also been implicated in many adult neurological
  disorders (right). In synaptic plasticity, reduction in notch-1 signaling results
  in decreased long term potentiation (LTP) as well as reduction in learning and memory.
  Because mutations in presenilin-1/γ-secretase are linked to some inherited forms
  of Alzheimer’s disease, notch signaling has been proposed to play a role in this
  disease. In humans with mutations of notch-3, vascular development is impacted and
  leads to CADASIL a disorder characterized by cerebral vascular infarctions. In a
  mouse model of stoke, a reduction of notch 1 and/or γ-secretase leads to decreased
  activated microglia and inflammation, and improves functional outcome. Notch signaling
  in NSCs may enhance neurogenesis and functional recovery from a stroke. In CNS tumors,
  cancer stem cells express high levels of molecules in the notch signaling pathway
  (notch 1–3, delta, jagged 1, Hes 1, 2, 4), suggesting that modulation of notch signaling
  could be a potential therapeutic target to inhibit tumor progression.
