caption: Schematic for NFATc1‐induced apoptosis in HCC cells through activation of
  the FasL‐mediated extrinsic signaling pathway. NFATc1 expression is silenced in
  HCC. Ectopic expression of NFATc1 induced FasL expression through direct binding
  to its promoter and induction of apoptosis signaling, including caspase 8 and caspase
  3 activation, eventually leading to apoptosis
