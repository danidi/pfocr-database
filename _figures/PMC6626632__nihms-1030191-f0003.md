caption: 'Black arrows: metabolites changes in CD+PCB 126 vs CD groups; red arrows:
  metabolites changes in MCD+PCB 126 vs MCD groups. Arrows with asterisk indicate
  hepatic gene expression changes. The bar chart represents the relative levels of
  uric acid in mice liver. The LC-MS peak area of uric acid was log transformed and
  normalized with its median value. Bars represent mean ± S.E.M. of six animals in
  each group. Different subscript letters (a, b, c) indicate statistical significance
  (p<0.05) by two-way ANOVA analysis. DHAP: dihydroxyacetone phosphate; PRPP: phosphoribosyl
  pyrophosphate; AICAR: 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, IMP: inosine
  monophosphate, AMP: adenosine monophosphate; GMP: guanosine monophosphate; UMP:
  uridine monophosphate; CMP: cytidine monophosphate.'
