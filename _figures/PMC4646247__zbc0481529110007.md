caption: EDEMP cycle of P. putida KT2440. The architecture of central carbon metabolism
  is shown along the key elements belonging to the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (in green),
  the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (in purple, operating in the gluconeogenic direction),
  and the pentose phosphate pathway (in red). Reactions downward to pyruvate are indicated
  with a wide shaded arrow. G6P, Glc-6-P; F6P, Fru-6-P.
