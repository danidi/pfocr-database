caption: An integrated shell biorefinery process for upcycling SSW-derived chitin
  into NCCs. During pretreatment of SSW into water-soluble chitin hydrolysates, SSW
  was first demineralized by using diluted acid, which partially removed proteins.
  The SSW-derived chitin was further depolymerized into water-soluble GlcNAc and its
  oligomers via a ball-milling H2SO4-catalyzed process, generating chitin hydrolysates
  mixed with protein hydrolysates. A one-pot enzymatic/fermentative process was performed
  to produce tyrosine and/or l-DOPA by using engineered E. coli from the unpurified
  SSW-derived hydrolysates as the sole carbon and nitrogen source. The biosynthetic
  pathway of tyrosine and l-DOPA from GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 is shown. Solid blue lines
  with arrowhead indicate a one-step enzymatic reaction, while a multiple-step pathway
  is indicated by the dotted blue line with arrowhead. To enzymatically convert GlcNAc
  oligomers (n ≥ 4) to fermentable GlcNAc, (GlcNAc)2 or (GlcNAc)3, a small amount
  of chitinase was added into the culture medium upon inoculation. Gene hapBC coding
  p-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase was from E. coli W strain (GenBank no. WP_000801473.1).
