caption: Physiologic hemoglobin scavengers and detoxification systems. Hb can be released
  from red blood cells (RBC) into the plasma and extracellular environment during
  hemolysis or tissue injury. In the extracellular compartment, Hb reacts with peroxides
  (H2O2 and lipid hydroperoxides) and promotes oxidative tissue damage. In the plasma
  or extracellular space, Hb is sequestered in the Hb–Hp complex. Complex formation
  prevents Hb-induced hypertensive and oxidative reactions. The Hb–Hp complex is subsequently
  endocytosed by the macrophage Hb scavenger receptor CD163. Within the macrophage,
  heme is released from globin and degraded by HO-1 into bilirubin and carbon monoxide
  (CO). The released iron induces ferritin synthesis. Iron can either be exported
  for iron recycling or it can be stored in a ferritin complex. Backup systems such
  as hemopexin (Hpx) and the Hpx–heme complex receptor (LDL receptor-related protein,
  LRP) pathway can bind and detoxify free heme that is released from oxidized Hb.
