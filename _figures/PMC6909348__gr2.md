caption: CLCA1 on mucus production. Th2 cytokine IL-13 binds to the IL-13 receptor
  and leads to increased expression of CLCA1 via the STAT6/SPDEF signaling/transcription
  pathway. The 110-kDa full-length CLCA1 translational product in the endoplasmic
  reticulum undergoes self-cleavage by releasing the 35-kDa COOH-terminal fragment
  and allowing the 75~90-kDa NH2-terminal protein to bind to a putative yet undefined
  receptor on the airway epithelial cell surface, followed by activation of the MAPK13
  signaling pathway and mucin gene expression
