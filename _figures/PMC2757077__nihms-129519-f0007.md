caption: Nascent glycoproteins interact with the ER-resident chaperone calnexin (CNX)
  where they are either folded correctly and are released for subsequent trafficking
  to the Golgi apparatus (1) or in the case of misfolded proteins, re-enter the calnexin
  cycle in an attempt to facilitate their maturation. If folding remains unproductive,
  the substrate becomes the target for demannosylation by ER α-mannosidase I to a
  Man8GlcNac2 form (2). The trimmed mannose structure is recognized by EDEM and displaced
  from the CNX cycle (3). Further demannosylation to a Man5 or Man6 form occurs by
  the actions of either ER resident mannosidases (α-mannosidase I or possibly EDEM3),
  or in the case of cycling between the ER and the Golgi apparatus, Golgi Mannosidase
  I (4). By analogy to Yos9p, these lower mannose structures may be part of the signal
  recognized by XTP3-B and OS-9 (5). OS-9 scaffolds the ER chaperones GRP94 and BiP
  which may also help to prevent aggregation or facilitate unfolding of the substrate.
  OS-9/XTP3-B complexes bound to substrate subsequently interact with the lumenal
  domain of SEL1L (potentially through their MRH domains) which may facilitate the
  release of substrate in the case of OS-9 (6). XTP3-B forms a stable ternary complex
  with SEL1L and Hrd1 (7). For OS-9, binding to SEL1L displaces GRP94 and the substrate
  is transferred to the Hrd1-SEL1L complex (8). The final step is release of OS-9
  and dislocation of the substrate by the dislocation apparatus and subsequent ubiquitination
  in the cytoplasm (9). In an alternative pathway, misfolded, non-glycosylated proteins
  may also enter this pathway, perhaps through interactions with XTP3-B (10).
