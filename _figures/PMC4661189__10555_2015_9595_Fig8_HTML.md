caption: Proposed EPLIN signalling pathways and implications for loss in cancer. When
  cancer is not present, EPLIN associates with the actin cytoskeleton linking the
  cadherin–catenin complex to F-actin via interaction with α-catenin. The signal transduction
  protein, paxillin, interacts with EPLIN in the cytoplasm, and this complex likely
  stabilises actin dynamics. ERK phosphorylates EPLIN regulating cell motility and
  migration. When cancer is present and EPLIN is lost, the actin cytoskeleton becomes
  less organised and this induces membrane ruffling. Paxillin targeting is likely
  lost reducing focal adhesion between the cadherin–catenin complex and actin. These
  molecular, cellular and morphological consequences may result in increased metastatic
  potential including enhanced cell migration and motility. Signalling pathways summarised
