caption: Feedback mechanisms regulating p38α. Inflammatory signals, such as TNFα and
  IL-1β, can activate the p38 pathway. Two downstream kinases of p38 are MK2 and MSK1/2.
  MK2 can promote an increase in TNFα, IL-1β and IL-6. These pro-inflammatory cytokines
  can then feed back onto the cell, activating the same pathway and amplifying the
  inflammation. MSK1/2 produces the phosphatase DUSP1, which dephosphorylates and
  deactivates p38. Two antiinflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10 are also regulated
  by MSK1/2 activation. These cytokines have the potential to antagonize the effects
  of IL-1β and suppress the inflammatory response.
