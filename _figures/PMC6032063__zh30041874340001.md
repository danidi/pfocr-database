caption: Heme catabolic pathway. Heme contains a porphyrin ring and a central iron
  atom. In heme degradation, heme oxygenase breaks open the porphyrin ring with NADPH
  and oxygen (O2) resulting in the release of iron (Fe), carbon monoxide (CO), and
  biliverdin. Biliverdin is reduced by biliverdin reductase to bilirubin. Reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) can recycle bilirubin back to biliverdin. In the liver, bilirubin
  is conjugated with glucuronic acid by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) and
  excreted into the bile.
