caption: The biosynthesis of sLeX and GDP-Fuc. A, the last and usually rate-limiting
  step in sLeX biosynthesis is the transfer of a Fuc residue onto a sialylated type
  2 glycan precursor by FUTs. B, GDP-Fuc (X = O), the donor sugar for FUTs, is biosynthesized
  by cells de novo from GDP-mannose in a process requiring the sequential action of
  GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase (GMD) and GDP-keto-6-deoxymannose 3,5-epimerase (GDE).
  Alternatively, a salvage pathway converts free cytosolic fucose into GDP-Fuc upon
  its phorphorylation by fucose kinase (FUK) followed by the reversible condensation
  of fucose-1-phosphate with GTP by GDP-Fuc pyrophosphorylase (GFPP). The first steps
  of both pathways are subjected to feedback inhibition by GDP-Fuc. We hypothesize
  that 5T-Fuc (X = S) will be activated as GDP-5T-Fuc by the fucose salvage pathway
  and, if it is a poor substrate for FUTs, such as those that make sLeX, it may lead
  to the feedback inhibition of GDP-Fuc.
