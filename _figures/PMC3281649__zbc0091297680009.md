caption: Proposed model for the inhibition of Notch1 signaling pathway by Fe65. Fe65
  suppresses Notch1 signaling via an acceleration of the degradation of NEXT in the
  cytoplasm. Notch1 is capable of forming a trimeric complex with Itch and Fe65. Fe65
  enhanced the protein degradation of NEXT via the Itch-dependent proteasomal pathway.
  Additionally, Fe65 suppresses Notch1 transcriptional activity via the dissociation
  of the Notch1-IC-RBP-Jk complex in the nucleus.
