caption: 'First, CD147 colocalizes and interacts with integrin in the invasion and
  metastasis of tumor cells via integrin α3β1-mediated FAK-paxillin and FAK-PI3K-Ca2+
  signal pathways and integrin α6β1-mediated PI3K-Ca2+signaling pathways, respectively.
  Second, the annexin II−CD147 interaction is involved in rearranging the cytoskeleton
  via inhibiting Rho signaling pathways and amoeboid movement by CD147 through inhibiting
  annexin II phosphorylation in the EMS, thus promoting membrane localization of WAVE2,
  Rac1 activation, formation of lamellipodia and mesenchymal movement via the integrin-FAK-PI3K/PIP3
  signaling pathway. Third, CD147 stimulates tumor angiogenesis by elevating VEGF
  and MMPs via PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. In addition, CD147 is involved in EMT via
  a signaling cascade: TGF-β−PI3K/Akt−GSK3β−Snail−Slug−CD147. Finally, CD147 expression
  protects tumor cells from anoikis and starvation-induced autophagy at least in part
  by reducing Bim and downregulating autophagy-relating gene ATG6/Beclin1, respectively.
