caption: Retinoids absorbed from food are converted to retinol and bound to CRBP in
  the intestine. Then, retinol is converted to retinyl esters and enters into blood
  circulation. The liver up takes retinyl esters, which are converted to retinol-RBP
  complex in the hepatocyte. In the serum, the retinol-RBP complex is bound to transthyretin
  (TTR) in a 1:1 ratio to prevent elimination by the kidney and to ensure retinol
  is delivered to the target cell. The uptake of retinol by the target cell is mediated
  by a trans-membrane protein named “stimulated by retinoic acid 6” (STRA6), which
  is a RBP receptor. In the target cell, retinol either binds to CRBP or is oxidized
  to retinaldehyde by retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) in a reversible reaction. Then,
  retinaldehyde can be oxidized by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH) to RA. In the
  target cell, RA either binds to CRABP or enters the nucleus and binds to nuclear
  receptors to regulate gene transcription. Alternatively, RA can mediate via nongenomic
  mechanism and regulate cellular function. Hepatocytes not only process retinoids,
  but also are the target cells. In addition, hepatocytes located next to the storage
  site (stellate cell). Thus, retinoid-mediated signaling must have a profound effect
  in regulating hepatocyte function and phenotype [, , ]
