caption: Estrogenic effects on gp130 signaling. gp130 signaling plays an important
  role in the injured brain. Although quiescent in the healthy brain, on injury, STAT3
  activation leads to transcription of genes that promote cell survival. STAT3 gene
  deletion studies show enhanced neuronal apoptosis and increased infarct size after
  middle cerebral artery occlusion. Estrogen has been shown to increase levels of
  activated STAT3; however, estrogen also increases inhibitors of the pathway, ERK1/2
  and SOCS3. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; VEFG, vascular endothelial growth
  factor.
