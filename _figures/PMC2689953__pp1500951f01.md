caption: Myoinositol synthesis and metabolism pathway. De novo synthesis of myoinositol
  (i.e. the Loewus pathway) is catalyzed by myoinositol phosphate synthase (MIPS)
  and IMP, where its immediate precursor is d-Ins 3-P = l-Ins 1-P. IMP also regenerates
  myoinositol from the second messenger d-Ins(1,4,5)P3. Oxidation of inositol by myoinositol
  oxygenase (MIOX) produces d-GlcUA (d-GlcA), which is a possible entry point into
  ascorbate synthesis. The major route to ascorbate in plants is the Smirnoff-Wheeler
  pathway and utilizes GDP-d-Man. VTC4 has homology to the animal IMPs and has been
  shown to catalyze the conversion of l-Gal 1-P to l-Gal in the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway.
  Inositol is also the precursor for the synthesis of several compounds indicated
  in gray. The asterisk indicates the inositol signaling pathway.
