caption: 'Interplay between CD 36 and AMPK in modulating cellular metabolic pathways
  with adequate or excess dietary fat, in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.
  CD36 contributes, under excessive fat supply, to lipid accumulation and metabolic
  dysfunction signaling (Pepino et al., ) and might influence AMPK activation (Samovski
  et al., ). In presence of excess exogenous FA concentrations CD36 is diysfunctional
  and suppresses AMPK, and might contribute to the reported association of CD36 variants
  with metabolic complications of obesity in humans. Physiologically adequate CD36-FA
  interactions activates AMPK (Samovski et al., ) contributing to the maintenance
  of cellular fatty acids homeostasis. Pointing out on the importance of CD36 in cellular
  fatty acid homeostasis, CD36-deficient mice are resistant to alcohol- and high-carbohydrate-induced
  hepatic steatosis (Clugston et al., ). Therefore, CD36, in particular dysmetabolic
  conditions, by suppressing AMPK activation, may enhance DNL and thereby promote
  cancer cell proliferation. Indeed, it has been recently shown that cancer cells
  that express high levels of the fatty acid receptor CD36 and lipid metabolism genes,
  are unique in their ability to initiate metastasis in the presence of an excess
  of dietary fat (Pascual et al., ). Arrows in red depict metabolic dysfunction pathways,
  in blue physiological pathways. Abbreviations: FA, fatty acids; PPP, pentose-phosphate
  pathway.'
