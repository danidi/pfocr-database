caption: 'Structure and signaling from the cilium and relationship with the autophagic
  pathway. Cilia are microtubule-based structures that project from the plasma membrane
  (PM) to the extracellular environment and act as sensory antennas. Cilia are formed
  of a basal body, a transition zone (transition fibers and ciliary necklace) and
  an axoneme. Inset A schematically shows the PC structure of nine microtubule doublets
  and the MC structure of nine microtubules doublets and two single central doublets.
  Inset B presents two ciliogenesis models for the PC: (1) Representation of the ciliogenesis
  in polarized cells, where the basal body docks directly to the PM. (2) Representation
  of the intracellular pathway during which a ciliary vesicle grows around the mother
  centriole and the axoneme. This vesicle later fuses with the PM and forms the ciliary
  pocket (in blue). The PC function as sensors signaling pathway ligands, which dock
  withreceptors (such as Ptc1 and PDGFRα) located on the axoneme, orions (e.g., Ca2+)
  to mediate transcription of target genes (see the text for details). PC also respond
  to mechanical stimuli (e.g., fluid flow/shear stress) via, for example, the recruitment
  of Lkb1 and AMPK at the axoneme and basal body, respectively, in order to regulate
  the cell volume through mTOR. Ciliogenesis and the autophagic pathway are interconnected.
  Several ciliary proteins are degraded by autophagy (see ). IFT20, which interacts
  with ATG16L, regulates the trafficking of ciliary components from the Golgi to the
  cilium. The table shows the localization of the ATG machinery induction in the basal
  body and/or in the axoneme in complete medium or upon serum starvation. ‘ND'' means
  ‘not determined'' (from results Pampliega et al.)'
