caption: A mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis promotion via HBV-induced ROS accumulation.
  HBV replication induces intracellular ROS levels. Elevated ROS production then increases
  IL-6 production. IL-6 overexpression activates STAT3 via autocrine signaling, which
  causes increased expressions of a series of oncogenes, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Cyclin
  D1 and VEGF. Commonly, IL-6/STAT3 pathway is negatively regulated by SOCS3, a target
  gene of STAT3, through a negative feedback loop. However, HBV-induced ROS overproduction
  can increase the expression of Snail, which silences SOCS3 expression via hypermethylation
  of SOCS3 promoter and leads to constitutive activation of STAT3, finally contributing
  to hepatocarcinogenesis of HBV-associated HCC
