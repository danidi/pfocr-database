caption: 'Sensory cortex carries cue information to the striatum through synapses
  onto medium spiny neurons (MSN). There are different MSNs for different actions
  (e.g., LEFT or RIGHT; L/R), and these form separate streams related to different
  actions in the downstream GPe, GPi, thalamus, and premotor cortex. Some MSNs have
  D1 receptors and form the direct pathway to the output structures of the basal ganglia,
  the Globus Pallidus interna (GPi) and Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr), both
  of which are spontaneously active () and reduce activity in premotor cortex via
  a thalamic intermediary (). Reward, via dopamine elevation from the Substantia Nigra
  pars compacta (SNc), leads to LTP of cortical inputs to the MSN-D1 that led to the
  rewarded action. This change promotes the rewarded action on subsequent trials by
  the following mechanism: the strengthened input to the direct pathway inhibits GPi/SNr,
  thereby removing a negative bias from premotor cortex and allowing action selection
  by a winner-take-all process in that structure (). Aversive stimulation, via a decrease
  in dopamine, leads to LTP on the MSN-D2 cells that represent the chosen action.
  These cells, via the indirect pathway (with globus pallidus externa (GPe) as an
  intermediary), increase the inhibitory output of the basal ganglia, making action
  less likely. Connections from premotor cortex to striatum (dashed green lines) may
  selectively enable the possible actions in the current context (i.e., L and R).
  Furthermore, after the action is finally chosen in premotor cortex and then executed,
  “chose action” activity in this pathway () can insure that credit is correctly assigned
  to the chosen action ().'
