caption: Anther and pollen development gene regulation network for Arabidopsis and
  rice from anther cell specification to mature pollen formation Comparisons between
  species show similarities in the regulation of pollen development; unconnected regions
  and “?” indicate where regulatory network is still undefined. Colors correspond
  to equivalent orthologs.
