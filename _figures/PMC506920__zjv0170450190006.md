caption: Changes in transcripts associated with the DNA synthesis pathway. A grey
  bar indicates that gene did not achieve reproducibility in ≥12 of 16 comparisons.
  The colored bars indicate the fold difference relative to controls (see inset) of
  transcripts that were reproducibly changed in ≥12 of 16 comparisons.
