caption: A mixed substrate approach to delineate multiple potential pathways of steroid
  metabolism in primary prostate tissues. A) The 5α-dione pathway bypasses T as an
  obligate precursor in metastatic CRPC. In normal male physiology, DHT biosynthesis
  first involves gonadal conversion of DHEA to T, which is subsequently 5α-reduced
  by the prostate (“conventional” pathway; left), primarily via 5α-reductase isoenzyme-2
  (SRD5A2). In contrast, DHT biosynthesis from adrenal DHEA by CRPC likewise requires
  conversion to AD, but AD is 5α-reduced to 5α-dione via 5α-reductase isoenzyme-1
  (SRD5A1), which is then 17-keto reduced to DHT (5α-dione pathway; right). Enzymatic
  steps occurring in target tissues are denoted by colored arrows. B) Expression of
  the two 5α-reductase isoenzymes differs between primary disease and CRPC. Although
  AD is the preferred substrate of 5α-reductase in CRPC, the preferred substrate and
  directionality of adrenal steroid metabolism in primary prostate tissues remains
  unclear. C-E) 13C3 labeling enables precise determination and comparison of metabolic
  flux from two potential substrates of 5α-reductase. Metabolites from the 13C3 isotopologue
  of AD can be differentiated from that of unlabeled T based on enrichment of an M+3
  (13C3) fragment detected by mass spectrometry.
