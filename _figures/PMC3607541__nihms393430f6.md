caption: 'Neutrophil pathway (left side): TMPD treatment results in the release of
  IL-1α, likely from necrotic cells. In target cells such as mesothelial cells or
  peritoneal exudate cells, IL-1α stimulates the IL-1R complex, which initiates a
  signaling cascade that requires MyD88 and IRAKs, culminating in the activation of
  NFκB and production of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL5. Neutrophils migrate
  to CXCL5 via a CXCR2-dependent mechanism. Monocyte pathway (right side): TMPD treatment
  results in the activation of TLR-7, which elicits the production of IFN-I through
  a MyD88-and IRAK-4-dependent pathway. IFN-I binds to IFNAR and subsequent signaling
  events result in the production of IFN-stimulated chemokines including CCL2, CCL7
  and CCL2. These chemokines mediate the migration of Ly6Chi monocytes through their
  interaction with CCR2.'
