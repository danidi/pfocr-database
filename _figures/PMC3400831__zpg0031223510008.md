caption: PGI2 metabolism and vascular disorders in premature and full-term newborn.
  In the premature newborn, PRs and endogenous modulators of PG metabolic pathways
  are not fully developed and thereby predispose to certain neonatal vascular disorders.
  In ductus arteriosus (DA) of premature newborn, the increased PGIS, decreased phosphodiesterase
  (PDE) and cAMP metabolism, and increased vasodilator EP4 receptor, together with
  decreased PGE2 catabolism in the lung, lead to increased PGI2 and PGE2 availability
  and vasodilator sensitivity, impaired DA constriction at birth, and patent DA. In
  the brain, prematurity is associated with increased COX2, decreased PDE, and decreased
  vasoconstrictor EP1 and EP3 receptors, which, together with decreased PGE2 catabolism
  in the lung, lead to increased PGI2 and PGE2 production and sensitivity in the cerebral
  circulation, narrow cerebral BP autoregulation, and increased blood flow to immature
  cerebral vasculature and result in intraventricular hemorrhage. In addition, in
  the brain, perinatal cerebral hypoxia and ischemia increase COX2 expression and
  PGI2 and PGE2 production, leading to increased CBF to ischemic tissue, reperfusion
  injury, neurovascular cell damage, and hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Increased
  COX2 activity also increases ROS that favors increased TXAS activity over PGIS,
  leading to increased TXA2 production and further increase in neurovascular cell
  injury. In the retina, similar to the brain, prematurity could affect the PG pathway
  with increased COX2, decreased PDE, decreased vasoconstrictor EP1 and EP3 receptors,
  increased PGI2 and PGE2 production and vascular sensitivity to vasodilating PGE2,
  resulting in narrow retinal BP autoregulation, and reperfusion injury, leading to
  retinopathy of prematurity. Because of the immature antioxidant system in the premature
  retina, the increased oxygen saturation accompanying the increase in retinal blood
  flow results in increased ROS that leads to increased TXA2synthesis, and further
  retinal vascular damage and aggravation of retinopathy of prematurity. In an ill
  newborn, perinatal hypoxia or sepsis causes pulmonary vascular damage and endothelial
  dysfunction, leading to deficient PGI2 and increased TXA2 production in pulmonary
  vessels, increased PVR, and PPHN. Modulators of PG synthesis/activity such as indomethacin
  and EP4 antagonist inhibit the increase in the vasodilator PGI2 and PGE2 production
  and activity in PDA. Indomethacin could decrease the increased cerebral production
  of PGI2 and PGE2, contributing to intraventricular hemorrhage. A specific IP2 analog
  15R-TIC is cytoprotective in hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Antioxidants and TXAS
  inhibitors decrease ROS and TXA2 in reperfusion injuries of the neonatal retina.
  IP receptor agonists can compensate for the deficient PGI2 activity in PPHN.
