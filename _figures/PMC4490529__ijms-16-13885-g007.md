caption: Schematic model of DMF-induced neuroprotection in rat NPCs and differentiated
  neurons. Under oxidative stress (H2O2), DMF enhances Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response
  gene transcription through activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway leading to
  neuroprotection in rNPCs and differentiated neurons.
