caption: Self-regulation in Xenopus dorsal-ventral patterning.The pathway consists
  of a network of BMP-interacting proteins. The diagram indicates extracellular biochemical
  protein–protein interactions as black arrows, transcriptional regulation under the
  control of BMP signaling as green arrows, and the directional flow of Chordin–BMP
  complexes from the dorsal to the ventral side of the embryo as red arrows.
