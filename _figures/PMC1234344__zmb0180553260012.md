caption: Model of IQGAP1 functioning as a scaffold in the MAP kinase pathway. (A)
  When the concentration of the scaffolding protein, IQGAP1, is too low, functional
  IQGAP1 complexes containing MEK and ERK are unable to form. (B) At the optimal scaffold
  concentration, the kinases are in an appropriate stoichiometric ratio with IQGAP1.
  Functional MAP kinase signaling complexes are formed. (C) When the concentration
  of IQGAP1 is excessive, many different IQGAP1 molecules harboring only one of the
  components of the cascade form complexes, which cannot function optimally. The binding
  site for ERK2 on IQGAP1 is the region containing the polyproline binding domain
  (WW) and that of MEK is the region spanning the calmodulin-binding motif (IQ). Raf
  binding to IQGAP1 has not been documented.
