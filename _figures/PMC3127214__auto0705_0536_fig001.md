caption: Autophagy and Akt promote survival in glioma. Induction of apoptosis in response
  to inhibition of PtdIns3K-Akt and mTOR kinase required inhibition of autophagy.
  Autophagy is a survival pathway in this setting, as a dual PtdIns3K-mTOR inhibitor
  induces apoptosis in Atg5 knockout, but not in Atg5 wild-type MEFs. Inhibition of
  PtdIns3K-Akt neither blocks mTOR nor induces autophagy, and therefore does not cause
  apoptosis in combination with inhibition of autophagy. Allosteric inhibition of
  mTORC1 does induce autophagy, but also activates Akt as a second survival signal.
  Unlike allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, inhibition of mTOR (kinase) blocks both
  mTORC1 and mTORC2, induces apoptosis in conjunction with blockade of autophagy,
  and does not activate Akt. Importantly, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) treatment of glioma
  cells transduced with AKT-ER (an allele of Akt fused to the steroid binding domain
  of the estrogen receptor) leads to activation of Akt, and blocks apoptosis driven
  by inhibition of PtdIns3K, mTOR and autophagy. Thus, apoptosis in response to combining
  inhibitors of mTOR with inhibitors of autophagy also requires inhibition of Akt.

  description: Autophagy and Akt promote survival in glioma. Induction of apoptosis
    in response to inhibition of PtdIns3K-Akt and mTOR kinase required inhibition
    of autophagy. Autophagy is a survival pathway in this setting, as a dual PtdIns3K-mTOR
    inhibitor induces apoptosis in Atg5 knockout, but not in Atg5 wild-type MEFs.
    Inhibition of PtdIns3K-Akt neither blocks mTOR nor induces autophagy, and therefore
    does not cause apoptosis in combination with inhibition of autophagy. Allosteric
    inhibition of mTORC1 does induce autophagy, but also activates Akt as a second
    survival signal. Unlike allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, inhibition of mTOR (kinase)
    blocks both mTORC1 and mTORC2, induces apoptosis in conjunction with blockade
    of autophagy, and does not activate Akt. Importantly, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT)
    treatment of glioma cells transduced with AKT-ER (an allele of Akt fused to the
    steroid binding domain of the estrogen receptor) leads to activation of Akt, and
    blocks apoptosis driven by inhibition of PtdIns3K, mTOR and autophagy. Thus, apoptosis
    in response to combining inhibitors of mTOR with inhibitors of autophagy also
    requires inhibition of Akt.
