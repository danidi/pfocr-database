caption: Illustration of the Hippo pathway and its regulation in mammalian cells.
  Yes-associated protein (YAP) and TAZ complex with TEAD can activate several cellular
  functions in the nucleus. The Hippo pathway function is to prevent YAP/TAZ activity
  by phosphorylating them, which causes their cytoplasmic retention, by 14–3–3 proteins,
  or their ubiquitination, by the Skp, Cullin, F-box (SCF) complex. The regulation
  of the Hippo pathway by upstream membrane receptors is not a comprehensively studied
  topic.
