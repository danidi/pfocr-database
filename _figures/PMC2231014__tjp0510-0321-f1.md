caption: Activation of smooth muscle A1 adenosine receptors (site 1) elicits a vasoconstrictor
  response of the afferent arteriole which is synergistically modulated by angiotensin
  II via AT1 receptors (site 2). Renal interstitial adenosine levels are elevated
  during an increased ATP/ADP breakdown (sites 3 and 4). A major pathway for the removal
  of adenosine from the interstitial space occurs via the nucleoside transporter (NT;
  site 5). A1 adenosine receptors are blocked by the specific receptor antagonist
  DPCPX. The nucleoside transporter is inhibited by dipyridamole.
