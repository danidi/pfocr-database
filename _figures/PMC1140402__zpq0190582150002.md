caption: A schematic representation of the central carbon metabolism of E. coli (adapted
  from ref. ). Experimental fluxes are labeled v1–v24 and are measured in the direction
  of the arrows. Note that in some cases, flux flows in the opposite direction and
  is measured by a negative value. The thick arrows highlight the short alternative
  pathway (v19–v18–v21) predicted by ROOM in response to the knockout of pyk (marked
  with an X) under medium-glucose growth conditions. Major changes in flux along this
  pathway were experimentally determined (). See the supporting information for the
  mapping between the experimental fluxes and model reactions. (Note that unlabeled
  reactions such as 6PG to KDPG were not experimentally measured.)
