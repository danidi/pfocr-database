caption: 'The glucocorticoid receptor, regulation of gene expression, and its clinical
  consequences. (A) The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and regulation of the CLOCK gene
  family. This pathway contributes to regulation of circadian rhythmicity, and is
  driven by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and metabolic inputs from liver.
  Of all the thousands of genes whose expression is regulated by the GR, the most
  highly regulated include members of the CLOCK gene family such as PER1 (). Products
  of ARNTL and CLOCK form a heterodimer that acts a transcription factor and binds
  to the E-box (E) in the promoter of other GR-regulated CLOCK and related genes,
  including CRY, PER, NR1D1, and RORA. In general, both CRY and PER genes are expressed
  in a circadian manner, acting either by repressing the CLOCK:ARNTL heterodimer,
  or blocking GR from binding to the GR response element (GRE) sequence. This latter
  mechanism is described in the section: GR rhythmicity, dysregulation, and the brain–gut
  axis. NR1D1 and RORA form a heterodimer that acts as a transcription factor that
  binds to the RORE sequence that is located in genes such as ARNTL. The ARNTL protein
  also acts independently of its role as a transcription factor to mediate translational
  control of specific proteins in a circadian manner (). (B) Overview of results from
  the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium. Chromosomes are located in chromatin-bound
  territories in the nucleus. Euchromatin is characterized by DNase 1 hypersensitivity
  and specific combinations of histone marks that define active genomic regulatory
  elements, such as promoters H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and enhancers H3K4me1 and H3K27ac.
  An enhancer can either increase or decrease transcription. Recent research demonstrates
  that, in brain, the DNA sequence CAC is a common site of methylation, in contrast
  to other tissues where CpG is most often methylated. Also, in brain, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
  (5hmC), a reactive species, is common. In contrast, in the periphery, methylcytosine
  (hmC) is common (). (C) Chronic and/or early life stress appear to lead to alteration
  of chromatin and allele-biased gene expression, concomitant with psychiatric disorders
  and comorbid conditions including irritable bowel syndrome. In such cases, allele
  skewing of transcription (, ) is most likely a consequence of epigenetic alterations
  arising from environmental adversity that contributes to a variety of stress-related
  disorders distinct from parental imprinting (, ). POLR2A polymerase (RNA) II (DNA
  directed) polypeptide A, 220kDa is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed gene
  that encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, the polymerase responsible
  for synthesizing messenger RNA in eukaryotes and, therefore, plays an important
  role in gene transcription. Allelic imbalance refers to differential expression
  of the maternal vs paternal allele. POLR2A, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II; H3K4me3,
  histone H3 trimethyl Lys4; H3K27ac, histone H3 Lys27 acetylation; H3Kme1, histone
