caption: 'Impact of IT on mitochondrion-related gene expression and on selected mitochondrial
  outcomes in tissues collected from UCD-T2DM rats at 1.5 mo-post surgery. A) Fatty
  acid synthesis was down-regulated in response to IT surgery. Decreased gene expression
  of malic enzyme, pyruvate carboxylase, and the malate-oxoglutarate transporter is
  shown as red font. B) The lower synthesis of CL post-IT surgery is supported by
  the lower gene expression of key components of CL biosynthesis: CRLS1, lysocardiolipin
  acyltransferase (LCLAT1), CDP-diacylglycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyl transferase
  (PGS1), phosphatidylglycerophosphatase and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTPMT1),
  and tafazzin (TAZ). C) The activities of CS and complex IV (CCO) were evaluated
  in the indicated tissues at 1.5 mo post-IT (n = 10) or sham surgery (n = 10). Experimental
  details are presented in the Materials and Methods section. Activities were expressed
  as mU/mg [nmol product × (min × mg protein)−1] and they are shown as natural log
  of the fold-change relative to sham surgery. Statistical analysis was performed
  using the 2-tailed Student’s t test.'
