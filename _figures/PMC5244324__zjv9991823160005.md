caption: Suggested model scheme of the c-Src signaling pathway being induced and hijacked
  by IBDV to facilitate its infectious entry. Subsequent to binding to cell receptors,
  IBDV takes advantage of clathrin-independent endocytosis to be internalized () and
  is subsequently unlocked from endosomes through a viral structural peptide pep46-mediated
  endosomal membrane penetration mechanism (). Our data suggest that IBDV activates
  and hijacks the integrin-dependent c-Src–PI3K/Akt–RhoA–actin signaling axis, which
  plays an essential role in promoting these early processes of IBDV entry. First,
  actin rearrangement can mediate membrane ruffling and blebbing and create protrusions
  that encompass viral particles for endocytosis. Second, it is also likely that the
  actin rearrangement driven by IBDV-induced c-Src signaling may have an impact on
  IBDV endosomal penetration to promote the release of IBDV particles from endosomes
  to the cytosol (). Third, IBDV-induced c-Src–PI3K/Akt–RhoA–actin signaling may play
  a role in other steps of the IBDV life cycle, e.g., promoting postendocytic trafficking
  of the virus-containing endosomal vesicles and influencing the spread of the viruses
  via the regulation of intercellular connections ().
