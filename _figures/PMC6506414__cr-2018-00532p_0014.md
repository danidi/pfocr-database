caption: N-Linked glycan (A) and the calnexin cycle (B). As proteins are translocated
  into the ER membrane they are tagged with a 14-sugar moiety at N-X-S/T (where X
  is any amino acid but P) sequence motifs as shown in panel A. This post-translational
  modification serves a multitude of functions for the protein including increasing
  hydrophilicity, preventing aggregation, influencing tertiary contacts, and serving
  as a folding “barcode”. Through sequential cleavage of monosaccharides (gray dotted
  lines), the folding polypeptide can be engaged with different lectin chaperones
  involved in either ERAF or ERAD. The enzymes responsible for cleaving various glyosidic
  linkages are shown. The predominant folding pathway for glycosylated proteins is
  shown in panel B. Monoglucosylated proteins (1) are engaged by the membrane-anchored
  lectin chaperone calnexin (2, gray). Calnexin provides the protein with an isolated
  environment to fold, recruits essential cochaperones such as the disulfide isomerase
  ERp57 (cyan), and may also facilitate the proper tertiary packing of a MP by associating
  with exposed hydrophilic residues in the plane of the membrane. Association is transient;
  glucosidase II cleaves the terminal glucose residue on the glycan chain freeing
  the client polypeptide from engagement with calnexin. Proteins that have yet to
  attain their proper tertiary structure (3), are sensed by UGGT1 (orange) and reglucosylated,
  allowing reentry into the calnexin cycle (1). Proteins that have obtained their
  proper structure and post-translational modifications (particularly disulfide bonding)
  are sensed by UGGT1 and funneled toward the ER export machinery for ER exit (4).
  Polypeptides that fail to complete folding after consecutive cycles are eventually
  funneled out of the cycle and targeted for ERAD by the action of mannosidases.
