caption: 'Proposed molecular interaction between two neuropathologies such as major
  depressive disorder and Alzheimer’s disease. It is impossible to avoid complexity,
  by reason of the many genotypes and phenotypes involved. Two molecular “cascades”
  are sketched and greatly simplified, as many more enzymes, proteins, transcription
  factors, genome changes, to name a few, are involved, opening new fields of research
  and therapeutic applications.A. Cortisol Depression Cascade. The currently established
  genome of more than 40% of chronic, long-standing, depressed-anxious-stressed patients
  – which are short mutant alleles of the serotonin transporter protein genes (5-HTT)
  carriers – induces a vulnerability to the personality threshold to withstand normal
  and severe life adversities and diseases. Significantly, in more (40–50%) carriers
  of 5-HTT short alleles than not, they develop depressive major crises or chronic
  dysthymia with long term, severe anxiety and stress. Chronic depression elevates
  corticotrophin release factor, activating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis
  and increasing cortisol levels significantly, particularly in hippocampal areas
  with glycocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors. Neurotransmitters are led to
  dyshomeostasis and glucose uptake falls in hippocampal neurons. Glutamate receptors
  (NMDARs) in particular are robustly activated, and intracellular Calcium elevated.
  These two factors contribute to oxidative stress and, directly, to inhibition of
  hippocampal neurogenesis and atrophy, impairing its inhibition of CRF and elevating
  its levels, closing the cycle.B. The “Aging Alzheimer Cascade” progresses during
  late life, influencing and influenced by free radicals – reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), oxidative stress, redox transition metals
  – iron (Fe) and copper (Cu), and increased deposition of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ)
  as a consequence of increased levels of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP); and
  of Tau and Apolipoprotein Eε4 (ApoEε4). During aging, two main factors may contribute
  to close the cycle: 1 - accumulation of free radicals-oxidative stress with damage
  to proteins, fatty acids, glycoproteins, DNA; and 2 - genetic vulnerability: mutant
  alleles in specific genes leading to dysfunction of the many complex – defense and
  pathological - roles of the key proteins in AD: AβPP, Aβ, Tau, ApoE4; possible accumulation,
  with long-term life repetitions, of “transcriptional continuity errors”, and other
  unknown factors. Finally, the advent of Alzheimer’s disease closes the cycle, since
  it means fast brain aging. The figure does not indicate whether AD is the normal
  final pathway--a closed system with no entries or deaths, at 100 years of age, persons
  without AD are the absolute minority (17–20%); and AD individuals are the majority
  (70–80%) ().This Figure, which exhibits the various interactions of both cascades,
  raises the question of whether these pathologies are analogous or very close biological
  processes which occur sequentially during the life cycles.'
