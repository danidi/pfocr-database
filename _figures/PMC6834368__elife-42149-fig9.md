caption: (A) After ovarian cysts enter meiosis, meiotic DSBs function to activate
  and/or maintain a GATOR1/TSC dependent pathway to ensure low TORC1 activity in early
  prophase of meiosis I. Low TORC1 activity promotes the timely repair of meiotic
  DSBs. Currently, whether meiotic DSBs directly activate the GATOR1/TSC pathway or
  an alternative pathway that works in concert with, or in parallel to, GATOR1/TSC
  is not known. (B) Subsequently, the GATOR2 component Mio is required to attenuate
  the activity of the GATOR1/TSC pathway, thus allowing for increased TORC1 activity
  and the growth and development of the oocyte in later stages of oogenesis.
