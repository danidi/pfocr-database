caption: 'Potential regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and function. In the myocyte
  (A), glucose is taken up via glucose transporter 4 (glut4), activated to glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P), and then oxidized in the mitochondria or stored as glycogen. Free fatty acids
  are taken up via LPL and fatty acid transporter proteins (fatp1, CD36) and activated
  to fatty acyl coenzyme A (FACoA). FACoA can be oxidized in the mitochondria or stored
  as triglycerides or can favor the formation of diacylglycerols (DAG) and/or ceramides,
  thus inhibiting insulin signaling by protein kinase C-θ (PKCθ)/IRS-1 pathway and/or
  protein kinase B-2 (Akt2) phosphorylation, respectively. Both glucose and lipid
  oxidation fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle and serve to produce ATP. Black dashed
  arrows represent genetic predispositions and lifestyle interventions affecting mitochondrial
  biogenesis/function via different mechanisms (white arrows): inherited factors associate
  with decreased LPL activity and PPARδ-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis; single
  nucleotide polymorphism of NDUFB6 gene predisposes to impaired mitochondrial plasticity
  in response to exercise; and resveratrol, fasting/exercise, and nutrients increase
  mitochondrial biogenesis/function by increasing PGC1α activity via sirtuins, AMPK,
  and mTORC1, respectively. ROS have been associated with decreased mitochondrial
  function. In hepatocytes (B), free fatty acids are taken up via fatty acid transporter
  protein 5 (fatp5), activated to FACoA, and undergo similar metabolic pathway as
  in the myocyte. Decreased activity of IRS-2 associates with lower Foxo1 and mitochondrial
  function. Resveratrol increases while overloading with nutrients decreases sirtuins
  and mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, ROS impact negatively on the function of
  mitochondria. Acetyl-CoA, acetyl coenzyme A; ADP, adenosine diphosphate; GSK3, glycogen
  synthase kinase 3; HKII, hexokinase II; HSL, hormone sensitive lipase; PDH, pyruvate
  dehydrogenase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; SREBP, sterol regulatory element
  binding protein; TG, triglyceride. To see this illustration in color, the reader
