caption: The diagram depicts the S100B signaling pathway in SCA1. S100B activates
  the RAGE receptor producing ROS. Under normal conditions SOD inhibits high levels
  of ROS. However, due to expression of the mutant ataxin-1 protein, SOD function
  is reduced allowing ROS to accumulate, causing neurodegeneration in SCA1. This S100B
  induced oxidative damage pathway can be inhibited by TRTK12, Synb1-ELP-TRTK or like
  peptides.
