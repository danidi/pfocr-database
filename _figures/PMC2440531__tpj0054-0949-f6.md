caption: Putative metabolic pathway from α-tomatine to esculeoside A. Graphs show
  the relative abundance of indicated metabolites (gray arrows) in nor and rin mutant
  fruits (containing both peel and flesh) in comparison with wild-type Rutgers (WT),
  the background line of the mutants. Means ± SD of three biological repeats are indicated.
  Esculeoside A was almost absent in the fruits of nor and rin mutants. However, other
  intermediate glycoalkaloids accumulated at higher levels in nor and rin than WT.
  The result suggests that the final step of esculeoside A biosynthesis (glycosylation
  of C52H85NO24) is controlled by developmentally regulated ethylene production.
