caption: TORC1 and nitrogen regulation. Two pathways, one mediated by TORC1 and a
  second less well-defined nitrogen catabolite repression pathway, adjust growth as
  well as expression of genes required for use of alternate nitrogen sources in response
  to the quality and quantity of available nitrogen sources through regulation of
  transcriptional activators (blue icons) and repressors (red icons). TORC1 likely
  responds to intracellular amino acid levels sensed through the Ego complex and regulates
  growth primarily through Sch9, regulates stress, and alternative nitrogen source
  through protein phosphatase 2A and regulates permease sorting through Npr1. Npr2/3
  lie upstream of NCR gene expression but whether they regulate TORC1 or the ill-defined
  NCR pathway is not clear.
