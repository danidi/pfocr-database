caption: Ceramide generating pathways. Three major pathways for ceramide generation
  are shown here. Ceramide is synthesized via “de novo synthesis pathway” in endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER), which involves several enzymes including serine palmitoyltransferase
  (SPT, the initial sphingolipid synthesizing enzyme) and ceramide synthase (CerS).
  Ceramide can be generated by activation of neutral (n) or acid (a) SMases (“SMase
  pathway”), often found in the plasma membrane. In the “salvage pathway”, ceramide
  is synthesized by CerS from sphingosine released from the lysosome. Although not
  shown here, ceramide generation may also occur in the mitochondria, where ceramide
  generating enzymes, such as CerS, have been found. These pathways are activated
  by a variety of apoptotic inducers in various cell types including neurons as described
  in the text. (CDase, ceramidase; SphK, sphingosine kinase; SPPase, S1P phosphatase;
  GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; SMS, sphingomyelin synthase; GlcCer, glucosylceramide.)
