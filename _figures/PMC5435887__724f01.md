caption: Main genetic and signaling pathway alterations in UMs and CMs. Signaling
  modules implicated in CMs (blue box), UMs (orange boxes), and both lesions (gray
  box). Gain-of-function (red) and loss-of-function (green) mutations are indicated
  as well as genes mutated in both UM and CM (yellow star). In CM, growth factor binding
  to receptor tyrosine kinase or mutations trigger the activation of the RAS (Rous
  sarcoma)–BRAF–MEK–ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) and/or PI3K–AKT (protein
  kinase B)–mTOR signaling cascades. In UM, ligand binding to G-protein-coupled receptors
  (GPCRs), among which is CYSLTR2 (cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2), enables GNAQ/11
  [guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(q) subunit α/guanine nucleotide-binding protein
  subunit α-11] to signal to downstream effectors such as ARF6 (ADP-ribosylation factor
  6), TRIO, and PLCβ (phospholipase C β) and triggers activation of multiple signaling
  pathways. These pathways include the TRIO–RHO–RAC (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin)–YAP
  (yes-associated protein) cascade, which is involved in actin cytoskeleton reorganization
  and PKC (protein kinase C)–ERK, which controls cell proliferation. Moreover, BAP1,
  which is lost in a large proportion of UM, controls DNA integrity, proliferation,
  and survival of melanoma cells, the dysregulation of which is involved in transformation.
  Note that GNAQ/11 and BAP1 are also affected to a lesser extent in CMs.
