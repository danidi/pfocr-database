caption: Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identification of the enriched canonical pathways
  A) Production of ROS/RNS, B) Toll-like receptor signaling, and C) NF-κB signaling.
  Red, grey, and green nodes represent proteins within the pathway that were detected
  at <10%, 10-30%, and >30% CV, respectively.
