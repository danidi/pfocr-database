caption: The life cycle of connexin43 (Cx43). Cx43 synthesis is regulated by several
  transcriptional factors (Sp1, activator protein 1 complex, cyclic AMP, and the Wnt
  pathway) and epigenetic processes (histone modifications, DNA methylation, and microRNA
  species). Synthesized six Cx43 fold oligomerise to form a connexon in the endoplasmic
  reticulum (ER) and trans-Golgi network. Trafficked connexons to the plasma membrane
  become hemichannels as functional connexons, and dock with connexons on neighbouring
  cells to form gap-junctions. The trafficking process of connexons is regulated by
  various signalling systems, including phosphorylation, acetylation, nitrosylation,
  sumoylation, and ubiquitination. CLZ likely activates connexon trafficking via enhanced
  ubiquitylation via the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (pPKB). Both hemichannels
  and gap-junctions are low open probabilities during the resting stage; however,
  the elevation of extracellular potassium ions, the removal of extracellular calcium
  ions, or the depolarization activation of the hemichannel/gap-junction leading to
  the persistent opening of Cx43 containing channels. The internalisation of the gap-junction
  generates the connexosome (also known as an annular gap-junction). The connexosome
  is degraded by autophagy via the formation of an autophagosome or endocytic pathway.
  The Cx43 turn-over is very fast in the brain, and the half-life is several hours.
