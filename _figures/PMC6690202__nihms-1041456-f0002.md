caption: On the left is the TNFα-dependent canonical signaling pathway. The binding
  of TNFα to the TNF receptor, TNFR1, triggers the sequential recruitment of the adaptors,
  TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain protein), RIP (Receptor-interacting protein)
  and TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2), to the membrane. Then, TRAF2 mediates
  the recruitment of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, composed of IKKα, IKKβ and NEMO
  (NF-kappa-B essential modulator), to the TNFR1 signaling complex, which causes IKKβ
  activation. The activation of IKKβ leads to IκBα phosphorylation on specific residues,
  which induces polyubiquitination through the binding of ubiquitin proteins, finally
  leading to its degradation through the proteasome pathway. The p50-p65 heterodimer
  then binds to specific κB sites and activates a variety of NFκB target genes coding
  for pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-6) and chemokines. On the right is the
  alternative, non-canonical, pathway of NFκB activation. This pathway relies on the
  recruitment of the TRAF2-TRAF3 heterodimer to the CD40 receptor. TRAF3 links the
  E3 ligases c-IAP1/2 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1/2) to the kinase, NIK (NFκB-inducing
  kinase). NIK is activated by phosphorylation, and is also subjected to a c-IAP1/2-dependent
  degradative polyubiquitination. IKKα homodimers are activated by NIK and phosphorylate
  the inhibitory molecule, p100, the partial processing (via proteasomal degradation)
  of which generates the NFκB protein, p52. p52 moves into the nucleus as a heterodimer
  with RelB to regulate the expression of genes involved in lymphoid organogenesis
  or coding for chemokines.
