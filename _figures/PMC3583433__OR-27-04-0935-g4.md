caption: Hypothetical mechanism underlying the suppressive effect of UVC on pancreatic
  cancer cell migration. In pancreatic cancer cells, PDGF-BB strongly induces cell
  migration via the Akt pathway. However, UVC suppresses phosphorylation of Akt and
  subsequent GSK-3β, resulting in the inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell migration.
