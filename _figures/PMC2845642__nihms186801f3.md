caption: Signals delivered by the engagement of the TCR (signal 1) and costimulatory
  molecules (CD28; signal 2) induce different signaling pathways that result in the
  activation of multiple transcription factors. Ligation of the TCR by peptide–MHC
  on an APC triggers the recruitment of the TCR and signaling elements, e.g. phospholipase
  C-1 (PLC-1) for the Ca2+ influx–nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway
  and PKC- for the NF- B and AP-1 pathway, which control nuclear transcriptional and
  gene activation to lipid rafts. To induce differentiation to an IFN-γ producing
  Th1 cell, STAT4 activation coupled with NFAT activated by the TCR induces the expression
  of T-bet. In turn T-bet and NFAT induce the expression of IFN-γ. Current findings
  suggest that inhibition of PI3K, PKC, and PLC (in red) block CD80 induced increase
  in IFN-γ production. This supports the hypothesis that stimulation via CD80 on CD4+
  T cells positively regulates effector Th1 function. Cross-linking CD80 on T cells
  induces an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular proteins,
  and increases the level of IFN-γ and T-bet transcription. Findings indicate that
  cross-linking CD80 on CD4+ T cells activated in Th1-promoting conditions increases
  the level of IFN-γ produced by increasing the rate of IFN-γ transcription via the
  activation of a Ca2+-dependent signaling pathway.
