caption: (A) Hypothetical model showing the function of the BLR complex in carbon
  sensing. The BLR-1 and/or BLR-2 could perceive or transduce the signal originated
  from the lack of glucose detected by a sensor/receptor (CS) or due the lack of reducing
  power in the cell, via reactive oxygen species (ROS) originated from the mitochondria
  (M), resulting in the induction of gene expression. (B) Hypothetical model integrating
  the distinct elements that participate in blue-light perception in Trichoderma atroviride.
  Two independent light inputs are necessary induce conidiation. The BLR independent
  pathway could activate adenylyl cyclase (AC), leading to the production cAMP, which
  in turn binds to the PKA regulatory subunit (R), resulting in the activation of
  the catalytic subunit (C). Phosphodiesterase (PD) would regulate the levels of cAMP,
  exerting a negative control on photoconidiation. The increase in PKA activity would
  activate the BLR complex, triggering the expression of the blue-light-responsive
  genes; such a function may involve direct phosphorylation of either of the BLR proteins
  or phosphorylation of an as-yet-unidentified regulatory partner (TA). Alternatively,
  PKA may phosphorylate a putative transcription factor (TF), whose modification is
  necessary for gene activation. Noncontinuous lines indicate hypothetical steps.
