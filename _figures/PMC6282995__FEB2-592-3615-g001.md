caption: Retrograde neurotrophic signalling organelles and their main destinations
  after arrival to the cell body. Different types of signalling endosomes and their
  cellular destinations have been displayed on the top of a camera lucida trace of
  a mouse primary motor neuron in culture. The type of carriers and their sequential
  trafficking steps emerge from evidence collected using diverse experimental models,
  such as sensory, sympathetic, and motor neurons. Whether they are all present in
  every neuronal subtype is currently unknown. After being released by the target
  tissue, NGF and BDNF bind to TrkA (A) and TrkB (A’) respectively, triggering their
  phosphorylation and internalisation. TrkA‐NGF (B) and TrkB‐BDNF (B’) complexes enter
  the endocytic pathway and reach the early endosome, an organelle characterised by
  the presence of Rab5. Retrograde transport of Rab5‐positive carriers of TrkA‐NGF
  complex has been shown (thick arrow in B). Activated receptors are then sorted into
  a late endosome compartment (C), characterised by the presence of Rab7. This compartment
  can undergo retrograde axonal transport towards the soma, or progress along the
  endolysosomal route maturing into a multivesicular body (MBV; D), which contains
  both Rab7 and CD63. MVBs can also transport both receptor‐ligand complexes to the
  cell soma. In addition, autophagosomes have also been reported as retrograde carriers
  for TrkB‐BDNF (E). We have not included the origin of the autophagosome in the axonal
  tip, since it is still a matter of debate. After signalling endosomes reach the
  soma, there are sorted into a variety of destinations. Several lines of evidence
  indicate that neurotrophin receptors are delivered to somatic MVBs (F). TrkB‐BDNF
  in MVBs or single‐membrane vesicles can be either delivered to the plasma membrane
  or targeted to lysosomes for degradation (G). A subpopulation of TrkA‐NGF positive
  cargoes has been shown to be transported into dendrites (H), where it regulates
  synapse formation and maintenance. TrkA‐NGF complexes can also be recycled to the
  soma plasma membrane, where they might activate naïve TrkA receptors (I) and induce
  their recruitment to the anterograde axonal transport route in Rab11‐positive organelles
  (J). The activity of the endoplasmic reticulum‐resident phosphatase PTP1B is required
  to ensure that no activated TrkA is sorted into axons. In parallel, a pool of newly
  synthesised TrkA receptor is anterogradely transported in secretory vesicles characterised
  by the presence of Rab27, CRMP2 and Slp1 (K).
