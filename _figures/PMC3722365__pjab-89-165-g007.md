caption: Production of IQA from dopamine in E. coli. The “fundamental IQA synthetic
  module” for the production of (S)-reticuline, which is the key substance in the
  IQA synthetic pathway, was constructed in E. coli with the genes of four enzymes
  (NCS, 6OMT, CNMT and 4′OMT) cloned from C. japonica and a microbial enzyme (MAO).
