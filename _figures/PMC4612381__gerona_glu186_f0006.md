caption: 'Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway in aging adipose tissue:
  Compromised chaperoning system in the ER lumen, lipolysis and free fatty acids,
  hypoxia, proteasome dysfunction or autophagy defects might lead to ER stress in
  old adipose tissue. Cells respond to ER stress through three upstream signaling
  proteins—PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), Inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1α) and activating
  transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Upon activation PERK phosphorylates e-IF2α which
  inhibits protein translation to avoid further ER stress. Activated p-e-IF2a also
  activates ATF4 via noncanonical fashion, which leads to expression of gene of redox
  reactions, stress response, autophagy, and Chop. Cleaved ATF-6 activates transcription
  of uXBP1 which is cleaved by p-IRE1 to XBP1s. XBP1s induces the transcription of
  Chop, other chaperones and enzymes for protein folding such as disulphide-isomerase3a
  (Pdia3a), ER degradation manosidase 1 (Edem1) and ER Dnaj 4 (Erdj4). Activated p-IRE1
  activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) which activates transcription factors NF-κB
  and AP1 and induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines. Inflammatory cytokines
  might results in insulin resistance via JNK activation.'
