caption: (A) Two hypothetical compartments proposed to explain the key metabolic properties
  of dauer larvae (). Predicted fluxes are shown.(B) Analysis of maximum trehalose
  production in the microaerobic compartment in (A) as a function of oxygen availability.
  Black and grey curves were obtained with and without glyoxylate pathway (by constraining
  the relevant reactions to carry zero flux), respectively. Yellow region indicates
  the additional amount of trehalose that can be generated from the glyoxylate pathway.(C)
  Sensitivity of ATP generation in the anaerobic compartment to the flux in fumarate
  reductase (FR) reaction. The circle indicates the optimal point where energy is
  maximized.
