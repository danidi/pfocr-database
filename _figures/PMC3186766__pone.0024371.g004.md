number: Figure 4
caption: (A) The diagrams represent the different methods of IL-15 production. Green
  represents downregulation of pertinent molecules, red represents upregulation of
  pertinent molecules. WNV induces upregulation of the production of IL-15. (B) Red
  represents upregulation of gene expression, green represents down-regulation of
  gene expression. The JAK/STAT portion of the pathway is upregulated during viral
  infection, demonstrating an innate immune response. However, the SOCS3 molecule
  is also upregulated, indicating that infection with the virus may lead to subsequent
  suppression of the JAK/STAT pathway and evasion of the innate immune response. This
  network was generated through the use of IPA (Ingenuity Systems, www.ingenuity.com).
