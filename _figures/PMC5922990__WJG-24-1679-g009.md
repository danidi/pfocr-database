caption: 'Antiviral properties of naringenin. The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome consists
  of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA. HCV adopts an icosahedral structure with
  a lipid envelope and glycoproteins E1 and E2 immersed in the envelope. Underneath
  the envelope is the nucleocapsid, which is composed of multiple copies of core forming
  the internal viral coat that encapsulates the genomic RNA. HCV may be associated
  with lipoproteins such as very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), forming a lipoprotein
  complex called lipoviroparticle. Binding of lipoviroparticle to very-low density
  lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) results in virus endocytosis; after that, nucleocapsids
  are deposited into the cytoplasm. Then, nucleocapsids are uncoated, and the RNA
  is released. The genomic RNA is translated to the endoplasmic reticulum when HCV
  polyprotein is produced. The positive-stranded RNA genome is used as a template
  for synthesis of negative-stranded RNA; this new viral RNA is encapsulated within
  multiple copies of the core to form the nucleocapsid, and then, it acquires envelope
  and HCV virions, which are exported out of the cell in a Golgi-dependent manner.
  Naringenin inhibits the secretion and assembly of HCV through regulating lipid metabolism
  via 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR), and acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol
  acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibition. Cholesterol is synthetized in an HMGCR-dependent
  pathway; it is the rate limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis, and then, cholesterol
  is converted to cholesteryl esters (CEs) by ACAT. CEs are very important to VLDL
  assembly. In addition, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) catalyzes
  the transfer of lipids to the apolipoprotein (Apo) B-100 ApoB100; if the ApoB-MTP
  binding is inhibited, VLDL assembly in inhibited. Reduction in the bioavailability
  of CEs, triglycerides and cholesterol by naringenin reduces MTP activity and apoB-MTP
  binding. In addition, naringenin decreased intracellular triglycerides through peroxisome
  proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα), a regulator of lipid metabolism.
  Through these mechanisms, naringenin leads to a reduction in VLDL assembly and to
  the inhibition of ApoB-dependent HCV secretion. Additionally, naringenin inhibits
  viral NS5A protein, a multifunctional HCV nonstructural protein. Furthermore, naringenin
  could be an NS2 protease and core protein inhibitor.'
