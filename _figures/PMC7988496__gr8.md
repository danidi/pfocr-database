caption: Model for a new DG-signaling pathway involving SMSr and DGKδ. In the present
  study, we demonstrated that SMSr displayed PAP, PI-PLC, PE-PLC, PC-PLC, and PG-PLC
  activities that were stronger than the CPE synthase activity (). Moreover, the SMSr
  exhibited a substrate specificity for SFA- and/or MUFA-containing PA and PC molecular
  species, but not PUFA-containing PA and PC. It is possible that SMSr preferably
  hydrolyzes SFA- and/or MUFA-containing glycerophospholipids independent of the ceramide.
  Previously, we reported that SMSr and DGKδ functionally interact via their SAMDs
  (). Taken together, it is possible that there is a new mammalian DG-signaling pathway
  consisting of SMSr and DGKδ independent of the PI(4,5)P2cycle.
