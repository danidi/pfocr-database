caption: Effects of TSP1 and ligands in glucose metabolism and diabetes mellitus.
  TSP1 protects the pancreatic endothelium and controls angiogenesis by enhancing
  insulin production and release. TSP1 also blocks the formation of uncoupling protein
  2 (UCP2), a mitochondrial protein involved in oxidation and reactive oxygen species
  (ROS) metabolism. Under normal glycemic conditions, TSP1 inhibits glycolysis promoting
  the production of more ATP and pro-insulin. However, under hyperglycemic conditions
  and by activating TGFβ1, TSP1 accelerates the inflammation and fibrotic changes
  in multiple organs, especially in the kidney, leading to diabetic nephropathy and
  other diabetic complications. The TSP1 receptors CD36 and CD47 can inhibit the proliferation
  and migration of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, thereby contributing to endothelial
  dysfunction in diabetes. In this context, CD47 regulates SMC migration by binding
  mainly to TSP1 while limiting its association with SIRP1α. Activation of the hexosamine
  pathway and glycosylated products can induce further endothelial damage, with generation
  of ROS and delay of the wound-healing process in diabetes. Hyperglycemia will inhibit
  PKG and induce upstream stimulatory factor 2 (USF2), promoting the upregulation
  of TSP1 in diabetes. However, all these effects mediated by TSP1 in the glucose
  metabolism may be regulated by microRNAs.
