caption: PCOS–disease subnetwork 28. Shared proteins and shared pathway (mitophagy)
  between PCOS and hypertension were identified from this subnetwork. Different coloring
  of nodes and lines represents PCOS-related proteins (red), shared proteins (orange),
  PCOS–disease interactions (blue), and protein–pathway interactions (green). Circle
  nodes refer to PCOS-related proteins, triangle node refers to disease, and square
  node refers to pathway.
