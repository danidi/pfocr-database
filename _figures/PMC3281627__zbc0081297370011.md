caption: Proposed interactions among SHMT1 ubiquitination and SUMOylation. In this
  model, SUMO-1 is conjugated to SHMT1 by Ubc9 during S, G2/M phases, and in response
  to UV damage, which leads to nuclear import. The Ub E2 conjugase Ubc13 acts to stabilize
  SHMT1 within the nucleus (A) and signals nuclear export of SHMT1 through Lys-63-specific
  Ub linkage (B). Following nuclear export, SHMT1 is degraded via the proteasome in
  a Lys-48 Ub linkage-specific manner by unknown Ub pathway E2s and E3s in the cytoplasm.
  C, Ubc9 catalyzes the formation of SUMO-2/3 conjugates, which may be involved in
  nuclear SHMT1 degradation as SHMT1 accumulates in the nucleus when nuclear export
  is blocked and proteasomal degradation is inhibited. Ubiquitination of SHMT1 also
  increases in the nucleus following proteasome inhibition. Following SUMO-2/3 addition
  to SHMT1, ubiquitination may occur in mixed SUMO/Ub chains mediating SHMT1 degradation.
  Degradation of SHMT1 may occur in both nuclear and cytosolic compartments.
