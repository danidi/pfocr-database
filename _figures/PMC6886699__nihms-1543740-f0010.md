caption: '(A) Prior data from  suggest that VEGF administration (10 ng/mL) triggers
  the formation of activated VEGFR-2 homodimers that initiate three relevant signaling
  cascades. The first is Src-independent activation of MEK/ERK, which in turn mediates
  inhibitory phosphorylations of Cx43 proteins at S279/282. The second is Src-dependent
  activation of MEK/ERK in an unknown manner, possibly by direct interaction of Src
  with Raf-1 (), followed by ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43 S279/282. The third
  is direct Src-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43 Y265. Interestingly, pharmacological
  inhibition of either Src (PP2, 10 μM) or MEK (U0126, 10 μM) protects the Ca2+ burst
  response from VEGF-induced downregulation. Evidence provided by EGF treatment of
  P-UAEC-adEGFR shows that ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43 S279/282 is required
  for downregulation of the ATP-induced Ca2+ burst response, but Src-mediated phosphorylation
  of Cx43 Y265 is not (). These data suggest that PP2 inhibition of Src protects Ca2+
  bursting from the effects of VEGF specifically because it prevents Src activation
  of ERK1/2, thereby revealing pathway #2 (bold arrows) to be the critical mediator
  of acute VEGF-induced downregulation of GJC. (B) Although constitutive ligand-independent
  activity failed to induce significant elevations of basal ERK1/2 or inhibitory phosphorylations
  of Cx43, it appears to have a profound effect on the local environment at the plasma
  membrane, as evidenced by the fact that VEGF was not able to inhibit ATP-stimulated
  Ca2+ bursting in P-UAEC-adEGFR as it did in parental P-UAEC (). The overexpression
  of EGFR in P-UAEC localizes the receptor in membrane regions where it is normally
  absent, thereby conferring access to effector molecules that it might otherwise
  be denied. The constitutively autophosphorylated C-terminal tail of EGFR serves
  as a continuous source of active phosphotyrosine docking sites, thereby acting as
  a sink for effector molecules such as SOS, Grb2, the Ras-GTPase, Raf-1, Shc, Cbl
  and PLCγ. Despite the apparent negative feedback loop that resists the perpetual
  activation of MEK and ERK, upstream effector molecules are still likely to be “locked”
  in interaction with the C-terminus of EGFR for much of their time at the membrane,
  thus reducing their availability for other receptors. The loss of VEGF-mediated
  effects on Cx43 in P-UAEC-adEGFR suggests that EGFR may have a higher affinity for
  these effectors than VEGFR-2.'
