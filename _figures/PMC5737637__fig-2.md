caption: 'Biosynthesis of NAD(P)+ in mammalian cells. NAD+ is synthesized by three
  pathways: the de novo pathway, the Preiss–Handler pathway, and the salvage pathway.
  De novo NAD+synthesis from L-Trp is mediated by enzymes in the kynurenine pathway.
  IDO/TDO catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step by converting L-Trp to N-formylkynurenine.
  After four enzymatic reactions, the intermediate ACMS undergoes spontaneous cyclization
  to form QA, which is the second rate-limiting step. QA is then converted to NAMN
  by QPRT using PRPP as a cosubstrate. In the Preiss–Handler pathway, NA is first
  metabolized into NAMN by NAPRT. The de novo and Preiss–Handler pathways converge
  at NAMN, which is further metabolized into NAAD by three NMNATs at the expense of
  ATP. NAD+ is synthesized from NAAD under the catalysis of NADSYNs. NAM and NR serve
  as NAD+ precursors for the salvage pathway, in which NAM and NR are initially converted
  into a common product, NMN, by NAMPT or NRK, respectively. Following that conversion,
  NMN is metabolized to NAD+ by the same NMNAT enzymes used by the other two pathways.
  Once formed, NAD+ can be phosphorylated into NADP+ by NADK. ACMS, 2-amino-3-carboxy-muconate-semialdehyde;
