caption: Analyzing Toll-like receptor signaling pathway by QIAGEN, KEGG and wikipathway
  websites and drawing pathway by Pathvisio software. The pathway involves up or down-regulating
  genes induced by pathogenic (a) and non-pathogenic (b) E. coli OMV, indicating red
  for the up-regulating genes and blue for the down-regulating genes
