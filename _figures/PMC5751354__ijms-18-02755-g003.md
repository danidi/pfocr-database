caption: 'Glutamine metabolism: The influence of anaplerosis (entry of glutamine into
  the TCA cycle), cataplerosis (removal of glutamine as malate) and glyceroneogenesis
  (marked red). Mechanisms by which glutamine is metabolized for energy involve entry
  of glutamine into the TCA cycle (anaplerosis), balanced by its removal (cataplerosis)
  as malate. Malate can be subsequently converted to oxaloacetate (OAA) and then to
  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) via the cytosolic enzyme phosphenolpyruvate carboxylase
  (PEPCK). PEP can be converted to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase for entry into the
  TCA cycle as acetyl-CoA or transamination to alanine. The pathway of glyceroneogenesis
  in which carbon from sources other than glucose or glycerol contributes to the formation
  of l-glycerol-3-phosphate (3-Glycerol-P) for conversion to triglycerides, involves
  a balance of anaplerosis (entry of OAA synthesized from pyruvate via pyruvate carboxylase)
  and cataplerosis (removal of intermediates to support the synthesis of glyceride-glycerol).
  Reduction of glycolysis-derived dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to 3-Glycerol-P
  provides cells with the activated glycerol backbone needed to synthesize new triglycerides
  with fatty acids (FA). Solid arrows, anaplerosis pathways; red arrows, glyceroneogenesis
  pathway; dotted arrow, mitochondrial cataplerosis pathway.'
