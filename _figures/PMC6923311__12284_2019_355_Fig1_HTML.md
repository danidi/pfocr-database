caption: 'DSB repair pathways.1017In the C-NHEJ pathway, DSB formation induces binding
  to broken ends by KU70/80 heterodimers that subsequently recruit the DNA damage
  response kinase (DDK) complex such as DNA-PKcs in mammals. DDK then activates the
  53BP1/RIF1 complex, which plays a role in shielding the broken ends from resection
  by antagonizing BRCA1/CtIP activity. DNA-PK also activates other KU-recruited proteins,
  such as XLF, XRCC4 and Lig4, for ligating the broken ends. In the HDR pathway, DSB
  formation induces cell cycle arrest initiated with the activation of ATM resulting
  from sensing a chromatin structure change. Activated monomeric ATM then phosphorylates
  the MRN complex and P53/SOG1, which regulates the cell cycle checkpoint and arrest.
  MRN activation supports end resection for HDR. Limited resection leads to MMEJ,
  and if a substantial level of resection is formed in the absence of a donor template,
  SSA is likely to be used for the repair. MMEJ requires PARP and Pol Q for its processes,
  and SSA requires the role of RAD52. Both MMEJ and SSA require the ssDNA flap endonuclease
  FEN1 and Lig3/Lig1:XRCC1 for ligating final products. Extensive resection of the
  broken ends is facilitated by Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) and/or Dna2. In the presence
  of donor template, the 3′ overhangs of resected ends could be protected by RPA binding
  and then recruiting RAD51 to the ssDNA with support and control by BRCA2. RAD51
  binds to the resected ssDNA overhang, forming nucleoprotein filaments or presynaptic
  filaments. With the support of RAD54, the filament structure invades the donor template
  sequence and searches for and anneals to the complementary sequence; then, displacement
  loop (D-loop) formation occurs. Subsequently, the free 3′ OH end of the invaded
  ssDNA primes donor template-dependent DNA synthesis. This process determines the
  outcomes of HDR with several sub-pathways (DSBR with dHJ and SDSA) with the supportive
  activity of RAD5A, RECQ4A and MUS81. The DNA fragments and protein structures are
  not pictured to scale. The potential proteins involved in the processes of each
  pathway or sub-pathway are denoted adjacent to their approaching lines. XRCC: X-ray
