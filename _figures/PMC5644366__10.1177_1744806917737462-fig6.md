caption: 'Schematic diagram depicts the GluN2B-contaning NMDA receptor/ERK1/2 signaling
  pathway underlying the preventive analgesic effect of pre-emptive intravenous propofol
  on formalin-induced inflammatory pain. Formalin injection results in the upregulation
  of phosphorylated GluN2B-contaning NMDA receptor, which subsequently induces an
  increase in calcium influx and activates ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signal transduction
  pathways. Pre-emptive intravenous propofol inhibits the formalin-induced activation
  of spinal GluN2B that, through decreasing calcium influx, blocks ERK1/2 activation,
  and thereby reduces pain hypersensitivity following nociceptive stimulation. P:
  phosphorylation; Glu: glutamate.'
