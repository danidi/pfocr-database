caption: Interplay of oxidative stress and tuberculosis. Infection with drug-susceptible
  or MDR-TB can lead to active clinical disease in humans prompting diagnosis and
  the prescription of first- or second-line drugs, respectively. TB disease also leads
  to increased oxidative burden (ROS, RNI) in the lung that aids in the activation
  of TB prodrugs. Supplements such as vitamin C may augment the treatment of TB by
  inhibiting the emergence of “persisters” through mechanisms including downregulation
  of mycobacterial siderophore biosynthesis. Unsuccessful treatment can lead to subsequent
  TB relapse. Mycobacterium tuberculosis can also remain dormant in the host during
  a latent TB infection. Administration of supplements (cysteine, vitamin C, and AC2P36)
  may provide a pathway for inhibiting the reactivation of latent TB potentially by
  increasing the intramycobacterial OS and alteration in “lipid/thiol” biosynthesis.
