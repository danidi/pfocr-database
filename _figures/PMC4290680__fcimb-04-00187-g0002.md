caption: 'Schematic representation of ManLAM and PIM action on phagosome maturation
  and autophagy. Right part: After phagocytosis, mycobacteria reside in a vacuole,
  called phagosome. Phagosome maturation consists in a series of fusion events with
  exocytic and endocytic pathways. One key step is the delivery of Cathepsin D and
  H+-ATPase subunit Vo from Trans-Golgi-Network (TGN) to the phagosome. This step
  is mediated by tethering protein EEA1 which is recruited to the phagosome by small
  GTPase Rab5 and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). ManLAM blocks phagosome
  maturation through inhibition of Ca2+/CaM/CaMKII signaling pathway involved in PI3P
  production by type III PI3Kinase hVPS34. ManLAM can also block phagosome maturation
  by engaging mannose receptor and disrupting membrane microdomains, rafts, however,
  the link with Ca2+/CaM signaling has not been studied. PIMs, ManLAM precursor, impair
  phagosome maturation by stimulating fusion between phagosome and early endosomes.
  Mycobacterium tuberculosis recruits Rab14 to phagosome to promote early endosome
  fusion thus impairs phagosome maturation. It remains to be established whether PIMs
  promotes early endosome fusion through Rab14 recruitment. Left part: Mammalian target
  of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, activated by Ser/Thr kinase Akt and inhibited by AMP-activated
  Protein Kinase (AMPK), is a master repressor of autophagy. Beclin-1, an autophagy-related
  protein in complex with hVPS34, is essential for autophagy. Beclin-1/hVPS34 complex
  is activated by AMPK and repressed by Bcl-2. ULK1, another important autophagy-related
  protein, is activated by AMPK and inhibited by mTOR. Ca2+ influx has been shown
  to activate AMPK, hVPS34, and represses Bcl-2 expression. IFNγ induces autophagy.
  Based on known effects of ManLAM on Ca2+ influx, Bcl-2, Akt and IFNγ signaling,
  we postulate that ManLAM might inhibit autophagy by targeting Beclin-1/hVPS34 complex,
  Akt/mTOR or IFNγ pathways. The relationship between effects of ManLAM on these different
  signaling pathways and autophagy awaits investigation. Arrows and characters are
  represented in gray to indicate that the molecular mechanisms of LAM action on autophagy
  are hypothetical.'
