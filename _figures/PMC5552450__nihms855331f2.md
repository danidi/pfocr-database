caption: The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2), which is preferentially expressed
  by cancer cells, has been hypothesized to promote an alternative catalytic activity
  that does not produce ATP, in contrast to PKM1. This potential mechanism would likely
  contribute to continual activation of phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is inhibited
  by ATP. Consequently, glycolytic flux may be enhanced. This alternative mechanism
  involves transfer of the phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to phosphoglycerate
  mutase 1 (PGAM1), which activates it. This positive feedback mechanism may drive
  the enhanced production of 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG), PEP and eventually enhance
  the overall PGAM1 activity. Through this mechanism, the generation of pyruvate may
  become partially decoupled from ATP production, which could enable a high rate of
  glycolysis. Activation and inhibition of enzyme activity are denoted by arrows and
  blunt arrows, respectively. The relative strengths of metabolic pathways and activation/inhibition
  effects are shown by the thickness of the arrows.
