caption: Significance of selenium in cancer stem cell metabolism. CSCs generally display
  glycolytic metabolic phenotype selectively coupled with TCA cycle and OXPHOS to
  generate energy and cellular components (amino acids and lipids) to support their
  stemness. Metabolically-active CSCs generate ROS, which is compensated by production
  of antioxidants, including GSH, NADPH derived from the pentose phosphate pathway.
  Selenoproteins through their redox gatekeeper functions can effectively modulate
  redox homeostasis. Selenium treatment of CSCs activate ATM kinase, which in turn
  activates p53 leading to metabolic reprogramming. p53 targets pathways via TIGAR-mediated
  glycolytic arrest, Sco2-mediated potentiation of OXPHOS, and Gls2-mediated regulation
  of glutamine metabolism to ultimately exacerbate ROS production to activate pathways
  of apoptosis. Selenium-mediated eicosanoid class switching leads to the production
  of PGJ2 as an adaptive response for protection against ROS, which is mediated through
  PPARγ that transcriptionally represses STAT5a to effectively inhibit downstream
  target genes, HIF2α and CITED2, known for maintenance of CSC quiescence, as in CML
  LSCs.
