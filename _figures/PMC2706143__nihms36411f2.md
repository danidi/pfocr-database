caption: Three proximal sensors IRE1, PERK and ATF6 regulate the UPR through their
  respective signaling cascades. Under non-stressed conditions, BiP binds to the lumenal
  domains of IRE1 and PERK to prevent their dimerization. Upon accumulation of unfolded
  proteins in the ER lumen, IRE1 released from BIP dimerizes to activate its kinase
  and RNase activities to initiate XBP1 mRNA splicing thereby creating a potent transcriptional
  activator. Primary targets that require IRE1/XBP1 pathway for induction include
  genes encoding functions in ERAD. Similarly, ATF6 released from BiP transits to
  the Golgi compartment where for cleavage by S1P and S2P proteases to yield a cytosolic
  fragment that migrates to the nucleus to further activate transcription of UPR-responsive
  genes. Finally, PERK released from BiP dimerizes, autophosphorylates, and phosphorylates
  eIF2α on Ser 51 leading to general attenuation of translational initiation. Paradoxically,
  eIF2α phosphorylation induces translation of ATF4 mRNA. The PERK/eIF2α/ATF4 regulatory
  axis also induces expression of anti-oxidative stress response genes and expression
  of genes encoding proteins with proapoptotic functions, such as CHOP.
