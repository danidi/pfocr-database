caption: The major nuclei of the basal ganglia are shown and the localization of various
  mGluR subtypes that are relevant to PD therapeutics is highlighted. Excitatory projections
  are represented as white arrows and inhibitory projections are represented as black
  arrows. Overall, the effect of group I mGluR activation (green and purple circles)
  is to counteract the effects of dopamine, particularly by increasing activity through
  the indirect pathway. Group II mGluRs (yellow circles) reduce glutamate release
  at several key synapses including the corticostriatal, STN-SNc, and STN-SNr synapses.
  Group III mGluRs (orange circles), including mGluRs 4, 7 and 8, are expressed at
  striatopallidal (predominantly mGluR4; activation of this receptor inhibits GABAergic
  transmission in the GPe) and the STN-SNr synapses. (GPe, external segment of globus
  pallidus; STN, subthalamic nucleus; GPi, internal segment of globus pallidus; SNr,
  substantia nigra pars reticulata; SNc, substantia nigra pars compacta. Adapted from
  Conn et al., 2005 and Wichmann & DeLong, 1996.)
