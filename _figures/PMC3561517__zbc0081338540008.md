caption: Overview of the recruitment and modification of PCNA and Pol δ by RNF8 involving
  different DNA damage pathways. A, RNF8 involvement in the ubiquitination of PCNA.
  The left panel shows the basic scheme of the activation of TLS in response to UV
  damage in S phase cells where CPDs block replication fork progression. The current
  well established scheme in which Rad6-Rad18 triggers monoubiquitination of PCNA
  to initiate TLS by recruitment of Pol η is shown (, ). The right panel indicates
  the response to IR, which triggers the DDR, where RNF8 plays a key role in the assembly
  of the complex of DDR proteins (–, ). Shown here is the finding that RNF8 also ubiquitinates
  PCNA (). DSBs, double strand breaks. B, a proposed role for RNF8 in integrating
  the formation of Pol δ3 with PCNA ubiquitination. This diagram shows that RNF8 could
  act to generate Pol δ3 and ub-PCNA in response to UV to act in TLS as well as in
  NER and in response to IR to act in HR. The light blue arrows show the pathway for
  ubiquitination of PCNA, and the pink arrows show the generation of Pol δ3 via the
  degradation of p12. Implicit in this pathway is that the formation of monoubiquitination
  of PCNA leads to the recruitment of TLS polymerases.
