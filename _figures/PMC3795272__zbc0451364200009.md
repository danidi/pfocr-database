caption: Model for the action of PML on metabolism. A, a model by which PML NBs modulate
  energy homeostasis. PML is primarily enriched in PML NBs, where transcription factors
  (TF) or cofactors reside. In response to extracellular stimuli such as nutritional
  stress, changes in the composition of PML NBs alter the activities of the transcription
  factors, such as PPARs (, ), NF-κB (), FOXO1 (), and possibly SREBP1, which in turn
  regulate the expression of genes involved in metabolism or inflammatory responses.
  PML cross-talks with the AMPK pathway and modulates mitochondrial function through
  mechanisms yet to be elucidated. Possibly, other unidentified mechanisms also exist.
  Notably, the modulation of metabolism by PML NBs is probably tissue-specific. B,
  specific metabolic alterations that are induced by the deletion of the gene for
  PML. PML ablation in mice results in an elevated activity of AMPK in the liver and
  skeletal muscle. The AMPK pathway is activated after increased energy expenditure
  (or energy deficiency) such as starvation or exercise. AMPK activation leads to
  increased fatty acid oxidation, which is observed in PML KO mice, indicated by a
  decreased RER when feeding a normal chow diet ad libitum. Presumably, the altered
  pattern of gene expression in key metabolic tissues of PML KO mice predisposes them
  to increased fatty acid oxidation, which protects the mice from obesity induced
  by feeding a Western diet.
