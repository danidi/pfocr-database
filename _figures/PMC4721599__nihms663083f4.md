caption: Network of genes located within high-level copy number changes and deregulated
  across all of the cell lines and tumors. Ingenuity pathway analysis was used to
  assess the potential interconnection between genes representing the most significantly
  affected cellular functions. Red, increased expression; green, decreased expression.
