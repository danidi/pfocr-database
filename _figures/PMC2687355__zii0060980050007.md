caption: The signaling pathway MyD88 ⇒ p38 ⇒ EGR-1/AP-1 is essential for GBS-induced
  transcriptional activation of TNF. In response to GBS, MyD88 serves as a master
  signaling molecule, which essentially mediates p38 phosphorylation. In turn, p38
  activates Egr-1 and AP-1, critical transcription factors for TNF. Similarly, Elk-1
  is activated by p38; however, it is not required for TNF formation.
