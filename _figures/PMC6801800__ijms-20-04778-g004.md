number: Figure 4
caption: Chemerin has immune-mediated tumor-suppressive effects in hepatocellular
  carcinoma. Systemic or hepatocyte-secreted chemerin interacts with chemerin1 and
  CCLR2 on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and endothelial cells to inhibit nuclear
  factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. By unknown mechanisms, this leads to reduced secretion
  of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) from tumor cells and
  IL-6 from hepatocytes. In turn, this leads to reduced tumor infiltration of immunosuppressive
  and pro-angiogenic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and increased infiltration
  of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. It is unknown (?) how and if CCRL2-bound chemerin interacts
  with chemerin1. (−) = Reduction or suppression of a normal pathway and (+) Increase
  of a normal pathway.
