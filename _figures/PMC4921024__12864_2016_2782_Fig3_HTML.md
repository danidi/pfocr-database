caption: 'Distribution, variety, and frequency of fusion events in thiamin biosynthesis.
  The fusion architectures involving these genes as well as their identification data
  are given in (Additional file : Tables S3 A and B). The thiamin biosynthesis pathway
  enzymes, reactions, intermediates and fusion architectures are illustrated in this
  diagram following the same representation rules as in Fig. . The variety of fusions
  of each thiamin biosynthesis gene is shown on the top left insert. This variety
  is represented by a color range where the number of binary fusion events in which
  each gene participates (see Additional file : Table S3B), is proportional to the
  orange color intensity on the diagram (see left panel under compounds abbreviations
  section). The frequency of fusions of each thiamin biosynthesis gene is displayed
  on the top right insert. This frequency is expressed as a percentage and calculated
  as described in Methods. It is represented by a color range where the ratio for
  each thiamin gene mentioned above is proportional to the blue color intensity (see
  right panel under compounds abbreviations section)'
