caption: '(Top panel): Illustration of the lens and its conjunction ocular tissues.
  The ciliary body with its vascular circulation system continuously produces the
  aqueous humor that contains both the constituent amino acids for GSH synthesis and
  GSH/GSSG. It first enters the posterior chamber, then reaches to the anterior aqueous
  humor and then drains out via trabecular meshwork and Shclemm’s canal. Both ciliary
  body and retina also produce molecular solute into the vitreous humor to maintain
  vitreous humor in a more dynamic, and this may also include GSH and GSSG. The lens
  will then utilize the amino acids, GSH or GSSG supply to maintain its GSH homeostasis
  via de novo synthesis and uptake, respectively. The pathway with a question marker
  indicates that it is currently unknown.(Lower left panel): The illustration of lens
  structure. The anterior of the lens is assembled with monolayer of epithelial cells,
  and their continuously proliferation and differentiation produce lens fiber cells
  to form outer and inner cortical fiber layer. The lens nucleus is assembled with
  the embryonic nucleus and the fetal nucleus. The lens epithelial cells and outer
  cortical fiber cells have the ability to synthesis GSH, while lens nuclear GSH is
  completely reliant on transport from outer cortex. The outer cortex has been found
  possess high concentration of GSH than lens nucleus, though whether this is also
  true in posterior outer cortex is still unclear.(Lower right panel): Illustration
  of lens epithelial and outer fiber layer. The epithelial cells are responsible for
  transporting the constituent amino acids from aqueous humor for GSH synthesis, which
  is taking place in both epithelial and outer fiber cell layer. The lens epithelial
  cells may also take up GSH or GSSG from aqueous humor. The high GSH concentration
  gradient between lens and aqueous humor implicates it might be a carried based transporting
  mechanisms, though the identity of the transporter is still unknown. The lens fiber
  cells are enriched with gap junctions, and it has been suggested that gap junction
  might playing a role in lens nuclear GSH homeostasis.'
