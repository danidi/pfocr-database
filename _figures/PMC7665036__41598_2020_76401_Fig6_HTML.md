caption: 'Highly dysregulated kynurenic acid pathway metabolites post-CA reveals similar
  dysfunction in humans and rats. Plasma kynurenic acid pathway metabolite alterations
  in human (top) and rat (bottom) plasma after CA. The colors of each metabolite correspond
  to the variation of that metabolite after resuscitation as compared to control:
  red indicates increased levels, while green indicates decreased levels. Both human
  and rat plasma show a substantial increase in most kynurenic acid pathway metabolites
  and a substantial decrease in tryptophan levels. CON control, CA post-CA and resuscitation,
  y-axis peak area. Data are displayed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses for each
  metabolite were performed using Mann–Whitney U test; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
  and ****P < 0.0001.'
