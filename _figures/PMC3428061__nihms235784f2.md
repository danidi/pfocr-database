caption: 'Interface between hemostasis and adaptive immunity. Thrombin activation
  of PARs and pro-osteopontin (proOpn), in concert with platelet-derived CD154, serotonin
  (5-HT), platelet factor 4 (PF4), and RANTES, have now been discovered to optimize
  the process of antigen presentation to initiate and steer the phenotype of subsequent
  adaptive immune responses. Platelets express CD154 which can be secreted by TLR4
  induction or remotely delivered by platelet-derived microvesicles (PDMV) to augment
  both dendritic and B cell activation. In a similar capacity, 5-HT can activate T
  cells and induce autocrine production of 5-HT to amplify this process. PF4 directly
  interacts with CXCR3 to increase T cell recruitment, or forms dimers with RANTES
  that recruits monocytes and T cells. Activation of PAR1 on dendritic cells (DC)
  enhanced the production of proinflammatory and prothrombotic mediators, a potential
  feedback system to amplify antigen presentation. A critical signaling pathway downstream
  of PAR engagement is activation of sphingosine kinase (SphK) to generate sphingosine-1
  phosphate (S1P) that act on S1P receptors (S1PR). Extravasation of inflammatory
  cells through the endothelium is enhanced by thrombin (Th) activation of the S1PR3
  pathway, while activated protein C (aPC) maintains the endothelial barrier through
  S1PR1. Differential engagement of PAR heterodimers by aPC and Th is also responsible
  for this divergent effect. Engagement of S1PR1 steers T helper cells away from Th1
  phenotype towards a Th2-type response. aPC attenuates Th17 responses and downregulate
  T cell activation. Osteopontin (Opn) has been implicated in prolonging T cell survival
  and driving a Th17 response. Chemerin depends on precise protease processing to
  either enhance or attenuate inflammation through the same receptor ChemR23. Activated
  thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) deactivates Opn and inhibits
  chemerin cleavage by plasmin that yields a proinflammatory ligand for ChemR23. Substantial
  crosstalk between the hemostatic and adaptive immune compartments is therefore an
  indispensible component in the onset of effective host defense as well as immune
  dysfunction. Abbreviations: MCP-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1; sCD154, soluble
  CD154; TF, tissue factor.'
