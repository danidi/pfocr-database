caption: Uses of CRY2 domains. For all panels, CRY2 and CIB1 are the full-length domains.
  PHR is the photolyase homology region of CRY2 (a truncated CRY2) and CIBN is the
  N terminal portion of CIB1 (a truncated CIB1). (A) Light-sensitive receptor tyrosine
  kinases. Upon excitation with blue light, PHR homodimerizes to activate downstream
  components in the Trk signaling pathway. (B) Heterodimerization between PHR and
  CIBN used to produce light-activated Raf1 for optogenetic control of the Raf1/MEK/ERK
  pathway in PC12 cells. Membrane localization of Raf1 activated downstream kinases
  and eventually stimulated neurite growth in PC12 cells. (C) Light-activated phosphatidylinositol
  3-kinase (PI3K). CIBN is membrane-localized and PHR is fused to the inter-SH2 domain
  of p85b, the regulatory subunit of PI3K kinase (iSH). The catalytic p110 component
  of PI3K was supplied endogenously by the cell expressing these two constructs. Blue
  light excitation recruited the PHR-iSH-p110 complex to the membrane, where it would
  produce PIP3 from PIP2. (D) Light-induced heterodimerization between CRY2 and CIBN
  can assemble a functional protein if an appropriate half of the protein is fused
  to each of CRY2 and CIBN. Fusing half of cre recombinase to CRY2 and CIBN produces
  light-dependent loxP site recombination. (E) The light-inducible transcriptional
  effector (LITE) system allows optical control of transcription or chromatin structure.
  Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) serve as modular DNA-binding domains.
  TALE fused to PHR comprises one component of LITE. An effector domain (TAD or HED,
  a histone effector domain) fused to CIB1 comprises the other component of LITE.
