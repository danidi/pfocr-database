caption: 'Mevalonate pathway as an important metabolic pathway: The mevalonate pathway
  is regulated by HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR), and this enzyme is targeted by statins
  to decrease plasma cholesterol. Fibrates target the mevalonate pathway by inhibiting
  acetoacetyl coenzyme A. This reverses the effects of cholesterol to inhibit cell
  proliferation and trigger apoptotic parameters. Downregulating the pathway also
  suppresses production of farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl phosphate to
  inhibit the invasive properties of cancer cells. T-bars in red denote inhibition.'
