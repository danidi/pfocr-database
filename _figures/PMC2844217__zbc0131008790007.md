caption: Biosynthetic pathway of ipecac alkaloids having an S-configuration that derive
  from N-deacetylisoipecoside. The biosynthetic reactions identified in this study
  (IpeOMTs) and IpeGlu1 () are shown. Bold arrows indicate emetine biosynthetic pathway.
  The detailed pathway leading to protoemetine from the aglycon formed by IpeGlu1
  has not yet been elucidated (shown by dashed line). Reactions not catalyzed by the
  IpeOMT enzymes are shown by ×.
