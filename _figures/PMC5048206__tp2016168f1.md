caption: Schematic representation of the major proinflammatory glial-mediated alterations
  to excitatory synapses within the spinal dorsal horn that contribute to central
  sensitization. Strong or long-term noxious activation of astrocytes and microglia
  within the spinal dorsal horn can lead to the aberrant synthesis and release of
  proinflammatory mediators, such as TNFα and IL-1β. The overarching effect of these
  neurokine signals in excitatory synapses contributes to central sensitization and
  facilitates the transmission of nociceptive signals to the brain. Some of the major
  known adaptations include the following. (1) Increased release of the excitatory
  neurotransmitter, glutamate, from presynaptic nerve terminals. (2) Suppression of
  astrocytic glutamate reuptake via downregulation of GLT-1 and GLAST activity. (3)
  Release of the glutamate from astrocytes, which is capable of increasing the excitability
  of nearby neurons. (4) d-serine, also released from astrocytes, enhances Ca2+ influx
  via binding to glycine sites on NMDA receptors on postsynaptic neurons. (5) Astrocytic
  release of ATP also increases postsynaptic excitability via activation of ligand-gated
  purinergic receptors, P2X4R and P2X7R. (6) TNFα and IL-1β increase translocation
  of NMDA receptors to the postsynaptic membrane and increases their conductance via
  an ERK-dependent pathway. (7) IL-1β, TNFα, IFNγ and CCL2 increase NMDA receptor-mediated
  excitatory signaling; in the case of IL-1β, this is thought to involve the phosphorylation
  of receptor subunits including NR1, 2a and 2b. (8) Proinflammatory cytokines have
  been linked to increased expression and activation of AMPA receptors at excitatory
  synapses. (9) Reactive microglia have increased expression of receptors for various
  neurotransmitters and chemokines (for example, AMPARs, NK1Rs and CX3CR1), which
  can induce the further release of proinflammatory cytokines upon stimulation, thereby
  perpetuating neuronal excitation. ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; IFN,
  interferon; IL, interleukin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α.
