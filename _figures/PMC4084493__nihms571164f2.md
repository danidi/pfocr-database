caption: Adapted from [] with permission. IR induces base damage and SSBs. Two SSBs
  on opposite strands of the DNA induce a DSB. Damaged, non-ligatable termini are
  represented by the small red circles. The DSB can be detected by the Ku heterodimer,
  initiating NHEJ, the major pathway for the repair of IR-induced DSBs, which is active
  in all stages of the cell cycle. In the absence of classical NHEJ, an alternative
  or back-up NHEJ pathway, that involves PARP1, XRCC1 and DNA ligases I or III may
  be initiated []. DSBs are detected by the Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1 (MRN) complex which
  leads to activation of the ATM protein kinase and downstream signaling events that
  induce cell cycle checkpoint arrest and other cellular responses to DSBs []. The
  MRN complex is required for 5′-3′ resection, likely involving Mre11, CtIP, Exo1,
  Dna2 and other proteins, which produces long 3′ ends that are recognized by ssDNA-binding
  protein, RPA. The 53BP1/RIF complex promotes NHEJ by blocking DSB ends from resection
  [-], but the mechanism by which it does so is poorly understood. RPA is displaced
  by BRCA2, allowing binding of Rad51 and initiation of homologous recombination repair
  (HRR), which is active only in late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle [, ]. Recruitment
  of RPA also initiates activation of ATR, which like ATM, contributes to activation
  of cell cycle checkpoints and other cellular responses []. Precisely how Ku and
  MRN compete or cooperate to initiate NHEJ, HRR and activation of ATM is an area
  of active investigation. See text for details.
