caption: The possible cell signaling pathways induced by acute exposure to 4 h of
  CTSS in human corneal epithelial cells contributing to increased release of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines and MMP-9 that may contribute to ocular surface inflammation. (A) The
  effects of acute CTSS on increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and MMP-9 mediated
  by PAR-2; (B) Acute CTSS induces IL-8 through a PAR-2- independent pathway. A one-way
  black solid arrow () represents a proposed inducible pathway, an one-way black dashed
  arrow () represents a possible one-way inducible pathway, a two-way red dashed arrow
  () represents a possible two-way inducible pathway and a solid line with blunt end
  () represents a negative feedback pathway.
