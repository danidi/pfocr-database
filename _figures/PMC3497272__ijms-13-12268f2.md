caption: Mechanisms of ErbB signaling and inhibition in tumour cell. Oncogenic signaling
  incancer cells can be mediated by overexpressed ErbB2, ErbB2 homodimers or ErbB2/ErbB3
  heterodimers, and also by ErbB1 homodimers or ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers. These events
  trigger signaling through a complex array of intracellular pathways that initiate
  and control a range of cellular processes. Out of many signaling event in a network,
  three key signaling pathways are the Ras-Erk (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)),
  the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–AKT and the Janus Kinase (JAK-STAT) pathway.
  The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cetuximab, panitumumab, trastuzumab and pertuzumab
  act extracellulary by blocking ligand binding and/or receptor dimerization. The
  small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) gefitinib, erlotinib and lapatinib
  compete with ATP in the tyrosine-kinase domain of the receptor and block tyrosine
  kinase activity. Both interrupt downstream signaling. In addition to inhibiting
  ErbB signaling, mAbs might also mediate anti-tumour effects through antibody-dependent
  cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Inhibition of ErbB2 by trastuzumab impairs all
  downstream events, in particular reversing BCL2-antagonist of cell death (BAD) inhibition,
  leading to a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL expression. This leads to a destabilization
  of the mitochrondrial membrane and ATP depletion, cytochroom c release and caspase
  activation. Only signaling through these three pathways and known subcellular processes
  are shown here for simplicity.

  description: Mechanisms of ErbB signaling and inhibition in tumour cell. Oncogenic
    signaling incancer cells can be mediated by overexpressed ErbB2, ErbB2 homodimers

    These events trigger signaling through a complex array of intracellular pathways
    that initiate and control a range of cellular processes. Out of many signaling
