caption: Toll-like receptors, adapter proteins, and signaling molecules. With the
  exception of TLR3, all TLRs recruit the adapter protein, myeloid differentiation
  primary response gene 88 (MyD88). In addition, TLRs 1, 2, 4, and 6 recruit the adapters
  cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14, not shown), which is required for lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) binding, and Toll-Interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein
  (TIRAP), which links the conserved C-terminal intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor
  (TIR) domain with MyD88. In the MyD88-dependent pathway, the MyD88 recruits interleukin
  1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), which interacts with the adapter protein tumor
  necrosis factor-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and provides a link to nuclear
  factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) translocation. The
  MyD88-dependent pathway also facilitates expression of mitogen-activated protein
  kinase (MAPK) and transcription factors, such as interferon regulatory factors (IRFs),
  driving the production of proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines and chemokines.
  Activation of TLR3 initiates the TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β
  (TRIF)-dependent pathway, whereas TLR4 can signal via either MyD88-dependent or
  TRIF-dependent pathways requiring the additional linker adaptor TRIF-related adaptor
  molecule (TRAM) to associate with TRIF. In the TRIF-dependent pathway, TRIF interacts
  with TRAF3 to activate IRF3 initiating IFN-β production, which is the hallmark of
  the host innate response to viral infection.
