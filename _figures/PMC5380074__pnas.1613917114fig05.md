caption: Model of wound-induced gene expression signaling in Drosophila epidermal
  cells. Based on our results and past studies, we propose that epidermal injury leads
  to influx of extracellular calcium ions into cells neighboring a wound, activating
  the dual oxidase enzyme (Duox), which produces a burst of extracellular hydrogen
  peroxide (). In some manner this leads to the activation of a protease or proteases
  that cleave and activate the Sp채tzle ligand (, ). The Sp채tzle/Toll signaling complex
  transmits a signal through the adaptors MyD88 and Tube that results in activation
  of wound gene transcription that is dependent on the Dif transcription factor. The
  loss of Toll pathway components does not result in a complete loss of wound gene
  transcription, because there is at least one other signaling pathway acting in parallel
  that also has a combinatorial role in helping to activate wound gene transcription.
  One such pathway involves the Stitcher receptor tyrosine kinase, the downstream
  effectors Src42A, DRK, and ERK, and the transcription factor Grainy head (GRH) (,
  , , , ).
