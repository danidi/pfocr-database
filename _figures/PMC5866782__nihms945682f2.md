caption: In human HCT116 and SW480 CRC cells (left), agonism of FFA4 modulates proliferation
  and cell migration. Agonism of FFA4 activates the PI3K mediated phosphorylation
  of AKT, which facilitates phosphorylation of IκBα to activate NF-κB. Activation
  of NF-κB upregulates expression of proangiogenic VEGF, IL-8, and COX-2. In these
  cells, agonism of FFA4 also increases epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as
  evidenced by alterations to EMT markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin. FFA4-induced
  EMT facilitates cell migration. In these cells, the signal transducer between FFA4
  and PI3K remains elusive, as are the intracellular mechanisms of FFA4-mediated EMT
  and cell migration. On the contrary, in human LOVO and SW480 CRC cells (right),
  agonism of FFA4 and FFA1 regulates LATS1 mediated phosphorylation of YAP, restricting
  it to the cytosol and preventing YAP-induced activation of proliferative and survival
  pathways. Cytosol restricted YAP inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis. This
  pathway is blocked by the PKA inhibitor H-89 suggesting a role for canonical PKA/MST1/2-HIPPO
  signaling.
