caption: Proposed model for a role of BANK1 in tolerant patients. In B cells of TOL
  (left panel), BCR stimulation triggers the phosphorylation of adaptor molecule SYK
  which, then activated, phosphorylates BANK1. BANK1 binds B lymphoid kinase (BLK).
  This complex interacts with phosphorylated PLCγ2. This new complex is recruited
  by membrane PIP3s which are cleaved in DAG and IP3. IP3s fixe to IP3 Receptors and
  trigger intracellular Ca2+ release leading to a proapoptotic action. This apoptotic
  pathway, increased in TOL, could be involved in regulation of homeostasis of these
  cells and participated to tolerance phenomenon in regulating the survival of potential
  detrimental cells for the graft. In Bregs from HV (right panel), the BANK1/BLK/PLCγ2
  complex is reduced, the intracellular Ca2+ is thus not released, this apoptotic
  pathway is not privileged, but the apoptosis is still increased in the cells. Other
  apoptotic pathways take over like TNFR/Fas pathways or the intrinsic pathway. This
  switch of apoptotic pathways in the Bregs may be a feature of differentiated cells,
  but could also play a role in the suppressive/regulation activity of Bregs.
