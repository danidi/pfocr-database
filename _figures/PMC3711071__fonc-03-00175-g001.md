caption: Function and regulation of AMPK leading to tumor suppression. AMPK is activated
  when AMP/ATP or ADP/ATP ratios in the cells rise due to various physiological stresses,
  such as hypoglycemia and hypoxemia, leading to the activation of LKB1. Metformin
  and phenformin can also mimic these stressors and lead to AMPK activation in a LKB1-dependent
  manner. CaMKKβ activates AMPK in response to calcium increase. Catabolic pathways,
  such as fatty acid oxidation, are activated by AMPK. For example, AMPK phosphorylation
  leads to the inactivation of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC2). On the other hand, AMPK
  inhibits anabolic pathways, such as fatty acid synthesis, mediated by ACC1. One
  of the most well-known pathways of AMPK is through the TSC1/TSC2 complex, leading
  to the downregulation of mTOR, which can also can be activated downstream of the
  PI3K-AKT and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathways. The mTOR pathway suppresses apoptosis
  via its effect on the tumor suppressors p53 and p27 and inhibits autophagy by suppressing
  UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and ULK2. AMPK downregulates these effects of mTOR,
  thus leading to increased apoptosis and autophagy-mediated cell death. Independent
  of mTOR, AMPK phosphorylates and activates ULK1 and ULK2, thus triggering autophagy.
  Furthermore, AMPK has been shown to downregulate the expression of cyclooxygenase
  (COX)-2, which contributes to the pathophysiological progression of certain human
  cancers and inflammatory disorders. AMPK is necessary for the expression of xeroderma
  pigmentosum C (XPC) to promote DNA repair following UV damage.
