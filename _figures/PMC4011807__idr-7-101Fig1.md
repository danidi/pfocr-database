caption: 'Pathophysiology of anthrax illustrated as a series of steps. 1) Bacillus
  anthracis spores germinate and release lethal factor and PA. Initially, PA is an
  83 kDa monomer. 2) PA83 binds to the ANTXR1/2 transmembrane receptors in the host
  cell. 3) Furin, a cell surface proprotein convertase, cleaves PA83 into PA20 and
  PA63 fragments. The PA20 fragment is cleaved off while PA63 remains bound to the
  receptor. 4) Proteolytically processed PA63 monomers assemble into a heptameric
  or octameric PA prepore. The PA prepore can bind up to three or four lethal factor
  or monomers. 5) Prepore clusters are internalized with or without the LRP6 coreceptor
  via receptor-mediated endocytosis, resulting in endosome formation. 6) Acidification
  of endosome results in prepore transformation into a transmembrane delivery pore.
  7) Release of lethal factor and edema factor inside the cell. 8) Lethal factor,
  a zinc metalloproteinase, inactivates MAPKK, resulting in impaired lymphocyte activation,
  B cell proliferation, as well as macrophage apoptosis via activation of the cytosolic
  inflammasome pathway. 9) A calcium-dependent and calmodulin-dependent adenylate
  cyclase increases intracellular cAMP, resulting in activation of cAMP response genes.
  Migration of infected macrophages to lymph nodes is stimulated, as well as inhibition
  of T cell activation, impaired phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and cytokine dysregulation.
  cAMP induces vasodilation, leading to edema.Abbreviations: LF, lethal factor; EF,
  edema factor; PA, protective antigen; LT, lethal toxin; ET, edema toxin; ANTXR1/2,
  low (ANTXR1, previously tumor endothelial marker) or high (ANTXR2, previously capillary
  morphogenesis protein) type 1 transmembrane receptors; LRP6, low-density lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein 6; MAPKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases; CREB,
  cAMP response element binding protein; CRE, cAMP-response elements; cAMP, cyclic
  adenosine monophosphate.'
