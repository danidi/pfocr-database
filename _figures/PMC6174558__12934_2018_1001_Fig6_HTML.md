caption: Scheme of xylonate production using metabolic engineered G. oxydans 621H.
  The pathway marked with blue color indicated the glycerol utilization pathway used
  for biomass production. The pathways marked with yellow color were deleted to increase
  the glycerol channeled into central metabolism. The pathway marked with pink color
  indicated the xylonate production from xylose using the membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase.
  The pathways marked with green color indicated remaining membrane-bound dehydrogenases
  could be used in other oxidative biotransformation processes. bo3, cytochrome bo3
  ubiquinol oxidase, bd, cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase. Membrane-bound dehydrogenases
  transfer electrons to ubiquinone to form the reduced cofactor ubiquinol (QH2), which
  is oxidized by bo3 and bd to generate an electron gradient for energy production.
