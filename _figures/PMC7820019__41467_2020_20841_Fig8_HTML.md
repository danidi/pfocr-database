caption: Phosphorylated (P) alt-RPL36 interacts with TMEM24 via the SMP and C2 domains
  to negatively regulate TMEM24-dependent phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2]
  precursor phosphatidylinositol (PI) transport. In cells lacking alt-RPL36, TMEM24
  is released from the inhibition by alt-RPL36, and more PI is transported to the
  plasma membrane (PM) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is synthesized.
  At the PM, PI is converted to PI(4,5)P2 then phosphorylated by PI3K to produce PI(3,4,5)P3.
  PI(3,4,5)P3 then activates AKT, which phosphorylates and inhibits TSC1/2, then activates
  downstream mTOR signaling. mTOR phosphorylates S6K1, and activated S6K1 phosphorylates
  S6, finally upregulates protein translation, including alt-RPL36. Upregulated alt-RPL36
  then inhibits TMEM24, restoring homeostasis.
