caption: 'Action control in the STN. Simplified scheme of possible conceptual routes
  of information flow between the frontal cortex, STN, and GPI/SNR, based on functional
  anatomical or dynamic connections. Color gradients represent topographical organization
  of functions from the blue “motor” part in the most posterior dorsolateral STN to
  the red “limbic” part in the most anterior ventromedial STN, with connected areas
  in the frontal cortex and GPI/SNR (, ). Similar principles could be relevant for
  the striato-pallido-subthalamic (indirect) pathway, but the figure does not address
  how this input is integrated with cortical input in the STN. All of these schemes
  may be relevant, in parallel or depending on context. (a) Competing input model:
  Competing action plans reaching the STN cause a global excitation of GPI/SNR, conveying
  a “wait” signal to withhold a response until the optimal action is selected by the
  striatum (; ). (b) Specific input model: A specific signal from the PFC to the STN
  (conveying for example “Stop” or “Conflict”) causes global excitation of GPI/SNR
  (). (c) Parallel/spiral model: Parallel circuits in the basal ganglia loop process
  different types of information, though the inhibitory effect of STN on basal ganglia
  output may be similar regardless of information type (). Open and closed loops across
  the basal ganglia may allow information to spiral from ventral to dorsal loops (;
  ; ). (d) Integration model: Integration of information modalities to specific neurons
  across the STN (; ). This could be anatomically supported by nucleus-wide dendrites
  (), intranuclear axon collaterals () or STN-Gpe interactions. STN neurons convey
  a specific but integrated (modular) signal to the GPI/SNR. (e) Dynamic model: The
  frontal cortex conveys different signals to the STN through directed oscillatory
  coupling. For example, a “conflict” signal from the PFC can be transmitted through
  increased theta coherence, and a “go” signal from sensorimotor cortex can be transmitted
  through decreased beta coherence. In the STN, parts of the local processing by neurons
  and high-frequency oscillations can entrain to these rhythms, and the participating
  ensemble of neurons transmits a collective but patterned signal to the GPI/SNR (;
  ; ; ).'
