caption: miR-302/367 targets modulate TGF-β and BMP signaling. In hESCs, neural induction
  is initiated by inhibition of TGF-β and BMP signaling. The rapid decline in mir-302
  levels upon neural induction suggests that miR-302/367 promotes self-renewal and
  pluripotency and represses neural differentiation, possibly by suppressing inhibitors
  of TGF-β and BMP pathways. In this study, we identified three novel miR-302/367
  targets that inhibit BMP signaling. Thus, by promoting TGF-β and BMP signaling at
  the ESC stage through down-regulation of pathway inhibitors, miR-302/367 promotes
  the pluripotency stage and attenuates neural differentiation.
