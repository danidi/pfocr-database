caption: Schematic view of the possible mechanisms by which GLM modulates intestinal
  epithelial proliferation and alters EBF in mice receiving TPN. TPN administration
  leads to significant alterations in a series of luminal sensing–associated molecules,
  including T1Rs, mGluRs, Gα, and transporters in the intestinal mucosa. This disturbance
  of luminal sensing machinery may contribute to the development of mucosal atrophy
  and loss of intestinal EBF during TPN treatment. Luminal GLM supplementation stimulates
  the expression of GPCRs, such as T1R3, mGluR5, and the G-protein subunit Gα, thereby
  reactivating the luminal sensing signaling pathways that are down-regulated by TPN.
  Subsequently, GLM promotes IEC proliferation in TPN mice through activating the
  pAkt/mTOR signaling pathway, which may be initiated via some presently poorly characterized
  TRs localized on small-bowel enteroendocrine cells (, ). In addition, GLM supplementation
  leads to a decline in circulating plasma GLP-2 levels in TPN mice, suggesting that
  the proproliferative effect of GLM on TPN mice is independent of GLP-2 release.
  As well, by inhibiting the expression of the TJ protein occludin in IECs, GLM may
  lead to a partial loss of EBF in TPN mice. Of note, T1R3 and mGluR5 appear to have
  distinct functions in EBF regulation by GLM, whereby stimulation of T1R3 by GLM
  promotes barrier function, whereas mGluR5 may participate in GLM-induced epithelial
  barrier dysfunction in TPN mice. In addition, GLM could improve the transportation
  of luminal nutrients across the epithelium, which is normally down-regulated with
  TPN, by stimulating the expression of multiple transporters such as EAAT2, EAAT3,
  and SGLT-1.
