caption: Summary of interactions between diet-induced obesity and tumor growth in
  Drosophila. (A) Under conditions of a normal diet, Ras and Src co-activated cells
  develop into benign localized tumors. A proportion of Ras and Src co-activated cells
  that are adjacent to the wild-type cells undergo apoptotic cell death. (B) Under
  conditions of a HSD, wild-type cells develop insulin resistance, whereas Ras and
  Src co-activated cells evade insulin resistance, promote increased insulin signaling
  and resist apoptotic cell death, leading to malignant tumor progression. (C) Ras
  and Src co-activated tumors promote malignant tumor progression through a SIK-Yki-Wg-InR
  signaling circuit. Diet-induced obesity promotes SIK activity in Ras and Src co-activated
  cells, leading to the downregulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. This results
  in increased Yki activity and in increased Wg expression. Increased Wg signaling
  increases expression of the InR, leading to increased insulin sensitivity and to
  the evasion of insulin resistance. Increased insulin signaling in Ras and Src co-activated
  cells further promotes SIK activity, forming a feed-forward circuit. InR, insulin
  receptor; SIK, salt-inducible kinase; Wg, Wingless; Yki, Yorkie.
