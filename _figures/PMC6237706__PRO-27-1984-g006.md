caption: 'STATs. The Signal Tranducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) are
  a family of latent transcription factors that are activated by phosphorylation following
  cytokine exposure. The same domain architecture is shared by all STAT proteins and
  is shown schematically above. Unphosphorylated STAT (uSTAT) exists as an antiparallel
  dimer in the cytoplasm (upper). The SH2 domain (red) of uSTAT binds to phosphotyrosines
  in cytokine receptors which allows JAK to phosphorylate a specific tyrosine located
  between the SH2 and transactivation domain (TAD). This phosphotyrosine is then targeted
  by the SH2 domain of the other monomer inducing a large rotation between the two
  subunits of the dimer and allowing phosphorylated STAT (pSTAT) to occupy its DNA‐binding
  competent dimeric structure (lower). The structures shown here are of STAT1 (PDB
  ID: http://firstglance.jmol.org/fg.htm?mol=1YVL, http://firstglance.jmol.org/fg.htm?mol=1BF5
  ) with the colors matching the schematic representation above. The N‐terminal domain
  of STAT does not appear to form a stable interaction with the rest of the molecule
  and is not shown here. The transactivation domain (TAD) is unstructured but allows
  binding of accessory factors.'
