caption: 'Crosstalk among glycolysis, MAPK, and PI3K pathways. Summarized are the
  three main pathways of cell proliferation and survival and the relevant cross-regulatory
  network: MAPK (orange), PI3K/AKT/mTOR (light blue), and glycolysis (green). Three
  related additional pathways are highlighted: glutathione cycle (purple), Nrf2 (black),
  and PPP (brown). Positive regulations are pictured as dotted arrows, and negative
  regulations are pictured as dotted truncated arrows. HCC cell survival is a complex
  mechanism that involves several cellular pathways which act both in single ways
  and as intersected signaling cascades. MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR can be activated by
  tyrosine-kinase receptors to upregulate cell proliferation. They also act as inhibitors
  for cellular apoptosis. Ras protein, an effector of the MAPK pathway, can positively
  regulate PI3K, which increases AKT levels. AKT, in turn, upregulates both HK2 and
  GLUT1, thus favoring the glycolysis cascade. PI3K and ERK1/2 can positively regulate
  Nrf2, thus further increasing the signals for cellular proliferation. The upregulation
  of Nrf2 increases the GST levels which, in turn, maintains the ROS balance in a
  state favoring cell survival. The GST enzyme is part of the glutathione cycle and
  it acts with GSH as detoxification agent against oxidative byproducts. GSH and GSSG
  levels are regulated by GPx, an enzyme mainly used to convert H2O2 into the harmless
  H2O, and GRd, which uses NADPH to reduce GSSG and refill the GSH pool. The MAPK
  pathway, acting through JNK and ERK1/2, positively regulates c-Myc, which in turn
  upregulatesGLUT1, PKM2, and LDH expression levels. ERK1/2 can also act through HIF-1α
  to upregulate GLUT1, HK2, and LDH. Therefore, both JNK and ERK1/2 have a positive
  effect on the glycolytic pathway, favoring glucose entrance and lactate production.
  Apoptosis is inhibited in several ways: Nrf2 is positively associated with Bcl-xL,
  AKT inhibits both BAD/BAX and the dissociation between MDM2 and p53, p38α is present
  at low levels in HCC samples. In this proliferative environment, ROS can act in
  several ways: favoring MAPK cascade, positively regulating PI3K and AKT, inhibiting
  PTEN action, and enabling the dissociation of KEAP1 from Nrf2, which is then able
  to bind DNA and act as transcription factor. Abbreviations: AKT = protein kinase-B;
