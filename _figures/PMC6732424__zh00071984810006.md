caption: Regulation of cyclin D1 by rapalog. Currently, it is known that in various
  cell lines, everolimus downregulates the levels of cyclin D1 by inhibiting its transcription
  and translation and even inducing proteasome-mediated degradation. Our present study
  proposes a novel regulatory pathway of cyclin D1 via autophagy-mediated cyclin D1
  degradation induced by everolimus in breast cancer cells. 4EBP, eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 4E-binding protein; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; mTOR, mammalian
  target of rapamycin; S6K, 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1.
