caption: Model of tissue homeostasis maintenance after an ER stress. Chronic ER stress
  activates the PERK pathway, which results in ATF4 expression. ATF4 has two antagonistic
  functions. On one hand, ATF4 induces a caspase-dependent apoptosis by repressing
  diap1 expression. On the other hand, it favors tissue homeostasis through the induction
  of dilp8 expression by Rac1/Slpr/JNK pathway activation. The role of Msn in the
  control of the observed developmental delay remains to be elucidated. It could either
  negatively regulate the JNK pathway or have a JNK pathway-independent mechanism
  of action
