caption: 'Modular organization of the uncharacterized iterative PKS-NRPS encoded by
  psoA (12.3 kb) and C-methylation activity of PsoF. Abbreviations: KS, ketosynthase;
  AT, acyltransferase; DH, dehydratase; MT, methyltransferase; MT*, partially active
  methyltransferase; KR, ketoreductase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; C, condensation;
  A, adenylation; T, thiolation; R, reductase; SAM, S-adenosyl-L-methionine. (A) Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway for the formations of 8 and 22. The iterative PKS–NRPS is shown
  with its predicted core domains. Pathways toward formation of 8 vs. 22 depending
  on the presence of PsoF are shown. (B) C-methylation of the polyketide backbone
  core by the MT domain of PsoF. Functional analysis was performed with a chemically
  synthesized NAC thioester 25, which was converted into a methylated product 26 by
  PsoF.'
