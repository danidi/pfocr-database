caption: Signaling pathway involved in intact or papain-hydrolyzed glycomacropeptide
  modulation on RAW 264.7 macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide or hydrogen peroxide.
  (A) Glycomacropeptide (GMP) and a papain-hydrolyzed GMP (GMPH) downregulate pro-inflammatory
  response of RAW 264.7 macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). GMPH is able
  to bind LPS and to suppress LPS binding to the macrophage surface. GMPH diminishes
  the increase in myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88) messenger
  RNA (mRNA) expression levels, inhibits phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor
  of κBα (IκBα) and phosphorylation of kinase of IκB α/β (IKKα/β), and blocks p65
  nuclear translocation in part by suppressing protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation.
  Additionally, it inhibits the phosphorylation of p-38, extracellular-signal-regulated
  protein kinase (ERK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) induced by LPS. GMP decreases
  MyD88 mRNA expression levels, p65 nuclear translocation, and phosphorylation and
  degradation of IκBα. Discontinuous lines indicate a minor effect. (B) GMPH has antioxidant
  activity on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-stressed macrophages RAW 264.7. GMPH blocks
  the inhibition of nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related
  factor 2 (Nrf2) induced by H2O2, and, as a consequence, increases heme oxygenase-1
  (HO-1) expression. TLR4, Toll-like receptor 4; P, phosphate group; TNF-α, tumor
  necrosis factor-α; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; iNOS, inducible nitric oxide synthase;
  COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; PLA2, phospholipase A2; Keap-1, kelch like E3 ubiquitin
  ligase complex-associated protein-1; ARE, antioxidant response element.
