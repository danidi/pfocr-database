caption: A schematic representation showing 17β-estradiol inhibition of uPA and MMP-9
  expression, and cell motility via suppression of JNK1/2 pathway in human LoVo colon
  cancer cells. Administration of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) rapidly activates kinase
  such as JNK1/2, thus leading to the expression of downstream targets including uPA
  and MMP-9, which further promotes cellular motility in human LoVo cancer cells.
  However, PGE2 treatment shows no effects on regulation of tPA, MMP-2, PAI-1 and
  TIMPs (TIMP-1, TIMP-2, TIMP-3 and TIMP-4). Estrogen receptor is activated by 17β-estradiol
  binding to form 17β-estradiol-ER complex. 17β-Estradiol-ER complex presents the
  properties of anti-cancer by downregulating expression of uPA amd MMP-9 via deactivation
  of JNK1/2 in LoVo cells. It suggests that 17β-estradiol might inhibit PGE2-induced
  motility of human LoVo colon cancer cells.
