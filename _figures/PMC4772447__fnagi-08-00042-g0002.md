caption: Retromer-mediated sorting in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In microglia, retromer
  regulates the recycling pathway of phagocytic receptors to the cell surface for
  reuse, such as CD36 which can promote Aβ clearance. Retromer dysfunction decreases
  the recycle efficiency of phagocytic receptors, which leads to microglia abnormalities.
  BACE is response to cleave the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to Aβ (of varying
  lengths), and BACE is more activity in endosomes compartments because of low PH.
  In neuron, retromer retrievals its sorting receptor SorLA and SorLA from endosomes
  to TGN. (1) SorCS1 modulates retrograde TGN trafficking of APP from endosomal compartments
  resulting in increased APP localization to the TGN and decreased Aβ. (2) SorLA functions
  in slowing APP exit from the TGN into the secretory pathway whereby interacts with
  APP blocks the ability of APP to form homodimers, which are the preferred substrates
  of secretase. Secondly, SORL1 acts as a molecular link between APP and BACE and
  inhibits BACE interacts with APP in Golgi, which reduces cleavage of APP.
