caption: Schematic overview of the E2-mediated modulation of Gαi,o-coupled (μ-opioid
  and GABAB) receptors via a membrane-associated receptor (mER) in hypothalamic POMC
  neurons. E2 binds to a mER that is Gαq –coupled to activate phospholipase C and
  catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate
  (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Calcium is
  released from intracellular stores (endoplasmic reticulum) by IP3, and DAG activates
  protein kinase C (PKC). Through phosphorylation, adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity
  is upregulated by PKC. The generation of cAMP activates PKA, which can uncouple
  μ-opioid (μ) and GABAB receptors from their signaling pathway through phosphorylation
  of a downstream effector molecule (e.g., G protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying
  K+, GIRK, channels). PKA can also potentially phosphorylate other channels (e.g.,
  TRPC channels) to alter their function (not shown). In addition, the membrane-initiated
  E2 signaling through PKA can phosphorylate cAMP-responsive element binding protein
  (pCREB), which can alter gene transcription through its interaction with the cAMP
  responsive element (CRE). Therefore, the rapid membrane-initiated signaling can
  alter gene expression in an estrogen-response element-independent fashion. Leptin
  binds to its receptor (LRb) to activate Jak2, which phosphorylates IRS proteins
  and in turn activates PI3 kinase (PI3-K). PI3 kinase subsequently activates PLCγ1
  to augment TRPC channel activity. All of these signaling events initiated by E2
  and leptin enhance POMC neuronal excitability.
