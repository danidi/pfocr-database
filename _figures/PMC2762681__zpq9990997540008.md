caption: Model for eNOS regulation of CaMKKβ/AMPK pathway via H2O2. This figure presents
  a plausible if speculative model for eNOS modulation of CaMKKβ/AMPK via H2O2 in
  endothelial cells. The present studies have shown that H2O2 promotes the phosphorylation
  of AMPK in endothelial cells (); the response is blocked by the CaMKKβ inhibitor
  STO-609 () or by siRNA-mediated CaMKKβ knockdown (). Conversely, the NOS inhibitor
  L-NAME potentiates AMPK phosphorylation (), as does siRNA-mediated eNOS knockdown
  (); both of these effects are inhibited by CaMKKβ inhibition (). siRNA-mediated
  eNOS knockdown or enzyme inhibition with L-NAME leads to a marked increase in intracellular
  H2O2 generation (); the increase in intracellular H2O2 generation is blocked by
  PEG-catalase, which also suppresses the increase in AMPK phosphorylation. Since
  previous work have shown that eNOS modulates mitochondrial function, we propose
  that suppression of the eNOS-NO pathway (by siRNA or enzyme inhibition) enhances
  H2O2 production and thereby leads to CaMKKβ -dependent phosphorylation of AMPK.
  We propose that H2O2 directly or indirectly activates CaMKKβ. The phosphorylated
  AMPK in turn phosphorylates and activates eNOS, representing a feedback mechanism
  controlling this pathway.
