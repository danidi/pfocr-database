caption: A model connecting telomere damage signalling and senescence-associated replicative
  arrest. As a consequence of cumulative cell divisions, a DNA DSB signal is generated
  either directly via exposure of critically shortened telomere or indirectly via
  chromosomal breaks, which may occur as a consequence of chromosome fusion and breakage
  following critical telomere shortening. These events elicit an ATM-dependent and
  -independent phosphorylation of targets including H2AX and Chk2. Activated Chk2
  could further propagate the signal via a downstream substrate such as p53, which
  would in turn activate the transcription of the cell cycle inhibitor p21, leading
  to replicative arrest. Other intermediates and co-factors in the signalling pathway
  from the senescence-associated DNA damage to p53 activation are undoubtedly necessary.
