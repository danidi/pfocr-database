caption: Schematic representation of the three main steps (sugar activation, cleavage
  and oxidation) in the glycolysis pathway. Glucose transport-1 (GLUT-1) mediates
  the internalization of glucose across the plasma membrane. Hexokinase (HK-1 and
  HK-2) transfer one phosphate group from ATP to glucose, yielding glucose-6-phosphate
  (G6P). G6P may be shunted into the non-oxidative arm of the pentose phosphate pathway
  (PPP), otherwise it is converted through the intermediate reaction of glycolysis
  to 3-phosphoglycerate. Pyruvate kinase (PKM-2) catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate
  group from 3-phosphoglycerate to ADP, to give pyruvate and ATP. In the presence
  of oxygen, cells completely oxidize most of that pyruvate in the mitochondria to
  CO2 during the process of oxidative phosphorylation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
  cycle. When oxygen is limited, cells can redirect the pyruvate generated by glycolysis
  away from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation by generating lactate (anaerobic
  glycolysis). Lactate dehydrogenase isoform A (LDH-A) catalyzes the reversible conversion
  of pyruvate to lactate with the simultaneous oxidation of the cofactor NADH to NAD+.
  Warburg observed that cancer cells tend to convert most glucose to lactate regardless
  of whether oxygen is present (aerobic glycolysis)
