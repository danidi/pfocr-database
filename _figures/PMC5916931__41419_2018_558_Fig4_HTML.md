caption: 'Through its interaction with different molecules and/or pathways, GILZ has
  contrasting effects on cancer cells. By binding and inhibiting NF-κB and AP-1, GILZ
  may inhibit tumor-promoting factors (1); by binding and inhibiting the mammalian
  target of rapamycin complex-2 (mTORC2) and activating FOXO3Α-mediated transcription
  of the proapoptotic protein, Bim, GILZ increases the apoptosis induced by tyrosine
  kinase inhibitors (TKI) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and increases apoptosis
  of CD34+ stem cells isolated from CML patients (2). In myeloma cells, through an
  unknown mechanism, GILZ mediates GC apoptotic effects (3). GILZ inhibits the proliferation
  of Ras-transformed-NIH-3T3 cells (through inhibition of the Ras pathway) (5). GILZ
  induction increased proliferation of leukemia cells (by increasing mitochondrial
  oxidative phosphorylation) (4), ovarian cancer cells (by activation of pAkt) (6),
  and murine dormant melanoma cells (via the inhibition of FOXO3A and its downstream
  target, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 [p21CIP1]) (7). In lung tumor cells,
  the data are conflicting: GILZ reduces the response to cyclopamine by affecting
  Hedgehog signaling, which is responsible for GILZ expression (8), but decreases
  the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells by binding and targeting hypoxia-responsive
  transcription factor-1α (HIF-1α) for proteasome degradation, thereby decreasing
  COX-2 expression (9). Red T-headed leaders indicate inhibition; green arrow-headed
  leaders indicate activation'
