caption: 'a | As indicated, for oncogenic F-box proteins, inhibitors that directly
  block SKP1–cullin 1–F-box protein (SCF) E3 complex formation or inhibit E3 interaction
  with substrates could be used as anticancer drugs. To this end, Compound #25 (also
  known as SZL-P1-41) has been characterized to impair the incorporation of S-phase
  kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) into a functional SCF complex, thereby terminating
  the oncogenic activity of SKP2. Similarly, ‘skpins’ and SKP2 E3 ligase inhibitors
  (SKP2E3LIs) were identified to specifically disrupt the interaction of SKP2 with
  p27, thereby leading to the accumulation of p27 and subsequent cell cycle arrest.
  b | For tumour-suppressive F-box proteins such as F-box/WD repeat-containing protein
  7 (FBXW7), as genetic ablation or depletion of FBXW7 was frequently observed in
  cancer patients, a rational targeting of its downstream oncogenic pathway (or pathways)
  could be used as an efficient anticancer approach. c | For F-box proteins with context-dependent
  or undetermined roles in cancer, such as β-transducin repeat-containing protein
  1 (β-TRCP1), disease-specific analysis would be necessary to further guide the design
  of personalized therapies. CDC25A, cell division cycle 25 homologue A; DEPTOR, DEP
  domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein; FBXO5, F-box only 5; FOXO1, forkhead
  box protein O1; IκB, inhibitor of nuclear factor-κB; MCL1, myeloid cell leukaemia
  1; P, phosphorylation; PDCD4, programmed cell death protein 4.'
