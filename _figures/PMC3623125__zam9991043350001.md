caption: Four proposed pathways for propionyl-CoA synthesis in H. mediterranei. The
  reactions of the citramalate/2-oxobutyrate (path I), aspartate/2-oxobutyrate (path
  II), methylmalonyl-CoA (path III), and 3-hydroxypropionate pathways (path IV) are
  indicated. For more details on the candidate genes, see Table S2 in the supplemental
  material. Dashed lines indicate more than one reaction, and the circle represents
  the TCA cycle. The pathway intermediates that are cofed in the media are boxed,
  and the disrupted pathway steps are marked with “/”. Two precursors of PHBV, acetyl-CoA
  and propionyl-CoA, are converted to PHBV by β-ketothiolase, PhaB, and PhaEC. β-Ketothiolase
  has not been identified in haloarchaea. SucCD, succinate-CoA ligase (SucD, HFX_2471;
  SucC, HFX_2472).
