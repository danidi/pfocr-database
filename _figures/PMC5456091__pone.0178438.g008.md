caption: Nematode stylet penetration into the plant cell results in production of
  extracellular adenosine-5’- triphosphate (eATP) which signals for calcium (Ca2+)
  influx. Such a signalling response will trigger the stress and disease resistance
  pathway leading to incompatibility. Both pathways were obtained from plant and hormone
  signal transduction KEGG pathways (http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?ath04075).
  Note that the pathway leading to cell senescent was abridged for the purpose of
  simplicity. Proteins involved in stress response and disease resistance pathways
  obtained in our study are mapped here. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK);
  Nonexpresser of PR genes 1 (NPR1); Pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR-1).
