caption: LOXL2 secreted by tumor cells (a) oxidizes lysine residues on PDGFRβ in proximal
  fibroblasts (b), in addition, to its classical role in collagen maturation (not
  shown). PDGF-AB secreted by tumor cells is consequently able to more efficiently
  stimulate PDGF signaling (c), resulting in increased ERK1/2 activation and cell
  proliferation (d). LOXL2 production by tumor cells is required for maintaining LOXL2
  synthesis is a feed-forward pathway (e), whose mechanism remains to be determined
