caption: Model of the signaling pathway that activates NCC in response to low extracellular
  [K+] in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Low K+ intake can subtly decrease plasma
  [K+]. This upregulates the basolateral K+ conductance mediated by Kir4.1/5.1 heterotetramers
  located in the basolateral membrane of DCT cells, which causes hyperpolarization
  of membrane potential and increases the driving force for Cl– efflux through the
  ClC-Kb channels, also located in the basolateral membrane by its association with
  its β-subunit, Barttin. This process lowers [Cl–]i, and therefore allows dissociation
  of a Cl– anion from the kinase domain of WNK4, leading to kinase activation and
  autophosphorylation. Activated WNK4 then phosphorylates the kinases SPAK and OSR1,
  who phosphorylate and activate NCC, increasing NaCl reabsorption by these cells.
