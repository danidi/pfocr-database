caption: We propose that Ras/PI3K/PTEN/F-actin components form a feedback loop that
  is activated autonomously and without extracellular stimuli. The feedback loop we
  describe requires cytoskeletal regulators that simultaneously recruit PI3K and de-localize
  PTEN from the protrusion site. We assume that the regulators for Ras/PI3K/PTEN and
  F-actin polymerization/disassembly can influence the initiation and decay of the
  circuit. As the process is stochastic, we hypothesize that an increase in the level
  of any of the responses over a threshold level may be sufficient to trigger the
  feedback loops and pseudopod formation, while components such as GAPs and phosphatases
  regulate the threshold and level/time of activation.The model illustrates the proposed
  intracellular signaling pathways leading to a positive feedback amplification of
  the pathways controlling pseudopod extension. PI3K, which is translocated to the
  membrane and activated by Ras-GTP together with PTEN released from the membrane
  and possibly other regulators, induces PI(3,4,5)P3synthesis, which elicits F-actin
  polymerization. PLC activation leads to a loss of PI(4,5)P2, and thus may limit
  the number of binding sites for PTEN, which contains a putative PI(4,5)P2-binding
  motif. PI3K and RacGEF1 are recruited to the F-actin polymerization site, by a mechanism
  that is dependent on F-actin and possibly other cellular factors, and induce further
  PI(3,4,5)P3synthesis and Rac activation, respectively. F-actin polymerization and
  PI(3,4,5)P3signaling provoke additional Ras activation, possibly through the recruitment
  of RasGEFs. Each of these enzymatic processes is modulated by negative regulators
  of the cytoskeleton and signaling modules, such as RasGAPs, RacGAPs, PTEN, and PLC.
  Those negative regulators, or inhibitory events, determine the turnover and threshold
  for autonomous activation of the Ras/PI3K/F-actin feedback loop. Chemoattractants
  induce Ras/PI3K activation and reciprocal PI3K and PTEN localization through heterotrimeric
  G-proteins (right), as well as the activation of PLC. We expect that there are additional
  upstream regulators and factors that mediate PI3K's cortical localization, which
  is dependent on F-actin-polymerization (sensitive to Lattrunculin A/B). Activation
  of Ras/PI3K and inhibition of PTEN are integrated into a similar positive feedback
  loop that amplifies the initial response and is required for pseudopod formation
  and the formation of a robust, stable leading edge []. Chemotaxing wild-type cells
  and mutant strains such as pi3k1/2 null cells have a higher threshold for the autonomous
  Ras/PI3K/F-actin activation than unstimulated (“naïve”) vegetative cells. In chemotaxing
  cells, the threshold is higher at the back than at the front because PTEN, and possibly
  other negative regulators, localize at the back, as is graphically illustrated.
  PTEN activity and synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 likely forms a positive feedback loop with
  its own recruitment to the plasma membrane. Ligand-induced Ras/PI3K activation at
  the front, but not at the back, reaches a threshold level, which activates downstream
  responses. In polarized, chemotaxing cells, the threshold for pathway activation
  is significantly higher at the back than at the front. This differential threshold
  depends on both the stabilization of signaling complexes at the existing leading
  edge by the F-actin cytoskeleton and the localization of negative regulators at
  the cell's posterior.
