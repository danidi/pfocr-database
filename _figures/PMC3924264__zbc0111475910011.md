caption: Model depicting spatial restriction of GPCR signaling via divergent endocytic
  compartments. Internalization of activated plasma membrane GPCRs via CCPs is targeted
  to pre-EEs or VEEs via recruitment and binding of the PDZ protein GIPC at the CCP.
  The VEE sorts receptors to the regulated plasma membrane recycling pathway, and
  targeting of GPCRs to this compartment generates a sustained MAPK signaling response.
  Receptors that do not bind GIPC are trafficked to the classic EE for subsequent
  sorting to the recycling pathway (regulated or default) or to the lysosome for degradation.
  The model depicts that VEEs and EEs may be interconnected compartments (dotted arrow),
  possibly via Rab5 endocytic intermediates.
