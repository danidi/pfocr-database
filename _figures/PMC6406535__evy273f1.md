caption: —Visualization of the p53-signaling network modified from the KEGG pathway.
  Included in this figure are the 45 proteins used in this study. These are 42 of
  58 in the KEGG p53 pathway () plus three genes (p63, sirt6, and mapk14) that are
  not in the KEGG p53-signaling network but are associated with the p53 gene and were
  included as “outside the p53 network.” For simplicity, we use the short-hand “p53
  network” within the text to refer to all of these 45 focal genes analyzed. Arrows
  after DNA correspond to all “downstream genes” in the network, whereas we considered
  genes upstream of this point to be “upstream genes.” Each color corresponds to the
  functional categories; green corresponds to genes associated with p53 regulation,
  blue are transcription factors, pink are genes involved with cell cycle, purple
  apoptosis, and light orange inhibit IIS/TOR, dark green inhibit angiogenesis, teal
  DNA-damage repair, yellow exosome, and orange p53 feedback. An asterisk next to
  a gene in the network gene indicates that the gene is part of multiple functional
  classifications (based on the KEGG p53 pathway; ).
