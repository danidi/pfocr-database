caption: AID is believed to initiate SHM through deamination of the dC residues, probably
  on both strands. In phase Ia, replication over dU, without repair, creates G/C transitions
  . In phase Ib, removal of the uracil by UNG produces an abasic site that can be
  cleaved by an APE and subsequently repaired by low-fidelity polymerases, leading
  to transitions as well as transversions at G/C residues. Alternatively, mutations
  at G/C residues might arise if a bypass DNA polymerase inserts a base opposite to
  an abasic site before the lesion has been recognized by APE. The mismatch repair
  pathway may contribute a small fraction of phase Ib mutation although the exact
  mechanism is not known. During phase Ib, NBS1 promotes error-free base-excision
  repair and inhibits the abasic site bypass DNA synthesis or low-fidelity base excision
  repair, if the abasic site is located in the bottom strand. In phase II, mutations
  are introduced at adjacent positions, predominantly at nearby A/T pairs, mainly
  through a MSH2/MSH6 triggered, error-prone, patch repair process. Based on the study
  by Unniraman et al , the top-strand deaminated C residues contribute to most of
  the mutations at A/T residues. The low-fidelity base excision pathway, together
  with pol η, may contribute a small proportion of the A/T mutations and Mre11 might
  be involved in this minor pathway. Base alterations are shown in red. AP, abasic
  site.
