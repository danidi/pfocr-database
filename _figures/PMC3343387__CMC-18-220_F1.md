caption: Schematic diagram of the mevalonate pathway and the chemical structures of
  bisphosphonate drugs. The formation of intracellular metabolites of non-N-BPs in
  osteoclasts induce osteoclast apoptosis, while N-BPs, including alkyl-amino BPs
  and heterocyclic N-BPs inhibit FPPS, thereby preventing the synthesis of FPP and
  GPP, which are required for protein prenylation. N-BPs also can induce formation
  of an ATP analog (ApppI) as a consequence of inhibition of the mevalonate pathway.
  The IC50 data was obtained from reference [].
