caption: Model for the regulation of cartilage differentiation by Hoxc-8. Hoxc-8 leads
  to accumulation of proliferating precursor cells, thus interfering negatively with
  the progression of differentiation. The signaling molecule Indian hedgehog (ihh)
  has been shown to negatively modulate the rate of differentiation at the level of
  prehypertrophic cells. Because patched, the receptor for ihh, is expressed in the
  adjoining perichondrium, this signalling pathway acts indirectly (broken line) on
  chondrocyte differentiation (). Hoxc-8 is expressed in and directly affects chondrocytes
  prior to the prehypertrophic stage upstream of ihh.
