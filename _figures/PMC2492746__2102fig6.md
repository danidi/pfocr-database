caption: A model for a regulatory function and homeostasis of a long-chain mmBCFA
  in C. elegans. Arrows and T bars illustrate positive and negative interactions,
  respectively. The data provided in this study suggest that C. elegans has a novel
  regulatory mechanism that involves mmBCFA to control the onset of post-embryonic
  growth and development. C17ISO is required to repress cki-1 and other growth regulators
  through the interaction with an unknown factor(s) (X). This mechanism functions
  in parallel to the well-known insulin receptor pathway that is capable of sensing
  food (). The diagram also indicates a feedback regulatory circuit that plays a critical
  role in C17ISO homeostasis. C17ISO may represent critical metabolic and growth conditions
  that include the levels of mmBCFA and essential amino acids, protein uptake and
  transport, and certain lipid metabolic conditions.
