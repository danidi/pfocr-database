caption: Self-regulation of NF-κB activity and COX-2 expression. In inflammatory reactions,
  NF-κB is activated and, partly as a result of this, an increase in expression and
  activity of enzymes of the prostaglandin synthesis pathway takes place. Released
  AA is converted into PGD2 or PGE2. In inflammatory reactions, the production and
  concentration of NO also increase. With time, all of the compounds react together
  or undergo further non-enzymatic transformation. AA in reaction with NO is subject
  to nitration. PGD2 and PGE2 convert to 15d-PGJ2 and PGA2, respectively. Compounds
  with anti-inflammatory properties are formed, which activate PPARα and PPARγ. Activated
  PPARα and PPARγ inhibit the activity of NF-κB, which leads to inhibition of inflammatory
  reactions by the products of these reactions
