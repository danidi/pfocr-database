caption: Mechanism of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) as a screening test
  for cardiac dysfunction in liver cirrhosis, such as cirrhotic cardiomyopathy (CCM).
  Heart-cell contractility is determined mainly by the stimulatory β-adrenergic receptor
  system. When stimulated by norepinephrine or other catecholamines, the β-adrenergic
  receptor-ligand complex couples with the G-protein to stimulate membrane-bound adenylate
  cyclase, generating cAMP, which phosphorylates several proteins, leading to intracellular
  calcium fluxes. The calcium then causes actin-myosin cross-linking, and thus cellular
  contraction. In CCM, the β-adrenergic receptor signaling pathway shows defects at
  multiple points, so dobutamine, an adrenergic stimulant, could not induce a myocardial
  response.βAR, β-adrenergic receptor; AC, adenylate cyclase; NO, nitric oxide; CO,
  carbon monoxide; iCa, intracellular free calcium-denotes an inhibitory stimulatory
  influence.
