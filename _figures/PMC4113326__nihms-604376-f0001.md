caption: 'Two types of signals are required for inflammasome activation and production
  of mature IL-1β and IL-18. Signal-1: This results in the production of pro-IL-1β
  and pro-IL-18 through interaction of various DAMPs/PAMPs and cytokines like TNF-α
  with TLRs and TNFR. Signal-2: This leads to inflammasome activation through multiple
  signaling pathways. MSU and other crystals result in the formation of phagolysosomes.
  Another pathway of inflammasome activation is via activation of the P2X7 receptor.
  The activation of inflammasome results in the cleavage and activation of the proteases
  caspase-1 which subsequently cleaves pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to mature IL-1β and
  IL-18 that are secreted out of the cell. ASC, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein
  containing a CARD; ATP, adenosine triphosphate; DAMPs, disease associated molecular
  patterns; IL-1β, interleukin-1beta; IL-18, interleukin-18; MSU, monosodium urate;
  PAMPs, pathogen associated molecular patterns; ROS, reactive oxygen species; TLRs,
  toll like receptors; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-alpha; TNFR, tumor necrosis factor
  receptor.'
