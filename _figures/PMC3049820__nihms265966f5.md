caption: FSS promotes the vesicular release of ATP, where it binds to metabotropic
  P2Y or ionotropic P2X receptors; activation of P2X7 causes ERK1/2 phosphorylation,
  although this is not involved in IκBα degradation, and nuclear localization of NF-κB.
  Activation of P2X7 promotes LPA formation through PLA2 or PLD, but subsequent activation
  of LPA1 or LPA3 does not promote IκBα degradation. Activation of P2Y6 promotes the
  release of intracellular calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum. Purinoceptor activation
  alone is not sufficient for NF-κB translocation, suggesting that another FSS-activated
  signaling pathway (indicated by ?) is involved in this process.
