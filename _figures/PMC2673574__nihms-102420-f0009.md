caption: Model for regulation of PKG-Iα expression by the NO/cGMP pathway. Persistently
  high levels of NO and ANP activate soluble and particulate guanylyl cyclase (sGC
  and pGC), respectively, and cause prolonged elevation of intracellular cGMP levels.
  These high concentrations of cGMP induce autophosphorylation and ubiquitination
  of PKG-Iα. Inhibition of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDE) also maintain elevated
  intracellular cGMP levels particularly in the presence of a GC activator. This persistent
  high level of cGMP provides a mechanism by which PKG-Iα autophosphorylation and
  ubiquitination may be stimulated. Proteasome degradation of PKG-Iα reduces expression
  and blunts NO signaling in cells.
