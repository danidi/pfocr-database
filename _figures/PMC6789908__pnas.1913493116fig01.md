caption: Rationale and workflow of CRISPR-BEST. (A) The CRISPR-BEST plasmid is a pSG5
  replicon-based, temperature-sensitive E. coli–Streptomyces shuttle plasmid. The
  displayed plasmid map is CRISPR-cBEST, in which the core component is the fusion
  protein of S. coelicolor A3(2) codon-optimized rAPOBEC1, Cas9n (D10A), and UGI.
  The key component of CRISPR-aBEST is a fusion protein of S. coelicolor A3(2) codon-optimized
  ecTadA, and Cas9n (D10A). Expression of the fusion proteins is controlled by a promoter
  PtipA. In our tests, the leakage expression is enough to carry out the base editing
  functionality; stronger expression can be induced by adding thiostrepton. (B) The
  sgRNA cassette is under control of the promoter PermE*. A PCR-free, 1-step ssDNA
  bridging approach can be applied for the 20-bp spacer cloning. (C and D) Overview
  of the base editing strategies for CRISPR-cBEST and CRISPR-aBEST, respectively.
  The target nucleotide within the editing window is indicated in red and the possible
  active domains in each step is shown in a brighter color. First, sgRNA (purple)
  binds to D10A Cas9n (blue), ending up with Cas9n:sgRNA complex. Second, the Cas9n:sgRNA
  complex finds and binds its target DNA, which mediates the separation of the double-stranded
  DNA to form the R-loop structure. Third (C), for C-to-T editing, a tethered Streptomyces-optimized
  cytidine deaminase rAPOBEC1 (green) converts the target C in the nontargeted strand
  to a U by cytidine deamination. Due to the inhibition of the nucleotide excision
  repair (NER) pathway by UGI, the cellular mismatch repair (MMR) becomes the dominant
  DNA repair pathway. It preferentially repairs the mismatch in a nicked strand. Therefore,
  the G in the targeted strand, which is nicked by D10A Cas9n, is going to be efficiently
  replaced by A and, in the next replication cycle, repaired to a T:A base pair. (D)
  For A-to-G editing, a tethered Streptomyces-optimized adenosine deaminase ecTadA
  heterodimer (cyan-yellow) converts the target A in the nontargeted strand to an
  I by deamination. As I is read as G by DNA polymerase, the resulting I:T heteroduplex
  is permanently converted to a G:C base pair during DNA replication. (E) Representation
  of the possible amino acid exchanges resulting from CRISPR-BEST. Blue lines indicate
  that the edited nucleotide is in the coding strand, while red lines indicate that
