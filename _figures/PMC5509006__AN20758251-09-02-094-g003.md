caption: NGF is synthesized from the precursor, pro-NGF. NGF binds to the TrkA receptor
  and this interaction induces the activation of the signaling pathway of β-cell survival.
  Diabetes-induced hyperglycemia is known to cause the oxidative stress that decreases
  protease activity, thus provoking pro-NGF accumulation resulting in β-cell apoptosis
