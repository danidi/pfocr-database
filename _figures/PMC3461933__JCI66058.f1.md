caption: TGF-β signaling is dysregulated on several levels in cancers, including glioblastoma,
  and mediates many systemic (immunosuppressive and angiogenic) and cellular effects.
  In contrast to other cancers, the canonical TGF-β pathway (ligand receptor/Smad
  mediators) is not commonly mutated in glioblastomas. However, modifiers of TGF-β
  signaling (e.g., FOXO, FOXG1, BF1, and USP15) and interaction with other pathways
  lead to a shift from primarily tumor-suppressive effects (e.g., antiproliferation)
  to oncogenesis. Targeting the interactions between TGF-β and NF-κB signaling may
  offer therapeutic options. Amplification of EGFR, an NF-κB activator, and mutation
  of NFKBIA (a NF-κB inhibitor) are mutually exclusive and may inform the effects
  of two miRs that regulate NF-κB activity, miR-182 and miR-30e*. The role of TGF-β
  and its relationship to other signaling pathways in gliomas contradicts the growth-suppressive
  effects and alternative signaling effects of TGF-β in noncancerous cells, such as
  astrocytes.
