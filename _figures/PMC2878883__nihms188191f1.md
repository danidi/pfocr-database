caption: S1P homeostasis is tightly regulated by the balance between its synthesis
  and degradation via three enzymes. (1) sphingosine kinase (Sphk), which generates
  S1P through phosphorylation of its precursor, (2) S1P phosphatases (SPP1 and SPP2),
  which reversibly convert S1P back to sphingosine, and (3) S1P lyase (SPL), which
  irreversibly degrades S1P to generate ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal, representing
  the last step in the sphingolipid degradation pathway.
