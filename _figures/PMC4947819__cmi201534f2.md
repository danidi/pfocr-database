caption: 'SOX2-mediated sensing of cytoplasmic DNA and the associated signaling pathway
  in neutrophils. After recognition of a specific DNA sequence in L. monocytogenes
  by the HMG domain in SOX2, SOX2 dimerizes and associates with TAB2 and TAK1, leading
  to dimerization and activation of TAK1. The TAK1 dimer then activates MKK4/7 and
  IKKα/β, which phosphorylate JNK and IκBα, respectively. JNK activates multiple transcription
  factors, such as AP-1, whereas IκBα phosphorylation releases the p50 and p65 transcription
  factors for import into the nucleus and releases NF-κB from its inhibited state.
  Finally, the activated AP-1 and NF-κB together upregulate the expression of proinflammatory
  cytokines. Abbreviations: NF-κB, nuclear factor kappa-B; IκBα, inhibitor of NF-κB
  α; IKK, inhibitor of NF-κB kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; AP-1, Activator
  protein 1; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; TAB2, TGF-beta activated kinase
  1/MAP3K7 binding protein 2; TAK1, TGF-beta activated kinase 1.'
