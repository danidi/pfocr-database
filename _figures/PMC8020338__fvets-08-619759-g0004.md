caption: Ingenuity pathway analysis of the TREM1 signaling pathway in the DH82 cell
  line treated with B. canis. (A) TREM1 signaling pathway in 24 h on coculture model,
  (B) TREM1 and TLR-associated pathway on TREM1 signaling pathway, (B) is enlarged
  from rectangle of (A) genes with upregulation are shown in red, and genes with downregulation
  are shown in green. Orange indicates the predicted activated genes, blue indicates
  the predicted inhibited genes, and an uncolored node indicates that the genes were
  not differentially expressed in this pathway. The IPAs were produced using QIAGEN's
  IPA (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
  Both the models have been identified in this pathway, particularly on the pathways
  of TREM1 signaling with association to TLR, increasing over time.
