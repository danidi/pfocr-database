caption: Metabolic pathways of L. pneumophila related to our results were constructed
  based on the KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway database. Some
  of the identified enzymes are involved in Glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the Synthesis
  and degradation of ketone bodies, and PHB biogenesis. Eleven identified enzymes
  are shown in underlined boldface and the reaction steps that they catalyze are shown
  by black arrows. The numbers in parentheses correspond to the spot numbers in 2D-DIGE
  gel images of  and the list of identified proteins in .
