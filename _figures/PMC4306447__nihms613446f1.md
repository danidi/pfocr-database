caption: The COX-2 pathway plays a critical role in angiogenesis, inflammation and
  cancer (). The COX-2 metabolite of ARA, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), is widely known
  to promote inflammation, neovascularization, primary tumor growth and metastasis.
  Increased expression of COX-2 has been observed in many tumor tissues. COX-2 inhibitors,
  including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2
  selective inhibitors (coxibs), have been shown to reduce cancer risks, . However,
  the life-threatening cardiovascular risks as well as other adverse effects induced
  by long-term and high-dose use of these drugs have jeopardized their therapeutic
  applications, .
