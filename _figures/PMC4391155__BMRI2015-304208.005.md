caption: 'The PVT1 functions. (a) Model of PVT1 ceRNA mechanism operating in normal
  breast but not in breast cancer tissues possibly due to a prevalence in cancer of
  expression of PVT1 isoforms lacking recognition elements for the miRNA to be sponged,
  as it has been hypothesized for the case of mir-200 family based on sequence analysis
  of alternative PVT1 isoforms []. (b) Model of PVT1 positive regulation of the MYC
  protein stability by rescuing MYC from phosphorylation []. This figure is inspired
  by []. (c) The proposed model of TGFβ1/PVT1/NOP2 regulatory network []: TGFβ1 promotes
  the interaction between PVT1 and NOP2 that in turn activates proliferation, cell
  cycle, and TGFβ signalling pathways. The sketches of yellow switches in the figure
  symbolize the pathway activation.'
