caption: 6-Mercaptopurine (6MP) is an antimetabolite with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive
  activities used, usually in combination with other drugs, for treatment of leukemia
  (Schmiegelow et al., 1994). The 6MP is also active metabolite of the immunosuppressive
  drug, azathioprine (Dubinsky, 2004). In fact, 6MP is a prodrug, which is activated
  to 6-thioguanosine-5'-phosphate and 6-thioinosineby hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase
  (HGPRT) inside the cell. These metabolites inhibit de novo synthesis of purine,
  thereby blocking the formation of purine nucleotide and inhibiting DNA synthesis.
  In addition, 6MP exerts its effect through incorporation into DNA in the form of
  deoxythioguanosine which results in the disruption of DNA replication (Lennard et
  al., 1989, Zimm et al., 1984).Apart from the above metabolic pathway, 6MP could
  also enter the catabolic pathway in which the drug is degraded to its inactive forms.
  In this pathway, 6MP is oxidized to 6-thiouric acid (6TUA) by xanthine oxidase as
  the major enzyme and aldehyde oxidase through either 8-hydroxo-6-mercaptopurine
  (8OH6MP) intermediate or 6-thioxanthine (6TX) intermediate () (Elion, 1967, Rashidi
  et al., 2007, Van Scoik et al., 1985).
