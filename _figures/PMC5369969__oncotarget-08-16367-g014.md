caption: As an HDAC inhibitor, AR42 causes DNA damage and causes inhibitory chaperone
  acetylation. Pazopanib, as a multi-kinase and chaperone inhibitor, also inhibits
  chaperone activities as well as many class III receptor tyrosine kinases. DNA damage
  causes activation of ATM. ATM signals to activate the AMPK. AMPK signaling inactivates
  RAPTOR and TSC2 resulting in the inactivation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. Downstream of
  mTOR is the kinase ULK-1; the drug combination via AMPK promotes ULK-1 S317 phosphorylation
  which activates the kinase; the drug combination via mTOR inactivation reduces ULK-1
  S757 phosphorylation which also activates the kinase. Activated ULK-1 phosphorylates
  ATG13 which is the key gate-keeper step in permitting autophagosome formation. AR42-induced
  ATM signaling also acts to reduce the activities of multiple chaperone proteins.
  Reduced HSP90 and HSP70 function lowers the expression of all receptor tyrosine
  kinases and the activities of STAT3, STAT5, ERK1/2 and AKT that results in lower
  expression of ROS/RNS detoxifying enzymes such as TRX and SOD2. Reduced GRP78 function
  causes activation of PERK and subsequently eIF2α. Enhanced eIF2α signaling reduces
  the transcription of proteins with short half-lives such as c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and
  BCL-XL, and enhances expression of Beclin1, DR4 and DR5. Thus the convergent actions
  of reduced HSP90 and HSP70 chaperone activity and eIF2α signaling lead to a profound
  reduction in the protein levels of c-FLIP-s, MCL-1 and BCL-XL which facilitates
  death receptor signaling through CD95, DR4 and DR5 to activate the extrinsic apoptosis
  pathway. Enhanced Beclin1 expression converges with elevated ATG13 phosphorylation
  to produce high levels of autophagosome formation that acts to reduce HDAC2/5/6/10/11
  expression but also to stall autophagosome fusion with lysosomes and to stall autolysosome
  maturation, which likely through cytosolic cathepsin proteases converges with the
  extrinsic apoptosis pathway to cleave BID and cause mitochondrial dysfunction. Tumor
  cell killing downstream of the mitochondrion was mediated by AIF and not caspases
  3/7. The tumoricidal actions of AIF were facilitated by reduced HSP70 functionality
  as this chaperone can sequester AIF in the cytosol and prevent its translocation
  to the nucleus.
