caption: Hypothetical model explaining DNA damage-associated activation of the neuronal
  ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In neurons, synaptic activity-induced increase of cytosolic
  [Ca2+] or neurotrophin-mediated activation of tyrosine receptor kinases (Trks) initiate
  the signaling by the kinase cascade of Raf-MKK1/2-ERK1/2. Thus, ERK1/2 is activated
  following its phosphorylation by MKK1/2. Conversely, its inactivation is carried
  out by phosphatases of phospho-ERK1/2 (PPE). The targets of activated ERK1/2 include
  transcriptional regulators that induce several PPEs terminating ERK1/2 signaling.
  DNA damage disrupts ERK inactivation by reducing transcription of PPEs (see text
  for details).
