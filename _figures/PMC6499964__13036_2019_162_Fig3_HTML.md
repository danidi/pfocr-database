caption: Enzymatic pathways for oxidation of electrochemically reduced tetrathionate.
  Tetrathionate (S4O62-) is oxidized by a membrane-bound Tetrathionate hydrolase (TTH)
  to sulfate and thioperoxymonosulfate (S3O32-) which spontaneously dissociates into
  sulfur (S0) and thiosulfate (S2O32-). (a) Thiosulfate is oxidized via the Sox pathway,
  similar to that shown in Fig. a. However, an additional oxidation step, catalyzed
  by SoxB at the beginning of the pathway, releases an additional sulfate molecule,
  that can also be recycled back to tetrathionate via cathode reduction. (b) Elemental
  sulfur is converted to sulfide by the Dissimilatory sulfite reductase (Dsr), then
  following the pathway shown is Fig. b, sulfide is oxidized to sulfate. This cycle
  is completed when sulfate is electrochemically reduced back to tetrathionate at
  the cathode
