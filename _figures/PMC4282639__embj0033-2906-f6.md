caption: During homeostasis, the CNS microenvironment is enriched with the anti-inflammatory
  cytokines TGFβ1 and TGFβ2, and adult microglia express their relevant receptors.
  As a result of chronic exposure to a TGFβ1-enriched microenvironment, the mRNA levels
  of Irf7 are down-regulated in microglia, and the anti-viral program is shut off;
  consequently, the transcription of IRF7-induced genes is suppressed.A CNS insult
  results in the activation of resident microglia and a robust M1 response, characterized
  by the induction of the inflammatory program (NF-κB) and the transcription of pro-inflammatory
  cytokines such as Tnfa, Il1b, Cxcl1, and Cxcl2 and the down-regulation of Il10 expression.
  The low expression levels of Irf7, resulting from long microglial exposure to TGFβ1,
  prevent the switch to M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype and lead to a vicious cycle
  of the M1 response in adult microglia.Treatment of the TGFβ1-imprinted microglia,
  under inflammatory conditions, with IFNβ1, induces Irf7 expression and consequently
  the expression of IRF7-associated genes. IRF7 induction rescues the switch from
  M1 to M2 phenotype, possibly through inhibition of the NF-κB pathway. The up-regulation
  of IRF7 results in direct suppression of pro-inflammatory gene expression (e.g.,
  Tnfa, Il1b, Cxcl1 and Cxcl2) and in indirect induction of Il10 transcripts. Black
  dotted lines denote pathways that are not fully characterized in this study; gray
  broken lines denote the suggested pathway.
