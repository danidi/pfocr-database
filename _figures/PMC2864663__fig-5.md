caption: Aging-related upregulation of NF-κB signaling in VSMC. Inactive NF-κB resides
  primarily in the cytoplasm as a complex with inhibitory IκB proteins. When the pathway
  is activated, the IkB protein is degraded and the NF-κB complex enters the nucleus.
  NF-κB can be activated by proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α that increases
  with age. TNF signaling via members of the TNF receptor superfamily, such as TNFR1,
  leads to binding and induction of TRAF and subsequently, to IKK activation, which
  phosphorylates IkB and in turn, induces processing of the NF-κB family member p100
  into p52, and the formation of the RelB and p52 heterodimers. On the other hand,
  growth factors may enhance IL-1β–induced persistent activation of NF-κB through
  enhancing ERK phosphorylation. Furthermore, NF-κB could be activated through TLRs
  bound to a ligand, such as ox-LDL, which is increased in the vascular wall with
  aging. This recruits adaptor molecules, MyD88 and/or TRIF, and subsequently activates
  the IKK complex and induces processing of the p65 and p50 heterodimer. Finally,
  NF-κB can be activated through Ang II ligation with AT1 and AT2 receptors. Ultimately,
  translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus leads to modulation of gene expression,
  including those involved in the synthesis of inflammatory chemokines, adhesion molecules,
  survival signals, and multiple enzymes.
