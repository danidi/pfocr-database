caption: Immune and neuronal receptor signaling activate molecular pathways, which
  feed into the mTOR pathway and activate MEF2-dependent transcriptional regulation.
  These central signalling pathways may become dysregulated through genetic mutations
  or environmental exposures associated with ASD and thereby alter neural development
  and function. mTOR activity regulates numerous processes including protein synthesis,
  mitochondrial function, lipid synthesis, cell growth and proliferation, synaptic
  plasticity, neurogenesis, neuronal cell death, ion channel expression and cytoskeletal
  dynamics. Importantly, mTORC1 regulates the synthesis of glutamatergic receptors
  and protein products, including SHANK, SAPAP, neuroligins, AMPA and NMDA receptor
  subunits, many of which are genetically associated with ASD. Mutations in the genes
  that cause most of the syndromic forms of ASD—FMR1, NF1, PTEN, and TCS1/2—disrupt
  components of the mTOR signaling pathway. The MEF2 transcription factor is also
  implicated in ASD. MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome is characterized by ASD-like
  behaviors, perhaps through the function of MEF2 in regulating transcription during
  synapse formation and elimination. MEF2 also likely regulates the expression of
  cytokine receptors in a positive or negative feedback loop, since the promoters
  of some cytokine receptors (like Il1rapl1, for example) contain a MEF2 binding motif.
  MEF2 is also a target of the splicing regulator A2BP1—the central gene in a synaptic
  module identified in a transcriptome analysis of brain tissue from individuals with
  ASD. Green fill indicates protein products of genes associated with ASD.
