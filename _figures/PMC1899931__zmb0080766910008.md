caption: Theoretical model depicting potential interactions in the intra-S checkpoint
  signaling pathway. (A) After UV-induced DNA damage, the Tim-Tipin complex brings
  Chk1 to sites of ssDNA coated with RPA, where the ATR/ATRIP/TopBP1 complex phosphorylates
  multiple molecules of Chk1 that diffuse away from the stalled fork to transduce
  signal throughout the nucleus (). This model differs from that of Gotter et al.
  (), as DNA damage did not destabilize the interaction between Tipin and RPA in checkpoint-competent
  HEK293T cells (Fig. ). Thus, with uncoupling of helicase and polymerase activities
  at sites of stalled replication forks, the increased amount of RPA-coated DNA increases
  the opportunity for Tim/Tipin/Chk1 complexes to interact with ATR/ATRIP/TopBP1 complexes
  to phosphorylate and activate Chk1. (B) Tipin molecules may be loaded onto DNA by
  RPA. When Tim is depleted by siRNA, loading of Tipin at replication forks may inhibit
  DNA chain elongation. (C) Tipin inhibits DNA chain elongation and replication fork
  progression, and this activity is inhibited by Tim. Chk1 also preserves replication
  fork progression (), and this may be through an effect on Tipin or the Tim/Tipin
  complex (indicated by “?”).
