caption: Mechanisms of VIRMA and circ_KIAA1429 involved in human cancer progression.
  VIRMA expression could be regulated by miR-143-3p. VIRMA played an important role
  in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, migration, cell cycle, metastasis, apoptosis
  resistance, tumorigenesis in an m6A-dependent or m6A-independent manner. The TGF-β,
  cell cycle, TNF and other signaling pathways were involved in the underlying mechanism.
  Circ_KIAA1429 can promote HCC through the mechanism of m6A-YTHDF3-Zeb1 pathway.
