caption: LncRNAs regulate p53 signaling pathway through MDM2. LncRNA-PRA promotes
  the combination of HSP90 and p53 and therefore the interaction of the p53-MDM2 is
  decreased. Thus, LncRNA-PRA can competitively suppress the ubiquitination of p53
  to enhance the p53 protein levels. ANRIL represses the expression of INK4 family
  members and impair the p53 signaling pathway through influence the p14ARF-MDM2-p53
  axis. MEG3 may facilitate p53 through suppressing the expression level of MDM2 or
  increasing the protein stability of p53 by RNA-protein interaction. LOC572558 may
  increase the p53 signaling pathway through decreasing phosphorylation of MDM2 and
  enhancing the phosphorylation of p53.
