caption: Sperm structure and energy production mechanisms in the sperm cytoplasm and
  mitochondria. Energy production is initiated by the glycolytic pathway generating
  two ATPs and one pyruvate molecule. Pyruvate is essential for the initiation of
  the acid citric cycle and the oxidative phosphorylation steps of the mitochondrial
  pathway to produce ATP. Caffeine binds to the adenosine receptor to stimulate the
  adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme present in mitochondria, leading to the conversion of
  ATP into cAMP. Protein kinase A (PKA) is activated by cAMP which increases cytochrome
  c oxidase (COX) activity and oxidative phosphorylation. Caffeine also acts as an
  inhibitor of phosphodiesterase enzyme activity, inhibiting the degradation of cAMP
  and promoting an increase in its intracellular concentration.
