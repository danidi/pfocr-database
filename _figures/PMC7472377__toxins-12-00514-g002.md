caption: Insect gut immunity protects against infections and maintains gut microbiota
  homeostasis. DAP-type peptidoglycan (PGN) from intestinal bacteria is sensed by
  PGRP-LC, which triggers the IMD-dependent MEKK1-MKK3-p38 DUOX-expression pathway.
  Uracil also activates MEKK1-MKK3-p38 in a PLCβ-dependent manner; the activation
  of p38 enhances the transactivating function of ATF, which in turn activates the
  transcription of dual oxidase (DUOX). On the other hand, PLCβ-calcium signaling
  is responsible for the induction of DUOX enzymatic activity. Both contribute to
  the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the gut lumen, where they control
  endogenous and infectious bacteria []. DAP-type PGN recognition by PGRP-LC also
  triggers the IMD pathway through the translocation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)
  family member Relish, which then induces increased transcription of antimicrobial
  peptides (AMPs) genes []. Besides, the IMD pathway has established a negative feedback
  loop to prevent overactivation. One is the members of the PGRP family gene (PGRP-LB
  or PGRP-SC) with amidase activity can cleave PGN and therefore blocks the activation
  of the IMD pathway. Another is Pirk, which interferes with the plasma membrane localization
  of PGRP-LC []. In some insect species, the Toll signaling pathway is activated with
  the Lys-type PGN recognition by PGRP-SA or PGRP-SD after microbial infection. This
  initiates a proteolytic cascade that ultimately cleaves pro-Spatzle into an active
  ligand for Toll, leading to the activation of the NF-κB-like transcription factors
  dorsal and then translocation into the nucleus to induce increased transcription
  of the AMP gene. Finally, these immune regulatory networks cooperatively help to
  maintain gut homeostasis.
