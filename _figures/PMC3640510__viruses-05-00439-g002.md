caption: Diagram representing possible mechanisms linking HCV-induced oxidative stress
  with hepatocarcinogenesis. They include accumulation of DNA damage in response to
  ROS augmented by suppressed reparation processes (down-regulation of NEIL-1 DNA
  glycosylase) with concomitant activation of antiapoptotic Nrf2/ARE antioxidant defense
  pathway. HCV-induced oxidative stress also favors tumor development by enhancing
  HIF-1—driven glucose uptake and glycolytic adaptation, regulated by hypoxia-inducible
  factor 1 (HIF-1) as well as by promoting angiogenesis through activation of cyclooxigenase
  2 (COX-2) which caused enhanced biosynthesis of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vascular
  endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In addition, ROS-mediated activation of peroxisome
  proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) as well as blockage by NS5A of proapoptotic
  potassium ion channel Kv2.1 may also contribute to carcinogenesis.
