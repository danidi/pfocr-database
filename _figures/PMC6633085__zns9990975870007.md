caption: Proposed mechanism involved in pathological NO-induced synapse elimination.
  The emergence of new sources for the synthesis of pathological amounts of NO under
  neurodegenerative conditions is caused by upregulation of nNOS in sick neurons.
  Through a paracrine/retrograde signaling pathway, NO activates sGC in neighboring
  target presynaptic boutons. The sustained rise of cGMP within presynaptic terminals
  subsequently stimulates PKG, which either directly and/or indirectly through other
  mediators activates RhoA/ROCK signaling. Finally, ROCK can directly and/or indirectly
  phosphorylate MLC, thereby inducing actomyosin contraction underlying synaptic bouton
  retraction.
