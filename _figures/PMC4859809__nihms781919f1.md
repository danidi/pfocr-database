caption: MicroRNA (miRNA) genes are transcribed as primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by
  RNA polymerase II (Pol II) in the nucleus. The long pri-miRNAs are cleaved by Microprocessor,
  which includes DROSHA and DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (DGCR8), to produce
  the 60–70-nucleotide precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). The pre-miRNAs are then exported
  from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by exportin 5 (XPO5) and further processed by
  DICER1, a ribonuclease III (RIII) enzyme that produces the mature miRNAs. One strand
  of the mature miRNA (the guide strand) is loaded into the miRNA-induced silencing
  complex (miRISC), which contains DICER1 and Argonaute (AGO) proteins, directs the
  miRISC to target mRNAs by sequence complementary binding and mediates gene suppression
  by targeted mRNA degradation and translational repression in processing bodies (P-bodies).
  TRBP, transactivation-responsive RNA-binding protein.
