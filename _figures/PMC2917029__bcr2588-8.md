caption: Schematic illustration of molecular pathway initiated by P4 signaling in
  BPBC cells. MB468 cells usually maintain the activities of PI3K/Akt at high levels
  because these cells contain a mutant pten gene and over expressed epidermal growth
  factor receptor (EGFR). Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway is a vital signal for cell
  survival and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). It is assumed that the
  binding of progesterone (P4) to membrane progesterone receptor (mPR) α in the caveolar
  membrane of the cells inhibits EMT-relevant events either directly through Caveolar
  (Cav) 1 activation or through a cross interaction with EGFR and trans-activation
  of Cav-1 which subsequently inactivate PI3K/Akt pathway. Inactivation of PI3K/Akt
  pathway subsequently inhibits the nuclear translocation of snail and then modulates
  expression of other EMT-relevant proteins.
