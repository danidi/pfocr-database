number: Figure 1
caption: The metabolic network that was reconstructed from the KEGG pathway and SGD
  annotation (http://www.yeastgenome.org/) included glycolysis (grey), the pentose
  phosphate pathway (olive), the TCA cycle, fatty acid de novo synthesis, isoprenoid
  biosynthesis (blue), triacylglycerol and phospholipid biosynthesis (purple) and
  lipolysis, β-oxidation in mitochondria (orange) or peroxisomes (pale green) and
  the glyoxylate cycle. Metabolic reactions that were present in R. toruloides but
  absent in S. cerevisiae are indicated with blue arrows, and upregulation and downregulation
  of genes in response to nitrogen depletion are highlighted in red and green, respectively.
  Abbreviations for the components of the fatty acid synthase system are ACP, acyl
  carrier protein; AT, acyltransferase; DH, dehydratase; ER, enoyl reductase; KR,
  ketoacyl reductase; KS, ketoacyl synthase; MPT, malonyl/palmitoyl transferase; PPT,
  phosphopantetheine transferase. More abbreviations, gene symbols, annotations and
  expression abundance data are included in .
