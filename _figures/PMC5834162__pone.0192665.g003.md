caption: A primary glucocorticoid response pathway (shown in green) occurs when exposure
  to glucocorticoids such as DEX causes activation of the glucocorticoid receptor
  (GR) in the cytoplasm. The GR/DEX complex then translocates to the nucleus and within
  minutes activates gene transcription of genes that contain glucocorticoid response
  elements. FKBP5 is an example of a primary glucocorticoid response gene. During
  a secondary glucocorticoid response (shown in blue), the GR/DEX complex induces
  transcription followed by translation of some soluble factor (?) that in turn is
  needed to activate transcription of a second gene. This process often takes hours
  to days to occur and can be inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX). This model shows the
  activation of the secondary glucocorticoid response genes myocilin (MYOC) and β3
  integrin by the transcription factor NFATc1 [, ]. It is unknown how the soluble
  factor induced by the GR/DEX complex activates the transcription factor NFATc1.
  It could act directly, through the phosphatase calcineurin which in turn activates
  NFATc1 or it could be part of the complex responsible for the nuclear translocation
  of NFATc1. Alternatively, it could interact with NFATc1 to co-regulate transcription
  of secondary glucocorticoid response genes.
