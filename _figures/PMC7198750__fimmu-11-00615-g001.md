caption: cGAS can recognize cytosolic DNA and produce cGAMP. (A) There are two DNA-binding
  sites on opposite sides of the catalytic pocket (site A,B) and a proposed DNA-binding
  site at the catalytic domain of cyclic-GMP-AMP synthesis (cGAS) (site C). (B) Multiple
  cGAS molecules can bind two double-stranded DNAs (dsDNA) to form a 2n:2 cGAS:dsDNA
  higher-ordered “ladder-like” oligomerization. Mitochondrial transcription factor
  A (TFAM) can bend the dsDNA into a U-shaped structure and promote polymerization.
  (C) cGAS can recognize B-type dsDNA. In humans, the cGAS DNA-interfacing residue
  of site A loosens the interaction of dsDNA to curve dsDNA away for more convenient
  binding with next adjacent cGAS. cGAS can catalyze GTP and ATP to synthesize cyclic
  guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP). The N-terminal tail binds
  to the cell membrane, associating with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI
  (4,5)P2]. (D) Accumulation of cGAS-DNA complex goes through a liquid-phase separation
  and condenses into gel-like droplets.
