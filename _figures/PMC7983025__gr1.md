caption: Schematic diagram of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. HIF-α is
  constitutively produced and rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions. Degradation
  of HIF-α is mediated by prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) 1, PHD2, and PHD3 enzymes,
  which hydroxylate specific proline residues within HIF-α. Hydroxylated HIF-α is
  ubiquitylated by the von Hippel–Lindau (VHL)–E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading
  to its proteasomal degradation. PHDs utilize O2 and 2-oxoglutarate as substrates
  in an iron-dependent reaction, resulting in the formation of hydroxylated HIF-α,
  succinate, and CO2. Hypoxia or HIF–PHD inhibitors (PHIs) reduce PHD catalytic activity,
  which leads to cellular accumulation of HIF-α, its nuclear translocation, heterodimerization
  with HIF-β, and increased transcription of HIF-regulated genes, which are involved
  in multiple biological processes. Factor-inhibiting HIF (FIH) modulates HIF transcriptional
  activity via hydroxylation of a C-terminal asparagine residue within HIF-α. EPO,
  erythropoietin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; PGK1, phosphoglycerate kinase 1; VEGF,
  vascular endothelial growth factor.
