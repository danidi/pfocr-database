caption: Similarities between NAA synthesis and citrate synthesis. Acetyl CoA derived
  from pyruvate in neuronal mitochondria can be oxidized for ATP production in the
  TCA cycle, or it can be utilized by two different enzyme pathways to produce metabolites
  for export to the cytoplasm. Acetyl CoA and oxaloacetate can be converted to citrate
  via citrate synthase (red pathway), or acetyl CoA and aspartate can be converted
  to NAA via Asp-NAT (blue pathway). NAA is also synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum
  by cytoplasmic Asp-NAT using acetyl CoA derived from citrate. Citrate is then metabolized
  to acetyl CoA within the cell where it was synthesized, whereas NAA is predominantly
  transported to other cells such as oligodendrocytes for metabolism. AAT, aspartate
  aminotransferase; AKG, alpha-ketoglutarate; Asp, aspartate; Asp-NAT, aspartate N-acetyltransferase;
  CL, citrate lyase; CS, citrate synthase; Glu, glutamate; Mal, malate; OAA, oxaloacetate;
  PDC, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.
