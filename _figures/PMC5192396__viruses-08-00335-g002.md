caption: Inhibition of ribonuclease L (RNase L) activation by picornavirus proteins.
  RNase L is an effector molecule of the innate immune response. In its active form,
  RNase L endonucleolytically cleaves viral RNA (vRNA). Several picornaviruses have
  been shown to inhibit RNase L directly through binding of a viral inhibitor to RNase
  L or up-regulation of the cellular RNase L inhibitor, RLI/ABCE. Picornaviruses also
  indirectly prevent activation of RNase L through extensive disruption of pathways
  that contribute to the innate immune response. The signaling cascade that is initiated
  by MDA5 following detection of viral double-stranded RNA is disrupted at multiple
  steps during infection, which prevents expression of interferon (IFN)-induced genes
  and activation of RNase L. Additionally, the disassembly of stress granules (SGs)
  during infection inhibits SG-mediated enhancement of the innate immune response.
  Simplified pathways are depicted here, highlighting points in the pathway that are
  inhibited by specific picornaviruses and the viral protein responsible (“?” indicates
  that the viral protein responsible is unknown). PV, poliovirus; CVA16, coxsackievirus
  A16; CVB3, coxsackievirus B3; EV71, enterovirus 71; Echo 1, echovirus type 1; HRV1a,
