caption: 'Experimental design and treatment procedure. Rats were divided into five
  groups: Group I (control group; n = 21 subdivided into three subgroups, seven rats
  each), Group II (DN group; n = 14 subdivided into two groups, seven rats each),
  Group III (DN + 3-MA and chloroquine; n = 7), Group IV (DN + exosomes; n = 7), and
  Group V (DN + 3-MA and chloroquine + exosomes; n = 7). Rats of DN groups were injected
  with streptozotocin (STZ) without/with treatment by 3-MA and chloroquine, exosome,
  or both. On the first day, and at weeks 6, 8, 10, and 12, blood samples were collected
  from all rats for biochemical assays, and at weeks 8 and 12, and renal tissues were
  collected for histological and molecular biological examinations.'
