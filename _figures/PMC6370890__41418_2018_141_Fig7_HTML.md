caption: Ubqln4 functions as a tumor suppressor by regulating p21. Ubqln4 can activate
  p53, which results in induction of p21. In addition, Ubqln4 can also interact with
  and suppress RNF114, an E3 ligase of p21, which inhibits p21 degradation via the
  proteasomal pathway. The activation of p21 through different mechanistic pathways
  ultimately induces cell cycle arrest and/or cell senescence
