caption: Working hypothesis for how meiotic arrest is maintained and how LH  causes
  meiotic resumption in follicle-enclosed mouse oocytes. Diagramatic  representations
  of low-magnification views of a section of mouse follicle  (center), and higher-magnification
  views of a mural granulosa cell (top) and  the oocyte (bottom). (Left) No LH. The
  cAMP concentration in the mural  granulosa cells is relatively low because the LH
  receptor  (LHR)/Gs/adenylyl cyclase (AC) system is inactive. The cGMP  concentration
  is high, owing to active guanylyl cyclase (GC) and inactive cGMP  phosphodiesterase
  (cGMP PDE). In the oocyte, the concentration of cGMP is high  owing to diffusion
  of cGMP from the somatic cells through the gap junctions.  The concentration of
  cAMP is high owing to the constitutive activity of GPR3  and the inhibition of PDE3A
  by cGMP. Elevated cAMP maintains meiotic arrest.  (Right) One hour after LH application.
  Activation of the LH receptor activates  Gs and adenylyl cyclase, elevating cAMP
  levels in the mural  granulosa cells. This initiates a signaling pathway that closes
  gap junctions  throughout the somatic compartment (see text). LH also causes cGMP
  levels in  the somatic cells to decrease by decreasing guanylyl cyclase activity
  and/or  by increasing cGMP phosphodiesterase activity. As a result of the closure
  of  gap junctions and the decrease in cGMP in the somatic cells, cGMP levels in  the
  oocyte decrease, inhibition of PDE3A is relieved, cAMP decreases and  meiosis resumes.
