caption: Active tumor targeting was achieved through the addition of the HCC-targeted
  SP94 peptide to the surface of the NPs. The thymine-capped PAMAM dendrimer/CaP complexes
  achieved highly efficient gene transfection efficacy by enhancing nuclear delivery
  of the pDNA. Furthermore, thymine-capped PAMAM dendrimers stimulate the STING pathway
  and serve as an adjuvant to promote the maturation of intratumoral DCs. Efficient
  tumor-targeted codelivery of PD-L1 siRNA and IL-2 pDNA achieves tumor-specific expression
  of IL-2 and down-regulation of PD-L1, increases infiltration and activation of CD8+
  T cells in HCC, and induces a strong tumor-suppressive effect in HCC in synergy
  with a vaccine. CaP, calcium phosphate; TIDC, tumor-infiltrating dendritic cell;
  TT-LDCP NPs, tumor-targeted lipid-dendrimer-calcium-phosphate NPs; IFN-γ, interferon-γ.
