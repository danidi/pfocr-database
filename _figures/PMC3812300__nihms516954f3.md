caption: The final common pathway for SIDS involves a failure to arouse and autoresuscitate
  in response to environmental challenge. Many intrinsic and extrinsic factors increase
  SIDS susceptibility including gender, genetic polymorphisms, prenatal nicotine exposure,
  and temperature. These risk factors can directly alter the function of the preBötC
  and impair the ability of this network to generate sigh and gasping rhythms, as
  well as coordinate cardiorespiratory coupling between the preBötC and Nucleus Ambiguus.
  Thus, the function of the preBötC appears to be an important physiological determinant
  for SIDS.
