  defense response pathways and events resulting in programmed cell death (, ) ultimately
  provide a means for the pathogen to gain nutrients and reproduce. Plants with either
  Tsn1 or Snn1 are susceptible, and plants with both genes experience even higher
  levels of disease (). Elimination of both genes renders the plant resistant.
