caption: Signaling pathway of IL-6. IL-6 secreted by cancer-associated adipocytes
  binds to the IL-6 receptor [] on breast cancer cell and induces a cascade of JAK
  phosphorylation [] that results in phosphorylation and activation of Stat3 []. Activated
  stat3 dimerizes with other phosphorylated stat3 [], translocates into the nucleus,
  binds to target DNA sequences, and activates the transcription of genes under its
  control [], which are usually involved with invasion, proliferation, metastasis,
  stemness, angiogenesis, immune suppression, and drug resistance. SHP1/SHP2, PIAS,
  and SOCs are negative feedback regulated of the JAK/STAT pathway [, , ]. The tumor
  cells also secrete IL-6 and other inflammatory molecules [] that stimulate WAT browning
  [] with increase in UCP1 expression, mitochondria, and thermogenesis. CNTO-328 and
  tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies that target and inhibit IL-6 activation of
  the JAK/Stat3 signaling [].
