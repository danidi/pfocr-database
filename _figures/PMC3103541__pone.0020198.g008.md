caption: The signaling events induced by corticosterone (CORT) are mediated through
  the Glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The reduction in Flk1 levels following long-term
  continuous CORT exposure results in the activation of PTEN, but inhibition of Akt
  and mTOR phosphorylation. The effects of CORT on Flk1 are mediated through calcium
  (Ca2+). CORT exposure results in increased levels of VEGF in cortex. The role of
  VEGF in Flk1 regulation (or vice versa) under CORT exposure remains unknown. Solid
  arrows represent activation, whereas dashed arrows represent inhibition of the pathways.
