caption: Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic
  colorectal cancer (mCRC). RAS activates the RAF family proteins (ARAF, BRAF, and
  CRAF). Activated RAF proteins lead to phosphorylation and activation of MEK1/2 proteins,
  which subsequently phosphorylate and activate ERKs, leading to cell growth.
