caption: Factors contributing to the acquisition of the hallmarks of cancer in a solid
  tumour cell. This schematic shows only some of the critical and complex interactions
  involved in carcinogenesis. Mutations in genes coding for key regulators of cell
  cycle, growth and proliferation (green stars) arise due to insult from both exogenous
  and endogenous sources. These mutations (genetic instability) are likely to work
  synergistically to produce a solid tumour. Tumour promoting inflammation plays a
  key part in tumour development and has a role in sustaining proliferation and in
  activating invasion and metastasis. STAT3, NF-κB and AP-1 are transcription factors
  found within tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs), the tumour microenvironment and
  the tumour cell itself which lead to the activation of IL-8 and VEGF. IL-8 and VEGF
  are also activated by hypoxia and play key roles in inducing angiogenesis. (Me) = gene
  promoter methylation which can result in silencing of TSGs. (GF) = growth factor
  binding to its receptor and activating the MAPK pathway, resulting in cell proliferation.
  ROS = reactive oxygen species, shown here to be produced by mitochondria in the
  cytoplasm as part of normal cellular metabolism. (Deregulation of cellular energetics
  [Dereg. Cell Energetics] is also depicted, whereby the tumour cell switches from
  aerobic respiration in the mitochondria to anaerobic glycolysis within the cell
  cytoplasm. This metabolic alteration is thought to play a role in carcinogenesis)
