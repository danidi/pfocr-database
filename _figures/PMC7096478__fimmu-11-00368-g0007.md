caption: Hypothetical model of the possible mechanisms used by M. leprae to modulate
  the expression of the Notch signaling pathway in the epidermis and their consequences.
  This figure shows how M. leprae could be related to the basement lamina (laminin
  receptor–dystroglycan complex) of the keratinocytes. The proliferation of M. leprae
  inside of these cells could induce a chronic inflammatory process that would reduce
  the glycosylation of the Notch receptor and its interaction with the ligand Jagged-1.
  This fact could induce aberrant signaling and reduced expression of Hes-1, affecting
  the activation of the protein P-63, the differentiation of the keratinocytes, and
  the innate and adaptative immune response against M. leprae.
