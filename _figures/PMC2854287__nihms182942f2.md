caption: 'Overview of the sphingolipid metabolic pathway. Ceramide (cer) is central
  to sphingolipid metabolism and can be generated via de novo biosynthesis, through
  the degradation of complex sphingolipids, or by the recycling of sphingosine. Degradation
  of ceramide leads to the formation of sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).
  Abbreviations: serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), ceramide (cer), ceramide kinase
  (CK), sphingomyelin (SM), sphingomyelinase (SMase), sphingomyelin synthase (SM synthase),
  sphingosine kinase (SK), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P).'
