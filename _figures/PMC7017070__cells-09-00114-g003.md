caption: Important tumor suppressive miRNAs and their impact on cancer cells. MiRNAs
  let-7, miR-622 and miR-26a are downregulated during tumor development in both melanoma
  and HCC (and also many other cancer types) (indicated by red arrows), thereby influencing
  major target genes and according cellular pathways. Downregulation of let-7 induces
  de-repression of integrin β3 promoting cancer cell migration and invasion []. It
  further releases cell cycle promoting cyclins and CDKs [] and inhibits the cell
  cycle inhibitor p16 []. Low expression of let-7 interferes with apoptosis via induction
  of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-XL []. Furthermore, cancer associated downregulation
  of let-7 results in reduced oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis and production
  of ROS []. Downregulation of miR-622 results in an increase of its target KRAS [,].
  KRAS can also interfere with the apoptosis pathway via upregulation of BCL-XL [].
  MiR-622 downregulation also unreleases its target CXCR4 which mediates migration
  of tumor cells []. Further, low miR-622 expression induces de-repression of MAP4K4
  promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasiveness [,]. Low levels
  of miR-26a in tumor cells lead to increased integrin α5 expression and reduced E-cadherin
  expression inducing EMT [,,]. It further induces the release of anti-apoptotic SODD
  []. Moreover, both mir-622 and miR-26a are suppressed by EZH2 in tumor cells [,,].
  Simultaneously, decreased miR-26a expression releases its target EZH2, creating
  a regulatory feedback loop [,,,].
