caption: Space filling model of GPCR-mediated invasion of cardiovascular cells. Based
  on the unified model of T. cruzi invasion proposed by , the scheme illustrates how
  GPCRs (including BKRs/ETRs) originally confined to lipid rafts or caveolae (left
  side of panel) might be incorporated into the molecular platforms that coalesce
  around ceramide-enriched vesicles generated by the housekeeping mechanisms of plasma
  membrane repair from cellular wounds. According to Fernandes and Andrews, extracellular
  calcium influx resulting from cell wounds (center of panel) trigger Ca2+-regulated
  lysosomal exocytosis, which in turn leads to the secretion of acid sphingomyelinase
  (ASM). Acting pericellularly, ASM generates ceramide-enriched endocytic vesicles.
  Next, BKRs, ETRs, along with several other GPCRs partners and several accessory
  signaling molecules translocate from lipid rafts/caveolae into the ceramide-platforms.
  In the resting state, signal transduction via BK2R/ETAR/ETBR (cross-talk) may likely
  depend on formation of homo or hetero-oligomers in multimolecular platforms coalescing
  in ceramide-enriched vesicles. During inflammation, the repertoire of GPCRs in the
  ceramide-rich endocytic vesicles is modified by the incorporation of inducible molecules,
  such as BK1R and CPM. ET-1 (host cell origin/autocrine route) and des-Arg-kinins
  (released from surface bound HK by cruzipain, then subsequently metabolized by CPM)
  bind to their respective GPCRs (ETAR/ETBR and BK1Rs). Feedback cycles might enhance
  the efficiency of the housekeeping plasma-membrane repair mechanisms via BKR/ETR-driven
  (i) induction of the canonical pathway of Ca2+-regulated lysosomal exocytosis and/or
  (ii) induction of the calcium-dependent lysosomal fusion with the nascent parasitophorous
  vacuole () and/or PIK3-dependent retention signals ().
