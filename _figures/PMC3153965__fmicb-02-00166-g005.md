caption: Main cellular pathways and processes inferred to be modulated or activated
  after colonization of mouse cecum by A. muciniphila. Only induced pathways are shown.
  Distinguishing features are the induction of pathways involved in (epithelial) cell
  membrane modifications, sulfur metabolism, and pathways involved in the maturation
  of immune cells via induction of surface receptors. Pathways were considered to
  be induced if (nearly) all of the genes belonging to the pathway were up-regulated.
  The upper part of the image shows pathways and processes that are expected to occur
  in epithelial cells as well as pathways and processes with undefined or non-specific
  localization. Pathways and processes named in text “balloons” were among the most
  significantly modulated pathways according to IPA canonical pathway analysis. The
  lower part of the image shows pathways known to be regulated in immune cells of
  the lamina propria. In order to determine in which cell type and subcellular compartment
  a gene product was localized, the Entrez Gene GO annotation, Entrez Gene GeneRIFs,
  and scientific literature information were used. Interacting pathways and processes
  are grouped together as well as possible, both in terms of annotation as well as
  within the graphical space limitations.
