caption: A schematic diagram of the molecular mechanisms by which Bmal1 acts with
  glycolytic pathway to regulate macrophage polarization in a chronic binge alcohol-induced
  ALD mouse model. The down-regulation of Bmal1 expression after EtOH treatment can
  induce the transformation of macrophages into M1-type by interacting with glycolytic
  pathway. However, the interaction between Bmal1 and glycolysis is linked by S100A9
  protein. In brief, this crosstalk mechanism offers a possible interpretation for
  the inflammatory response causing by liver macrophage polarization induced by ethanol
  in vitro.
