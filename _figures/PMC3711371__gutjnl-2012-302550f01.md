caption: Schematic representation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. During
  systemic inflammation, the central nervous system is activated via the circumventricular
  organs and by vagal afferents. After integration, this sensory input will trigger
  the efferent arm via the coeliac superior mesenteric ganglion modulating the immune
  response in the spleen. The activation of adrenergic neurones in the spleen leads
  to the release of norepinephrine that induces the release of acetylcholine by a
  subset of T cells. Acetylcholine interacts with α7nAChR expressed on cytokine producing
  macrophages reducing the release of tumour necrosis factor, IL-1, IL-18, HMGB1,
  and other cytokines. During intestinal inflammation the central nervous system is
  activated via the vagal afferents arm which will trigger activation of the vagal
  efferent arm directly contacting the myenteric neurones in the intestinal wall.
  Activation of enteric neurones induces the release of acetylcholine and possibly
  of other immune-modulatory neurotransmitters leading to the control of intestinal
  inflammation and restoring intestinal immune homeostasis.
