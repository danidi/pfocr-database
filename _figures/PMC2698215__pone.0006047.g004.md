caption: The classic pathway is initiated by the binding of C1q, C1r and C1s (the
  C1 complex) to antibodies linked to the activation surface. The proteolytic activity
  of C1r is automatically activated by interaction with C1q. C1r then cleaves and
  activates C1s, which is another serine protease. C1s acts specifically on C2 and
  C4 activating them. Once cleaved, the fragment C4b is capable to bind covalently
  to the activation surface creating a binding site to C2a. The active serine protease
  C2a, in the C4b-C2a complex, acts on C3 producing C3b molecules which are also capable
  to bind covalently to the activation surface nearby its site of activation. The
  complex C4b-C2a-C3b acts as a C3 convertase as well as a C5 convertase generating
  the MAC. For activation of the alternative pathway, a small fraction of C3 present
  in the extracelular fluids slowly undergoes spontaneous reaction with H2O molecules
  generating C3-H2O. These molecules can interact with the protein B generating the
  B-C3-H2O complex which is a substrate for D, a plasmatic serine protease. The Bb-C3-H2O
  complex acts on C3 cleaving it to C3b and C3a. Most of the C3b molecules generated
  will combine with H2O or other self molecules becoming inactive. On the other hand,
  if a C3b molecule is generated near an adequate surface such as a bacterium, it
  will covalently bind to it creating a binding site for factor B. The C3b-B complex
  is activated by the protease D generating C3b-Bb, an efficient protease capable
  to activate other C3 molecules. The complex C3b-Bb-C3b is an efficient C3 convertase
  as well as a C5 convertase generating the MAC. To simplify, the lectin pathway as
  well as the normal regulatory proteins were omitted.
