caption: Adipocyte receptors that have been proposed to promote the browning of white
  fat or maintenance of a brown adipocyte (BA) phenotype. β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-AR)
  which signals through protein kinase A(PKA) to phosphorylate (P) and activate transcription
  factors such as cAMP response element binding protein(CREB). β3-ARs also activate
  p38 which phosphorylates ATF2 to promote the transcription of genes such as PGC1α
  and UCP1. In parallel, β3-ARs stimulate lipolysis by adipose triglyceride lipase
  (ATGL) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL). Free fatty acids (FFA) mobilized by these
  lipases activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) and PPARδ (not
  shown) to promote the expression of BA genes. Natrietic peptides (NP) bind natrietic
  peptide receptors (NPR) and activate protein kinase G (PKG). In addition, bone morphogenetic
  protein (BMP8b) and BMP7 signal through p38 by unknown mechanisms (dashed line).
  Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) produced by the liver and in brown adipose tissue,
  acts through the receptor FGF1 and scaffold βKlotho to activate ERK1/2 and promote
  a BA phenotype through unknown pathways. Transient receptor potential cation channel
  subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8), which is activated by menthol, promotes thermogenesis
  in BAT in a PKA-dependent manner. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) activate PPARγ, which
  through PRDM16 and the deacetylase sirtuin1 (SirT1), promote the browning of white
  fat. Finally, the hormone irisin, secreted from muscle, binds a yet unknown receptor
  to promote the appearance of BA by signaling through a PPARα dependent pathway.
