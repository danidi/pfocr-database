caption: In regions of bone that experience high biomechanical loads (red), the Piezo1
  ion channel is activated in both osteoblasts (green) and osteocytes (olive). In
  osteocytes, the activation of Piezo1 leads to increased Wnt1 expression in a Yap/Taz-dependent
  manner. Wnt1 then activates the Wnt signaling pathway, which stimulates the formation
  of new bone (purple) by osteoblasts. In regions of bone that experience average
  or low biomechanical loads, the osteoblasts are inactive and there is no increase
  in bone mass.
