caption: A schematic diagram showing the signaling pathways engaged by the LMP2A gene.
  The N terminal domain of LMP2A prevents B cell receptor (BCR) signaling by recruiting
  Nedd4-like ubiquitin-protein ligases and B-cell signaling molecules, leading to
  the degradation of LMP2A and its associated molecules in a ubiquitin-dependent manner.
  LMP2A also provides a survival signal to BCR-negative B-cells through the activation
  of the Ras/phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathway. Activating this pathway
  induces the transcription of anti-apototic genes, the expression of which is controlled
  by NF-κ B. Notch signaling regulates various cellular processes including cell survival
  and proliferation. In LMP2A-expressing splenic B cells, Notch activation is reported.
  Notch signaling is closely related to the pathogenesis of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).
  LMP2A perturbs the turnover of β-catenin and other proteins that are involved in
  Wnt signaling. β-catenin is stabilized and activated by LMP2A through PI3-K/Akt
  activation, which inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). The association
  of LMP2A with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was implicated in the development
  of B-cell malignancy while the activation of MAPK was not observed in LMP2A-expressing
  epithelial cells. The multiple cysteine motifs within the C-terminal of LMP2A are
  required for LMP2A palmitoylation. Studies of the proposed palmitoylation are required
  for LMP2A-mediated survival signal and function as they regulate the protein interaction
  or localization required for LMP2A-mediated cell survival.
