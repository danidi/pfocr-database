caption: TNF ligation with the TNFR1 receptor induces pro-caspase-8 recruitment to
  the activated TNFR1 signaling complex-I via FADD. Pro-caspase-8 cleavage and activation
  results in an active caspase-8, which limits complex-I activity by cleaving RIPK1.
  c-FLIPS inhibits caspase-8 activity, whereas c-FLIPL can partially promote it. In
  complex-I, RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by cIAP1/2, TRAF2 and the LUBAC complex, resulting
  in K63-linked and M1-linked chains, respectively. IKKα/β/NEMO and TAK1/TAB2/3 kinase
  complexes are recruited to ubiquitinated RIPK1 and activated, inducing degradation
  of IκB and subsequent NFκB pathway activation, which results in expression of cytokines
  and A20. The latter inhibits RIPK1 and forms a negative feedback. RIPK1 is deubiquitinated
  by CYLD and A20 in complex-I to promote formation of complex-II. Caspase-8 cleaves
  CYLD and RIPK1 to inhibit complex-II formation. Canonical complex-IIa is formed
  independent of RIPK1 kinase activity, where FADD and caspase-8 are recruited to
  RIPK1. RIPK1-dependent apoptosis (RDA) complex-IIa forms downstream of RIPK1 kinase
  activity and is negatively influenced by IKKα/β/NEMO and TAK1/TAB2/3 kinase complexes.
  Both the canonical and RDA complex-IIa promote activation of caspase-8/caspase3/7
  cascade and execution of apoptotic cell death. Under the conditions of caspase-8
  inhibition, complex-IIb/necrosome is formed, to which RIPK3 is recruited downstream
  of RIPK1 kinase activity. Complex-IIb/necrosome results in phosphorylation of MLKL
  and execution of necrotic cell death. RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1 inhibits both RDA complex-IIa
  and complex-IIb/necrosome. Activated RIPK1 is marked with *.
