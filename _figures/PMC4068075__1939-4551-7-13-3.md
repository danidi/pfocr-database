caption: Consequences of EMT on innate signaling. The innate NFkB pathway is composed
  of the rapidly responding (canonical)- and the slower responding (noncanonical)
  pathways. The canonical pathway controls the inflammatory response, and is coupled
  to the noncanonical pathway through a feed-forward pathway by the synthesis of TRAF1
  and NFκB2, two rate limiting factors in noncanonical pathway activation. Through
  epigenetic reprogramming and enhanced transcriptional elongation through the cyclin
  dependent kinase (CDK), the rate-limiting TRAF1/NFκB2 translation is reduced, resulting
  in enhanced pathway activation in EMT.
