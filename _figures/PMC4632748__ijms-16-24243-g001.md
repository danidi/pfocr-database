caption: 'Simplified possible molecular signaling pathways (1 to 6) of estrogen (E)
  and estrogen receptors (ER). (1) Classical and direct pathway: ligand activation
  is followed by binding to the estrogen response element (ERE), including coactivators
  (CoA) and histone acetyl transferases (HATs) before gene regulation is modified;
  (2) tethered pathway: ligand dependent pathway which includes protein-protein interaction
  with other transcription factors, e.g., activator protein 1 (Ap1) and specificity
  protein 1 (Sp1), after ligand activation, thereby regulating genes by indirect DNA
  binding following serum response element (SRE) activation of transcription; (3)
  non-genomic ligand dependent reaction: the receptor (e.g., classical ER, ER isoform
  or other receptors) is activated by a ligand, which may be associated with the membrane.
  This is then followed by signaling cascades initiated by second messengers (SM),
  initiating a rapid physiological response, which does not involve gene regulation;
  (4) ligand-dependent reaction: ER is methylated by ligand induction and ER–phosphoinositide
  3-kinase (PI3K)–steroid receptor coactivator (SRC)-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) forms
  a complex that further activates the serine/threonine–protein kinase Akt, which
  then activates transcription without ER binding to DNA; (5) ligand independent reaction:
  ER–SRC–proline-, glutamic acid and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) forms a complex
  which then activates transcription, also without ER binding to DNA; (6) another
  ligand independent reaction activates through other signaling pathways, like growth
  factor signaling by downstream events of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs), such as
  epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor
  2 (HER2) and the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) [,].'
