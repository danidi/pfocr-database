caption: Model of the interplay between VIP and NO and autoinhibition by NO. Activation
  of nNOS produces NO which stimulates the release of VIP from enteric neurons [,]
  but which also causes autoinhibition of nNOS in the presynaptic varicosity [,].
  VIP activation of the NPR-C receptor on the smooth muscle cell causes Ca2+ influx
  which activates a membrane bound eNOS [,]. NO activates the cGMP signaling pathway
  leading to relaxation; however neither this pathway nor the co-product of eNOS activation,
  l-citrulline, appears to mediate the autoinhibition. It is possible that NO generated
  by nNOS in the enteric inhibitory neuron and which diffuses into the smooth muscle
  cell may also participate in autoinhibition of eNOS. Autoinhibition is depicted
  as occurring at the site of the membrane bound eNOS enzyme although an additional
  action upstream of eNOS cannot be completely ruled out.
