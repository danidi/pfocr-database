caption: 'There are nine identified Coq proteins in S. cerevisiae ascribed the following
  functions: Coq1, hexaprenyl-diphosphate synthase; Coq2, 4-hydroxybenzoate:hexaprenyl-diphosphate
  transferase; Coq3, O-methyltransferase; Coq5, C-methyltransferase; Coq6, potential
  flavin-dependent monooxygenase; and Coq7/CLK-1, putative di-iron hydroxylase catalyzing
  the last hydroxylase step. The function of Coq4, Coq8, and Coq9 are unknown. The
  number of isoprene units in the tail of Q is designated by n; n = 6 in S. cerevisiae,
  9 in C. elegans, and 10 in Homo sapiens.'
