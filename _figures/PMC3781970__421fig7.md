caption: Scheme of Rho1 relationship with Pmk1 and calcineurin. Decrease of Rho1 function
  causes cell wall defects that activate the cell integrity MAPK Pmk1 signaling, and
  this is detrimental for the cells. At the same time, decrease of Rho1 function causes
  a rise in calcineurin activity that is required for cell survival.
