caption: Summary of P450 enzymes in cholesterol and bile acid biosynthesis. Biosynthesis
  of cholesterol from acetyl-CoA involves approximately 30 enzymatic steps. There
  is a single P450 (CYP51A1) in cholesterol biosynthesis. In the classic (neutral)
  pathway of bile acid biosynthesis, cholesterol is converted to two primary bile
  acids in human liver—cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. In the alternative (acidic)
  pathway and other pathways involving oxysterols, mainly chenodeoxycholic acid is
  formed. The key regulated enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways are CYP7A1,
  CYP8B1, CYP27A1 and CYP7B1.
