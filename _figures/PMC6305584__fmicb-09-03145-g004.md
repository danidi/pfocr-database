caption: Proposed spatial compartmentalization of MK-9 biosynthetic pathway. DMK-9
  is formed in the PM-CW by the prenyltransferase MenA. DMK-9 traffics to the IMD
  and modified by MenG and MenJ, forming MK-9 and MK-9 (II-H2), respectively. The
  mature molecule can then be transferred to the PM-CW to serve as an electron carrier.
  The red line in the polyprenol moiety of MK-9 (II-H2) indicates the saturation of
  the second isoprene unit mediated by MenJ. SAM, S-adenosylmethionine.
