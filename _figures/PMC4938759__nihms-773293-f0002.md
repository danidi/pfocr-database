caption: As discussed in text, mTORC1 promotes BTB remodeling whereas mTORC2 promotes
  BTB integrity through their actions on the organization of actin microfilaments
  at the basal ES/BTB, in which mTORC2 likely promotes unbundling of actin microfilaments
  whereas mTORC2 promotes bundling of actin microfilaments. The antagonistic actions
  of two these signaling complexes thus provide an efficient mechanism to confer restructuring
  of the BTB during the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis, in particular at stage
  VII-VIII of the cycle when preleptotene spermatocytes are being transported across
  the immunological barrier. Furthermore, the effect of mTORC2 on gap junction function
  can also modulate meiosis as discussed in text.
