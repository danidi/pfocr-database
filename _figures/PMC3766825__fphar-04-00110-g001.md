caption: Schematic of somatostatin signaling, pathological regulators and biological
  functions relevant to affect regulation. Somatostatin pathway activity is responsive
  to (left panel), and regulates (right panel), several biological events, and molecular
  and cellular properties that have been linked to mood disturbances. Somatostatin
  and somatostatin-expressing interneurons are key conduits for regulating incoming
  information and pyramidal cell function. In contrast, other GABA neurons subtypes
  targeting the perisomatic pyramidal cell compartment are mostly not affected in
  major depression. NPY, neuropeptide Y; PYR, pyramidal neuron; PV, parvalbumin.
