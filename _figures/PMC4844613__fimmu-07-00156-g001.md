caption: Under normal conditions, the secreted by mitochondria is transformed by catalase
  action and GSH into H2O. However, when external factors (ionizing radiation or virus)
  initiate the astrocytes transformation into astrocytoma cells, microglia are activated
  conducting to the release of proinflammatory cytokines, macrophages infiltration,
  and DAMP’s release, which are recognized by infiltrated macrophages and TLRs on
  the surface of microglia (resident macrophages). These changes lead to an oxidant
  environment where the  is transformed by SOD (which is overexpressed in tumor cells)
  into H2O2 and OH⋅, which drives to metabolic changes and chromosomal instability
  and finally, leading to resistance, aggressiveness, and cell proliferation. Besides,
  the oxidant environment activates the FyN pathway, which under normal conditions,
  with the activation of Fyn kinase plus C-Cb1, produces ubiquitination of growth
  factor receptors and posterior degradation, directing to cell differentiation. In
  GBM cells, the sequestration of C-Cb1 by Cool-1/B-Pix avoids the degradation of
  such receptors, increasing their expression and guiding to cell proliferation in
  GBM environment.
