caption: BTB restructuring and spermiation are coordinated by IL-1α during spermatogenesis.
  In stages VI and VII of the seminiferous epithelial cycle (left panel), an intact
  BTB and apical ES are associated with hexagonally packed actin bundles. A surge
  in IL-1α at stage VIII (right panel) is believed to play a role in BTB restructuring
  and apical ES disassembly. IL-1 signaling (green arrows) may contribute to the (i)
  remodeling of actin bundles into a branched network by mislocalizing Eps8 and increasing
  Arp2/3 activity; (ii) disassembly and/or endocytosis of BTB junctional complexes,
  which possibly involves the p38 MAP kinase pathway; (iii) inhibition of BTB protein
  degradation; and (iv) disassembly of Sertoli–germ cell adhesion, which possibly
  involves the ERK pathway. These effects, together with testosterone, which is known
  to promote the recycling of BTB proteins, result in the simultaneous disassembly
  of the “old” BTB and the assembly of a “new” BTB. Thus, BTB integrity is maintained
  while preleptotene spermatocytes enter the adluminal compartment with spermiation
  occurring at the opposite end of the seminiferous epithelium
