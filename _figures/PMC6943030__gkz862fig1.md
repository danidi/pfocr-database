caption: A typical MetaCyc pathway. A short pathway was selected for this figure;
  the average number of metabolites in a MetaCyc pathway is 13, with the largest pathway
  containing 244 metabolites. The green captions are links to the upstream and downstream
  pathways that produce the inputs and outputs for this pathway. Enzymes are labeled
  in ochre, genes are labeled in purple and compounds are labeled in red. When available,
  EC numbers are shown next to reactions. Each item in a pathway diagram is a clickable
  hyperlink to a dedicated page for that item. Below each pathway is a summary and
  additional information such as the pathway’s taxonomic range, some taxa known to
  possess it, the pathway’s position within the pathway ontology, and potential pathway
  variants (not shown).
