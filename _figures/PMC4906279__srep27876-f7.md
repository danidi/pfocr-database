caption: Upon activation of TLRs-NF-κB by cecropin B, NF-κB p65 translocates into
  the nucleus and disrupts the binding of PXR-RXR-α heterodimers to its regulatory
  sites by interacting with RXR-α, which is the obligate partner of PXR; thereby suppressing
  CYP3A29 expression. Simultaneously, NF-κB p65 binds to the promoter region of PXR,
  leading to the repression of PXR. The downregulation of the expression of PXR results
  in the downregulation of the expression of CYP3A29.
