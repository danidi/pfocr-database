caption: 'Simplified amino acid metabolism pathway based on KEGG analysis of metabolites
  and proteins identified in C. terniflora leaves pre- and post-treatment with high
  level of UV-B irradiation for 5 h followed by the dark for 36 h. Circles and arrows
  indicate metabolites and proteins, and red and blue represent significant increases
  and decreases, respectively, in metabolites and proteins. Black indicates no significant
  change and gray indicates those that were unidentified. Abbreviations: metH, 5-Methyltetrahydropteroyltriglutamate-homocysteine
  methyltransferase; metK, S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase'
