caption: (1) Neuronal damage, from direct insults or the presence of toxic entities,
  can cause the dysfunctioning of upstream neurons in a neuronal circuit. (2) This
  damage can then lead to aberrant neurotransmitter release, which if unchecked, may
  lead to post-synaptic neuronal excitotoxicity. (3) The presence of proximal neuroinflammation
  can initiate the TNF-α IP3R signaling pathway in C57BL/6 neurons. (4) Elevated IP3R
  signaling leads to enhanced Ca2+-activated K+ channel function and hyper-polarization
  of the C57BL/6 neurons. (5) Neurotransmitter release is reduced, leading to the
  protection of downstream neurons (6). (7) In 3xTg-AD neurons, TNF-R expression is
  reduced through altered proteolytic processing by the gamma-secretase complex, thereby
  ablating TNF-α driven elevation of IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release. (8) This may, in
  turn, lead to the further transmission of the excitotoxic signal eventually result
  in the death of downstream neurons and the spread of CNS damage (9).
