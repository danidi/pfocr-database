caption: Proposed mechanism of norepinephrine (NE)/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
  (MAPK) signalling in T-lineage cells. NE stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors
  (βARs) on T-lineage cells induces signalling events activating the classical Gs
  protein/adenylyl cyclase (AC)/cyclic AMP (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and
  leading to the dually phosphorylated, active form of p38 MAPK. Although the events
  relating PKA and p38 remain unidentified, the process of activation involves p38
  kinase activity. Downstream events of p38 MAPK activation include phosphorylation
  of activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), upregulation of FasL mRNA and cell
  death, which may be directly related. These events might contribute to the decreased
  cellularity and thymocyte number, and increased apoptosis, observed in the thymus
  of stressed mice., Dashed lines represent as-yet-undefined steps in the mechanism.
