caption: Metabolic pathways connecting gene expression, DNA methylation, and targeted
  metabolomic data. Arrows represent conversion of one metabolite to another and –|
  indicates negative regulation. Italicized genes encode enzymes responsible for these
  enzymatic conversions. *Denotes genes in the acetyl-CoA metabolic process pathway
  that were up-regulated in one or more phthalate-exposed groups of females relative
  to controls via edgeR QLF differential expression analyses at either PND21 or 10 months
  with unadjusted P-values <0.10. Decreased hepatic acetyl-CoA levels observed in
  phthalate-exposed females at PND21 (blue arrows) in conjunction with up-regulation
  of the genes outlined above suggest that acetyl-CoA was being used for production
  of fatty acids at PND21. Increased hepatic acetyl-CoA and acylcarnitine levels observed
  in 10-month females perinatally exposed to phthalates (purple arrows) in conjunction
  with up-regulation of the genes outlined above suggest that oxidation of fatty acids
  was increasing acetyl-CoA production. δCpt1b mRNA expression was increased in phthalate-exposed
  10-month females via post hoc examination of RNA-seq edgeR QLF differential expression
  results, further supporting that fatty acid oxidation was increased. ψIncreased
  Acly mRNA expression as measured via RT-qPCR and decreased Acly promoter DNA methylation
  were associated with decreased acetyl-CoA levels at PND21, and increased ϕFasn promoter
  DNA methylation was associated with decreased acetyl-CoA levels at PND21
