caption: (A) Signaling pathways triggered by pathogen-associated molecular pattern
  (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). Lipopolysaccharide
  (LPS) activates both the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent and
  TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-dependent Toll-like receptor
  4 (TLR4) pathways. The MyD88-dependent pathway is responsible for NF-κB and mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) activation, which controls induction of proinflammatory cytokines.
  The TRIF-dependent pathway activates IRF3 by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/IKKε,
  which is required for the induction of IFN-inducible genes. TLR1-TLR2 and TLR2-TLR6
  recognize bacterial triacylated lipopeptide or diacyl lipopeptide, respectively,
  and recruit TIR adapter protein (TIRAP) and MyD88 at the plasma membrane to activate
  the MyD88-dependent pathway. TLR5 recognizes flagellin and activates the MyD88-dependent
  pathway. TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 reside in the endosome and recognize dsRNA,
  ssRNA, CpG DNA, or mitochondrial DNA (Mit DNA), respectively. They recruit TRIF
  or MyD88 to activate the IRF3 or IRF7 pathway. All immunogenic nucleic acids bind
  indicated cytosolic DNA sensors or RNA sensors, including retinoid acid-inducible
  gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), which are required for subsequent recognition
  by specific pattern recognition receptors to activate innate immune responses. DAMPs
  such as HMGB1, S100 proteins (S100s), and heat shock proteins (HSPs) recognize the
  receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), TLR4, or triggering receptor
  expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1) and activate the MyD88-MAPK-NF-κB pathway.
  HMGB1 and RAGE activate the TLR9-MyD88 dependent pathway, which contributes to autoimmune
  pathogenesis. CD24 is a negative receptor to inhibit the DAMP-induced TLR4 pathway.
  ATP binding of the P2X7 receptor and uric acid, as well as asbestos and alum, increase
  activation of caspase-1 by the NALP3 inflammasome and other nucleotide-binding oligomerization
  domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) to promote secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. PAMP
  and DAMP-mediated signaling and induction of an innate immune response usually results
  in resolution of infection, but may also cause chronic inflammation or autoimmunity
  by altering various cell death and survival mechanisms. (B) Mitochondria in mammalian
  cells are removed by autophagy via the NIX adapter during developmental elimination
  of mitochondria, or via PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (Pink1) and Parkin-mediated
  ubiquitination (Ub) of voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), recognized by
  the adapter p62 for removal of stressed (e.g., depolarized or damaged) mitochondria.
  (C) Intracellular bacteria exposed to the cytosol are modified by ubiquitin (Ub)
  and recognized by the autophagic adapters p62 or nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52)/TBK1
  for sequestration into autophagosomes and subsequent elimination.
