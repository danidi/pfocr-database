caption: 'A diagram indicating the simulation of the Map Kinase pathway under stimulation
  by EGF only (black starred line), Bacterial load only (red circled line) and both
  (blue triangled line). Bacterial load was held at 0.1 for the simulation. Each node
  represents the time-dependant concentration over 8 simulated hours and heights are
  scaled for visualization purposes. Interaction 1: GBR2-SOS-SHC causes GDP-RAS phosphorylation
  to GTP-RAS. Interaction 2: CagA forms a complex with SOS and GBR-2 to mis-activate
  RAS. Interaction 3a and 3b: Activated Raf and GTP-RAS bond to form an active RAS-RAF
  complex. Interaction 4: Active RAS-RAF complex activates mapKK. Interaction 5: Active
  mapKK activates mapK which leads to transcription of growth factors. Interaction
  6: CagA-Shp-2 complex mis-activates mapK. Interaction 7: Active mapK converts SOS
  to an inactivated form which attenuates the signal. The green arrows denote activation
  of molecules while red denotes deactivation.'
