caption: The schematic representation of physiological and pathological aspects (major
  sources of oxidative stress) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and their corresponding
  antioxidant defense approach by anthocyanin in cholinergic neurons. Mitochondrial
  abnormalities, advanced glycation end products (RAGE), redox-active metals (iron,
  copper and zinc), amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, and alterations in cell signaling
  pathways are major sources of Oxidative stress (OxS) in AD. In an amyloidogenic
  pathway, the generated neurotoxic Aβ40/42 peptides from integral membrane protein
  Amyloid precursor Protein (APP) after sequential cleavage by β and γ-secretase is
  aggregated and formed oligomers before plaque (extracellularly) and neurofibrillary
  tangles (intracellularly) formation. This results in the disruption of calcium homeostasis,
  blocked ion channels, mitochondrial dysfunction impairment of energy metabolism,
  and glial cell activation that ultimately leads to oxidative stress resulting in
  neuronal cell death. In contrast, in a non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is initially
  cleaved by α-secretase followed by further cleavage by γ-secretase excluding the
  possibility of Aβ generation and thus ROS production. Anthocyanin inhibited generated
  oxidative stress (OxS) in AD providing a neuro-protective effect. Abbreviations.
  BACE1, beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1; βCTF, Beta site intracellular carboxyl terminal
  fragment; AICD, amyloid intracellular domain; APP, Amyloid precursor protein, GFAP,
