caption: The model for the regulatory network integrating three candidate TFs (YiaJ,
  YdcI, and YeiE) and their biological functions in E. coli K-12 MG1655. (A) YiaJ
  is a regulator that controls the operon yiaK-yiaL-yiaM-yiaN-yiaO-lyxK-sgbH-sgbU-sgbE
  in the catabolism pathway. (B) YdcI inhibits the transcription of target gene gltA,
  resulting in the down-regulation of citrate synthase that is required in the TCA
  cycle. (C) YdcI binds to genomic DNA and activates target genes nhaA, dtpA, lldP,
  and gltP that are responsible for proton transfer. (D) YeiE affects multiple transporters
  (amino acids, inorganic ions, lipids) and metabolic processes, maintaining iron
  homeostasis at iron-limited conditions.
