caption: (A) TLR4 through TRIF signaling leads to IRF1 activation and IFN-I production,
  and these effects hamper the Th1 response to prevent immunopathology during L. infantum
  infection. (B) The absence of TLR4 signaling and IFN-I production contributes to
  the Th1 response and restricts parasite replication but causes immunopathology.
  In humans, the TLR4 and IFN-I pathways are positively modulated in asymptomatic
  subjects compared with VL patients, and this finding provides direct evidence that
  TLR4-IFN-I signaling is related to the prevention of the severe form of VL.
