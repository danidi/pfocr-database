caption: Schematic showing integration of inputs in the SIP syncytium. Schematic is
  developed from experimental evidence obtained from murine small intestine. SIP syncytium
  consists of SMCs, PDGFRα+ cells, and ICC (in small intestine the ICC are ICC-MY
  and ICC-IM; see  for additional details). ICC-MY are pacemaker cells and generate
  electrical slow waves by processes described in detail in  and depicted here as
  Ca2+ release from ER and activation of Ano1 channels in plasma membrane. Slow wave
  conduct through gap junctions (GJ) and depolarize SMCs. Depolarization activates
  Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels and initiates cross bridge cycling of contractile
  elements (CE). Slow waves are omnipresent, but their impact on SMC contraction is
  modulated by inputs from enteric excitatory (EEN) and inhibitory (EIN) neurons that
  are intermingled and closely associated with PDGFRα+ cells and ICC-IM. EENs release
  ACh and tachykinins (substance P and possibly neurokinin A). These neurotransmitters
  bind to muscarinic type 3 (M3) receptors and neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors expressed
  by ICC-IM. Both receptors couple through Gq/11 and activate phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ)
  and production of IP3 and diacylglycerol (not shown). IP3 binds to IP3Rs in the
  ER (not shown) and causes intense release of Ca2+ (depicted as multiple black arrows
  from ER) and activation of Ano1 channels in the plasma membrane. This is a depolarizing
  response that conducts to SMCs via GJs and summates with the slow waves that are
  ongoing in the syncytium. EINs release NO, purines (β-NAD), and peptides (depicted
  here as VIP but also likely to include PACAP). NO binds to soluble guanylyl cyclase
  (GCα/GCβ dimer) in ICC, SMCs, and possibly in PDGFRα+ cells (not shown) that also
  express these subunits but no response has been documented. GCα/GCβ dimers in ICC
  generate cGMP and activate protein kinase G (PKG) or inhibit phosphodiesterases
  (PDE). The mechanisms coupled to these effectors are not entirely understood. But
  PKG is linked to reduction in Ca2+ release from ER (dotted arrow), and this decreases
  or halts activation of Ano1 currents (X). This is a hyperpolarizing trend that can
  also conduct to SMCs via GJs. In SMCs GCα/GCβ dimers can also be activated by NO,
  causing reduced Ca2+ sensitization of the CE and reduction in the force of contraction.
  β-NAD (and possibly other purines) is/are released from EINs and bind to P2Y1 receptors
  on PDGFRα+ cells. This activates PLCβ, generates IP3, and causes Ca2+ release from
  ER. Ca2+ release activates small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels in PDGFRα+
  cells. This pathway generates strong hyperpolarization that conducts to SMCs via
  GJ. Hyperpolarization of SMCs tends to reduce the open probability of L-type Ca2+
  channels, restricting Ca2+ entry and reducing the force of contractions. Functions
  and responses of SIP cells to inhibitory peptides are not yet clarified

    SIP syncytium consists of SMCs, PDGFRα+ cells, and ICC (in small intestine the
