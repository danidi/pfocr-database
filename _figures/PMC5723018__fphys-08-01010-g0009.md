caption: Proposed model of how FKBP11 affects the formation and progression of AAD.
  In response to environmental stress (such as Ang II), FKBP11 expression was induced
  in endothelium of the dissected aorta and it could provoke the pro-inflammatory
  state of the endothelial cells by interacting with NF-kB p65 subunit and promoting
  its nuclear translocation, and the produced pro-inflammatory cytokines further facilitated
  the circulating monocytes transmigrating through the endothelium to the middle layer
  of the aorta, where they differentiated into active macrophages and secreted MMPs
  and other ECM degrading proteins, finally promoted the formation and progression
  of aortic dissection.
