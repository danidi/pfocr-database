caption: 'PharmGKB pathway diagrams. (A) The antiestrogen pathway: PK describes the
  hepatic metabolism of the drug tamoxifen (purple rectangle) to several primary and
  secondary metabolites (purple-yellow rectangles) by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes.
  Like tamoxifen, some of these metabolites exhibit antiestrogenic effects, indicated
  by arrows to the breast cancer cell. Along the arrows, the genes (blue ovals) are
  displayed, which code for the involved CYP isoforms. In the transformation to the
  potent antiestrogenic metabolite, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen, CYP2D6 plays a significant
  role, indicated by the star. A summary explaining the different shapes and colors
  used in the graphic is available through the “legend” link. (B) The antiestrogen
  pathway: PD displays genes (blue ovals) involved in the synthesis of estrogens (green
  ovals) and the effect of estrogens on downstream signals by binding to estrogen
  receptors. Aromatase inhibitors (purple rectangle) are a group of drugs that reduce
  the amount of estrogens by blocking their transformation from androgens, whereas
  selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERM) decrease the cellular effects of estrogens
  by binding to estrogen receptors in breast cells. The two drug groups are major
  pharmacological strategies in breast cancer therapy of estrogen receptor and/or
  progesterone receptor–positive breast tumors.'
