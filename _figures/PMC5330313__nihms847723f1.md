caption: Vitamin D can be obtained in the form of D3 from conversion of 7-dehydrocholestrol
  in the skin after exposure to UVB or in dietary forms of D2 or D3. D2 and D3 are
  then hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the liver. 25(OH)D circulates as the
  predominant storage form, with the majority bound to vitamin D binding protein (VDBP).
  Subsequently, the 25(OH)D is hydroxylated by the 1α hydroxylase in the kidney, converting
  it to the active 1,25(OH)2D. 1,25(OH)2D then circulates and binds to the vitamin
  D receptor (VDR) in various tissue cells including cardiovascular tissues which
  triggers cellular activity. Both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D can be catabolized with
  24-hydroxylase activity and ultimately excreted by the kidneys.
