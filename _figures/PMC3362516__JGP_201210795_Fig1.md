caption: Mitochondrial Ca2+ influx and efflux mechanisms. Schematic diagram of mitochondrial
  Ca2+ channels/transporters for influx and efflux mechanisms. The functional and
  morphological tight coupling of ER/SR (yellow) and mitochondria is attributed to
  the specific structure of inter-organelle tether proteins such as mito-fusion protein
  2 (gray) (; ). Ca2+-releasing sites of ER/SR, IP3 receptors (IP3R), or RyRs (RyR;
  green) are facing microdomains between mitochondria and ER/SR (shown as a pink region).
  Ca2+ release from ER/SR dramatically changes [Ca2+]c at this microdomain (; ). Then,
  mitochondria sense the high increases of [Ca2+]c at this microdomain, and [Ca2+]c
  propagates into the mitochondria matrix through a variety of Ca2+ channels/transporters
  (). Mitochondrial Ca2+ influx (upper part of this figure) is determined by the MCU
  (blue) (; ), RaM (black) (; ; ), HCX (Letm1; orange) (), mRyR1 (red) (, ), hydroxyl
  coenzyme Q10 (CoQs) (), mCa1 and mCa2 (), and UCP 2 and UPC 3 () located at the
  IMM. MICU1 can bind to Ca2+ by its EF hand, but this protein does not make the channel
  pore because of its single-transmembrane structure (). The mPTP (black) (), NCX
  (purple) (), and HCX (orange) () contribute to Ca2+ efflux (lower part of this figure)
  in mammalian cells. Drosophila mitochondria possess another selective Ca2+ release
  channel (DroCRC; black) with unique featured characteristics intermediate between
  the permeability transition pore of yeast and mammals (). Letm1 also works as a
  Ca2+ efflux pathway when [Ca2+]c becomes high () (see also  and ). Voltage-dependent
  anion-selective channels (VDAC; dark green) provide a pathway for Ca2+ and metabolite
  transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). The channels/transporters
  for which molecular identities are still unknown are shown as black. Red arrows
  show Ca2+ movements, and blue arrows show other ion movements.
