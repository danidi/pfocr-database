caption: C. neoformans Crk1 and Gat1 negatively regulated the expression of Mat2 to
  coordinately modulate sexual differentiation. Mat2 is a major transcription factor
  downstream the Cpk1-MAPK signaling pathway to regulate pheromone production and
  mating responses in C. neoformans. The protein kinase Crk1 negatively regulated
  MAT2 expression via phosphorylating Gat1 or other target(s) to reduce the MAT2 transcript
  level and repress pheromone production and other mating responses. The expression
  of CRK1 was possibly also regulated by Mat2. Crk1-Gat1 may form a regulatory circuit
  to properly regulate MAT2/Mat2 levels to control the progression of sexual filamentation
  and transition to basidium stage. We propose this model how Crk1 regulates pheromone
  production, elongation of dikaryotic filaments, and basidium formation during bisexual
  mating.
