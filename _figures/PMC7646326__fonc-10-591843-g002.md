caption: 'miRNA pathway: From biogenesis to mRNA inhibition. After pri-miRNA generation
  by transcription, the microprocessor complex Drosha processes and cleaves the pri-miRNA
  to produce the precursor-miRNA (pre-miRNA). Then, the pre-miRNA is transported from
  the nucleus to cytoplasm by Exportin 5. In the cytoplasm, pre-miRNA is processed
  by Dicer to produce the mature miRNA. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a protein
  complex termed RISC. Finally, this complex induces gene inhibition in two different
  ways. 1) The mRNA can be degraded if there is total complementation between the
  miRNA and the mRNA. 2) In the case of partial complementation, there is a translational
  repression.'
