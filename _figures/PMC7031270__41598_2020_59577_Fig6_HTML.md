caption: IPA generated networks of transcription factors and differentiation markers.
  (A,B) Custom IPA networks were generated from selected lists of keratinocyte differentiation
  markers and transcription factors shown by transcriptional analysis to be altered
  by arsenite and antimonite treatments. Molecules in green were decreased in the
  datasets with darker shades indicating more suppression. Molecules in pink were
  increased in the dataset. Blue lines are predicted to lead to inhibition and orange
  lines to activation. Yellow lines indicate findings opposite to predictions, while
  black lines indicate no prediction of activation or suppression. The networks were
  generated through the use of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis version 2018 (QIAGEN Inc.,
  https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/ingenuity-pathway-analysis).
