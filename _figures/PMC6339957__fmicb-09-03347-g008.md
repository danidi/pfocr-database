caption: 'Scheme of the SL biosynthetic pathway in fungi, SL intermediates and proposed
  model for YpkA activation in A. fumigatus. Dashed arrow indicates genetic interaction
  between MpkA and YpkA while solid red arrow indicates genetic and physical interaction
  between SakA and YpkA. Dotted arrow indicates the predicted uninvestigated role
  of PkhA or Tor in phosphorylating YpkA. Arrowhead indicates the optimal consensus
  phosphoacceptor motif for yeast Ypk1 [-R-x-R-x-x-S/T] fully conserved and located
  at the N-terminal region (cytosolic side) of A. fumigatus OrmA (Afu4g13270), a predicted
  target of YpkA and SPT inhibitor (; ). SPT, serine palmitoyl transferase; MYR, myriocin;
  ABA, aureobasidin (blocks the synthesis of IPC from either PCer or OH-PCer); P,
  kinase activity over YpkA. For SL intermediates abbreviations see Figure . Blue
  boxes with red border indicate common intermediates of neutral and acidic GSL, while
  blue boxes with green and black borders indicate exclusive intermediates of neutral
  or acidic GSL, respectively. Green dotted line represents the two enzymes necessary
  for GlcCer and GalCer production, i.e., Sld8 (which desaturates Cer and OH-Cer in
  position 8 of the sphingosine backbone) and Smt1 (which methylates the Δ8 Cer and
  Δ8-OH-Cer in position 9 of the sphingosine backbone). ∗Not measured (Figure ): 3-keto
  DHS, 3-keto dihydrosphingosine; GalCer, galactosylceramide; GIPCs, glycosylinositol
  phosphorylceramide.'
