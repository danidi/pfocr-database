number: Figure 1
caption: '(a) represents the list of events and differentiation pathways that progenitor
  cells undergo before transitioning into osteoblasts and, eventually, osteocytes.
  Of relevance to this investigation are events displayed in the centre, in which
  bone forms through intramembranous ossification. In endochondral ossification, the
  alternative pathway, hypertrophic chondrocytes have been indicated to differentiate
  into osteoblast-like cells. The figure was adapted from. In (b), the possible ways
  (hypotheses #1–4) of matrix deposition by osteoblasts, as presented in, are shown.
  The left column represent the situation before osteoblasts are trapped within the
  matrix. The arrows represent the direction of matrix deposition by osteoblasts.
  Black shaded cells represent the cells that will be entrapped within the matrix
  and the solid line represents the bone surface. The grey shaded cells in the right
  column indicate former osteoblasts that turn into osteocytes. (c) Agents are computer
  programs that are capable of detecting local information and initiate decision making
  based on a set of rule-set attributed to them at discrete time steps. In that sense,
  they act very much like a biological cell. In this frame, a parallel between an
  agent and a cell is shown. Based on the incoming cue (signalling molecule, architectural
  constraint, mechanical conditioning, etc.) both the agent and the cell end up changing
  their ‘state’ (to chemotaxis or differentiation, etc.), producing an output signal
  (autocrine or paracrine), and updating their memory (i.e. the new differentiated
  state, etc.). (b) was reproduced with kind permission from  © (2005) John Wiley
