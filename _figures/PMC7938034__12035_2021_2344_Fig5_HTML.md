caption: Crosstalk between NF-κB and Nrf2 pathways mediated by COVID-19 infection
  leading to neurological complications. (1) Enhanced oxidative stress/cytokine storm
  leads to activation of IKβ kinase, which causes phosphorylation of IkB-α, an NF-kB
  inhibitor, and results in proteasomal degradation of IkB-α. (2) NF-kB binds to its
  region, p65 subunit after migrating into the nucleus. p65 is an inhibitor of KEAP1.
  (3) This results in transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other genes
  such as TNF-α, Il-β, Il-6, iNOS, COX-2. (4) The NF-kB pathway and its contributing
  pro-inflammatory cytokines aggravate the oxidative state. (5) Oxidative stress leads
  to the activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway resulting in dissociation of Nrf2
  from its inhibitor Keap1. (6) It then causes translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus
  and associates with Maf protein and antioxidant response element (ARE). (7) Transcription
  of antioxidant genes and phase II enzymes such as NADPH, GSH, SOD, catalase, heme-oxygenase-1,
  and NQO1 occurs which inhibits ROS. (8) Overall, the genetic interventions and consequent
  transcription show positive implications of Nrf2 pathway in reducing oxidative stress.
  (9) COVID-19 infection induces oxidative stress. (10) Oxidative stress drives neurological
  complications. (11) Free Keap1 prevents degradation of IkB-α. (12) Inhibition of
  the NF-kB pathway
