caption: The heme biosynthetic pathway and experimental porphyria models. (A) Heme
  biosynthesis starts in mitochondria, where ALAS condenses glycine and succinyl Co-A
  to form the first committed metabolite of the pathway, ALA, that exits mitochondria
  through an unidentified transporter/channel to the cytosol. In the cytosol, 2 molecules
  of ALA are cyclized by porphobilinogen synthase (PBGS) to form the monopyrrole,
  porphobilinogen (PBG). Next, 4 molecules of PBG are joined by the hydroxymethylbilane
  synthase (HMBS) to form the linear tetrapyrrole, hydroxymethylbilane (HMB). Ring
  closure of HMB by uroporphyrinogen synthase (UROS) forms the first cyclic tetrapyrrole
  of the pathway, uroporphyrinogen III, which is decarboxylated by UROD to form coproporphyrinogen
  III. Coproporphyrinogen III enters the mitochondria through ABCB6, where it is oxidized
  by coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX) to protoporphyrinogen IX, which is further
  oxidized by protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX) to form PP-IX. In the last step of
  the pathway, FECH inserts Fe into the PP-IX molecule to form heme. Heme and PP-IX
  can be exported from mitochondria through the transporter FLVCR1b, and exported
  outside the cell by FLVCR1a, ,  and ABCG2/BRCP. In addition to heme and PP-IX, ABCG2/BRCP
  exports other cytosolic mono/tetrapyrroles including PBG, Uro, and Copro. (B) Summary
  of the experimental models used to study porphyria. (C) Mechanism of DDC-mediated
  disruption of the hepatic heme biosynthesis that leads to porphyrin accumulation
  and protein aggregation in mouse liver. DDC methylates hepatocyte heme to form NMP
  (a potent ferrochelatase inhibitor). Methylation of the nitrogen atom of the pyrrole
  ring disrupts the Fe coordination and free Fe is released. Heme depletion, in turn,
  activates ALAS by the removing the feedback inhibitory effect of heme on ALAS. Thus
  DDC through a combination of ferrochelatase inhibition (by NMP) and de-repressing
  ALAS (by decreasing heme levels), causes a buildup of porphyrins. In addition, hepatic
  inflammation-induced ROS including hypochlorous acid (HOCl) (from myeloperoxidase
  [MPO]) and superoxide (O–2) (from reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
  oxidase) react with free iron and generate (by the Fenton reaction) other potent
  oxidants, such as a hydroxyl radical (OH•), which oxidize proteins and subsequently
  lead to protein-porphyrin aggregate formation. Through these combined actions, DDC
  feeding leads to hepatic porphyrin accumulation and liver damage. Hepatic Cyp3A1
  metabolizes DDC to its inactive form DDCox, thereby diminishing the effect of DDC.
  β-catenin modulates DDC-mediated porphyrin accumulation, protein aggregation and
  liver damage by blocking Cyp3A1, thereby increasing the porphyrinogenic potency
  of DDC.
