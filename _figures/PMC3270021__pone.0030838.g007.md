caption: 'The dentate gyrus (left) is built from stem cells that develop to neuroblasts
  and type 2b progenitors that still can divide. These progenitors give rise to mature
  granule cells, connecting CA3 pyramidal neurons via mossy fibers. NF-κB signalling
  plays an important role at least in two of the processes that regulate the balance
  between degeneration and regeneration (tissue homeostasis) of the dentate gyrus.
  That is firstly axon formation and maturation from a immature type 2b neuronal progenitor
  (DCX+) to a mature granule cell neuron and secondly regulation of survival and energy
  balance of mature granule cells. yellow = cells with NF-κB on; blue = NF-κB ablated
  cells, NF-κB off. Right side, molecular mechanisms: Our results point to a cell
  autonomous mechanism by which NF-κB regulates axogenesis in newborn granule cells.
  Critically involved are the FOXO transcription factors and the bona fide NF-κB target
  gene PKA (Prkaca). A second role for NF-κB in mature granule cells is neuroprotection
  presumably transmitted by a PKA – phospho-CREB pathway. Ablation of NF-κB (NF-κB
  off) results in severe structural and behavioural defects described above.'
