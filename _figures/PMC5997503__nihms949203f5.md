caption: 'This figure is accompanied by , which lists the targeted receptors or enzymes,
  ligands or substrates/products, and signal pathways in platelets and the relevant
  drugs.Adhesion receptors, Platelet A: Adhesion molecules on platelets bind platelets
  to the vessel wall at sites of damaged endothelium, these interactions result in
  intracellular signaling, actin polymerization, and shape change in platelets. The
  key interactions are between Von Willebrand factor (VWF) in the subendothelium and
  Glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex and integrin αIIbβ3 on platelets, and between
  collagen in the in the subendothelium and GPVI and integrin α2β1. Focal adhesion
  kinase (FAK) facilitates GPVI binding to collagen. Tumor cell mucins interact with
  P-selectin on platelets, E-selectin on endothelial cells and L-selectin on leukocytes.
  Eicosanoid Pathway, Resting Platelet: Prostacylin (PGI2) activates Gαs-protein coupled
  receptor (IP) on platelets that stimulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)
  production by adenylate cyclase (AC) and prevents aggregation. Eicosanoid Pathway,
  Platelet B: One key platelet prostaglandin is the potent pro-aggregatory (TX)A2
  synthesized by TXA2 synthase (TXAS) from PGG2 and then PGH2 that in turn are generated
  by cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) from arachidonic acid. TXA2 stimulates G-protein coupled
  TP receptors. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) in cancer cells generates prostaglandin
  E2 (PGE2) that activates EP1 and EP3 receptors on platelets stimulating calcium
  release. Another abundant eicosanoid produced from arachidonic acid is 12(S)-HETE
  [12-(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid] via the activity of platelet-type lipoxygenase
  (p12-LOX). Tumor cell podoplanin interacts with platelet C-type lectin domain family
  2 (CLEC-2). GPCR, Platelet C: Platelet activation occurs through protease-activated
  receptors (PAR1 and 4) via Tissue factor (TF)-Factor VII-Factor X-mediated thrombin
  production. ADP (adenosine diphosphate) released from cancer cells and from dense
  granules of platelets stimulates P2Y1 or P2Y12 receptors. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine)
  is also released from dense granules that act through 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors
  (5HT2AR).'
