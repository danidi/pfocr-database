caption: All phospholipid subclasses are derived from phosphatidic acid via a variety
  of synthetic pathways. Phosphatidylcholine is synthesized via two pathways. The
  major pathway is the Kennedy pathway and involves the addition of CDP-choline to
  the phosphatidic acid derivative diacylglycerol. Phosphatidylcholine can also be
  synthesized through the action of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT),
  which converts phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylethanolamine
  is also synthesized via the Kennedy pathway, where the multifunctional enzymes catalyze
  the addition of CDP-ethanolamine to diacylglycerol. Phosphatidylethanolamine can
  also be synthesized by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase. Phosphatidylserine is synthesized
  from CDP-diacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine via phosphatidylserine
  synthase. Phosphatidylinositol is derived from the CDP-diacylglycerol by phosphatidylinositol
  synthase. Phosphatidylglycerol is synthesized from CDP-diacylglycerol via a multistep
  process involving phosphatidylglycerol phosphate synthase, and phosphatidylglycerol
  phosphate phosphatase. Cardiolipin can then be synthesized from phosphatidylglycerol
  via cardiolipin synthase.
