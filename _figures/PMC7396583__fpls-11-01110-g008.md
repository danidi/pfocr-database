caption: The model illustrating potential regulation mechanism of membrane lipid metabolism
  in peanut cold tolerance. The glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid and fatty acid metabolic
  pathways were the significant pathways altering in response to peanut cold tolerance,
  which were depicted as fully as possible based on the integration of lipidomic and
  transcriptomic responses. The red boxes represent the increased metabolites and
  the green boxes represent the decreased metabolites. Except the genes (green words)
  involved in fatty acid elongation (③), all the genes in this figure were up-regulated.
  Besides to alter membrane lipid composition and membrane lipid remodeling, lipid
  classes can also adapt to cold stress through other metabolic processes. For example,
  accumulated PI can activate the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, further
  increased the concentration of Ca2+ and activated the Ca2+ channel to regulate the
  expression of downstream cold-tolerant genes (①). The storage lipid TAG can be hydrolyzed
  by PLA2 to produce the FFA and leading to the activation of fatty acid degradation
  and fatty acid elongation pathways. The fatty acid degradation may provide enough
  energy for peanut to adapt to cold stress, as well as produce more polyunsaturated
  short-chain fatty acids to maintain the membrane fluidity (②). The fatty acid elongation
  may be related to the biosynthesis of plant wax, while the explicit mechanism needs
  to be further studied (③). Also, the structural lipids may be degraded under cold
  stress and synthesize the JA through α-linolenic acid metabolism and β-oxidation
  of fatty acid, then to activate the JA signal transduction that may regulate the
  stomatal closure and maintain the photosynthesis, but this hypothesis needs to be
  further validated in peanut (④). ACAA1, acetyl-CoA acyltransferase; ACOX1, acyl-CoA
