caption: Schematic showing that Src promotes cap-dependent translation of Myc protein
  via activation of ERK1/2-MNK1-eIF4E pathway leading to GLUT1 expression, which in
  turn enhances glucose uptake by premalignant cells by controlling several metabolic
  pathways, such as glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway that contribute to
  premalignant cells growth.
