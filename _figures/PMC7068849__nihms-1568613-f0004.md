caption: C. albicans is a dimorphic commensal fungus that colonizes the human oral
  cavity. In health, this organism is found mainly in an avirulent yeast form, and
  triggers little or no immune activity in the oral mucosa. Upon conversion to a hyphal
  state, C. albicans exposes β-glucans in the cell wall that activate the Dectin-1/CARD9
  pathway in APCs. APCs consequently secrete Th17-skewing cytokines such as IL-1,
  IL-6, and IL-23, driving IL-17 production from antigen-specific Th17 cells. Hyphae
  also secrete the peptide candidalysin, which damages oral epithelial cells and triggers
  secretion of DAMPs such as IL-1 and IL-36. These signals activate innate IL-17-producing
  cells. IL-17 binds to its receptor on oral epithelial cells and induces antimicrobial
  effectors, including CXC chemokines and G-CSF that promote a neutrophil response
  and β-defensins that have direct fungicidal activity.
