  the binding of dsDNA / cGAS, thus attenuating the underlying activation of the STING
  pathway mediated by cGAMP. (8) Cytosolic RNA is recognized by RIG-I, the signal
  is transferred to MAVS, then to subsequent interactors leading to expression of
  IFN-I. CQ/HCQ may impair this process. (9 and 10) The release of IFNα, among other
