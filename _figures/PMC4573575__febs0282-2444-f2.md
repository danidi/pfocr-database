caption: 'The pathway of meiotic recombination. Copies of homologous chromosomes are
  represented in red and blue. HR proceeds by two pathways: synthesis-dependent strand
  annealing (SDSA) and double-strand break repair (DSBR). While SDSA only produces
  non-crossovers, the second DSB end is captured during DSBR. After DNA synthesis
  and ligation, Holliday junctions are formed whose resolution results in formation
  of mostly crossovers and a small proportion of non-crossovers. Formation of both
  crossovers and non-crossovers between homolog chromatids is shown. Although use
  of the homologous chromatids is favored during meiotic recombination, final genetic
  products of recombination may also be generated using sister chromatids as DNA repair
  templates.'
