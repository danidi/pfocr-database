caption: The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. Intermediate compounds and enzymes in
  the pathway are shown with mutant alleles represented in brackets. The structures
  of naringenin and quercetin are shown, and downstream products are represented at
  the bottom of the diagram. Enzymes, mutants, and metabolites central to this study
  are shown in boldface. This figure is modified from .
