caption: Schematic representation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways
  in skeletal muscle. The three transmembrane proteins, PERK, IRE1α, and ATF6, are
  inactive when bound by BiP, also called GRP78. Due to the accumulation of misfolded
  proteins, GRP78/BiP disassociate from these proteins and preferentially binds to
  these proteins in the lumen of the ER. No longer inactivated by GRP78/BiP, PERK
  auto-phosphorylates causing phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor
  eIF2α and translation of the mRNA encoding ATF4, a potent transcription factor,
  which in turn can activate its transcriptional targets. One of these targets encodes
  GADD34, a phosphatase involved in the negative feedback control of this pathway,
  which allows a return to a physiological translational state. Another ER transmembrane
  sensor, IRE1α, is also activated by autophosphorylation during ER stress. When active,
  IRE1α catalyzes the unconventional splicing of a 26-base intron from XBP1 mRNA through
  its endoribonuclease activity, which generates the highly active transcription factor
  transcription factor sXBP1, as well as phosphorylates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK).
  Lastly, once disassociated from GRP78/BiP, the membrane-bound ATF6 is released and
  traffics from the ER to the Golgi apparatus where it undergoes two sequential proteolytic
  cleavages, mediated by the site-1 and site-2 proteases (S1P and S2P). The cleaved
  cytosolic N-terminal fragment of ATF6 (ATF6N) translocates to the nucleus where
  it acts in combination with sXBP1 and ATF4 to alleviate ER stress by regulating
  gene expression and protein synthesis.
