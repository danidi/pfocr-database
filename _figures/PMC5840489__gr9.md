caption: Schematic representation of proposed substance P (SP)-miR-31-3p signaling
  pathway in human colonic epithelial cells. After binding to the neurokinin-1 receptor
  (NK-1R), SP stimulates miR-31-3p by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in
  human colonic epithelial cells. miR-31-3p regulates inflammation by down-regulating
  RhoA expression.
