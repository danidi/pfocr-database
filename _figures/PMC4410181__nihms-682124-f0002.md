caption: A, T cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 costimulatory signals are important for
  induction of Foxp3. Downstream of the TCR-CD28 signal, the NFκB pathway via PDK1,
  PKC-θ, the BCL-10, MALT1, CARMA1 complex and IKK is critical for Foxp3 expression
  in the thymus, whereas CREB, NFAT, and AP1 have been demonstrated to bind to regulatory
  DNA elements at the Foxp3 locus. In contrast to thymic differentiation of Treg cells,
  weaker TCR-CD28 signals appear to favor peripheral induction of Foxp3, as evidenced
  by increased induction of Foxp3 among peripheral naïve CD4 T cells with early withdrawal
  of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, and reduced CD28 signaling. TCR and CD28 signaling together
  with IL-2 and TGF-β are likely important for the survival and proliferation of Treg
  cell precursors in addition to their putative direct effects on Foxp3 expression.
  STAT5, activated downstream of the IL-2 receptor, binds to the promoter and an intronic
  regulatory DNA element within the Foxp3 locus and may have a role in transcriptional
  regulation of Foxp3. TGF-β dependent synergistic binding of NFAT and Smad to conserved
  non-coding sequence 1 (Foxp3-CNS1) is important for the peripheral induction of
  Foxp3. Transcription of the Foxp3 gene is likely dependent on other regulatory DNA
  elements in addition to the Foxp3 promoter. Foxp3-CNS2 may function in the stable
  maintenance of Foxp3 expression. This function of CNS2 is dependent on demethylation
  of the CpG island located at this region, indicating that methyl-sensitive transcription
  factor binding likely mediates stable expression of Foxp3. Some in vitro generated
  iTreg cells and activated human CD4 T cells only transiently express Foxp3 perhaps
  due to a heavily methylated state at CNS2. Permissive chromatin modifications such
  as methylation of histone 3 at lysine residue 4 (H3K4me) and acetylation of histone
  3 (H3Ac) at the promoter and CNS1 associate with active transcription of Foxp3,
  while CNS2 chromatin is only found in a permissive state, with demethylated CpG
  motifs, in mature Treg cells that stably express Foxp3. The maintenance DNA methyltransferase
  I (DNMT1) likely represses Foxp3 expression through the propagation of methylation
  marks on CpG dinucleotides at CNS2.Receptors and extracellular signals are represented
  in yellow boxes and signaling intermediates and transcription factors in green.
  Regulatory DNA elements are highlighted in yellow. Grey boxes with green dotted
  outlines contain factors thought to be specifically important for peripheral Foxp3
  induction.
