caption: Schematic representation of the signaling cascade for neuronal degeneration,
  on the basis of the neuroimmunomodulation theory (12). Activation of microglia is
  followed by a release of pro-inflammatory mediators that finally promotes tau hypephosphorylation
  and its aggregation into PHF. Tau release from degenerated neurons triggers microglial
  reactivation, thus generating a vicious cycle in the pathway to degeneration of
  neuronal cells in pathological processes like Alzheimer’s disease and tauopathies.
