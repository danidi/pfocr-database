caption: A proposed model depicting the possible mechanism underlying hydrogen/GSDMD-
  mediated cell pyroptosis in endometrial cancer. Hydrogen triggers the activation
  of ROS/NLPR3 signaling, which enables caspase-1 activation. GSDMD is cleaved off
  the suppressor C-terminal domain of the protein and liberates the pore-forming N-terminal
  domain of GSDMD, which then self-assembles to form pores in the plasma membrane
  that we call “hydrogen channels.” This then regulates the precursor of the proinflammatory
  cytokine IL-1β into its active form, mature IL-1β. These inflammatory genes constitute
  an inflammatory microenvironment in which to modulate cellular pyroptosis
