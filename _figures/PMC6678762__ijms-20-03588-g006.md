caption: Schematic diagram illustrating the proposed SIRT1 signaling pathway involved
  in PGC1α/mitochondrial biogenesis that exerted an endogenous protective mechanism
  in the hippocampal neuronal tissue following experimental status epilepticus. Excitotoxicity
  induced by experimental status epilepticus may activate SIRT1 expression that can
  lead to the deacetylation (Ac) of PGC-1α by SIRT1 and induce mitochondrial biogenesis
  machinery expression in hippocampal neuronal cells. Downregulation of SIRT1 by Sirt1
  gene knockdown decreased mitochondrial biogenesis machinery expression, which was
  accompanied by impaired mitochondrial respiratory function, increased protein oxidation,
  and raised the apoptotic process and neuronal damage.
