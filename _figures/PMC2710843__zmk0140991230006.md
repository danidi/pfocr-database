caption: 'DNA replication checkpoint pathways in different organisms. DNA replication
  block-induced response pathway, including sensors and transducers, is conserved
  from yeast to humans. Components of the pathway (circles) on the same line are sequence
  orthologues believed to perform the same function. Dashed circles represent potential
  components yet to be directly linked to the response pathway. In the three fungi,
  MCB elements found at DNA replication checkpoint cascade components are marked by
  a black star: a single star for a MCB element and two stars for MCB-tandem motif.
  Periodically transcribed subunits are colored according to their approximate time
  of peak expression (bottom) or in gray if they are constitutively expressed.'
