caption: DAPK1 can be activated by various factors, such as cellular stress and growth
  signaling. In p53-WT cells, DAPK1 can activate p53, leading to p53 target gene transcription
  and apoptosis under death-related signaling. Simultaneously, DAPK1 can regulate
  cell growth by modulating TSC1/TSC2 complex formation in the mTOR pathway. Phosphorylation
  of TSC2 at Ser939 by DAPK1 reduces interaction between TSC1 and TSC2, leading to
  increased cell growth and protein synthesis and thereby maintaining a homeostatic
  balance between survival and death signaling. In contrast, DAPK1 expression is elevated
  in p53-mutant cells. The dysfunction of p53 in these cells prevents DAPK1 from inducing
  apoptosis, thereby resulting in a shift of function from apoptosis toward activation
  of the growth pathways. Therefore, in p53-mutated cells, suppression of DAPK1 strongly
  suppresses tumor cell growth.
