caption: Cellular receptors trigger the autophagy following the classic 4 stages,
  as described in the text. Alcohol exposure triggers autophagy. Alcohol and/or its
  metabolites inhibit the mTOR pathway thus releasing its inhibition of autophagy.
  The effect of alcohol on protein in the final stages of autophagy, namely autophagosome-lysosome
  fusion, and on catabolism of cargo proteins is still unclear. The existence of alcohol-induced
  mitophagy is unknown. The effect of alcohol on receptor-initiated autophagy and
  their downstream signaling pathways remain largely unexplored. Known effects are
  depicted with lines and arrows; unknowns are depicted with “?” sign; the up- and
  down-regulation is depicted by the orientation of the arrows.
