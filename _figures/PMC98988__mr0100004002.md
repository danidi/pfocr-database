caption: Mosquito immune responses to pathogens include melanotic encapsulation, phagocytosis,
  and production of antibacterial compounds and immune peptides. The hemocyte is a
  multifaceted cell that is probably involved in pathogen recognition, cell signaling,
  production of enzymes and immune system-associated molecules (e.g., transferrin),
  and phagocytosis. Invasion by bacteria results in phagocytosis by hemocytes and
  in the production of antibacterial compounds. If the pathogen is too large to be
  phagocytosed (e.g., filarial worms), mosquito hemocytes may recognize the pathogen
  as foreign and recruit other hemocytes to participate in the melanization response.
  Activated hemocytes also produce transferrin, which is a melanization-associated
  molecule, and a prophenoloxidase (ProPO), which is activated by a serine protease
  to become phenoloxidase (PO). After a phenoloxidase-catalyzed hydroxylation of tyrosine,
  other enzymes like dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and dopachrome conversion enzyme (DCE)
  catalyze other critical steps, ultimately resulting in melanin production. Also
  depicted is a proposed pathway for immune system peptide production. This pathway
  is probably induced when hemocytes recognize a foreign pathogen and relay a signal
  to the fat body, where signaling pathways, like Toll, IMD, and IRD, are activated
  by a serine protease. Following transcriptional activation, the fat body then produces
  defensin, cecropin, and proline-rich and glycine-rich peptides that have antimicrobial
  activity. Although the humoral immune response of mosquitoes does depend upon the
  fat body for immune system peptide production, other tissues, such as the midgut
  and salivary glands, do transcribe immune system peptides following activation by
  a pathogen ().
