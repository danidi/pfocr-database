caption: A cellular model of insulin (and leptin) signaling via TRPC5 channel activation
  in POMC neurons. Based on the current findings and other published data, we propose
  that insulin signals via IRS-PI3K to activate TRPC5 channels in POMC neurons, which
  generates a robust inward cationic current to depolarize POMC neurons and increase
  their excitability. Similarly, leptin binding to its receptor (LRb) triggers the
  recruitment of the tyrosine kinase Janus kinase (JAK) 2, leading to the activation
  of the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway
  and simultaneously activation of PI3K, which also activates TRPC5 channels (, ).
  PI3K (p85/p110) will also accelerate the rapid insertion of TPRC5 channels into
  the plasma membrane (). With DIO (hyperleptinemia), there is an increase in Socs3
  mRNA expression in POMC neurons in males but not in females, which induces insulin
  resistance by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of InsR and the interaction
  of IRS proteins with InsR. However, under physiological stress and in the absence
  of E2, STIM1 interacts with TPRC5/Cav3.1 channels, thereby engaging these Ca2+ channels
  as store-operated channels (inset), which are activated with ER depletion of Ca2+
  (). However, under physiological conditions in cycling females, E2 downregulates
  the expression of STIM1 (see ) and prevents the phosphorylation of STIM1, thereby
  converting the TRPC5/Cav3.1 signaling complex to receptor-operated (i.e., InsR)
  channels in POMC neurons (inset). PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase-1.
