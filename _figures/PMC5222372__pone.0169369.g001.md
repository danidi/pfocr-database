number: Fig 1
caption: The roundish rectangle represents an E. coli cell. Two complementary systems
  for protein lipoylation in E. coli are shown. Exogenous lipoic acid or octanoic
  acid is transferred to unlipoylated apo proteins in an ATP-dependent manner by LplA.
  The second E. coli pathway requires LipB to transfer endogenously synthesized octanoic
  acid to apo proteins, which then becomes the substrate for sulfur insertion by LipA.
  The carboxyl group of octanoic acid and lipoic acid is linked to the ε-amino group
  of a specific lysine residue of the lipoyl domain of the E2 subunit.
