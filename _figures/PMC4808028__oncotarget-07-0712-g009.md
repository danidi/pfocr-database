caption: The p90RSK encoded by RSK1 or RSK2 is activated downstream the RAS-ERK/MAPK
  pathway, which could be activated by growth factor, such as HGF that stimulates
  the Met tyrosine kinase receptor. Activated RSK1/RSK2 kinases drive the phosphorylation
  of the transcription factor YB-1, which then promotes TGFβ mRNA translation and
  FN-1 gene transcription. FN secreted by ovarian cancer cells increases α5β1 integrin
  activation and enhances tumour cell adhesion, motility, and invasion. Furthermore,
  ligand-bound integrins stretch FN fibrils and promote the mechanical release of
  TGFβ from the complex composed of LTBP1 and LAP, which maintains the growth factor
  in a FN-bound latent form. In turn, activated TGFβ promotes FN-1 gene transcription,
  giving rise to a positive feedback loop.
