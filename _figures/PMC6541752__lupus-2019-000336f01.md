caption: Comparison of nucleic acid signalling pathways leading to type I interferon
  (IFN) production in an autoimmune disease and bacterial infection. (A) In vitro
  model of Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Mutations in antiviral genes, including three-prime
  repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), can cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, an autosomal
  recessive progressive inflammatory disorder. TREX1-deficient human neurons accumulate
  long interspersed element-1 (L1) ssDNA, which is produced by the reverse transcription
  of L1 retrotransposon transcripts. L1 ssDNA stimulates the cGAS-STING pathway, resulting
  in the production of neurotoxic IFN. Neurotoxicity could be blocked by reverse transcriptase
  inhibitors (RTis) and IFN-α receptor (IFNAR) blockers. Reprinted with permission
  from Elsevier and Thomas CA, et al. (B) Type I IFN induction through alternative
  pathways during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Mycobacterial (Mtb) infection
  results in the production of microbial products and products associated with mitochondrial
  stress that stimulate pattern recognition receptors, including TLR4, NOD2 and cGAS,
  to activate type I IFN gene transcription (adapted from Moreira-Teixeira et al []).

  IFN regulatory factor; STING, stimulator of IFN gene; TLR, toll-like receptor.
