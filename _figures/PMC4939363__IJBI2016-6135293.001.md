caption: 'The simplified synthetic pathway of ALA-induced PpIX. ALA is an endogenous
  substance. It is incorporated into the mitochondria, repeatedly transported between
  the cytoplasm and the mitochondria, and finally used for heme synthesis. ALA is
  converted into porphobilinogen by the enzyme ALA dehydratase, and porphobilinogen
  is sequentially converted into hydroxymethylbilane, uroporphyrinogen III, coproporphyrinogen
  III, protoporphyrinogen IX, and finally PpIX by the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase.
  The final product heme is synthesized from PpIX and iron (Fe) by the enzyme ferrochelatase
  (FeC). This biosynthetic pathway is considered to be the same in all organisms (PENTA:
  pentacarboxyl porphyrin, COPRO I or III: coproporphyrin I or III, and HARDERO: harderoporphyrin).'
