caption: nNOS S1412 phosphorylation promotes enteric neuron NO signaling during low
  frequency depolarization. High frequency EFS (Right) promotes Ca2+ channel opening,
  which increases NO production via Ca2+/CaM dependent nNOS activation (thick arrows).
  Low frequency EFS (Left) slightly depolarizes nitrergic neurons, which activates
  Akt to phosphorylate nNOS S1412 and increase NO production (thick arrows). This
  pathway is independent of classical Ca2+/CaM activation. Regardless of nNOS stimulation,
  NO relaxes smooth muscle via a common final pathway in enteric myocytes by increasing
  cGMP synthesis. Through unknown mechanisms, NO bioavailability regulates PDE5 expression
  to modulate NO responses in smooth muscle cells. Thick or thin black pathway lines
  denote major and minor mechanisms of NO production. Dotted line represents unknown
  mechanisms.
