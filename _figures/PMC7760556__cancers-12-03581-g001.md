caption: 'Possible pathways for immunogenic activation in response to autologous iPSCs-whole
  cell vaccines. In the indirect pathway (1), endogenous APCs uptake antigens in the
  patient’s body. The expression of HSPs in iPSCs is likely to promote cross-presentation
  by APCs (e.g., DCs) which are able to capture and process antigens, converting proteins
  to peptides that are presented on MHC molecules. This is followed by specific binding
  of a TCR on T cells in draining lymph nodes to its cognate peptide-MHC complex displayed
  on an APC-like, macrophages or DCs. Two signals are required for T-cell activation.
  Binding between the MHC/peptide complex on the APC and the TCR for antigen on the
  T cell is the first signal. The second signal is provided when co-stimulatory molecules
  (e.g., CD40 or CD80/86 on the APCs and CD40L or CD28 on T cells, respectively) are
  ligated. In the direct pathway (2), iPSCs express low levels of MHC class I and
  can directly present peptides to CD8+ T cells without the need of APCs. Still, cytokines
  secreted by activated T cells are necessary as recognition of antigen alone is insufficient
  to induce full activation of naïve CD8+ T cells. As a result of T-cell activation,
  the APCs or T cells secrete cytokines that drive lineage differentiation into effector
  killing cytotoxic T cells that can lead to tumor regression (3). Abbreviations:
  APCs, antigen-presenting cells; DCs, dendritic cells; iPSC, induced pluripotent
  stem cell; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T-cell receptor; HSPs, heat
  shock proteins. This figure was created using Servier Medical Art templates, which
