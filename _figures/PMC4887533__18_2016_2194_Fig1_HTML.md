caption: Overview of the ferroptosis pathway. In many cells, cystine (Cys2) import
  via system  is required for glutathione synthesis, and the function of glutathione
  peroxidase 4 (GPX4). GPX4 activity prevents the accumulation of lipid ROS that are
  lethal to the cell. Treatment blocks cystine uptake, ultimately depleting the cell
  of glutathione and inhibiting the function of GPX4. Direct inhibition of the rate-limiting
  glutathione synthetic enzyme glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) using buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine
  (BSO) can also lead to the same iron- and ROS-dependent ferroptotic phenotype. Other
  small molecule inducers of ferroptosis are indicated in  red, while suppressors
  of ferroptosis are in  blue. GCL Glutamate cysteine ligase, GSS glutathione synthetase, Cys
  cysteine, Glu glutamate, Gly glycine, Gln glutamine. α-KG alpha-ketoglutarate, GPNA
  l-g-glutamyl-p-nitroanilide, AOA amino oxyacetate, BHA butylated hydroxyanisole,
