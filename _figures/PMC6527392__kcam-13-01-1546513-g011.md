caption: Atypical PKCs control actin cytoskeleton via Cofilin activation. The Cofilin
  pathway is activated by atypical PKC via Slingshot, SSH. Phosphorylated Cofilin
  at serine-3 is inactive. Phosphatases such as SSH induces the dephosphorylation
  and activation of Cofilin. Activated Cofilin can then sever the mother filaments
  and produced free barbed ends leading to the elongation of newly formed actin filaments
  which are preferred for dendritic nucleation by ARP2/3 complex and globular actin.
  These newly formed structures push on the cell membrane to promote protrusion and
  motility.
