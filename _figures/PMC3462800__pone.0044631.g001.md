caption: For each pathway, P, select genes in P (ovals at left) and not in P (squares
  in middle). Calculate a Pearson correlation coefficient between all gene expressions
  and each SOM GI50 profile (designated as ‘drug’ in the central square). Use a Kruskal-Wallis(K-W)
  statistic to determine if the rankings of the pathway genes (ovals at left) versus
  non-pathway genes (squares in the middle) are significantly skewed towards extreme
  values. The H-score for each pathway is derived from the K-W statistic. Cases where
  the average of correlations associated with pathway genes is greater than the average
  of correlations for non-pathway genes characterize positive H-scores. Positive and
  significant (p<0.05) H-scores reflect pathways with coordinated (as opposed to random)
  gene expression-chemoactivity correlations. H-scores for each pathway (n = 2160)
  are determined for all SOM GI50 profiles (n = 1998).
