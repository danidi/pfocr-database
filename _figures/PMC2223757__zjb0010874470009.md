caption: 'A workable model linking carbon catabolite regulation of social behaviors
  (gliding, sporulation, and toxin production) with disease progression in C. perfringens.
  In this hypothetical but realistic scenario, toxigenic, vegetative C. perfringens
  cells that reach the lumen of a human or animal gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where
  the basal luminal concentrations of glucose are normally lower than 0.5% (), have
  the possibility of undergoing at least two different differentiation pathways: sporulation
  and/or gliding development. In the first case, the activation of the key transcription
  factor Spo0A by inorganic phosphate (Pi) present in the intestinal lumen triggers
  spore morphogenesis and enterotoxin (CPE) production (). In the case of gliding
  development (left), unknown signals that might be linked to cell-cell and cell-surface
  interactions (double arrows) orchestrate the spatial and temporal organization of
  the cells to the onset of gliding. The progression of either developmental program
  (sporulation or gliding) would not exclude the occurrence of the other alternative
  pathway: sporulation and CPE production would take place in the lumen of the GI
  tract while gliding motility and vegetative toxin synthesis (i.e., collagenase production)
  would take place in association with the intestinal mucosa. The key role of glucose
  (representing the occurrence of CcpA-mediated carbon catabolite regulation when
  the level of the sugar is at least 1%) as a repressor of sporulation (, ) and gliding
  (this study) development is indicated. This regulatory blockage derives from the
  inhibition of enterotoxin (, ) and vegetative-linked toxin (, ) production in Clostridium
  spp. The novel role of CcpA as an activator of sporulation () and gliding proficiency
  (this study) is also shown. The development of inhibitors (e.g., monosaccharide
  analogs) that block the onsets of gliding and/or sporulation or antagonists that
  interfere with the positive role of CcpA on toxin production would contribute to
  combating the outbreak and dissemination of clostridial diseases.'
