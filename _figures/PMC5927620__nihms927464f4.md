caption: Glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway are fueled by glucose and generate
  biosynthetic intermediates, reducing equivalents, and ATP. Mitochondria are fueled
  by pyruvate, amino acids, and lipids, performing both anabolic and catabolic metabolism
  to generate energy. Serine, glycine, and folate-mediated one carbon metabolism are
  active in both cytosol and mitochondrial compartments. These pathways are connected
  orthogonally via cofactors and other disease- or tissue-specific pathways; as such,
  pathways beyond central carbon metabolism must be investigated in specific biological
  contexts.
