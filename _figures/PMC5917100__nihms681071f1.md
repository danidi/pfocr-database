caption: Autophagy is initiated when a signal is sent, through the Beclin 1 complex
  and other signaling complexes, to convert the cellular LC3 protein from its non-lipidated
  LC3-I form to phosphotidylamine-conjugated LC3-II. The newly lipidated LC3-II localizes
  to cup-shaped Pre-Autophagosomal Structures (PAS), and is required for the PAS to
  self-fuse into double-membraned autophagosomes with cytosolic contents. Autophagosomes
  fuse with endosomes, which provide vacuolar ATPases and promote acidification of
  the newly formed vesicle, termed an amphisome. Acidic amphisomes fuse with lysosomes,
  delivering proteases for degradation of internal contents. LC3-II is recycled to
  LC3-I, so it is difficult to monitor flux through the pathway using LC3 lipidation.
  The autophagic cargo adapter p62/SQSTM1 directly interacts with LC3, which directs
  its localization to PAS. LC3-I and LC3-II can be distinguished by western blot,
  but the recycling pathway makes it difficult to use LC3-II levels to monitor autophagy.
  However, lower steady state levels of p62 indicate higher levels of active autophagic
  degradation. Many of the known virus-encoded activators of autophagic signaling,
  and in some cases active autophagy, are listed, although the mechanisms of activation
  are poorly understood. Many other viruses induce autophagic signaling, but the specific
  proteins which provide the signal are unknown. Several viruses are known to inhibit
  either autophagic signaling, or autophagic maturation, as shown. HSV-1 US11 protein
  inhibits autophagic signaling through inhibition of PKR. HSV-1 ICP34.5, KSHV orf16,
  and MHV-68 M11 inhibit autophagosome formation by binding to the Beclin 1 autophagy
  signaling molecule. Influenza A, CVB3, HPIV3, and EBV induce autophagosomes, but
  block autophagosome maturation and autophagic degradation. Influenza M2 protein
  binds to LC3 to inhibit amphisome formation. The HPIV3-encoded P protein binds to
  SNAP29, inhibiting endosome-autophagsome fusion. In the case of CVB3, the virus
  requires host BPIFB3 to inhibit vesicle maturation.
