caption: In our study, we showed that photosensitization of A2E (which is a byproduct
  of the visual cycle) accelerates RPE senescence by increasing DNA damage, especially
  telomere deprotection and deletion. Photosensitization of A2E changed the gene expression
  profile in RPE cells and significantly increased the expression of SASP genes through
  the NF-κB pathway. We conclude that photosensitization of A2E triggers SASP gene
  expression in RPE cells, which may affect the microenvironment of the retina and
  surrounding cells, contributing to age-related retina degeneration diseases, such
  as AMD
