caption: Schematic presentation of synthesis and maturation of BDNF. BDNF synthesis
  and maturation is a multistage sequence of intra- and extracellular processes. In
  the intracellular pathway, the pre-pro-BDNF precursor sequence is produced in the
  endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the Golgi apparatus. In the course of intracellular
  cleavage, the pre-region sequence is removed, resulting in formation of immature
  proneurotrophin isoform of BDNF (pro-BDNF). Further, after removal of the pro-domain
  sequence, the mature isoform of BDNF (m-BDNF) is produced. Intracellular cleavage
  leading to formation of m-BDNF also occurs in intracellular vesicles, allowing transport
  of this neurotrophin to axonal terminals and subsequent release into the extracellular
  space, via presynaptic membrane. Processing of BDNF is accomplished by intracellular
  proteases, regulated convertases, and furin. As a result, both pro-BDNF and m-BDNF
  isoforms are released into the extracellular space. In the extracellular pathway,
  pro-BDNF released into the extracellular space is processed by metalloproteinases 2
  and 9 (MMP2 and MMP9), plasmin, and extracellular proteases. Consequently, functionally
  effective isoforms of m-BDNF and pro-BDNF can be found in the extracellular space.
