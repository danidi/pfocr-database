caption: Multivalency and conditional regulation at the cell surface. At the cell
  surface, lectins bind glycan epitopes and cross-link glycoprotein receptors, altering
  receptor dynamics and interactions, such as reducing loss to endocytosis. Oligosaccharyltransferase
  recognizes NXS/T motifs in newly synthesized proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum
  (ER) and transfers the pre-assembled glycan from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2-pp-dolichol to
  the Asn. The chaperones calnexin and calreticulin bind N-glycans and promote protein
  folding. Glycoproteins traffic through the Golgi, where exposure to branching and
  extension enzymes in the medial- and trans-Golgi is dependent on multiple factors,
  including protein synthesis rates and the sugar-nucleotide supply. The reaction
  kinetics for the branching enzymes Mgat1, Mgat2, Mgat4, and Mgat5 differ as indicated
  by the Kms for UDP-GlcNAc “D” and glycoprotein acceptor “A.” The enzyme kinetics
  are tuned for pathway ultrasensitivity to UDP-GlcNAc and sensitivity to the concentration
  of glycoprotein substrates passing through the Golgi (protein synthesis rates).
  The epitopes are completed in the trans-Golgi, where efficient substitution with
  galactose generates the LacNAc epitope. Further extension with fucose, sialic acid,
  and LacNAc can modify affinities for galectins and generate epitopes for other lectins.
