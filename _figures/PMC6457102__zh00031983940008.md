caption: Diagram depicting the proposed metabolic responses of brown, white, and beige
  adipocytes under cold-acclimating conditions. β3-Adrenergic receptor (β3-AdR) stimulation
  markedly increases lipolysis in brown adipose tissue (BAT; A), white (B), and beige
  (C) adipocytes. Under cold-acclimating conditions, BAT adipocytes use fatty acids
  (FA) for thermogenesis (red arrows), whereas white and beige adipocytes export FA
  to thermogenic tissues. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) content increases in beige adipocytes,
  although to a much lower level than in iBAT adipocytes. Thus UCP1-mediated mitochondrial
  uncoupling in beige adipocytes seems to have only a minor (small red arrow) thermogenic
  contribution in these cells under cold-acclimating conditions. Beige adipocytes
  enhance their capacity to re-esterify FA, which is supported by increased glycerol
  kinase (Gyk) and the expression of FA transporters (e.g., CD36). Enhanced TAG breakdown/resynthesis
  also facilitates the formation of multiple smaller lipid droplets (LD) and likely
  changes the appearance of beige adipocytes from unilocular to multilocular. Beige
  adipocytes use glucose and FA in the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle for energy production
  and to provide intermediate molecules that are essential for FA reesterification
  and de novo lipid synthesis (DNL). DAG, diacylglycerol; MAG, monoacylglycerol; β-ox, β-oxidation;
