caption: (A) In the absence of HH, PTCH1 prevents SMO from translocating to the cilia.
  GLI2/3 are associated with SUFU, which promotes GLI2/3 phosphorylation. GLI2/3 are
  proteolytically processed, which leads to the conversion of GLI3, and to a lesser
  extent GLI2 into transcriptional repressors. (B) In the presence of HH, SMO translocates
  to the cilia, which promotes the dissociation of the SUFU-GLI2/3 complex. The proteolysis
  of GLI2/3 is inhibited, which promotes the formation of GLI2, and to a lesser extent
  GLI3 activators.
