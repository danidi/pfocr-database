caption: 'The Calvin cycle and photorespiration pathway. The CNBP candidates are depicted
  in red font. Additional photorespiratory enzymes that were pulled down during the
  affinity purification procedure but excluded during the stringent elimination process
  (Table S2) are shown in blue font, where SAGT is ALANINE: GLYOXYLATE AMINOTRANSFERASE
  and CAT2 is CATALASE 2. The Calvin cycle and photorespiration pathway are connected
  by the dual-functioning enzyme RUBISCO shown in green. The CNBP candidate CA1 interconverts
  soluble HCO3− to gaseous CO2 and controls the supply of CO2 to RUBISCO and regulates
  stomatal closure through HCO3− effects on anion channels thereby further affecting
  the supply of CO2 to the plant. The CNBP candidates PGK1, GAPB and TKL are enzymes
  in the Calvin cycle. PGK1 and GAPB convert Ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate (RuBP) into
  the triose phosphate, D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate which can feed into sucrose and
  starch biosynthesis. TKL is involved in the regeneration of RuBP and significantly
  controls carbon flux through the Calvin cycle. The CNBP candidates GOX1 and SHMT1
  are enzymes in the photorespiration pathway. GOX1 catalyses the conversion of glycolate
  to glyoxylate with the concomitant release of H2O2 as a by-product. SHMT1 converts
  two molecules of glycine to serine, CO2, NH3 and NADH. This CO2 can feedback into
  the Calvin cycle while NH3 can feed into nitrogen assimilation'
