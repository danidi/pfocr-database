caption: 'Integrated metabolic, proteomic and transcriptomic functional analysis.
  The network represents the results from a KEGG pathway analysis of the DEGs (red
  and blue gene names) and modified proteins (orange gene names) included in Fig. ,
  as well as the metabolites listed in Fig. . Only pathways (nodes) including at least
  one metabolite and five hits are shown. The complete list of KEGG results are shown
  in Supplementary Table . Gene names are codified as in Fig. : blue and red gene
  names correspond to genes the transcripts of which appear as under- or over-represented
  in AA-treated samples, respectively; orange gene names indicate proteins for which
  at least one peptide showed more than 20% of its Cys residues as propionamide adducts.
  KEGG codes (in magenta) represent the metabolites listed in Fig. ; only natural
  metabolites could be included in the KEGG analysis, and all of them were found underrepresented
  in the AA-treated metabolome (Fig. ). KEGG codes are the following: C00003, NAD+;
  C00025, L-Glutamate; C00041, L-Alanine; C00049, L-Aspartate; C00051, GSH; C00127,
  GSSG; C00386, Carnosine; C00719 Betaine. Ovals show the position of relevant pathways.
  The central position of L-Glutamate, which participated in most identified pathways,
  is marked with a red frame.'
