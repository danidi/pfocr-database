caption: Cd induces activation of mTORC1 through generation of ROS. mTORC1 subsequently
  activates IRE1 without affecting PERK and ATF6, although mTORC1-independent mechanisms
  may also be involved in Cd/ROS-induced IRE1 activation. Activation of the IRE1 at
  the kinase domain leads to phosphorylation of JNK, leading to apoptotic cell death.
  On the other hand, activation of the IRE1 at the RNase domain causes generation
  of active XBP1. This IRE1–XBP1 pathway modestly counteracts the pro-apoptotic action
  of IRE1–JNK signaling.
