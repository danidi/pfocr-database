caption: Schematic of different PRRs in the cell and the signaling pathways that are
  activated by each PRR. TLRs are either anchored on the cell surface or are present
  in endosomal compartments. TLRs utilize myeloid differentiation primary response
  gene 88 (MYD88) or TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon (TRIF) as an
  adaptor protein to recruit downstream molecules, which eventually culminate in the
  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or type I interferon (IFN). The RLR
  family comprises of three receptors, RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated
  gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), each recognizing
  specific RNA ligands. RLRs signal through the adaptor protein MAVS (also called
  IPS-1, Cardif, VISA) located on the mitochondria to trigger the production of type
  I interferons together with NF-κB. NLRs are cytosolic PRRs that contain a nucleotide-binding
  domain (NBD), an LRR region, and an N-terminal effector which is typically a caspase
  activation and recruitment domain (CARD) or a pyrin domain (PYD). Several NLR proteins
  are members of a large complex called the inflammasome, which includes ASC and procaspase
  I. Inflammasome induction by a number of different PAMPs, results in the activation
  of IL-1β and IL-18 from pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, respectively. AIM2 is a non-NLR
  family protein which recognizes cytosolic dsDNA. Similar to NLRs, upon stimulation,
  AIM2 forms an inflammasome with procaspase I and ASC to induce IL-1β and IL-18.
