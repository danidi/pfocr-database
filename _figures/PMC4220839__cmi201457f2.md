caption: Cytosolic DNA recognition pathway for IL-1β production. Upon recognition
  of DNA, AIM2 interacts with ASC, a common adaptor of the inflammasome, leading to
  the assembly of an inflammasome and the cleavage of caspase-1, which induces the
  processing of pro-IL-1β and the secretion of IL-1β. Roth et al. demonstrated a new
  cytosolic DNA sensing pathway that was able to induce IL-1β. The presence of DNA
  or a DNA virus in the cytosol induces the formation of dsDNA–Rad50–CARD9 signaling
  complexes, which control NF-κB activation and the transcription of the gene encoding
  pro-IL-1β. AIM2, absent in melanoma 2; CARD9, caspase recruitment domain-containing
  protein 9.
