caption: Here we propose a model where in NRG amplifies the cholinergic anti-inflammatory
  pathway mediated by ACh and α7 nAChR during an inflammatory response. In panel A,
  we describe the possible signaling pathway responsible for the increased expression
  of α7nAChRs observed in microglia when treated with NRG. NRG signaling through ErbB4
  activates Ras/Raf/ERK of the MAPK pathway which leads to cell survival, and in muscle
  has been shown to activate the N-box response elements associated with the transcription
  of AChRs. Also of importance to NRGs neuroprotective function is the activation
  of the p85 subunit of PI3K pathway, its downstream effector PKB/Akt, and Jak/STAT
  pathways [,,] (not shown); signaling mechanisms also involved in cell survival.
  In panel B, we describe the well established cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway
  [modified from 38]. In response to inflammatory mediators, activation of the α7nAChR
  by its ligand ACh inhibits the synthesis of TNF-α by preventing the nuclear translocation
  of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. In addition, the activation of Jak2/STAT3 supports
  the synthesis of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and further attenuates TNF-α production
  by STAT3 action on IκK, NF-κB and p65. In panel C, we propose that in LPS-challenged
  microglia NRG acting in concert with ACh leads to increased reduction of TNF-α by
  inducing increased expression of α7nAChR and as such amplifying the cholinergic
  anti-inflammatory pathway by providing more receptors for ligand binding.
