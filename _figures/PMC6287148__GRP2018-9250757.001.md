caption: Diagram of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. A signalling epidermal
  growth factor binds to the receptor (EGFR) on the cell surface causing its phosphorylation
  and activation. The activated signal is passed to scaffolding proteins (GRB2 and
  SOS) which in turn promotes the removal of GDP from membrane-bound KRAS. KRAS then
  binds GTP, allowing its activation, and undergoes conformational change to bind
  and phosphorylate BRAF. The signalling cascade continues through MEK and ERK. Activated
  ERK translocates to the nucleus where it recruits transcription factors involved
  in cellular survival and growth. The V600E BRAF mutation allows for constitutive
  activation of BRAF and continuation of downstream signalling regardless of upstream
  regulation.
