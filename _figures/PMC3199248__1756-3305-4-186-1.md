caption: TLR induction of inflammation by parasitic infection. MyD88, TLRs and toll/IL-1
  receptor domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon (TRIF) signal transduction
  is activated by helminth infection, which results in the activation of NF-κB, IRF7
  and IRF3 for the induction of type I interferons (TRIF-dependent pathway). Activation
  of NF-κB is required for the induction of inflammatory cytokines.
