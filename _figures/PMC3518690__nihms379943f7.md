caption: 'Local secretion of TGF-β generates myofibroblasts from endothelial cells,
  fibroblasts in adventitia, smooth muscle cells in media, and fibrocytes in the peripheral
  circulation. Myofibroblasts secrete cytokines (IL-17, IL-6) and chemokines that
  recruit inflammatory cells. Myofibroblasts also present antigen leading to activation
  and proliferation of T-cells. Cessation of inflammation is mediated by T-cell regulation
  (FOXP3 + cells). Genetic variation in TGF-β pathway genes may modulate this cascade
  either up (more damage) or down (less damage). ec: endothelial cell; e: internal
  elastic lamina; m: media; a: adventitia. EMT: endothelial/epithelial to mesenchymal
  transition, Treg: regulatory T-cell.'
