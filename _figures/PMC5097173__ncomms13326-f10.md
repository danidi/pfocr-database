caption: During unperturbed S phase or after a low dose of APH, SUMOylation of polη
  on K163 promotes its recruitment to replication forks to allow the timely completion
  of the replication of specific genomic regions presumably bearing non-B DNA structures.
  This PTM relies on the ternary complex formed by polη, Rad18 and the SUMO ligase
  PIAS1 and is independent of Rad18 ubiquitin ligase activity. Whether polη function
  at difficult to replicate DNA sequences also requires Rad18-independent PCNA ubiquitination
  remains to be established. After ultraviolet exposure, PCNA is ubiquitinated at
  forks stalled by photoproducts by the Rad18/Rad6 complex, which allows accumulation
  of polη at damaged sites, as already described. However, SUMOylation of polη on
  K163 may also contribute, to a minor extent, to the recruitment of the polymerase,
  constituting an alternative pathway in cells deficient in PCNA ubiquitination.
