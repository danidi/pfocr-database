  leads to degradation of JAZ transcriptional repressor proteins via the proteasome,
  which results in the release of transcriptional activators, such as MYC2, 3, and
  4, and EIN3 and EIL1. Subsequently, AP2/ERF transcription factors, such as ORA59
  and ERF1, are induced that activate the ERF branch of the  pathway. Binding of ERFs
  to the GCC-box induces -responsive gene expression, which can be suppressed by  in
  an SCFCOI1-JAZ–independent manner. The GCC-box is sufficient for -mediated suppression
