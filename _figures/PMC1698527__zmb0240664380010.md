caption: Model for the transduction of DNA damage signals to the splicing machinery.
  Our data suggest that distinct DNA damage signaling pathways induced by CPT or IR
  converge on a common set of splicing factors that function to upregulate TAF1-3
  and TAF1-4 alternative splicing. Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors indicate
  that ATR and ATM kinase activities are necessary to signal alternative splicing
  of the TAF1 pre-mRNA in response to CPT or IR, respectively. RNAi experiments indicate
  the requirement for ATR/CHK1 and ATM/CHK2 to signal alternative splicing of the
  TAF1 pre-mRNA in response to CPT and IR, respectively. CHK2 is indicated in parentheses
  and in gray lettering because the data are suggestive of a role in the pathway.
  The CPT and IR pathways may converge on common splicing factors, including dU2AF38,
  to elicit the same effect on TAF1 pre-mRNA splicing.
