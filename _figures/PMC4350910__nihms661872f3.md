caption: Pathway for the synthesis of the endocannabinoids AEA and 2-AG. Arachidonoyl
  ethanolamide (AEA) is synthesized through the sequential activity of N-acyltransferase
  (NAT) and N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD). 2-Arachidonoyl-glycerol
  (2-AG) is synthesized through the sequential activity of phospholipase C (PLC) and
  diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase. Both endocannabinoids can then be exported from the
  cell, where they signal through GPCRs (such as CB1/2 receptors or others) or TRPV1.
  The signaling is terminated by cleavage of the endocannabinoid to generate arachidonic
  acid. 2-AG is cleaved by monoacylglycerol (MAG) lipases and AEA is cleaved by fatty
  acid amid hydrolase (FAAH), additionally generating glycerol and ethanolamine, respectively.
