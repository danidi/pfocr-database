caption: Model describing the distinct fates of NK cells during NK cell education.
  NK cells lacking self-specific receptors receive tonic stimulatory input through
  activating receptors and show poor functional responses, a process referred to as
  disarming. We found that such cells exhibit lower levels of the granule matrix protein
  serglycin and effector molecules granzyme B and perforin and lack dense-core secretory
  lysosomes. One putative pathway downstream of activation receptor signaling is PI3K/AKT
  that stimulate the enzyme PIKfyve, which converts PI3P to PI(3,5)P2 and thereby
  positively regulate the lysosome-specific Ca2+ channel TRPML1. PIKfyve and TRPML1
  are critically involved in lysosomal modulation in several cell types, . Inhibitory
  KIRs interfere with activation signals at a proximal level and thereby shut down
  any signals that could drive such lysosomal modulation. In support of this notion,
  we found that pharmacological interference with PIKfyve or silencing of TRPML1 replicated
  the educated state with enlarged lysosomes, increased granzyme B loads and more
  potent effector function. The secretory lysosome is part of the acidic Ca2+ stores
  and may thus potentiate receptor-mediated Ca2+ release from the ER–. Interference
  with signaling from the acidic Ca2+ stores resulted in the loss of NK cell function.
  Thus, the accumulation of dense-core secretory lysosomes during NK cell education
  may contribute to the increased function, not only through the increased cytotoxic
  payload, but also through enhanced signaling from acidic Ca2+ stores
