caption: 'Regulation of the transcriptional co-regulator β-catenin. (a) Glycogen synthase
  kinase 3 (GSK3) participates in the regulation of the canonical Wnt pathway. In
  the absence of Wnt, a pool of GSK3 is present in a complex with axin and the adenomatous
  polyposis coli (APC) protein. In this complex, GSK3 is catalytically active and
  it phosphorylates previously ‘primed'' β-catenin (that is, phosphorylated by casein
  kinase 1 on Ser45) at three further sites: Thr41, Ser37 and Ser33. This polyphospho-β-catenin
  is then degraded through the ubiquitin–proteasome system. When Wnts engage to the
  extracellular domain of their transmembrane receptors (Frizzled) and to the lipoprotein
  receptor-related protein (LRP) co-receptor, the axin–APC–GSK3 complex in association
  with the scaffold protein Dishevelled (Dsh) binds to the intracellular domains of
  Frizzled and LRP, and phosphorylations occur. GSK3 is now unable to phosphorylate
  β-catenin, which accumulates and enters the nucleus. Here, it displaces the co-repressor
  Groucho from its complex with T-cell-specific transcription factor/lymphoid enhancer
  binding factor 1 (TCF/LEF1), initiating gene expression. (b) It is suggested ()
  that a similar scheme may operate when endothelin-1 (ET-1) binds to its receptor
  in cardiac myocytes (the ETA receptor seems to be the principal endothelin-1 receptor).
  This leads to phosphorylation and activation of protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt) ()
  which then phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3 promoting β-catenin accumulation. It
  is however unclear which pool(s) of GSK3 is/are involved in this particular phosphorylation
  of β-catenin.'
