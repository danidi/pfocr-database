caption: The schematic diagram is representing the molecular mechanism through which
  mitochondrial DNA stimulates innate anti-microbial immunity. Under the stress conditions,
  mitochondrial DNA is released from mitochondria that stimulate the production of
  pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-1β, MMP-8, and TNF-α,) and also enhance
  their release. The escaped mitochondrial DNA following the microbial infection is
  detected by the cGAS/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway that
  causes TBK1/IRF3 dependent production of type I interferon and also limits replication
  of microbes. However, the caspases, e.g., caspase-3, -7, and -9 activation regulates
  the intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway. Furthermore, the escaped mitochondrial
  DNA after stress also stimulates the NLRP3 inflammasome to recruitment and activates
  caspase-1, which is involved in the cleavage of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1β into their
  active forms.
