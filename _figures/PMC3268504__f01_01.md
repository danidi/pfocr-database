caption: Metabolic intermediates of the shikimate pathway in higher plants. The first
  seven steps are common to the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan,
  with chorismate being the last shared precursor of the three amino acids. The phenylalanine
  and tyrosine pathways diverge after the biosynthesis of arogenate. Some reactants
  (ATP and PEP), and products (inorganic phosphate and water), have been omitted for
  the sake of clarity.
