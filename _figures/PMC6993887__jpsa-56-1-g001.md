caption: 'Diagram showing the l-Cit metabolic pathway. Enzymes for all steps of the
  biochemical pathway are shown. Notably, chickens lack carbamoyl phosphate synthetase,
  which is necessary for the synthesis of l-Cit from l-Orn (). Therefore, chickens
  cannot synthesize l-Cit from l-Orn (indicated with a cross). l-Arg, l-arginine;
  l-Cit, l-citrulline; NO, nitric oxide. This image was reprinted from Journal of
  Thermal Biology, 69: 163–170 with permission from Elsevier as the authors'' right.'
