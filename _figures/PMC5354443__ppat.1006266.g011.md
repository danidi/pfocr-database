caption: NS1 activates ATR through its TAD domain. Activated ATR then transduces signals
  to CDC25C through activating CHK1. CDC25C phosphatase activity is negatively regulated
  by phosphorylation at serine 216, which then creates a binding site for the 14-3-3
  protein in the cytoplasm []. Thus, inactive CDC25C cannot dephosphorylate the cyclin
  B1/CDK1(pT14/Y15) complex; the latter component is inactive, and so progression
  from G2- to M-phase is blocked. It is proposed that DNA replication-induced DDR,
  and thereafter ATR/CHK1 activation, which plays a role in viral DNA replication,
  should not be involved in CDC25C phosphorylation (see the  section for further explanation).
  The question mark indicates potential modification of CHK1, in addition to the phosphorylation
  at S345.
