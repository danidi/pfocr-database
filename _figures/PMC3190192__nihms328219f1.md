caption: PRL crosstalk with estrogen, progesterone, EGF/TGF-α, and IGF-I. PRL can
  synergize with IGF-I and EGF family ligands to activate MAPKs and AKT. These pathways
  contribute to expression of genes involved in proliferation, survival, and invasion.
  Furthermore, activation of these pathways is associated with resistance to endocrine,
  molecular, and chemo- and radio-therapies. ERK1/2 and AKT can also phosphorylate
  ERα and PR, leading to enhanced transcriptional activity and degradation. PRL signaling
  through the JAK2/STAT5 pathway increases expression of ERα, potentially enhancing
  estrogen sensitivity and expression of classical estrogen target genes, including
  PR. See text for further discussion.
