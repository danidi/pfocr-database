caption: Figure 3. Roles of DNA repair intermediates in cell signaling. Processing
  of double-strand breaks by the MRN complex generates short oligonucleotides that
  remain associated with MRN and stimulate ATM kinase activity (left panel). Repair
  of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) lesions by OGG1 during base excision repair leads to the
  formation of a stable OGG1–8-oxo-G complex that binds Ras and stimulates nucleotide
  exchange (middle panel). Nucleotide excision repair of thymine dimers releases oligonucleotides
  from the duplex that are initially in complex with TFIIH. This complex may activate
  an intracellular signaling pathway. After release from TFIIH, these oligonucleotides
  may bind RPA or other factors that may impact the cellular response to UV (right
  panel).
