caption: Oncogenic signals act through multiple parallel pathways to activate HIF
  and its target genes. In addition to regulation by hypoxia, hydroxylation of hypoxia
  inducible factor (HIF)-α may be influenced by metabolic and redox signals. In cancer,
  all of these micro-environmental stresses can inhibit hydroxylation leading to accumulation
  of HIF. Oncogenic signals also impinge on the HIF pathway at many other points,
  including transcription, translation, post-translational modification and pVHL-mediated
  degradation of HIF-α polypeptides. In addition, oncogenic signals activate many
  HIF target genes directly.
