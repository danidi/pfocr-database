caption: A schematic representation of medium-chain alkene production from ferulate
  (a) and glucose (b) by A. baylyi ADP1. In A. baylyi ADP1, genes hcaC and vanA,B
  encode for coenzyme A ligase and vanillate demethylation machinery respectively,
  responsible for conversion of ferulate to protocatechuate. Protocatechuate is further
  converted to the central metabolite, acetyl-CoA (coenzyme A), via β-ketoadipate
  pathway. Acetyl-CoA is also the precursor of fatty acid synthesis. Genes ‘tesA and
  undA, encoding for thioesterase and decarboxylase, respectively, are heterologously
  expressed in A. baylyi ADP1 for 1-undecene production. 1-Undecene is a semivolatile
  hydrocarbon, which can be directly collected from the culture headspace
