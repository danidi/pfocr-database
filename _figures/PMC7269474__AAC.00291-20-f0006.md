caption: Schematic representation of the interplay between the Cpx system and the
  chromosomal AmpC β-lactamase regulatory pathway in Enterobacteriaceae. In a wild-type
  background and under noninducing conditions, the PG is recycled. PG degradation
  products (disaccharide-peptides [aD-peptides]) are generated in the periplasm by
  the activity of PBPs. aD-peptides (aD-tripeptides, aD-tetrapeptides, and aD-pentapeptides)
  are transported into the cytoplasm by the inner membrane permease AmpG and processed
  by the amidase AmpD into their corresponding monosaccharide-peptides (aM-peptides).
  aM-peptides are then transformed into UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptides and incorporated
  to the PG biosynthesis pathway to complete the recycling process. In the cytoplasm,
  these UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptides interact with AmpR, creating a conformation that
  represses the transcription of ampC. In addition, normal interactions between CpxP
  and the periplasmic sensor domain of CpxA keeps the Cpx system off. Strong AmpC
  inducers such as imipenem simultaneously bind to several PBPs, leading to an increase
  of aD-pentapeptides in the periplasm (AmpG saturation) and aM-tripeptides (AmpD
  saturation) in the cytoplasm. In the cytoplasm, the accumulated aM-tripeptides displace
  UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptides from AmpR, creating a conformation that activates the transcription
  of ampC. In addition, our data showed that the increased level of aD-pentapeptides
  in the periplasm is sensed by the Cpx system. The release of CpxP from CpxA-SD by
  competing interactions with aD-pentapeptides probably switches the Cpx system on.
  High level of CpxR∼P leads to AmpC overexpression and thus to β-lactam resistance.
  The proposed feedback loop involving the lytic glycosylase appears in red. It also
  unknown whether CpxA or CpxP interacts with the putative signaling muropeptide in
  the periplasm. The cpxAY144N mutation alters the interaction between CpxA-SD and
  CpxP. This activates the Cpx response and leads to ampC overexpression, even in
  the absence of AmpC inducers. This mutation also acts on other genes of the Cpx
  regulon that impact antibiotic resistance.
