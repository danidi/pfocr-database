caption: 'Cisd2 preserves the structure and function of MAM during cardiac ageing.
  (A) Four characters of mitochondria-related dysfunction are identified during cardiac
  ageing: (i) Disruption of integrity of MAM contact sites. Physical proximity and
  functional interplay between mitochondria and SR are disturbed during cardiac ageing;
  this is associated with a widened gap distance between ER and mitochondria leading
  to an abnormal Ca2+signaling and lipid transport. (ii) Dysregulation of energy flexibility.
  More than 95% of cardiac ATP is produced from the oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria
  via electron transfer chain (ETC), which is fueled with energy primarily from β-oxidation
  of fatty acids (FA) and to a lesser extent from glycolysis of glucose. Defective
  fatty acid oxidation of mitochondria jeopardizes the energy flexibility of cardiomyocytes.
  (iii) Ca2+ dyshomeostasis. Elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels resulted from the defective
  Ca2+ recruitment of ER and decreased Ca2+ influx capacity of mitochondria as well
  as impaired cellular Ca2+ extrusions are detectable in aged hearts. (iv) Disturbance
  of mitophagy accompanied with increased ROS. Decrease in the capacity of lysosomal
  degradation pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as decrease in mitophagy
  are observed in aged hearts. Furthermore, these defects usually associated with
  increased oxidative stress. (B) Cisd2 activator as a geroprotector to increase Cisd2
  and to preserve cardiac function during ageing. Cisd2 is mainly located in the ER,
  mitochondria, and MAM. The expression level of Cisd2 decreases during cardiac ageing.
  A high level of Cisd2 achieved by treatment of Cisd2 activators probably can attenuate
  these abnormalities during cardiac ageing.'
