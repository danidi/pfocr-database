caption: 'a. Organization of homologs of the endocrocin biosynthetic gene cluster
  in Aspergillus species, FIESC 28 and Pestalotiopsis fici. Blue arrows represent
  homologous genes present in at least two fungi. Direction of arrows indicate direction
  of transcription. Abbreviations for gene/protein functions are as follows: AO, anthrone
  oxidase; TE, metallo-β-lactamase type thioesterase (MβL-TE); PKS, polyketide synthase;
  TF, = transcription factor, UN, gene of unknown function. The numbers in blue arrows
  indicate homologs. Black arrows indicate genes that are considered part of the biosynthetic
  cluster in the respective fungi but that were not present in FIESC 28. b. Proposed
  biosynthetic pathway for endocrocin anthrone in FIESC 28 and for endocrocin in the
  other fungi'
