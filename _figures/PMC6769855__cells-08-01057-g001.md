caption: A simple depiction of signaling pathways for the activation of classical
  NLRP3 inflammasome (canonical and non-canonical) and alternative inflammasome. Canonical
  inflammasome activation includes a priming and activation step. The priming step,
  by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and cytokines, leads to the expression
  of inflammasome components, NLRP3, and pro-IL-1β through the NF-κB pathway. The
  activation step is triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such
  as ATP, crystals, pore-forming toxins, and metabolites, which induce the formation
  of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, where caspase-1 is activated. Activated caspase-1
  in turn cleaves pro-IL-1β for the production and secretion of active IL-1β. It also
  cleaves gasdermin D (GSMD), which leads to the formation of membrane pores and triggers
  pyroptosis. Non-canonical NLRP3-inflammasome is initiated by sensing cytosolic LPS
  by caspase-11/-4/-5. Then, activated caspase-11/-5/-4 cleaves GSDMD, which leads
  to pyroptosis. In parallel, the activated caspase-11/-4/-5 activates pannexin-1,
  leading to ATP release and K+ efflux in order to derive NLRP3 inflammasome activation
  and IL-1β secretion. In contrast to classical inflammasome activation, alternative
  inflammasome activation can be triggered by a single signal. LPS stimulation induces
  the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via a TLR4-TRIF-RIPK1-FADD-CASP8 signaling
  axis, independently of the potassium efflux. The alternative inflammasome activation
  does not induce pyroptosis.

  description: A simple depiction of signaling pathways for the activation of classical
    NLRP3 inflammasome (canonical and non-canonical) and alternative inflammasome.
    Canonical inflammasome activation includes a priming and activation step. The
    priming step, by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and cytokines,
    leads to the expression of inflammasome components, NLRP3, and pro-IL-1β through
    the NF-κB pathway. The activation step is triggered by damage-associated molecular
    patterns (DAMPs), such as ATP, crystals, pore-forming toxins, and metabolites,
    which induce the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, where caspase-1
    is activated. Activated caspase-1 in turn cleaves pro-IL-1β for the production
    and secretion of active IL-1β. It also cleaves gasdermin D (GSMD), which leads
    to the formation of membrane pores and triggers pyroptosis. Non-canonical NLRP3-inflammasome
    is initiated by sensing cytosolic LPS by caspase-11/-4/-5. Then, activated caspase-11/-5/-4
    cleaves GSDMD, which leads to pyroptosis. In parallel, the activated caspase-11/-4/-5
    activates pannexin-1, leading to ATP release and K+ efflux in order to derive
    NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion. In contrast to classical inflammasome
    activation, alternative inflammasome activation can be triggered by a single signal.
    LPS stimulation induces the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome via a TLR4-TRIF-RIPK1-FADD-CASP8
    signaling axis, independently of the potassium efflux. The alternative inflammasome
    activation does not induce pyroptosis.
