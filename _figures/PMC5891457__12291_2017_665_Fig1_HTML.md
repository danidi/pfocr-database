caption: Hypothesized model of relationship between DNA damage and Double strand DNA
  repair pathway gene polymorphism. a After damaging the DNA Wild type (WT) XRCC3
  and XRCC7 gene done optimum DNA repair and inhibit cancer risk. b Mutant (Mut) XRCC3
  and XRCC7 would results in reduced DNA repair capacity and increased cancer risk
