caption: 'Endogenous sources and consequences of ROS overproduction. Overproduction
  of superoxide anion and H2O2 by NOX (NOX and Duox), cytochrome c oxidase, or xanthine
  oxidase (XO) and the subsequent increased level of hydroxyl radical (generated through
  the Fenton or Haber-Weiss reaction) are leading to lipids, proteins, and nucleic
  acid oxidation and, in consequence, to genomic instability, mutations, and carcinogenesis.
  Upon this conditions, cell survival or death is dependent on the activation of either
  ASK-1 or PI3K: high level of ROS tends to activate the ASK-1/JNK pathway leading
  to cell death, while lower or transient ROS production may result in the activation
  of PI3K kinase (accompanied by ASK-1/JNK inhibition) and NF-κB-mediated survival.'
