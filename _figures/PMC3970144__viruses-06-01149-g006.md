caption: HCV assembly involves a concerted action of all viral proteins and hijacks
  the host lipoprotein synthesis pathway. The color code for the viral proteins is
  similar to , with non-structural proteins in green, and components of the replication
  complex in light green. Upon cleavage of its C-terminus, core protein is loaded
  onto LDs, a process controlled by DGAT1 []. The junction between core-loaded LDs
  and the replication-complex-rich ER membranes forms the platform for virion assembly.
  Newly replicated viral genomes are transferred to the assembly sites via NS3/4A
  or NS5A. NS2 and p7 connect replication complexes and core proteins to the glycoproteins.
  Virus budding occurs by encapsidation of the viral RNA, and envelopment in the ER
  membrane. The subsequent interplay with the host lipoprotein pathway remains poorly
  understood. Note that this schema represents one hypothetical model among several.
  Indeed, lipoprotein components might be incorporated within the viral particle concomitant
  with budding, as suggested by the co-trafficking of core and apoE []. Alternatively,
  as depicted in this model, dense intracellular virions might bud and, in a second
  step, mature by incorporating lipoprotein components within the lumen of the secretory
  pathway. This could happen by acquisition of apoE and fusion with luminal LDs, normally
  involved in the maturation of the VLDL precursors. The differences in biophysical
  properties of intra- and extracellular virions support this hypothesis of a late
  association [].
