caption: Two enzymes, InhA and KasA, have been proposed as targets for INH. Both are
  members of the type II dissociated fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (FASII) in M.
  tuberculosis (), consistent with the observation that INH interferes with the biosynthesis
  of mycolic acids, very long chain fatty acid components of the mycobacterial cell
  wall. InhA, an enoyl reductase that catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of long
  chain trans-2-enoyl-acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), was first identified as a target
  by Jacobs and coworkers (, ) who observed mutations in the inhA gene in INH-resistant
  clinical isolates and identified a point mutant (S94A) that conferred resistance
  to INH and ethionamide in Mycobacterium smegmatis and in Mycobacterium bovis. Subsequently,
  Blanchard, Sacchettini, and coworkers (–) demonstrated that InhA was inhibited in
  vitro by a covalent adduct formed between activated INH and the nicotinamide head
  group of NAD (). InhA mutations observed in INH-resistant clinical isolates were
  found to be localized to the cofactor binding site and were shown to result in decreased
  affinity of the purified enzyme for NADH (, ), consistent with the hypothesis that
  binding of NADH to the enzyme precedes adduct formation. In addition, Vilcheze et
  al. () used a temperature-sensitive mutation in the inhA gene to show that the phenotypic
  response to InhA inactivation in M. smegmatis was identical to that caused by treatment
  with INH, thereby validating InhA as a target for drug discovery. However, although
  there is convincing evidence that InhA is inhibited by INH, Barry and coworkers
  () have also proposed that KasA, one of three ketoacyl synthases in the FASII pathway
  (), is a target for INH in vivo. Subsequent experiments involving the effect of
  drugs on gene (, ) and protein expression (), and studying the effect of InhA and
  KasA expression on drug resistance (, ), have highlighted the apparent complexity
  in the mode of action of INH.
