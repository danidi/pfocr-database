caption: 'Schematic illustration of the autophagy process in macrophages and recent
  advances in targeting autophagy for atherosclerotic treatments. Under conditions
  including nutrient insufficiency, hunger or increased ROS, cup-shaped phagophores
  with bilayer lipid membranes are formed that are composed of various types of Atgs.
  Spherical double-membrane autophagosomes subsequently form. On integration with
  lysosomes, autophagosomes turn into autolysosomes, which function in degradation.
  Two major signaling pathways regulate this process: an inductive pathway that involves
  Class-III PI3K-Beclin1 signaling and an inhibitory pathway that involves Class I
  PI3K-mTOR signaling. Several autophagy inducers are effective at positively intervening
  in autophagy. Of these, everolimus, resveratrol and berberine inhibit the autophagy
  suppressor mTOR, and berberine also activates AMPK. The overexpression of β-arrestin-1
  and the activation of CB2R are thought to increase the expression of Beclin1 and
  LC3, contributing to the initiation of autophagy.'
