caption: Conceptual organization of key components of the fragments of life library,
  with example fragments. The current FOL library (1329 molecules) contains chemically
  tractable natural small molecule metabolites such as bestatin 1 (FOL-Nat), metabolite-like
  compounds and their bioisosteres (FOL-NatD), and protein architecture mimetics (FOL-Biaryl).
  Any natural molecule with MW < 350 Da that exists as a substrate, natural product,
  or allosteric regulator of any metabolic pathway in any cell type is a potential
  candidate FOL-Nat fragment. Example fragments 11 and 13 that contain the privileged
  scaffold indole() from the serotonin and auxin biosynthetic pathways are shown.
  FOL-NatD fragments are defined as heteroatom containing derivatives, analogues,
  or fragments of any FOL-Nat molecule. FOL-Biaryl fragments were selected from a
  variety of biaryl compounds that are potential mimics of protein α, β, or γ turns.−
  At the right-hand side of the figure, compound 10 can be seen superimposed on a
  β-turn of a protein structure (residues Ala20-Ala21-Asp22-Ser23 of PDB ID 1RTP).
  An additional FOL-Biaryl component is also shown, superimposed on an α-turn (residues
  Ser65-Ile66-Leu67-Lys68 of PDB ID 1RTP).
