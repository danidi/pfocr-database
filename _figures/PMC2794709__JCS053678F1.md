caption: The O-GlcNAcylation cycle. Glucose is metabolized through  the hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway to form the high-energy intermediate  UDP-GlcNAc, which serves
  as the sugar donor for OGT. The O-GlcNAc  cycle starts when OGT catalyzes the transfer
  of GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to  serine and/or threonine residues of a protein substrate
  through  β-glycosidic attachment. Although no consensus sequence has been  identified
  for OGT, proline and valine are the most common amino acids found  prior to the
  serine or threonine target site. The O-GlcNAcylated  protein can be a substrate
  for O-GlcNAcase, which hydrolyses the  glycosidic linkage to generate free GlcNAc
  and naked protein.
