caption: ITAM-like-bearing CTLRs within the Dectin-1 cluster. As well as Dectin-1,
  there are two additional receptors that contain ITAM-like motifs. These receptors
  share Syk as a primary downstream signaling kinase; however, the lack of a tri-acidic
  in CLEC-9A and the presence of an isoleucine prevent the endocytic and activation
  functions of this receptor. CLEC-2 utilises its tri-acidic motif to complement activation
  through Syk resulting in adhesion and clot formation in platelets. Dashed arrows
  represent a pathway that has yet to be fully defined.
