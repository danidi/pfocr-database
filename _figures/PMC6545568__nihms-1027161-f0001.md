caption: A, hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. Upon entry into the cell, glucose is
  phosphorylated, most of which is destined for glycolysis or glycogen storage. A
  small percentage of F-6-P can be diverted to the HBP, culminating in the formation
  of the monosaccharide, UDP-GlcNAc. Although UDP-GlcNAc pools are drawn upon by several
  other cellular processes, this sugar serves as the donor for the O-GlcNAc post-translational
  modification. B, intracellular localization of the enzymes responsible for adding
  (OGT) and removing (O-GlcNAcase) the O-GlcNAc post-translational modification from
  proteins. Both enzymes are located throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus. These enzymes
  are not generally associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi complex.
  Some evidence indicates a potential mitochondrial isoform of OGT. Such varied distribution
  yields numerous proteins that are O-GlcNAc-modified, including transcription factors.
