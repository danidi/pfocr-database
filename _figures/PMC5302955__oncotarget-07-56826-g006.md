caption: (Left) IGF-1 binding to IGF-1R leads to phosphorylation and activation of
  the IGF-1R and recruitment of IRS-1 for the activation of the PI3-K pathway. Following
  activation of PI3-K, AKT becomes phosphorylated on two key residues by PDK1 and
  TORC2. This allows for AKT to engage in pro-survival signalling. When the IGF-1R-PI3-K-AKT
  pathway is active, cells are protected from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapies
  and can activate DDR and anti-apoptotic pathways to prevent cell death. (Right)
  In the presence of IGF-1R TKIs OSI-906 or BMS-754807, activation of the IGF-1R and
  PI3-K pathway are inhibited and DNA damage is induced in the nucleus (γH2AX). In
  response to γH2AX, ATR and other components of the DDR response are activated to
  repair DNA. However in the presence of VE-821, ATR cannot repair the damaged DNA
  and cell death occurs.
