caption: Proposed catabolic network in C. saccharolyticus. Glucose is transported
  over the membrane by an ABC transport system (1) [,] and oxidized to pyruvate in
  the EMP pathway [,], with the possibility that PPi can potentially replace ATP,
  i.e., PPi-PFK (2) instead of ATP-PFK (3), or ADP, i.e., PPDK (5) instead of PYK
  (6) []. NADH generated through the GAPDH-catalyzed reaction (4) and Fdred generated
  from the PFOR-catalyzed reaction (7) can donate electrons for the generation of
  molecular H2 catalyzed by cytosolic NADH-dependent Fe-only hydrogenase and membrane-bound
  Fd-dependent NiFe-hydrogenase, respectively []. Acetate is formed by the consecutive
  actions of phosphotransacetylase (PTA; 8) and acetate kinase (AK; 9), with the generation
  of ATP. Alternative routes for NADH reoxidation are the formation of lactate (LDH;
  11), ethanol (ADH; 10) or succinate (12) []. The solid lines represent metabolic
  routes, whereas the dashed lines represent metabolite activation (+) or inhibition
  (-) of enzyme activities. PPi generated from anabolic reactions [] is a strong inhibitor
  of both PYK and LDH activities [,].
