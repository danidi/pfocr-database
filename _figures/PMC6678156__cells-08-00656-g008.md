caption: Model of miR-146b-3p mediated regulatory mechanism in myoblast proliferation,
  differentiation, and apoptosis. In simple terms, miR-146b-3p downregulates the expression
  of AKT1 and MDFIC by targeting the 3′UTR of their mRNA. Both the phosphorylation
  of AKT1 and AKT can trigger the activation of PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby promoting
  the expression of cell cycle-related genes and myoblast differentiation-related
  genes and suppress cell apoptosis-related genes, which in turn facilitate cell proliferation
  and differentiation and inhibit apoptosis. In addition, the expression of MDFIC
  can also lead to the same effect.
