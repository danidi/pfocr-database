caption: Amino acids sensing of mTORC1 Rag-Ragulator-dependent mTORC1 activation in
  response to amino acid. On amino acids stimulation, Rag anchored by Ragulators (MP1/p14/p18)
  on the lysosome membrane can be activated by an unknown mechanism, and the active
  Rag complex subsequently recruits mTORC1. On the lysosomal membrane, the mTORC1
  is activated by Rheb, whose activity is enhanced by growth factor-mediated suppression
  of TSC complex. This model nicely explains how amino acids and growth factor signals
  are coordinated to produce maximal activation of mTORC1 at the lysosome by active
  Rag and Rheb small GTPases. The dotted or solid line indicates indirect or direct
  regulation, respectively.
