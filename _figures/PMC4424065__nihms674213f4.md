caption: '(A) Macrophages perpetuate activation and recruitment via complement and
  FcγR pathways. DSA crosslinking of HLA on endothelium results in P-selectin mobilization
  to the cell surface, and provides a binding platform for C1q (1). Classical complement
  activation produces C5a (2), which has two functions: (i) C5a recruits monocytes
  to activated EC, which tether to P-selectin via PSGL-1, promoting graft infiltration
  and differentiation into macrophages (3); and (ii) C5a may act on intragraft CD68+
  macrophages and induce FcγR expression (4). These cells can recognize immune complexes
  (IC) via FcγR, which can upregulate C5a production (5). Newly synthesized C5a may
  signal in either an autocrine (6a) or paracrine (6b) fashion, mediating further
  activation of intragraft macrophages and recruitment and activation of monocytes
  from the periphery, respectively. (B) Recent studies have identified a novel role
  for endothelial cells and complement in antigen presentation and stimulation of
  allogeneic T cells. Under inflammatory conditions (such as IFNγ activation) endothelial
  cells express HLA class II as well as ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and IL-6, molecules that are
  critical for promoting allo CD4 T cell proliferation (4) and differentiation into
  Th17 and Treg subsets. Preliminary work has shown that HLA antibodies modulate endothelial
  alloimmunogenicity through activation of the classical complement pathway (1) resulting
  in deposition of sublytic MAC (2). MAC triggers non-canonical NFκB signaling leading
  to inflammatory gene expression (3) and stimulation of allogeneic CD4 T cells (4).
  T cells also express receptors for complement split products C3a and C5a, which
  provide costimulatory signals and augment T cell proliferation. Therefore, it is
  likely that the presence of these anaphylatoxins at the endothelial-T cell interface
  might enhance T cell alloimmunity (5).'
