caption: Connectivity of differentially expressed genes in the important signaling
  pathways in the Type 2 Diabetes subjects, relative to non-diabetic controls, depicting
  the connectivity between differentially expressed genes (those with ≥ 2-fold change,
  t-test, p < 0.05). Geometric figures in red denote upregulated genes, and those
  that are green indicate downregulation. Genes in the top 3 networks (from our experimental
  set of 1657 genes) were allowed to grow our pathway with the direct/indirect relationship
  from the IPA knowledge base. Solid interconnecting lines show the genes that are
  directly connected, and the dotted lines signify the indirect connections between
  the genes and cellular functions. Canonical pathways for signaling that are highly
  represented are shown within the box. Genes in uncolored notes were integrated into
  computational generated networks based on evidence stored in the IPA knowledge base.
