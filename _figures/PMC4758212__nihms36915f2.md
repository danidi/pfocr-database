caption: p38 pathways regulate Ras oncogene activity by negative feedback (A) and
  signaling integration (B). Along the p38 pathway, MKK6, p38alpha and MK2/PRAK have
  been shown to be activated by Ras oncogene through MEK/ERK pathways and in turn
  suppress Ras activity by negative feedback (A) (). The p38gamma expression, on the
  other hand, is induced by Ras that is required for Ras transformation (). Phosphorylated
  p38alpha was recently shown to down-regulate p38gamma protein expression by ubiquitin/proteasome
  pathways (). In a given system, therefore, the Ras transforming activity will be
  determined by integrated signaling from the Ras-suppressor p38alpha and the Ras-effector
  p38gamma (B) (, ). Solid lines were used for elucidative purpose and detail pathways
  for these regulations remain to be established.
