caption: Reduced HIF-1α expression in TRPM2-S-expressing cells determined by proteomic
  analysis. Differentially expressed proteins between TRPM2-L- and TRPM2-S-expressing
  xenografts (n = 5 each) were determined using GeLC-MS/MS. A, the HIF-1α network
  was generated according to Ingenuity pathway knowledge criteria. Pink, significantly
  up-regulated proteins; green, significantly down-regulated proteins; blue, predicted
  reduction in expression. B, analysis of -fold change and accession numbers of differentially
  expressed proteins in the HIF-1α signaling pathway. * indicates that proteins were
  identified multiple times in different sample fractions. Only the highest expression
  value was included in ingenuity pathway analysis.
