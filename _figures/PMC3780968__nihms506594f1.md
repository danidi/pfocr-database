caption: A summary of key steps in TGFβ production and signalling. Starting at the
  bottom left; TGFβ associates with LTBPs inside the cell to form the large latent
  complex (LLC). After secretion the LLC is localized to ECM fibres via LTBP mediated
  interactions. Active TGFβ may be released by a number of factors reviewed here.
  TGFβ can induce down stream signalling by binding its type 1 and type 2 receptors.
  The canonical signalling pathway involves phosphorylation of R-SMADs by the type
  I TGFβ receptor. Phosphorylated R-SMADs (pSMAD2/3) interact with SMAD4 and are translocated
  to the nucleus, where they regulate the transcription of many genes through interactions
  with CAGA repeat elements. Various nuances of TGFβ signalling have been excluded
  here for the purposes of simplicity.
