caption: Molecular mechanisms of Notch-mediated epidermal homeostasis. A schematic
  diagram depicting the intersecting pathways and downstream effectors during Notch-induced
  differentiation. Notch expression and/or signaling in epidermal keratinocytes are
  promoted by p53 and antagonized by AP-1, which represses p53 expression. Notch also
  represses AP-1 activity, suggesting that the Notch and AP-1 pathways are mutually
  antagonistic. Notch signaling subsequently promotes cell-cycle arrest of progenitor
  cells in the basal layer by repressing p63 and by inducing the expression of the
  cell-cycle inhibitor CDKN1a/p21. Differentiation is promoted by the induction of
  factors including IRF6 and the Hes/Hey family of transcriptional repressors. Notch
  also promotes RA signaling by inducing the expression of retinol-binding proteins
  such as CRABP2, FABP5, and CRBP-1. Activation of the RA pathway promotes the differentiation
  of the epidermal epithelium.
