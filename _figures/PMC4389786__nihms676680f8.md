caption: Model summarizing the main findings of this report. a, In chromosomally stable
  cancer cells the CHK2-BRCA1 tumor suppressor pathway is required to ensure proper
  levels of Aurora-A activity at mitotic centrosomes. This ensures proper microtubule
  plus end assembly rates as a prerequisite for normal progression of mitosis and
  proper chromosome segregation. b, Either the loss of the CHK2-BRCA1 tumor suppressor
  pathway or an overexpression of AURKA results in enhanced levels of Aurora-A at
  mitotic centrosomes, which triggers increased microtubule assembly rates. This,
  in turn, causes transient spindle geometry abnormalities facilitating the generation
  of erroneous microtubule-kinetochore attachments and lagging chromosomes as a source
  for chromosome missegregation. Thus, increased microtubule assembly rates represent
  a key trigger for perpetual chromosome missegregation, which is associated with
  reduced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.
