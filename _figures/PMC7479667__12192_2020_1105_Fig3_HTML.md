caption: Indirect and metabolic effects of stress on T cells. After T cell activation
  by TCR and CD28 signal, glucose transportation 1 (Glut1) is upregulated and then
  mTOR pathway and glycolysis are activated. Glucocorticoids can inhibit glycolysis,
  decrease intercellular glucose, and may limit glucose availability in activated
  T cells using GC-induced insulin resistance
