caption: Bacterial and host effector molecules with potential probiotic effects. Lactobacillus
  strains are able to induce IL‐10‐producing, regulatory T cells (T reg) through DC‐SIGN
  interaction (1). They can also induce hyporesponsive CD4+ T‐cell populations after
  DC interaction (2). Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) composition is responsible for the differential
  modulation of cytokine production (3). Modulation of inflammatory responses by inactivation
  of the NF‐κB signalling pathway is achieved through proteasome inhibition after
  IEC recognition of soluble probiotic components (4) or after recognition of bacterial
  motifs (e.g. CpG DNA by TLR9 receptors) (6). The induction of Hsps (either via 4
  or 5) stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton would strengthen the mucosal barrier. Pathogen
  attachment and growth could be counteracted by strains possessing mannose adhesins
  (7) or by induction of hBD2 in IECs (8). M cell is an epithelial cell specialized
  in antigen uptake and transport. Reproduced and adapted with permission from ),
