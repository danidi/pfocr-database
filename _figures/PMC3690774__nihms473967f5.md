caption: 'IPA-generated network shows 0.1 μM E2 expression values overlaying the putative
  CREB-mediated regulatory network comprising genes important in prothrombin activation
  (right) or nervous system development and function impacted by 0.1 μM BPA exposure
  (see ). Solid lines represent direct interactions; dotted lines represent indirect
  interactions. Arrows are IPA-generated and do not necessarily indicate activation.
  Green molecules: lowered expression compared to controls, red molecules: elevated
  expression compared to controls, grey molecules: expression did not change upon
  E2 exposure, white molecule: not included on the microarray. Asterisk after a symbol
  depicts duplicate identifiers for the same gene.'
