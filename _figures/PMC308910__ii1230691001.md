caption: Phosphatidylcholine and phosphorylcholine biosynthetic pathways showing biosynthetic
  genes and intermediates. The three described pathways are the lic-1 pathway (in
  grey), found in commensal Neisseria and H. influenzae (, )—previous work showed
  that there are no homologues of this pathway in pathogenic Neisseria (, ); the pmtA
  pathway, found in Pseudomonas, Bradyrhizobium, Rhodobacter, and Sinorhizobium (,
  , , ); and the pcs pathway, found in Sinorhizobium and Pseudomonas (, ). Genes and
  proteins identified and characterized in this study are marked by asterisks. LOS,
  lipooligosaccharide.
