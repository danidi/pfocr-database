caption: Autophagy mediates degradation of NF-κB signaling components. a) NIK and
  IKKs are targets for degradation by autophagy upon inhibition of Hsp90. This leads
  to inactivation of NF-κB pathway and, in turn, inhibition of autophagy through downregulation
  of an essential autophagy gene Beclin 1. The feedback regulatory loop between autophagy
  and NF-κB pathways is depicted. b) IKKβ degradation by autophagy through a mechanism
  that involves Keap1. In cells treated by TNF, Keap1 is responsible for the negative
  regulation of NF-κB through inhibition of the IKKβ phosphorylation and induction
  of IKKβ degradation by the autophagy pathway. c) IKKβ degradation by autophagy through
  a mechanism that involves Ro52. In cells infected with HTLV-1, Tax activates IKKβ-dependent
  NF-κB activation. Active IKKβ subsequently interacts with Ro52; this induces monoubiquitination
  of IKKβ and leads to its degradation by autophagy resulting in the termination of
  NF-κB activation. Ub represents ubiquitin. For details, see text.
