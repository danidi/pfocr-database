caption: 'The unfolded protein response pathway. When the unfolded protein response
  is activated, the first event is the dissociation of the chaperone Bip from the
  three integral proteins PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, leading to their activation. When
  activated, PERK phosphorylates and inhibits eiF2α, leading to a global decrease
  in protein translation. Moreover, p-eiF2α activates ATF4, which induces the expression
  of several genes, including amino acid transporters, chaperones, and CHOP. Activation
  of IRE1 promotes the splicing of XBP1 mRNA and the subsequent transcription of molecular
  chaperones and genes involved in ERAD. Finally, activated ATF6 undergoes proteolytic
  cleavage in the Golgi, transactivating genes such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
  chaperones and foldases. Bip: Binding immunoglobulin protein; ATF6: Activating transcription
  factor-6; IRE1: Inositol requiring enzyme-1; PERK: Protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase;
  XBP1: X-box-binding protein-1; eiF2α: Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α;
  ATF4: Transcription factor 4; ERAD: Endoplasmic reticulum associated protein degradation;
  CHOP: C/EBP-homologous protein.'
