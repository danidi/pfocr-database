caption: The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is functional in several
  types of immune cells, including T cells, B cells and macrophages, but is also present
  in structural cells such as fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Activation of mTOR in
  these cells is associated with several rheumatic diseases. AS, ankylosing spondylitis;
  BREG, B regulatory cell; DN, CD4/CD8-double-negative cell; CHC, chondrocyte; FLS,
  fibroblast-like synoviocyte; GN/IN, glomerulonephritis/interstitial nephritis; ILD,
  interstitial lung disease; Met, metformin; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; OA, osteoarthritis;
  PB, plasmablast; PC, plasma cell; PHTN, pulmonary hypertension; PsA, psoriatic arthritis;
  SSc, systemic sclerosis; RA, rheumatoid arthritis, RAPA, rapamycin; SLE, systemic
  lupus erythematosus; TFH, T folicular helper cell; TH1, T helper cell type 1; TH17,
  T helper cell type 17; TREG, T regulatory cell; VEC, vascular endothelial cell;
  VSMC, vascular smooth-muscle cell.
