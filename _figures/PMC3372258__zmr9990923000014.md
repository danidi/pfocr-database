caption: 'Major pathways of compartmentalized energy metabolism in bloodstream (a)
  and procyclic (b) life cycle stages of the flagellated and fully oxygen-dependent
  protist parasite Trypanosoma brucei. The maps are redrawn based on data reported
  previously (, , ). (a) In bloodstream forms, Trypanosoma brucei mitochondria help
  to maintain cell redox homeostasis via glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and alternative
  oxidase, which, together with ubiquinone, constitute the whole O2-consuming respiratory
  chain, which does not, however, produce ATP. The inner mitochondrial membrane ATPase
  works in reverse; that is, it pumps protons to the intermembrane space while hydrolyzing
  ATP to ADP. The major metabolic end product pyruvate is generated in the cytosol.
  The photograph shows a long slender bloodstream form of Trypanosoma brucei with
  a length of ca. 25 μm (circles in the background are erythrocytes). (Photograph
  by Rob Koelewijn, Harbor Hospital, Rotterdam, Netherlands.) (b) Energy metabolism
  is more complex in procyclic T. brucei stages. Succinate is generated both in glycosomes
  by a soluble fumarate reductase and in mitochondria via a recently functionally
  characterized soluble mitochondrial fumarate reductase (). Acetate is produced in
  mitochondria mainly by means of the acetate:succinate CoA-transferase/succinyl-CoA
  synthetase cycle, but an alternative pathway is also present (). In T. brucei, no
  lactate is formed from pyruvate (); instead, another end product commonly found
  in facultative anaerobic animals, alanine, is produced by alanine aminotransferase.
  The respiratory chain contains not only an alternative oxidase and glycerol-3-phosphate
  dehydrogenase but also an alternative rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase ().
