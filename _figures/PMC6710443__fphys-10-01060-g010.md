caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanisms about the role of HDAC3/NF-kappaB pathway
  in pathogenesis and exercise therapy of OA. Moderate-intensity of exercise can inhibit
  nuclear translocation of HDAC3/NF-kappaB complex, leading to decreased expression
  of inflammatory proteins. Meanwhile, the HDAC3 inhibitor RGFP966 could also alleviate
  inflammation response in OA through HDAC3/NF-kappaB pathway in vivo and in vitro.
