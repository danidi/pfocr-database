caption: Model for the regulation of type 1 interferon signalling by filamin B. IFN-α
  binds to the IFNR and this induces the formation of a complex of filamin B bound
  to a specific JNK signalling module, Rac1–MEKK1–MKK4–JNK, at the plasma membrane.
  Filamin B and JNK can mediate IFN-α-induced apoptosis, potentially by upregulating
  the expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as TRAIL-R1. IFN-α stimulation of cells
  also leads to the expression of ISG15, in part mediated by the JAK–STAT pathway
  and possibly by JNK. ISG15 conjugates to filamin B and interferes with its binding
  to components of the JNK module, thereby downregulating JNK signalling and protecting
  cells from apoptosis. Cell fate might therefore be determined by the balance between
  non-modified and ISG15-modified forms of filamin B. IFN-α, interferon-α; IFNR, interferon
  receptor; ISG15, IFN-stimulated gene 15; JAK–STAT, Janus kinase–signal transducer
  and activator of transcription; JNK, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; MEKK1, mitogen-activated
  extracellular-signal-regulated kinase kinase 1; MKK4, mitogen-activated protein
  kinase kinase 4; TRAIL-R1, tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
  receptor 1.
