caption: (A) Autoradiograph showing representative sections of typical protein array
  phosphorylation assays performed using the four viral kinases. All substrates are
  printed in duplicate. The rectangle highlights a common substrate, Pumilio2.(B)
  Venn diagram illustrating the overlap in substrate specificity of the herpesvirus
  protein kinases. Of 643 total substrates, the highlighted 110 host proteins were
  phosphorylated by at least three kinases. See also (C) Interaction network for the
  110 shared host proteins. Proteins are color-coded by their functional classes.
  An asterisk indicates the enriched functional class of 19 proteins involved in the
  DDR. Proteins in the inner oval (light yellow) are nuclear proteins while the proteins
  in the outer ring are in other cellular compartments. Edges between the proteins
  represent known or predicted connections, such as protein-protein interactions,
  catalytic reactions, and enzyme-substrate relationships, obtained from the database
  STRING (http://string-db.org/). Note that ATM was not present on the human protein
  array. See also .
