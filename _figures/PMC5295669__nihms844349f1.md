caption: 'Double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways. Different DNA synthesis steps
  are indicated by the DNA polymerase symbol. New DNA synthesis (broken lines) plays
  a role in all DSB repair pathways, including single-strand annealing (SSA), nonhomologous
  end joining (NHEJ), and its variants, microhomology-mediated end joining/alternative
  end-joining (MMEJ/alt-EJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Although HR is the
  only pathway that produces a double Holliday Junction (dHJ), it can also proceed
  by pathways that do not involve dHJ formation, such as synthesis-dependent strand
  annealing (SDSA) and break-induced replication (BIR). Abbreviation: D-loop, displacement
  loop.'
