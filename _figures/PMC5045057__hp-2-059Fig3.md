caption: 'Pathways of FH, SDH, and IDH mutations leading to tumorigenesis.Notes: (A)
  FH, SDH, IDH mutations result in the accumulation of fumarate, succinate, and (R)-2HG,
  respectively. During incipient tumor development, accumulation of fumarate inhibits
  KEAP1, thereby activating the NRF2 antioxidant response and resulting in renal cyst
  development. Similarly, succinate has been shown to inhibit PHD3-mediated apoptosis
  of neuronal cells during embryonic development, resulting in hyperplasia in the
  sympathoadrenal tissues. (R)-2HG stimulates PHD activity as a cosubstrate and reduces
  HIF signaling for glial and leukemic transformation. (B) During tumor progression,
  increased levels of fumarate, succinate, and (R)-2HG all share a common pathway
  by inhibiting the JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases (KDM) and the TET
  family of DNA hydroxylases. This leads to genome-wide DNA hypermethylation and tumorigenesis.
  Furthermore, increased levels of fumarate and succinate, as well as decreased levels
  of 2OG inhibit the HIF prolyl hydroxylases to activate the HIF signaling. Inhibited
  steps are shaded.Abbreviations: SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; FH, fumarate hydratase;
  IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein;
  KEAP1, kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1; (R)-2HG, (R)-enantiomer of 2-hydroxyglutarate;
  NRF2, nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2; 2OG, 2-oxoglutarate; HIF, hypoxia-inducible
  factor.'
