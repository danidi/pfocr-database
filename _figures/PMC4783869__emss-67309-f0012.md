caption: In this model, pathologic stress leads to increased expression of HIF1α and
  HIF1α-dependent activation of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes and the splicing
  factor SF3B1. SF3B1, in turn, assembles at the branch-point sequence upstream of
  exon 3C of KHK pre-mRNA leading to an inclusion of this exon and KHK-C protein production.
  This shift in isoform expression from KHK-A to KHK-C in response to HIF1α–SF3B1
  pathway activation drives KHK-C-dependent fructose uptake via stimulation of GLUT5
  expression, the conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) and contributes
  simultaneously to the activation of glucose uptake and metabolism through a yet-to-be-determined
  mechanism. The model holds that the unrestrained conversion of fructose to F1P by
  KHK-C limits ATP levels, thereby alleviating potential allosteric inhibition of
  phosphofructokinase (PFK) by ATP to maintain a high glycolytic flux. F1P is further
  metabolized to dehydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde (GA). While
  DHAP serves as a precursor for glycerol synthesis, GA can be further converted to
  glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a key glycolytic intermediate. G3P can be channelled
  into the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) supporting nucleic and amino
  acid biosynthesis. This metabolic constellation, created by the activation of the
  HIF1α–SF3B1–KHK-C axis, increases macromolecular biosynthetic capacity essential
  for hypertrophic growth, steatosis and cardiac dysfunction. HKII and F-1,6-BP denotes
  hexokinase II and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, respectively.
