caption: CRAd replication cycle resulting in target cell oncolysis. A schematics illustrating
  the basic mechanism of CRAd-mediated cell killing starting with binding of a CRAd
  particle to a tumor-specific cell surface receptor(s). This is followed by viral
  internalization via the endosome pathway and subsequent capsid disintegration and
  trafficking of the released genomic DNA (still complexed with core proteins) to
  the nucleus, where the recombinant genomic DNA is transcribed to produce mRNAs coding
  for viral proteins. Following mRNA transport into the cytoplasm and its translation
  into virus-specific proteins, adenoviral progeny particles are assembled from capsomers
  in the nucleus, following nuclear import of the Ad structural proteins. Ad progeny
  is then released form the infected cells via a replication-dependent (onco)lytic
  mechanism.
