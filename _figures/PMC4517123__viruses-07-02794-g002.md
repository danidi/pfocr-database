caption: Innate immune sensing of rhabdovirus infection. In rhabdovirus-infected cells,
  the viral RNA is mainly detected by RIG-I. Once activated, RIG-I binds to the CARD
  containing adaptor protein IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, CARDIF or VISA), which phosphorylates
  IRF3 and/or IRF7 through TRAF3, NAP1 and TBK1/IKKε. Phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7
  homodimerize and translocate into the nucleus where they induce the expression of
  Type I IFN genes. IPS-1 also interacts with FADD, a death domain-containing adapter
  involved in death receptor signaling, and RIP1, which induces the activation of
  the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB is composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members
  of the Rel family. The most common and best-characterized form of NF-κB is the p65/p50
  heterodimer. A new member RelAp43 (p43) of the NF-κB family has been recently identified.
  Activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, consisting of catalytic kinase subunits
  (IKKα and/or IKKβ) and the regulatory non-enzymatic scaffold protein NEMO, results
  in the phosphorylation and subsequence degradation of IκB. This enables free NF-κB
  to translocate to the nucleus, where it induces target gene expression, including
  pro-inflammatory cytokine encoding genes. The steps inhibited by the RABV-N and
  -P proteins, as well as VSV M protein are indicated in the diagram above.
