caption: 'Different utilization strategies of inorganic nitrogen (N) source for the
  maintenance of ATP production caused by the difference in the O2 supply ability
  in wetland plants under O2-deficient condition. NAD(P)H produced mainly during glycolysis,
  lipid breakdown, and photosynthesis is oxidized to NAD(P)+ by the following two
  pathways competing for the oxidation, assimilation, and catabolic reduction of NO3−:
  NO2−-driven ATP production (A) or fermentation (B). The oxidation of NAD(P)H is
  shown by red letters and arrows. (A) As the species with high O2 supply ability
  can accelerate nitrification in their rhizosphere by high radial O2 loss (ROL) from
  the roots, they can utilize NO2− produced from NO3− by hypoxia-induced nitrate reductase
  (NR) as the electron acceptor in the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC)
  instead of O2. NO2−-driven ATP production enables NAD(P)H oxidation for regulating
  glycolysis, avoiding cytosolic anoxia, and anaerobic ATP synthesis, which is in
  the same order as that in the ATP through fermentation during hypoxia. Moreover,
  species with high potential for NR can oxidize NAD(P)H for N assimilation, and these
  species can acquire a large amount of N and productivity by the “synergistic effect
  of NH4+ and NO3−”. (B) The species with low O2 supply ability specializing in the
  assimilation of NH4+ that dominates the anaerobic soil may oxidize NAD(P)H through
  fermentation. NAD(P)H levels in the A and B pathway are regulated by glycolysis
  with pyrophosphate (PPi) utilization by PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK-PPi)
  and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) instead of ATP and metabolisms of major amino
  acids such as the alanine, glutamate, 2-oxoglutarate, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
  Thus, in wetland plants, A and B pathways function as the N utilization strategy
  in maintaining the ATP production under anaerobic conditions. Abbreviations are
