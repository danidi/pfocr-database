caption: Ubiquitin signaling in the activation and deactivation of the IMD pathway
  signaling. Following PGN recognition and the assembly of a receptor proximal signaling
  complex, IMD signaling proceeds through at least two distinct paths. Both paths
  require the proteolytic activity of DREDD, which presumably acts as part of this
  receptor proximal complex. Once activated, DREDD cleaves Relish, which is necessary
  for its activation, nuclear translocation and induction of target genes. DREDD also
  likely cleaves IMD, exposing an IBM at position 31. Cleaved IMD then interacts with
  IAP2 and is robustly and transiently conjugated with K63-polyubiquitin chains. These
  chains are thought to serve as a scaffold for both the TAK1/TAB2 complex, through
  NZF domain of TAB2, and the IKK complex, through the IKKγ subunit. The IKK complex
  then phosphorylates Relish, which is important for its activation, and contributes
  in a non-catalytic manner to Relish cleavage. The IMD pathway is also subject to
  numerous negative regulatory controls, including deubiquitination of IMD by dUSP36.
  IMD may then be re-ubiquitinated with K48-chains and degraded. Likewise, the ubiquitin-proteasome
  system is implicated in the control of TAK1, DREDD and Relish by POSH, DNR1 and
  the SCF complex respectively.
