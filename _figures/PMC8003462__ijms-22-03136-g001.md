caption: '(A) Physiological functions of the various kinases included in the PKR/p38/RIPK1
  pathway. PKR controls the initiation of protein translation, the partial replication
  of viruses during infections, and is involved in the modulation of inflammatory
  signals associated with innate immunity and apoptosis. p38 is implicated in cell
  proliferation and cell death as well as inflammatory pathways. RIPK1 controls necroptosis
  (associated with RIPK3) and modulates cytokine release and inflammation. (B) Pathological
  consequences of the activation of the PKR/p38/RIPK1 pathway during neuronal stress
  and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The abnormal activation of this pathway in the brain
  is linked to Aβ oligomers’ accumulation in AD brains and can lead to increased levels
  of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1BACE1, inducing more Aβ synthesis, and to enhanced
  synthesis of the tau protein and its abnormal phosphorylation. In addition, neuroinflammatory,
  apoptosis, and necroptosis signals are highly exacerbated upon activation of the
  PKR/p38/RIPK1 pathological signaling pathway in AD. Note: Eukaryotic translation
  initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 2 (PKR); receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein
  kinase 1 (RIPK1); receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3);
  dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (MKK6); MAP kinase-activated
  protein kinase 2 (MK2).'
