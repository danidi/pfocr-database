caption: The conserved ATR→CHK1 checkpoint signaling pathway in eukaryotes (, ). ssDNA
  can be formed as an intermediate structure during DNA repair or DNA replication.
  RPA binds to ssDNA, which then recruits ATR-ATRIP by interacting with ATRIP. RPA
  may also work with RAD17-RFC to load the 9-1-1 (RAD9-RAD1-HUS1) checkpoint clamp
  to the 5′ recessed junction. TopBP1 interacts with ATRIP-ATR and phosphorylated
  Rad9 in the 9-1-1 clamp. The ATR-activating domain of TopBP1 stimulates the kinase
  activity of ATR. ATR can phosphorylate the effector kinase CHK1 and Rad9 of 9-1-1
  complex (dashed arrows and P letter in red). Phosphorylation of CHK1 by ATR requires
  the mediator Claspin that recruits CHK1 to the DNA damage site (, ). Note that the
  in vitro checkpoint system described in PNAS () represents a major part of the pathway
  that does not include 9-1-1 and Claspin.
