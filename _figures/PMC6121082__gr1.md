caption: 'Schematic Overview of Salt Stress-Induced Changes in Auxin Biosynthesis,
  Conjugation, and Transport-Related Processes in the Arabidopsis Roots. (A) Indole-3-acetic
  acid (IAA) metabolism. The level of IAA is tightly regulated by IAA biosynthesis,
  conjugation, and degradation, together determining the IAA status of a cell. The
  lower panel shows part of the known IAA biosynthesis (,  for a complete overview)
  and conjugation pathways and the known involved genes or gene families. Based on
  microarray data of two different studies (Table S1), we have identified gene expression
  patterns with promising possibilities for influencing eventual IAA accumulation
  patterns and signaling. For genes in the IAOx pathway we observe strong expression
  in zone 4 (C), which is the zone containing primordia and lateral roots. All genes
  are also influenced by salt stress in a time-dependent matter (Table S1). We see
  a similar pattern for DAO1 and DAO2. Both DAO1 and CYP79B2-3 have been linked to
  lateral root development and show expression specifically underlying newly formed
  lateral roots. YUCCA 3, 5, 8, and 9, together with the GH3 family genes, show upregulation
  in the epidermis and cortex during salt stress, whereas they are downregulated in
  the columnella (B). (B) Auxin transport. During salt stress, expression of the auxin
  efflux carriers PIN1, PIN7, and ABCB19 in the stele is downregulated. In the columnella,
  PIN3 and PIN7 are downregulated. In epidermal and cortical cells, PIN2 and ABCB4
  auxin efflux carriers are downregulated whereas ABCB1 is slightly upregulated. In
  epidermal cells, on a cellular level, PIN2 is internalized and changes in AUX1 abundance
  at the plasma membrane during halotropism were observed, providing evidence that
  AUX1 is also internalized . Putatively, the activity of the tonoplast-located WAT1
  undergoes changes to alter intracellular auxin levels following a change in cytosolic
  pH. To create local auxin maxima, the passive flow of IAA− molecules through the
  plasmodesmata (PD) might need to be blocked. This is putatively achieved through
  GSL8-mediated callose deposition. The apoplastic pH increase following salt exposure
  of the root potentially inhibits the passive influx of IAAH into the cell. Blue
  arrows depict auxin flow, grey boxes show up- (green arrow) or downregulation (red
  arrow) of genes during salt stress. Black boxes show plasma-membrane proteins that
  are internalized upon salt stress. Question marks show processes that influence
  local auxin concentrations but have not yet been proved to be involved in local
  auxin changes during abiotic stress. Abbreviations: IAA−, ionized IAA; IAA-glc,
  IAA-glucose; IAAH, protonated IAA; IAN, indole-3-acetonitrile; IAOx, indole-3-acetaldoxime;
  IPyA, indole-3-pyruvic acid; oxIAA, oxidized IAA (2-oxindole-3-acetic acid); PD,
  plasmodesma; Trp, tryptophan.'
