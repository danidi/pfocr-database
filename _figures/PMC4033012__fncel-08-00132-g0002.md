caption: Schematic representation of the NALCN channelosome. The NALCN ion channel
  interacts with the M3 muscarinic receptor (M3R) that activates the channel through
  a G protein-independent and Src Family of Tyrosine Kinases (SFK)-dependent pathway
  upon activation by acetylcholine (Swayne et al., ). UNC-80 interacts with NALCN
  and SFKs and acts as a scaffolding protein (Wang and Ren, ; Lu et al., ). In addition,
  UNC-80 is involved in the expression levels of NALCN and UNC-79 as well as their
  neuronal localization (Jospin et al., ; Yeh et al., ). UNC-79 interacts with UNC-80
  but not NALCN and is involved in the expression levels and the neuronal localization
  of NALCN and UNC-80 (Yeh et al., ). CaSR was found to regulate NALCN channel activity
  by an uncharacterized mechanism involving G-proteins activation and UNC-80 (Lu et
  al., ). For clarity, NLF-1, an endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein that interacts
  with NALCN and is possibly involved in its folding is shown apart. It is not known
  whether the interactions mentioned above are direct or not.
