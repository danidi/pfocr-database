caption: 'Autophagy Signaling During Arbovirus Infection.There are five possible mechanisms
  for modulating viral replication which include: a) some arboviruses such as DENV
  and JEV can use amphisome formation for their entry and replication; b) several
  arboviruses such as DENV, ZIKV, JEV, CHIKV and TBEV exert diverse mechanisms to
  induce autophagosome formation to enhance viral replication/translation complexes.
  DENV is associated with NS4A in up-regulating PI3K-dependent autophagy. CHIKV induces
  the IRE1α–XBP-1 pathway in conjunction with ROS-mediated mTOR inhibition; c) DENV
  benefits from autophagy activation by using lipid droplets as an energy source for
  replication; d) Viruses such as DENV-2 and CHIKV can increase their replication
  by prolonging cell survival and preventing cell death; and d) VSV appears to suppress
  IFN signaling by conjugated Atg5-Atg12, leading to an effective virus-suppressing
  immune response [modified from []] . DENV: Dengue virus; ZIKV: Zika virus; JEV:
  Japanese encephalitis virus; CHIKV: Chikungunya virus; TBEV: tick-borne encephalitis
  virus; VSV: vesicular stomatitis virus.'
