caption: 'The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) as a nutrient sensor. Glucose
  is transported into the cell and phosphorylated to form glucose-6-phosphate (Glu-6-P).
  Glu-6-P may be converted to glycogen or further metabolized through glycolysis [Glu-6-P
  converted to F-6-P to triose-phosphate (Triose-P)]. A small amount (∼1%) of Glu-6-P
  is diverted through HBP by the enzyme GFAT to form UDP-Glc-NAc, the major substrate
  for O-linked or N-linked glycosylation of intracellular proteins, which induces
  expression of various peptides. This pathway may be activated by any nutrient: Increased
  glucose will increase Glc-6-P levels and flux through the HBP; increased FFAs inhibit
  glycolysis and increase Glc-6-P levels and flux through the HBP; and increased amino
  acids increase the rate-limiting enzyme GFAT. If a nutrient-dependent flux increases
  severalfold (equivalent to only 3–6% of intracellular glucose), it can serve as
  a potent switch for glycosylation of transcription factors, activating the expression
  of harmful peptides and the induction of insulin resistance.'
