caption: Summary of function of Wnt pathway during thymic T cell development. Black
  triangles indicates the important events during T cell development. Arrows indicate
  the developmental stages that Wnt pathway potentially has important regulatory function.
  ETP, early T cell progenitors. Note that TCF-1 also plays a critical role in T cell
  lineage specification at “ETP-DN1-DN2a” stage, which is not shown in the figure.
