caption: Leukemia-cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing natural killer
  (NK) cell function. NK cells are able to recognize acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
  blasts in a major histocompatibility complex-unrestricted manner inducing cell lysis
  through perforin/granzyme pathway. Within tumor microenvironment, regulatory T lymphocytes
  and MSCs play a role in inhibiting NK cell-mediated proliferation and cytotoxic
  function via the production of soluble factors, such as interleukin (IL)-10, transforming
  growth factor (TGF)-β, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), thus resulting in
  the downregulation of activating receptors (NKp30, NK944, and NKG2D) and in the
  upregulation of inhibitory receptors. Similar evasion mechanisms have been described
  as a consequence of a direct effect from AML cells on NK cells.
