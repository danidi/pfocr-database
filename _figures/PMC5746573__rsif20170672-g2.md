caption: Ca2+ and ROS crosstalk between ER and mitochondria, with emphasis on redox
  control of the MCU. (a) In a non-excitable cell exposed to a chemical agonist, binding
  of the agonist to a cell surface receptor activates the GP/PLC/IP3pathway. IP3 activates
  the IP3R and causes Ca2+ release from the ER. Both mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via
  the MCU and Ca2+ release via the mNCX differentially regulate the activation of
  IP3R in the MAM region (because IP3R is also regulated by Ca2+) and, thus, play
  a role in shaping the [Ca2+]i transients and oscillations in response to the agonist.
  Mitochondrial Ca2+ release is thought to also help refill the ER via the SERCA.
  High [Ca2+]m stimulates respiratory chain activity, leading to higher amounts of
  mROS. MROS can target the MCU and, following diffusion in the MAM region, the IP3R
  and SERCA, further amplifying the disruption of Ca2+ and ROS homeostasis. (Adapted
  from [,].) (b) The MCU senses mROS via oxidation of the matrix-facing Cys-97. S-glutathionylation
  of Cys-97 induces a conformational change (and causes channel clustering; not shown)
  leading to increased MCU activity/mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. (Adapted from [,].)
