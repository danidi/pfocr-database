caption: This possible mechanism suggests that fluoride can combine with other ions
  (X) to mimic the chemical structure of γ-phosphate. Upon entering the cells, ion/fluoride
  complex (XFn) (such as AlF4) can bind to GDP, together to activate Gαq protein in
  ameloblasts, which in turn activates phospholipase C β (PLCβ) that cleaves phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into diacyl glycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
  (IP3). Increased DAG sequentially activates PKC, which can then phosphorylate SATB1.
  SATB1 can be hydrolyzed by caspase-6, while phosphorylation prevents SATB1 from
  hydrolyzing by caspase-6, resulting in an apparent relative increase in SATB1 in
  cells.
