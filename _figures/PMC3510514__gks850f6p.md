caption: Model for the role of Spartan in DNA damage tolerance. We suggest that at
  the stalled replication fork, the Rad6-Rad18-dependent PCNA ubiquitylation and the
  USP1-dependent PCNA deubiquitylation are dynamic processes, of which balance determines
  the life-time of ubiquitin-PCNA and the choice of fork rescue mechanism. In the
  absence of ubiquitin-PCNA, replication fork can be rescued by recombination-dependent
  mechanisms, which, however, have a potential for DNA rearrangements. In the presence
  of ubiquitin-conjugated-PCNA, damage bypass or template switching can provide replication
  through the lesion without the formation of a DSB intermediate. Spartan can provide
  one regulatory level by binding to ubiquitin-modified PCNA, which protects against
  PCNA deubiquitylation by USP1. Thus, Spartan can channel the reviving of stalled
  replication from a recombination-dependent pathway that does not require PCNA ubiquitylation
  to PCNA ubiquitylation-dependent translesion synthesis or PCNA polyubiquitylation-dependent
  template switching pathways.
