caption: Signaling pathways involved in the action of A3AR agonists. Pathways proposed
  to be involved in anticancer, antiinflammatory, and cardioprotective effects of
  A3AR agonists. A3AR signals through both G protein-dependent (via Gi or β,γ subunits)
  and independent pathways. Translocation of arrestin to the A3AR would be associated
  with receptor downregulation [] and G protein-independent signaling. Not all pathways
  are present in all circumstances, and other pathways not shown can also affect cell
  survival, proliferation, and differentiation. In cancer (blue arrows), activation
  of the A3AR corrects an imbalance in the downstream Wnt signaling pathway [,]. Administration
  of an A3 agonist to activate its cell surface receptor inhibits the formation of
  cAMP and indirectly decreases phosphorylation (and therefore decreased inactivation)
  of the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3β. The resulting increased phosphorylation of
  β-catenin causes it to be removed from the cytoplasm by ubiquitination and therefore
  preventing its nuclear import. This results in a net suppression of cyclin D1 and
  c-myc, which leads to cell growth inhibition. With respect to cancer, NF-κB is a
  potent anti-apoptotic agent in malignant cells and its activation is strongly associated
  with tumors []. Additionally, as a major cell survival signal, NF-κB is involved
  in multiple steps in carcinogenesis and in cancer cells‘ resistance to chemo- and
  radiotherapy. Thus, drugs aimed to decrease expression or activity of NF-κB could
  abrogate its anti-apoptotic effect. In inflammatory models [,,,,,], the reduced
  activation of NF-κB (in synoviocytes, neutrophils, and other immune cells) has an
  antiinflammatory effect, in part by reducing the expression of TNF-α. Opposite effects
  of A3AR activation on some of these pathways (green arrows) are associated with
  myeloprotective (via increased NF-κB in splenocytes []) and cardioprotective (GSK-3β
  inhibition []) responses to A3AR agonists. In the heart, there are opposing effects
  of GSK-3β at different stages of prolonged ischemia (GSK-3β protects) and reperfusion
  (GSK-3β inhibition protects) [].
