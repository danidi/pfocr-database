caption: The induction of ER stress and UPR during coronavirus infection. Coronavirus
  infection induces ER stress and activates UPR. Activated ATF6 transcriptionally
  induces XBP1, ER chaperones and enzymes to enhance the ER folding capacity. Activated
  IRE1 mediates splicing of the XBP1 mRNA, whereas the spliced XBP1 protein enhances
  ER folding and reduces ER burden by promoting ERAD. Activated PERK mediates the
  phosphorylation of eIF2α, leading to a global translation attenuation. Signaling
  via the ATF4-CHOP pathway promotes apoptosis induction during prolonged ER stress.
  The known coronaviruses and viral proteins modulating the UPR signaling are also
  indicated. Green arrows are activating and red blunt arrows are inhibiting. See
  text for detail.
