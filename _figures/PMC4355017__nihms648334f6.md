caption: 'RAS-mutant cancer cells are characterized by increased macropinocytosis
  and uptake of albumen, leading to lysosomal degradation and release of amino acids.
  RAS-mutant cancer cells also exhibit altered autophagy, leading to degradation of
  organelles and proteins, and to production of amino acids and other components that
  support metabolism. Oncogenic K-Ras directs glucose metabolism into biosynthetic
  pathways in PDAC by upregulating many key enzymes in glycolysis. Oncogenic K-Ras
  induces nonoxidative PPP flux to fuel increased nucleic acid biosynthesis and activates
  the hexosamine biosynthesis and glycosylation pathways. PDAC cells also utilize
  a non-canonical pathway to process glutamine and use it to maintain redox status
  and support growth. Blue text indicates Ras-dependent gene and/or protein expression,
  with arrows indicating increased (green) or decreased (red) expression. Enzymes
  are indicated in italics. Abbreviations used are: Glut1, glucose transporter 1;
  Hk 1/2, hexokinase 1/2; Pfk1, phosphofructokinase 1; Eno1, enolase 1; Pkm, pyruvate
  kinase; Ldha, lactate dehydrogenase A; Gfpt1, glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase-1;
  GlcN, glucosamine; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; Rpe, ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase;
  Rpia, ribulose-5-phosphate isomerase; GLUD1, glutamate dehydrogenase 1; GLS1, glutaminase
  1; GOT1/2, aspartate transaminase 1/2; MDH1, malate dehydrogenase 1; ME1, malic
