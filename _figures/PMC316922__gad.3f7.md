caption: Models for the possible action of FAR1. (A) Genetic models of the pathway
  of phytochrome signal transduction. In the multiple-pathway model (i) specific and
  shared signaling components can transduce signals independently of one another.
  In the alternative single-pathway model shown (ii), loci specific to a single phytochrome-signaling
  pathway (e.g., FAR1) are shown upstream of those components shared by multiple pathways
  (e.g., PIF3). (B) Speculative molecular modes of action for FAR1. Although we speculate
  in A that FAR1 is upstream of PIF3 on the basis of genetic data, its biochemical
  action may lie before that of PIF3 (i) or after it (ii). Either could produce a
  specific effect on phyA signaling.
