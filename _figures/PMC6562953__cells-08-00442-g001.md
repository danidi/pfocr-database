caption: RKIP protein as a signaling modulator in lung cancer. On the left, RKIP binds
  to the Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) preventing the proteolytic cleavage by
  the γ-secretase complex. Furthermore, in the Notch1 pathway, RKIP inhibits the translocation
  of NICD to the nucleus, which would then activate the translocation of EMT-related
  genes, ultimately promoting cell invasion and metastasis. In the middle, RKIP binds
  to Raf, preventing the phosphorylation of MEK by Raf and consequently, Raf/MEK/ERK/STAT3
  signaling is inhibited. This will enhance events such as angiogenesis, proliferation
  and metastization. Additionally, RKIP blocks Snail through MAPK inhibition and NF2
  stabilization. In the nucleus, SNAIL acts as a p53 suppressor and upon this EMT
  related-processes will occur. On the right, RKIP act as an inhibitor of the Shh
  signaling pathway. RKIP binds to the SMO receptor, keeping it inactive and preventing
  Gli1 transcription, and promoting therapy resistance and stem cell activation.
