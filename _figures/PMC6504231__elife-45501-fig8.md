caption: (A) In wild-type (WT) mice, MRSA produces SEB, which bridges between T cells
  and dendritic cells by interacting with TCR and MHCII, leading to the production
  of IL-21 by CD4+ T cells. IL-21 stimulates neutrophils to release granzymes, with
  enhanced killing of MRSA. Type I IFN (e.g., produced by dendritic cells, as shown
  in the cartoon) can also induce granzyme production to promote killing of MRSA,
  but IL-21 inhibits dendritic cell production of type I IFN. (B) In the absence of
  either IL-21R or a functional STAT3 signaling response, the IL-21-induced neutrophil
  granzyme production does not occur. However, IL-21-mediated repression of type I
  IFN production by dendritic cells also no longer occurs, which leads to enhanced
  production of type I IFN and hence increased killing of MRSA through this pathway.
  The functional cross-talk of and relative potency of the IL-21- and type 1 IFN-mediated
  pathways and levels of each cytokine influence the outcome.
