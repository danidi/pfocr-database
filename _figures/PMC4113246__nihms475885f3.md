caption: Tbx18 is specifically expressed in cells of the SAN “head” region and is
  required for its morphogenesis in part by repressing Cx43, although the downstream
  effectors of this pathway remain largely uncharacterized. While Tbx5 activates chamber-specific
  genes in atrial cells along with Nkx2.5, Tbx5 likely acts as a competence factor
  for the SAN by activating Shox2 expression, which in turn directly represses Nkx2.5
  transcription within this cell type. Nkx2.5 is typically expressed in a mutually
  exclusive manner in surrounding atrial myocytes, where it represses HCN4 and Tbx3
  expression and activates transcription of the chamber-specific genes ANF, Cx40,
  and Cx43. Tbx3 is also specifically expressed in the SAN and works by preventing
  expression of chamber-specific genes. Left sinus horn (LSH) pacemaker tissue is
  prevented from forming by Pitx2, which inhibits Shox2 expression.
