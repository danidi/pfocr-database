caption: An active invadopodia NADPH oxidase complex containing a Tks protein family
  as an organizer generates ROS (dots) that locally amplify the tyrosine-phosphorylation
  signal initiated by Src-dependent phosphorylation of Tks proteins. The intensity
  and/or duration of the Tks tyrosine phosphorylation could be modulated by ROS through
  direct activation of Src or by inactivation of the phosphatase PTP-PEST, which may
  in turn dephosphorylate Src or Tks organizers. Dashed lines with question marks
  denote putative interactions.
