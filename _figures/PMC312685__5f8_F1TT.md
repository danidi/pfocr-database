caption: 'Model for regulation of Snf1 kinase activity and localization by two distinct
  glucose signaling pathways. Snf1 complexes contain one of the three β subunits:
  Gal83 (black), Sip2 (dark gray), or Sip1 (light gray). Inactive Snf1 kinase complexes
  are depicted in a closed conformation in which the Snf1 catalytic domain is autoinhibited
  by the Snf1 regulatory domain. Active Snf1 complexes are shown in an open conformation
  and are phosphorylated (P). High glucose inhibits (indicated by a bar) the activation
  of the Snf1 kinase, and Hxk2 and Reg1 are required for this inhibition. Glucose
  and other fermentable carbon sources inhibit the nuclear localization of Snf1 complexes
  containing Gal83, and evidence cited in the text suggests that glucose-6-phosphate
  (Glucose-6P) is necessary and sufficient for this inhibition. This pathway also
  may regulate the vacuolar localization of Sip1 (not shown; see text).'
