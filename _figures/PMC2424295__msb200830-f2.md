caption: Feedback loops in NF-κB signaling. IKK may be activated by the TNFα signaling
  pathway as well as the MyD88-dependent arm of the LPS signaling pathway. IKK leads
  to NF-κB activity, which is regulated by a negative feedback loop involving IκB
  (described in detail in ), as depicted in the lower center. TNFα-induced NF-κB activity
  also leads to A20 expression, and subsequent decrease in IKK activation. Also, the
  Trif-dependent arm of the LPS-signaling pathway activates the transcription factor
  interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF3), leading to TNFα expression and subsequent
  autocrine signaling. Thus, A20 and TNF form feedback loops that regulate NF-κB activity.
