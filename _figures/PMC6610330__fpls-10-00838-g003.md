caption: The pathway of membrane lipid biosynthesis in peanut. According to the substrate,
  the synthesis of triacylglycerol is divided into non-acyl-CoA dependent pathway
  and acyl-CoA dependent pathway. In the former, acyl groups transfer from phospholipid
  to diacylglycerol (DAG) to form triacylglycerol, and this step is catalyzed by phospholipid:diacylglycerol
  acyltransferase (PDAT). In the latter, glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) is catalyzed by
  glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT), lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase
  (LPAAT) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) in turn and added the aliphatic
  group. The red characters in figure indicate the key genes in the lipid synthesis
  that have been identified and proved to play a vital role in peanut abiotic stress.
