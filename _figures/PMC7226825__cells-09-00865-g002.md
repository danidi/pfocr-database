caption: 'Overview of the anti-inflammatory roles of GFLs and their receptors following
  air pollution, allergy, bacteria or virus infections. Depending on the type of inflammation,
  the release of GFLs by epithelial, glial or dendritic cells will lead to the activation
  of immune cells expressing GFRα and Ret, located in blood and near gut, corneal,
  skin and lung epitheliums. The consequences of the GFLs stimulation in the gut will
  lead to the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3, the activation of the TGF-β1 pathway, the
  upregulation of the tight junction proteins such as ZO-1 in epithelial cells and
  the downregulation of caspase 3, the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β
  and the MPO. In addition to the reduction of inflammatory cytokine secretion, GDNF
  contributes to the inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway by the corneal epithelial
  cells. In the lung environment, a decrease of IL-10 expressed by T cells or less
  release of IL-6 and TNF-α by the epithelial cells are observed. After allergic airway
  inflammation, the presence of NRTN will dampen the reaction through the downregulation
  of the Th2 cytokines. MPO: myeloperoxidase; DC: dendritic cells; B: B lymphocytes;
  NK: natural killer cells; ILC: innate lymphoid cells; HSC: hematopoietic stem cells;
  CD4: CD4+ helper T lymphocyte; CD8: CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte.'
