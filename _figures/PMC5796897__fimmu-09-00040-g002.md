caption: 'Schematic representation of the glycolytic pathway in different cell types.
  Metabolic intermediates such as lactate inhibit the PHD function, leading to accumulation
  of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) which regulates expression of several glycolytic
  enzymes. Importantly, HIF balances glucose metabolism: (1) by inducing expression
  of LDH, leading to conversion of pyruvate to lactate, (2) as well as dampening the
  entry of pyruvate in the TCA cycle through inhibition of PDH by pyruvate dehydrogenase
  kinase (PDK) overexpression. Particularly, cancer cells (CC: orange) show increased
  expression of PKM2, the limiting rate enzyme of glycolysis, favoring glucose metabolism.
  CCs as well as endothelial cells (ECs: pink) show increase expression of MCT, facilitating
  lactate uptake for oxidative phosphorylation. Pro-tumoral M2 macrophages (light
  blue) present increased expression of phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase
  3 (PFKFB3) isoform, enhancing glycolysis in these cells, whereas anti-tumoral M1
  (dark blue) express the low activity isoform PFKFB1. Activation of T cells (green)
  via TCR-CD28 leads to enhanced glycolysis essential for their effector functions
  in an mTOR/HIF-dependent manner.'
