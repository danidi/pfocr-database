caption: 125I seeds caused DNA damage to activate the sensory ATM/ATR kinases, finally
  results in cell apoptosis and G2/M arrest. At the same time, 125I seeds inhibit
  cells migration by inactivation VEGF-A/ERK pathway. VEGF-A which can increase p-ERK
  levels was inhibited by 125I seeds to regulate cellular proliferation, survival
  and migration.
