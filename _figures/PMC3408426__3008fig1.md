caption: Overview of the background and the computational methods. (A) The transcriptional
  circuit governing sulfur assimilation and methionine biosynthesis. (B) Overview
  of the preliminary bioinformatic analysis using met6Δ expression data to identify
  TFBMs for Met31p/Met32p and Cbf1p and to distinguish the functional roles of these
  TFs using a Web-based tool called Gene Ontology Term Finder (GOTF). (C) Overview
  of the use of TF-dependency analysis to compare TF-deletion mutants in order to
  identify and characterize genes that depend specifically on Met31p/Met32p, Cbf1p,
  or both. (D) Overview of the use of multiple regression and Student's t-test to
  identify differences between MET31 and MET32.
