caption: 'miRNAs modulating dendrite morphogenesis converge by targeting components
  of the actin remodeling complex and cross talk with each other via neuronal activity-dependent
  gene regulatory networks. (A) miRNA-124, miR-132, miR-134, and miR-138 have divergent
  effects on dendrite morphogenesis by targeting different components of the actin
  remodeling pathway. miRNA-124 and miR-134 reduce the activity of RAC1/LIMK1 signaling,
  whereby miR-124 targets RhoG and miR-134 targets Limk1. miRNA-132, in contrast,
  increases RAC1/LIMK1 activity by inhibiting p250Gap-mediated repression of RAC1.
  miRNA-138 increases Gα12/13 palmitoylation and downstream RhoA signaling by targeting
  the mRNA coding for the depalmitoylation enzyme APT1. An additional target of miR-134
  is the translational repressor PUM2 (Pumilio2) through which miR-134 promotes overall
  dendritogenesis. (B) Many of the miRNAs modulating dendrite morphogenesis engage
  in regulatory circuits with transcription regulators that respond to neuronal activity.
  One such regulatory circuit is formed around miR-132 (highlighted in blue), whose
  expression is induced by CREB downstream of neuronal activity. miRNA-132 itself
  may influence CREB activation via interfering with MECP2-induced expression of Bdnf,
  which forms a positive feedback loop with CREB. The regulation of miR-134 expression
  (in orange) seems to be more complex: miR-134 expression was found to be induced
  by MEF2 downstream of neuronal activity and inhibited by MECP2, which interferes
  with pri-miR-134 processing. miRNA-134, in turn, targets Creb and may thereby provide
  a negative feedback signal for activity-induced gene expression and also influence
  miR-132 transcription. Another regulatory hub involves miR-15a (in green), the expression
  of which is inhibited by MECP2. miRNA-15a targets Bdnf mRNA, thereby providing an
  alternative route through which MECP2 promotes Bdnf expression. MECP2 further represses
  expression of miR-137 by cooperating with SOX2. miRNA-137 inhibits neuronal maturation
  and dendrite morphogenesis by targeting the ubiquitin ligase MIB1.'
