caption: Proposed model of cell surface and intracellular mGlu5 receptor activation
  by glutamate. Topology of the intracellular mGlu5 receptor is based on ultrastructural,
  genetic, immunologic, and pharmacologic evidence. Glutamate release from presynaptic
  vesicles can activate cell surface mGlu5 receptors as well as be taken up postsynaptically
  via transporters such as excitatory EAAT3. EAAT3 is also present on intracellular
  membranes including the ER and the outer nuclear membrane, which allows glutamate
  access to intracellular mGlu5 receptors. Ca2+ within the nuclear envelope is continuous
  with the ER pool. Like plasma membrane receptors, intracellular mGlu5 receptors
  couple to the Gq/11/PLC/IP3pathway. DAG, diacylglycerol; EAAT, sodium-dependent
  excitatory amino acid transporter; Glu, glutamate; IP3R, IP3 receptor.
