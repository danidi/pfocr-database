caption: Multiple intracellular signal transduction pathways are activated by GH.
  GH (light blue) binds to the transmembrane GHR (dark blue) to initiate signaling
  pathways. Activated JAK2 (red) phosphorylates signaling molecules, including members
  of the Stat family (rectangular). Stats 1, 3, and 5a can participate in GH signaling
  (data not shown); however, Stat5b (dark green) is widely regarded as the principal
  transcriptional effector. JAK2 phosphorylation of Shc (green) begins a phosphorylation
  cascade of the MAPK pathway with activation of ERK (purple), whereas phosphorylation
  of IRS-1 triggers the PI3K (red) pathway. Noncanonical signaling independent of
  JAK2 through SRC (yellow) leading to activation of ERK has also been demonstrated.
  These pathways can then act on signaling effectors such as transcription factors
  (eg, C/EBPβ) to directly affect gene regulation or can lead to cross talk to impact
  the Stat pathway. Other inputs (shadowed arrow) may similarly alter GH signaling
  via multiple mechanisms including negative regulation of these pathways. IRS, insulin
  receptor substrate; c-Src, is the non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase.
