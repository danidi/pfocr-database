caption: Metabolic pathway based on phenolic profiling. The main pathway involved
  in monolignol biosynthesis is shown with a gray background. The relative increase
  and decrease in metabolite abundances in the three hpCAD poplar lines compared with
  the wild type are mapped on the pathway. Red round-cornered boxes represent significant
  increases and blue round-cornered boxes represent significant decreases in abundance.
  Dashed arrows indicate one or more proposed conversions. PAL, Phe ammonia lyase;
  C4H, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase; 4CL, 4-coumaric acid:CoA ligase; HCT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA
  shikimate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase; C3H, coumarate 3-hydroxylase; CSE, caffeoyl
  shikimate esterase; CCoAOMT, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase; CCR, cinnamoyl-CoA
  reductase; F5H, ferulate 5-hydroxylase; COMT, caffeate O-methyltransferase; CAD,
  cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase; HCALDH, hydroxycinnamaldehyde dehydrogenase; DBR,
  double-bond reductase. The activities of PAL, C4H, 4CL, HCT, CCoAOMT, CCR, F5H,
  COMT, and CAD poplar enzymes have been described by ; conversions with Kcat/KM >
  0.1 were considered as proven and represented with solid arrows, whereas conversions
  with Kcat/KM < 0.1 were considered as proposed and thus represented with dashed
  arrows. The β-oxidative side chain shortening of cinnamoyl-CoAs is a potential pathway
  toward the different benzoic acids (). DBR has been found to reduce the C7-C8 double
  bond of p-coumaraldehyde and coniferaldehyde in Arabidopsis (), but it also might
  reduce the corresponding hydroxycinnamoyl-CoAs (). The functions of a heterotrimeric
  C4H/C3H protein complex in the hydroxylation of p-coumaryl shikimate toward caffeoyl
  shikimate and a similar heterodimeric C4H/C3H protein complex that is able to convert
  p-coumaric acid directly into caffeic acid in poplar have been described by . The
  role of HCALDH in catalyzing the oxidation of coniferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde
  to their corresponding carboxylic acids has been shown in Arabidopsis (). The role
  of CSE in catalyzing the hydrolysis of caffeoyl shikimate to caffeic acid has been
  shown in Arabidopsis and Medicago truncatula, and evidence exists for a similar
  role of CSE in poplar (; ). The biosynthesis of hydroxycinnamate shikimate and quinate
  esters has been established in Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana benthamiana starting
  from their respective CoA thioesters via an HCT (). Glycosylation by UDP-glycosyltransferases
  of hydroxycinnamic acids has been described previously ().
