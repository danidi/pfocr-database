caption: Nucleotide-associated pathways in microglia. A toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist
  such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to the release of proinflammatory mediators
  such as interleukin (IL)-6 in an ATP-dependent manner. Signaling through P2X4 receptors
  enhances migration of microglia. Uridine triphosphate (UTP) binds to P2Y2/4, Uridine
  diphosphate (UDP) to P2Y6 and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to P2Y12, which results
  in a higher rate of phagocytosis. 2’,3’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is
  released from damaged cells and is metabolized by an extracellular pathway to 2’-
  and 3’-adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is then metabolized to adenosine. After
  adenosine has activated its A1 receptor, it possesses neuroprotective functions.
