caption: Model unifying proteostasis in ER and cytoplasm of Plasmodium falciparum
  in mechanisms of artemisinin resistance. Pathways of protein quality control in
  the ER and the cytoplasm stimulate concerted mechanisms of protein translation,
  translocation, vesicular export and additional chaperone functions to enable proteostasis
  and thereby restore proper folding of proteins and their function in a cell. A model
  is proposed for proteostasis pathways to rescue Plasmodium falciparum parasites
  from artemisinin-induced protein damage, proteopathy and death. In artemisinin-resistant
  parasites, K13 mutations prevent binding, ubiquitinylation and degradation of PfPI3K
  (step 1, []). This leads to an increase in the kinase and thereby its lipid product,
  PI3P (step 2) causing expansion of homeostatic PI3P-vesicles of proteostasis from
  the ER (step 3, []) that may underlie a mechanism of autophagy. In addition, these
  vesicles contain BiP, a key component of the ROSC. BiP is usually bound to UPR transmembrane
  receptors, but under conditions of stress disassociates from the membrane and binds
  to misfolded proteins, shifting equilibrium away from and activating UPR receptors.
  In P. falciparum, the UPR receptor, ER transmembrane sensor protein-kinase R (PKR)-like
  ER kinase (PERK, also known as PK4) has been shown to phosphorylate elongation initiation
  factor 2a (eIF2a), leading to translational repression, and a reduction of general
  protein synthesis in artemisinin resistant parasites (step 4, [). Increase in BiP
  transcript levels in vivo artemisinin resistance (step 5) [], may reflect a response
  linked to steps 4 and 3. The T-complex protein 1 (TCP1) ring complex (TRiC) chaperone
  transcript also increased in in vivo artemisinin resistance [] may enable misfolded
  proteins in the cytoplasm to become properly folded (step 6) appears associated
  with step 3 []. In the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway misfolded proteins
  bound and unfolded by BiP (step 5), are translocated to the cytoplasm, ubiquitinylated
  and degraded in the proteasome (through the ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway (step
  7). Misfolded proteins in the cytoplasm that are not rescued by TRiC maybe ubiquitinylated
  and targeted for degradation in the proteasome (step 8, []).
