caption: 'IPA identified ‘LXR/RXR activation’ as the canonical pathway with the highest
  predicted potential/significance of being affected by the altered levels of TTR,
  ApoA-I and GDI-2 in HepG2 cells that were treated with T. indica fruit extract.
  Lines between the proteins represent known interactions. Red nodes indicate overexpression
  of genes induced by the extract, which was based on our previous report . Abbreviation:
