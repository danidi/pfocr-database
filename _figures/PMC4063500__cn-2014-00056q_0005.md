caption: Hypothesis of the dual protective role of lithium’s action against tauopathies.Normally,
  tau binds microtubules to promote microtubule assembly, while hyperphosphorylated
  tau misfolds, disassembles from microtubules, and forms aberrant filamentous aggregates
  that give rise to neurofibrillary tangles. Lithium inhibited GSK3β activity, reduced
  the phosphorylation of tau, and enhanced the binding of tau to microtubules. Lithium
  inhibited GSK3β activity, decreased mTOR signaling, and finally enhanced soluble
  phosphorylated tau to be degraded into autophagosomes. Only soluble phosphorylated
  tau, not insoluble fibrillar tau, was degraded by the autophagic pathway. Both mechanisms
  finally led to enhanced binding of tau to microtubules.
