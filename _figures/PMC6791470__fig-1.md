caption: The related cytokine signaling pathways and transcription factors involved
  in Th9 cell differentiation. PU.1 can directly combine with the IL-9 promoter region
  and enhance the inhibition of GATA3 on Foxp3; IRF4, which is induced by TCR signaling,
  regulates the differentiation of Th9 cells through combining with IL-9 promoter
  region and promoting the interaction between EICE and PU.1, as well as coregulating
  with BATF and STAT6; Foxo1 affects the differentiation of Th9 cells by combining
  with the IL-9 promoter region and indirectly regulating PU.1; Blimp-1 represses
  the Th9 cell differentiation and IL-9 production through binding to PU.1. TGF-β-Smad2/4
  signaling regulates IL-9 expression by displacement of EZH2 to promote the differentiation
  of Th9 cells; IL-4 signaling promotes Th9 differentiation by activating STAT6 to
  repress Foxp3; TNF-α influences Th9 cell differentiation through TNFR2-STAT5 signaling
  pathway and NF-κB signaling pathway; OX40/OX40L axis affects the differentiation
  and IL-9 expression of Th9 cells by activating the NF-κB pathway. BATF, basic leucine
  zipper transcription factor; Blimp-1, B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1;
  GATA3, GATA-binding protein 3; IL, interleukin; IRF4, interferon regulatory factor
  4; NF-κB; STAT, signal transduction and transcription activator; TGF-β, transforming
  growth factor β; Th9, the helper T cell 9.
