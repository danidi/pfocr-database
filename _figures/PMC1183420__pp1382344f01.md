caption: Simplified 13-hydroxylation pathway of GA biosynthesis in vegetative tissue
  of pea. The enzymes that are cloned and characterized in pea are underlined. Corresponding
  mutants are given in parentheses. Diurnal steady-state expression of the characterized
  genes in response to diurnal temperature alternations has been investigated in this
  study.
