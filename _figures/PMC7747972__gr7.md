caption: Carotenoids Biofortification in Crops.(A) Schematic carotenoid biosynthesis
  pathway in plants and the expanded ketocarotenoids/astaxanthin-producing pathway
  in plants. The precursors of carotenoid biosynthesis are from the upstream plastidial
  2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. The foreign transgene-encoding
  enzymes (in blue) are phytoene synthase (PSY), bacterial carotene desaturase (CrtI),
  β-carotene hydroxylase (BHY), and β-carotene ketolase (BKT), which catalyze precursors
  of carotenoids to generate the target end-product astaxanthin in transgenic plants.
  The other enzymes (in black) are encoded by endogenous carotenogenic genes in plants.
