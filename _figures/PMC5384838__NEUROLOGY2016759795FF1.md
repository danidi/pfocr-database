caption: Schematic diagram of the neuromuscular junction illustrates presynaptic,
  synaptic, and postsynaptic proteins associated with CMS. Acetylcholine (ACh) is
  synthesized in the cytoplasm of neurons by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase
  (ChAT) and is then actively packed into cholinergic synaptic vesicles by the vesicular
  acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). During signal transmission, nerve impulses trigger
  exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, releasing ACh, which binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine
  receptor AChR, a ligand-gated sodium channel. If the resulting depolarization reaches
  a critical threshold, the voltage-gated sodium channel SCN4A opens, and rapid depolarization
  and contraction of the muscle fiber will occur. Presynaptic CMS can be caused by
  deficiency of ChAT or VAChT. Under normal conditions, acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
  terminates synaptic transmission by hydrolyzing acetylcholine. AChE is anchored
  to the postsynaptic basal lamina by a collagen-like subunit tail encoded by COLQ.
  Synaptic CMS is caused by mutations in COLQ, which lead to deficiency of endplate
  AChE and thus to prolonged cholinergic neurotransmission and desensitization of
  the AChR and excitotoxic endplate myopathy. β2-laminin is a basal lamina component.
  Rare deficiency of β2-laminin leads to reduced alignment between the motor endplate
  and the nerve terminal. Clustering of the AChRs is crucial for effective neurotransmission.
  Postsynaptic CMS is caused by mutations in the ε subunit (and occasionally other
  subunits) of AChR that lead to deficiency of the receptor, kinetic abnormalities,
  and rarely low conductance. Other components of the system are agrin, a neural peptide
  that activates a muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) via the agrin receptor LRP4 (low-density
  lipoprotein receptor–related protein 4). MuSK is coactivated by downstream of kinase-7
  (DOK7). Activated MuSK promotes AChR clustering through rapsyn. Plectin is a cytoskeletal
  linking protein. Mutations affecting any of these neuromuscular junction proteins
  can lead to CMS. CMS can also result from mutations in several N-glycosylation pathway
  proteins (GFPT1, DPAGT1, ALG2, and ALG14), primarily due to their effect on signaling
  by AChR.
