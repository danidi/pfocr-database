caption: Biased signalling from the β2-adrenoceptor in response to propranolol in
  CHO-K1 cells . The presence of different intracellular signalling proteins (e.g.
  Gαs or β-arrestin) bound to the β2-adrenoceptor provides an allosteric mechanism
  for reciprocal interaction between the signalling protein and the orthosteric ligand
  binding site. However, the extent to which a particular signalling pathway predominates
  will depend on both the affinity of ligands for particular receptor–effector complexes
  and the degree of compartmentalisation of these complexes within the cell.
