caption: Hypothetical model showing events during parasite entry inside macrophage
  in relation to stress-induced phosphorylation of LdeIF2α. As the parasite enters
  the macrophage, elevated temperature and ROS generated by an oxidative burst as
  a consequence of the host immune response or via administered drugs such as SAG
  or Amp B induce LdeIF2α phosphorylation through autophosphorylation of stress-responsive
  LdeIF2α kinases (PERK), which in turn decreases the global translation rate, providing
  the chance to upregulate redox homeostasis genes for parasite survival and also
  initiating promastigote-to-amastigote differentiation. Inside the phagolysosomal
  compartment, the cumulative effect of elevated temperature, acidic pH, and ROS brings
  about the transformation of promastigotes into amastigotes and stabilizes the nonmotile
  form by maintaining LdeIF2α phosphorylation, enabling parasites to adapt to the
  harsh environment. However, inhibition of stress-induced LdeIF2α phosphorylation
  due to GSK2606414 (GSK)-mediated blockage of autophosphorylation of LdeIF2α kinases
  (PERK) prevents the initiation of this stress-responsive pathway in parasites, leading
  to reduced survival and infectivity.
