caption: Ceramide is a biosynthetic hub in the sphingolipid (SL) pathway. De novo
  lineal biosynthesis of SLs leads to the irreversible point of reduction of dihydroceramide
  to ceramide. Ceramide is a central biosynthetic point from where different SLs are
  synthesized and might be interconverted. Ceramide can be phosphorylated to the bioactive
  SL ceramide 1–phosphate or glucosylated (or galactosylated, not shown) to glucosyl-ceramide,
  which is the first step to complex SLs. Ceramide can also be converted to sphingomyelin,
  an important structural compound of biological membranes. Finally, ceramide can
  be hydrolysed by ceramidases to sphingosine, which can be phosphorylated to sphingosine-1-phosphate,
  a pro-survival cellular signal. Sphingomyelinases (SMase) and ceramidases (CDase)
  enzyme reactions are indicated in the figure. R- different possible acyl chain length.
