caption: 'Model: a Src-Tks5-Nck signalling pathway in invadopodia. Interaction of
  tumour cells with the ECM activates Src and PtdIns(3,4)P2-dependent targeting of
  Tks5 to nascent invadopodia (). Phosphorylation of Tks5 at Y557/8 promotes the recruitment
  of Nck adaptor proteins via their SH2 domains. Nck-associated N-WASP (possibly linked
  via the intermediate WIP) activates Arp2/3-mediated actin network assembly, potentially
  facilitating protrusive and/or trafficking events. How and whether these processes
  are linked to ECM degradation is not known. Tks5 can also associate with N-WASP
  via its SH3 domains () or possibly, via Y619 and Grb2. Inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases
  and actin polymerization provoke Y557 phosphorylation and Nck association.'
