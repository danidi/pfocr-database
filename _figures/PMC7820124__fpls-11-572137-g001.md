caption: Schematic representation of major transcription factors and transcriptional
  network involved in drought stress response. Drought stress is perceived by plant
  in an unclear mechanism, which induces the biosynthesis of ABA. ABA signaling, in
  turn, activates several TF families, including AREB, NF-Y, WRKY, and MYB. There
  are ABA-independent TFs involved in drought stress, such as DREB2A, HD-ZIP, MYC2,
  and several NACs. These TFs, individually or cooperatively, regulate plant growth
  and development, metabolism, and expression of stress-inducible genes, such as RD22
  and ERD1. Arrows and bars indicate activation and inhibition of the expression of
  downstream genes, respectively. Components in the gray background denote the ABA-dependent
  pathway, and components in brown background denote the ABA-independent pathway.
