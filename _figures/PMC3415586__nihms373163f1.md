caption: Long-term repopulating hematopoietic progenitors (LSK-flt3−) progress through
  LSK-flt3+ progenitors which branch into myeloid (MP) and lymphoid (LP) progenitors.
  For DC development, MP yield the macrophage-DC progenitor (MDP) and common DC progenitor
  (CDP). In Flt3L-mediated DC development during homeostasis, the CDP yields plasmacytoid
  DC (pDC) and pre-cDC, the immediate precursors of conventional DC (cDC) and some
  tissue DC (tDC). Estradiol (E)/ERα signaling decreases the number of DC that develop
  along this pathway (blue dashed circle). In the GM-CSF-driven pathway, MP give rise
  to MDP and monocytes that differentiate to populations of inflammatory DC and some
  tDC. Estradiol/ERα signaling promotes this developmental pathway (red solid circle).
  LP also yield some DC populations in vivo (not shown). This figure was adapted from
  ().
