caption: Proposed model of myostatin-induced skeletal muscle wasting and insulin resistanceMyostatin
  binds to it’s receptor (ActR2B), phosphorylating the Smad2/3 pathway. Myostatin
  signaling is responsible for inhibiting Akt phosphorylation which reduces skeletal
  muscle protein synthesis (increasing sarcopenia) and inhibits skeletal muscle insulin
  sensitivity. Myostatin is also capable of inhibiting AMPK activity which will reduce
  GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (reducing glucose uptake and insulin
  sensitivity) and reduce ACC phosphorylation, reducing lipid oxidation. Lastly, myostatin
  signaling can reduce GLUT4 protein expression which would reduce the availability
  of glucose transporters and contribute to skeletal muscle insulin resistance.
