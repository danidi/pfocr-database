caption: 'Mammalian visual cycle. The concentration of all-trans-retinal (ATR) is
  dependent on two processes: i) retinal release during the photocycle in the rod
  outer segment (ROS) and ii) retinal removal by a regeneration pathway in the retinal
  pigment epithelium (RPE) as schematically shown on the left. Continuous exposure
  to light leads to the accumulation of ATR (right, top), which initiates rhodopsin
  deactivation by arrestin (arr). Arrestin binding slows down the retinal release,
  which gives ample time to retinal dehydrogenase (RDH) to remove excess ATR by converting
  it to all-trans-retinol (right, bottom).'
