caption: Coenzyme B12 biosynthesis in serovar Typhimurium. Shown are the intermediates,
  substrates, and enzymes of the pathway. α-DAD, alpha-5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole adenine
  dinucleotide; Nm, nicotinamide; α-RP, alpharibazole-5′-phosphate; AdoCbl-P, adenosylcobalamin
  phosphate; CobA, ATP:Co(I)rrinoid adenosyltransferase; CbiB, putative AdoCbi-P synthetase;
  CobD, l-Thr O-3-phosphate decarboxylase; CobT, NaMN:5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase;
  CobU, AdoCbi kinase and guanylyltransferase; CobS, cobalamin phosphate synthase;
  CobC, cobalamin-phosphate phosphatase; YcfN, thiamine kinase (AdoCbi kinase); CobY,
  nucleotidyltransferase from M. mazei. The box represents the corrinoid transport
  system (BtuBFCD). AdoCbyP (in brackets) is a proposed intermediate.
