caption: Pathways for molecular targeting in prostate cancer radiotherapy. Several
  pathways can serve as potential targets in attempt to modulate radiotherapy response
  and enhance clinical outcomes in non-indolent, localized prostate cancers. This
  figure depicts four important pathways involved in disease progression and radiation
  response along with its potential targets. (A) Androgen Receptor (AR) Pathway. AR
  has a central role in the transcription of several genes important in the survival
  and proliferation of prostate cancerous cells. Several new agents have been explored
  in castration-resistant prostate cancers with encouraging results. In localized
  disease, when combined with radiotherapy, these novel therapies also constitute
  a promising avenue for cure. (B) Hypoxia. Hypoxia modulation constitutes an important
  way to improve clinical outcomes following prostate cancer radiotherapy. Tumor hypoxia
  fraction can be targeted either by hypoxia cell radiosensitizers, enhancing oxygen
  delivery, or decreasing oxygen consumption. (C) DNA Damage Response (DDR) Pathway.
  Figure shows simplified DDR scheme with agents acting in different repair processes
  including Base Excision Repair (BER), Single Strand Break (SSB), Non-homologous
  End-Joining (NHEJ), and Homologous Recombination. Targeting cell cycle checkpoint
  can lead to cells with abrogated G1 and G2 checkpoints and accumulation of DNA breaks
  resulting in mitotic catastrophe. The use of these agents with RT would be expected
  to lead to increased residual SSBs and DSBs that can be tracked by DNA repair foci
  within irradiated tumor and normal tissues. In addition, the use of some of these
  inhibitors (e.g., PARP inhibitors) may lead to cytotoxicity as single agents based
  on the concept of synthetic lethality. (D) PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway. Proliferation
  of prostate cancer cells is under control of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. As major
  growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, VEGFR) require this downstream kinase pathway,
  it is also promising target for radiosensitization through inhibitors of mono- or
  multiple actions.
