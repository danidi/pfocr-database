caption: 'The proposed biosynthetic pathway of DCA (A) and the established biosynthetic
  route to major cannabinoids (B). Both pathways consist of (1) polyketide formation,
  (2) prenylation, and (3) cyclization steps. The polyketide formation steps of each
  pathway are enclosed in dashed squares. aIn the absence of OAC, the pentyl tetra-β-ketide
  intermediate is spontaneously cyclized to olivetol via decarboxylative aldol condensation.
  Abbreviations used are: OAC, olivetolic acid cyclase; TKS, tetraketide synthase.'
