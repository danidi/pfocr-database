caption: Glutathione dependent and independent ferroptosis axis. Ferroptosis-cell
  death is dependent of accumulation of lipid peroxides in the membrane leading to
  its disruption and cell bubbling (photography representing xCT-KO cells dying by
  ferroptosis). GSH-dependent axis follows cysteine-dependent import via xCT and GSH
  synthesis. Some of up-to-date known inhibitors of xCT are erastin, imidazole ketone
  erastin (IKE), high extracellular glutamate but also sorafenib or sulfasalazine
  (SSZ). Cysteine is the rate limiting component of GSH synthesis via glutamate-cysteine
  ligase (GCL). This GSH biosynthesis can be inhibited by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO).
  GSH can be reduced via GSH reductase (GR) and then used as a cofactor by GSH peroxidase
  4 (GPX4) to detoxify lipids peroxides. GPX4 can be inhibited by different inhibitors
  such as RSL3, ML210, and FIN56 to induce ferroptosis. GSH-independent axis follows
  detoxification of lipid peroxides by ubiquinol leading to its oxidation to ubiquinone.
  Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) is responsible of the regeneration of ubiquinone
  to ubiquinol and can be interrupted by “inhibitor of FSP1” (iFSP1). Acetyl-CoA is
  a precursor of ubiquinol and mevalonate pathway. Cysteine is potentially implicated
  in ubiquinol synthesis via pantothenate pathway which uses cysteine for acetyl-coA
  synthesis. Pantothenate synthesis is inhibited by pantothenate kinase inhibitors
  (PanKi).
