caption: Calmodulin-dependent nuclear import and disease. A, our  originally proposed
  model of two import pathways, triggered by Ran (resting)  and calmodulin (activated).
  The housekeeping pathway is active in resting  cells, is dependent on Ran/importins,
  and does not require increased cytosolic  concentrations of calcium. Cell activation
  is accompanied by the release of  calcium from intracellular stores. This increase
  in cytosolic calcium  activates calmodulin  (CaM·Ca+2) and allows  for binding to
  and import of NLS-containing proteins. B, revised  model based on the nuclear import
  of architectural transcription factors. The  HMG box proteins SOX9 and SRY contain
  two NLSs (NLS1 and  NLS2). These architectural transcription factors can enter the  nucleus
  via the Ran/importin or calmodulin-Ca2+pathway. The  calmodulin-Ca2+pathway is likely
  to require an importin  β-like protein (Imp-β?) to facilitate movement  through
  the nuclear pore. Once in the nucleus, the transcription factors bind  and bend
  DNA. In the human sex reversal diseases campomelic dysplasia and  Swyer syndrome,
  the import of SOX9 and SRY, respectively, is reduced.  Mutations in each of these
  NLSs have been linked to disease, suggesting that  both pathways are important but
  partially redundant.
