caption: A proposed model underlying the OTUB2/U2AF2 axis as an activator of the Warburg
  effect and tumorigenesis in NSCLC cells. The working model shows that OTUB2 exerts
  its oncogenic activity by interacting with and stabilizing U2AF2, thereby upregulating
  glycolysis-related proteins and activating AKT/mTOR signaling in NSCLC cells.

  via the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.
