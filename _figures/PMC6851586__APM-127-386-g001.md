caption: Pathways in the pathogenesis of PSO. Environmental triggers (e.g. drugs,
  infections, physical and psychological trauma) cause predisposed individuals to
  develop an autoimmune reaction, although the exact initiation mechanism is still
  poorly understood. One explanatory model  suggests that the autoantigen is LL37
  (cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide, encoded by CAMP), which complexes with DNA
  and RNA released from stressed keratinocytes. This induces plasmacytoid dendritic
  cells (pDCs) to produce IFN‐α, which activates dermal dendritic cells (DCs). These
  cells migrate to skin‐draining lymph nodes, where they secrete IL‐12 and IL‐23,
  hereby stimulating naïve T‐cells to differentiate into Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells.
  The Th cells are attracted into the dermis by chemokines (CCL20, CCL17, CCL27, CXCL9/10/11)
  released by keratinocytes. Th1 cells produce IFN‐γ and TNF‐α, while Th17 cells release
  IL‐22 and IL‐17 family cytokines. The latter (IL‐17A/F) trigger epidermal keratinocytes
  to a feed‐forward inflammatory response , inducing numerous psoriasis‐associated
  genes [defensins, S100 proteins, chemokines; keratinocytes also produce IL‐17 cytokines,
  shown is a putative, autocrine IL‐17C loop ] and stimulating keratinocyte proliferation.
  The released chemokines CXCL1/2/3/5/8 recruit neutrophils (N), which generate ROS
  (reactive oxygen species), α‐defensin (DEFA1), CXCL8, CCL20, and IL‐6. IL‐23 (released
  by activated DCs) stimulates differentiation and expansion of Th22 cells, which
  secrete IL‐22 that induces STAT3 and KRT16 expression. This causes further epidermal
  hyperplasia and eventually formation of the psoriatic plaque. To the right (punctuated
  arrows) is shown the IL‐36/IL‐1 pathway prevalent in pustular psoriasis, which is
  characterized by accumulation of neutrophils; here, IL‐17 activated neutrophils
  trigger increased IL‐36 activity, which stimulates DC's to produce IL‐1β reinforcing
  the Th17 axis . Indicated with ⊣ are targets of approved and emerging drugs, most
  of which are monoclonal antibodies (see Table ). Figure modified, mainly from van
  de Kerkhof & Nestle in , but also from Noda et al. , and Conrad & Gilliet .
