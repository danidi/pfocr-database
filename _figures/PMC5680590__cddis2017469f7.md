caption: CAV1 orchestrates the TGF-β response in HCC. Whereas in healthy liver, CAV1
  levels are very low, its expression increases through the hepatocarcinogenic process,
  being very high in poorly differentiated liver tumour cells (i.e., HLE). In those
  late stage liver tumour cells, high expression of CAV1 inhibits TGF-β-induced apoptosis
  through its interaction with the EGFR pathway, which impairs NOX4 upregulation by
  TGF-β and BMF-dependent apoptosis
