caption: Model of apoptotic pathways of the larval epithelium during X. laevis intestinal
  remodeling. T3, some of which is converted from T4 by deiodinases D1 or D2, up-regulates
  apoptotic genes such as caspases directly by TR/RXR (9-cis retinoic acid receptor)
  (the blue/green columns shown in the nuclei, respectively), the heterodimer that
  mediate TH signal, or indirectly through other TH response genes in the larval epithelial
  cell, resulting in activation of intracellular apoptotic pathway (1). On the other
  hand, T3 also directly up-regulates ST3 expression in fibroblasts. ST3 protein is
  then secreted towards the epithelium and alters the cell-laminin interaction by
  cleaving laminin receptor (LR) of the epithelial cell surface. This extracellular
  pathway also leads to apoptosis of the larval epithelial cell (2). In addition,
  other MMPs such as MMP-9TH may be involved in apoptosis by altering cell-ECM interactions.
  These intra- and extracellular pathways are integrated to cause apoptosis at the
  appropriate time during metamorphosis. If the larval epithelial cell remains after
  the remodeling, the immunological reaction by the newly formed functional adult
  lymphocytes may cause deleterious effect on the metamorphosing animal. See text
  for details.
