caption: Induction of gluconate, propanediol and branched-chain amino acid degradation
  pathway in the colonic environment compared to spent medium. (A) Induction of gluconate
  degradation pathway in the colonic environment compared to spent medium. I and R
  indicate induced and repressed genes in the colonic environment, compared to spent
  medium, followed by the fold change based on a mean of four repetitions of microarray
  data. Differential comparisons between groups were performed gene by gene using
  modified t-test. Genes were declared as differentially expressed with a p-value ≤ 0.001
  and |fold change| > 2. Three repetitions of RT-qPCR were performed and genes were
  declared as DE with a Student test P value < 0.05. (B) Induction of propanediol
  degradation in the colonic environment, compared to spent medium. Differential comparisons
  between groups were performed gene by gene using modified t-test. Genes were declared
  as differentially expressed with a P value ≤ 0.001 and |fold change| > 2. R indicates
  a repression. I indicates an induction. Numbers indicate the fold change based of
  a mean of four repetitions for microarray data. Three repetitions of RT-qPCR were
  performed and genes were declared as DE with a Student test p-value < 0.05. (C)
