caption: Metabolic pathways for PA production. There are three main pathways leading
  to the production of PA. For de novo synthesis of membrane phospholipids is the
  LPAAT pathway where G3P, derived largely from the glycolytic intermediate DHAP,
  is doubly acylated with a fatty acid, first by G3P acyltransferase (GPAT) to generate
  LPA, and then by LPAAT to generate PA. The DGK pathway involves the phosphorylation
  of DG to generate PA. DG can be generated from stored triglycerides (TG) by a lipase,
  or from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) via growth factor-stimulated
  phospholipase C. The third mechanism is the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC)
  by PLD. Like PLC, the PLD reaction is commonly stimulated by growth factors. The
  balance between PA and DG is carefully controlled by both DGK and PA phosphatases
  that convert PA to DG. Both PA and DG are important intermediates in phospholipid
  biosynthesis. It is hypothesized that the PA input to mTOR is an indicator of sufficient
  lipid precursors for cell growth and a signal to promote cell cycle progression.
  GPDH, G3P dehydrogenase.
