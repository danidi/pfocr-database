caption: HO/CO signaling pathway. In the cell, HO/CO acts through several mechanisms.
  Besides catalytic function, HO has also a non-enzymatic function. Binding of HO
  to other protein (e.q. transcription factors) modulate their activity. CO operates
  through activation/inhibition of several pathways. By modulation of these pathways
  CO could affect various function of the female reproductive system, for example
  functions in relation to the oogenesis. See text for details.
