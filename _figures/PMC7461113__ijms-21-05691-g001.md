caption: The Notch signaling pathway. Newly synthesized Notch receptors undergo post-translational
  maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. In the ER, Notch
  receptors are modified by several resident glycosyltransferases that add various
  O-linked and N-linked glycans in the EGF-repeat region of the Notch extracellular
  domain. Mature Notch receptors are produced in the Golgi apparatus after their first
  proteolytical cleavage at the S1 site, which is catalyzed by Furin-like convertases,
  and results in the production of heterodimeric Notch proteins. These heterodimers
  are thus composed of a ligand-binding Notch extracellular domain (NECD) and a single-pass
  Notch transmembrane and intracellular domain (NTMICD) that are tethered together
  through non-covalent and calcium-dependent interactions. The canonical Notch signaling
  cascade is initiated when Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL) family ligands present in signal-sending
  cells bind to the NECD of cognate Notch receptors present in apposed signal-receiving
  cells. Upon binding, ligand-receptor complexes initiate a transendocytosis process
  in the signal-sending cell, inducing a biomechanical traction that promotes a conformation
  change in the receptor, leading to the exposure of the S2 site, on which a proteolytical
  cleavage is catalyzed by the action of ADAM metalloproteases (ADAM 10/17). This
  ligand-dependent cleavage causes the release of a S1-S2 peptide from the NTMICD
  and the dissociation of the heterodimeric complex, resulting in the generation of
  a transient intermediate monomer in the signal-receiving cell called Notch extracellular
  truncation (NEXT). The S2 cleavage acts as a rate-limiting step during the initiation
  of the signaling cascade, and it is immediately followed by γ-secretase-mediated
  cleavages at the S3 and/or S4 sites. The S3/S4 intramembranous cleavage results
  in the release of a Notch β fragment (Nβ-peptide, sequence between S2 and S3/S4
  cleavage sites) to the extracellular (or endosomal) space, and the Notch intracellular
  domain (NICD) into the cytoplasm of the signal-receiving cell. The released NICD
  then initiates a translocation journey to the nucleus, where it participates, along
  with the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1/RBPjκ/Su(H)/Lag-1), Mastermind (MAM)-like
  proteins and other co-activators, in the formation of transcriptional complexes
  that initiate the expression of Notch downstream effectors of the Hes and Hey transcription
  repressor families. In its most generic form, non-canonical Notch signaling (dotted
  arrows) is independent of CSL and, instead, mediated through interaction with other
  signaling axes including PI3K, mTOR, Wnt and Akt; and could be triggered through
  either ligand-dependent or ligand-independent mechanisms, and could also occur in
  γ-secretase-dependent as well as in γ-secretase-independent modes. Notably, ligand-independent
  activation of Notch receptors, which mainly occurs in endosomal trafficking routes
  and multivesicular bodies (MVB), results in the production of NICD, which in-turn
  could prompt either CSL-dependent as well as CSL-independent signaling responses.

  description: The Notch signaling pathway. Newly synthesized Notch receptors undergo
    post-translational maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.
    In the ER, Notch receptors are modified by several resident glycosyltransferases

    (NECD) and a single-pass Notch transmembrane and intracellular domain (NTMICD)
    that are tethered together through non-covalent and calcium-dependent interactions.
    The canonical Notch signaling cascade is initiated when Delta/Serrate/Lag-2 (DSL)
    family ligands present in signal-sending cells bind to the NECD of cognate Notch
    receptors present in apposed signal-receiving cells. Upon binding, ligand-receptor
    complexes initiate a transendocytosis process in the signal-sending cell, inducing
    a biomechanical traction that promotes a conformation change in the receptor,
