caption: In the post-prandial state, increased anaplerotic metabolism of pyruvate
  and other fuels leads to the accumulation of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates,
  which leave the mitochondria to engage in cytosolic reactions that create signals
  for the amplifying/second phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).
  This includes (1) the pyruvate–malate cycle (highlighted by the brown circle and
  involving malic enzyme (ME) and the malate carrier (MC)), (2) the pyruvate–citrate
  cycle (highlighted by the light blue circle and involving ATP citrate lyase (ACLY),
  malate dehydrogenase (MDH), the citrate/isocitrate carrier (CIC) and ME), and (3)
  the pyruvate–isocitrate cycle (highlighted by the green circle and involving the
  cytosolic NADP-linked isoform of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1), the mitochondrial
  NADPH-linked isoform of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) and CIC). Note that the
  pyruvate–isocitrate pathway is a full cycle that includes reductive TCA flux, involving
  the carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate (αKG) to isocitrate in the mitochondria by
  IDH2. In β-cells, this reductive TCA cycle flux ensures that αKG generated by IDH1
  is used to regenerate citrate and isocitrate to sustain IDH1 activity. NADPH produced
  by IDH1 in the cytosol connects to insulin granule exocytosis via glutathione reductase
  (GSR) to produce reduced glutathione (GSH), leading to the activation of glutaredoxin
  (GRX1), which mediates the reduction (S2 to SH2 isoform transition) and activation
  of sentrin/SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1). SENP1 then acts as a deSUMOylase that
  removes SUMO peptides from secretory granule-trafficking proteins to enhance exocytosis.
  The activity of the pyruvate–isocitrate cycle is maintained by the supply of glutamate,
  which can be converted to αKG by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). The supply of glutamate
  can be achieved either through the activity of the malate–aspartate shuttle or by
  the reversible activity of GDH, which is regulated by leucine and its analogue 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic
  acid (BCH). Recent findings show that the effect of glutamine plus leucine/BCH co-treatment
  to stimulate insulin secretion is explained, in part, by the isocitrate cycle catalysed
  by IDH1 and IDH2. Throughout the figure, metabolic enzymes are shown in yellow ovals,
  whereas mitochondrial organic acid transporters are shown in red ovals. GSSG, glutathione
  disulfide; OGC, 2-oxoglutarate carrier; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; PC, pyruvate
  carboxylase.
