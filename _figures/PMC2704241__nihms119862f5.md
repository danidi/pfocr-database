caption: Hepatic methionine metabolism and GSH synthesis. Up to half of the daily
  intake of methionine (Met) is catabolized to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) in the
  liver in a reaction catalyzed by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT). SAMe is the
  link to three key metabolic pathways - polyamine synthesis, transmethylation and
  transsulfuration. Polyamine synthesis is required for cell growth and here SAMe
  is decarboxylated and the remaining propylamino moiety is donated to putrescine
  and spermidine. In transmethylation, SAMe donates its methyl group to a large variety
  of acceptor molecules in reactions catalyzed by methyltransferases (MTs). S-adenosylhomocysteine
  (SAH), generated as a result of transmethylation, is a potent inhibitor of all transmethylation
  reactions. Hydrolysis of SAH to homocysteine (Hcy) and adenosine is through a reversible
  reaction catalyzed by SAH hydrolase, whose thermodynamics favors biosynthesis rather
  than hydrolysis. In vivo this reaction proceeds as hydrolysis because the products
  Hcy and adenosine are promptly removed. Hcy can be remethylated to form methionine
  via methionine synthase (MS), which requires folate and vitamin B12 and betaine
  homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), which requires betaine. MS-mediated homocysteine
  remethylation requires 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), which is generated from
  5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) in a reaction catalyzed by methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase. 5-MTHF is then converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF) as it donates its
  methyl group and THF is converted back to 5,10-MTHF. In trans-sulfuration, Hcy is
  converted to cysteine (Cys), the rate-limiting precursor for GSH, via a two-step
  enzymatic process catalyzed by cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionase,
  both requiring vitamin B6. Cys is then converted to GSH. The trans-sulfuration pathway
  is particularly active in the liver and allows methionine and SAMe to be effectively
  utilized as GSH precursor.

    SAMe is the link to three key metabolic pathways - polyamine synthesis, transmethylation
