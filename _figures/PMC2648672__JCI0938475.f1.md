caption: Long, viral dsRNA in the cytoplasm is cleaved to short, viral dsRNA (siRNA)
  by Dicer. MicroRNA (miRNA), a class of noncoding RNA molecules involved in gene
  regulation, is generated by Drosha-mediated cleavage from pri-miRNA transcribed
  in the nucleus, exported by Exportin-5 to the cytoplasm, and then cleaved by Dicer,
  resulting in siRNA. Similarly to physiological pri-miRNA, shRNA introduced to cells
  via gene transfer enters the same pathway (Drosha, Dicer), resulting in the release
  of the corresponding siRNA. siRNA produced by both pathways binds to RNA-induced
  silencing complex (RISC), and the sense strand is released from the RISC complex.
  Complementary binding of the antisense strand to target sequences guides RISC to
  cleave the target sequence (resulting in mRNA degradation) or, in the absence of
  full complementarity to the target sequence, inhibits its translation.
