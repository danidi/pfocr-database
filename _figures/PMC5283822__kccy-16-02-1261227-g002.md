caption: Ubiquitin signaling during lesion recognition in the GG-NER pathway. The
  ubiquitylation cascade during GG-NER is initiated the UV-RING1B E3 ligase complex
  that sets the H2A-ubiquitin mark specifically at lysine 119. At DSBs H2A-ubiquitin
  at lysines 13–15 is removed by USP51. ZRF1 reads the mono-ubiquitin mark and causes
  the assembly of the UV-DDB-CUL4A complex. This complex or its subunit DDB2 undergoes
  K48 linked self-ubiquitylation, which leads to its segregation by the p97 complex
  and its subsequent proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitylation of XPC by the UV-DDB-CUL4A
  ligase causes a poly-ubiquitylation of XPC, which is inhibited by parylation of
  DDB2. The linkage type and potential interactors of this ubiquitin chain are not
  known. XPC may be regarded a control center of damage recognition where many ubiquitin
  signals concur. XPC, like DDB2, is extracted from chromatin upon poly-ubiquitylation
  and also decorated by a K63-linked ubiquitin chain catalyzed by the SUMO-dependent
  E3 ligase RNF111. Poly-ubiquitin chains at XPC are edited by USP7 and potentially
  by OTUD4. Green spheres depict K63-linked ubiquitylation, red spheres depict K48-linked
  ubiquitylation. Blue spehres indicate mono-ubiquitylation or poly-ubiquitylation
  of unknown linkage.
