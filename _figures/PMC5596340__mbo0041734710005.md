caption: Metabolic reconstruction of the candidate phylum members PAUC34f, Parcubacteria
  (OD1), Peregrinibacteria, and ACD39 (Bin 13). Colors indicate pathway elements based
  on the number of genomes in which they were recovered, according to the key. Black
  outlines and/or arrows indicate genes that were not observed. Boldface black numbers
  correspond to annotations supplied in Table S1 at http://thethrashlab.com/publications.
