caption: Canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation. Proinflammatory
  activation signals such as LPS or TNFα activate the canonical pathway through the
  activation of the IKK complex, which includes the subunits IKKγ (NF-κB essential
  modulator, or NEMO), IKKα, and IKKβ. This complex then phosphorylates IkBα (the
  NF-κB inhibitor), which causes it to be ubiquitinated and proteolytically cleaved
  by the proteosome, releasing the p50/p65 heterodimer to be translocated to the nucleus,
  where it transcriptionally activates proinflammatory genes, including p47 and p67
  of the NADPH oxidase complex. Growth and differentiation signals such as BAFF and
  CD40L activate the noncanonical pathway, which is initiated by NF-κB inducing kinase
  (NIK), which phosphorylates the IKKα homidimer complex which does not require either
  IKKγ or IKKβ, which subsequently phosphorylates the p100 subunit of the p100/RelB
  complex. The p100 protein is cleaved, which allows the p52/RelB complex to translocate
  to the nucleus and activate a number of growth and survival genes in target cells.
