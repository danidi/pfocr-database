caption: Proteins with known or inferred roles in autophagy that underlie muscle pathologies
  in mice and humans. Virtually all stages of autophagy, including exercise-induction
  via phosphorylation of Bcl2, response to sarcomeric protein unfolding via the CASA
  pathway as well as autophagosome biosynthesis and maturation are targets in muscle
  disease. Positive regulators and components of the autophagy pathway that are associated
  with muscle pathology are shown as protein symbols in green. Negative regulators
  which are associated with muscle pathology, as protein symbols in red. In addition,
  the downregulation/impairment of autophagy observed in laminin α2 deficiency, mdx
  and LmnaH222P/H222P mouse models and upregulation of autophagy in collagen VI deficiency
  are indicated
