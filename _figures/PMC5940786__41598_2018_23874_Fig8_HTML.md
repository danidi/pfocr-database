caption: Model of the development and heterosis of internodes. The development and
  heterosis of internodes are mainly regulated by an auxin gradient, which is the
  result of a balance between polar auxin transport (PAT) and auxin biosynthesis.
  In plant cells and organs, PAT is negatively regulated by flavonols, which are biosynthesised
  in the cytoplasm and stored in the vacuole. Transmembrane transport of flavonols
  to the vacuole is indirectly regulated by structural genes (e.g., BZ2) encoding
  glutathione S-transferases. Additionally, flavonol biosynthesis and BZ2 expression
  are regulated by a network of transcription factors. Once PAT is inhibited, auxin
  will accumulate in cells and organs to toxic levels. Moreover, excessive auxin concentrations
  induce ethylene production, which negatively regulates plant development. Thus,
  detoxification by benzoxazinoid metabolites and the competition for indole between
  the indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis pathway and the benzoxazinoid metabolic pathway
  are required to protect cells and organs. Therefore, flavonols, which are synthesised
  in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway, and benzoxazinoids are important regulators
  of the development and heterosis of internodes via a complex network of key structural
  genes and transcription factors.
