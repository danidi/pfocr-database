caption: 'Schematic outlining the signaling pathways controlling mechanically induced
  chromatin condensation. Actomyosin-based cellular contractility is critical for
  mechanically induced chromatin condensation in MSCs. DL induces ATP release within
  30 s and depends on baseline cellular contractility. This ATP release in turn activates
  P2Rs (P2 receptors) and the resultant increase in intracellular Ca2+ activates the
  Rho/ROCK signaling pathway and cell contractility, amplifying the load-induced mechanical
  response. This ultimately culminates at longer time points in alterations in chromatin
  condensation. Although the precise mechanism remains undefined, inhibition of the
  transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily decreases baseline cellular contractility,
  blocking the first step in load-induced chromatin condensation response. Solid lines:
  defined pathways, dashed lines: undefined pathways. To see this figure in color,
