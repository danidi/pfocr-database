caption: Possible mechanism by which Wnt determines the specificity of signalling
  pathway. When Wnt3a interacts with Fz and LRP6 simultaneously in the lipid raft
  microdomain, it activated the β-catenin pathway through the caveolin-mediated internalization
  route. Wnt3a may activate the β-catenin-independent pathway through the clathrin-dependent
  internalization route. Dkk1 removes LRP6 from the lipid raft to the non-lipid raft,
  and internalized LRP6 through a clathrin-dependent route, thereby inhibiting the
  β-catenin pathway. When Wnt5a acts on Fz and Ror1 or Ror2 in the non-lipid raft
  domain, it may induce the clathrin-dependent internalization of Fz probably with
  Ror1 or Ror2, thereby activating the β-catenin-independent pathway. When Wnt5a acts
  on Fz that can activate the β-catenin pathway in the lipid raft domain, it may compete
  with Wnt3a, thereby inhibiting the β-catenin pathway. Black boxes indicate Wnt5a
  actions, which were revealed in this study.
