caption: Anti-angiogenic signaling by Sema3E-plexin D1 in endothelial cells. The activation
  of plexin D1 by Sema3E induces the association of the Ras GAP domain of plexin D1
  with R-Ras. This inactivates integrins and enables their subsequent internalization
  by the plexin D1-mediated activation of Arf6, thus inhibiting endothelial cell adhesion
  to the extracellular matrix (ECM) by disrupting integrin-mediated adhesive structures,
  and causing filopodial retraction in endothelial tip cells. The pathway by which
  Sema3E stimulation of plexin D1 leads to Arf6 activation involves phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase
  β activation, which generates PI(4,5)P2 locally. PI(4,5)P2 then binds to the PH
  domain of an Arf6 GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange protein 100, resulting in Arf6
  activation. Sema3E-induced Arf6 activation induces rapid focal adhesion (FA) disassembly,
  integrin internalization, and endothelial cell collapse, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis.

  description: Anti-angiogenic signaling by Sema3E-plexin D1 in endothelial cells.
    The activation of plexin D1 by Sema3E induces the association of the Ras GAP domain

    internalization by the plexin D1-mediated activation of Arf6, thus inhibiting

    The pathway by which Sema3E stimulation of plexin D1 leads to Arf6 activation
    involves phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinase β activation, which generates
