caption: Peripherally-derived feeding-relevant signals occurring during the preprandial
  (left column), prandial (center column), and postprandial (right column) stages
  of feeding converge with neural processing in the hippocampus (HPC) to promote learning
  and memory for various elements of a feeding episode. These mnemonic episodic elements
  include the spatial location of a food source, as well as the temporal, nutritive,
  and social aspects of a meal (mnemonic elements depicted in the cartoon across the
  bottom row). During the preprandial/appetitive stage, elevated ghrelin signaling
  promotes HPC-dependent spatial and episodic memory formation related to food procurement
  via GHSR action in HPC neurons. In the prandial stage, within-meal gut-derived vagal
  sensory signaling enhances HPC-dependent memory for visuospatial and external contextual
  features related to a feeding episode via an ascending multisynaptic hindbrain-septal-HPC
  pathway. In addition, endocrine signals (glucagon-like peptide-1, GLP-1, insulin)
  are released prandially and immediately postprandially, which each independently
  contribute to meal-related episodic mnemonic elements (e.g., memory of the nutritive
  quality of a meal, food location) via direct action on HPC neurons, as well as indirectly
  through metabolic pathways. The adipokine leptin is presented as a signal that influences
  HPC-dependent memory (via direct action on HPC neurons) across all feeding stages,
  potentially via a modulatory mechanism such that optimal leptin levels associated
  with healthy energy status promote food-related memory.
