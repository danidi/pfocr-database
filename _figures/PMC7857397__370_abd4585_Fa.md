caption: We tested the hypothesis that neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs may
  underlie critical COVID-19 by impairing the binding of type I IFNs to their receptor
  and the activation of the downstream responsive pathway. Neutralizing auto-Abs are
  represented in red, and type I IFNs are represented in blue. In these patients,
  adaptive autoimmunity impairs innate and intrinsic antiviral immunity. ISGs, IFN-stimulated
  genes; TLR, Toll-like receptor; IFNAR, IFN-α/β receptor; pSTAT, phosphorylated signal
  transducers and activators of transcription; IRF, interferon regulatory factor.
