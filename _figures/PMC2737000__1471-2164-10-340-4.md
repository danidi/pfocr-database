caption: TNF-induced NF-κB and apoptosis pathways. Gene in a dark ellipse means it
  displays differential effects but is missed in the microarray data set. A red arrow
  indicates an inferred positive effect, and a green bar indicates an inferred negative
  effect. Double slashes means the effect is blocked. A rectangle containing two genes
  indicates that these two proteins constitute a complex. If a gene-to-gene effect
  is inferred to only occur in HS stage or HR stage, the line between the two genes
  is marked with 'HS' or 'HR' in a small circle, respectively. A blue arrow suggests
  a lead to final effect, such as apoptosis or proliferation. Note that p50 and RELA
  constitute the complex NF-κB. This figure illustrates the completions between NF-κB
  pathway and apoptosis pathway represented by molecular regulation changes during
  cancer progression.
