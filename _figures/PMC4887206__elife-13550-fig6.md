caption: '(A) X-gal-stained E10.5 mouse embryos carrying novel Ptch1 enhancers as
  transient-transgenic lacZ reporters () are shown above a map of the mouse Ptch1
  region. Known Ptch1 enhancers (; ) are shown as cartoons. Red boxes along the gene
  locus schematic represent Gli1 occupancy in neural progenitors near Ptch1 (as identified
  by ChIP-seq; ). (B) ChIP-seq of Gli2 and Gli3 near Ptch1. Red arrowheads highlight
  tissue-specific Gli binding. (C) ChIP-seq shows H3K27me3 is enriched at the proximal
  promoter but reduced upon pathway stimulation, consistent with relief of Polycomb-mediated
  repression. (D) Left, summary of the ptc response to Hh in the Drosophila embryonic
  ectoderm. Multiple Hh-responsive enhancers combine Ci/Gli sites (red bands) and
  tissue-specific inputs (colored bands), generating overlapping subsets of the embryonic
  ptc response which are integrated and amplified by the promoter-proximal region,
  resulting in a complete segment-polarity stripe pattern (top). The promoter-proximal
  region also generates the basal signal-independent ptc expression (bottom, purple).
  Right, summary of the Hh response of ptc in the wing disc. A large battery of tissue-specific
  Gli-responsive enhancers, driving wing stripes of different widths, intensities,
  and dorso-ventral extents, interact with a Polycomb/Trithorax-bound promoter-proximal
  region to provide a complete wing stripe pattern (top). The PRE-containing promoter-proximal
  region also produces signal-independent ptc expression in the anterior (bottom,
  purple). Identification of flanking CTCF insulator sites for both fly and mouse
  patched were determined using ChIP-seq and ChIP-CHIP analyses available from the
  UCSC genome browser and modENCODE databases ().DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13550.01810.7554/eLife.13550.019Figure
