caption: 'A. Insulin signaling in the liver. Insulin exerts its effects through autophosphorylation
  of the insulin receptor and phosphorylation of IRS2. Activated IRS2 activates a
  PI3K pathway that leads to phosphorylation of Akt with downstream signaling resulting
  in translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane to allow glucose entry, increased
  glycogenogenesis, inhibition of gluconeogenesis by inhibiting transcription factors
  FOXO1, and promotion protein synthesis and cell growth through mTOR.B. Insulin signaling
  in skeletal muscle. Insulin binding causes autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor
  and phosphorylation of IRS1. Activated IRS1 leads to phosphorylation of Akt via
  PI3K ultimately causing translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane to allow glucose
  entry. Glucose is then phosphorylated by hexokinase to being path to glycogenogenesis.C.
  Insulin signaling in adipose tissue. Insuling signaling causes similar translocation
  of GLUT4 to the cell membrane. Insulin action also affects lipid transport. Insulin
  stimulates LPL in the post-prandial state to release FFA and DAG from circulating
  TG. FFAs are captured in the adipocyte by ASP and are re-packaged as TG by DGAT.
  Insulin prevents lipolysis by inhibiting HSL in the post-prandial state.Abbreviations:
