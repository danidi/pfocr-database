caption: 'The pathway required for generating the intermediates required for butanol
  production in Cyanothece 7822 is shown, along with the expression values for mRNA
  and protein. The x-axis represents the four comparisons: D0 vs. L3 (mid-day to sunset);
  D3 vs. D0 (mid-night to sunset); D3 vs. L0 (mid-night to sunrise); and, L3 vs. L0
  (sunrise to early morning).'
