caption: 'Schematic representation of magnoflorine biosynthetic pathway and the expression
  profile of those unigenes of the C. draco species which coding for the enzymes involved.
  In the figure, the molecular structure of each proposed intermediate is represented,
  followed by the enzymes (acronyms shown in red) and their corresponding orthologs
  identified in the C. draco transcriptome. Expression profiles representing the abundance
  of the transcripts (FPKM) in each organ analysed are also shown for each of the
  C. draco unigenes identified as orthologs of the reference enzymes. Acronyms: TYDC
  (tyrosine decarboxylase); NCS ((S)-norcoclaurine synthase); 6OMT ((S)-norcoclaurine
  6-O-methyltransferase); CNMT ((S)-coclaurine N-methyltransferase); NMCH ((S)-N-methylcoclaurine
  3′-hydroxylase, CYP82B subfamily); 4’OMT ((S)3′-hydroxy N-methylcoclaurine 4′-O-methyltransferase);
  CTS ((S)-corytuberine synthase, CYP80G2)'
