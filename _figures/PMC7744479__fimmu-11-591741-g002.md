caption: 'Lymphoma induced angiogenesis in LNs and participating immune cells. Top:
  The LN compartments represented under homeostatic conditions (left) and lymphoma-activated
  angiogenesis (right). Lymphoma growth is characterized by a strong LN volume expansion
  and blood vasculature growth. Remodeling of the stromal infrastructure involves
  an increase of the microvessel density (MVD), as effectuated by direct angiogenic
  stimulation through lymphoma B cells cells, but concomitantly also through reciprocal
  crosstalk of cells in the TME and recruited immune cells. Notably, the initiation
  of the angiogenic switch in lymphoma is independent from hypoxia-induced HIF1α pathway
  activation. Tumor polarized DCs (CEBP/βhigh) control the HEV differentiation status
  via LTα1β2 and LIGHT presentation; they release IL-1β and hereby take part in the
  blood vessel growth by inducing VEGF-A expression in FRCs. They also secrete the
  angiogenic factors VEGF-A and FGF2. B cells express LTα1β2, which exerts minor effects
  on HEVs, but a predominating stimulatory effect on FRCs. Expression of the chemokines
  CCL2, CXCL12, and MIF recruits additional immune cells into the LN. Regulatory T
  cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), M2-polarized macrophages,
  neutrophils and mast cells are capable of producing the pro-angiogenic factors VEGF-A,
  VEGF-B, VEGF-C, MMP9, IL-8, IL-10, TGFβ, and FGF1/2. Bottom left: HEVs express PNAd,
  CCL21, and ICAM1 and thereby constitute the transmigration routes for lymphocytes
  under homeostatic conditions. Interaction of CD62L, CCR7, and LFA-1 on naïve lymphocytes
  with these HEV-associated surface receptors and chemokines initiates lymphocyte
  rolling, HEV wall adhesion and eventually, transmigration into the LN parenchyma.
  Bottom middle: Inflammatory vessels in reactive LNs recruit activated lymphocytes
  by CXCL9 secretion and replace the homeostatic receptors on endothelial cells with
  CD62P, CD63E, and VCAM1 that are interaction partners of leukocyte-expressed CD44,
  PSGL1, and VLA4. Bottom right: The lymphoma induced expansion of the blood vessel
  network favors the assembly of smaller anergic endothelium that is insufficiently
  equipped for lymphocyte extravasation.'
