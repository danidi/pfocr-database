caption: Enzymatic conversion of cytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. DNA methyltransferases
  (DNMTs) convert cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine be converted
  to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in an enzymatic process involving members of the ten-eleven
  translocation (TET) protein family. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine could be converted to
  cytosine through a passive demethylation or an active demethylation pathway.
