caption: 'Transcriptional heat map for proposed 3HP/4HB cycle and central metabolism
  in M. sedula. Metabolic diagram shows 3HP/4HB pathway (top center), incomplete tricarboxylic
  acid (center), gluconeogenesis (bottom center), and isoprenoid-based lipid biosynthesis
  pathways (top left), with normalized transcription levels for relevant genes. The
  heat map legend (bottom left) shows color values for transcription levels, with
  high transcription levels shown in red and low transcription in green. The corresponding
  numbers represent least squares mean values of normalized log2-transformed transcription
  levels relative to the overall average transcription level of 0 (depicted as black).
  For all heat maps, the autotrophic carbon-limited condition appears on the left
  and the heterotrophic condition on the right. Acetyl-CoA (Ac-CoA) is shown in red
  boxes to highlight where it is produced or required; amino acid biosynthesis groups
  are shown in black boxes. The metabolic network shown here is adapted from Estelmann
  et al. (). Enzymes: 1, acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase; 2, malonyl-CoA reductase
  (NADPH); 3, malonic semialdehyde reductase (NADPH); 4, 3HP-CoA synthetase (AMP forming);
