caption: Proposed scheme to describe how  are interconnected with Ca2+-pH signaling
  components in polar growing cells. A, Ca2+ ions are taken up by the cell from external
  sources or stored in the cell wall and released by changes in  controlled mainly
  by plasma membrane AHA. In addition, Ca2+ can be stored in subcellular compartments
  (e.g. vacuoles and -Golgi) and released into the cytosol. Still poorly characterized,
  plasma membrane s transport free Ca2+ ions from the apoplast into the cytoplasm
  (). To maintain physiologically low concentrations of , ACAs transport Ca2+ ions
  back to the apoplast. In addition, the H+/Ca2+ antiporter activity of CAX translocates
  Ca2+ back to the apoplast and, simultaneously, imports H+ into the cytoplasm.  production
  is catalyzed by the NOX proteins, NOXC and RTH5 (in maize) in root hairs and NOXH/NOXJ
  in pollen tubes. These NOX proteins are regulated by complex partners, including
  Ca2+ ions, ROPs, and kinases. NOX produces apoplastic ion superoxide (O2−), which
  mostly is converted by superoxide dismutases (SODs) to . In root cells, the CrRLK1L
  kinase FER, which contains a malectin-like extracellular domain, binds to RALF1
  and inhibits growth. In growing root hairs, FER forms a complex with the guanine
  nucleotide-exchange factor ROP-GEF1, and possibly with other ROP-GEFs (such as ROP-GEF4
  or ROP-GEF10), to recruit and then activate the plant RHO GTPase ROP2. In pollen
  tubes, ANX1 and ANX2 are the CrRLK1L proteins that regulate -linked cell growth.
  In addition, pollen tube guidance to the ovule relies on two groups of Leu-rich
  receptor-like kinases (MDS1-MIK1/2 and PRK6) binding to the Cys-rich peptide LURE1
  (see text for details) and downstream ROPGEFs (ROPGEF8, ROPGEF9, ROPGEF12, and ROPGEF13)
  and ROP1 (at least demonstrated for PRK6). Then, ROP1 possibly targets the N-terminal
  domain of NOXH/NOXJ to trigger  production. In root hairs, spatially active ROP2
  triggers  production, since it is able to bind directly to the N terminus of NOXC
  and enhance its enzymatic activity. Auxin (as indole acetic acid [IAA]) enhances
  ROP2 activity to generate  by triggering NOXC activation. B, In root hairs, high
  auxin levels (IAA), possibly attained through the activation of unknown ARF proteins,
  up-regulate the expression of the transcription factor basic helix-loop-helix RSL4
  (in addition to activating ROP2) and promote  production. It is proposed here that
  RSL4 controls (directly or indirectly) the transcription of NOXC/RTH5 and NOXH/NOXJ
  as well as secreted type III peroxidases (PER) in root hairs. By contrast, high
  levels of  act as a repressor of RSL4 expression. High concentrations of  enhance
  or reduce the stiffness of the cell wall, thereby either promoting or restricting
  cellular extension. PER uses  as an oxidant to convert cell wall phenolic compounds
  and structural proteins into free radicals that can subsequently come together to
  form covalent linkages (in the peroxidative cycle), thus restricting growth. Also,  and
  oxygen (O2) can be used to generate hydroxyl radicals (in the hydroxylic cycle),
  including , which mediates the nonenzymatic cleavage of polysaccharides. This would
  induce transient relaxation of the cell wall, allowing tip growth.  also could promote
  Ca2+ transport by triggering the activation of s () by unknown mechanisms, possibly
  in the apoplast, cytoplasm, or on both sides. Not all  remains in the apoplast,
  since some of the  may be transported back to the cytoplasm by aquaporins (plasma
  membrane intrinsic proteins [PIPs]) and trigger a signal cascade response (e.g.
  OXI1-mediated MAPK cascade). OXI1, an AGC2 kinase, could activate MARIS (MRI), a
  receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase present in growing root hairs and pollen tubes.
  MRI would be a downstream component of FER in root hairs and of ANX1/ANX2 in pollen
  tubes. Other root hair-specific AGC kinases in the VIII subfamily are IRE and AGC2-1.
