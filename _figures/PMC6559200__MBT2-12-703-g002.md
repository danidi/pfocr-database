caption: 'Simplified shikimate pathway and its integration into wider central metabolism,
  including modifications for pABA production. Knockout targets are highlighted in
  red, heterological genes that were overexpressed in green. The significant intermediates
  are glucose 6‐phosphate (G6P), erythrose 4‐phosphate (E4P), phosphoenolpyruvate
  (PEP), pyruvate (PYR), 3‐deoxy‐d‐arabino‐heptulosonate‐7‐phosphate (DAHP), shikimate,
  shikimate‐3‐phosphate (S3P), chorismate, phenylalanine (PHE), tyrosine (TYR), tryptophan
  (TRP) and para‐aminobenzoic acid (pABA). Important genes and the respective enzymes
  involved are aroA: 3‐deoxy‐d‐arabino‐heptulosonate‐7‐phosphate (DAHP) synthase/chorismate
  mutase, aroH: chorismate mutase, trpC: indole‐3‐glycerol phosphate synthase, pabAB:
  aminodeoxychorismate synthase, pabC: aminodeoxychorismate lyase.'
