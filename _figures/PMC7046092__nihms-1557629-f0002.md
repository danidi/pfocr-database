caption: Indirect Metabolism of drugs through the GI microbiome. A. The gut microbiome
  may alter host gene expression. Germ-free mice have increased expression of constitutive
  androstane receptor (CAR) in comparison to conventional mice. Elevated levels of
  CAR result in increased rates of xenobiotic metabolism. B. The gut microbiome competes
  for host enzymes and receptors. The gut microbiota produces the metabolite p-cresol
  from tyrosine. This metabolite competes with acetaminophen for sulfotransferase
  binding sites, resulting in reduced capacity to bind acetaminophen. C. The gut microbiome
  generates pathway intermediates. Gut microbial glycyl radical enzymes convert choline
  and dietary components into trimethylamine (TMA). TMA is then oxidized by host flavin
  monooxygenases to form trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). TMAO is a contributing factor
  in heart disease. D. The gut microbiota influences enterohepatic recycling. During
  phase II metabolism, glucuronic acid is appended to small molecules like SN-38,
  the active metabolite of the anti-cancer drug irinotecan, creating SN-38G, to facilitate
  excretion. β-glucuronidase enzymes within the GI hydrolyze SN-38-G, reactivating
  it to SN-38 within the gut. This allows the molecule to be recirculated throughout
  the body and causes the harmful GI side effects associated with SN-38.
