caption: The proposed relationship of MYC, LMP2A, and p27kip1in lymphoma development.
  (Top) In an λ-MYC mouse model, overexpression of MYC results in repression of Cdkn1b
  transcription and increases p27kip1 degradation, leading to an increase in proliferation.
  The remaining pool of p27kip1 partially impedes MYC-induced cell cycle progression
  and downregulates MYC. Abundant expression of MYC also induces p53 pathway activation.
  Both p27kip1 and p53 are able to prevent uncontrolled proliferation for a certain
  length of time. At a later step, selection pressure forces deregulated MYC cells
  to overcome the apoptosis mechanism mediated by p53, and a lymphoma develops. (Bottom)
  In the presence of LMP2A, p27kip1 turnover is more rapid and weakens the MYC repression
  network, resulting in a high level of MYC. Although the p53 pathway is induced as
  a result of overexpression of MYC, cell cycle progression and proliferation outpaces
  the rate of apoptosis. A severely low level of p27kip1 may relieve the selection
  pressure, and a lymphoma develops without the need to inactivate the p53 pathway.
