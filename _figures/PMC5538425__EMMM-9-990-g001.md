caption: Multiple different pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been reported
  to trigger Calcineurin–NFAT signalling upon ligand binding. In particular, TLRs
  and C‐type lectin receptors (CLR) play critical roles in NFAT activation during
  innate immune responses. The observation that LPS exposure can stimulate NFAT‐mediated
  IL‐2 expression focused the majority of early research on the role of TLR4 (Granucci
  et al, , ). The LPS co‐receptor CD14 was later also reported to promote Calcineurin–NFAT
  activation via recruitment of Syk (Zanoni et al, ). In mast cells, heterodimers
  of TLR1‐TLR2 recognize Pam3 CSK 4 and drive the recruitment of Fc‐γ receptor which
  contains ITAM motifs (Jin et al, ). TLR9 can also promote NFAT activation upon exposure
  to Aspergillus fumigatus conidia in acidified endosomes, which results in recruitment
  of BTK, activation of PLCγ followed by increase in intracellular calcium concentration
  and NFAT translocation to the nucleus (Herbst et al, ). Alternatively, Syk recruitment,
  PLCγ activation and nuclear localization of NFAT can instead be induced by ligand
  binding of ITAM‐containing CLRs such as Dectin‐1 (Goodridge et al, ), macrophage‐inducible
  Ca2+‐dependent lectin (Mincle) (Yamasaki et al, ) and CLEC‐2 (Mourao‐Sa et al, ;
  Severin et al, ).
