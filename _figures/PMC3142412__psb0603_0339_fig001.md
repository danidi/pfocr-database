caption: The ethylene signaling pathway is composed of two modules which are mutually
  exclusive in their effects on the phenotype of the root cell. The MAPK module promotes
  an auxin dependent phenotype due to the positive action of the CTR1 kinase on POLARIS
  expression. The ethylene module promotes an ethylene dependent phenotype due to
  the activation of ERF1. When the ethylene receptor is switched on (absence of ethylene)
  the MAPK module is activated and the ethylene module is inactivated. When the ethylene
  receptor is switched off by ethylene, the ethylene module is activated and the MAPK
  module is inactivated.
