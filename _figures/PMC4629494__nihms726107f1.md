caption: 'Pyruvate and octanoate metabolism in the liver. The metabolic pathways probed
  in this study. Carbons are illustrated by filled (13C) or unfilled (12C) circles
  as follows : 1 carbon, CO2; 2 carbons, acetyl-CoA; 3 carbons, pyruvate (Pyr) or
  phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP); 4 carbons, oxaloacetate (OAA); 5 carbons, α-ketoglutarate
  (αKG); 6 carbons, citrate (CIT); 8 carbons, octanoate (Oct). The vertical molecules
  are numbered from position 1 on the top. Position 1 of citrate and α-ketoglutarate
  is at the bottom. a shows metabolism of [1-13C]pyruvate and [2-13C]pyruvate through
  pyruvate carboxylase (PC) with complete randomization in the fumarate pool, and
  flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Flux through the malic enzyme is equivalent
  to flux through PEPCK. Flux through α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is neglected.
  Given the lengthy pathways involved and the relatively short half-life of the hyperpolarized
  intermediates, it is highly unlikely that HP 13CO2 could be produced from [2-13C]pyruvate,
  but [2-13C]pyruvate does however provide a relatively direct pathway to [3-13C]citrate.
  b shows metabolism of a mixture of [3-13C]pyruvate and [U-13C]octanoate. A doublet
  of doublets (quartet) due to J34 and J45 arising from metabolism of [U-13C]octanoate
  will be generated in glutamate via α-ketoglutarate. The enrichment of carbons 1
  and 2 of pyruvate are realized through pyruvate cycling, which encompasses pyruvate
  metabolism through PC to OAA, followed by passage through PEPCK to PEP and then
  through pyruvate kinase (PK) to pyruvate. In these examples small amounts of unlabeled
  acetyl-CoA could arise from stored glycogen or triglycerides. Broad arrows refer
  to multi-enzymatic steps, while thin arrows refer to single-enyzmatic steps'
