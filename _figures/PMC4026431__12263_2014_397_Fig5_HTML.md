caption: Possible interaction between various transcription factors and transcriptional
  coactivators contributing to the observed increase in adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
  concentrations in response to curcumin supplementation in APOE3 and APOE4 mice.
  Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ coactivator (PGC)-1α is a transcriptional
  coactivator that functions as a key regulator for energy homeostasis and mitochondrial
  biogenesis. PGC1α was previously shown to interact with the guanine–adenine repeat
  binding protein alpha subunit (GABPa) to induce increased mitochondrial biogenesis
  and mitochondrial respiratory capacity. This mechanism could explain the increased
  mitochondrial respiratory capacity after curcumin supplementation in APOE3 mice
  since the activation of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) through GABPa
  possibly led to the increased protein concentrations of mitochondrial respiratory
  complexes and increased ATP concentrations. Curcumin effects in APOE3 mice might
  also be mediated by PPARγ. Although PPARγ has not been associated with the regulation
  of mitochondrial respiratory complexes, PPARγ may indirectly enhance mitochondrial
  biogenesis by activating the PPARγ responsive element found in the gene promoter
  region of PGC1α, thereby increasing the transcription of PGC1α. In APOE4 mice, curcumin
  only induced a slight increase in PGC1α but did not seem to induce downstream PPARγ
  or GABPa. TFAM was even decreased in APOE4 mice. An alternative pathway might be
  responsible for the increased ATP concentrations in APOE4 mice
