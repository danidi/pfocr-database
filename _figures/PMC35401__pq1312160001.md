caption: (A) Schematic representation of the strategy for generating a functional
  validation profile of a biochemical network by using the DHFR PCA. Positive clones
  are detected with the DHFR survival-selection assay. They correspond to interacting
  component proteins of two convergent signal transduction pathways (Path 1 and Path
  2). An interaction matrix (upper left) represents all positive (green) and negative
  (red) interacting pairs observed in the survival-selection assay. Positive clones
  from survival selection are propagated and subjected to two functional analyses.
  First, with use of the DHFR fluorescence assay, interactions are probed with pathway-specific
  stimulators (1 and 2) and inhibitors (A and B). Pharmacological profiles are established
  on the basis of the pattern of response of individual interactions to stimulators
  and inhibitors, represented in the histograms. (Ordinate axes represent fluorescence
  intensity.) For example, stimulation of pathway 1 will augment all of the interactions
  composing that pathway. Inhibitor A will inhibit protein interactions downstream,
  but not upstream of its site of action in pathway 1. Second, cellular locations
  of the interactions are determined by fluorescence microscopy, also by use of the
  DHFR fluorescence assay. (B) Well established connections within RTK (growth factor-activated)-
  and FRAP-mediated pathways that control initiation of translation and sites of action
  of inhibitors of these pathways. Broken line indicates indirect action. PI3K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.
