caption: 'Metabolic links between His and Trp, purine, pyrimidine and pyridine nucleotide
  metabolism. Red arrows indicate the pathway of His biosynthesis, dark blue the de
  novo (solid line) and salvage (dotted line) pathways of purine biosynthesis, light
  blue the de novo (solid line) and salvage (dotted line) pathways of pyrimidine biosynthesis,
  green the pyridine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway, and brown the Trp biosynthetic
  pathway. For clarity only selected metabolic intermediates have been shown. Abbreviations
  used are: AICAR (5′-phosphoribosyl-4-carboximide-5-aminoimidazole), AMP (adenosine
  monophosphate), ATP (adenosine triphosphate), CTP (cytosine triphosphate), GMP (guanosine
  monophosphate), IGP (imidazole glycerol-phosphate), IMP (inosine monophosphate),
  NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), NADP+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
  phosphate) NAM (nicotinic acid mononucleotide), PRPP (5′-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate),
  UMP (uridine monophosphate) and UTP (uridine triphosphate).'
