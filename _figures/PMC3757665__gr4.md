caption: The dual role of Nrf2 in tumorigenesis. Under physiological conditions, low
  levels of nuclear Nrf2 are sufficient for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis.
  Nrf2 inhibits tumor initiation and cancer metastasis by eliminating carcinogens,
  ROS and other DNA-damaging agents. During tumorigenesis, accumulating DNA damage
  leads to constitutive hyperactivity of Nrf2 which helps the autonomous malignant
  cells to endure high levels of endogenous ROS and to avoid apoptosis. Persistently
  elevated nuclear Nrf2 levels activate metabolic genes in addition to the cytoprotective
  genes contributing to metabolic reprogramming and enhanced cell proliferation. Cancers
  with high Nrf2 levels are associated with poor prognosis because of radio and chemoresistance
  and aggressive cancer cell proliferation. Thus, Nrf2 pathway activity is protective
  in the early stages of tumorigenesis, but detrimental in the later stages. Therefore,
  for the prevention of cancer, enhancing Nrf2 activity remains an important approach
  whereas for the treatment of cancer, Nrf2 inhibition is desirable .
