caption: Repression of DNA-damage signaling pathways at telomeres. (a) ATM kinase
  pathway. (b) ATR kinase pathway. (c) Alternative NHEJ repair pathway. (d) Classical
  NHEJ repair pathway. (e) Homologous-recombination pathway. Steps of DNA damage–repair
  inhibition by shelterin or accessory factors are highlighted by red circles. (1)
  TRF2, potentially through its TRFH domain, and supported by Rap1, forms the t loop,
  a DNA structure that hides chromosome ends from the MRN–ATM factors–,. (2) The t
  loop also prevents loading of the Ku heterodimer on chromosome ends. (3) TRF2iDDR
  inhibits the recruitment of RNF168 at telomeres. (4) TRF2 interacts with the helix
  α5 domain of Ku70, thereby blocking its heterotetramerization. (5) Rap1 has been
  proposed to directly block c-NHEJ. (6) TPP1–POT1 prevents ATR activation, most probably
  by preventing binding of RPA on the overhang and on the ssTTAGGG at stalled replication
  forks–,. (7) The Ku heterodimer, TRF2 and, more importantly, TPP1–POT1 redundantly
  repress alt-NHEJ at telomeres,,. (8) The shelterin factors Rap1 and POT1 as well
  as Ku70–Ku80 are necessary to block HR between sister telomeres,,,. (9) The N-terminal
  basic domain of TRF2 blocks NBS1–XRCC3–mediated recombination events at the D loop
  that would lead to t-loop excision. Ku depletion induces t-loop excision as well–.
  (10) At deprotected telomeres, 53BP1, RIF1 and MAD2L2 protect chromosome ends from
  BRCA1–CtIP–EXO1–mediated 5′ resection–. LIG, ligase; Pol, polymerase; p, phospho-.
