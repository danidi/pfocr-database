caption: 'Schematic representation depicting the possible roles of IDH1 overexpression
  in Ovarian Cancer. IDH1 converts isocitrate to αKG and CO2, with concomitant production
  of NADPH from NADP+. In ovarian cancer cells (left panel), wild-type IDH1 up regulation
  increased TCA cycle metabolism and determines the increased amount of αKG and NADPH
  production which in turn provide high levels of reducing equivalents to sustain
  lipid biosynthesis and redox homeostasis and activate the αKG-dependent dioxygenases,
  histone demethylases. JHDM enzymes decrease histone H3K9 methylation on E2F target
  genes resulting in the activation of transcription of gene involved in cancer cell
  proliferation and tumor progression. IDH1 knockdown or its pharmacological inactivation
  (right panel) increased the repressive histone H3K9 methylation at multiple E2F
  target gene loci leading to ovarian cancer cell senescence. These data suggest that
  impairment of IDH1 may act as a new therapeutic target to affect both the metabolism
  and epigenetics of ovarian cancer cells and provide the rationale for the preclinical
  assessment of specific wild-type IDH1 inhibitors as anti-cancer agents (alone or
  in combination with other agents). Critical open questions in this pathway are marked
  with a question mark and include: the understanding of the mechanisms driving the
  overexpression of IDH1 in ovarian cancer cells; whether this upregulation also affects
  the ovarian cancer spreading and metastasis formation; if IDH1 inhibition cooperates
  with treatments currently available for ovarian cancer patients; if IDH1 WT inhibitors
  could be generated and used in vivo and why IDH1 inhibition does not lead to SASP
  production.'
