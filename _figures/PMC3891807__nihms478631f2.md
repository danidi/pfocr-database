caption: 'Three modes of loser-cell elimination: JNK pathway–dependent apoptosis (A),
  apoptosis-independent extrusion (B), and engulfment by neighboring winner cells
  (C). A: in loser cells (red), JNK is intrinsically activated in a cell-autonomous
  manner. A cell-death-promoting factor (blue stars) secreted by abutting wild-type
  cells (green) cooperates with the JNK pathway to promote apoptosis in loser cells
  adjacent to wild-type cells. B: loser cells (red) are physically extruded by abutting
  wild-type cells (green). The extrusion process is followed by apoptosis. C: abutting
  wild-type cells (green) engulf and therefore kill loser cells (red).'
