caption: Schematic summarizing key features of the NIC-activated antiapoptotic cascade.
  Cytoplasmic NIC activity, inhibited apoptosis coordinated by mitochondria in cell
  lines (triggered using Bax), and primary T cells. The mitochondrial remodeling proteins—Mitofusins—are
  identified in this work as key intermediates in the antiapoptotic cascade, regulating
  mitochondrial function and connectivity downstream of the NIC-Akt signaling pathway.
  Despite evidence of mitochondrial pools of NIC and Akt, we do not detect stable,
  direct associations between NIC-MFN-AKT suggesting the possibility of dynamic interactions
  among these molecules regulating signaling outputs.
