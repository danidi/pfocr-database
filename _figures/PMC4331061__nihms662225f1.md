caption: Described are the upstream and down-stream stages of this pathway in hypoxic
  and extracellular adenosine-rich microenvironments of inflamed and cancerous tissues
  (). It is believed that the collateral damage to vasculature in inflamed microenvironments
  by overactive immune cells during the anti-pathogen immune response results in interruption
  of local blood supply, decrease in local oxygen tension and abnormal local tissue
  hypoxia (,). Tumors are hypoxic because of different reasons that are inflamed tissues
  i.e. due to the abnormal and chaotic tissue geometry and insufficient vascularization,
  among others (). The hypoxia-driven stabilization of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF-1alpha)
  transcription factor () leads to the CD39/CD73 ecto-enzymes-mediated generation
  of extracellular adenosine (, ,,,,). Adenosine then signals through the Gs protein
  coupled A2A and A2B adenosine receptors (,,) and triggers the accumulation of intracellular
  cAMP. The binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase
  (PKA) results in a cascade of phosphorylation events that inhibits TCR-triggered
  signaling pathway and therefore inhibits the pro-inflammatory effects of T cells
  (–). In addition, the Cyclic AMP Response Element (CRE)-binding protein CREB is
  participating in transcription of gene products that have CRE after being phosphorylated
  by PKA (), while HIF-1alpha is participating in transcription of genes that have
  the Hypoxia Response Element (HRE) (). Another immunosuppressive molecule, adenosine
  A2B receptor was also shown to be regulated by transcriptional activity of HIF-1a
  (). The Hypoxia-A2-Adenosinergic transcription may at least partially explain the
  redirection of immune response and the “infectious” tolerance by Tregs (). The increased
  expression of CD73 on the Tregs surface () may generate the extracellular adenosine
  that would further enhance their suppressor activities in an autocrine manner as
  well as add to the immunosuppressive effects of tumor-produced adenosine on CD8+
  T cells in paracrine manner.
