caption: Activation of TNF receptor leads to activation of RIP1 and RIP3 kinases when
  caspase-8 is not present or inactive. Autophosporylations of RIP1 and RIP3 leads
  to formation on necrosome, a complex that initiates necrotic signaling pathway.
  Necrosome recruits MLKL protein and assembles signaling complex at the membrane
  rafts. Recruitment of the PGAM5 marks translocation of the complex to hydrophilic
  environment and attachment to the mitochondrial membrane and activation of Drp1
  protein that leads to mitochondrial fission and cell death. In the necrosis triggered
  by calcium overload, opening of mPTP leads to decrease of mitochondrial membrane
  potential, collapse of ATP production and release of ROS and triggering of necrosis
  in RIP3 dependent manner, although the signaling pathways leading to that event
  are unknown.
