caption: (1) Mating takes place off or on the host (before or during blood feeding),
  but is required for rapid blood feeding. The male attaches to the genital pore of
  the female via its mouthparts (evidence suggests the potential involvement of female
  specific cuticular lipids and a non-volatile mounting pheromone in I. scapularis),
  then transfers sperm and gonadotropins (unidentified at present), among other seminal
  components, including the spermatophore, (2) Gonadotropins initiate the synganglion
  to release EDTH, stimulate rapid engorgement, initiate synthesis of neuropeptides
  which in insects regulate moulting and synthesis of new cuticle (tick functions
  unknown), and release of allatostatins and allatotropins (which may stimulate or
  inhibit the mevalonate-farnesal pathway), (3) EDTH initiates production of ecdysteroids
  by the epidermis, (4) High ecdysteroid titres activate transcription factors for
  VgR in the ovaries, are stored in developing eggs and, as 20-E, activates transcription
  factors for Vg in the fat body and specialized cells of the midgut, (5) Vg is taken
  up via VgR-receptor mediated endocytosis by developing oocytes and incorporated
  into the yolk as vitellin, and (6) The female produces a single batch of ∼3,000
  mature eggs from the genital pore that are passed forward to the mouthparts for
  coating with wax released from the Gene's organ. Biochemical and genomic evidence
  suggests that I. scapularis do not make JH III although the genes for the preceding
  mevalonate and parts of the farnesal pathway were identified. Dashed lines indicate
  proposed pathways and factors. 20-E, 20-hydroxyecdysone; CAP, cardioactive peptide;
  EDTH, hypothesized epidermal trophic hormone; Vg, vitellogenin (yolk protein in
  haemolymph before egg uptake); VgR, vitellogenin receptor.
