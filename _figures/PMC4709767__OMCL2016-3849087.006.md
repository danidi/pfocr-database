caption: Proposed pathways by which NRG-1 stimulates GSH synthesis and Cbl metabolism.
  NRG-1 promotes megalin-involved Cbl uptake after which Cbl undergoes dealkylation
  or decyanation, giving rise to Cbl(II) and subsequently to OHCbl. NRG-1 also stimulates
  EAAT3-mediated cysteine uptake and promotes GSH synthesis by activating the PI3K
  signaling pathway. GSH reacts with OHCbl to form GSCbl, which then receives a methyl
  group from the methyl donor SAM to produce MeCbl. MeCbl functions as the cofactor
  for MS and increased MS activity promotes the methionine cycle of methylation. The
  dotted line indicates that multiple steps are involved.
