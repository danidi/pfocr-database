caption: The HBP and the O-GlcNAc Modification. The majority of glucose entering the
  cell is used in glycolysis, glycogen synthesis or the pentose phosphate pathway.
  However, a small portion is shunted into the HBP, whose end product is the nucleotide
  sugar donor UDP-GlcNAc. UDP-GlcNAc serves as a donor for several downstream events,
  including the synthesis of other nucleotide sugar donors, complex glycosylation
  events and the post-translational modification of nuclear and cytosolic proteins
  with O-GlcNAc. OGT is responsible for the enzymatic addition of this sugar moiety
  to the hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues, whereas OGA is the enzyme
  that removes the PTM. Altered flux through the HBP is one mechanism of attenuating
  O-GlcNAc cycling that influences numerous molecular events in the cell. Both GFAT
  and OGA inhibitors are highlighted in red and indicate the stage at which they function.
