caption: 'Hepatic glycolysis, fructolysis and triglyceride synthesis. Glucose undergoes
  the multistep process of glycolysis to generate pyruvate which is subsequently utilised
  for a range of cellular metabolic processes. This includes complete oxidative catabolism
  to carbon dioxide, lipogenesis under the catalysis of fatty acid synthase (FAS),
  and ketogenesis to generate ketone bodies for oxidative metabolic fuel. The fructolytic
  pathway feeds into the glycolytic pathway at the level of the trioses: dihydroxyacetone
  phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate. This thus bypasses the crucial regulatory
  steps in liver glycolytic metabolism, whereby glucokinase and phosphofructokinase‐1
  are controlled by the metabolic milieu in coordination with hormonal effectors.
  This allows for the production of acetyl‐CoA from fructose to continue without regulation
  by insulin, and hence promote lipogenesis, and subsequent triglyceride (TG) synthesis
  from the acyl‐coenzyme A (CoA) product. This involves catalysis of progressive acylation
  of a glycerol‐phosphate backbone by glycerol‐phosphate acyl transferase (GPAT),
  acylglycerol‐phosphate acyl transferase (AGPAT). Dephosphorylation of the glycerol
  backbone then occurs under the catalysis of phosphatidic acid phosphorylase (PAP),
  followed by a further acylation of the diacylglycerol by diacylglycerol acyl transferase
  (DGAT). The TGs produced are packed into very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) for
  export from the liver, or are stored within hepatocytes. DH, dehydrogenase; NAD+,
  nicotine adenine dinucleotide; NADH, reduced form of NAD+; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase;
  TPI, triose phosphate isomerase.'
