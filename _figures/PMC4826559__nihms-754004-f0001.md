caption: Ketone metabolism is increased in failing hearts of mice and humans. The
  major findings of altered ketone body (red) and fatty acid (blue) metabolism from
  current studies in failing mice and humans are summarized. Decreased fatty acid
  oxidation was evidenced by a reduction in long-chain acylcarnitines and reduced
  protein abundance of several enzymes in beta-oxidation (β-ox). Elevations in serum
  ketone body concentration were matched with alterations in metabolites and enzymes
  that are consistent with the upregulation of the ketone oxidation pathway. βOHB,
  beta-hydroxybutyrate; BDH1, mitochondrial beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; SCOT,
  succinyl-CoA:3-oxoacid-CoA transferase; Acac CoA, acetoacetyl CoA; βOHB CoA, beta-hydroxybutyryl
  CoA; C4-OH carnitine, hydroxybutyrylcarnitine; C2-carnitine, acetyl-carnitine. Green
  arrow, findings made in mouse heart failure (HF); Yellow arrow, findings made in
  human HF.
