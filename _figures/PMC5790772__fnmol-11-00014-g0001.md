caption: 'Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) protein family organization and HS biosynthesis.
  (A) Major HSPG protein families. Membrane-bound HSPGs can be distinguished in glypicans
  and syndecans. Glypicans are characterized by a globular protein domain (gray) and
  a stalk-like domain that contains three attachment sites for HS chains (blue). These
  molecules are attached to the external leaflet of the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol
  (GPI)-anchor (light blue). The transmembrane syndecans are characterized by the
  presence of three HS chains at the N-terminal portion of the protein. The syndecan
  intracellular tail contains two conserved regions: the C1 domain (dark gray) and
  C2 (light gray). (B) The major secreted HSPGs are Agrin and Perlecan. Agrin carries
  its HS chains in a central domain and is characterized by the presence of several
  follistatin domains. Perlecan presents HS chains only at the N-terminal portion
  of the protein. Its core protein organization is characterized by the presence of
  multiple conserved domains, such as the immunoglobulin domain. (C) The HS chain
  biosynthetic pathway: (I) HS biosynthesis starts with the attachment of a tetrasaccharide
  linker to specific serine residues. (II) The EXT family of co-polymerases mediates
  the elongation of the HS chain by adding disaccharide units composed of glucuronic
  acid (purple) and N-acetylglucosamine (ocher). (III) Subsequently, the enzyme NDST
  mediates the simultaneous sulfation and de-acetylation of specific N-acetylglucosamine
  residues. (IV) The C5-epimerase induces the epimerization of glucuronic acid to
  iduronic acid (IdoA). (V–VII) The subsequent action of the enzymes HS2ST, HS6ST
  and HS3ST mediates the attachment of sulfate groups to specific saccharide residues.'
