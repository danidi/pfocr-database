caption: The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and protein O-GlcNAcylation. The hexosamine
  biosynthetic pathway (HBP) controls O-GlcNAc glycosylation (O-GlcNAcylation) of
  nuclear and cytosolic proteins. This dynamic and reversible post-translational modification
  controls activity, localization, or stability of substrate proteins, according to
  the rate of glucose availability. A fraction (2–3%) of glucose entering the cell
  is directed to the HBP. In this pathway, fructose-6-phosphate is converted to glucosamine-6-phosphate
  by the glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), the rate-limiting
  enzyme of the pathway. After a subset of reactions, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc)
  is generated and used by the O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) as a substrate to add GlcNAc
  to serine or threonine residues of target proteins. O-GlcNAc moiety is removed from
  O-GlcNAc-modified proteins by the O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Experimentally, the level of
  O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in cells can be manipulated by exposing cells to high
  glucose concentrations or to glucosamine which enters the HBP downstream the rate-limiting
  GFAT-mediated reaction, as glucosamine-6-phosphate. In addition, OGA can be inhibited
  by pharmacological agents such as O-[2-acetamid-O-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene]
  amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) or 1,2-dideoxy-2′-propyl-alpha-d-glucopyranoso-[2,1-D]-Delta
  2′-thiazoline (NButGT), resulting in an accumulation of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins
  in the cell.
