caption: The upper panel briefly addresses the differentiation window from ABC to
  plasmablast. This is initiated by activation of B-cells with a combination of CD40L,
  B-cell Receptor (BCR) ligation and IL2/IL21 stimulation. Release from CD40L and
  BCR stimuli, and continued IL2/IL21, supports the transition to the plasmablast
  state. The associated shift in gene expression is shown in the context of PGCNA
  networks. The underlying regulatory transition is summarised in the lower panel.
  In ABCs IRF4 occupancy in the context of AICE and EICE regulatory elements dominates
  with presumptive partner factors being BATF at the former and SPIB and PU.1 at the
  latter. In plasmablasts IRF4 occupancy is associated with ISRE and IRF elements
  as well as EICEs. Loss of AICE occupancy parallels loss of BATF expression and is
  linked with BLIMP1 occupancy at the BATF promoter. BLIMP1 occupancy at the SPIB
  promoter and loss of SPIB expression is also established at this time-point. Thus,
  BLIMP1 may contribute to the shift in IRF4 occupancy by supporting repression of
  two of its key partner factors. At the same time in plasmablasts, and in myeloma
  cell lines, IRF4 acquires a new association with the occupancy pattern of CTCF,
  suggesting a potential role in chromatin looping. The third key transcription factor
  of the plasmablast state, XBP1, is highly enriched at regulatory elements of the
  secretory pathway genes induced at the plasmablast state. While XBP1 and IRF4 occupancy
  links to modules of genes characteristic of the plasmablast/plasma cell state and
  secretory pathway, BLIMP1 is associated with genes modules that are repressed in
  plasmablasts. Thus, a dichotomy in gene regulatory associations is established with
  BLIMP1 linking to repression of genes defining the activated B-cell state, while
  IRF4 and XBP1 link to expression of characteristic features of human plasmablasts.

  description: The upper panel briefly addresses the differentiation window from ABC
    to plasmablast. This is initiated by activation of B-cells with a combination
