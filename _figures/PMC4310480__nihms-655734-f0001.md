caption: Schematic representation of the components of the Hh pathway and the signaling
  transduction at the primary cilium in mammals. (a) In the absence of the Hh ligand,
  the receptor Ptch, located at the base of the primary cilium, inhibits the function
  of Smo by preventing its entry into the cilium, possibly by the production or transport
  of oxysterols. In this state, the zinc-finger Gli proteins, mainly Gli2 and Gli3,
  are found in the cytoplasm in a complex with the repressor SuFu, and are degraded
  at the C-terminal end (GliR). GliR translocates to the nucleus where it inhibits
  the transcription of Hh target genes. (b) In the presence of the Hh ligand, Hh binding
  to Ptch causes the complex to internalize and to be degraded; this allows Smo to
  move into the cilium. Smo trafficking stabilizes and activates the transcription
  factor Gli (GliA) that is able to move to the nucleus to induce transcription of
  Hh target genes.
