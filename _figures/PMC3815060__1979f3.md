caption: Metabolic map for interrogating the connectivity of mRNAs, metabolites, lipids,
  and reaction fluxes based on the genome-scale model iIN800. This network contains
  gene (enzyme)-reaction, metabolite/lipid-reaction, and lipid distribution edges
  (see node type and edge key). Measurement ratios can be visualized with log2-fold
  changes (see node color key; here, shown for aerobic vs. anaerobic conditions) and
  gray indicates the lack of a measurement for that node. Individual pathway networks
  (e.g., phospholipid biosynthesis, sterol biosynthesis, and amino acid biosynthesis)
  are highlighted. Findings for individual pathways are discussed in the text.
