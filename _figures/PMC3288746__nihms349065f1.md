caption: Proposed biosynthetic schemes for bisretinoid formation. All-trans-retinal
  that is released from opsin after photoisomerization of ground state 11-cis-retinal
  reacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in the disk membrane to produce the N-retinyl-phosphatidylethanolamine
  Schiff base (NRPE). NRPE undergoes a [1,6] H-shift producing tautomer X. Reaction
  with a second molecule of all-trans-retinal leads to path a and the formation of
  a bisretinoid phosphatidyl-dihydropyridinium molecule (dihydropyridinium-A2PE).
  Dihydropyridinium-A2PE automatically loses one hydrogen to produce A2-dihydropyridine-phosphatidylethanolamine
  (A2-DHP-PE) or it can eliminate 2 hydrogens to form A2PE, a phosphatidyl-pyridinium
  bis-retinoid. Hydrolysis of the phosphate ester of A2PE, probably by the lysosomal
  enzyme phospholipase D, yields A2E. Alternatively, all-trans-retinal can add to
  tautomer × and after ring closure all-trans-retinal dimer will form (path b). Subsequent
  Schiff base reaction with PE yields all-trans-retinal dimer-PE. Dashed arrows indicate
  multiple steps in the pathway. Note that OP indicates retention of phosphatidic
  acid (glycerol, phosphate and fatty acids) originating from PE.
