caption: The AMPK-p53-mTOR pathway in metabolic adaptation. Activation of p53 by metabolic
  stress is regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent phosphorylation
  and influenced by mammalian target of rapamycin complex1 (mTORC1). p53 further induces
  AMPK (both directly and indirectly through the sestrins) and activates the expression
  of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), resulting in the inhibition of mTOR. The
  activation of p53 may also cause up-regulation of carnitine palmitoyltransferase
  (CPT1) and enhancement of β-oxidation of fatty acids. p53 regulates expression of
  damage-regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1), which in turn induces autophagy.
  p53 up-regulates guanidinoacetate methyltransferase (GAMT), which regulates the
  creatine metabolic pathway involved in fatty acid metabolism.
