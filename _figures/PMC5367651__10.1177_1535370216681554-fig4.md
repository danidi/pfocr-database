number: Figure 4
caption: Diagrammatic scheme depicting potential survival pathway-related gene targets
  of the downregulated microRNAs and their signaling pathways in prostate cancer cells.
  An integrated in silico and computational prediction databases (DIANA-micro T-CDS,
  miRBase, and TargetScan) were employed to predict potential targets of a subset
  of highly downregulated miRNAs (>2-fold) in prostate tumors as described in “Material
  and methods” section. DIANA-miRPath “miRPath v2.0” was used to construct potential
  key targets in prostate cancer survival pathways. (A color version of this figure
  is available in the online journal.)
