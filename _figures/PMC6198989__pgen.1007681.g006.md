caption: Genes in red text reside in replicated CAD associated loci, with genomic
  and/or functional data supporting their causality [, ] [, , , , –, ]. Gene symbols
  in ellipses indicate CAD associated transcription factors. HCASMC ChIPseq data presented
  here or previously published provide evidence of direct transcriptional regulation
  and RNAseq data provides evidence of directionality [, ]. These and other data reveal
  a pervasive role of the TGFβ pathway in CAD causality [], and also suggest that
  linked TCF21 and PDGF signaling is an important component of disease risk.
