caption: Model for a two-phase cellular defense against VLP-delivered pDNA. Hypothetical
  stages in the response of cells to invasion by foreign genes are given. The sequence
  of events is derived from the data presented, with the exception of the order of
  events for activation and repositioning of transgenes in the presence of TSA, since
  it is not known which occurs first. The locations and relative positions of VLP
  and cellular components shown are schematic representations derived from fluorescence
  data. Transgene expression status is based on luciferase assay data. Inhibition
  of HDAC activity can attenuate the IFN antiviral pathway (); therefore, the effect
  of IFN-α treatment on TSA-mediated transgene activation has not been determined.
