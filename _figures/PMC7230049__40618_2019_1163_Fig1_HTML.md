caption: 'Rationale for homocysteine removal by the administration of a full array
  of activated micronutrients. The one carbon cycle is regulated by the availability
  of its substrates; accordingly, a wider availability of each substrate may enhance
  its performance. Blue background substrates: Folates, B12, chelated zinc, Vit. B2
  and Vit. B3 feed homocysteine re-methylation by the folate pathway; Folates in the
  form of methylfolate escape possible genetic defects in the activity of DHFR and
  MTHFR; B12 in the form of methylcobalamin escapes possible genetic defects in the
  activity of MTRR. Red background substrates: Betaine and chelated zinc feed homocysteine
  re-methylation by the betaine pathway; Pre-formed betaine escapes possible genetic
  defects in the activity of CHDH and provide an excess of substrate for the BHMT
  reaction. Green background substrates: Vit. B6, chelated zinc and cysteines feed
  homocysteine transsulfuration to glutathione (GSH); Excess of cysteines downstream
  to CBS reaction ensure GSH production even in case of genetic defects of CBS. Key
  enzymes subject to genetic variability: DHFR DiHydroFolate reductase, MTHFR methylenetetrahydrofolate
  reductase, MTR methionine reductase (methionine synthase), MTRR methionine synthase
  reductase, CBS cystathionine beta synthase'
