caption: Targeting IGFBPs, a novel strategy in cancer therapeutics. The cancer therapeutics
  targeting the IGF-signalling pathway focus on blocking IGF-1R, directly, and/or
  its downstream effect. Drawback of such approaches is the adverse side effects or
  toxicities due to its interference with the insulin pathway. The more efficacious
  alternatives, IGFBPs, as IGF-antagonist based cancer therapeutics also contribute
  to block the IGF-1R, mediated tumour progression. As IGFBPs do not bind insulin,
  they do not interfere with insulin-insulin receptor interactions.
