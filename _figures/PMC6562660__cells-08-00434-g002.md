caption: Downstream effector proteins of the major Rho GTPases, Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA.
  Downstream effector proteins of Rac1 and Cdc42 include the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome
  family of proteins (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP), neural-WASP (N-WASP),
  WASP family verprolin homologous protein 1 or 2 (WAVE1/2)) and p21-activated kinases
  (PAKs). WASP, N-WASP, and WAVE promote actin polymerization via activation of the
  Arp2/3 complex. PAKs activate LIM domain kinases (LIMKs) promoting phosphorylation
  and inactivation of the actin severing protein cofilin. Rac1-dependent activation
  of slingshot1 (SSH1) promotes cofilin dephosphorylation and actin depolymerization
  (actin turnover). Downstream effector proteins of Rac1 also include the NADPH oxidase
  complex (NOX2) to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the cellular membrane.
  Downstream effector proteins of RhoA include Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK)
  and the formin family of proteins (mDia). Among other downstream effector proteins,
  ROCK regulates the actin turnover via the LIMK–Cofilin pathway.
