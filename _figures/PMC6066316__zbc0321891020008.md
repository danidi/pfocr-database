caption: Differentiation of monocytes promotes resistance to ripoptosome signaling.
  As monocytes differentiate to macrophages, the expression of XIAP increases, which
  promotes resistance to cell death induced by ripoptosome signaling. In addition
  to XIAP, the p38 MAPK/MK2 pathway also promotes resistance to ripoptosome-induced
  cell death. Resistance to cell death in highly differentiated macrophages could
  promote their survival during infection and release of inflammatory cytokines for
  longer periods.
