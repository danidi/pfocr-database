caption: Schematic representation of the signaling pathways regulating osteoblast-like
  cells proliferation in response to OSS. OSS induces proliferation in osteoblast-like
  cells through activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, which is mediated
  by αvβ3 and β1 integrins through their association with FAK and Shc, which play
  synergistic roles to cooperate with PI3K subunit p85 to form FAK·Shc·p85 heteromeric
  complexes. Shc may interact with αvβ3 and β1 integrins in response to OSS by direct
  association with these integrins using the SH2 domain or via the association with
  FAK through the tyrosine 397 residue of FAK. Thus, FAK is required for maximal activation
  of αvβ3 and β1 integrins (using integrin/Shc association as readouts) in response
  to OSS. In addition to Akt, ERK is also downstream from PI3K and required for the
  OSS activation of mTOR/p70S6K, which in turn are required for the OSS modulation
  of cell cycle regulatory protein expression and induction of bone formation-related
  genes.
