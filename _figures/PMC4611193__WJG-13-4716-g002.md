caption: The regulation of intestinal iron transport. The duodenal crypt-villus axis
  represents a differentiation pathway that can be influenced by the dietary and humoral
  signals that ultimately regulate iron absorption. Immature proliferating cells in
  the crypt take up transferrin from the circulation via transferrin receptors (TfR).
  This process is governed by interactions between Hfe, β2microglobulin and TfR. The
  crypt cells are thus sensitive to the circulating levels and the iron-saturation
  of Tf. Iron regulatory proteins (IRP) recognise the cellular iron content and regulate
  iron responsive mRNAs posttranscriptionally. In addition, transcription control
  of iron metabolism may be exerted by a number of humoral and tissue-derived factors,
  such as hepcidin or cytokines interacting with their individual specific receptors.
  Together, these processes set the basal level of iron transporter protein expression
  in enterocytes as they mature and travel up the villus. Importantly, this basal
  level of transporter expression can be modified rapidly in mature enterocytes in
  response to changes in the levels of dietary factors (e.g. the iron content of the
  diet, other metals etc) and humoral and local tissue mediators (especially hepcidin
  and pro-inflammatory cytokines). This combination of basal programming in the crypts
  and fine tuning in villus enterocytes permits tight control of intestinal iron transport.
