caption: Depicted in this diagram is a simplified overview of the metabolic pathways
  and factors discussed, as well as therapeutics that have been tested to reconfigure
  imbalances in lupus immune cell metabolism. Lupus immune cells are characterized
  by enhanced glucose internalization and subsequent glycolysis, as well as heightened
  glucose oxidation by the mitochondria. Increased glucose uptake can also feed the
  pentose phosphate pathway for the generation of reducing equivalents and nucleotide
  biosynthesis. Known positive regulators of this reprogramming are ERR-α, HIF-1α
  and c-Myc. B cell-specific negative regulators include PAX5, IKZF1, Gsk3, Traf3.
  Glycolysis can be chemically inhibited by 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Dysfunctional
  mitochondria in SLE leads to enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production.
  Metformin reduces ROS production and inhibits AMPK, which in turn inhibits mTOR,
  a pathway implicated in lupus pathogenesis. Pioglitazone activates the PPAR-γ signaling
  pathway, thereby dampening inflammation, and also prevents the transport of pyruvate
  into the mitochondria, which is aberrantly increased in lupus immune cells. Amino
  acids and fatty acids are critical fuel sources and are required for immune cell
  activation and function.
