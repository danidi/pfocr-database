caption: 'As shown in “A” (left side), inflammatory stimuli, such as carrageenan,
  IL-6 or TNFα, applied at the terminal of the IB4-positive nociceptor, triggers the
  events that will lead to the development of Type I hyperalgesic priming. Activation
  of PKCε stimulates CPEB, release of calcium, activation of αCaMKII and local protein
  translation [; ; ; ; ], ultimately producing neuroplastic changes that are expressed
  as prolongation of the PGE2-induced hyperalgesia (A, right side). PGE2 hyperalgesia,
  which is dependent only on PKA in the normal state [], in the primed state is prolonged
  due to activation of an additional pathway involving Gαi-protein, PKCε and ERK/MEK
  []. In “B” (left side) the induction of Type II hyperalgesic priming by repeated
  activation of Gαi-protein coupled receptor in IB4-negative nociceptors is illustrated.
  The repeated administration of CPA (an A1-adenosine receptor agonist) or DAMGO (a
  mu-opioid receptor agonist)(*) [], stimulates a yet-to-be determined pathway that
  produces neuroplastic changes in the nociceptor, also expressed as prolongation
  of PGE2-induced hyperalgesia (B, right side). However, in contrast to Type I, in
  Type II priming the prolongation of PGE2-induced hyperalgesia involves the G-protein
  subunits αi or β/γ, depending on the inducer (**), PKA and Src. Abbreviations: IL-6,
  Interleukin 6; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor alpha; PKCε, protein kinase C epsilon;
  CPEB, cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein; αCaMKII, α calmodulin-dependent
  protein kinase II; ERK/MEK, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)⁄mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MEK); GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; PGE2, prostaglandin-E2;
  PKA, protein kinase A; Src, Src tyrosine kinase.'
