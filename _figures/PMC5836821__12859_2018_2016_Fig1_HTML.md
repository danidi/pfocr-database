caption: System design for BRCA-Pathway. BRCA-Pathway system structure overview. The
  left part is client side, and the right part is BRCA-Pathway server side. BRCA-Pathway
  server builds the database which contains structured TCGA multi-omics data and KEGG
  pathway data. Database is abstracted by virtual view which simplifies table join
  functions. REST API could get the data set when it throws query to database. These
  data set will be provided by Django framework so that the clients can access the
  data set by web browser or terminal. BRCA-Pathway web front-end receives the data
  set and visualizes for clients
