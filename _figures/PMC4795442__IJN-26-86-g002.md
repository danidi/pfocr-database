caption: 'Pathogenesis of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.
  Infectious, genetic, and environmental risk factors (a) are implicated in exposing
  cytoplasmic proteins in the neutrophil (e.g., Proteinase 3 and Lysosome-associated
  membrane protein 2), and, following likely interaction with T- and B-lymphocytes,
  the subsequent development of autoantibodies. Autoantibodies may also be generated
  to an epitope that is complementary to the autoantigen, such as anti-sense Proteinase
  3 (b), or via molecular mimicry, such as the bacterial adhesion molecule FimH. (c)
  A second hit, such as infection or loss of gene silencing, is often required to
  trigger disease. (d) Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies induced neutrophil activation
  also activates the alternative complement pathway. (e) In addition to complement
  mediated microvascular injury, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies also mediates
  endothelial damage by enhancing neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions and increasing
  neutrophil degranulation of cytotoxic agents and chemoattractants. PR3: Proteinase
  3, LAMP-2: Lysosome-associated membrane protein 2, FimH: Subunit of enterobacterial
