caption: 'AT2R-mediated molecular pathways involved in tissue injury. The AT2R can
  be stimulated either by endogenous ligand Ang II or by exogenous agonists (CGP42112
  or C21) resulting in activation or inhibition of multiple molecular pathways. This
  in turn leads to multiple cellular responses (grey boxes) including anti-inflammation,
  anti-fibrosis, modulation of apoptosis and enhanced neurite outgrowth. The MAPK-pathway
  and NFκB-pathway play central roles in the AT2R-mediated responses. Some of the
  molecular pathways are initiated indirectly via cross-talk with other receptors
  including Fas, TrkA and TrkB receptors by activation of the receptor or upregulation
  of ligand expression (e.g., FasL or BDNF). All pathways can be inhibited by the
  AT2R antagonist, PD123319, or by knocking-down the AT2R (not shown on the graph).

  represent either activation or inhibition). *growth factors are necessary for p85αPI3K
