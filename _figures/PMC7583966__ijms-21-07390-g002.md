caption: JAK inhibitors targeting JAKs of type I and II receptors. Based on cytokine
  profile inhibition of JAK/STAT pathway, diverse biological consequences are observed.
  Inhibition of JAK attached to γ-chain receptor resulting either in beneficial (blocking
  IL-15, high concentration mediated IL-2 transmission) or detrimental (inhibition
  of beneficial activity of low IL-2-impaired tissue healing and repair). Inhibition
  of JAK fused with gp130 receptor reduces IL-6 level. Based on the pathophysiological
  circumstances, reduced level of IL-6 may contribute to the reduction of heart survival
  pathway activity or favorably modify heart failure pathway. As far as IL-12 operating
  via p40 receptor subunit is concerned, inhibition of JAK results in reduction of
  IL-12-mediated signaling and exerts favorable effects on the cardiovascular system
  halting progression of atherosclerosis, reducing risk of developing ischemic cardiomyopathy,
  and myocardial fibrosis. Inhibition of JAK/STAT system transmitting signal from
  interferon receptor results in reduction of activity of IFN-dependent genes that
  translates directly to the reduction of foam cell formation and halting progression
  of atherosclerosis. Finally, some negative consequences may arise as the result
  of erythropoietin blockade with subsequent anemia development (indirectly contributing
  to worsening of heart function).
