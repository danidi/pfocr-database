caption: Cell death mechanisms mediated by FTY720 in fission yeast. (a) FTY720 stimulates
  production of ROS, which causes growth defects. Cytotoxicity of FTY720 is more pronounced
  in the cells that lack the components of the SAPK signaling pathway. (b) FTY720
  stimulates Ca2+ influx, thereby stimulating calcineurin signaling. Cells lacking
  the components of the Ca2+/calcineurin signaling pathway are hypersensitive to FTY720.
