caption: Overview of innate immune cells and their functions in the CNS. A Under normal
  conditions, astrocytes and other cells (not shown) form the BBB and blood-CSF barrier,
  microglia surveil the CNS, and oligodendrocytes form the myelin sheath around neurons.
  As well, T cells are present in small numbers. B. During inflammation, immune cells
  such as macrophages, neutrophils, B cells and T cells cross the BBB and enter the
  CNS. Activated astrocytes, microglia/macrophages and neutrophils secrete cytokines
  and chemokines to recruit, activate and polarize T cells. ROS and cytokines such
  as TNF-α, produced by astrocytes, microglia/macrophages and neutrophils, directly
  cause demyelination and neuronal damage.
