caption: Model for mechanosensitive P2X7/IL-3 signaling in neurons. Mechanical strain
  of the neurons leads to ATP release through pannexin hemichannels; this released
  ATP autostimulates P2X7Rs, leading to an influx of Ca2+. P2X7R activation leads
  to the release of multiple cytokines, including IL-3, dependent upon this Ca2+ influx.
  The released IL-3 autostimulates IL-3Rα/IL-3Rβ receptors on the neurons, providing
  neuroprotection via JAK2 signaling pathways. Together, this provides a signaling
  pathway to protect neurons from moderate mechanical strain and stretch.
