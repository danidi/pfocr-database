caption: Model of H. pylori-induced miR-155 expression in macrophage immune cells.
  Red arrow represents the T4SS-mediated miR-155 regulatory pathway. Macrophages detect
  the LPS characteristic of H. pylori via TLR2 and TLR4 receptors involving the adaptor
  proteins MyD88 and Trif, thereby up-regulating miR-155. However, there is an additional
  T4SS-dependent induction of miR-155 that is independent of the CagA genome segment
  studied here. miR-155 expression results in the down-regulation of miR-155 target
  genes, which have a general antiapoptotic, or anti-cell death, function in macrophages
  during H. pylori infection.
