caption: 'Top panel: In normal and during cholestatic injury, histamine receptors
  are found in small and large cholangiocyte populations. Expression levels of HRs
  have not been found to have a significant impact on cholangiocyte response, however,
  activation of specific histamine receptors results in differential downstream signaling.
  H1HR couples mainly to Gαq that mobilizes the IP3/Ca2+/PKC-dependent pathway with
  subsequent increased cholangiocyte proliferation. Our data suggests that the effects
  of H1HR are predominantly found in small cholangiocytes, as this population is known
  to signal via Ca2+-dependent pathways. H2HR activates cAMP-dependent mechanisms
  that increase cholangiocyte proliferation. Large cholangiocyte proliferation is
  regulated primarily by cAMP activation and our data has supported this concept.
  The H3 and H4HRs are predominantly inhibitory receptors that are able to either
  inhibit cAMP synthesis or activate Ca2+/PLC-dependent pathways. The result of H3
  or H4 activation is decreased cholangiocyte proliferation that we believe occurs
  mostly in large cholangiocytes. Bottom panel: During cholangiocarcinoma, histamine
  and the enzyme responsible for histamine synthesis, histidine decarboxylase (HDC),
  are upregulated thus activating specific histamine receptors. We have found that
  after activation of the inhibitory receptors, H3 and H4, cholangiocarcinoma growth
  decreases. H3HR activates Ca2+/PKCα-dependent signaling that decreases cholangiocarcinoma
  growth, whereas H4HR signals via Ca2+-dependent mechanisms to decrease EMT, ECM
  degradation and tumor spreading. We suggest that inhibition of the stimulatory H1
  or H2 HR will result in decreased cholangiocarcinoma growth presumably by inhibition
  of Ca2+-dependent or cAMP-dependent pathways. ECM, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial
  mesenchymal transition; HA, histamine; HDC, histidine decarboxylase; HR, histamine
  receptors; MMPs, matrix metalloproteins.'
