caption: Role of the ATM-p53 pathway in IR-induced apoptosis of developing CNS. The
  phosphorylation sites are shown for human p53. (A) Summary of genetic studies that
  have identified players in IR-induced apoptosis in the developing CNS under variable
  doses (2, 5, 8, 10 and 14 Gy, see text for details). (B) Radiation dose affects
  the requirements for Atm and p53 in apoptosis. At 2 Gy, loss of Atm or p53, or serine-18
  phosphorylation site in p53 (corresponding to human p53 serine-15 phosphorylation
  site), is sufficient to inactivate the apoptotic response to IR. While Atm through
  Chk2 can lead to p53 phosphorylation at Ser-23 (corresponding to human p53 serine-20),
  mutation at this site does not affect the apoptotic response in the developing retinas.
  With 2 Gy of IR, p53-heterozygosity is already showing defect in IR-induced apoptosis.
  Thus, IR-induced activation of ATM kinase and phosphorylation at serine-18 of a
  full complement of p53 protein from two wild-type alleles is required to induce
  apoptosis. At 14 Gy, Atm contributes to but is not required for apoptosis, whereas
  p53 is still required and p53 heterozygosity is sufficient to cause apoptosis. It
  thus appears that high-dose IR can super-activate p53 through Atm-dependent and
  independent (X) mechanisms such that half of the amount of p53 is sufficient to
  cause apoptosis.
