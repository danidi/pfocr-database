caption: (a) When the ERK1/2 pathway is intact, extracellular cues that are transduced
  via RTKs or GPCRs activate Ras under physiological conditions, or alternatively,
  Ras is constitutively active in colorectal cancer (RasΔ*), which preferentially
  activates the Raf–MEK1/2–ERK1/2 module. The nuclear and transcriptional targets
  of ERK1/2 are crucial for enterocyte and secretory cell differentiation, IEC migration,
  as well as cell proliferation under homeostatic and oncogenic conditions. Importantly,
  ERK1/2 activation also results in the activation of negative feedback mechanisms
  that suppress its upstream kinases (for example, RTKs, son of sevenless, Raf) and
  activate dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), resulting in the silencing of the
  ERK5 module. (b) Upon abrogation of MEK1/2 or genetic knockout of Erk1/2, the lack
  of negative feedback mechanisms (that is, feedback activation) results in upregulation
  of the Ras–Raf–MEK5–ERK5 module, which maintains cell proliferation under physiological
  conditions, or results in continued tumour cell proliferation in colorectal cancer,
  respectively. However, the lack of activation of ERK1/2-specific targets results
  in differentiation and migration defects of intestinal epithelial cells culminating
  in malabsorption, wasting disease and mortality. Compensatory upregulation of the
  ERK5 pathway in CRC can be reversed by targeted treatment with its specific inhibitor,
  XMD8-92.
