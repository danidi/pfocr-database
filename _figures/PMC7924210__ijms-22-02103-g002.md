caption: Simplified mechanism of the classical endocannabinoid ligand signaling pathway.
  (A) AEA biosynthesis and mechanism of action. In the post-synaptic neuron, NAT generates
  NAPE from arachidonic acid and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) due to a calcium influx
  following a depolarization event. The most common pathway involves the production
  of AEA from NAPE through the enzyme NAPE-PLD. However, in the alternative pathway,
  NAPE-PLC cleaves NAPE to produce pAEA, which is rapidly dephosphorylated via PTPN22
  to liberate AEA. NAPE-PLC is the exclusive AEA synthesis pathway in macrophages,
  key players involved in CNS regeneration. The lipophilic endocannabinoid then crosses
  the synapse via an unknown mechanism to interact with CB1 receptors on the presynaptic
  neuron. Activation of CB1 results in inhibition of neurotransmitter release through
  direct inhibition of voltage gated Ca2+ channels. AEA is catabolized in the post-synaptic
  neuron by FAAH to produce AA and ethanolamine. (B) 2-AG biosynthesis and mechanism
  of action. Following depolarization of the post-synaptic neuron, a calcium influx
  results in activated PLCβ which cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
  to produce both inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Subsequently,
  DAG is hydrolyzed by DAG lipase (DAGL), yielding 2-arachidonyl-glycerol (2-AG).
  The endocannabinoid then crosses the synapse similarly to AEA to bind to CB1 receptors
  on the presynaptic neuron. As with AEA, activation of the receptor leads to indirect
  inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Catabolism of 2-AG occurs in the presynaptic
  neuron, where the enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), cleaves 2-AG into glycerol
  and arachidonic acid (AA). [Created with Bio-Render, BioRender.com.]
