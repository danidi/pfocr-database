caption: Endothelial cell migration during sprouting angiogenesis. Schematic representation
  of a sprouting front of a vascular plexus with details of a tip cell (in blue) and
  stalk cells (in red). VEGF/VEGFR2 and BMP/ALK2/3/BMP2R are critical for activation
  of RHO GTPases, such as CDC42, that controls actin polymerization through formins,
  such as FMNL3, regulating filopodia and lamellipodia formation. Moreover, VEGF/VEGFR2
  activates serum response factor (SRF)-downstream transcription of genes regulating
  actin cytoskeleton and migration. ROS levels, inside the tip cell, are also important
  to activate MST1 that phosphorylate FOXO1. Phosphorylated FOXO1 will enter the EC
  tip nuclei and promote transcription of polarity and migration-related genes. YAP/TAZ
  transcription factors are crucial for the activation of CDC42 and for adherens junction’s
  integrity and stabilization. WNT5A/ROR2 signaling pathway is important for the recruitment
  of vinculin (VCL) to adherens junctions to enhance intercellular force transmission,
  fundamental to coordinate collective cell polarity and migration. JBLs and JAILs
  are important for the migration of ECs and junctional stability. Both these structures
  use RAC1-mediated activation of ARP2/3 in order to promote actin polymerization
  and lamellipodia extension. These intricate signaling pathways are crucial for the
  establishment of EC polarity and migration and the collective cell behavior during
  sprouting angiogenesis.
