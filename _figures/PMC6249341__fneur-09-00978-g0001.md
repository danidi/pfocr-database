caption: Implication of microglia in the development of Alzheimer's disease. (A) Several
  conditions are associated with an increased risk of developing AD. For example,
  variants in TREM2 ameliorate amyloid pathology in the early disease stage, but exacerbate
  pathology as the disease progresses. The TREM2-APOE pathway is responsible for switching
  from a homeostatic to a neurodegenerative microglial phenotype after phagocytosis
  of apoptotic neurons. Environmental factors also affect the microglial reaction
  to aggregated Aβ or phosphorylated tau. Head trauma also leads to a local increase
  in the levels of inflammatory mediators, which may stimulate Aβ generation and restrict
  phagocytic clearance. Likewise, microbiota influenced by diabetes or diet may regulate
  microglial phenotypes. (B) Aggregated Aβ or phosphorylated tau impairs synaptic
  functions, triggering the release of neurotoxic mediators from microglia. ATP, ADP,
  and adenosine activate NLRP3 inflammasomes, followed by the release of IL-1β. Similarly,
  glutamate released from gap junction hemichannels lead to massive neuronal damage.
