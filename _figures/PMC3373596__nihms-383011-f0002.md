caption: 'Pathway of EET synthesis and action in the vascular wall. EETs may function
  as an EDHF by two possible mechanisms: (A) EETs act as transferrable factors released
  from the endothelium and acting on smooth muscle cells to cause activation of the
  large conductance, calcium (Ca)-sensitive potassium (KCa) channels. This leads to
  K efflux, an increase in the membrane potential (Em) or hyperpolarization and relaxation.
  (B) EETs act in an autocrine manner on endothelial cells to promote Ca influx through
  TRPV4 or TRPC3 and TRPC6 channels. Calcium activates small conductance (SK) and
  intermediate conductance (IK) KCa channels to cause hyperpolarization and release
  of K ions into the sub-endothelial space. Potassium ions stimulate the sodium-potassium
  ATPase or inward rectifying (Kir) K channel. The endothelial hyperpolarization and
  K ion mediate hyperpolarization and relaxation of vascular smooth muscle. Gap junctions
  provide electrical coupling between endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells'
