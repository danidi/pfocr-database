caption: Schematic model of IFNAR and paracrine IFNβ roles in the pathogenesis of
  Ehrlichia‐induced liver injury. (1) IOE entry in HCs release cytosolic PAMPs and
  DAMPs (after induction of mitochondrial damage), which provide the first signal
  for activation of the (2) canonical (caspase‐1‐dependent) and (3) noncanonical (caspase‐11‐dependent)
  inflammasome pathways. (4) IFNAR signaling up‐regulates expression of nuclear HMGB1
  and its translocation to the cytosol through a common step with the noncanonical
  pathway of capsase‐11. HMGB1 can then induce apoptosis or pyroptosis of adjacent
  cells. (5) Cytosolic HMGB1 also binds to beclin‐1, which in turn (6) induces autophagosome
  formation and induction of autophagy. (7) As Ehrlichia hijack autophagy proteins
  for their survival, the formation of autophagosome enhances intracellular bacterial
  survival and replication. (8) A second signal for significant activation of caspase‐11
  and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including (9) IFNβ by activation of
  nuclear factor kappa B (not shown) is through (10) the binding of IFNβ to IFNAR,
  which can be considered a positive feedback loop in this model. Furthermore, caspase‐11
  activation is expected to promote further activation of caspase‐1 and consequently
  the cleavage and secretion of mature IL‐1β.
