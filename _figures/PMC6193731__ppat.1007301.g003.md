caption: 'Fungicidal drugs induce ROS accumulation in the mitochondria, and persister
  cells appear to use several mechanisms to cope with the high amount of ROS. (A)
  Miconazole-induced ROS in the mitochondria is detoxified by the overexpression of
  several SODs. (B) AmB treatment results in ROS accumulation. This leads to calcium
  accumulation and activation of the calcineurin pathway, thereby increasing expression
  of CaCMA1 via Crz1. CaCMA1 expression results in decreased expression of TPS1 and
  TPS2 and concomitantly results in apoptosis. In order to survive the apoptotic response
  induced by ROS, persister cells need to break the apoptotic feedback loop. They
  do so by up-regulation of stress response proteins (indicated in green). First,
  up-regulation of Hsp21 in persister cells may result in an increased glycogen content
  that protects the cells from the oxidative stress. Second, Hsp90 is also up-regulated
  in persister cells. Paradoxically, Hsp90 also activates the apoptotic pathway by
  activation of the calcineurin pathway, and concomitantly inhibits Ras1-cAMP-PKA
  signaling, decreasing the apoptotic response. Therefore, depending on the conditions,
  Hsp90 may determine the cellular fate of biofilm cells under stringent oxidative
  stress conditions and may direct the cells to apoptosis or the persister cell state.

  cells; all other lines: proven to occur in cells undergoing apoptosis. AmB, Amphotericin
