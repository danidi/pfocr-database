caption: Model for the role of Pkp3 in cell–cell junction formation. Left, activation
  of cAMP pathway upon cell–cell contact in high calcium leads to rapid recruitment
  of Pkp3-Rap1 complex to E-cad. At the same time, juxtamembrane DP coalesces at the
  sites of cell–cell contacts, requiring either Pkp2 or Pkp3, forming nascent desmosomes.
  Functional Pkp3-Rap1-E-cad complex drives adherens junction maturation by pulling
  the cells closer together and desmosome assembly by signaling the formation of cytoplasmic
  DP particles. On the other hand, Pkp3 acts as a spacer, preventing the aberrant
  coalescence of nascent desmosomes at the membrane. Pkp2 harnesses the activity of
  PKCα and RhoA to facilitate actin-dependent transport of cytoplasmic DP particles
  to the membrane. Right, model of steady-state adherens and desmosome junctions demonstrating
  mature cortical actin distribution and correctly sealed adherens junctions in the
  presence of Pkp3. In the absence of Pkp3 (not shown), Pkp3-Rap1-E-cad complex fails
  to assemble, leading to immature adherens junctions and failure of DP cytoplasmic
  particles to form. In addition, aberrant coalescence of nascent desmosomes occurs
  at the membrane.
