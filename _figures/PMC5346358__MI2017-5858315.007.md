caption: Mechanism of action of BNP inhibitory effect on LPS/ATP-induced IL-1β secretion
  in human THP-1 monocyte. BNP/NPR1/cGMP axis strongly inhibits IL-1β secretion by
  acting both at transcriptional and at posttranslational level. Firstly, by inhibiting
  the activation of NF-kB and ERK 1/2 signaling pathway, BNP downregulates the production
  of the inactive cytoplasmic precursor pro-IL-1β. Subsequently, again by inhibiting
  NF-kB and ERK 1/2 activation, BNP strongly downregulates all the elements of NALP3
  inflammasome/ASC/Caspase-1 cascade and Caspase -1 activation, essential steps for
  the formation of the active secreted IL-1β protein.
