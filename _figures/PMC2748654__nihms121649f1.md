caption: Taxol biosynthetic pathway starting from primary metabolism and including
  proposed intermediates, as well as metabolites which are proposed not to lead to
  Taxol production. MEP, methylerythritol phosphate; IPP, isopentenyl diphosphate;
  DMAPP, dimethylallyl diphosphate; IPPI, isopentenyl diphoshpate isomerase; GGPPS,
  geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase; TS, taxadiene synthase. Figure modified from
