caption: Diagram of glial–neuronal metabolism of [1-13C]glucose and [1,2-13C]acetate.
  The [1-13C]glucose is converted through glycolysis into one molecule of [3-13C]pyruvate,
  as well as one molecule of unlabeled pyruvate (not shown), in astrocytes and neurons.
  The [3-13C]pyruvate is then converted to either [3-13C]lactate in the cytosol, [3-13C]alanine
  in cytosol and mitochondria, oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase in astrocyte mitochondria
  (for simplicity this pathway is not included), or [2-13C]acetyl CoA in neuronal
  and astrocytic mitochondria. The [2-13C]acetyl CoA condenses with oxaloacetate and
  enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle. The 13C label is then incorporated
  into TCA cycle intermediates, and can exit the cycle at the [4-13C]α-ketoglutarate
  step to form [4-13C]glutamate. In GABAergic neurons, [4-13C]glutamate is transformed
  into [2-13C]γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) by glutamate decarboxylase (GAD). On release
  into the synaptic cleft, [4-13C]glutamate is taken up into astrocytes at which it
  can be converted to [4-13C]glutamine directly by the enzyme glutamine synthetase
  (GS), or enter the TCA cycle before conversion to [3 or 2-13C]glutamine. Ratios
  for the direct and indirect conversion can be calculated (see Materials and methods)
  and is shown in the figure as [glu–gln]direct and [glu–gln]indirect, respectively.
  Glutamine is transported back to the neurons where it is converted to glutamate
  by phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG). The [1,2-13C]acetate is taken up into
  astrocytes and converted to [1,2-13C]acetyl CoA, which can enter the TCA cycle and
  result in the formation of [4,5-13C]glutamate that is rapidly converted to [4,5-13C]glutamine
  by the astrocytic GS. The ratio calculated for direct conversion of acetate-derived
  glutamine to glutamate is illustrated by [gln–glu]direct. Glutamine can be transported
  to neurons and regenerate [4,5-13C]glutamate via PAG, and subsequently give rise
  to [1,2-13C]GABA via GAD in GABAergic neurons. The ratio for this conversion is
  illustrated by [gln–GABA]direct in the figure. *Metabolism of [1-13C]glucose in
  astrocytes leads to the same labeling pattern as shown in neurons in the figure.
