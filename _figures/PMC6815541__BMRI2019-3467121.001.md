caption: The probable mechanisms of the effects produced by lncRNAs on SCI. There
  are several lncRNAs that have been reported to play different roles mainly in the
  process of neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and oxidative stress following
  SCI. Firstly, lncRNA SNHG5 was demonstrated to increase the viability of microglia
  and astrocytes via upregulating KLF4. lncRNA MALAT1 overexpression could cause the
  activation of IKKβ/NF-κB signaling pathway via the modulation of a miR-199b and
  increased proinflammatory cytokines. Overexpression of lncRNA TUSC7 could inhibit
  microglial activation and the expression of inflammatory factors in microglia cells
  by regulating PPAR-γ through miR-449a. Downregulation of lncRNA TUG1 inhibited TLR4
  signaling pathway-mediated inflammatory damage via suppressing TRIL expression.
  Secondly, downregulation of lncRNA XIST contributed to the limiting neuronal apoptosis
  via as a sponge for miR-494 which ultimately regulated PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.
  Knockdown of lncRNA BDNF-AS was identified to suppress neuronal cell apoptosis by
  sponging miR-130b-5p and targeting gene PRDM5. Overexpression of lncRNA Map2k4 and
  lncRNA TCTN2 could reduce apoptosis after SCI by regulating a miR-199a/FGF1 pathway
  and enhancing cell autophagy, respectively. Thirdly, overexpressed lncRNA SNHG16
  could alleviate H2O2-induced cell injury by mediating miR-423-5p in PC-12 cells.
  Suppression of lncRNA ANRIL might aggravate H2O2-induced injury in PC-12 cells by
  targeting miR-125a. However, downregulation of lncRNA Sox2ot might relieve H2O2
  injury in PC-12 cells via regulating the miR-21-myeloid cell leukemia-1 isoform2
  axis.
