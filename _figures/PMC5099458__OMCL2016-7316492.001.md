caption: Canonical and noncanonical Notch signaling pathways. Notch signaling has
  a pleiotropic effect and is involved in cell survival, cell proliferation, cell
  metabolism, and differentiation. Canonical Notch pathway is primed by interaction
  of the Notch protein with a cell bound ligand. Upon interaction, Notch results cleaved,
  firstly by ADAM 10/17 protease and then by cleavage by the γ- secretase. Furthermore,
  Notch activated (NICD) translocates into nucleus and interacts with CSL protein,
  where, upon interaction, the proteins complex is converted into a transcriptional
  activator of targets genes. Noncanonical Notch pathways may be activated either
  dependently or independently of ligand interaction and may be γ-secretase dependent
  or independent. Noncanonical Notch signaling interacts with mTORC2, AKT, Wnt, HIF-1α,
  NFκB, and PI3K pathways at either the cytoplasmic or nuclear levels. The gene regulatory
  region of the major Notch1 transcript has been described to possess a functional
  ARE through which Nrf2 can regulate Notch1 gene expression. In the activated state
  (orange arrow, transient upon stress stimuli or constitutive due to mutations in
  tumor cells), de novo synthesized Nrf2 protein accumulates into the nucleus, where
  it activates the transcription of several ARE-genes, including NOTCH1. In the basal
  state (green arrow), Keap1 binds Nrf2 and induces its ubiquitination. Upon ubiquitination,
  Nrf2 is degraded by proteasome complex.
