caption: The pathways represent data obtained from both forward and reverse genetic
  studies. ENU-induced phenotypes are shown in red text. Note that TLR3, TLR7, and
  T:R9 are endosomal proteins, while TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, TLR4, as well as TLR5 (not
  shown) are expressed on the plasma membrane. Unc93b1 is an endoplasmic reticulum
  protein that influences endosome function. TLR activation recruits TRIF, TRAM, MAL,
  and/or MyD88 and leads to the activation of IRAK1 and IRAK4, or the TBK1 or IKKι
  family kinases. TRAF6 signaling to the TAB1/TAB2/TAK1 complex results in the activation
  of NF-κB and AP-1, via the functions of the IKK complex, Tpl2, and JNK. IRF5 is
  another means by which signaling through MyD88 leads to TNF production. MyD88 and
  TRAF6 may interact directly with IRF5 in a complex, activating IRF5 and promoting
  its translocation to the nucleus. Additionally, MyD88, together with TRAF6 and IRAK4,
  has also been shown to bind IRF7 directly in order to stimulate IFN-α production.
  This occurs downstream of TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)
  and requires the phosphorylation of IRF7 by IRAK1. TRAF3 is also involved in TLR7-
  and TLR9-dependent pDC production of IFN-α; TRAF3 may form a complex with IRAK1
  and IRF7 and facilitate phosphorylation of IRF7 () (not shown). In the MyD88-independent
  pathway, TLR3 or TLR4 recruit TRIF and TBK1, the critical kinase required for activation
  of IRF3. TRAF3 mediates the interaction between TRIF and TBK1. The kinase RIP-1
  is required for NF-κB activation downstream of TRIF, and likely requires the direct
  interaction between TRIF and RIP-1. The point at which RIP-1 signaling impinges
  on the NF-κB pathway is unknown (dashed gray arrow).
