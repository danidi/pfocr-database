caption: 'Human polyamine biosynthesis, metabolism and transport and the methionine
  salvage pathway. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) converts ornithine to putrescine
  and then spermidine synthase (SRM) appends an aminopropyl fragment derived from
  decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dc-SAM) to putrescine to form Spd. The dc-SAM
  is generated by the action of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1) on SAM. Spermine
  synthase (SMS) performs a similar task with dc-SAM to convert Spd to spermine (Spm).
  Catabolic enzymes like spermidine/spermine acetyl transferase (SSAT) and polyamine
  oxidase (PAO) allow for back-conversion from the higher polyamines (Spd and Spm)
  to putrescine (Put) as well as the formation of N-acetylated polyamines for cell
  export (presumably via SLC3A2 as seen in colon cancer cells). Abbreviations: AMD1
  (adenosylmethionine decarboxylase), AZ (antizyme), Cav-1 (caveolin-1), dc-SAM (decarboxy-S-adenosylmethionine),
  DFMO (difluoromethylornithine), MTA (5’-methylthioadenosine), MTAP (S-methyl-5’-thioadenosine
  phosphorylase), MTOB (methylthiooxobutyrate), MTR-1P (methylthioribulose phosphate),
  ODC (ornithine decarboxylase), PAO (polyamine oxidase), PTI (polyamine transport
  inhibitor), SAM (S-adenosyl-L-methionine), SLC3A2 (diamine exporter), SMS (spermine
  synthase), SRM (spermidine synthase), SSAT (spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase).
  Note: a direct back-conversion from Spm to Spd is possible via spermine oxidase
  (not shown).'
