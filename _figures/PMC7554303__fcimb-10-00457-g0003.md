caption: Schematic representation of immunometabolic and bioenergetic changes in a
  macrophage infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Upon Mtb infection, host macrophage
  is activated by sensing several bacterial proteins, lipids, carbohydrates through
  various receptors (such as IL-1R, TLR2, CD36). The macrophage activation leads to
  a multitude of hostile cellular, immunological, metabolic, bioenergetic changes
  toward bacterial clearance, denoted as M1. The M1 phase is characterized by an increased
  glycolytic flux (A), known as the Warburg-like effect. The changes during this phase
  are mainly brought about by NFkB (B) and HIF-1α (C), which induce the transcription
  of glycolytic enzymes. At the immunological front, pro-inflammatory cytokines and
  chemokines, including IL-1α/β, IL-6, IL-12, CXCL9, and CCL10, are secreted (F),
  which directly or indirectly contribute to bacterial clearance. During this phase,
  ROS is generated that is channeled into phagosomes to impose oxidative stress and
  as a signal for various cell death modalities. However, in the M2 phase, Mtb takes
  control over the cell and modulates the immunological, metabolic, and bioenergetic
  processes with the induction of PPAR-γ (I), PGC-1α and STAT-6 (G). They contribute
  to dampening the pro-inflammatory responses by secretion of IL-10 and alter lipid
  metabolism (H), favoring carbon rerouting through fatty acids and accumulation of
  fatty acids in the form of lipid droplets (D,I), converting the macrophages to what
  are known as “foamy macrophages.” PPAR-γ also contributes to the synthesis of PGE2
  and COX2 (I), which inhibit apoptosis and divert the cell toward necrosis, a cell
  death mode essential for the dissemination of Mtb. ESAT-6 signals to converts the
  M1 phase to M2 by reinforcing the GPR109A pathway, which has anti-lipase activity
  (E).The pathways related to M1 are shown in blue dotted lines, and those related
  to M2 are shown in solid pink lines. The upper panel (K–M) shows the distinctions
  in the internal membrane structure of mitochondria and the changes in bioenergetic
  metabolism with accumulated metabolites and up-regulated enzymes in red. The metabolic
  changes take a turn through increased glycolytic flux (A) and decreased OXPHOS in
  M1 as compared to M0 compare upper panels (K,L). The TCA cycle breaks at two points
  contributing to the accumulation of succinate, itaconate, and α-ketoglutarate (K),
  which display microbicidal properties at various points. The TCA cycle is reinstated
  in M2, where Mtb takes control of host macrophage by modulating host defenses through
  altered energy metabolism. NADP oxidase subunits occur more abundantly upon infection
  in the mitochondrial membranes. Besides, the Ca2+ dynamics play a key role in the
  homeostasis of mitochondria; an increased Ca2+ level causes mitochondrial fragmentation,
  which co-relates with the increased presence of fission proteins (DRP1/MFF) and
  decreased presence of fusion proteins (MFN1/2). Bioenergetic processes are altered
  as compared to M0 with decreased OXPHOS, ATP (L) that correlates with the decreased
  number of ATP synthase subunits. The figure has been made using the Biorender app.
