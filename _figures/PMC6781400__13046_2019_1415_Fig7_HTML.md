caption: Schematic illustration of the role of CyclinD1 to regulate Dicer promoter
  in ICC. In nucleus, CyclinD1 recruits SUV39H1/H3K9me3/HP1α/DNMTs complex to promote
  Dicer promoter de novo methylation, and results in euchromosome transforming into
  heterochromatin, which represses Dicer transcription. Then the Dicer-induced miRNAs
  form a positive loop to participate in CyclinD1 regulation via CDK6/CyclinD1 signaling
  pathway
