caption: Hypothetical model for the role of c-FLIPL in affinity maturation of the
  Ab response. This model proposes that the CD95 signaling pathway plays a central
  role in the selection of the B cell repertoire in the GC. Our data are compatible
  with the hypothesis that CD95 is oligomerized in GC B cells and constitutively connected
  with the proximal elements of its signaling pathway. Association of c-FLIPL in the
  CD95 DISC prevents B cells from undergoing apoptosis while they expand and somatically
  mutate in the dark zone of the GC. The existence of a preformed CD95 DISC in GC
  B cells would allow for rapid elimination of unwanted B cells (low affinity B cell
  mutants) when they are selected on the basis of their ability to capture Ag and
  present it to T helper cells in the light zone of the GC. We postulate that non–Ag-derived
  signals (possibly provided by the FDCs) maintain the expression of c-FLIPL during
  diversification of the B cell repertoire in the dark zone. These signals are no
  longer available as GC B cells move to the light zone where selection occurs. After
  the loss of c-FLIPL expression, the CD95 DISC becomes operational and promotes cell
  death unless GC B cells are signaled through their Ag receptor and cognate interaction
  with T helper cells.
