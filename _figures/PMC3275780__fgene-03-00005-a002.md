caption: T cell activation. The TCR complex (TCR α and β chains and CD3) and the co-receptors
  CD4 or CD8 are associated with tyrosine kinases of the Src family. When the TCR
  binds to an MHC presenting its cognate antigen, the co-receptors CD4/CD8 also bind
  the MHC molecule on the APC surface. The dephosphorylation of Src kinases by the
  phosphatase CD45 leads to their activation, and the Src kinases phosphorylate ITAMs
  within the receptor complex (red circles). ITAM phosphorylation then leads to the
  recruitment and activation of the kinase Zap70 and the subsequent recruitment of
  multiple other signaling molecules. One crucial event is activation of the enzyme
  phospholipase C γ-1, leading to activation of the three main signaling pathways
  that drive T-cell activation, the Ras-MAP kinase Pathway, the protein kinase C pathway,
  and calcineurin pathway. These pathways culminate in the activation of the transcription
  factors NF-κB, NFAT, and AP-1, initiating gene transcription and resulting in the
  differentiation, proliferation, and effector activity of T-cells.
