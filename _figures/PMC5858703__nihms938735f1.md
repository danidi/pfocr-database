caption: Shown is a schematic view of the Bloch cholesterol biosynthetic pathway.
  In peroxisomes, acetyl CoA is converted to mevalonate by HMGCR, a step that is inhibited
  by statins, and then via multiple steps into farnesyl pyrophosphate, which is then
  converted into squalene in the endoplasmic reticulum. This is subsequently converted
  into cholesterol via the steps indicated. Several cholesterol intermediates can
  act as RORγ agonists, but zymosterol and desmosterol exhibit the highest activity.
  Deficiency in Fdft1 or Cyp51A1, enzymes acting upstream in the cholesterol biosynthetic
  pathway, inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol and the availability of RORγ agonists.
  DHCR24 can convert 7-dehydrodesmosterol to 7-dehydrocholesterol, which acts as an
  agonist of RORγ. ACAT1, Acetyl-CoA Acetyltransferase 1; HMGCS1, 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA
