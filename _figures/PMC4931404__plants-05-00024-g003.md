caption: 'The fate of reductants derived from Glucose-6P dehydrogenase (G6PDH), and
  more generally Oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPP), in plant cells. (A).
  In photosynthetic cells, cytosolic OPPP provides NADPH for basal metabolism in the
  light. Normally, photosynthesis is able to sustain the request of electrons for
  nitrogen metabolism. Chloroplastic P1-G6PDH results inhibited by NADPH and thus
  OPPP is inactive in the organelles. (B). In the leaves, under stress conditions,
  there is an increase of cytosolic OPPP in order to supply NADPH for stress response.
  An increased expression of cy-G6PDH occurs, together with expression and synthesis
  of P1- and P0-G6PDH: this causes the formation of heterodimers directed to peroxisomes;
  there is the activation of a specific machinery formed by oxidative section of OPPP
  to counteract the stress; or for different metabolic functions in specific plant
  organs. (C). In the dark, or in heterotrophic tissues—under physiological conditions—chloroplastic
  (or plastidial) OPPP are activated by P1-G6PDH or P2-G6PDH, respectively, providing
  reductants for nitrogen assimilation in the dark/heterotrophic conditions. As in
  leaves, cytosolic OPPP provides NADPH for basal metabolism. (D). In the dark, or
  in heterotrophic tissues, under stress there is an increase of both cytosolic OPPP
  (by cy-G6PDH), and chloroplastic/plastidial OPPPs (by P1-G6PDH or P2-G6PDH, respectively),
  in order to counteract the stress. It is possible to hypothesize (?) the formation
  of heterodimers directed to peroxisomes (dotted grey arrows), but this has not been
  proven yet. It must be underlined that P2-G6PDH is able to maintain a high rate
  even at NADPH/NADP+ ratios normally easily inhibiting P1-G6PDH, thus sustaining
  the stress response in root/heterotrophic tissues (e.g. enduring drought/salt stress
  conditions). Abbreviations: NTR, nitrate transporters; NR, Nitrate reductase; NiR,
