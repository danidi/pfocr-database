caption: The ER stress pathway. Under situations of stress, unfolded and misfolded
  proteins accumulate and recruits BIP to the ER lumen. BIP dissociates from the ER
  stress sensors IRE1α (inositol-requiring protein 1), ATF6 (activating transcription
  factor 6) and PERK [protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase] and leads to their
  activation. Upon dimerization and autophosphorylation, IRE1 induces the splicing
  of XBP1 mRNA for translation of the transcription factor spliced XBP1 protein (sXBP1).
  XBP1s translocates to the nucleus and controls the transcription of ER-resident
  chaperones, components of the ERAD machinery and genes involved in lipogenesis.
  Activated PERK causes the phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation translation factor
  2α (eIF2α), which increases production of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4).
  ATF4 then translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of many genes
  required for ER quality control. Activated ATF6 translocates to the Golgi, where
  it is processed by S1P and S2P proteases. The cleaved-off cytoplasmic domain functions
  as a transcription factor and induces the expression of ER chaperones and XBP1.
  ATF6 activity is inhibited by the WFS1 protein, that through the E3 ubiquitin ligase
  HRD1, is responsible of ATF6 ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. ER calcium
  channels, ryanodine receptor (RyR) and inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R), control
  efflux of calcium (Ca2+) from the ER to the cytosol. Under ER stress activation,
  these receptors increase the levels of cytosolic calcium and activate the calcium-dependent
  protease, calpain-2, which promotes cellular apoptosis
