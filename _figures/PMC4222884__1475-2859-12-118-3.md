caption: Energy conservation mechanisms in C. ljungdahlii. (A) Shown is the Wood-Ljungdahl
  pathway with an emphasis on the electron bifurcation in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway
  at the methylene-tetrahydrofolate deydrogenase small subunit to generate reduced
  ferredoxin. The detailed Wood-Ljungdahl pathway is shown in Figure  . Reaction abbreviations
  are the same as those in Figure  . (B) Energy conservation through proton gradient
  established at the Rnf complex. (C) Identification of a gene encoding the electron
  bifurcating transhydrogenase for the generation of NADPH during autotrophic growth
  (Nfn complex). (D) Electron bifurcating hydrogenase for the reduction of ferredoxin
  from hydrogen during autotrophic growth. Yellow nodes indicate the oxidized form
  of reducing equivalents and blue nodes indicate the reduced form.
