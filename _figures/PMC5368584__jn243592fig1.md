caption: Pathway of glutamine utilization for the synthesis of citrulline. The infusion
  of 2-[15N]-glutamine has the potential to label the amido (5-) group of glutamine
  and the amino (2-), δ (5-) and ureido nitrogen of citrulline. The contribution of
  glutamine to citrulline synthesis was determined as the conversion of glutamine
  M+1 to citrulline M+1 (dashed boxes), the conversion of 2-[15N]-glutamine to 2-[15N]-citrulline
  (solid rectangle), and the conversion of [2H5]-glutamine to [2H5] citrulline (not
  shown for clarity). The reactions shown in the gray-shaded center box take place
  in multiple organs and cell types. However, the synthesis of CP and citrulline occurs
  in enterocytes, the site of production of most of the circulating citrulline. CP,
  carbamoyl phosphate; GSA, glutamate semialdehyde; α-KG, α-ketoglutarate.
