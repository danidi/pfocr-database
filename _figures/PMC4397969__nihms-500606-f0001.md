caption: Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is a two-signal process. “Signal 1”
  occurs by stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) by microbial or endogenous ligands
  leading to NF-κB-dependent upregulation of the pro-IL-1β. “Signal 2” is provided
  by a wide array of NLRP3 inflammasome activators such as nigericin, anthrax lethal
  toxin, β-amyloid, islet amyloid polypeptide and cholesterol and monosodium irate
  crystals (not shown). Activated NLRP3 binds to pro-caspase-1 via the adaptor protein
  ASC, leading to caspase-1 cleavage of pro- IL-1β and IL-18.  show that the mechanism
  for ω-3FA inhibition of NLRP3-mediated inflammation involves ω-3FAs interacting
  with the GPR120 and GPR40 receptors. Subsequently, the downstream scaffold protein
  ARRB-2 binds to GPR120 and GPR40 and the complex is internalized. There are reports
  that this pathway inhibits “signal 1” at the level of TAB1 and TAK1 kinases to inhibit
  NF-κB ().  also demonstrate here how “signal 2” is inhibited when ARRB-2 directly
  associates with NLRP3 leading to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release,
  and inhibition of inflammation.
