caption: In the liver, the classic bile acid synthesis pathway is initiated by cholesterol
  7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) to synthesize cholic acid (CA), which requires sterol 12α-hydroxylase
  (CYP8B1), and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). Mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase
  (CYP27A1) oxidizes the steroid side chain, followed by peroxisomal β-oxidation to
  cleave a 3-C unit to form C24-bile acids. The alternative bile acid synthesis pathway
  is initiated by CYP27A1, followed by a non-specific oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1)
  to synthesize both CA and CDCA in hepatocytes. CYP27A1 is also expressed in macrophages
  and many extrahepatic tissues for synthesis of steroid intermediates, which can
  be used for synthesis of bile acids in hepatocytes. In the brain, cholesterol is
  oxidized to 24-hydroxycholesterol by sterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), followed by
  a brain-specific sterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP39A1). Cholesterol also can be hydroxylated
  to 25-hydroxycholesterol by cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H). These oxidized steroid
  intermediates formed in extrahepatic tissues can be transported to hepatocytes for
  synthesis of bile acids. In the brain, growth hormone-Stat5 signaling may activate
  G protein–coupled bile acid receptor-1 (Gpbar-1, also known as TGR5) to regulate
  expression of CYP7B1, a male-predominant enzyme. In mice, CDCA is converted to 6β-hydroxylated
  bile acids, α-muricholic acid (MCA) and β-MCA by Cyp2c70. Bile acids are conjugated
  to the amino acids taurine or glycine for secretion into bile via bile salt export
  pump (BSEP). In the ileum, TCA and TDCA are taken up into enterocytes via apical
  bile salt transporter (ASBT). In the colon, bile acids are de-conjugated by bacterial
  bile salt hydrolase (BSH) and are 7α-dehydroxylated by bacterial 7α-dehydroxylase
  to form deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA). Conjugated bile acids
  are secreted into portal blood via organic solute transporter α/β (OSTα/OSTβ) and
  circulated back to hepatocytes via Na-taurocholate co-transport peptide (NTCP) to
  inhibit bile acid synthesis. The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is very
  efficient; approximately 95% bile acids are recovered and the approximately 5% bile
  acids that are lost in feces are replenished by de novo bile acid synthesis. Two
  mechanisms have been proposed to inhibit CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 gene transcription. In
  the liver, CDCA activates FXR to induce small heterodimer partner (SHP), which represses
  trans-activation of the CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 genes. In the intestine, CDCA activates
  FXR to induce fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15, or human orthologue FGF19), which
  is circulated to the liver to activate hepatic FGF receptor 4/Klotho signaling to
  inhibit CYP7A1/ CYP8B1 gene transcription via ERK1/2/cJun of the mitogen-activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In the liver, TCA-activated sphingosine-1-phosphate
  receptor 2 (S1PR2) signaling may activate the ERK1/2 pathway to modulate CYP7A1/CYP8B1
  activity. In the intestinal L cells, TLCA activates TGR5 to increase cAMP and stimulate
  GLP-1 secretion. GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion from β cells to improve insulin
  sensitivity.
