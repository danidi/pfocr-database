caption: Phosphorylation of the HPV E6 PBM links cellular stress response signaling
  to E6 inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity. The model shows how the E6 PBM
  can become phosphorylated following exposure to various stress-inducing conditions.
  Our results demonstrate the involvement of at least two major pathways. The DDR
  pathway through Chk1 activation leads directly to E6 phosphorylation, and Chk2 activation
  results in E6 phosphorylation via PKA. Other, unknown cellular kinases are also
  likely to be involved, for instance, those induced following cycloheximide treatment.
  Our studies provide compelling evidence of a direct link from the induction of oxidative-stress-induced
  DDR to the phospho-regulation of HPV E6 oncoproteins. Finally, we propose that phosphorylation
  of E6 contributes to the inhibition of p53 transcriptional activity, possibly through
  a mechanism involving 14-3-3 proteins.
