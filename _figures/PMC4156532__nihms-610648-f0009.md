caption: (A) From previous studies, Sestrin2 was shown to be a mediator of stress-induced
  autophagy. Stress-inducible Sestrin2 can provoke ULK1 activation through activating
  AMPK and inhibiting mTORC1. (B) In this study, Sestrin2 was shown to associate with
  ULK1 and p62 and directly promote ULK1-dependent phosphorylation of p62 at Ser403.
  Because phosphorylation of this site is known to facilitate autophagic degradation
  of p62 targets, our study provides an explanation on how Sestrin2 is required for
  proper elimination of ubiquitinated protein aggregates and dysfunctional mitochondria
  and for appropriate regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.
