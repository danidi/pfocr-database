caption: Specificity in SUMO signalling and conjugation. (A) Signalling functions
  of SUMO. Some of the known functions of sumoylation are indicated with respect to
  transcriptional regulation. (B) The SUMO conjugating pathway. SUMO is synthesized
  as a precursor and processed by hydrolases to make the carboxy-terminal double-glycine
  motif available for conjugation (vertical arrow). It is subsequently conjugated
  to proteins by means of E1 activating (SAE1(AOS1)/SAE2(UBA2)), E2 conjugating (Ubc9)
  and E3 ligating enzymes (PIAS family or RanBP2, not shown). The E3-like proteins
  might serve to increase the affinity between Ubc9 (E2) and the substrates by bringing
  them into close proximity in catalytically favourable orientations, allowing sumoylation
  to occur at a maximal rate. The resulting isopeptide bond is stable and its disruption
  requires a desumoylating enzyme. PML, promyelocytic leukaemia protein.
