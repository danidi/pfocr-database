caption: The Cpx response can directly inhibit ﾏウ by CpxR binding and repression upstream
  of the rpoE gene. CpxR directly and potently represses expression of abundant OMPs,
  including OmpC and OmpF. CpxR also represses OMP synthesis indirectly using OmpR-regulated
  sRNAs; CpxR does this by inducing MzrA to stimulate the EnvZ/OmpR signal transduction
  pathway. CpxQ production inhibits synthesis of the ﾏウ effector Skp. MicA, RprA,
  and MicF each interconnect multiple signal transductions systems. Major ESRs are
  denoted in orange; other signal transduction systems are in black; sRNA products
  are in blue; gene targets are in grey.
