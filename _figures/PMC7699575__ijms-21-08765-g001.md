caption: 'Ferroptosis pathway. Ferroptosis can be initiated through transferrin endocytosis
  linked to transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1). After endocytosis, ferric iron is released
  from the Transferrin–TRF1 complex and is reduced to ferrous iron (Fe2+). Fe2+ can
  be stored in ferritin or remain in the cytoplasm as a labile iron Pool (LIP). The
  LIP is composed mainly of Fe2+, which through Fenton reaction generates species
  such as: the hydroxyl radical that reacts with membrane lipids, providing the lipid
  peroxidation of arachidonic acid (AA) or adrenic acid (AdA). Lipid peroxidation
  can also occur via enzyme. However, it is necessary for the free polyunsaturated
  fatty acids (PUFAs) to be esterified as membrane PUFA by the enzymes ACSL4 and LPCAT3,
  forming arachidonic or adrenic acids esterified in phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE-AA/PE-AdA).
  Dioxigenation by 15-LOX generates PE-AA/AdA-OOH, which reacts with other membrane
  lipids, forming pores in the lipid bilayer, destabilizing it and then rupturing
  the membrane. Ferroptosis is inhibited by GPx4, which converts PE-AA/AdA-OOH to
  alcohol and water. This reaction occurs through the use of glutathione (GSH) as
  a substrate. GSH synthesis occurs via the entry of cystine into the cell by system
  xc−.'
