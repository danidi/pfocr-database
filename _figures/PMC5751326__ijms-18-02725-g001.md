caption: Interferon-β (IFN-β) signaling pathways and autocrine/paracrine loop. IFN-β
  signaling pathways may be MyD88-independent (TRIF or TLR3-4 pathways) or MyD88-dependent
  pathways. The pathway that is mainly triggered by TLR3 and TLR4 requires the adaptor
  protein TRIF, which leads to the production of type I IFNs. TRIF engages TNF receptor
  associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and NAP-1 (nucleosome assembly protein-1) to activate
  TBK1 and IKK. TBK1 and IKK lead to the induction of the transcription factor IRF3
  inducing type I IFNs. On the other hand, stimulation of TLR7/8 or TLR9 leads to
  recruitment of MyD88 protein, IRAK4), TRAF3, and TRAF6 and results in activation
  of IRAK1, IKK-α, and transcription factors IRF5/IRF7, leading to the induction of
  type I IFNs. Once produced, IFN-β can also enhance the activation of IRF5/IRF7,
  leading to augmented type I IFN induction. In addition to these main pathways associated
  with the production of type I IFNs, there is also an autocrine/paracrine feedback
  loop amplifying the production of type I IFNs. This feedback loop is initiated by
  type I IFNs and leads to the formation of the ISGF3 complex. Binding of this ISGF3
  complex to the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) within the ISRE-containing
  genes results in type I IFN induction.

  description: Interferon-β (IFN-β) signaling pathways and autocrine/paracrine loop.
    IFN-β signaling pathways may be MyD88-independent (TRIF or TLR3-4 pathways) or
    MyD88-dependent pathways. The pathway that is mainly triggered by TLR3 and TLR4
    requires the adaptor protein TRIF, which leads to the production of type I IFNs.
    TRIF engages TNF receptor associated factor 3 (TRAF3) and NAP-1 (nucleosome assembly

    transcription factor IRF3 inducing type I IFNs. On the other hand, stimulation
