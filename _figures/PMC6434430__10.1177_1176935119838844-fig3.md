number: Figure 3
caption: (A) ERK and (B) Ras signaling pathways were hyperactivated in the biopsy
  CCA tissue. Visualization was provided by Oncobox software. The pathways are shown
  as an interacting network, where green arrows indicate activation and red arrows
  indicate inhibition. Color depth of each node of the network corresponds to the
  logarithms of the case-to-normal (CNR) expression rate for each node, where “normal”
  is a geometric average between normal tissue samples, and the scale represents extent
  of up-/down-regulation. The molecular targets of sorafenib and pazopanib are shown
  by black arrows. ERK indicates extracellular signal-regulated kinase; CCA, cholangiocarcinoma.
