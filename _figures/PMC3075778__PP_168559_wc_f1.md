caption: The C3cycle. The carboxylation reaction catalyzed by Rubisco fixes CO2 into
  the acceptor molecule RuBP, forming 3-PGA. The reductive phase of the cycle follows
  with two reactions catalyzed by 3-PGA kinase (PGK) and GAPDH, producing G-3-P. The
  G-3-P enters the regenerative phase catalyzed by aldolase (Ald) and either FBPase
  or SBPase, producing Fru-6-P (F-6-P) and sedoheptulose-7-P (S-7-P). Fru-6-P and
  sedoheptulose-7-P are then utilized in reactions catalyzed by TK, R-5-P isomerase
  (RPI), and ribulose-5-P (Ru-5-P) epimerase (RPE), producing Ru-5-P. The final step
  converts Ru-5-P to RuBP, catalyzed by PRK. The oxygenation reaction of Rubisco fixes
  O2 into the acceptor molecule RuBP, forming PGA and 2-phosphoglycolate (2PG), and
  the process of photorespiration (shown in red) releases CO2 and PGA. The five export
  points from the pathway are shown with blue arrows.
