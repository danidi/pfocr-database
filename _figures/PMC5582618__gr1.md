caption: Free Fatty Acid Receptor 4 (FFA4) Can Engage Multiple Signalling Pathways
  to Regulate Distinct Physiological Outcomes. Agonist-induced interactions with members
  of the Gq/G11 G protein family, resulting in elevated intracellular [Ca2+], are
  observed following expression of FFA4 in heterologous cell systems. This pathway
  is also central to many effects of FFA4 in a physiological context . However, release
  of the satiety hormone ghrelin is sensitive to treatment with pertussis toxin ,
  defining a role for Gi-family G proteins in this endpoint. Many efforts to identify
  synthetic agonists at FFA4 have used receptor-β-arrestin interaction assays, and
  key physiological roles for such β-arrestin-mediated interactions include regulation
  of production of anti-inflammatory mediators from macrophages . Although often interlinked,
  effects defined by agonist-induced phosphorylation of FFA4 can be resolved from
  effects generated following FFA4 with arrestin . Further work, potentially involving
  the use of novel transgenic mouse lines expressing phosphorylation-resistant (see  in
  the main text) variants of FFA4 are likely to help unravel distinct roles of these
  regulatory interactions.
