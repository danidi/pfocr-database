caption: Bile acid synthesis and metabolism. Two major pathways are involved in bile
  acid synthesis. The neutral (or classic) pathway is controlled by CYP7A1 in the
  endoplasmic reticulum. The acidic (or alternative) pathway is initiated by sterol
  CYP27A1 in mitochondria. CYP8B1 is required to synthesize CA. Oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase
  (CYP7B1) is involved in the formation of CDCA in the acidic pathway. The neutral
  pathway is also able to form CDCA by CYP27A1. Primary bile acids are metabolized
  by gut bacteria to form the secondary bile acids, DCA and LCA.
