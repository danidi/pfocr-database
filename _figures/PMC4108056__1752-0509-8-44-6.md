caption: Schematic diagrams of Computational Models. (A) Model 1 is a Wnt signaling
  pathway whole cell model based on the full ODE reconstruction of the Lee et al.
  (2003) model with alternative binding partners not included and updates on binding
  affinities for mammalian cells. (B) Model 2 is a simple β-catenin compartment model
  with nuclear and non-nuclear compartments. Model 2 includes a binding partner for
  β-catenin and considers diffusion and/or active transport mechanisms. (C) Schematic
  of computational modelling stages/phases implemented in this study. Two stages were
  conducted, each having two phases with the experimental data used during optimization
  for each phase (1A, 1B, 2A and 2B). (Bottom inset) Phase A, steady state analysis
  where proteins were distributed among the complexes and Phase B, transient analysis
  due to specific perturbations.
