caption: An overview of our analytical strategy. Specific changes in bacterial growth
  conditions and genetic knockout yield high resolution LC–MS data from which active
  pathways are detected by computational analysis and experimental validation, employing
  metabolite profiling, nominating altered metabolites, modeling molecular formulas,
  evaluating pathway activities and validating detected active pathways with qRT-PCR
  and RNAseq. Black, blue and red arrows indicate chronology of events in the workflow
