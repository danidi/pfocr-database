caption: Modulation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Superoxide originates
  from normal mitochondrial respiration or from enzymatic sources, such as NADPH oxidases
  (NOX), uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), or p-450 (CYP) isoforms.
  Superoxide is dismutated spontaneously or enzymatically to hydrogen peroxide. Extracellular
  superoxide dismutase (ECSOD), intracellular copper, zinc SOD (Cu, ZnSOD), or mitochondrially
  localized manganese SOD (MnSOD) are enzymatic sources of this conversion. Hydrogen
  peroxide can also be produced directly by xanthine oxidase and NADPH oxidase subtype
  4. Under certain oxidative stress conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion, hydrogen
  peroxide can react with free iron to promote the formation of hydroxyl radical.
  Under normal cellular conditions the amount of free iron in the cell is low limiting
  the flux through this pathway (illustrated by light gray). Hydrogen peroxide is
  subsequently enzymatically reduced by glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), including
  GPx-1, as well as catalase and peroxiredoxins (Prxs). Catalase is primarily in the
  peroxisomes, whereas various Prxs localize to the mitochondria (e.g., Prx 3,5) or
  cytosol (such as Prx 1,2). Most Prxs utilize thioredoxin as a source of reducing
  equivalents, although Prx 6 appears to function as a reduced glutathione (GSH)-dependent
  peroxidase. Importantly, GPx-1 can be found in the cytosol, in mitochondria, and
  also in peroxisomes. GPx-1 utilizes GSH as a cofactor to reduce hydrogen peroxide,
  resulting in the formation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG). For simplicity, peroxisomes,
  thioredoxin, and mitochondrial GSH, are not represented in this figure.
