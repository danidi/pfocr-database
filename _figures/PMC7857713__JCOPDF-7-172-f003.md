caption: Although all the molecular mechanisms underlying hepatocyte damage are not
  fully understood, we already know that the accumulation of Z aggregates will trigger
  a cascade of stress pathways that will lead to the death of the hepatocyte and liver
  injury (chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC) (). Indeed, the apoptosis pathway
  is induced potentially through mitochondrial dysfunction. The induction of this
  death pathway is closely associated with the accumulation of the Z variant and has
  an important impact on the liver disease process. Hepatocytes expressing the Z aggregates
  have an increased caspase-activated mitochondrial depolarization and are more prone
  to apoptosis (). Therefore, the hepatocytes containing Z IBs are impaired in cell
  proliferation compared to the cells without or with lesser Z accumulation/IB which
  are promoted to proliferate to preserve the liver cell mass. In a vicious cycle
  of death and regeneration, the hepatic stellate cells are activated which initiates
  the hepatic fibrosis process. This hypothesis was also supported by experiments
  in which normal hepatocytes were found to have a selective proliferative advantage
  in the liver when transplanted into a AATD mouse model.
