caption: Putative mechanisms for activation and regulation of MAPK cascade by ROS.
  ROS are generated both intracellularly and apoplastically, and rapidly removed by
  antioxidant proteins (ROS homeostasis). Once ROS production exceeds the capacity
  of the antioxidant proteins, ROS may induce oxidative modification of MAPK signaling
  proteins, thereby leading to MAPK activation. ROS may also activate MAPK signaling
  via inhibition and/or degradation of MAPK negative regulators, e.g. PTPs or MKPs.
  ROS may directly act on MAPK protein, e.g. by H2O2-dependent sulfenylation. Extracellular
  ROS may change the activity of receptor-like kinases by redox dependent modifications
  to activate MAPK signaling, e.g. in cell wall metabolism and development.
