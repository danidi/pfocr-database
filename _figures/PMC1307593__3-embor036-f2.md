caption: A model of phytochrome signal transduction. Activated phytochrome (Pfr) is
  proposed to regulate transcription through several parallel pathways. A rapid response
  involves Pfr translocation to the nucleus, where it binds transcription factors
  of the bHLH family (in particular PIF3). Key regulatory transcription factors (RTFs)
  that are responsible for inducing a range of light-regulated genes are subsequently
  activated. In a second nuclear-localized pathway, phytochromes are proposed to bind
  response regulators (RR), which stabilize them in the activated form and can induce
  light-regulated gene expression by inhibiting COP1-, COP10- and CSN-dependent proteolysis
  of the HY5 transcription factor and by binding to activated cryptochromes (cry).
  In all cases, regulation of the genes responsible for photomorphogenesis is predicted
  to require chromatin remodelling mediated by the DET1/DDB1 nucleosome-binding complex.
  In the cytoplasm, phytochrome may activate gene expression through G-proteins (G),
  calcium and cGMP-dependent pathways, which are regulated by SUB1. In addition, phytochromes
  may be sequestered away from the signalling-competent pool by PKS1. Elements involved
  in signalling from specific photoreceptors or controlling specific responses have
  not been included.
