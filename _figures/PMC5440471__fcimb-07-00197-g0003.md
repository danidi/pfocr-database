caption: Manipulation strategies of neutrophils and the immune system by P. gingivalis
  at the later phase of infection. During a later phase of the infection P. gingivalis
  releases a penta-acylated LPS variant leading to the increased expression of L-
  and P-selectins on GECs and enhanced production of IL-8. This strongly stimulates
  neutrophil chemotaxis and transmigration to the site of infection. Moreover, P.g.-derived
  LPS and fimbriae strongly stimulate neutrophil pro-inflammatory and anti-bacterial
  responses, such as the secretion of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory
  cytokines, and the production of anti-microbial peptides and enzymes. An elevated
  secretion of these anti-bacterial molecules results in gingival tissue destruction,
  while many virulence factors secreted by P. gingivalis protect this periodontopathogen
  from the consequences of hyper-inflammation. The keystone pathogen is protected
  from oxidative stress, as it expresses ruberythrin (Rbr) protein. Additionally,
  the expression of Lys-specific gingipains degrades immunoglobulins at the hinge
  region, and, coupled with the activation of the TLR2 signaling pathway (by LPS),
  abolishes bacterial opsonization and phagocytosis. Also, gingipains manipulate anti-bacterial
  responses by deregulating the complement cascade and IL-8-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis.
  In particular, depending on the concentration and the position of gingipains within
  the biofilm, these enzymes can exert opposing effects. C3, C5, and IL-8 are degraded
  at high gingipain concentration or by gingipains associated with bacterial cells
  or vesicles thus inhibiting pro-inflammatory responses and protecting bacteria from
  elimination. In contrast, low levels of soluble Arg-specific gingipains activate
  C5 and C3 by limited proteolysis that results in the generation of C5a and C3a anaphylatoxins.
  Furthermore, under such circumstances, gingipains can selectively cleave IL-8 generating
  a truncated, hyperactive IL-869aa variant (written in red) acting in concert with
  C5a and C3a in order to excessively activate neutrophil pro-inflammatory responses.
  Additionally, the secreted penta-acylated LPS variant diminishes neutrophil apoptosis
  which delays the resolution of inflammation Together, these events strongly contribute
  to the inflammatory tissue destruction observed in periodontitis and to excessive
  bleeding, providing P.g. and bystander bacteria with access to nutritional resources.
