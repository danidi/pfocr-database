caption: Cigarette smoke-mediated oxidative stress can activate the IKK complex to
  phosphorylate inhibitory IκB proteins, resulting in their ubiquitination and degradation.
  This leads to the translocation of RelA/p65 into nucleus which is recruited on the
  promoter of pro-inflammatory genes. Alternative NF-κB pathway is also activated
  in response to cigarette smoke exposure through the cooperation of NIK with IKK-α
  to induce the processing of the p100 C-terminus resulting in the nuclear translocation
  of p52:RelB. Furthermore, IKKα-activated MSK1 in response to cigarette smoke induces
  NF-κB activation by phosphorylating RelA/p65 and altering chromatin modification.
  PKCζ, an atypical family member of PKC, regulates the activation of NF-κB via activating
  IKK, stabilizing IκB-α, and/or directly phosphorylating RelA/p65 in response to
  stimuli. NIK, NF-κB inducing kinase; IKK, IκB kinase; PKCζ, protein kinase Cζ.
