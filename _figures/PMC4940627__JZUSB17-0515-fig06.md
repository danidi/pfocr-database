caption: Schematic diagram of the mechanism of THs regulating gallstone formation
  in vivoFXR/RXR heterodimers which mediate phosphatidylcholine and bile salt transporters
  (ABC-B4 and ABC-B11) are down-regulated by THs. THs up-regulate LXR/RXR heterodimers
  thus affecting sterol efflux transporters (ABC-G5/G8). CYP7α1 (the limiting enzyme
  of bile acid synthesis pathway) is mediated indirectly by THs through up-regulation
  of LXR/RXR and down-regulation of FXR/RXR heterodimers. THs correspond to a decrease
  in the serum cholesterol level and down-regulation of hepatic LDLR (low-density
  lipoprotein receptors). Chol, cholesterol; PC, phosphatidylcholine; solid line,
  up-regulation; dashed line, down-regulation
