caption: 'a |Schematic illustration of a systems biology approach for identifying
  novel genes likely to affect spine plasticity in neuropsychiatric disorders. Exome
  sequencing studies of de novo variants are particularly useful for uncovering genetic
  risk networks involved in different disorders. Although many genes discovered in
  exome sequencing studies are individually nonsignificant, as a whole, they can reveal
  a mutational spectrum for each disorder and provide clues for the underlying pathways
  and networks involved in pathogenesis. In particular, genes with de novo mutations
  for which the protein products localize to the postsynaptic density (PSD) are excellent
  candidates for future studies on the dysfunctional pathways altering structural
  plasticity in neuropsychiatric disorders. To highlight such genes, de novo mutations
  affecting protein coding for each disorder were intersected with proteins present
  in the human PSD proteome (a proxy for the dendritic spine). The number of genes
  in each overlap is indicated (top panels). All of the de novo data were obtained
  from denovo-db (see ‘’) accessed on 21 September 2017. Additional studies for schizophrenia–
  that were not in the denovo-db were obtained from supplementary data compiled in
  REF. Only de novo variants affecting protein-coding regions or splice sites were
  included (that is, missense, frameshift and splice site mutations, altered stop
  codons, altered start codons, insertions and deletions). Human PSD proteome data
  were obtained from REF. . Gene ontologies (GOs) were then used to classify PSD-associated
  mutations into biological processes relevant to spine structure and function. To
  do so, GO categories from each data set were defined in DAVID (see ‘’) v6.8, accessed
  on 11 November 2017, using the functional annotation chart. Homo sapiens was used
  as a background, and the ‘biological process’ ontology (GOTERM_BP_FAT) was used
  to annotate gene lists. The following ontologies were used to cluster genes into
  functional pathways: cell adhesion (GO:0007155-cell adhesion), GluR signalling (GO:0007215-glutamate
  signalling pathway), calcium (GO:0006816-calcium ion transport) and GTPase (G00043087-regulation
  of GTPase activity). This analysis shows that the de novo mutations affecting PSD
  proteins cluster into distinct biological pathways to varying degrees, providing
  an overview of the contribution of each pathway to each disorder (bottom panels).
  The percentage of genes in each GO category is depicted on the y-axis. Exome sequencing
  data for bipolar disorder are currently insufficient to classify mutations into
  categories. b | Illustration of a dendritic spine containing different functional
