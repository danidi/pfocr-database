caption: Proposed epigenetic model of colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis associated
  with long-term exposure to a diet high in n-6 fatty acids (n-6HFD). Chronic exposure
  to an n-6HFD impairs adenomatous polyposis Coli (APC) expression through CpG hypermethylation
  (CpG-CH3). This favors the activation of downstream targets of the β-catenin/Wnt
  pathway, supporting increased expression of genes involved in inflammation (c-JUN,
  PTSG-2) and proliferation such as cyclin D1 (CCND1). The factors in dark grey boxes
  refer to changes in expression from the current study. The involvement of β-catenin
  and upregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by small heterodimer protein (SHP)
  are suggested based on published studies mentioned in the Discussion. FXR = farnesoid-X-receptor;
  IBABP = ileal bile acid-binding protein.
