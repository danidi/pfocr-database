caption: The schematic figure showing some of the microenvironmental conditions in
  the inflamed posterior eye in EAU with infiltrating immune cells and structural
  damage along with relevant inflammatory pathways. (a) A summary of biosynthesis
  of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and cysLTs (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) from AA from potential
  immune cells in inflamed posterior chamber. (b) LTB4 interacts with LTB4 receptor
  (BLT1), a G Protein Coupled Receptor, on the infiltrating macrophages and also T
  cells and activates signalling pathways. Th17 cells produce cytokines including
  interleukin (IL)-17 and VEGF. Producing IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα)
  by activated macrophages also enhances VEGF expression. The speculated signalling
  through LTB4-BLT1 pathway which leads to production of VEGF in Th17 and infiltrating
  macrophages showed by dotted lines. (c) The Hematoxylin and Eosin section from EAU
  shows histological changes in the posterior chamber of the eye with infiltrating
  immune cells in vitreous space and structural damages in retinal layers. (d) Fundoscopy
  of healthy eye, inflamed eye (EAU) with vascular inflammation and sign of neovascularisation
  during EAU progression has been shown in this figure. O = optic disk, V = vessel,
  iO = inflamed optic disk, iV = inflamed vessel, nV = new vessel.
