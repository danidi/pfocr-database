caption: Different input-specific signalling pathways activate β-glucan masking. Protein
  kinase A (PKA) signalling is required for iron limitation-induced, hypoxia and lactate-induced
  β-glucan masking (Fig. ). However, masking in response to iron limitation is not
  dependent upon adenylyl cyclase (Fig. ), unlike lactate-induced (Fig. ) or hypoxia-induced
  β-glucan masking. Regarding the upstream signalling modules, iron limitation activates
  β-glucan masking via the iron transceptor Ftr1 and the iron responsive transcription
  factor Sfe1. In contrast, lactate triggers β-glucan masking via the receptor, Gpr1
  (ref. ) and the hypoxia signal appears to be transduced via mitochondrial ROS signalling.
  Hypoxia-induced mitochondrial ROS signalling seems to lie upstream of PKA signalling.
  In contrast, iron-related Ftr1-Sef1 signalling appears to act independently of PKA
  signalling (Fig. ). Since PKA signalling is not required for cell wall elaboration
  or growth under iron-limiting conditions (Fig. ) this pathway might promote β-glucan
  masking via cell wall remodelling mechanisms that remain to be defined. Ftr1-Sef1
  signalling is required for cell wall elaboration and growth under iron limitation
  (Fig. ) and therefore might promote β-glucan masking by driving the synthesis of
  a relatively thick outer mannan layer (Figs. , ). Source data are provided as a
