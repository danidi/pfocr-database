caption: Multiple effects of ER-819762 on pro-inflammatory responses. Blue lines indicate
  the multiple steps at which ER-819762 was observed to exert an immunosuppressive
  effect in our studies. During infection or under conditions of chronic autoimmune
  inflammation, exogenous pathogen-associated molecular pattern stimuli (PAMPs) and/or
  endogenous danger-associated molecular pattern stimuli (DAMPs) drive immune cell
  activation in conjunction with antigen. In the case of Toll-like receptors, this
  signalling synergizes with the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-activated EP4 receptor signalling
  pathway to enhance IL-23 production by dendritic cells (DCs). EP4 receptor signalling
  in naïve T cells promotes their differentiation into Th1 effector cells via the
  phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, whereas EP4 receptor signalling promotes
  the expansion of Th17 effector cells via the cyclic AMP pathway. ER-819762 blocks
  EP4 receptor-enhanced Th1 differentiation and suppresses Th17 function both indirectly,
  by reducing DC IL-23 production and, as a consequence, Th17 survival, and directly
  by suppressing EP4 receptor-enhanced Th17 expansion and/or IL-17 production. However,
  it is unknown if these actions of the EP4 receptor antagonist can completely account
  for suppression of disease in the animal models, and other mechanisms are possible
  in addition.
