caption: 'Upper panel: The genes under the control of CRP are indicated under either
  purple background (the genes for sugar transport systems) or blue background (the
  genes for metabolic enzymes). CRP regulates the majority of genes for three pathways
  of sugar transport (MFS, PTS and ABC). The number in boxes represent in the order
  from left to right: The number of CRP target genes listed in Regulon DB (white);
  the number of genes identified to be regulated by CRP in this study (green); the
  number of genes predicted to be under the control of CRP in this study (yellow);
  the total number of genes under the control of CRP (orange). The numbers shown in
  parenthesis represent total number of genes constituting the respective transport
  systems, including those not regulated by CRP. Lower panel: Most of the genes for
  the enzymes involved in glycolysis are controlled by Cra  while only three genes,
  fbaA, gapA and pgk, had been identified as the regulation targets of CRP (shown
  in while under blue background). In this study, we identified a number of novel
  targets of CRP (shown in green under blue background). Furthermore a number of the
  genes involved in the metabolism downstream of glycolysis including PDH pathway
  and aerobic respiration were found to be the targets of CRP regulation. The number
  of target 0.5 represents such a particular case as fbaB<CRP>yegT (see ), in which
  one (fbaB) of the divergent promoters is known under the control of CRP but possible
  regulation of the opposite promoter (yegT) by CRP can not be ruled out.'
