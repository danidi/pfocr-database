caption: Cellular senescence pathway activated by NPM-ALK. NPM-ALK promotes oncogenic-induced
  senescence through de-methylation of p16INK4a promoter performed by Jmjd3. Multiple
  mechanisms participate in p16INK4a activation, including signal transducer and activator
  of transcription 3 (STAT3). Then p16INK4a inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and
  6 (CDK4/CDK6) allowing for retinoblastoma (RB) to induce cellular senescence and
  cell cycle arrest.
