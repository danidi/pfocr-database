caption: Glycolytic pathways in tumor cells. Sketch of the most important glucose-degrading
  metabolic pathways in a tumor cell. Glucose uptake into the cytoplasm is accomplished
  via specific transpcorters (GLUTs) that are often overexpressed in tumor cells.
  Here the enzyme hexokinase (HK) phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate (glucose-6-P).
  This metabolite either gets degraded to pyruvate via several intermediate steps
  of glycolysis or serves as the precursor for conversion into ribulose-5-phosphate
  in the oxidative part of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). In the PPP, CO2 gets
  released and the reducing equivalent NADPH is produced. The generated ribulose-5-phosphate
  either serves as the basis for de novo synthesis of nucleotides or is converted
  to various C3–C7 sugars through the transketolase/transaldolase reaction in the
  non-oxidative part of the PPP. Pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, usually
  gets transported into the mitochondria, converted to acetyl-CoA and channeled into
  the TCA cycle for oxidative degradation. In case of insufficient oxygenation, dysfunctional
  mitochondria or metabolic reprogramming through hyperactivation of AKT–mTOR signaling,
  pyruvate is increasingly converted to lactate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase
  (LDH). Lactate gets transported out of the cell by monocarboxylate transporters
  (MCTs). The PI3K–AKT pathways increases glycolytic rate by the mechanisms depicted
  and described in the main text. Dashed arrows indicate several intermediate steps.
