caption: Schematic representation of Hedgehog (Hh) secretory trafficking and apicobasal
  polarity of the Hh gradient. (A,B) Scheme of a transversal section of a wing imaginal
  disc to show the two proposed models of Hh gradient formation. One model proposes
  that apically secreted Hh contributes to short-range signaling while basolaterally
  secreted Hh forms the long-range gradient formation [,] (A); alternative model suggests
  that apical Hh fraction activates long-range signaling while Hh basal fraction contributes
  to short-range signaling [,] (B); (C) Hh secretory trafficking. Hh is secreted after
  synthesis, processing and lipid modifications in endoplasmic reticulum. The Hh apical
  pool is then internalized in a process in which Rab5, Dynamin and Rab8 are implicated
  [,,]. After this endocytic event, Hh follows the Multivesicular body (MVB) pathway
  to be secreted basolaterally (violet arrow) and probably travels associated to cytonemes
  (light blue arrow). These exovesicles (EV) most probably travel inside cytonemes
  [,]. Alternatively, other reports propose that the internalized Hh pool from the
  apical membrane is re-secreted apically (yellow arrow) involving, among others,
  endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and Vacuolar
  protein sorting-associated protein 4 (Vps4), and that Hh EV are formed via blebbing
  of the apical plasma membrane without implications of cytonemes in Hh gradient formation
  [,].
