caption: Mi-2/NuRD complex depletion in germinal center B cells leads to alterations
  in chromatin, checkpoint activation, and delayed progression through S phase. Disruption
  of pericentric heterochromatin higher-order structure results in activation of ATM,
  as well as downstream components of the intra–S phase checkpoint. This signaling
  pathway delays S phase progression by destabilizing CDC25A to prevent late origin
  firing, blocking cyclin B1 production to prevent progression into G2 phase, and
  accumulating nuclear Rad51, which stabilizes stalled or damaged forks and blocks
  further replication.
