caption: The nervous system-specific miRNA miR-124 is absent from neural stem cells
  (NSCs) but is expressed in their differentiating progeny, starting in transit-amplifying
  progenitor (TAP) cells and increasing in neuroblasts (NBs) and mature neurons. miR-124
  promotes neural differentiation, in part by directly repressing the NSC determinant
  SRY-box containing 9 (Sox9). Inhibition of miR-124 impairs adult neurogenesis by
  impairing cell fate transitions, as indicated. Ectopic miR-124 promotes premature
  neuronal differentiation yielding a transient increase in neurogenesis. This effect
  fades as the NSC pool is depleted via the loss of self-renewing divisions. (B) miR-124
  is maintained in mature neurons and affects neural function and behavior. Double
  knockouts of the genes encoding the cAMP binding proteins EPAC1 (also known as Rap
  guanine nucleotide exchange factor 3, RPGF3) and EPAC2 impair long term potentiation
  (LTP) and cause defective learning and social interactions. Remarkably, miR-124
  is not only transcriptionally upregulated in EPAC mutants, but substantially mediates
  their phenotype. Delivery of miR-124 antagomirs did not affect synaptic transmission,
  but restored LTP and normal behavior in EPAC mutants. Reciprocally, adenoviral-mediated
  overexpression of miR-124 in adult hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, respectively,
  induced learning and social behavior phenotypes characteristic of EPAC mutants.
  Finally, adult knockdown of the miR-124 target early growth response 1 (Egr1, also
  known as Zif268) phenocopied behavioral defects of miR-124 overexpression, implicating
  it as a key target in this pathway.
