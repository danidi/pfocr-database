caption: Proposed mechanism for transcription-dependent p73-induced apoptosis. In
  response to cellular stress, the pro-apoptotic, transcriptionally active p73 (TAp73)
  isoform transactivates pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax and GRAMD4 and apoptin, whereas
  the anti-apoptotic transcriptionally inactive p73 (DNp73) isoform inhibits the pro-apoptotic
  activity of TAp73. In turn, overexpressed pro-apoptotic proteins act directly on
  the mitochondria to trigger apoptosis. For the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, apoptosis
  is initiated upon binding of CD95-L to the CD95 death receptor, induced by p73.
  The apoptotic activity of nuclear p73 is indirect via these mechanisms. Dotted arrows
  indicate the activation pathway for the viral protein apoptin and the solid arrows
  designate the pathways for other human proteins.
