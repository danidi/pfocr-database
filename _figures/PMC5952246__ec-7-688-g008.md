caption: Effects of SCH and OH on p75NTRsignaling pathway. ProNGF, as a precursor
  protein of NGF, can combine with p75NTR preferentially. p75NTR activates the JNK
  pathway to increase the p53 signaling pathway. p53 and Bax play essential roles
  in JNK-mediated neuronal apoptosis. In the present study, maternal SCH and OH increased
  p75NTR expression in the offspring, thus increasing activation of p-JNK, Bax and
  p53 signaling pathways and thereby increasing neuronal apoptosis.
