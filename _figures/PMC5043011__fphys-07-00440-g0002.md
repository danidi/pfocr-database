caption: The CaSR-nuclear PTHrP pathway. CaSR activation in breast cancer cells, stimulates
  PTHrP production through increased intracellular cAMP levels and also promotes the
  proliferation and inhibits cell death in high extracellular calcium concentrations.
  The effects of the CaSR on tumor cell growth appear to be mediated by nuclear actions
  of PTHrP that decrease expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 and that prevent
  nuclear accumulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) which activates apoptotic
  cell death.
