caption: Release of the “find-me” signal, S1P, by dying cells upregulates EPO expression
  in phagocytic cells, such as macrophages. Signaling via the EPO-EPOR axis activates
  the PPARγ pathway, which increases levels of phagocytic receptors, such as MFGE8,
  MerTK, CD36, and Gas6. Mice in which EPO-EPOR signaling is disrupted display decreased
  clearance of dying cells and increased incidence of autoimmunity.
