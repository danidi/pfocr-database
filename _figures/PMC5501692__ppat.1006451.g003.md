caption: '(A) Overview of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway (adapted from []). A broad range
  of extracellular stimuli can activate the ERK1/2 pathway which starts with the activation
  of Ras. Activated Ras in turn activates Raf, the first kinase in the pathway. Sequential
  phosphorylation (shown by a +P) and activation of downstream kinases MEK1/2 subsequently
  activates ERK1/2 which can then translocate to the cell nucleus where it phosphorylates
  early response targets (including EGR1, ETV4 and ETV5). These targets act as transcriptional
  activators of several genes. Genes identified in the microarray data presented in  are
  highlighted in red. (B) Activation of ERK1/2 was directly tested in 293T cells transfected
  with HERV-K Env-Rec (or indicated control proteins). Western Blots were performed
  on cell lysates harvested 48 hours post transfection and membranes were probed for
  phosphorylated ERK1/2, stripped and stained again for the total form of the kinases.
  (NT: non transfected). Expression of both HERV-K and Ampho Envs was also confirmed.'
