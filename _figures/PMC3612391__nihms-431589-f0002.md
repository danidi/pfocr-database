caption: (A) Tip cell dynamics are regulated by Sema3E-Plexin-D1 modulating Dll4-Notch
  signaling via a VEGF-induced negative feedback mechanism []. VEGF directly controls
  the expression of Plexin-D1 selectively in endothelial cells at the front of actively
  sprouting blood vessels. In turn, Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling inhibits the activity
  of VEGF-induced Dll4-Notch signaling pathway, which controls the balance between
  tip and stalk cells, thereby the retinal vascular network topology.(B) Sema3E-Plexin-D1
  signaling contributes to proper vasculature formation after pathological condition
  such as ischemic retinopathy []. Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling counteracts VEGF-mediated
  signaling and the small GTPase RhoJ might be involved in modulating the two pathways.
  Under the ischemic retinopathy condition, abnormal extraretinal vascular projections
  are suppressed by enhancing Sema3E-Plexin-D1 signaling. (C) Plexin-D1 signaling
  induces soluble flt-1 expression to negatively control VEGF signaling in zebra fish
  truck []. During zebrafish segmental artery development, Plexin-D1-mediated signaling
  limits aorta’s angiogenic potential by inhibiting VEGF signaling via soluble flt-1.
  The specific member of Sema3 subfamily that mediates this event in the zebrafish
  is yet to be identified.
