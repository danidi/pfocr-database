caption: CAFs act on the Wnt pathway to promote tumor development. DNA damage caused
  by chemotherapy may result in CAF production of Wnt16B and SFRP2. Wnt16B promotes
  tumor growth via activation of the canonical pathway in cancer cells, which reduces
  treatment sensitivity. SFRP2 acts as a synergistic effector. SFRP2 may also participate
  in non-canonical pathways, such as angiogenesis, which indirectly promotes tumor
  development. CAFs, cancer-associated fibroblasts; Fzd, Frizzled; SFRP2, stable free
  radical polymerization 2.
