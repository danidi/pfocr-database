caption: Schematic representation of interacting fatty acid metabolic pathways in
  wild-type, D1, and D1o3-3 leaves. It is anticipated that the generation and maintenance
  of thylakoid membranes in all leaves would require approximately the same degree
  of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (blue pathway) and glycerolipid biosynthesis
  (purple pathway). The overexpression of DGAT (solid orange arrow) in D1 leads to

  of a suitably modified oleosin (D1 leaves), the  are unprotected from endogenous
  lipases, which results in the release of fatty acids (green arrow) into the cytoplasm,
  which are then normally degraded by β-oxidation in the peroxisome (black pathway).
  The overexpression of DGAT, however, creates an ongoing demand for elevated fatty
  acids in the . While these fatty acids would have originally been sourced from de
  novo biosynthesis, due to the lipase activity, they could now come from the -released
  cytoplasmic pool (olive long dashed arrow). This creates a futile cycle of  biosynthesis/hydrolysis
  and reduces the quantity of additional de novo fatty acids required for  biosynthesis
  in D1 leaves. In contrast, the coexpression of DGAT and Cys-oleosin in D1o3-3 leaves
  leads to the formation of stable  (dark red arrow), which prevent the exposure of
  the  core to endogenous lipases. Combined with the continual expression of DGAT,
  this creates a sustained demand for fatty acids that elevates de novo biosynthesis
  (blue pathway). In turn, this results in an increase in the recycling of CO2 from
  pyruvate within the chloroplast (bright red short dashed arrow). The consequence
  of this is an increase in the rate of CO2 assimilation. It should be noted that

  acid to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP; ), we have included a number of potential transporters
  (brown arrows), including the PEP/phosphate translocator (), to allow the model
  to utilize the cytosolic glycolysis pathway (light blue pathway) to convert 2-phosphoglyceric
  acid to PEP. This includes a potential pyruvate cytosol-plastid transportation step
