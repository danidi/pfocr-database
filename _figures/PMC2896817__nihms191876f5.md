caption: Proposed model for macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1)-mediated signaling
  events that promote actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Including integrins, FAK transduces
  stimuli from a variety of cell-surface-associated receptors like growth factor receptors
  and G-protein-linked receptors. But, due to a lack of clear knowledge regarding
  the MIC-1 receptor, how MIC-1 activates FAK is yet to be elucidated. However, MIC-1-mediated
  phosphorylation of FAK may promote phosphorylation of the RhoA-specific GDP/GTP
  exchange factor (RhoA-GEF), and thus, enhance activation of RhoA. It is also possible
  that MIC-1 may activate RhoA-GEF through an unknown mechanism, which further produces
  more RhoA-GTP. Later, activated RhoA may enhance phosphorylation of FAK. In this
  way, a positive feedback loop may regulate the activation of both FAK and RhoA,
  which regulate actin reorganization and cell motility. Mechanisms that are not fully
  elucidated are indicated by dotted arrows or question marks.
