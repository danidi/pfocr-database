caption: 'The major pathways of Cu distribution in human cells. The cartoon illustrates
  the main Cu distribution pathways in hepatocytes. The high affinity Cu transporter
  CTR1 at the basolateral membrane is responsible for at least 50% of Cu entering
  the cell. The low affinity transporters are unknown. Upon entry, Cu may bind transiently
  to glutathione and be retrieved from glutathione or directly from CTR1 by cytosolic
  Cu chaperones. Cytosolic Cu chaperone for SOD1 in a Cu-bound form facilitates Cu
  incorporation into SOD1 and the formation of an important disulfide bond. Atox1
  binds Cu within the Cys-Gly-Gly-Cys metal binding site, which is sensitive to changes
  in redox environment. Increase in the GSH : GSSG ratio increases the reduction of
  Atox metal-binding site, enabling more Cu binding to Atox1 and thus increasing the
  delivery of Cu to the secretory pathway. In the TGN, Cu-transporting ATPase ATP7B
  transfers Cu to ceruloplasmin, which is then secreted across the basolateral membrane.
  Cu elevation triggers trafficking of ATP7B from the trans-Golgi network toward the
  apical membrane (ATP7A in other cells traffics to basolateral membrane in response
  to high Cu), thus facilitating export of excess Cu. Complex set of soluble and membrane-bound
  chaperones facilitates Cu transfer to mitochondria.'
