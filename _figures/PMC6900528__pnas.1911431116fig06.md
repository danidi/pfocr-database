caption: Schematic of the proposed pathway of IPs synthesis. The lipid pathway of
  IPs synthesis (green), foresees the synthesis of IP3 by PLC as the starting point
  for the generation of the whole spectrum of IPs. Our data indicate that the soluble
  route (red) starts from the conversion of G6P to IP1 by ISYNA1, and continues with
  ITPK1 converting IP1 to higher phosphorylated species. The existence of an inositol
  kinase, described in plants, amoebae, and archaea, remains to be demonstrated in
  mammals.
