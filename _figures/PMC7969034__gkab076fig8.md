caption: A working model of IFI16/p204 recognizing dsDNA to active downstream signaling
  pathway. In the absence of DNA, IFI16/p204 presents an extended conformation in
  the cytoplasm. Once recognizing dsDNA from invading virus, IFI16/p204 HINab domain
  synergistically binds to dsDNA. More HINab molecules bind to the long dsDNA and
  form a C-ring shaped structure around dsDNA. The binding of dsDNA stabilizes the
  dimerization of HINa domain, resulting in the adjacent N-terminal PYD domain are
  closer and aggregate to activate STING. Activated STING leads to the phosphorylation
  of TBK1 and IRF3 and induces the production of IFNβ and other proinflammatory cytokines
  to defend against the virus infection.
