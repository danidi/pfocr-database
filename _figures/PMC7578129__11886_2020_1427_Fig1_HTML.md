caption: 'Inclisiran: mechanism of action. Inclisiran is a long-acting, synthetic
  siRNA directed against proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), conjugated
  to triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine carbohydrates, which bind to abundant liver-expressed
  asialoglycoprotein receptors, leading to a rapid uptake of inclisiran specifically
  into hepatocytes. Inclisiran engages the natural pathway of RNA interference (RNAi)
  by binding to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) intracellularly, enabling
  it to catalytically cleave PCSK9 messenger RNA (mRNA), which itself is then degraded,
  inhibiting translation into PCSK9. With less PCSK9 available, more low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol
  (LDL-C) receptors can be recycled to the hepatic membrane for LDL-C uptake'
