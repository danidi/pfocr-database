caption: Pathological effects of chronic oxidative stress. Major sources of reactive
  oxygen species (ROS) involved in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and obesity
  are shown. The factors responsible for elevated chronic oxidative stress include
  inflammatory processes via cytokine receptors (CR), increased free-fatty acids (FFA)
  via Toll-like receptor (TLR), and hyperglycemia, which promote ROS emission from
  the NADPH oxidase system (Nox) and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) as well as xanthine
  oxidase (XO) and the mitochondria. Binding of advanced glycation end products (AGE)
  to its receptor (RAGE) can further stimulate Nox-mediated ROS release. Increased
  mitochondrial oxidation from nutrient overload and participation of monoamine oxidase
  (MAO) and mitochondrial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (mGDPH) can contribute
  to excess intracellular ROS production, which can cause oxidative damage to DNA,
  proteins, and lipids and also activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  pathway and C-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), contributing to impaired insulin signaling
  and glucose uptake. Elevated intracellular diacylglycerols (DAG) and ceramides (CER)
  also interfere with insulin signaling. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress via the
  unfolded protein response (UPR) remains an important source for increased ROS generation.
  Calcium release from the ER can enhance cytochrome c release and interfere with
  electron transfer within the electron transfer system, thereby further increasing
  mitochondrial ROS generation. AKT protein kinase B, CI–CV mitochondrial complex
  I–V, ERK extracellular signal-regulated kinase, GLUT4 glucose transporter 4, IR
  insulin receptor, IRS insulin receptor substrate, PI3K phosphoinositide 3-kinase.
  Arrows denote activation, red lines indicate inhibition, and words in red represent
  the most important outcome of oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules
