caption: Postendocytic sorting of receptors along the endolysosomal pathway. Nascent
  endocytic vesicles undergo multiple rounds of homotypic and heterotypic fusion at
  the cell periphery, forming Rab5-positive early endosomes bearing either EEA1 or
  APPL1 scaffold proteins. Receptors can either be recycled quickly from early endosomes
  in a Rab35- or Rab25-dependent manner, sorted into tubular structures that collect
  to form perinuclear recycling endosomes before returning the surface in a Rab11-dependent
  manner, or be retained in the vacuolar portion of early endosomes that migrate to
  the cell interior along microtubules while they mature into late endosomes in a
  Rab7-dependent manner. During endosome maturation, the ESCRT machinery selects ubiquitinated
  cargo for packaging into intraluminal vesicles forming multivesicular bodies that
  fuse with lysosomes, delivering their content for degradation. CIE, clathrin independent.
