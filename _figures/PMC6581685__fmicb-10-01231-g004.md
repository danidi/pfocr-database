caption: Metabolic pathway of crude agarose in Flammeovirga pacifica WPAGA1. Sulfatases
  and β-agarases (main GH86 and GH16 family) were transported into the bacterial surface;
  sulfated agarose was desulfurized by sulfatase to produce agarose and hydrolyzed
  to generate NA4 and NA6; then NA4 and NA6 entered into the bacterial cell and were
  hydrolyzed by GH50 family β-agarase Aga2660 to produce NA2, and D-galactose and
  AHG were produced by hydrolysis of NA2 using GH117 family glycoside hydrolase. Finally,
  D-galactose entered into the galactose metabolic pathway, and AHG was catalyzed
  by AHG dehydrogenase and AHGA cycloisomerase to form KDGal, which was finally utilized
  by the TCA cycle.
