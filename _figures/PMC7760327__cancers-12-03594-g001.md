  stored in its main storage reservoir, the mitochondria, where the proteins COX17,
  Sco1, and Sco2 play a role in its incorporation into complex IV of the respiratory
  chain (green arrows). Nevertheless, in the mitochondrial pathway, the identity of
  the chaperone that carries Cu across the mitochondrial membranes is not clearly
  identified. The excess Cu can also be sequestered by metallothioneins (MT) and/or
  bound by glutathione (GSH; dashed purple arrows). (A) In hepatocytes, copper can
  be secreted via the bile duct or released in the blood stream bound to ceruloplasmin
  (Cp) after transport by Atox1 and ATP7B proteins (blue arrows) and transit in the
  trans-Golgi network (TGN). Cu is released into the blood stream and travels by binding
  to Cp, amino acids (AA), or albumin. (B) In fibroblasts, ATP7A carries Cu from Atox1
  to the TGN for its integration into lysyl oxidase (LOX) or extracellular superoxide
  dismutase 3 (SOD3) before their extracellular release. In addition, the excess intracellular
  Cu can be removed from the cell through ATP7A and ATP7B.
