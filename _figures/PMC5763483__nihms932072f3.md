caption: A potential cascade of molecular events leading to reduced differentiation
  of regulatory T cells for prevention of autoimmunity. Apoptosis of acinar cells
  in the salivary gland occurs as a biphasic event, first during early gland development,
  then during the clinical phase of disease. Studies suggest that C1q and the alternative
  complement is an active factor in the clearance of apoptotic cells and debris. However,
  the genes of the moesin signal transduction pathway that normally leads to Il2 gene
  activation are not up-regulated. Il-2 is an important factor in activation of the
  Foxp3 gene, thus a reduced IL-2 level, in turn, is hypothesized here to prevent
  proper activation of TREG cells.
