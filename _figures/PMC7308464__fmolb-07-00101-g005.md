caption: 'Nutritional immunity response in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. (A) Excess of extracellular
  iron is bound to Fur protein that inhibits transcription of PrrF1 and PrrF2. (B)
  PrrF1 and PrfF2 bind to the SD site by mediation of Hfq and block the translation
  of antR. (C) AntR has a positive effect over anthranilate degradation genes. Another
  sRNA, PhrS, allows the transcription of pqsR. (D) PqsR is an important regulator,
  which together with RhlR and LasR have key regulatory effects over genes belonging
  to the anthranilate degradation pathway (shown in panel C). CyM, Cytoplasmic membrane,
  OuM, Outer membrane; PG, peptidoglycan. Black thick arrows indicate flow of a biological
  process, e.g., protein translation. Green thick arrows indicate activation (equal
