caption: 'The pathway of BRL3 signaling. Brassinosteroid receptors BRL1, BRL3, and
  BRI1/BAK1 trigger the BR signaling pathway (proteins of the BR signaling system
  are shown in gray). BRL2 is not connected to this system. Solid lines represent
  protein–protein interactions presented in PAIR, IntAct, and BioGRID, and dashed
  lines represent possible interactions taken from STRING. Dotted lines represent
  transcriptional regulation. Green lines indicate signaling in the module BRL3 →
  BSK1/3 → BSU1 ―‖ BIN2. BIN2 regulates expression of BZR1 and BES1. BIN2 regulates
  drought tolerance directly by activating RD26, indirectly via BZR1-DREB1B and SnRK2.2/2.3-ABF2-DREB2A
  pathways. BIN2 also interacts with ICE1, implementing time-dependent regulation
  of the SnRK2.6/OST1-HOS1-ICE1 cold signaling module. Finally, BIN2 activates ABI5,
  an important concentrator of ABA signals. Red protein labels indicate that these
  proteins are involved in stress memory generation. These interactions were visualized
  using the program Cytoscape as described previously []. The data loaded into the
  program were obtained from PAIR version 3.3 [http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/pair/]. The
  protein–protein interactions presented in PAIR were supplemented with data from
