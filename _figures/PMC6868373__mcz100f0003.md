caption: Strigolactone biosynthetic pathway originating from β-carotene in plastids.
  ① D27 isomerise all-trans-β-carotene to form 9-cis-β-carotene; ② CCD7 cleavage of
  9-cis-β-carotene to yield 9-cis-β-apo-10′-carotenal and β-ionone; ③ carlactone is
  produced from 9-cis-β-apo-10′-carotenal by CCD8; ④ carlactone is exported from the
  plastid into the cytoplasm; MAX1 catalyses the biosynthesis of ⑤ carlactonoic acid
  from carlactone and the conversion of carlactonoic acid to ⑥ methyl carlactonoate;
  ⑦ 5-deoxystrigol; ⑧ strigol directly as seen in moonseed; ⑨ strigol via 5-deoxystrigol
  as seen in cotton; ⑩ 4-deoxyorobanchol, ⑪ orobanchol directly in cowpea, and ⑫ orobanchol
  via 4-deoxyorobanchol as in rice.
