caption: Schematic representation of the proposed therapeutic strategy to improve
  the efficacy of PKM targeting therapy in cancer cells in the background of the cellular
  status of the LKB1-AMPK pathway. A, the effect of the bioenergetic sensor, LKB1-AMPK
  signaling on cellular metabolic pathways to preserve energy homeostasis. B, the
  pro-growth metabolic phenotype of tumor cells that lacks or expresses a nonfunctional
  LKB1 (i.e. somatic mutation, promoter hypermethylation, or exonic deletion) and
  thus fails to activate the bio-energetic sensor AMPK. C, the therapeutic efficacy
  of PKM2 or PKM1 silencing in tumor cells that lack LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway to
  rewire metabolic phenotype and to restore the perturbed ATP level. D, the metabolic
  phenotype of tumor cells that possess the intact bio-energetic sensors, LKB1-AMPK
  signaling pathway. E, the mechanistic insight of LKB1-AMPK mediated metabolic rewiring
  and the restored energy homeostasis that confers treatment resistance against PKM
  silencing in cancer cells. F, the proposed therapeutic scheme of inducing synthetic
  lethality in cancer cells by targeting the pro-growth metabolism by silencing PKM
  isoforms and reducing resistance toward apoptosis by targeting the AMPK pathway.
