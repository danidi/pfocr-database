caption: SMase catalyze SM to produce Cer, while CDase catalyze Cer to produce Sph,
  and S1P can be generated by SphKs. After it is generated, S1P is secreted outside
  the cell by S1P transporter or degraded as ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecanal
  by S1PL rather than accumulating in cells under normal circumstances. S1PRs are
  a kind of G protein coupled receptors. Through binding to different receptors, S1P
  regulates many physiological or pathological processes.
