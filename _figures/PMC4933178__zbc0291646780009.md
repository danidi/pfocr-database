caption: Working model for the regulation of the quorum-sensing signaling pathway
  by cell density and iron in V. vulnificus. At low cell density, phosphorylated LuxO
  activates σ54-dependent transcription of the five qrr genes to different degrees
  and with different patterns. It is possible that the expression of each qrr gene
  is also affected by environmental factors other than cell density and that each
  Qrr has its own target genes to regulate. Qrr redundantly represses expression of
  SmcR with assistance from Hfq. SmcR is a global transcriptional regulator involved
  in regulation of various virulence factors, including activation of vvpE and repression
  of vvhA. The Fur-iron complex directly represses the expression of both Qrr and
  SmcR. Iron also inhibits the transcription of luxO and the five qrr genes, possibly
  through an unidentified factor labeled X.
