caption: Schematic representation of the study aim. High fat diet (HFD) causes gut
  dysbiosis (via decreased short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and Bacteroides, and increased
  Firmicutes and Proteobacteria) resulting in increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production
  and LPS/TLR4 pathway activation in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. Consequently,
  molecular remodeling occurs by increasing proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6,
  and TNF-α) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9). Due to the mentioned
  consequences, functional remodeling occurs, by an increase of proinflammatory cytokines,
  RANKL, and the decrease of OPG. Osteoclastogenesis and alveolar bone loss are promoted
  by disturbance in expression and activity of MMPs, matrix degradation, and gingival
  blood flow. This together cause periodontal disease and possibility of tooth loss.
  Probiotics maids mitigate all these consequences.
