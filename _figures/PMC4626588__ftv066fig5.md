caption: 'Proposed model of cell wall lipid reorganization in M. tuberculosis. The
  beta-oxidation cycle of M. tuberculosis has two pathways that lead to the synthesis
  of either acetyl-CoA/malonyl CoA or propionyl-CoA/methylmalonyl-CoA (Munoz-Elias
  and McKinney ). The synthesis of these metabolites is determined according to cytoplasmic
  availability of fatty acid precursors. In wild-type M. tuberculosis, the mce1 operon
  (a putative MA importer) is repressed during the first 4–8 weeks of infection in
  mice (Uchida et al. ), or when the organism is intracellular (Casali, White and
  Riley ). During this period, the acetyl-CoA pathway may be favored, which causes
  gradual free mycolate (FM) accumulation on the bacterial surface (Cantrell et al.
  ) with a block in MA import (indicated in red) (Dunphy et al. ), while diacylated
  sulfoglycolipid (Ac2SGL), poly and diacyltrehalose (PAT/DAT) and phthiocerol dimycocerosates
  (PDIM) export decreases (indicated in blue). The cell wall thickened with excess
  FM allows M. tuberculosis to resist host effector cells and molecules. However,
  the thickened cell wall also limits nutrient uptake, which eventually triggers a
  starvation response, which will induce the mce1 operon to be turned on and M. tuberculosis
  to synthesize the MA transporter in the inner membrane to import MA from its surface
  back into the cytoplasm (Dunphy et al. ). The imported MA degraded in the cytoplasm
  enters the propionyl CoA/methylmalonyl CoA synthetic pathway that will favor transport
  of proinflammatory lipids to the bacterial surface and bacterial replication. Although
  we have no evidence that these lipid changes actually occur in vivo, we hypothesize
  that these lipid changes in the cell wall may induce different host responses that
  determine clinical outcome of an infection. The rapid progression to death in mice
  infected with the mce1 operon mutant (Shimono et al. ), which is constitutively
  diminished in its ability to import FM (Dunphy et al. ), is an example of a clinical
  outcome that may be due to the cell wall lipid changes in this mutant. (AG: arabinogalactan
