caption: Apoptosis signaling in response to infection. Extracellular and intracellular
  Viral RNA (vRNA) fragments (left) activate TLR3 and RIG-I, respectively, resulting
  in IRF-3 activation. Cytoplasmic viral, bacterial or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is
  detected by cGAS, which in turn activates the STING pathway, leading to apoptotic
  signaling via a putative IRF-3 driven mechanism. Apoptosis can be triggered by effector
  cells of the immune system. Ligation of the FASR (right) leads to the assembly of
  the adaptor FADD and caspase-8 containing DISC, resulting in the activation of caspase-8.
  Activation of caspase-8 either results in the direct cleavage of caspase-3/7 or
  leads to the BID cleavage (tBID) driven amplification loop of the intrinsic pathway.
  The secretion of the pro-apoptotic perforin and granzyme-B (middle) triggers the
  activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
