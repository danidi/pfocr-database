caption: Hypothetical model of Se homeostasis in brain. Circulating SELENOP present
  in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is taken up by LRP8-positive cells in the
  epithelial (blood–brain barrier) and ependymal (brain–CSF barrier) layers, resynthesized
  in neighboring astrocytes, and released to supply LRP8-positive neurons with Se.
  Within astrocytes, SELENBP1 may sequester Se away from selenoprotein synthesis and
  thereby negatively regulate SELENOP synthesis. Evidence also indicates the existence
  of parallel, non-SELENOP pathway by which a small molecule form of Se enters the
  brain.
