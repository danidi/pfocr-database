caption: Signal transduction pathways potentially modulating HBV transcription and
  replication in HBV-infected hepatocytes. Growth factors, hormones, and cytokines
  may modulate the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
  (PI3K)/phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1)/AKT signal transduction pathway.
  PTEN converts phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) to phosphatidylinositol
  4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3. PIP3 activates PDK1 and AKT
  (, ). AKT is known to phosphorylate PGC1α on serine 570, leading to reduced transcriptional
  activity on known target genes (), including the HBV nucleocapsid gene (black arrows),
  as observed in Huh7 and HepG2 cells. In addition, AKT can directly or indirectly
  inhibit HBV replication in Huh7 and 293T cells at a posttranscriptional step in
  the viral replication cycle potentially involving phosphorylation of the HBV nucleocapsid
  polypeptide (HBcAg) in the arginine-rich carboxyl-terminal domain (ARD) (gray arrows).
