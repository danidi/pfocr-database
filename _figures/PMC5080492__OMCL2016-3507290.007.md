caption: Diagram of HSP90/NF-κB pathway of NSCs survival from oxidative stress. The
  cell death inducing oxidative stress triggers HSP90 to activate IKK/IκB/p65 pathway
  and damage NSCs to apoptosis and death. The inhibition on HSP90 from neural oxidative
  induction will block the NF-κB/p65 signalling activation and rescue the NSCs from
  oxidative damage.
