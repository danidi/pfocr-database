caption: During normal periods of homeostasis (‘no stress’), Nrf2 is kept in the cytoplasm
  by Keap1 which prevents Nrf2 from moving into the nucleus and binding to antioxidant
  response elements (AREs or EpREs) of stress‐responsive genes. Nrf2 levels are kept
  low (despite high rates of synthesis) by first being poly‐ubiquitinylated and then
  targeted for degradation by the 26S Proteasome. In this process, the Cul3 ubiquitin
  ligase component of the Keap1‐Cul3 complex is responsible for poly‐ubiquitinylation
  of Nrf2. During periods of stress, the 26S Proteasome undergoes disassembly by Ecm29
  and HSP70 (generating free 20S Proteasomes) and Nrf2 can no longer be degraded.
  Nrf2 then disassociates from Keap1 and undergoes phosphorylation, enabling it to
  translocate into the nucleus and bind to ARE/EpRE elements in the upstream regions
  of target (protective) genes. These processes are the steps that cause activation
  of the adaptive homeostatic response, leading to the upregulation of stress‐protective
  enzymes an overall, but transient, increase in stress resistance.
