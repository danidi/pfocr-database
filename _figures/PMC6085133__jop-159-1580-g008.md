caption: 'Adenosine signaling modulates pain hypersensitivity behaviors in resiniferatoxin
  (RTX) neuropathy. This diagram shows an analgesia pathway in small-fiber neuropathy:
  (left panel) membrane-bound PAP hydrolysis AMP into adenosine (1) which activates
  A1Rs as the cellular analgesia mechanism (2). (3) TRPV1 coexpressed with PAP and
  A1Rs, and TRPV1 were depleted by RTX, causes a decrease in analgesic adenosine signaling,
  including a reduction in PAP ectonucleotidase activity and A1Rs depletion (dotted
  profiles in right panel). The reduced PAP ectonucleotidase activity causes a decrease
  in extracellular AMP hydrolysis (4), which results in a reduction in adenosine.
  (5) A parallel reduction of A1R(+) leads to the disability of adenosine signaling
  and further exacerbates the development of pain hypersensitivity (6). A1R, adenosine
  A1 receptor; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; PAP, prostatic acid phosphatase; TRPV1,
  transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1.'
