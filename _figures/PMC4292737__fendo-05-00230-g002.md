caption: Hypothetical model of ChREBP and FXR interaction. In response to high glucose
  concentrations, the hexosamine biosynthesis (HBP) pathway is activated leading to
  UDP-GlcNAc production. ChREBP and FXR are in turn O-GlcNAcylated through direct
  binding with the OGT enzyme. O-GlcNAcylation of ChREBP and FXR may represent an
  important feature of their interaction. The physiological or pathophysiological
  consequences of such a modification remains, however, unknown.
