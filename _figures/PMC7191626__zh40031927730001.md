caption: 'Enzymatic cascade involving the renin-angiotensin system, key receptor systems,
  and biological effects. A: renin-angiotensin system cascade showing the angiotensin
  peptide metabolic pathway. ANG I is cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
  to ANG II, which is metabolized by ACE2 to ANG-(1−7). ANG II binds to ANG II type
  1 receptors (AT1Rs) and ANG II type 2 receptors (AT2Rs), whereas ANG-(1−7) binds
  to Mas receptors (MasRs) and opposes ANG II/AT1R actions. B: decreased ACE2 shifts
  the balance in the renin-angiotensin system toward the ANG II/AT1R axis, resulting
  in the progression of cardiovascular disease. Increased ACE2 shifts the balance
  to the ANG-(1−7)/Mas axis, leading to protection from cardiovascular disease. ADH,
  antidiuretic hormone; APA, aminopeptidase A; PCP, prolyl carboxypeptidase (also
  known as angiotensinase C). [Reproduced with permission from Ref. .]'
