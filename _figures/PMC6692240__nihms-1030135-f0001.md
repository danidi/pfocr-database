caption: '(A) Interrelationships of the GABA metabolic pathway and GABA shunt. Abbreviations:
  GAD, glutamic acid decarboxylase; GABA, 4-aminobutyric acid; GABA-T, GABA transaminase
  (also aminobutyrate aminotransferase); α-KG, α-ketoglutarate; SSA, succinic semialdehyde;
  AKR, aldo keto reductase; GHB, gamma-hydroxybutyrate; VGB, vigabatrin (irreversible
  inactivator of GABA-T); SSADH, succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, which is deficient
  in patients with SSADH deficiency (cross-hatched box). The GABA shunt entails production
  of one mole of glutamate for each molecule of GABA converted to succinic acid by
  consumption of a mole of α-ketoglutarate. (B) Concentration of stool GABA in the
  aldh5a1−/− animal model as compared to aldh5a1+/+ mice (statistical analysis, one-tailed
  t test). Note that aldh5a1=aldehyde dehydrogenase 5a1=succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.'
