caption: 'A–B) Classic model of the basal ganglia in healthy (A) and parkinsonian
  (B) conditions. Cortex provides excitatory glutamatergic projections to the putamen
  (a part of striatum), which sends GABAergic inhibitory projections to the GPi and
  the SNr by two pathways: the “direct circuit” (putamen-GPi) and the “indirect circuit”
  (putamen-GPe-STN-GPi/SNr). Dopamine from the SNc facilitates striatal neurons in
  the direct pathway and inhibits those in the indirect pathway. In Parkinson’s disease
  (B), dopamine depletion causes hyper-activity along the indirect circuit and hypo-activity
  along the direct circuit. Green, red, and black arrows denote excitatory (i.e.,
  glutamatergic), inhibitory (i.e., GABAergic), and dopaminergic projections, respectively.
  Thick and thin-dashed arrows indicate hyper- and hypo-activity, respectively. Legend:
  VL = ventrolateral; GPe (GPi) = external (internal) globus pallidus; STN = subthalamic
  nucleus; SNr (SNc) = substantial nigra pars reticulata (pars compacta).'
