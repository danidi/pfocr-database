caption: Schematic representation of the HIF-1 hypoxia response pathway (modified
  from ). When oxygen decreases, the rate of proline hydroxylation decreases, leading
  to accumulation of HIF-1α. This binds to HIF-1β to form an α, β heterodimer. The
  HIF-1 1α/β heterodimer binds to and activates expression of various genes, including
  those encoding glycolytic enzymes (for anaerobic metabolism), VEGF (for angiogenesis),
  inducible nitric oxide synthase and heme-oxygenase-2 (for NO and CO production and
  vasodilatation), EPO (for erythropoiesis), and possibly tyrosine hydroxylase (for
  dopamine production to influence carotid body chemoreception). The products of these
  genes help the cell survive at low oxygen and/or act to restore normal oxygen levels.
  Some gene targets of HIF-1 are induced in most hypoxic cells, while others, like
  EPO, are only induced in specific tissues and hence also require tissue-specific
  regulators. Mitochondrial inhibitors suppressed HIF-1α and show HIF-1α signaling
  is coupled to mitochondrial respiratory chain function. Coupling is present through
  the energy requirements for synthesis of HIF-1α, but it is likely there are other
  links as well.
