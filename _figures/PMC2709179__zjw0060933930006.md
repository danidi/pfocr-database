caption: MetaCore analysis of altered signaling pathways in OSCC samples. A, the cytoskeleton
  remodeling-keratin filaments pathway. B, the type I IFN signaling pathway. Bars
  labeled in red and blue denote up- and down-regulated target proteins, respectively.
  Numbers on the bar indicate the experiment in which the target was quantified. 1,
  16N1/18T1; 2, 16N3/18T3; 3, 16T1/18N1; 4, 16T2/18N2; 5, 16T3/18N3. JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal
  kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; IFNAR, IFN-alpha/beta receptor.
  Interaction mechanism is marked with a symbol in the hexagon in the middle of the
  interaction arrow. CF, complex formation; Cm, covalent modifications; Tr, transcription
  regulation; B, binding; +P, phosphorylation; −P, dephosphorylation; Tn, transport;
  CS, complex subunit.
