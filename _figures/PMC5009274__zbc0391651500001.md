caption: 13C labeling patterns in TAGs and glucose produced in liver after oral [U-13C3]glycerol.
  a, [U-13C3]glycerol may be used immediately as backbones for fatty acid esterification
  or in gluconeogenesis after phosphorylation (“direct” contribution). A fraction
  of [U-13C3]glycerol may be further converted to other trioses and [U-13C3]pyruvate
  entering the TCA cycle prior to glyceroneogenesis or gluconeogenesis (“indirect”
  contribution). The TCA cycle scrambles 13C extensively, labeling all the cycle intermediates,
  including oxaloacetate, that may exit the cycle producing double- or triple-labeled
  trioses. These trioses may be either glyceroneogenic or gluconeogenic. Because PEP
  is a common intermediate for DHAP (becoming glucose carbons 1–3) and GA3P (becoming
  glucose carbons 4–6), an equivalent 13C-labeling pattern is expected between glucose
  carbons 1–3 and carbons 4–6. Thus, the ratio [1,2-13C2]/[2,3-13C2] in glucose must
  be equal to the ratio [5,6-13C2]/[4,5-13C2] in glucose. b, however, PPP activity
  increases the ratio of [1,2-13C2]/[2,3-13C2], but not [5,6-13C2]/[4,5-13C2], by
  producing [1,2-13C2]hexose. Gluconeogenesis directly from [U-13C3]glycerol produces
  [1,2,3-13C3]- or [4,5,6-13C3]hexose. The entry of [1,2,3-13C3]glucose 6-phosphate
  to PPP produces mainly [1,2-13C2]fructose 6-phosphate through decarboxylation in
  the oxidative PPP followed by carbon rearrangement in the non-oxidative PPP. In
  contrast, 13C 3-unit (13C-13C-13C) in [4,5,6-13C3]hexose remains the same even after
  passing through the PPP. Consequently, the 13C-labeling pattern in glucose carbons
  1–3 is sensitive to PPP activity, but the pattern in glucose carbons 4–6 is not.
  Open circles, 12C; black circles, 13C; green circles, 13C after metabolism through
  the TCA cycle; red circles, 13C after metabolism through the PPP. F6P, fructose
  6-phosphate; G3P, glycerol 3-phosphate; G6P, glucose 6-phosphate; GK, glycerol kinase;
  PEPCK, PEP carboxykinase; TPI, triose phosphate isomerase.
