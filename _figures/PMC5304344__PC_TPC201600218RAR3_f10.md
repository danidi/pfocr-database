caption: Model for the Role of DRUS1 and 2 in Viability in the Endothecium and Starch
  Accumulation in Pollen at Anther Stages 11 and 12.(A) In green spikelet anthers,
  the endothecium, which expresses DRUS1 or 2, may receive an unknown signal after
  complete degradation of the tapetum to trigger cell growth and cell wall thickening.
  The viable endothecium cell in turn sends an effector to stimulate UGP2 expression
  in pollen through an unknown pathway, leading to a sharp increase in UGP2, which
  is crucial for starch synthesis.(B) In white spikelet anthers, which do not express
  DRUS1 and 2, the endothecium is unable to receive the survival signal; thus, it
  degrades too early to stimulate UGP2 expression in pollen, resulting in failed starch
  synthesis. This starch deficiency in turn causes upregulation of the monosaccharide
  transporter MST8 to compensate for the sugar shortage.
