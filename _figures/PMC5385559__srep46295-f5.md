caption: The metabolic pathway that was constructed based on potential candidates
  within QTL regions of SOC and SPC. Red letters indicate orthologues underlying the
  SOC-QTL regions, blue letters indicate orthologues underlying the SPC-QTL regions,
  and green letters indicate that these orthologues could be identified in the genomic
  regions of both SOC- and SPC-QTLs. The broken arrows indicate that there are many
  steps between the two compounds.
