caption: Development and differentiation of Breg cells. In bone marrow or fetal liver,
  hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) differentiate through progenitor B cells (Pro-B),
  precursor B cells (pre-B), immature B cells and transitional B cells. For the B1
  subset, migrating to the spleen or peripheral circulation, the transitional B cells
  differentiate into either mature B1a cells or mature B1b cells and eventually differentiate
  into plasmablast cells and plasma cells. Meanwhile, for the B2 subset, the transitional
  B cells differentiate either into follicular (FO) or marginal zone (MZ) B cells
  and eventually into plasmablast cells and plasma cells. Moreover, there is the transitional-2
  marginal-zone precursors (T2-MZPs) B cells stage which is the precursor of MZ B
  cells. Studies have proved that the transitional B cells, MZ cells, T2-MZP cells,
  B1 cells, plasmablasts, and plasma cells can all differentiate into Breg cells with
  different phenotypes. Differentiation pathway of B10 cells in the middle of the
  photograph are listed separately because there are still not enough studies to classify
  them. In the dotted box, there are Breg cells with different phenotype and the source
  of them are still not clear.
