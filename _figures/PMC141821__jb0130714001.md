caption: 'Purine mononucleotide and thiamine pyrophosphate biosynthetic pathways in
  S. enterica. Shown is a schematic representation of the biosynthetic pathways for
  purine mononucleotides and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP). Relevant intermediates
  are indicated. The phosphorylation of AIRs to AIR by STM4066, allowing it to enter
  the pathway as an intermediate, is shown. When present, the gene products responsible
  for the various reactions are indicated near the step they catalyze. Abbreviations:
  PRA, phosphoribosylamine; THZ-P, thiazole phosphate; HMP-PP, 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine
  pyrophosphate.'
