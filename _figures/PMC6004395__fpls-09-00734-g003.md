caption: ABA-dependent signaling pathway in response to temperature stress. Under
  heat stress, ABA-dependent signaling is mediated by NAC, AP2/ERF, and WRKY TFs.
  Under cold stress, ABA can promote expression of CBF4 which can mediate transcription
  of downstream stress responsive genes. ABA interaction with receptor components
  can activate phosphorylation of ABREs which can mediate downstream gene expression.
  In response to osmotic stress, ABA can induce transcription of numerous TF families,
  which induce expression of stress responsive genes. Osmotic stress can also induce
  activation of ABREs which can mediate expression of downstream stress responsive
  genes.
