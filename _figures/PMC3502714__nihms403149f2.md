caption: A) FGF23 is produced by bone cells (primarily osteocytes and osteoblasts),
  circulates in the blood and acts on the kidney to induce phosphaturia, by lowering
  blood phosphorus levels, and inhibiting the production of the active vitamin D metabolite
  1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D3 (1,25 D). This has the negative feedback effect of decreasing
  bone FGF23 production. B) FGF23 acts at renal tubule cells by binding to an FGF
  receptor (FGFR – most likely FGFR1) and its co-receptor Klotho to activate the mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP) kinase/ extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1/2 pathway and decrease
  the transcription, translation and overall activity of the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin
  D3 1-alpha-hydroxylase (1 α hydroxylase), which converts inactive vitamin D to active
  1,25-D. Receptor biding also increases phosphate transport into the urine via the
  sodium-dependent phosphate transporters 2a and c (NaPi2a/c). The latter action partly
  depends upon the coordinated activity with parathyroid hormone receptor/parathyroid
  related protein receptor (PTH/PTHrP-R) stimulated activity of Na/H exchange regulatory
  factor-1 (NHERF1), which is a PDZ domain scaffolding protein that may function to
  stabilize the PTH/PTHrP-R and NaPi2c in a signaling configuration via the protein
  kinase C/protein kinase A (PKC/PKA) pathway. C) Osteocytes and osteoblasts are the
  source of FGF23. In response to elevations in phosphorus and 1,25 D (and to some
  extent further stimulated by activation of the PTH/cAMP pathway), FGF23 transcription,
  translation, and secretion are stimulated. There is evidence that iron has an impact
  on FGF23 levels, which may be by a direct effect on bone cell FGF23 production.
  The mechanism by which it does, and the way in which it does, remain to be defined.
  D) FGF23 processing is carried out by the enzymatic activity of the enzymes polypeptide
  N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3) and a subtilisin-like proprotein convertase
  (SPC), probably furin. The overall level of intact, biologically active FGF23 in
  the circulation is a reflection of the overall activity of GALNT3 and furin. In
  the absence of glycosylation by GALNT3, FGF23 is cleaved by furin and only the processed,
  N-terminal (N-term.) and C-terminal (C-term.) degradation products, which are not
  biologically active, are secreted. The enzyme activity of both GALNT3 and furin
  are regulated by cAMP. There is emerging evidence, through an as yet undefined mechanism,
  that iron too may be able to regulate GALNT3 and/or furin activity.
