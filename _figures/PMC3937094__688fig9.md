caption: Proposed model for initiation of the cAMP pathway by coronin A. In response
  to nutrient deprivation, cells secrete factors that bind to cell surface receptors
  and subsequently activate the Gα2βγ-dependent pathway upon cAMP binding (cAMP relay).
  The data presented in this article suggest a role for coronin A immediately downstream
  of the receptor(s) activated by secreted factors and upstream of the activation
  of the cAMP relay. Coronin A could also mediate the expression of the developmental
  genes via a cAMP-independent pathway, which would then be necessary for the amplification
  of the cAMP relay and thus aggregation.
