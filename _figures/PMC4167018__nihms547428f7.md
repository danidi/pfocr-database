caption: An overview of the modulatory effects of low-dose H2O2 on the functions of
  pDCs. (A) Exposure of resting pDCs to 0.01 µM H2O2 results in a slight increase
  in the expression of costimulatory molecules (CD80 and CD86); CD83, a specific maturation
  markeR.; and OX40-L, a selective regulator of Th2 cell development; however, it
  markedly decreases the expression of the antigen-presenting molecule HLA-DQ. Low-dose
  H2O2 does not trigger production of type I IFNs or modify the basal proinflammatory
  cytokine and chemokine release by pDCs. Furthermore, H2O2-exposed pDCs without TLR-mediated
  activation provide stronger signals for Th2 than for Th1 stimulation. (B) Human
  pDCs selectively express both TLR7 and TLR9 localized in the endoplasmic reticulum.
  TLR7 and TLR9 recognize RNA and DNA fragments of viruses and bacteria, respectively,
  and initiate a signal transduction pathway through a key adaptor molecule, MyD88.
  MyD88-mediated signals activate IRF7 and NF-κB, leading to secretion of type I IFNs,
  proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. Ligation of TLR receptors also leads
  to high expression levels of costimulatory molecules, as well as CD83 and HLA-DQ.
  In this activation state pDCs are able to induce a strong Th1 response upon interaction
  with naïve T cells. (C) In contrast, when pDCs are stimulated with TLR ligands in
  the presence of low-dose H2O2, decreased cytokine and chemokine release as well
  as lowered expression of cell-surface molecules can be detected, indicating that
  pDCs exposed to ROS in vivo may have an anti-inflammatory or a tolerogenic phenotype.
