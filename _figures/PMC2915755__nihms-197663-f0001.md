caption: Diagram depicting the opposite pathways that modulate p21 levels after different
  types of DNA damage. The left panel summarizes the main events in the classical
  p53-dependent p21 upregulation pathway that relies on p53 transcriptional activation
  and leads to cell cycle arrest. The DNA damage-induced p21 proteolysis pathway is
  represented on the right panel. When this pathway is activated, the final p21 levels
  are similarly low regardless of the efficient accumulation of a transcriptionally
  active p53. The latter process depends on the E3 ligase CRL4CDT2 (CUL4-DDB1-CDT2).
  Different experimental models (see main text) have shown that ATR activation is
  required both for the impairment of p21 mRNA transcriptional elongation (with a
  mechanism that involves CHK1 activation) and for the efficient p21 proteolysis (with
  a yet unclear mechanism).
