caption: MiR-148a promotes starvation-induced autophagic activity in HSCs, at least
  in part, through suppressing the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Starvation stimulates
  the upregulation of miR-148a expression, miR-148a can directly interact with the
  3’-UTRs of the Gas1 mRNA and followed by inhibit Hedgehog pathway activity, resulting
  in increased autophagosome accumulation. MiR-148a inhibits proliferation and promotes
  apoptosis by inducing autophagy in HSCs.
